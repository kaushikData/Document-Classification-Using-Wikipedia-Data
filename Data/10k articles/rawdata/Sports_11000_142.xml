The '''Algerian Rugby Federation''' (FAR)&lt;ref&gt;{{lang-ar|الفدرالية الجزائرية للرغبي}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the governing body for [[rugby union in Algeria]]. Algeria became a full member of [[Rugby Africa]] in December 2016.&lt;ref name="General Assembly 2016"&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.rugbyafrique.com/general-assembly-2016 | title=General Assembly 2016 | publisher=Rugby Afrique | accessdate=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The federation is responsible for the [[Algeria national rugby union team|Algerian national team]] and the Algerian Rugby Championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aps.dz/sport/31774-apr%C3%A8s-43-ans-d-absence,-le-rugby-revient-en-alg%C3%A9rie | title=Après 43 ans d'absence, le rugby revient en Algérie | publisher=Soltani Saadi | work=[[Algeria Press Service]] | date=November 18, 2015 | language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is in charge of promoting the sport in Algeria, organizing international matches for the national team, as well as is involved in educating and training players and officials. Algeria have never participated in the [[Rugby World Cup]] qualifiers. Their best result to date is 50-0 wins against [[Egypt]] and [[Libya]],{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} both in a Cairo international tournament in 2010.

==History==
During the French presence in Algeria before 1962, rugby union had its followers either in [[Oran]], [[Guelma]], [[Algiers]] or [[Annaba]] where clubs like Stade Oranais, RIJA, USMMC, AGVGA or ES Guelma were existent. Rugby had its moments of glory{{according to whom|date=December 2016}} and many Algerian players have been able to achieve successful professional careers abroad, especially in France;{{vague||date=December 2016}} but discipline disappeared after the independence of Algeria due to lack of multiple items till 1972 when it disappeared completely.

During the beginning of the 2000s, The Algerian Rugby Clubs Committee was established to revive the discipline before creating the federation. On 17 November 2015 the federation was created in [[Algiers]] during a constitutive general assembly chaired by [[Mustapha Larfaoui]], honorary president of the [[Algerian Olympic Committee|Algerian Olympic and Sports Committee]] and attended by representatives of 18 clubs of 16 wilayas. Sofiane Benhassen was elected first president of the federation.

'''Autodrómo Internacional de Las Américas''' is a paved circuit built in 1998, located near the capital city of the Dominican Republic, Santo Domingo. Its full-length layout is officially approved by the [[FIA]] for [[Formula 1]] [[Grand Prix racing]]. While only an 11 turn, 1.6 mile (2.664&amp;nbsp;km) road course, it is considered to be highly challenging as well as equally highly rewarding; the beautiful Caribbean Coast can be seen just behind Turn One.

== History ==

In 2005, the Circuit played host to the Second Round of the Grand-Am Cup (now [[Continental Tire Sports Car Challenge]]), the Miller Grand-Am Cup 200. It is currently used as a local proving grounds for the best of Caribbean talent, through weekly races and almost a day-by-day usage in race-training purposes.

==History==
Designed by [[Philip Cox|COX Architecture]], the BCEC was constructed by [[CIMIC Group#Leighton Contractors|Leighton Contractors]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brisbane Convention and Exhibition Centre|url=http://www.leightoncontractors.com.au/projects/bne-convention-exhibition-centre/|accessdate=29 March 2014|author=Leighton Holdings}}&lt;/ref&gt; beginning in March 1993 with the demolition of [[World Expo Park]].&lt;ref name=ConventionCentreComparison&gt;{{cite web|title=Major Australian Convention Centres|url=http://www.canberraconvention.com.au/pages/images/Major%20Australian%20Convention%20Comparison%20Report.pdf|accessdate=30 March 2014|author=Canberra Convention Bureau|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140214060816/http://www.canberraconvention.com.au/pages/images/Major%20Australian%20Convention%20Comparison%20Report.pdf|archivedate=14 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building cost $170 million and was mostly funded by the [[Government of Queensland|Queensland Government's]] sale of a casino license, with the remainder funded directly by the government.&lt;ref name=ConventionCentreComparison /&gt; The centre was completed in May 1995, and opened on 6 June.&lt;ref name=About /&gt;

===Expansion===
The design of an expansion to BCEC on Grey Street was approved in 2007.&lt;ref name=ConventionCentreComparison /&gt; [[Laing O'Rourke]] was appointed as the project's builder in June 2009 after a delay caused by budget issues, and construction began in 2010.&lt;ref name=ConventionCentreComparison /&gt;&lt;ref name="LaingO'Rourke"&gt;{{cite web|title=BRISBANE CONVENTION AND EXHIBITION CENTRE.

==Design==
The building is 450 metres in length, 120 m wide and 24 m high.&lt;ref name="aea"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Architecture of East Australia|last=MacMahon|first=Bill|year=2001|publisher=Edition Axel Menges|isbn=3-930698-90-0|page=206|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FUItnsGv-doC|accessdate=9 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The complex roof design is based on five [[hyperbolic paraboloid]]s.&lt;ref name="aea"/&gt; The building is stabilised by concrete [[shear wall]]s and clad in steel.

From 1998 until 2008 the BCEC Great Hall was the home of three times [[National Basketball League (Australasia)|National Basketball League]] (NBL) champions the [[Brisbane Bullets]]. The Bullets moved from the previous home, the 13,500 seat [[Brisbane Entertainment Centre]], due in part to dwindling crowds and the cost of playing out of the [[Boondall]] based stadium. During the [[2011-12 NBL season]] the [[Gold Coast Blaze]] played two home games at the centre.

Since 2008 the Convention Centre has also been the home to the Brisbane-based [[Queensland Firebirds]] who play in [[netball]]'s [[ANZ Championship]]. The Firebirds were a foundation club of the [[Commonwealth Bank Trophy]] (CBT) in 1997 and played at the 2,700 seat [[Chandler Arena]]. When the CBT was retired in 2007 and the ANZ Championship took its place the Firebirds moved to the new championship and also moved into the larger Convention Centre to be its second major tenant alongside the Bullets. The team also plays selected home games at the [[Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre]].

In [[baseball]], the '''double switch''' is a type of player substitution, usually performed by a team while playing defense. The double switch is typically used to make a [[pitch (baseball)|pitching]] substitution, while simultaneously placing the incoming pitcher in a more favorable spot in the batting order than was occupied by the outgoing pitcher. (On the assumption that the pitcher will be a poor hitter, the incoming pitcher will generally take the spot in the batting order of a position player who has recently batted, so as to avoid the pitcher making a [[plate appearance]] in the next couple of innings.) To perform a double switch (or any other substitution), the ball must be [[Dead ball (baseball)|dead]].{{r|"OfficialBaseballRules1"|page=Rule 3.03}}

==Procedure==
Since the batting order can be changed only as a result of a player substitution,{{refn|No player ''currently in the game'' may legally bat in place of another player in the game (except as a result of the designated hitter rule{{r|"OfficialBaseballRules1"|page=Rule 6.10(b)}}). However, it ''is'' possible to successfully [[Batting out of turn|bat out of order]], if the opposing team does not appeal the violation.{{r|"OfficialBaseballRules1"|page=Rule 6.07}}|group = "Note"}} while the defensive arrangement may be changed freely (among players currently in the game), the double switch typically takes the following form:
#Player A (outgoing pitcher, batting soon) is replaced by Player B (a position player), taking Player A's place in the batting order.
#Player C (outgoing position player, batting later than Player A) is replaced by Player D (a pitcher), taking Player C's place in the batting order.
#Player D is pitching in place of Player A, and Player B is fielding in place of Player C.{{refn|According to Major League rules, when more than one defensive substitution is made at the same time, the manager must specify any changes to the batting order, or the [[Umpire (baseball)|umpire-in-chief]] will determine the order by applying Rule 3.03, which states that "[a] substitute player shall bat in the replaced player’s position in the team’s batting order."{{r|"OfficialBaseballRules1"|page=Rule 3.03}}|group = "Note"}}

In the short term, the lineup is strengthened because a poor-hitting pitcher will not make a plate appearance soon. The disadvantage is that a position player must be removed from play and replaced by another, often inferior, position player. The advantage of the double switch over [[pinch hitting]] is that it uses up fewer players. If a relief pitcher is brought in before the at-bat, then the manager can substitute a pinch-hitter for him. However, this would require a new pitcher for the next half-inning. By using a double switch, an incoming pitcher can be left in the game for a substantial period before his turn in the batting lineup arrives, no matter what the previous batting order was.

While the double switch plays an important role in the [[National League]], the [[designated hitter]] (DH) rule has effectively eliminated the advantages of the double switch in the games using American League rules—so the double switch is rarely used in AL games.{{r|"NYTimes1"}} The designated hitter's role is to bat in the pitcher's spot in the lineup.{{r|"OfficialBaseballRules1"|page=Rule 6.10(b)}} Major League rules do not allow a multiple substitution involving a DH to alter the lineup position of the DH.{{r|"OfficialBaseballRules1"|page=Rule 6.10(b)}} Although uncommon, it is possible to forgo the DH privilege (e.g. if the DH becomes a position player, usually due to injury to another player), and then utilize the double switch later with that player. It can also be used by an AL team playing on the road during [[interleague play]] or the [[World Series]], because MLB rules call for the rules of the home team to be used when teams from different leagues meet (so there is no DH when the NL team is the home team).

When the team is up to bat, a manager can get the same effect as a double switch by leaving in the player who has pinch-hit for the pitcher and replacing another player in the lineup who has made the last out of the inning with a new pitcher.  This will take the following form:
#Player A (outgoing pitcher, batting next) is replaced by Player B (a position player) as a pinch-hitter, taking Player A's place in the batting order.
#Player C makes the last out of the inning is replaced by Player D (a pitcher), taking Player C's place in the batting order.
#Player D is pitching in place of Player A, and Player B is fielding in place of Player C.
 
A double switch has infrequently resulted in a team batting out of turn because the lineup card was not updated to reflect the change, either because the umpires were not informed of the change, or because the change was not recorded.{{r|"ESPN1"}} In addition, because double-switches are typically communicated verbally, it creates opportunities for confusion and miscommunication that can be costly to the switching team. {{r|"STRIB1"}}

'''Khan Shaheb Osman Ali Stadium''' ({{lang-bn|খান সাহেব ওসমান আলী স্টেডিয়াম}}) is a cricket stadium located in [[Fatullah]], [[Narayanganj]] in central [[Bangladesh]]. It has a capacity of around 25,000 people. The Field Dimension is 181m X 145 m.

== History ==
{{see also|List of international cricket centuries at Fatullah Osmani Stadium}}
The ground was used in 2004 for matches of the [[2004 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup|ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.espncricinfo.com/bangladesh/content/story/240474.html Fatullah stadium approved for internationals] Retrieved 18 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium became a [[Test cricket]] venue on 9 April 2006, when it hosted a Test match between [[Australian cricket team|Australia]] and [[Bangladeshi cricket team|Bangladesh]].

The stadium hosted the last [[2011 Cricket World Cup|World Cup]] warm up match between England and Pakistan on 18 February 2011. The stadium is the venue of the [[2014 Asia Cup]] for the first round matches. In [[Asia Cup 2014]] [[Bangladesh national cricket team|Bangladesh]] became the first Test nation to lose an [[One Day International|ODI]] against [[Afghanistan national cricket team|Afghanistan]], where Bangladesh lost to Afghanistan by 32 [[run (cricket)|runs]]. It was also nominated as a practice match venue for [[2014 ICC World Twenty20]].&lt;ref name="Janakantha"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailyjanakantha.com/news_view.php?nc=11&amp;dd=2013-08-20&amp;ni=146019 |title=বিকল্প ভেন্যু হিসেবে প্রস্তাবিত নারায়ণগঞ্জের ফতুল্লায় খান সাহেব ওসমান আলী স্টেডিয়াম |newspaper=[[Janakantha|Daily Janakantha]] |author= |date=20 Aug 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second Test was played there when [[India national cricket team|India]] played [[Indian cricket team in Bangladesh in 2015|Bangladesh]] in June 2015.

==Stats and records==
As of 6 March 2016 the ground will host:
* [[Test cricket|Test matches]] - 2
* [[One Day International|ODIs]] - 10
* [[Twenty20 International|T20I]] - 4
* [[First-class cricket|First-class matches]] - 52
* [[List A cricket|List A matches]] - 95

==Outer Ground==
The smaller ground next to Fatullah Osmani Stadium, the '''Khan Shaheb Osmani Ali Stadium Outer Ground''', has been used for domestic first-class, List A and T20 cricket since 2013-14. The outer ground was first used for the [[2016 Asia Cup]] Twenty20 International tournament qualifying round. The first match of the ground was held between Afghanistan and UAE on 19 February 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/asia-cup-2015-16/engine/match/966713.html | title=Asia Cup - 1st Match, Qualifying Group, AFG v UAE | publisher=ESPNcricinfo | accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In competitive [[rowing (sport)|rowing]], the following specialized terms are important in the corresponding aspects of the sport:

== Boat classes ==

In competitive rowing events, abbreviations are used for different boat classes.

;Weight:
*L, LWT or Lt: [[Lightweight|Lightweight rowing]]
*If not present the crew is open weight

;Age:
*J: Junior(Under 19 years of age)
*B: Senior B (Under 23 years of age)
*Masters: over 27, includes a letter designation for the average age of the crew:
**A - 27 years of age and older
**B - 36 years of age and older
**C - 43 years of age and older
**D - 50 years of age and older
**E - 55 years of age and older
**F - 60 years of age and older
**G - 65 years of age and older
**H - 70 years of age and older
**I - 75 years of age and older
**J - 80 years of age and older
*If none of these abbreviations are present the crew is Senior A
*These age categories are effectively common to both FISA (Bye-Law to Rule 27) and USRowing (Rule 4-104) rules.  USRowing also designates a AA category for ages 21&amp;ndash;26, and defines Masters as over 21 rather than 27.&lt;ref name=FISA&gt;{{cite web|title=Rules of racing and related by-laws|url=http://www.worldrowingmagazine.com/fisarulebook/2011#pg63|accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USRowing"&gt;{{cite web|title=US Rowing Rules 2014|url=http://www.usrowing.org/Libraries/Referees/2014RORFinalWeb_1.sflb.ashx/2011RORnodirectory_1.sflb.ashx|accessdate=3 April 2014}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
*There are no age restrictions for coxswains and their age is not factored into the average age of the crew.&lt;ref name=FISA/&gt;&lt;ref name=USRowing/&gt;

;Gender:
*M: Men's
*W: Women's
*Mixed: Equal numbers of either gender (excluding coxswain)

;Crew Size:
*1, 2, 4, 8: The number of rowers in the crew. It is common to use [[Roman numerals]], especially when referring to a VIII.

;Discipline:
*x: [[Sculling|Sculling boat]]
* If not present then the boat is [[Sweep (rowing)|sweep-oar]]

;Coxswain:
*+: Coxed (with [[coxswain (rowing)|coxswain]])
*-: Coxless (without coxswain)
*If not present then the boat is coxless, except for an eight.

;Examples:

* M8+ = Men's eight
* W4- = Women's coxless four (or "straight four")
* LM2- = Lightweight men's coxless pair
* BM1x = Men's single sculls under age 23
* JW4x = Junior women's quad
* Masters WC2x = Masters women's double sculls with average crew age between 43-49
* Mixed Masters 8+ = Eight with 4 women and 4 men as rowers and a coxswain of either gender

== The boats ==
Sometimes called '''"[[Racing shell|shells]]"''' in the [[United States|US]]

===Sweep===
In a [[Sweep (rowing)|sweep boat]], each rower has one oar.
;[[Eight (rowing)|Eight]] (8+) : A shell with 8 rowers. Along with the single scull, it is traditionally considered to be the [[blue ribbon]] event. Always with coxswain because of the size, weight and speed of the boat - bow loader eights exist but are banned from most competitions for safety reasons.
;Four (4-) or (4+) : A shell with 4 rowers. [[Coxless four]]s (4-) are often referred to as straight fours, and are commonly used by lightweight and elite crews and are raced at the Olympics. In club and school rowing, one more frequently sees a [[coxed four]] (4+) which is easier to row, and has a coxswain to steer.
;Pair (2-) or (2+): A shell with 2 rowers. The [[Coxless pair]] (2-), often called a straight pair, is a demanding but satisfying boat to master. [[Coxed pair]]s (2+) are rarely rowed by most club and school programs. It is no longer an Olympic class event, but it continues to be rowed at the [[World Rowing Championships]].

===Sculling===
In a [[sculling]] boat, each rower has two oars or 'sculls', one on each side of the boat.
;Octuple (8x): A shell having 8 rowers with two oars each. Generally a training boat, but raced by juniors in the UK.
;[[Quad scull|Quad]] (4x): A shell having 4 rowers with two oars each. Can be coxed (4x+) but is usually coxless (4x-).
;Triple (3x): A shell for three scullers with two oars each, usually without a coxswain. These boats are considerably rare.
;[[Double scull|Double]] (2x): A shell for two scullers generally without a coxswain.
;[[Single Scull|Single]] (1x) : A shell designed for an individual sculler. Very good for skill development, particularly beginners, and a very competitive class at world events, WRC. Extremely rare is the coxed single which is only used as a training boat or for adaptive rowing.

===Open water boat===
A shell with positive flotation, self-bailing capacity, a non-binding stretcher, and no forestay so re-entry is easier. These boats are generally shorter and wider at the waterline than boats designed for flat water racing.

==Equipment / parts of the boat==
[[Rigging]] is how the boat is outfitted, including all of the apparatuses (oars, outriggers, oarlocks, sliding seats, etcetera) attached to a boat that allow the rower to propel the boat through the water. The term comes from an old [[Old English language|Old English]] ''wrigan'' or ''wrihan,'' which means "to clothe."  It literally means to outfit or clothe a boat. ''Rigging'' also refers to the configuration of the boat and settings of the apparatuses. The following terms are often associated with a boat's rigging, along with other often used terms for equipment used in rowing.
[[Image:Doppelzweier oben.jpg|thumb|350px|The inside of a double scull. Shows the seat, slides, backstops, footplate, shoes and riggers.]]
; Backstay : A brace which is part of the rigger of sweep rowing boats, which extends toward the bow from the top of the pin.
; Backstop : The stop mechanism on the seat slides which prevents the rower's seat from falling off the sliding tracks at the back end (towards the boat's bow) of the slide tracks. Also, in the UK, the sliding seat position closest to the boat's bow. As a command, it instructs the crew to adopt this position. (The US calls this seat position the "back end").
; Blade : The spoon or hatchet/cleaver shaped end of the oar. Also used to refer to the entire oar.
; [[Bowloader]] / bowcox / bow steered : A shell in which the coxswain seat is near the bow of the boat rather than its stern. The seat in a bow loader partially enclosed and is designed so that the coxswain is virtually lying down, in order to reduce wind resistance and distribute coxswains weight so as to create a lower center of gravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glossary of Rowing Terms|url=http://www.usrowing.org/About/Rowing101/Glossary.aspx|publisher=U.S. Rowing}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
; [[Bow (ship)|Bow]] : The front section of a shell; the first section of the shell to cross the finish line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glossary of Rowing Terms|url=http://www.usrowing.org/About/Rowing101/Glossary.aspx|publisher=U.S. Rowing|accessdate=2012-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
; Bow ball : A small, soft ball no smaller than 4&amp;nbsp;cm diameter securely attached to a rowing or sculling boat's bow. Primarily intended for safety, but also used in deciding which boat crossed the finish line first in very close races. 
; Bow number : A card displaying the lane number assigned to the boat for a race.
; Bow rigged: (UK) The person stroking the boat has their oar on the bowside (starboard or right side) rather than the typical Strokeside of the boat.
; [[Bow (rowing)|Bowside]] : (UK) The [[starboard]] or right side of a boat. Derives from the tradition of having the bow rower's oar be on the starboard or right side of the boat.
; {{anchor|canvas}}Canvas : The deck of the bow and stern of the boat, which were traditionally covered with canvas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.britishrowing.org/upload/files/CoachingTraining/rowing-glossary.pdf | title = Rowing Glossary | publisher = British Rowing | accessdate = 2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Cleaver blade : Modern oar blades that have a more rectangular hatchet-shape. (also ''hatchet blade'')
; Collar / Button : A wide plastic ring placed around the sleeve of an oar. The button stops the oar from slipping through the oarlock.
; [[Cox box]]: Portable voice amplifier; may also optionally incorporate digital readouts displaying stroke rate, boat speed and times.
; Coxmate: A portable amplification device, similar to a coxbox, incorporating a digital readout. Higher models may also have a built in radio and speed sensor.
; [[Empacher]] slot : A UK term for the clip at the on the top of the bow for holding racing number plates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ballcupregatta.org.uk/competitor.html |title=Instructions to Competitors:Ball Cup Regatta |accessdate=2008-05-02 |quote=All boats must have an Empacher slot.

; [[Indoor rower|Ergometer]] (also ergo or erg) : An indoor rowing machine.
; Foot stretcher : An adjustable footplate, to which a pair of shoes is typically attached, which allows the rower to easily adjust his or her physical position relative to the slide and the oarlock. The footplate can be moved (or "stretched") either closer to or farther away from the slide frontstops. (also "Footplate", "Footchock", or "Footstop")
[[Image:Croker Sculling Oars.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Two sculling oars. The "blades" are at the top of the picture and the handles are at the bottom of the picture. The blades are "hatchet blades."]]
; Frontstop : The stop mechanism on the seat slides which prevents the rower's seat from falling off the sliding tracks at the front end (towards the boat's stern) of the slide tracks. Also, in the UK, the sliding seat position closest to the boat's stern. As a command, it instructs the crew to adopt this position. (The US calls this seat position the "front end")
; Gate : (UK) Bar across the top of rowlock, secured with a nut, which prevents the oar from coming out of the rowlock. Also historically used to refer to the oarlock or rowlock.  
; German rigged: A boat where a pair of oarsmen, usually seats 4 and 5 in the engine room, both row on the same side of the boat (also known as Italian rigged or tandem-rigged, as favoured by [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] in the 2012 and 2013 [[Boat Race]]s).
; [[Gunwale]]s : (pronounced: gunnels) The top rail of the shell (also called Saxboard)
; Handle : The part of the oar that the rowers hold and pull with during the stroke.
; Hatchet blade : Modern oar blades that have a more rectangular hatchet-shape and which are not symmetrical. (also ''cleaver blade'')
; [[Hull (watercraft)|Hull]] : The actual body of the shell.
; Inboard : The length of the oar shaft measured from the button to the handle.
; [[Keelson]] : A structure timber resembling the keel, but on the inside of the shell.
; [[Launch (boat)|Launch]]: A motorboat used by rowing instructors, coaches or umpires.  Referred to as a "coach boat" in Canada.
; Leather/sleeve : A thick piece of leather (plastic on modern oars) around the oar to keep the oar lock from wearing out the shaft of the oar (typically wood or carbon fiber).  
; Lines : The ropes held by the coxswain to control the rudder.
; Loom : The part of the oar between the blade and the handle.
; [[Macon spoons|Macon blade]] : Traditional U-shaped oar blade. (also ''spoon blade'' and ''tulip'')
; [[Oar]] : A slender pole which is attached to a boat at the Oarlock. One end of the pole, called the "handle," is gripped by the rower, the other end has a "blade," which is placed in the water during the propulsive phase of the stroke.
; [[Oarlock]] : The rectangular lock at the end of the rigger which physically attaches the oar to the boat. The oarlock also allows the rower to rotate the oar blade between the "square" and "feather" positions. Also historically called 'Rowing Gate' by some manufacturers.
; Outboard : The length of the oar shaft measured from the button to the tip of the blade.
; [[Outrigger]] : (See ''Rigger'')
; Pin : The vertical metal rod on which the rowlock rotates.
; Pogies/poagies : A type of mitten with holes on each end, which allow the rower to grip the oar with bare hands while also warming the hands, used frequently by rowers in colder climates.
; [[Port (nautical)|Port]] or portside: (US) The left side of the boat when facing forward (strokeside in UK).
[[Image:Rowing Sport Oarlock.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An oarlock attached to a rigger]]
; Ribs : The name given to that part of the boat to which the skin of the hull is attached. They are typically made of wood, aluminum or composite materials and provide structural integrity. (see also shoulder).
; Rigger : Rowing slang name for an [[outrigger]]. It is a projection from the side (gunwale) of a racing shell.[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/outrigger] The oarlock is attached to the far end of the rigger away from the boat. The rigger allows the racing shell to be narrow thereby decreasing drag, while at the same time placing the oarlock at a point that optimizes leverage of the oar. There are several styles of riggers, typically attached either to the side of the hull or to the top of the gunwales.  The most common is the triangle frame or Euro rigger (USA), with two points attached to the boat (and almost always with a backstay in addition), and the third point being where the oarlock (gate) is placed.  ''Rigging'' refers to whether a boat is stroked by a port or starboard (i.e. port-rigged, starboard-rigged). With sweep rowing, riggers typically alternate sides, though it is not uncommon to see two adjacent seats rigged on the same side of the boat.
; Roller : The wheels upon which the seat slide travels along its track.
; [[Rowlock]] : Often used in the UK to for an Oarlock (see above). Also historically called 'Rowing Gate' by some manufacturers.
; [[Rudder]] : Adjacent to the skeg and used by the coxswain (or in some coxless boats, by a rower using a "toe" or foot steering mechanism) to steer the boat via attached cables. Extra-large rudders are used on narrower and/or bendier rivers.
; Saxboard : The sides and top edge of a boat, to which the riggers attach - see also [[Gunwale]]s
; Scull : (a) An oar made to be used in a sculling boat where each rower has two oars, one per hand (b) A boat (shell) that is propelled using sculling oars, e.g., a "single scull," is a one-person boat where the rower has two oars.
; Seat : Molded seat mounted on wheels, single action or double action. Single action is fixed bearing wheel, double action is wheel on axle that rolls on track and rolls on horns of seat. A secondary meaning of location in the shell, the bow seat is one, and is numbered upward to the stroke seat (8, in an 8-man shell). Thirdly can mean a competitive advantage in a race, to lead a competitor by a seat is to be in front of them by the length of a single rower's section of a shell.
; [[Boat positions (sport rowing)|Seating]] : Seating positions in a racing shell are generally numbered from the bow to the stern in English-speaking countries, unlike many non-English-speaking countries which count from the Stroke forward.  Generally the forwardmost rower is called the "Bow" and the aftmost rower the "Stroke", regardless of the number of rowers in the boat, with all other seats simply being numbered.  So for instance the crew of an eight (with coxswain) would number off from the bow: "Bow", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five", "Six", "Seven", "Stroke", whereas a four (with or without coxswain) or a quad would number off: "Bow", "Two", "Three", "Stroke".
; [[Racing shell|Shell]] : The boat used for rowing.
; Shoulder : Load bearing supports that mount rigger and attach to keel of boat. (also ''knee'')
; [[Skeg]] (or fin) : Thin piece of flat metal or plastic that helps stabilize the shell in the water.
; Slides (or tracks) : Hollow rails upon which a rower or sculler's sliding seat will roll. Older shells might be convex rails with double wheels.
; Slings : Folding, portable temporary boat holders. Two are required to hold a boat.
; Smoothie : A blade design in which the face of the oar blade is smooth, without the traditional central spine.
; Speed coach : A device mounted on the keel of some high-performance shells that determines the boat's speed based on the speed of a small propeller and transmits this information to the ''coxbox''.
; Spoon blade : Traditional U-shaped oar blade, which is symmetrical down the center of the shaft. (also ''Macon blade'' or "Tulip")
; [[Starboard]] (or Starboard side) : (US) The right side of the boat when facing forward. (Bowside in UK)
; Starboard rigged: (US) A boat where the stroke rower is a starboard rower. (Bow Rigged in UK)
; Starting gate : A structure at the starting line of the race. The shell is “backed” into the starting gate. Once in the gates a mechanism, or person lying on the starting gate, holds the stern of the shell.
; State room : The space between the gunwales (UK).
; [[Stern]] : The rear section of a shell.
; Stretcher : A slang abbreviation for '''Foot Stretchers'''.
; [[Stroke (rowing)|Strokeside]] : (UK) The port or left side of the boat (even if the boat is bow rigged). Derives from the tradition of having the stroke rower's oar be on the port or left side of the boat.
; Swivel : The rowlock/oarlock. Often referred as ''gate'' due to the securing bar/gate at its top.
; Toe : In some boats without a coxswain, a rower may be able to control the rudder and steer the boat by changing the direction his foot points.  This is called "toeing a boat."  And the mechanism is called a "toe." (also: "foot steering")
; Top-Nut : The [[Nut (hardware)|nut]] which screws onto the top of the pin holding the Rowlock in place.
; Tracks : (see ''Slides'')
; Tulip : (see ''Spoon Blade'')
; Wheel : (see ''Roller)''
; Wing Rigger : More modern version of an outrigger in the shape of a wing. It has a stiffer workthru which makes the boat more responsive to the power of the stroke. This can also have the extra support of a backstay. Wing riggers can either be stern or bow rigged.

== The commands ==
;"(#) At the catch": Command to tell the rowers to put their oars in water in preparation to start rowing.
; "(#) Fall in/out" : These commands tell the rower(s) either to stop rowing or to start rowing with everyone else. (#) indicates the number of rower(s) who should start or stop – e.g. “Bow pair fall-out, stern pair fall-in in two..”
; "Ahead" or "Look Ahead" : Command shouted by a crew about to be overtaken by another crew, telling the overtaking crew of their presence.
; "(#) tap it" or "(#) row on" : Tells the rowers to row until told to stop –e.g. “Two, hit it...”
; "Back it down" : To have the rowers place their blades at the release position, squared, and push the oar handle towards the stern of the boat. This motion causes the shell to move backwards.
; "Blades Down" or "Drop" : Used to tell the rowers to place their blades back on the water after performing an easy-all.
; "Blades in (side)" : Tell the rowers on one side to pull their blades in, in order to prevent hitting an object or another boat in the water, or to let another crew pass on a narrow river.
; "Cant it upriver/downriver" : While carrying the shell, the athletes are commanded to hold the shell in a diagonal position, the high side as stated.
; "Check it/her down" : Square the oars in the water to stop the boat.
; "Count Down" (or "number off") : Tells the crew to call out their seat number, starting at the bow, when ready to row.
; "Down on port/starboard" : Means that the boat is leaning to one side or the other. Rowers on the side that is down must raise their hands, and the other side must lower their hands.
; "Easy" (or "ease up") : (USA) To stop rowing hard.
; "Easy oars" (or "Easy There") : (UK) To stop.
; "Even it out" (or "even pressure") : This command tells the rowers to pull with even pressure on both sides. This is the complement to ease-up.
; "Firm up" : Tells the rowers to apply more pressure as needed.
; "push for 10" (or "power ten") : Commands the crew to row 10 strokes of special effort. It is frequently given when a crew is attempting to pass another boat.
; "Gunnel!" : A command by the coxswain, where the rowers all hit the gunwales (sides) of the boat with their oar handles. Used in set exercises occasionally.
; "Hands in" : Tells the rowers to grab the ribs on the inside of the boat so that the boat can be rolled from heads. The coach or cox uses this command when the crew is putting the shell in the water.
; "Hands on" : Tells the rowers to grab the boat next to their seats, so that the boat can be moved.
; "Hands out" (or "sit ready to shove") : Tells the rowers to grab the dock in preparation for shoving off.
; "Hard on port/starboard" (or "port/starboard pressure") : The rowers on that side of the boat must row harder (and the opposite side must row slightly easier) in order to facilitate a sharper turn.
; "Heads" or "Heads Up" : Off the water, a shout to alert others to watch out for a boat being carried.
; "to Heads, ready, up" : Tells the rowers to press the boat above their heads.
; "Hold it/her up" : (UK) Stop the boat.
; "Hold it/her hard" : (UK) Emergency stop.
; "Hold Water" : (USA) Emergency stop, also used after the command way enough.  It instructs the rowers to square their blades in the water to stop the boat.
; "In 2..." : Most water commands are appended prior to the command to take place after two strokes. For example, "In 2, Power 10" or "In 2, Way-enough."
; “Inside Grip” : A command used when lifting the boat. Grab the boat so that you can lift it over your head. Grab only the gunwale or hull structure - do not lift by the footstop assembly.
; "Lay Hold" (or "hands on") : Command given telling the athletes to go to their stations and grab a hold of the boat.
; "Let it/her run" : To stop rowing after a given piece of on the water rowing length, but to put the handles of the oars either to the gunwales or out in front of the rower, in such a manner that the oar paddles are parallel to the water yet not touching it. This allows the boat to glide for a distance leaving no paddle wake in the water. Similar, but not exactly the same is the command "Gunnel", where rowers push the oars until the handle touches the boat's gunwale.
; "Paddle" : Tells a crew to row with just enough pressure to move the boat. The paddle command is also used to bring a crew down from full pressure at the end of a workout piece or race.
; “Pick it / Picking” : A rapid stroke where rowers use only their arms and use minimal pressure. An effective and impressive way to turn a boat when done right.
; "Power 10" (or "10 firm" ): The command to take 10 strokes at more than full pressure. Used for passing and gaining water in a race. (sometimes "Power 5", "Power 20", or "Power 30")
; "Ready all, Row" : Begin rowing.
; "Roll it" : Tells the crew to flip the boat over, in unison, from above their heads.
; "Set it up" : Reminds the rowers to keep the boat on keel.
; "Settle" : A command and a part of the race. This tells the rowers that the crew is going to bring the stroke rate down for the body of the race, but still maintain the pressure. This usually occurs in the middle of the race.
; "Ship Oars" : Act of removing the oars from the oar locks and allowing them to float alongside the boat.
; "Shoulders, ready, up" : Tells the crew to lift the boat from any position below their shoulders, up to shoulder height. Can be reversed to lower the boat from heads to shoulders, i.e., “Shoulders, ready, down!” This is the best position for carrying a shell.
; "Sit in" : Tells the crew to get into the boat.
; "Sit ready" : Commands the crew to move to the catch blades buried, and be ready to start the race.
; "Scull" : A command used if the stern is held by a stake boat. "Port scull" usually means Two seat takes Bow's oar in front of him/her and rows lightly with it. Likewise, "Starboard scull" means Three seat takes Two seat's oar and does the same. This is easier than having one seat take a stroke since it can move the boat in a more parallel direction.
; "Swing it" : A command used when carrying a boat to start turning either bow or stern.
; "Take the run off" : To stop rowing and hold the blades at a 45 degree angle in the water to slow the boat down.
; “Touch it / Touching” : A stroke where rowers use only their arms and back. Used mostly for warm-up or to turn a boat.
; "One foot up &amp; out" : The command for exiting a team boat.
; "On the square / Square blades rowing" : To row without feathering the blades on the recovery.
; "Waist, ready, up" : Tells the crew to lift the shell to their waist.
; "Watch your blades (side)" : Tells one side to look out at their blades, and take action to prevent them possibly hitting something.
; "Way enough" : The command to stop rowing or, in some cases, whatever the rower is doing, whether it be walking with the boat overhead or rowing. ("Way" is a nautical term for the movement of a boat through water (as in headway and right-of-way). So the command "way enough", literally means to enough moving the boat).  Often pronounced way-nuf, wane-up or wane-off in the United States.

== The stroke ==
; Air stroke: To take a stroke without the blade having been placed in the water, resulting in a complete lack of power.
; Backsplash : Water thrown back toward the bow direction by the blade as it enters the water. Less is best. This indicates that the blade has been properly planted before the rower initiates the drive.
; Backwater : To propel the shell backwards.
; Body angle : Amount of forward lean of rower's body from hips at the catch.
; Bury the blade : Submerge the blade totally in the water.
; Catch : The part of the stroke at which the oar blade enters the water and the drive begins. Rowers conceptualize the oar blade as 'catching' or grabbing hold of the water.
; Catch point : Where the blade enters the water.
; Check : The amount of interruption of the forward movement—usually occurs at the catch and sometimes at the release.
; Cover : The distance between one set of puddles and the next set of puddles.
; {{visible anchor|Crab}}, or Catch a crab : A rowing error where the rower is unable to timely remove or release the oar blade from the water and the oar blade acts as a brake on the boat until it is removed from the water. This results in slowing the boat down. A severe crab can even eject a rower (colloquially an "ejector crab") from the shell or capsize the boat (unlikely except in small boats). Occasionally, in a severe crab, the oar handle will knock the rower flat and end up behind him/her, in which case it is referred to as an 'over-the-head crab.'
; Drive : The propulsive portion of the stroke from the time the oar blade enters the water ('catch') until it is removed from the water ('release').
; Drunken octopus / drunken spider : The poor technique evident when an [[Eight (rowing)|Eight]] (8+) is rowed with no two oars moving in the same time or position in the stroke.
; {{visible anchor|Feather}} : To turn the oar so that its blade is parallel with the water (opposite of ''square'').
; Finish : The portion of the pull-through just as the oar is taken from the water.
; Hands away : At the close of the drive phase, the hands move away from the body.
; Hanging at the catch : The blade is hesitating at the catch point, before entering the water.
; Hot seating : When two crews share the same shell, during a regatta, sometimes it is necessary for the crews to switch at the finish line without taking the boat from the water.
; Inside hand : The oarsmen's hand nearest the oar lock. This is the feathering hand.
; Jumping the slide : A problem where the seat becomes derailed from the track while rowing.
; Keel : The balance of the boat. Good keel means that the stability of the boat is good. "keep keel" is a command often heard from the coxswain when the boat starts to sway. (US)
; Lay-back : What the rowers have when they sit with their legs flat and lean towards the bow of the boat with their body.
; Leg drive : Power applied to the stroke, at the catch, by the force of driving the legs down. Often heard being yelled from the coach boat.
; Missing water : A technical fault where the rower begins the drive before the catch is complete.
; Outside hand : The hand of a rower that is placed on the end of the oar handle.
; Over reach : Fault done by an oarsman when he comes to his full reach forward and then attempts to obtain even greater length by releasing his grasp on the handle with his outside hand or by bringing his outside shoulder further forward.
; Pause paddling : Rowing with a pause between each stroke. The coxswain or rower giving commands will indicate where in the stroke this pause should be taken.
; Pitch : The angle between a "squared" blade and a line perpendicular to the water's surface.
; Puddles : Disturbances made by an oar blade pulled through the water. The farther the puddles are pushed past the stern of the boat before each catch, the more “run” the boat is getting.
; Pull through : The portion of the stroke from the catch to the finish (when the oar is in the water). This is the propulsive part of the stroke.
; Rating : The number of strokes executed per minute by a crew. (''also Stroke rate'')
; Ratio : The relationship between the time taken during the propulsive and recovery phases of a rowing or sculling action.
; Recovery : The non-work phase of the stroke where the rower returns the oar from the release to the catch.
; Release : At the end of the drive portion of the stroke. It is when the oar blade(s) is removed (or released) from the water.
; Run : Distance a shell travels during each stroke.
; Rushing : When rowers move too quickly along their tracks into the catch. The boat will lose the feeling that it is gliding or "running out."
; Set : The balance of the boat. Affected by handle heights, rowers leaning, and timing, all of which affect the boat's balance, after which the coxswain tells rowers to "set the boat". (see ''keel'').
; Shooting your slide : When an oarsman's seat moves toward the bow faster than his shoulders.
; Skying : A blade that is too high off the surface of the water during the recovery. The rower's hands are too low causing an upset to the balance of the boat (the "set").
; Spacing / Run : Distance between bowman's puddle on one stroke and the point at which the No. 7 rower catches water on the next stroke.
; Split time (split) : Amount of time it takes to row 500 meters. Displayed on all ergs and on coxboxes installed on boats with ''speed coaches'' (see above).
; Square : To turn the oar so that its blade is perpendicular to the water (opposite of ''feather'').
; Stroke :
:#One complete cycle through the process above.
:#The rower in the stern of a multi-person shell, whose timing is followed by the other rowers.
; Stroke rate : The number of strokes executed per minute by a crew. (also ''rating'')
; Swing : A feeling in the boat when the rowers are driving and finishing their strokes strongly and getting good layback.
; Three-quarter/Half/Quarter slide : Shortened strokes, often used during the start of a race or in a warm-up.
; Walking : When passing a boat, the coxswain announces each seat as it is passed.
; Washing out : When an oar blade comes out of the water during drive and creates surface wash that causes the shell to lose power and become unsteady.

== The race ==
; Start : In head to head races, the start is one of the most important parts of the race. In head races, where boats do not race next to each other, there is a running start, where rowing begins before the starting line and rowers are already at full speed when they cross the start. In sprints (head-to-head), the start consists of the following sections:
:# Actual start: This is generally five or six partial strokes done at a high rate and in a certain pattern, i.e. some three-quarter length strokes (sometimes called three-quarters slide, or "draws"), followed by half strokes ("winds"), which are then lengthened into full length strokes. The goal is to get the rowers off to a cohesive start and quickly build momentum, with the rate of the draws being held by the subsequent lengthens. In the draws, it is important to grip the water gently at first and not to "rip", causing turbulence and not transmitting energy effectively. An example start, called by the coxwain, would go as such: "Draw....there! Draw....there! Wind one! Wind two! Wind three! Lengthen it out....Lengthen....Lengthen". The tone, pitch and rhythm of the cox's voice helps to guide the crew as to what is required.
:# High Ten: A set of strokes done at a high cadence immediately after the start. Not to be confused with "Power Ten," the high ten is ten strokes at a high rating to finish building speed. Some crews may pull fifteen or twenty high strokes to build even more speed.
:# Settle: Immediately after the rowers complete their high cadence strokes, the stroke tempo is lowered and the stroke lengthened to the rating to be used throughout the body of the race. Often accompanied by a Power 10 or 20. Coxswains may call a "Ten to Settle" or "Ten to Glide" to drop the cadence more gradually.
: In bumps racing, the start is of greater importance. Since this kind of racing is focussed on catching the boat starting a length and a half ahead (and equally avoiding being caught), more effort is put into the start than with other types of racing, since it is sure that every other boat will do the same. If you are caught off the start, there is no chance to make it good later in the race. The obvious consequence is that if a boat's individual race goes the whole distance, the extra effort early on takes a toll.
; Body : The body of the race is carried out at a consistent rating, with power tens called as the coxswain deems necessary.
; Piece : A race simulation, whereby the rowers row a typical racing distance as fast as possible, the purpose is to train the rowers for endurance and anaerobic fitness and generally prepare them for the real race. Pieces are usually acknowledged by the coach: "We will do a piece".
; [[Repechage]] : The “second chance” race given to those crews which fail to qualify for the finals from an opening heat. “Rep” qualifiers move onto semi-finals or finals depending on the number of entries. Used in international racing.
; Sprint : The last 500 meters of most races are generally at a much higher rating than the rest of the race, as crews pull to exhaustion.
; Flutter/Shunt : In head-to-head races, the coxswain may decide to call a flutter, which is essentially the six-stroke start put into the race close to the end. The flutter may push one boat which is trailing another a few seats ahead, but is extremely demanding on a crew. In many cases, it is used as a desperation move when all other options have been exhausted.
; [[Head race]] : A long race in which rowers race a twisting course of about 3 miles. A race for time. The start is staggered. Usually in the fall months.

== Miscellaneous ==
; Betting shirts: In collegiate competition, crews sometimes "bet" their shirts on the race, and the loser must render a racing shirt with their logo on it to the winner. Traditionally, this was done as the boats were pulled together right after the race ended and shirts were exchanged, but it is now usually done off the water. While there has been questions in regards to the legality of this practice after women's collegiate crew joined the NCAA, the tradition of betting shirts is upheld by the NCAA Operating Bylaws, Section 10.3.1.1.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/D111.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The term can refer to either the practice or the shirt itself; some crews have shirts made specifically for betting so as to keep their racing jerseys should they lose a race.

; Egg beater: A race where the crews are drawn randomly from a hat, so that boats are made up of members from different teams and often the lineups include coxswains as rowers and vice versa. Also known as scratch race.

; Scratch crew: A crew which has not rowed with each other before.

; Open water race: Competition on unsheltered water exposed to current, tide, wind and requiring navigation skills as well as strength, endurance, and technique. Generally uses a mass start and includes a mix of human-powered boats. Typical race distances are 6 to 26 miles.

; Pot : A [[tankard]] awarded as a prize to each member of a winning crew.

; Seat race : A method to compare two rowers in fours or eights. Two boats race against each other once. One rower from each boat switch positions, and the two boats race again. Relative performance in the two races is used to compare the abilities of the two rowers.

[[File:Soccer goalkeeper.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A goalkeeper in action.]]
The '''goalkeeper''', often shortened to '''keeper''' or '''goalie''', is one of the major [[association football positions|positions]] of [[association football]]. It is the most specialised position in the sport. The goalkeeper's primary role is to prevent the opposing [[football team|team]] from [[Scoring in association football|scoring]] (moving the [[football (ball)|ball]] over the defended [[Association football pitch#Goals|goal-line]] within the frame of the [[Football_pitch#Goals|goal]]). This is accomplished by the goalkeeper moving into the path of the ball and either catching it or directing it away from the vicinity of the goal line. Within the [[penalty area]] goalkeepers are able to use their hands, making them (outside [[throw-ins]]) the only players on the field permitted to handle the ball. The special status of goalkeepers is indicated by them wearing different coloured [[Kit (association football)|kits]] from their teammates.

The [[back pass rule]] prevents goalkeepers handling direct passes back to them from teammates. Goalkeepers usually perform [[goal kicks]], and also give commands to their defense during [[corner kicks]], [[direct free kick|direct]] and [[indirect free kicks]], and [[marking (association football)|marking]].  Goalkeepers play an important role in directing on field [[Association football tactics and skills|strategy]] as they have an unrestricted view of the entire [[Pitch (sports field)|pitch]], giving them a unique perspective on play development.

The goalkeeper is the only required position of a team. If they are [[sport injury|injured]] or [[Red card (association football)|sent off]], a substitute goalkeeper has to take their place, otherwise an outfield player must take the ejected keeper's place in goal. In order to replace a goalkeeper who is sent off, a team usually substitutes an outfield player for the backup keeper (thus effectively the red card and substitution takes out two of the starting eleven players). They then play the remainder of the match with nine outfield players. If a team does not have a substitute goalkeeper, or they have already used all of their permitted substitutions for the match, an outfield player has to take the dismissed goalkeeper's place and wear the goalkeeper shirt.

The [[squad number (association football)|squad number]] for a first choice goalkeeper is generally number 1.&lt;ref name="sports.yahoo.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/soccer-dirty-tackle/mystery-solved--why-do-the-best-soccer-players-wear-no--10-052229677.html|title=Mystery solved: Why do the best soccer players wear No. 10?|publisher=Yahoo|author1=Khalil Garriot|date=21 June 2014|accessdate=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Footb incident painting.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A goalkeeper being charged by a rival player (1905).]]
Association football, like many sports, has experienced many changes in tactics resulting in the generation and elimination of different positions. Goalkeeper is the only position that is certain to have existed since the codification of the sport. Even in the early days of organised football, when systems were limited or non-existent and the main idea was for all players to attack and defend, teams had a designated member to play as the goalkeeper.

The earliest account of football teams with player positions comes from [[Richard Mulcaster]] in 1581 and does not specify goalkeepers. The earliest specific reference to keeping goal comes from [[Cornish Hurling]] in 1602. According to Carew: "they pitch two bushes in the ground, some eight or ten foot asunder; and directly against them, ten or twelve score off, other twayne in like distance, which they term their Goals. One of these is appointed by lots, to the one side, and the other to his adverse party. There is assigned for their guard, a couple of their best stopping Hurlers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/srvcr10.txt |title=The Survey of Cornwall by Richard Carew |date= |accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other references to scoring goals begin in English literature in the early 16th century; for example, in [[John Day (dramatist)|John Day]]'s play ''The Blind Beggar of [[Bethnal Green]]'' (performed circa 1600; published 1659): "I'll play a gole at [[camping (game)|camp-ball]]" (an extremely violent variety of football, popular in [[East Anglia]]). Similarly, in a 1613 poem, [[Michael Drayton]] refers to "when the Ball to throw, And drive it to the Gole, in squadrons forth they goe". It seems inevitable that wherever a game has evolved goals, some form of goalkeeping must also be developed. [[David Wedderburn (writer)|David Wedderburn]] refers to what has been translated from [[Latin]] as to "keep goal" in 1633, though this does not necessarily imply a fixed goalkeeper position.

The word "goal-keeper" is used in the novel ''[[Tom Brown's School Days]]'' (published in 1857, but set in the 1830s).  The author is here referring to an early form of [[rugby football]]: {{quote|You will see in the first place, that the sixth-form boy, who has the charge of goal, has spread his force (the goal-keepers) so as to occupy the whole space behind the goal-posts, at distances of about five yards apart; a safe and well-kept goal is the foundation of all good play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=112 |url=https://hdl.handle.net/2027/hvd.hwkq5n?urlappend=%3Bseq=126 |title=School Days at Rugby |author=An Old Boy [Thomas Hughes] |year=1857 |location=Boston |publisher=Ticknor and Fields}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The word "goal-keeper" appeared in the [[Sheffield Rules]] of 1867, but the term did not refer to a designated player, but rather to "that player on the defending side who for the time being is nearest to his own goal".  The goal-keeper, thus defined, did not enjoy any special handling privileges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource | author=Sheffield Football Association | authorlink=Sheffield Football Association | year=1867 | title=Sheffield Rules (March 1867) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FA's first Laws of the Game of 1863 did not make any special provision for a goalkeeper, with any player being allowed to catch or knock-on the ball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource | author=Football Association | authorlink=Football Association | year=1863 | title=Laws of the Game (1863) }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Handling the ball was completely forbidden (for all players) in 1870.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource | author=Football Association | authorlink=Football Association | year=1870 | title=Laws of the Game (1870) }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The next year, 1871, the laws were amended to introduce the goalkeeper and specify  that the keeper was allowed to handle the ball "for the protection of his goal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource | author=Football Association | authorlink=Football Association | year=1871 | title=Laws of the Game (1871) }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The restrictions on the ability of the goalkeeper to handle the ball were changed several times in subsequent revisions of the laws:

* 1871: the keeper may handle the ball only "for the protection of his goal".
* 1873: the keeper may not "carry" the ball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource | author=Football Association | authorlink=Football Association | year=1873 | title=Laws of the Game (1873) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1901: the keeper may handle the ball for any purpose (not only in defence of the goal).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource | author=International Football Association Board| authorlink=International Football Association Board | year=1901 | title=Laws of the Game (1901) }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1912: the keeper may handle the ball only in the penalty area.
* 1931: the keeper may take up to four steps (rather than two) while carrying the ball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Football |page=3 |work=Carluke &amp; Lanark Gazette |date=19 July 1931}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1992: the keeper may not handle the ball after it has been deliberately kicked to him/her by a team-mate.
* 1997: the keeper may not handle the ball for more than six seconds.

Initially, goalkeepers typically played between the goalposts and had limited mobility, except when trying to save opposition shots. Throughout the years, the role of the goalkeeper has evolved, due to the changes in systems of play, to become more active. The goalkeeper is the only player in association football allowed to use their hands to control the ball (other than during throw-ins).

Due to several time-wasting techniques which were used by goalkeepers, such as bouncing the ball on the ground or throwing it in the air and then catching it again, in the 1960s, the Laws of the game were revised further, and the goalkeeper was given a maximum of four steps to travel while holding, bouncing or throwing the ball in the air and catching it again, without having to release it into play. The FIFA Board later also devised an anti-parrying rule, saying that such deliberate parrying for the purpose of evading the Law was to be regarded also as holding the ball.&lt;ref name="Goalkeepers are not above the Law"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/news/y=1997/m=10/news=goalkeepers-are-not-above-the-law-72050.html|title=Goalkeepers are not above the Law|publisher=FIFA.com|date=31 October 1997|accessdate=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the [[International Football Association Board]] made changes in the laws of the game that affected goalkeepers – notably the [[back-pass rule]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/law/summary.html |title=From 1863 to the Present Day |publisher=FIFA.com |date= |accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which prohibits goalkeepers from handling the ball when receiving a deliberate pass from a teammate that is made with their feet. This rule change was made to discourage time-wasting and overly defensive play after the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] which was described as exceedingly dull, rife with back-passing and goalkeepers holding the ball. Also, goalkeepers would frequently drop the ball and dribble it around, only to pick it up again once opponents came closer to put them under pressure, a typical time-wasting technique. Therefore, another rule was introduced at the same time as the back-pass rule. This rule prohibits the goalkeeper from handling the ball again once he or she has released it for play; an offence results in an indirect free kick to the opposition. Furthermore any player negating the spirit of the new rule would be likely to be cautioned for unsporting behaviour and punished by an indirect free-kick.&lt;ref name="Goalkeepers are not above the Law"/&gt;

On 1 July 1997, FIFA decided to extend the back-pass rule by applying it also to throw-ins from [[Defender (association football)|defenders]] to their own goalkeeper; in order to prevent further time-wasting, FIFA also established that if a goalkeeper holds the ball for more than five or six seconds the referee must adjudge this as time-wasting and award an indirect free-kick to the opposing team.&lt;ref name="Goalkeepers are not above the Law"/&gt;

==Laws of the Game and general play ==
[[File:Suarez Ajax captain.jpg|thumb|right|222px|[[Maksym Koval]] closes down [[Luis Suárez]].]]
The position of goalkeeper is the only position in the game which is technically distinct from the others in the course of normal play. The [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]] distinguish the goalkeeper from the other players in several ways, most significantly exempting them from the prohibition on handling the ball, though only within their own penalty area.&lt;ref name="laws" /&gt; Once a goalkeeper has control of the ball in their hands, opponents are not permitted to challenge them.&lt;ref name="laws" /&gt; Goalkeepers have a specialised role as the sole defender in [[penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]]s and [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-outs]].&lt;ref name="laws" /&gt; Goalkeepers are required to wear distinct colours from other players, and are permitted to wear caps and tracksuit bottoms.&lt;ref name="laws"&gt;{{cite web|title=Laws|url=http://www.theifab.com/laws|website=International Football Association Board {{!}} IFAB|publisher=[[International Football Association Board]]|accessdate=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Laws mandate that one player on the team must be designated as the goalkeeper at all times, meaning that if a goalkeeper is [[Fouls_and_misconduct_(association_football)#Red_card_(removal)|sent off]] or injured and unable to continue another player must assume the goalkeeper position.&lt;ref name="laws" /&gt; The Laws allow for teams to change the player designated as goalkeeper at stoppages in play,&lt;ref name="laws" /&gt; but in practice this is rarely exercised.

The Laws place no restrictions on a goalkeeper leaving their penalty area and acting as an ordinary player, though generally goalkeepers stay close to their goal throughout the match. 

Goalkeepers routinely perform extension dives. To execute this, they push off the ground with the foot nearest to the ball, launching themselves into a horizontal position. At this point, the ball may be caught or parried away from the goal. In the latter case, a good goalkeeper will attempt to ensure that the rebound cannot be taken by a player of the opposing team, although this is not always possible.

==Responsibilities==
[[File:U20-WorldCup2007-Okotie-Onka edit2.jpg|thumb|A goalkeeper making a save]]
The tactical responsibilities of goalkeepers include:

* To '''keep goal''' by physically blocking attempted shots with any part of their body. The keeper is permitted to ''play'' the ball anywhere on the field, but may not ''handle'' the ball using hands or outstretched arms outside his/her penalty area.
* To organise the team's defenders during defensive set pieces such as free kicks and corners. In the case of free kicks, this includes picking the numbers and the organisation of a defensive man "wall". The wall serves to provide a physical barrier to the incoming ball, but some goalkeepers position their wall in a certain position to tempt the kick-taker to a certain type of shot. Occasionally, goalkeepers may opt to dispense with the wall. Some goalkeepers are also entrusted with the responsibility of picking markers while defending at set pieces.
* To '''pick out crosses and attempted long passes''' either by collecting them in flight or punching them clear if heavily challenged by opposing strikers.

Although goalkeepers have special privileges, including the ability to handle the ball in the penalty area, they are otherwise subject to the same rules as any other player.

Goalkeepers are not required to stay in the penalty area; they may get involved in play anywhere on the pitch, and it is common for them to act as an [[Defender (association football)#Sweeper (libero)|additional defender (or 'sweeper')]] during certain passages of the game. Goalkeepers with a long throwing range or accurate long-distance kicks may be able to quickly [[Playmaker#Playmaking in other positions|create]] attacking positions for a team and generate goal-scoring chances from defensive situations, a tactic known as the [[long ball]].

====Goalscorers====
[[File:Rogério Ceni.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Rogério Ceni]] is the highest-scoring goalkeeper of all time, with over 100 career goals.]]
Some [[List of goalscoring goalkeepers|goalkeepers have scored goals]]. Other than by accident when a long kicked clearance reaches the other end of the field and evades the opposing goalkeeper with the aid of strong winds and/or unexpected bounces, this most commonly occurs where a goalkeeper has rushed up to the opposite end of the pitch to give his team a numerical advantage in attack, leaving his own goal undefended. As such, it is normally only done late in a game at [[Set piece (football)|set-piece]]s where the consequences of scoring far outweigh those of conceding a further goal, such as for a team trailing in a knock-out tournament.

Some goalkeepers, such as Higuita, [[Rogério Ceni]], [[Hans-Jörg Butt]] and [[José Luis Chilavert]], are also expert set-piece takers. These players may take their team's attacking [[Direct free kick|free kicks]] or [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalties]]. Ceni, [[São Paulo FC|São Paulo]]'s long-time custodian, has scored 100 goals in his career, more than many outfield players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/33006305|title=Rogerio Ceni: Sao Paulo keeper into club record books|publisher=BBC|date=4 June 2015|accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fifa.com/newscentre/features/news/newsid=1306860/index.html "They said it: Jose Luis Chilavert"].

Goalkeepers must wear [[kit (association football)|kit]] that distinguishes them clearly from other players and match officials, as this is all that the FIFA [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]] require. Some goalkeepers have received recognition for their match attire, like [[Lev Yashin]] of the [[Soviet Union national football team|Soviet Union]], who was nicknamed the "Black Spider" for his distinctive all-black outfit;&lt;ref name="FIFA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/players/player=174638/|title="Yashin, the impregnable Spider".}} FIFA.

Most goalkeepers also wear [[Goalkeeper gloves|gloves]] to improve their grip on the ball, and to protect themselves from injury. Some gloves now include rigid plastic spines down each finger to help prevent injuries such as jammed, fractured, and [[sprain]]ed fingers. Though gloves are not mandatory attire, it is uncommon for goalkeepers to opt against them due to the advantages they offer. At [[UEFA Euro 2004]], [[Portugal national football team|Portuguese]] goalkeeper [[Ricardo (footballer, born 1976)|Ricardo]] famously took off his gloves during the quarter-final penalty shoot-out against [[England national football team|England]], knowing he was the next taker for his side. He then went on to save [[Darius Vassell]]'s penalty using his bare hands before scoring his own kick to win it for Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/euro_2004/3830451.stm Portugal break England hearts]; BBC Sport, 24 June 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Careers and injuries==
Goalkeepers often have longer playing careers than outfield players, many not retiring until their late thirties or early forties. This can be explained by noting that goalkeepers play a less physically demanding position that requires significantly less running. For example, Peter Shilton played for 31 years between 1966 and 1997 before retiring at the age of 47. Another explanation of this is that due to the nature of this position, goalkeepers use their experience more often than field players.

Lower and upper extremity injuries are very common and vary from [[Articular cartilage injuries|cartilage tears]], [[Anterior cruciate ligament injury|anterior cruciate ligaments (ACL)]], and [[Sprain#Joints involved|knee sprains]]. In general, goalkeepers can incur any injury that their outfield counterparts are also vulnerable to. The main exception to this guideline is that goalkeepers, as they run much less than outfield players, very rarely fall victim to fatigue-related injuries, such as [[Exercise-associated muscle cramps|leg cramps]], [[pulled hamstring]]s, and [[dehydration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burger|first1=Rob|last2=Fine|first2=Kenneth|title=Soccer Injuries|url=http://www.stopsportsinjuries.org/soccer-injury-prevention.aspx#common|website=Stop Sports Injuries|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gianluigi Buffon is also the only World Cup winning goalkeeper not to have conceded a goal in open play throughout the whole tournament (one goal coming from an own goal after a free-kick, and the second from a penalty). Fabien Barthez and [[Peter Shilton]] hold the [[FIFA World Cup records#Goalkeeping|record]] for most [[Shutout#Association football|clean sheet]]s in World Cup matches, with 10 clean sheets each.

Zuberbühler made Switzerland the only team in the history of the tournament not to concede a goal in normal time. [[Tim Howard]] holds the record for most saves made in a [[FIFA World Cup]] match, with 16 saves against [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] in the Round of 16 of the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]]. [[Oliver Kahn]] is the only goalkeeper to have won the [[Adidas Golden Ball]] for the best player of the tournament in a World Cup (in the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 competition]]); [[Lev Yashin]] is the only goalkeeper to have won the [[Ballon d'Or]]. [[Gianluca Pagliuca]] of [[Italy national football team|Italy]] became the first goalkeeper to be sent off in a World Cup Finals match, dismissed for handling outside his area against [[Norway national football team|Norway]] in [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]]. His team went on to win 1–0 and reached the [[1994 FIFA World Cup Final|final]] before losing to [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in a penalty shoot-out, in which he became the first goalkeeper ever to stop a penalty in a final shoot-out.

Iker Casillas holds both the record for fewest goals conceded in a European Championship (1, in [[UEFA Euro 2012|2012]]) and the record for longest unbeaten run at a European Championship, beating the previous record held by Dino Zoff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Javier Estepa|title=Casillas, world record-breaking goalkeeper|url=http://www.marca.com/2012/07/02/en/football/national_teams/1341180644.html|publisher=Marca|accessdate=1 June 2015|date=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also holds the records for most international clean sheets (102) by a male goalkeeper beating the previous record held by [[Edwin van der Sar]] (72), and became the first goalkeeper in history, male or female, to keep 100 clean sheets at international level in 2015; he also shares the overall record for the most international clean sheets along with the U.S. women's national team goalkeeper [[Hope Solo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.fifa.com/news/y=2012/m=5/news=international-feats-and-fitting-farewell-1641297.html|title=International feats and a fitting farewell|publisher=FIFA|accessdate=1 June 2015|date=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="100 clean sheets for Spain"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://as.com/diarioas/2015/11/13/english/1447451183_829981.html|title=Casillas into three figures – 100 clean sheets for Spain|publisher=as.com|date=13 November 2015|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buffon holds the record for most minutes without conceding a goal in [[UEFA European Championship qualifying|European Championship Qualifying matches]], going 644 minutes without conceding a goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Buffon, felice per il record di imbattibilità|url=http://www.ansa.it/web/notizie/rubriche/calcio/2011/09/07/visualizza_new.html_726941330.html|accessdate=19 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kenya national women's cricket team''' is the team that represents the country of [[Kenya]] in international [[women's cricket]]. Their first matches were in January 2006 when they played a triangular series against Kenya A and [[Ugandan women's cricket team|Uganda]].

They played in the African regional qualifiers for the 2009 [[Women's Cricket World Cup|World Cup]] in December 2006 against [[Tanzanian women's cricket team|Tanzania]], Uganda and [[Zimbabwean women's cricket team|Zimbabwe]]. They performed poorly in the tournament, finishing in last place. In December 2009,they won the Africa Women Championships under the captainship of [[Emily Ruto]].

In 2008, [[Sarah Bhakita]] scored unbeaten 186 against [[Rwanda]] to emerge the second woman in the world to achieve the feat in an international match. The Kenya Lwomen's Cricket team also participated in the World Cup Qualifiers held in [[Nairobi]] in December 2010, missing an opportunity to represent the continent by negligible scores, having tied with [[Zimbabwe]] at second place. [[South Africa]] who won all their matches and Zimbabwe achieved that feat instead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cricketeurope4.net/CRICKETEUROPE/DATABASE/2007/TOURNAMENTS/WWC/about.shtml African leg pf World Cup Qualifiers]&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, the women' team represented the country in [[Kampala]], [[Uganda]] at the annual [[Africa Cricket Championships]] finishing fourth after the winners [[Uganda]], [[Tanzania]] and [[Namibia]]. the other participating countries were [[Nigeria]] and [[Sierra Leone]].

In April 2016, they will play in [[2016 ICC Africa Women's World Twenty20]] to qualify for [[2018 ICC Women's World Twenty20]] in [[West Indies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chronicle.co.zw/zim-steps-up-preps-for-icc-africa-womens-world-t20/|title=Zim steps up preps for ICC Africa Women’s World T20 {{!}} The Chronicle|website=www.chronicle.co.zw|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thesportscampus.com/2016041451208/twenty-20/zimbabwe-step-up-preps-for-icc-africa-womens-world-twenty20-qualifier|title=Zimbabwe step up preps for ICC Africa Women’s World Twenty20 Qualifier {{!}} Twenty-20|last=Administrator|website=www.thesportscampus.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018, the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC) granted full [[Women's Twenty20 International]] (WT20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all [[Twenty20]] matches played between Kenya women and another international side after 1 July 2018 will be a full WT20I.&lt;ref name="status"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icc-cricket.com/media-releases/672322 |title=All T20I matches to get international status |work=International Cricket Council |accessdate=26 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Korea American Football Association''' ('''KAFA''', [[Korean language|Korean]]: 대한미식축구협회, [[Hanja]]: 大韓美式蹴球協會) has existed in [[South Korea]] for more than 20 years.  The popularity of [[American football]] in Korea has been historically low, but with the visit of [[Hines Ward]] (a Korean born NFL football star with the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]) in 2006, the sport received a modest level of increased appeal. Within Korea, KAFA is a [[sports governing body]] over both traditional football with pads and also [[flag football]].

Traditional football [[Sports league|leagues]] within Korea are divided between university and senior (KNFL) teams.  There are three championship bowl games of special note that occur at the end of the season. The Tiger Bowl determines the champions of the University league, the Gwangaeto Bowl determines the champions of the KNFL, and finally the [[Kimchi Bowl]], the Korean equivalent of Japan's [[Rice Bowl]], pits the University champion against the KNFL champion.

==KNFL==

In 2015, there were seven teams in the KNFL, divided into two divisions (북부리그 North Division, 남부리그 South Division).  The top two seeds of each division played in a four-team semifinal playoffs.  Winners of the semifinals played in the Gwanggaeto Bowl Championship.  The KNFL Champion played the Korean University League Champion in the Kimchee Bowl.

Starting in 2016, the KNFL has changed to a full league format.  Each of the seven teams play one another.  The two teams with the best regular season records face off in the Gwanggaeto Bowl. The KNFL Champion plays the Korean University League Champion in the Kimchi Bowl.

[[File:Neymar PSG.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Neymar]], currently the most expensive footballer]]
The following is a '''list of most expensive association football transfers''', which details the highest [[Transfer (association football)|transfer]] fees ever paid for [[Football player|players]]. 

As well as the most expensive transfers of all time, the page also lists transfers which broke the world transfer record. The first recorded record transfer was of [[Willie Groves]] from [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] for £100 in 1893. This occurred just eight years after the introduction of professionalism by [[The Football Association]] in 1885.&lt;ref name="GrovesIndy"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/aug/30/the-joy-of-six-record-transfers|title=The Joy of Six: record transfers|first1=Barry|last1=Glendenning|first2=Scott|last2=Murray|first3=Rob|last3=Bagchi|first4=Jacob|last4=Steinberg|date=30 August 2013|publisher=|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current transfer record was set by the transfer of [[Neymar]] from [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] to [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] for €222&amp;nbsp;million (£198 million) on 3 August 2017.&lt;ref name="Neymar BBC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Neymar: Paris St-Germain sign Barcelona forward for world record 222m euros|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40762417|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://www.fcbarcelona.com/football/first-team/news/2017-2018/fc-barcelona-communique-on-neymar-jr-buyout-clause|title= FC Barcelona communiqué on Neymar Jr |date=3 August 2017|access-date=3 August 2017|publisher=FC Barcelona}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TelegraphNeymar/&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardianNeymar/&gt;

== Highest fees ==
Most of the transfers on this list are to clubs under [[UEFA]]'s jurisdiction, and most of the purchasing clubs are from [[England]], [[France]], [[Italy]] and [[Spain]]. However, since the mid 2010s two [[China|Chinese]] clubs have paid large fees for three [[Brazil]]ian players.

Three players appear on the list twice: [[Neymar]], [[Ángel Di María]] and [[Cristiano Ronaldo]]. All of the players on the list are of European ([[UEFA]]), South American ([[CONMEBOL]]) and African ([[Confederation of African Football|CAF]]) origin. There are currently no players from the remaining regions - Asia ([[Asian Football Confederation|AFC]]), North America ([[CONCACAF]]) and Oceania ([[Oceania Football Confederation|OFC]]).

==World football transfer record==
{{Split section |Association football transfer world record progression|discuss=Talk:List of most expensive association football transfers#Undo ill-advised merge of record progression |date=October 2017}}
The first player to ever be transferred for a fee of over £100 was Scottish [[Forward (association football)|striker]] [[Willie Groves]] when he together with [[Jack Reynolds (footballer, born 1869)|Jack Reynolds]] (£50) made the switch from [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in [[1893 in association football|1893]],&lt;ref name="GrovesIndy"/&gt; eight years after the legalisation of professionalism in the sport. It took just twelve years for the figure to become £1000, when [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] striker [[Alf Common]] moved to [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Proud |first=Keith |url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/history/memories/teesside/3603267.The_player_with_the_Common_touch_/ |title=The player with the Common touch |publisher=The Northern Echo |date=18 August 2008 |accessdate=12 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BpztUQzs?url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/history/memories/teesside/3603267.The_player_with_the_Common_touch_/ |archivedate=1 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCRecords"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23560273 |title=World record football transfer fees |publisher=BBC |date=1 September 2013 |accessdate=12 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until [[1928 in association football|1928]] that the first five-figure transfer took place. [[David Jack]] of [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] was the subject of interest from [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], and in order to negotiate the fee down, Arsenal manager [[Herbert Chapman]] got the Bolton representatives [[drunk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/16066822 |title=Arsenal honour Thierry Henry, Tony Adams &amp; Herbert Chapman |publisher=BBC |date=7 December 2011 |accessdate=12 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="442Records"&gt;{{cite news |last=Flanagan |first=Chris |url=http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/how-13-other-world-record-transfers-panned-out |title=How 13 other world record transfers panned out |publisher=Four Four Two |date=4 September 2013 |accessdate=12 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, David Jack was transferred for a world record fee when Arsenal paid £10,890 to Bolton for his services, after Bolton had asked for £13,000, which was double the previous record made when Sunderland signed [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]]'s [[Bob Kelly (footballer)|Bob Kelly]] a fee of for £6,500.&lt;ref name="BBCRecords"/&gt;

The first player from outside [[Great Britain]] to break the record was [[Bernabé Ferreyra]], a player known as ''La Fiera'' for his powerful shot. His [[1932 in association football|1932]] transfer from [[Club Atlético Tigre|Tigre]] to [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]] cost £23k,&lt;ref name="442Records"/&gt; and the record would last for 17 years (the longest the record has lasted) until it was broken by Manchester United's sale of [[Johnny Morris (footballer)|Johnny Morris]] to [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] for £24k in March 1949. The record was broken seven further times between 1949 and 1961, when [[Luis Suárez Miramontes]] was sold by [[FC Barcelona]] to [[Inter Milan]] for £152k, becoming the first ever player sold for more than £100k.&lt;ref name="BBCRecords"/&gt;

In [[1968 in association football|1968]], [[Pietro Anastasi]] became the first £500k player when [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] purchased him from [[A.S. Varese 1910|Varese]],&lt;ref name="442Records"/&gt; which was followed seven years later with [[Giuseppe Savoldi]] becoming the first million pound player when he transferred from [[Bologna F.C. 1909|Bologna]] to [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]].&lt;ref name="BBCRecords"/&gt;&lt;ref name="442Records"/&gt;

After Alf Common and David Jack, the third player to twice be transferred for world record fees is [[Diego Maradona]].&lt;ref name="BBCRecords"/&gt;&lt;ref name="442Records"/&gt; His transfers from [[Boca Juniors]] to Barcelona for £3m, and then to Napoli for £5m, both broke the record in [[1982 in association football|1982]] and [[1984 in association football|1984]] respectively. The most recent is [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] with his record-breaking move from [[PSV Eindhoven]] to Barcelona in 1996 for £13.2m, although [[Alan Shearer]]'s transfer to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle]] broke the record the same summer. A year later [[Inter Milan]] paid £19.5m for Ronaldo and again he became the player with the highest transfer fee.

In the space of 61 days in [[1992 in association football|1992]],&lt;ref name="442Records"/&gt; three transfers broke the record,&lt;ref name="BBCRecords"/&gt; all by Italian clubs: [[Jean-Pierre Papin]] transferred from [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] to [[A.C. Milan]], becoming the first ever £10m player.&lt;ref name="442Records"/&gt; Almost immediately, rivals [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] topped that with the signing of [[Gianluca Vialli]] for a fee of £12m from [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]]. Milan then completed the signing of [[Gianluigi Lentini]] for a fee of £13m which stood as the record for three years.

The [[1996 in association football|1996]] transfer of [[Alan Shearer]] from [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], for a fee of £15m,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Turnbull |first1=Simon |last2=Nixon |first2=Alan |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/shearer-goes-home-for-pounds-15m-1331235.html |title=Shearer goes home for pounds 15m |publisher=The Independent |date=30 July 1996 |accessdate=12 January 2014 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; kickstarted a year-by-year succession of record breaking transfers: [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] moved [[1997 in association football|the following year]] to [[Inter Milan]] from [[FC Barcelona]] for a fee of £17m,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-ronaldo-signs-up-for-inter-1257195.html |title=Ronaldo signs up for Inter |publisher=The Independent |date=21 June 1997 |accessdate=12 January 2014 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was followed in [[1998 in association football|1998]] by the shock transfer of his fellow countryman [[Denílson de Oliveira Araújo|Denílson]] from [[São Paulo FC|São Paulo]] to [[Real Betis]] for a fee of approximately £21m.&lt;ref name="BBCRecords"/&gt;&lt;ref name="442Records"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/france-98-denilson-the-menacing-1163252.html |title=Denilson The Menacing |publisher=The Independent |date=7 June 1998 |accessdate=12 January 2014 |location=London |first=Andrew |last=Longmore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1999 in association football|1999]] and [[2000 in association football|2000]], Italian clubs returned to their record-breaking ways, with [[Christian Vieri]] transferring from [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] to [[Inter Milan]] for £28m,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Whyte |first=Derrick |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-inters-pounds-28m-swap-deal-for-lazios-vieri-1099122.html |title=Inter's pounds 28m swap deal for Lazio's Vieri |publisher=The Independent |date=9 June 1999 |accessdate=12 January 2014 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Hernán Crespo]]'s transfer from [[Parma F.C.|Parma]] to Lazio ensured he became the first player to cost more than £30m.&lt;ref name="BBCRecords"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Agnew |first=Paddy |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/jul/12/newsstory.sport |title=Crespo to join Lazio in record £36m transfer |publisher=The Guardian |date=12 July 2000 |accessdate=12 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transfer prompted the BBC to ask "has the world gone mad"?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/830192.stm |title=When transfers go mad |publisher=BBC |date=12 July 2000 |accessdate=12 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took two weeks for the record to be broken when [[Luís Figo]] made a controversial £37m move from Barcelona to rivals [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]].&lt;ref name="BBCRecords"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Figo37m"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/848836.stm |title=Figo's the Real deal |publisher=BBC|date=24 July 2000|accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, Real increased the record again with a signing of [[Zinedine Zidane]] for £48 million (150 billion lire).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ley|first1=John|title=Zidane in £48m Real deal|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/3008694/Zidane-in-48m-Real-deal.html|publisher=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=4 August 2017|date=9 July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zidane's record stood for 8 years, the longest since the 1940s. Real Madrid continued with the ''Galácticos'' policy by buying [[Kaká]] from [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] for €67&amp;nbsp;million (£56 million),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/european/5469863/Real-Madrid-to-confirm-world-record-56m-signing-of-Kaka.html|title = Real Madrid to confirm world record £56m signing of Kaka|date = 7 June 2009|accessdate = 13 February 2015|website = The Telegraph|publisher = |last = Wilson|first = Jeremy}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was the world record in pound sterling. However, both world record in euro and in pound sterling were broke by Real themselves when signing [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] for £80m (€94m) from [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in [[2009 in association football|the same transfer window]],&lt;ref name="BBCRecords"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ronaldo completes record Madrid switch|url=http://www.uefa.com/news/newsid=837497.html|publisher=UEFA|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 4 years later Real Madrid broke the record again after completed the signing of [[Gareth Bale]] from [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in [[2013 in association football|2013]]. Although Real initially insisted that the transfer cost €91.59 million, slightly less than the Ronaldo fee, the deal was widely reported to be around €100 million (around £85.1 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Just how much did Bale's transfer to Real Madrid cost?|url=http://www.itv.com/news/wales/2016-01-21/just-how-much-did-bales-transfer-to-real-madrid-cost/|publisher=ITV|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Conn|first1=David|title=Why Real Madrid think that even €100m for Gareth Bale is not silly money|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/sep/01/gareth-bale-100m-transfer-real-madrid|publisher=The Observer|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Documents leaked in 2016 by [[Football Leaks]] revealed that installments brought the final Bale fee up to a total of €100,759,418.&lt;ref name="BBCRecords"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Percy|first1=John|title=Gareth Bale contract leak sparks panic at Real Madrid|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2016/01/29/gareth-bale-contract-leak-sparks-panic-at-real-madrid/|publisher=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] eventually took the record away from Real Madrid, signing French midfielder [[Paul Pogba]] for €105 million (£89 million), &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paul Pogba: Manchester United re-sign France midfielder for world-record £89m|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37016170|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; four years after having released him to [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] for [[training compensation]].

A year after the Pogba transfer, however, there was a major jump in the record fee.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="54115">The '''Mesoamerican ballgame'''&lt;!--Other names and translations should be put in the Name section below.--&gt; was a [[sport]] with ritual associations played since 1400 BC&lt;ref name="See Hill 1998"&gt;See Hill, Blake and Clark (1998); Schuster (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[pre-Columbian]] people of [[Mesoamerica|Ancient Mesoamerica]]. The sport had different versions in different places during the millennia, and a newer more modern version of the game, ''[[Ulama (game)|ulama]]'', is still played in a few places by the [[Native Mexicans|indigenous population]].&lt;ref name="FOX"&gt;Fox, John. [https://books.google.com/books?id=LD6h3NHeHxgC&amp;printsec=frontcover ''The ball : discovering the object of the game"], 1st ed., New York : Harper, 2012. {{ISBN|9780061881794}}. Cf. Chapter 4: "Sudden Death in the New World" about the Ulama game.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rules of the game are not known, but judging from its descendant, [[Ulama (game)|ulama]], they were probably similar to [[racquetball]],&lt;ref name="Schwartz-2008"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schwartz|first1=Jeremy|title=Indigenous groups keep ancient sports alive in Mexico|url=http://www.statesman.com/news/content/news/stories/world/12/19/1219mexoldsports.html|accessdate=20 December 2008|work=Austin American-Statesman|date=19 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the aim is to keep the ball in play.  The stone ballcourt goals are a late addition to the game.

In the most common theory of the game, the players struck the ball with their hips, although some versions allowed the use of forearms, rackets, bats, or handstones.  The ball was made of solid [[rubber]] and weighed as much as 4&amp;nbsp;kg (9&amp;nbsp;lbs), and sizes differed greatly over time or according to the version played.

The game had important [[ritual]] aspects, and major formal ballgames were held as ritual events. Late in the history of the game, some cultures occasionally seem to have combined competitions with religious [[human sacrifice]]. The sport was also played casually for recreation by children and may have been played by women as well.&lt;ref&gt;The primary evidence for female ballplayers is in the many apparently female figurines of the Formative period, wearing a ballplayer loincloth and perhaps other gear. In ''The Sport of Life and Death'', editor Michael Whittington says: "It would [therefore] seem reasonable that women also played the game—perhaps in all-female teams—or participated in some yet to be understood ceremony enacted on the ballcourt." (p. 186).  In the same volume, Gillett Griffin states that although these figurines have been "interpreted by some as females, in the context of ancient Mesoamerican society the question of the presence of female ballplayers, and their role in the game, is still debated." (p. 158).&lt;/ref&gt;

Pre-Columbian [[Mesoamerican ballcourt|ballcourts]] have been found throughout Mesoamerica, as for example at [[Copán]], as far south as modern [[Nicaragua]], and possibly as far north as what is now the U.S. state of [[Arizona]].&lt;ref&gt;The evidence for ballcourts among the [[Hohokam]] is not accepted by all researchers and even the proponents admit that the proposed Hohokam ballcourts are significantly different from Mesoamerican ones: they are oblong, with a concave (not flat) surface.  See Wilcox's article and photo at end of this article.&lt;/ref&gt; These ballcourts vary considerably in size, but all have long narrow alleys with slanted side-walls against which the balls could bounce.

==Name==
The Mesoamerican ballgame is known by a wide variety of names. In English, it is often called pok-ta-pok (or pok-a-tok). This term originates from a 1932 article by Danish archaeologist [[Frans Blom]], who adapted it from the [[Yucatec Maya language|Yucatec Maya]] word ''pokolpok''.&lt;ref name="Dodson"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dodson|first1=Steve|title=POK-TA-POK|url=http://languagehat.com/pok-ta-pok/|website=Languagehat|accessdate=20 April 2017|date=8 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blom"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blom|first1=Frans|title=The Maya Ball-Game 'Pok-ta-pok,' called Tlachtli by the Aztecs|journal=Middle American Research Series Publications|publisher=Tulane University|date=1932|volume=4|pages=485–530}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Nahuatl]], the language of the Aztecs, it was called ''ōllamaliztli'' ({{IPA-nah|oːlːamaˈlistɬi|}}) or ''tlachtli'' ({{IPA-nah|ˈtɬatʃtɬi|}}).

==Origins==
[[Image:Early Mesoamerican Ballgame sites 1.svg|thumb|350px|right|Map showing sites where early ballcourts, balls, or figurines have been recovered]]
It is not known precisely when or where ōllamaliztli originated, although it is likely that the game originated earlier than 1400 BCE in the low-lying tropical zones home to the [[Castilla elastica|rubber tree]].&lt;ref&gt;There is wide agreement on game originating in the tropical lowlands, likely the Gulf Coast or Pacific Coast: see e.g. Shelton, p. 109-110.&lt;/ref&gt;

One candidate for the birthplace of the ballgame is the [[Soconusco]] coastal lowlands along the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;Taladoire (2001) pp. 107–108.&lt;/ref&gt;  Here, at [[Paso de la Amada]], archaeologists have found the oldest ballcourt yet discovered, dated to approximately 1400 BCE.&lt;ref name="See Hill 1998"/&gt;

The other major candidate is the [[Olmec heartland]], across the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]] along the [[Gulf Coast of Mexico|Gulf Coast]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller and Taube (1993, p.42)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Aztecs]] referred to their [[Mesoamerican chronology|Postclassic]] contemporaries who then inhabited the region as the ''Olmeca'' (i.e. "rubber people") since the region was strongly identified with [[latex]] production.&lt;ref&gt;These Gulf Coast inhabitants, the [[Olmeca-Xicalanca]], are not to be confused with the [[Olmec]], the name bestowed by 20th century archaeologists on the influential Gulf Coast civilization which had dominated that region three thousand years earlier.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest-known rubber balls come from the sacrificial bog at [[El Manatí]], an early Olmec-associated site located in the hinterland of the [[Coatzacoalcos River]] drainage system.  Villagers, and subsequently archaeologists, have recovered a dozen balls ranging in diameter from 10 to 22&amp;nbsp;cm from the freshwater spring there.  Five of these balls have been dated to the earliest-known occupational phase for the site, approximately 1700–1600 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Ortiz and Rodríguez (1999), pp. 228–232, 242–243.&lt;/ref&gt;  These rubber balls were found with other ritual offerings buried at the site, indicating that even at this early date ōllamaliztli had religious and ritual connotations.&lt;ref&gt;Diehl, p. 27.  See also Uriarte, p. 41, who finds that the juxtaposition at El Manatí of the deposited balls and serpentine staffs (which may have been used to strike the balls—see Ortíz C, 1992) shows that there was already a "well-developed ideological relationship between the [ball]game, power, and serpents."&lt;/ref&gt;  A stone "yoke" of the type frequently associated with Mesoamerican ballcourts was also reported to have been found by local villagers at the site, leaving open the distinct possibility that these rubber balls were related to the ritual ballgame, and not simply an independent form of sacrificial [[votive deposit|offering]].&lt;ref&gt;Ortíz and Rodríguez (1999, p.249); see also Ortiz, Rodríguez, and Delgado (1992) which investigates this relationship, as cited in the foregoing paper.&lt;/ref&gt;

Excavations at the nearby Olmec site of [[San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán]] have also uncovered a number of ballplayer figurines, [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon-dated]] as far back as 1250–1150 BCE.  A rudimentary ballcourt, dated to a later occupation at San Lorenzo, 600–400 BCE, has also been identified.&lt;ref&gt;Diehl, p. 32, although the identification of a ballcourt within San Lorenzo has not been universally accepted.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the tropical lowlands, ōllamaliztli apparently moved into central Mexico.  Starting around 1000 BCE or earlier, ballplayer figurines were interred with burials at [[Tlatilco]] and similarly styled figurines from the same period have been found at the nearby [[Tlapacoya (Mesoamerican site)|Tlapacoya]] site.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley &amp; Joralemon,&lt;/ref&gt;  It was about this period, as well, that the so-called [[Xochipala]]-style ballplayer figurines were crafted in [[Guerrero]].  Although no ballcourts of similar age have been found in Tlatilco or Tlapacoya, it is possible that the ballgame was indeed played in these areas, but on courts with perishable boundaries or temporary court markers.&lt;ref&gt;Ekholm, p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 300 BCE, evidence for ōllamaliztli appears throughout much of the Mesoamerican archaeological record, including ballcourts in the Central Chiapas Valley (the next oldest ballcourts discovered, after Paso de la Amada),&lt;ref&gt;Finca Acapulco, San Mateo, and El Vergel, along the Grijalva, have ballcourts dated between 900 and 550 BCE (Agrinier, p. 175).&lt;/ref&gt;  and in the [[Oaxaca Valley]], as well as ceramic ballgame tableaus from Western Mexico (see photo below

==Material and formal aspects==
[[File:Ulama 37 (Aguilar).jpg|right|thumb|upright|A modern [[Sinaloa]] [[Ulama (game)|ulama]] player. The outfit is similar to that worn by Aztec players.]]
As might be expected with a game played over such a long period of time by many cultures, details varied over time and place, so the Mesoamerican ballgame might be more accurately seen as a family of related games.

In general, the hip-ball version is most popularly thought of as ''the'' Mesoamerican ballgame,&lt;ref&gt;Orr, p. 749.&lt;/ref&gt; and researchers believe that this version was the primary—or perhaps only—version played within the [[masonry]] [[Mesoamerican ballcourt|ballcourt]].&lt;ref&gt;Cohodas.&lt;/ref&gt; Ample archaeological evidence exists for games where the ball was struck by a wooden stick (e.g., a mural at Teotihuacan shows a game which resembles [[field hockey]]), racquets, bats and batons, handstones, and the forearm, perhaps at times in combination. Each of the various types of games had its own size of ball, specialized gear and playing field, and rules.

Games were played between two teams of players. The number of players per team could vary, between two to four.&lt;ref&gt;The 16th century Aztec chronicler [[Toribio de Benavente Motolinia|Motolinia]] stated that the games were played by a two-man team vs. a two-man team, three-man team vs. a three-man team, and even a two-man team vs. a three-man team (quoted by Shelton, p. 107).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Seventy Great Inventions of the Ancient World by Brian M. Fagan reporting that four-man vs four-man team also existed&lt;/ref&gt; Some games were played on makeshift courts for simple recreation while others were formal spectacles on huge stone ballcourts leading to human sacrifice.

Even without human sacrifice, the game could be brutal and there were often serious injuries inflicted by the solid, heavy ball. Today's hip-''[[Ulama (game)|ulama]]'' players are "perpetually bruised"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calstatela.edu/academic/anthro/jbrady/ulama/photo3ab.htm Cal State L.A.]&lt;/ref&gt;  while nearly 500 years ago Spanish chronicler [[Diego Durán]] reported that some bruises were so severe that they had to be lanced open. He also reported that players were even killed when the ball "hit them in the mouth or the stomach or the intestines".&lt;ref&gt;Blanchard, p. 107, further citing Durán (1971:315–316).&lt;/ref&gt;

The rules of ōllamaliztli, regardless of the version, are not known in any detail. In modern-day ''[[ulama (game)|ulama]]'', the game resembles a netless [[volleyball]],&lt;ref&gt;Noble, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; with each team confined to one half of the court. In the most widespread version of ''ulama'', the ball is hit back and forth using only the hips until one team fails to return it or the ball leaves the court.

In the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Postclassic]] period, the Maya began placing vertical stone rings on each side of the court, the object being to pass the ball through one, an innovation that continued into the later [[Toltec]] and [[Aztec]] cultures.

In the 16th-century Aztec ballgame that the Spaniards witnessed, points were lost by a player who let the ball bounce more than twice before returning it to the other team, who let the ball go outside the boundaries of the court, or who tried and failed to pass the ball through one of the stone rings placed on each wall along the center line.&lt;ref&gt;Day, p. 66, who further references [[Diego Durán]] and [[Bernardino de Sahagún]].&lt;/ref&gt;  According to 16th-century Aztec chronicler [[Toribio de Benavente Motolinia|Motolinia]], points were gained if the ball hit the opposite end wall, while the decisive victory was reserved for the team that put the ball through a ring.&lt;ref&gt;Shelton, p. 107-108, who quotes Motolinia.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, placing the ball through the ring was a rare event—the rings at Chichen Itza, for example, were set six meters off the playing field—and most games were likely won on points.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clothing and gear===

The game's paraphernalia—clothing, headdresses, gloves, all but the stone—are long gone, so knowledge on clothing relies on art—paintings and drawings, stone reliefs, and figurines—to provide evidence for pre-Columbian ballplayer clothing and gear, which varied considerably in type and quantity. Capes and masks, for example, are shown on several [[Dainzú]] [[relief]]s, while Teotihuacan murals show men playing stick-ball in skirts.&lt;ref&gt;Taladoire, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic hip-game outfit consisted of a [[loincloth]], sometimes augmented with leather hip guards. Loincloths are found on the earliest ballplayer figurines from Tlatilco, Tlapacoya, and the Olmec culture, are seen in the Weiditz drawing from 1528 (below), and, with hip guards, are the sole outfit of modern-day ''[[ulama (game)|ulama]]'' players (above)—a span of nearly 3000 years.

In many cultures, further protection was provided by a thick [[girdle]], most likely of wicker or wood covered in fabric or leather.  Made of perishable materials, none of these girdles have survived, although many stone "yokes" have been uncovered. Misnamed by earlier archaeologists due to its resemblance to an [[yoke|animal yoke]], the stone yoke is thought to be too heavy for actual play and was likely used only before or after the game in ritual contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to providing some protection from the ball, the girdle or yoke would also have helped propel the ball with more force than the hip alone.  Additionally, some players wore chest protectors called ''palmas'' which were inserted into the yoke and stood upright in front of the chest.

Kneepads are seen on a variety of players from many areas and eras and are worn by forearm-''ulama'' players today. A type of [[Garter (stockings)|garter]] is also often seen, worn just below the knee or around the ankle—it is not known what function this served. Gloves appear on the purported ballplayer [[relief]]s of Dainzú, roughly 500 BCE, as well as the Aztec players drawn by Weiditz 2000 years later (see drawing below).&lt;ref&gt;Dainzu gloves are discussed in Taladoire, 2003. See also Blanchard, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;  Helmets (likely utilitarian) and elaborate headdresses (likely used only in ritual contexts) are also common in ballplayer depictions, headdresses being particularly prevalent on Maya painted vases or on [[Jaina Island]] figurines. Many ballplayers of the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic era]] are seen with a right kneepad—no left—and a wrapped right forearm, as shown in the Maya image above.

=== Rubber balls ===
[[Image:Xiuhtecuhtli, Codex Borgia, 14, w rubber balls offering.jpg|right|thumb|In this detail from the late 15th century [[Codex Borgia]], the Aztec god [[Xiuhtecuhtli]] brings a rubber ball offering to a temple. The balls each hold a [[quetzal]] feather, part of the offering.]]
{{Main|Mesoamerican rubber balls}}
The sizes or weights of the balls actually used in the ballgame are not known with any certainty. While several dozen ancient balls have been recovered, they were originally laid down as offerings in a sacrificial bog or spring, and there is no evidence that any of these were used in the ballgame.  In fact, some of these extant [[Votive deposit|votive balls]] were created specifically ''as'' offerings.&lt;ref&gt;Filloy Nadal, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, based on a review of modern-day game balls, ancient rubber balls, and other archaeological evidence, it is presumed by most researchers that the ancient hip-ball was made of a mix from one or another of the latex-producing plants found all the way from the southeastern rain forests to the northern desert.&lt;ref&gt;Filloy Nadal 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Most balls were made from latex sap of the lowland ''[[Castilla elastica]]'' tree. Someone discovered that by mixing latex with sap from the vine of a species of morning glory (''[[Calonyction aculeatum]]'') they could turn the slippery polymers in raw latex into a resilient rubber. The size varied between {{convert|10|and|12|in|cm|abbr=on}} (measured in hand spans) and weighed {{convert|3|to|6|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz states that the ball used by present-day players is {{convert|8|lb}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ball used in the ancient handball or stick-ball game was probably slightly larger and heavier than a modern-day baseball.&lt;ref&gt;Filloy Nadal, page 30 as well as Leyenaar (2001) pp. 125–126.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Maya depictions, such as the painting above or [[:Image:Staircase Riser, Maya, ballgame.jpg|this relief]], show balls {{convert|1|m|abbr=on}} or more in diameter. Academic consensus is that these depictions are exaggerations or symbolic, as are, for example, the impossibly unwieldy headdresses worn in the same portrayals.&lt;ref&gt;Coe et al., p. 109 or Cohodas, p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ballcourt ===
{{Main|Mesoamerican ballcourt}}
[[Image:Uaxactunballcourt.jpg|thumb|left|Ballcourt at [[Uaxactun]], in the [[Petén Basin]] region of the Maya lowlands]]
Ōllamaliztli was played within a large [[masonry]] structure.  Built in a form that changed remarkably little during 2700 years, over 1300 Mesoamerican ballcourts have been identified, 60% in the last 20 years alone.&lt;ref&gt;Taladoire (2001) p. 98.  Note that there are slightly over 200 ballcourts also identified in the [[American Southwest]] which are ''not'' included in this total, since these are outside Mesoamerica and there is significant discussion whether these areas were used for ballplaying or not.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although there is a tremendous variation in size, in general all ballcourts have the same shape: a long narrow playing alley flanked by walls with both horizontal and sloping (or, more rarely, vertical) surfaces.  The walls were often plastered and brightly painted.  Although the alleys in early ballcourts were open-ended, later ballcourts had enclosed end-zones, giving the structure an [[Image:I, heavily serifed.png|10px]]-shape when viewed from above.
Although the length-to-width ratio remained relatively constant at 4-to-1,&lt;ref&gt;Quirarte, p.209-210.&lt;/ref&gt; there was nonetheless tremendous variation in ballcourt size.  The playing field of the Great Ballcourt at Chichen Itza, by far the largest, measures 96.5 meters long by 30 meters wide, while the Ceremonial Court at [[Tikal]] was only 16 meters by 5 meters.&lt;ref&gt;Taladoire (2001) p. 100.  Note that Taladoire is measuring the "playing field", while other authors include the benches and other trappings (e.g. see Quirarte, pp. 205–208).  It is thought that neither the Great Ballcourt nor Tikal's Ceremonial Court were used for ballgames (Scarborough, p. 137).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Mesoamerican Ballcourt cross-sections 3.svg|thumb|right|Cross sections of some of the more typical ballcourts]]
Across Mesoamerica, ballcourts were built and used for many generations.  Although ballcourts are found within most sizable Mesoamerican ruins, they are not equally distributed across time or geography. For example, the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Classic]] site of [[El Tajín]], the largest city of the ballgame-obsessed [[Classic Veracruz culture]], has at least 18 ballcourts, while [[Cantona (archaeological site)|Cantona]], a nearby contemporaneous site, sets the record with 24.&lt;ref&gt;Day, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, northern [[Chiapas]]&lt;ref&gt;Taladoire and Colsenet.&lt;/ref&gt; and the northern Maya Lowlands&lt;ref&gt;Kurjack, Maldonado C., Robertson.&lt;/ref&gt; have relatively few, and ballcourts are conspicuously absent at some major sites, including [[Teotihuacan]], [[Bonampak]], and [[Tortuguero (Maya site)|Tortuguero]], although ōllamaliztli iconography has been found there.&lt;ref&gt;Taladoire (2001) p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient cities with particularly fine ballcourts in good condition include [[Tikal]], [[Yaxha]], [[Copán]], [[Coba]], [[Iximche]], [[Monte Albán]], [[Uxmal]], [[Chichen Itza]], [[Yagul]], [[Xochicalco]], [[Mixco Viejo]], and [[Zaculeu]].

Ballcourts were public spaces used for a variety of elite cultural events and ritual activities like musical performances and festivals, and, of course, the ballgame.  Pictorial depictions often show musicians playing at ballgames, while [[votive deposit]]s buried at the Main Ballcourt at [[Tenochtitlan]] contained miniature whistles, [[ocarina]]s, and [[Teponaztli|drums]].   A pre-Columbian ceramic from western Mexico shows what appears to be a wrestling match taking place on a ballcourt.&lt;ref&gt;Day, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural aspects==

===Proxy for warfare===
[[File:El Baúl Ballgame Stela.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Stela from [[El Baúl]] in the [[Cotzumalhuapa]] Nuclear Zone, showing two ballplayers.]]
Ōllamaliztli was a ritual deeply ingrained in Mesoamerican cultures and served purposes beyond that of a mere sporting event.  [[Fray Juan de Torquemada]], a 16th-century Spanish missionary and historian, tells that the Aztec emperor [[Axayacatl]] played [[Xihuitlemoc]], the leader of [[Xochimilco#Precolonial|Xochimilco]], wagering his annual income against several Xochimilco [[chinampas]].&lt;ref&gt;Taladoire (2001) p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Fernando de Alva Cortés Ixtlilxochitl|Ixtlilxochitl]], a contemporary of Torquemada, relates that [[Ce Acatl Topiltzin|Topiltzin]], the [[Toltec]] king, played against three rivals, with the winner ruling over the losers.&lt;ref&gt;Related by Santley, et al., p. 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

These examples and others are cited by many researchers who have made compelling arguments that ōllamaliztli served as a way to defuse or resolve conflicts without genuine warfare, to settle disputes through a ballgame instead of a battle.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Taladoire and Colsenet ("We suggest that the ballgame was used as a substitute and a symbol for war.", p. 174), Fox, or Gillespie, who says that the ballgame was "a boundary maintenance mechanism between polities" (p. 340).&lt;/ref&gt;  Over time, then, the ballgame's role would expand to include not only external mediation, but also the resolution of competition and conflict within the society as well.&lt;ref&gt;Kowalewski, et al.,  p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

This "boundary maintenance" or "conflict resolution" theory would also account for some of the irregular distribution of ballcourts.  Overall, there appears to be a negative correlation between the degree of political centralization and the number of ballcourts at a site.&lt;ref&gt;Santley et al., p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the [[Aztec]] Empire, with a strong centralized [[Sovereign state|state]] and few external rivals, had relatively few ballcourts while [[Mesoamerican chronology|Middle Classic]] [[Cantona (Mesoamerican site)|Cantona]], with 24 ballcourts, had many diverse cultures residing there under a relatively weak state.&lt;ref&gt;Day, p. 76, and Taladoire (2001) p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars support these arguments by pointing to the warfare imagery often found at ballcourts:

*The southeast panel of the South Ballcourt at El Tajín shows the protagonist ballplayer being dressed in a warrior's garb.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkerson, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Captives are a prominent part of ballgame iconography.  For example:
:::Several ceramic figurines show war captives holding game balls.
:::The ballcourt at [[Toniná]] was decorated with sculptures of bound captives.
:::A captive-within-the-ball motif is seen on the Hieroglyphic Stairs at Structure 33 in [[Yaxchilan]] and on Altar 8 at [[Tikal]].
*The modern-day descendent of the ballgame, ''ulama'', "until quite recently was connected with warfare and many reminders of that association remain".&lt;ref&gt;[[California State University, Los Angeles]], Department of Anthropology, [http://www.calstatela.edu/academic/anthro/jbrady/ulama/photohi.htm].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human sacrifice===
[[File:Panel9SBCTajin.JPG|thumb|One of a series of murals from the South Ballcourt at El Tajín, showing the sacrifice of a ballplayer]]
The association between human sacrifice and the ballgame appears rather late in the archaeological record, no earlier than the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic era]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Kubler, p. 147 or Miller.&lt;/ref&gt;  The association was particularly strong within the [[Classic Veracruz culture|Classic Veracruz]] and the Maya cultures, where the most explicit depictions of human sacrifice can be seen on the ballcourt panels—for example at El Tajín (850–1100 CE)&lt;ref&gt;Maria Uriarte, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; and at Chichen Itza (900–1200 CE)—as well as on the well-known [[:Image:Jugador de pelota decapitado. Museo de Jalapa. México.jpg|decapitated ballplayer stelae]] from the Classic Veracruz site of Aparicio (700–900 CE).  The Postclassic Maya religious and quasi-historical narrative, the [[Popol Vuh]], also links human sacrifice with the ballgame (see below).

Captives were often shown in [[Ancient Maya art|Maya art]], and it is assumed that these captives were sacrificed after losing a rigged ritual ballgame.&lt;ref&gt;Among other sources, see Schele and Miller, who say "It would not be surprising if the game were rigged", p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rather than nearly nude and sometimes battered captives, however, the ballcourts at El Tajín and Chichen Itza show the sacrifice of practiced ballplayers, perhaps the captain of a team.&lt;ref&gt;Cohodas, p. 255, or Gillespie, p. 321.&lt;/ref&gt;  Decapitation is particularly associated with the ballgame—severed heads are featured in much Late Classic ballgame art and appear repeatedly in the [[Popol Vuh]].  There has even been speculation that the heads and skulls were used as balls.&lt;ref&gt;Schele and Miller, who states that "occasionally [sacrificial victims'] decapitated heads (sic) were placed in play", p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbolism===
Little is known about the game's symbolic contents. Several themes recur in scholarly writing.
*Astronomy. The [[bouncing ball]] is thought to have represented the sun.&lt;ref&gt;The ball-as-sun analogy is common in ballgame literature; see, among others, Gillespie, or Blanchard. Some researchers contend that the ball represents not the sun, but the moon.&lt;/ref&gt; The stone scoring rings are speculated to signify sunrise and sunset, or equinoxes.
*War. This is the most obvious symbolic aspect of the game (see also above, "Proxy for warfare"). Among the Mayas, the ball can represent the vanquished enemy, both in the late-Postclassic K'iche' kingdom (Popol Vuh), and in Classic kingdoms such as that of Yaxchilan.
*Fertility. Formative period ballplayer figurines—most likely females—often wear [[maize]] icons.&lt;ref&gt;See Bradley, who finds that a raised circular dot, or a U-shaped symbol with a dot in the middle, or raised U- or V-shaped areas each represent maize.&lt;/ref&gt;  At El Tajín, the ballplayer sacrifice ensures the renewal of [[pulque]], an alcoholic [[Agave americana|maguey]] [[cactus]] beverage.
*Cosmologic duality. The game is seen as a struggle between day and night,&lt;ref&gt;Cohodas, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt; and/or a battle between life and the underworld.&lt;ref&gt;Taladoire and Closenet, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; Courts were considered portals to the underworld and were built in key locations within the central ceremonial precincts. Playing ball engaged one in the maintenance of the cosmic order of the universe and the ritual regeneration of life.

===Myth===

====Nahua====
According to an important [[Nahuan languages|Nahua]] source, the Leyenda de los Soles,&lt;ref&gt;Velázquez 1975: 126&lt;/ref&gt; the Toltec king Huemac played ball against the [[Tlaloc]]s, with precious stones and quetzal feathers at stake. Huemac won the game. When instead of precious stones and feathers, the rain deities offered Huemac their young maize ears and maize leaves, Huemac refused. As a consequence of this vanity, the Toltecs suffered a four-year drought. The same ball game match, with its unfortunate aftermath, signified the beginning of the end of the Toltec reign.

====Maya====
[[File:Pelotaspieler 1.jpg|left|thumb|Ballcourt marker, from the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] site of [[Chinkultic]], dated to 591.  The ball itself displays the finely incised portrait of a young deity.]]
The [[Maya Hero Twins|Maya Twin myth]] of the [[Popol Vuh]] establishes the importance of the game (referred to in Classic Maya as ''pitz'') as a symbol for warfare intimately connected to the themes of fertility and death. The story begins with the Hero Twins' father, [[Hun Hunahpu]], and uncle, Vucub Hunahpu, playing ball near the underworld, [[Xibalba]].&lt;ref&gt;These excerpts from the Popol Vuh can be found in Christenson's recent translation or in any work on the Popol Vuh.&lt;/ref&gt;  The lords of the underworld became annoyed with the noise from the ball playing and so the primary lords of Xibalba, One Death and Seven Death, sent owls to lure the brothers to the ballcourt of Xibalba, situated on the western edge of the underworld. Despite the danger the brothers fall asleep and are captured and sacrificed by the lords of Xibalba and then buried in the ballcourt. Hun Hunahpu is decapitated and his head hung in a fruit tree, which bears the first [[calabash]] [[gourd]]s. Hun Hunahpu's head spits into the hands of a passing goddess who conceives and bears the Hero Twins, Hunahpu and Xbalanque. The Hero Twins eventually find the ballgame equipment in their father’s house and start playing, again to the annoyance of the Lords of Xibalba, who summon the twins to play the ballgame amidst trials and dangers. In one notable episode, Hunahpu is decapitated by bats. His brother uses a squash as Hunahpu's substitute head until his real one, now used as a ball by the Lords, can be retrieved and placed back on Hunahpu's shoulders. The twins eventually go on to play the ballgame with the Lords of Xibalba, defeating them. However, the twins are unsuccessful in reviving their father, so they leave him buried in the ball court of Xibalba.

==The ballgame in Mesoamerican civilizations==

=== Maya civilization ===
[[File:GreatBallCourt-interior.jpg|thumb|Great Ballcourt at [[Chichen Itza]]]]

In [[Maya Ballgame]] the [[Maya Hero Twins|Hero Twins]] myth links ballcourts with death and its overcoming. The ballcourt becomes a place of transition, a liminal stage between life and death. The ballcourt markers along the centerline of the Classic playing field depicted ritual and mythical scenes of the ballgame, often bordered by a [[quatrefoil]] that marked a portal into another world. The Twins themselves, however, are usually absent from Classic ballgame scenes, with the [[Vucub Caquix]] of the [[Copán]] ball court babe, holding the severed arm of Hunahpu, as an important exception.&lt;ref&gt;Chinchilla Mazariegos 2011: 114–118&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teotihuacan===
No ballcourt has yet been identified at [[Teotihuacan]], making it by far the largest Classic era site without one.  In fact, the ballgame seems to have been nearly forsaken not only in Teotihuacan, but in areas such as [[Matacapan]] or [[Tikal]] that were under Teotihuacano influence.&lt;ref&gt;Taladoire (2001) p. 109, who states that Matacapan and Tikal did indeed build ballcourts but only after the fall of Teotihuacan.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the lack of a ballcourt, ball games were not unknown there.  The murals of the [[Tepantitla]] compound at Teotihuacan show a number of small scenes that seem to portray various types of ball games, including:
*A two-player game in an open-ended masonry ballcourt.&lt;ref name="Taladoire 2001 p. 112"&gt;Taladoire (2001) p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; (See third picture below.)
*Teams using sticks on an open field whose end zones are marked by stone monuments.&lt;ref name="Taladoire 2001 p. 112"/&gt;
*Separate renditions of single players. (See side pictures above.)

It has been hypothesized that, for reasons as yet unknown, the stick-game eclipsed the hip-ball game at Teotihuacan and at Teotihuacan-influenced cities, and only after the fall of Teotihuacan did the hip-game reassert itself.&lt;ref&gt;Taladoire (2001) p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Aztec===
[[File:Codex-borgia-tlachtli.png|right|thumb|An I-shaped ballcourt with players and balls depicted in the [[Codex Borgia]] Folio 45.  Note that the four players are all holding batons, perhaps indicating that they are playing a type of racquet- or stick-ball.]]
The Aztec version of the ballgame is called ''ōllamalitzli'' (sometimes spelled ''ullamaliztli'')&lt;ref&gt;The Nahuatl word for the game, ''ōllamaliztli'' ({{IPA-nah|oːllamaˈlistɬi|}}) was often spelled ''ullamaliztli''—the orthography with "u" is a misrendering of the Náhuatl word caused by the fact that the quality of the nahuatl vowel /ō/ sounds a little like Spanish /u/.&lt;/ref&gt; and are derived from the word ''ōlli'' "rubber" and the verb ''ōllama'' or "to play ball".  The ball itself was called ''ōllamaloni'' and the ballcourt was called a ''tlachtli'' {{IPA-nah|ˈtɬatʃtɬi|}}.&lt;ref&gt;The name of the present day city of [[Taxco]], [[Guerrero]], comes from the Nahuatl word ''tlachcho'' meaning "in the ballcourt".&lt;/ref&gt; In the Aztec capital [[Tenochtitlan]] the largest ballcourt was called ''Teotlachco'' ("in the holy ballcourt")—here several important rituals would take place on the festivals of the month [[Panquetzalitzli]], including the [[Human sacrifice in Aztec culture|sacrifice]] of four war captives to the honor of [[Huitzilopochtli]] and his herald [[PaInal]].

For the Aztecs the playing of the ballgame also had religious significance, but where the 16th-century K´iche´ Maya saw the game as a battle between the lords of the underworld and their earthly adversaries, their Aztec contemporaries may have seen it as a battle of the sun, personified by [[Huitzilopochtli]], against the forces of night, led by the moon and the stars, and represented by the goddess [[Coyolxauhqui]] and [[Coatlicue]]'s sons the [[Centzonuitznaua|400 Huitznahuah]].&lt;ref&gt;De La Garza &amp; Izquierdo (1980) p.315.&lt;/ref&gt; But apart from holding important ritual and mythical meaning, the ballgame for the Aztecs was a sport and a pastime played for fun, although in general the Aztec game was a prerogative of the nobles.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkerson, p. 45 and others, although there is by no means a universal view: Santley et al. say "The game was played by nearly all adolescent and adult males, noble and commoner alike." (p. 8)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Weiditz Trachtenbuch 010-011.jpg|left|thumb|220x220px|Aztec ullamaliztli players performing for Charles V in Spain, drawn by Christoph Weiditz in 1528.]]
Young Aztecs would be taught ballplaying in the [[calmecac]] school—and those who were most proficient might become so famous that they could play professionally. Games would frequently be staged in the different city wards and markets—often accompanied by large-scale betting. [[Diego Durán]], an early Spanish chronicler, said that "these wretches...  sold their children in order to bet and even staked themselves and became slaves".&lt;ref&gt;Duran is quoted in Smith (2003), p. 233.  [[Toribio de Benavente Motolinia|Motolinia]], another early Spanish chronicler, also mentioned the heavy betting that accompanied games (Motolinia, p. 320).&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the rubber tree ''[[Castilla elastica]]'' was not found in the highlands of the Aztec Empire, the Aztecs generally received balls and rubber as tribute from the lowland areas where it was grown. The ''[[Codex Mendoza]]'' gives a figure of 16,000 lumps of raw rubber being imported to Tenochtitlan from the southern provinces every six months, although not all of it was used for making balls.

In 1528, soon after the [[Spanish conquest of Mexico|Spanish conquest]], [[Hernán Cortés|Cortés]] sent a troupe of ''ōllamanime'' (ballplayers) to Spain to perform for [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] where they were drawn by the German Christoph Weiditz.&lt;ref&gt;De La Garza &amp; Izquierdo (1980) p.325.&lt;/ref&gt;  Besides the fascination with their exotic visitors, the Europeans were amazed by the bouncing rubber balls.

===Pacific coast===
Ballcourts, monuments with ballgame imagery and ballgame paraphernalia have been excavated at sites along the Pacific coast of Guatemala and El Salvador including the [[Cotzumalhuapa]] nuclear zone sites of [[Bilbao (Mesoamerican site)|Bilbao]] and [[El Baúl]] and sites right at the southeast periphery of the Mesoamerican region such as [[Quelepa]].&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 1996, pp.221, 226. Andrews 1976, 1986, pp. 225–228.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Caribbean===
{{Main|Batey (game)}}
Batey, a ball game played on many Caribbean islands including [[Cuba]], [[Puerto Rico]], and the [[West Indies]], has been proposed as a descendent of the Mesoamerican ballgame, perhaps through the Maya.&lt;ref&gt;Alegria.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Misogyny in sports''' refers to different discourses, actions and [[ideologies]] present in various sporting environments that add, reinforce, or normalize the [[objectification]], degrading, [[shaming]], or absence of women. It can range from limiting women's participation to informal reinforcement of the men's status, by comparing it to that of a woman.  Misogyny within sports can also include unfair wages, as well as reduced coverage in sports media.  Because sports are so popular in today's society, they can be seen as a microcosm for the way people view their culture.

== Misogyny ==
Traditionally, the views of women's involvement in sports has led many to believe that they are absent from inclusion altogether. For much of history, most of the discussion around women and sports was centered around health risks for upper-class, white women, while excluding those of non-white or homosexual orientation.&lt;ref name="DD"&gt;Daniels, Dayna B.

Women's participation in various sports, such as [[boxing]] or [[rugby union]], has grown in recent years. However, there is still an undertone that they don't belong, by calling into question their sexuality or [[femininity]].&lt;ref name="DD" /&gt; A 1993 study conducted by [[Michael Messner]] found that women were described using words like "girls" and "young women", while men were described using words like "young man" and "men" but never as "boys." The same study found also found instances of women's successes and failures being described as "her little jump hook", adding to the notion that women are less talented or skilled than their male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;Messner, Michael.

Recent examples of [[Athletes and domestic violence|domestic violence against women in various sports]] have highlighted the deeply rooted [[misogyny]] present in most sports. Similarly, the masculinity that is involved in many sporting activities allow men to assume that they have "the right to vent their anger on the bodies of women and to discriminate against women in a number of different ways, including sexualizing and marginalizing them" says Kath Woodward, Professor of Sociology at the Open University.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, Kath.

Many of the messages that are delivered to male sports participants are about being tougher than your opponent, and the toughest one wins. The worst thing to be called or compared to in sports is a woman, and the quickest way to cut someone down. Coaches and pop culture constantly deliver messages that emphasize hyper-masculinity. However, all too often the societal frame of being a man is one that undermines women. These behaviors are seen as normal in the male-dominated sports world.&lt;ref&gt;Fagan, Kate.

The sexism experienced by women in sports also tends to be more overt, and less subtle, than sexism in other work and organizational settings. Sexist remarks made in many workplaces have been discouraged by displays of social disapproval and the potential threat of organizational reprimand. This has forced misogynistic views to be more subtle in these settings, taking the form of [[microaggressions]] or remarks in the form of [[benevolent sexism]]. In the sports industry, in comparison, overt sexist remarks are still commonplace and tend to result in less public backlash than similar statements given in other settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fink|first=Janet|date=Jan 2016|title=Hiding in Plain Sight: The Embedded Nature of Sexism in Sport|url=|journal=Journal of Sport Management|volume=30|issue=1|pages=1–7|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female athletes do not receive more attention or opportunities as compared to their male counterparts. Misogyny in sports make many people perceive women as weaklings in sporting activities. Recently, the number of females in sports has increased but not in the same percentage with that of males. For example, only fewer women participate in games such as rugby and boxing. In 2015, Don McPherson, a former National Football League (NFL) quarterback, argued that in sports boys are raised not only to be men but also not to be women (California Institute of Integral Studies). In other words, he meant that coaches ensure that young males gain enough strength to face their opponents and discourage these players to fear, which is a character associated with femininity. In sporting activities, to be masculine means to possess skills, energy, and toughness to become the victor in many tournaments. Misogyny in sports is a significant factor that contributes to shaming, objectifying, and degrading women regardless of their performance on the playing field.

===Coverage in media===
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2018}}{{Original research section|date=June 2018}}

Misogyny refers to hatred or prejudice towards women. It is manifested in several ways, such as hostility, sex discrimination, and social exclusion. Despite the popularity of sports in many societies in the world, misogyny is still prevalent in sports. In recent times, media coverage has increased the popularity of sports, but women's sports still suffers. It would be expected that both men's and women's sports are equally promoted on the media, such as television, radio and print media. Unfortunately, the coverage of women sports remains lower and shows no signs improvement; hence misogyny in media coverage of women's sports is confirmed.

There is little improvement in the coverage of women's sports by the media.  The Women's Sports and Fitness Foundation reports that only 7% percent of media coverage is devoted to women's sport. This is discouraging based on findings that over 60% of sports fans would like to watch women's sport on television. Discouragingly, the media coverage of these sports is dominated by terms, such as older, pregnant, married and unmarried thus shifting the attention from sports. In the same regard, Kelly (1) reports that men are three times likely to be mentioned in sports media than women, in a language that focuses on the sporting aspect and not the aesthetic aspects.

The efforts to popularize women sports through media coverage dependents on the online presence of broadcasters on social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter. However, Hull (4) reports that little efforts are being undertaken in respect to the same. A sampling of an estimated twenty thousand tweets involving two hundred broadcasters of local sports in the United States of America showed that only 5% of the tweets were related to women's sports (Hull 5). Besides, the study revealed worrying findings that female sports broadcasters tweeted more on men's sports than women's. Worst of all, the sports broadcasters in larger cities were found to be unlikely to report on women's sports.

Despite the increasing viewership of women's sports, there remains a larger disparity in the sports coverage for men's and women's sports.  Findings of a study by the Birmingham University indicates the top six newspaper in Britain had fewer stories on women sports than the previous year when Olympics was taking place. Stories concerning women's sports were outnumbered by the stories on men's sport by twenty times. These newspapers were: The mirror, sun, Times, Mail, Express, Mirror, and Telegraph.  The same study explains that a year after the 2012 Olympics, 97% of the sports coverage was on men's sports (Martinson 1). Furthermore, the study went ahead to link this scenario to the shortage of female sports journalists.

Media is influenced by many aspects of society. Equally, sporting activities attracts the attention of many people in the society. Therefore, the perception of the society towards equality and respect to women can be improved through increased coverage of women's sports on the media. The misogyny in the society can be said to be caused by the reluctance of media people to give adequate coverage to women's sports. We cannot be aiming to achieve parity in sports when the media devotes less than 5% of media coverage on women's sports. At the same time, the coverage of the women's sport should focus on sports and not on aesthetics and sexuality.  Change is urgently needed to reverse this. This change is welcome because it will influence the societies' perception towards women. Perhaps, more women should be encouraged to develop careers in sports journalism for this to be realized. Despite the existing situation, it is good to remain hopeful that women's sport will be given increased coverage because many fans are would love to see these sports on their screens.

Women's sports have been underrepresented in comparison to men in their respective sports. In 2009, [[SportsCenter]] dedicated only 1.4% of its airtime to women sports, down from 2.2% in 1999.&lt;ref name="Morales, Miguel 2014"&gt;Morales, Miguel. "Tennis' Gender Pay Gap Problem Looms On The Sidelines." Forbes. Forbes Magazine, 21 February 2014. Web. 11 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In an article published in 2013 by ''[[Science Daily]]'', they pointed out that over 2 years, only 3.6% of articles from five national Sunday papers discussed women sports, compared to 93.8% of articles devoted to men's sports.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor &amp; Francis.[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/09/130918090756.htm Women underrepresented, sexualized in weekend sports reporting] ScienceDaily.

Over the course of the NBA (National Basketball Association) and WNBA (Women’s National Basketball Association) in-season and off-season in 2009, a study was done based on the number of stories and airtime each league had. The NBA had 72 stories totaling 66 minutes in-season and 81 stories totaling 51 minutes in the off-season. Which is significantly more than 8 stories at 5.5 minutes in-season, and 0 stories in the off-season for the WNBA. The quality of the stories themselves was significantly lower than the men, including gag stories involving sexual dialogue or emphasizing their bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_sports|title=Women’s sports|last=|first=|date=|website=Wikipedia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the games themselves, the women’s had lower quality, editing mistakes, and fewer camera angles. 

Research has shown that children start to learn stereotypical attitudes towards gender-appropriate actions at a very early age, and traditional images in print photographs and advertising reinforce typical gender roles. Media plays a powerful role in shaping children's perception, more so than text as children develop a sense of visual literacy earlier than written literacy. A 1990 study concluded that two thirds of photos in reading primers were of men, often shown leading more action-packed, and significant lives than the women depicted in the photographs. Several studies have shown that women are often framed as sexual objects and lesser competitors, as well as displaying more emotion than men, in many sports photographs. Many media studies suggest that they continue to "reinforce the hegemonic image that sport is a right of passage for men." Studies suggest that in Sports Illustrated, which has been labeled the most influential sports publication, men are the preeminent figures featured in photographs and feature articles within the magazine. When women are underrepresented, there is an underlying message being conveyed that they don't belong, don't exist, or have not accomplished anything.&lt;ref&gt;Hardin M, Lynn S, Walsdorf K, Hardin B.

=== Pay gap ===
[[File:Serena Williams (9634023394).jpg|thumb|Serena Williams, the highest paid woman in sports in 2017]]
The pay gap in sports seems to arise depending on the gender and the type of sport. Based on athletics data in 2009, female athletes earned 23.4 percent less than male athletes.&lt;ref name="Morales, Miguel 2014" /&gt; In 2014, based on Arsenal's performance data, Arsenal's women soccer team earned less than the men's team. The women's team earned five thousand dollars as opposed to the men's whose pay scale was $1.8 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kwakye|first1=Jeanette|date=31 October 2014|title=Female sport stars should earn the same as their male counterparts|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/31/female-sport-stars-male-prize-money|journal=The Guardian|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gap does not only apply to athletes, but also to members of the teams coaching staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://minnlawyer.com/2016/05/05/u-s-womens-soccer-issues-red-card-to-pay-gap/|title=U.S. women’s soccer issues red card to pay gap|last=Sharma|first=Aalok|date=May 5, 2016|website=Minnlawyer|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many studies have been conducted to discover the emergence of the pay gap in sports. An employment strategy conducted in European Union member states shows disparity in pay between male and females.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rubery|first=Jill|date=|title=How to close the gender pay gap in Europe: towards the gender mainstreaming of pay policy|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1468-2338.2005.00353.x|journal=Industrial Relations Journal|volume=36:3|pages=184|via=Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation was how players and coaches are paid determined by gender and the sport they participate in. The results showed that the coaches of the male team had a much greater salary than the coaches of the women's team.  In 2001, the average salary for coaches of woman's teams in Division 1 was $38,191, while coaches of men's teams earned an average of $61,534.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jacobson|first1=Jennifer|date=2001|title=Female Coaches Lag In Pay And Opportunities To Oversee Men's Teams|issue=Chronicles Of Higher Education|pages=47.39}}&lt;/ref&gt;   At Division 1 I-FBS Schools in the USA, the median head coaches' salaries were $2,257,600 higher for men in comparison to their women counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.womenssportsfoundation.org/research/article-and-report/elite-athletes/pay-inequity/|title=Pay Inequity in Athletics - Women's Sports Foundation|work=Women's Sports Foundation|access-date=2018-09-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted by Michigan State University found that the salaries for both men and women Division 1 coaches was determined by both gender and type of sport. It showed that coaching males has a more positive impact on a coaches salary than coaching females did, and because of this, both athletic directors and men's coaches have a high interest in maintaining and reinforcing the status quo, which indicates that the lowest paying coaching jobs are held by women.&lt;ref&gt;Knoppers A, Meyer B, Ewing M, Forrest L. Gender and the Salaries of Coaches. Sociology Of Sport Journal [serial online]. December 1989;6(4):348-361.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, tennis remains as the one sport that has the most comparable and fair pay between men and women. Tennis receives the most media coverage than any other women’s sport, and through social media, is continuing to experience growth in popularity. According to Forbes, eight of the top ten best paid women athletes are tennis players.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2017/08/14/the-highest-paid-female-athletes-2017/#73e01d993d0b|title=Serena Williams Heads The Highest-Paid Female Athletes 2017|last=Badenhausen|first=Kurt|date=August 14, 2017|website=Forbes|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 research conducted by three professors from Brigham Young University found that male and female tennis players have the same employers at 21 events, including the four grand-slam tournaments ([[Australian Open]], [[French Open]], [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]]).&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Flake C, Dufur M, Moore E. Advantage men: The sex pay gap in professional tennis. International Review For The Sociology Of Sport [serial online]. June 2013;48(3):366-376.&lt;/ref&gt; While, in most other sports, women’s associations have different sponsorships and media coverage.

The 2007 Wimbledon Championships was the first tournament that offered equal prize money for male and female athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2015/11/2007-wimbledon-offers-equal-prize-money/56891/|title=2007: WIMBLEDON OFFERS EQUAL PRIZE MONEY|last=Tignor|first=Steve|date=November 28, 2015|website=Tennis|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while this may be the case during televised events and the grand slams, women are still not receiving as much in middle- and low- tier events; the most popular rationalization being that men play longer.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Although it is true that men players are required to play a best-of-5 set and that women players are only required to play best-of-3-sets, other than during the grand slams, this does not apply to any other tournaments. Another argument for unequal pay is that men generate more revenue through higher television ratings and attendance. However, most tournament tickets grant spectators access to both men’s and women’s matches on that day. So, aside from counting the numbers of viewers per match, it is difficult to determine revenues in tournaments where both sexes play. Finally, there is also evidence that ratings are mostly equal, with some cases indicating women being higher than men.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Women’s annual median pay gap in the United States was 19% lower than the men.&lt;ref&gt;O'Shannessy, C. (2018). Is Women’s Game Weaker? Nope. Check the Stat Sheet. ''New York Times,167''(58067), D3-D3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Supporters of the continued wage gap tend to say that men deserve to be paid more because they are stronger and have greater attendance rates.  However, when examining statistics, this opinion is unsupported. In the 2015 Open, the men's champion, [[Novak Djokovic]], served a 125 mph serve.  [[Serena Williams]] topped this by 1 mph.  In 2008 at Wimbledon, the fastest serve in the women’s final was 129 mph, the same as the fastest serve in the men’s final.  A fan of unfair pay may say that women deserve to be paid less because their sporting events are less entertaining.  However, the main reason for boredom in tennis is long, drawn out points, generally defined as nine rallies or more.  In the 2017 open, “long rallies” accounted for 11% of the points in men’s matches, with only about a 1% difference at 12.2% for women.  These supporters also like to complain that women tend to use backhands more often than forehands in comparison to men. Both are untrue as backhand winners fall in at 35.7% for women and 30.2% for men.&lt;ref&gt;Flake, C. R., Dufur, M. J., &amp; Moore, E. L. (2012). Advantage men: The sex pay gap in professional tennis. ''International Review for the Sociology of Sport,48''(3), 366-376. doi:10.1177/1012690212442166&lt;/ref&gt;  According to statistical analysis, women and men’s tennis games are within comparable measures.  As for attendance rates, these are difficult to calculate because most tickets for matches are sold as a pair for the women and men’s game.  The only true way to determine the audience size would be to do a head count at every match.

There are some who believe that the problem in trying to explain the gender pay gap, is that they are trying to justify why it exists instead of addressing the problem of why it exists in the first place. Karen Farquharson, who is a professor at Australia's Swinburne University of Technology, says the problem is a societal thing that results from not valuing women in the society. Karen admits that women are not strong as men but it does not mean they are not entertaining and competitive. The main reason why they remain less in sports is that the society is patriarchal and male-dominated especially when it comes to sports. This means that sports are like a vicious circle and broadcasters just take advantage of it to only broadcast male games continuously leaving out women thinking they are not interested.&lt;ref name="forbes.com"&gt;Morales, Miguel. "Tennis' Gender Pay Gap Problem Looms On The Sidelines." Forbes. Forbes Magazine, 21 February 2014.

Additionally, female athletes are still not receiving as much non-sexist and positive attention then male athletes. Women sometimes compete under certain conditions that give them less respect than their male peers. Women athletes still face problems of sexual harassment, and over-training associated with eating disorders and body image. The U.S. women’s soccer team, which is ranked much higher than the men’s, enjoy much less recognition, popularity, and pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hanson|first=Valarie|date=2012|title=The Inequality of Sport: Women &lt; Men|url=https://fisherpub.sjfc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1069&amp;context=ur|journal=The Review: A Journal of Undergraduate Student Research|volume=13|pages=|via=Fisher Digital Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such allegations and improper judgment on women have led some players to take a step and sue their federation for discrimination.

Toughness of competition, more lenient rules, and difference in skill levels are just a couple excuses made to disregard this very real social issue.

==Title IX==
[[File:Title IX Harassment and Assault Awareness Ribbon.PNG|thumbnail|Title IX Harassment and Assault Awareness Ribbon]]
{{Main|Title IX}}
Girls and women have been discriminated and denied sports opportunities for quite a long time. For years, women and girls were comfortable with the stereotypes that were attached with the concept of women in sports but with time, different organizations and feminists have come up with strategies to uplift the participation rates of women and girls in sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/978-1-137-53318-0_4|title="Sporting Females: Power, Diversity and the Body."

Title IX for example is a legislation that was passed in 1972 to that provided different provisions that protected the rights of equality in sports for women and girls. It is a law that requires all educational programs receiving federal funding to provide equity for both boys and girls. Over the years, the law has been subject to over 20 proposed amendments, reviews, and [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] cases. The law has acted as a way of motivating women and girls to participate more in sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/978-1-137-53318-0_4|title="Sporting Females: Power, Diversity and the Body."

The participation of girls and women in sports has brought about numerous immediate and long-term benefits that have a lasting impact on both the female gender and the society at large.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Guest, Andrew M., and Anne Luijten. "Fan culture and motivation in the context of successful women’s professional team sports: a mixed-methods case study of Portland Thorns fandom." ''Sport in Society'' (2017): 1-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the different provisions of the ‘Title IX’ include equality in the different sports fields for both sexes. Essentially, this provision is aimed at placing women at an advantage in athletics and sports. However, it is important that such provisions do not necessarily imply that equal amounts are spent on sports activities and matters for both sexes and athletic opportunities for boys and men to be reduced but simply means that both women and girls should not be discouraged and denied any sports opportunities. But there are still thousands of schools across the county are not in compliance with Title IX.&lt;ref&gt;"Title IX." TitleIX.info. Title IX, n.d. Web. 30 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The law covers all educational activities that receive public funding, so even though sports receive little public funding, they are still subject to Title IX, and are the most well-known application of the law. Opponents of the law say that has led to a break down of men's sports, pointing to the number of schools and institutions that have dropped sports since the enactment of Title IX, such as wrestling and cross-country.&lt;ref&gt;Shelton, Donald E. (2001). "Equally Bad is Not Good: Allowing Title IX "Compliance" by the Elimination of Men's Collegiate Sports".

Web. 4 May 2015 &lt;http://www.collegesportsscholarships.com/wrestling.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the law, only 295,000 girls participated in high school sports and they received only 2% of the athletic budget. In 2016-2017, that number had risen to 3.4 million girls playing high school sports across the country.&lt;ref&gt;"The Next Generation of Title IX." Title IX 40 Years and Counting (2012): n. pag.

Various studies have found that those who participate in high school athletics have higher wages, educational attainment, and educational aspirations later on in life. The rise in opportunities to participate in sports has led to a similar rise in labor force participation, which leads to more women with positive earnings.&lt;ref&gt;Betsey Stevenson, 2010. "Beyond the Classroom: Using Title IX to Measure the Return to High School Sports," The Review of Economics and Statistics, MIT Press, vol. 92(2), pages 284-301, 08&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the enactment of Title IX, women have made strides in college athletics for years. Other factors such as body shaping and fan culture are some of the motivation strategies that concerned individuals in the society are taking up to increase women and girl’s participation in sports.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However, it should be noted that more enforcement strategies need to be put in place to increase women and girl participation in sports since women discrimination in sports has not been completely eradicated since in some cases, women and girl’s participation in sports is not approved.&lt;ref&gt;Kissane, Rebecca Joyce, and Sarah Winslow. "“You’re Underestimating Me and You Shouldn’t” Women’s Agency in Fantasy Sports." ''Gender &amp; Society'' 30.5 (2016): 819-841.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scholarships ===
Before the Title IX, Equal Opportunity Law was established, not a single sports scholarship was given women in college sports in the United States. Since then, the number of scholarships given to women has increased each year to almost 85,000 scholarships in 2012, based on the “Number of Available College Athletic Scholarships”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scholarshipstats.com/default.htm|title=Number of Available College Athletic Scholarships|last=O’Rourke|first=Patrick|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to the 92,000 Scholarships available for men in that year.

The Title IX legislation was passed in 1972 and required schools that received federal funding to provide equality for boys and girls. Or having the same amount of male sports teams as women. Because of that, many schools or universities have dropped specific sports teams such as wrestling and men's soccer. Before the law, less than 300,000 girls participated in high school sports, receiving 2% of the sports budget. Since then, that number has increased to over 3.4 million girls playing high school sports across the United States.

== Women's opportunities and their leadership roles ==
Although Title IX encouraged more women to participate in sports at an NCAA level, the number of women in leadership roles drastically decreased. Women in senior decision making roles devolved to a number of 18% and women in athletic director positions held only 17% in the year 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thesportjournal.org/article/examination-of-gender-equity-and-female-participation-in-sport/|title=Examination of Gender Equity and Female Participation in Sport|last=Senne|first=Joshua A.|date=Feb 26, 2016|website=The Sport Journal|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Apr 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although major strides have been taken by people in all realms of the sports industry to create more opportunities for women, women are still underrepresented in the industry as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burton|first=LJ|date=2015|title=Review: Underrepresentation of women in sport leadership: A review of research|url=|journal=Sports Management Review|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[NCAA]], only 8.3% of Division I athletics directors are women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.org/sites/default/files/Final%2B2012%2BCollege%2BRGRC.pdf|title=The 2012 Racial and Gender Report Card: College Sport|last=Lapchick|first=Richard|date=2012|website=NCAA|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only 21% of college women's athletic programs are headed by women, and women fill only 33% of all administrative jobs in women's programs. In high school, less than 20% of athletic directors are women, and less than 40% of directors of physical education are women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.feminist.org/research/sports/sports3.html|title=Empowering Women in Sports|last=|first=|date=1995|website=Feminist Majority Foundation|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An American Society of New Editors (ASNE) newsroom census report in 1991 showed 63.1% of newsroom were men and 36.9% were women. In 2012, the percentages had not changed. By 2013, the statistics were slightly worse, showing 63.7% were men and 36.3% were women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.poynter.org/2014/media-is-failing-women-sports-journalism-particularly-so/240240/|title=Media is 'failing women' — sports journalism particularly so|last=Morrison|first=Sara|date=19 February 2014|website=Poynter|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some issues still remaining in terms of gender inequality in sport include the pay gap discrepancies, lack of opportunities for women in a male dominant industry, and lack of media coverage for women athletes. While there are women who enter top management positions in this industry, men typically receive a greater number of opportunities. Hegemony is described as a state of a “ruling class” referring to men at the forefront of society. This concept reaffirms the status quo that men demand authority in a society from imposition, manipulation, and even consent from certain groups. Due to this restricting concept, women find it much harder to advance in leadership roles simply due to what has already been set in motion by previous generations and previous cultures.

Through the role congruity theory, Eagly and Karau explained similarities between gender roles and leadership roles, which suggested prejudice toward female leader and potential leaders take two forms.  "The first form showed a less favorable evaluation of women's potential for leadership because leadership ability is more stereotypical of men than women. The second form showed a less favorable evaluation of the actual leadership behavior of women than men because such behavior is perceived less desirable in women than men."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whisenant|first=Warren|date=2015|title=Role Congruity Theory: Perceptions of Fairness and Sexism in Sport Management|url=http://libezp.lib.lsu.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=ecn&amp;AN=1536517&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site|journal=EconLit|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This research established view points and supportive information on why there are less women in leadership roles than men throughout the sport industry.

The issues women face in sports off the field are not only unique to the United States, and as the spectrum broadens, one can see that the disparity of women in sports governance positions decreases. Some have suggested to require quotas for women to participate in governance of sports programs, but even this solution is flawed. Suggesting that a company makes requirements in their recruitment to seek out women would only be done to achieve a certain number, and not because they actually want to do so in the first place. Instead, these organizations should focus on achieving targets that come close to a standard of around 40% of women representation. This number has been positively associated with correct board governance and effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adriaanse|first=Johanna|date=2014|title=The Impact of Gender Quotas on Gender Equality in Sport Governance|url=http://eige.europa.eu/resources/2014_Genderquotasandgenderequalityinsportgovernance.pdf|journal=Journal of Sports Management|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sexual harassment in the workplace ==
In her book, "Sexual Harassment in the Workplace",  Mary Boland argues that [[sexual harassment]] is a personal attack on a woman's mind and body, that installs fear and violates her right to bodily integrity education, and freedom of movement.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sexual Harassment in the Workplace|last=Boland|first=Mary|publisher=Sphinx Publications|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)'' "working women face higher risks than men from job-related stress, and one of the most noxious stressors sexual harassment."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In reference to the toll that it takes on women, Boland states "victims suffer physical, mental, emotional, and financial losses that can be devastating."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; According to a study conducted by the Journal of Sport Management, over 50% of 112 respondents reported they encountered some form of sexual harassment over the past 12 months prior to the study.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As reported by the Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport at the University of Central Florida in 2012, 90% of sports editors and 88% of sports reporters are men.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The disproportion between men and women in this position may discourage female sport media print professionals from reporting such incidents of sexual harassment according to an article published by Christina Coleburn.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Regardless of the field in which women work, sexual harassment in the workplace is alive and well and in the [[Sport industry|sports industry]], it is common. Women in powerful or governance position are often viewed as too assertive, thus receiving harassment for challenging the preconceived notion of a hierarchy. These women in power also report more instances of sexual harassment in the workplace, because of their threat to the status quo. Studies also suggest that a women in a supervisor position will report more instances of sexual harassment due to their intelligence, knowledge, and experience in a workplace environment where they hold power. Targets of sexual harassment are more likely to be female because they may have masculine tendencies, and men feel the need to reassure their “masculine dominance”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mclaughlin|first=Heather|date=2012|title=Sexual Harassment, Workplace Authority, and the Paradox of Power|url=|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=|pages=625–647|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of awareness of sexual harassment in the sports industry is extremely concerning for progressive movements towards equality. A study done in 2011 in Quebec called “Disclosure of Sexual Abuse in Sport Organizations: A Case Study” points to the many problems in sports organizations. Most instances point to women rarely, if ever, reporting assault or harassment in the sports business. Most coaches, athletes, and administrators were not even aware of existing protocols of sexual harassment. When questioned about this concerning issue, the administrators resorted back to their lawyers; assuming that the issue was for too complicated to tackle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=endsexualexploitation.org/articles/sexual-exploitation-sports-industry-abuse-power/|title=Sexual Exploitation in the Sports Industry: An Abuse of Power|last=Urie|first=Marie|date=2018|website=endsexualexploitation.org|publisher=National Center on Sexual Exploitation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[USA Gymnastics sex abuse scandal]] that occurred over the course of several years, but came to light in the latter months of 2017 and early 2018 involved former doctor [[Larry Nassar]].  More than 250 young women accused Nassar of sexual harassment and abuse. Many of these women were seen and treated by Nassar as a gymnast. Because of his role as the USA gymnastics team doctor, Nassar was able to be alone with hundreds of young women and girls over the course of nearly two decades. Women can often be afraid to come forward with these allegations because of how it may affect their career and how others may see them afterwards. [[Aly Raisman]], a USA Gymnast, explained how the abuse from Nassar had occurred from such a young age, that despite strange thoughts about his treatment methods, she was taught to trust him which is why it took so long to figure out what was happening to her and many other gymnasts and come forward about it.&lt;ref&gt;LaPook, J., Dr. (2018, September 9). Aly Raisman, one of the most accomplished American gymnasts of all time. ''60 Minutes [CBS]''.

According to associate director of research at Pew Research Center, Katie Simmons, "a woman's main role has always been to be a wife, and then a mother. Women have been stereotyped for years as being the less intellectual and weaker sex."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simmons|first=Katie|date=2011|title=Women in Top Management Positions in the Sport Industry: Breaking Down the Barriers and Stereotypes|url=http://fisherpub.sjfc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1031&amp;context=sport_undergrad|journal=Sport Management Undergraduate|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women are often objectified in the sport industry, and judged solely on the way they look, especially now when social media has become more and more mainstream. Discussed in the article ''Sports Journalism Has A Major Sexual Harassment Problem,'' women working in the sport industry infrequently report incidents where they have experienced sexual harassment and inappropriate comments throughout their careers due to fear or losing their job.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.slantnews.com/story/2015-08-17-sports-journalism-has-a-major-sexual-harassment-problem|title=Sports Journalism Has A Major Sexual Harassment Problem|last=Coleburn|first=Christina|date=|website=Slant News|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507231958/https://www.slantnews.com/story/2015-08-17-sports-journalism-has-a-major-sexual-harassment-problem|archivedate=7 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; One occupation that frequently experiences sexual harassment in the sport industry are female sport media print professionals.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pederson|first=Paul|date=2014|title=Management and Marketing Research An Examination of the Perceptions of Sexual Harassment by Sport Print Media Professionals|url=http://journals.humankinetics.com/jsm-back-issues/jsmvolume23issue3may/anexaminationoftheperceptionsofsexualharassmentbysportprintmediaprofessionals|journal=Journal of Sport Management|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female sport media print professionals are typically sports editors, sportswriters, sports columnists, and sports reporters.Women working in this sector of the sport industry have reported numerous incidents where they have experienced threatening comments, sexual abuse and harassment, or some form of intimidation.

Like the [[Isthmian Games]] of [[Corinth]], the Panathenaic Games continued into early Christian times.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Heuck Allen, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=rV8vyYn-qMgC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA39 Finding the walls of Troy: Frank Calvert and Heinrich Schliemann at Hisarlík]'', University of California Press, 1999, {{ISBN|0-520-20868-4}}, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The '''New Testament''' uses a number of '''[[Sportsperson|athletic]] [[metaphor]]s''' in discussing Christianity, especially in the [[Pauline epistles]] and the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]].  Such metaphors also appear in the writings of contemporary philosophers, such as [[Epictetus]] and [[Philo]],&lt;ref&gt;Anthony C. Thiselton, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=aNkcqC9bdAMC&amp;pg=PA713 The First Epistle to the Corinthians: A commentary on the Greek text]'', Eerdmans, 2000, {{ISBN|0-8028-2449-8}}, p. 713.&lt;/ref&gt; drawing on the tradition of the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]],&lt;ref&gt;David Arthur DeSilva, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=y9GA4JRq9AEC&amp;pg=PA362 Perseverance in Gratitude: A socio-rhetorical commentary on the Epistle "to the Hebrews"]'', Eerdmans, 2000, {{ISBN|0-8028-4188-0}}, p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt; and this may have influenced New Testament use of the imagery.&lt;ref&gt;Roman Garrison, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=HrJAe31jayUC&amp;pg=PA104 The Graeco-Roman Context of Early Christian Literature]'', Continuum International Publishing Group, 1997, {{ISBN|1-85075-646-5}}, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

The metaphor of running a race "with perseverance" appears in [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]] 12:1,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+12:1&amp;version=NIV Hebrews 12:1, NIV (BibleGateway)]: "Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles, and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us."&lt;/ref&gt; and related metaphors appear in [[Epistle to the Philippians|Philippians]] 2:16,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+2:16&amp;version=NIV Philippians 2:16, NIV (BibleGateway).]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] 2:2,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+2:2&amp;version=NIV Galatians 2:2, NIV (BibleGateway).]&lt;/ref&gt; and Galatians 5:7.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+5:7&amp;version=NIV Galatians 5:7, NIV (BibleGateway).]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Second Epistle to Timothy|2 Timothy]] 4:7, Paul writes "I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%204:7&amp;version=NIV 2 Timothy 4:7, NIV (BibleGateway).]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians]] 9:24–26,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%209:24-26&amp;version=NIV 1 Corinthians 9:24–26, NIV (BibleGateway).]&lt;/ref&gt; written to the city that hosted the [[Isthmian Games]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Leland Ryken]], Jim Wilhoit, [[Tremper Longman]], Colin Duriez, Douglas Penney, and Daniel G. Reid, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=qjEYEjVVEosC&amp;pg=RA4-PA693 Dictionary of Biblical Imagery]'', InterVarsity Press, 1998, {{ISBN|0-8308-1451-5}}, p. 693 (RACE).&lt;/ref&gt; the metaphor is extended from running to other games, such as [[Ancient Greek boxing|boxing]],&lt;ref&gt;John Phillips, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=c4F0l2b1QnkC&amp;pg=200 Exploring 1 Corinthians: An expository commentary]'', Kregel Publications, 2002, {{ISBN|0-8254-3495-5}}, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; to make the point that winning a prize requires discipline, self-control, and coordinated activity.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome H. Neyrey and Bruce J. Malina, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=J7AtGEmOD38C&amp;pg=PA144 Paul, in Other Words: A Culture Reading of His Letters]'', Westminster John Knox Press, 1990, {{ISBN|0-664-22159-9}}, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Second Epistle to Timothy|2 Timothy]] 2:5&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%202:5&amp;version=NIV 2 Timothy 2:5, NIV (BibleGateway).]&lt;/ref&gt; the same point is made.&lt;ref&gt;John Norman Davidson Kelly, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=t84kfQfTB50C&amp;pg=PA176 A Commentary on the Pastoral Epistles: I Timothy, II Timothy, Titus]'', Part 1, Continuum International Publishing Group, 1963, {{ISBN|0-7136-1366-1}}, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; These athletic metaphors are also echoed in later Christian writing.&lt;ref&gt;Jason König, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=WypKKCGev2wC&amp;pg=PA133 Athletics and Literature in the Roman Empire]'', Cambridge University Press, 2005, {{ISBN|0-521-83845-2}}, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

As with [[New Testament military metaphors]], these metaphors appear in many hymns, such as ''Fight the Good Fight with All Thy Might'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hymntime.com/tch/htm/f/i/fightthe.htm The Cyber Hymnal: ''Fight the Good Fight with All Thy Might'']: "Run the straight race through God’s good grace."&lt;/ref&gt; which was sung in the film ''[[Chariots of Fire]]''; and "[[Angel Band (song)|Angel Band]]",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hymntime.com/tch/htm/m/y/mylatest.htm The Cyber Hymnal: ''My Latest Sun Is Sinking Fast'']: "My race is nearly run; / My strongest trials now are past, / My triumph is begun."&lt;/ref&gt; which was sung in the film ''[[O Brother, Where Art Thou?]]''.

New Testament athletic metaphors were embraced by advocates of [[muscular Christianity]], both in the [[Victorian era]] and in later times.&lt;ref&gt;Richard G. Kyle, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=2fRFi2ZPBVkC&amp;pg=PA203 Evangelicalism: An Americanized Christianity]'', Transaction Publishers, 2006, {{ISBN|0-7658-0324-0}}, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dane S.

The name '''Nosler''' applies to a number of companies involved in the manufacture of [[ammunition]] and [[handloading]] components, specializing in high performance [[hollow point bullet|hollow point]] and [[soft point bullet|soft point]] hunting bullets.  Current companies include '''Nosler, Inc.''', '''Nosler Custom''', and '''Nosler Reloading'''.  Nosler's contributions include both new  bullet designs and new manufacturing techniques used in their production.

==Early history==
[[John Nosler]] was born 4 April 1913 in [[Brawley, California|Brawley]], California.  Nosler was hunting [[moose]] in [[British Columbia]] in 1946, when the bullets he was using failed to penetrate deeply enough to reach vital organs and kill the animal quickly.&lt;ref name="carter"&gt;Aaron Carter "John A. Nosler" ''American Rifleman'' January 2011 pp.38-39&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time, most jacketed bullets employed a single [[copper]] alloy envelope (the jacket) around a single [[lead]] alloy core.  The jacket on most military bullets was closed in front and opened at the base.  These [[full metal jacket bullet]]s offered good penetration, but often failed to expand and passed completely through an animal leaving a comparatively small wound.  Soft-point hunting bullets like Nosler was using had the jacket applied in the opposite direction to completely cover the base, but open at the nose.  These bullets would expand to leave a large wound channel, but sometimes broke into small pieces with inadequate momentum to overcome resistance of moving through bone or muscle tissue.

The experience inspired Nosler to develop a new bullet design, intended to expand readily at low impact velocities yet maintain integrity at high impact velocities (see [[terminal ballistics]]).  These ''Nosler Partition'' bullets used a specially designed jacket enclosing two separate lead alloy cores.&lt;ref name="carter"/&gt;  The front core was open on the nose to expand easily, but expansion would stop at the partition (which was a solid layer of copper extending right across the bullet, not just the thin shell of copper which composed the jacket).  The portion of the bullet behind the partition has the structural integrity of a full metal jacket bullet, but the expanded forward jacket leaves a larger wound channel.  Bullets were originally manufactured for personal use, using hand made, [[Lathe (metal)|lathe]] turned jackets.  In 1948 Nosler began to sell the partition bullets commercially, forming Nosler, Inc.&lt;ref name="nosler"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nosler.com/partition-bullet/|title=Partition|publisher=Nosler|accessdate=2010-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further innovations by Nosler included new techniques of manufacturing bullet jackets that yielded more consistent expansion, better core bonding techniques to prevent separation of the [[lead]] core from the [[copper]] jacket, and the plastic Ballistic Tip used to provide the streamlined shape of a Spitzer boat tail, with the expansion of a hollow point.&lt;ref name="carter"/&gt;  The Nosler Ballistic Tip design has been copied by other manufacturers, such as the V-Max bullet by [[Hornady]].  John Nosler sold the production facilities to his son in 1988, and died at his home in Bend, Oregon, on 10 October 2010.&lt;ref name="carter"/&gt;

==Company Information==
Today, Nosler makes a number of different hunting bullets for rifle, handgun, and muzzle-loaders.  They also manufacture brass and sell loaded ammunition, and Nosler Custom has recently begun to sell limited edition and semi-custom hunting rifles.  The original Partition design bullet still is the company's flagship product. It has undergone many refinements over the years, but the basic design concept has remained unchanged.

==Company News==
Nosler experienced a massive explosion at their plant in Bend, Oregon on 2 June 2010. No one was harmed in the blast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ktvz.com/news/Nosler-Finds-Some-Good-News-in-Blast-s-Wake/-/413192/625540/-/p4qqvp/-/index.html KTVZ report on Nosler Explosion]&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, Nosler announced plans to expand their long-standing operations in Bend, Oregon to their neighboring city of Redmond, where the company purchased 60 acres of undeveloped land in December 2014. Construction of a 30,000 sq. ft. building is planned for completion in 2016 and will house Nosler’s growing ammunition and cartridge brass operations, including the manufacturing of their SSA by Nosler product line based on the company’s acquisition of Silver State Armory in 2013. The expansion is expected to add approximately 20 jobs in Central Oregon and will allow the original Bend plant to focus exclusively on bullet production.&lt;ref name="Redmond thrilled by Nosler expansion plans"&gt;{{cite web|title=Redmond thrilled by Nosler expansion plans|url=http://www.bendbulletin.com/business/2851182-151/redmond-thrilled-by-nosler-expansion-plans|publisher=[[The Bulletin (Bend)]]|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nosler Ammunition Acquires Silver State Armory"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nosler Ammunition Acquires Silver State Armory|url=http://www.ammoland.com/2013/06/nosler-ammunition-acquires-silver-state-armory/#axzz3hIfs39J5|publisher=AmmoLand|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Company Developments==
In 2006 Nosler announced its very first rifle offering, the Model 48 Trophy Grade.&lt;ref name="Nosler Model 48 Patriot Review"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nosler Model 48 Patriot Review|url=http://www.rifleshootermag.com/longrange/nosler-model-48-patriot-review|publisher=RifleShooter |accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nosler announced the company’s first proprietary cartridge, the [[26 Nosler]], as the world’s most powerful 6.5mm cartridge commercially available during [[SHOT Show]] in January 2014. In January 2015, Nosler introduced the company’s second cartridge, the 28 Nosler, a 7mm rifle cartridge based on the [[26 Nosler]] case. Since their release, the [[26 Nosler]] and [[28 Nosler]] &lt;ref name="The Firearm Blog"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nosler Introduces "World’s Most Powerful" 7mm: The .28 Nosler|url=http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2015/01/30/nosler-introduces-worlds-powerful-7mm-28-nosler/|publisher=The Firearm Blog |accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been known for high muzzle velocities and extremely flat trajectories. The parent case for both cartridges is based on the [[.404 Jeffery]] case.

In October 2014, Nosler introduced Ballistic Tip Ammunition as the latest product offering in their factory loaded ammunition.&lt;ref name="AmmoLand: Shooting Sports News"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nosler Announces BT Ammunition for America’s Most Popular Game|url=http://www.ammoland.com/2014/10/nosler-bt-ammunition/#axzz3W5Apv0r0|publisher=AmmoLand |accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ammunition is loaded exclusively with Nosler’s line of Ballistic Tip hunting bullets, a polymer-tipped projectile made popular by the company when introduced in 1984 as a premium choice for hunting medium-sized game such as deer, antelope and wild hogs.&lt;ref name="North American Hunter"&gt;{{cite web|title=Designed For America's Most Popular Game|url=http://www.scout.com/outdoors/hunting/story/1475010-designed-for-america-s-most-popular-game?s=77|publisher=North American Hunter Staff |accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ballistic Tip Ammunition line pairs the performance of the Ballistic Tip projectile with Nosler’s own component brass.

Late 2014 Nosler revamped the Model 48 line. It did away with the Trophy Grade Rifle and replaced it with the Patriot Rifle. The new rifle has a Basix trigger and Bell and Carlson stock.  For the most accuracy out of the Patriot, Nosler incorporated an aluminum bedding chassis into the aramid-fiber reinforced carbon fiber stock, and the barrel is free-floated. The stock is a hand laid-up laminate that is elephant gray with black epoxy webbed over the surface. Which means it’s never going to warp or crack. The comb is straight with a pancake cheekpiece and a thick, solid pistol grip. The Patriot rifle chambered in [[.26 Nosler]] should be an effective hunting combination from the mountains to the prairies.&lt;ref name="Nosler Model 48 Patriot Review"/&gt;

Early 2016 Nosler introduced its third cartridge the [[.30 Nosler]].

October 2016 Nosler introduces a new line of Competition / Target Bullets - RDF Bullets&lt;ref name="Nosler"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nosler Unveils Ultra-High BC, Reduced Drag Factor (RDF) Bullet Line|url=http://www.nosler.com/blog/news-and-articles/2016/10/21/nosler-unveils-ultra-high-bc-reduced-drag-factor-rdf-bullet-line|publisher=Nosler Inc |accessdate=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

October 2016 Nosler introduces the [[.33 Nosler]]&lt;ref name="AmmoLand"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nosler Introduces Their Most Powerful Cartridge Yet – The 33 Nosler|url=http://www.ammoland.com/2016/10/nosler-introduces-their-most-powerful-cartridge-yet-the-33-nosler|publisher=AmmoLand |accessdate=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

January 2017 Nosler introduces the [[.22 Nosler]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1971">[[File:Qianball court.jpg|thumb|Qianball court]]
'''Qianball''' is a racket sport similar to [[tennis]] or [[Squash (sport)|squash]]. The game can be described as a mix between tennis and squash or as squash without walls. The game can be played by two or four players, or used as practice by a single person. '''Qianball''' can be played on any flat hard surface, indoors or outdoors no matter the weather. 

The game is played on a [[court]] a little smaller than a tennis court with both players placed on the same side of the net. The player side of the net measures 7.6 * 7.8 m, and the other side of the net should be app. 10 * 12 m, but there are no exact rules for this.   

The name is derived from the Chinese Qianlongball, from where the game originates. 

The game involves:

*One court measuring 7.6 by 7.8 meters in the player zone and 10 by 12 meters in the ball zone
*Two or four players playing respectively single or double
*One ballbag with weight or floor embedded hook
*A qianball racket for each player
*A qianball ball with rubber band
*A net or similar at a height of 81&amp;nbsp;cm

The game is played by placing the ball bag 2.1 m from the net in the so-called Qianball point. the end of the rubber band is attached to the turning rings or the floor embedded hook. 
The players are positioned on the same side of the net as in [[Squash (sport)|squash]] and takes turns to serve 2 consecutive serves before changing sides. The game is decided in three sets to 15 playing with a running score. 

The ball may not touch the ground in the player zone or the opposing player will score a point, and may only touch the ground once in the ball zone.
 
Denmark was the first country in Europe where Qianball came to from China. In Denmark the game is organised under [[KFUM]] (Danish branch of [[YMCA]] sport). In China there are roughly one million players.

The '''Reaves Arena''' is an 8,250-seat multi-purpose [[arena]] in [[Perry, Georgia]], [[United States|USA]].  It was opened in 1990, hosting local sporting events and concerts. The arena is named in honor of Representative [[Henry L. Reaves]] (D-Quitman) who, along with Representative Larry Walker, was instrumental in the creation of the [[Georgia National Fairgrounds and Agricenter]], where the arena is located. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official Code of Georgia Annotated Volume 42A|publisher=State of Georgia|page=1198|date=2009|accessdate=December 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Georgia Encyclopedia|publisher=University of Georgia Press|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/business-economy/georgia-national-fairgrounds-and-agricenter|accessdate= December 27, 2016|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hon.

'''Joseph Leo "Roundy" Coughlin''' (September 18, 1889 &amp;ndash; December 9, 1971) was a [[sports columnist]] from [[Madison, Wisconsin]] who wrote primarily for the ''[[Wisconsin State Journal]].'' Most of his bylines were simply "Roundy."  His [[column (periodical)|column]], "Roundy Says," was the newspaper's most popular column.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

While Roundy was running a [[pool hall]] on Madison's [[State Street (Madison)|State Street]], he earned a reputation for his exceptional knack to predict the outcomes of [[college football]] games.&lt;ref name="Moe2010"&gt;{{cite news

In 1924, he switched employers to the ''Wisconsin State Journal''. Understanding that Roundy would be a major boon for the newspaper, the editors chose to announce his hiring with the entire front page of its second section.&lt;ref name="Moe2010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Roundy often wrote in a [[stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream-of-consciousness]] style, frequently at the expense of proper grammar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Roundy's charity, the Empty Stocking Club, has raised money for needy children and those with disabilities.

A remarkably breviloquent, spoof interview between Roundy and theoretical physicist [[Paul Dirac]] has circulated with the date "31 April," but no actual newspaper was issued on that fake date, and the interview is not attributable to Roundy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Farmelo |first=Graham  |title=[[The Strangest Man]]: the Life of Paul Dirac |publisher=[[Faber and Faber]] |location=London |year=2009 |isbn=0-465-01827-0 |oclc=426938310  |ref=harv |pages=162–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rules''' is an [[Athletics (sport)|athletic game]] played between two players, on a 64 foot square grid. It is characterized by its use of sticks similar to that of a stringed instrument [[Bow (music)|bow]], with the aim of getting one's tip through the other stick's space between the slack (the hair) and the rod (the wood).

==Gameplay==
The field consists of 16 squares, called cells, with sides of 2 feet arranged in a square. The players start in diagonally opposite squares in the middle. Every 20 seconds, the players must switch into an adjacent cell. A [[Tally marks|tally]] runs for 20 minutes in this fashion: 3 tallies making a game. One's goal is to strike their stick through the other's stick, whilst simultaneously preventing their own from being struck. However, the two participants must always be facing each other, and cannot move their stick behind their body.

The '''Sports Ground''' is a [[cricket]] ground in [[Cleethorpes]], [[Lincolnshire]].

'''Tsaghkadzor Olympic Sports Complex''' ({{lang-hy|Ծաղկաձորի Օլիմպիական Մարզահամալիր}}), is a multi-sport training complex in the mountain resort town of [[Tsaghkadzor]], [[Kotayk Province]], [[Armenia]]. It was opened in 1967 a state-owned sports complex of the [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic]]. It was entirely renovated between 2007 and 2008 with an estimated cost of US$ 8 million.&lt;ref&gt;[https://armenpress.am/arm/news/498294/tsaxkadzori-olimpiakan-avani-veranorogumn-amboxjutyamb.html The Tsaghkadzor Olympic Sports Complex is due to reopen in 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Tsaghkadzor Sports Complex was opened in 1967 during the Soviet days, through the efforts of the Soviet-Armenian gymnast and Olympic gold medalist [[Hrant Shahinyan]]. The complex was specifically designed and built to become the main venue to host the training campaign of the Soviet athletes for the [[1968 Summer Olympics]] in [[Mexico City]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tsakhkadzor.am/en/sports/sports-center Tsaghkadzor Sports complex at the town's official website]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, the [[Tsaghkadzor ski resort]] was opened near the complex.

On 22 May 1987 soviet-armenian athlete [[Robert Emmiyan]] jumped here 8,86m, which was registered second longest jump ever that time.

Entirely renovated in 2007, the Tsaghkadzor Olympic Complex is considered one of the most developed training facilities in [[Transcaucasia]]. It provides training areas for 35 types of sports including 2 regular-sized football pitches with athletics track, indoor sports hall, indoor swimming pool, diving pool, skiing and snowboarding tracks, fitness halls, modern hotel and sanatorium along with many other facilities. The centre is also home to a large training hall for individual Olympic sports including wrestling, judo, weightlifting, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportcomplexhotel.com/?id=264  Tsaghkadzor Olympic Complex sport facilities]&lt;/ref&gt; The complex hosts the annual competition of the "Best Sport Family" held every year during summer.

The nearby ski resort is the centre of winter sports in Armenia. The skiing season in Tsaghkadzor normally starts in mid-December and stretches well into March with the top slopes often fit for skiing in April.
