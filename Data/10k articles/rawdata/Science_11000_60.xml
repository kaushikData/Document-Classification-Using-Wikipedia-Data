      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1031">The rare [[mineral]] '''adelite''', is a [[calcium]], [[magnesium]], [[arsenate]] with [[chemical formula]] CaMgAsO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;OH. It forms a [[solid solution]] series with the [[vanadium]] bearing mineral [[gottlobite]]. Various [[transition metal]]s substitute for magnesium and lead replaces calcium leading to a variety of similar minerals in the ''adelite - [[duftite]] group''.

Adelite forms variably colored (blue, green, yellow and grey) crystals in the [[orthorhombic]] crystal system. The form is typically massive. It has a [[Mohs hardness]] rating of 5 and a [[specific gravity]] of 3.73 to 3.79.

It was first described in 1891 from Värmland, [[Sweden]]. Its name comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for ''indistinct''.

He was born in [[Scotland]] in [[Kinellar]], [[Aberdeenshire]] and came to South Africa in 1896. He returned to Scotland to study but emigrated permanently to South Africa in 1909. He worked as an architect until 1932.

He was president of the Astronomical Society of South Africa from 1942 to 1943.

He discovered the periodic comet [[37P/Forbes]]. He was also one of several co-discoverers of "Comet Pons-Coggia-Winnecke-Forbes", which is today known as [[27P/Crommelin]] in honor of the astronomer who computed its orbit.

The '''ballpark model''' is a system under which users of a facility do so at their own risk. The name arises from the fact that visitors to a ballpark bear the risk of getting hit by bats, balls and other objects flying into the stands at high velocities. An example of this type of system is [[New Hampshire]]'s lack of a requirement that motorists carry liability insurance. The risk of getting hit by a driver who has neither insurance nor the means to pay for damages is borne by other motorists.

It is in contrast to the [[Disneyland model]].

The '''bombing of the Bezuidenhout''' took place on 3 March 1945, when the [[Royal Air Force]] accidentally bombed the [[Bezuidenhout]] neighbourhood in the Dutch city of [[The Hague]]. At the time, the neighbourhood was more densely populated than usual with evacuees from The Hague and [[Wassenaar]]; tens of thousands were left homeless and had to be quartered in the Eastern and Central Netherlands.

The British bomber crews had intended to bomb the [[Haagse Bos]] ("Forest of the Hague") district where the [[Nazi Germany|Germans]] had installed [[V-2]] launching facilities that had been used to attack English cities. However the pilots were issued with the wrong coordinates so the navigational instruments of the bombers had been set incorrectly, and combined with fog and clouds obscured their vision, the bombs were instead dropped on the Bezuidenhout residential neighbourhood.

==Event==
On the morning of March 3, 1945 [[medium bomber|medium]] and [[light bomber|light]] bombers of the [[North American B-25 Mitchell]] and [[Douglas A-20 Havoc|Douglas Boston]] types from [[No. 137 Wing RAF|No. 137]] and [[No. 139 Wing RAF|No. 139]] wings of the [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force|Second Tactical Air Force]] took off from [[Melsbroek Air Base|Melsbroek]] near [[Brussels]] and [[Vitry-En-Artois Airport|Vitry]] in Northern France. Between 8 and 9 o'clock in the morning the bombers dropped 67 tonnes of high explosive bombs on the Bezuidenhout,&lt;ref name="kb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kb.nl/themas/geschiedenis-en-cultuur/tweede-wereldoorlog/bombardement-op-bezuidenhout|title=Bombardement op Bezuidenhout maart 1945|trans-title=Bombing of the Bezuidenhout March 1945|publisher=[[National Library of the Netherlands|Koninklijke Bibliotheek]]|accessdate=5 December 2013|language=nl}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; wreaking widespread destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?ei=FcOXUtmIFYfwhQeC-4CgAQ&amp;id=_vQfUQxCjtMC&amp;dq=The+Low+Countries%3A+Arts+and+Society+in+Flanders+and+the+Netherlands%2C+a+Yearbook&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=razed |title=The Low Countries: arts and society in Flanders and the Netherlands, a yearbook |volume=9 |author=Stichting Ons Erfdeel |year=1998 |publisher=Flemish-Netherlands Foundation |page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to insufficient [[fire apparatus|fire engines]] and [[firefighter|firemen]] (as many of them had been either called up for [[Arbeitseinsatz|forced labour in German industry]] or had gone into hiding to prevent being signed up) the resulting fire was largely unchecked,&lt;ref name="kb"/&gt; killing 511 people,&lt;ref name="amigoe"/&gt; including eight firemen.
[[File:Db Theresiastraat-31.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Theresiastraat'' in the Bezuidenhout before World War II]]
As soon as the British realized the extent of the damage, they dropped fliers over the neighbourhood apologizing for the error.&lt;ref name="v2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.v2platform.nl/book/bombing.html |title=Bombardment on Bezuidenhout |first=J. R. |last=Verbeek |year=2005 |accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Trouw]]'', the [[Dutch resistance]] newspaper, reported:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The horrors of the war are increasing. We have seen the fires in The Hague after the terrible bombings due to the V2-launching sites. We have seen the column of smoke, drifting to the south and the ordeal of the war has descended upon us in its extended impact. We heard the screaming bombs falling on (the) Bezuidenhout, and the missiles which brought death and misery fell only a hundred metres from us. At the same time we saw the launching and the roaring, flaming V2, holding our breath to see if the launch was successful, if not falling back on the homes of innocent people. It is horrible to see the monsters take off in the middle of the night between the houses, lighting up the skies. One can imagine the terrors that came upon us now that The Hague is a frontline town, bombed continuously for more than ten days. Buildings, burning and smouldering furiously, a town choking from smoke, women and children fleeing, men hauling furniture which they tried to rescue from the chaos. What misery, what distress.&lt;ref name="v2"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Challenging the Chip''''' is a 2006 book on "labor rights and environmental justice in the global electronics industry" edited by [[Ted Smith (environmentalist)|Ted Smith]], [[David A. Sonnenfeld]], and [[David Naguib Pellow]] . It is published by [[Temple University Press]]. In three parts, the book looks at global electronics, [[environmental justice]] and [[labor rights]], and [[electronic waste]] and [[extended producer responsibility]]. In four appendices, the book also deals with the principles of environmental justice, the computer take-back campaign, sample [[shareholder resolutions]], and the electronics recycler's pledge of true stewardship.

This 357-page book was put together by "scores of people around the world (who) have been involved over the course of several years in the conceptualization, development, editing and production (of it)".

== "New wave of technology" ==
In his Foreword to the text, former [[Texas]] Agriculture Commissioner [[Jim Hightower]] makes out a case to explain how "technology happens". He writes: "Take cars. After Henry Ford began mass production, it took only a flash in time for these four-wheeled chunks of technology to wholly transform our landscape, environment, economy, culture, psychology, and ... well, pretty much our whole world. For better or worse, cars created freeways, shopping malls, McDonald's, drive-in banking -- even the Beach Boys!" Hightower argues: "A new wave of technology is sweeping the land. It is embodied in the tiny chips (and the computers they power) that are radically and rapidly transforming our world -- and, like the automobile, not always for the better."

He also contends that the story of the "dark side of the chip" needs to be "told and retold" across the "global village" before it is too late to do anything about it.

The book narrates the story of how the high-tech industry grew in the "[[Valley of Heart's Delight]]" (before the place got renamed to [[Silicon Valley]]) and how [[Santa Clara Valley]] fruit-processing workers such as [[Alida Hernandez]] got reinvented into "[[clean room]]" workers. This "deplorable pattern is still being replicated around the world".

== Stories of electronic workers suffering toxic exposures ==
The book contains stories about [[Electronics|electronic]] workers suffering toxic exposures and fighting over it. From the Southwestern US and the [[Maquiladora]] region on the [[Mexico–United States border]], to [[Malaysia]], [[Taiwan]], [[Thailand]], China, and India.

The book argues that "far too (words) have been addressed to the downside of the (electronics industry's) revolution". Its co-editors, in a signed article titled "The Quest for Sustainability and Justice in a High-Tech World", say: "Although most consumers are eager to enjoy their latest electronic games, few relate the declining prices of these and other electronic technologies to the labor of Third World women, who are paid pennies a day."

Other issues focused on by the co-editors include [[environmental degradation]], [[occupational health hazards]], and the "widespread ignorance" of the "health and ecological footprints of the global electronics industry".

There are problems of contamination by hi-tech manufacturing (of workers, air, land and water) from all around -- [[Silicon Valley]] in the United States, [[Silicon Glen]] in Scotland, [[Silicon Island]] in Thailand, and [[Silicon Paddy]] in China. It contrasts the reality between the "CEOs and upper management" drawing "multimillion dollar salaries and 'golden parachutes'" as against the reality of the production workers living in packed dormitories and often facing sweatshop conditions.

== Unsung heroines and heroes ==
While acknowledging the work of the hi-tech revolution pioneers, the book's editors also points to the "accomplishments of the unsung heroines and heroes of this revolution's other side". Including [[Santa Clara Center for Occupational Safety and Health]] founder [[Amanda Hawes]]; [[San Jose, California]] housewife [[Lorraine Ross]], who battled against [[Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation]]'s polluting practices in [[Silicon Valley]]; Thai occupational health physician [[Orapan Metadilogkul]] who confronted [[Seagate Corporation]]; and Scottish semiconductor worker Helen Clark "who gave her life fighting to provide a voice for poisoned workers of National Semiconductor's plant in Silicon Glen".

== Globalisation of electronics, labor rights, product end-of-life ==
Its editors say the book has "two geographical frames of reference"—the vicinity of San Jose, California (or, Silicon Valley), and "parts of the world increasingly integrated into global networks of electronics production, consumption, and disposal". The volume looks at three "broad, integrative themes": the globalization of electronics manufacturing; labor rights and environmental justice; and the product end-of-life cycle issues (e-waste, and extended producer responsibility).

In terms of global electronics, the book focuses on Silicon Valley (where the United States electronics industry's roots lie, and which has a three-decade history of community and worker dialog and struggle). It also looks at electronics manufacturing in China, India, Thailand, and Central and Eastern Europe.

In terms of labor rights and "environmental justice", the book looks at the stories of workers and environmentalists taking up such issues -- "work hazards, antiunion hostility, and environmental health perils"—in countries that range from the United States, to Mexico, Scotland, and Thailand, among others.

[[E-waste]] issues get looked at in the context of trading or dumping from the North to South. "But as nations like India and China increasingly modernize, their own industries and consumers are contributing to the problems as well," says the editors.

== Failed to keep pace with social and environmental advances ==
They argue that while the electronics industry leaders have produced "enormous technical innovation over the years", they have failed to keep "sufficient pace with the socially and environmentally oriented advances that are available to them." In their chapter titled "The Quest for Sustainability", the co-editors suggest that sustainability, environmental justice and labor rights "cannot lie solely in the hands of either the social movements or the captains of industry or the representatives of the state". Instead, it suggests, all citizens and stakeholders must play a role in shaping the industry, its workers, and the environment wherever communities get affected.

== "Downside not addressed" ==
Says an introduction to its contents: "Of the millions of words written over the past several decades about the electronics industry's incredible transformation of our world, far too few have been addressed (to) the downside of this revolution. Many are surprised to learn that environmental degradation and occupational health hazards are as much a part of high-tech manufacturing as miniaturization and other such marvels".

== Third World women's labor, pollute surroundings ==
The editors also comment: "Although most consumers are eager to enjoy their latest computers, televisions, cellular phones, iPods, and electronic games, few relate the declining prices of these and other electronic technologies to the labor of Third World women, who are paid pennies a day. Fewer still realize that the amazingly powerful microprocessors and superminiaturized, high-capacity memory devices harm the workers who produce them and pollute the surrounding communities' air and water".

== Comments on the book ==
[[Sandra Steingraber]] calls this book "essential reading for anyone who owns a cell phone or a computer" and says "our digital possessions connect us not only to global information but also to global contamination and injustice". [[Nicholas Ashford]] calls the work "an impressive, comprehensive critique and hopeful, but realistic, blueprint for transforming the global electronics industry into a sustainable one encompassing technological advance, environmental improvement, and equitable, safe, and secure employment". [[Jan Mazurek]] says that "contrary to high tech's clean image, this pioneering work illustrates the industry's environmental and economic downsides from the birthplace of Silicon Valley to the four corners of the globe to which the industry recently has spread". Mazurek comments that this book is "told from the compelling and passionate perspective of workers and activists involved in these struggles".

== Regions covered ==
Chapters of the book cover "Made in China" electronics workers, Thailand's electronic sector's corporate social responsibility, electronic workers in India, workers in and around Central and Eastern Europe's semiconductor plants (Russia, Belarus, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Poland and Romania), Silicon Valley's Toxics' Coalition and workers' struggles, Mexico, Taiwan's Hsinchu Science Park, other issues from Taiwan, high-tech pollution in Japan, the electronic waste trade, e-waste in Delhi, producer responsibility laws in Sweden and Japan, among other themes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="931">'''''Cosmo Oro''''' (subtitle: ''Classici della Fantascienza'', "science fiction classics") was a series of [[science fiction]] books published in Italy by [[Editrice Nord]] starting from October 1970, usually consisting of re-prints. Authors translated (often with greater care for translation than in previous editions) included science fiction writers such as [[Philip K. Dick]], [[Jack Vance]], [[Robert A. Heinlein]], [[Frank Herbert]], [[Isaac Asimov]], [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner]], [[Alfred E. van Vogt]] and many others. 

''Cosmo Oro'' was paired by ''[[Cosmo Argento]]'', which normally published works previously unpublished in Italy. The series reduced substantially in quality and frequency of publication in the 2000s, and ceased publication with issue #203 in April 2002 (''[[The Andromeda Strain]]'' by [[Michael Crichton]]).

"'''Deadline'''" is a 1944 [[science fiction]] [[short story]] by American writer [[Cleve Cartmill]], first published in ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]''. The story described the then-secret [[atomic bomb]] in some detail. At that time the bomb was still under development and top secret, which prompted a visit by the [[FBI]].&lt;ref&gt;Cartmill, Cleve, "Deadline". ''Astounding Science Fiction'', Vol. XXXIII, No. l, pp. 154-178. New York: Street &amp; Smith, March 1944&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943, Cartmill suggested to [[John W. Campbell]], the then-editor of ''Astounding'', that he could write a story about a futuristic super-bomb.&lt;ref&gt;Silverberg, Robert, [http://www.asimovs.com/_issue_0310/ref.shtml Reflections: The Cleve Cartmill Affair: One] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618175748/http://www.asimovs.com/_issue_0310/ref.shtml |date=2013-06-18 }}, ''Asimov's Science Fiction''&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell liked the idea and supplied Cartmill with considerable background information gleaned from unclassified scientific journals, on the use of [[Uranium-235]] to make a [[nuclear fission]] device. The resulting story appeared in the issue of ''Astounding'' dated March 1944, which actually appeared early in February of that year.

By March 8 it had come to the attention of the [[Counterintelligence Corps (United States Army)|Counterintelligence Corps]], who saw many similarities between the technical details in the story and the research currently being undertaken in great secrecy at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]]. [[Gregory Benford]] describes the incident as told to him by [[Edward Teller]] in his autobiographical essay [http://www.gwern.net/docs/2002-radiance#old-legends "Old Legends"]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Coming three years later in the same magazine, Cleve Cartmill's "Deadline" provoked astonishment in the lunch table discussions at Los Alamos. It really did describe isotope separation and the bomb itself in detail, and raised as its principal plot pivot the issue the physicists were then debating among themselves: should the Allies use it? To the physicists from many countries clustered in the high mountain strangeness of New Mexico, cut off from their familiar sources of humanist learning, it must have seemed particularly striking that Cartmill described an allied effort, a joint responsibility laid upon many nations. &lt;br&gt;
Discussion of Cartmill's "Deadline" was significant. The story's detail was remarkable, its sentiments even more so. Did this rather obscure story hint at what the American public really thought about such a superweapon, or would think if they only knew? &lt;br&gt;
Talk attracts attention, Teller recalled a security officer who took a decided interest, making notes, saying little. In retrospect, it was easy to see what a wartime intelligence monitor would make of the physicists' conversations. Who was this guy Cartmill, anyway? Where did he get these details? Who tipped him to the isotope separation problem? "and that is why Mr. Campbell received his visitors."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fearing a security breach, the FBI began an investigation into Cartmill, Campbell, and some of their acquaintances (including [[Isaac Asimov]] and [[Robert A. Heinlein]]).&lt;ref&gt;Silverberg, Robert, [http://www.asimovs.com/_issue_0311/ref2.shtml Reflections: The Cleve Cartmill Affair: Two] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006183638/http://www.asimovs.com/_issue_0311/ref2.shtml |date=2014-10-06 }}, ''Asimov's Science Fiction''&lt;/ref&gt; It appears that the authorities eventually accepted the explanation that the story's material had been gleaned from unclassified sources, but as a precautionary measure they requested that Campbell should not publish any further stories about [[nuclear technology]] for the remainder of the war.

Campbell, in the meantime, had guessed from the number of ''Astounding'' subscribers who had suddenly moved to the Los Alamos area, that the US government probably had some sort of technical or scientific project ongoing there. He declined to volunteer this information to the FBI.

==Critical evaluation==
"Deadline" was described by Robert Silverberg as "a klutzy clunker" and by Cartmill himself as "that stinker".&lt;ref name = "Rogers"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rogers |first=Alva |title=A Requiem for Astounding |year=1964 |publisher=Advent |isbn=0-911682-16-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Silverberg, Cartmill also used the phrase "it stinks" when describing the story to a postman who was acting as an informer for [[military intelligence]].

However, the story was included in the anthologies ''The Best of Science Fiction'' (1946; ed. [[Groff Conklin]]), ''Science Fiction of the Forties'' (1978; ed. [[Joseph Olander]], [[Martin Harry Greenberg]], and [[Frederik Pohl]]), ''The Golden Age of Science Fiction'' (1980; ed. Groff Conklin), and ''The Great Science Fiction Stories: Volume 6, 1944''  (1981; ed. [[Isaac Asimov]] and [[Martin H. Greenberg]]), which suggests that these noted editors considered it as having some merit.&lt;ref&gt;See {{isfdb title|id=41500|title=Deadline|short=Yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12667">'''Disease gene identification''' is a process by which scientists identify the mutant genotypes responsible for an inherited [[genetic disorder]]. [[DNA mutations#Classification of mutation types|Mutations]] in these genes can include single nucleotide substitutions, single nucleotide additions/deletions, deletion of the entire gene, and other genetic abnormalities.

== Significance ==

Knowledge of which genes (when non-functional) cause which disorders will simplify diagnosis of patients and provide insights into the functional characteristics of the mutation.  The advent of modern-day [[DNA Sequencing#High-throughput sequencing|high-throughput sequencing]] technologies combined with insights provided from the growing field of [[genomics]] is resulting in more rapid disease gene identification, thus allowing scientists to identify more complex mutations.

[[File:Disease Gene Mapping with Multiple Chromosomes.jpg|thumb|Chromosomes on the left show possible disease gene locations (as identified by any of the below methods) for affected individuals. Red area in the 'composite chromosome' on the right signifies the overlap of these regions, and thus the most probable location of the disease gene]]

== Generic gene identification procedure ==

Disease gene identification techniques often follow the same overall procedure.  DNA is first collected from several patients who are believed to have the same genetic disease.  Then, their DNA samples are analyzed and screened to determine probable regions where the mutation could potentially reside.  These techniques are mentioned below.  These probable regions are then lined-up with one another and the overlapping region should contain the mutant gene.  If enough of the genome sequence is known, that region is searched for [[candidate gene]]s.  Coding regions of these genes are then sequenced until a mutation is discovered or another patient is discovered, in which case the analysis can be repeated, potentially narrowing down the region of interest. 
	
The differences between most disease gene identification procedures are in the second step (where DNA samples are analyzed and screened to determine regions in which the mutation could reside).

=== Pre-genomics techniques ===

Without the aid of the whole-genome sequences, pre-genomics investigations looked at select regions of the genome, often with only minimal knowledge of the gene sequences they were looking at.  Genetic techniques capable of providing this sort of information include [[Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism]] (RFLP) analysis and [[Microsatellite (genetics)|microsatellite]] analysis.

==== Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) ====

[[Loss of heterozygosity|Loss of heterozygosity (LOH)]] is a technique that can only be used to compare two samples from the same individual.  LOH analysis is often used when identifying cancer-causing [[oncogenes]] in that one sample consists of (mutant) tumor DNA and the other (control) sample consists of genomic DNA from non-cancerous cells from the same individual.  RFLPs and microsatellite markers provide patterns of DNA polymorphisms, which can be interpreted as residing in a [[heterozygous]] region or a [[homozygous]] region of the genome.  Provided that all individuals are affected with the same disease resulting from a manifestation of a deletion of a single copy of the same gene, all individuals will contain one region where their control sample is heterozygous but the mutant sample is homozygous - this region will contain the disease gene.&lt;ref name="pmid2649981"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Baker SJ, Fearon ER, Nigro JM, Hamilton SR, Preisinger AC, Jessup JM, vanTuinen P, Ledbetter DH, Barker DF, Nakamura Y, White R, Vogelstein B | title = Chromosome 17 deletions and p53 gene mutations in colorectal carcinomas | journal = Science | volume = 244 | issue = 4901 | pages = 217–21 |date=April 1989 | pmid = 2649981 | doi = 10.1126/science.2649981 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid10952779"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lee AS, Seo YC, Chang A, Tohari S, Eu KW, Seow-Choen F, McGee JO | title = Detailed deletion mapping at chromosome 11q23 in colorectal carcinoma | journal = Br. J. Cancer | volume = 83 | issue = 6 | pages = 750–5 |date=September 2000 | pmid = 10952779 | pmc = 2363538 | doi = 10.1054/bjoc.2000.1366 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-genomics techniques ===

With the advent of modern laboratory techniques such as [[DNA Sequencing#High-throughput sequencing|High-throughput sequencing]] and software capable of genome-wide analysis, sequence acquisition has become increasingly less expensive and time-consuming, thus providing significant benefits to science in the form of more efficient disease gene identification techniques.

==== Identity by descent mapping ====

[[Identity by descent]] (IBD) mapping generally uses [[single nucleotide polymorphism]] (SNP) arrays to survey known polymorphic sites throughout the genome of affected individuals and their parents and/or siblings, both affected and unaffected.  While these SNPs probably do not cause the disease, they provide valuable insight into the makeup of the genomes in question. A region of the genome is considered identical by descent if contiguous SNPs share the same genotype.  When comparing an affected individual to his/her affected sibling, all identical regions are recorded (ex. Shaded in red in above figure).  Given that an affected sibling and an unaffected sibling do not have the same disease phenotype, their DNA must by definition be different (barring the presence of a genetic or environmental [[Modifier gene|modifier]]).  Thus, the IBD mapping results can be further supplemented by removing any regions that are identical in both affected individuals and unaffected siblings.&lt;ref name="pmid21406686"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bell R, Herring SM, Gokul N, Monita M, Grove ML, Boerwinkle E, Doris PA | title = High-resolution identity by descent mapping uncovers the genetic basis for blood pressure differences between spontaneously hypertensive rat lines | journal = Circ Cardiovasc Genet | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 223–31 |date=June 2011 | pmid = 21406686 | pmc = 3116070 | doi = 10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.110.958934 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is then repeated for multiple families, thus generating a small, overlapping fragment, which theoretically contains the disease gene.

==== Homozygosity/autozygosity mapping ====

Homozygosity/Autozygosity mapping is a powerful technique, but is only valid when searching for a mutation segregating within a small, closed population.  Such a small population, possibly created by the [[founder effect]], will have a limited gene pool, and thus any inherited disease will probably be a result of two copies of the same mutation segregating on the same [[haplotype]].  Since affected individuals will probably be homozygous in the regions, looking at SNPs in a region is an adequate marker of regions of homozygosity and heterozygosity.  Modern day [[SNP array]]s are used to survey the genome and identify large regions of homozygosity.  Homozygous blocks in the genomes of affected individuals can then be laid on top of each other, and the overlapping region should contain the disease gene.&lt;ref name="pmid18926513"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sherman EA, Strauss KA, Tortorelli S, Bennett MJ, Knerr I, Morton DH, Puffenberger EG | title = Genetic mapping of glutaric aciduria, type 3, to chromosome 7 and identification of mutations in c7orf10 | journal = Am. J. Hum. Genet. | volume = 83 | issue = 5 | pages = 604–9 |date=November 2008 | pmid = 18926513 | pmc = 2668038 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajhg.2008.09.018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This analysis is often extended by analyzing [[autozygosity]], an extension of homozygosity, in the genomes of affected individuals.&lt;ref name="Broman_Weber_1999"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Broman KW, Weber JL | title = Long homozygous chromosomal segments in reference families from the centre d'Etude du polymorphisme humain | journal = Am. J. Hum. Genet. | volume = 65 | issue = 6 | pages = 1493–500 |date=December 1999 | pmid = 10577902 | pmc = 1288359 | doi = 10.1086/302661 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This can be accomplished by plotting a cumulative [[LOD score#LOD score method for estimating recombination frequency|LOD score]] alongside the overlaid blocks of homozygosity.  By taking into consideration the population allele frequencies for all SNPs via autozygosity mapping, the results of homozygosity can be confirmed.&lt;ref name="Broman_Weber_1999"/&gt;  Furthermore, if two suspicious regions appear as a result of homozygosity mapping, autozygosity mapping may be able to distinguish between the two (ex. If one block of homozygosity is a result of a very non-diverse region of the genome, the LOD score will be very low).

==== Genome-wide knockdown studies ====

Genome-wide [[RNA interference#Gene knockdown|knockdown]] studies are an example of the [[reverse genetics]] made possible by the acquisition of whole genome sequences, and the advent of genomics and gene-silencing technologies, mainly [[siRNA]] and [[deletion mapping]].  Genome-wide knockdown studies involve systematic knockdown or deletion of genes or segments of the genome.&lt;ref name="pmid19490893"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Luo J, Emanuele MJ, Li D, Creighton CJ, Schlabach MR, Westbrook TF, Wong KK, Elledge SJ | title = A genome-wide RNAi screen identifies multiple synthetic lethal interactions with the Ras oncogene | journal = Cell | volume = 137 | issue = 5 | pages = 835–48 |date=May 2009 | pmid = 19490893 | pmc = 2768667 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2009.05.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is generally done in [[prokaryotes]] or in a [[tissue culture]] environment due to the massive number of knockdowns that must be performed.&lt;ref name="Fortier_2010"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fortier S, Bilodeau M, Macrae T, Laverdure JP, Azcoitia V, Girard S, Chagraoui J, Ringuette N, Hébert J, Krosl J, Mayotte N, Sauvageau G | title = Genome-wide interrogation of Mammalian stem cell fate determinants by nested chromosome deletions | journal = PLoS Genet. | volume = 6 | issue = 12 | pages = e1001241 | year = 2010 | pmid = 21170304 | pmc = 3000362 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.1001241 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the systematic knockout is completed (and possibly confirmed by mRNA expression analysis), the phenotypic results of the knockdown/knockout can be observed.  Observation parameters can be selected to target a highly specific phenotype.&lt;ref name="Fortier_2010"/&gt;  The resulting dataset is then be queried for samples which exhibit phenotypes matching the disease in question – the gene(s) knocked down/out in said samples can then be considered candidate disease genes for the individual in question.

==== Whole exome sequencing ====

Whole [[exome sequencing]] is a brute-force approach that involves using modern day sequencing technology and [[sequence assembly|DNA sequence assembly]] tools to piece together all coding portions of the genome.  The sequence is then compared to a [[reference genome]] and any differences are noted.  After filtering out all known benign polymorphisms, synonymous changes, and [[intronic]] changes (that do not affect splice sites), only potentially pathogenic variants will be left.  This technique can be combined with other techniques to further exclude potentially pathogenic variants should more than one be identified.&lt;ref name="pmid22101681"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chen WJ, Lin Y, Xiong ZQ, Wei W, Ni W, Tan GH, Guo SL, He J, Chen YF, Zhang QJ, Li HF, Lin Y, Murong SX, Xu J, Wang N, Wu ZY | title = Exome sequencing identifies truncating mutations in PRRT2 that cause paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia | journal = Nat.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16996">'''Ecosystem valuation''' is an economic process which assigns a value (either monetary, biophysical, or other) to an [[ecosystem]] and/or its [[ecosystem services]]. By quantifying, for example, the human [[welfare]] benefits of a forest to reduce flooding and [[erosion]] while [[Carbon sequestration|sequestering carbon]], providing habitat for endangered species, and absorbing harmful [[chemicals]], such monetization ideally provides a tool for policy-makers and conservationists to evaluate management impacts and compare a [[Cost–benefit analysis|cost-benefit analysis]] of potential policies. However, such valuations are estimates, and involve the inherent quantitative uncertainty and philosophical debate of evaluating a range non-market costs and benefits.

==History and Economic Model==

=== History ===
Cost-benefit analyses and the generation of market [[Value (economics)|value]] have existed within the economic literature for centuries. However, in 1997, Robert Costanza, Distinguished University Professor of sustainability at [[Portland State University]], Oregon, was the first to estimate the worldwide worth of ecosystem services—bringing new attention to the field of ecosystem valuation. He and his colleagues calculated that such services were worth $33 trillion annually ($44 trillion present dollars).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Constanza|first=Robert|date=15 May 1997|title=The value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/387253a0|journal=Nature|volume=387|pages=253–260|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Costanza's fanfare, [[the World Bank]], three decades later, that "the benefits provided by natural ecosystems are both widely recognized and poorly understood.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/376691468780627185/pdf/308930PAPER0Ecosytem0worth01public1.pdf|title=How Much is an Ecosystem Worth? Assessing the Economic Value of Conservation|last=|first=|date=October 2004|website=The World Bank|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citing the importance of such knowledge to informed policy-making, in 2007, Environmental Ministers from the [[G8+5|G8 + 5]] nations agreed to both publicly call for and begin to undertake the calculation of global ecosystem benefits, conservation costs, and the opportunity costs of developing such ecosystems. The resulting watershed initiative and ongoing project is [[The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity]] (TEEB).

In the United States, the President's Council on Science and Technology suggested in 2011 that the “U.S. government should institute and fund a Quadrennial Ecosystems Services Trends (QuEST) Assessment” that studying trends in ecosystem performance, quality, and value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/pcast_sustaining_environmental_capital_report.pdf|title=Report to the President. Sustaining Environmental Capital: Protecting Society and the Economy|last=|first=|date=July 2011|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic Models: Values, Costs, and Value Methodology ===
Ecosystem valuation attempts to capture the range of benefits and costs contained within a complicated natural web with a range of economic methodologies.

Ecological systems provide four general categories of services: '''provisioning''' (e.g. fish to eat, timber to sell), '''regulatory''', '''supporting''', and '''cultural''' (e.g. ecosystems supporting indigenous gathering techniques, or supplies for traditional clothing).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holzman|first=David C.|date=April 2012|title=Accounting for Nature's Benefits: The Dollar Value of Ecosystem Services|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=120|issue=4|pages=a152–a157|doi=10.1289/ehp.120-a152|pmc=3339477|pmid=22469778}}&lt;/ref&gt; See Figure 1. for a mangrove-specific example of this complex subject.
[[File:EnvironmentalServicesPie.jpg|thumb|Figure 1. Example of ecosystem services range for mangrove habitat]]

These four types of services can then provide two basic categories of value: the use and [[Use value|use]] and [[Non-use value|non-use]] categories. Environmental economists have further separated categorizes for which individuals are willing to pay:
* '''''Direct-use value.'''''
** The simplest form of ecosystem valuation for orthodox environmental economists, this translates the direct [[ecological yield]] as it would be on [[commodity market]]s: e.g. the value of water, timber, fish, or other commodities if immediately developed and sold at market price.Thus, an exchange value or 'price' is associated with the objects of value, regarded as [[natural capital]], associated with ecosystems and this may be based on the ability of a system to produce yields each year that are exchangeable in operating markets and have existing exchange prices.
* '''''Indirect use value''''' attributed to indirect utilization of ecosystem services, through the positive [[externalities]] that ecosystems provide.
** The World Bank explains that these values are "derived from ecosystem services that provide benefits outside the ecosystem itself. Examples include natural water filtration which often benefits people far downstream, the storm protection function of mangrove forests which benefits costal properties and infrastructure, and carbon sequestration which benefits the entire global community by abating climate change."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* [[Option value (cost–benefit analysis)|''Option value'']] attributed to preserving the option to utilize ecosystem services in the future.
* ''[[Existence value]]'' attributed to the pure existence of an ecosystem.
* ''[[Altruism|Altruistic]] value'' based on the welfare the ecosystem may give other people.
* ''[[Bequest value]]'' based on the welfare the ecosystem may give future generations.
Given these types of potential ecological values, economists utilize a variety of methods to calculate those market values and measure [[Non-market economics|non-market]] values. Standard environmental economic methods are used to place a monetary value on ecosystem services where there are no market prices. These include "stated preference" methods and "revealed preference" methods. Stated preference methods, such as the [[contingent valuation]] method ask people for their [[willingness to pay]] for a certain ecosystem (service). Revealed preference methods, such as [[hedonic]] pricing and the [[travel cost method]], use a relation with a market good or service to estimate the willingness-to-pay for the service. Applying such preference based approaches has been criticized as a means of deriving the value of ecosystems and biodiversity and for avoiding deliberation, justification and judgment in making choices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clivespash.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Spash_Ecosystem_Value_EV_2008.pdf Spash, C.L. 2008. How much is that ecosystem in the window? The one with the bio-diverse trail. Environmental Values, vol. 17, no. 2, 259-284]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Valuation Results==
While the literature is still emerging, many important studies have resulting in striking valuations.

One academic paper by de Groot et. al., which synthesized more than 300 scholarly works collectively evaluating the 10 main [[biome]]s, "shows that the total value of ecosystem services is considerable and ranges between 490 int$/year for the total bundle of ecosystem services that can potentially be provided by an ‘average’ hectare of open oceans to almost 350,000 int$/year for the potential services of an ‘average’ hectare of [[coral reef]]s."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2012-07-01|title=Global estimates of the value of ecosystems and their services in monetary units|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212041612000101|journal=Ecosystem Services|language=en|volume=1|issue=1|pages=50–61|doi=10.1016/j.ecoser.2012.07.005|issn=2212-0416|last1=De Groot|first1=Rudolf|last2=Brander|first2=Luke|last3=Van Der Ploeg|first3=Sander|last4=Costanza|first4=Robert|last5=Bernard|first5=Florence|last6=Braat|first6=Leon|last7=Christie|first7=Mike|last8=Crossman|first8=Neville|last9=Ghermandi|first9=Andrea|last10=Hein|first10=Lars|last11=Hussain|first11=Salman|last12=Kumar|first12=Pushpam|last13=McVittie|first13=Alistair|last14=Portela|first14=Rosimeiry|last15=Rodriguez|first15=Luis C|last16=Ten Brink|first16=Patrick|last17=Van Beukering|first17=Pieter}}&lt;/ref&gt; This potential benefit can take many forms depending on the degree of exploitation and such exploitation's sustainability, but can result, for example, in large [[Ecotourism|ecotourist]] revenues for local communities, protection from storm destruction, or profit for an international lumber company.

Furthermore, de Groot et. al. find that most of their paper's calculated value is "outside the market and best considered as non-tradable public benefits. The continued over-exploitation of ecosystems thus comes at the expense of the livelihood of the poor and future generations."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity]] (TEEB), in one of its first large, cumulative reports, also found that ecosystem services start at roughly $100/hectare/year for open ocean, and top off to more than $1,000,000/hectare/year for the most lucrative coral reefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.teebweb.org/publication/the-economics-of-ecosystems-and-biodiversity-teeb-for-water-and-wetlands/|title=The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB) For Water and Wetlands|last=|first=|date=February 2013|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond biome "price tags," these environmental valuations can explore quite complex policy questions. For example, the [[Copenhagen Consensus Center|Copenhagen Consensus]] [[think tank]] calculated that stemming the loss of coral reefs by 50 percent by 2030 would return more than $24 for every dollar spent. The Consensus' founder, [[Bjørn Lomborg|Bjorn Lomborg]], explains that ''"coral reefs, which both act as fishery hatcheries and fishing resources while storing abundant numbers of species. At the same time, coral reefs possess an amazing beauty, which both shows up in large tourism revenues but also in most individuals saying they are willing to pay a certain amount to make sure they continue to exist for our grand children. … [Programs to preserve 50% more coral reef by 2030] cost about $3 billion per year but the total benefits likely run to at least $72, or about $24 dollars back for every dollar invested."''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/bjorn-lomborg/biodiversity-whats-worth-_b_6081462.html|title=Biodiversity: What's Worth Saving?|last=Lomborg|first=Bjørn|date=2014-10-31|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As another example, the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)]] manages the Integrated Valuation Environmental Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) Natural Capital Project. This open-source tool—although geared towards policy-makers, advocates, and scientists—allows anyone to interact with a map quantifying "trade offs between alternative management choices" and identifying "areas where investment in natural capital can enhance human development and conservation.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://coast.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/tools/invest.html|title=Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST)|website=coast.noaa.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Payment for Environmental Services (PES) ===
After (and, sometimes, before) evaluating the ecosystem costs and benefits, some programs have attempted to internalize those values with specific programs providing [[Payment for ecosystem services|payments for environmental services]]. Costa Rica paid about $42/hectare for landowners to preserve forests;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sánchez-Azofeifa|first=G. Arturo|last2=Pfaff|first2=Alexander|last3=Robalino|first3=Juan Andres|last4=Boomhower|first4=Judson P.|date=October 2007|title=Costa Rica's payment for environmental services program: intention, implementation, and impact|journal=Conservation Biology|volume=21|issue=5|pages=1165–1173|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2007.00751.x|issn=1523-1739|pmid=17883482|hdl=10161/6955}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2010 Norway began paying Indonesia a total of $1 billion to mitigate deforestation;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.redd-monitor.org/2017/12/28/after-seven-years-norways-us1-billion-redd-deal-in-indonesia-is-still-not-stopping-deforestation/|title=After seven years, Norway's US$1 billion REDD deal in Indonesia is still not stopping deforestation {{!}} REDD-Monitor|website=www.redd-monitor.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; China responded to 1998 floods with payments targeting deforestation and soil erosion;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and many other programs large and small.

== Controversies with and Limits to Ecosystem Valuations ==
From an academic perspective, although scholarly research is quite rapidly adding to this field of understanding, many knowledge gaps still remain. For example, there is an inherent uncertainty in attempting to quantify non-market goods. As pointed to by de Groot et. al., many environmental goods (such as clean air and biodiversity) are simply not traded in established markets. In addition, many environmental goods may be [[Non-rival good|non-rival]], [[Excludability|non-excludable]], and even inseparable goods with multiple value options further complicating any valuation.

From an ethical and philosophical perspective, too, ecosystem valuation is far from uncontroversial. Arguments about the non-market valuation of ecosystem can be found by referring to [[environmental ethics]] and [[deep ecology]].

Since animals do not put explicit prices on ecosystems they use, but do behave as if they are valuable, e.g. by selecting one territory vs. another, defending their territories, etc., it is mostly a matter of definition whether ecology should include valuation as an issue.  It may be [[anthropocentric]] to do so, since "valuation" more clearly refers to a human perception rather than being an "objective" attribute of the system perceived.  Ecology itself is also human perception, and such related concepts as a [[food chain]] are constructed by humans to help them understand ecosystems.  In many cases by those who hold that markets and pricing exist independently of any individual human observers and "users", and especially those who deem markets to be "out of control", '''ecosystem valuation''' is considered a (marginal, ignored) part of economics.  Others argue that [[natural capital]] is an economic concept that is at least as viable as financial capital, which itself is determined on subjective valuation.  Some even suggest that valuation of ecosystem services is more cogent than financial valuation, as the ecosystem would continue after the collapse of the economy, while the inverse is not valid.

In addition, many fascinating questions about where ecosystem benefits go, and who should pay for those benefits, is an ongoing political debate. In one Washington city, residents now pay a water bill in order for the town to buy and restore land adjacent to the municipal water source; and international examples of evaluating and paying for services is no less a fascinating field of ongoing development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hcn.org/blogs/goat/the-dollar-sign-in-nature|title=How much money is a healthy ecosystem worth?|access-date=2018-03-05|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its main activities are reflected on the '''edge.org''' website, edited by publisher and businessman [[John Brockman (literary agent)|John Brockman]]. The site is a critically noted&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Naughton|first=John|date=8 January 2012|title=John Brockman: the man who runs the world's smartest website|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jan/08/john-brockman-edge-interview-john-naughton|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=23 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schappell|first=Elissa Schappell|date=|title=A Mental Spring Cleaning|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2000/01/arts-and-labor|newspaper=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|accessdate=23 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Upbin|first=Brian|date=5 October 2011|title=Forbes Is Seeking Edge Thinkers|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/bruceupbin/2011/10/05/forbes-is-seeking-edge-thinkers/#667a5e284ed4|newspaper=[[Forbes]]|accessdate=23 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[online magazine]] exploring [[scientific]] and [[intellectual]] ideas.

==Edge.org==

A long-running feature on Edge is the Annual Question, which gathers many short essays on topical questions from Brockman's broad network of thought leaders in philosophy and science; these essays are usually published collectively as a book shortly thereafter.

Many of the feature articles on Edge are structured as video interviews with a prominent figure in some scientific field (such as [[Daniel Kahneman]] or [[Steven Pinker]]) discussing his or her recent research or mental preoccupations, in a free-flowing spiel from which the interviewer—often Brockman himself—is largely absent. This is usually accompanied by a full transcript which includes more material than the video portion (which is typically edited for brevity, down to less than an hour in length).

Because Brockman functions primarily as a literary agent, subjects featured on Edge are in most cases lucid communicators, even when relating new developments in highly specialized research areas. The lucid exposition of challenging and novel science is Edge's primary calling card.

A less common format is video conference proceedings or Master Class round-table seminars on a set subject matter, such as [[Philip E. Tetlock]]'s seminar on [[superforecasting]] from 2015, or [[Richard Thaler]]'s seminar on [[behavioural psychology]] from 2008.

Edge adds new content relatively infrequently, with no set schedule, apart from the Annual Question.

==''The Third Culture''==
''[[The Third Culture]]'' is the growing movement towards (re)integration of literary and scientific thinking and is a nod toward British scientist [[C. P. Snow]]'s concept of [[The Two Cultures|the two cultures]] of science and the humanities. [[John Brockman (literary agent)|John Brockman]] published a book of the same name whose themes are continued at the Edge website. Here, scientists and others are invited to contribute their thoughts in a manner readily accessible to non-specialist readers. In doing so, leading thinkers are able to communicate directly with each other and the public without the intervention of middlemen such as journalists and journal editors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= John Brockman |title=''The Third Culture: Beyond the Scientific Revolution''| publisher= Simon &amp; Schuster | year=1995 | ISBN = 0-684-82344-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many areas of academic work are incorporated, including [[genetics]], [[physics]], [[mathematics]], [[psychology]], [[evolutionary biology]], [[philosophy]] and [[computing technology]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4006">In [[mathematics]], '''Euclid numbers''' are [[integer]]s of the form {{nowrap|1=''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;# + 1}}, where ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;# is the ''n''th [[primorial]], i.e. the product of the first ''n'' [[prime number]]s. They are named after the [[ancient Greek]] [[mathematician]] [[Euclid]], in connection with [[Euclid's theorem]] that there are infinitely many prime numbers.

==Examples==
For example, the first three primes are 2, 3, 5; their product is 30, and the corresponding Euclid number is 31.

The first few Euclid numbers are [[3 (number)|3]], [[7 (number)|7]], [[31 (number)|31]], [[211 (number)|211]], 2311, 30031, 510511, 9699691, 223092871, 6469693231, 200560490131, ... {{OEIS|id=A006862}}.

==History==
It is sometimes falsely stated that [[Euclid's theorem|Euclid's celebrated proof]] of the infinitude of [[prime number]]s relied on these numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hardy and Catherine Woodgold, "Prime Simplicity", ''[[Mathematical Intelligencer]]'', volume 31, number 4, fall 2009, pages 44&amp;ndash;52.&lt;/ref&gt;  Euclid did not begin with the assumption that the set of all primes is finite.  Rather, he said: consider any finite set of primes (he did not assume that it contained only the first ''n'' primes, e.g. it could have been {{nowrap|{3, 41, 53}{{null}}}}) and reasoned from there to the conclusion that at least one prime exists that is not in that set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Proposition 20 |work= |publisher= |date= |url=http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookIX/propIX20.html |doi= |accessdate= |quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Nevertheless, Euclid's argument, applied to the set of the first ''n'' primes, shows that the ''n''th Euclid number has a prime factor that is not in this set.

==Properties==
Not all Euclid numbers are prime.
''E''&lt;sub&gt;''6''&lt;/sub&gt; = 13# + 1 = 30031 = 59 &amp;times; 509 is the first composite Euclid number.

Every Euclid number is congruent to 3 mod 4 since the primorial of which it is composed is twice the product of only odd primes and thus congruent to 2 modulo 4. This property implies that no Euclid number can be a [[Square number|square]].

For all {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 3}} the last digit of ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is 1, since {{nowrap|''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; − 1}} is divisible by 2 and 5. In other words, since all primorial numbers greater than ''E''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; have 2 and 5 as prime factors, they are divisible by 10, thus all ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;3&lt;/sub&gt;+1 have a final digit of 1.

==Unsolved problems==
{{unsolved|mathematics|Are there an infinite number of prime Euclid numbers?}}
It is not known whether there is an infinite number of prime Euclid numbers ([[primorial prime]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|A006862|name=Euclid numbers}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is also unknown whether every Euclid number is a [[squarefree number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Computational Recreations in Mathematica|first=Ilan|last=Vardi|publisher=Addison-Wesley|year=1991|isbn=9780201529890|pages=82–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{-}}
{{unsolved|mathematics|Is every Euclid number squarefree?}}

==Generalization==
A '''Euclid number of the second kind''' (also called '''Kummer number''') is an integer of the form ''E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''# − 1, where ''p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;#'' is the nth primorial. The first few such numbers are:
:1, 5, 29, 209, 2309, 30029, 510509, 9699689, 223092869, 6469693229, 200560490129, ... {{OEIS|id=A057588}}

As with the Euclid numbers, it is not known whether there are infinitely many prime Kummer numbers. The first of these numbers to be composite is [[209 (number)|209]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|A125549|name=Composite Kummer numbers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Flat Eric''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional]] [[puppet]] character created by [[Mr. Oizo|Quentin Dupieux]] from [[Levi's]] [[Television advertisement|commercials]] for [[Sta-Prest]] One Crease Denim Clothing, built by [[Jim Henson's Creature Shop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/299803.stm |title=Entertainment &amp;#124; Flat Eric's cruise to the top |publisher=BBC News |date=1999-03-20 |accessdate=2011-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; His name comes from an idea for a commercial that included having a car run over his head and flattening it. The idea was not used, but the name stuck. In the commercials, Flat Eric would ride with his friend Angel (played by Philippe Petit) around California, evading the police as a wanted criminal.&lt;ref name="guardian1608"&gt;{{cite news|author=Carolyne Ellis |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/1999/aug/16/mondaymediasection1 |title=Eric exposed &amp;#124; Media |publisher=The Guardian |date= 2000-08-29|accessdate=2011-10-14 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Flat Eric was based on a puppet called Stéphane that was similar, but with ears and the hands were fixed.&lt;ref name="utalkmarketing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utalkmarketing.com/pages/Article.aspx?ArticleID=15018 |title=Advertising icon Flat Eric to be resurrected - Marketing News |publisher=UTalkMarketing |date=2009-08-20 |accessdate=2011-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stéphane appeared in some short films by Mr. Oizo (including a video for the track [[M-Seq]]), and had a small cult following in the United Kingdom and France.&lt;ref name="utalkmarketing"/&gt; In 1999, Levi's decided to build a television commercial campaign around the puppet, to be directed by Oizo. The character was renamed Eric, a more "international name", in contrast to the original French name Stéphane.{{fact|date=October 2011}}

He was made by Janet Knechtel for [[Jim Henson's Creature Shop]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Phillips |first=Dom |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/1999/mar/07/flateric.advertising |title=No strings attached &amp;#124; Media &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date= 2001-03-31|accessdate=2011-10-14 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the United Kingdom, and was performed by [[Drew Massey]] for all the Levi's commercials. The Levi's adverts took three days to shoot.&lt;ref name="Heat"/&gt; The original short films made with Stéphane cost around 15,000 [[franc]]s to produce.&lt;ref name="Heat"/&gt; The two Levi's ads cost around two or three million francs each.&lt;ref name="Heat"/&gt; The rights to the character were retained by Oizo and production company Partizan.&lt;ref name="utalkmarketing"/&gt;

'''Gas electron diffraction''' (GED) is one of the applications of [[electron diffraction]] techniques. The target of this method is the determination of the structure of [[gaseous molecules]] i.e. the [[Molecular geometry|geometrical arrangement of the atoms]] from which a molecule is built up.

Diffraction occurs because the [[wavelength]] of electrons accelerated by a potential of a few thousand volts is of the same order of magnitude as internuclear distances in molecules. The principle is the same as that of other electron diffraction methods such as [[Low-energy electron diffraction|LEED]] and [[RHEED]], but the obtainable diffraction pattern is considerably weaker than those of LEED and RHEED because the density of the target is about one thousand times smaller. Since the orientation of the target molecules relative to the electron beams is random, the internuclear distance information obtained is one-dimensional.  Thus only relatively simple molecules can be completely structurally characterized by electron diffraction in the gas phase. It is possible to combine information obtained from other sources, such as [[rotational spectroscopy|rotational spectra]], NMR spectroscopy or high-quality quantum-mechanical calculations with electron diffraction data, if the latter are not sufficient to determine the molecule's structure completely. 

The total scattering intensity in GED is given as a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of the [[momentum]] transfer, which is defined as the difference between the [[wave vector]] of the incident [[electron]] beam and that of the scattered electron beam and has the [[reciprocal dimension]] of [[length]]. The total scattering intensity is composed of two parts: the [[atomic scattering intensity]] and [[the molecular scattering intensity]]. The former decreases [[monotonically]] and contains no information about the molecular structure. The latter has [[sinusoidal]] modulations as a result of the [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] of the scattering [[spherical waves]] generated by the scattering from the atoms included in the target molecule. The interferences reflect the distributions of the atoms composing the molecules, so the molecular structure is determined from this part.

The [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] spacecraft was the first American craft that could dock to another in space.

It used a non-androgynous docking mechanism.

The docking system was not hollow, so there was no ability to transfer people or material between the craft; the docking system merely locked two craft together.

[[File:Acrocephalus melanopogon ad03 CB.jpg|thumb|right|Another species dropped from the list was the moustached warbler.]]

The '''Hastings Rarities''' affair is a case of statistically demonstrated [[ornithology|ornithological]] [[fraud]] that misled the bird world for decades in the twentieth century. The discovery of the long-running hoax shocked ornithologists.

The Hastings Rarities were a series of records of rare birds added to the British list on the basis of hundreds of reports, supported by preserved specimens, from [[George Bristow (ornithologist)|George Bristow]] (1863–1947), a [[taxidermy|taxidermist]] and [[gunsmith]] of [[St Leonards-on-Sea]], a town on the south coast of England. His reports were made between 1892 and 1930.

In August 1962, the statistician [[John Nelder]] published an analysis in the journal ''[[British Birds (magazine)|British Birds]]'', demonstrating that the records were unlikely to be genuine. This was supported by an editorial in the same issue. 29 bird species or subspecies were dropped from the [[List of birds of Great Britain|British List]]. On the basis of later records from elsewhere in Britain, most have subsequently been readmitted.

==History==

Two articles in the August 1962 issue of the journal ''[[British Birds (magazine)|British Birds]]'', one a statistical examination by [[John Nelder]], the other an editorial by [[Edward Max Nicholson|Max Nicholson]] and [[James Ferguson-Lees]], made a case using several statistical measures that a series of records of birds collected within a {{convert|20|mi|adj=on}} radius of [[Hastings]], in [[Kent]] and [[Sussex]], south-east [[England]], between 1892 and 1930, should be treated with suspicion. As a result, 29 bird species or subspecies were dropped from the [[List of birds of Great Britain|British List]] (though most of these have subsequent acceptable records from elsewhere in Britain) and 550 records, relating to 80–90 species, were rejected.  Although some of these rejected records were undoubtedly good ones, there was no easy way of distinguishing them.

Although doubts had been expressed privately for many years about the provenance of many specimens from the Hastings area, until the articles appeared there had been no systematic investigation of the records.  The case made in ''British Birds'' was essentially [[statistics|statistical]], concerning the unlikelihood of so many records of rare or new species being made within a limited area and limited time period when compared with a similar area and with earlier and later time periods.  However, most records recommended for rejection were of specimens that had passed through the hands of [[George Bristow (ornithologist)|George Bristow]] (1863–1947), a [[taxidermy|taxidermist]] and [[gunsmith]] of [[St Leonards-on-Sea]] in the borough of Hastings.

It was clear that Bristow was suspected of having been the perpetrator of a series of frauds, carried out from the 1890s over at least the first two, and possibly three, decades of the 20th century, through importing bird specimens from outside the British Isles, and selling them to wealthy ornithologists, such as [[Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild|Walter Rothschild]], as having been procured from the Hastings area.  John Nelder later estimated that Bristow had made about £7000, a considerable amount of money at the time, from this scheme.

The deletion of several taxa from the list had considerable repercussions.  As the suspect records covered nearly four decades, many had been incorporated into books about birds in Britain, including major ornithological reference works, and there was resistance from some ornithologists to accepting the deletions.  [[David Armitage Bannerman|David Bannerman]], in the late stages of completing his monumental ''The Birds of the British Isles'' (12 vols, 1933–63), decided to maintain his faith in the validity of the controversial Hastings records and ignore the decision to delete them from the list.  Since then, most of the species dropped have been readmitted to the list on the basis of reliable subsequent records.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2434">'''Illusion optics''' is an electromagnetic theory that can change the optical appearance of an object to be exactly like that of another virtual object, i.e. an [[illusion]], such as turning the look of an apple into that of a banana. [[Invisibility]] is a special case of illusion optics, which turns objects into illusions of free space. The concept and numerical proof of illusion optics was proposed in 2009 based on [[transformation optics]] in the field of [[metamaterial]]s.&lt;ref name=ext-clk-2009-journal2&gt;

Illusion optics proves that the optical responses or properties of a space containing any objects can be changed to be exactly those of a virtual space but containing arbitrary virtual objects (illusions) by using a passive ''illusion optics device'' composed of materials or metamaterials with specific parameters and shape. For example, a dielectric spoon was numerically shown to exhibit the scattering properties of a metallic cup by using an illusion optics device in the seminal paper.&lt;ref name=ext-clk-2009-journal2/&gt;

Such illusion effects do not rely on the direction and form of incident waves. However, due to dispersion limitation of specific material parameters, the functionality of illusion optics device only works in a narrow band of frequency.

==Difference with optical illusion==
Unlike [[optical illusion]]s that utilize the misinterpretation of human brain to create illusionary perception different from the physical measurement, illusion optics changes the optical response or properties of objects, i.e. the physical measurements.

A '''kymograph''' (from Greek κῦμα, swell or wave + γραφή, writing; also called a '''kymographion''') is a device that draws a graphical representation of spatial position over time in which a spatial axis represents time. It basically consists of a revolving drum wrapped with a sheet of paper on which a [[stylus]] moves back and forth recording perceived changes of phenomena such as motion or pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.psych.utoronto.ca/museum/verticalkym.htm|title=Vertical Kymograph|last=University of Toronto Scientific Instruments Collection|first=|date=|website=www.psych.utoronto.ca|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/broughttolife/objects/display?id=11528|title=Kymograph, London, England, 1925-1935|last=Science Museum|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The kymograph was initially a mechanical and hydraulic device, invented by German [[physiologist]] [[Carl Ludwig]] in the 1840s, and found its first use as a means to monitor [[blood pressure]]. The blood pressure was conveyed by hydraulics and levers to move a stylus that scratched a white trace into soot-covered paper on the revolving drum. Time is represented by the drum's rotation rate, and was recorded by a further stylus driven by a clock or tuning fork. The kymograph almost immediately became the central instrument in physiology and physiology education. Throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, researchers and technicians devised many improvements to the device, plus numerous new sensory components to measure a wide range of physiological phenomena such as breathing, muscle movement, speech. New detection and registration systems included electrical and electronic methods, and plotted in ink.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kwan|first=Alistair|date=|title="Do not kill guinea pig before setting up apparatus": the kymograph's lost educational context|url=http://teorievedy.flu.cas.cz/index.php/tv/article/view/345|journal=Teorie Vědy|volume=38|pages=301–335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kymographs were also used outside medical science to measure atmospheric pressure, tuning fork vibrations, the functioning of steam engines, animal habits and the movement of molecules in cells.

== Kymography in experimental zoology ==
Kymograph is generally used to study the effects of [[xenobiotics]] on tissue preparations. It is a standalone recording apparatus used alongside other apparatus such as organ bath. Writing levers are used to trace the recording from muscle contractions. Some of the commonly used writing levers are simple lever, frontal writing lever and starling heart lever to name a few. These writing levers are connected to a [[wikt:fulcrum|fulcrum]] which are found on secondary apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/949350586|title=Fundamentals of experimental pharmacology|last=D)|first=M.N.

His only preserved writings are some notes contained in manuscripts of [[Plato]]'s dialogues. He has been called a "true [[Polymath|Renaissance man]]"&lt;ref name=rautman&gt;Marcus Louis Rautman (2006), ''Daily Life in the Byzantine Empire'' (Greenwood Publishing Group, {{ISBN|0-313-32437-9}}), 294&amp;ndash;95.&lt;/ref&gt; and "the cleverest man in Byzantium in the 9th century".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=History of the Pianola|publisher=Pianola Institute|url=http://www.pianola.org/history/history_mechanical.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[archbishop of Thessalonica]] and later became the head of the [[Magnaura|Magnaura School]] of philosophy in [[Constantinople]],&lt;ref name="the_oxford_illustrated_history_of_medieval_europe_a01"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Holmes | first1 = George | title = The Oxford illustrated history of medieval Europe | year = 1990 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford  | isbn = 978-0-19-285435-3 | page = 52 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where he taught [[Organon|Aristotelian logic]].

== Life ==
Leo was born in [[Thessaly]], a cousin of the [[Patriarch of Constantinople]], [[John VII of Constantinople|John the Grammarian]]. He was probably at least in part of [[Armenians|Armenian]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;Штокало И. З., ''История отечественной математики. Том 1.

Evans, W. D. Wixom, ''The Glory of Byzantium: Art and Culture of the Middle Byzantine Era, A.D. 843—1261.'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, 1997, p. 351&lt;/ref&gt; In his youth he was educated at Constantinople, but he travelled to the monasteries of [[Andros]], where he could obtain rare manuscripts and was taught mathematics by an old monk.&lt;ref name="browning"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Browning |first=Robert |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1964 |month= |title=Byzantine Scholarship |journal=Past and Present |volume=28 |issue= |pages=7–8 |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= |doi=10.1093/past/28.1.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He originally taught privately in obscurity in Constantinople. The story goes that when one of his students&lt;ref&gt;According to the Pseudo-Symeon, this student was Boïditzes, who [[Sack of Amorium|betrayed]] [[Amorium]] to the caliph.&lt;/ref&gt; was captured during the [[Byzantine&amp;ndash;Arab Wars]], the [[Caliph of Baghdad|Caliph]] [[al-Mamun]] was so impressed by his knowledge of mathematics that he offered Leo great riches to come to [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Joseph Genesius]] and Theophanes Continuatus between 829 and 833; Symeon the Logothete makes the caliph [[al-Mutasim]] and puts the invitation after the Islamic conquest of Amorium in the fall of 838, cf. {{cite journal |last=Treadgold |first=Warren T. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1979 |month= |title=The Chronological Accuracy of the ''Chronicle'' of Symeon the Logothete for the Years 813&amp;ndash;845 |journal=[[Dumbarton Oaks Papers]] |volume=33 |issue= |pages=162 |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= |doi=10.2307/1291437}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leo took the letter from the caliph to the [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Theophilos (emperor)|Theophilos]], who, impressed by his international repute, conferred on him a school (''ekpaideutērion'') in either the Magnaura or the church of the [[Forty Martyrs of Sebaste|Forty Martyrs]].&lt;ref&gt;Symeon says the Magnaura, Continuatus the Forty Martyrs (Treadgold, "Chronological Accuracy ", 186).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the version of the story recorded by [[Theophanes Continuatus]], the caliph, upon receiving Leo's letter of refusal, sent a letter requesting answers to some difficult questions of geometry and astrology, which Leo obliged. Al-Mamun then offered two thousands pounds of gold and a perpetual peace to Theophilos, if only he could borrow Leo's services briefly; the request was declined. The emperor then honoured Leo by having John the Grammarian consecrate him [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] of [[Thessalonica]], which post he held from the spring of 840 to 843. There is a discrepancy in this account, however, in that the caliph died in 833. It has been suggested that either the connection between the caliph's final letter and Leo's appointment as metropolitan is in error, or the caliph in question was actually al-Mutasim. This latter option squares with the account of [[Symeon the Logothete]], who makes Leo teach at the Magnaura from late 838 to early 840 and was paid handsomely.&lt;ref&gt;Treadgold, "Chronological Accuracy ", 172.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leo, an iconoclast sometimes accused of paganism, lost his metropolitancy with the end of the [[Byzantine Iconoclasm|Iconoclasm]] in 843.&lt;ref&gt;Warren T. Treadgold (1997), ''A history of the Byzantine state and society'' (Stanford University Press), 447.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, he delivered a sermon favourable of icons within months of Theophilos' death.&lt;ref&gt;Warren T. Treadgold (1988), ''The Byzantine Revival, 780&amp;ndash;842'' (Stanford University Press), 372.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 855, Leo was appointed at the head of a newly established Magnaura School by [[Bardas]].&lt;ref&gt;Treadgold, "Chronological Accuracy ", 187, believes, on the basis of the Logothete's account, that this occurred in 843 and was a re-founding of Theophilos' school.&lt;/ref&gt; He was renowned for his philosophical, mathematical, medical, scientific, literary, philological, astronomic, and astrological learning, and was patronised by [[Theoktistos]] and befriended by [[Photios I of Constantinople]].&lt;ref name="Tougher1997"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Reign of Leo VI (886&amp;ndash;912): Politics and People |last=Tougher |first=Shaun |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1997 |publisher=Brill |location=Leiden |isbn=90-04-10811-4 |page=113 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vlasto1970"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Entry of the Slavs into Christendom: An Introduction to the Medieval History of the Slavs |last=Vlasto |first=A.

Leo has been credited with a [[Byzantine beacon system|system of beacons]] (an optical telegraph) stretching across [[Asia Minor]] from [[Cilicia]] to Constantinople, which gave advance warning of Arab raids, as well as diplomatic communication.&lt;ref name="Treadgold1979"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Treadgold |first=Warren T. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1979 |month= |title=The Revival of Byzantine Learning and the Revival of the Byzantine State |journal=The American Historical Review |volume=84 |issue=5 |pages=1245–1266 [p. 1259] |doi=10.2307/1861467|accessdate= |quote= |publisher=American Historical Association |jstor=1861467 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Leo also invented several [[automata]], such as trees with moving birds, roaring lions, and a levitating imperial throne.&lt;ref name=rautman/&gt; The throne was in operation a century later, when [[Liutprand of Cremona]] witnessed it during his visit to Constantinople.&lt;ref name="Safran1998"&gt;{{cite book |title=Heaven on Earth: Art and the Church in Byzantium |last=Safran |first=Linda |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1998 |publisher=Penn State Press |location=Pittsburgh |isbn=0-271-01670-1 |page=30 |url= }} Records Liutprand's description.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed discussion of Leo's telegraph and his automata, see Leone Montagnini (2002), [http://www.armoniedeldisordine.it/opere.html#02i "Leone il Matematico, un anello mancante nella storia della scienza",] ''Studi sull'Oriente Cristiano'', 6 (2), 89–108.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Works ==
Most of Leo's writings have been lost. He wrote book-length works, poems, and many [[epigrams]],&lt;ref&gt;Among them, worthy of special mention are some centos preserved in the Palatine Anthology, see Prieto Domínguez, Óscar (2011), ''De Alieno Nostrum: el Centón profano en el mundo griego''. Estudios filológicos, 328. Salamanca: Ediciones Universidad de Salamanca. {{ISBN|9788478002085}}, p. 120-179.&lt;/ref&gt; and was also a compiler, who brought together a wide range of philosophical, medical, and astronomic texts. His library can at least partially be reconstructed: [[Archimedes]], [[Euclid]], [[Plato]], [[Paul of Alexandria]], [[Theon of Alexandria]], [[Proclus]], [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], [[Apollonius of Perga]], the lost ''Mechanics'' of Quirinus and Marcellus, and possibly [[Thucydides]].&lt;ref name=browning/&gt; He composed his own medical encyclopaedia. Later Byzantine scholars sometimes confused Leo with the scholar [[Leo Choirosphaktes]] and the emperor [[Leo VI the Wise]], and ascribe to him [[oracle]]s.

The '''Lions Eye Institute''' (LEI) is an Australian [[medical research]] [[research institute|institute]]  affiliated with the [[University of Western Australia]]. It was established in 1983 with support of the [[Lions Clubs International|Lions Club of Australia]] and headquartered in the {{WAcity|Perth}} suburb of {{WAcity|Nedlands}}, [[Western Australia]]. The LEI is a [[not-for-profit]] centre of excellence that combines an ophthalmic clinic with scientific discovery developing techniques for the prevention of blindness and the reduction of pain from blinding eye conditions.&lt;ref name="smh1"&gt;{{cite news  |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/Health/Scientists-restore-sight-ofmiceanddogs/2005/04/20/1113854205820.html  |title=Scientists restore sight of mice and dogs   |newspaper=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]   |date=20 April 2005  |accessdate=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="balimadara"/&gt;

==History==
 
At a 1970 convention in [[Albany, Western Australia]], the Western Australian Lions Clubs created the Lions Save Sight Foundation (WA) Inc. with the aim of leading the development of ophthalmic care.&lt;ref name="lsshisto "&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lssf.com.au/history/  |title=History  |work=Lions SaveSight Foundation  |publisher=  |date=  |accessdate=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;    In 1975 the Lions Save-Sight Foundation (LSSF) established the Lions Chair in Ophthalmology at the University of Western Australia.  Since its establishment, clinical facilities, new equipment, and research laboratories have been strategically commissioned to support the LEI’s core activities. In 1983, under [[Ian Constable]]'s guidance, the LEI, a not-for-profit organisation was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lei.org.au/about/history/ |title=Lions Eye Institute  - History |accessdate=  |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chairman"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lei.org.au/author/dmackey/ |title=Professor David A Mackey |work=Our people |publisher=Lions Eye Institute |date=2013 |accessdate=16 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With Constable, the LEI became an international centre for scientific research into blindness. Following its development, it relocated to the grounds of Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital. Its current Managing director David Mackey leads a team of clinicians, medical professionals, researchers and support staff. In 1994, the Institute created in partnership with the [[University of Western Australia]], the Centre for Ophthalmology and Visual Science (COVS). This centre has an independent University status within the Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry. In 2003, the LEI revised its basis of incorporation from a public benevolent charitable institution to a not-for profit limited liability company. 

==Overview==

The LEI employs scientists, [[Clinic|clinicians]], and support staff to conduct scientific research into blindness with known ophthalmic practices in Australia. The Institute also includes a Laser Vision Centre, Western Australia’s refractive surgery centre; the [[Lions Eye Bank]], Lions Optics and the LSSF. The LEI actively participates in numerous [[clinical trial]]s for the development of new treatments for eye diseases, in collaboration with scientists, ophthalmologists, and pharmaceutical companies. The Institute receives funds from clinic operations and its [[grant (money)|grant]]s from organisations such as the [[National Health and Medical Research Council]], individual benefactors and the LSSF.&lt;ref name="leireport2016"/&gt;

==Services==

The LEI provides a range of services including standard [[clinic]]al services, [[LASIK]] surgery at the Lions Laser Vision Center, [[cataract]] micro-surgery and lens implantation, [[plastic surgery]] of the eyelids and full [[Optometry|optometric]] service at Lions Optics. The Lions Eye Bank collects and distributes [[Corneal epithelium|corneal]] tissue, scleral tissue and supplies thousands of corneal transplants throughout Western Australia.&lt;ref name="Services"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lei.org.au/services/services-1 |title=Services at the LEI |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121127222837/http://www.lei.org.au/services/services-1 |archivedate=27 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;   The Institute initiated the Pilbara Aboriginal Eye Health Program, a strategy targeting indigenous people who suffer from diabetes and associated blinding eye diseases prevalent within the [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal population]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.vision2020australia.org.au/uploads/resource/19/Improving-outcomes-for-ATSIeyehealthand-vision-careproposal-v-9-2-.pdf  |title=Improving outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander eye health and vision care  |date=June 2010 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As part of the Australian Government aid to the Indonesian Government,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indonesia.embassy.gov.au/jakt/MR13_041.html |title=Australia hands over Bali eye facility to Indonesian Government |date=13 October 2015 |accessdate=12 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2007, the LEI was instrumental in setting up the [[Bali Mandara Eye Hospital]] which was handed over to the Indonesian Government on 13 October 2015.&lt;ref name="balimadara"&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://indonesia.embassy.gov.au/jakt/MR13_041.html  |title=Australia hands over Bali eye facility to Indonesian Government |newspaper=Australian Embassy Indonesia |date= 14 December 2013 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;    The LEI provides open consultations and health education seminars in cooperation with several organisations including Glaucoma Australia, [[Retinitis pigmentosa|Retinitis Pigmentosa]] Society of Western Australia, Macular Degeneration Foundation and the Australian Foundation for the Prevention of Blindness.  Its ophthalmologists also consult at Perth’s main teaching public hospitals including [[Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital]], [[Royal Perth Hospital]] and [[Fremantle Hospital]].

==Research Activities==

The LEI teams investigate all major causes of blindness including cataracts, [[diabetes]] related eye disease, [[glaucoma]], [[retinal]] degenerations, [[corneal]], and [[immune system|immune]]-based diseases. More than 70 scientists at the LEI use a range of technologies to develop treatments for blinding diseases, including [[gene therapy]] and [[telemedicine]].&lt;ref name="leireport2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lei.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/2016-Annual-Report-1.pdf  |title=LEI 2016 Annual Report  |work=LEI  |publisher=  |date=2016  |accessdate=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The LEI has national and international institutional partnerships including American Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, Shanghai University, Swedish University of Agricultural Science, University of Missouri and the National Eye Institute (USA). For example, the LEI participates in joint research and development projects with the American Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, [[Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences]], [[University of Missouri]] and the [[National Eye Institute]] (USA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Safety and Efficacy Study of rAAV.sFlt-1 in Patients With Exudative Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)|url=http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01494805|publisher=U. S. National Institutes of Health|accessdate=1 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;    Research carried out by the Institute teams led to the first retinal vein [[Bypass surgery|bypass]] treatment of blockages,&lt;ref name="sciencedaily"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/05/100504205801.htm  |title='Bypass' may lead to vision gains for central retinal vein occlusion patients  |work=Science Daily  |publisher=  |date= 6 May 2010  |accessdate=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the development of the first transgenic mouse model for [[Macular degeneration|Age-Related Macular Degeneration]],  the leading cause of blindness for people over 55.  This model is expected to accelerate the development of ARMD leading to an effective treatment. At the LEI, the first [[Keratoprosthesis|artificial cornea]], the AlphaCor was developed and implanted into a human eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.nature.com/eye/journal/v17/n3/pdf/6700333a.pdf | title=Corneal replacement using a synthetic hydrogel cornea, AlphaCor™: device, preliminary outcomes and complications |author1=C R Hicks |author2=G J Crawford |author3=X Lou |author4=D T Tan |author5=G R Snibson |author6=G Sutton |author7=N Downie |author8=L Werner |author9=T V Chirila |author10=I J Constable | journal=Eye |date=November 2003 | doi=10.1038/sj.eye.6700333}}&lt;/ref&gt;    The LEI is acknowledged as a core academic centre involved in clinical trials of new pharmaceutical therapies and surgical procedures before government approval. For example, the [[Minimally invasive glaucoma surgery#XEN Gel Stent .28AqueSys.2C Inc..2C Aliso Viejo.2C CA. Acquired by Allergan on Oct. 19.2C 2015.29 | Xen Gel Stent]], an implantable transcleral microsurgical device developed at the LEI was approved for use in the USA by the FDA in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Review of Optometry |url= https://www.reviewofoptometry.com/CMSDocuments/2017/2/ro0217i.pdf |publisher=Springer Verlag |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2013}}
Many materials have a well-characterized [[refractive index]], but these indexes depend strongly upon the [[frequency]] of light. Standard refractive index measurements are taken at the "yellow doublet" [[Fraunhofer lines|sodium D line]], with a [[wavelength]] of 589 [[Nanometre|nanometer]]s.

There are also weaker dependencies on [[temperature]], [[pressure]]/[[stress (physics)|stress]], etc., as well on precise material compositions (presence of [[dopant]]s, etc.); for many materials and typical conditions, however, these variations are at the percent level or less. Thus, it is especially important to cite the source for an index measurement if precision is required.

In general, an index of refraction is a [[complex number]] with both a real and imaginary part, where the latter indicates the strength of absorption loss at a particular wavelength&amp;mdash;thus, the imaginary part is sometimes called the [[refractive index#Dispersion|extinction coefficient]] &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. Such losses become particularly significant, for example, in metals at short (e.g. visible) wavelengths, and must be included in any description of the [[refractive index]].

'''''Manna''''' is a 2003 [[science fiction]] essay by [[Marshall Brain]] that explores several issues in modern information technology and user interfaces, including some around [[transhumanism]].

==Plot summary==

The fictional story is set in 2050 and takes place in [[Cary, North Carolina]] before the narrator flies to [[Australia]].  The narrator starts at a minimum wage job at Burger-G before being laid-off, primarily due to the Manna, a computer management system, replacing people in the service industry.  He then takes a bus to a small government provided welfare dormitory where he meets a friend.  Soon after, he is visited by two girls who tell him that he's invited to live in Australia because his father bought stock in the Australia Project years prior.  The narrator then goes on to discover the many aspects of the Australia Project.

In the US, which has a libertarian economic system, most Americans are unemployable and live in cramped housing projects, where they are fed and kept safe like farm animals. Birth control medicine in the water prevents them from having children. In contrast, in Australia, everyone has access to the goods provided by automation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=White|first1=Mark|title='I wasn't interested in just following the rules': Data scientist Jeremy Howard and the 'next internet'|url=http://www.smh.com.au/technology/innovation/i-wasnt-interested-in-just-following-the-rules-data-scientist-jeremy-howard-and-the-next-internet-20160419-go9rps.html|accessdate=30 November 2017|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
''Manna'' is meant to be a thought-provoking read or conceptual prototype rather than an entertaining novel (''see [[exploratory engineering]] for more on such writing'').  The novel shows two possible outcomes of the 'robotic revolution' in the near future: one outcome is a [[dystopia]] based around US capitalism and the other is a [[utopia]] based upon a communal and technological society in Australia.  Essentially, the two differ in that lower-class humans in the dystopic society have been left unmodified and are controlled by AI "managers" to the point of slavery, while humans in the utopian society more directly and efficiently participate in the management of the society as a whole and most or all willingly accept implanted AI aids.

Some technological and social themes explored :
* [[brain-computer interface]]
* [[enterprise resource planning]]
* [[class structure]]
* effect of [[artificial intelligence]] and [[robot]]s on society
* proper and improper uses of technology
* the failings of capitalism to cope with technological development
* [[welfare economics]] and a [[basic income]]

Positions and assumptions presented in the novel include:
*Insertion of an AI management system between workers and decision makers results in a loss of upward mobility in a society due to the impossibility of workers ever becoming actual managers.
*The acceptance of nervous system modification and integration of human and machine consciousness into what is considered "human" is accordingly presented as a path to liberation and practical [[egalitarianism]].
*Capitalism is inherently hierarchical and cannot be easily reconciled with abundance, it will by definition move more resources into the hands of the property owners and destitute all others - the novel shares this assumption with classic [[Marxism]].
*Privacy is largely incompatible with human safety in a utopian environment.

The book can be read online for free (see link below).

'''Mary R. Dawson''' (born 1930) is a [[vertebrate paleontologist]] and curator emeritus at the [[Carnegie Museum of Natural History]] in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]]&lt;ref name="SVPBio" /&gt;.

== Education and Career==
Dawson was raised in [[Michigan]], received her undergraduate degree from Michigan State University, and received her [[Ph.D.]] from the [[University of Kansas]].&lt;ref name="SVPBio"&gt;{{cite web |title=Mary R. Dawson |url=http://vertpaleo.org/Awards/AwardSubPages/Award-(1).aspx |publisher=Society of Vertebrate Paleontology |accessdate=July 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was [[Curator]] of Vertebrate Paleontology at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh from 1972 until she retired in 2003, including serving as chair of the Earth Sciences Division from 1973 to 1997.&lt;ref name="SVPBio" /&gt;

== Research ==
Dawson's research has focused on the evolution of mammals, especially of [[Cenozoic]] [[rodents]] and [[lagomorphs]].&lt;ref name="SVPBio" /&gt;  She has also maintained an active research program at [[Ellesmere Island]] and other sites in the high arctic which showed that tropical and subtropical animals lived inside the [[Arctic Circle]] during the exceptionally warm climates of the [[Paleogene]] geological period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dawson |first1=Mary R. |title=Paleogene terrestrial vertebrates: northernmost occurrence, Ellesmere Island, Canada |journal=Science |date=1976 |volume=192 |pages=781–782}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Through this work, she and her collaborators discovered the first [[fossil]]s of [[Tertiary]] land animals that documented a migration route between [[North America]] and [[Europe]]. This migration route provided early support for the theory of [[plate tectonics]], which was only gaining wide acceptance in the 1960s and 1970s. In 2006 she disputed the [[scientific classification|classification]] of the [[Laotian rock rat]], arguing that it is a member of the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Diatomyidae]], which had previously been believed to have gone extinct 11 million years ago &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dawson |first1=Mary R. |last2=Marivaux |first2=Laurent |last3=Li |first3=Chuan-kui |last4=Christopher |first4=Beard |last5=Métais |first5=Grégoire |title=Laonastes and the "Lazarus Effect" in Recent Mammals |journal=Science |date=March 10, 2006 |volume=311 |issue=5766 |page=1456-1458 |doi=10.1126/science.1124187 |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/311/5766/1456?casa_token=nHMsqzOHsLIAAAAA:hmZ8032KYXauzsGlN58H8FKjSveOzxzshYvKBDDO6V9B64NGvOh4K18KpZPY55YbCIkyf0VnWLmjXTTC}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Awards and honors ==
In 1992 Dr. Dawson became the first American woman to receive the [[Romer-Simpson medal]], which is awarded for lifetime achievement in the field of vertebrate paleontology and considered the highest honor bestowed by the [[Society of Vertebrate Paleontology]]&lt;ref name="SVPBio" /&gt;.  Likewise she was only the second woman to serve as the Society's president in 1973-1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Past Presidents of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology |url=http://vertpaleo.org/the-Society/Leadership/SVP_Past_Presidents.aspx |publisher=Society of Vertebrate Paleontology}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Society of Vertebrate Paleontology's Mary R. Dawson Predoctoral Fellowship Grant, which recognizes and supports graduate student research excellence, is named after her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dawson Grant |url=http://vertpaleo.org/Awards/Award-(1).aspx |publisher=Society of Vertebrate Paleontology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duplicates have since been made, and they (as well as the original) have been moved to other institutions.

==History==

In March, 1961 a new science  wing at the [[California Museum of Science and Industry]]&lt;ref name="CMS"&gt;Called the [[California Science Center]] since 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; in Los Angeles opened. The [[IBM|IBM Corporation]] had been asked by the Museum to make a contribution; IBM in turn asked the famous California designer team of [[Charles and Ray Eames|Charles Eames]] and his wife [[Charles and Ray Eames|Ray Eames]] to come up with a good proposal. The result was that the Eames Office was commissioned by IBM to design an interactive exhibition called ''Mathematica: A World of Numbers... and Beyond''.&lt;ref name="rights"&gt;The physical component of the exhibit was owned by the museum, it was financially supported by IBM, and the Eames Office retained the artistic property rights.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first of many exhibitions designed by the Eames Office.

The {{convert|3000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} exhibition stayed at the Museum until January 1998, making it the longest running of any corporate sponsored museum exhibition.&lt;ref name=DBoom&gt;{{cite web|title=mathematica: a world of numbers... |url=http://www.designboom.com/eng/funclub/mathematica.html |work=DesignBoom |publisher=designboom.com |accessdate=14 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120221224931/http://www.designboom.com/eng/funclub/mathematica.html |archivedate=21 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it is the only one of the dozens of exhibitions designed by the Office of Charles and Ray Eames that is still extant. This original ''Mathematica'' exhibition was reassembled for display at the Alyce de Roulet Williamson Gallery at [[Art Center College of Design]] in [[Pasadena, California]], July 30 through October 1, 2000. It is now owned by and on display at the [[New York Hall of Science]], though it now lacks the overhead plaques with quotations from mathematicians that were part of the original installation.&lt;ref name=Nysci&gt;{{cite web|title=Mathematica|url=http://nysci.org/mathematica/|publisher=New York Hall of Science|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Duplicates===
In November, 1961 an exact duplicate was made for Chicago's [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Museum of Science and Industry]], where it was shown until late 1980. From there it was sold and relocated to the [[Museum of Science (Boston)|Museum of Science]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], where it is permanently on display. In January 2014, the exhibit temporarily closed to undergo a much-needed year-long refurbishment, and reopened in a new location at the Museum of Science in April 2015. The Boston installation bears the closest resemblance to the original Eames design, including numerous overhead plaques featuring historic quotations from famous mathematicians.&lt;ref name=MOSBoston&gt;{{cite web|title=Mathematica|url=http://www.mos.org/exhibits/mathematica|work=Museum of Science|publisher=The Museum of Science, Boston|accessdate=2015-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the refurbishment, a graphic panel was added to supplement the History Wall timeline to recognize the contributions of both men and women mathematicians of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.  

Another copy was made for the IBM Pavilion at the [[1964 New York World's Fair|1964/1965 New York World's Fair]].&lt;ref name="NY Exhibit"&gt;Mathematician [[Moon Duchin]] mentions the ''Mathematica'' exhibit at the World's Fair on page 28 of her paper "The Sexual Politics of Genius", University of Chicago [http://mduchin.math.tufts.edu/genius.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, it was briefly on display in [[Manhattan]], and was then installed in the [[Pacific Science Center]] in [[Seattle]] where it stayed until 1980. It was briefly re-installed in New York City at the 590 Madison Ave IBM Headquarters Building, before being moved to [[SciTrek]] in [[Atlanta]], but that organization was shut down in 2004 due to funding cuts. The exhibit was then shipped to [[Petaluma, California]] to Lucia Eames, the daughter of the original designers. {{asof|2015}}, the exhibit has been acquired by the [[Henry Ford Museum]] in [[Dearborn, Michigan]].&lt;ref name="Ford"&gt;{{cite web|title=Henry Ford museum acquires Eames’ Mathematica exhibit|url=https://www.liveauctioneers.com/news/top-news/museums/henry-ford-museum-acquires-eames-mathematica-exhibit/|website=Auction Central News|publisher=LiveAuctioneers|accessdate=2018-03-06|date=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibits==
Some of the displays are minimally interactive, in that they start to operate at the push of a button. Other displays are motorized and run continuously, or operate automatically on a fixed cycle as long as power is supplied. The moving display elements combine with noise made by balls falling through the probability machine, to fill the exhibit space with an atmosphere of continuous activity.

* Large-scale [[bean machine]] showing the [[binomial distribution]] as an approximation of the [[normal distribution]] in [[probability theory]]
* [[Moebius strip]] with a motorized red arrow that can trace a complete circuit of the one-sided surface
* A curved funnel-shaped surface modeling a [[gravitational well]] using [[ball bearing]]s orbiting in ellipses
* A three-dimensional cube illustrating the concept of [[multiplication (mathematics)|multiplication]]
* [[Soap bubble]]s and films, as examples of [[minimal surface]]s
* [[Mechanical linkage]]s, such as the [[Sarrus linkage]]
* [[Topology|Topological surface]]s, such as the [[Klein bottle]]
* Models showing [[perspective (visual)|perspective]] and geometric [[projection (mathematics)|projection]]
* Wall-spanning [[timeline]] of the history of mathematical thought and discoveries

In addition, large placards hang from the ceiling, carrying interesting quotations from famous mathematicians. Some installations have omitted this feature, although it was an integral part of the original exhibition.

==''Men of Modern Mathematics'' poster==
In 1966, five years after the opening of the Mathematica Exhibit, IBM published a {{convert|2|x|12|ft|m|adj=on}} [[timeline]] poster, titled ''Men of Modern Mathematics''. It was based on the items displayed on the exhibit's History Wall, and free copies were distributed to schools.  The timeline covered the period from 1000 AD to approximately 1950 AD, and the poster featured biographical and historical items, along with numerous pictures showing progress in various areas of science, including architecture. The mathematical items in this chart were prepared by Professor [[Raymond Redheffer]]&lt;ref name="redheffer"&gt;Redheffer died in 2005, and the online memorial {{cite web|url=http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/senate/inmemoriam/raymondredheffer.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327032756/http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/senate/inmemoriam/raymondredheffer.htm |archivedate=2009-03-27 |df= }} at UCLA points out that even though he was an accomplished mathematician and lecturer, he was probably most famous for his work on the IBM chart.&lt;/ref&gt; of [[University of California Los Angeles|UCLA]]. Long after the chart was distributed, mathematics departments around the world have proudly displayed this chart on their walls.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the link given in the footnote on Redheffer&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, IBM Corporation released a free [[iPad]] application, ''Minds of Modern Mathematics'', based on the poster but updated to the present, including expanded coverage of [[List of women in mathematics|women mathematician]]s. The app was developed by IBM with the assistance of the Eames Office.&lt;ref name=iPadApp&gt;{{cite web|title=Free iPad App from IBM and Eames Office, Reinvents Iconic '60s-Era Infographic on History of Math|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/37247.wss|work=IBM News Room|publisher=IBM Corporation|accessdate=14 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=iPadMail&gt;{{cite web|last=Thornhill|first=Ted|title=1,000 years of maths... via an app: IBM creates a (very long) iPad timeline history of geeks' favourite subject|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2127248/IBMs-iPad-timeline-history-1-000-years-mathematics.html|work=Mail Online|publisher=Associated Newspapers Ltd.|accessdate=14 May 2012|date=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{asof|2018|03}}, the app has not been updated to run on current versions of [[iOS]], which only support 64-bit code.

The term '''bevaprime''' has been proposed as a term for a prime with at least 1,000,000,000 digits.&lt;ref name="largest"/&gt;

In fact, "[[almost all]]" primes are megaprimes, as the number of primes with less than a million digits is finite. However, the vast majority of known primes are not megaprimes.

'''Metapsychology''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: ''meta'' 'beyond, transcending', and ''ψυχολογία'' '[[psychology]]')&lt;ref name=OMD&gt;[https://archive.is/20070813174048/http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?metapsychology Metapsychology Online Medical Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; is that aspect of any psychological theory which refers to the structure of the theory itself (hence the prefix "meta") rather than to the entity it describes. The psychology is about the psyche; the metapsychology is about the psychology. The term is used mostly in discourse about psychoanalysis, the psychology developed by [[Sigmund Freud]], which today is regarded as a branch of science (with roots in the work of Freud's scientific mentors and predecessors, especially Helmholtz, Brucke, Charcot, and Janet) and/or a hermeneutics of understanding (with roots in Freud's literary sources, especially Sophocles and, to a lesser extent, Goethe and Shakespeare).  Emphasis on the scientific status of psychoanalysis has been renewed in the emerging discipline of neuropsychoanalysis, whose major exemplar is Mark Solms. The hermeneutic vision of psychoanalysis is the focus of influential works by Donna Orange.

[[Psychoanalytic]] metapsychology is concerned with the fundamental structure and concepts [[Freudian theory]].&lt;ref name="OMD"/&gt; [[Sigmund Freud]] first used the term on 13 February 1896 in a letter to [[Wilhelm Fliess]],&lt;ref name="Routledge"&gt;{{cite book |last=Erwin |first=Edward |chapter= Metapsychology (p. 337) |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/?id=rX2w6QELtKgC&amp;pg=PA337&amp;dq=%22Freud's+first+recorded+use+of+the+word+%22metapsychology%22+is+in+a+letter+to+Fliess+(of+February+13,+1896)%22 |editor-last=Erwin |editor-first=Edward |title=The Freud encyclopedia.

On March 10, 1898, he wrote to Fiess: "It seems to me that ({{lang-de|als ob}})&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} {{cite book |last=Roudinesco |first=Élisabeth |authorlink=Élisabeth Roudinesco |last2=Plon |first2=Michel |title=Wörterbuch der Psychoanalyse.

In a letter dated March 10 of that year he told Fliess: "I am not at all in disagreement with you, not at all inclined to leave psychology hanging in the air without an organic basis.

A salient example of Freud's own metapsychology is his chracterization of psychoanalysis as a "simultaneously closed system, fundamentally unrelated and impervious to the external world and as an open system inherently connected and responsive to environmental influence''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dunn |first=Jonathan |title=The foundational wisdom in Freud's and Loewald's metapsychologies |journal=Modern Psychoanalysis |date=2009 |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=2–25 |publisher=Center for Modern Psychoanalytic Studies |url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/6559b62f61964d350d95da9f488c482a/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=36244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1910s, Freud wrote a series of twelve essays, to be collected as ''Preliminaries to a Metapsychology''. Five of these were published independently under the titles: "Instincts and Their Vicissitudes," "Repression," "The Unconscious," "A Metapsychological Supplement to the Theory of Dreams," and "Mourning and Melancholia." The remaining seven remained unpublished, an expression of Freud's ambivalence about his own attempts to articulate the whole of his vision of psychoanalysis.  In 1919 he wrote to [[Lou Andreas-Salome]], "Where is my Metapsychology? In the first place it remains unwritten".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Freud |first=Sigmund |authorlink=Sigmund Freud |title=On metapsychology: the theory of psychoanalysis |page=102 |publisher=The Penguin Freud Library |volume=11 |location=London |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-140-13801-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920 he published ''[[Beyond the Pleasure Principle]]'', a text with metaphysical ambitions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9647">'''Militarized interstate disputes''' ('''MIDs''') are conflicts between [[Sovereign state|states]] that do not involve a full-scale [[war]]. A conflict is described as an MID if it causes fewer than 1,000 deaths, and some military force is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sarkess|first=Meredith|title=The COW Typology of War: Defining and Categorizing Wars (Version 4 of the Data)|url=http://www.correlatesofwar.org/COW2%20Data/WarData_NEW/COW%20Website%20-%20Typology%20of%20war.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be as little as a military display of force with no deaths. Under this definition, over 2,000 MIDs have been identified since 1816 in the [[Correlates of War]] project.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel M. Jones, Stuart A. Bremer and J. David Singer. 1996. "Militarized Interstate Disputes, 1816-1992: Rationale, Coding Rules, and Empirical Patterns." ''Conflict Management and Peace Science'' 15(2): 163-213.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, although the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] by the [[United States]]-led coalition would be considered a full-scale war, the bombings and disputes related to American, [[United Kingdom|British]], and (until 1996) [[France|French]] control of the [[Iraqi no-fly zone]] in the 1990s are described by Frank Wayman as an "MID".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wayman, Frank |title=Incidence of Militarized Disputes Between Liberal States, 1816-1992 |year=2002 |version=Paper presented at the annual meeting of the International Studies Association, New Orleans, La., Mar. 23-27, 2002 |url=http://www.isanet.org/noarchive/wayman.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050325211849/http://www.isanet.org/noarchive/wayman.html |archivedate=March 25, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
Some of the findings from research on MIDs:

*Research using a continuous measure of [[democracy]] shows that the most democratic nations have few MIDs with one another. There is an ongoing debate regarding whether it is the most [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] or the intermediate regimes that have the most MIDs.&lt;ref&gt;

*When examining these MIDs in more detail, the inter-liberal{{clarify|date=November 2014}} disputes have on the average more hostility, but are less likely to involve third parties, hostility is less likely to be reciprocated, when reciprocated the response is usually proportional to the provocation, and the disputes are less likely to cause any loss of life.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|author=Wayman, Frank |title=Incidence of Militarized Disputes Between Liberal States, 1816-1992 |year=2002 |version=Paper presented at the annual meeting of the International Studies Association, New Orleans, La., Mar. 23-27, 2002 |url=http://isanet.ccit.arizona.edu/noarchive/wayman.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405233409/http://isanet.ccit.arizona.edu/noarchive/wayman.html |archivedate=2008-04-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Enduring militarized competition between democratic states is rare. After both states have become democratic, there is a decreasing probability for MIDs within a year and this decreases almost to zero within five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hensel, Paul R., Gary Goertz, and Paul F. Diehl |title=The Democratice Peace and Rivalries |journal=Journal of Politics |year=2000 |volume=64 |pages=1173&amp;ndash;88 |url=http://garnet.acns.fsu.edu/~phensel/Research/jop00.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050513003019/http://garnet.acns.fsu.edu/~phensel/Research/jop00.pdf |archivedate=2005-05-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Democracies do sometimes attack nondemocracies. Many earlier papers found that democracies in general are as warlike as nondemocracies, but according to several recent papers democracies are overall slightly less involved in war, initiate wars and MIDs less frequently than nondemocracies, and tend more frequently to seek negotiated resolutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Müller, Harald |author2=Jonas Wolff |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Dyadic Democratic Peace Strikes Back |date=2004a |version=Paper prepared for presentation at the 5th Pan-European International Relations Conference The Hague, September 9–11, 2004 |url=http://www.sgir.org/conference2004/papers/Mueller%20Wolff%20-%20Dyadic%20Democratic%20Peace%20Strikes%20Back.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060625034003/http://www.sgir.org/conference2004/papers/Mueller%20Wolff%20-%20Dyadic%20Democratic%20Peace%20Strikes%20Back.pdf |archivedate=2006-06-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A recent theory is that democracies can be divided into "pacifist" and "militant". While both avoid attacking other democracies, "militant" democracies have a tendency to distrust and use confrontational policies against dictatorships. Most MIDs by democracies since 1950 have involved only four nations: the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Israel]], and [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1057/palgrave.ip.8800089 |author=Müller, Harald |title=The Antimony of Democratic Peace |journal=International Politics |year=2004b |volume=41 |pages=494&amp;ndash;520 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/pal/ip/2004/00000041/00000004/art00003 |issue=4 }} {{cite journal|author1=Müller, Harald |author2=Jonas Wolff |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Dyadic Democratic Peace Strikes Back |date=2004a |version=Paper prepared for presentation at the 5th Pan-European International Relations Conference The Hague, September 9–11, 2004 |url=http://www.sgir.org/conference2004/papers/Mueller%20Wolff%20-%20Dyadic%20Democratic%20Peace%20Strikes%20Back.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060625034003/http://www.sgir.org/conference2004/papers/Mueller%20Wolff%20-%20Dyadic%20Democratic%20Peace%20Strikes%20Back.pdf |archivedate=2006-06-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Correlates of War (CoW) Militarized Interstate Dispute (MID) dataset ==
The Correlates of War (CoW) Militarized Interstate Dispute (MID) dataset is the most extensive dataset on MIDs, and has been the basis of much of the published research on MIDs.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gibler|first=Douglas M.|last2=Miller|first2=Steven V.|last3=Little|first3=Erin K.|date=2016-12-01|title=An Analysis of the Militarized Interstate Dispute (MID) Dataset, 1816–2001|url=https://academic.oup.com/isq/article-abstract/60/4/719/2918882/An-Analysis-of-the-Militarized-Interstate-Dispute?redirectedFrom=fulltext|journal=International Studies Quarterly|language=en|volume=60|issue=4|pages=719–730|doi=10.1093/isq/sqw045|issn=0020-8833}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2017 study found that the coding in the dataset was deeply flawed with significant effects on the findings of studies that relied on the dataset: "After strictly applying MID coding rules, we recommend dropping 251 cases (or over 10% of the dataset), as either we were unable to find a militarized incident in the historical record or the dispute appeared elsewhere in the data. We found evidence linking 75 disputes to other cases, and we could not identify 19 cases in the historical record. Among the remaining disputes, we recommend major changes (changes in dispute year, fatality level, and participants) in 234 disputes and minor changes in 1,009 disputes... estimates in our replications of three recent studies of dispute escalation, dispute duration, and dispute reciprocation all witness substantial changes when using corrected data—to the point of reversing previous conclusions in some cases."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6163">'''Stages of play''' is a theory and classification of children's participation in [[Play (activity)|play]] developed by [[Mildred Parten Newhall]] in her 1929 dissertation.&lt;ref name=fh&gt;{{cite book |first=Fergus P. |last=Hughes |title=Children, Play, and Development |publisher=SAGE |year=2009 |isbn=1-4129-6769-4 |pages=100–103 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KbnOVfinznEC&amp;pg=PA100 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Parten observed American [[preschool]] age (ages 2 to 5) children at free play (defined as anything unrelated to survival, production or profit).

Parten recognized six different types of play:
*Unoccupied (play) – when the child is not playing, just observing. A child may be standing in one spot or performing random movements.&lt;ref name=San&gt;{{cite book |last=Santrock |first=J. W. |year=2007 |chapter=Parten's classic study of play |title=A topical approach to life-span development |edition=3rd |page=573 |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=0-07-313376-0 |orig-year=2002 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=2J_0sgEACAAJ&amp;pg=PA573 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Solitary (independent) play – when the child is alone and maintains focus on its activity. Such a child is uninterested in or is unaware of what others are doing. More common in younger children (age 2–3) as opposed to older ones.&lt;ref name=fh/&gt;&lt;ref name=San/&gt;&lt;ref name=rr&gt;Renee Roberson, [http://www.toddlerstoday.com/articles/play-time/side-by-side-in-the-sandbox-4841/ Side-by-Side in the Sandbox. The Importance of Parallel Play in Toddlers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717065524/http://www.toddlerstoday.com/articles/play-time/side-by-side-in-the-sandbox-4841/ |date=2011-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Onlooker play (behavior) – when the child watches others at play but does not engage in it.&lt;ref name=San/&gt; The child may engage in forms of [[social interaction]], such as conversation about the play, without actually joining in the activity.&lt;ref name=rr/&gt; This type of activity is also more common in younger children.&lt;ref name=fh/&gt;
*[[Parallel play]] (adjacent play, social coaction) – when the child plays separately from others but close to them and mimicking their actions.&lt;ref name=San/&gt;&lt;ref name=rr/&gt; This type of play is seen as a transitory stage from a socially immature solitary and onlooker type of play, to a more socially mature associative and cooperative type of play.&lt;ref name=fh/&gt;
*Associative play – when the child is interested in the people playing but not in coordinating their activities with those people, or when there is no organized activity at all. There is a substantial amount of interaction involved, but the activities are not in sync.&lt;ref name=San/&gt;&lt;ref name=rr/&gt;
*Cooperative play – when a child is interested both in the people playing and in the activity they are doing. In cooperative play, the activity is organized, and participants have assigned roles. There is also increased [[self-identification]] with a group, and a [[group identity]] may emerge. This is relatively uncommon in the preschool and Kindergarten years, because it requires more social maturity and more advanced organization skills. Examples would be dramatic play activities with roles, like playing school, or a game with rules, such as [[Tag (game)|freeze tag]].&lt;ref name=fh/&gt;&lt;ref name=San/&gt;&lt;ref name=rr/&gt;

According to Parten, as children became older, improving their communication skills, and as opportunities for peer interaction become more common, the nonsocial (solitary and parallel) types of play become less common, and the social (associative and cooperative) types of play become more common.&lt;ref name=fh/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tomlin|first=Carolyn Ross|title=Play: A Historical Review|url=http://www.earlychildhoodnews.com/earlychildhood/article_view.aspx?ArticleID=618|accessdate=June 29, 2012|newspaper=Early Childhood News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern scholars agree that Parten's theory has contributed substantially to our understanding of play, and while alternative classification schemes have been proposed, Parten's stages of play are still widely used.&lt;ref name=fh/&gt; However, there is disagreement on whether there is indeed a sequence of play stages that children go through – for example, whether toddlers are really unable to play cooperatively, and whether solitary play in older children is less common or a sign of immaturity.&lt;ref name=fh/&gt; Alternative explanations suggest that types of play may be influenced by other circumstances (such as how well the children know one another).&lt;ref name=fh/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6100">A '''pseudoword''' or '''non-word''' is a unit of speech or text that appears to be an actual word in a certain [[language]], while in fact it has no meaning in the [[lexicon]]. It is a kind of non-lexical [[vocable]].

Such [[word]]s without a [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] in a certain language or no occurrence in any [[text corpus]] or [[dictionary]] can be the result of (the interpretation of) a truly [[random signal]], there will usually be an underlying deterministic source as is the case for:

*[[nonsense word]]s (e.g. ''[[jabberwocky]]'')
*[[nonce word]]s
*[[ghost word]]s (e.g. ''[[dord]]'')
*[[Cipher|cyphers]]
*[[typo]]s

When nonsensical words are strung together, [[gibberish]] may arise. [[Word salad]] in contrast may contain legible and intelligible words but without semantic or [[syntax|syntactic]] correlation or [[coherence (linguistics)|coherence]].

== Characteristics ==
{{No footnotes|section|date=April 2013}}
Within [[linguistics]], a pseudoword is defined specifically as respecting the [[phonotactics|phonotactic]] restrictions of a language. That is, it does not include sounds or series of sounds that do not exist in that language: it is easily pronounceable for speakers of the language. Also, when written down, a pseudoword does not include strings of characters that are not permissible in the spelling of the target language. "Vonk" is a pseudoword in English, while "dfhnxd" is not. The latter is an example of a nonword. Nonwords are contrasted with pseudowords in that they are not pronounceable and by that their spelling could not be the spelling of a real word.

Pseudowords are also sometimes called '''wug words''' in the context of linguistic experiments. This is because ''wug'' [wʌg] was one such pseudoword used by [[Jean Berko Gleason]] in her [[wug test]] 1958 experiments. Words like ''wug'', which could have been a perfectly acceptable word in English but isn't due to an [[accidental gap]], were presented to children. The experimenter would then prompt the children to create a plural for ''wug'', which was almost invariably ''wugs'' [wʌgz]. The experiments were designed to see if English [[morphophonemics]] would be applied by children to novel words. They revealed that even at a very young age, children have already internalized many of the complex features of their language.

A '''logatome''' is a short pseudoword or just a syllable which is used in acoustic experiments to examine [[speech recognition]].

== Nonsense syllables ==

A '''logatome''' or '''nonsense syllable''' is a short pseudoword consisting most of the time of just one [[syllable]] which has no meaning of its own. Examples of English logatomes are the nonsense words ''snarp'' or ''bluck''.

Like other pseudowords, logatomes obey all the phonotactic rules of a specific language.

Logatomes are used in particular in [[acoustics|acoustic]] experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=57–64 |doi=10.1055/s-2007-997389 |title=Sprachaudiometrie mit Logatomen* |year=2008 |last1=Welge-Lüßen |first1=Antje |last2=Hauser |first2=R. |last3=Erdmann |first3=J. |last4=Schwob |first4=Ch. |last5=Probst |first5=R. |journal=Laryngo-Rhino-Otologie |volume=76 |issue=02}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also used in experiments in the [[psychology of learning]] as a way to examine speech recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.specom.2007.01.009 |title=Reaching over the gap: A review of efforts to link human and automatic speech recognition research |year=2007 |last1=Scharenborg |first1=O |journal=Speech Communication |volume=49 |issue=5 |pages=336–347}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[experimental psychology]], especially the psychology of learning and [[memory]].

Nonsense syllables were first introduced by [[Hermann Ebbinghaus]]&lt;ref&gt;Ebbinghaus, H. (1964).  ''Memory''. New York: Dover. (Originally published 1885.)&lt;/ref&gt; in his experiments on the learning of lists.  His intention was that they would form a standard stimulus so that experiments would be reproducible.  However, with increasing use it became apparent that different nonsense syllables were learned at very different rates, even when they had the same superficial structure.  Glaze&lt;ref&gt;Glaze, J. A. (1928).  The association value of non-sense syllables.  ''Pedagogical Seminary and Journal of Genetic Psychology, 35'', 255-269.&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the concept of [[association value]] to describe these differences, which turned out to be reliable between people and situations.  Since Glaze's time, experiments using nonsense syllables typically control association value in order to reduce variability in results between stimuli.

Nonsense syllables can vary in structure.  The most used are the so-called CVC syllables, composed of a consonant, a vowel, and a consonant.  These have the advantage that nearly all are pronounceable, that is, they fit the phonotactics of any language that uses [[syllable#Coda|closed syllables]], such as English and [[German language|German]].  They are often described as "CVC [[trigram]]s", reflecting their three-letter structure.  Obviously many other structures are possible, and can be described on the same principles, e.g. VC, VCV, CVCV.  But the CVC trigrams have been studied most intensively; for example, Glaze determined association values for 2019 of them.

The term nonsense syllable is widely used to describe [[non-lexical vocables in music|non-lexical vocables used in music]], most notably in [[scat singing]] but also in many other forms of vocal music.  Although such usages do not invoke the technical issues about structure and associability that are of concern in psychology, the essential meaning of the term is the same.

In [[sociology]], '''rationalization''' (or '''rationalisation''') is the replacement of traditions, values, and emotions as motivators for behavior in society with concepts based on [[rationality]] and [[reason]]. For example, the implementation of bureaucracies in government is a kind of rationalization, as is the construction of high-efficiency living spaces in architecture and urban planning. A potential reason as to why rationalization of a culture may take place in the modern era is the process of [[globalization]]. Countries are becoming increasingly interlinked, and with the rise of technology, it is easier for countries to influence each other through [[social networking]], the [[News media|media]] and [[politics]]. An example of rationalization in place would be the case of witch doctors in certain parts of Africa. Whilst many locals view them as an important part of their culture and traditions, development initiatives and aid workers have tried to rationalize the practice in order to educate the local people in modern medicine and practice (Giddens, 2013).

Many sociologists, [[critical theorists]] and contemporary [[philosophers]] have argued that rationalization, falsely assumed as progress, has had a negative and [[dehumanization|dehumanizing]] effect on society, moving [[modernity]] away from the central tenets of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name="Habermas, Jürgen 1985 p2"&gt;Habermas, Jürgen, ''The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity'', Polity Press (1985), {{ISBN|0-7456-0830-2}}, p2&lt;/ref&gt; The founders of sociology had critical reaction to rationalization:

{{Quotation|Marx and Engels associated the emergence of modern society above all with the development of capitalism; for Durkheim it was connected in particular with [[industrialization]] and the new social division of labour which this brought about; for Weber it had to do with the emergence of a distinctive way of thinking, the rational calculation which he associated with the Protestant Ethic (more or less what Marx and Engels speak of in terms of those 'icy waves of egotistical calculation').|John Harriss ''The Second Great Transformation? Capitalism at the End of the Twentieth Century'' 1992|&lt;ref&gt;Harriss, John. ''The Second Great Transformation? Capitalism at the End of the Twentieth Century'' in Allen, T. and Thomas, Alan (eds) ''Poverty and Development in the 21st Century'', Oxford University Press, Oxford. p325.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Capitalism==
Rationalization formed a central concept in the foundation of classical sociology, particularly with respect to the emphasis the discipline placed – by contrast with [[anthropology]] – on the nature of modern Western societies. The term was presented by the profoundly influential German [[antipositivist]] [[Max Weber]], though its themes bear parallel with the critiques of modernity set forth by a number of scholars. A rejection of [[dialectism]] and [[sociocultural evolution]] informs the concept.

Weber demonstrated rationalization in ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'', in which the aims of certain [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Theologies, particularly [[Calvinism]], are shown to have shifted towards rational means of economic gain as a way of dealing with their 'salvation anxiety'. The rational consequences of this doctrine, he argued, soon grew incompatible with its religious roots, and so the latter were eventually discarded. Weber continues his investigation into this matter in later works, notably in his studies on [[bureaucracy]] and on the classifications of [[authority]]. In these works he alludes to an inevitable move towards rationalization.&lt;ref name="Macionis, J. 2010"&gt;Macionis, J., and Gerber, L. (2010). Sociology, 7th edition&lt;/ref&gt;

Weber believed that a move towards [[rational-legal authority]] was inevitable. In [[charismatic authority]], the death of a leader effectively ends the power of that authority, and only through a rationalized and bureaucratic base can this authority be passed on. [[Traditional authority|Traditional authorities]] in rationalized societies also tend to develop a rational-legal base to better ensure a stable accession. (See also: [[Tripartite classification of authority]])

{{Quotation|What Weber depicted was not only the [[secularization]] of Western ''culture'', but also and especially the development of modern ''societies'' from the viewpoint of rationalization. The new structures of society were marked by the differentiation of the two functionally intermeshing systems that had taken shape around the organizational cores of the capitalist enterprise and the bureaucratic state apparatus. Weber understood this process as the institutionalization of purposive-rational economic and administrative action. To the degree that everyday life was affected by this cultural and societal rationalization, traditional forms of life - which in the early modern period were differentiated primarily according to one's trade - were dissolved.|[[Jürgen Habermas]]'s ''Modernity's Consciousness of Time''|&lt;ref name="Habermas, Jürgen 1985 p2"/&gt;}}

Whereas in [[Traditional society|traditional societies]] such as [[feudalism]] governing is managed under the [[traditional authority|traditional leadership]] of, for example, a [[queen regnant|queen]] or [[tribal chief]], modern societies operate under [[rational-legal authority|rational-legal systems]]. For example, [[democracy|democratic systems]] attempt to remedy qualitative concerns (such as [[racism|racial discrimination]]) with rationalized, quantitative means (for example, [[civil rights]] [[Statutory law|legislation]]). Weber described the eventual effects of rationalization in his ''[[Economy and Society]]'' as leading to a "polar night of icy darkness", in which increasing rationalization of human life traps individuals in an "[[iron cage]]" (or "steel-hard casing") of rule-based, [[rationality|rational]] control.

[[Jürgen Habermas]] has argued that understanding rationalization properly requires going beyond Weber's notion of rationalization. It requires distinguishing between ''instrumental rationality'', which involves calculation and efficiency (in other words, reducing all relationships to those of means and ends), and ''communicative rationality'', which involves expanding the scope of mutual understanding in communication, the ability to expand this understanding  through reflective discourse about communication, and making social and political life subject to this expanded understanding.

{{Quotation|It is clear that in ''[[The Theory of Communicative Action]]'' Weber is playing something like the role that Hegel played for Marx. Weber, for Habermas, must be not so much stood on his head (or put back the right way up) as persuaded to stand on two legs rather than one, to support his theory of modernity with more systematic and structural analyses than those of the (purposive-rational) rationalization of action ... Weber 'parts company with a theory of communicative action' when he defines action in terms of the actor attaching a subjective meaning to it. He does not elucidate "meaning" in connection with the model of speech; he does not relate it to the linguistic medium of possible understanding, but to the beliefs and intentions of an acting subject, taken to being with in isolation. This leads him to his familiar distinction between value-rational, purposive-rational, traditional and affectual action. What Weber should have done instead was to concentrate not on orientations of action but on the general structures of the lifeworld to which acting subjects belong. |[[William Outhwaite]] ''Habermas: Key Contemporary Thinkers'' 1988|&lt;ref&gt;Outhwaite, William, 1988 ''Habermas: Key Contemporary Thinkers'', Polity Press (Second Edition 2009), {{ISBN|978-0-7456-4328-1}} p.76&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===The Holocaust, modernity and ambivalence===
[[File:Rail leading to Auschwitz II (Birkenau).jpg|thumb|The railway line leading to the death camp at Auschwitz II (Birkenau).]]
For [[Zygmunt Bauman]], rationalization as a manifestation of modernity may be closely associated with the events of the [[Holocaust]]. In ''Modernity and Ambivalence'', Bauman attempted to give an account of the different approaches modern society adopts toward the stranger. He argued that, on the one hand, in a consumer-oriented economy the strange and the unfamiliar is always enticing; in different styles of food, different fashions and in tourism it is possible to experience the allure of what is unfamiliar.

Yet this strange-ness also has a more negative side. The stranger, because he cannot be controlled and ordered, is always the object of fear; he is the potential mugger, the person outside of society's borders who is constantly threatening. Bauman's most famous book, ''Modernity and the Holocaust'', is an attempt to give a full account of the dangers of these kinds of fears. Drawing upon [[Hannah Arendt]] and [[Theodor Adorno]]'s books on totalitarianism and the Enlightenment, Bauman argues that the Holocaust should not simply be considered to be an event in Jewish history, nor a regression to pre-modern barbarism. Rather, he says, the Holocaust should be seen as deeply connected to modernity and its order-making efforts. Procedural rationality, the division of labour into smaller and smaller tasks, the taxonomic categorization of different species, and the tendency to view rule-following as morally good all played their role in the Holocaust coming to pass.

For this reason, Bauman argues that modern societies have not fully taken on board the lessons of the Holocaust; it is generally viewed – to use Bauman's metaphor – like a picture hanging on a wall, offering few lessons. In Bauman's analysis, the Jews became 'strangers' ''par excellence'' in Europe;&lt;ref&gt;''Modernity and the Holocaust'', p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Final Solution]] was pictured by him as an extreme example of the attempts made by societies to excise the uncomfortable and indeterminate elements existing within them. Bauman, like the philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]], contended that the same processes of exclusion that were at work in the Holocaust could, and to an extent do, still come into play today.

===Adorno and Horkheimer's definition of "enlightenment"===
In their analysis of contemporary western society, ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]'' (1944, revised 1947), [[Theodor Adorno]] and [[Max Horkheimer]] developed a wide and pessimistic concept of enlightenment. In their analysis, enlightenment had its dark side: while trying to abolish superstition and myths by 'foundationalist' philosophy, it ignored its own 'mythical' basis. Its strivings towards totality and certainty led to an increasing instrumentalization of [[reason]]. In their view, the enlightenment itself should be enlightened and not posed as a 'myth-free' view of the world. For [[Marxist]] philosophy in general, rationalization is closely associated with the concept of "[[commodity fetishism]]", for the reason that not only are products designed to fulfill certain tasks, but employees are hired to fulfill specific tasks as well.

==Consumption==
[[File:Harlem Micky Dz.jpg|thumb|The sign at a [[McDonald's]] '[[drive-thru]]'. The "over 99 billion served" statement illustrates Ritzer's idea of calculability.]]
Modern food consumption typifies the process of rationalization. Where food preparation in traditional societies is more laborious and technically inefficient, modern society has strived towards speed and precision in its delivery. [[Fast-food restaurant]]s, designed to maximise profit, have strived toward total efficiency since their conception, and continue to do so. A strict level of efficiency has been accomplished in several ways, including stricter control of its workers' actions, the replacement of more complicated systems with simpler, less time-consuming ones, simple numbered systems of value meals and the addition of [[drive-through]] windows.

Rationalization is also observable in the replacement of more traditional stores, which may offer subjective advantages to consumers, such as what sociologists consider a less regulated, more natural environment, with modern stores offering the objective advantage of lower prices to consumers. The case of [[Wal-Mart]] is one strong example demonstrating this transition. While Wal-Marts have attracted [[Criticism of Wal-Mart|considerable criticism]] for effectively displacing more traditional stores, these subjective social-value concerns have held minimal effectiveness in limiting expansion of the enterprise, particularly in more rationalized nations,{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} due to the preferences of the public for lower prices over the advantages sociologists claim for more traditional stores.&lt;ref&gt;Boaz, David. (November 8, 1996). "[http://www.cato.org/dailys/11-08-96.html Chrysler, Microsoft, and Industrial Policy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060203063630/http://www.cato.org/dailys/11-08-96.html |date=2006-02-03 }}." ''[[Cato Institute]].'' Retrieved on August 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sociologist [[George Ritzer]] has used the term [[McDonaldization]] to refer, not just to the actions of the fast food restaurant, but to the general process of rationalization. Ritzer distinguishes four primary components of McDonaldization:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book 
  | last = Ritzer
  | first = George
  | title = The McDonaldization of Society
  | publisher = Pine Forge Press
  | year = 2008
  | location = Los Angeles
  | isbn = 0-7619-8812-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Efficiency – the optimal method for accomplishing a task; the fastest method to get from point A to point B. Efficiency in McDonaldization means that every aspect of the organization is geared toward the minimization of time.&lt;ref name="Macionis, J. 2010"/&gt;
* [[Calculability]] – goals are quantifiable (i.e., sales, money) rather than subjective (i.e., taste, labour). McDonaldization developed the notion that quantity equals quality, and that a large amount of product delivered to the customer in a short amount of time is the same as a high quality product. "They run their organization in such a way that a person can walk into any McDonald's and receive the same sandwiches prepared in precisely the same way. This results in a highly rational system that specifies every action and leaves nothing to chance".&lt;ref name="Macionis, J. 2010"/&gt;
* [[Predictability]] – [[standardization|standardized]] and uniform services.  "Predictability" means that no matter where a person goes, they will receive the same service and receive the same product at every interaction with the corporation. This also applies to the workers in those organizations; their tasks are highly repetitive and predictable routines.&lt;ref name="Macionis, J. 2010"/&gt;
* [[Social control|Control]] – standardized and uniform employees, replacement of human by non-human technologies.&lt;ref name="Macionis, J. 2010"/&gt;

==Commercialization==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2011}}
As [[capitalism]] itself is a rationalized economic policy, so is the process of [[commercialization]] it utilizes in order to increase sales. Most holidays, for instance, were created out of a religious context or in celebration of some past event. However, in rationalized societies these traditional values are increasingly diminished and the aim shifts from the qualitative aim of a meaningful celebration to the more quantitative aim of increasing sales.

In the [[United States]], for example, most major holidays now are represented by rationalized, [[secularism|secularized]] figures which serve as a corporate [[totem]]. In more traditional environments, [[gift]]s are more often hand-crafted works which hold some symbolic meaning. This qualitative value of gifts diminishes in rationalized societies, where individuals often offer hints or speak directly about what present they are interested in receiving. In these societies, the value of a gift is more likely to be weighed by objective measures (i.e. monetary value) than subjective (i.e. symbolism).

==Further objects of rationalization==

===Human body===
One rational tendency is towards increasing the efficiency and output of the human body. Several means can be employed in reaching this end, including trends towards regular [[exercise]], [[dieting]], increased [[hygiene]], [[medication|drugs]], and an emphasis on optimal [[nutrition]]. As well as increasing [[Longevity#Longevity and lifestyle|lifespans]], these allow for stronger, leaner, more optimized bodies for quickly performing tasks.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Michel Foucault]]'s ''The History of Sexuality'' (subtitle: ''The Care of the Self, vol. 3''), which identifies this rationalization as emerging from capitalist ideologies  vis &amp;agrave; vis control of workers (i.e., in this case, specifically, their bodies) for the rigors of commerce and the marketplace.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another aspect of this is maintaining a certain level of [[Physical attractiveness|physical attraction]]. Processes such as the [[comb]]ing of hair, use of a fragrance, having an appropriate [[haircut]], and wearing certain [[Clothing|clothes]] receive [[calculation|calculated]] use, that of giving off a certain impression to other individuals.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} In these cases, we see how rationalization does produce meaning and is not just simply a way to speed things up, i.e., a fat person is said to have poor self-control and discipline and thus you can now make personal judgments about them.

Another trend is in the [[bureaucratization]] of processes that formerly might have been done through the home. This includes the use of [[hospital]]s for childbirth and the use of [[Physician|doctor]]s to identify symptoms of an illness and to prescribe treatment.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Education===
Rationalized education tends to focus less on subjects based around the use of critical discourse (for instance, [[religion]]) and more on matters of a calculated importance (such as [[business administration]]). This is reflected also in the move towards [[standardized testing|standardized]] and [[multiple choice]] testing, which measures students on the basis of numbered answers and against a uniform standard.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

'''Saturn-Apollo 2''' ('''SA-2''') was the second flight of the [[Saturn I]] launch vehicle, the first flight of [[Project Highwater]], and was part of the American [[Apollo program]]. The rocket was launched on April 25, 1962, from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]], Florida.

== History ==

Launch preparation for the mission began at Cape Canaveral on February 27, 1962, with the arrival of the second Saturn I launch vehicle. The only significant change made to the vehicle from the previous [[Saturn I SA-1|SA-1]] flight was the addition of extra baffles in the propellant tanks to prevent fuel [[slosh dynamics|sloshing]]. While no serious delays were encountered, there were several minor problems reported.&lt;ref name="Benson1978" /&gt;

A leak was detected between the liquid oxygen dome and injector for the #4 [[H-1 (rocket engine)|H-1 rocket engine]]; while attempts were made to fix the problem, it was eventually decided to launch without replacing the engine. Minor problems were found in the guidance subsystem and service structure operations, damaged [[strain gauge]]s were found in a liquid oxygen stud and truss member, and a manhole cover on the dummy [[Centaur (rocket stage)|Centaur]] (S-V-D) third stage had to be replaced. Problems arose with two of the fueling computers, but each was repaired. Three hydraulic systems were also listed as potential problems.&lt;ref name="Benson1978" /&gt;

Despite the issues encountered during flight preparation, none required the target launch date of April 25 to be pushed back.&lt;ref name="Benson1978" /&gt;

Saturn-Apollo 2 was launched at 14:00:34 UTC on April 25, 1962, from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 34|Launch Complex 34]].&lt;ref name="Ryba2009" /&gt; The only hold in the countdown sequence was for 30 minutes due to a vessel which entered the flight safety zone {{convert|96|km|mi|disp=flip|sp=us}} down range.&lt;ref name="Benson1978" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brooks1979" /&gt; The rocket carried {{convert|281000|kg|lb|disp=flip}} of propellant, about 83% of its maximum capacity.&lt;ref name="Benson1978" /&gt;

The H-1 engines shut down at an altitude of {{convert|35|mi}} after firing for 1 minute 55 seconds and reaching a maximum velocity of {{convert|3750|mph}}.&lt;ref name="nashua19620425" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ertel1969" /&gt; The vehicle continued to coast to an altitude of {{convert|105.3|km|mi|disp=flip|sp=us}},&lt;ref name="Woodbridge1965" /&gt; at which point, 2 minutes 40 seconds after launch,&lt;ref name="nashua19620425" /&gt; officials sent a terminate command to the rocket, setting off several charges which caused the vehicle to destruct.&lt;ref name="Benson1978" /&gt;

== Objectives ==

The objectives of SA-2 were much the same as those of [[Saturn I SA-1|SA-1]] in that it was primarily a test of the Saturn I rocket and the new H-1 engines. Specifically, its goals were to prove propulsion performance and mission adequacy, vehicle structural design and aerodynamic characteristics, guidance and control systems, and launch facility and ground support equipment. NASA declared all objectives as successful. Additionally, the fuel sloshing issue from SA-1 was minimized.&lt;ref name="Brooks1979" /&gt;

A second objective of both this mission and [[Saturn I SA-3|SA-3]] was Project Highwater, the intentional release of [[:wikt:ballast|ballast]] water from the second and third stages which allowed scientists to investigate the nature of Earth's [[ionosphere]], as well as [[noctilucent cloud]]s and the behavior of ice in space.&lt;ref name="Woodbridge1965" /&gt;

SA-2's dummy upper stages contained approximately {{convert|86000|kg|disp=flip}} of water,&lt;ref name="Woodbridge1965" /&gt; or {{convert|86685|l|USgal|disp=flip|sp=us}},&lt;ref name="Brooks1979" /&gt; used to simulate the mass of future payloads. Stage two contained {{convert|44000|kg|disp=flip}} of water, and stage three contained {{convert|42000|kg|disp=flip}}.&lt;ref name="Woodbridge1965" /&gt; When the terminate command was sent to the rocket, dynamite charges&lt;ref name="nashua19620425" /&gt; split the second stage longitudinally, instantly releasing its water load.&lt;ref name="Woodbridge1965" /&gt; [[Primacord]] charges created several {{convert|1|ft|adj=on}} holes in the third stage, releasing its water over a period of several seconds.&lt;ref name="Woodbridge1965" /&gt;

Cameras on the ground immediately recorded the water cloud, and personnel at a ground station began to observe it about four to five seconds after release.&lt;ref name="Ryba2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Woodbridge1965" /&gt; Those personnel reported that the cloud dispersed from vision within an average of five seconds,&lt;ref name="Woodbridge1965" /&gt; while more sensitive instruments tracked the cloud to a maximum altitude of {{convert|161|km|mi|disp=flip|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name="Benson1978" /&gt; The cloud produced lightning-like effects, which Dr. [[Wernher von Braun]] described as "probably the first synthetic thunderstorm ever generated in space."&lt;ref name="news&amp;courier19620426" /&gt; Project Highwater on this flight was also declared a success.&lt;ref name="Ertel1969" /&gt;

[[File:Brillouin Zone (1st, FCC).svg|thumb|right|200px|First [[Brillouin zone]] of [[FCC lattice]] showing symmetry labels]]

In [[physics]], a '''symmetry''' of a [[physical system]] is a physical or mathematical feature of the system (observed or intrinsic) that is preserved or remains unchanged under some [[Transformation (function)|transformation]].

A family of particular transformations may be ''continuous'' (such as [[rotation]] of a circle) or ''[[discrete space|discrete]]'' (e.g., [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]] of a bilaterally symmetric figure, or rotation of a regular polygon). Continuous and discrete transformations give rise to corresponding types of symmetries. Continuous symmetries can be described by [[Lie group]]s while discrete symmetries are described by [[Finite group|finite groups]] (see [[Symmetry group]]).

These two concepts, Lie and finite groups, are the foundation for the fundamental theories of modern physics. Symmetries are frequently amenable to mathematical formulations such as [[representation of a Lie group|group representations]] and can, in addition, be exploited to simplify many problems.

Arguably the most important example of a symmetry in physics is that the speed of light has the same value in all frames of reference, which is known in mathematical terms as [[Poincaré group]], the symmetry group of [[special relativity]]. Another important example is the [[General covariance|invariance]] of the form of physical laws under arbitrary differentiable coordinate transformations, which is an important idea in [[general relativity]].

== Symmetry as a kind of invariance ==
Invariance is specified mathematically by transformations that leave some property (e.g. quantity) unchanged. This idea can apply to basic real-world observations. For example, [[temperature]] may be homogeneous throughout a room. Since the temperature does not depend on the position of an observer within the room,  we say that the temperature is ''invariant'' under a shift in an observer's position within the room.

Similarly, a uniform sphere rotated about its center will appear exactly as it did before the rotation. The sphere is said to exhibit [[spherical symmetry]]. A rotation about any [[Axis of rotation|axis]] of the sphere will preserve how the sphere "looks".

=== Invariance in force ===
The above ideas lead to the useful idea of ''invariance'' when discussing observed physical symmetry; this can be applied to symmetries in forces as well.

For example, an electric field due to an electrically charged wire of infinite length is said to exhibit [[rotational symmetry#Rotational symmetry with respect to any angle|cylindrical symmetry]], because the [[electric field strength]] at a given distance ''r'' from the wire will have the same magnitude at each point on the surface of a cylinder (whose axis is the wire) with radius ''r''. Rotating the wire about its own axis does not change its position or charge density, hence it will preserve the field. The field strength at a rotated position is the same. This is not true in general for an arbitrary system of charges. 

In Newton's theory of mechanics, given two bodies, each with mass ''m'', starting at the origin and moving along the ''x''-axis in opposite directions, one with speed ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and the other with speed ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; the total [[kinetic energy]] of the system (as calculated from an observer at the origin) is {{nowrap|{{frac|1|2}}''m''(''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} and remains the same if the velocities are interchanged. The total kinetic energy is preserved under a reflection in the ''y''-axis.

The last example above illustrates another way of expressing symmetries, namely through the equations that describe some aspect of the physical system. The above example shows that the total kinetic energy will be the same if ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are interchanged.

== Local and global symmetries ==
{{main|Global symmetry|Local symmetry}}
Symmetries may be broadly classified as ''global'' or ''local''. A ''global symmetry'' is one that holds at all points of [[spacetime]], whereas a ''local symmetry'' is one that has a different symmetry transformation at different points of [[spacetime]]; specifically a local symmetry transformation is parameterised by the spacetime co-ordinates. Local symmetries play an important role in physics as they form the basis for [[Gauge theory|gauge theories]].

==Continuous symmetries==
The two examples of rotational symmetry described above - spherical and cylindrical - are each instances of [[continuous symmetry]]. These are characterised by invariance following a continuous change in the geometry of the system. For example, the wire may be rotated through any angle about its axis and the field strength will be the same on a given cylinder. Mathematically, continuous symmetries are described by [[continuous function|continuous]] or [[smooth function]]s. An important subclass of continuous symmetries in physics are spacetime symmetries.

===Spacetime symmetries===
{{main|Spacetime symmetries}}
{{Lie groups}}
Continuous ''spacetime symmetries'' are symmetries involving transformations of [[space]] and [[time]]. These may be further classified as ''spatial symmetries'', involving only the spatial geometry associated with a physical system; ''temporal symmetries'', involving only changes in time; or ''spatio-temporal symmetries'', involving changes in both space and time.

* '''''[[Time translation]]''''': A physical system may have the same features over a certain interval of time &lt;math&gt;\delta t&lt;/math&gt;; this is expressed mathematically as invariance under the transformation &lt;math&gt;t \, \rightarrow t + a &lt;/math&gt; for any [[real number]]s ''t'' and ''a'' in the interval. For example, in classical mechanics, a particle solely acted upon by gravity will have [[gravitational potential energy]] &lt;math&gt;\, mgh&lt;/math&gt; when suspended from a height &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; above the Earth's surface. Assuming no change in the height of the particle, this will be the total gravitational potential energy of the particle at all times. In other words, by considering the state of the particle at some time (in seconds) &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt; and also at &lt;math&gt;t_0 + 3&lt;/math&gt;, say, the particle's total gravitational potential energy will be preserved.
* '''''[[Spatial translation symmetry|Spatial translation]]''''': These spatial symmetries are represented by transformations of the form &lt;math&gt;\vec{r} \, \rightarrow \vec{r} + \vec{a}&lt;/math&gt; and describe those situations where a property of the system does not change with a continuous change in location. For example, the temperature in a room may be independent of where the thermometer is located in the room.
* '''''[[Rotational symmetry|Spatial rotation]]''''': These spatial symmetries are classified as [[proper rotation]]s and [[improper rotation]]s. The former are just the 'ordinary' rotations; mathematically, they are represented by square matrices with unit [[determinant]]. The latter are represented by square matrices with determinant −1 and consist of a proper rotation combined with a spatial reflection ([[Point reflection|inversion]])&lt;!-- odd-dimensional? --&gt;. For example, a sphere has proper rotational symmetry. Other types of spatial rotations are described in the article ''[[Rotation symmetry]]''.
* '''''Poincaré transformations''''': These are spatio-temporal symmetries which preserve distances in [[Minkowski spacetime]], i.e. they are isometries of Minkowski space. They are studied primarily in [[special relativity]]. Those isometries that leave the origin fixed are called [[Lorentz transformation]]s and give rise to the symmetry known as [[Lorentz covariance]].
* '''''Projective symmetries''''': These are spatio-temporal symmetries which preserve the [[geodesic]] structure of [[spacetime]]. They may be defined on any smooth manifold, but find many applications in the study of [[exact solutions in general relativity]].
* '''''Inversion transformations''''': These are spatio-temporal symmetries which generalise Poincaré transformations to include other conformal one-to-one transformations on the space-time coordinates. Lengths are not invariant under [[inversion transformations]] but there is a cross-ratio on four points that is invariant.

Mathematically, spacetime symmetries are usually described by [[Smooth function|smooth]] [[vector field]]s on a [[smooth manifold]]. The underlying [[local diffeomorphism]]s associated with the vector fields correspond more directly to the physical symmetries, but the vector fields themselves are more often used when classifying the symmetries of the physical system.

Some of the most important vector fields are [[Killing vector field]]s which are those spacetime symmetries that preserve the underlying [[Metric tensor|metric]] structure of a manifold. In rough terms, Killing vector fields preserve the distance between any two points of the manifold and often go by the name of [[isometries]].

==Discrete symmetries==
{{main|Discrete symmetry}}

A '''discrete symmetry''' is a symmetry that describes non-continuous changes in a system. For example, a square possesses discrete rotational symmetry, as only rotations by multiples of right angles will preserve the square's original appearance. Discrete symmetries sometimes involve some type of 'swapping', these swaps usually being called ''reflections'' or ''interchanges''.

* '''''[[T-symmetry|Time reversal]]''''': Many laws of physics describe real phenomena when the direction of time is reversed. Mathematically, this is represented by the transformation, &lt;math&gt;t \, \rightarrow - t &lt;/math&gt;. For example, [[Newton's second law of motion]] still holds if, in the equation &lt;math&gt;F \, = m \ddot {r} &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is replaced by &lt;math&gt;-t&lt;/math&gt;. This may be illustrated by recording the motion of an object thrown up vertically (neglecting air resistance) and then playing it back. The object will follow the same [[Parabola|parabolic]] trajectory through the air, whether the recording is played normally or in reverse. Thus, position is symmetric with respect to the instant that the object is at its maximum height.
* '''''[[Parity (physics)|Spatial inversion]]''''': These are represented by transformations of the form &lt;math&gt;\vec{r} \, \rightarrow - \vec{r}&lt;/math&gt; and indicate an invariance property of a system when the coordinates are 'inverted'. Said another way, these are symmetries between a certain object and its [[mirror image]].
*'''''[[Glide reflection]]''''': These are represented by a composition of a translation and a reflection. These symmetries occur in some [[crystal]]s and in some planar symmetries, known as [[wallpaper group|wallpaper symmetries]].

=== C, P, and T symmetries ===
The [[Standard model]] of [[particle physics]] has three related natural near-symmetries. These state that the universe in which we live should be indistinguishable from one where a certain type of change is introduced.

*[[C-symmetry]] (charge symmetry), a universe where every particle is replaced with its [[antiparticle]]
*[[Parity (physics)|P-symmetry]] (parity symmetry), a universe where everything is mirrored along the three physical axes
&lt;!-- 
This really isn't a good example, because a mirror only reflects one axis (the normal). If possible, a common mans description of inverting 3 axis really needs to be used here. The mirror is too likely to be taken literally, and lead to misunderstanding. 
--&gt;

*[[T-symmetry]] (time reversal symmetry), a universe where the [[entropy (arrow of time)|direction of time]] is reversed. T-symmetry is counterintuitive (surely the future and the past are not symmetrical) but explained by the fact that the [[Standard model]] describes local properties, not global ones like [[entropy]]. To properly reverse the direction of time, one would have to put the [[big bang]] and the resulting low-[[entropy]] state in the "future." Since we perceive the "past" ("future") as having lower (higher) entropy than the present (see [[Entropy (arrow of time)|perception of time]]), the inhabitants of this hypothetical time-reversed universe would perceive the future in the same way as we perceive the past, and vice versa.

These symmetries are near-symmetries because each is broken in the present-day universe. However, the [[Standard Model]] predicts that the combination of the three (that is, the simultaneous application of all three transformations) must be a symmetry, called [[CPT symmetry]]. [[CP violation]], the violation of the combination of C- and P-symmetry, is necessary for the presence of significant amounts of [[baryonic matter]] in the universe. CP violation is a fruitful area of current research in [[particle physics]].

{{misleading|section|date=June 2015}}

=== Supersymmetry ===
{{main|Supersymmetry}}
A type of symmetry known as supersymmetry has been used to try to make theoretical advances in the [[standard model]]. Supersymmetry is based on the idea that there is another physical symmetry beyond those already developed in the standard model, specifically a symmetry between [[boson]]s and [[fermion]]s. Supersymmetry asserts that each type of boson has, as a supersymmetric partner, a fermion, called a superpartner, and vice versa. Supersymmetry has not yet been experimentally verified: no known particle has the correct properties to be a superpartner of any other known particle. Currently LHC is preparing for a run which tests supersymmetry.

==Mathematics of physical symmetry==
{{main|Symmetry group}}
{{see also|Symmetry in quantum mechanics|Symmetries in general relativity}}
The transformations describing physical symmetries typically form a mathematical [[group (mathematics)|group]]. [[Group theory]] is an important area of mathematics for physicists.

Continuous symmetries are specified mathematically by ''continuous groups'' (called [[Lie group]]s). Many physical symmetries are isometries and are specified by symmetry groups. Sometimes this term is used for more general types of symmetries. The set of all proper rotations (about any angle) through any axis of a sphere form a Lie group called the [[special orthogonal group]] &lt;math&gt;\, SO(3)&lt;/math&gt;. (The ''3'' refers to the three-dimensional space of an ordinary sphere.) Thus, the symmetry group of the sphere with proper rotations is &lt;math&gt;\, SO(3)&lt;/math&gt;. Any rotation preserves distances on the surface of the ball. The set of all Lorentz transformations form a group called the [[Lorentz group]] (this may be generalised to the [[Poincaré group]]).

Discrete groups describe discrete symmetries. For example, the symmetries of an equilateral triangle are characterized by the [[symmetric group]] &lt;math&gt;\, S_3&lt;/math&gt;.

An important type of physical theory based on ''local'' symmetries is called a [[Gauge theory|''gauge'' theory]] and the symmetries natural to such a theory are called [[Gauge symmetry|gauge symmetries]]. Gauge symmetries in the [[Standard model]], used to describe three of the [[fundamental interaction]]s, are based on the  [[SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1)]] group. (Roughly speaking, the symmetries of the SU(3) group describe the [[strong force]], the SU(2) group describes the [[weak interaction]] and the U(1) group describes the [[electromagnetic force]].)

Also, the reduction by symmetry of the energy functional under the action by a group and [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]] of transformations of symmetric groups appear to elucidate topics in [[particle physics]] (for example, the [[electroweak interaction|unification]] of [[electromagnetism]] and the [[weak force]] in [[physical cosmology]]).

===Conservation laws and symmetry===
{{main|Noether's theorem}}
The symmetry properties of a physical system are intimately related to the [[conservation laws]] characterizing that system. [[Noether's theorem]] gives a precise description of this relation. The theorem states that each continuous symmetry of a physical system implies that some physical property of that system is conserved. Conversely, each conserved quantity has a corresponding symmetry. For example, the [[isometry]] of [[space]] gives rise to [[conservation of momentum|conservation of (linear) momentum]], and [[isometry]] of [[time]] gives rise to [[conservation of energy]].

The following table summarizes some fundamental symmetries and the associated conserved quantity.

==Mathematics==
Continuous symmetries in physics preserve transformations. One can specify a symmetry by showing how a very small transformation affects various [[particle field]]s. The [[commutator]] of two of these infinitesimal  transformations are equivalent to a third infinitesimal transformation of the same kind hence they form a [[Lie algebra]].

A general coordinate transformation (also known as a [[diffeomorphism]]) has the infinitesimal effect on a [[scalar field|scalar]], [[spinor field|spinor]] and [[vector field]] for example:

&lt;math&gt;
\delta\phi(x) = h^{\mu}(x)\partial_{\mu}\phi(x) 
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\delta\psi^\alpha(x) = h^{\mu}(x)\partial_{\mu}\psi^\alpha(x) +  \partial_\mu h_\nu(x) \sigma_{\mu\nu}^{\alpha \beta} \psi^{\beta}(x)
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\delta A_\mu(x) = h^{\nu}(x)\partial_{\nu}A_\mu(x) + A_\nu(x)\partial_\mu h^{\nu}(x) 
&lt;/math&gt;

for a general field, &lt;math&gt;h(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Without gravity only the Poincaré symmetries are preserved which restricts &lt;math&gt;h(x)&lt;/math&gt; to be of the form:

&lt;math&gt;
h^{\mu}(x) = M^{\mu \nu}x_\nu + P^\mu 
&lt;/math&gt;

where '''M''' is an antisymmetric [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] (giving the Lorentz and rotational symmetries) and '''P''' is a general vector (giving the translational symmetries). Other symmetries affect multiple fields simultaneously. For example, local gauge transformations apply to both a vector and spinor field:

&lt;math&gt;
\delta\psi^\alpha(x) = \lambda(x).\tau^{\alpha\beta}\psi^\beta(x) 
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\delta A_\mu(x) = \partial_\mu \lambda(x)
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; are generators of a particular [[Lie group]]. So far the transformations on the right have only included fields of the same type. Supersymmetries are defined according to how the mix fields of ''different'' types.

Another symmetry which is part of some theories of physics and not in others is scale invariance which involve Weyl transformations of the following kind:

&lt;math&gt;
\delta \phi(x) = \Omega(x) \phi(x) 
&lt;/math&gt;

If the fields have this symmetry then it can be shown that the field theory is almost certainly conformally invariant also. This means that in the absence of gravity h(x) would restricted to the form:

&lt;math&gt;
h^{\mu}(x) = M^{\mu \nu}x_\nu + P^\mu + D x_\mu + K^{\mu} |x|^2 - 2 K^\nu x_\nu x_\mu 
&lt;/math&gt;

with '''D''' generating scale transformations and '''K''' generating special conformal transformations. For example, N=4 super-[[Yang-Mills]] theory has this symmetry while [[General Relativity]] doesn't although other theories of gravity such as [[conformal gravity]] do. The 'action' of a field theory is an [[invariant (physics)|invariant]] under all the symmetries of the theory. Much of modern theoretical physics is to do with speculating on the various symmetries the Universe may have and finding the invariants to construct field theories as models.

In string theories, since a string can be decomposed into an infinite number of particle fields, the symmetries on the string world sheet is equivalent to special transformations which mix an infinite number of fields.
