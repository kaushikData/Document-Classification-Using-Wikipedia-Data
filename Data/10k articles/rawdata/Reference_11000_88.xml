'''Abe Kelmer'''&lt;ref name="Oliver"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2007/03/28/3860797.html|title=Depression era grappler Abe Coleman, 101, dies|date=March 28, 2011|last=Oliver|first=Greg|accessdate=December 26, 2011|work=Slam! Sports|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; / '''Abba Kelmer'''&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; (September 20, 1905 – March 28, 2007) was a [[Poles|Polish]] [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]], promoter and referee, known by the [[ring name]]s '''Abe Coleman''', '''Hebrew Hercules''', and '''Jewish Tarzan'''.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; At the time of his death, Coleman was believed to be the oldest professional wrestler in the world.

== Early life ==
Kelmer was born to a [[Jews|Jewish family]] in [[Żychlin]], [[Poland]] in 1905.&lt;ref name="Oliver"/&gt; His father was a coal-seller.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; Kelmer had 15 older brothers and sisters, some of whom perished in the [[Holocaust]].&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60A14F935540C718CDDAD0894DF404482#|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Abe Coleman, 101, Wrestler Known as Hebrew Hercules|first=Douglas|last=Martin|date=April 2, 2007|accessdate=April 23, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916101131/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60A14F935540C718CDDAD0894DF404482|archive-date=2012-09-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923, he emigrated to [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], [[Canada]], and later moved to [[New York City]] in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oliver"/&gt;

== Professional wrestling career ==
According to the [[Canadian Online Explorer]]'s [[Greg Oliver]], there is debate regarding Kelmer's debut in professional wrestling. In 1929, local promoter Rudy Miller offered Coleman $25 to wrestle after seeing him work out in a [[Brooklyn]] gym.&lt;ref name="Oliver"/&gt;  Despite this, an "Abe Coleman" wrestled to a draw with [[George Deslonchamps]] on March 19, 1928, at [[Madison Square Garden]], but it is unknown if it was Kelmer or another wrestler with the same ring name.&lt;ref name="Oliver"/&gt;

Coleman is also credited with the invention of the [[dropkick]], claiming the move was inspired by [[kangaroo]]s he saw on a tour of [[Australia]] in 1930.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oliver"/&gt;

Coleman was never a champion, but was regarded as a solid midcard worker.&lt;ref name="Oliver"/&gt; In the 1930s, Coleman defeated [[Jim Londos]] in a match in a [[Mexico City]] bullring in front of 60,000 spectators.&lt;ref name="Oliver"/&gt; During a 1936 match against [[Man Mountain Dean]] in front of 36,000 people, Coleman slammed Dean to the ground, breaking the ring mat and dropping the pair down to the arena floor.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oliver"/&gt;

Following his retirement from active in-ring competition, Coleman became a [[Referee (professional wrestling)|professional wrestling referee]].&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; He also promoted several wrestling shows with [[Bill Johnston (wrestling)|Bill Johnston]].&lt;ref name="Oliver"/&gt;

== After wrestling ==
Following his retirement from wrestling, Kelmer inspected [[vehicle registration plate|license plates]] for the [[New York (state)|New York State]] [[Department of Motor Vehicles]].&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

== Personal life ==
Kelmer met June Miller in 1936, stating he met her in Madison Square Garden when he landed in her lap after being thrown from the [[Wrestling ring|ring]].&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; They married three years later in 1939.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; The couple had no children, and Miller died in 1987.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; Kelmer lived in [[Forest Hills, New York]].&lt;ref name="Oliver"/&gt; It was in Forest Hills that Kelmer subdued two attempted muggers when he was in his 80s.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oliver"/&gt;

Outside of wrestling, Kelmer's interests included [[poker]] and [[horse racing]].&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

In his final years, Kelmer was confined to a wheelchair and lived at the Meadow Park Rehabilitation and Health Care Center in [[Flushing, New York]].&lt;ref name="Oliver"/&gt; Kelmer died on March 28, 2007, in a nursing home in Queens, New York, of kidney failure.&lt;ref name="Oliver"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Oldest pro wrestler passes away today|work=[[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]|date=2007-03-28|url=http://www.wrestlingobserver.com/wo/news/headlines/default.asp?aID=19072|accessdate = 2007-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Annales Palidenses''''' ({{lang-de|Pöhlder Annalen}} or ''Pöhlder Chronik'') are a set of medieval [[annals]] written in [[Medieval Latin|Latin]] in the late 12th century.

The manuscripts probably arose at the [[Premonstratensians|Premonstratensian]] monastery of [[Pöhlde Abbey|Pöhlde]] in the [[Harz]] region, composed by a monk named Theodore (''Theodorus monachus'') some time between 1182 and 1197.{{sfn|Schauerte|2013}} In 1877, the original was rediscovered by the German historian [[Georg Waitz]] at the Oxford [[Bodleian Library]] (''[[William Laud|Laud]] Misc. 633''). The [[University of Göttingen]] shelves a 17th-century copy.

The ''Annales'' fall in the Christian tradition of [[universal history]] and are an important source for the history of high medieval [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]] as pictured in the later [[Sächsische Weltchronik|Saxon World Chronicle]]. Nevertheless, they have little to say about the history of [[Pöhlde]] itself, despite the fact that it was the site of an [[Kaiserpfalz|imperial palace]] under the [[Ottonian dynasty]].{{sfn|Schauerte|2013}}

The early centuries, from the beginning of the world, are covered by adapting text from the early twelfth-century chroniclers [[Honorius Augustodunensis|Honorius of Autun]], [[Ekkehard of Aura]] and [[Sigebert of Gembloux]]. Only from the year 469 onwards is the text mostly unique, although parts are based on [[Paul the Deacon]]. The last annals concentrate on the history of the [[Kingdom of Germany|German kingdom]] down to the exile of Duke [[Henry the Lion]] in 1182.{{sfn|Schauerte|2013}} An annex lists all [[Pope]]s and [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s since the birth of Christ down to Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] (1220). Some supplements on the history of Pöhlde Abbey and the [[Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg]] reach up to the year 1421.

The ''Annales Palidenses'' are the only source to claim that [[Roger II of Sicily]] became a monk shortly before his death.{{sfn|Houben|2002|p=110 n. 28}} They are also the first to mention the epithet of King [[Henry the Fowler]] (i.e., one who hunts with fowl).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17092">'''Archival processing''' is the act of surveying, arranging, describing, and performing basic [[Preservation (library and archival science)|preservation]] activities on the recorded material of an individual, family, or organization, after they are permanently transferred to an archive. A person engaging in this activity is known as an ''archival processor, archival technician,'' or [[archivist]].

Ideally, when an [[archives]] receives a collection of papers or a group of records, they will have been arranged by the originator (the original person, persons, or organization that created or assembled the collection or records) and boxed up for the move to the archives in such a way that this order has been preserved. However, collections and record groups are often semi-organized, and sometimes lack any discernible organization. Observing the organization of delivered materials, imposing organization where it is lacking, then describing the organized material are tasks covered by the terms "archival processing", "arrangement and description", "archival listing", or "cataloguing".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Collection Surveying==

The first step in archival processing is to survey the collection. The goal of a survey is to gain an understanding of the originator, determine the context of the creation of the collection, to observe the material's overall size and scope, to ascertain if the collection has access limitations, to locate any existing finding aids submitted with the collection, and to discover any underlying organizational scheme in the collection or record group.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://clir.pacscl.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Survey_and_Processing-Manual.pdf|title=Surveying and Minimal Processing Manual - Hidden Collections Processing Project|last=Mengel|first=Holly|last2=Smerz|first2=Courtney|date=March 2012|website=PACSCL Hidden Collections Processing Project|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150921200615/http://clir.pacscl.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Survey_and_Processing-Manual.pdf|archive-date=September 21, 2015|dead-url=|access-date=November 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Collection surveys should be carried out with an archival principle, ''[[respect des fonds]],'' in mind. In following with ''[[respect des fonds]]'', which may be translated as "taking into consideration the entirety of the collection,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bibliographical foundations of French historical studies.|last=Bartlett|first=Nancy|publisher=Haworth Press|year=1992|isbn=978-1-56024-150-8|location=|pages=106-114|chapter=The Origins of the Modern Archival Principle of Provenance}}&lt;/ref&gt; the survey must include activity to ascertain whether the materials in hand are all, or only a portion, of the entire ''[[fonds]]''. If the archivist is in a repository that holds other parts of the ''fonds'', he or she should assemble a plan of work that encompasses, or at least acknowledges, the entire set of materials from the same originator.  

Surveying collections is a strictly observational task, without making any changes or rearrangements to the materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://guides.uflib.ufl.edu/archivalprocessing/surveying|title=Guides @ UF: Archival Processing: Surveying|last=Kruse|first=Matthew|website=guides.uflib.ufl.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because many organizations require use of a template or worksheet to ensure the surveys are thorough and consistent, the typical end products of a collection survey is a completed survey worksheet and a processing plan.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scholarworks.umb.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1028&amp;context=hlpubs|title=Processing Manual for Archival and Manuscript Collections|last=|first=|date=February 2017|website=University Archives and Special Collections University of Massachusetts Boston|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the completion of the survey, the materials may be made available to researchers without additional processing, stored for future processing when resources are available, or progress to processing immediately.  

== Arrangement ==
Arrangement of materials should be completed with two archival principles that fall within ''[[respect des fonds]]'' in mind: ''[[Provenance#Archives|provenance]]'' and [[Original order|o''riginal order'']]. 

According to the principle of ''[[Provenance#Archives|provenance]],'' an originator’s materials should be maintained together and separated from those of other originators. Under the rules of ''[[Provenance#Archives|provenance]]'', maintenance of the materials must include making them searchable and retrievable together (known as their intellectual arrangement) and could include keeping them physically together, if it is practical to do so. Additionally, if the materials have changed hands beyond the originator, the [[Provenance#Archives|provenance]] of an item includes all those who came after the creator and any changes they make to the collection such as insertions, deletions, rearranging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.archivists.org/standards/DACS/statement_of_principles|title=Statement of Principles {{!}} Society of American Archivists|website=www2.archivists.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to the principle of ''[[original order]]'', the originator’s arrangement of the materials holds value, because it reflects how they originally used and accessed the collection, as well as how the records relate to each other, which can both inform the initial purpose of the records.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Depending on the collection, rearrangement of the materials may not be required if a logical [[original order]] appears to have been maintained, the arrangement provides contextual clues about the purpose of the records and the arrangement does not interfere with researcher access to the materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://beinecke.library.yale.edu/31-provenance-and-original-order|title=3.1 Provenance and Original Order  {{!}} Beinecke Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library|website=beinecke.library.yale.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; If rearrangement is required, archival processors will arrange the materials at the collection level, series level, subseries level, box level, folder level, or item level.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The level of arrangement is determined by a number of factors, which include but are not limited to the orderliness of the material, the probable [[researcher]] interest and research value in the collection&lt;sup&gt;[[Archival processing#cite%20note-%3A1-2|[2]]]&lt;/sup&gt;, and the policy and resources of the repository.

If arrangement tasks are required, arrangement is the first phase of physically processing the materials after the survey. In addition to rearranging the materials, there may also be weeding of material that does not meet a repository's collecting guidelines, as well as the [[Preservation (library and archival science)|preservation]] activities described below.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/a/arrangement|title=arrangement {{!}} Society of American Archivists|website=www2.archivists.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More detailed descriptions than that which results from a collection survey of the material are generally attempted. Beyond the survey, the individual processing the collection may create a listing of the "series"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/s/series|title=series {{!}} Society of American Archivists|website=www2.archivists.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "sub-series,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/s/subseries|title=subseries {{!}} Society of American Archivists|website=www2.archivists.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; listing of box contents (also called box-level description), folder lists (folder-level description), or even complete inventories&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/d/depth-of-description|title=depth of description {{!}} Society of American Archivists|website=www2.archivists.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; that include administrative histories or biographical notes, scope notes, acquisition information, and information as to the archival processing treatment the material has received.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/l/level-of-description|title=level of description {{!}} Society of American Archivists|website=www2.archivists.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://guides.uflib.ufl.edu/archivalprocessing/notes|title=Guides @ UF: Archival Processing: Finding Aid Notes|last=Kruse|first=Matthew|website=guides.uflib.ufl.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some repositories will conduct item-level description of selected documents within a collection or group of records, if the research value is deemed to be extremely high, heavy use is expected, or the risk of theft is heightened.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Finding aids===

The written description of a collection is generically termed a [[finding aid]]. The main purpose of a [[finding aid]] is to facilitate access to a collection of materials by users,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duff|first=Wendy|last2=Johnson|first2=Catherine|date=2001|title=A Virtual Expression of Need: An Analysis of E-Mail Reference Questions|url=http://americanarchivist.org/doi/pdf/10.17723/aarc.64.1.q711461786663p33|journal=American Archivist|volume=54:1|issue=Spring/Summer 2001|pages=43-60|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can also useful for other archivists who provide reference services to the materials currently and in the future. The earliest finding aids were known as "[[Calendar (archives)|calendars]]" and generally consisted of a listing of individual documents in chronological order, which was the preferred organizational method of historians, who were their primary users at the time. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Archival Theory and Practice in the United States: A Historical Analysis|last=Berner|first=Richard|publisher=University of Washington Press|year=1983|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/c/calendar|title=calendar {{!}} Society of American Archivists|website=www2.archivists.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently used forms of [[Finding aid|finding aids]] vary in length and fall into several categories by type, with the inventory predominating in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Many archives post their finding aids online to widen exposure to their holdings and some are encoded (see Standards section below) to facilitate recognition by [[Web search engine|web search engines]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pitti|first=Daniel V.|date=1997|title=Encoded Archival Description: The Development of an Encoding Standard for Archival Finding Aids|url=www.jstor.org/stable/40294437|journal=The American Archivist|volume=60, no. 3|pages=268-283|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Standards===
Several [[Standardization|standard]]s govern archival description, some national and some international. [[ISAD(G)]], the General International Standard Archival Description, defines the elements that should be included in a finding aid.  Other content standards also pertain. In the United States, proper names may be checked against the [[Library of Congress]] Name Authority Files and subject headings are drawn from the [[LCSH]]. Genre terms are often taken from the [[Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus]]. Many finding aids are encoded ([[markup language|marked up]]) in [[XML]]; in such cases, the [[Encoded Archival Description]] (EAD) standard can be used. In addition, repositories may follow local practices designed to make finding aids serve their particular mission.

The [[Society of American Archivists]] (SAA) has published a number of [[best practices]] for American archivists; two important ones are ''[[Archives, Personal Papers and Manuscripts]]'', often abbreviated as APPM, and ''[[Describing Archives: A Content Standard]]'' (DACS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.archivists.org/groups/technical-subcommittee-on-describing-archives-a-content-standard-dacs/dacs|title=Describing Archives: A Content Standard (DACS), Second Edition {{!}} Society of American Archivists|website=www2.archivists.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; SAA's publication ''Standards for Archival Description: A Handbook'' provides an overview of relevant standards for all phases of archival and manuscripts processing. The [[Research Libraries Group]] has published a best practices document for use with EAD.

The [[Archives and Records Association]], the British equivalent of the SAA, has published a number of best practices for U.K. archivists on topics ranging from school records retention to historical accounting records.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.archives.org.uk/publications.html Society of Archivists: Publications {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061002003303/http://www.archives.org.uk/publications.html |date=October 2, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Australian Society of Archivists]] published ''Describing Archives in Context: A Guide to Australasian Practice'' in 2004, which provides the basis for description using the [[Australian Series System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boadle|first=Don|date=2007-12|title=Describing Archives in Context: A Guide to Australasian Practice Australian Society of Archivists Committee on Descriptive Standards|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2Fabs%2F10.1080%2F00048623.2007.10721314|journal=Australian Academic &amp; Research Libraries|language=en|volume=38|issue=4|pages=298–299|doi=10.1080/00048623.2007.10721314|issn=0004-8623}}&lt;/ref&gt; Series description is based on the primacy of the series as a basis for arrangement and description, rather than on [[fonds]] as is the practice in other jurisdictions.

==Preservation activities==

Archival processing often includes basic [[Preservation (library and archival science)|preservation]] practices such as removing staples and paperclips, placing materials in [[Acid-free paper|acid-free]] folders and boxes, isolating acidic materials to avoid acid migration, photocopying damaged or acidic documents, and unfolding papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lib.umd.edu/binaries/content/assets/public/special/forms/umprocessingmanual.pdf|title=Processing Manual for Archival and Manuscript Collections|last=|first=|date=September 2011|website=University of Maryland Libraries College Park, MD|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been a trend for archives and [[manuscript]] repositories in the past few years to try new ways to reduce backlogs and provide access to materials as quickly as possible, described and encouraged by the 2005 article, “[[More Product, Less Process|More Product, Less Process: Revamping Traditional Archival Processing]]” by Mark A. Greene and Dennis Meissner.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greene|first=Mark A.|author2=Dennis Meissner|date=|year=2005|title=More Product, Less Process: Revamping Traditional Archival Processing|URL=http://www.archivists.org/prof-education/pre-readings/IMPLP/AA68.2.MeissnerGreene.pdf|journal=[[American Archivist]]|volume=68|pages=208–263|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their method discourages these basic practices in the interest of accelerating processing to provide quicker access to researchers.Their argument also acknowledges the assumption of proper climate control in modern institutions, which would slow the deterioration of acidic paper and rusting of metal fasteners.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''blackfin tuna''' (''Thunnus atlanticus'') is the smallest [[tuna]] species in the genus ''[[Thunnus]]'', generally growing to a maximum of {{convert|100|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length and weighing 21&amp;nbsp;kg (46 lb).

Blackfin tuna have oval-shaped bodies, black backs with a slight yellow on the finlets, and yellow on the sides of their bodies. They are found in the western Atlantic from [[Martha's Vineyard]], [[Massachusetts]], to [[Brazil]], including the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico.&lt;ref name = FishBase/&gt;

Blackfin tuna hunt both [[Epipelagic fish|epipelagic]] (surface) and [[Mesopelagic fish|mesopelagic]] (deeper water) fish and squid. They also eat [[crustacean]]s such as shrimp, crabs, [[amphipod]]s, [[stomatopod]]s, and the larvae of [[decapoda|decapods]].&lt;ref name = FishBase/&gt; They are a short-lived, fast-growing species; a 5-yr-old fish would be considered old. They reach sexual maturity at the age of 2 years, and spawn in the open sea during the summer. Blackfin tuna are a warmer-water fish, preferring water temperatures over {{convert|20|C|abbr=on}}.

==Sustainable consumption==
In 2010,  Greenpeace International did not add the blackfin tuna, unlike other tuna species, to its seafood red list. &lt;!-- "The Greenpeace International seafood red list is a list of fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries." --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/international/seafood/red-list-of-species Greenpeace International Seafood Red list] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205030730/http://www.greenpeace.org/international/seafood/red-list-of-species |date=February 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3129">The '''Blatter Herbarium''', in [[St. Xavier's College, Mumbai]], is a major [[Herbarium]] in [[India]]. It is listed in the ''Index Herbariorum'', published by the [[International Association for Plant Taxonomy]] and [[New York Botanical Garden]]. The [[Herbarium]] specializes in the vascular plants of western [[India]]; algae, mosses, and fungi of [[Mumbai]]; seed samples of medicinally and economically important plants of [[Maharashtra]], and wood samples of Maharashtra. The institute holds the largest botanical collection in western India.

==History==
The Herbarium was founded by the [[Jesuit]] priest and taxonomist, [[Ethelbert Blatter]], SJ. It was renamed in his honour in 1941 by his associate and director of the Herbarium, Father Henry Santapau, [[Jesuit|SJ]]. Father Santapau went on to direct the Botanical Survey of India, and was recognized by the Indian Government with a [[Padmashri]] in 1964 for his services to Indian botany.

The two priests are regarded as pioneers in Indian plant taxonomy, and contributed over 500 scientific articles to various journals. They also wrote a number of books, like ''The Flora of Aden, Arabia''; ''Beautiful Flowers of Kashmir''; ''The Bombay Grasses''; ''Palms of Asia''; ''Orchids of Bombay''; ''Medicinal and Poisonous plants of India''; ''Flora of Khandala''; ''Acanthaceae of Bombay'', and ''Trees of Bombay''.

The Herbarium is currently engaged in a variety of national projects, including surveys of medicinally and economically important plants of Western Maharashtra, the flora of [[Ratnagiri]] District, [[ethnobiology]] of [[Goa]] Tribals, and the trees of Mumbai.

Many scholars make use of the institute's facilities to conduct post-graduate and doctoral studies.

==Collections==
The Herbarium contains a flowering plants collection that dates back to 1816, with over 3,00,000 specimens from all over India. It maintains type materials for about 400 plants which have been identified as new species over a period of time. It holds large [[alga]], [[fungus]], [[bryophyte]], [[pteridophyte]] and [[gymnosperm]] collections. It also has obtained specimens from regions like [[Sindh]], [[Arabia]], [[Australia]], [[Germany]] and [[Switzerland]].

The institute's museum preserves wood, seed and fruit samples of plants with medicinal properties. Pickled specimens of algae, fungi and [[lichen]] are also stored in the museum.

The attached library boasts of a copy of the first book printed in India - ''[[Colóquios dos simples e drogas da India]]'' (1563) by [[Garcia de Orta]]. Besides the ''[[Hortus Malabaricus]]'' (The Gardens of [[Malabar Coast|Malabar]]) by [[Hendrik van Rheede]] from 1678, the library contains a compendium of botanical literature and Indian and international journals on botany.

The '''''Bureau du Roi''''' ({{IPA-fr|byʁo dy ʁwa}}, ''the King's desk''), also known as '''Louis XV's roll-top secretary''' ({{lang-fr|Secrétaire à cylindre de Louis XV}}), is the richly ornamented royal [[cylinder desk]] which was constructed at the end of [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]]'s reign, and is now again in the [[Palace of Versailles]].

==History==
[[File:Secrétaire à cylindre de Louis XV 4.JPG|thumb|left]]
The ''Bureau du Roi'' was probably started in 1760, when the commission was formally announced. Its first designer was [[Jean Francis Oeben|Jean-François Oeben]], the master cabinet maker of the royal arsenal. The first step in its construction was the fabrication of an extremely detailed miniature model in wax. The full scale desk was finished in 1769 by his successor, [[Jean Henri Riesener]], who had married Oeben's widow. 

Made for the new ''Cabinet du Roi'' at the Palace of Versailles, it was transferred to the [[Louvre]] Museum in [[Paris]] after the [[French Revolution]], but has been returned to the Palace of Versailles in the 20th century where it stands again in the room where it was standing before the Revolution, i.e. the ''Cabinet intérieur du Petit Appartement'' ("Inner study of the Private Apartments"), the famous study room where kings [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] and [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] carried out their daily work, and where King [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] decided to support the [[American Revolutionary War|American insurgents]] in 1777. Secret diplomatic papers were kept inside the secretary's secret drawers, whose only key the king always carried with him.

==Description==
The desk is covered with intricate [[marquetry]] of a wide variety of fine woods. In an oval reserve at the center of its 'public' side, away from the king himself, is the marquetry head of Silence, with forefinger to lips, a reminder of the discretion required in the king's business. Gilt-bronze moldings of plaques, statuettes, miniature busts and vases, even integral scrolling gilt-bronze candle stands, further adorn the surfaces of the desk. The original design was to have a miniature bust of [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] on top, but it was replaced by [[Minerva]] after his death in 1770.

Riesener later executed a simplified second version of the Bureau du Roi for Pierre-Gaspard-Marie Grimod, comte d'Orsay; today this may be seen in the [[Wallace Collection]] in [[London]]. His copy was the first of a number of replicas that were produced from the 1870s onwards by leading cabinetmakers in Paris, including four examples by [[François Linke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://wallacelive.wallacecollection.org/eMuseumPlus?service=ExternalInterface&amp;module=collection&amp;objectId=64070&amp;viewType=detailView|title = The Wallace Collection: Copy of the bureau du roi of Louis XV|date = |accessdate = 2015-12-18|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chinese''' ({{zh|s=汉语|t=漢語|p=Hànyǔ|l=[[Han Chinese|Han]] language}}; or {{zh|s=中文|p=Zhōngwén|l=Chinese writing|links=no}}) is a group of related, but in many cases not [[Mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]], language [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]], forming the Sinitic branch of the [[Sino-Tibetan language family]]. Chinese is spoken by the [[Han Chinese|Han]] majority and many minority ethnic groups in [[China]]. About 1.2 billion people (around 16% of the world's population) speak some form of Chinese as their [[first language]].

The [[varieties of Chinese]] are usually described by native speakers as dialects of a single Chinese language, but linguists note that they are as diverse as a [[language family]].{{efn|Various examples include:
* David Crystal, ''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1987), p. 312. "The mutual unintelligibility of the varieties is the main ground for referring to them as separate languages."
* Charles N. Li, Sandra A. Thompson. ''Mandarin Chinese: A Functional Reference Grammar'' (1989), p. 2. "The Chinese language family is genetically classified as an independent branch of the Sino-Tibetan language family."
* {{harvtxt|Norman|1988}}, p. 1. "[...] the modern Chinese dialects are really more like a family of languages [...]"
* {{harvtxt|DeFrancis|1984}}, p. 56. "To call Chinese a single language composed of dialects with varying degrees of difference is to mislead by minimizing disparities that according to Chao are as great as those between English and Dutch. To call Chinese a family of languages is to suggest extralinguistic differences that in fact do not exist and to overlook the unique linguistic situation that exists in China."
Linguists in China often use a formulation introduced by [[Fu Maoji]] in the ''[[Encyclopedia of China]]'': “{{Lang|zh|汉语在语言系属分类中相当于一个语族的地位。}}” ("In language classification, Chinese has a status equivalent to a language family."){{sfnp|Mair|1991|pp=10, 21}}
}}
The internal diversity of Chinese has been likened to that of the [[Romance languages]], but may be even more varied. There are between 7 and 13 main regional groups of Chinese (depending on classification scheme), of which the most spoken by far is [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] (about 960 million, e.g. [[Southwestern Mandarin]]), followed by [[Wu Chinese|Wu]] (80 million, e.g. [[Shanghainese]]), [[Min Chinese|Min]] (70 million, e.g. [[Southern Min]]), [[Yue Chinese|Yue]] (60 million, e.g. [[Cantonese]]), etc. Most of these groups are mutually unintelligible, and even dialect groups within Min Chinese may not be mutually intelligible. Some, however, like [[Xiang Chinese|Xiang]] and certain [[Southwest Mandarin]] dialects, may share common terms and a certain degree of intelligibility. All varieties of Chinese are [[tone (linguistics)|tonal]] and [[Analytic language|analytic]].

[[Standard Chinese]] ''(Pǔtōnghuà/Guóyǔ/Huáyǔ)'' is a standardized form of spoken Chinese based on the [[Beijing dialect]] of Mandarin. It is the official language of [[China]] and [[Taiwan]], as well as one of the four official languages of [[Singapore]]. It is one of the [[Official languages of the United Nations|six official languages]] of the [[United Nations]]. The [[written Chinese|written form]] of the standard language ({{lang|zh|中文}}; ''Zhōngwén''), based on the [[logograms]] known as [[Chinese characters]] ({{lang|zh-Hans|汉字}}/{{lang|zh-Hant|漢字}}; ''Hànzì''), is shared by literate speakers of otherwise unintelligible dialects.

The earliest Chinese written records are [[Shang dynasty]]-era oracle inscriptions, which can be traced back to 1250 BCE. The phonetic categories of [[Archaic Chinese]] can be reconstructed from the rhymes of ancient poetry. During the [[Northern and Southern dynasties]] period, [[Middle Chinese]] went through several [[sound changes]] and split into several varieties following prolonged geographic and political separation. ''[[Qieyun]]'', a [[rime dictionary]], recorded a compromise between the pronunciations of different regions. The royal courts of the Ming and early Qing dynasties operated using a [[koiné language]] ([[Mandarin (late imperial lingua franca)|Guanhua]]) based on [[Nanjing dialect]] of [[Lower Yangtze Mandarin]]. [[Standard Chinese]] was adopted in the 1930s, and is now the official language of both the People's Republic of China and Taiwan.

== Classification ==
Most linguists classify all varieties of Chinese as part of the [[Sino-Tibetan language family]], together with [[Burmese language|Burmese]], [[Tibetan languages|Tibetan]] and many other languages spoken in the [[Himalayas]] and the [[Southeast Asian Massif]].{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=12–13}}
Although the relationship was first proposed in the early 19th century and is now broadly accepted, reconstruction of Sino-Tibetan is much less developed than that of families such as [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] or [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]].
Difficulties have included the great diversity of the languages, the lack of inflection in many of them, and the effects of language contact.
In addition, many of the smaller languages are spoken in mountainous areas that are difficult to reach, and are often also sensitive border zones.{{sfnp|Handel|2008|pp=422, 434–436}}
Without a secure reconstruction of proto-Sino-Tibetan, the higher-level structure of the family remains unclear.{{sfnp|Handel|2008|p=426}}
A top-level branching into Chinese and [[Tibeto-Burman languages]] is often assumed, but has not been convincingly demonstrated.{{sfnp|Handel|2008|p=431}}

== History ==
{{main|History of the Chinese language}}

The first written records appeared over 3,000 years ago during the [[Shang dynasty]]. As the language evolved over this period, the various local varieties became mutually unintelligible.  In reaction, central governments have repeatedly sought to promulgate a unified standard.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=183–185}}

=== Old and Middle Chinese ===
The earliest examples of Chinese are divinatory inscriptions on [[oracle bone]]s from around 1250 BCE in the late [[Shang dynasty]].{{sfnp|Schuessler|2007|p=1}}
[[Old Chinese]] was the language of the [[Western Zhou]] period (1046–771 BCE), recorded in [[Chinese bronze inscriptions|inscriptions on bronze artifacts]], the ''[[Classic of Poetry]]'' and portions of the ''[[Book of Documents]]'' and ''[[I Ching]]''.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=2–3}}
Scholars have attempted to reconstruct the [[phonology of Old Chinese]] by comparing later varieties of Chinese with the rhyming practice of the ''Classic of Poetry'' and the phonetic elements found in the majority of Chinese characters.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=42–45}}
Although many of the finer details remain unclear, most scholars agree that Old Chinese differs from Middle Chinese in lacking retroflex and palatal obstruents but having initial consonant clusters of some sort, and in having voiceless nasals and liquids.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=177}}
Most recent reconstructions also describe an atonal language with consonant clusters at the end of the syllable, developing into [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] distinctions in Middle Chinese.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=181–183}}
Several [[derivational affix]]es have also been identified, but the language lacks [[inflection]], and indicated grammatical relationships using word order and [[grammatical particle]]s.{{sfnp|Schuessler|2007|p=12}}

[[Middle Chinese]] was the language used during [[Northern and Southern dynasties]] and the [[Sui dynasty|Sui]], [[Tang dynasty|Tang]], and [[Song dynasty|Song]] dynasties (6th through 10th centuries CE).
It can be divided into an early period, reflected by the ''[[Qieyun]]'' [[rime book]] (601 CE), and a late period in the 10th century, reflected by [[rhyme table]]s such as the ''[[Yunjing]]'' constructed by ancient Chinese philologists as a guide to the ''Qieyun'' system.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=14–15}}
These works define phonological categories, but with little hint of what sounds they represent.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=125}}
Linguists have identified these sounds by comparing the categories with pronunciations in modern [[varieties of Chinese]], [[Sino-Xenic vocabularies|borrowed Chinese words]] in Japanese, Vietnamese, and Korean, and transcription evidence.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=34–42}}
The resulting system is very complex, with a large number of consonants and vowels, but they are probably not all distinguished in any single dialect.  Most linguists now believe it represents a [[diasystem]] encompassing 6th-century northern and southern standards for reading the classics.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=24}}

=== Classical and literary forms ===
{{main|Classical Chinese}}

The relationship between spoken and written Chinese is rather complex. Its spoken varieties have evolved at different rates, while written Chinese itself has changed much less. [[Classical Chinese]] [[literature]] began in the [[Spring and Autumn period]].

=== Rise of northern dialects ===
After the fall of the [[Northern Song]] dynasty, and during the reign of the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin]] (Jurchen) and [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] (Mongol) dynasties in northern China, a common speech (now called [[Old Mandarin]]) developed based on the dialects of the [[North China Plain]] around the capital.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=48}}
The ''[[Zhongyuan Yinyun]]'' (1324) was a dictionary that codified the rhyming conventions of new ''[[sanqu]]'' verse form in this language.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=48–49}}
Together with the slightly later ''[[Menggu Ziyun]]'', this dictionary describes a language with many of the features characteristic of modern [[Mandarin dialects]].{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=49–51}}

Up to the early 20th century, most of the people in China spoke only their local variety.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=133, 247}}
As a practical measure, officials of the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties carried out the administration of the empire using a [[Mandarin (late imperial lingua franca)|common language based on Mandarin varieties]], known as ''Guānhuà'' ({{zh|s=官话|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=官話|labels=no}}, literally "language of officials").{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=136}}
For most of this period, this language was a [[Koiné language|koiné]] based on dialects spoken in the [[Nanjing]] area, though not identical to any single dialect.{{sfnp|Coblin|2000|pp=549–550}}
By the middle of the 19th century, the Beijing dialect had become dominant and was essential for any business with the imperial court.{{sfnp|Coblin|2000|pp=540–541}}

In the 1930s a [[Standard Chinese|standard national language]] ''Guóyǔ'' ({{lang|zh-Hans|国语}}/{{lang|zh-Hant|國語}} "national language") was adopted.
After much dispute between proponents of northern and southern dialects and an abortive attempt at an artificial pronunciation, the [[National Languages Committee|National Language Unification Commission]] finally settled on the Beijing dialect in 1932.
The People's Republic founded in 1949 retained this standard, calling it ''pǔtōnghuà'' ({{lang|zh-Hans|普通话}}/{{lang|zh-Hans|普通話}} "common speech").{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|pp=3–15}}
The national language is now used in education, the media, and formal situations in both Mainland China and Taiwan.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=133}}
In [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], because of their colonial and linguistic history, the language used in education, the media, formal speech, and everyday life remains the local [[Cantonese]], although the standard language has become very influential and is being taught in schools.{{sfnp|Zhang|Yang|2004}}

=== Influence ===
{{see also|Adoption of Chinese literary culture|Sino-Xenic vocabularies}}

[[File:Tripitaka Koreana.jpg|thumb|right|The ''[[Tripitaka Koreana]]'', a Korean collection of the [[Chinese Buddhist canon]]]]

The Chinese language has spread to neighbouring countries through a variety of means.
Northern Vietnam was incorporated into the [[Han empire]] in 111 BCE, marking the beginning of a [[Chinese domination of Vietnam|period of Chinese control]] that ran almost continuously for a millennium.
The [[Four Commanderies of Han|Four Commanderies]] were established in northern Korea in the first century BCE, but disintegrated in the following centuries.{{sfnp|Sohn|Lee|2003|p=23}}
[[Chinese Buddhism]] spread over East Asia between the 2nd and 5th centuries CE, and with it the study of scriptures and literature in [[Literary Chinese]].{{sfnp|Miller|1967|pp=29–30}}
Later Korea, Japan, and Vietnam developed strong central governments modeled on Chinese institutions, with Literary Chinese as the language of administration and scholarship, a position it would retain until the late 19th century in Korea and (to a lesser extent) Japan, and the early 20th century in Vietnam.{{sfnp|Kornicki|2011|pp=75–77}}
Scholars from different lands could communicate, albeit only in writing, using Literary Chinese.{{sfnp|Kornicki|2011|p=67}}

Although they used Chinese solely for written communication, each country had its own tradition of reading texts aloud, the so-called [[Sino-Xenic pronunciations]].
Chinese words with these pronunciations were also extensively imported into the [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] languages, and today comprise over half of their vocabularies.{{sfnp|Miyake|2004|pp=98–99}}
This massive influx led to changes in the phonological structure of the languages, contributing to the development of [[Mora (linguistics)|mora]]ic structure in Japanese{{sfnp|Shibatani|1990|pp=120–121}} and the disruption of vowel harmony in Korean.{{sfnp|Sohn|2001|p=89}}

Borrowed Chinese morphemes have been used extensively in all these languages to coin compound words for new concepts, in a similar way to the use of [[Latin language|Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek]] roots in European languages.{{sfnp|Shibatani|1990|p=146}}
Many new compounds, or new meanings for old phrases, were created in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to name Western concepts and artifacts.
These coinages, written in shared Chinese characters, have then been borrowed freely between languages.
They have even been accepted into Chinese, a language usually resistant to loanwords, because their foreign origin was hidden by their written form.
Often different compounds for the same concept were in circulation for some time before a winner emerged, and sometimes the final choice differed between countries.{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2000|p=43}}
The proportion of vocabulary of Chinese origin thus tends to be greater in technical, abstract, or formal language.
For example, in Japan, [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|Sino-Japanese words]] account for about 35% of the words in entertainment magazines, over half the words in newspapers, and 60% of the words in science magazines.{{sfnp|Shibatani|1990|p=143}}

Vietnam, Korea, and Japan each developed writing systems for their own languages, initially based on [[Chinese characters]], but later replaced with the ''[[Hangul]]'' alphabet for Korean and supplemented with ''[[kana]]'' syllabaries for Japanese, while Vietnamese continued to be written with the complex ''[[Chữ nôm]]'' script.
However, these were limited to popular literature until the late 19th century.
Today Japanese is written with a composite script using both Chinese characters (''[[Kanji]]'') and kana. Korean is written exclusively with Hangul in North Korea, and supplementary Chinese characters (''[[Hanja]]'') are increasingly rarely used in South Korea.
Vietnamese is written with [[Vietnamese alphabet|a Latin-based alphabet]].

Examples of [[List of English words of Chinese origin|loan words in English]] include "[[tea]]", from [[Hokkien]] (Min Nan) ''{{Linktext|tê}}'' ({{Linktext|茶|lang=zh}}), "[[dim sum]]", from Cantonese ''dim&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; sam&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;''  and "[[kumquat]]", from Cantonese ''gam&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;gwat&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;'' ({{Linktext|金橘|lang=zh}}).

&lt;!--This is a summary. Please add new information to [[Varieties of Chinese]].--&gt;
[[Jerry Norman (sinologist)|Jerry Norman]] estimated that there are hundreds of mutually unintelligible varieties of Chinese.{{sfnp|Norman|2003|p=72}} These varieties form a [[dialect continuum]], in which differences in speech generally become more pronounced as distances increase, though the rate of change varies immensely.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=189–190}} Generally, mountainous South China exhibits more linguistic diversity than the [[North China Plain]]. In parts of South China, a major city's dialect may only be marginally intelligible to close neighbors. For instance, [[Wuzhou]] is about {{convert|120|mi|km}} upstream from [[Guangzhou]], but the [[Yue Chinese|Yue]] variety spoken there is more like that of Guangzhou than is that of [[Taishan, Guangdong|Taishan]], {{convert|60|mi|km|round=5}} southwest of Guangzhou and separated from it by several rivers.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=23}} In parts of [[Fujian]] the speech of neighboring counties or even villages may be mutually unintelligible.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=188}}

Until the late 20th century, Chinese emigrants to Southeast Asia and North America came from southeast coastal areas, where Min, Hakka, and Yue dialects are spoken.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=191}}
The vast majority of Chinese immigrants to North America spoke the [[Taishan dialect]], from a small coastal area southwest of [[Guangzhou]].{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=98}}

Local varieties of Chinese are conventionally classified into seven dialect groups, largely on the basis of the different evolution of [[Middle Chinese]] voiced initials:{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=181}}{{sfnp|Kurpaska|2010|pp=53–55}}
* [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], including [[Standard Chinese]], [[Beijing dialect|Pekinese]], [[Sichuanese Mandarin|Sichuanese]], and also the [[Dungan language]] spoken in [[Central Asia]]
* [[Wu Chinese|Wu]], including [[Shanghainese dialect|Shanghainese]], [[Suzhou dialect|Suzhounese]], and [[Wenzhounese]]
* [[Gan Chinese|Gan]]
* [[Xiang Chinese|Xiang]]
* [[Min Chinese|Min]], including [[Fuzhou dialect|Fuzhounese]], [[Hainanese]], [[Hokkien]], [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Taiwanese]] and [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]]
* [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]]
* [[Yue Chinese|Yue]], including [[Cantonese]] and [[Taishanese]]

The classification of [[Li Rong (linguist)|Li Rong]], which is used in the ''[[Language Atlas of China]]'' (1987), distinguishes three further groups:{{sfnp|Wurm|Li|Baumann|Lee|1987}}{{sfnp|Kurpaska|2010|pp=55–56}}
* [[Jin Chinese|Jin]], previously included in Mandarin.
* [[Huizhou Chinese|Huizhou]], previously included in Wu.
* [[Pinghua Chinese|Pinghua]], previously included in Yue.

Some varieties remain unclassified, including [[Danzhou dialect]] (spoken in [[Danzhou]], on [[Hainan]] Island), [[Waxianghua]] (spoken in western [[Hunan]]) and [[Shaozhou Tuhua]] (spoken in northern [[Guangdong]]).{{sfnp|Kurpaska|2010|pp=72–73}}

=== Standard Chinese ===
{{Main|Standard Chinese|List of countries where Chinese is an official language}}
&lt;!--This is a SUMMARY. Please add new information to [[Standard Chinese]].--&gt;
[[Standard Chinese]], often called Mandarin, is the official [[standard language]] of [[China]] and [[Taiwan]], and one of the four official languages of [[Singapore]] (where it is called "Huáyŭ" {{lang|zh-Hans|华语}} or simply Chinese). Standard Chinese is based on the [[Beijing dialect]], the dialect of [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] as spoken in [[Beijing]]. The governments of both China and Taiwan intend for speakers of all Chinese speech varieties to use it as a common language of communication. Therefore, it is used in government agencies, in the media, and as a language of instruction in schools.

In [[mainland China]] and Taiwan, [[diglossia]] has been a common feature. For example, in addition to Standard Chinese, a resident of [[Shanghai]] might speak [[Shanghainese]]; and, if he or she grew up elsewhere, then he or she is also likely to be fluent in the particular dialect of that local area. A native of [[Guangzhou]] may speak both Cantonese and Standard Chinese. In addition to Mandarin, most [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] also speak [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Minnan]], [[Hakka language|Hakka]], or an [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Klöter |first=Henning |date=2004 |journal=China Perspectives |volume=56 |issn=1996-4617 |url=http://chinaperspectives.revues.org/442 |title=Language Policy in the KMT and DPP eras |accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Taiwanese may commonly mix pronunciations, phrases, and words from Mandarin and other [[Languages of Taiwan|Taiwanese languages]], and this mixture is considered normal in daily or informal speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Kuo |first=Yun-Hsuan |date=2005 |title=New dialect formation : the case of Taiwanese Mandarin |type=PhD |trans-title= |chapter= |publisher=University of Essex |docket= |oclc= |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/YUN-HSUAN_KUO |access-date=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nomenclature ===
The official Chinese designation for the major branches of Chinese is ''fāngyán'' ({{lang|zh|方言}}, literally "regional speech"), whereas the more closely related varieties within these are called ''dìdiǎn fāngyán'' ({{lang|zh-hans|地点方言}}/{{lang|zh-hant|地點方言}} "local speech").{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1984|p=57}}  Conventional English-language usage in Chinese linguistics is to use ''dialect'' for the speech of a particular place (regardless of status) and ''dialect group'' for a regional grouping such as Mandarin or Wu.{{sfnp|Norman|2003|p=72}}  Because varieties from different groups are not [[mutually intelligible]], some scholars prefer to describe Wu and others as separate languages.{{sfnp|Thomason|1988|pp=27–28}}{{better source|reason=This claim needs a source specifically saying that scholars do this and for this reason|date=June 2015}} [[Jerry Norman (sinologist)|Jerry Norman]] called this practice misleading, pointing out that Wu, which itself contains many mutually unintelligible varieties, could not be properly called a single language under the same criterion, and that the same is true for each of the other groups.{{sfnp|Norman|2003|p=72}}

Mutual intelligibility is considered by some linguists to be the main criterion for determining whether varieties are separate languages or dialects of a single language,{{sfnp|Mair|1991|p=17}} although others do not regard it as decisive,{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1984|p=54}}{{sfnp|Romaine|2000|pp=13, 23}}{{sfnp|Wardaugh|Fuller|2014|pp=28–32}}{{sfnp|Liang|2014|pp=11–14}}{{sfnp|Hymes|1971|p=64}} particularly when cultural factors interfere as they do with Chinese.{{sfnp|Thomason|1988|p=27}} As {{Harvcoltxt|Campbell|2008}} explains, linguists often ignore mutual intelligibility when varieties share intelligibility with a central variety (i.e. [[prestige variety]], such as [[Standard Mandarin]]), as the issue requires some careful handling when mutual intelligibility is inconsistent with language identity.{{sfnp|Campbell|2008|p=637}} [[John DeFrancis]] argues that it is inappropriate to refer to Mandarin, Wu and so on as "dialects" because the mutual unintelligibility between them is too great. On the other hand, he also objects to considering them as separate languages, as it incorrectly implies a set of disruptive "religious, economic, political, and other differences" between speakers that exist, for example, between [[French language in Canada|French Catholics]] and English Protestants in Canada, but not between speakers of Cantonese and Mandarin in China, owing to China's near-uninterrupted history of centralized government.{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1984|pp=55–57}}

Because of the difficulties involved in determining the difference between language and dialect, other terms have been proposed: [[ISO 639-3]] follows ''[[Ethnologue]]'' in assigning individual language codes to the 13 main subdivisions, while Chinese as a whole is classified as a '[[macrolanguage]]'.{{sfnp|Lewis|Simons|Fennig|2015}} Other options include ''vernacular'',{{sfnp|Haugen|1966|p=927}} ''lect'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bailey|1973|p=11}}, cited in {{Harvcoltxt|Groves|2008|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''regionalect'',{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1984|p=57}} ''topolect'',{{sfnp|Mair|1991|p=7}} and ''variety''.{{sfnp|Hudson|1996|p=22}}

Most Chinese people consider the spoken varieties as one single language because speakers share a common culture and history, as well as a shared national identity and a common written form.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=7–8}} To Chinese nationalists, the idea of Chinese as a language family may suggest that the Chinese identity is much more fragmented and disunified than it actually is and as such is often looked upon as culturally and politically provocative. Additionally, {{citation needed span|in [[Taiwan]] it is closely associated with [[Taiwanese independence]],|date=June 2015}} some of whose supporters promote the local [[Taiwanese Hokkien]] variety.

== Phonology ==
{{see also|Standard Chinese phonology|Historical Chinese phonology|Varieties of Chinese#Phonology}}

[[File:Edmund_Yeo_-_voice_-_ch_150127_1828.wav|thumb|Spoken [[Mandarin Chinese]]]]

The [[phonology|phonological]] structure of each syllable consists of a [[syllable nucleus|nucleus]] that has a [[vowel]] (which can be a [[monophthong]], [[diphthong]], or even a [[triphthong]] in certain varieties), preceded by an [[syllable onset|onset]] (a single [[consonant]], or consonant+[[semivowel|glide]]; zero onset is also possible), and followed (optionally) by a [[syllable coda|coda]] consonant; a syllable also carries a [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]. There are some instances where a vowel is not used as a nucleus. An example of this is in [[Cantonese]], where the [[nasal stop|nasal]] [[sonorant]] consonants {{IPA|/m/}} and {{IPA|/ŋ/}} can stand alone as their own syllable.

In Mandarin much more than in other spoken varieties, most syllables tend to be open syllables, meaning they have no coda (assuming that a final [[semivowel|glide]] is not analyzed as a coda), but syllables that do have codas are restricted to nasals {{IPA|/m/}}, {{IPA|/n/}}, {{IPA|/ŋ/}}, the retroflex approximant {{IPA|/ɻ /}}, and voiceless stops {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/k/}}, or {{IPA|/ʔ/}}. Some varieties allow most of these codas, whereas others, such as [[Standard Chinese]], are limited to only {{IPA|/n/}}, {{IPA|/ŋ/}} and {{IPA|/ɻ /}}.

The number of sounds in the different spoken dialects varies, but in general there has been a tendency to a reduction in sounds from [[Middle Chinese]]. The Mandarin dialects in particular have experienced a dramatic decrease in sounds and so have far more multisyllabic words than most other spoken varieties. The total number of syllables in some varieties is therefore only about a thousand, including tonal variation, which is only about an eighth as many as English.{{efn|name=DeFrancis p42|{{harvtxt|DeFrancis|1984}} p.42 counts Chinese as having 1,277 tonal syllables, and about 398 to 418 if tones are disregarded; he cites Jespersen, Otto (1928) ''Monosyllabism in English''; London, p.15 for a count of over 8000 syllables for English.}}

=== Tones ===
All varieties of spoken Chinese use [[tone (linguistics)|tones]] to distinguish words.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=52}} A few dialects of north China may have as few as three tones, while some dialects in south China have up to 6 or 12 tones, depending on how one counts. One exception from this is [[Shanghainese dialect|Shanghainese]] which has reduced the set of tones to a two-toned [[pitch accent]] system much like modern Japanese.

A very common example used to illustrate the use of tones in Chinese is the application of the four tones of [[Standard Chinese]] (along with the neutral tone) to the syllable ''ma''. The tones are exemplified by the following five Chinese words:

== Grammar ==
{{Main|Chinese grammar}}
{{See also|Chinese classifiers}}
Chinese is often described as a "monosyllabic" language. However, this is only partially correct. It is largely accurate when describing [[Classical Chinese]] and [[Middle Chinese]]; in Classical Chinese, for example, perhaps 90% of words correspond to a single syllable and a single character. In the modern varieties, it is usually the case that a [[morpheme]] (unit of meaning) is a single syllable; In contrast, English has plenty of multi-syllable morphemes, both bound and free, such as "seven", "elephant", "para-" and "-able".

Some of the conservative southern varieties of modern Chinese have largely monosyllabic words, especially among the more basic vocabulary. In modern Mandarin, however, most [[noun]]s, [[adjective]]s and [[verb]]s are largely disyllabic. A significant cause of this is [[Phonetic erosion|phonological attrition]]. [[Sound change]] over time has steadily reduced the number of possible syllables. In modern Mandarin, there are now only about 1,200 possible syllables, including tonal distinctions, compared with about 5,000 in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] (still largely monosyllabic) and over 8,000 in English.{{efn|name=DeFrancis p42}}

This phonological collapse has led to a corresponding increase in the number of [[homophone]]s. As an example, the small Langenscheidt Pocket Chinese Dictionary&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Langenscheidt Pocket Chinese Dictionary |editor-first= Peter |editor-last= Terrell |publisher= Langenscheidt KG |location= Berlin and Munich |year= 2005 |isbn= 978-1-58573-057-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; lists six words that are commonly pronounced as ''shí'' (tone 2): {{Lang|zh|十}} "ten"; {{zh|s=实|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=實|labels=no}} "real, actual"; {{zh|s=识|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=識|labels=no}} "know (a person), recognize"; {{Lang|zh|石}} "stone"; {{zh|s=时|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=時|labels=no}} "time"; {{Lang|zh|食}} "food, eat". These were all pronounced differently in [[Early Middle Chinese]]; in [[Baxter's transcription for Middle Chinese|William H. Baxter's transcription]] they were ''dzyip'', ''zyit'', ''syik'', ''dzyek'', ''dzyi'' and ''zyik'' respectively. They are still pronounced differently in today's [[Cantonese]]; in [[Jyutping]] they are ''sap9'', ''sat9'', ''sik7'', ''sek9'', ''si4'', ''sik9''. In modern spoken Mandarin, however, tremendous ambiguity would result if all of these words could be used as-is; [[Yuen Ren Chao]]'s modern poem [[Lion-Eating Poet in the Stone Den]] exploits this, consisting of 92 characters all pronounced ''shi''. As such, most of these words have been replaced (in speech, if not in writing) with a longer, less-ambiguous compound. Only the first one, {{Lang|zh|十}} "ten", normally appears as such when spoken; the rest are normally replaced with, respectively, ''shíjì'' {{zh|s=实际|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=實際|labels=no}} (lit. "actual-connection"); ''rènshi'' {{zh|s=认识|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=認識|labels=no}} (lit. "recognize-know"); ''shítou'' {{zh|s=石头|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=石頭|labels=no}} (lit. "stone-head"); ''shíjiān'' {{zh|s=时间|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=時間|labels=no}} (lit. "time-interval"); ''shíwù'' {{Lang|zh|食物}} (lit. "food-thing"). In each case, the homophone was disambiguated by adding another morpheme, typically either a synonym or a generic word of some sort (for example, "head", "thing"), the purpose of which is simply to indicate which of the possible meanings of the other, homophonic syllable should be selected.

However, when one of the above words forms part of a compound, the disambiguating syllable is generally dropped and the resulting word is still disyllabic. For example, ''shí'' {{Lang|zh|石}} alone, not ''shítou'' {{zh|s=石头|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=石頭|labels=no}}, appears in compounds meaning "stone-", for example, ''shígāo'' {{Lang|zh|石膏}} "plaster" (lit. "stone cream"), ''shíhuī'' {{Lang|zh|石灰}} "lime" (lit. "stone dust"), ''shíkū'' {{Lang|zh|石窟}} "grotto" (lit. "stone cave"), ''shíyīng'' {{Lang|zh|石英}} "quartz" (lit. "stone flower"), ''shíyóu'' {{Lang|zh|石油}} "petroleum" (lit. "stone oil").

Most modern varieties of Chinese have the tendency to form new words through disyllabic, trisyllabic and tetra-character [[compound word|compounds]]. In some cases, monosyllabic words have become disyllabic without compounding, as in ''kūlong'' {{Lang|zh|窟窿}} from ''kǒng'' 孔; this is especially common in [[Jin Chinese|Jin]].

Chinese [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] is strictly bound to a set number of [[syllable]]s with a fairly rigid construction. Although many of these single-syllable morphemes (''zì'', {{Lang|zh|字}}) can stand alone as individual [[word (linguistics)|words]], they more often than not form multi-syllabic [[Compound (linguistics)|compounds]], known as ''cí'' ({{zh|s=词|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=詞|labels=no}}), which more closely resembles the traditional Western notion of a word. A Chinese ''cí'' ("word") can consist of more than one character-morpheme, usually two, but there can be three or more.

For example:
* ''yún'' {{zh|s=云|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=雲|labels=no}} – "cloud"
* ''hànbǎobāo'', ''hànbǎo'' {{zh|s=汉堡包|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=漢堡包|labels=no}}, {{zh|s=汉堡|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=漢堡|labels=no}} – "hamburger"
* ''wǒ'' {{Lang|zh|我}} – "I, me"
* ''rén'' {{Lang|zh|人}} – "people, human, mankind"
* ''dìqiú'' {{Lang|zh|地球}} – "The Earth"
* ''shǎndiàn'' {{zh|s=闪电|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=閃電|labels=no}} – "lightning"
* ''mèng'' {{zh|s=梦|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=夢|labels=no}} – "dream"

All varieties of modern Chinese are [[analytic language]]s, in that they depend on [[syntax]] (word order and sentence structure) rather than [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]—i.e., changes in form of a word—to indicate the word's function in a sentence.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=10}} In other words, Chinese has very few [[grammatical inflection]]s—it possesses no [[Grammatical tense|tenses]], no [[grammatical voice|voices]], no [[number]]s (singular, plural; though there are plural markers, for example for personal pronouns), and only a few [[Article (grammar)|articles]] (i.e., equivalents to "the, a, an" in English).{{efn|A distinction is made between {{Lang|zh|他}} as "he" and {{Lang|zh|她}} as "she" in writing, but this is a 20th-century introduction, and both characters are pronounced in exactly the same way.}}

They make heavy use of [[grammatical particle]]s to indicate [[grammatical aspect|aspect]] and [[grammatical mood|mood]]. In Mandarin Chinese, this involves the use of particles like ''le'' {{Lang|zh|了}} (perfective), ''hái'' {{zh|s=还|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=還|labels=no}} ("still"), ''yǐjīng'' {{zh|s=已经|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=已經|labels=no}} ("already"), and so on.

Chinese has a [[subject–verb–object]] [[word order]], and like many other [[languages of East Asia]], makes frequent use of the [[topic–comment]] construction to form sentences. Chinese also has an extensive system of [[classifier (linguistics)|classifiers]] and [[measure word]]s, another trait shared with neighboring languages like [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Korean language|Korean]]. Other notable grammatical features common to all the spoken varieties of Chinese include the use of [[serial verb construction]], [[pro-drop language|pronoun dropping]] and the related [[null subject language|subject dropping]].

Although the grammars of the spoken varieties share many traits, they do possess differences.

== Vocabulary ==
The entire Chinese character corpus since antiquity comprises well over 20,000 characters, of which only roughly 10,000 are now commonly in use. However Chinese characters should not be confused with Chinese words. Because most Chinese words are made up of two or more characters, there are many more Chinese words than characters. A more accurate equivalent for a Chinese character is the [[morpheme]], as characters represent the smallest grammatical units with individual meanings in the Chinese language.

Estimates of the total number of Chinese words and lexicalized phrases vary greatly. The ''[[Hanyu Da Zidian]]'', a compendium of Chinese characters, includes 54,678 head entries for characters, including [[bone oracle]] versions. The ''[[Zhonghua Zihai]]'' (1994) contains 85,568 head entries for character definitions, and is the largest reference work based purely on character and its literary variants. The [[CC-CEDICT]] project (2010) contains 97,404 contemporary entries including idioms, technology terms and names of political figures, businesses and products. The 2009 version of the Webster's Digital Chinese Dictionary (WDCD),&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Timothy Uy and Jim Hsia, Editors, ''Webster's Digital Chinese Dictionary – Advanced Reference Edition, July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; based on [[CC-CEDICT]], contains over 84,000 entries.

The most comprehensive pure linguistic Chinese-language dictionary, the 12-volume ''[[Hanyu Da Cidian]]'', records more than 23,000 head Chinese characters and gives over 370,000 definitions. The 1999 revised ''[[Cihai]]'', a multi-volume encyclopedic dictionary reference work, gives 122,836 vocabulary entry definitions under 19,485 Chinese characters, including proper names, phrases and common zoological, geographical, sociological, scientific and technical terms.

The 7th (2016) edition of ''[[Xiandai Hanyu Cidian]]'', an authoritative one-volume dictionary on modern standard Chinese language as used in [[mainland China]], has 13,000 head characters and defines 70,000 words.

=== Loanwords ===
Like any other language, Chinese has absorbed a sizable number of [[loanwords]] from other cultures. Most Chinese words are formed out of native Chinese [[morphemes]], including words describing imported objects and ideas. However, direct phonetic borrowing of foreign words has gone on since ancient times.

Some early [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] loanwords in Chinese have been proposed, notably {{linktext|蜜|lang=zh}} ''mì'' "honey", {{linktext|狮|lang=zh-Hans}}/{{linktext|獅|lang=zh-Hant}} ''shī'' "lion," and perhaps also {{linktext|马|lang=zh-Hans}}/{{linktext|馬|lang=zh-Hant}} ''mǎ'' "horse", {{linktext|猪|lang=zh-Hans}}/{{linktext|豬|lang=zh-Hant}} ''zhū'' "pig", {{Lang|zh|犬}} ''quǎn'' "dog", and {{linktext|鹅|lang=zh-Hans}}/{{linktext|鵝|lang=zh-Hant}} ''é'' "goose".{{efn|[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] s.v. "[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-75039/Chinese-languages Chinese languages]": "Old Chinese vocabulary already contained many words not generally occurring in the other Sino-Tibetan languages. The words for 'honey' and 'lion', and probably also 'horse', 'dog', and 'goose', are connected with Indo-European and were acquired through trade and early contacts. (The nearest known Indo-European languages were Tocharian and Sogdian, a middle Iranian language.) A number of words have Austroasiatic cognates and point to early contacts with the ancestral language of Muong–Vietnamese and Mon–Khmer."; Jan Ulenbrook, ''Einige Übereinstimmungen zwischen dem Chinesischen und dem Indogermanischen'' (1967) proposes 57 items; see also Tsung-tung Chang, 1988 [http://sino-platonic.org/complete/spp007_old_chinese.pdf Indo-European Vocabulary in Old Chinese].}}
Ancient words borrowed from along the [[Silk Road]] since [[Old Chinese]] include {{Lang|zh|葡萄}} ''pútáo'' "[[grape]]", {{Lang|zh|石榴}} ''shíliu''/''shíliú'' "[[pomegranate]]" and {{zh|s=狮子|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=獅子|labels=no}} ''shīzi'' "[[lion]]". Some words were borrowed from Buddhist scriptures, including {{Lang|zh|佛}} ''Fó'' "Buddha" and {{zh|s=菩萨|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=菩薩|labels=no}} ''Púsà'' "bodhisattva." Other words came from nomadic peoples to the north, such as {{Lang|zh|胡同}} ''hútòng'' "[[hutong]]". Words borrowed from the peoples along the Silk Road, such as {{Lang|zh|葡萄}} "grape," generally have [[Persia]]n etymologies. Buddhist terminology is generally derived from [[Sanskrit]] or [[Pāli]], the [[liturgical language]]s of [[North India]]. Words borrowed from the nomadic tribes of the [[Gobi]], Mongolian or northeast regions generally have [[Altaic]] etymologies, such as {{Lang|zh|琵琶}} ''pípá'', the Chinese lute, or {{Lang|zh|酪}} ''lào''/''luò'' "cheese" or "yoghurt", but from exactly which source is not always clear.{{sfnp|Kane|2006|p=161}}

=== Modern borrowings ===
{{See also|Translation of neologisms into Chinese|Transcription into Chinese characters}}
Modern neologisms are primarily translated into Chinese in one of three ways: free translation (''[[calque]]'', or by meaning), phonetic translation (by sound), or [[phono-semantic matching|a combination of the two]]. Today, it is much more common to use existing Chinese morphemes to coin new words in order to represent imported concepts, such as technical expressions and [[international scientific vocabulary]]. Any [[Latin]] or [[Greek language|Greek]] etymologies are dropped and converted into the corresponding Chinese characters (for example, ''anti-'' typically becomes "{{Lang|zh|反}}", literally ''opposite''), making them more comprehensible for Chinese but introducing more difficulties in understanding foreign texts. For example, the word ''telephone'' was loaned phonetically as {{zh|s=德律风|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=德律風|labels=no}} (Shanghainese: ''télífon'' {{IPA|[təlɪfoŋ]}}, Mandarin: ''délǜfēng'') during the 1920s and widely used in Shanghai, but later {{zh|s=电话|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=電話|labels=no}} ''diànhuà'' (lit. "electric speech"), built out of native Chinese morphemes, became prevalent ({{Lang|zh|電話}} is in fact from the Japanese {{lang|ja|電話}} ''denwa''; see below for more Japanese loans). Other examples include {{zh|s=电视|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=電視|labels=no}} ''diànshì'' (lit. "electric vision") for television, {{zh|s=电脑|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=電腦|labels=no}} ''diànnǎo'' (lit. "electric brain") for computer; {{zh|s=手机|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=手機|labels=no}} ''shǒujī'' (lit. "hand machine") for mobile phone, {{zh|s=蓝牙|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=藍牙|labels=no}} ''lányá'' (lit. "blue tooth") for [[Bluetooth]], and {{zh|s=网志|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=網誌|labels=no}} ''wǎngzhì'' (lit. "internet logbook") for blog in Hong Kong and Macau Cantonese. Occasionally half-transliteration, half-translation compromises are accepted, such as {{zh|s=汉堡包|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=漢堡包|labels=no}} ''hànbǎobāo'' ({{Lang|zh|漢堡}} ''hànbǎo'' "Hamburg" + {{Lang|zh|包}} ''bāo'' "bun") for "hamburger". Sometimes translations are designed so that they sound like the original while incorporating Chinese morphemes ([[phono-semantic matching]]), such as {{zh|s=拖拉机|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=拖拉機|labels=no}} ''tuōlājī'' "tractor" (lit. "dragging-pulling machine"), or {{zh|s=马利奥|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=馬利奧|labels=no}} Mǎlì'ào for the video game character [[Mario]]. This is often done for commercial purposes, for example {{zh|s=奔腾|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=奔騰|labels=no}} ''bēnténg'' (lit. "dashing-leaping") for [[Pentium (brand)|Pentium]] and {{zh|s=赛百味|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=賽百味|labels=no}} ''Sàibǎiwèi'' (lit. "better-than hundred tastes") for [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway restaurants]].

Foreign words, mainly [[proper nouns]], continue to enter the Chinese language by transcription according to their pronunciations. This is done by employing Chinese characters with similar pronunciations. For example, "Israel" becomes {{Lang|zh|以色列}} ''Yǐsèliè'', "Paris" becomes {{Lang|zh|巴黎}} ''Bālí''. A rather small number of direct transliterations have survived as common words, including {{zh|s=沙发|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=沙發|labels=no}} ''shāfā'' "sofa", {{zh|s=马达|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=馬達|labels=no}} ''mǎdá'' "motor", {{Lang|zh|幽默}} ''yōumò'' "humor", {{zh|s=逻辑|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=邏輯|labels=no}} ''luóji''/''luójí'' "logic", {{zh|s=时髦|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=時髦|labels=no}} ''shímáo'' "smart, fashionable", and {{Lang|zh|歇斯底里}} ''xiēsīdǐlǐ'' "hysterics". The bulk of these words were originally coined in the Shanghai dialect during the early 20th century and were later loaned into Mandarin, hence their pronunciations in Mandarin may be quite off from the English. For example, {{zh|s=沙发|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=沙發|labels=no}} "sofa" and {{zh|s=马达|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=馬達|labels=no}} "motor" in Shanghainese sound more like their English counterparts. Cantonese differs from Mandarin with some transliterations, such as {{Lang|zh|梳化}} ''so&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; faa&lt;sup&gt;3*2&lt;/sup&gt;'' "sofa" and {{Lang|zh|摩打}} ''mo&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; daa&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' "motor".

Western foreign words representing Western concepts have influenced Chinese since the 20th century through transcription. From [[French language|French]] came {{Lang|zh|芭蕾}} ''bāléi'' "ballet" and {{Lang|zh|香槟}} ''xiāngbīn'', "champagne"; from [[Italian language|Italian]], {{Lang|zh|咖啡}} ''kāfēi'' "caffè". English influence is particularly pronounced. From early 20th century Shanghainese, many English words are borrowed, such as {{zh|s=高尔夫|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=高爾夫|labels=no}} ''gāoěrfū'' "golf" and the above-mentioned {{zh|s=沙发|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=沙發|labels=no}} ''shāfā'' "sofa". Later, the United States [[soft power|soft influences]] gave rise to {{Lang|zh|迪斯科}} ''dísikē''/''dísīkē'' "disco", {{zh|s=可乐|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=可樂|labels=no}} ''kělè'' "cola", and {{Lang|zh|迷你}} ''mínǐ'' "mini [skirt]". Contemporary colloquial Cantonese has distinct loanwords from English, such as {{Lang|zh|卡通}} ''kaa&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; tung&lt;small&gt;1&lt;/small&gt;'' "cartoon", {{Lang|zh|基佬}} ''gei&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; lou&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' "gay people", {{Lang|zh|的士}} ''dik&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; si&lt;sup&gt;6*2&lt;/sup&gt;'' "taxi", and {{Lang|zh|巴士}} ''baa&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; si&lt;sup&gt;6*2&lt;/sup&gt;'' "bus". With the rising popularity of the Internet, there is a current vogue in China for coining English transliterations, for example, {{zh|s=粉丝|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=粉絲|labels=no}} ''fěnsī'' "fans", {{Lang|zh|黑客}} ''hēikè'' "hacker" (lit. "black guest"), and {{Lang|zh|博客}} ''bókè'' "blog". In Taiwan, some of these transliterations are different, such as {{Lang|zh|駭客}} ''hàikè'' for "hacker" and {{Lang|zh|部落格}} ''bùluògé'' for "blog" (lit. "interconnected tribes").

Another result of the English influence on Chinese is the appearance in Modern Chinese texts of so-called {{zh|s=字母词|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=字母詞|labels=no}} ''zìmǔcí'' (lit. "lettered words") spelled with letters from the English alphabet. This has appeared in magazines, newspapers, on web sites, and on TV: {{zh|s=三G手机|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=三G手機|labels=no}} "3rd generation cell phones" ({{Lang|zh|三}} ''sān'' "three" + G "generation" + {{zh|s=手机|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=手機|labels=no}} ''shǒujī'' "mobile phones"), {{Lang|zh|IT界}} "IT circles" (IT "information technology" + {{Lang|zh|界}} ''jiè'' "industry"), HSK (''Hànyǔ Shuǐpíng Kǎoshì'', {{zh|s=汉语水平考试|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=漢語水平考試|labels=no}}), GB (''Guóbiāo'', {{zh|s=国标|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=國標|labels=no}}), {{zh|s=CIF价|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=CIF價|labels=no}} (CIF "Cost, Insurance, Freight" + {{zh|s=价|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=價|labels=no}} ''jià'' "price"), {{Lang|zh|e家庭}} "e-home" (e "electronic" + {{Lang|zh|家庭}} ''jiātíng'' "home"), {{zh|s=W时代|labels=off}}/{{zh|t=W時代|labels=off}} "wireless era" (W "wireless" + {{zh|s=时代|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=時代|labels=no}} ''shídài'' "era"), {{Lang|zh|TV族}} "TV watchers" (TV "television" + {{Lang|zh|族}} ''zú'' "social group; clan"), {{zh|s=后РС时代|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=後PC時代|labels=no}} "post-PC era" ({{zh|s=后|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=後|labels=no}} ''hòu'' "after/post-" + PC "personal computer" + {{zh|s=时代|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=時代|labels=no}}), and so on.

Since the 20th century, another source of words has been [[Japanese language|Japanese]] using existing [[kanji]] (Chinese characters used in Japanese). Japanese re-molded European concepts and inventions into {{nihongo|''[[wasei-kango]]''|和製漢語||lit. "Japanese-made Chinese"}}, and many of these words have been re-loaned into modern Chinese. Other terms were coined by the Japanese by giving new senses to existing Chinese terms or by referring to expressions used in classical Chinese literature. For example, ''jīngjì'' ({{zh|s=经济|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=經濟|labels=no}}; {{lang|ja|経済}} ''keizai'' in Japanese), which in the original Chinese meant "the workings of the state", was narrowed to "economy" in Japanese; this narrowed definition was then re-imported into Chinese. As a result, these terms are virtually indistinguishable from native Chinese words: indeed, there is some dispute over some of these terms as to whether the Japanese or Chinese coined them first. As a result of this loaning, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, and Vietnamese share a corpus of linguistic terms describing modern terminology, paralleling the similar corpus of terms built from Greco-Latin and shared among European languages.

== Writing system ==
{{Main|Written Chinese|Mainland Chinese Braille|Taiwanese Braille}}
&lt;!--This is a SUMMARY.--&gt;

The Chinese [[orthography]] centers on [[Chinese characters]], which are written within imaginary square blocks, traditionally arranged in vertical columns, read from top to bottom down a column, and right to left across columns. Chinese characters denote [[morpheme]]s independent of phonetic change. Thus the character {{Lang|zh|[[wikt:一|一]]}} ("one") is uttered ''yī'' in [[Standard Chinese]], ''yat&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;'' in [[Cantonese]] and ''it'' in [[Hokkien dialect|Hokkien]] (form of Min). Vocabularies from different major Chinese variants have diverged, and colloquial nonstandard written Chinese often makes use of unique "dialectal characters", such as {{Lang|zh|冇}} and {{Lang|zh|係}} for Cantonese and [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], which are considered archaic or unused in standard written Chinese.

Written colloquial Cantonese has become quite popular in online [[chat room]]s and [[instant messaging]] amongst Hong-Kongers and Cantonese-speakers elsewhere. It is considered highly informal, and does not extend to many formal occasions.

The Chinese had no uniform phonetic transcription system until the mid-20th century, although enunciation patterns were recorded in early [[rime book]]s and dictionaries. Early [[India]]n translators, working in [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]], were the first to attempt to describe the sounds and enunciation patterns of Chinese in a foreign language. After the 15th century, the efforts of Jesuits and Western court missionaries resulted in some rudimentary Latin transcription systems, based on the [[Nanjing Mandarin]] dialect.

In [[Hunan]], women in certain areas write their local language in [[Nü Shu]], a [[syllabary]] derived from [[Chinese characters]]. The [[Dungan language]], considered by many a dialect of Mandarin, is nowadays written in [[Cyrillic]], and was previously written in the [[Arabic script]]. The [[Dungan people]] are primarily Muslim and live mainly in [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], and [[Russia]]; some of the related [[Hui people]] also speak the language and live mainly in China.

&lt;!--This is a SUMMARY. Please add new information to [[Chinese characters]].--&gt;

[[File:XingshuLantingxv.jpg|thumb|right|"[[Lantingji Xu|Preface to the Poems Composed at the Orchid Pavilion]]" by [[Wang Xizhi]], written in [[Semi-cursive script|semi-cursive style]]]]
Each Chinese character represents a monosyllabic Chinese word or morpheme. In 100 CE, the famed [[Han dynasty]] scholar [[Xu Shen]] [[Chinese character classification|classified characters]] into six categories, namely [[pictograph]]s, simple [[ideograph]]s, compound ideographs, phonetic loans, phonetic compounds and derivative characters. Of these, only 4% were categorized as pictographs, including many of the simplest characters, such as ''rén'' {{lang|zh|人}} (human), ''rì'' {{lang|zh|日}} (sun), ''shān'' {{lang|zh|山}} (mountain; hill), ''shuǐ'' {{lang|zh|水}} (water). Between 80% and 90% were classified as phonetic compounds such as ''chōng'' {{lang|zh|沖}} (pour), combining a phonetic component ''zhōng'' {{lang|zh|中}} (middle) with a semantic [[Radical (Chinese character)|radical]] {{lang|zh|氵}} (water). Almost all characters created since have been made using this format. The 18th-century [[Kangxi Dictionary]] recognized 214 radicals.

Modern characters are styled after the [[kaishu|regular script]]. Various other written styles are also used in [[Chinese calligraphy]], including [[seal script]], [[cursive script (East Asia)|cursive script]] and [[clerical script]]. Calligraphy artists can write in traditional and simplified characters, but they tend to use traditional characters for traditional art.

There are currently two systems for Chinese characters. The [[Traditional Chinese character|traditional system]], used in [[Hong Kong]], [[Taiwan]], [[Macau]] and Chinese speaking communities (except [[Singapore]] and [[Malaysia]]) outside [[mainland China]], takes its form from standardized character forms dating back to the late Han dynasty. The [[Simplified Chinese character]] system, introduced by the People's Republic of China in 1954 to promote mass [[literacy]], simplifies most complex traditional [[glyph]]s to fewer strokes, many to common cursive [[shorthand]] variants.

[[Singapore]], which has a large Chinese community, was the second nation to officially adopt simplified characters, although it has also become the ''de facto'' standard for younger ethnic Chinese in [[Malaysia]]. The [[Internet]] provides the platform to practice reading these alternative systems, be it traditional or simplified.

A well-educated Chinese reader today recognizes approximately 4,000 to 6,000 characters; approximately 3,000 characters are required to read a [[Newspapers of the People's Republic of China|Mainland newspaper]]. The PRC government defines literacy amongst workers as a knowledge of 2,000 characters, though this would be only functional literacy. School-children typically learn around 2,000 characters whereas scholars may memorize up to 10,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zimmermann|first=Basile|year=2010|title=Redesigning Culture: Chinese Characters in Alphabet-Encoded Networks|journal=Design and Culture|volume=2|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large unabridged [[dictionary]], like the Kangxi Dictionary, contains over 40,000 characters, including obscure, variant, rare, and archaic characters; fewer than a quarter of these characters are now commonly used.

=== Romanization ===
[[File:Gwoyu.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.45|"National language" ({{lang|zh-Hant|國語}}/{{lang|zh-Hans|国语}}; ''Guóyǔ'') written in Traditional and Simplified Chinese characters, followed by various romanizations.]]

{{see also|Chinese language romanization in Singapore|Romanization of Chinese}}

[[Romanization]] is the process of transcribing a language into the [[Latin script]]. There are many systems of romanization for the Chinese varieties, due to the lack of a native phonetic transcription until modern times. Chinese is first known to have been written in Latin characters by Western [[Christianity in China|Christian missionaries]] in the 16th century.

Today the most common romanization standard for Standard Chinese is ''[[Hanyu Pinyin]]'', often known simply as pinyin, introduced in 1956 by the [[People's Republic of China]], and later adopted by [[Singapore]] and [[Taiwan]]. Pinyin is almost universally employed now for teaching standard spoken Chinese in schools and universities across [[Americas|America]], [[Australia]] and [[Europe]]. Chinese parents also use Pinyin to teach their children the sounds and tones of new words. In school books that teach Chinese, the Pinyin romanization is often shown below a picture of the thing the word represents, with the Chinese character alongside.

The second-most common romanization system, the [[Wade–Giles]], was invented by Thomas Wade in 1859 and modified by Herbert Giles in 1892. As this system approximates the phonology of Mandarin Chinese into English consonants and vowels, i.e. it is an [[Anglicization]], it may be particularly helpful for beginner Chinese speakers of an English-speaking background. Wade–Giles was found in academic use in the [[United States]], particularly before the 1980s, and until recently{{when|date=February 2011}} was widely used in Taiwan.

When used within European texts, the [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]] transcriptions in both pinyin and Wade–Giles are often left out for simplicity; Wade–Giles' extensive use of apostrophes is also usually omitted. Thus, most Western readers will be much more familiar with ''Beijing'' than they will be with ''Běijīng'' (pinyin), and with ''Taipei'' than ''T'ai²-pei³'' (Wade–Giles). This simplification presents syllables as homophones which really are none, and therefore exaggerates the number of homophones almost by a factor of four.

Here are a few examples of ''Hanyu Pinyin'' and Wade–Giles, for comparison:&lt;!-- Please feel free to add Yale, Postal or whatever other examples you know, but I don't know those systems. [[User:Jiawen|Jiawen]] 07:27, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC) --&gt;

Other systems of romanization for Chinese include [[Gwoyeu Romatzyh]], the French [[EFEO Chinese transcription|EFEO]], the [[Yale romanization of Mandarin|Yale]] (invented during WWII for U.S. troops), as well as separate systems for [[Cantonese]], [[Min Nan]], [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], and other Chinese varieties.

=== Other phonetic transcriptions ===
Chinese varieties have been phonetically transcribed into many other writing systems over the centuries. The [['Phags-pa script]], for example, has been very helpful in reconstructing the pronunciations of premodern forms of Chinese.

[[Zhuyin]] (colloquially ''bopomofo''), a [[semi-syllabary]] is still widely used in Taiwan's [[elementary school]]s to aid standard pronunciation. Although zhuyin characters are reminiscent of [[katakana]] script, there is no source to substantiate the claim that Katakana was the basis for the zhuyin system. A comparison table of zhuyin to pinyin exists in the [[Bopomofo#Comparison|zhuyin article]]. Syllables based on pinyin and zhuyin can also be compared by looking at the following articles:
* [[Pinyin table]]
* [[Zhuyin table]]

There are also at least two systems of [[cyrillization]] for Chinese. The most widespread is the [[Cyrillization of Chinese from Pinyin|Palladius system]].

{{See also|Chinese as a foreign language}}
With the growing importance and influence of China's economy globally, [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] instruction is gaining popularity in schools in the United States, and has become an increasingly popular subject of study amongst the young in the Western world, as in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4617646.stm | work=BBC News | title=How hard is it to learn Chinese? | date=January 17, 2006 | accessdate=April 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991 there were 2,000 foreign learners taking China's official [[Chinese Proficiency Test]] (also known as HSK, comparable to the English [[University of Cambridge ESOL examination|Cambridge Certificate]]), while in 2005, the number of candidates had risen sharply to 117,660.&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}} "汉语水平考试中心：2005年外国考生总人数近12万",&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.gov.cn/jrzg/2006-01/16/content_160707.htm Gov.cn]&lt;/sup&gt; [[Xinhua News Agency]], January 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2010, 750,000 people had taken the Chinese Proficiency Test. By 2017, 6.5 million candidates had taken the [[Chinese Proficiency Test]] of various kinds.

According to the Modern Language Association, there were 550 elementary, junior high and senior high schools providing Chinese programs in the United States in 2015, which represented a 100% increase in two years. At the same time, enrollment in Chinese language classes at college level had an increase of 51% from 2002 to 2015. On the other hand, the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages also had figures suggesting that 30,000 – 50,000 students were studying Chinese in 2015.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://america.cgtn.com/2015/03/03/chinese-as-a-second-language-growing-in-popularity|title=Chinese as a second language growing in popularity|date=2015-03-03|website=CGTN America|access-date=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, more than half a million Chinese students pursued post-secondary education overseas, whereas 400,000 international students came to China for higher education. Tsinghua University hosted 35,000 students from 116 countries in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://america.cgtn.com/2017/03/17/china-is-third-most-popular-destination-for-international-students|title=China is third most popular destination for international students|date=2017-03-18|website=CGTN America|access-date=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the increase in demand for Chinese as a second language, there are 330 institutions teaching Chinese language globally according to the Chinese Ministry of Education. The establishment of Confucius Institutes, which are the public institutions affiliated with the Ministry of Education of China, aims at promoting Chinese language and culture as well as supporting Chinese teaching overseas. There were more than 480 Confucius Institutes worldwide as of 2014.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Enina Apostle''' or '''Enina Apostolos''' (scholarly abbreviation '''Enin''') is an 11th-century [[Old Church Slavonic]] [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] manuscript. Discovered in a poor condition in 1960 during restoration work in the central Bulgarian village of [[Enina]], the partially preserved [[parchment]] manuscript is housed in the [[SS. Cyril and Methodius National Library]] in [[Sofia]]. It is the oldest Cyrillic manuscript currently held by any Bulgarian collection.

==History==
The Enina Apostle was discovered in 1960 during the restoration of the old [[Church of Saint Paraskeva, Enina|Church of Saint Paraskeva]] in the village of [[Enina]].&lt;ref name="angelova"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libsu.uni-sofia.bg/slavica/eninaspec.html|title=Енински апостол|last=Ангелова|first=Анна|date=2002–2004|work=Bibliotheca Slavica|publisher=Университетска библиотека “Св. Климент Охридски”|language=Bulgarian|accessdate=15 May 2011|location=София|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040913030635/http://libsu.uni-sofia.bg/slavica/eninaspec.html|archivedate=13 September 2004|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The village lies in south central Bulgaria, north of [[Kazanlak|Kazanlăk]], and is administratively part of [[Stara Zagora Province]]. The manuscript was initially in a very poor condition, with only 39 leaves and parts of leaves extant, and hardly a single leaf preserved in its entirety.&lt;ref name="angelova"/&gt;

From its discovery to 1964 the Enina Apostle was housed in the Kazanlăk Museum. In 1964, the manuscript was transferred to the [[SS. Cyril and Methodius National Library]] in the capital [[Sofia]], where it has been housed ever since as MS №1144.&lt;ref name="angelova"/&gt; The Enina Apostle is part of the library′s collection of 1,500 Slavic manuscripts.&lt;ref name="digitallibrary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationallibrary.bg/cgi-bin/e-cms/vis/vis.pl?s=001&amp;p=0120&amp;n=&amp;vis=|title=Славяноезични и чуждоезични ръкописи|year=2009|publisher=Национална библиотека на Република България|language=Bulgarian|accessdate=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among these, it is of utmost importance because of its antiquity, as well as its [[Palaeography|palaeographic]] and [[linguistics|linguistic]] features.&lt;ref name="nedeljkovic"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nedeljković |first=Olga|title=K.

==Description==
The Enina Apostle is a short [[Apostolos (Orthodox liturgy)|Apostolos]] [[lectionary]], written on [[parchment]] in the second half of the 11th century,&lt;ref name="Dogramadžieva"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dogramadžieva |first=Ekaterina  |title=Кирило-Методиевска Енциклопедия |volume=1 |location=София |publisher=Издателство на БАН |date=1985 |pages=652–655 |chapter=Енински Апостол }}&lt;/ref&gt; which makes it the oldest Cyrillic manuscript currently part of a Bulgarian collection.&lt;ref name="dobreva"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dobreva|first=Milena|year=2005|title=Mediaeval Slavonic Written Cultural Heritage in the E-World: The Bulgarian Experience|journal=Review of the National Center for Digitization|pages=35–36|issn=1820-0109|url=http://elib.mi.sanu.ac.rs/files/journals/ncd/2/d005download.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815143127/http://elib.mi.sanu.ac.rs/files/journals/ncd/2/d005download.pdf|archivedate=15 August 2011|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leaves are {{convert|19.5|x|15.5|cm|in}} in size, and the written area {{convert|13.5|x|10.5|cm|in}}. It was written by a single scribe in a sloping [[uncial]] using dark brown ink. Ff.6r and 38r feature decorative headpieces of geometric and floral design. Additional decoration includes 18 [[initial]]s, which are mostly geometric, though sometimes floral or interlaced. An initial on f.3 depicts a bird′s head, while ff.28v and 36v both have a [[Glagolitic alphabet|Glagolitic]] letter Ⰱ as the initial letter of a reading.

The Enina Apostle is thought to have originally consisted of circa 215–220 leaves, of which only 39 have been at least partially preserved. Both the beginning and the end of the manuscript are missing, and there are no surviving [[marginal note]]s. The surviving text of the manuscript consists of readings from the Acts and Epistles for Saturdays and Sundays from the 35th Sunday after [[Pentecost]] until [[Great Saturday]] and for selected feasts from 1 September until 3 October, the feast day of [[Dionysius the Areopagite]].&lt;ref name="angelova"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nedeljkovic"/&gt; The language of the text is classified as either [[Old Church Slavonic]] or as belonging to a category that chronologically immediately follows Old Church Slavonic.&lt;ref name="barentsen"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barentsen|first1=A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5260">'''Functional Requirements for Subject Authority Data''' ('''FRSAD'''), previously known as '''Functional Requirements for Subject Authority Records''' ('''FRSAR'''), is a conceptual [[entity-relationship model]] developed by the [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]] (IFLA)&lt;ref&gt;[http://nkos.slis.kent.edu/FRSAR/index.html Functional Requirements for Subject Authority Data working group]&lt;/ref&gt; and published in 2010.  It is a continuation of the work done on the [[FRBR]] model, detailing how "entities that serve as subjects of intellectual or artistic endeavor"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifla.org/VII/s13/frbr/frbr1.htm#3.2 FRBR, 1998]&lt;/ref&gt; can be related and controlled within the bibliographic universe.  The model is intended to support global sharing and reuse of [[Subject (documents)|subject]] authority data. 

==The conceptual model==
[[Image:FRSAR1.jpg]]

===Work===
Work is a "distinct intellectual or artistic creation [http://www.ifla.org/VII/s13/frbr/frbr1.htm#3.2 (IFLA 1998)]. 

===Thema===

Is anything that can be the subject of a work. This is the abstract idea of the [[aboutness]] of a given work. Thema is independent of language and disciplines[http://www.springerlink.com/content/a426862726nh46pu/fulltext.pdf (FRSAR 2007)]. 

===Nomen===

Any alphanumeric, sound, visual, or any other symbol, sign or combination of symbols by which a thema is known, referred to or addressed [http://www.springerlink.com/content/a426862726nh46pu/fulltext.pdf (FRSAR 2007)]. A nomen can be any expression of a thema. Ideally there will exist an authority file with every possible subject/thema. This means that it should be possible to exchange subject authority data between systems. If a user looks up a specific subject in a catalog and wants to look in other places, he or she should not have to worry about translating the [[Information retrieval|query]], since the system would be able to recognize the underlying thema and automatically translate it into the relevant nomen. One way to understand this is to think about how a subject can be described in different ways. For example, if one looks at a work about the city Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, there are many ways to describe Stockholm. First, one must distinguish between the city Stockholm and the many other meanings of the word; for example, Stockholm is also the name of other cities, a record label, and a syndrome. When the thema is established in an authority file, it is possible to translate across systems. The nomen for Stockholm could be anything from "Stockholm", "Stockholm (City)", "Tukholma" - the Finnish spelling of Stockholm - or a range of Zip-codes, or the longitude and latitude, or a picture of the city, or a sound. FRSAR, if implemented, enables users to perform specific and precise subject searching across multiple systems.

==Relationships==

Works and themas have a [[many-to-many (data model)|many-to-many]] relationship, meaning that any work can have more than one subject, and any subject can be expressed in one or more works. The same is true for the relationship between thema and nomen. A thema can be expressed in many different ways and a nomen can express many different themas, all depending on the given system. Besides these relationships, the workgroup has so far identified several other thema-thema and nomen-nomen relationships. Two nomens can, for example, be said to have an equivalence relationship, if they both are appellations of the same thema.

==User tasks==

The workgroup conducted two user studies in 2006 and 2007, and based on the results of these studies, four subject authority data user tasks were defined [http://archive.ifla.org/VII/s29/pubs/wgfrsar-committee-report-quebec2008.pdf (2008 FRSAR News Report to IFLA)]:

'''Find''': to find an entity (thema or nomen) or set of entities corresponding to stated criteria 

'''Identify''': to identify an entity (thema or nomen) based on certain attributes / characteristics

'''Select''': to select an entity (thema or nomen)

'''Explore''': to explore any relationships between entities (thema or nomen), correlations to other subject vocabularies and structure of a subject domain

'''George Perkins Marsh''' (March 15, 1801 – July 23, 1882), an American [[diplomat]] and [[philology|philologist]], is considered by some to be America's first environmentalist and by recognizing the irreversible impact of man's actions on the earth, a precursor to the sustainability concept,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uh.edu/engines/epi595.htm No. 595: George Perkins Marsh&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; although "conservationist" would be more accurate. The [[Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historical Park]] in Vermont takes its name, in part, from Marsh. His 1864 book ''[[Man and Nature]]'' had a great impact in many parts of the world.

== Biography ==

George Perkins Marsh was born in [[Woodstock, Vermont]], to a prominent family. His father, Charles Marsh, had been a member of the U.S. House of Representatives.  George Marsh graduated from [[Phillips Academy]], [[Andover, Massachusetts]], in 1816 and from [[Dartmouth College]] with highest honors in 1820. He studied law in [[Burlington, Vermont]],&lt;ref name=ea&gt;{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Marsh, George Perkins}}&lt;/ref&gt; was admitted to the bar in 1825, and practiced law in Burlington. He also devoted himself to philological studies. In 1835 he was appointed to the [[Executive Council of Vermont]], and from 1843 to 1849 was a [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] [[United States Representative|representative]] in Congress.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} He served as an editor of ''[[Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley]]'' which was published in 1848.&lt;ref name=Squier&gt;{{cite book|last=Squier|first=E.G.|title=Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley|year=1848|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]|location=Washington, D.C.|page=48|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/4301/view/1/48/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1849 President [[Zachary Taylor]] appointed Marsh [[United States Ambassador to Turkey|United States minister resident]] in the [[Ottoman Empire]]. He rendered valuable service to the cause of civil and religious toleration in that empire. In 1852–1853, he discharged a mission to [[Greece]] in connection with the imprisonment of American missionary [[Jonas King]]. He accomplished this task with a vigor that surprised the diplomats of Athens and showed a masterly knowledge of the Greek constitution and legislation, as well as of international law.

Marsh was elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]] in 1851.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlistm American Antiquarian Society Members Directory]&lt;/ref&gt;

He returned to Vermont in 1854. In 1857 he was appointed by the governor of Vermont to make a report to the legislature in regard to the artificial propagation of fish. He had previously been appointed one of the commissioners to rebuild the state house at Montpelier and in 1857 was appointed as the state railroad commissioner, succeeding [[Charles Linsley]].

In 1861, President [[Abraham Lincoln]] appointed Marsh the first United States minister to the Kingdom of Italy. Marsh would go on to be the longest-serving [[chief of mission]] in U.S. history, serving as envoy for 21 years until his death at [[Vallombrosa]] in 1882.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ho/faq/#secretaries&lt;/ref&gt; He is buried at the [[Protestant Cemetery, Rome|Protestant Cemetery]] in Rome.

==Work==
Marsh was an able linguist, able to both speak and write fluently in Swedish and half a dozen other European languages. He was a remarkable philologist for his day, and a scholar of great breadth, knowing much of military science, engraving and physics, as well as [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], which was his specialty. He wrote many articles for Johnson's ''[[Universal Cyclopaedia]]'', and contributed many reviews and letters to ''[[The Nation]]''. 

He was an admirer of the [[Goths]], whose presence he traced in whatever is great and peculiar in the character of the founders of [[New England]]. He owned the finest collection of Scandinavian literature outside of Scandinavia. Part of it ultimately became the property of the [[University of Vermont]], through the liberality of [[Frederick Billings]]. During the winter of 1858/9 he began a course of thirty lectures on the English language at [[Columbia University]], and a year later he delivered a second course, on the grammatical history of [[English literature]], before the [[Lowell Institute]], in [[Boston]]. Marsh played a role in the creation of the first edition of the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] by acting as Coordinator of the American readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IqvNTSuoH1EC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=words+of+the+world+ogilvie&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjN77OXorjbAhWJJ3wKHRWPD8cQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=marsh&amp;f=false|title=Words of the World: A Global History of the Oxford English Dictionary|last=Ogilvie|first=Sarah|date=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9781107021839|location=|pages=55|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His book ''[[Man and Nature]]'' (1864) constituted an early work of ecology, and played a role in the creation of the [[Adirondack Park]].  Marsh argued that [[deforestation]] could lead to [[desertification]]. Referring to the clearing of once-lush lands surrounding the [[Mediterranean]], he asserted "the operation of causes set in action by man has brought the face of the earth to a desolation almost as complete as that of the moon." He argued that welfare is secured as long as man manages resources and keep them in good condition. Welfare of future generations should be one of [[resource management]] determinants. [[Resource scarcity]] is a result of misbalancing an environmental equilibrium. In other words: it comes from unreasonable human action rather than is determined by some absolute resource scarcity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/2053019615609953|title=Origins of Anthropocene awareness|journal=The Anthropocene Review|volume=3|pages=52|year=2015|last1=Lowenthal|first1=David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==

* ''Mediaeval and Modern Saints and Miracles'' (1876)

He prepared an American edition of [[Hensleigh Wedgwood]]'s ''Dictionary of English Etymology'' (New York, 1862), to which he made large additions and annotations. He translated [[Rasmus Christian Rask|Rask]]'s ''Icelandic Grammar''.&lt;ref name=ea/&gt;

==Family==
His second wife, Caroline (Crane) Marsh (1816–1901), whom he married in 1839, published ''Wolfe of the Knoll and other Poems'' (1860), and the ''Life and Letters of George Perkins Marsh'' (New York, 1888). This last work was left incomplete, the second volume never having been published. She also translated from the German of [[Johann C. Biernatzki]] (1795–1840), ''The Hallig; or the Sheepfold in the Waters'' (1856). (See "[[Hallig]]").

==Art collection==
Marsh actively studied and collected engravings, including European [[Old Master]] prints.&lt;ref name=NMAH&gt;{{cite web|title=About George Perkins Marsh|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/object-groups/marsh-collection?ogmt_page=about-marsh|website=http://americanhistory.si.edu/|publisher=National Museum of American History|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His collection included more than a thousand prints by various artists, dating from the 15th to the 19th centuries, representing works by [[Rembrandt]], [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[William Hogarth]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marsh Collection: About the Collection|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/object-groups/marsh-collection?ogmt_page=collection-about|website=http://americanhistory.si.edu/|publisher=The National Museum of American History|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1849, the [[Smithsonian Institution]] purchased a large group of Marsh's European prints and art books, which was transferred on deposit to the [[Library of Congress]] in 1865. During the 1880s and 1890s, the Smithsonian got some of the Marsh Collection returned, but part of it still remains at the Library of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Marsh Collection|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/object-groups/marsh-collection?ogmt_page=marsh-introduction|website=http://americanhistory.si.edu/|publisher=The National Museum of American History|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trafficking of persons is the fastest growing and most profitable criminal activity after drug and arms trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mattar | first = Mohamed Y. | title = Trafficking of persons, especially women and children, in countries of the Middle East: the scope of the problem and the appropriate legislative responses | journal = [[Fordham International Law Journal]] | volume = 26 | issue = 3 | id = article 7 | publisher = [[Fordham University School of Law]] | date = 2002 | url = http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/ilj/vol26/iss3/7/ | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1882&amp;context=ilj Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the United Nations Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, [[human trafficking]] is defined as follows: “Trafficking in persons shall mean the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation.

==Prevalence==
According to Kapstein in the journal of Foreign Affairs, the industrial states have failed to put in much effort to alleviate the issue. He believes that the problem is not one of political capability, but political will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Kapstein | first = Ethan B. | title = The new global slave trade | url = https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2006-11-01/new-global-slave-trade | work = [[Foreign Affairs]] | publisher = [[Council on Foreign Relations]] | date = 1 November 2006 | access-date = 10 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A challenge in combating human trafficking in Middle Eastern countries is that the governments deny there is a problem. The lack of political will is partially the result of empty threats from the international community, but most of it can be attributed to deeper economic forces and sociological factors at play.&lt;ref name=Doe /&gt; In her article in "Global Tides," Stephanie Doe states that sex trafficking is a sensitive topic in the Middle East for various reasons. On one level, it suggests moral corruption, which implies the waning influence of Islamic values in society. On a more significant level, in most Middle Eastern countries, because the governments are responsible for preserving tradition and upholding Islamic authority, it challenges their ability to retain a nation unified by Islam. Consequently, if the government was to acknowledge sex trafficking as a problem, it could be interpreted as alluding to the state’s diminishing power.&lt;ref name=Doe /&gt; It is difficult to quantify how large the problem of human trafficking is because trafficked persons are usually kept out of sight and in inaccessible locations. Human trafficking is an underground activity and the victims are referred to as a “hidden population.” The profits from this industry often go through a process of money laundering, making it difficult to trace the activities of traffickers.&lt;ref name=Sallie&gt;{{cite journal | last = Yea | first = Sallie | title = Human trafficking - a geographical perspective | journal = Geodate | volume = 23 | issue = 3 | pages = 2-6 | publisher = Warringal Publications| date = July 2010 | url = http://moodle.plc.nsw.edu.au/pluginfile.php/6379/mod_page/content/5/GeoDate_Vol_23_No_3_July_2010.pdf | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Girls and women who are sexually exploited by rape, forced prostitution, or sexual slavery are tainted with social stigmas for the rest of their lives. The link to sexual immorality further exacerbates this stigma. Once that link is created, the damage the woman's reputation can never be undone.&lt;ref name=Doe /&gt; In 2003, a study published in the ''[[Journal of Aggression, Maltreatment &amp; Trauma|Journal of Trauma Practice]]'' found that 89 percent of women in prostitution wanted to escape.

For the majority of the 1990s, human trafficking was incorrectly defined as illegal migration, smuggling, or sex work. The UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress, and Punish Trafficking in Persons defines trafficking comprehensively: its focus is on coercion for the purpose of exploitation, and it precludes the possibility of legal consent by the victims of traffickers. In the Middle East, some of the most prevalent forms of human trafficking are forced labor of migrant workers, sexual enslavement and forced prostitution and camel jockeying of young boys.

===Forced labor===
Today slavery typically involves women and children being sold into involuntary servitude by the means of violence and deprivation. There is a clear lack of labor protection laws for domestic workers in the GCC ([[Gulf Cooperation Council]]) countries. The international community recognizes the trafficking of women and children as a modern form of slavery. Many migrant people, mainly from Asian states, are tricked into coming to the Middle East, where they find themselves in a forced labor situation or working for very low wages. Traffickers trap their victims by coercion, force, or fraud. The forced labor of migrant workers is especially prevalent in the oil-rich [[Persian Gulf]] states of [[Kuwait]], [[Oman]], [[Qatar]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]]. The workers are frequently held to pay off the debt they have accumulated from the costs of travel and housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dudley | first = Schuyler | title = Human Trafficking in the Middle East and North Africa Region | journal = Topical Research Digest: Human Rights and Human Trafficking | page = 74 | publisher = Warringal Publications | date = 2008 | url = http://www.du.edu/korbel/hrhw/researchdigest/trafficking/ | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.du.edu/korbel/hrhw/researchdigest/trafficking/MiddleEast.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Trafficking from South Asia to the Middle East is a serious problem, with about 200,000 persons trafficked over 20 years, and 3,400 children over the last 10 years. The International Labor Organization estimates the minimum number of persons in forced labor in the Middle East and North Africa is around 230,000.&lt;ref name=Baldwin&gt;{{citation | last = Baldwin-Edwards | first = Martin | contribution = Trafficking of women and children | editor-last = Baldwin-Edwards | editor-first = Martin | title = Migration in the Middle East and Mediterranean | pages = 19-22 | year = 2005 | url = http://iom.ch/jahia/webdav/site/myjahiasite/shared/shared/mainsite/policy_and_research/gcim/rs/RS5.pdf | format = pdf | ref = harv | postscript = .}} A paper prepared for the Policy Analysis and Research Programme of the Global Commission on International Migration, gcim.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual enslavement===
Most commonly, but not exclusively, human trafficking is exploitation in the form of forced prostitution or sexual enslavement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mattar | first = Mohamed Y. | title = Trafficking of persons, especially women and children, in countries of the Middle East: the scope of the problem and the appropriate legislative responses | journal = [[Fordham International Law Journal]] | volume = 26 | issue = 3 | id = article 7 | pages = 721-760 | publisher = [[Fordham University School of Law]] | date = 2002 | url = http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/ilj/vol26/iss3/7/ | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1882&amp;context=ilj Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; State authorities have typically confused sex trafficking with prostitution. Some young impoverished women are attracted to the sex industry because it appears to offer quick and easy money. Traffickers often lure desperate young women with the promise of a better paying job or higher education into a destination country where their documentation and passports are forcibly taken from them as soon as they arrive. These women often find themselves in slave-like situations. Once trafficked into the sex industry, traffickers control the women through physical and psychological means. Prostitution in the Middle East is strictly illegal, along with all sexual activity outside lawful marriage. The religious outlawing of extramarital sex reinforces this trade and consequently further bolsters the demand for prostitution. The issue is exacerbated by the lack of legislative actions taken by states to control prostitution and trafficking.&lt;ref name=Doe /&gt;

===Camel jockeying===
Even though the most common forms of human trafficking are sexual enslavement and forced labor, these are not the only cases. The type of trafficking that is quite unique to the Middle East is the forced camel jockeying of young boys.&lt;ref name=Baldwin /&gt; [[Camel racing]] is a particularly dangerous and violent practice that young boys are forced into against their will. Boys from Bangladesh, India and Pakistan are recruited around five years of age to be camel jockeys in Middle Eastern countries such as the United Arab Emirates. Their parents normally sell them to agents who go around poor districts in these countries and offer to take male children away to the UAE to work. These agents tell parents that the children will earn large sums of money that will be sent home to the families. The parents are typically deceived about the conditions of work. They are led to believe that the children are going to obtain good jobs and will have a better future than if they remain at home. Usually the boys do not know who is taking them abroad or for what purpose. Most of the boys are not aware they will become camel jockeys against their will. When they arrive in the UAE, the children are transferred to ''azbas'', which are camel training complexes in the desert. The children are subject to several forms of abuse during their stay, including punishments such as a lack of food and electric shocks. Lack of food is a common practice because their owners try to maintain their weight at less than 20&amp;nbsp;kg  (44&amp;nbsp;lbs) for racing purposes. Deaths and injuries of children during racing is another major concern. If children accidentally die during a race they are buried straight away to avoid police investigations of the death. The conditions in the azbas are very restricting. Children are not allowed to leave the camel training complex. They sleep on cardboard boxes, making them very prone to scorpion bites. The children rise at 4:00am to begin exercising the camels. Every day they take the camels for rides until 11:00am. Then they are allowed to rest for two hours before feeding and cleaning the camels. Then they exercise the camels again until nightfall. The children are supposed to be paid for their work but that is almost never the case. The agent usually takes the salary and keeps it without allocating any to the child or his family. Running away is a virtual impossibility for children deployed as camel jockeys since the azbas are usually in remote desert locations. Usually children leave when they become too old or heavy and are no longer considered suitable for camel racing. Other children are sent home because they become seriously injured from racing. Police or immigration rescues are virtually unknown in the azbas.&lt;ref name=Sallie /&gt;

==Driving forces behind trafficking==

===Foreign migration===
One of the major forces driving human trafficking in the Middle East is the large influx of foreign migration. Research conducted in 1996 on the routes of illegal migration, smuggling and trafficking concluded that over the period 1992-97, the majority of illegal migrants to Europe had originated from Iraq, China, Pakistan, India or Africa. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) notes trafficking of women from Ghana to Lebanon, Libya and EU countries, women for domestic service from Central and West Africa to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and even voluntary migrations of women from Ethiopia to the Middle East, where working conditions are considered to be virtual slavery.&lt;ref name=Baldwin /&gt; The Middle East is a destination region for men and women trafficked for the purpose of commercial and sexual exploitation. Wealthy Arab men from the Persian Gulf area have been known to rent flats that are ‘furnished with housemaids’ for anywhere from a few hours to a few months. Most of the prostitutes and human trafficking victims tend to be from Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Pakistan. Very few countries in the Middle East are devoid of the commercial sex industry.&lt;ref name=Doe /&gt;

===Poverty===
Of the many locations where human trafficking is prevalent in the Middle East, most are characterized by poverty. Human trafficking is a market fueled by principles of supply and demand. Therefore, where there is poverty, there is a likely supply to meet the growing demand for sexual entertainment. Economic vulnerability increases the likelihood of women becoming sexual commodities for wealthy Arabs in the Persian Gulf area. Although there are overwhelming social implications, there also seem to be regional financial patterns that perpetuate this trend. Fewer work opportunities for women have led to prostitution as an alternative. For example, in Egypt, women from lower-class backgrounds see that a few nights in prostitution generates more money than one month’s work in the public sector. This makes Egypt a popular location for international sex tourism. Despite sex tourism being illegal, Egyptians find it hard to turn away Gulf hard currency due to their crumbling economy. The proliferation of prostitution, sex tourism, and misyar marriages can be understood as the consequence of uneven economic development, further exacerbated by principles of supply and demand. Persian Gulf nationals have the will and the means to pursue sexual entertainment, and poorer Muslim communities can supply services in return for financial security.&lt;ref name=Doe /&gt;

==Misyar marriages==
To avoid the repercussions of sex outside marriage, Middle Eastern men and women in certain countries engage in a common practice by the name of "misyar marriage", also called [[Nikah Misyar]]. This type of marriage was born for the sole purpose of physical pleasure. It can be defined as a “temporary marriage,” or its literal translation, “traveling marriage.”&lt;ref name=Tolol&gt;{{cite journal | last = Jassim Al-Nasr | first = Tolol | title = Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) women and Misyar marriage: evolution and progress in the Arabian Gulf| journal = Journal of International Women's Studies | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 43-57 | publisher = [[Bridgewater State University]] | date = March 2011 | url = http://vc.bridgew.edu/jiws/vol12/iss3/ | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://vc.bridgew.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1112&amp;context=jiws Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Misyar marriages do not require cohabitation of the husband and wife, long-term commitment, welfare provisions to the wife, or the intention of procreating, which are all the elements of a traditional Islamic marriage. While misyar marriages do have a technical contract, the duration of the marriage is not explicitly stated in the contract but instead implied. Misyar marriages have been commonly referred to as “legal prostitution,”&lt;ref name=Tolol /&gt; A marriage of this kind is not an option for a woman who wants to be viewed as respectable because it compromises many of her rights and basic values. Despite its controversial nature, misyar marriages are both religiously and legally accepted as valid marriages. According to Syed Ahmad, misyar marriages are popular in Islamic countries because it legitimizes sexual relations outside conventional marriages. Sheikh Yusuf Al-Qaradawi, a leading authority and one of the few remaining figures of Islamic scholarship, states that the misyar marriage is religiously legitimate. Al-Qaradawi adds that “there is no doubt that such marriage may be somehow socially unacceptable, but there is a big difference between what is Islamically valid and what is socially acceptable.” He is indicating that as long as both parties accept the terms of the marriage contract, they are legally married in the eyes of Allah. Misyar marriages purportedly prevent unmarried youth and widows from fulfilling their sexual desires outside marriage, which would traditionally be considered sinful. Misyar legitimizes these acts that would otherwise be seen as unlawful. The Middle East is well known for its strict observation of moral codes and sensitivity to the taboo subject of sex. In most societies of the Middle East where Islam is the dominant religion, premarital and extramarital sex is considered fornication. In a few countries, fornicators receive one hundred lashes of a whip with a crowd of witnesses for sins such as premarital sex. ''Zina'' is the word in many Middle Eastern countries for the concept of sexual misconduct by men and women. Despite all of these repercussions for extramarital sex, media coverage and human rights groups are revealing that prostitution is present and thriving in the Middle East. Misyar marriages also tend to exploit the economic vulnerability of women in poverty.&lt;ref name=Doe /&gt;

The '''Kumbukumbu Room''', or '''Kumbukumbu Room: Africa, Memory and Heritage''', or '''Kumbukumbu Exhibition''', was one of the spaces of the [[National Museum of Brazil]], destroyed by the [[National Museum of Brazil fire|fire of 2018]]. The name of the room refers to a word in [[Swahili language|Swahili]], used for "objects, people or events that make us think about the past."

In the room, objects from the [[Africa|African]] and [[Afro-Brazilians|Afro-Brazilian]] collections were on display. In particular, the collections [[Police of the Court collection|Police of the Court]] and Heloísa Alberto Torres were featured. Also in the room were the set of gifts from Africa sent to [[John VI of Portugal|John, the Clement]], in 1810, including the Throne of the [[King of Dahomey]]. Most of the objects on display were from the 19th century.

The room was organized from nine showcases, six side and three central, and a map from which one could establish the origin of the exposed pieces. According to the official book of presentation of the exhibition:
{| class="cquote2" style="text-align: left; border-collapse: collapse; border-style: none; background-color: transparent; margin-bottom: 58px;"
| id="24" style="width:20px; vertical-align:top; color:#B2B7F2;font-size:40px;font-family:serif;font-weight:bold;text-align:left;padding:10px 10px;" |“
| id="26" style="padding:4px 10px;" |Walking through the exhibition room clockwise, from the front door, we have the first showcase, [[Africa]], past and present, which gives an overview of the African continent; the second deals with the [[colonial war]]; the third exhibits objects from the equatorial forest peoples and is related to the central showcase, which shows a large [[elephant tusk]]; the fourth presents [[Angola]] after the [[Slavery in Africa|Atlantic slavery]]; and fifth, the gifts sent by the king of Dahomey to the [[king of Portugal]] as part of its diplomacy of friendship.The flag and throne are also part of this group, which are exhibited in the two other central windows. The last showcase is devoted to the [[Africans in Brazil]], covering both Africans born in Africa and their descendants.

|}

== Division ==
The room was divided into six spaces:

* The Diplomacy of Friendship
* The colonial war 
* Africans in Brazil 
* Angola after the Atlantic slavery 
* The people of the equatorial forest
* Africa past and present

&lt;blockquote&gt;In combination, the ballot access requirements for independent legislative candidates in Illinois--the early filing deadline, the 10% signature requirement, and the additional statutory restriction that disqualifies anyone who signs an independent candidate's nominating petition from voting in the primary--operate to unconstitutionally burden the freedom of political association guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Ballot access barriers this high--they are the most restrictive in the nation and have effectively eliminated independent legislative candidacies from the Illinois political scene for a quarter of a century--are not sustainable based on the state's asserted interest in deterring party splintering, factionalism, and frivolous candidacies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsws.org/articles/2006/sep2006/illi-s20.shtml Judge orders election board to certify Illinois SEP candidate], Jerome White, Sept. 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Minotauros Myron NAMA 1664 n1.jpg|thumb|In classical mythology, the [[Minotaur]] was defeated by the [[hero]] [[Theseus]].]]
A '''legendary''', '''mythical''', or '''mythological creature''', traditionally called a '''fabulous beast''' or '''fabulous creature''', is a  fictitious, imaginary and often supernatural [[animal]], often a [[Mythological hybrid|hybrid]], sometimes part [[human]], whose existence has not or cannot be proved and that is described in [[folklore]] or [[fiction]] but also in historical accounts before history became a science.

In the [[classical era]], monstrous creatures such as the [[cyclops]] and the [[Minotaur]] appear in [[hero]]ic tales for the protagonist to destroy. Other creatures, such as the [[unicorn]], were claimed in accounts of [[natural history]] by various scholars of antiquity.&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite book |title=The Encyclopædia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information |year=1911 |publisher=University Press |page=581}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dundes1984"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bascom |first=William |authorlink3=William Bascom |editor=Alan Dundes |title=Sacred Narrative: Readings in the Theory of Myth |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l5Om2ALAFbEC&amp;q=Three_Forms_of_Prose_Narratives#v=snippet&amp;q=table&amp;f=false |year=1984 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=9780520051928 |page= 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SimpsonRoud2000"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Simpson |first1=Jacqueline |last2=Roud |first2=Steve |title=A Dictionary of English Folklore |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iTcdvd1iRXsC&amp;q=myth#v=snippet&amp;q=myths&amp;f=false |accessdate=24 March 2013 |year=2000 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780192100191}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some legendary creatures have their origin in traditional [[mythology]] and were believed to be real creatures, for example [[dragon]]s, [[griffin]]s, and [[unicorn]]s.

==Animals==

{{further|List of legendary creatures by type|List of Greek mythological creatures}}
A variety of mythical animals appear in the art and stories of the [[Classical era]]. For example in the ''[[Odyssey]]'', monstrous creatures include the [[Cyclops]], [[Scylla]] and [[Charybdis]] for the hero [[Odysseus]] to confront. In other tales there appear the [[medusa (mythology)|Medusa]] to be defeated by [[Perseus]], the (human/bull) [[Minotaur]] to be destroyed by [[Theseus]], and the [[Hydra (mythology)|Hydra]] to be killed by [[Heracles]], while [[Aeneas]] battles with the [[harpy|harpies]]. These monsters thus have the basic function of emphasizing the greatness of the [[hero]]es involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Delahoyde |first1=M. |last2=McCartney |first2=Katherine S. |title=Monsters in Classical Mythology |url=http://public.wsu.edu/~delahoyd/classical.monsters.html |publisher=Washington State University |accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grimal, Pierre. The Dictionary of Classical Mythology. Blackwell Reference, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sabin, Frances E. Classical Myths That Live Today. Silver Burdett Company, 1940.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some classical era creatures, such as the (horse/human) [[centaur]], [[Chimera (mythology)|chimaera]], [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]] and the [[Pegasus|flying horse]], are found also in [[Indian art]]. Similarly, [[sphinx]]es appear as winged lions in Indian art and the [[Piasa Bird]] of North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Murthy |first=K. Krishna |title=Mythical Animals in Indian Art |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dMI4rZuRs1MC&amp;pg=PA68 |year=1985 |publisher=Abhinav Publications |isbn=978-0-391-03287-3 |pages=68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=O'Flaherty, Wendy |title=Hindu Myths: A Sourcebook |publisher=Penguin |date=1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[medieval art]], animals, both real and mythical, played important roles. These included decorative forms as in medieval jewellery, sometimes with their limbs intricately interlaced. Animal forms were used to add humor or majesty to objects. In [[Christian art]], animals carried symbolic meanings, where for example the lamb symbolized Christ, a dove indicated the [[Holy Spirit]], and the classical [[griffin]] represented a guardian of the dead. [[Medieval bestiary|Medieval bestiaries]] included animals regardless of biological reality; the [[basilisk]] represented the [[devil]], while the [[manticore]] symbolised temptation.&lt;ref name="Met"&gt;{{cite web |author=Boehm, Barbara Drake; Holcomb, Melanie |date=January 2012 |origyear=2001 |title=Animals in Medieval Art |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/best/hd_best.htm |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art |accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegory==
[[File:Roof detail, dragon.jpg|thumb|Symbolic power: a [[dragon]] in the [[Imperial City, Huế]], Vietnam]]
{{further|Allegory}}
One function of mythical animals in the Middle Ages was allegory. Unicorns, for example, were described as extraordinarily swift and uncatchable by traditional methods.&lt;ref name="Gravestock"&gt;Gravestock, Pamela. "Did Imaginary Animals Exist?" In ''The Mark of the Beast: The Medieval Bestiary in Art, Life, and Literature''. New York: Garland. 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|127}} It was believed that the only way for one to catch this beast was to lead a virgin to its dwelling. Then, the unicorn was supposed to leap into her lap and go to sleep, at which point a hunter could finally capture it.&lt;ref name="Gravestock"/&gt;{{rp|127}} In terms of symbolism, the unicorn was a metaphor for Christ. Unicorns represented the idea of innocence and purity. In the [[King James Version|King James Bible]], Psalm 92:10 states, "My horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn." This is because the translators of the King James erroneously translated the Hebrew word [[re'em]] as unicorn.&lt;ref name="Gravestock"/&gt;{{rp|128}} Later versions translate this as wild ox.&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Schrader. ''The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin'', New Series, Vol. 44, No. 1, "A Medieval Bestiary" (Summer, 1986), pp. 1+12–55, 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The unicorn's small size signifies the humility of Christ.&lt;ref name="Gravestock"/&gt;{{rp|128}}

Another common legendary creature which served allegorical functions within the Middle Ages was the [[dragon]]. Dragons were identified with serpents, though their attributes were greatly intensified. The dragon was supposed to have been larger than all other animals.&lt;ref name="Gravestock"/&gt;{{rp|126}} It was believed that the dragon had no harmful poison but was able to slay anything it embraced without any need for venom. Biblical scriptures speak of the dragon in reference to the devil, and they were used to denote sin in general during the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name="Gravestock"/&gt;{{rp|126}} Dragons were said to have dwelled in places like Ethiopia and India, based on the idea that there was always heat present in these locations.&lt;ref name="Gravestock"/&gt;{{rp|126}}

Physical detail was not the central focus of the artists depicting such animals, and medieval bestiaries were not conceived as biological categorizations. Creatures like the unicorn and [[griffin]] were not categorized in a separate "mythological" section in medieval bestiaries,&lt;ref name="Flores"&gt;Flores, Nona C., "The Mirror of Nature Distorted: The Medieval Artist's Dilemma in Depicting Animals". In ''The Medieval World of Nature''. New York: Garland. 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|124}} as the symbolic implications were of primary importance. Animals we know to have existed were still presented with a fantastical approach. It seems the religious and moral implications of animals were far more significant than matching a physical likeness in these renderings. Nona C. Flores explains, "By the tenth century, artists were increasingly bound by allegorical interpretation, and abandoned naturalistic depictions."&lt;ref name="Flores"/&gt;{{rp|15}} Similarly, the historian [[Richard Kieckhefer]] explains, "Magic is not meant to work but to express wishes, or to encode in symbols a perception of how things do or should work."&lt;ref&gt;Kieckhefer, Richard. "The Specific Rationality of Medieval Magic". In ''The American Historical Review'', Vol. 99, Issue 3, 813-836. 1994, 814.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Countries by soldier count.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|Countries by number of active soldiers (2009)]]
This is a '''list of countries by number of military and paramilitary personnel'''. It includes any government-sponsored soldiers used to further the domestic and foreign policies of their respective government. The term "[[country]]" is used in its most common use, in the sense of [[State (polity)|state]] which exercises [[sovereignty]] or has limited [[Diplomatic recognition|recognition]].

==Guide to the list==
The list consists of columns that can be sorted by clicking on the appropriate title:
*The names of the states, accompanied by their respective [[national flag]]s.
*The number of [[military]] personnel on [[active duty]] that are currently serving full-time in their military capacity.
*The number of military personnel in the [[military reserve force|reserve forces]] that are not normally kept [[under arms]], whose role is to be available to [[Mobilization|mobilize]] when necessary.
*The number of personnel in [[paramilitary]] forces: armed units that are not considered part of a nation's formal military forces.
*The total number of active, reserve, and paramilitary personnel.
* The ratio per thousand inhabitants of total military (active, reserve, and paramilitary).
* The ratio per thousand inhabitants of active military only.

As military forces around the world are constantly changing in size, no definitive list can ever be compiled.

Many of the 171 countries listed here, especially those with the highest number of total soldiers such as the two [[Korea]]s and [[Vietnam]], include a large number of paramilitaries, civilians and policemen in their reserve personnel. Some countries, such as [[Italy]] and [[Japan]], have only volunteers in their armed forces. Other countries, such as [[Mauritius]] and [[Panama]], have no national armies, but only a paramilitary force.

'''Mary Margaret Truman Daniel''' (February 17, 1924 – January 29, 2008), also known as '''Margaret Truman''' or '''Margaret Daniel''', was an American classical [[soprano]], actress, journalist, radio and television personality, writer, and New York socialite. The only child of President [[Harry S Truman]] and First Lady [[Bess Truman]], she was "a witty, hard-working Midwestern girl with singing talent who was neither particularly pretty nor terribly plain."&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article3291313.ece Times online, February 2, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from [[George Washington University]] in 1946, she embarked on a career as a coloratura soprano beginning with a concert appearance with the [[Detroit Symphony Orchestra]] in 1947. She appeared in concerts with orchestras throughout the United States and in recitals throughout the U.S. through 1956. While she did occasionally perform opera arias in concert, she never appeared in staged operas and mainly focused her career on performing works from the concert soprano, lieder, and art song repertoires. She made recordings with [[R.C.A. Victor]] and made television appearances on programs like ''[[What’s My Line?]]'' and ''[[The Bell Telephone Hour]]''.&lt;ref name="sun"&gt;{{citenews|url=https://www.nysun.com/obituaries/margaret-truman-83-singer-and-author/70406/|title=Margaret Truman, 83, Singer and Author|work=[[The New York Sun]]|date=January 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957 Truman abandoned her singing career to pursue a career as a journalist and radio personality when she became the co-host of the program ''[[Weekday]]'' with [[Mike Wallace]]. She also wrote articles as an independent journalist as well for a variety of publications in the 1960s and 1970s. She later became the successful author of a series of murder mysteries and a number of works on U.S. First Ladies and First Families, including biographies of her father, President [[Harry S. Truman]] and mother [[Bess Truman]]. She was married to journalist [[Clifton Daniel]], managing editor of ''[[The New York Times]]''. The couple were prominent New York socialites who often hosted events for the New York elite.&lt;ref name="sun"/&gt;

==Early life==
[[File:Margaret Truman.jpg|thumb|upright|Margaret Truman]]Mary Margaret was born in [[Independence, Missouri]], on February 17, 1924, and was christened Mary Margaret Truman (for her aunt Mary Jane Truman and maternal grandmother Margaret Gates Wallace) but was called Margaret from early childhood.  She attended school in Independence until her father's 1934 election to the [[United States Senate]], after which her education was split between schools in Washington, D.C. and Independence.&lt;ref name="Margaret Truman Daniel bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trumanlibrary.org/mtd-bio.htm|title=Margaret Truman Daniel bio|publisher= Truman Presidential Library|date=|access-date=June 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1942, she matriculated at [[George Washington University]], where she was a member of [[Pi Beta Phi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pibetaphi.org/pibetaphi/aboutus.aspx?id=39326 |title=Notable Pi Phis |work=pibetaphi.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713152749/http://www.pibetaphi.org/pibetaphi/aboutus.aspx?id=39326 |archivedate=July 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in History in 1946.&lt;ref name="Margaret Truman Daniel bio" /&gt; In June 1944, she christened the battleship [[USS Missouri (BB-63)|USS ''Missouri'']] at [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]], and spoke again in 1986 at the ship's recommissioning.

==Career==
===Singing career===
After classical vocal training, Truman's singing career began with a debut radio recital in March 1947 followed shortly thereafter with her professional concert debut with the [[Detroit Symphony Orchestra]]. She sang professionally for the next decade, appearing with major American orchestras and giving several national concert tours.&lt;ref name="sun"/&gt; Some of her credits include concert appearances with the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]] at the [[Hollywood Bowl]], the [[National Symphony Orchestra]], the [[NBC Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Pittsburg Symphony]], the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]], and the [[Saint Louis Symphony]] among others. While she never performed in staged operas, she did perform opera arias in concert. Her performances were mainly of both sacred and secular art songs, lieder, and works from the concert soprano repertoire. In 1951 she recorded an album of American Art Songs for RCA Victor.&lt;ref name="sun"/&gt; She also made recordings of German lieder for [[NBC]]. A 1951 ''[[Time Magazine]]'' cover&lt;ref&gt;''Time'', February 26, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; featured Truman with a single musical note floating by her head. She performed on stage, radio, and television through 1956.&lt;ref name="sun"/&gt;

At the beginning of her career, critical reviews of Truman’s singing were positive or diplomatic in tone, with one later reviewer speculating that negative opinions were held back out of deference for her father as a current sitting United Stares President.&lt;ref name="sun"/&gt; This practice was broken in 1950 when ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' music critic [[Paul Hume]] wrote that Truman was "extremely attractive on the stage... [but] cannot sing very well. She is flat a good deal of the time. And still cannot sing with anything approaching professional finish." The review angered President Truman who wrote to Hume, "Some day I hope to meet you. When that happens you'll need a new nose, a lot of beefsteak for black eyes, and perhaps a supporter below!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trumanlibrary.org/trivia/letter.htm|title=Truman's Letter to Paul Hume|publisher=Truman Library, Independence Mo.|date=December 6, 1950|access-date=June 2, 2011}} Years later Margaret Truman recalled, "I thought it was funny. Sold tickets." (Staff writer, ''[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22897931/ Truman's only child dies at 83]'', MSNBC, January 29, 2008, retrieved January 29, 2008.)&lt;/ref&gt; His response was published by ''The Washington Post'' and drew international headlines, becoming a minor scandal for the Truman administration. Reviewers after that, felt more free to be honest in their reviews of her performances, with mixed criticism for her singing thereafter.&lt;ref name="sun"/&gt;

===Acting and journalism===
Truman's professional acting debut occurred April 26, 1951. She co-starred with [[James Stewart]] in the "Jackpot" episode of ''[[Screen Directors Playhouse]]'' on [[NBC]] radio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Margaret Truman To Star Tonight On Radio Drama|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3629257/las_cruces_sunnews/|agency=Las Cruces Sun-News|date=April 26, 1951|location=New Mexico, Las Cruces|page=1|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|access-date = November 14, 2015}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 17, 1952, Truman was guest soloist on ''[[The Railroad Hour]]'' in a presentation of ''[[Der Zigeunerprimas|Sari]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kirby|first1=Walter|title=Better Radio Programs for the Week|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2470060/the_decatur_daily_review/|agency=The Decatur Daily Review|date=March 16, 1952|page=44|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|access-date = May 23, 2015}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Truman also performed on the NBC Radio program ''[[The Big Show (NBC Radio)|The Big Show]]''.

She became part of the team of [[NBC Radio]]'s ''Weekday'' show that premiered in 1955, shortly after its ''[[Monitor (NBC Radio)|Monitor]]'' program made its debut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=epdRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=52sDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5173,5277013&amp;dq=dave+garroway+monitor&amp;hl=en|title='Monitor' to debut on KDKA Sunday|date=June 10, 1955|publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|access-date=March 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paired with [[Mike Wallace]], she presented news and interviews aimed at a female listening audience.&lt;ref name="Ace" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,861682,00.html|title=Radio:Woman's Home Companion|date=November 28, 1955|publisher=Time|access-date=January 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing===
Truman's full-length biography of her father, published shortly before his death, was critically acclaimed. She also wrote a personal biography of her mother and histories of the [[White House]] and its inhabitants (including [[First Lady of the United States|first ladies]] and [[United States presidential pets|pets]]). A series of murder mysteries, the Capital Crimes series, set in and around Washington, D.C., were published under her name; they were ghostwritten, first by William Harrington (according to Harrington).&lt;ref name="HarringtonObit"&gt;{{cite news|title=William G. Harrington, 68; Wrote Mysteries and Thrillers|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/16/arts/william-g-harrington-68-wrote-mysteries-and-thrillers.html|access-date=October 15, 2014|work=[[New York Times]]|date=November 16, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Harrington's apparent suicide, a self-written obituary was found in which he referred to Margaret Truman and others as his "clients". Harrington's literary agent (who was also Truman's agent) denied any collaboration with Truman, while somewhat obliquely acknowledging Harrington had "worked on" books credited to another author. Harrington has been "squarely"{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} credited by at least one verifiable source with ghostwriting all the books published by the child of another United States president, [[Elliott Roosevelt]] and then, allegedly, those published by [[Donald Bain (writer)|Donald Bain]].&lt;ref&gt;Breen, Jon.

Truman published regularly into her eighties. She served on the board of directors for the [[Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum]] and the Board of Governors of the [[Roosevelt Institute]].&lt;ref name="NYTObit"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gelder|first1=Lawrence Van|title=Margaret Truman Daniel Dies at 83|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/29/us/30cnd-daniel.html?_r=0|access-date=October 14, 2016|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

==Later years and death==
In later life, Truman lived in her [[Park Avenue]] home.&lt;ref name="NYTObit" /&gt; She died on January 29, 2008, in Chicago (to which she was relocating to be nearer her son Clifton).

==Summary==
At the turn of the nineteenth century, the young Indian woman Sacagawea leads Lewis and Clark to the Pacific. But what about that tiny infant in the commemorative engraving, perched on Sacagawea’s back? He is her son, Jean-Baptiste Charbonneau, the youngest member of the Expedition, a child caught between two worlds who grows into a man haunted by the mother he barely knew and the wilderness she betrayed.
Sacagawea is only sixteen when she leads the Expedition and catches the eye of William Clark who finds her exotically appealing. Afterwards, Clark takes in Sacagawea and her child, and raises Baptiste as a foster son. When the teenage Baptiste attracts the notice of the visiting Duke Paul, Prince of Wurttemberg, Clark approves of the duke’s “experiment” to educate the boy at court. A gleeful Duke Paul exhibits Baptiste throughout Europe as a “half gentleman-half animal.” Eventually Jean Baptiste turns his back on the Old World and returns to the New, determined to find his true place there. He travels deep into the heart of the American wilderness, and into the depths of his mother’s soul, on an epic quest for identity that brings sacrifice, loss, and the distant promise of redemption.

==Reviews==

The expedition [[papoose]] Charbonneau appears on the front of the [[Sacagawea dollar|Sacagawea gold one-dollar coin]] (2000 to 2008) and remains in circulation in the United States today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://coins.about.com/od/famousrarecoinprofiles/p/sacagawea_coin.html// Famous Rare Coin Profiles: Gold Dollar].&lt;/ref&gt;

Calling the story “heart-wrenching,” [[Smithsonian Institution]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://smithsonian.com/ Smithsonian Institution].&lt;/ref&gt; has recognized the work of fiction with a publication reading at the Smithsonian’s [[National Museum of the American Indian]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]

Described by publisher [[McBooks Press]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcbooks.com// McBooks Press].&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Ithaca]], [[New York (state)|New York]], as “haunting,” the novel tracks the young man’s descent into deepest, darkest civilization in a search for his place in the world: At the turn of the nineteenth century, the young Indian woman Sacagawea leads Lewis and Clark to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. But what about that tiny infant in the commemorative engraving, perched on Sacagawea’s back? He is her son, Jean-Baptiste Charbonneau, the youngest member of the Expedition, a child caught between two worlds who grows into a man haunted by the mother he barely knew and the wilderness she betrayed.

Duke Paul of Wurttemberg’s journal ''Erste Reise nach dem nordlichen Amerika in den Jahren 1822-1824'', translated by W. Robert Nitske and edited by [[Savoie Lottinville]] as ''Travels in North America, 1822-1824'', includes individual entries documenting the botanist nobleman's taking the precocious young Charbonneau, whom Clark had adopted and educated in [[St Louis]], to Germany with him with the promise of further education, departing [[New Orleans]] aboard the brig ''[[Smyrna (ship)|Smyrna]]'' in January 1824. Adept at languages including [[Mandan language|Mandan]], French, [[Latin language|Latin]], English, [[German language|German]], and Spanish, the young Charbonneau spent over five years at court. In the novel, young Baptiste travels across the Levant with Duke Paul and the prince’s painting companion Vogelweide, and performs piano in the presence of Beethoven.

According to ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'':&lt;ref&gt;[http://publishersweekly.com/ Publishers Weekly].&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|“''Playwright Sargent’s debut novel is a stylish look at the fate of Sacagawea’s baby son, Jean Baptiste Charbonneau, the first Native American to tour Europe—as a curiosity and entertainment, of course. Twenty-four-year-old Sacagawea, though married, becomes William Clark’s lover while helping guide the Lewis and Clark Expedition; after she dies on the trail, Clark adopts her son, Baptiste. Soon, Clark establishes his home in [[St. Louis]], as well as a garish [[museum]] dedicated to his expedition, and sets to educating his new son. Soon, Baptiste is traveling [[Europe]] under the protection of Duke Paul, a cruel man who, when he isn’t exhibiting the boy to royal courts, repeatedly rapes young Baptiste. Six years later, Baptiste returns to [[United States|America]] (astonishingly, still accompanied by Paul), where he confronts Clark over his mother’s mysterious death; unsatisfied and restless, Baptiste heads west and finds work as a fur trapper, an Army scout and gold prospector. Increasingly haunted by his mother, Baptiste revisits her in memories and visions that lend themselves nicely to Sargent’s lyrical prose.

The ''Museum of Human Beings'' in the title alludes to the notorious [[museum]] that General [[William Clark (explorer)|William Clark]] built beside his home in [[St Louis]] after he returned from the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Inside, Clark kept relics and specimens related to his various [[indigenous people of the Americas|American Indian]] affairs.

'''''Perchtenlaufen''''' is a folk custom found in the [[Euroregion Tyrol – South Tyrol – Trentino|Tyrol]] region of central Europe. Occurring on set occasions, the ceremony involves two groups of locals fighting against one another using wooden canes and sticks. Both groups are masked, one as 'beautiful' and the other as 'ugly' Perchte.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gin83|Ginzburg 1983]]. p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activity==
In the state of [[Styria]], Southeastern Austria, all of the ''Perchtln'' were played by women right into the 19th century. As a part of this, they blackened their faces, wore their hair long and sometimes exposed their breasts.&lt;ref name="Duerr 1985 33"&gt;[[#Du85|Duerr 1985]]. p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-20th century, one old woman was recorded as saying that when she was young she remembered seeing a female ''Perchtln'' from the Styrian municipality of [[Donnersbach]] who carried a swaddled baby. She related that many of the women dressed as ''Perchtln'' would let one breast hang out, but that they were so well disguised that "no one needed to be ashamed."&lt;ref name="Duerr 1985 33"/&gt;

In January 1977, the German anthropologist [[Hans Peter Duerr]] attended the ''Perchtenlaufen'' in Styria, noting that by that time there were no more female ''Perchtln'', with youths instead having taken up all of those roles.&lt;ref name="Duerr 1985 226"&gt;[[#Du85|Duerr 1985]]. p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations==
The Italian historian [[Carlo Ginzburg]] made reference to the ''perchtenlaufen'' in his book ''[[The Night Battles|The Night Battles: Witchcraft and Agrarian Cults in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries]]'' (1966, English translation 1983). He noted similarities between the ''perchtenlaufen'' and the ''[[benandanti]]'', a visionary tradition which existed in Early Modern [[Friuli]], a province in Northeastern Italy, which was the primary focus of ''The Night Battles''. He remarked that the ''perchtenlaufen'' was "undoubtedly a remnant of the ancient ritual battles" which he believed had originally been based around the fertility of the crops.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gin83|Ginzburg 1983]]. pp. 57&amp;ndash;58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ginzburg's comparison between the ''perchtenlaufen'' and the ''benandanti'' was adopted by the German anthropologist [[Hans Peter Duerr]] in his book ''[[Dreamtime (Duerr book)|Dreamtime: Concerning the Boundary between Wilderness and Civilization]]'' (1978, English translation 1985). He also compared it to the case of the [[Thiess of Kaltenbrun|Livonian werewolf]], arguing that they all represent a clash between the forces of order and chaos.&lt;ref name="Duerr 1985 32-39"&gt;[[#Due85|Duerr 1985]]. pp. 32&amp;ndash;39.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Plantae Asiaticae Rariores''''' is a horticultural work (alternative title ''Descriptions and figures of a select number of unpublished East Indian plants'') published in 1830–1832 by the [[Denmark|Danish]] [[botanist]] [[Nathaniel Wallich]].

''Plantae Asiaticae Rariores'' was published in London, Paris and Strassburg between 1829 and 1832 and consisted of 3 volumes bound from the 12 original parts in folio size (21½ × 14½ inches) with 294 hand-coloured plates lithographed by [[Maxim Gauci]]. Wallich went on extended leave in 1828 to supervise the printing and hand-colouring of the illustrations in England. Foremost of the watercolour artists who executed the original paintings were two Indian artists, Vishnupersaud, responsible for 114 plates and Gorachand for 87. Vishnupersaud (occasionally referred to as Vishnu Prasad) was an Indian artist frequently employed by naturalists working in India, such as [[John Forbes Royle]] and [[Francis Buchanan-Hamilton]].  Vishnupersaud’s skill was legendary and [[Wilfrid Jasper Walter Blunt|Wilfrid Blunt]] included one of his watercolours in his book ''The Art of Botanical Illustration'' as displaying great craftsmanship. The remaining plates were done by Charles M. Curtis (7), [[William Griffith (botanist)|William Griffith]] (3), [[Sarah Drake]], and various others. A double-page engraved map of India created by [[John Arrowsmith (cartographer)|John Arrowsmith]], showed the routes followed by various botanists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgeglazer.com/prints/nathist/botanical/wallichinv/wallichinv.html George Glazer Gallery]&lt;/ref&gt; A noteworthy point is that plate number 6 is an engraving by H. Weddell, and not a lithograph.

''Plantae Asiaticae'' was seen to follow naturally on [[William Roxburgh]]'s ''Plants of the coast of Coromandel'' (London: 1795–1820) and was sponsored by the [[East India Company]] who subscribed to 40 copies. The 12 parts were sold at £2 10s each, between September 1829 and August 1832.

Wallich writes in the introduction, "The present Work consists of a selection of plants made chiefly from a series of 1200 drawings, executed under my direction by Native Artists." He goes on to praise the work of the lithographer Maxim Gauci and the colourist John Clark: "For both of these worthy men and admirable artists I beg to express my sincere respect."

'''Rancho La Brea''' was a {{convert|4439|acre|km2|sing=on}} [[Ranchos of California|Mexican land grant]] in present-day [[Los Angeles County, California]] given in 1828 to Antonio Jose Rocha and Nemisio Dominguez by [[José Antonio Carrillo]], the [[List of pre-statehood mayors of Los Angeles, California|Alcalde of Los Angeles]].  Rancho La Brea consisted of one square league of land of what is now [[Miracle Mile, Los Angeles, California|Wilshire's Miracle Mile]], [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]], and parts of [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/hb4c6005p3/?&amp;brand=oac Diseño del Rancho La Brea]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reisvalleyandmudville.com/images/toposantamonicasouth.jpg 1900 USGS topographic map]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://digarc.usc.edu/assetserver/controller/view/search/CHS-13060 Map of old Spanish and Mexican ranchos in Los Angeles County]&lt;/ref&gt; The grant included the famous [[La Brea Tar Pits]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{gnis|id = 244384|name = Rancho La Brea}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The title awarded by the Alcalde in 1828 was confirmed by [[José María de Echeandía]], Governor of [[Alta California]]; in 1840, it was reconfirmed by Governor [[Juan Bautista Alvarado|Juan Alvarado]].&lt;ref&gt;Ogden Hoffman, 1862, ''Reports of Land Cases Determined in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California'', Numa Hubert, San Francisco&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[Mexican Cession|cession]] of California to the United States after the [[Mexican–American War]], the 1848 [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] provided that the land grants would be honored. As required by the [[Land Act of 1851]], a claim was filed by Antonio José Rocha, José Jorge Rocha, and Josefa de la Merced de Jordan with the [[Public Land Commission]] in 1852, but was rejected in 1860.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb109nb422&amp;chunk.id=c01-1.3.6.4&amp;brand=oac United States. District Court (California : Southern District) Land Case 287 SD]&lt;/ref&gt;  As a lawyer and surveyor, [[Henry Hancock]] worked for the Rocha family to aid them with their efforts to prove their claim to Rancho La Brea. The Rochas finally won their claim (the grant was recorded as patented to "A. J. Rocha et al." in 1873).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slc.ca.gov/Misc_Pages/Historical/Surveyors_General/reports/Willey_1884_1886.pdf  Report of the Surveyor General 1844 - 1886] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130320000647/http://www.slc.ca.gov/Misc_Pages/Historical/Surveyors_General/reports/Willey_1884_1886.pdf |date=March 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thelandpatents.com/patents/cacaaa-085077 Record of patent CACAAA 085077]&lt;/ref&gt; The grant included the famous [[La Brea Tar Pits]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

As happened to other rancheros, the claimants' legal expenses left them broke. In 1860, Antonio José Rocha's son, [[José Jorge Rocha]], deeded Rancho La Brea to [[Henry Hancock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.laokay.com/halac/RanchoLaBrea.htm |title=Rancho La Brea |accessdate=June 19, 2010 |quote=On January 6, 1828 Rancho La Brea was granted to Antonio Jose Rocha and Nemisio Dominguez by Jose Antonio Carrillo, the Alcalde of Los Angeles. The grant included a stipulation that the tar pits within the rancho would be open and available to all the citizens of the pueblo for their use. The title was confirmed by Jose Echeandia, who was the Governor of Alta California at the time. Later in 1840, it was reconfirmed by Governor Juan B.

He shipped considerable quantities to San Francisco by schooner.  Most of Rancho La Brea was later subdivided and developed by his surviving son, Captain [[George Allan Hancock]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wshphs.org/windsor.html Windsor Square – Hancock Park Historical Society] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423114912/http://www.wshphs.org/windsor.html |date=April 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He owned the Rancho La Brea Oil Company and donated {{convert|23|acre|m2}} of Hancock Park to Los Angeles County in 1924 to preserve and exhibit the fossils exhumed from Rancho La Brea.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tarpits.org/our-story/about-the-page&lt;/ref&gt; The [[La Brea Tar Pits]] within the Park are a now registered [[National Natural Landmark]].

Arthur Gilmore bought some of the Rancho land in the 1890s and started a dairy farm. Drilling for water, he struck oil. This find was named the [[Salt Lake Oil Field]] after the company that drilled for him. Arthur's son Earl Gilmore built [[Gilmore Stadium]] next to [[Gilmore Field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Healey|first=Paul|title=Gilmore Field|url=http://www.projectballpark.org/history/pcl/gilmore.html|publisher=www.projectballpark.org/|accessdate=August 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PMFAQ"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://www.tarpits.org/info/faq/faqasphalt.html|publisher=Page Museum|accessdate=August 28, 2010|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612234140/http://tarpits.org/info/faq/faqasphalt.html|archivedate=June 12, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5120">'''Ruth Bourne''' was one of the Women of [[Bletchley Park]], recruited to help win [[World War II]] against the Germans from 1939-45. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://academic.oup.com/itnow/article/58/2/10/1745087|title=The Women of Bletchley Park|first=Sue|last=Black|date=1 June 2016|publisher=|journal=ITNOW|volume=58|issue=2|pages=10–11|doi=10.1093/itnow/bww033}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The Woman of Bletchley Park were a secret team put together by the government, made to sign a Secrets Act confirming that they would not tell anyone about their work there. During her time at Bletchley, Ruth Bournes' job was not only to work on the German code, but to be a bombe operator. She was one of the Wrens responsible for dismantling the bombes wire by wire after the war had ended in 1945. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5320978.stm|title=Enigma replica 'homage to heroes'|date=6 September 2006|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Recruitment and role==

Aged 17 at the time, Ruth was a trainee Wren when she was told that she would be joining the Woman of [[Bletchley Park]]. She was offered to sign a contract that tied her into endless hours of work, no social life and no way to exit once she had agreed. Ruth was recruited to be a member of the [[HMS Pembroke]] 5 team as part of the SDX special duties&lt;ref name="bcs.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bcs.org/content/conWebDoc/23849|title=Video: The Women of Station X - Society - Subject areas - Publishing and editorial - BCS - The Chartered Institute for IT|website=www.bcs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Bletchley Park]] workers consisted of two different teams the 'y station', the woman responsible for picking up the German code and the 'x station' those who were responsible for bomb disposal, like Ruth herself. 

===The job=== 
Majority of the woman recruited had no previous experience of bombe operation and were going in to the job blindsighted. The workers were only shown a few machines for training purposes on recruitment of the job. They were told not to ask any questions&lt;ref name="bcs.org"/&gt;. The role itself included "preparing the machines each day, turning the drums on the front and plugging up the boards at the back according to settings laid out in a menu"&lt;ref name="techrepublic.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.techrepublic.com/article/the-women-who-helped-crack-nazi-codes-at-bletchley-park/|title=Hacking the Nazis: The secret story of the women who broke Hitler's codes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. While Ruth was a checker she would be in charge of waiting for information to come through as 'confirmed'. When this happened she would then have to make a call to report the stop on the code menu which would be checked by other members of Bletchley. &lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7r65N2a6wpE|title=VEDAY70 - An interview with former Turing Bombe Operator Ruth Bourne|first=|last=USEmbassyLondon|date=7 May 2015|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 
Ruths job meant that she was on her feet all day and there was little time for breaks.&lt;ref name="techrepublic.com"/&gt;. There was a term 'mustard' &lt;ref name="bcs.org"/&gt;, that meant the workers at Bletchley park were told what they was going to do without any discussion or choice of their own. From the very first day of her work as a bombe operator to when her time at Bletchley ended, Ruth did what she was told on demand &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;. Despite the little amount of agency the workers had at [[Bletchley]], Bourne says herself that it was very satisfying to know that we were helping to break German codes. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/sep/07/secondworldwar.world|title=Back in action at Bletchley Park, the black box that broke the Enigma code|first=Esther|last=Addley|date=6 September 2006|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work as a bombe operator began in early 1944 and continued until the end of the war in 1945.

==After the war==

In 1945 when [[World War II]] ended, all of the workers of [[Bletchley Park]] were told that they must continue to keep their work there a secret. It wasn't until 30 years after the war (1970's) when the book "The Enigma Secret" was published that she, along with other Bletchley Park workers, were able to tell their families &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-politics-24888003/bletchley-park-they-also-served|title=Bletchley Park: they also served|website=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; about their involvement in bringing down [[Hitler]]. Ruth describes what it was like when the news finally broke saying that "you got so used to not talking to anyone"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-two/10619570/Can-you-keep-a-secret-The-Bletchley-codebreakers-70-years-on.html|title=Can you keep a secret? The Bletchley codebreakers 70 years on|first=Peter|last=Stanford|date=5 February 2014|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; that even after they were allowed to disclose their roles she still wouldn't talk about her experience in depth.

[[File:Public opinion of interracial marriage in the United States.png|thumb|526x526px|Graph indicating the extent to which US citizens agree or disagree with [[interracial marriage]], spanning 1958-2007.]]
'''Sexual racial preference''' is the individual's sexual preference of specific races. It is an inclination towards potential sexual or romantic partners on the basis of perceived racial identity. Not everyone agrees that this should be classified as racism, some argue that distinguishing among partners on the basis of perceived race is not racism at all but a justifiable personal preference.&lt;ref&gt;Callander, D., Newman, C. E., &amp; Holt, M. (2015). Is sexual racism really racism? Distinguishing attitudes toward sexual racism and generic racism among gay and bisexual men. Archives of sexual behavior, 44(7), 1991-2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The origins of sexual racism can be explained by looking at its history, especially in the US, where the abolition of slavery and the [[Reconstruction Era]] had significant impacts on interracial mixing. Attitudes towards interracial relationships, and indeed marriage, have increased in positivity in the last 50 years. In 1968, 73% of US citizens disapproved of the right to marry inter-racially, whereas this figure dropped to 17% by 2007, this illustrating the reduction in discriminatory attitudes towards interracial dating.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, J. (2007, August 16). Most Americans approve of interracial marriages. Retrieved from http:// www.gallup.com/poll/28417/most-americansapprove-interracial-marriages.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Irrespective of this, there still remains the issue of sexual racism in the [[Online dating service|online dating]] world, in that preferences appear to follow a racial hierarchy.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}  Sharing the basic premise, originating from the '[[taboo]]' nature of interracial relations, individuals of other racial groups are classified as forbidden sexual objects; the result of a [[Racial fetishism|racial fetish]].

== History ==

=== United States of America ===

After the abolition of [[slavery]] in 1865, the white Americans showed an increasing fear of racial mixture.&lt;ref&gt;Yancey, G. (2007). "Experiencing Racism: Differences in the Experiences of Whites Married to Blacks and Non-Black Racial Minorities". Journal of Comparative Family Studies. University of Calgary: Social Sciences. 38 (2): 197–213.&lt;/ref&gt;  The remnants of the racial divide became stronger post-slavery as the concept of [[Whiteness studies|whiteness]] developed. There was a widely held belief that uncontrollable lust threatens the purity of the nation.  This increased white anxiety about interracial sex, and has been described through [[Montesquieu]]'s climatic theory in his book the [[The Spirit of the Laws|Spirit of the Laws]], which explains how people from different climates have different temperaments, "The inhabitants of warm countries are, like old men, timorous; the people in cold countries are, like young men, brave."&lt;ref&gt;De Montesquieu, C. (1989). Montesquieu: The Spirit of the Laws. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, black women held the jezebel stereotype, which claimed black women often initiated sex outside of marriage and were generally sexually promiscuous.&lt;ref&gt;West, C. M. (1995). Mammy, Sapphire, and Jezebel: Historical images of Black women and their implications for psychotherapy. Psychotherapy: Theory, Research, Practice, Training, 32(3), 458.&lt;/ref&gt; This idea stemmed from the first encounters between European men and African women. As the men were not used to the extremely hot climate they misinterpreted the women's lack of clothing for vulgarity.&lt;ref&gt;White, D. B. (1999). Ar'n't I a Woman. W.W. Norton &amp; Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, black men were stereotyped for having a specific lust for white women. This created tension, as if white men were having sex with black women because they were more lustful, this meant black men would lust after white women in the same way, this threatened the white male dominance that was apparent at the time, increasing the fear of interracial interactions.

There are a few potential reasons as to why such strong ideas on interracial sex developed. The [[Reconstruction Era]] following the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] started to disassemble traditional aspects of Southern society. The Southerners who were used to being dominant were now no longer legally allowed to run their farms using slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, E. and Mahoney O. (2003). America's Reconstruction: People and Politics After the Civil War.&lt;/ref&gt; Many whites struggled with this reformation and attempted to find loopholes to continue the exploitation of black labour. Additionally, the white Democrats were not pleased with the outcome and felt a sense of inadequacy among white men. This led to them taking out their frustration on the black population. This radical reconstruction of the South was deeply unpopular and slowly unravelled leading to the introduction of the [[Jim Crow laws]].&lt;ref&gt;Kousser, J. M. (2003). Jim Crow Laws. Dictionary of American History, 4, 479-480.&lt;/ref&gt; There was an increased the sense of white dominance and sexual racism among the Southern people.

There were general heightened tensions following the end of the failed civil war in 1865, and this increased the sexual anxiety in the population. Races did not want to mix, the whites were feeling inadequate and wanted to take back control. The [[Ku Klux Klan]] then formed in 1867, which led to violence and terrorism targeting the black population.&lt;ref&gt;Wade, W. C. (1998). The Fiery Cross: The Ku Klux Klan in America. Oxford University Press, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; There was a rise in [[Lynching|lynch]] mob violence where many black men were accused of rape. This was not just senseless violence, but an attempt to preserve 'whiteness' and prevent racial blur, the whites wanted to remain dominant and make sure there was no interracial sexual activity. For example, mixed race couples that chose to live together were sought out and lynched by the KKK. The famous case of Emmett Till who was lynched at the age of fourteen for supposedly whistling at a white women shows the prominence of white male anxiety in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Whitfield, S. J. (1991). A death in the delta: The story of Emmett Till. JHU Press.&lt;/ref&gt; When the Jim Crow laws were eventually overturned, it took years for the court to resolve the numerous acts of discrimination.

==Heterosexual community==
Sexual racism exists in both the heterosexual and homosexual communities across the globe. The prevalence of interracial couples demonstrate how attitudes have changed in the last 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;Mendelsohn, G. A., Taylor, L. S., Fiore, A. T. &amp; Cheshire, C. (2014). Black/White Dating Online: Interracial Courtship in the 21st Century. Psychology of Popular Media Culture, 3, 2-18.&lt;/ref&gt; A case that has perhaps received heightened publicity is that of [[Loving v. Virginia|Mildred and Richard Loving]]. The couple lived in Virginia yet had to marry outside the state due to the [[Anti-miscegenation laws in the United States|anti-miscegenation]] laws present in nearly half of the US states in 1958. Once married, the pair returned to Virginia, and were both arrested in their home for the infringement of the [[Racial Integrity Act of 1924|Racial Integrity Act]], and each sentenced to a year in prison. Prior to the repeal of these laws in 2000, several attempts were made to void the sentence, ultimately the couple resorted to relocation to avoid further prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;Moran, R. F. (2007). Loving and the Legacy of Unintended Consequences. Wis. L. Rev, 239, 240-281.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Bill de Blasio family 2012.jpg|thumb|204x204px|[[Bill de Blasio]] and [[Chirlane McCray]] with their two children in 2012, attending a silent march.]]
Around a similar time was the controversy surrounding [[Seretse Khama|Seretse and Ruth Khama]]. Seretse was the chief of an eminent Botswanan tribe, and Ruth an English student. The pair married in 1948 but experienced frequent discrimination from the onset of the relationship, including Seretse's removal from his tribal responsibilities as chief. For nearly 10 years, Seretse and Ruth lived as exiles in Britain, as the racism towards their relationship remained strong. British officials hoped that their asylum in the country would reduce their desire to continue the marriage. Once the couple were allowed to return home in 1956, they became prominent figures the movement for racial and social justice, contributing to Seretse's election as president of Botswana in 1966. Later, they both continued to fight laws surrounding interracial marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, N. (1993). The impact of Seretse Khama on British public opinion 1948-56 and 1978. Historical Studies in Ethnicity, Migration and Diaspora, 12, 195-219.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent examples portray the increasingly accepting attitudes of the majority to interracial relationships and marriage. In 2013, [[Bill de Blasio]] was elected as Mayor of New York City, accompanied by his wife, [[Chirlane McCray]]. The pair are one of the first interracial couples to stand in power side by side. Both de Blasio and McCray are active political figures, and although they are not exempt from racial discrimination, the attitudes of the world to interracial marriage are much more positive and optimistic than in previous decades.&lt;ref&gt;Werner, D. &amp; Mahler, H. (2014). Primary health care: The Return of Health for All.

=== Online dating ===
[[File:OnLineDating World 201602.png|thumb|373x373px|Monthly visitors to different [[Online dating service|Online Dating services]] globally in February 2016]]
In the last 15 years, online dating has overtaken previously preferred methods of meeting with potential partners, surpassing both the occupational setting and area of residence as chosen locations. This spike is consistent with an increase in access to the internet in homes across the globe, in addition to the number of dating sites available to individuals differing in [[ageing|age]], [[gender]], [[race (human categorization)|race]], [[sexual orientation]] and [[Ethnic group|ethnic background]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosenfeld, M. J. &amp; Thomas, R. J. (2012). Searching for a Mate: The Rise of the Internet as a Social Intermediary. American Sociological Review, 77(4), 523-547.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with this, there has been a rise in online sexual racism, whereby partner race is now the most highly selected preference chosen by users when creating their online profiles, displacing both educational and religious characteristics.&lt;ref name="Hitsch2006"&gt;Hitsch, G. J., Hortacsu, A. &amp; Ariely, D. (2006). What makes you click? Partner preferences and matching outcomes in online dating. MIT Sloan Research Paper No. 4603-06.&lt;/ref&gt; Research has indicated a progressive acceptance of interracial relationships by White individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Schuman, H., Steeh, C., Bobo, L &amp; Krysan, M. (1997). Racial Attitudes in America: Trends and Interpretations (revised edition): Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of White Americans are not against interracial relationships and marriage,&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig, J. (2004). Acceptance of interracial marriage at record high. Retrieved from http://www.gallup.com/poll/11836/acceptance-interracial-marriage-record-high.aspx, 23.11.2016, 20:00pm.&lt;/ref&gt; however these [[belief]]s are not illustrated in subsequent marital rates between interracial couples, such that no more than 4% of White Americans will wed outside their own race.&lt;ref&gt;Qian, Z., &amp; Lichter, D. L. (2007). Social boundaries and marital assimilation: Interpreting trends in racial and ethnic intermarriage. American Sociological Review, 72, 68-94.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, less than 46% of White Americans are willing to date an individual of any other race.&lt;ref name="Yancey20092"&gt;Yancey, G. (2009). Cross-racial differences in the racial preferences of potential dating partners: A test of the alienation of African Americans and Social Dominance Orientation. The Sociology Quarterly, 50, 121-143.&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, African Americans appear to be the most open to interracial relationships,&lt;ref name="Robnett20112"&gt;Robnett, B., &amp; Feliciano, C. (2011). Patterns of racial-ethnic exclusion by internet daters. Social Forces, 89, 807-828.&lt;/ref&gt; yet are the least preferred partner by other racial groups.&lt;ref name="Yancey20092"/&gt; However, regardless of stated preferences, [[Discrimination|racial discrimination]] still occurs in online dating.&lt;ref name="Hitsch2006" /&gt;

Each group significantly prefers to date intra-racially. [[White Americans]] are the least open to interracial dating, and select preferences in the order of [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic Americans]], [[Asian Americans]] and then [[African Americans|African American]] individuals last at 60.5%, 58.5% and 49.4% respectively.&lt;ref name="Robnett20112"/&gt; African American preferences follow a similar pattern, with the most preferred partner belonging to the Hispanic group (61%), followed by White individuals (59.6%) and then Asian Americans (43.5%). Both Hispanic and Asian Americans prefer to date a White individual (80.3% and 87.3%, respectively), and both are least willing to date African Americans (56.5% and 69.5%).&lt;ref name="Yancey20092"/&gt; In all significant cases, Hispanic Americans are preferred to Asian Americans, and Asian Americans are significantly preferred over African Americans.&lt;ref name="Robnett20112" /&gt; Hispanic Americans are less likely to be excluded in online dating [[partner preferences|partner preferences]] by whites seeking a partner, as Latinos are often viewed as a racial group that is increasingly assimilating more into White American [[culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Yancey, G. (2003). Who Is White? Latinos, Asians, And the New Black/nonblack Divide: Lynne Rienner Pub.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to general racism in online dating, there is further exclusion differences between certain genders within racial groups, such that women of any race are significantly less likely to date inter-racially than a male of any race.&lt;ref&gt;Fisman, R., Sheena S. I., Emir K. &amp; Itamar S. (2006). "Gender differences in mate selection: Evidence from a speed dating experiment." Quarterly Journal of Economics, 121, 673-697.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Asian men and Black women face more obstacles to acceptance online.&lt;ref&gt;Spell, S. A. (2016). Not just black and white: how race/ethnicity and gender intersect in hookup culture. Sociology of Race and Ethnicity, 1-16.&lt;/ref&gt; White women are most likely to exclude Asian men, likely due to their amplified [[Effeminacy|effeminate]] portrayal in the media.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, E. (1986). "Asian Americans and American Popular Culture." P. 99-114 in Asian American History Dictionary, edited by R. H. Kim. New York: Greenwood Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Espiritu, Y. L. (1997).

"Lives at the centre of the periphery, lives at the periphery of the centre - Chinese American masculinities and bargaining with hegemony." Gender &amp; Society, 13, 584-607.&lt;/ref&gt; This exclusion remains present even when considering high earning Asian individuals with an advanced educational background.&lt;ref name="Robnett20112" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barringer, H. R., Takeuchi, D. T. &amp; Xenos, P. (1990). "Education, Occupational Prestige, and Income of Asian Americans." Sociology of Education, 63, 27-43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Massey, D. S. &amp; Denton, N. A. (1992). "Residential Segregation of Asian-Origin Groups in United-States Metropolitan Areas." Sociology and Social Research, 76, 170-177.&lt;/ref&gt; Increased education does however influence choices in the other direction, such that a higher level of schooling is associated with more optimistic feelings towards interracial relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Bobo, L. D. &amp; Massagli, M. P. (2001). "Stereotyping and Urban Inequality." P. 89-162 in Urban Inequality, edited by a M. P. M. Lawrence D. Bobo. New York: Russell Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; White men are most likely to exclude Black women, as opposed to women of another race. High levels of previous exposure to a variety of racial groups creates a more accepting attitude.&lt;ref&gt;Potârcă, G &amp; Mills, M. (2015). Racial preferences in online dating across European countries. European Sociological Review, 31(3), 326-341.&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual racism in online dating, in addition to the outside world, is also influenced by the partner selectors area of residence. Those residing in more Southern regions, particularly in American states, are less likely to have been in an interracial relationship, and are unlikely to inter-racially date in the future.&lt;ref name="Perry20142"&gt;Perry, S. L. (2014). Religious Socialisation and Interracial Dating: The effects of childhood religious salience, practice, and parents' tradition. Journal of Family Issues, 1-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Location is also related to the individuals current and previous religious practices; those who engaged in regular religious customs at age 12 are less likely to inter-racially date. Moreover, those from a [[Judaism|Jewish]] background are significantly more likely to enter an interracial relationship than those from a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] background, indicating differences in levels of sexual racism present, which translate into the virtual world of online dating.&lt;ref name="Perry20142" /&gt;

Currently, there are websites specifically targeted to different couple matches, such that singles can sign up online and focus on one particular partner quality, such as race, religious beliefs or ethnicity. In addition to this, there are online dating services that target race-specific partner choices, and a selection of pages dedicated to interracial dating that allow users to select partners based on age, gender and particularly race. Online dating services experience controversy in this context as debate is cast over whether statements such as "no Asians" or "not attracted to Asians" in user profiles, are racist or just signify individual preference.&lt;ref&gt;Callander, D., Newman, C. E. &amp; Holt, M. (2015). Is Sexual Racism Really Racism? Distinguishing Attitudes Toward Sexual Racism and Generic Racism Among Gay and Bisexual Men. Archives of Sexual Behaviour, 44(7), 1991-2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnic minorities who feel they lack dating prospects as a result of their race, sometimes refer to themselves as ''ethnicels''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/opinion/star-columnists/2018/05/01/the-foundational-misogyny-of-incels-overlaps-with-racism.html|title=The foundational misogyny of incels overlaps with racism - The Star|publisher=|accessdate=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Homosexual community ==
[[Asian people|Asian]] men are often represented in media, both mainstream and [[LGBT]], as being feminized and desexualized.{{sfn|Nguyen|2014}} LGBT Asian men often report sexual [[racism]] from [[white people|white]] LGBT men. The [[homosexual|gay]] [[Asian Canadians|Asian-Canadian]] author [[Richard Fung]] has written that while [[black people|black]] men are portrayed as [[sexualization|hypersexualized]], gay Asian men are portrayed as being undersexed.{{sfn|Gross|Woods|1999|pp=235–253}} Fung also wrote about feminizing depictions of Asian men in [[gay pornography]], which often focuses on gay Asian men's submission to the pleasure of white men. According to Fung, gay Asian men tend to ignore or display displeasure with races such as [[Arabs]], blacks, and other Asians but seemingly give sexual acceptance and approval to gay white men. White gay men are more frequently than other racial groups to state "No Asians" when seeking partners. In [[interracial pornography|interracial]] gay male pornography, Asian men are usually portrayed as submissive "[[Top, bottom and versatile#Bottom|bottoms]]".{{sfn|Nguyen|2004|pp=223–228}}

Asian American women also report similar discrimination in lesbian, gay, bisexual (LGB) communities. According to a study by Sung, Szymanski, and Henrichs-Beck (2015), Asian American participants who identified as lesbian or bisexual often reported invisibility, stereotyping, and fetishism in LGB circles and the larger U.S. culture. This is in addition to the heterosexism and invisibility they felt in Asian American communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sung|first=Mi Ra|last2=Szymanski|first2=Dawn M.|last3=Henrichs-Beck|first3=Christy|title=Challenges, coping, and benefits of being an Asian American lesbian or bisexual woman.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/sgd0000085|journal=Psychology of Sexual Orientation and Gender Diversity|volume=2|issue=1|pages=52–64|doi=10.1037/sgd0000085}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Racial sexism is also prevalent in gay online dating. Phua and Kaufman (2003) noted that men seeking men online were more likely than men seeking women to look at racial traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phua|first=Voon C.|last2=Kaufman|first2=Gayle|title=The Crossroads of Race and Sexuality: Date Selection among Men in Internet "Personal" Ads|url=http://www.ingentaselect.com/rpsv/cgi-bin/cgi?ini=xref&amp;body=linker&amp;reqdoi=10.1177/0192513X03256607|journal=Journal of Family Issues|volume=24|issue=8|pages=981–994|doi=10.1177/0192513x03256607}}&lt;/ref&gt; Race is often used to advertise oneself or as a criterion in seeking a partner, according to a study looking at Manhunt profiles. In Callander, Newman, and Holt's (2012) study, White participants self-disclosed their racial identity less often than non-White participants, with the implication that Whiteness was the norm and non-Whites expected to self-disclose their racial identity. They cite one profile description as an example: "I shouldn't have to ask for a picture, or your age, or your ethnicity. Have it available straight away or I'll just pass over your profile."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Callander|first=Denton|last2=Holt|first2=Martin|last3=Newman|first3=Christy E.|date=2012-10-01|title=Just a preference: racialised language in the sex-seeking profiles of gay and bisexual men|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13691058.2012.714799|journal=Culture, Health &amp; Sexuality|volume=14|issue=9|pages=1049–1063|doi=10.1080/13691058.2012.714799|issn=1369-1058|pmid=22943583}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a qualitative study conducted by Paul, Ayala, and Choi (2010) with Asian and Pacific Islanders (API), Latino, and African American men seeking men, participants interviewed endorsed racial preference as a common criteria in online dating partner selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paul|first=Jay P.|last2=Ayala|first2=George|last3=Choi|first3=Kyung-Hee|date=2010-11-02|title=Internet Sex Ads for MSM and Partner Selection Criteria: The Potency of Race/Ethnicity Online|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00224490903244575|journal=The Journal of Sex Research|volume=47|issue=6|pages=528–538|doi=10.1080/00224490903244575|issn=0022-4499|pmc=3065858|pmid=21322176}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reflects the racist power hierarchies often seen in broader spheres of society where Eurocentric discourses are often the standard, and non-Eurocentric discourses are the exceptions.

In another study by Callander, Newman, and Holts, researchers found that attitudes towards sexual racism was often tolerated, with many participants feeling that racial preference was not racism.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Callander|first=Denton|last2=Newman|first2=Christy E.|last3=Holt|first3=Martin|date=2015-07-07|title=Is Sexual Racism Really Racism? Distinguishing Attitudes Toward Sexual Racism and Generic Racism Among Gay and Bisexual Men|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-015-0487-3|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|language=en|volume=44|issue=7|pages=1991–2000|doi=10.1007/s10508-015-0487-3|issn=0004-0002}}&lt;/ref&gt; They quoted Watts from the Huffington Post, who argued that sexual attraction and racism are not the same:
{{quote|Just because someone isn't sexually attracted to someone of Asian origin does not mean they wouldn't want to work, live next to, or socialize with him or her, or that they believe they are somehow naturally superior to them.|as cited in Callander, Newman, &amp; Holts, 2015, p. 1992}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/laurence-watts/gay-racism_b_1307819.html|title=Gay Men And Women Are Not More Racist|last=Author|first=Laurence Watts|last2=News|first2=Features Writer for Pink|date=2012-02-29|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This suggests that people find it possible to view larger systemic racial preference as problematic, while viewing racial preferences in romantic or sexual personal relationships as not problematic. Researchers noted that there is a general hesitation to call racial preference "racist", with many defending racial preference as saving time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In that same study,  researchers found that attitudes towards sexual racism were similar to attitudes about generic racism. That is, patterns of sexual racism seems to follow similar patterns of general racism. For example, they found that higher levels of education was associated with more positive attitudes about multiculturalism and less positive attitudes about racial sexism. They also found that experiences of exclusion online due to race was correlated with more accepting views of multiculturalism and less accepting attitudes about sexual racism, regardless of racial identity. These findings suggest that being more aware of racism in general, due to experience or education, and racism's impact had an effect on racial preference such that it was seen as less desirable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Fetishisation ==
[[File:Asian woman tied in red rope.png|thumb|Asian woman tied in red rope from the [[Folsom Street Fair]] 2007]]
As well as race-based sexual rejection, sexual racism also manifests in the form of the hypersexualisation of specific ethnic groups. Freudians theorize that [[sexual fetishism]], people of one race can form sexual fixations towards individuals of a separate generalised racial group. This collective [[Racial stereotype|stereotype]] is established through the perception that an individual's sexual appeal derives entirely from their race, and is therefore subject to the [[prejudice]]s that follow.

Racial fetishism as a culture is often perceived, in this context, as an act or belief motivated by sexual racism. The objectification and reductionist perception of different races, for example, East Asian women, or African American men, relies greatly on their portrayal in forms of media that depict them as sexual objects. An example of such a medium includes [[pornography]]. An instance of this hypersexualisation is commented upon in Artist and Designer Donna Choi's illustrative series targeting the specific fetishisation of Asian women, named, ''Does Your Man Suffer From Yellow Fever?'' (2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.donnachoi.com/work/yellow-fever.html|title=Does Your Man Suffer From Yellow Fever? {{!}} Donna Choi|website=www.donnachoi.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In said illustration, Choi uses satire to depict a white man's harmful perception of a "[[Asian stereotypes|china doll stereotype]]" towards Asian woman and how she is an object to his desires. Choi's intention comes across through implying the presence of an obvious dehumanisation of Asian women in the eyes of another race. This is a deliberate commentary on the fetishisation rooted within the social issue of sexual racism.{{Third-party inline|date=May 2017}}

The effects of Racial Fetishism as a form of Sexual Racism, is discussed in research conducted by Plummer.&lt;ref&gt;Plummer, M. D. (2008). Sexual racism in gay communities: Negotiating the ethnosexual marketplace.&lt;/ref&gt; Plummer used qualitative interviews within given focus groups, and found that specific social locations came up as areas in which sexual racism commonly manifest. These mentioned social locations included pornographic media, gay clubs and bars, [[Casual sex|casual sex encounters]] as well as [[romantic relationship]]s. This high prevalence was recorded within Plummer's research to be consequentially related to the recorded lower self-esteem, internalised sexual racism, and increased psychological distress in participants of colour. People subject to this form of racial discernment are targeted in a manner well put by Hook.&lt;ref&gt;Hook, D. (2005). The racial stereotype, colonial discourse, fetishism, and racism. Psychoanalytic Review, 92(5), 702-734.&lt;/ref&gt; Hook's historical overview of [[J.M. Coetzee|J.M. Coetzee's]] novel, largely addressed Coetzee's depictions of racial otherness within South Africa. Additionally, Coetzee goes on to write about how the otherness and social detachment from the colonials was what fabricated present racial stereotypes. Such stereotypes are what is said to encourage the perception of other racial groups as ''fantasmatic objects''; a degrading and generalising view of different racial populations.

Slaughter''', is an [[United States|American]] retired [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] currently signed in [[WWE]] in the ambassador program.&lt;ref name=Ambassador&gt;{{cite web|last=Cadwell|first=James|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/WWE_News_3/article_77782.shtml |title=WWE NEWS: Raw script leak - several roster updates, including injuries, time off, heel or face?, Zayn call-up?, more|accessdate=2014-09-28|date=2014-04-16|publisher=PWTorch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the late 1970s to the early 1980s, Slaughter had success in the [[National Wrestling Alliance]], [[American Wrestling Association]], and the [[World Wrestling Federation]]. He won the [[WWE Championship|WWF World Heavyweight Championship]], and headlined [[WrestleMania VII]], in 1991. Slaughter also captured the [[WWE United States Championship|NWA United States Heavyweight Championship]] twice. He is a [[WWE Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]], inducted as part of the class of 2004. As Sgt. Slaughter, Remus became known for his dark [[sunglasses]], his large hat, and his Vietnam War–era military [[Battledress|fatigues]]. In the 1980s, an [[Sgt. Slaughter (G.I. Joe)|alternate version of the Sgt. Slaughter character]] was incorporated into the ''[[G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero]]'' toy line as well as its [[G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero (1985 TV series)|animated series]] and [[G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero (Marvel Comics)|comic books]].

Though Remus was born in Detroit, Michigan, he was raised in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where he attended Eden Prairie High School in [[Eden Prairie, Minnesota|Eden Prairie]], where he wrestled and played football. Remus [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#L|legitimately]] enlisted in the [[United States Marine Corps]], and was a [[drill instructor]] at [[Parris Island, South Carolina]], prior to his professional wrestling career.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, Michael, [http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/06/24/cereal-liars-capn-crunch-and-9-other-fake-military-titles/photo/celebrities-visit-the-2012-washington-auto-show-2/ "Cereal Liars?: Cap'n Crunch and 9 Other Fake Military Titles"], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', June 24, 2013. Accessed 08-22-2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Professional wrestling career ==
=== NWA and AWA (1972-1980) ===
Sgt. Slaughter held numerous regional titles early in his career and experienced his first major success in the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA) capturing the [[WCW World Tag Team Championship|NWA World Tag Team Championship]] with [[Don Kernodle]] in 1982. During the late 1970s, Remus worked the [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA) territory under a mask as '''Super Destroyer Mark II''' with manager [[Alfred Hayes (wrestler)|Lord Alfred Hayes]], whom he dismissed and replaced with [[Bobby Heenan]], leading to a feud between the two managers with Hayes as the babyface.

=== World Wrestling Federation (1980–1981) ===
He then signed with the WWF and was pushed as a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villainous character]]. Between 1980 and 1981, Slaughter wrestled in the WWF under the guidance of the [[Ernie Roth|Grand Wizard]].  He quickly rose to the status of number one contender on the strength of his "cobra clutch" challenges where he would seat wrestlers in a chair in the ring, and apply the hold, offering [[United States dollar|$]]5,000 to anyone who could break it.  He would eventually face [[Bob Backlund]] for the World Wrestling Federation Heavyweight Championship across the WWF territory in 1980, earning two-or-three main event matches in most markets.  Slaughter was the only WWF-based challenger not to do the honors for Backlund at MSG (Backlund defeated him at the Meadowlands, but never in the Garden).  Slaughter then engaged in a feud with [[Pat Patterson (wrestler)|Pat Patterson]], which stemmed from Slaughter calling Patterson "yellow" and offering him $10,000 (double the usual amount) to try to break the cobra clutch.  Patterson accepted on television and was escaping from the hold when Slaughter released it and put a beat-down on Patterson, starting a hot feud which culminated in an "[[Professional wrestling match types#Hardcore-based variations|Alley Fight]]" in [[New York City|New York, New York]]'s [[Madison Square Garden]] between the two that is widely regarded as the best "hardcore" match of the Kayfabe era.

=== National Wrestling Alliance (1981–1983) ===
In September 1981, Slaughter joined the National Wrestling Alliance, mainly wrestling for its Mid-Atlantic territory. In October 1981, he took part in a tournament to determine a new [[WWE United States Championship|NWA United States Heavyweight Champion]]; he defeated [[Johnny Weaver]], [[Jay Youngblood]], and [[Ricky Steamboat]] in the tournament to win the vacant title. He would hold onto the title for over seven months, before losing the title to [[Wahoo McDaniel]] in May 1982.

In September 1982, Slaughter and partner [[Don Kernodle]] were awarded the [[WCW World Tag Team Championship|NWA World Tag Team Championship]], claiming a title victory over [[Antonio Inoki]] and [[Giant Baba]] in Tokyo. They would be in a heated rivalry with the team of Ricky Steamboat and Jay Youngblood, which culminated in March 1983, losing the titles to Steamboat and Youngblood in a steel cage match. After the rivalry ended, Slaughter left the NWA.

=== First return to the WWF (1983–1985) ===
Slaughter returned to the WWF in March 1983, and again took on the Grand Wizard as his manager. He immediately targeted Backlund, who was still the reigning WWF World Heavyweight Champion. Slaughter turned up the feud another notch when he attacked Backlund at a television taping; Backlund was in the process of completing the Harvard Step Test before Slaughter beat him repeatedly with his riding crop, leaving bruises on his back. Although he won several matches by disqualification, Slaughter was never able to win the title from Backlund.

In early 1984, Slaughter's career took off after he turned face and defended America's honor against the hated [[The Iron Sheik|Iron Sheik]]. Slaughter and the Iron Sheik engaged in many matches throughout the year, culminating in a boot camp match which took place before a sold out Madison Square Garden that summer. However, with the emergence of [[Hulk Hogan]] as the WWF World Heavyweight Champion and lead face within the company, Slaughter left for the AWA. On [[Vince McMahon]]'s ''[[Vince McMahon#Other media|McMahon DVD]],'' Slaughter said he was fired by McMahon in Toronto after no-showing an event in protest of McMahon's refusal to give him six weeks of paid vacation. Other interviews with Slaughter and McMahon have revealed that Slaughter left the company more over a dispute that emerged due to the WWF not allowing Slaughter's role in the G.I. Joe toy line. At the time of his departure Slaughter was easily the second biggest "face" in the company, surpassing [[Jimmy Snuka]], and even [[André the Giant]], with his popularity rivaling that of Hulk Hogan's.

=== American Wrestling Association (1985–1990) ===
He received a considerable push in the [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA) throughout 1985 and 1986, becoming the [[AWA America's Championship|AWA America's Heavyweight Champion]],  defeating [[Larry Zbyszko]] shortly after his arrival. He defended the title against wrestlers like Zbyszko, [[Kamala (wrestler)|Kamala]], [[Boris Zukhov]], and [[Nick Bockwinkel]] (before the belt was retired) and feuded with Sheik [[Adnan Al-Kaissie|Adnan Al-Kaissey]] and his stable of wrestlers, [[The Road Warriors]], and [[Colonel DeBeers]]. He even challenged [[Stan Hansen]] for the AWA title. He was also involved in the short lived Pro Wrestling USA Promotion. This was a brief attempt at pulling together the remaining wrestling talent to go up against the rising WWF. Slaughter in this company won a large 25 man battle royal by eliminating Kamala, winning the right to challenge [[Ric Flair]] for the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]].

In 1988, Slaughter returned to wrestling in the AWA, resuming some of his past feuds with the likes of Sheik Adnan Al-Kaissey, the Iron Sheik, and Col. DeBeers. He also became a top contender to the AWA World title during [[Larry Zbyszko]]'s reign in 1989 and was a team captain for the AWA's ill-fated Team Challenge Series during the first half of 1990. The AWA even teased fans with Slaughter appearing to win the World title from Zbyszko live on [[ESPN]], only to have the decision reversed on a technicality (a booking practice the AWA had been employing for years).

=== Second return to the WWF===

==== Iraqi sympathizer (1990–1991) ====
[[File:Wwe wrestler sgt slaughter.jpg|thumb|right|Sgt. Slaughter]]
After [[WrestleMania VI]], Slaughter sent a letter to [[Vince McMahon]] saying he loved the program and was interested in returning. McMahon told Slaughter he wanted a heel, and his new [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] would be that Slaughter turned on the United States due to its acceptance of the Russian [[Nikolai Volkoff]]. According to Slaughter, he found it difficult to do the anti-American promos associated with this gimmick.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The August 1990 [[invasion of Kuwait]] by [[Ba'athist Iraq]] triggered a political crisis that would lead to the 1991 [[Gulf War]], in which Kuwait was freed by [[Coalition of the Gulf War|a U.S.-led military coalition]]. A decision was made to have Slaughter support the Iraqi cause, not for the actual political reasons, but more for the fact that Slaughter liked "brutality" and the Iraqi government was "brutal" while the US regime was said by Slaughter to have become "soft" and "weak". Slaughter aligned himself with a [[kayfabe]] Iraqi military general, [[Adnan Al-Kaissie|General Adnan]] (his old rival who left the AWA shortly after Slaughter did), and entered a feud with Volkoff (which saw Slaughter win the majority of their encounters at [[house show]]s), leading to a match at that year's [[Survivor Series (1990)|Survivor Series]] which saw The Alliance (Volkoff, [[Tito Santana]], and [[The Bushwhackers]]) defeat The Mercenaries (Slaughter, Boris Zhukov, and [[The Orient Express]]). As part of his character change, Slaughter began wearing Arab headdresses to the ring, adopted the Camel Clutch as one of his finishers, and was (kayfabe) photographed meeting with [[Saddam Hussein]]. Slaughter also infamously adopted a move where he would grind the tip of one of his knuckles into his opponent's temple (the childhood [[List of school pranks#Noogie|noogie]]). It was reported that while Slaughter was portraying a [[turncoat]], he had received numerous death threats and could not go anywhere in public without wearing a bullet-proof vest and had to be surrounded with security personnel at all times. According to Slaughter, Vince asked him to burn the American flag, but Slaughter refused to, so Slaughter suggested he burn Hulk Hogan's shirt.

As 1990 ended, Slaughter began challenging for the [[WWE World Championship|WWF World Heavyweight Championship]] that had been held by [[The Ultimate Warrior]] since WrestleMania VI. Slaughter got his chance at the [[Royal Rumble (1991)|Royal Rumble]] in January 1991, days after the [[Gulf War air campaign]] had begun. He defeated the Warrior when [[Randy Savage|"Macho King" Randy Savage]], who had also been feuding with the Warrior at the time, struck the champion in the head with his royal scepter. Slaughter thus became the thirteenth [[List of WWE World Champions|WWF World Heavyweight Champion]] and was immediately challenged by Royal Rumble winner [[Hulk Hogan]], who was furious that Slaughter had (kayfabe) desecrated the American flag (off-screen) as part of his victory celebration. Hogan demanded a match against Slaughter at [[WrestleMania VII]] in [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]], and Slaughter accepted. Slaughter was defeated by Hogan, thus losing his championship. After WrestleMania Slaughter introduced his newest ally, Colonel Mustafa (The Iron Sheik, Slaughter's old nemesis). Slaughter and company went on to feud with Hogan for months, including having a three-on-two handicap match at [[SummerSlam (1991)|SummerSlam 1991]], which saw the team of Hulk Hogan and the Ultimate Warrior prevail over Slaughter, Adnan, and Mustafa.

==== Various feuds (1991-1994) ====
After finishing the Hogan [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]], Slaughter became a [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]] again, appearing in [[Vignette (literature)|vignettes]] next to American landmarks, saying, "I want my country back".&lt;ref name=Legends&gt;{{cite book|title=WWE Legends|last=Solomon|first=Brian|pages=83–88|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7434-9033-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; During an episode of ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|Superstars]]'', [[Jim Duggan]] was under attack from [[The Nasty Boys]], and Slaughter made the save. Duggan and Slaughter teamed up to defeat the Nasty Boys and continued to team over the next several months. Slaughter's last regular WWF match, which was against [[Kevin Wacholz|Nailz]], was in October 1992 and ended in no contest when Nailz viciously attacked Slaughter before the match could begin.

Slaughter started appearing as an on-air official from October 1992 to June 1994. He made his first wrestling appearance in over a year when he appeared on a house show version of a Royal Rumble that was held on January 17, 1994 at Madison Square Garden. After helping to eliminate Adam Bomb he in turn was tossed out by Crush. Later that year he would later wrestle on four house shows in July in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, facing and defeating [[Quebecer Pierre]]. He left the company in September.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/93.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==== WWF Commissioner and sporadic appearances (1997–2001) ====
After a hiatus, he returned to WWF television on the August 4, 1997 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw Is War]]'' to assume the role of on-air [[Professional wrestling authority figures#Commissioners|commissioner]] by ([[kayfabe]]) President [[Gorilla Monsoon]] who in reality retired from being on camera due to health issues. Initially popular, he eventually became the target of [[D-Generation X]], who called him "Sgt. Slobber". On an episode of ''Raw Is War'', he put [[Shawn Michaels]] and [[Triple H]] in a match for Michaels' [[WWE European Championship|European Championship]]. Michaels dropped the belt to Helmsley, by lying down in the ring. Slaughter challenged Triple H to a [[Professional wrestling match types#No Disqualification match|Boot Camp match]] at the [[D-Generation X: In Your House|December pay-per-view]], which he lost. His feud with Triple H continued into [[WrestleMania XIV]] where he handcuffed himself to [[Chyna]] to prevent her from interfering with Helmsley's match against [[Owen Hart]]. But Slaughter's efforts ultimately proved futile, as Chyna threw powder into his eyes, interfered with the match anyway, and hurled Slaughter into the front row.

In 1998, Slaughter turned heel, joined [[Vince McMahon]] along with [[Gerald Brisco]] and [[Pat Patterson (wrestler)|Pat Patterson]], and became the on-screen lackeys of McMahon; running errands for him and dishing out punishment to McMahon's rivals, namely [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]]. In late 1998, Slaughter relinquished the role of commissioner to Shawn Michaels and largely disappeared from television.

Slaughter still appeared from time to time in the ring, mostly at [[house show]]s. He appeared on ''Raw'' to put over younger wrestlers, such as [[Kurt Angle]] and [[Randy Orton]]. Slaughter also made an appearance at [[WrestleMania X-Seven]], in the [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|Battle Royal]], which was won by The Iron Sheik. Slaughter got his revenge after the match by locking the Sheik in the [[Professional wrestling holds#Cobra clutch|cobra clutch]]. He also appeared on both ''Raw'' and ''SmackDown'' on occasion during [[The Invasion (professional wrestling)|the Invasion]] storyline in non-wrestling roles, usually in conjunction with Vince McMahon.

=== Third return to WWE (2005–present) ===
[[File:Sgt. Slaughter in April 09.jpg|thumb|Slaughter in a 2009 match without his trademark hat and glasses]]
He made a special appearance on June 13, 2005 episode of ''Raw'' to challenge [[Chris Masters]] in his "[[Nelson hold|Master Lock Challenge]]", which Slaughter lost. Then, he returned again on December 5 episode of ''Raw'', where he and [[Michael Hayes (wrestler)|Michael Hayes]] confronted [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]]. He also appeared on the July 4, 2006 episode of ''Raw'' for a "Diva Boot Camp" segment, as a part of the [[WWE Diva Search#2006|2006 Diva Search]] Competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/07142006/articles/divabootcamp|title=Sgt. Slaughter runs the Diva Boot Camp on SmackDown|publisher=[[WWE]]|last=Zeigler|first=Zack|date=2006-07-14|accessdate=2011-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He re-appeared on October 2 episode of ''Raw'', defeating [[Dolph Ziggler|Nicky]] from the [[Spirit Squad]] with a roll-up when [[D-Generation X]] distracted him from up on the TitanTron. Slaughter appeared on the October 23 ''Raw'' in the corner of [[Ric Flair]] as he faced [[Kenny Dykstra|Kenny]] of the Spirit Squad. After Kenny cheated to gain the victory, Slaughter, [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]], and [[Roddy Piper]] cleared the tag champions from the ring. Slaughter was one of three options between himself, Roddy Piper, and Dusty Rhodes that fans could vote for as a tag partner for Ric Flair at ''[[Cyber Sunday (2006)|Cyber Sunday]]'', but did not win the vote. At ''[[Survivor Series (2006)|Survivor Series]]'', Slaughter teamed with Flair, [[Ron Simmons]], and Dusty Rhodes to take on four members of the Spirit Squad in a Survivor Series match. Slaughter was eliminated in the match, but his team won, with Flair as the sole survivor.

On December 18, 2006, Slaughter participated in a 30-man battle royal for a chance to face [[John Cena]] in the main event for the [[WWE World Championship|WWE Championship]], but he was eliminated from the match and did not get the title shot. At the [[Vengeance: Night of Champions]] pay-per-view in June 2007, he faced [[Deuce 'n Domino]] for the [[WWE Raw Tag Team Championship|WWE Tag Team Championship]], alongside [[Jimmy Snuka]]. They were unsuccessful in their attempt for the titles. He challenged [[Randy Orton]] on July 30 episode of ''Raw'', only to become another victim of the "Legend Killer", and was wheeled out on a stretcher. On ''Raw XV'', the 15th-anniversary ''Raw'' special on December 10, 2007, Slaughter participated in the 15th Anniversary Battle Royal. On March 31, 2008, on an episode of ''Raw'', Slaughter paid tribute to longtime friend Ric Flair at the end of the show. He appeared on ''Raw'''s 800th episode in [[Shoichi Funaki|Kung Fu Naki's]] dance off and also made an appearance in the Slammy Awards.

Slaughter, who had been working as a producer for WWE for the past several years, was released from his backstage producer duties with the company on January 13, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwnewsnow.com/index.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1231900943&amp;archive=&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=6&amp;|title=Sgt. Slaughter &amp; Ron Simmons Released From WWE|date=2009-01-13|accessdate=2009-01-18|publisher= PWNewsNow.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the special guest host on ''Raw'' on August 10, 2009 where he made fun of Canadians and saying how the USA is the greatest country in the world. He made an appearance on the ''Decade of SmackDown'' on October 2, 2009 where he had an altercation with the Iron Sheik about which country was the greatest, USA or Iran. He later appeared on December 31, 2012 edition of ''Raw'', where he was challenged by then United States Champion [[Antonio Cesaro]] in a match for the [[WWE United States Championship]]. He lost the match and failed to capture the title. He then made an appearance on Old School RAW, serving as the special guest referee for The Great Khali vs Damien Sandow match after he got the most votes.

Slaughter made an appearance on November 24, 2014 edition of ''Raw'', where he confronted United States Champion [[Alexander Rusev|Rusev]] and his valet, [[Lana (wrestling)|Lana]], and attempted to force Lana and Rusev to recite the [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]] (with the alternative, per an edict from [[Daniel Bryan]], who was running the show that night, being that he would be forced to defend his title against the entire ''Raw'' roster). Rusev refused and had a stare down with Slaughter, who wouldn't back down; however, [[Jack Swagger]] and his manager, [[Zeb Colter]], ran down to the ring and fended Rusev off. Swagger, Colter, and Slaughter then finished reciting the Pledge of Allegiance.
Slaughter returned at the ''[[WWE Tribute to the Troops#2014|Tribute to the Troops]]'' show on December 17, 2014 and helped [[Dean Ambrose]] beat [[Bray Wyatt]] by giving Dean his steel-toe boot to use on Wyatt.

== Other media ==
Slaughter voices an adult version of himself in the animated WWE Network Exclusive show ''[[Camp WWE]]''.

Fictionalized versions of Sgt. Slaughter were part of the ''[[G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero]]'' toyline, cartoon and comic books, as a member of the ''G.I. Joe'' team and first appeared in the five-part TV episode entitled "Arise, Serpentor, Arise!" Along with the traditional merchandising of WWE superstars, Sgt. Slaughter is one of only a few [[List of G.I. Joe action figures modeled after real persons|real people to be immortalized as a ''G.I. Joe'' figure]], (among the others being [[National Football League|NFL]] football player [[William Perry (American football)|William "The Refrigerator" Perry]], pro-wrestler [[Roddy Piper]], and [[astronaut]] [[Buzz Aldrin]]), and even appeared in ''[[G.I. Joe: The Movie]]''.

Slaughter also appeared twice as a special guest on ''[[The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!]]'', which starred fellow wrestler [[Lou Albano|Captain Lou Albano]]. Sgt. Slaughter appeared in 2 episodes of the Super Mario Brother Super Show (1989-1990).  Sgt Slaughter played himself in the Mario Bros Plumbing live action skits before and after the cartoon with Captain Lou Albano (Mario) and Danny Wells (Luigi).  He appeared in the episodes "All Steamed Up" and "Caught in a draft".

During the mid-1980s, Sgt. Slaughter released a full-length LP, ''Sgt. Slaughter and Camouflage Rocks America''. It featured a number of original songs, including "The Cobra Clutch," as well as a cover of [[Neil Diamond]]'s "America".

A brief cross promotional stint in the late 1980s had Sgt. Slaughter and his "battling battalion" pit against the Big Foot Monster Truck in a tug-of-war challenge. It is featured on Blood, Sweat, &amp; Gears USHRA home video. This stunt was recently attempted again with Sgt. Slaughter using fans from the crowd at a Monster Truck show to tug-o-war with the Bear Foot Monster Truck.

In the animated series ''[[Code Monkeys]]'', Slaughter appeared as Sgt. Murder. He and Bulk Brogan ([[Hulk Hogan]]), "Manly Man" Ricky Ravage ([[Randy Savage|Randy "Macho Man" Savage]]), and Sergei the Giant ([[André the Giant]]) were hired by a video game company to take on their rivals. His brother, Tommy Murder, was killed by "The Black Shadow", who was actually Black Steve, the company's accountant.

He appeared on episode #3.6 of [[Comedy Central]]'s ''[[Tosh.0]]'', when he clotheslined [[Daniel Tosh]] and put David Wills (a.k.a. YouTube's "Crying Wrestling Fan") in a Cobra Clutch during Wills' "Web Redemption" segment.

In 2014, Sgt. Slaughter made a cameo appearance in the [[RadioShack]] [[Super Bowl XLVIII]] commercial "[[The '80s Called]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://people.com/tv/radioshack-super-bowl-commercial-every-80s-reference-in-the-ad-spot/ |title=Celebrating Every '80s Reference in That RadioShack Super Bowl Commercial |author=Jones, Nate |publisher=''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' |date=2 February 2014 |accessdate=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Single-letter second-level domains''' are [[domain name]]s in which the [[second-level domain]] consists of only one letter, such as x.com. In 1993, the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA) explicitly reserved all single-letter and single-digit second-level domain names in the [[top-level domain]]s [[.com|com]], [[.net|net]], and [[.org|org]], and [[Grandfather clause|grandfathered]] those that had already been assigned. In December 2005, [[ICANN]] considered auctioning these domains.

==Active single-letter domains==
On December 1, 1993, the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA) explicitly reserved the remaining single-letter and single-digit domain names. The few domains that were already assigned were grandfathered in and continued to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite IETF &lt;!-- |title=Domain Name System (DNS) IANA Considerations --&gt; |draft=draft-ietf-dnsind-iana-dns-01 |page=15 |author1=Bill Manning |author2=Eric Brunner |author3=Donald Eastlake |date=March 2000 |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=March 2014}}

The assigned domains in this group are the following:

Many other single-letter second-level domains have been registered under [[country code top-level domains]]. The list of Country code top-level domains which have been identified to allow single-letter domains are : .ac .af .ag .ai .am .bo .by .bz .cm .cn .co .cr .cz .cx .dj .de .dk .fm .gd .gg .gl .gp .gs .gt .gy .hn .ht .ie.&lt;ref&gt;One and Two Letter .IE Domains Now Available ''[https://shortdomains.ie/#one-two-letter-ie-domains "The release of short .ie domain names "] Dublin, 12 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt; im .io .je .kg .ki .kw .la .lb .lc .ly .md .mg .mk .mp .ms .mw .mx .mu .nf .nz .pe .ph .pk .pl .pn .pr .pw .ro .sh .st .tc .tl .tt .to .tv .ua .ws .vc .vg .vn and .vu.&lt;ref&gt;Hofman Laursen, Christopher ''[http://www.europeandomaincentre.com/pages/news-room/domain-management-news/the-world-s-shortest-domain-names-how-to-get-a-one-character-domain The World's Shortest Domain Names: How To Get a One Character Domain]'', Copenhagen, 01 December 2014. Retrieved on 04 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Single-character non-[[ASCII]] second-level domains also exist (as seen below), also known as [[Internationalized domain names]] (IDN), these domains are actually registered as their [[Punycode]] translations (which are more than a single character) for [[Domain Name System|DNS]] purposes.

==Project94==
In 2012, the Public Interest Registry (PIR) initiated ''Project94'', in which 94 one- and two-letter domains in the top-level domain ''org'', that had been traditionally reserved, are awarded to qualifying organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.project94.org/ Project 94]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Two-letter domain names==
{{Cleanup list|section|date=February 2014}}
Two-letter [[second-level domain]] names under the new [[generic top-level domain]]s are viewed as a potential source of confusion with [[country code top-level domain]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and must be reserved, according to the &lt;abbr&gt;gTLD&lt;/abbr&gt; Registry Agreement, pending agreement on a process for releasing them after appropriate measures have been taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icann.org/resources/two-character-labels/background-authorization-process|title=Two Character SLDs - ICANN|website=www.icann.org|access-date=2016-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two-letter .com domain names were never reserved. It was possible for anyone to register them in the very early years of the Internet (from 1985 to 1998). The first company to own an active two-letter domain was [[Hewlett-Packard]]. Since 1998 all permutations of the 26 × 26 = 676 .com domains have been registered and (barring the very unlikely event of a lapse in registration) they can only be obtained by buying them from the previous owner. In 1997 [[American Airlines]] was the first company to buy a two-letter domain (AA.com) on the secondary market, followed in 1998 by [[H&amp;M|Hennes &amp; Mauritz]] (HM.com) and [[Deutsche Bank]] (DB.com).&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwwvb.com/2 Two Letter .coms Activation Timeline]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Market value of single- or two-letter domains==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2015}}
Only three of the 26 possible single-letter domains have ever been registered in the .com domain extension, all before 1992. The other 23 single-letter .com domains were registered January 1, 1992 by [[Jon Postel]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ICANN Establishes Forum on Allocation Methods for Single-Letter and Single-Digit Domain Names|url=https://www.icann.org/news/announcement-2007-10-16-en|website=www.icann.org|publisher=ICANN|accessdate=15 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, with the intention to avoid a single company commercially controlling a letter of the Alphabet. 
Many but not all .com two-letter domains are among the most valuable domains.

While it is widely believed that the domains [[business.com]] and [[sex.com]] have been the most valuable domain transactions, prominent two-letter domains have only been sold after nondisclosed transactions handled by specialized broker and law firms.

The value of the [[LG Corp]] (the South Korean electronics conglomerate formerly known as Lucky Goldstar) purchase of LG.com was never published. LG Group missed the first sale of the domain in 2008 from the original owner the chemical company [[Lockwood Greene]] to the dot-com entrepreneur Andy Booth; Booth had used it to launch a footballing website known as LifeGames. LG Corp bought "lg.com" one year later, in 2009. Following the purchase, LG Group changed worldwide marketing to LG.com, which is now their central internet address for all countries. All national LG country domains like "LG.de" or "LG.com.mx" redirect to "LG.com".

The value of the initially secret November 2010 [[Facebook]] purchase of FB.com was revealed two months later to be $8.5 million in cash and the rest in stocks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/facebook-paid-8-5-million-for-fb-com/332105 Transaction of the FB.com domain]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[IG Group]] paid $4.7 million in September 2013 to buy IG.com &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://morganlinton.com/ig-com-sells-for-4-7-million/|title=IG.com sells for $4.7 Million|work=morganlinton.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the 2005 announcement that registration of the remaining single-letter names might become available, some companies have attempted to establish a right to the names by claiming trademark rights over single letters used in such a context.  ''U'' magazine, a college oriented publication, went so far as to re-brand its website as "U.com" and apply for a trademark registration of the same phrase, before sending a letter to ICANN attempting to gain priority for the domain if it should ever become available in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icann.org/correspondence/martens-to-jeffrey-12dec05.pdf|format=PDF|title=U.com letter|work=icann.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Slovenian Albums Chart''' SLO Top 30 is the official chart of music albums based on sales in [[Slovenia]]. The chart composes national as well as international music albums and compilations. The highest grossing album of 2012 was [[21 (Adele album)|21]] by [[Adele]]. The SLO Top 30 Chart is the only official music chart in Slovenia based on sales. Due to Slovenia's small market, the country does not have its own official Singles Chart, but has a variety of Radio Charts and Playlist Charts. The SLO Top 30 is updated weekly, on Thursdays on http://www.val202.si/slotop30/, as well as on the [[Val 202]] Radio and Vikend magazine on Fridays.

The chronicle was translated from [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and published with notes in 1889, by the respected historian, [[Martin Hume]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite NIE |title=Hume, Martin Andrew Sharp |volume=X |page=310 |url=https://archive.org/stream/newinternational10gilm#page/310/mode/2up }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hume appears to have regarded the work as an authentic contemporary document from the 16th century that related an eyewitness' account of various events in the Tudor period. [[Alison Weir]], in ''[[The Six Wives of Henry VIII (book)|The Six Wives of Henry VIII]]'', notes that the Spanish Chronicle is "notoriously inaccurate".{{sfn|Weir|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=M1yHXitDdyQC&amp;pg=315#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 315]}}

'''Tate Britain''' (known from 1897 to 1932 as the '''National Gallery of British Art''' and from 1932 to 2000 as the '''Tate Gallery''') is an art museum on [[Millbank]] in the [[City of Westminster]] in London. It is part of the [[Tate Gallery|Tate]] network of galleries in England, with [[Tate Modern]], [[Tate Liverpool]] and [[Tate St Ives]]. It is the oldest gallery in the network, having opened in 1897. It houses a substantial collection of the [[art of the United Kingdom]] since Tudor times, and in particular has large holdings of the works of [[J. M. W. Turner]], who bequeathed all his own collection to the nation. It is one of the [[list of largest art museums in the world|largest]] museums in the country.

==History==
The gallery is situated on [[Millbank]], on the site of the former [[Millbank Prison]]. Construction, undertaken by [[Higgs and Hill]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=49753 'General introduction', Survey of London: volume 26: Lambeth: Southern area (1956), pp. 1–17.] Date accessed: 27 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; commenced in 1893, and the gallery opened on 21 July 1897 as the National Gallery of British Art. However, from the start it was commonly known as the Tate Gallery, after its founder [[Sir Henry Tate]], and in 1932 it officially adopted that name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/about/who-we-are/history-of-tate#gallery Tate: ''History of Tate – The gallery at Millbank, London''] Linked 15 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Before 2000, the gallery housed and displayed both British and modern collections, but the launch of [[Tate Modern]] saw Tate's modern collections move there, while the old Millbank gallery became dedicated to the display of historical and contemporary [[British art]]. As a consequence, it was renamed Tate Britain in March 2000.

The front part of the building was designed by [[Sidney R. J. Smith]] with a classical [[portico]] and [[dome]] behind, and the central sculpture gallery was designed by [[John Russell Pope]]. Tate Britain includes the Clore Gallery of 1987, designed by [[James Stirling (architect)|James Stirling]], which houses work by [[J. M. W. Turner]]. The Clore Gallery has been regarded as an important example of [[Postmodern architecture]], especially in the use of contextual irony: each section of the external facade quotes liberally from the building next to it in regard to materials and detailing.&lt;ref&gt;"British Architecture", ''Architectural Design'', London, 1982, p.78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Crises during its existence include flood damage to work from the [[River Thames]], and bomb damage during World War II. However, most of the collection was in safe storage elsewhere during the war, and a large [[Stanley Spencer]] painting, deemed too big to move, had a protective brick wall built in front of it.

In 1970, the building was given [[Listed building|Grade II*]] listed status.&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England |num=1222913 |desc=Tate Gallery |accessdate=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Tate Britain announced that it had raised the £45&amp;nbsp;million&lt;ref name="Sulcas"&gt;{{cite news|first=Roslyn|last=Sulcas|date=18 November 2013|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/18/tate-britain-completes-renovation/|title=Tate Britain Completes Renovation|work=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; required to complete a major renovation, largely thanks to a £4.9&amp;nbsp;million grant from the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]] and £1&amp;nbsp;million given by Tate Members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-18101020|title=Tate Britain hits £45m renovation target|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=17 May 2012|accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum stayed open throughout the three phases&lt;ref name="Merrick"&gt;{{cite news|first=Jay|last=Merrick|date=18 November 2013|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/tate-britains-redesign-it-may-not-be-cool-but-its-restrained-and-elegant-and-it-works-8947624.html|title=Tate Britain's redesign: It may not be cool but it’s restrained, and elegant, and it works|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; of renovation.&lt;ref name="Sulcas"/&gt; Completed in 2013, the newly designed sections were conceived by the architects [[Caruso St John]] and included a total of nine new galleries, with reinforced flooring to accommodate heavy sculptures. A second part was unveiled later that year, the centrepiece being the reopening of the building's Thames-facing entrance as well as a new spiral staircase beneath its rotunda.&lt;ref name="Merrick"/&gt; The circular balcony of the rotunda's domed atrium, closed to visitors since the 1920s, was reopened. The gallery also now has a dedicated schools' entrance and reception beneath its entrance steps on Millbank and a new archive gallery for the presentation of temporary displays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24987799|title='Transformed' Tate Britain unveiled|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=18 November 2013|accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==
[[File:Millbank Pier, London.JPG|thumb|[[Millbank Millennium Pier]] outside Tate Britain, which is linked by a high-speed boat to [[Tate Modern]]]]
The front entrance is accessible by steps. A side entrance at a lower level has a ramp for wheelchair access. The gallery provides a restaurant and a café, as well as a Friends room, open only to members of the Tate. This membership is open to the public on payment of an annual subscription. As well as administration offices the building complex houses the Prints and Drawings Rooms (in the Clore galleries),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/research/researchservices/printrooms/ |title=Prints and Drawings Rooms |publisher=Tate |date= |accessdate=15 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the Library&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/research/library "Research services: library"], Tate online.&lt;/ref&gt; and Archive&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/research/library "Research services:archive"], Tate online.&lt;/ref&gt; in the Hyman Kreitman Reading Rooms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/research/researchservices/readingrooms/ "Research services: Hyman Kreitman Reading Rooms"], Tate online.&lt;/ref&gt; The restaurant features a mural by [[Rex Whistler]].

Tate Britain and Tate Modern are now connected by a high speed boat along the [[River Thames]], which runs from [[Millbank Millennium Pier]] immediately outside Tate Britain. The boat is decorated with spots, based on paintings of similar appearance by [[Damien Hirst]]. The lighting artwork incorporated in the pier's structure is by [[Angela Bulloch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.millbankpier.co.uk |title=Millbank Pier web site |publisher=Millbankpier.co.uk |date=22 May 2003 |accessdate=15 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Displays==
The main display spaces show the permanent collection of historic British art, as well as contemporary work. It has rooms dedicated to works by one artist, such as: [[Tracey Emin]], [[John Latham (artist)|John Latham]], [[Douglas Gordon]], [[Sam Taylor-Wood]], [[Tacita Dean]], Marcus Gheeraerts II, though these, like the rest of the collection, are subject to rotation.

The gallery also organises career retrospectives of British artists and temporary major exhibitions of British Art. Every three years the gallery stages a Triennial exhibition in which a guest curator provides an overview of contemporary British Art. The 2003 Tate Triennial was called ''Days Like These''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/days-these "Days Like These"], Tate online.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Art Now'' is a small changing show of a contemporary artist's work in a dedicated room.

Tate Britain is the home of the annual and usually controversial [[Turner Prize]] exhibition, featuring four artists selected by a jury chaired by the director of Tate Britain. This is spread out over the year with the four nominees announced in May, the show of their work opened in October and the prize itself given in December. Each stage of the prize generates media coverage, and there have also been a number of demonstrations against the prize, notably since 2000 an [[Stuckist demonstrations|annual picket]] by [[Stuckism|Stuckist]] artists. In recent years the exhibition and award ceremony have taken place at locations other than in Tate Britain: for example in Liverpool (2007), Derry-Londonderry (2013), Glasgow (2015) and Hull (2017).

Tate Britain has attempted to reach out to a different and younger audience with ''Late at Tate Britain'' on the first Friday of every month, with half-price admission to exhibitions, live music and performance art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/eventseries/late-tate-britain "events education"], Tate online.&lt;/ref&gt; Other public involvement has included the display of visitors', as opposed to curators', interpretation of certain artworks.

Regular free tours operate on the hour, and at 1.15&amp;nbsp;pm on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday short 15-minute talks are given on paintings, artists and artistic styles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://londonboard.co.uk/tate-britain/ Tate Britain] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209223049/http://londonboard.co.uk/tate-britain/ |date=9 February 2012 }}, LondonBoard.co.uk, Accessed 8 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Permanent collection==

Tate Britain is the national gallery of British art from 1500 to the present day. As such, it is the most comprehensive collection of its kind in the world (only the [[Yale Center for British Art]] can claim similar expansiveness, but with less depth).  More recent artists include [[David Hockney]], [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]] and [[Francis Bacon (painter)|Francis Bacon]]. Works in the permanent Tate collection, which may be on display at Tate Britain include:

==Statue of Millais==
[[File:Millais statue 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of [[John Everett Millais]] by [[Thomas Brock]] at Tate Britain]]
When the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelite]] painter and President of the [[Royal Academy]], [[John Everett Millais]], died in 1896, the Prince of Wales (later to become [[King Edward VII]]) chaired a memorial committee, which commissioned a statue of the artist.&lt;ref name=birchall&gt;Birchall, Heather. [http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&amp;workid=27325&amp;searchid=11876&amp;tabview=text "Sir Thomas Brock  1847–1922"], Tate online, February 2002. Retrieved 5 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This was installed at the front of the gallery in the garden on the east side in 1905. On 23 November that year, ''[[The Pall Mall Gazette]]'' called it "a breezy statue, representing the man in the characteristic attitude in which we all knew him".&lt;ref name=birchall/&gt;

In 1953, Tate Director, [[Norman Reid (museum director)|Sir Norman Reid]], attempted to have it replaced by [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]]'s ''John the Baptist'', and in 1962 again proposed its removal, calling its presence "positively harmful". His efforts were frustrated by the statue's owner, the [[Ministry of Works (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Works]]. Ownership was transferred from the Ministry to [[English Heritage]] in 1996, and by them in turn to the Tate.&lt;ref name=birchall/&gt; In 2000 the statue was removed to the rear of the building.&lt;ref name=birchall/&gt;

'''Taylor v Beere''' [1982] 1 NZLR 81  is a cited case in New Zealand regarding exemplary damages in tort &lt;ref name="McLay"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Torts |edition=4th |last1=McLay |first1=Geoff |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71686-X|year=2003 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Mrs Beere had one of her friends who was an amateur photographer take a photograph of her and her granddaughter in their home.

In 1972, Beere discovered that another friend, controversial publisher [[Alister Taylor]], had obtained the negative, and was planning to print a guidebook for teenagers called "Down under the Plum Trees" about sex, alcohol and drug use featuring this photo.

Beere wrote to Taylor, demanding that her photo not be used in his book, but Taylor included this photo in the first 10,000 books.

Her photo featuring in such a book caused Beere embarrassment, as people thought she had agreed to be in the book.

As a result, Beere sued for defamation.

==Held==
Beere was awarded $12,500 in damages, which included an award for exemplary damages.

'''Teylers Museum''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈtɛilərs myˈzeːjɵm}}) is an [[Art museum|art]], [[Natural history museum|natural history]], and [[science museum]] in [[Haarlem]], [[Netherlands]]. Established in 1778, Teylers Museum was founded as a centre for contemporary art and science.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5634/ Teylers Museum], [[UNESCO World Heritage Centre]] website&lt;/ref&gt; The historic centre of the museum is the neoclassical [[Teylers Oval Room|Oval Room]] (1784), which was built behind the house of [[Pieter Teyler van der Hulst]] (1702–1778), the so-called [[Fundatiehuis (Teyler)|''Fundatiehuis'']] (Foundation House). Pieter Teyler was a wealthy cloth merchant and banker of [[Scotland|Scottish]] descent, who bequeathed his fortune for the advancement of religion, art, and science. He was a [[Mennonite]] and follower of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]].

==History==
In his will, Pieter Teyler stipulated that his collection and part of his fortune should be used to establish a foundation for their promotion: [[Teylers Stichting]]. The Teyler legacy to the city of Haarlem was split into two societies: [[Teylers Eerste Genootschap|Teylers First or Theological Society]] (Dutch: ''Teylers Eerste of Godgeleerd Genootschap''), intended for the study of religion and [[Teylers Tweede Genootschap|Teylers Second Society]] (Dutch: ''Teylers Tweede Genootschap''), which was to concern itself with physics, poetry, history, drawing, and numismatics.

The executors of Teyler's will, the first directors of [[Teylers Stichting]], decided to establish a centre for study and education. Under a single roof, it would house all manner of suitable artifacts, such as books, scientific instruments, drawings, fossils, and minerals. The concept was based on a revolutionary ideal derived from the Enlightenment: that people could discover the world independently, without coercion by church or state. The example that guided the founders in establishing Teylers Museum was the ''Mouseion'' of classical antiquity: a “temple for the muses of the arts and sciences” that could also serve as a meeting place for scholars and the venue for various collections.&lt;ref name="unesco"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teylersmuseum.eu/pdf/1328013930_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.pdf |title=Executive summary UNESCO Nomination file |publisher=Teylers Museum }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oval Room==

In 1779, [[Leendert Viervant the Younger|Leendert Viervant]] started on the design of an "art and book room" behind Teyler’s residence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teylersmuseum.eu/teylersuniversum/index.php?m=bouw&amp;nvlng=en Leendert Viervant's architectural drawings for the Oval Room] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224105746/http://www.teylersmuseum.eu/teylersuniversum/index.php?m=bouw&amp;nvlng=en |date=2013-12-24 }} Teylers Museum website&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Neo-classical architecture|neoclassical]] room, whose shape quickly led it to be called the [[Teylers Oval Room|Oval Room]], was designed for research and study; here, scientific experiments would be conducted, public demonstrations held, and books, drawings, and prints viewed by the public. The Oval room was opened in 1784, with the scientist [[Martin van Marum]] as its first director.

A showcase in the centre displays a [[Mineralogy|mineralogical collection]] from the 18th century and the showcases around hold 18th-century scientific instruments. The upper gallery, which was designed to let in the maximum amount of light for viewing purposes, has 12 built-in bookcases, largely containing period [[encyclopaedia]]s and periodicals.

==Extensions==
Over the ensuing centuries, the museum was gradually extended. The arrangement of each new part was consistent with the insights of the day; thereafter it remained almost wholly unchanged. In the 19th century, the museum was expanded with two painting galleries: [[Teylers Eerste Schilderijenzaal|Teylers First Painting Gallery]] in 1838 and [[Teylers Tweede Schilderijenzaal|Paintings Gallery II]] in 1892. In 1878, to mark the first centenary, a new entrance on the Spaarne (the current main entrance) was designed by the Viennese  architect [[Christian Ulrich]].&lt;ref name="Deugd boven geweld"&gt;{{cite book|title=Deugd boven geweld — Een geschiedenis van Haarlem 1245–1995
|publisher=Historisch Werkgroep Haarlem en Gemeentearchief, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; It opened in 1885. The rooms behind it – the [[Teylers Instrument Room|Instrument Room]], and Fossil Room I and, behind it, [[Teylers_Fossil_Room_II|Fossil Room II]] – were designed by the Haarlem architect A. van der Steur. At the same time, the library was extended and a 150-seat auditorium was added.  Over a century later, in 1996, a large new wing was added; this was the design of Hubert-Jan Henket. In 2002, an adjoining property was added to the museum to serve as the museum shop and multimedia room.

==Collection==
Teylers Museum holdings include fossils (some are the first ever discovered of ''[[Archaeopteryx]]''), minerals, scientific instruments, medals, coins, and paintings.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

The museum’s first director, [[Martinus van Marum]] contributed to and used the facilities at Teylers Museum to research static electricity. To study fossils, he purchased fossil material such as the ''[[Mosasaurus]]''. To demonstrate the principles of hydraulics, he commissioned models of mills and cranes.
To disseminate natural and cultural knowledge, public experiments were conducted, such as those with van Marum’s [[large electrostatic generator (Teylers)|large electrostatic generator]] built in 1784 by John Cuthbertson in Amsterdam (the largest in the world). Lectures were given and scientific literature published.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

The collection of Teylers Museum holdings include works by [[Michelangelo]], [[Raphael]], [[Guercino]], and [[Claude Lorrain]]. The museum contains graphic work of [[Rembrandt]] and [[Adriaen van Ostade]]. {{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

The Painting Galleries show a collection of works from the Dutch Romantic School and the later [[Hague School|Hague]] and [[Amsterdam]] Schools, including major works by [[Barend Cornelis Koekkoek]], [[Andreas Schelfhout]], [[Cornelis Springer]], [[Hendrik Willem Mesdag]], [[Jan Willem Pieneman]], [[Anton Mauve]], [[Jacob Maris]], [[Jan Hendrik Weissenbruch]], [[George Hendrik Breitner]], [[Jozef Israëls]], and [[Isaac Israëls]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} 

In 2007, the works of [[John James Audubon]] were displayed.&lt;ref name="vogelsxxl2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vogelsxxl.nl/tentoonstelling.php |title=Teylers 2007 exhibition website |publisher=Vogelsxxl.nl |date=2007-11-03 |accessdate=2011-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The original mission of the second society included research, as well as education. After the death of van Marum, Teylers continued to attract scientists of high standing as caretakers. The theoretical physicist and [[Nobel Prize]] winner [[Hendrik Lorentz]] was appointed Curator of Teylers Physics Cabinet in 1910, a position he held until his death in 1928. At the time of his appointment, Lorentz was at the height of his scientific career and was a central figure in the international community of physicists. Under his leadership, the Teylers Museum conducted scientific research in such diverse fields as optics, electromagnetism, radio waves, and atom physics. Lorentz was succeeded by the physicist and musician [[Adriaan Fokker]]. Physicist [[Wander Johannes de Haas]] served as conservator in the 1920s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

The museum’s entire archives have also survived intact. They include the complete series of accounts for all acquisitions, extensions, salaries and day-to-day purchases since 1778, the complete series of visitors’ books since 1789, and the minutes of all meetings of the museum board since 1778.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130213172234/http://www.teylersmuseum.eu/teylersuniversum/index.php?m=arch&amp;nvlng=en Teylers Museum website] on the Archive of Teylers Stichting&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum is open six days a week; Tuesdays-Saturday 10:00-17:00, and Sundays 12:00-17:00.

== Heritage site ==
The museum is on the [[top 100 Dutch heritage sites]] list compiled by the [[Rijksdienst voor het Cultureel Erfgoed|Department for Conservation]] in 1990. It was nominated on 12 December 2011 by the Dutch Cabinet for [[UNESCO]] [[world heritage]] status, based on its long history as a public knowledge institute and its continued efforts to preserve public access to its collections.&lt;ref name="unesco"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/documenten-en-publicaties/persberichten/2011/12/16/kabinet-nomineert-teylers-museum-voor-werelderfgoedlijst-unesco.html Cabinet nominates Teylers Museum for World Heritage list] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112141836/http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/documenten-en-publicaties/persberichten/2011/12/16/kabinet-nomineert-teylers-museum-voor-werelderfgoedlijst-unesco.html |date=2013-11-12 }} Press summary on Dutch government website&lt;/ref&gt; However, the nomination was withdrawn in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/archive/2013/whc13-37com-20-en.pdf Decision adopted by the World Heritage Committee at its 37th session (Phnom Penh, 2013)], [[UNESCO]], 2013. Retrieved on 20 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Administration ==
Marjan Scharloo is the [[museum director]] and Michiel Plomp is the [[Conservation (cultural heritage)|conservator]] of the museum.&lt;ref name="staff"/&gt;

The museum had a record number of 157,843 visitors in 2016, which was around 20,000 more than the year before and 10,000 more than the previous record in 2012.&lt;ref name="visitors2016"/&gt;

Teylers Museum is a member of the Museumvereniging (Museum Association).&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.museumvereniging.nl/Devereniging/LedenMuseumvereniging/tabid/101/MuseumId/152/Default.aspx Teylers Museum] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729203111/http://www.museumvereniging.nl/Devereniging/LedenMuseumvereniging/tabid/101/MuseumId/152/Default.aspx |date=2014-07-29 }}, Museumvereniging.

'''''The Gefilte Manifesto: New Recipes for Old World Jewish Foods''''' is a "narrative cookbook"&lt;ref name="Jeff Yosko (personal site)"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yoskowitz|first1=Jeffrey|title=Writings|url=http://www.jeffreyyoskowitz.com/writings.html|website=Jeffrey Yoskowitz|accessdate=23 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; written by Jeffrey Yoskowitz and Liz Alpern, and published by [[Flatiron Books]] in 2016. It is primarily a cookbook which attempts to modernize Ashkenazic [[Jewish cuisine]]. The book contains 98 recipes.&lt;ref name="source"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yoskowitz|first1=Jeffrey|last2=Alpern|first2=Liz|title=The Gefilte Manifesto: New Recipes for Old World Jewish Foods|date=2016|publisher=Flatiron Books|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-250-07138-5|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
''The Gefilte Manifesto'' draws its namesake from the mission statement of [[The Gefilteria]], the business owned and operated by the authors.&lt;ref name="source" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt; The word 'gefilte' is [[Yiddish]] for 'stuffed', and references [[gefilte fish]], an [[Ashkenazi]] delicacy which is unpopular among American Jews.&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rose|first1=Joel|title='The Gefilte Manifesto': A Loved, And Loathed, Jewish Staple Gets Updated|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/09/13/493631807/the-gefilte-manifesto-a-loved-and-loathed-jewish-staple-gets-updated|accessdate=22 October 2016|work=National Public Radio|issue=All Things Considered|date=September 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book, and the recipes and discussions it contains, are expressly a rejection of mass-produced Jewish food, and the stigma which has come with it. Yoskowitz, who wrote his college thesis on the kosher food industry, has even called the kosher aisle at grocery stores "the place where Jewish food goes to die",&lt;ref name="Forward" /&gt; and in ''The Gefilte Manifesto'', he and Alpern attempt to make [[Jewish Cuisine]] accessible to home cooks without sacrificing convenience.&lt;ref name="source" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt;

The publishing of ''The Gefilte Manifesto'' coincides and contributes to what The New York Times called a "Golden Age" of American Jewish food,&lt;ref name="Golden Age"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moskin|first1=Julia|title=Everything New Is Old Again: The New Golden Age of Jewish-American Deli Food|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/28/dining/everything-new-is-old-again.html?_r=0|website=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=23 October 2016|date=May 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in an interview with Joel Rose on National Public Radio, Yoskowitz stated that his and Alpern's mission was to "revitalize [Ashkenazi Jewish] cuisine".&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt;

{{Watergate}}
The '''Watergate scandal''' was a major [[List of federal political scandals in the United States|political scandal]] that occurred in the United States during the early 1970s, following a break-in by five men at the [[Democratic National Committee]] (DNC) headquarters at the [[Watergate hotel|Watergate office complex]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] on June 17, 1972, and [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]]'s administration's subsequent attempt to cover up its involvement. After the five burglars were caught, and the conspiracy was discovered—chiefly through the work of a few journalists, Congressional staffers and an election-finance watchdog official&lt;ref name="watergate_case_study_jm_perry_columbia_edu"&gt;
[[James M. Perry|Perry, James M.]] (chief political correspondent, ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''), [http://www.columbia.edu/itc/journalism/j6075/edit/readings/watergate.html "Watergate Case Study,"], from [http://www.columbia.edu/itc/journalism/j6075/ Class Syllabus for "Critical Issues in Journalism."] [[Columbia School of Journalism]], [[Columbia University]], retrieved July 27, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;—Watergate was investigated by the [[United States Congress]]. Meanwhile, Nixon's administration resisted its probes, which led to a [[constitutional crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A burglary turns into a constitutional crisis|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/06/11/watergate/index.html?_s=PM:US|accessdate=May 13, 2014|work=CNN|date=June 16, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Watergate'', by [[metonymy]], has come to encompass an array of clandestine and often illegal activities undertaken by members of the Nixon administration. Those activities included such [[ratfucking|dirty tricks]] as [[Covert listening device|bugging]] the offices of political opponents and people of whom Nixon or his officials were suspicious. Nixon and his close aides also ordered investigations of activist groups and political figures, using the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), and the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) as political weapons.&lt;ref name="watergate_committee_final_report"&gt;[[Sam Ervin|Ervin, Sam, U.S. Senator]], et. al., ''Final Report of the Watergate Committee]''&lt;/ref&gt;  {{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The scandal led to the discovery of multiple abuses of power by members of the Nixon administration, [[impeachment process against Richard Nixon|an impeachment process against the president]] that led to [[impeachment in the United States|articles of impeachment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classes.lls.edu/archive/manheimk/371d1/nixonarticles.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303075538/http://classes.lls.edu/archive/manheimk/371d1/nixonarticles.html|archive-date=March 3, 2017|date=Spring 1999|work=Impeachment Seminar|title=Nixon Articles of Impeachment |first=Karl|last=Manheim |first2=Lawrence B.|last2=Solum}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Nixon's resignation. The scandal also resulted in the [[Indictment#United States|indictment]] of 69 people, with trials or [[plea]]s resulting in 48 being found guilty, many of whom were top Nixon officials.&lt;ref name=convictions/&gt;

The affair began with the arrest of five men for breaking into the DNC headquarters at the Watergate complex on Saturday, June 17, 1972. The FBI investigated and discovered a connection between cash found on the burglars and a [[slush fund]] used by the [[Committee for the Re-Election of the President]] (CRP), the official organization of Nixon's campaign.&lt;ref name="congressional quarterly vol 1"&gt;

After a series of court battles, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] unanimously ruled that the president was obligated to release the tapes to government investigators (''[[United States v. Nixon]]''). The tapes revealed that Nixon had attempted to cover up activities that took place after the break-in, and to use federal officials to deflect the investigation.&lt;ref name="smoking gun tape" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The evidence was quite simple: the voice of the President on June 23, 1972 directed the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) to halt an FBI investigation that would be politically embarrassing to his re-election. This direction was an obstruction of justice.

== Wiretapping of the Democratic Party's headquarters ==
[[File:Government Exhibit 133, Chapstick Tubes with Hidden Microphones - NARA - 304967.tif|thumb|E. Howard Hunt and G. Gordon Liddy, who led the Watergate break-in team, were stationed in a Watergate Hotel room while the burglary was underway. A lookout was posted across the street at the Howard Johnson Hotel. [[Bruce Givner]] was a 21-year old intern working at the DNC's 6th floor offices in the Watergate Hotel Complex when his prolonged stay on that floor precluded the burglars from entering the offices to correct their earlier wiretap work. During the break-in, Hunt and Liddy would remain in contact with each other and with the burglars by radio. These Chapstick tubes outfitted with tiny microphones were later discovered in Hunt's White House office safe.]]

On January 27, 1972, [[G. Gordon Liddy]], Finance Counsel for the [[Committee for the Re-Election of the President]] (CRP) and former aide to [[John Ehrlichman]], presented a campaign intelligence plan to CRP's Acting Chairman [[Jeb Stuart Magruder]], Attorney General [[John N. Mitchell|John Mitchell]], and Presidential Counsel [[John Dean]] that involved extensive illegal activities against the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. According to Dean, this marked "the opening scene of the worst political scandal of the twentieth century and the beginning of the end of the Nixon presidency".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dean|first1=John W.|title=The Nixon Defense: What He Knew and When He Knew It|page=xvii|publisher=Viking|date=2014|isbn=978-0-670-02536-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitchell viewed the plan as unrealistic. Two months later, he was alleged to have approved a reduced version of the plan, including burgling the [[Democratic National Committee]]'s (DNC) headquarters at the [[Watergate Complex]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] — ostensibly to photograph campaign documents and install listening devices in telephones. Liddy was nominally in charge of the operation, but has since insisted that he was duped by both Dean and at least two of his subordinates, which included former CIA officers [[E. Howard Hunt]] and [[James W. McCord, Jr.|James McCord]], the latter of whom was serving as then-CRP Security Coordinator after John Mitchell had by then resigned as Attorney General to become the CRP chairman.&lt;ref Name=TimeRetrospective/&gt;&lt;ref name=nixonmitchell&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/watergate/stories/mitchobit.htm|first=Lawrence|last=Meyer|title=John N. Mitchell, Principal in Watergate, Dies at 75|work=The Washington Post|date=November 10, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May, McCord assigned former FBI agent [[Alfred C. Baldwin III]] to carry out the wiretapping and monitor the telephone conversations afterward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rugaber|first=Walter|title=Watergate Trial in Closed Session|work=The New York Times|date=January 18, 1973|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/18/archives/watergate-trial-in-closed-session-judge-clears-court-to-hear.html|access-date=April 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCord testified that he selected Baldwin's name from a registry published by the [[Society of Former Special Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI's Society of Former Special Agents]] to work for the Committee to re-elect President Nixon.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Baldwin first served as bodyguard to Martha Mitchell — John Mitchell's wife, who was living in Washington.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Baldwin accompanied Martha Mitchell to Chicago.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Martha did not like Baldwin and described him as the "gauchest character [she'd] ever met".{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} The Committee replaced Baldwin with another security man.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

On May 11, McCord arranged for Baldwin, whom investigative reporter [[Jim Hougan]] described as "somehow special and perhaps well known to McCord",{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} to stay at the Howard Johnson's motel across the street from the Watergate complex.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Room 419 was booked in the name of McCord's company.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} At behest of [[G.

Two phones inside the DNC headquarters' offices were said to have been [[wiretapped]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} One was [[Robert Spencer Oliver]]'s phone. At the time, Oliver was working as the executive director of the Association of State Democratic Chairmen. The other phone belonged to DNC chairman [[Larry O'Brien]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} The FBI found no evidence that O'Brien's phone was bugged;{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} however, it was determined that an effective listening device was installed in Oliver's phone.&lt;ref name=mccordreturns /&gt;

Despite successfully installing the listening devices, the Committee agents soon determined that they needed repairs.&lt;ref name=mccordreturns /&gt; They planned a second "burglary" in order to take care of the situation.&lt;ref name=mccordreturns&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/15/us/watergate-then-now-2-decades-after-political-burglary-questions-still-linger.html|title=Watergate, Then and Now – 2 Decades After a Political Burglary, the Questions Still Linger|first=Robert|last=Pear|work=The New York Times|date=June 14, 1992|accessdate=May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometime after midnight on Saturday, June 17, 1972, Watergate Complex security guard [[Frank Wills (security guard)|Frank Wills]] noticed tape covering the [[Latch (hardware)|latches]] on some of the complex's doors leading from the underground parking garage to several offices, which allowed the doors to close but stay unlocked. He removed the tape, thinking nothing of it. When he returned a short time later and discovered that someone had retaped the locks, he called the police. Responding to the call was an unmarked car with three plainclothes officers working the overnight "bum squad" – dressed as hippies and on the lookout for drug deals and other street crimes. The burglars' sentry across the street, Alfred Baldwin, was distracted watching TV and didn't notice the arrival of the police car in front of the hotel or the plainclothes officers investigating the DNC's sixth floor suite of 29 offices. By the time Baldwin noticed unusual activity on the sixth floor and radioed the burglars, it was already too late.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonian.com/2012/06/20/the-bartenders-tale-how-the-watergate-burglars-got-caught/|title=The Bartender’s Tale: How the Watergate Burglars Got Caught {{!}} Washingtonian|last=Shirley|first=Craig|date=2012-06-20|work=Washingtonian|access-date=2018-10-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police apprehended five men, later identified as [[Virgilio Gonzalez]], [[Bernard Barker]], [[James W. McCord, Jr.|James McCord]], [[Eugenio Martínez]], and [[Frank Sturgis]].&lt;ref Name=TimeRetrospective/&gt; They were charged with attempted burglary and attempted interception of telephone and other communications. ''The Washington Post'' reported that "police found lock-picks and door jimmies, almost $2,300 in cash, most of it in $100 bills with the serial numbers in sequence....a short wave receiver that could pick up police calls, 40 rolls of unexposed film, two 35 millimeter cameras and three pen-sized tear gas guns."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lewis|first1=Alfred E.|title=5 Held in Plot to Bug Democrats' Office Here|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2002/05/31/AR2005111001227.html|accessdate=28 December 2017|work=The Washington Post|date=June 18, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The following morning, Sunday, June 18th, G. Gordon Liddy called Jeb Magruder in Los Angeles and informed him that "the four men arrested with McCord were Cuban freedom fighters, whom Howard Hunt recruited." Initially, Nixon's organization and the White House quickly went to work to cover up the crime and any evidence that might have damaged the president and his reelection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Genovese|first1=Michael A.|title=The Watergate Crisis|date=1999|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Conn.|isbn=9780313298783}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within hours of the burglars' arrest, the FBI discovered [[E. Howard Hunt]]'s name in Barker and Martínez's address books. Nixon administration officials were concerned because Hunt and Liddy were also involved in a separate secret activity known as the "[[White House Plumbers]]", which was set up to stop security "[[News leak|leaks]]" and investigate other sensitive security matters. Dean later testified that top Nixon aide [[John Ehrlichman]] ordered him to "deep six" the contents of Howard Hunt's White House safe. Ehrlichman subsequently denied this. In the end, Dean and the FBI's Acting Director [[L. Patrick Gray]] (in separate operations) destroyed the evidence from Hunt's safe.

Nixon's own reaction to the break-in, at least initially, was one of skepticism. Watergate prosecutor James Neal was sure that Nixon had not known in advance of the break-in. As evidence, he cited a conversation taped on June 23 between the President and his Chief of Staff, [[H. R. Haldeman]], in which Nixon asked, "Who was the asshole that did?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Transcript Of A Recording Of A Meeting Between The President And H.R.

A few days later, Nixon's Press Secretary, [[Ron Ziegler]], described the event as "a third-rate burglary attempt." On August 29, at a news conference, Nixon stated that Dean had conducted a thorough investigation of the incident, when Dean had actually not conducted any investigations at all. Nixon furthermore said, "I can say categorically that ... no one in the White House staff, no one in this Administration, presently employed, was involved in this very bizarre incident." On September 15, Nixon congratulated Dean, saying, "The way you've handled it, it seems to me, has been very skillful, because you—putting your fingers in the dikes every time that leaks have sprung here and sprung there."&lt;ref Name=TimeRetrospective/&gt;

On June 19, 1972, the press reported that one of the Watergate burglars was a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] security aide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://watergate.info/chronology/brief-timeline-of-events |title=Brief Timeline of Events |publisher=Malcolm Farnsworth |accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Attorney General John Mitchell, who at the time was the head of the CRP, denied any involvement with the Watergate break-in or knowledge of the five burglars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/10/obituaries/john-n-mitchell-dies-at-75-major-figure-in-watergate.html|title=John N.

Mitchell, Principal in Watergate, Dies at 75|last=Meyer|first=Lawrence|date=November 10, 1988|work=The Washington Post|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 1, a $25,000 (${{Inflation|US|25000|1972|r=-3|fmt=c}} today) [[cashier's check]] was found to have been deposited in the US and Mexican bank accounts of one of the Watergate burglars, Bernard Barker. Made out to the Finance Committee of the Committee to Reelect the President, the check was a 1972 campaign donation by [[Kenneth H. Dahlberg#Watergate|Kenneth H. Dahlberg]]. This money (and several other checks which had been lawfully donated to the CRP) had been directly used to finance the burglary/wire tapping team's expenses, hardware, and supplies.

Mr. Barker's multiple national and international businesses all had separate bank accounts, which he was found to have attempted to use to disguise the true origin of the monies being paid to the burglars.  The donor's checks demonstrated the burglars' direct link to the finance committee of the CRP.

Donations totaling $86,000 (${{Inflation|US|86000|1972|r=-3|fmt=c}} today) were made by individuals who thought they were making private donations by certified and cashier's checks for the president's re-election. Investigators' examination of the bank records of a Miami company run by Watergate burglar Barker revealed an account controlled by him personally had deposited a check and then transferred it (through the [[Federal Reserve System#Check clearing system|Federal Reserve Check Clearing System]]).

The banks that had originated the checks were keen to ensure the depository institution used by Barker had acted properly in ensuring the checks had been received and endorsed by the check's payee, before its acceptance for deposit in Bernard Barker's account. Only in this way would the issuing banks not be held liable for the unauthorized and improper release of funds from their customers' accounts.

The investigation by the FBI, which cleared Barker's bank of fiduciary malfeasance, led to the direct implication of members of the CRP, to whom the checks had been delivered. Those individuals were the Committee bookkeeper and its treasurer, [[Hugh Sloan]].

As a private organization, the committee followed normal business practice in allowing only duly authorized individuals to accept and endorse checks on behalf of the Committee. No financial institution could accept or process a check on behalf of the committee unless a duly authorized individual endorsed it. The checks deposited into Barker's bank account were endorsed by Committee treasurer Hugh Sloan, who was authorized by the Finance Committee. However, once Sloan had endorsed a check made payable to the Committee, he had a legal and fiduciary responsibility to see that the check was deposited only into the accounts named on the check. Sloan failed to do that. When confronted with the potential charge of federal bank fraud, he revealed that committee deputy director [[Jeb Magruder]] and finance director [[Maurice Stans]] had directed him to give the money to [[G. Gordon Liddy]].

Liddy, in turn, gave the money to Barker, and attempted to hide its origin. Barker tried to disguise the funds by depositing them into accounts in banks outside of the United States. What Barker, Liddy, and Sloan did not know was that the complete record of all such transactions were held for roughly six months. Barker's use of foreign banks in April and May 1972, to deposit checks and withdraw the funds via cashier's checks and money orders, resulted in the banks keeping the entire transaction records until October and November 1972.

All five Watergate burglars were directly or indirectly tied to the 1972 CRP, thus causing Judge Sirica to suspect a conspiracy involving higher-echelon government officials.&lt;ref&gt;Quote: "There were still simply too many unanswered questions in the case. By that time, thinking about the break-in and reading about it, I'd have had to be some kind of moron to believe that no other people were involved. No political campaign committee would turn over so much money to a man like Gordon Liddy without someone higher up in the organization approving the transaction. How could I not see that? These questions about the case were on my mind during a pretrial session in my courtroom December 4."

On September 29, 1972, the press reported that John Mitchell, while serving as Attorney General, controlled a secret Republican fund used to finance intelligence-gathering against the Democrats. On October 10, the FBI reported the Watergate break-in was part of a massive campaign of political spying and sabotage on behalf of the Nixon re-election committee. Despite these revelations, Nixon's campaign was never seriously jeopardized; on November 7, the [[United States presidential election, 1972|President was re-elected]] in one of the biggest landslides in American political history.

=== Role of the media ===
The connection between the break-in and the re-election committee was highlighted by media coverage—in particular, investigative coverage by ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', and ''[[The New York Times]]''. The coverage dramatically increased publicity and consequent political and legal repercussions. Relying heavily upon [[anonymous sources]], ''Post'' reporters [[Bob Woodward]] and [[Carl Bernstein]] uncovered information suggesting that knowledge of the break-in, and attempts to cover it up, led deeply into the upper reaches of the Justice Department, FBI, CIA, and the White House. Woodward and Bernstein interviewed [[Judy Hoback Miller]], the bookkeeper for Nixon, who revealed to them information about the mishandling of funds and records being destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2012/06/woodward-and-bernstein-downplay-deep-throat-125950.html "Woodward Downplays Deep Throat"], Politico.com blog, June 2012. Retrieved February 8, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="watergate_case_study_jm_perry_columbia_edu" /&gt;

[[File:Watergate garage with historic marker.jpg|thumb|The garage in Rosslyn where Woodward and Felt met, seen in January 2018; also visible is the historical marker erected by the county to note its significance.]]

Chief among the ''Post's'' anonymous sources was an individual whom Woodward and Bernstein had nicknamed [[Deep Throat (Watergate)|Deep Throat]]; 33 years later, in 2005, the informant was identified as [[William Mark Felt, Sr.]], deputy director of the FBI during that period of the 1970s, something Woodward later confirmed. Felt met secretly with Woodward several times, telling him of Howard Hunt's involvement with the Watergate break-in, and that the White House staff regarded the stakes in Watergate as extremely high. Felt warned Woodward that the FBI wanted to know where he and other reporters were getting their information, as they were uncovering a wider web of crimes than the FBI first disclosed. All of the secret meetings between Woodward and Felt took place at an underground parking garage somewhere in [[Rosslyn, Virginia|Rosslyn]] over a period from June 1972 to January 1973. Prior to resigning from the FBI on June 22, 1973, Felt also anonymously planted [[News leak|leaks]] about Watergate with [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]], the ''[[Washington Daily News]]'' and other publications.&lt;ref name="watergate_case_study_jm_perry_columbia_edu" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Holland&gt;[http://www.pressherald.com/2012/02/19/the-profound-lies-of-deep-throat_2012-02-19/ "The profound lies of Deep Throat"], ''The Miami Herald'', republished in Portland Press Herald, February 14, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

During this early period, most of the media failed to grasp the full implications of the scandal, and concentrated reporting on other topics related to the 1972 presidential election.&lt;ref name=TimeWatergateCoverage&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,943934-1,00.html |title=Covering Watergate: Success and Backlash |work=Time  |date=July 8, 1974 |accessdate=July 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most outlets ignored or downplayed Woodward and Bernstein's scoops; the crosstown ''[[Washington Star-News]]'' and the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' even ran stories incorrectly discrediting the ''Post's'' articles.  After the ''Post'' revealed that [[H.R. Haldeman]] made payments from the secret fund, newspapers like the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' and the ''[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' failed to publish the information, but did publish the White House's denial of the story the following day.&lt;ref name="BoysontheBus"&gt;Crouse, Timothy, The Boys on the Bus, Random House, 1973, pg. 298&lt;/ref&gt;  The White House also sought to isolate the ''Post's'' coverage by tirelessly attacking that newspaper while declining to criticize other damaging stories about the scandal from the [[New York Times]] and [[Time Magazine]].&lt;ref name="BoysontheBus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="watergate_case_study_jm_perry_columbia_edu" /&gt;

After it was learned that one of the convicted burglars wrote to Judge Sirica alleging a high-level cover-up, the media shifted its focus. ''Time'' magazine described Nixon as undergoing "daily hell and very little trust." The distrust between the press and the Nixon administration was mutual and greater than usual due to lingering dissatisfaction with events from the [[Vietnam War]]. At the same time, public distrust of the media was polled at more than 40%.&lt;ref name=TimeWatergateCoverage /&gt;

Nixon and top administration officials discussed using government agencies to "get" (or retaliate against) those they perceived as hostile media organizations.&lt;ref name=TimeWatergateCoverage /&gt;  Such actions had been taken before.  At the request of Nixon's White House in 1969, the FBI tapped the phones of five reporters. In 1971, the White House requested an audit of the tax return of the editor of ''[[Newsday]]'', after he wrote a series of articles about the financial dealings of [[Charles Rebozo|Charles "Bebe" Rebozo]], a friend of Nixon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,911434-3,00.html |title=The Nation: More Evidence: Huge Case for Judgment|work=Time |date=July 29, 1974 |accessdate=July 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Administration and its supporters accused the media of making "wild accusations", putting too much emphasis on the story, and of having a liberal bias against the Administration.&lt;ref name=TimeWatergateCoverage /&gt;&lt;ref name="watergate_case_study_jm_perry_columbia_edu" /&gt; Nixon said in a May 1974 interview with supporter [[Baruch Korff]] that if he had followed the liberal policies that he thought the media preferred, "Watergate would have been a blip."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,942981-11,00.html |title=The Nixon Years: Down from the Mountaintop |work=Time |date=August 19, 1974 |accessdate=July 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The media noted that most of the reporting turned out to be accurate; the competitive nature of the media guaranteed widespread coverage of the far-reaching political scandal.&lt;ref name=TimeWatergateCoverage /&gt;

Applications to [[journalism schools]] reached an all-time high in 1974.&lt;ref name=TimeWatergateCoverage /&gt;

=== Scandal escalates ===
Rather than ending with the conviction and sentencing to prison of the five Watergate burglars on January 30, 1973, the investigation into the break-in and the Nixon Administration's involvement grew broader. Nixon's conversations in late March and all of April 1973 revealed that not only did he know he needed to remove Haldeman, Ehrlichman, and Dean to gain distance from them, but he had to do so in a way that was least likely to incriminate him and his presidency. Nixon created a new conspiracy—to effect a cover-up of the cover-up—which began in late March 1973 and became fully formed in May and June 1973, operating until his presidency ended on August 9, 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Dean, John W. ''The Nixon Defense'', p.344, Penguin Group, 2014 {{ISBN|978-0-670-02536-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 23, 1973, Judge Sirica read the court a letter from Watergate burglar [[James W. McCord Jr.|James McCord]], who alleged that [[perjury]] had been committed in the Watergate trial, and defendants had been pressured to remain silent. Trying to make them talk, Sirica gave Hunt and two burglars provisional sentences of up to 40 years.

On March 28, on Nixon's orders, aide John Ehrlichman told Attorney General [[Richard Kleindienst]] that nobody in the White House had prior knowledge of the burglary. On April 13, Magruder told U.S. attorneys that he had perjured himself during the burglars' trial, and implicated John Dean and John Mitchell.&lt;ref Name=TimeRetrospective/&gt;

John Dean believed that he, Mitchell, Ehrlichman, and Haldeman could go to the prosecutors, tell the truth, and save the presidency. Dean wanted to protect the president and have his four closest men take the fall for telling the truth. During the critical meeting between Dean and Nixon on April 15, 1973, Dean was totally unaware of the president's depth of knowledge and involvement in the Watergate cover-up. It was during this meeting that Dean felt that he was being recorded. He wondered if this was due to the way Nixon was speaking, as if he were trying to prod attendees' recollections of earlier conversations about fundraising. Dean mentioned this observation while testifying to the Senate Committee on Watergate, exposing the thread of what were taped conversations that would unravel the fabric of the conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;Dean, John W. ''The Nixon Defense: What He Knew and When He Knew It'', pp. 415–416, Penguin Group, 2014 {{ISBN|978-0-670-02536-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two days later, Dean told Nixon that he had been cooperating with the U.S. attorneys. On that same day, U.S. attorneys told Nixon that Haldeman, Ehrlichman, Dean, and other White House officials were implicated in the cover-up.&lt;ref Name=TimeRetrospective/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1973/Watergate-Scandal/12305770297723-4/ |title=Watergate Scandal, 1973 In Review. |agency=United Press International |date=September 8, 1973 |accessdate=June 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"When Judge Sirica finished reading the letter, the courtroom exploded with excitement and reporters ran to the rear entrance to phone their newspapers. The bailiff kept banging for silence. It was a stunning development, exactly what I had been waiting for. Perjury at the trial. The involvement of others. It looked as if Watergate was about to break wide open."

On April 30, Nixon asked for the resignation of Haldeman and Ehrlichman, two of his most influential aides. They were later both indicted, convicted, and ultimately sentenced to prison. He asked for the resignation of Attorney General Kleindienst, to ensure no one could claim that his innocent friendship with Haldeman and Ehrlichman could be construed as a conflict. He fired [[White House Counsel]] John Dean, who went on to testify before the [[Senate Watergate Committee]] and said that he believed and suspected the conversations in the Oval Office were being taped. This information became the bombshell that helped force Richard Nixon to resign rather than be impeached.&lt;ref&gt;Dean, John W. ''The Nixon Defense: What He Knew and When He Knew It'', pp. 610–620, Penguin Group, 2014 {{ISBN|978-0-670-02536-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing from prison for ''New West'' and ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazines in 1977, Ehrlichman claimed Nixon had offered him a large sum of money, which he declined.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,918947-2,00.html "Sequels: Nixon: Once More, with Feeling"], ''Time'', May 16, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

The President announced the resignations in an address to the American people:

{{quote|In one of the most difficult decisions of my Presidency, I accepted the resignations of two of my closest associates in the White House, Bob Haldeman, John Ehrlichman, two of the finest public servants it has been my privilege to know. Because Attorney General Kleindienst, though a distinguished public servant, my personal friend for 20 years, with no personal involvement whatsoever in this matter has been a close personal and professional associate of some of those who are involved in this case, he and I both felt that it was also necessary to name a new Attorney General. The [[Counsel to the President]], John Dean, has also resigned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1973/Watergate-Scandal/12305770297723-4/ |title=Watergate Scandal, 1973 in Review |agency=United Press International |date=September 8, 1973 |accessdate=June 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On the same day, Nixon appointed a new attorney general, [[Elliot Richardson]], and gave him authority to designate a special counsel for the Watergate investigation who would be independent of the regular [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] hierarchy. In May 1973, Richardson named [[Archibald Cox]] to the position.&lt;ref Name=TimeRetrospective/&gt;

On February 7, 1973, the United States Senate voted 77-to-0 to approve 93 {{USBill|93|S.

The three major networks of the time agreed to take turns covering the hearings live, each network thus maintaining coverage of the hearings every third day, starting with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on May 17 and ending with [[NBC]] on August 7.

On Friday, July 13, 1973, during a preliminary interview, deputy minority counsel [[Donald Sanders]] asked White House assistant [[Alexander Butterfield]] if there was any type of recording system in the White House.&lt;ref&gt;

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Butterfield said he was reluctant to answer, but finally stated there was a new system in the White House that automatically recorded everything in the [[Oval Office]], the [[Cabinet Room (White House)|Cabinet Room]] and others, as well as Nixon's private office in the [[Old Executive Office Building]].

On Monday, July 16, 1973, in front of a live, televised audience, chief minority counsel [[Fred Thompson]] asked Butterfield whether he was "aware of the installation of any listening devices in the Oval Office of the President." Butterfield's revelation of the taping system transformed the Watergate investigation. Cox immediately subpoenaed the tapes, as did the Senate, but Nixon refused to release them, citing his [[executive privilege]] as president, and ordered Cox to drop his subpoena. Cox refused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1973/Watergate-Scandal/12305770297723-4/ |title=Watergate Scandal, 1973 In Review |agency=United Press International |date=September 8, 1973 |accessdate=June 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Saturday Night Massacre" ===
{{Main|Saturday Night Massacre}}
On October 20, 1973, after Cox refused to drop the subpoena, Nixon ordered Attorney General [[Elliot Richardson]] to fire the special prosecutor. Richardson resigned in protest rather than carry out the order. Nixon then ordered Deputy Attorney General [[William Ruckelshaus]] to fire Cox, but Ruckelshaus also resigned rather than fire him. Nixon's search for someone in the Justice Department willing to fire Cox ended with the [[United States Solicitor General|Solicitor General]] [[Robert Bork]]. Though Bork said he believed Nixon's order was valid and appropriate, he considered resigning to avoid being "perceived as a man who did the President's bidding to save my job."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/02/us/bork-irked-by-emphasis-on-his-role-in-watergate.html|title=Bork Irked by Emphasis on His Role in Watergate|last=Noble|first=Kenneth|date=July 2, 1987|work=The New York Times|accessdate=May 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bork carried out the presidential order and dismissed the special prosecutor.

=== Legal action against Nixon Administration members ===
On March 1, 1974, a [[grand jury]] in Washington, D.C., indicted several former aides of Nixon, who became known as the "[[Watergate Seven]]"—[[H. R. Haldeman]], [[John Ehrlichman]], [[John N. Mitchell]], [[Charles Colson]], [[Gordon C. Strachan]], [[Robert Mardian]], and [[Kenneth Parkinson]]—for conspiring to hinder the Watergate investigation. The grand jury secretly named Nixon as an [[unindicted co-conspirator]]. The special prosecutor dissuaded them from an indictment of Nixon, arguing that a President can only be indicted after he leaves office.&lt;ref name=TimeLegal&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,942980,00.html |title=The Legal Aftermath Citizen Nixon and the Law |work=Time  |date=August 19, 1974 |accessdate=July 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Dean, [[Jeb Stuart Magruder]], and other figures had already pled guilty. On April 5, 1974, [[Dwight Chapin]], the former Nixon appointments secretary, was convicted of lying to the grand jury. Two days later, the same grand jury indicted [[Ed Reinecke]], the Republican [[Lieutenant Governor of California]], on three charges of perjury before the Senate committee.

=== Release of the transcripts ===
[[File:Nixon E2679c-09A.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|President Nixon giving a televised address explaining release of edited transcripts of the tapes on April 29, 1974]]

The Nixon administration struggled to decide what materials to release. All parties involved agreed that all pertinent information should be released. Whether to release unedited [[profanity]] and vulgarity divided his advisers. His legal team favored releasing the tapes unedited, while Press Secretary [[Ron Ziegler]] preferred using an edited version where "[[expletive deleted]]" would replace the raw material. After several weeks of debate, they decided to release an edited version. Nixon announced the release of the transcripts in a speech to the nation on April 29, 1974. Nixon noted that any audio pertinent to national security information could be [[redaction|redacted]] from the released tapes.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore White. ''[http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1370091&amp;referer=brief_results Breach of Faith: The Fall of Richard Nixon]''. Readers Digest Press, Athineum Publishers, 1975, pp. 296–298&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, Nixon gained a positive reaction for his speech. As people read the transcripts over the next couple of weeks, however, former supporters among the public, media and political community called for Nixon's resignation or impeachment. Vice President [[Gerald Ford]] said, "While it may be easy to delete characterization from the printed page, we cannot delete characterization from people's minds with a wave of the hand."&lt;ref name=woodward/&gt; The Senate Republican Leader [[Hugh Scott]] said the transcripts revealed a "deplorable, disgusting, shabby, and immoral" performance on the part of the President and his former aides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.mcall.com/1994-07-26/news/2994945_1_mr-scott-white-house-hugh-scott|title=Obituary: Hugh Scott, A Dedicated Public Servant
|newspaper=The Morning Call|date=July 26, 1994|accessdate=December 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The House Republican Leader [[John Jacob Rhodes]] agreed with Scott, and Rhodes recommended that if Nixon's position continued to deteriorate, he "ought to consider resigning as a possible option."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|url=http://stanforddailyarchive.com/cgi-bin/stanford?a=d&amp;d=stanford19740510-01.2.43#|title=GOP Leaders Favour Stepdown|newspaper=The Stanford Daily|date=May 10, 1974 |accessdate=December 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The editors of ''[[The Chicago Tribune]]'', a newspaper that had supported Nixon, wrote, "He is humorless to the point of being inhumane. He is devious. He is vacillating. He is profane. He is willing to be led. He displays dismaying gaps in knowledge. He is suspicious of his staff. His loyalty is minimal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A1123-2004Jun23.html|title=Obituary: Clayton Kirkpatrick, 89; Chicago Tribune Editor|author=Patricia Sullivan|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=June 24, 2004 |accessdate=December 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Providence Journal]]'' wrote, "Reading the transcripts is an emetic experience; one comes away feeling unclean."&lt;ref name=timemay20/&gt;&lt;!--COPY OF TIME EXCERPT: http://jfk.hood.edu/Collection/Weisberg-Watergate%20Files/Tapes%20Release/Tape%20Release%2039.pdf--&gt; This newspaper continued that, while the transcripts may not have revealed an indictable offense, they showed Nixon contemptuous of the United States, its institutions, and its people. According to ''Time'' magazine, the Republican Party leaders in the [[Western United States|Western U.S.]] felt that while there remained a significant number of Nixon loyalists in the party, the majority believed that Nixon should step down as quickly as possible. They were disturbed by the bad language and the coarse, vindictive tone of the conversations in the transcripts.&lt;ref name=timemay20&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/0,9263,7601740520,00.html|title=Time Magazine – U.S. Edition – May 20, 1974 Vol. 103 No. 20 |work=Time |date=May 20, 1974 |accessdate=July 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/0,9263,7601740513,00.html |title=Time Magazine – U.S. Edition – May 13, 1974 Vol. 103 No. 19 |work=Time |date=May 13, 1974 |accessdate=July 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Supreme Court ===
The issue of access to the tapes went to the United States Supreme Court. On July 24, 1974, in ''[[United States v. Nixon]]'', the Court ruled unanimously (8 to 0) that claims of executive privilege over the tapes were void. (Then-Justice [[William Rehnquist]]—who had recently been appointed to the Court by Nixon and most recently served in the Nixon Justice Department as Assistant Attorney General of the Office of Legal Counsel—recused himself from the case.) The Court ordered the President to release the tapes to the special prosecutor. On July 30, 1974, Nixon complied with the order and released the subpoenaed tapes to the public.

=== Release of the tapes ===
The tapes revealed several crucial conversations&lt;ref&gt;Kutler, S: ''Abuse of Power'', page 247. Simon &amp; Schuster, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; that took place between the President and his counsel, John Dean, on March 21, 1973. In this conversation, Dean summarized many aspects of the Watergate case, and focused on the subsequent cover-up, describing it as a "cancer on the presidency." The burglary team was being paid [[hush money]] for their silence and Dean stated: "That's the most troublesome post-thing, because Bob [Haldeman] is involved in that; John [Ehrlichman] is involved in that; I am involved in that; Mitchell is involved in that. And that's an obstruction of justice." Dean continued, saying that Howard Hunt was blackmailing the White House demanding money immediately. Nixon replied that the money should be paid: "...&amp;nbsp;just looking at the immediate problem, don't you have to have—handle Hunt's financial situation damn soon?&amp;nbsp;… you've got to keep the cap on the bottle that much, in order to have any options."&lt;ref name="nixonlibrary.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nixonlibrary.gov/forresearchers/find/tapes/watergate/wspf/886-008.pdf |title=Transcript Prepared by the Impeachment Inquiry Staff for the House Judiciary Committee of a Recording of a Meeting Among the President, John Dean and H.R. Haldeman on March 21, 1973 from 10:12 to 11:55&amp;nbsp;am |format=PDF |accessdate=July 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the initial congressional proceedings, it was not known if Nixon had known and approved of the payments to the Watergate defendants earlier than this conversation. Nixon's conversation with Haldeman on August 1, 1972, is one of several that establishes he did. Nixon said: "Well&amp;nbsp;... they have to be paid. That's all there is to that. They have to be paid."&lt;ref&gt;Kutler, S: ''Abuse of Power'', page 111. Simon &amp; Schuster, 1997. Transcribed conversation between President Nixon and Haldeman.&lt;/ref&gt; During the congressional debate on impeachment, some believed that impeachment required a criminally indictable offense. Nixon's agreement to make the blackmail payments was regarded as an affirmative act to obstruct justice.&lt;ref name=woodward&gt;Bernstein, C. and Woodward, B: ''The Final Days'', p. 252. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 7, 1973, investigators found that an [[18½ minute gap|{{frac|18|1|2}}-minute portion]] of one recorded tape had been erased. [[Rose Mary Woods]], Nixon's longtime personal secretary, said she had accidentally erased the tape by pushing the wrong pedal on her tape player when answering the phone. The press ran photos of the set-up, showing that it was unlikely for Woods to answer the phone while keeping her foot on the pedal. Later [[forensic]] analysis in 2003 determined that the tape had been erased in several segments—at least five, and perhaps as many as nine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Clymer |first=Adam |title=National Archives Has Given Up on Filling the Nixon Tape Gap |work=The New York Times |date=May 9, 2003 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/09/us/national-archives-has-given-up-on-filling-the-nixon-tape-gap.html |accessdate=January 17, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5sPqUFNJO?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/09/us/national-archives-has-given-up-on-filling-the-nixon-tape-gap.html |archivedate=September 1, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nixon's position was becoming increasingly precarious. On February 6, 1974, the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] approved {{USBill|93|H.

The Committee recommended the second article, [[abuse of power]], on July 29, 1974. The next day, on July 30, 1974, the Committee recommended the third article: [[contempt of Congress]]. On August 20, 1974, the House authorized the printing of the Committee report H. Rep. 93–1305, which included the text of the resolution impeaching Nixon and set forth articles of impeachment against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{USCongRec|1974|H29219}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title= Impeachment: An Overview of Constitutional Provisions, Procedure, and Practice | first= Elizabeth B | last= Bazan | date= December 9, 2010 | work= [[Congressional Research Service reports]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Smoking Gun" tape ===
[[File:Nixon Oval Office meeting with H.R. Haldeman "Smoking Gun" Conversation June 23, 1972.wav|thumb|Nixon Oval Office meeting with H.R. Haldeman "Smoking Gun" Conversation June 23, 1972 [https://www.nixonlibrary.gov/forresearchers/find/tapes/watergate/trial/exhibit_01.pdf Full Transcript]]]

On August 5, 1974, the White House released a previously unknown audio tape from June 23, 1972. Recorded only a few days after the break-in, it documented the initial stages of the cover-up: it revealed Nixon and Haldeman had conducted a meeting in the Oval Office where they discussed how to stop the FBI from continuing their investigation of the break-in, as they recognised that there was a high risk that their position in the scandal may be revealed.

Haldeman introduced the topic as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... the Democratic break-in thing, we're back to the—in the, the problem area because the FBI is not under control, because [[L. Patrick Gray|Gray]] doesn't exactly know how to control them, and they have&amp;nbsp;... their investigation is now leading into some productive areas&amp;nbsp;... and it goes in some directions we don't want it to go.&lt;ref name="haldeman6.23.72"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After explaining how the money from CRP was traced to the burglars, Haldeman explained to Nixon the cover-up plan: "the way to handle this now is for us to have Walters [CIA] call Pat Gray [FBI] and just say, 'Stay the hell out of this&amp;nbsp;... this is ah, business here we don't want you to go any further on it.'"&lt;ref name="haldeman6.23.72"/&gt;

Nixon approved the plan, and after he was given more information about the involvement of his campaign in the break-in, he told Haldeman: "All right, fine, I understand it all. We won't second-guess Mitchell and the rest." Returning to the use of the CIA to obstruct the FBI, he instructed Haldeman: "You call them in. Good. Good deal. Play it tough. That's the way they play it and that's the way we are going to play it."&lt;ref name="haldeman6.23.72"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nixonlibrary.gov/forresearchers/find/tapes/watergate/wspf/741-002.pdf |title="Transcript of a Recording of a Meeting Between the President and H.R.

Nixon denied that this constituted an obstruction of justice, as his instructions ultimately resulted in the CIA truthfully reporting to the FBI that there were no national security issues. Nixon urged the FBI to press forward with the investigation when they expressed concern about interference.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=4320&amp;st=&amp;st1= Statement Announcing Availability of Additional Transcripts of Presidential Tape Recordings] August 5, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the release of this tape, Nixon had denied any involvement in the scandal. He claimed that there were no political motivations in his instructions to the CIA, and claimed he had no knowledge before March 21, 1973, of involvement by senior campaign officials such as [[John N. Mitchell|John Mitchell]]. The contents of this tape persuaded Nixon's own lawyers, [[Fred Buzhardt]] and [[James D. St. Clair|James St. Clair]], that "the President had lied to the nation, to his closest aides, and to his own lawyers—for more than two years."&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein and Woodward (1976): ''The Final Days'', p. 309&lt;/ref&gt; The tape, which [[Barber Conable]] referred to as a "[[Watergate tapes#The "smoking gun" tape|smoking gun]]," proved that Nixon had been involved in the cover-up from the beginning.

In the week before Nixon's resignation, Ehrlichman and Haldeman tried unsuccessfully to get Nixon to grant them pardons—which he had promised them before their April 1973 resignations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,908732-8,00.html |title=The Administration: The Fallout from Ford's Rush to Pardon|work=Time  |date=September 23, 1974 |accessdate=July 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The release of the [[Nixon White House tapes#The "smoking gun" tape|"smoking gun" tape]] destroyed Nixon politically. The ten congressmen who had voted against all three articles of impeachment in the House Judiciary Committee announced they would all support the impeachment article accusing Nixon of obstructing justice when the articles came up before the full House.&lt;ref name=graham&gt;Katharine Graham, ''Personal History'' (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1997), p. 495.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of August 7, 1974, Senators [[Barry Goldwater]] and [[Hugh Scott]] and Congressman [[John Jacob Rhodes]] met with Nixon in the Oval Office. Scott and Rhodes were the Republican leaders in the Senate and House, respectively; Goldwater was brought along as an elder statesman. The three lawmakers told Nixon that his support in Congress had all but disappeared. Rhodes told Nixon that he would face certain impeachment when the articles came up for vote in the full House. Goldwater and Scott told the president that there were enough votes in the Senate to convict him, and that no more than 15 Senators were willing to vote for acquittal.

Realizing that he had no chance of staying in office and that [[public opinion]] was not in his favor, Nixon decided to resign.&lt;ref name=schmidt&gt;{{citation|quote=In 1974, President Richard Nixon resigned in the wake of a scandal when it was obvious that public opinion no longer supported him.|title=American Government and Politics Today, 2013–2014 Edition|authorlink1=Steffen Schmidt|first=Steffen W.|last=Schmidt|publisher=Wadsworth Publishing|year=2013|isbn=978-1133602132|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[s:Richard Nixon's resignation speech|nationally televised address]] from the Oval Office on the evening of August 8, 1974, the president said, in part:

{{quote|In all the decisions I have made in my public life, I have always tried to do what was best for the Nation. Throughout the long and difficult period of Watergate, I have felt it was my duty to persevere, to make every possible effort to complete the term of office to which you elected me. In the past few days, however, it has become evident to me that I no longer have a strong enough political base in the Congress to justify continuing that effort. As long as there was such a base, I felt strongly that it was necessary to see the constitutional process through to its conclusion, that to do otherwise would be unfaithful to the spirit of that deliberately difficult process and a dangerously destabilizing precedent for the future….

I would have preferred to carry through to the finish whatever the personal agony it would have involved, and my family unanimously urged me to do so. But the interest of the Nation must always come before any personal considerations. From the discussions I have had with Congressional and other leaders, I have concluded that because of the Watergate matter I might not have the support of the Congress that I would consider necessary to back the very difficult decisions and carry out the duties of this office in the way the interests of the Nation would require.

''I have never been a quitter''. To leave office before my term is completed is abhorrent to every instinct in my body. But as President, I must put the interest of America first. America needs a full-time President and a full-time Congress, particularly at this time with problems we face at home and abroad. To continue to fight through the months ahead for my personal vindication would almost totally absorb the time and attention of both the President and the Congress in a period when our entire focus should be on the great issues of peace abroad and prosperity without inflation at home. Therefore, I shall resign the Presidency effective at noon tomorrow. Vice President Ford will be sworn in as President at that hour in this office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/character/links/nixon_speech.html|title=President Nixon's Resignation Speech|accessdate=August 29, 2009|website=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The morning that his resignation took effect, the President, with Mrs. Nixon and their family, said farewell to the White House staff in the [[East Room]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5593631/ns/us_news-nixon_anniversary/|title=Politicians come and go, but rule of law endures|author=Brokaw, Tom|date=August 6, 2004|accessdate=August 29, 2009|work=MSNBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; A helicopter carried them from the White House to [[Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland|Andrews Air Force Base]] in [[Maryland]]. Nixon later wrote that he thought, "As the helicopter moved on to Andrews, I found myself thinking not of the past, but of the future. What could I do now?" At Andrews, he and his family boarded Air Force One to [[El Toro Marine Corps Air Station]] in California, and then were transported to his home [[La Casa Pacifica]] in [[San Clemente, California|San Clemente]].

With Nixon's resignation, Congress dropped its impeachment proceedings. Criminal prosecution was still a possibility both on the federal and state level.&lt;ref name=TimeLegal/&gt; Nixon was [[Inauguration of Gerald Ford|succeeded by]] Vice President [[Gerald Ford]] as President, who on September 8, 1974, issued a full and unconditional [[pardon]] of Nixon, immunizing him from prosecution for any crimes he had "committed or may have committed or taken part in" as president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ford.utexas.edu/LIBRARY/speeches/740061.htm |title=Gerald Ford's Proclamation Granting a Pardon to Richard Nixon |website=Ford.utexas.edu |accessdate=June 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a televised broadcast to the nation, Ford explained that he felt the pardon was in the best interest of the country. He said that the Nixon family's situation "is an American tragedy in which we all have played a part. It could go on and on and on, or someone must write the end to it. I have concluded that only I can do that, and if I can, I must."&lt;ref name="pardonspeech2"&gt;{{cite web | last = Ford | first = Gerald | date = September 8, 1974 | url = http://www.historyplace.com/speeches/ford.htm| title =Gerald R.

Nixon proclaimed his innocence until his death in 1994. In his official response to the pardon, he said that he "was wrong in not acting more decisively and more forthrightly in dealing with Watergate, particularly when it reached the stage of judicial proceedings and grew from a political scandal into a national tragedy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fulton|first=Mary Lou |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-07-17/news/ss-339_1_richard-nixon/2 |title=Nixon Library : Nixon Timeline – Page 2 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=July 17, 1990 |accessdate=July 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators have argued that pardoning Nixon contributed to President Ford's loss of the [[United States presidential election, 1976|presidential election of 1976]].&lt;ref name="shanescott"&gt;{{cite news |first= Scott |last= Shane |title= For Ford, Pardon Decision Was Always Clear-Cut|work=The New York Times |page= A1 |date=December 29, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Allegations of a secret deal made with Ford, promising a pardon in return for Nixon's resignation, led Ford to testify before the [[House Judiciary Committee]] on October 17, 1974.&lt;ref name="Gettlin, Robert; Colodny, Len 1991 420"&gt;{{cite book

In his autobiography ''A Time to Heal'', Ford wrote about a meeting he had with Nixon's Chief of Staff, [[Alexander Haig]]. Haig was explaining what he and Nixon's staff thought were Nixon's only options. He could try to ride out the impeachment and fight against conviction in the Senate all the way, or he could resign. His options for resigning were to delay his resignation until further along in the impeachment process, to try and settle for a censure vote in Congress, or to pardon himself and then resign. Haig told Ford that some of Nixon's staff suggested that Nixon could agree to resign in return for an agreement that Ford would pardon him.

{{quote|source=|Haig emphasized that these weren't ''his'' suggestions. He didn't identify the staff members and he made it very clear that he wasn't recommending any one option over another. What he wanted to know was whether or not my overall assessment of the situation agreed with his. [emphasis in original]&amp;nbsp;... Next he asked if I had any suggestions as to courses of actions for the President. I didn't think it would be proper for me to make any recommendations at all, and I told him so.|[[Gerald Ford]], ''A Time to Heal''&lt;ref&gt;Ford (1979), 4.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Aftermath ==

=== Final legal actions and effect on the law profession ===
[[Charles Colson]] pled guilty to charges concerning the [[Daniel Ellsberg#Fielding break-in|Daniel Ellsberg]] case; in exchange, the indictment against him for covering up the activities of the [[Committee to Re-elect the President]] was dropped, as it was against Strachan. The remaining five members of the Watergate Seven indicted in March went on trial in October 1974.  On January 1, 1975, all but Parkinson were found guilty. In 1976, the U.S. Court of Appeals ordered a new trial for Mardian; subsequently, all charges against him were dropped.

Haldeman, Ehrlichman, and Mitchell exhausted their appeals in 1977. Ehrlichman entered prison in 1976, followed by the other two in 1977.  Since Nixon and many senior officials involved in Watergate were lawyers, the scandal severely tarnished the public image of the legal profession.&lt;ref&gt;Anita L. Allen, ''The New Ethics: A Tour of the 21st Century Landscape'' (New York: Miramax Books, 2004), 101.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas L. Shaffer &amp; Mary M.

To defuse public demand for direct federal regulation of lawyers (as opposed to leaving it in the hands of state [[bar associations]] or courts), the [[American Bar Association]] (ABA) launched two major reforms. First, the ABA decided that its existing [[American Bar Association Model Code of Professional Responsibility|Model Code of Professional Responsibility]] (promulgated 1969) was a failure. In 1983 it replaced it with the [[American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct|Model Rules of Professional Conduct]].&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Schneyer, "Professionalism as Politics: The Making of a Modern Legal Ethics Code", in ''Lawyers' Ideals/Lawyers' Practices: Transformations in the American Legal Profession'', eds. Robert L. Nelson, David M. Trubek, &amp; Rayman L. Solomon, 95–143 (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1992), 104.&lt;/ref&gt; The MRPC have been adopted in part or in whole by 49 states (and is being considered{{when|date=January 2018}} by the last one, California). Its preamble contains an emphatic reminder that the legal profession can remain self-governing only if lawyers behave properly. Second, the ABA promulgated a requirement that law students at ABA-approved [[law school]]s take a course in [[professional responsibility]] (which means they must study the MRPC). The requirement remains in effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=American Bar Association|title=ABA Standards and Rules of Procedure for Approval of Law Schools 2015–2016|date=2015|publisher=American Bar Association|location=Chicago|isbn=978-1-63425-352-9|page=16|url=http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publications/misc/legal_education/Standards/2015_2016_aba_standards_for_approval_of_law_schools_final.authcheckdam.pdf|accessdate=15 December 2016|chapter=Standard 303, Curriculum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 24 and 25, 1975, Nixon gave secret testimony to a [[grand jury]]. According to news reports at the time, Nixon answered questions about the {{frac|18|1|2}}-minute tape gap, altering White House tape transcripts turned over to the House Judiciary Committee, using the [[Internal Revenue Service]] to harass political enemies, and a $100,000 contribution from billionaire [[Howard Hughes]]. Aided by the [[Public Citizen Litigation Group]], the historian [[Stanley Kutler]], who has written several books about Nixon and Watergate and had successfully sued for the 1996 public release of the [[Nixon White House tapes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.wisc.edu/20004|title=Historian's work gives a glimpse of Nixon "unplugged" |date=November 8, 2011|accessdate=September 30, 2014|website=University of Wisconsin-Madison}}&lt;/ref&gt; sued for release of the transcripts of the Nixon grand jury testimony.&lt;ref name=Secret/&gt;

On July 29, 2011, U.S. District Judge [[Royce Lamberth]] granted Kutler's request, saying historical interests trumped privacy, especially considering that Nixon and other key figures were deceased, and most of the surviving figures had testified under oath, have been written about, or were interviewed. The transcripts were not immediately released pending the government's decision on whether to appeal.&lt;ref name=Secret&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/07/29/us-nixon-watergate-idUSTRE76S4ZH20110729 "Nixon's secret Watergate testimony ordered released"], Reuters, July 29, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; They were released in their entirety on November 10, 2011, although the names of people still alive were redacted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nixon's long-secret grand jury testimony released |author=Kim Geiger |date=November 10, 2011 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-nixon-testimony-20111110,0,6436502.story |accessdate=November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political and cultural reverberations ===
According to Thomas J. Johnson, a professor of journalism at [[University of Texas at Austin]], Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]] predicted during Nixon's final days that history would remember Nixon as a great president and that Watergate would be relegated to a "minor footnote."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas J. Johnson, ''Watergate and the Resignation of Richard Nixon: Impact of a Constitutional Crisis'', "The Rehabilitation of Richard Nixon", eds. P. Jeffrey and Thomas Maxwell-Long: Washington, D.C., CO. Press, 2004, pp. 148–149.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Congress investigated the scope of the president's legal powers, it belatedly found that consecutive presidential administrations had declared the United States to be in a continuous open-ended [[state of emergency]] since 1950. Congress enacted the [[National Emergencies Act]] in 1976 to regulate such declarations. The Watergate scandal left such an impression on the national and international consciousness that many scandals since then have been labeled with the suffix "[[List of scandals with "-gate" suffix|-gate]]."

[[File:1976 campaign button f.JPG|thumb|One of a variety of anti-Ford [[Pin-back button|buttons]] generated during the 1976 presidential election: it reads "Gerald&amp;nbsp;... Pardon me!" and depicts a thief cracking a safe labeled "Watergate".]]

Disgust with the revelations about Watergate, the Republican Party, and Nixon strongly affected results of the November 1974 [[United States Senate elections, 1974|Senate]] and [[United States House election, 1974|House elections]], which took place three months after Nixon's resignation. The Democrats gained five seats in the Senate and forty-nine in the House (the newcomers were nicknamed "[[Watergate Babies]]"). Congress passed legislation that changed [[Campaign finance in the United States|campaign financing]], to amend the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]], as well as to require financial disclosures by key government officials (via the [[Ethics in Government Act]]). Other types of disclosures, such as releasing recent income tax forms, became expected, though not legally required. Presidents since [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] had recorded many of their conversations but the practice purportedly ended after Watergate.

Ford's pardon of Nixon played a major role in his defeat in the [[United States presidential election, 1976|1976 presidential election]] against [[Jimmy Carter]].&lt;ref name="shanescott" /&gt;

In 1977, Nixon arranged [[The Nixon Interviews|an interview]] with British journalist [[David Frost]] in the hopes of improving his legacy. Based on a previous interview in 1968,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,947901-2,00.html|title = The Nation: David Can Be a Goliath|date = May 9, 1977|work = Time|access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; he believed that Frost would be an easy interviewer and was taken aback by Frost's incisive questions. The interview displayed the entire scandal to the American people, and Nixon formally apologized, but his legacy remained tarnished.&lt;ref name="NYTimes David Frost"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stelter|first1=Brian|title=David Frost, Interviewer Who Got Nixon to Apologize for Watergate, Dies at 74|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/02/world/europe/david-frost-known-for-nixon-interview-dead-at-74.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=November 25, 2014|work=The New York Times|date=September 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of Watergate, "[[follow the money]]" became part of the American lexicon and is widely believed to have been uttered by Mark Felt to Woodward and Bernstein. The phrase was never used in the 1974 book ''[[All the President's Men]]'' and did not become associated with it until the [[All the President's Men (film)|movie of the same name]] was released in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;"Follow The Money: On The Trail Of Watergate Lore," NPR, June 16, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The parking garage where Woodward and Felt met in Rosslyn still stands. Its significance was noted by Arlington County with a historical marker in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.arlnow.com/2011/08/17/historical-marker-installed-outside-deep-throat-garage/|title=Historical Marker Installed Outside 'Deep Throat' Garage|date=17 August 2011|accessdate=23 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=55498|title=Watergate Investigation Historical Marker|accessdate=23 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 it was announced that the garage would be demolished as part of construction of an apartment building on the site; the developers announced that the site's significance would be memorialized within the new complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/parking-garage-where-deep-throat-spilled-beans-watergate-being-torn-down-180961733/?q=|title=The Parking Garage Where Deep Throat Spilled the Beans on Watergate Is Being Torn Down|first=Danny|last=Lewis|accessdate=23 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/watergate-parking-garage-to-be-torn-down-1402874716|title=Watergate Parking Garage to Be Torn Down|first=Kris|last=Maher|date=20 June 2014|accessdate=23 January 2018|via=www.wsj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose of the break-in ==
Despite the enormous impact of the Watergate scandal, the purpose of the break-in of the DNC offices has never been conclusively established. Records from the ''United States v. Liddy'' trial, made public in 2013, showed that four of the five burglars testified that they were told the campaign operation hoped to find evidence that linked Cuban funding to Democratic campaigns.&lt;ref name=baldwinlist&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/16/watergate-records_n_3606339.html|title=Watergate Records Released 40 Years After Being Filed Under Seal|author=Jessica Gresko, Associated Press|work=The Huffington Post|date=July 16, 2013|accessdate=September 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The longtime hypothesis suggests that the target of the break-in was the offices of [[Larry O'Brien]], the DNC Chairman.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Baldwin III's list of targets that was released in 2013.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Among those listed were senior DNC official [[R. Spencer Oliver]], Oliver's secretary Ida "Maxine" Wells, co-worker Robert Allen and secretary Barbara Kennedy.&lt;ref name=baldwinlist /&gt;

Based on these revelations, [[Texas A&amp;M]] history professor Luke Nichter, who had successfully petitioned for the release of the information,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/sites/dcd/files/12-mc-74_memorandum_opinion.pdf|title=In Re: Petition of Luke Nitcher|author=Senior Judge Royce Lamberth|website=United States District Court for the District of Columbia|date=June 11, 2013|accessdate=September 9, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910195819/http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/sites/dcd/files/12-mc-74_memorandum_opinion.pdf|archivedate=September 10, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that Woodward and Bernstein were incorrect in concluding, based largely on Watergate burglar James McCord's word, that the purpose of the break-in was to bug O'Brien's phone to gather political and financial intelligence on the Democrats.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Instead, Nichter sided with late journalist [[J. Anthony Lukas]] of the ''New York Times'', who had concluded that the committee was seeking to find evidence linking the Democrats to prostitution, as it was alleged that Oliver's office had been used to arrange such meetings. However, Nichter acknowledged that Woodward and Bernstein's theory of O'Brien as the target could not be debunked unless information was released about what Baldwin heard in his bugging of conversations.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In 1968, O'Brien was appointed by Vice President [[Hubert Humphrey]] to serve as the national director of Humphrey's presidential campaign and, separately, by [[Howard Hughes]] to serve as Hughes' public-policy lobbyist in Washington. O'Brien was elected national chairman of the DNC in 1968 and 1970. In late 1971, the president's brother, [[Donald Nixon]], was collecting intelligence for his brother at the time and asked [[John H. Meier]], an adviser to Howard Hughes, about O'Brien. In 1956, Donald Nixon had borrowed $205,000 from Howard Hughes and had never repaid the loan. The loan's existence surfaced during the [[United States presidential election, 1960|1960 presidential election]] campaign, embarrassing Richard Nixon and becoming a political liability. According to author Donald M. Bartlett, Richard Nixon would do whatever was necessary to prevent another family embarrassment.&lt;ref&gt;Donald L. Bartlett, ''Howard Hughes'', p. 410, W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 2004 {{ISBN|978-0-393-32602-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1968 to 1970, Hughes withdrew nearly half a million dollars from the Texas National Bank of Commerce for contributions to both Democrats and Republicans, including presidential candidates Humphrey and Nixon. Hughes wanted Donald Nixon and Meier involved but Nixon opposed this.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Higham ''Howard Hughes'', p. 244, Macmillan, 2004 {{ISBN|978-0-312-32997-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meier told Donald that he was sure the Democrats would win the election because they had considerable information on Richard Nixon's illicit dealings with Hughes that had never been released, and that it resided with Larry O'Brien.&lt;ref&gt;DuBois, Larry, and Laurence Gonzales (September 1976). "Hughes, Nixon and the C.I.A.: The Watergate Conspiracy Woodward and Bernstein Missed," ''Playboy''&lt;/ref&gt; According to Fred Emery, O'Brien had been a lobbyist for Hughes in a Democrat-controlled Congress, and the possibility of his finding out about Hughes' illegal contributions to the Nixon campaign was too much of a danger for Nixon to ignore.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Emery ''Watergate'', p. 30, Simon &amp; Schuster, 1995 {{ISBN|978-0-684-81323-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James F. Neal]], who prosecuted the Watergate 7, did not believe Nixon had ordered the break-in because of Nixon's surprised reaction when he was told about it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,917056,00.html |title=The Nation: It Goes Back to the Big Man Time Magazine January 13, 1975 issue |work=Time |date=January 13, 1975 |accessdate=July 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
Australian [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Gough Whitlam]] criticised the Watergate scandal during [[Question Time]] in May 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Unholy Fury review|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/unholy-fury-review-insightful-account-of-whitlamnixon-spat-20150525-gh2mr9.html|date=May 15, 2015|accessdate=August 7, 2017|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just two years later, in November 1975, Australia experienced its own [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis|constitutional crisis]] which led to the dismissal of Whitlam by the Australian Governor-General, [[Sir John Kerr]].

In August 1973, then-[[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Kakuei Tanaka]] said that the scandal had "no cancelling influence on U.S. leadership in the world."

===Singapore===
Then-[[Prime Minister of Singapore|Prime Minister]] [[Lee Kuan Yew]] said in August 1973, "As one surprising revelation follows another at the Senate hearings on Watergate, it becomes increasingly clear that the District of Columbia (Washington D.C.), today is in no position to offer the moral or strong political and economic leadership for which its friends and allies are yearning."&lt;ref name=Spartanburg&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XoQsAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ds0EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7342%2C834424 |title=Watergate Comes Out into Open at Foreign Parley |date=August 5, 1973 |page=A8 |work=[[Spartanburg Herald-Journal]] |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=November 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Lee said that the scandal may have led the United States to lessen its interests and commitments in world affairs, to weaken its ability to enforce the [[Paris Peace Accords]] on Vietnam, and to not react to violations of the Accords. Lee said further that the United States "makes the future of this peace in [[Indonesia]] an extremely bleak one with grave consequence for the contiguous states." Lee then blamed the scandal for economic inflation in Singapore because the [[Singapore dollar]] was pegged to the [[United States dollar]] at the time, assuming the U.S. dollar was stronger than the British [[pound sterling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Watergate may sap U.S. power |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=A5EjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6qEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3593%2C1690124 |work=[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]] |location=Montreal |date=August 8, 1973 |page=2 |accessdate=November 23, 2014 |via=Google News Archive }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It would be completely indecent for me to refer to it. ... My attitude toward Mr. Nixon is of very great respect." When one reporter suggested that Nixon and his position with Brezhnev were "weakened" by the scandal, Brezhnev replied, "It does not enter my mind to think whether Mr. Nixon has lost or gained any influence because of the affair." Then he said further that he had respected Nixon because of Nixon's "realistic and constructive approach to [[Soviet Union–United States relations]] ... passing from an era of confrontation to an era of negotiations between nations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XTkoAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yigEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7434%2C4352706 |title=Brezhnev to Shun Talk of Watergate |work=[[The Milwaukee Journal]] |date=June 15, 1973 |at=Part 1, page 3 |accessdate=November 23, 2014 |via=Google News Archive }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
Talks between Nixon and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Edward Heath]] may have been bugged. Heath did not publicly display his anger, with aides saying that he was unconcerned about having been bugged at the White House. According to officials, Heath commonly had notes taken of his public discussions with Nixon so a recording would not have bothered him. However, officials privately said that if private talks with Nixon were bugged, then Heath would be outraged. Even so, Heath was privately outraged over being taped without his prior knowledge.&lt;ref name="Heath's reaction Maine Newspaper"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gavshon |first=Arthur L.|authorlink=Arthur Gavshon |date=July 18, 1973 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=yHsgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=sWcFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1093%2C2199417 |title=Britain's Leader Shows Restraint Over Bugging |newspaper=The Lewiston Daily Sun |accessdate=November 25, 2014 |via=Google News Archive }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other international reactions===
Iranian then-Shah [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] told the press in 1973, "I want to say quite emphatically ... that everything that would weaken or jeopardize the President's power to make decisions in split seconds would represent grave danger for the whole world."&lt;ref name=Freed1973/&gt; An unnamed Kenyan senior official of [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Kenya)|Foreign Affairs Ministry]] accused Nixon of lacking interest in Africa and its politics and then said, "American President is so enmeshed in domestic problems created by Watergate that foreign policy seems suddenly to have taken a {{sic|back seat}}."&lt;ref name=Freed1973/&gt; Cuban then-leader [[Fidel Castro]] said in his December 1974 interview that, of the crimes committed by the Cuban exiles, like killings, attacks on Cuban ports, and spying, the Watergate burglaries and wiretappings were "probably the least of [them]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HYc1AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=nesFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4339%2C455617 |title=Fidel says Watergate least of exiles' crimes |newspaper=[[The Miami News]] |page=2A |date=December 2, 1974 |agency=[[Reuters]] |accessdate=November 23, 2014 |via=Google News Archive }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domestic reactions===
After the [[fall of Saigon]] ended the Vietnam War, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said in May 1975 that, if the scandal had not caused Nixon to resign, and Congress had not overridden Nixon's veto of the [[War Powers Resolution]], [[North Vietnam]] would not have captured [[South Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The name-calling in the wake of defeat |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=soMuAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=e30FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1077%2C746828 |date=May 6, 1975 |work=[[New Straits Times]] |location=Malaysia |accessdate=November 23, 2014 |via=Google News Archive }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kissinger told the [[National Press Club (United States)|National Press Club]] in January 1977 that Nixon's presidential powers weakened during his tenure, (rephrased by the media) "prevent[ing] the United States from exploiting the [scandal]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kFwqAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=AlcEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1509%2C3522410 |title=Scandal Hurt Policy—Kissinger |newspaper=The Pittsburgh Press |agency=United Press International |date=January 11, 1977 |page=A-4 |accessdate=November 21, 2016 |via=Google News }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The publisher of ''[[The Sacramento Union]]'', John P. McGoff, said in January 1975 that the media overemphasized the scandal, though he called it "an important issue," overshadowing more serious topics, like a declining economy and an [[1970s energy crisis|energy crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=75Q1AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=JTIHAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3236%2C2592713 |title=Publisher criticizes the media |newspaper=Lodi News-Sentinel |agency=United Press International |date=January 30, 1975 |accessdate=October 24, 2015 |via=Google News Archive }}&lt;/ref&gt;
