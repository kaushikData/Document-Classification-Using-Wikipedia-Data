The '''2010 [[National Hot Rod Association|NHRA]] Full Throttle Drag Racing Season''' ran from February 11 to November 14, 2010. A variety of new [[National Hot Rod Association#Safety|safety]] rules were implemented following the conclusion of the investigation of the [[Scott Kalitta]] death in 2008. The NHRA had planned on returning Top Fuel and Funny Car classes to {{convert|1320|ft|m|abbr=on}} distances; however, racing in those classes remained at {{convert|1000|ft|m|abbr=on}} distance to contain costs with the United States economy still in recession, as well as to address ongoing safety concerns.

There were 23 Top Fuel, Funny Car, and Pro Stock car events, and 17 Pro Stock Motorcycle events.

==Schedule==
With the closure of the Memphis Motorsports Park as of 30 October 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dovermotorsports.com/track/press/article.php?dir=200910&amp;id=3283 | title=

 | date=2009-10-30 | accessdate = 2009-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Full Throttle Series is now slated for 23 events:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.nhra.com/schedules/2010fts.aspx| title= 2010 NHRA Full Throttle Drag Racing Series schedule| accessdate= 2009-11-01| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091210163117/http://www.nhra.com/schedules/2010fts.aspx| archivedate= 2009-12-10| deadurl= yes| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Virginia NHRA Nationals has also been eliminated, as Virginia Motorsports Park chose to align with rival [[Kenneth Feld]]'s [[International Hot Rod Association]] instead (many tracks changed sanctioning, owing to their sportsman classes).  A second race at [[Charlotte Motor Speedway|zMax Dragway]], the Four Wide Nationals, was added.

** Race Two:  4, 5, 12, 13
** Race Three:  2, 7, 10, 15
** Race Four:  3, 6, 11, 14
** Semifinal One:  Top two in Race One and Race Two
** Semifinal Two:  Top two in Race Three and Race Four
** Finals:  Top two in Semifinal One and Semifinal Two
* Lane choice determined by times in previous round.  In first round, lane choice determined by fastest times.
* Drivers who advance in Rounds One and Two will receive 20 points for each round advancement.
* In Round Three, the winner of the race will be declared the race winner and will collect 40 points.  The runner-up will receive 20 points.  Third and fourth place drivers will be credited as semifinal losers.

After 47 years as a driver and owner, [[Don Prudhomme]] announced his retirement from the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dovermotorsports.com/track/press/article.php?dir=200910&amp;id=3283|title=Prudhomme announces retirement from drag racing|date=2010-01-07|accessdate=2010-02-22|work=nhra.com|publisher=[[National Hot Rod Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Funny car driver [[Mike Neff]] stepped down as driver to become co-crew chief for [[John Force]], the other crew chief is [[Austin Coil]].

In the first round at Arizona, [[Antron Brown]] lost a wheel and crashed into the wall. Although Brown was uninjured in the accident, the wheel struck a female spectator who was killed.

==== Greece ====
* After a failed attack on the rebellious island of [[Naxos Island|Naxos]] in [[502 BC]] (on behalf of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]]), [[Aristagoras]], to save himself from the [[Anger|wrath]] of Persia, plans a revolt with the [[Miletus|Milesians]] and the other Ionians. With the encouragement of [[Histiaeus]] (his father-in-law and former tyrant of [[Miletus]]), [[Aristagoras]], governor of [[Miletus]], induces the Ionian cities of [[Asia Minor]] to revolt against Persia, thus instigating the [[Ionian Revolt]] and beginning the [[Greco-Persian Wars]] between [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and Persia. The pro-Persian tyrant of [[Mytilene]] is stoned to death.
* [[Miltiades the Younger]], the ruler of the [[Thracian Chersonese]], which has been under Persian [[suzerainty]] since approximately [[514 BC]], joins the Ionian revolt. He seizes the islands of [[Lemnos]] and [[Imbros]] from the Persians.
* Aristagoras seeks help with the revolt against the Persians from [[Cleomenes I]], king of [[Sparta]], but the Spartans are unwilling to respond.

'''The Abbottabad Commission''' was a [[Supreme Court of Pakistan|judicial]] inquiry commissioned to provide reports on the circumstantial events leading up to the [[United States]] decision to take [[Operation Neptune Spear|unilateral]] military actions in [[Abbottabad]] in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province]] of [[Pakistan]], with the objective of neutralizing [[al-Qaeda]] leader [[Osama bin Laden]] on May 2, 2011.&lt;ref name="dawn20121208"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dawn.com/2012/12/08/abbottabad-commission-completes-report-on-osama-killing/|title=Abbottabad Commission completes probe report on Osama killing|date=8 December 2012|work=Dawn|accessdate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Constituted by the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan|Supreme Court]] of Pakistan on the request of the [[Government of Pakistan|Government]] of Pakistan on 21 June 2011, the commission was chaired by the [[List of Justices of the Supreme Court of Pakistan|Senior Justice]] [[Javaid Iqbal]] and other members selected by the supreme court.

The Commission critically evaluated and provided analysis on "ascertain full facts regarding the presence of Osama bin Laden in Pakistan" and thoroughly "investigated circumstances and facts regarding the American operation in Abbottabad on 2 May 2011." The commission extensively interviewed local residents of Abbottabad, government ministers, military officials, and investigative espionage journalists.

The Commission's [[Abbottabad Report|final report]] included 300 witnesses and reviewed 3,000 official documents over two years. The final report was based on public testimonies and was prepared by the Senior Justice Javid Iqbal. The reports were submitted to Prime Minister [[Raja Pervez Ashraf|Pervez Ashraf]] on January 2013 and were marked as "classified" by the government. No details were made public despite the requests of officials. By early 2012, only a few portions were released to the media. The [[Abbottabad Commission Report]] was released by [[Al Jazeera]] on 8 July 2013.&lt;ref name="AlJaz20130708"&gt;{{cite web|last=HAshim|first=Asad|title=Leaked report shows bin Laden's 'hidden life'|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2013/07/20137813412615531.html|publisher=Al Jazeera English|accessdate=8 July 2013|date=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political response===

The conservative party, [[Pakistan Muslim League (N)|Pakistan Muslim League]] (PML), criticized the Prime Minister [[Yousaf Raza Gillani|Gillani]] for a failure to initiate a probe into the May [[Operation Neptune Spear|US incursion]] in accordance with the resolution adopted during the joint secret session of parliament.&lt;ref name="Express Tribune, 05/29/2011"&gt;{{cite news|last=Correspondent|title=PML-N pushes for Abbottabad raid probe|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/178214/pml-n-pushes-for-abbottabad-raid-probe/|accessdate=27 June 2013|newspaper=Express Tribune, 29 May 2011|date=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Prime Minister Gillani addressing his concerns to PML,&lt;ref name="Tex, 05/2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mannan|first=Abdul|title=Abbottabad probe: Independent commission only to fulfil formalities?|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/173151/abbottabad-probe-independent-commission-only-to-fulfil-formalities/|accessdate=27 June 2013|newspaper=Tex, 05/2012|date=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the party pushed for an independent commission to be formed.&lt;ref name="Express Tribune, 05/29/2011"/&gt; The PML persuasion was that "it did not want the [[Pakistan Armed Forces|armed forces]] to face another fiasco like the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|1971 war]] or the [[Kargil war|Kargil misadventure]].&lt;ref name="Tex, May 24th, 2011."&gt;{{cite news|last=Zaman|first=Kamar|title=Security breach: PML-N reiterates demand for independent commission|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/174707/security-breach-pml-n-reiterates-demand-for-independent-commission/|accessdate=27 June 2013|newspaper=Tex, 24 May 2011.|date=24 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alcohol advertising''' is the [[advertising|promotion]] of [[alcoholic beverage]]s by [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] producers through a variety of [[mass media|media]]. Along with [[tobacco advertising]], alcohol advertising is one of the most highly regulated forms of [[marketing]]. Some or all forms of alcohol advertising is banned in some countries. There have been some important studies about alcohol advertising published, such as J.P. Nelson's in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=51224 | title=Author Page for Jon P. Nelson | work=[[SSRN]] | accessdate=January 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientific research, health agencies and universities have, over the decades, been able to demonstrate a correlation between alcohol beverage advertising and alcohol consumption, especially among initially non-drinking youth.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grenard|first=Jerry L.|last2=Dent|first2=Clyde W.|last3=Stacy|first3=Alan W.|date=2013|title=Exposure to Alcohol Advertisements and Teenage Alcohol-Related Problems|journal=Pediatrics|volume=131|issue=2|pages=369–379|doi=10.1542/peds.2012-1480|pmc=3557408|pmid=23359585}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Snyder|first=Leslie B.|last2=Milici|first2=Frances Fleming|last3=Slater|first3=Michael|last4=Sun|first4=Helen|last5=Strizhakova|first5=Yuliya|date=2006|title=Effects of Alcohol Advertising Exposure on Drinking Among Youth|url=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/204410?resultClick=1|journal=Archives of Pediatrics &amp; Adolescent Medicine|language=en|volume=160|issue=1|pages=|doi=10.1001/archpedi.160.1.18|issn=1072-4710|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=P.|last2=Bruijn|first2=A. de|last3=Angus|first3=K.|last4=Gordon|first4=R.|last5=Hastings|first5=G.|date=2009|title=Impact of Alcohol Advertising and Media Exposure on Adolescent Alcohol Use: A Systematic Review of Longitudinal Studies|url=https://academic.oup.com/alcalc/article/44/3/229/178279|journal=Alcohol and Alcoholism|language=en|volume=44|issue=3|pages=229–243|doi=10.1093/alcalc/agn115|issn=0735-0414|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is an equally significant body of research positing that alcohol advertising does not ''cause'' higher consumption and rather merely reflects greater public demand, with many commentators suggesting that effective alcohol campaigns only increase a producer's market share and also brand loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;J.P. Nelson, "What is Learned from Longitudinal Studies of Advertising and Youth Drinking and Smoking?" International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 7(3), March 2010, pp.&amp;nbsp;870–926.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frankena, M., Cohen, M., Daniel, T., Ehrlich, L., Greenspun, N., and Kelman, D.

==Target marketing==
The [[target market|intended audience]] of the alcohol [[advertising campaign]]s have changed over the years, with some brands being specifically targeted towards a particular [[demographic profile|demographic]].  Some drinks are traditionally seen as a male drink, particularly [[beer]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2015/10/beer-still-perceived-as-a-mans-drink/|title=Beer Still 'Perceived as a Man's Drink'|last=Eads|first=Lauren|date=2015|website=The Drinks Business|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[whiskies]], while others are drunk by females.  Some brands have allegedly been specifically developed to appeal to people that would not normally drink that kind of beverage. These ads may contribute to underage consumption and binge drinking.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2011 a study found that twenty-two percent of twelfth graders had binge drank in the past two weeks,&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, L.

One area in which the alcohol industry has faced criticism and tightened legislation is in their alleged targeting of young people. Central to this is the development of [[alcopop]]s &amp;ndash; [[sweetness|sweet-tasting]], brightly coloured drinks with names that may appeal to a younger audience. However, numerous government and other reports have failed to support that allegation.&lt;ref name="Minors. Los Angeles Times 2006, pp. 357-69"&gt;(FTC Says Alcohol Type Not Aimed at Minors.

There have been several disputes over whether alcohol advertisements are targeting teens.  There happens to be heavy amounts of alcohol advertising that appears to make drinking fun and exciting.  Alcohol advertisements can be commonly seen in virtually any medium, they are especially known for sponsoring sporting events, concerts, magazines, and they are widely found on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.quitnow.gov.au/internet/anpha/publishing.nsf/Content/F641F67C6D6F52C5CA257C86001D5F19/$File/Alcohol%20Advertising%20DRAFT%20REPORT%20MASTER%20DOCUMENT%2020.2.14%20(D14-3314).pdf|title=Alcohol Advertising: The effectiveness of current regulatory codes in addressing community concern|last=|first=|date=2014|website=Australian National Preventative Health Agency|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the vendors’ websites require an age of 21 to enter, but there is no restriction besides simply entering a birth date. A study done by the [[American Journal of Public Health]] concluded that Boston train passengers between the ages of 11 and 18 saw an alcohol-related advertisement everyday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gentry|first=Elisabeth|last2=Poirier|first2=Katie|last3=Wilkinson|first3=Tiana|last4=Nhean|first4=Siphannay|last5=Nyborn|first5=Justin|last6=Siegel|first6=Michael|date=2011-10-01|title=Alcohol Advertising at Boston Subway Stations: An Assessment of Exposure by Race and Socioeconomic Status|url=http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2011.300159|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=101|issue=10|pages=1936–1941|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2011.300159|issn=0090-0036|pmc=3222337}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been studies similar to this, which supports the allegation that underage consumption of alcohol is in correlation with the exposure of alcohol ads.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In response, many cities have recognized the effect of alcohol-related ads on adolescents and in some cities these advertisements have been banned on public transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://adage.com/article/cmo-strategy/new-york-city-buses-trains-ban-alcohol-ads/311057/|title=As Alcohol Ads Sprawl Elsewhere, New York Buses and Trains Go Dry|last=Schultz|first=E.J.|date=2017|work=AdAge|access-date=2018-03-27|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is difficult to make definite allegations regarding youth exposure to these types of advertisements but it is necessary to find ways in which these allegations may be limited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?sid=115e9800-0c0b-4970-b6bd-ea87983bc2e4%40sessionmgr13&amp;vid=6&amp;hid=19&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#db=a9h&amp;AN=47513354 Web.ebscohost.com]. {{paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse reports the rates of binge alcohol use in 2008 were 1.5 percent among 12 or 13 years old, 6.9 percent among 14 or 15 years old, 17.2 percent among 16 or 17 years old, 33.7 percent among persons aged 18 to 20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report| author = Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration| date = 2009| title = Results from the 2008 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: National Findings| url = http://www.dpft.org/resources/NSDUHresults2008.pdf| publisher = Office of Applied Studies, NSDUH Series H-36, HHS Publication No. SMA 09-4434| publication-place = Rockville, MD| access-date = November 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the rates for each group of underage alcohol usage increased by a fourth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report| author = Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration| date = 2010| title = Results from the 2009 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: Volume I.

According to 2001 College Alcohol Study (CAS), continuous alcohol promotions and advertisements including lowering prices on certain types of alcohol on a college campus have increased the percentage of alcohol consumption of that college community. Alcohol advertising on college campuses have also shown to increase binge drinking among students. However, it is concluded that the consistency of these special promotions and ads could also be useful in reducing binge drinking and other related drinking problems on campus. (Kuo, 2000, [[Henry Wechsler|Wechsler]] 2000, Greenberg 2000, Lee 2000).&lt;ref&gt;

* Results from one study indicate that beer advertisements are a significant predictor of an adolescent's knowledge, preference, and loyalty for beer brands, as well as current drinking behavior and intentions to drink (Gentile, 2001).
* Television advertising changes attitudes about drinking.  Young people report more positive feelings about drinking and their own likelihood to drink after viewing alcohol ads (Austin, 1994; Grube, 1994).
* The alcohol industry spends $2 billion per year on all media advertising (Strasburger, 1999).
* The beer brewing industry itself spent more than $770 million on television ads and $15 million on radio ads in 2000 (Center for Science in the Public Interest, 2002).

Research clearly indicates that, in addition to parents and peers, alcohol advertising and marketing significantly affect youth decisions to drink. (The Center on Alcohol Marketing and Youth [CAMY]).

"While many factors may influence an underage person's drinking decisions, including among other things parents, peers and the media, there is reason to believe that advertising also plays a role." (Federal Trade Commission, Self-Regulation in the Alcohol Industry, 1999)

Parents and peers substantially affect youth decisions to drink. However, research clearly indicates that alcohol advertising and marketing also have a significant effect by influencing youth and adult expectations and attitudes, and helping to create an environment that promotes underage drinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.camy.org/resources/fact-sheets/alcohol-advertising-and-youth/index.html|title=Alcohol Advertising and Youth|last=Stephenson|first=Steve|website=Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though people these days must put themselves into that situation, David H. Jernigan (2005: 314) underlines how “more than fifteen percent of twelve-year-olds will be likely to create the situation where youth are more likely per capita to see the magazine than adults over twenty-one years, the legal drinking age in the United States”.

===Malt liquor===
{{Main|Malt liquor#Advertising}}

The target market for [[malt liquor]] in the United States has been among the [[African-American]] and [[Hispanic]] populations in cities. Advertisers use themes of power and sexual dominance to appeal to customers. Critics have objected to ads targeting this segment of the population, which suffers disproportionately high rates of alcohol-related illness and poor access to medical care.

=== Among adolescents ===
Peter Anderson and his colleagues performed longitudinal studies and concluded that “alcohol advertising and promotion increases the likelihood that adolescents will start to use alcohol, and to drink more if they are already using alcohol.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Peter|last2=Bruijn|first2=Avalon de|last3=Angus|first3=Kathryn|last4=Gordon|first4=Ross|last5=Hastings|first5=Gerard|date=2009-05-01|title=Impact of Alcohol Advertising and Media Exposure on Adolescent Alcohol Use: A Systematic Review of Longitudinal Studies|url=http://alcalc.oxfordjournals.org/content/44/3/229|journal=Alcohol and Alcoholism|language=en|volume=44|issue=3|pages=229–243|doi=10.1093/alcalc/agn115|issn=0735-0414|pmid=19144976}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth D. Waiters, Andrew J. Treno, and Joel W. Grube’s discussions with a sample of youth, ages 9–15, support this claim. They found that these youth saw the purpose of beer commercials is to urge people to buy the product based on not only its quality, but also on “its relationship to sexual attractiveness.” They see the “attractive young adults drink beer to personally rewarding ends” and the “youth-oriented music” and are influenced to drink alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waiters|first=Elizabeth D.|last2=Treno|first2=Andrew J.|last3=Grube|first3=Joel W.|date=2001-12-01|title=Alcohol Advertising and Youth: A Focus-Group Analysis of What Young People Find Appealing in Alcohol Advertising|url=http://cdx.sagepub.com/content/28/4/695|journal=Contemporary Drug Problems|language=en|volume=28|issue=4|pages=695–718|doi=10.1177/009145090102800409|issn=0091-4509}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advertising around the world==
The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) has specified that the advertising and promotion of alcohol needs to be controlled. In September 2005, the WHO Euro Region adopted a Framework for Alcohol Policy for the Region. This has 5 ethical principles which includes "All children and adolescents have the right to grow up in an environment protected from the negative consequences of alcohol consumption and, to the extent possible, from the promotion of alcoholic beverages".&lt;ref&gt;

Cross-border television advertising within the [[European Union]] was previously regulated by the 1989 Television without Frontiers Directive, a [[Harmonisation of law|harmonisation]] measure designed to remove barriers to international trade as part of the [[common market]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:1989:298:0023:0030:EN:PDF Council Directive 89/552/EEC of 3 October 1989 on the coordination of certain provisions laid down by Law, Regulation or Administrative Action in Member States concerning the pursuit of television broadcasting activities]&lt;/ref&gt; Article 15 of this Directive sets out the restrictions on alcohol advertising:
* "it may not be aimed specifically at minors or, in particular, depict minors consuming these beverages;
* it shall not link the consumption of alcohol to enhanced physical performance or to driving;
* it shall not create the impression that the consumption of alcohol contributes towards social or sexual success;
* it shall not claim that alcohol has therapeutic qualities or that it is a stimulant, a sedative or a means of resolving personal conflicts;
* it shall not encourage immoderate consumption of alcohol or present abstinence or moderation in a negative light;
* it shall not place emphasis on high alcoholic content as being a positive quality of the beverages."

This article on alcohol advertising restrictions is implemented in each EU country largely through the self-regulatory bodies dealing with advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://adage.com/article/global-news/alcohol-advertisers-launch-regulation-pact-europe/234141/|title=Alcohol Advertisers Launch Self-Regulation Pact in Europe|last=Wentz|first=Laurel|date=2012|work=AdAge|access-date=2018-03-27|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU law 'TV without Frontiers' Directive has subsequently been expanded to cover new media formats such as digital television. Now called the 'Audiovisual Media Services Directive', the provisions regarding restrictions on alcohol advertising are laid out in Article 22 and are identical to the above.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2010:095:0001:0024:EN:PDF Directive 2010/13/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 March 2010 on the coordination of certain provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States concerning the provision of audiovisual media services (Audiovisual Media Services Directive)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some countries, such as [[France]], [[Norway]], [[Russia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Russia slaps ban on alcohol advertising in media|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18960770|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ukraine]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/56294/ Tobacco, alcohol advertising bans take effect in printed media], [[Kyiv Post]] (January 1, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Myanmar]], [[Sri Lanka]],&lt;ref name="SriLanka" /&gt; and [[Kenya]] have banned all alcohol advertising on television and billboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4080074.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Africa - Kenya to outlaw alcohol adverts|publisher=|accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{see also|Alcohol advertising on college campuses|Alcohol consumption by youth in the United States}}

In the United States, spirits advertising has [[self-regulatory bodies]] that create standards for the ethical advertising of alcohol. The special concern is where advertising is placed.

Currently, the standard is that alcohol advertisements can only be placed in media where 70% of the audience is over the legal drinking age. Alcohol advertising's creative messages should not be designed to appeal to people under the age of 21, for example, using cartoon characters as spokespeople is discouraged. Advertising cannot promote brands based on alcohol content or its effects. Advertising must not encourage irresponsible drinking. Another issue in media placement is whether media vendors will accept alcohol advertising. The decision to accept an individual ad or a category of advertising is always at the discretion of the owner or publisher of a media outlet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alcohol.org/|title=Did You Know?: How Advertising of Alcohol in the U.S. is Regulated|last=|first=|date=|website=Alcohol.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, U.S. Surgeon General [[Antonia Novello]] criticized alcoholic beverage companies for "unabashedly targeting teenagers" with "sexual imagery, cartoons, and rock and rap music" in television and print ads.{{refn|name=Davidson}}{{rp|113–5}} The [[Federal Trade Commission]] conducted an investigation in 2002 into possible targeting to those under the age of 21. However, this investigation and those of some scholars have not found evidence of such targeting.&lt;ref name="Minors. Los Angeles Times 2006, pp. 357-69"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Jon P. Alcohol advertising in magazines: Do beer, wine, and spirits ads target youth? ''[[Contemporary Economic Policy]]'', July 2006, pp. 357-69).&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns exist that irresponsible advertising practices or "pushing the envelope" with audience composition may lead to permanent legislation governing the advertising of beverage alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discus.org/industry/code/code.htm "Code"].

===Asia===

In [[Malaysia]], alcohol advertising on radio and televisions was outlawed in 1995. On Malaysian television, alcohol advertising is not shown before 10:00 pm and during Malay-language programs. However, non-Malay newspapers and magazines are allowed to continue alcohol advertising. [[Supermarket]]s and [[hypermarket]]s have also been criticized for advertising alcohol products on trolleys, which is controversial because Islam is the state religion of the country. After the ban of alcohol advertising on Malaysian radio and televisions, they continued to build the brands with sponsorships of concerts and entertainment events.

In [[Singapore]], alcohol advertisement is not allowed to be shown during programmes intended for children and young persons and during Malay-language programmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iogt.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Alcohol-Advertising_A-Global-Legal-Perspective.pdf|title=Alcohol Advertising: A Global Legal Perspective|last=|first=|date=2011|website=Global Advertising Lawyers Alliance|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Indonesia]], alcohol advertising was legal in the 1990s, but have since been completely banned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/substance_abuse/publications/policy_indonesia.pdf 2004 Global Status Report: Alcohol Policy]. World Health Organisation. Retrieved 2018-03-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hong Kong]], alcohol advertising is not allowed to be shown during Family Viewing Hour programmes.

In the [[Philippines]], alcohol advertising is allowed. Alcohol warning is also shown in the end of the advertisement explaining with the words: "Drink Moderately". In 2012, the warning was changed to "Drink Responsibly".

In Thailand, alcohol advertisements are still allowed, but must accompanied by a warning message. See [[Alcohol advertising in Thailand]].

In [[Sri Lanka]], public advertising on alcohol is banned totally since 2006.&lt;ref name="SriLanka"&gt;

In South Korea, public advertising on alcohol is only allowed after 10:00 pm.

===Europe===
In Russia, advertising alcohol products is banned from almost all media (including television and billboards) since January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-18960770|title=Russia bans alcohol ads in media|date=2012-07-23|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before that, alcohol advertising was restricted from using images of people drinking since mid-2000's.

In Sweden, since 2010 advertisements are legal for wine and beer, but not on television and radio. Non-periodic magazines are allowed to advertise alcoholic beverages above 15%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.notisum.se/rnp/sls/lag/20101622.htm Alkohollag (2010:1622)]&lt;/ref&gt; These advertisements must contain warnings, but which are worded less strongly than the warnings on tobacco products - for example, "[[Fetal alcohol syndrome|Avoid drinking while pregnant]]," as opposed to "[[Tobacco packaging warning messages#Sweden|smoking kills]]." These rules were introduced into the law 2010&lt;ref&gt;[http://rkrattsbaser.gov.se/sfsr?fritext=1994%3A1738&amp;sort=desc&amp;post_id=1 Regeringskansliets rättsdatabaser Alkohollag (1994:1738)]&lt;/ref&gt; based on the provisions of an [[EU directive]], {{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} provisionally applied by Swedish newspapers since 2005. Before that alcohol advertisements were forbidden, except for "class 1 beer" or "[[light beer]]." Such advertisements were common, as stronger beers which shared a name with advertised light beers, may have benefit from this.

In Finland, [[Parliament of Finland]] decided to ban alcohol outdoor advertising, except during sport events. This new law is going to take place in January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lib.eduskunta.fi/Resource.phx/kirjasto/oikeudellinentieto/tietopaketit/alkoholimainonta.htx | title=Alkoholimainonnan rajoittaminen | publisher=Eduskunnan Kirjasto | accessdate=14 November 2014|language=fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] have banned several ads that don't comply with the restrictions in the EU directive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Strongbow's YouTube spoof and seven other banned alcohol adverts|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/34474456/strongbows-youtube-spoof-and-seven-other-banned-alcohol-adverts|work=BBC Newsbeat|date=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Norway, Advertising on alcohol is banned totally since 1975.

In September 2017, Facebook announced it would allow users to hide all alcohol advertisements. The move is debated within the UK, as Alcohol Research UK group welcomed the change, while the Alcohol Standards Authority, said the UK already had some of the strictest rules in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Strongbow's YouTube spoof and seven other banned alcohol adverts|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-41332082|work=BBC News|date=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2018, Ireland introduced a law banning alcohol advertisements near schools, children play areas, public transportation, and cinemas, as well as restricting visibility of alcohol products in stores. The legislation will take effect November 2019. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ireland’s minister for health Simon Harris has signed a “groundbreaking” law to ban alcohol advertising near schools and play areas and restrict visibility of alcohol in stores over the next two years.|url=https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2018/11/ireland-passes-ground-breaking-alcohol-advertising-law/|work=Spirits Business|date=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responsible drinking campaigns ==

There have been various campaigns to help prevent [[alcoholism]], under-age drinking and [[driving under the influence|drunk driving]]. The [[Portman Group]], an association of leading drinks producers in the UK, are responsible for various such campaigns. These include [[drinking culture|responsible drinking]], drink driving (and [[designated driver]]s), [[proof of age]] cards.  The ''Drink Aware'' campaign,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://drinkaware.co.uk/|title=Home|publisher=|accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, aims to educate people about how to drink sensibly and avoid [[binge drinking]]. The web site address is displayed as part of all of the adverts for products made by members of the group.

[[The Century Council]], financially supported by a group of alcoholic beverage distillers in the United States, promotes responsible decision-making regarding drinking or non-drinking and works to reduce all forms of irresponsible consumption. Since its founding in 1991, it has invested over 175 million dollars in its programs.

Many campaigns by the alcoholic beverage industry that advocate responsible drinking presuppose that drinking for recreational purposes is a positive activity and reinforce this idea as an example of sensible consumption. Persons who believe alcohol can never simultaneously be used "sensibly" and recreationally would obviously disagree with the focus or direction of these campaigns.

A controversial anti-drunk driving advertisement in South Africa has threatened the public with rape in prison. The campaign is still underway with no reported complaints to the advertising standards authorities.&lt;ref&gt;

== Sponsorship in sport ==
[[File:Brad Keselowski, 2013 STP Gas Booster 500.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Miller Lite]] sponsored car of [[Brad Keselowski]] in the [[NASCAR]] [[Sprint Cup Series]]]]
The [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]]ship of sporting events and sportspeople is banned in many countries. For example, the primary club competition in European [[rugby union]], the [[Heineken Cup]], is called the ''H Cup'' in [[France]] because of that country's restrictions on alcohol advertising. However, such sponsorship is still common in other areas, such as the [[United States]], although such sponsorship is controversial as children are often a target audience for major professional sports leagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB9073/index1.html | title=Forging the Link Between Alcohol Advertising and Underage Drinking | publisher=Rand Corporation | date=2006 | accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/resources/educational/teaching_backgrounders/alcohol/alcohol_ads_and_sports.cfm "Alcohol ads and sports"].

Alcohol advertising is common in [[motor racing]] competitions, and is particularly prominent in [[NASCAR]] and [[IndyCar]].  One major example of this was the [[Busch Series]] (now known as the Xfinity Series), sponsored by a brand of [[beer]] sold by [[Anheuser-Busch]]. That sponsorship, which started in the series' conversion from a national Late Model Sportsman races around the country to the present touring format in 1982, ended after 2007.

[[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]], the best-known Anheuser-Busch brand, has sponsored IndyCar drivers such as [[Mario Andretti]], [[Bobby Rahal]] and [[Paul Tracy]], as well as NASCAR Cup drivers such as [[Terry Labonte]], [[Neil Bonnett]], [[Darrell Waltrip]], [[Bill Elliott]], [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.]], [[Kasey Kahne]] and currently [[Kevin Harvick]]. Meanwhile, [[Miller Brewing Company|Miller]] has sponsored [[Al Unser]], [[Danny Sullivan]], Bobby Rahal, [[Rusty Wallace]], [[Kurt Busch]] and currently [[Brad Keselowski]].

Furthermore, NASCAR mandates drivers under 21 not be permitted to wear any alcohol-branded sticker on their cars. In cases with below drinking age drivers, a specialised "[[Pole position|Coors Pole Award - 21 Means 21]]" sticker is placed on such drivers' cars. One team, [[Petty Enterprises]], refuses to participate in alcohol advertising and forfeits all alcohol monies and bonuses.

For distilled spirits, teams must run a responsible drinking sticker clearly visible on the car. For [[Jack Daniel's]], the theme is "Pace Yourself, Drink Responsibly", and includes on NASCAR's Web site a waving yellow flag warning drinkers. For [[Crown Royal]], the television ads feature the car with the slogan "Be a champion, Drink Responsibly" and it acting as a pace car to drivers, warning them of responsibility. Jim Beam has radio ads and NASCAR mandated statements about alcohol control. None of the three, however, is a full-time sponsor, as they alternate sponsorship with other products unrelated to their firm on the car.  (Jim Beam's parent, Fortune Brands, sometimes has its [[Moen (company)|Moen Faucet]]s replace Jim Beam on the car in selected races.)

Although [[tobacco]] companies have been the main source of financial backing in [[Formula One]], some alcohol brands have also been associated with the sport. For example, [[Martini &amp; Rossi|Martini]] appears on the [[Williams F1]] car while [[Johnnie Walker]] has sponsored [[McLaren]] since 2006.

Anheuser-Busch, being a conglomerate with non-alcoholic properties, complies with the French alcohol advertising ban in Formula One by placing their Busch Entertainment theme park logos (mostly [[SeaWorld]]) where their Budweiser logo would appear on the [[Williams F1]] car at races where alcohol advertising is banned and in Middle Eastern countries, where alcohol advertising is discouraged. A few companies, however, have added responsible drinking campaigns with their sponsorship, notably the 1989–90 [[British Touring Car Championship|BTCC]] [[Ford Sierra|Ford Sierra RS500]] of [[Tim Harvey]] and [[Laurence Bristow]], which was sponsored by [[Labatt]]. Throughout the two seasons, the car bore a "Please Don't Drink and Drive" message.

Some stadiums, particularly in the U.S., bear the names of breweries or beer brands via [[naming rights]] arrangements, such as [[Busch Stadium]], [[Coors Field]], and [[Miller Park (Milwaukee)|Miller Park]]; those three venues are all in or near the cities of their headquarters.

[[Diageo]] are a major sponsor of many sporting events through their various brands.  For example, [[Johnnie Walker]] sponsor the [[Johnnie Walker Championship at Gleneagles|Championship at Gleneagles]] and [[Johnnie Walker Classic|Classic]] [[golf]] tournaments along with the Team [[McLaren]] Formula One car.

[[Cricket]] is a sport with a large amount of alcohol sponsorship. [[The 2005 Ashes]], for example, featured sponsorship hoardings by brands such as [[Red Stripe]], [[Thwaites Brewery|Thwaites Lancaster Bomber]] and [[Wolf Blass|Wolf Blass wines]]. In nations like India and Sri Lanka where alcoholic advertising is generally prohibited, those regulations are rounded with distillers offering clothing lines and sports equipment marked with one of their brands or separate [[soft drink]] or [[bottled water]] lines within tournaments such as the [[Indian Premier League]] and test matches, such as [[United Spirits Limited]]'s [[McDowell's No.1]] and [[Pernod Ricard]]'s [[Royal Stag]].

[[Rugby union]] also has a substantial amount of alcohol sponsorship. The [[All Blacks]] feature [[Steinlager]] sponsorship prominently. The [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland national team]] has a long-established relationship with [[The Famous Grouse]], a brand of [[Scotch whisky]]. [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]] has a more recent relationship with the [[Brains Brewery|Brains]] brewery (But wear "Brawn" when playing in France), and the [[South Africa national rugby union team|Springboks]] of [[South Africa]] agreed for [[South African Breweries]] to put the Lion Lager, then, the [[SABMiller brands#Castle brewery|Castle Lager]] brand on their shirt until 2004. [[Magners]] was the title sponsor of the [[Pro14|Celtic League]], the top competition in [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]], [[Guinness]] is the title sponsor of the [[Guinness Premiership]], the top competition in [[England]], and the beer brand [[Tooheys New]] was the [[Australia]]n sponsor of the Southern Hemisphere [[Super Rugby|Super 14]] competition through the 2006 season. [[Bundaberg Rum]] is one of the sponsors of the [[Australia national rugby union team]].

[[Rugby league in Australia]] is sponsored by [[Victoria Bitter]] and [[Bundaberg Rum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21475237-23289,00.html|title=Nocookies|work=The Australian|accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Campaigns ==

=== Guinness ===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Guinness Toucan-ad.jpg|thumb|One of the [[Guinness]] advertising posters from the Gilroy Era of the 40's]] --&gt;
[[Guinness]]' iconic stature can be attributed in part to its advertising campaigns. One of the most notable and recognizable series of adverts was created by [[S.H. Benson]]'s advertising, primarily [[John Gilroy (artist)|John Gilroy]], in the 1930s and 1940s.  Gilroy was responsible for creating posters which included such phrases such as "Guinness for Strength", "It's a Lovely Day for a Guinness", and most famously, "Guinness is Good For You". The posters featured Gilroy's distinctive artwork and more often than not featured animals such as a [[kangaroo]], [[ostrich]], [[Pinniped|seal]], [[lion]], and notably a [[toucan]], which has become as much a symbol of Guinness as the [[Trinity College Harp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=I8KVxbDmAfkC&amp;dq=gilroy+toucan+symbol&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=The Search for God and Guinness: A Biography of the Beer that Changed the World|last=Mansfield|first=Stephen|date=2009-10-12|publisher=Thomas Nelson|isbn=9781418580674|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guinness advertising paraphernalia attracts high prices on the collectible market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/goodness-guinness-memorabilias-worth-90000-8143706|title=How one man's passion for Guinness earned him £90,000|last=Read|first=Simon|date=2016-06-09|work=Mirror|access-date=2018-03-26|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a campaign reminiscent of [[viral marketing]] techniques, one advert quickly appeared as a [[screensaver]] distributed over the [[Internet]]. It was a simple concept, featuring [[Dublin]] actor Joe McKinney dancing around the drink while it was given time to settle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=haribokey|title=Guinness Anticipation Advert|date=2008-09-30|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5HU5axz6GI|accessdate=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The accompanying music ([[Mambo (music)|mambo]] tune ''Guaglione'' by [[Pérez Prado]]) was released as a single and reached number one on the Irish charts in September 1994 and number two on the [[1995 in British music|UK charts]] in May 1995 (see [[List of number-one singles of 1994 (Ireland)]] [[List of UK top 10 singles in 1995]]).

In Malaysia, Singapore, and Hong Kong, Guinness launched a $8 million advertising campaign using the fictional character of Adam King to promote the embodiment of Guinness as a man could be incredibly powerful. The advertising campaign was handled by advertising firm, [[Saatchi &amp; Saatchi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.josh.com.my/whoisadamking.com/ Who is Adam King?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809072150/http://www.josh.com.my/whoisadamking.com/ |date=2007-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Africa]], the character of [[Michael Power (advertisement)|Michael Power]] has been used since 1999 to boost sales.

Today, Guinness' principal television campaign in North America consists of [[limited animation]] commercials featuring two eccentric scientists in 19th-century dress complimenting one another's ideas as "brilliant!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=boreczkizoli|title=guinness ad|date=2007-04-29|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DPKf7y1F-Q|accessdate=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Absolut ===
[[Absolut]] vodka is made in [[Sweden]] and was introduced to the United States in the year 1979. Its launch was a true challenge due to a variety of factors: Sweden was not perceived as a vodka-producing country, the bottle was very awkward for bartenders to use, and vodka was perceived as a cheap, tasteless drink. Absolut's advertising campaign by [[TBWA]] exploited the shape of the bottle to create clever advertisements that caused people to become involved in the advertising, and the brand took off.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.uxeria.com/en/absolut-the-story-of-the-unusual-bottle/|title=Absolut - the story of the (un)usual bottle - Uxeria Blog|last=Markiewicz|first=Magdalena|date=|website=blog.uxeria.com|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before Absolut, there were very few distinctions in the vodka category. Today there are regular, premium, and superpremium vodkas each at different price points and qualities. Flavoured vodka varieties have become numerous and may be found commonly in stores in the U.S.A.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2015/04/flavoured-vodka-not-dead-but-market-evolving/|title=Flavoured Vodka Market not Dead but Evolving|last=|first=|date=2015|website=The Spirits Business|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alcohol sponsorship in sport===
Sport has been suggested to be one of the primary, if not the dominant, medium for the promotion of alcohol and drinking to the general population with the majority of advertising spend an advertising placement occurring in sport.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.camy.org/bin/s/a/Alcohol_Advertising_on_Sports_Television.pdf "Alcohol Advertising on Sports Television 2001 to 2003"].

{{Infobox Bilateral relations|Armenia-Azerbaijans Eurovision Song Contest|Armenia|Azerbaijan|filetype=svg}}
[[Armenia]] has [[Armenia in the Eurovision Song Contest|participated]] in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], a pan-European music competition, since [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006|2006]], while [[Azerbaijan]] has [[Azerbaijan in the Eurovision Song Contest|participated]] since 2008. The [[Nagorno-Karabakh conflict|continuing conflict]] between the two countries over the region of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]], which is considered to be a ''[[de jure]]'' part of Azerbaijan by the [[United Nations]], but has been under control of the Armenia-backed ''de facto'' [[Nagorno-Karabakh Republic]] since 1993, has affected the Eurovision Song Contest on several occasions.

Conflicts between Armenia and Azerbaijan first appeared in 2006, when Azeri media criticized the event's website for listing Nagorno-Karabakh as the birthplace of Armenia's first representative, [[André (singer)|André]], as it was part of the [[Azerbaijan SSR]] at the time. Conflicts notably escalated throughout the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2009|2009 contest]]: during the semi-finals, Azeri officials objected to the depiction of the Nagorno-Karabakh monument ''[[We Are Our Mountains]]'' during an introductory video for the [[Jan Jan|Armenian entry]]. Armenia responded during the finals by displaying multiple images of the monument whilst presenting its results. Following the contest, allegations emerged that Azerbaijan's state broadcaster had tampered with its feed of the broadcast to censor the Armenian entry, and that the Azeri government was interrogating citizens who voted for Armenia, accusing them of being unpatriotic and a threat to security. Following an inquiry, Azerbaijan was fined by the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU) for breaching the privacy of voters.

Following the [[2010 Junior Eurovision Song Contest]], Armenian media claimed that Azerbaijan's broadcaster had cut off the broadcast when it became apparent that Armenia had won; however, it was disputed whether the contest was even broadcast in Azerbaijan as they had not yet participated. Accordingly, as Azerbaijan prepared to host the [[2012 Eurovision Song Contest]] following its [[Running Scared (Eldar &amp; Nigar song)|victory]] in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2011|2011]], a group of Armenian musicians led a boycott effort, and the country would ultimately withdraw from the contest, causing the broadcaster to be fined for the late notice.&lt;ref name="riaarm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.ria.ru/world/20120503/173190419.html |title=Armenia Fined for Refusal to Take Part in Eurovision 2012 |publisher=RIA Novosti |date= |accessdate=9 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625195131/http://en.ria.ru/world/20120503/173190419.html |archivedate=25 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Armenia returned in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2013|2013 edition]], which was held in [[Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Marco|last=Brey|title=Gor Sujyan will represent Armenia!|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=71863&amp;_t=gor_sujyan_will_represent_armenia|work=Eurovision.tv|date=22 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move was criticized by an Azeri politician and a representative of the country's state broadcaster, who felt that Armenia's participation could have been a symbol of peace between the two nations, and that the decision would further damage the country's reputation.

Conflicts between the two countries began to develop again during the lead-up to the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2015|2015 contest]], where allegations emerged that the Armenian entry, "[[Face the Shadow|Don't Deny]]", was a call for recognition of the [[Armenian Genocide]] (whose [[100th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide|100th anniversary]] was commemorated prior to the 2015 contest). As Azerbaijan [[Armenian Genocide denial|denies]] the genocide, officials from the country issued a statement threatening Armenia for attempting to use Eurovision as an outlet for its "political ambitions". The song was subsequently renamed "Face the Shadow" to address concerns over its alleged political themes. [[Eurovision Song Contest 2016|The following year]], Armenian representative [[Iveta Mukuchyan]] was reprimanded by organizers for displaying the [[flag of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic]] during the first semi-final.

==Initial appearances==
In [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006|2006]]—the first year in which [[Armenia in the Eurovision Song Contest|Armenia]] participated, the official Eurovision website listed the birthplace of its performer [[André (singer)|André]] as being in the "Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh". Media outlets in Azerbaijan criticized the contest's organizers for recognizing the republic, especially given that the region was an [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast|autonomous oblast]] within the [[Azerbaijan SSR]] when André was born in 1979. The birthplace listing on André's profile was later removed entirely.&lt;ref name=telegraph-needfriends&gt;{{cite web|title=You need friends to win in Eurovision|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3625080/You-need-friends-to-win-in-Eurovision.html|website=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dayaz-error&gt;{{cite web|title=Абульфаз Гараев: "Руководство Евровидения устранило ошибку на своем сайте" |url=http://www.day.az/news/showbiz/43927.html|website=[[Day.az]]|accessdate=4 June 2014|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Azerbaijan in the Eurovision Song Contest|Azerbaijan]] would make its own Eurovision debut in [[2008 Eurovision Song Contest|2008]]—marking the first time both Armenia and Azerbaijan competed against each other at the contest. The Armenian entry, "[[Qélé, Qélé]]" by [[Sirusho]], finished in 4th place, while Azerbaijan's inaugural entry, "[[Day After Day (Elnur Hüseynov and Samir Javadzadeh song)|Day After Day]]", finished 8th.&lt;ref name=esc-azerbaijan&gt;{{cite web|title=Azerbaijan: Major success since 2008 debut|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=64233|website=Eurovision.tv|accessdate=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=taw-4thplace&gt;{{cite web|title=Disappointing Performance Leaves Armenia Behind at Eurovision|url=http://armenianweekly.com/2011/05/11/disappointing-performance-leaves-armenia-behind-at-eurovision/|website=[[The Armenian Weekly]]|accessdate=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2009 contest==

===Postcard controversy and aftermath===
[[File:Eurovision 2009 Armenia voting.png|thumb|In protest of complaints by Azerbaijan over its usage during the semi-finals, Armenia displayed multiple images of ''We Are Our Mountains'' while presenting its votes at the 2009 Eurovision Song Contest finals.]]
During the first semi-final of the [[2009 Eurovision Song Contest|2009 contest]], the "postcard" video introducing the performance of the Armenian entry "[[Jan Jan]]" depicted, amongst other monuments, ''[[We Are Our Mountains]]'', an art piece located in Nagorno-Karabakh's capital city of [[Stepanakert]]. Due to the country's claims over the region, Azerbaijani officials objected to the portrayal of ''We Are Our Mountains'' as being an Armenian landmark. For the finals telecast, the video was edited to remove the statue.&lt;ref name="frontline"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.frontlineclub.com/festering_wounds_overshadow_eurovision_in_the_south_caucasus/ |title=Ethnic rivalry wins over kitsch in the Caucasus |last=Krikorian |first=Onnik |date=16 May 2009 |publisher=[[Frontline Club]] |accessdate=17 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/Eurovision_A_MeltingPot_Contest_Where_Native_Doesnt_Always_Mean_Best/1732594.html|title=Eurovision: A Melting-Pot Contest, Where Native Doesn't Always Mean Best|last=Deasy|first=Kristin|date=15 May 2009|publisher=[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]|accessdate=17 May 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090517043108/http://www.rferl.org/content/Eurovision_A_MeltingPot_Contest_Where_Native_Doesnt_Always_Mean_Best/1732594.html| archivedate= 17 May 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In protest of the decision, multiple photographs of ''We Are Our Mountains'' were displayed during the presentation of voting results from Armenia; one was displayed on a video screen at [[Yerevan]]'s [[Republic Square, Yerevan|Republic Square]] in the background, and another was displayed on the back of a clipboard that the presenter [[Sirusho]] was reading results from.&lt;ref name="frontline" /&gt;&lt;ref name=time-wagewar/&gt; Despite the controversy, 1,065 Armenians voted for the Azerbaijani entry, enough to give the country a single point. A total of 43 Azerbaijanis voted for the Armenian entry.&lt;ref name=critcize /&gt;

===Censorship, interrogation of voters===
Following the contest, reports surfaced that the local Azeri broadcaster, [[İctimai Television]], had attempted to censor the Armenian performance from its broadcast of the final, and had obscured the voting number for the entry in an effort to discourage voting for it. İTV denied these claims, and provided footage showing that its broadcast was untampered with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.1news.az/bomond/20090526113051515.html |title=Голосование за Ингу и Ануш в Азербайджане /ВИДЕО/ |publisher=1news.az |date=26 May 2009 |accessdate=5 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020104633/http://www.1news.az/bomond/20090526113051515.html |archivedate=20 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ararat-diplomacy&gt;{{cite web|title=Can Eurovision Succeed Where Diplomacy Has Failed?|url=http://araratmagazine.org/2011/05/can-eurovision-succeed-where-diplomacy-has-failed/|website=Ararat|accessdate=5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2009, a number of Azerbaijanis who had voted for Armenia's entry during the contest were summoned for questioning at the Ministry of National Security in [[Baku]], during which they were accused of being "unpatriotic" and "a potential security threat".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8205907.stm|title=Azerbaijanis in Eurovision probe|date=17 August 2009|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=17 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rfl-az01&gt;{{cite web|title=Azerbaijani Authorities Interrogate Music Fan Over Eurovision Vote For Armenia|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/feature/1800013.html|website=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|accessdate=5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of those summoned, Rovshan Nasirli (who had voted for "Jan Jan" because he felt it was a better reflection of Azeri music than "[[Always (Aysel and Arash song)|Always]]", the country's actual entry) said that his interrogators told him that they had the names and addresses of all 43 Azerbaijanis who had voted for Armenia.&lt;ref name=rfl-az02&gt;{{cite web|title=Azeris Questioned Over Eurovision Vote For Armenia|url=http://www.azatutyun.am/content/article/1800027.html|website=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|accessdate=5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following these reports, [[Svante Stockselius]], executive supervisor of the Eurovision Song Contest, announced the launch of an enquiry into the incidents.&lt;ref name=rfl-az03&gt;{{cite web|title=Eurovision Organizer Probes Azeri Crackdown|url=http://www.azatutyun.am/content/article/1803351.html|website=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|accessdate=5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their response, İctimai TV stated that while two individuals had been invited to the Ministry of National Security, the Ministry had given assurances that nobody had been questioned, either officially or unofficially, on voting in the competition itself. The [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU) Director General, Jean Réveillon, responded to this by saying that freedom to vote is one of the cornerstones of the contest and "Any breach of privacy regarding voting, or interrogation of individuals, is totally unacceptable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=3863 |title=EBU receives responses from Azerbaijan |work=Eurovision.tv |date=11 September 2009 |accessdate=9 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926115017/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=3863 |archivedate=26 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Azerbaijani Minister of Youth and Sport, [[Azad Rahimov]], denied that anyone had been summoned to the Ministry of National Security about voting for the Armenian entry, and accused [[RFE/RL]] and other news outlets of reporting the allegations to create a scandal.&lt;ref name=critcize&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/Azerbaijani_Minister_Criticizes_RFERL_Over_Eurovision_Interrogation_Story/1815075.html |title=Azerbaijani Minister Criticizes RFE/RL Over Eurovision Interrogation Story |publisher=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty |date=4 September 2009 |accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Reference Group of the EBU, which organizes Eurovision, examined the matter at a meeting in [[Oslo]] on 11 September 2009. In a statement issued on 17 September, the EBU acknowledged the allegations that Azeri officials were interrogating voters and breaching their privacy. While the EBU would not impose sanctions on or ban Azerbaijan from future editions of the contest (the country could have been banned from the contest for three years), it fined the delegation €2,700, and changed its rules to make participating broadcasters liable for the "disclosure of information which could be used to identify voters" during future editions of the contest. Previously, telecommunications providers were liable, but the EBU could not impose sanctions on them.&lt;ref name=ararat-diplomacy/&gt;&lt;ref name="rfl-amends"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/Eurovision_Changes_Rules_But_Does_Not_Sanction_Azerbaijan/1825025.html |title=Eurovision Amends Rules, Does Not Sanction Azerbaijan |publisher=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty |date=17 September 2009 |accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2010 Junior Eurovision Song Contest==
[[Vladimir Arzumanyan]], a singer from Nagorno-Karabakh representing Armenia, won the [[Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2010|2010 Junior Eurovision Song Contest]]. It was alleged by Armenian media outlets that the broadcast of the contest in Azerbaijan was interrupted when it became apparent that Armenia had won.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.am/eng/news/38887.html |title=Azerbaijan interrupted Eurovision-2010 broadcast after the victory of the Armenian performer from Karabakh |publisher=NEWS.am |date=13 June 2009 |accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.panarmenian.net/eng/culture/news/57089/Azerbaijan_does_not_endure_victory_of_Vladimir_Arzumanyan_at_2010_Junior_Eurovision |title=Azerbaijan does not "endure" victory of Vladimir Arzumanyan at 2010 Junior Eurovision |publisher=[[PanARMENIAN.Net]] |date=21 November 2010 |accessdate=8 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324233303/http://www.panarmenian.net/eng/culture/news/57089/Azerbaijan_does_not_endure_victory_of_Vladimir_Arzumanyan_at_2010_Junior_Eurovision |archivedate=24 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These claims were disputed by [[Armenia 1]] director and Eurovision delegation leader Diana Mnatsakanyan, who also denied reports that the country was preparing to file a complaint with the EBU over the matter. She noted that the broadcaster did not know whether Azerbaijan even aired the contest at all, given that the country had not yet participated in the Junior Eurovision and had "no interest" in it at the time, and that reports about the alleged incident were limited to posts on Azerbaijani [[Internet forum|forums]].&lt;ref name=panarmenian-notcutoff&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Television of Armenia denies the country’s intention to file complaint against Azerbaijan to European Broadcasting Union|url=http://www.panarmenian.net/eng/news/57152/|website=[[PanARMENIAN.Net]]|accessdate=5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Azerbaijan would ultimately make its official debut at the Junior Eurovision [[Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2012|two years later]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.junioreurovision.tv/page/blog?id=junior_2012_12_countries_to_take_part|title=Junior 2012: 12 countries to take part|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|date=1 September 2012|accessdate=3 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2012 contest==
[[File:Baku Crystal Hall.jpg|thumb|right|Armenia dropped out of the 2012 Eurovision Song Contest ''([[Baku Crystal Hall|venue]] pictured)'' following a formal boycott by a group of local musicians.]]
The [[Eurovision Song Contest 2012|2012 Eurovision Song Contest]] was hosted by [[Baku]], Azerbaijan after their win in [[2011 Eurovision Song Contest|2011]]. Azerbaijan temporarily amended [[Visa policy of Azerbaijan|its visa policy]] to allow Armenians, who are normally barred from entering the country, to attend the event. However, in February 2012, a boycott effort emerged in Armenia following an incident where a 20-year-old Armenian soldier was shot dead on the border between the two countries. Armenian officials initially blamed the soldier's death on an Azerbaijani sniper; however, conflicting reports indicated that the death was the result of [[friendly fire]].&lt;ref name=nyt-shunning/&gt; Also in February, Azeri president [[Ilham Aliyev]] made a statement re-affirming the country's stance against Armenians, arguing that they control "hypocritical and corrupt politicians."&lt;ref name=time-wagewar/&gt; 22 Armenian musicians, including previous Armenian Eurovision representatives [[Emmy (Armenian singer)|Emmy]] and [[Eva Rivas]], signed an open letter supporting a boycott, stating that they would "refuse to appear in a country that is well-known for the mass killings and massacres of Armenians, in a country where anti-Armenian sentiments have been elevated to the level of state policy."&lt;ref name=time-wagewar&gt;{{cite web|title=How Armenia and Azerbaijan Wage War Through Eurovision|url=http://world.time.com/2012/03/11/how-armenia-and-azerbaijan-wage-war-through-eurovision/|website=Time|accessdate=5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt-shunning&gt;{{cite news|title=Armenians Are Shunning Song Contest in Azerbaijan|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/08/world/asia/armenia-shuns-eurovision-hosted-by-azerbaijan-a-rival.html?_r=0|website=The New York Times|accessdate=5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 March 2012, Armenian officials announced that the country would withdraw from the 2012 contest. The EBU stated that it was "truly disappointed" with Armenia's withdrawal, and that "despite the efforts of the EBU and the Host Broadcaster to ensure a smooth participation for the Armenian delegation in this year's Contest, circumstances beyond our control lead to this unfortunate decision."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=48413&amp;_t=armenia_withdraws_from_eurovision_2012 |title=Armenia withdraws from Eurovision 2012 |publisher=Eurovision.tv |date= |accessdate=9 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927021341/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=48413&amp;_t=armenia_withdraws_from_eurovision_2012 |archivedate=27 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.ria.ru/world/20120307/171835386.html |title=Armenia Officially Rejects Eurovision Song Contest |publisher=[[RIA Novosti]]|date= |accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  İTV General Director Ismayil Omarov expressed his regret about Armenia's withdrawal, believing that the country's presence could have been a "joint peace message to the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.apa.az/news/167456 |title=Ismayil Omarov: "The performance of Armenia’s representative on Baku stage could be a joint peace message to the world" |publisher=APA |date= |accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local politician Ali Ahmadov also criticized the Armenian delegation for its decision, stating that "[its] refusal to take part in such a respected contest will cause even further damage to the already damaged image of Armenia."&lt;ref name=time-wagewar/&gt;

Due to its late withdrawal, Armenia was required to pay its entry fee, plus a fine totalling half the value of the entry fee.&lt;ref name="riaarm"/&gt;

== 2015 contest ==
Upon its unveiling in March 2015, media outlets characterized Armenia's [[Armenia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2015|entry]] in the [[2015 Eurovision Song Contest]], "[[Face the Shadow|Don't Deny]]", as being in tribute to the [[Armenian Genocide]], whose [[100th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide|centenary]] was commemorated on 24 April 2015. The song was performed by [[Genealogy (band)|Genealogy]], a group whose composition alludes to the [[forget-me-not]] by consisting of five [[Armenian diaspora]], along with a sixth singer representing Armenia and their unity. "Don't Deny" was perceived by critics to be a call for [[Armenian Genocide recognition|recognition of the genocide]], further noting that the song's music video contained a scene depicting the group's members posing for a family photo in [[World War I]]-era outfits, and then disappearing from sight. Gohar Gasparyan, head of Armenia's Eurovision delegation, described the song as being about love and unity, and did not make reference to any specific political intent or themes. Representatives of Azerbaijan—which, alongside [[Turkey]], [[Armenian Genocide denial|denies the genocide]]—criticized the song for its alleged political themes, and stated that they would "act adequately" to prevent the contest from being "sacrificed to the political ambitions of a country."&lt;ref name="esc-facetheshadow"/&gt;&lt;ref name=trend.az-dontdeny&gt;{{cite web|title=Azerbaijan to adequately act if Armenia turns Eurovision into political arena|url=http://en.trend.az/azerbaijan/society/2364270.html|website=Trend.az|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eurasianet-dontdeny&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lomsadze|first1=Giorgi|title=Armenia Takes Genocide-Recognition to Eurovision|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/node/72516|website=Eurasianet|accessdate=22 March 2015|date=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=apaaz-possiblemessages&gt;{{cite web|title=Possible messages for recognition of ‘Armenian genocide’ in Armenia's song for Eurovision to be looked for|url=http://en.apa.az/xeber_possible_messages_for_recognition_of____ar_223179.html|website=APA.az|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 March 2015, the Armenian delegation announced that the title of the entry had been changed to "Face the Shadow"; they stated that the new title was meant to "strengthen" the themes of the song, and to quell concerns over the alleged political subtext. The delegation continued to deny any specific political subtext in the song.&lt;ref name="esc-facetheshadow"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Siim|first1=Jarmo|title=Armenia changes song title|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=armenia_changes_song_title|website=eurovision.tv|publisher=European Broadcasting Union|accessdate=17 March 2015|date=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eurasianet-dodged&gt;{{cite web|title=Armenia Dodges Eurovision Controversy|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/node/72576|website=Eurasianet.org|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

My thoughts are with my motherland, and what I want to spread is peace on borders.

The EBU and the reference group released a statement the following day explaining that they "strongly condemn the brandishing of the Nagorno-Karabakh flag" during the live transmission of the first semi final, and consider the appearance "harmful" to the contest brand. The reference group has consequently sanctioned the Armenian broadcaster [[AMPTV]], with the nature of the sanction to be determined citing a breach of the rule stating "no messages promoting any organisation, institution, political cause or other causes shall be allowed in the shows". Furthermore, the reference group has pointed out that a further breach of the rules of the contest could lead to disqualification from the year's event or any successive editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official statement on use of Nagorno-Karabakh flag at Eurovision Song Contest|url=https://www.facebook.com/EBU.HQ/posts/1045195205572896|website=EBU - Facebook|accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hikmet Hajiyev, the spokesman for the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Azerbaijan)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs Azerbaijan]] called the action of Mukuchyan "provocative" and unacceptable claiming that "the Armenian side deliberately resorts to such steps to encourage and promote the illegal formation created in the occupied Azerbaijani territories”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azernews.az/aggression/96432.html Armenian provocation prevented at Eurovision Song Contest] // [[azernews.az]], 11 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Asian Formula Three Championship''' was a [[Open wheel car|single-seater]] racing series based in [[South East Asia]]. It is one of a number of national and international [[Formula Three]] championships that form part of an established "[[career ladder]]" below [[Formula One]]. It was most recently promoted as the '''Asian F3 Pacific Series'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.formula3.cc/content/view/14257/1/ "Henri Karjalainen wins for Team Goddard"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926230030/http://www.formula3.cc/content/view/14257/1/ |date=September 26, 2007 }} ''formula3.cc'', 2007-01-21. Retrieved 2007-10-25.&lt;/ref&gt; The 2009 series collapsed through a lack of competitors with some teams dispersing to other Formula 3 series in the region.

==Creation and management==
The creators of the Asian F3 Championship intended the series to provide young Asian drivers with a stepping stone to the higher levels of single-seater motor racing. Asia has not traditionally had the motor racing profile and career ladder from which European drivers benefit. There was clearly a need to change this and to demonstrate the feasibility of Formula Three to potential sponsors in light of the region's growing economy. The series' organisers have held corporate track days in the Philippines, as part of their efforts to attract sponsorship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.f1prospects.com/2006/03/asian_f3_af3_go.html "AF3 Goes Corporate"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928080959/http://www.f1prospects.com/2006/03/asian_f3_af3_go.html |date=September 28, 2007 }} ''f1prospects.com'', 2006-03-14. Retrieved 2007-10-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Asian F3 is positioned between two other single seater formulae in Asia's fledgling motorsport culture: below it sits ''Formula BMW Asia'', which is one of four [[Formula BMW]] series worldwide, and positioned above it is ''Formula Renault V6'',  which is derived from the now defunct ''Formula Renault V6 Eurocup'' that was held in Europe, and uses the same Tatuus chassis and Renault-derived V6 engine.

The championship is organised by the ''Asian Formula Three Corporation'', which is managed by Jose Eduardo Peña from offices in [[Manila]]. The corporation's stockholders comprise the participating teams. Current stockholders include the proprietors of Speedtech Asia; Joson F3 Racing (disbanded); Team Goddard; Ghiasports (not in the series anymore); TOM's Asia (teamed up with Threebond Racing in the 2005 series); and Kinectic Racing (disbanded).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asianf3.net/page/about_us "About Us"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070117220056/http://www.asianf3.net/page/about_us |date=January 17, 2007 }} ''asianf3.net''. Retrieved 2007-10-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Stockholders are not required to pay the entry fee of $2000 per season.
Unfortunately, the 2007-08 season which is the pacific series, is the last season of the series. The series' reputation was badly damaged in the 2007-08 season by Bahrain driver [[Hamad Al Fardan]] who had complained that championship leaders [[Frederic Vervisch]] and Team Goddard were using illegal petrol to go faster than him. It was later revealed that Team Goddard principal, Mark Goddard, was also the organiser of the championship and was even competing under the pseudonym of "Don Tacos". While Fardan's comments were entirely unfounded, support in the final round of the 2007-08 season was minimal with a total of only 7 entered cars opposed to the 12 that had started at the first round. The 2009 season never materialized due to lack of teams and drivers joining the series, and the season champions which is the Team Goddard moved its racing operation in the Australian Formula 3 series that same year.

==Costs==
The typical operating budget of an Asian F3 team is circa £80,000. This fact, coupled with a steady rise in its international profile, serves to attract a number of European drivers who lack the budget that is required to compete in the established European championships.

The winner of the drivers' championship title is rewarded with a fully sponsored entry to the end-of-season, non-championship [[Macau Grand Prix]].

For 2007/08 season, the winner of the drivers' championship will be rewarded with a Formula 1 test drive with the [[Force India F1 Team]].

==Drivers and teams==
Notable drivers who have graduated from Asian F3 include Indonesian [[A1GP]] driver [[Ananda Mikola]] and 2004 champion, Australian [[Christian Jones]], the son of former world champion [[Alan Jones (Formula 1)|Alan Jones]]. The 2006 champion, Britain's [[James Winslow]], received attention and praise for his dramatic rescue of a competitor who was trapped in his upturned car at [[Sentul International Circuit|Sentul]] in [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;Noble, J. [http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/55880 "Gregor Grant Award for Winslow"] ''autosport.com'', 2006-12-03. Retrieved 2007-10-25.&lt;/ref&gt; In acknowledgment, he received a ''Gregor Grant'' Award at the annual [[Autosport]] Awards ceremony in the [[UK]], and a Bronze Award from the [[Royal Humane Society]].&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, G. [http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/56258 "Winslow to receive royal award"] ''autosport.com'', 2007-01-12. Retrieved 2007-10-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The series benefits from the involvement of the noted Japanese F3 team, Three Bond Racing, which carried Winslow to the drivers' title in its collaboration with JA Motorsports, and secured the teams' title in the process.

At the end of 2007 the championship became a "winter type series" naming it the AF3 Pacific Series, starting the championship in November 2007 and ending in May 2008. New teams have joined the series during that championship, Drew-Evans Motorsport Group, Team GFH Bahrain,Champ Motorsport and PTRS from Hong Kong along with some good drivers, namely Frederic Vervisch (the 2007-08 champion), Matthew Howson, Rafael Suzuki and Hamad Al Fardan. Ed Pead, Nial Quinn, Arturo Gonzales, Leonardo Valois, David Julien and Peter Kalpakiotis also raced at select rounds.

In the 2007 season Dillon Battisstini managed to beat Henri Karjalainen in the championship.  Other notable drivers include Morenon Soerapto, Oliver Turvey, Paul Ip, Don Tacos, Philip Forsman, Walter Grubmuller, Robin Tato, Edwin Jowsey and James Littlejohn.

In 2006, the championship saw the first two lady drivers of the series, namely Gaby dela Merced for Speedtech Asia Team Indonesia and Michele Bumgarner for Team Goddard. The series also saw the return of Roland Hermoso (2001 Formula Toyota champion) in Formula 3 racing driving alongside Gaby in Speedtech Asia Team Indonesia, and a new team was put up by Mandy Borja and Jonh O"Hara naming it Aran Racing.

While in 2005 saw numerous Filipino drivers joined the championship, namely Tyson Sy and JP Carino for Speedtech Asia, Dado Pena for Team Goddard, John Marcelo (brother of Jovy Marcelo) for Christian Jones Motorsports, Pepon Marave for Kinetic F3 Racing, Renan Morales for Fujitsu-Ten Team TOM'S, JP Tuason for Tuason Racing School and Enzo Pastor for Team T.E.C. Pilipnas.

As the series first inaugurated in the early 2000, numerous teams have joined the series, in 2002, Team Vertex of Marchy lee, Paul and Jeffrey Chan, Michael Ho and Johnathan Chan. Christian Jones Motorsports return in 2004 after competing in the last few rounds of the series in 2003, along with Team BRM of Australia. Team Goddard was renamed Minardi Asia Team Goddard after the former F1 team joined the series and collaborated with Mark Goddard's team, while in 2009, the team opted to join the Formula 3 Australia series leaving the Asian Formula 3 which it had won numerous drivers and teams championship.

[[Formula Three]] championships subscribe to the technical regulations that are set by the [[FIA]], and the Asian F3 Championship is no exception, but there are some important differences in this instance. Formula Three is traditionally an open formula, which means that it does not restrict competitors to a single chassis or engine. Most series now use single "control" suppliers for tires and fuel, both of which are subject to the FIA's regulations, but Asian F3 goes a step further by using a single engine builder ([[TOM'S|TOM's]]-[[Toyota]]) and prohibiting the latest chassis specifications according to their age. These measures are part of a dedicated effort to minimise running budgets. The tires are supplied by [[Yokohama Rubber Company|Yokohama]] (now are Dunlops).

Like the [[British Formula Three|British]], Spanish and [[Formula Three Euroseries|European]] championships, Asian F3 supports two championship classes: positioned below the ''International Class'' is a ''Promotions Class'' specifically for older chassis specifications. It is aimed primarily at younger, less experienced drivers. In the 2006 season, International Class drivers used the two-year-old [[Dallara]] F304 and the five-year-old F301, and Promotions Class drivers used the eight-year-old F398. Each of these specifications are part of a different three-year lifecycle in Dallara's update program.{{citation needed|date=October 2007}}

==Event schedule==
Each event in the championship is normally run to a four-day schedule. It comprises three races, plus three hours of free practice and one 30-minute qualifying session. The free practice is divided into six 30-minute sessions, split between the first two days of each four-day event. Qualifying is held on the third day, prior to the first race, with the second and third races held on the final day. Each race is at least 20 minutes in duration, over a distance of at least 40&amp;nbsp;km. Where a shorter two- or three-day schedule must be used, the dropped practice days are supplanted by equivalent test days earlier in the same week.

==Circuits==
The Asian F3 Championship visits circuits located throughout the Southeast Asian region, which have included [[Sentul International Circuit|Sentul]] in [[Indonesia]]; [[Zhuhai International Circuit|Zhuhai]] and Goldenport Park in [[China]]; [[Autopolis]] in [[Japan]]; and [[Subic International Raceway|Subic]] and [[Batangas Racing Circuit|Batangas]] in the [[Philippines]]. In 2007, Asian F3 visited [[Melbourne Grand Prix Circuit|Albert Park]] in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] as a support race for the 2007 [[Australian Grand Prix]].

== History ==
September 2014 the first founder event Bits &amp; Pretzels took place, which was founded by [[Andreas Bruckschlögl]] and Bernd Storm. Since January 2015, Felix Haas supports the team as the third co-host.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150618124240/http:/magazin.venturate.com/bits-pretzels-gruenderkonferenz-in-muenchen-september-2015/|title=Interview Bernd Storm/Felix Haas/Andreas Bruckschlögl: “Wir wollen mit Bits &amp; Pretzels die geilste Gründerkonferenz der Welt etablieren!” {{!}} Venturate Magazin|date=2015-06-18|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the first event in September 2014, 1,400 participants came together in the ballroom of the Löwenbraukeller in Munich. Among the first speakers were the founders of Qype, mydealz, Stylight, and [[XING]] and various start-up pitches took place. [[Ilse Aigner]], who is also the patron of the event, led a panel discussion on current political topics. The proceeds from the event were donated to the Munich Tafel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.itespresso.de/2014/09/26/bits-pretzels-gruender-geben-gruendern-tipps/|title=Bits &amp; Pretzels: Gründer geben Gründern Tipps - ITespresso.de|date=2014-09-26|work=ITespresso.de|access-date=2018-08-24|language=de-DE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wiwo.de/erfolg/gruender/wahl-des-unternehmensstandorts-das-sind-die-besten-staedte-fuer-gruender/10883820.html|title=Wahl des Unternehmensstandorts: Das sind die besten Städte für Gründer|last=Tönnesmann|first=Jens|website=www.wiwo.de|language=de|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third Bits &amp; Pretzels with around 3,500 participants took place from September 27-29, 2015. Instead of it being a breakfast, this event was planned as a three-day festival for the first time. The last day of the conference ended in the Schottenhamel tent at the [[Oktoberfest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://meedia.de/2016/09/26/lasst-euch-keinen-bullshit-andrehen-kevin-spaceys-fulminante-keynote-bei-den-bits-pretzels/|title=“Lasst Euch keinen Bullshit andrehen”: Kevin Spaceys fulminante Keynote bei den Bits &amp; Pretzels › Meedia|website=meedia.de|language=de|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The speakers included, among others, the CEO of Adidas Herbert Hainer or Niklas Östberg, CEO of Delivery Hero.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gruenderszene.de/allgemein/bits-and-pretzels-2017|title=Bits &amp; Pretzels: Das große Gründerfestival geht in die nächste Runde|date=2017-09-11|work=Gründerszene Magazin|access-date=2018-08-24|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From September 25-27, 2016, over 5000 participants came together for 4th Bits &amp; Pretzels.

From September 24-26, 2017, another 5,000 participants came together in Munich, after the number of participants for this event was capped. The speakers at the 2017 event included Stefan Raab, the former World (Soccer) Players of the Year [[Philipp Lahm]], and [[Oliver Kahn]], the American actress [[Carice van Houten]] (famous for her role in Game of Thrones) and the CEOs of adidas, Infineon and E.ON.

== Schedule ==
At Bits &amp; Pretzels, founders of national and international companies tell their success story and give tips. Keynotes, workshops, panel discussions, masterclasses, and a start-up competition are scheduled for the first two days of the conference at the International Congress Center in Munich. The speakers on the main stage wear Bavarian costume to combine Bavarian tradition with innovation. The third day of the event is all about networking, so once again all the participants come together at the Oktoberfest. Following the “Table Captain” principle, the young founders and investors network over beer and chicken in the packed Oktoberfest tent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.startupvalley.news/de/bits-pretzels-laedt-gruender-zum-oktoberfest/|title=Bits &amp; Pretzels lädt Gründer zum Oktoberfest|date=2016-07-21|work=Das Magazin für die Internationale Startup-Szene|access-date=2018-08-24|language=de-DE}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2017, “Topic Tables” revolving around one specific topic were introduced for the first time. With a Corporate Innovation stage and an Investor's stage, new areas of focus have been set in 2017. The topic of "matchmaking, was strengthened on site with a specially designated area to facilitate networking among the participants. In addition to industry-related content, an entertainment program with comedians and bands provided some diversion. In 2015, the Bavarian Comedian Harry G was on stage, and in 2016, the German band Sportfreunde Stiller gave a concert. In 2017, the band Moop Mama played in the Oktoberfest tent as a surprise. Previously implemented on a small scale, in 2017 the Bits &amp; Pretzels Start-up Night, during which even non-Bits &amp; Pretzels-participants were able to attend evening events all over Munich took place for the first time.

'''''Cleveland Abduction''''' is a 2015 American crime drama television film directed by [[Alex Kalymnios]] from a teleplay written by Stephen Tolkin. Based on the [[Ariel Castro kidnappings]], the film stars [[Taryn Manning]], [[Raymond Cruz]] and [[Joe Morton]]. It debuted May 2, 2015 on [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mylifetime.com/movies/cleveland-abduction |title=''Cleveland Abduction'' |publisher=Lifetime}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film is based on the memoir, ''[[Finding Me: A Decade of Darkness, a Life Reclaimed]]'' by Michelle Knight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/Finding-Me-Reclaimed-Cleveland-Kidnappings/dp/1602862796 |title=''Finding Me: A Decade of Darkness, a Life Reclaimed'' (Weinstein Books) |publisher=Amazon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Michelle Knight ([[Taryn Manning|Manning]]) was abducted by Ariel Castro ([[Raymond Cruz|Cruz]]) on August 23, 2002 in [[Cleveland|Cleveland, Ohio]]. She was held captive in his home for almost 11 years before finally being rescued on May 6, 2013. Finding strength through her belief in God and determined to be reunited with her son, Knight refused to be broken down by Castro. Soon thereafter Castro kidnaps, abducts and rapes two more girls, Amanda Berry ([[Samantha Droke|Droke]]) and Gina DeJesus (Sarife). These girls too become imprisoned along with Knight. They become friends and fellow victims, and they treat each other as sisters through their years in captivity.

When Berry became pregnant with Castro's child, it was Knight who delivered her baby, even performing CPR on the infant girl under the threat of Castro killing her if Berry's child didn't survive. Despite enduring more than a decade of brutality and captivity, Michelle's spirit would not be broken as her faith in the face of what she once thought would be a hopeless situation was a testament to the human spirit. On May 6, 2013, Michelle was rescued from the home that was her prison for nearly 11 years, and finally given the chance to reclaim her life.

* [[Taryn Manning]] as Michelle Knight
* [[Raymond Cruz]] as Ariel Castro

'''Ded Moroz''' ({{lang-ru|Дед Мороз}}, ''Ded Moroz'' {{IPA-ru|dʲɛt mɐˈros|}}; {{lang-be|Дзед Мароз}}, ''Dzyed Maróz''; {{lang-uk|Дід Мороз}}, ''Did Moróz''; Russian diminutive {{lang-ru|Дедушка Мороз}}, ''Dédushka Moróz''; {{lang-sr|Деда мраз}} / ''Deda Mraz''; also '''Morozko''' ({{lang-ru|Морозко}}) is a [[fictional character]] similar to that of [[Father Christmas]] and [[Santa Claus]] and has its roots in [[Slavs|Slavic]] mythology. The tradition of Ded Moroz is mostly spread in [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] countries. The literal translation is "Grandfather Frost", but depending on the language it can also be translated as "Old Man Frost". Ded Moroz is depicted as bringing presents to well-mannered children, often delivering them in person on [[New Year's Eve]].&lt;ref name="Ded Moroz and Snyegurochka by Jocelyn and Steve Oborn - 13 Dec 2009"&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate=2010-11-26
| publisher=jocelyneandsven.blogspot.com
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[East Slavs|East Slavic cultures]], Ded Moroz is accompanied by [[Snegurochka]] ({{lang-ru|Снегурочка}}, ''Snegurochka''; {{lang-uk|Снігуронька}}, ''Snihurónka''; "Snow Maiden"), his granddaughter and helper, who wears long silver-blue robes and a furry cap&lt;ref name="Snegurochka:  The Snow Maiden in Russian Culture by Kerry Kubilius"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a snowflake-like crown.&lt;ref name="Snowflake Girl"&gt;{{cite web
| url=http://www.worldofchristmas.net/christmas-world/ukraine.html
| title=Snowflake Girl
| accessdate=2017-06-17
}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is a unique attribute of Ded Moroz, since similar characters in other cultures do not have a female companion.&lt;ref name="Of Russian origin: Ded Moroz"/&gt;

Ded Moroz wears a heel-length [[Fur clothing|fur coat]], a semi-round fur hat, and ''[[valenki]]'' on his feet. He has a long white beard. He walks with a long [[Walking stick|magic staff]]&lt;ref name="Ded Moroz, the Russian Santa: Ded Moroz, or 'Grandfather Frost', is Russia's Santa Claus by Kerry Kubilius"&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate=2010-11-26
| publisher=About.com
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and often rides a [[Troika (driving)|troika]].

The residence of Ded Moroz in [[Russia]] is considered to be the town of [[Veliky Ustyug]], [[Vologda Oblast]].&lt;ref name="Ded Moroz, the Russian Santa: Ded Moroz, or 'Grandfather Frost', is Russia's Santa Claus by Kerry Kubilius" /&gt; The residence of the [[Belarus]]ian Dzyed Maroz is said to be in [[Białowieża Forest|Belavezhskaya Pushcha]].

Under the influence of [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] traditions, the character of Ded Moroz was transformed. Since the 19th century the attributes and legend of Ded Moroz have been shaped by literary influences. The play ''[[The Snow Maiden|Snegurochka]]'' by [[Aleksandr Ostrovsky]] was influential in this respect, as was [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]]'s ''[[The Snow Maiden|Snegurochka]]'' with [[libretto]] based on the play.&lt;ref name="Ded Moroz, the Russian Santa: Ded Moroz, or 'Grandfather Frost', is Russia's Santa Claus by Kerry Kubilius" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Christmas Customs in Eastern Europe:  Eastern Europe's Traditional Christmas Celebrations by Kerry Kubilius"&gt;{{cite web

Following the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], Christmas traditions were actively discouraged because they were considered to be "bourgeois and religious".&lt;ref name="Vzglyad"&gt;{{ru icon}}[http://vz.ru/society/2005/11/29/14107.html Fir Markets]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in 1928 Ded Moroz was declared "an ally of the priest and ''[[kulak]]''".&lt;ref name="Petrone"&gt;Karen Petrone, ''Life Has Become More Joyous, Comrades: Celebrations in the Time of Stalin'', Indiana University Press, 200, {{ISBN|0-253-33768-2}}, [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0253337682&amp;id=O_DSAvPZ7GAC&amp;pg=PA85&amp;lpg=PA85&amp;ots=VmH4K7zvZn&amp;dq=Postyshev+New+Year%27s+holiday&amp;sig=hJhRHf8ExeT0JMS8KXRIsNvYj2g Google Print, p.85]&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the image of Ded Moroz took its current form during [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] times, becoming the main symbol of the New Year’s holiday ([[Novy God]]) that replaced Christmas. Some Christmas traditions were revived following the famous letter by [[Pavel Postyshev]], published in ''[[Pravda]]'' on December 28, 1935.&lt;ref name=CBSNews/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vzglyad"/&gt; Postyshev believed that the origins of the holiday, which were pre-Christian, were less important than the benefits it could bring to Soviet children.&lt;ref name="Petrone"/&gt;

===Variations of Ded Moroz in ethnic minority groups of Russia===
Many ethnic minorities have for linguistic reasons other names for Ded Moroz or even have their own culture-equivalent counterparts to Ded Moroz. For example, in [[Bashkir language|Bashkir]] and [[Tatar language|Tatar]], Ded Moroz is known as ''[[:wikt:Ҡыш бабай|Ҡыш бабай]]'' (''Qïš babay'', literally: "Winter Old Man"). In [[Nenets language|Nenets]] he is known as ''[[Yamal Iri]]'' ("Grandfather of Yamal").&lt;ref name="chys"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gov.karelia.ru/Photos/photo_e.html?id=19892|title=Photo Archive|author=|date=|website=gov.karelia.ru|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Yakut language|Yakut]] indigenous people have their own counterpart to Ded Moroz, which is called ''[[Chys Khaan]]'' ("Master of Cold").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rbth.com/articles/2013/01/02/a_winter_bull_21395 |title= A winter bull |website=Russia Beyond |accessdate=February 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International relations of Ded Moroz==
Ded Moroz, and on occasion the Belarus ''Dzied Maroz'', are presented in the media as being in on-going [[détente]] with various counterparts from other cultures, such as the Estonian Santa Claus (''Jõuluvana'' or "Old man of Christmas"), the Finnish Santa Claus (''[[Joulupukki]]'' or "[[Yule Goat]]"), and other [[Santa Claus]], [[Father Christmas]], and [[Saint Nicholas]] figures.

In November 2009, for the first time, the Russian Federation offered competition to [[NORAD Tracks Santa]] with GLONASS Tracks Ded Moroz, which purports to use [[GLONASS]] (GLObal NAvigation Satellite System or "the Russian GPS") to track Ded Moroz on [[New Year's Eve]] (according to the [[Gregorian Calendar]]).&lt;ref name="What on earth is happening with ‘Russia's GPS’? by Julia Ioffe – Dec 1, 2009"&gt;{{cite news

==Regional differences and controversies==
There are equivalents of Ded Moroz and Snegurochka all over the [[former USSR]], as well as the countries once in the so-called [[Eastern bloc]] and in the former [[Yugoslavia]]. After the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union]], some of these countries made efforts to move away from Soviet and Russian heritage toward their own ancient traditions.

===Azerbaijan===
In [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], Ded Moroz is known as ''Şaxta Baba'' ("Grandfather Frost") and his companion Snegurochka is known as ''Qar Qızı'' ("Snow Girl"). In the predominantly Muslim but secular country, where Christians are a very small minority, this tradition remains very popular. ''Şaxta Baba'' brings gifts to children at New Year celebrations, however ''Qar Qızı'' is rarely present at the festivities.

===Belarus===
Ded Moroz is ''Dzied Maroz''  ({{lang-be|"Дзед Мароз"}}) in [[Belarusian language]]. He is not a historical folkloric Belarusian character.&lt;ref name="Dzied Maroz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usefulref.com/referencetopics/Christmas/Dzied_Maroz.html |title=Dzied Maroz |accessdate=2010-11-26 |publisher=On-Line Reference and Information |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717180358/http://www.usefulref.com/referencetopics/Christmas/Dzied_Maroz.html |archivedate=July 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Christmas and New Year in Belarus - 13 Dec 2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insego.com/christmas-and-new-year-in-belarus/ |title=Christmas and New Year in Belarus, 13 Dec 2007 |accessdate=2010-11-26 |publisher=Office for a Democratic Belarus |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123213855/http://democraticbelarus.eu/node/3060 |archivedate=November 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official residence of ''Dzied Maroz'' in Belarus is declared to be in [[Bialowieza Forest]].&lt;ref name="Dzied Maroz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Christmas and New Year in Belarus - 13 Dec 2007"/&gt;

===Bulgaria===
The Bulgarian name of Santa Claus is Дядо Коледа (''Dyado Koleda'', Grandfather [[Koleda]]), with ''Dyado Mraz'' (Дядо Мраз, "Grandfather Frost") being a similar Russian-imported character lacking the Christian connotations and thus popular during Communist rule. However, he has been largely forgotten since 1989, when ''Dyado Koleda'' again returned as the more popular figure.&lt;ref name="Traditions old and new: From Father Frost to Father Christmas by Petar Kostadinov – Dec 26, 2005"&gt;{{cite web

===Former Yugoslavia===
In [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|socialist Yugoslavia]] ([[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Croatia]], the [[Republic of Macedonia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Serbia]] and [[Slovenia]]) the character who was said to bring gifts to children was called "Grandfather Frost" ([[Bosnian language|Bosnian]]: ''Djed Mraz'' (Дјед Мраз) or ''Djeda Mraz'' (Дједа Мраз); [[Croatian language|Croatian]]: ''Djed Mraz'';  [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]: Дедо Мраз (''Dedo Mraz''); [[Serbian language|Serbian]]: Деда Мраз (''Deda Mraz''); [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]]: ''Dedek Mraz''). He was said to bring gifts for the [[New Year]] because public celebration of Christmas was frowned upon during communism.&lt;ref name="BALKANS: Religion Makes a Worrying Call - 11 May 2009"&gt;{{cite web

In [[Croatia]] after the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]], ''Djed Mraz'' was labeled communist creation and ''Djed Božićnjak'' (literally: "Grandfather Christmas") was introduced. Attempts were made in the mass media and advertising to replace ''Djed Mraz'' with ''Djed Božićnjak''. After 1999 the names of ''Djed Mraz'' and ''Djed Božićnjak'' became more or less synonymous, including in their use on public television.

Due to historical influence of Austrian culure in parts of Croatia, presents are also said to be brought by a traditional figure called ''Sveti Nikola'' ("[[Saint Nicholas]]") who closely resembles ''Djed Mraz'' or ''Djed Božićnjak'', except for the fact that he is accompanied by [[Krampus]] who takes misbehaving children away, another character from Central European folklore.&lt;ref name="Croatia Christmas Traditions:  Christmas in Croatia by Kerry Kubilius"&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Dedek Mraz.JPG|right|thumb|200px|A man dressed as ''Dedek Mraz'' in Slovenia.]]
In [[Slovenia]], the name ''Ded Moroz'' was translated from Russian as ''Dedek Mraz'' (literally, "Grandpa Frost"). ''Dedek Mraz'' is depicted as a slim man wearing a grey leather coat, which has fur inside and is decorated outside, and a round [[edible dormouse|dormouse]] fur cap. This version of the character is based on traditional imagery, especially as depicted by Maksim Gaspari in images commissioned in 1952.&lt;ref name="Zadnji"&gt;[http://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/kot-zadnji-od-decembrskih-obdarovalcev-je-tu-dedek-mraz.html "Kot zadnji od decembrskih obdarovalcev je tu dedek Mraz." 2014. ''24ur.com'' (28 December).] {{sl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the name was translated literally from the Soviet figure, other names for the character were also considered: ''Sneženi mož'' ("the Snow Man") and ''oca Triglav'' ("Daddy Triglav").&lt;ref name="Zadnji"/&gt; A female figure names ''babica Zima'' (Grandma Winter) was also proposed.&lt;ref name="Zadnji"/&gt; Initially he was said to live in [[Siberia]], but with the [[Informbiro]] crisis and the schism between Yugoslavia and the [[Soviet Union]] his home was relocated to Mt. [[Triglav]], Slovenia's (and also Yugoslavia's) highest peak. Public processions featuring the character began in Ljubljana in 1953.&lt;ref name="Zadnji"/&gt; The notion of Grandpa Frost was ideologically useful because it served to reorient the December/January holidays away from religion ([[Saint Nicholas Day]] and [[Christmas]]) and towards the secular [[New Year]].&lt;ref name="Zadnji"/&gt; After the ousting of Communism at the beginning of the 1990s, two other "good old men" (as they are currently styled in Slovenian) reappeared in public: ''Miklavž'' ("[[Saint Nicholas]]") is said to bring presents on December 6, and ''Božiček'' ("Christmas man"; usually depicted as Santa Claus) on [[Christmas Eve]]. St. Nicholas has had a strong traditional presence in Slovenian ethnic territory and his feast day remained celebrated in family circles throughout the Communist period. Until the late 1940s it was also said in some areas of Slovenia that [[Christkind]] (called ''Jezušček'' ("little Jesus") or ''Božiček'') brought gifts on Christmas Eve. Slovenian families have different preferences regarding their gift-giver of choice, according to political or religious persuasion. Slovenian popular culture depicts Grandpa Frost, Saint Nicholas and Santa Claus as friends&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dedekmraz.talija.com/|title=Dobri možje|author=|date=|website=dedekmraz.talija.com|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dnevnik.si/uploads/image_cache/7e45567245956709072f67abe70ee280.jpeg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111124163155/http://www.dnevnik.si/uploads/image_cache/7e45567245956709072f67abe70ee280.jpeg |archivedate=2011-11-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has also started blending attributes of the characters, for example, mention of Santa's reindeer is sometimes mingled into the Grandpa Frost narrative at public appearances.

===Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan===
[[Ayaz Ata]] is the Kazakh and Kyrgyz name for Ded Moroz.

===Poland===
While there is no traditional analog of Ded Moroz in Polish folklore, there was an attempt to introduce him as ''Dziadek Mróz'' during the [[History of Poland (1945-1989)|communist period]]. Communists, opposed to religion in general, considered Christmas and traditional ''Święty Mikołaj'' ([[Saint Nicholas]]) "ideologically hostile". {{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Therefore, propaganda attempted to replace him with Dziadek Mróz. Authorities often insisted on using the figure in schools and preschools during celebrations and events for children. This was also supposed to create an illusion of cultural links with the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="Wprost"&gt;*{{pl icon}} [http://www.wprost.pl/ar/?O=71301&amp;C=57 Dziadek Mróz versus Saint Nicholas], last accessed on 11 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romania===
{{See also|Moș Gerilă}}
In 1948, after the Communists gained power in Romania, it was decided that [[Christmas]] should not be celebrated. December 25 and December 26 became working days and no official celebrations were to be held. As a replacement for ''Moş Crăciun'' (Father Christmas), a new character was introduced, ''[[Moş Gerilă]]'' (literally "Old Man Frosty", a [[Romanian language]] adaptation of the Russian Ded Moroz).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.romanialibera.ro/exclusiv-rl/documentar/povestea-impostorului-mos-gerila-248844.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-01-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107212946/http://www.romanialibera.ro/exclusiv-rl/documentar/povestea-impostorului-mos-gerila-248844.html |archive-date=2012-01-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was said to bring gifts to children on December 31.

Officially, the [[New Year's Day]] celebrations began on 30 December, which was named the Day of the Republic, since it was the day when King [[Mihai I of Romania]] abdicated in 1947.

After the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], ''Moş Gerilă'' lost his influence, being replaced by ''Moş Crăciun''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Ro icon}} [http://stiri.rol.ro/stiri/2005/12/amintiri_cu_mos_gerila.htm Amintiri cu Moş Gerilă]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ("Memories with Moş Gerilă"), ''[[Evenimentul Zilei]]'', 24 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Scent of Christmas in Romania by Magdalena Chitic – Dec 2006"&gt;{{cite web

===Sakha Republic===
[[Chys Khan]] is known as the master of cold, accompanied by the snow maiden [[Khaarchana]].&lt;ref name="chys"/&gt;

===Tajikistan===
In Tajikistan the tradition of Ded Moroz has continued. In Tajik, Ded Moroz is known as ''Boboi Barfi'' ("Grandfather Snow"), and Snegurochka is called "Barfak" ("Snowball").

In 2012, a young man dressed as Ded Moroz was stabbed to death in [[Dushanbe]] by a crowd shouting "You infidel!". The murder was motivated by religious hatred, according to the Tajik police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Father Christmas' stabbed to death in Tajikistan |author=Roman Kozhevnikov |url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/01/03/tajikistan-fatherchristmas-idINDEE80202N20120103 |newspaper=[[Reuters]] |date=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 December 2013, Saidali Siddiqov, the first deputy head of the Committee for TV and Radio-broadcasting under the Government of Tajikistan, announced in an interview that "Father Frost, his maiden sidekick Snegurochka (Maiden Snow), and New Year’s tree will not appear on the state television this year, because these personages and attributes bear no direct relation to our national traditions, though there is no harm in them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Tajik official confirms information about banning Father Frost from New Year’s broadcasts |author=Asia-Plus|url=http://news.tj/en/news/tajik-official-confirms-information-about-banning-father-frost-new-year-s-broadcasts |newspaper=[[Asia-Plus]] |date=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However next day this was denounced, and planned celebrations did include these despite objections of some religious figures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ria.ru/world/20131217/984738389.html "В Таджикистане решили не запрещать Деда Мороза и Снегурочку"] (retrieved January 3, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ukraine===
In 2014, Ukraine has attempted to replace Ded Moroz with [[Saint Nicholas]] (Святий Микола, ''Sviatyi Mykolai'') which is more popular in Western Ukraine, as reported by [[Media of Russia|Russian media]].&lt;ref name=MT141120&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/kiev-brings-back-orthodox-santa-claus-instead-of-soviet-era-father-frost/511488.html |title= Kiev Brings Back Orthodox Santa Claus Instead of Soviet-Era Father Frost |work= [[The Moscow Times]] |date= 20 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uzbekistan===
In 2012, [[Uzbekistan]], a largely Muslim nation, moved away from celebrating Christmas and its historical characters.&lt;ref name=BBCNews&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.com/news/20701831|title= Father Christmas off air in Uzbekistan|work= BBCNews|date= 24 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dysfunctional Family Picnic''' was a multi-artist [[alternative rock]] concert, presented annually by the [[New York City|New York City, New York]], [[United States|USA]] radio station [[WNYL (FM)|K-Rock]], beginning in 1997. Its West Coast "sister" concert is the [[KROQ Weenie Roast]].

==History==
There have been various venues that hosted the Dysfunctional Family Picnic including [[West Side Tennis Club|Forest Hills Tennis Stadium]] in [[Queens|Queens, New York]], [[PNC Bank Arts Center]] in [[Holmdel]], [[New Jersey]], [[Giants Stadium]], in [[East Rutherford]], [[New Jersey]] and [[Jones Beach Amphitheatre]] in [[Wantagh]], [[New York (state)|New York]].

In 2003, the Dysfunctional Family Pinic was called "DFP 7-Tarium". Instead of booking an original show, it was just another stop on [[Metallica]]'s [[Summer Sanitarium]] tour.

After K-Rock returned to the air in 2007, "Return of Rock" was their first concert.

{{Population transfer}}
'''Evacuation in the Soviet Union''' was the mass migration of western Soviet citizens and its industries eastward as a result of [[Operation Barbarossa]], the German military invasion of June 1941.  Nearly sixteen million Soviet civilians and over 1,500 large factories were moved to areas in the middle or eastern part of the country by the end of 1941.&lt;ref name="Manley, Rebecca 2009, p.7-8"&gt;Manley, Rebecca, and Rebecca Manley. “To the Tashkent Station Evacuation and Survival in the Soviet Union at War.” To the Tashkent Station Evacuation and Survival in the Soviet Union at War, Cornell University Press, 2009, p.7-8&lt;/ref&gt;  Along with the eastern exodus of civilians and industries, other unintended consequences of the German advances saw the execution of previously held western state civilians by Soviet [[NKVD]] units,{{cn|date=November 2018}} the removal of [[Lenin's Mausoleum|Lenin's body]] from Moscow to Tyumen, and the relocation of the [[Hermitage Museum]] collection to [[Yekaterinburg|Sverdlovsk]], [[Samara, Russia|Kuybyshev]], the alternative capital of the Soviet Union 1941-1943. Soviet towns and cities inland or in the east received the bulk of the new refugees and high priority war factories, as locations such as the Siberian city of [[Novosibirsk]], received more than 140,000 refugees and many factories due to its location away from the front lines. Despite early German successes in seizing control of large swaths of the western USSR throughout 1943, and semi-prepared contingency plans by the Soviets in their mobilization plans to the east, Soviet industries would eventually outpace the Germans in arms production, culminating in 73,000 tanks, 82,000 aircraft and nearly 324,000 artillery pieces being dispersed throughout the Red Army in their fight against the [[Axis Powers]] by 1945.&lt;ref name="Freeze, Gregory L. 1997, p.330"&gt;Freeze, Gregory L.. Russia, A History, Oxford University Press, 1997, p.330&lt;/ref&gt;

== Governmental policy ==
With [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] and the Communist Party's Central Committee knowing that Hitler would eventually turn on the Soviet Union, there were plans made before [[Operation Barbarossa]] was launched to begin the evacuation as a precaution to Nazi assault. A Party man in Moscow involved in that city's evacuation committee, Vasilii Prokhorovich Pronin, submitted a plan that would have removed some one million Muscovites, but it was rejected by Stalin. It would have to wait for the actual invasion before the Party enacted any real plan for evacuation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stalin's World War II Evacuations: Triumph and Troubles in Kirov|last=Holmes|first=Larry E.|publisher=University of Kansas Press|year=|isbn=9780700623969|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two days after the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion]] of June 22, 1941, the Party created an Evacuation Council in an attempt to create a procedure for the coming evacuation of Soviet citizens living close to the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. It identified cities along major train routes of the USSR in which people could be removed and taken quickly because they were easily accessible by railroad. As of September, three months following the invasion by the Nazis, the Evacuation Council had 128 centers identified and operating. Prominent city centers that received evacuated citizens (as well as other resources and industry) include Kirov, Iaroslavl, Gorky, Ufa, Sverdlovsk, Cheliabinsk, and Kuibyshev.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Further measures were instated by the Party in order to help dispersed evacuees settle in to life in their new location. Evacuees new to a city were instructed to contact the local authorities so that they could be accounted for. Following this, they received a certificate declaring their evacuee status and allowing them to receive lodgings, food rations, and temporary employment. Evacuees were told that they were allowed to bring personal belongings with them as long as it didn't hinder the authorities' abilities to get them from the evacuated site to the refuge center. Family members' belongings were not to exceed 40 kilograms in weight.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another instruction from the Central Committee during the months of August and September was for regional governments to build temporary housing for the new-comers if there was not enough existing in that region already. This preceded the measure enacted in November when the Party agreed to establish an Evacuation Administration, thus taking the power out of the hands of regional authorities and centralizing it within the Communist Party. This led to offices of the said agency popping up throughout the evacuation center cities and regions so as to better regulate and look after the dispersed evacuees. The agents of the Evacuation Administration were in charge of making sure that the evacuees were being well taken care of in their new locations. An added concern, in addition to housing, employment, and food, was health care and child care. As of the early months of 1942, still under the one-year mark of being at war with Germany, the government in Moscow had already spent three billion rubles on the evacuation effort.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Deportation as a part of the evacuation ===
[[File:Crimean Tatar 1939-num.png|thumb|369x369px|[[Crimea]] region before the war showing the percentage of each section's population that was a Tatar|alt=|left]]
Another civilian population concern that came up after the German invasion was with a group of Soviet civilians who became a part of the evacuation, but were classified as deportees instead of evacuees. The Party feared that these deportees would switch loyalties and fight on the German side. The first of this process, that eventually affected as many as 3.3 million people made up of 52 different nationalities, was a decree published in 1941 that dealt with the removal of Volga Germans that sent them to Siberia and Kazakhstan, far away from the front lines of fighting between the [[Wehrmacht]] and Soviets. The rest of the evacuation of suspected-disloyal nationalities took place later in the war during the years of 1943 and 1944.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stalin and Stalinism, Third Edition|last=McCauley|first=Martin|publisher=Pearson Education|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the [[Volga Germans]] were one of two deported nationalities (the other being the Crimean Tatars) that were never returned to their homeland after the war had ended, modern historians interpret this as being within the parameters of an [[ethnic cleansing]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://soviethistory.msu.edu/1943-2/deportation-of-minorities/|title=Deportation of Minorities|date=2015-06-18|work=Seventeen Moments in Soviet History|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Crimean Tatars]] are an exception to the rule set by the Party that deportation occurred because they suspected questionable nationalities would be pro-German. The Tatars were a Muslim minority and the Party suspected that they would choose their religion over the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://soviethistory.msu.edu/1943-2/orthodox-patriarch-appointed/|title=Orthodox Patriarch Appointed|date=2015-06-18|work=Seventeen Moments in Soviet History|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians often trace the Soviet persecution and elimination of the Tatars in Crimea even further back to the inner war years after the establishment of the Soviet state. It is reported that from 1917 to 1933 an estimated half of the Crimean Tatar population was eliminated, either by death or relocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/116814/crimean-tatars-primer-why-population-opposes-putin|title=The Crimean Tatars: A Primer|work=The New Republic|access-date=2018-04-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deported nationalities generally came from regions close to the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] and were settled in Kazakhstan and Central Asia during the war.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1956, over a decade after the end of the Second World War, all of the groups besides the Volga Germans and the Crimean Tatars, were resettled in their native lands. Khrushchev would absolve all blame from the Germans during his time in command of the Communist Party. It is believed that they weren't permitted for resettlement because the area had already been settled by other Soviet civilians in the time since the war's end.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The same belief is expressed in regards to why the Crimean Tatars were not granted resettlement as a part of the 1956 orders. However, the Crimean Tatar National Movement Organization organized during [[perestroika]] in the 1980s finally received word from the Soviet government that their people could return to Crimea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iccrimea.org/scholarly/national-movement.html|title=Institutional Development of the Crimean Tatar National Movement|website=www.iccrimea.org|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, some 250,000 Crimean Tatars have returned and settled in what is now the independent [[Ukraine]], following the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse]] of the Soviet Union.

==Evacuation of industry==
The speed of the initial German advance threatened not only Soviet territories and factories, civilian and military, but wholesale collapse of the nation's civilian economy.&lt;ref name="Harrison, Mark 1945, p.79"&gt;Harrison, Mark. Soviet and East European Studies, Soviet Planning in Peace and War 1938-1945, Cambridge University Press, 1985, p.79&lt;/ref&gt; Even with 1930s contingency plans and the formation, in 1941, of evacuation committees, such as the Council for Evacuation and the State Department Committee (GKO), most evacuations were handled by local Soviet organizations that dealt with the industrial movements just ahead of impending German attacks.

Short sighted preparation in the overall mobilization of the western front led many in these councils to scour Moscow libraries for any resources pertaining to evacuations during the first World War.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Mark. Soviet and East European Studies,Soviet Planning in Peace and War 1938-1945, Cambridge University Press, 1985, p.79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Freeze, Gregory L. 1997, p.330"/&gt; Local committees eventually used the Five-Year Plan structure with 3,000 agents controlling the movement.  Evacuation of industrial plants began in August 1941 and continued until the end of the year.&lt;ref name="Dunn, Walter S 1945, p.32"&gt;Dunn, Walter S. Jr., The Soviet Economy and the Red Army 1930-1945, Praeger Publishers, 1995, p.32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harrison, Mark 1945, p.79"/&gt;

The GKO oversaw the relocation of more than 1500 plants of military importance to areas such as the Urals, Siberia, and Central Asia.  These areas offered safety to its inhabitants due to its isolated locations that were not in reach of damaging Axis airstrikes, and they offered Soviet industries with a mass quantity of resources to field the factories and plants associated with the war effort.  The Urals in central Russia fielded an impressive array of heavy iron and steel factories as well as agriculture and chemical plants.  The Siberian industries relied on their coal mines and copper deposits in the Kuznetzk coal basin for continuing the support of the Soviet war machine.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory L.. Russia, A History, Oxford University Press, 1997, p.330&lt;/ref&gt;

But evidence shows that some evacuations, the transfer of machine tools and skilled workers to “shadow factories” in the east, began much earlier.  The U.S. military attaché reported significant transfers of machines and men from the Moscow area to the east in late 1940 and early 1941.  The rapid growth in production early in 1942 suggests that the evacuation started in 1940.&lt;ref name="Dunn, Walter S 1945, p.32"/&gt;

== Evacuation of civilians ==

The word evacuation or ''evakuatsiia'' in 1941 was a somewhat new word that some described as “terrible and unaccustomed. For others, it was simply not used. "Refugee" or ''bezhenets'' was far too familiar given the country's history of war. During World War II refugee was replaced by evacuees.The shift in wording showed the government's resignation to the displacement of its citizens. The reasons for controlling the displaced population varied.&lt;ref&gt;4. Manley, Rebecca, and Rebecca Manley. “To the Tashkent Station Evacuation and Survival in the Soviet Union at War.” To the Tashkent Station Evacuation and Survival in the Soviet Union at War, Cornell University Press, 2009, p.7-8&lt;/ref&gt; Despite some preferring to consider themselves evacuees the term referred to different individuals. Some were of the  “privileged elite" class Those who fell under this category where scientist and specialized workers, artist, writers and politicians. These elite individuals were evacuated to the rear of the country. The other portion of the evacuated were meet with a suspicious eye. The evacuation process despite the Soviets best efforts, was far from organized. The state considered the majority of those heading east as suspicious. Since a large majority of the population were self evacuees they had not been assigned a location for displacement. Officials feared the disorder made it easy for deserters to flee. Evacuees who did not fall under the “privileged elite” title were are also suspected of potentially contaminating the rest of the population both epidemically and ideologically.&lt;ref&gt;18.	Manley, Rebecca. “The Perils of Displacement: The Soviet Evacuee between Refugee and Deportee.” Contemporary European History, vol. 16, no. 04, Nov. 2007, p. 499-500., doi:10.1017/s0960777307004146&lt;/ref&gt;

These policies were not formed as a humanitarian effort but as a way for the country to defend itself. They needed to avoid the past issues such as: hindrance of military movement, spread of disease, and demoralizing of units as well as strains on the economy.&lt;ref&gt;5.

[[File:Ru-Kurlenkovy-evac-kartochka.jpg|thumb|Evacuation card]]
German Operation Barbarossa of 1941 resulted in millions of Russian evacuees. The exact number is hard to approximate since many evacuated themselves rather than by the states directive.&lt;ref name="hdl.handle.net.ezproxy1.lib.asu.edu"&gt;15.	Harrison, Mark.

However, due to the vast number of refugees the train stations were overcrowded and the distribution of train tickets could take days.&lt;ref&gt;To the Tashkent Station. Evacuation and survival in the Soviet Union at war, by Rebecca Manley, Ithaca and London, Cornell University Press, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Even with the war drawing to an end evacuee’s who were desperate to go back home where not granted permission. The re-evacuation policy was written around those not working in industry. These citizens lost their residence to their city of origin, therefore were not part of the re-evacuation process. Anybody who tried to return without consent faced jail time. Despite many roadblocks and issues the Soviet state managed to do what no other European country could: evacuating millions of its citizens to the safety of the rear.&lt;ref&gt;20. Manley, Rebecca. “The Perils of Displacement: The Soviet Evacuee between Refugee and Deportee.” Contemporary European History, vol. 16, no. 04, Nov. 2007, p. 509., doi:10.1017/s0960777307004146&lt;/ref&gt;

With a shortage of labor, the Commissariat of Justice in conjunction with the Council of People’s Commissars forced evacuees to work in enterprises, organizations and on collective farms to help the war effort. Those chosen for the labor force were those deemed as socially unproductive. People who did not work for a set wage such as artist, writers and artisans were excluded from this new decree. Problems did arise with workers motivation to work. Some argued they would be going back home soon others were not happy with the wage they would receive arguing the government would give almost as much if they didn’t work.&lt;ref&gt;19.

As winter approached and the war intensified around Moscow the Moscow Oblast Committee of the Communist Party and the Executive Committee of the Moscow Oblast Council  found it of great importance to evacuate women and children from the suburbs. They request to the Evacuation Council of the Soviet Council of Peoples Commissariats was as follows 300,000 •	Assigned destinations •	People Commissariat of Transportation was to transport the evacuees from the Moscow suburbs&lt;ref&gt;13.

Moskva prifrontovaia, 1941 1942: Arkhivnye dokumenty i materialy. (Moscow: Izdatel stvo ob edineniia Mosgorarkhiv, 2001), p. 161. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; When it came to the evacuation of children officials were ill-prepared for the task. The children who were transported to Moscow were done so in barges which had no side railing. Subsequently, children would fall over board. First had accounts from children state that the boats had been previously used for the transportation of flour. Water was rarely given and when it was they were only allowed a few gulps from what was described as “putrid.” They slept on crowded floors. On one account a child wrote to his parents that he was eating well. He wrote about having bread and tea for breakfast, and for lunch he would eat cabbage soup.

== Jewish families in the Soviet Union ==
The Soviet Union had added nearly 2,000,000 Jews to its population between 1939 and 1940.&lt;ref name="muse.jhu.edu"/&gt; Many of these came from recently annexed Poland, but they came from other areas as well. After the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact the USSR and Germany each took over large portions of former countries, including Poland, the Baltic region, and Romania. In Romania, the USSR took mostly eastern portions, including Bessarabia and northern Bukovina. It is estimated that around 250,000 Jews were living in Bessarabia and Bukovina at the time.&lt;ref name="doi-org.ezproxy1.lib.asu.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://doi-org.ezproxy1.lib.asu.edu/10.1093/hgs/dct047|title=Estimating the Number of Jewish Refugees, Deportees, and Draftees from Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina in the Non-Occupied Soviet Territories|last1=Kaganovitch|first1=A.|website=Holocaust and Genocide Studies|pages=464–482|doi=10.1093/hgs/dct047}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another 120,000 Jews flowed into the newly annexed Bessarabia and Bukovina from the now Nazi occupied Romania.&lt;ref name="doi-org.ezproxy1.lib.asu.edu"/&gt; By the late spring of 1941 there were as many as 415,000 Jews living in Soviet controlled Bessarabia and Bukovina. Around 10,000 of these newly Soviet Jews were deported into the interior of Russia for various reasons, many of them ending up in the Red Army.&lt;ref name="doi-org.ezproxy1.lib.asu.edu"/&gt; There is evidence that the Soviet government made some efforts to incorporate these displaced Jewish citizens into Soviet society. The creation of the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee is one example of this.&lt;ref name="muse.jhu.edu"/&gt; Many Jews living in the now Nazi occupied parts of Romania and Poland were not keen to move to Russia, whose policies toward religion did not favor them. Many underestimated the dangers of the impending Nazi war machine and paid the ultimate price. Many Jews that fled into Russia from Germany had a saying, "better Stalin than Hitler"&lt;ref name="muse.jhu.edu"/&gt; There were as many as 3,000,000 Jews killed in The Soviet Union during World War II by the Einsatzgruppen.&lt;ref name="muse.jhu.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/48789|title=The Soviet Union, the Holocaust, and Auschwitz|last1=Asher|first1=Harvey|date=14 November 2003|website=Kritika: Explorations in Russian and Eurasian History|pages=886–912|language=en|doi=10.1353/kri.2003.0049}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

When Germany invaded Russia in 1941 most of the Jewish citizens living in these regions were murdered by the Nazis but some Jewish families fled east into Russia. While the Soviet Union did not keep records specifically relating to Jews, it is estimated that 300,000 Soviet citizens were evacuated from Moldavia to places like Kazakhstan.&lt;ref name="doi-org.ezproxy1.lib.asu.edu"/&gt; It is unknown how many of these citizens were Jewish. In February 1942 there were as many as 45,000 displaced Jewish citizens from the Moldavian region living in Uzbekistan.&lt;ref name="doi-org.ezproxy1.lib.asu.edu"/&gt; There were around 80,000 - 85,000 Jews from the Moldavian region displaced to each of the other Soviet states by early 1942.&lt;ref name="doi-org.ezproxy1.lib.asu.edu"/&gt;

== Lenin's body ==
In the face of the German advance and amidst the evacuations of industry and civilians, the [[Politburo]] made the decision to evacuate the embalmed body of [[Vladimir Lenin]] from [[Lenin's Mausoleum|its mausoleum]] in [[Red Square]], where it had been on display since 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Moscow 1941 : a city and its people at war|last1=Braithwaite|first1=Rodric|date=2007|publisher=Profile Books|isbn=9781861977748|edition=Rev. and updated paperback|location=London|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lenin’s body was removed in secret and sent far from the front lines  and away from any industrial areas threatened by German bombers. The city of [[Tyumen]], approximately 2,500 kilometers east of Moscow, was its chosen destination. In June 1941 Lenin’s body was encased in paraffin and placed in a wooden coffin that was then nested inside a larger wooden crate. Along with the body were sent chemicals and implements necessary for the continued preservation of the body. The crate was placed on a dedicated train secured by a selected group of Kremlin Guards. The body had its own private car and a personal guard around the clock. Additional soldiers were posted along the tracks and stations on the train’s route east.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Moscow 1941 : a city and its people at war|last1=Braithwaite|first1=Rodric|date=2007|publisher=Profile Books|isbn=9781861977748|edition=Rev. and updated paperback|location=London|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On arrival in Tyumen the body was housed in a dilapidated building on the campus of the Tyumen Agricultural Institute. The conditions necessitated the acquisition of additional chemicals and distilled water from the city of [[Omsk]], a further 600 kilometers east of Tyumen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Moscow 1941 : a city and its people at war|last1=Braithwaite|first1=Rodric|date=2007|publisher=Profile Books|isbn=9781861977748|edition=Rev. and updated paperback|location=London|pages=94–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lenin’s body was returned to Moscow in April 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tombs of the great leaders : a contemporary guide|last1=Leick|first1=Gwendolyn|date=2013|publisher=Reaktion Books, Limited|isbn=9781780232003|location=London|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1640">The '''Französisches Komödienhaus''' or '''French Comedy House''', was a theater in Berlin, active between 1774 to 1801. It was the first permanent 

Prior to 1742, Berlin was visited by travelling theater companies but had no permanent theater, until an opera house was founded by [[Frederick the Great]] that year.  The opera house was only used by Italian opera performers, and there where plans to found a theater house for French language stage actors as well. A German language theater house, [[Döbbelinsches Theater]], was active in the city from 1764, but French theater was the fashion and preferred by the monarch. The plans where finally realized in 1774 and the French theater was inaugurated in 1776.  The French theater was primarily frequented by the nobility and royal court and much favored by the king.  While its main rival, the German language Döbbelinsches Theater, was given no financial support at all by the king, he financed the French theater to great costs.  In 1786, the successor of Frederick the Great, [[Frederick William II of Prussia]], named the German language theater as royal theater and gave the localities of the former French theater to them, which was the beginning of a great age for German language theater in Berlin.

"'''Hey You'''" is a [[charity record|charity song]] written and recorded by American singer [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]. She co-produced the song with [[Pharrell Williams]] for the [[Live Earth]] campaign. It was released digitally on May 24, 2007 and was available on the CD and DVD of the Live Earth concerts on December 4, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://liveearth.org/en/press/pressrelease/live-earth-concerts-climate-crisis-digital-album-available-now |title=Live Earth – Digital Album Available Now |date=October 16, 2007 |publisher=[[Live Earth]] |accessdate=June 2, 2009 |author=Press Release |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100121025219/http://liveearth.org/en/press/pressrelease/live-earth-concerts-climate-crisis-digital-album-available-now |archivedate=January 21, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Musically it is a stripped-down, folksy ballad with straightforward, anthem-like lyrics talking about how to save the world from destruction. The song received generally mixed reviews, with one group of reviewers commenting that the modest message of the song was uninspiring while others called the song sweet and commended Madonna's commitment to charity.

"Hey You" was initially released as a free download for a period of seven days before being made available as a regular digital single. Once it had been released as a regular digital single, it entered the lower reaches of the sales charts of a few countries including the United Kingdom, Canada, Sweden and Switzerland. Madonna only performed the song once at the [[Live Earth concert, London]], where she was joined by a choir of school children who provided backing vocals to her singing while the backdrops displayed images relevant to the song's message, like natural devastations, different cultures  and political leaders.

==Background==
"Hey You" was written by Madonna,&lt;ref name="writer"/&gt; who also co-produced it along with [[Pharrell Williams]] in honor of the 2007 [[Live Earth]] concert in [[Live Earth concert, London|London]]. It was inspired by the climate change campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6665483.stm|title=Madonna pens song for Live Earth|first=Andie|last=Crueger|date=May 17, 2007|publisher=BBC|accessdate=May 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became Madonna's first released material to be written entirely by herself since "[[Gambler (Madonna song)|Gambler]]" (1985).&lt;ref name="writer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warnerchappell.com/song-details/WW008801988000|title=Hey You|publisher=[[Warner/Chappell Music]]|accessdate=February 19, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219054951/http://www.warnerchappell.com/song-details/WW008801988000|archivedate=February 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Live Earth]] was a music event that brought together more than hundred headlining artists in a series of concerts, two billion people and launched a mass movement to combat climate crisis. The concerts took place in cities like New York, London, Sydney, Tokyo, Shanghai, Rio de Janeiro etc. It marked the beginning of a multi-year campaign led by The Alliance for Climate Protection to move individuals, corporations and governments to take action.&lt;ref name="liveearth"/&gt; The song was made available to be downloaded in [[MP3]] and [[Windows Media Audio|WMA]] formats on [[MSN|MSN's Live Earth]] website.&lt;ref name="liveearth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://liveearth.org/en/press/pressrelease/madonna-writes-new-song-hey-you-for-live-earth |title=Madonna writes new song 'Hey You' for Live Earth |date=May 17, 2007 |author=Press Release |publisher=Live Earth |accessdate=May 20, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621034725/http://liveearth.org/en/press/pressrelease/madonna-writes-new-song-hey-you-for-live-earth |archivedate=June 21, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Microsoft]] pledged to donate $0.25 per download to the "Alliance for Global Climate Change" society for the first million downloads of the track.&lt;ref name="eonline"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b55180_Hey_You_Madonnas_Got_a_New_Song.html|title="Hey You," Madonna's Got a New Song|last=Hall|first=Sarah|date=May 17, 2007|publisher=[[E!]]|accessdate=May 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Live Earth]] founder Kevin Wall said in a statement, "We are thrilled that Madonna donated her art to Live Earth and is a part of this movement for us."&lt;ref name="eonline"/&gt;

"Hey You" is a stripped-down, straightforward mid-tempo [[ballad]]&lt;ref name="atlantic"/&gt; with influences of [[folk music|folk]] in it and features lyrics like "Hey you/ Don't you give up/ It's not so bad/ There's still a chance for us."&lt;ref name="eonline"/&gt; The lyric conveys the message that purifying your own soul can open the way, by which one can change the mind of others.&lt;ref name="atlantic"/&gt; According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', the lyrics have straightforward, anthem-like meaning with lines like "You can change someone else/Then you have saved someone else/ But you must first love yourself."&lt;ref name="nytimeswaltz"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/07/07/live-earthmadonnas-uplifting-waltz/|title=Live Earth: Madonna’s Uplifting Waltz|last=Pareles|authorlink=Jon Pareles|first=Jon|date=July 27, 2007|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=May 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daryl Davis from [[Blogcritics]] felt that "Hey You" is about making the world a better place. The song begins with the sound of [[Steel-string acoustic guitar|acoustic guitars]], leading to an instrumental [[chorus effect|chorus]], which according to Davis, is "simple and touching".&lt;ref name="blog"/&gt;

==Critical reception==
Sarah Hall from ''[[E!|E! Online]]'' called the song to be unlikely inspiring to the listeners to hit the dance floor.&lt;ref name="eonline"/&gt; [[Jon Pareles]] from ''[[The New York Times]]'', while reviewing the [[Live Earth]] concert in London, said that the song and its lyrics like "Don’t you give up/it’s not so bad" are not exactly eloquent.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/09/arts/music/09eart.html|title=An Alignment of the Stars in a Plea for Green Heard Round the Planet|last=Pareles|first=Jon|authorlink=Jon Pareles|date=July 9, 2007|work=The New York Times|accessdate=May 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; While reviewing Madonna's album ''[[Hard Candy (Madonna album)|Hard Candy]]'', he commented that "Hey You" failed to be the equivalent of Madonna's cover version of [[John Lennon]]'s song "[[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]]". He also noted that "[t]he song came and went, raising some corporate donations".&lt;ref name="nytimes2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/27/arts/music/27pare.html|title=Material Woman, Restoring Her Brand|last=Pareles|first=Jon|date=April 27, 2008|work=The New York Times|authorlink=Jon Pareles|accessdate=May 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alessandra Stanley from ''The New York Times'' commented that the song had a modest message with lines like "Don't you give up/it's not so bad/there's still a chance for us."&lt;ref name="nytimessound"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A07EEDC103EF93AA35754C0A9619C8B63|title=Sounding the Global-Warming Alarm Without Upsetting the Fans |last=Stanley|first=Alessandra|date=July 7, 2007|work=The New York Times|accessdate=May 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Hirschorn from ''[[The Atlantic|The Atlantic Monthly]]'' said that the song was proof that Madonna's heart was in the right place.&lt;ref name="atlantic"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hirschorn|first=Michael|date=November 13, 2007|title=Falling Stars|journal=[[The Atlantic|The Atlantic Monthly]]|location=Boston|volume=300|issue=4|pages=171|issn=1072-7825}}&lt;/ref&gt; Responses from the Madonna fansites were also mixed with some fans decrying the track's message as overly sentimental and the lyrics as weak, while others defended the song as "sweet" and "not that bad," while commending the singer's commitment to charity.&lt;ref name="eonline"/&gt; Daryl D from [[Blogcritics]] felt that "even if the lyrics are slightly clichéd, Madonna gives her best vocal performance since the ''[[Evita (soundtrack)|Evita]]'' years and adds feeling when the lyrics falter.... The production on this record is outstanding. It also proves that Madonna brings more to the table on her own records than her critics give her credit for because this sounds absolutely nothing like a song Pharrell Williams would produce. The acoustic guitars at the beginning lead to an instrumental chorus that is simple and touching."&lt;ref name="blog"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogcritics.org/music/article/music-review-madonna-hey-you/page-2/ |title=Music Review: Madonna – "Hey You" – Page 2 |date=May 17, 2007 |accessdate=June 4, 2010 |publisher=[[Blogcritics]] |last=Davis |first=Daryl |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120924061101/http://blogcritics.org/music/article/music-review-madonna-hey-you/page-2/ |archivedate=September 24, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada the song entered for one week on the [[Canadian Hot 100]] chart at position fifty-seven and was present for one week only.&lt;ref name="canada"/&gt; In Switzerland, it entered the chart at number 60, but fell down to number 91 the next week.

The song was not eligible to chart on [[Hot Digital Songs]] since free downloads are not applicable in the chart per ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' and [[Nielsen SoundScan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1051075/ask-billboard|title=Ask Billboard: Free To Be...

==Live performance==

On May 17, 2007, [[Warner Bros. Records]] announced Madonna as one of the seventeen headliners performing at [[Wembley Stadium]] for the [[Live Earth concert, London|London stop]] of the [[Live Earth]] concerts. It is still the only venue where Madonna has performed the song.&lt;ref name="liveearth"/&gt; Madonna's set list was the last performance of the London leg before the concert moved to [[New York City]]. "Hey You" was the first of the set list which consisted of a total of four songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/content_display/genre/e3ibd4edd86c815e4a074221105386ef0db|title=Live Earth London Wraps With Madonna Spectacular |last=Sutherland|first=Mark|date=July 7, 2007|work=Billboard|accessdate=May 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also used as the bridging music between the bands performing at Wembley. The performance started with the symbolic turning-off of lights of the stadium which plunged it into darkness except for the lights on the stage and that from the cameras. Actor [[Terence Stamp]] who compered the show, declared "Let’s not be endarkened by this, let's be enlighteened by this.

Madonna started singing the song while holding the amplifier in her hand. The backdrop imitated the song's message by displaying a procession of images of environmental devastations like fires, [[nuclear power|nuclear power plants]], suffering animals—which altered with images of visionary leaders like [[Nelson Mandela]], [[Aung San Suu Kyi]], [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Mahatma Gandhi]], and current political leaders like [[George W. Bush]], [[Gordon Brown]] and [[Nicolas Sarkozy]].&lt;ref name="atlantic"/&gt; The video progressed to display the image of underdressed but nonetheless festive [[Africa|African children]] tossing a globe into the air, where it resolved into an image of the Earth as seen from space.&lt;ref name="atlantic"/&gt; The idea of the video was to transpose the images of the world leaders with natural disasters.&lt;ref name="nme"/&gt; The lyrics of the song were also projected as [[Surtitles|supertitles]].&lt;ref name="nytimeswaltz"/&gt; Backing vocals were provided by the children. The performance ended with Madonna and the kids coming in front of the stage and [[salute|saluting]] the crowd.&lt;ref name="mtv"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.co.uk/events/live-earth/news/40398-madonna-jump-for-earth|title=Madge closes Live Earth with a bouncing, planet-saving set|last=Lewis|first=Derence|date=July 7, 2007|publisher=[[MTV]]|accessdate=May 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Indonesia Fair''' ({{lang-id|'''Pekan Raya Indonesia''' or '''PRI'''}}) is a [[fair]] held annually. The goal of the fair is to promote the growth of the economy of [[Indonesia]] through the [[Meetings, incentives, conferencing, exhibitions|MICE]] industry (meeting, incentive, convention, and exhibition ).

==History==
The first Pekan Raya Indonesia was held between 29 August to 4 October 1953, officially known as "The First Indonesian International Trade &amp; Industrial Fair". China was the main international exhibitor.

It had branches in [[Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic|Estonia]], [[Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic|Latvia]], [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic|Lithuania]] and [[Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic|Moldova]].

}} ({{lang-bn|মুক্তিযুদ্ধ}} ''Muktijuddho'') was a revolutionary [[war of independence|independence war]] in South Asia during 1971 which established the republic of [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/bangladesh/17.htm Library of Congress]&lt;/ref&gt; The war pitted [[East Pakistan]]  against [[West Pakistan]], and lasted over a duration of nine months. It witnessed [[1971 Bangladesh atrocities|large-scale atrocities]], the exodus of 10&amp;nbsp;million refugees and the displacement of 30&amp;nbsp;million people.&lt;ref&gt;en, Samuel; Paul Robert Bartrop, Steven L. Jacobs. Dictionary of Genocide: A-L. Volume 1: Greenwood. p. 34. {{ISBN|978-0-313-32967-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The war broke out on 26 March 1971, when the [[Pakistani Army]] launched a military operation called [[Operation Searchlight]] against [[Bengali people|Bengali]] civilians, students, [[intelligentsia]] and armed personnel, who were demanding that the Pakistani military junta accept the results of the [[Pakistani general election, 1970|1970 first democratic elections of Pakistan]], which were won by an eastern party, or to allow separation between East and West Pakistan. Bengali politicians and army officers announced the [[Bangladeshi declaration of independence|declaration of Bangladesh's independence]] in response to Operation Searchlight. Bengali military, paramilitary and civilians formed the [[Mukti Bahini]] ({{lang-bn|মুক্তি বাহিনী}} "Liberation Army"), which engaged in [[guerrilla warfare]] against Pakistani forces.

[[India]] entered the war on 3 December 1971, after Pakistan launched pre-emptive [[Operation Chengiz Khan|air strikes]] on northern India. Overwhelmed by [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|two war fronts]], Pakistani defences soon collapsed. On 16 December, the [[Mitro Bahini|Allied Forces]] of Bangladesh and India defeated Pakistan in the east. The subsequent [[Instrument of Surrender (1971)|surrender]] resulted in the largest number of [[prisoners-of-war]] since [[World War II]].

== Foreign reaction ==

=== United Nations ===
Though the United Nations condemned the human rights violations during and following Operation Searchlight, it failed to defuse the situation politically before the start of the war.

Following Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's declaration of independence in March 1971, India undertook a worldwide campaign to drum up political, democratic and humanitarian support for the people of Bangladesh for their liberation struggle. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi toured a large number of countries in a bid to create awareness of the Pakistani atrocities against Bengalis. This effort was to prove vital later during the war, in framing the world's context of the war and to justify military action by India.&lt;ref name="recog-story"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bdsdf.org/forum/index.php?showtopic=3072|title=The Recognition Story|publisher=Bangladesh Strategic and Development Forum|accessdate=17 August 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725050939/http://www.bdsdf.org/forum/index.php?showtopic=3072|archivedate=25 July 2011|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, following Pakistan's defeat, it ensured prompt recognition of the newly independent state of Bangladesh.

Following India's entry into the war, Pakistan, fearing certain defeat, made urgent appeals to the United Nations to intervene and force India to agree to a [[cease fire]]. The [[UN Security Council]] assembled on 4 December 1971 to discuss the hostilities in South Asia. After lengthy discussions on 7 December, the United States made a resolution for "immediate cease-fire and withdrawal of troops". While supported by the majority, the USSR vetoed the resolution twice and the United Kingdom and France abstained on the resolution.

On 12 December, with Pakistan facing imminent defeat, the United States requested that the Security Council be reconvened. Pakistan's Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was rushed to New York City to make the case for a resolution on the cease fire. The council continued deliberations for four days. By the time proposals were finalised, Pakistan's forces in the East had surrendered and the war had ended, making the measures merely academic. Bhutto, frustrated by the failure of the resolution and the inaction of the United Nations, ripped up his speech and left the council.

Most UN member nations were quick to recognise Bangladesh within months of its independence.&lt;ref name="recog-story" /&gt;

===Bhutan===
[[Bhutan]] became the first country in the world (second India) to recognise the newly independent state on 6 December 1971. [[Muhammad Ullah]], the 3rd [[President of Bangladesh]] visited Bhutan accompanied by his wife to attend the coronation of [[Jigme Singye Wangchuck]], the fourth King of Bhutan in June 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Constitution Issued: Rahman Resigns |agency=Associated Press |publisher=The Altus Times-Democrat, via Google News |location=Altus, Oklahoma, USA |date=11 January 1972 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_nBDAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LK4MAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2255,530825 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bangladesh-Bhutan Relations|url=http://www.bangladeshembassy.bt/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=14&amp;Itemid=14|publisher=Embassy of Bangladesh in Bhutan|accessdate=25 September 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706162636/http://www.bangladeshembassy.bt/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=14&amp;Itemid=14|archivedate=6 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="B"&gt;{{cite book|title=Indo-Bhutan relations and China interventions|author=Lal Babu Yadav|publisher=Anmol Publications Pvt.

Nixon and [[Henry Kissinger]] feared Soviet expansion into South and Southeast Asia. Pakistan was a close ally of the People's Republic of China, with whom Nixon had been negotiating a ''[[Sino-American relations#Rapprochement|rapprochement]]'' and which he intended to visit in February 1972. Nixon feared that an Indian invasion of [[West Pakistan]] would mean total Soviet domination of the region, and that it would seriously undermine the global position of the United States and the regional position of America's new tacit ally, China. To demonstrate to China the ''bona fides'' of the United States as an ally, and in direct violation of the US Congress-imposed sanctions on Pakistan, Nixon sent military supplies to Pakistan and routed them through Jordan and Iran,&lt;ref name="Shalom"&gt;Shalom, Stephen R., [http://coat.ncf.ca/our_magazine/links/issue47/articles/a07.htm The Men Behind Yahya in the Indo-Pak War of 1971]&lt;/ref&gt; while also encouraging China to increase its arms supplies to Pakistan. The Nixon administration also ignored reports it received of the genocidal activities of the Pakistani Army in East Pakistan, most notably the [[Archer Blood|Blood telegram]].

The Soviet Union supported Bangladesh and Indian armies, as well as the [[Mukti Bahini]] during the war, recognising that the independence of Bangladesh would weaken the position of its rivals – the United States and China. It gave assurances to India that if a confrontation with the United States or China developed, the USSR would take countermeasures. This was enshrined in the [[Indo-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation|Indo-Soviet friendship treaty]] signed in August 1971. The Soviets also sent a nuclear submarine to ward off the threat posed by USS ''Enterprise'' in the Indian Ocean.

At the end of the war, the [[Warsaw Pact]] countries were among the first to recognise Bangladesh. The Soviet Union accorded recognition to Bangladesh on 25 January 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=USSR, Czechoslovakia Recognize Bangladesh |agency=Associated Press |publisher=The Sumter Daily Item, via Google News |location=Sumter, South Carolina, USA |date=25 January 1972 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0dIoAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gQYGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2219,2272476 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States delayed recognition for some months, before according it on 8 April 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nixon Hopes for Subcontinent Peace |agency=Associated Press |publisher=Herald-Journal, via Google News |location=Spartanburg, South Carolina, USA |date=9 April 1972 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5TMsAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5ssEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3505,1398456 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China ===
As a long-standing ally of Pakistan, the People's Republic of China reacted with alarm to the evolving situation in East Pakistan and the prospect of India invading West Pakistan and Pakistani-controlled [[Kashmir]]. Believing that just such an Indian attack was imminent, Nixon encouraged China to mobilise its armed forces along its border with India to discourage it. The Chinese did not, however, respond to this encouragement, because unlike the [[1962 Sino-Indian War]] when India was caught entirely unaware, this time the Indian Army was prepared and had deployed eight mountain divisions to the Sino-Indian border to guard against such an eventuality. China instead threw its weight behind demands for an immediate ceasefire.

When Bangladesh applied for membership to the United Nations in 1972, China vetoed their application&lt;ref name="oxnard"&gt;{{cite news |title=China Recognizes Bangladesh |agency=Associated Press |publisher=The Press Courier, via Google News |location=Oxnard, California, USA |date=1 September 1975 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rnVKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RSINAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4237,20391 }}&lt;/ref&gt; because two United Nations resolutions regarding the repatriation of Pakistani prisoners of war and civilians had not yet been implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=China Veto Downs Bangladesh UN Entry |agency=United Press International |date=26 August 1972 |publisher=The Montreal Gazette, via Google News |location=Montreal, Quebec, Canada |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GQsyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=w6EFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4712,6055847 }}&lt;/ref&gt; China was also among the last countries to recognise independent Bangladesh, refusing to do so until 31 August 1975.&lt;ref name="recog-story" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oxnard" /&gt;

At the [[2010 MTV Video Music Awards]], American singer [[Lady Gaga]] wore a dress made of raw [[beef]], which was commonly referred to by the media as the '''meat dress'''.&lt;ref name="mtvdesigner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guardianangers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="designerhuffington"/&gt; Designed by [[Franc Fernandez]] and styled by [[Nicola Formichetti]], the dress was condemned by animal rights groups, and named by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' as the top fashion statement of 2010.

The press speculated on the originality of the meat dress idea, with comparisons made to similar images found in contemporary art and popular culture. As with her other dresses, it was archived, but went on display in 2011 at the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] after being preserved by [[taxidermist]]s as a type of [[jerky]]. Gaga explained following the awards ceremony that the dress was a statement about one's need to fight for what one believes in, and highlighted her distaste for the US military's [[Don't ask, don't tell|don't-ask-don't-tell]] policy.

==Background==
Gaga was the most nominated artist at 2010's Video Music Awards with a record thirteen nominations, including two nods for [[MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year|Video of the Year]] (the first female artist to achieve this feat).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1644956/lady-gaga-eminem-top-vma-nominations/|title=Lady Gaga, Eminem Top VMA Nominations|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|date=August 3, 2010|publisher=MTV News|accessdate=May 20, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505132012/http://www.mtv.com/news/1644956/lady-gaga-eminem-top-vma-nominations/|archivedate=May 5, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; She arrived in an [[Alexander McQueen]] dress and changed into a [[Giorgio Armani]] number before donning her third and final outfit of the evening: a dress, hat, boots, and purse made of raw meat. Gaga wore the meat dress to accept her Video of the Year trophy for "[[Bad Romance]]"; as she accepted the award from presenter [[Cher]], she joked, "I never thought I'd be asking Cher to hold my meat purse."&lt;ref name="ganz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://music.yahoo.com/blogs/stop-the-presses/meet-the-mystery-meat-dress-lady-gaga-explains-rare-vmas-outfit.html|title=Meet the Mystery Meat Dress: Lady Gaga Explains Rare VMAs Outfit|last=Ganz|first=Caryn|date=September 12, 2010|archivedate=December 25, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111225012039/http://music.yahoo.com/blogs/stop-the-presses/meet-the-mystery-meat-dress-lady-gaga-explains-rare-vmas-outfit.html|publisher=[[Yahoo!

"But it did make me ask myself, what's the difference between her outfit and an outfit made of leather?"&lt;ref name="marquee"/&gt;

Fernandez said of his design, "I knew the dress would be one of other amazing pieces Gaga wore that night. It's very well made and looked great on her, on and off camera. We didn't get a chance to have a fitting. The only time she had it on was for the VMAs. Only when I saw it in the monitor did I know it would be big."&lt;ref name=designerhuffington /&gt;

Fernandez reporting Gaga's opinion in an interview said that Gaga herself said it smelled good, because it smelled like meat.&lt;ref name=mtvdesigner /&gt; The designer talked of what was to happen to the dress after the awards show, "The dress will be put in an archive with all of her dresses. The Gaga Archives, I suppose. It won't last, that's the beauty of it. When it is brought out again, hopefully it will be in a retrospective, and it will be a different dress, which is the best thing. I like the idea of it changing and evolving into something else".&lt;ref name=mtvdesigner /&gt; He later explained that the dress would be preserved and made into a type of [[jerky (food)|jerky]] before being archived.&lt;ref name=jerky&gt;{{cite web|last=Gornstein|first=Leslie|title=Did anyone ever eat Lady Gaga's meat dress?|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/39311642/ns/today-entertainment/t/did-anyone-ever-eat-lady-gagas-meat-dress/|accessdate=May 14, 2011|publisher=[[E!]]|date=September 22, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325022326/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/39311642/ns/today-entertainment/t/did-anyone-ever-eat-lady-gagas-meat-dress|archivedate=March 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] paid $6,000 to taxidermist Sergio Vigilato to preserve the dress. It had been frozen following the two television appearances, although Vigilato discovered signs of decomposition on the dress which had occurred prior to it being frozen, and noted it was emitting an odor once it was defrosted. It was treated with bleach, [[formaldehyde]] and detergent to kill any bacteria which had formed, and was reconditioned by being dyed dark red once it was preserved so to give it the same appearance as when first worn. However, after the preservation there were several pieces of beef left over and not included in the reworked dress.&lt;ref name=preserves&gt;{{cite web|last=Pool |first=Bob |title=Taxidermist preserves Lady Gaga's meat dress for posterity |url=https://vancouversun.com/travel/Taxidermist+preserves+Lady+Gaga+meat+dress+posterity/5145206/story.html |accessdate=July 31, 2011 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=July 22, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726020721/http://www.vancouversun.com/travel/Taxidermist%2Bpreserves%2BLady%2BGaga%2Bmeat%2Bdress%2Bposterity/5145206/story.html |archivedate=July 26, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Following the VMAs, media outlets attempted to analyse the meaning of the dress with suggestions by [[BBC News]] ranging from [[anti-fashion]], to [[feminism]], aging and decay, and society's attitude towards meat. Chef [[Fergus Henderson]] explained this meat attitude as "People often don't want meat to look like meat. They want it to be neatly wrapped in plastic from a supermarket."&lt;ref name=interpret&gt;{{cite news|last=Winterman|first=Denise|last2=Kelly|first2=Jon|title=Five interpretations of Lady Gaga's meat dress|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-11297832|accessdate=May 14, 2011|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=September 14, 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100915042148/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-11297832|archivedate=September 15, 2010|df=mdy-all|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA) condemned the dress, releasing a statement that said "wearing a dress made from cuts of dead cows is offensive enough to bring comment, but someone should whisper in her ear that more people are upset by butchery than are impressed by it."&lt;ref name=meattelegraph&gt;{{cite news|last=Roberts|first=Laura|title=Lady Gaga's meat dress divides opinion|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/8001267/Lady-Gagas-meat-dress-divides-opinion.html|accessdate=May 14, 2011|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=September 14, 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914221630/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/8001267/Lady-Gagas-meat-dress-divides-opinion.html|archivedate=September 14, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=peta&gt;{{cite web|last=Newkirk|first=Ingrid E.|title=Lady Gaga's Meat Dress|url=http://www.peta.org/blog/lady-gagas-meat-dress/|date=September 13, 2010|publisher=[[PETA]]|accessdate=September 13, 2010|deadurl=no|archivedate=July 24, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160724024859/http://www.peta.org/blog/lady-gagas-meat-dress/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vegetarian Society also condemned the dress, releasing a statement that said "No matter how beautifully it is presented, flesh from a tortured animal is flesh from a tortured animal.

An earlier example of a garment made from meat stitched together in the same way as the Lady Gaga meat dress was worn at the [[Slade School of Art]] postgraduate degree exhibition opening in London, England in July 1979, when [[performance artist]] Robert Connolly wore a two-piece suit made of slices of [[salami]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2010/sep/20/salami-style|title=Letters: Salami style|accessdate=September 16, 2016|date=September 20, 2010|newspaper=The Guardian|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927153640/https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2010/sep/20/salami-style|archivedate=September 27, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some media sources proposed that the dress could be interpreted as anti-[[vegan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is Lady Gaga's Meat Couture an Anti-Vegan Statement?|url=https://www.good.is/articles/is-lady-gaga-s-meat-couture-an-anti-vegan-statement|work=[[Good (magazine)|Good]]|date=September 13, 2010|accessdate=September 16, 2016|first=Alissa|last=Walker|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917085052/https://www.good.is/articles/is-lady-gaga-s-meat-couture-an-anti-vegan-statement|archivedate=September 17, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vegetarian singer [[Morrissey]] stated that he felt the dress was acceptable as long as it was a social or political statement, and not just a "loony idea",&lt;ref name=morrisseydress&gt;{{cite news|last=Deacon|first=Michael|title=Morrissey on...

And, I am not a piece of meat."&lt;ref name=meattelegraph/&gt; She explained further that she was also using the dress to highlight her distaste for the US military's "[[don't ask, don't tell]]" policy.&lt;ref name=mtvtalks&gt;{{cite web|last=Kaufman|first=Gil|title=Lady Gaga Talks VMA Meat Suit With Ellen DeGeneres|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1647701/lady-gaga-talks-vma-meat-suit-with-ellen-degeneres/|publisher=MTV News|accessdate=November 28, 2011|date=September 13, 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102053246/http://www.mtv.com/news/1647701/lady-gaga-talks-vma-meat-suit-with-ellen-degeneres/|archivedate=November 2, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Liliʻuokalani''' ({{IPA-haw|liˌliʔuokəˈlɐni}}&lt;!--As a compound word (lili'u-o-ka-lani), the stress needs checking, different sources give different patterns.--&gt;; born '''Lydia Liliʻu Loloku Walania Kamakaʻeha'''; September 2, 1838 – November 11, 1917) was the first [[queen regnant]] and the last sovereign monarch of the [[Kingdom of Hawaii|Kingdom of Hawaiʻi]], ruling from January 29, 1891, until the [[overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii|overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi]] on January 17, 1893. The composer of "[[Aloha ʻOe]]" and numerous other works, she wrote her autobiography ''[[Hawaii's Story by Hawaii's Queen|Hawaiʻi's Story by Hawaiʻi's Queen]]'' during her imprisonment following the overthrow.

Liliʻuokalani was born on September 2, 1838, in [[Honolulu]], on the island of [[Oahu|Oʻahu]]. While her natural parents were [[Keohokālole|Analea Keohokālole]] and [[Kapaakea|Caesar Kapaʻakea]], she was ''[[hānai]]'' (informally adopted) at birth by [[Pākī|Abner Pākī]] and [[Kōnia|Laura Kōnia]] and raised with their daughter [[Bernice Pauahi Bishop]]. Baptized as a Christian and educated at the [[Royal School (Hawaii)|Royal School]], she and her siblings and cousins were proclaimed eligible for the throne by King [[Kamehameha III]]. She was married to American-born [[John Owen Dominis]], who later became the [[Governor of Oahu|Governor of Oʻahu]]. The couple had no biological children but adopted several. After the accession of her brother [[Kalākaua|David Kalākaua]] to the throne in 1874, she and her siblings were given Western style titles of Prince and Princess. In 1877, after her younger brother [[Leleiohoku II]]'s death, she was proclaimed as heir apparent to the throne. During the [[Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria|Golden Jubilee]] of [[Queen Victoria]], she represented her brother as an official envoy to the United Kingdom.

Liliʻuokalani ascended to the throne on January 29, 1891, nine days after her brother's death. During her reign, she attempted to draft a [[Proposed 1893 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii|new constitution]] which would restore the power of the monarchy and the voting rights of the economically disenfranchised. Threatened by her attempts to abrogate the [[Bayonet Constitution]], pro-American elements in Hawaiʻi [[Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii|overthrew]] the monarchy on January 17, 1893. The overthrow was bolstered by the landing of US Marines under [[John L. Stevens]] to protect American interests, which rendered the monarchy unable to protect itself.

The coup d'état established the [[Republic of Hawaii|Republic of Hawaiʻi]], but the ultimate goal was the annexation of the islands to the United States, which was temporarily blocked by President [[Grover Cleveland]]. After an [[1895 Counter-revolution in Hawaii|unsuccessful uprising to restore the monarchy]], the oligarchical government placed the former queen under house arrest at the [[ʻIolani Palace]]. On January 24, 1895, Liliʻuokalani was forced to abdicate the Hawaiian throne, officially ending the deposed monarchy. Attempts were made to restore the monarchy and [[Opposition to the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii|oppose annexation]], but with the outbreak of the [[Spanish–American War]], the United States [[Annexation of Hawaii|annexed Hawaiʻi]]. Living out the remainder of her later life as a private citizen, Liliʻuokalani [[Death and funeral of Liliuokalani|died]] at her residence, [[Washington Place]], in Honolulu on November 11, 1917.

She was born in the large grass hut of her maternal grandfather, [[Aikanaka (father of Keohokālole)|ʻAikanaka]], at the base of [[Punchbowl Crater]] in [[Honolulu]] on the island of [[Oahu|Oʻahu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Liliuokalani|1898|pages=1–4}}; {{harvnb|Allen|1982|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|The area was traditionally referred to as Mana, Manamana, Honolulu and later became the site of [[The Queen's Medical Center|The Queen's Hospital]].&lt;ref name="Mana"&gt;{{harvnb|Kanahele|1999|page=105}}; {{cite news|title=La Hanau o ke Kama Aliiwahine Liliu|newspaper=Ka Nupepa Kuokoa|location=Honolulu|date=September 4, 1875|volume=XIV|issue=36|page=2|url=http://nupepa.org/gsdl2.5/cgi-bin/nupepa?e=d-0nupepa--00-0-0--010---4----text-prev--0-1l--1haw-Zz-1--en-20-about--20-00031-0000utfZz-8-00-0003-1-0000utfZz-8-00&amp;a=d&amp;cl=CL1.24.15&amp;d=HASHc325b95aa0f37c0b812dee.2|accessdate=September 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}} According to Hawaiian custom, she was named after an event linked to her birth. At the time she was born, ''[[Kuhina Nui]]'' (regent) [[Kīnaʻu|Elizabeth Kīnaʻu]] had developed an eye infection. She named the child using the words; ''liliʻu'' (smarting), ''loloku'' (tearful), ''walania'' (a burning pain) and ''kamakaʻeha'' (sore eyes).{{sfn|Pukui|Elbert|1986|pages=38, 206, 211. 224 ,381}}&lt;ref name="Names"&gt;{{harvnb|Haley|2014|page=232}}; {{harvnb|Allen|1982|page=36}}; {{harvnb|Siler|2012|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon her baptism by Reverend Levi Chamberlain, she was given the Christian name Lydia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Allen|1982|page=40}}; {{harvnb|Cooke|Cooke|1937|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lydia Kamakaeha.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Liliʻuokalani in her youth, c. 1853]]
Her family were of the [[aliʻi]] class of the Hawaiian nobility and were collateral relations of the reigning [[House of Kamehameha]], sharing common descent from the 18th-century ''aliʻi nui'' (supreme monarch) [[Keaweʻīkekahialiʻiokamoku]]. From her biological parents, she descended from [[Keaweaheulu]] and [[Kameʻeiamoku]], two of the five royal counselors of [[Kamehameha I]] during his conquest of the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]]. Kameʻeiamoku, the grandfather of both her mother and father, was depicted, along with his royal twin Kamanawa, on the Hawaiian coat of arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Liliuokalani|1898|pages=1–2, 104–105, 399–409}}; {{harvnb|Pratt|1920|pages=34–36}}; {{harvnb|Allen|1982|pp=33–36}}; {{harvnb|Haley|2014|page=96}}; {{harvnb|Gregg|1982|pages=316–317, 528, 571, 581}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liliʻuokalani referred to her family line as the "Keawe-a-Heulu line" after her mother's line.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Liliuokalani|1898|pp=104–105}}; {{harvnb|Kuykendall|1967|page=262}}; {{harvnb|Osorio|2002|p=201}}; {{harvnb|Van Dyke|2008|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third surviving child of a large family, her biological siblings included: [[James Kaliokalani]], [[Kalākaua|David Kalākaua]], [[Anna Kaiulani|Anna Kaʻiulani]], [[Kaiminaauao|Kaʻiminaʻauao]], [[Likelike|Miriam Likelike]] and [[Leleiohoku II|William Pitt Leleiohoku II]].{{sfn|Liliuokalani|1898|page=399}} She and her siblings were ''[[hānai]]'' (informally adopted) to other family members.

After the boarding school was discontinued in 1850, Liliʻuokalani lived with her ''hānai'' parents at [[Haleʻākala]], which she referred to in later life as her childhood home. Around this time, her ''hānai'' sister Pauahi married the American [[Charles Reed Bishop]] against the wishes of their parents but reconciled with them shortly before Pākī's death in 1855. Kōnia died two years afterward and Liliʻuokalani came under the Bishops' guardianship. During this period, Liliʻuokalani became a part of the young social elite under the reign of [[Kamehameha IV]] who ascended to the throne in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Allen|1982|pages=69–84}}; {{harvnb|King|Roth|2006|page=21}}; {{cite news|last=Taylor|first=Albert Pierce|title=Court Beauties of Fifty Years Ago|newspaper=The Pacific Commercial Advertiser|location=Honolulu|date=June 12, 1910|volume=VII|issue=388|page=13|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85047084/1910-06-12/ed-1/seq-13/|accessdate=September 26, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109054043/http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85047084/1910-06-12/ed-1/seq-13/|archivedate=January 9, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1856, Kamehameha IV announced his intent to marry [[Queen Emma of Hawaii|Emma Rooke]], one of their classmates.

Marriage consideration had begun early on for her. American merchant [[Gorham D. Gilman]], a houseguest of the Pākīs, had courted her unsuccessfully when she was fifteen. Around the time of Kōnia's final illness in 1857, Liliʻuokalani was briefly engaged to [[Lunalilo|William Charles Lunalilo]]. They shared an interest in music composition and had known each other from childhood. He had been betrothed from birth to Princess Victoria, the king's sister, but disagreements with her brothers prevented the marriage from materializing. Thus, Lunalilo proposed to Liliʻuokalani during a trip to [[Lahaina]] to be with Kōnia. A short-lived dual engagement occurred in which Liliʻuokalani was matched to Lunalilo and her brother Kalakaua to Princess Victoria. She ultimately broke off the engagement because of the urging of King Kamehameha IV and the opposition of the Bishops to the union.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Allen|1982|pages=77, 84–89}}; {{harvnb|Haley|2014|page=217}}; {{harvnb|Liliuokalani|1898|pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Historian Helena G.

From 1860 to 1862, Liliʻuokalani and Dominis were engaged with the wedding set on her twenty-fourth birthday. This was postponed to September 16, 1862, out of respect for the death of Prince [[Albert Kamehameha]], son of Kamehameha IV and Queen Emma. The wedding was held at Haleʻākala, the residence of the Bishops. The ceremony was officiated by Reverend [[Samuel Chenery Damon]] in the [[Church of Hawaii|Anglican]] rites. Her bridemaids were her former classmates [[Elizabeth Kekaʻaniau]] and Martha Swinton. King Kamehameha IV and other members of the royal family were honored guests.

=== Death of Kalākaua ===
{{Main|Death and two state funerals of Kalākaua}}

Kalākaua arrived in California aboard the [[USS Charleston (C-2)|USS ''Charleston'']] on November 25, 1890. There was uncertainty as to the purpose of the king's trip. Minister of Foreign Affairs [[John Adams Cummins]] reported that the trip was solely for the king's health and would not extend beyond California, while local newspapers and the British commissioner James Hay Wodehouse speculated that the king might go further east to Washington, D.C. to negotiate a treaty to extend the existing exclusive US access rights to Pearl Harbor, or the annexation of the kingdom. The [[McKinley Tariff]] Act had crippled the Hawaiian sugar industry by removing the duties on sugar imports from other countries into the US, eliminating the previous Hawaiian duty-free advantage under the [[Reciprocity Treaty of 1875]].{{sfn|Kuykendall|1967|pages=466

== Reign ==
On January 29, 1891, in the presence of the cabinet ministers and the supreme court justices, Liliʻuokalani took the oath of office to uphold the constitution, and became the first and only queen of the Kingdom of Hawaii.{{sfn|Kuykendall|1967|pages=474–476}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=By Authority|newspaper=The Daily Bulletin|location=Honolulu|date=January 30, 1891|volume=XV|issue=25|at=Image 2, col. 1|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82016412/1891-01-30/ed-1/seq-2/|accessdate=October 15, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171003030701/http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82016412/1891-01-30/ed-1/seq-2/|archivedate=October 3, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first few weeks of her reign were obscured by the funeral of her brother. After the end of the period of mourning, one of her first acts was to request the formal resignation of the holdover cabinet from her brother's reign. These ministers refused, and asked for a ruling by the Hawaii Supreme Court. All the justices but one ruled in favor of the Queen's decision, and the ministers resigned. Liliʻuokalani appointed [[Samuel Parker (Hawaii)|Samuel Parker]], [[Hermann A. Widemann]], and [[William A. Whiting]], and reappointed Charles N. Spencer (from the hold-over cabinet), as her new cabinet ministers. On March 9, with the approval of the House of Nobles, as required by the Hawaiian constitution, she named as successor her niece [[Kaʻiulani]], the only daughter of [[Archibald Scott Cleghorn]] and her sister Princess Likelike, who had died in 1887.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kuykendall|1967|pages=476–478}}; {{harvnb|Allen|1982|pages=245}}; {{cite news|title=The Succession Princess Kaiulani Proclaimed Successor to the Hawaiian Throne|newspaper=The Daily Bulletin|location=Honolulu|date=March 9, 1891|volume=XV|issue=57|at=Image 2, col. 2|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82016412/1891-03-09/ed-1/seq-2/|accessdate=October 15, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171003030844/http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82016412/1891-03-09/ed-1/seq-2/|archivedate=October 3, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; From April to July, Liliʻuokalani paid the customary visits to the main Hawaiian Islands, including a revisit to the leper settlement of [[Kalaupapa Leprosy Settlement and National Historical Park|Kalaupapa]].

From May 1892 to January 1893, the legislature of the Kingdom convened for an unprecedented 171 days, which later historians such as Albertine Loomis and Helena G. Allen dubbed the "[[1892 Legislative Session of the Kingdom of Hawaii|Longest Legislature]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Loomis|1963|pages=7–27}}; {{harvnb|Allen|1982|pages=269–270}}&lt;/ref&gt; This session was dominated by political infighting between and within the four parties: [[National Reform Party (Hawaii)|National Reform]], [[Reform Party (Hawaii)|Reform]], [[National Liberal Party (Hawaii)|National Liberal]] and Independent; none were able to gain a majority. Debates heard on the floor of the houses concerned the popular demand for a new constitution and the passage of a [[lottery]] bill and an [[opium]] licensing bill, aimed at alleviating the economic crisis caused by the McKinley Tariff. The main issues of contention between the new monarch and the legislators were the retention of her cabinet ministers, since political division prevented Liliʻuokalani from appointing a balanced council and the 1887 constitution gave the legislature the power to vote for the dismissal of her cabinet. Seven resolutions of want of confidence were introduced during this session, and four of her self-appointed cabinets (the Widemann, [[Edward C. Macfarlane|Macfarlane]], [[William H. Cornwell|Cornwell]], and [[George Norton Wilcox|Wilcox]] cabinets) were ousted by votes of the legislature. On January 13, 1893, after the legislature dismissed the George Norton Wilcox cabinet (which had political sympathies to the Reform Party), Liliʻuokalani appointed the new Parker cabinet consisting of Samuel Parker, as minister of foreign affairs; [[John F. Colburn]], as minister of the interior; William H. Cornwell, as minister of finance; and [[Arthur P. Peterson]], as attorney general.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kuykendall|1967|pages=562–563, 573–581}}; {{harvnb|Allen|1982|page=174–175}}; {{harvnb|Moblo|1998|pages=229–232}}; {{cite news|title=A New Cabinet – Some New Ministers for the Public to Swallow|newspaper=The Pacific Commercial Advertiser|location=Honolulu|date=January 14, 1893|volume=XVII|issue=3277|page=4|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85047084/1893-01-14/ed-1/seq-4/|accessdate=November 12, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109053928/http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85047084/1893-01-14/ed-1/seq-4/|archivedate=January 9, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had chosen these men specifically to support her plan of promulgating a new constitution while the legislature was not in session.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kuykendall|1967|pages=581–583}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Promulgating a new constitution ===
{{Main|Proposed 1893 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii}}
The precipitating event{{sfn|Kuykendall|1967|page=582}} leading to the 1893 overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii was the attempt by Queen Liliʻuokalani to promulgate a new constitution to regain powers for the monarchy and Native Hawaiians that had been lost under the Bayonet Constitution. Her opponents, who were led by two Hawaiian citizens [[Lorrin A. Thurston]] and W. O. Smith and included six Hawaiian citizens, five U.S. citizens and one German citizen,{{sfn|Blount|1895|page=588}}. Outraged by her attempt to promulgate a new constitution, they moved to depose the Queen, overthrow the monarchy, and seek Hawaii's annexation to the United States.{{#tag:ref|"W.D. Alexander (''History of Later Years of the Hawaiian Monarchy and the Revolution of 1893'', {{harvnb|Alexander|1896|page=37}}) gives the following as the wording of Thurston's motion [to launch the coup]: 'That preliminary steps be taken at once to form and declare a Provisional Government with a view to annexation to the United States.' Thurston later wrote that his motion was 'substantially as follows: "I move that it is the sense of this meeting that the solution of the present situation is annexation to the United States."'(''Memoirs'', p. 250) Lt. Lucien Young (''The Boston at Hawaii'', p. 175) gives the following version of the motion: 'Resolved, That it is the sense of this committee that in view of the present unsatisfactory state of affairs, the proper course to pursue is to abolish the monarchy and apply for annexation to the United States.'"{{sfn|Kuykendall|1967|pages=587–588}}|group=note}}{{sfn|Russ|1959|page=90}}

Shortly after her accession, Liliʻuokalani began to receive petitions to re-write the Bayonet Constitution{{#tag:ref|The [[Bayonet Constitution]] was named because it had been signed by the previous monarch under threat of violence from a militia composed of armed American and Europeans calling themselves the "[[Honolulu Rifles]]".{{sfn|Lee|1993|pages=4–5}}|group=note}} through the two major political parties of the time, Hui Kālaiʻāina and the National Reform Party.{{#tag:ref|"She&amp;nbsp;... defended her act[ions] by showing that, out of a possible 9,500 native voters in 1892, 6,500 asked for a new Constitution."{{sfn|Russ|1959|page=67}}|group=note}} Supported by two-thirds of the registered voters,{{sfn|Lobo|Talbot|Carlston|2016|page=122}} she moved to abrogate the existing 1887 constitution, but her cabinet withheld their support, knowing what her opponents' likely response would be.{{#tag:ref|The Queen's new cabinet "had been in office less than a week, and whatever they thought about the need for a new constitution ... they knew enough about the temper of the queen's opponents to realize that they would endure the chance to challenge her, and no minister of the crown could look forward ... to that confrontation".{{sfn|Daws|1968|page=271}}|group=note}}

The [[Proposed 1893 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii|proposed constitution]] (co-written by the Queen and two legislators, [[Joseph Nāwahī]] and [[William Pūnohu White]]) would have restored the power to the monarchy, and voting rights to economically disenfranchised native Hawaiians and Asians.{{sfn|Daws|1968|page=271}}{{sfn|Kuykendall|1967|pages=582–586}} Her ministers and closest friends were all opposed to this plan; they tried unsuccessfully to dissuade her from pursuing these initiatives, both of which came to be used against her in the brewing constitutional crisis.{{sfn|Blount|1895|page=496}}

=== Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii ===

The political fallout led to citywide political rallies and meetings in Honolulu. Anti-monarchists, annexationists, and leading Reform Party politicians that included [[Lorrin A. Thurston]], a grandson of American missionaries, and Kalākaua's former cabinet ministers under the Bayonet Constitution, formed the [[Committee of Safety (Hawaii)|Committee of Safety]] in protest of the "revolutionary" action of the queen and conspired to depose her.&lt;ref name="Meetings" /&gt; Thurston and the Committee of Safety derived their support primarily from the American and European business class residing in Hawaiʻi. Most of the leaders of the overthrow were American and European citizens who were also Kingdom subjects. They also included legislators, government officers, and a justice of the Hawaiian Supreme Court.{{sfn|Twigg-Smith|1998|pages=135–166}}{{sfn|Andrade|1996|page=130}}

In response, [[royalists]] and loyalists formed the Committee of Law and Order and met at the palace square on January{{nbsp}}16, 1893. Nāwahī, White, Robert W. Wilcox, and other pro-monarchist leaders gave speeches in support for the queen and the government. To try to appease the instigators, the queen and her supporters abandoned attempts to unilaterally promulgate a constitution .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Popular Meeting – Over Two Thousand Person Assemble on Palace Square – They Pass a Resolution Upholding the Queen and the Government|newspaper=The Daily Bulletin|location=Honolulu|date=January 17, 1893|volume=|issue=|page=2|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82016412/1893-01-17/ed-1/seq-2/|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171119064916/http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82016412/1893-01-17/ed-1/seq-2/|archivedate=November 19, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Meetings"&gt;{{harvnb|Kuykendall|1967|pages=586–594}}; {{harvnb|Alexander|1896|pages=37–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same day, the Marshal of the Kingdom, [[Charles Burnett Wilson]], was tipped off by detectives to the imminent planned coup. Wilson requested [[Warrant (law)|warrants]] to arrest the 13-member council of the Committee of Safety, and put the Kingdom under [[martial law]]. Because the members had strong political ties to [[United States Minister to Hawaii]] [[John L. Stevens]], the requests were repeatedly denied by the queen's cabinet, who feared that the arrests would escalate the situation. After a failed negotiation with Thurston,{{sfn|Twombly|1900|page=333}} Wilson began to collect his men for the confrontation. Wilson and captain of the [[Royal Guards of Hawaii|Royal Household Guard]] [[Samuel Nowlein]] had rallied a force of 496 men who were kept at hand to protect the queen.{{sfn|Young|1899|page=252}} [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] from the [[USS Boston (1884)|USS ''Boston'']] and two companies of US sailors landed and took up positions at the US Legation, the Consulate, and Arion Hall. The sailors and Marines did not enter the palace grounds or take over any buildings, and never fired a shot, but their presence served effectively in intimidating royalist defenders. Historian William Russ states, "the injunction to prevent fighting of any kind made it impossible for the monarchy to protect itself".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Russ|1959|page=350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The queen was deposed on January 17, and the [[Provisional Government of Hawaii|provisional government]] established under pro-annexation leader [[Sanford B. Dole]] was officially recognized by Stevens as the ''[[de facto]]'' government.{{sfn|Liliuokalani|1898|pages=387–388}}{{sfn|Allen|1982|page=294}}{{sfn|Alexander|1896|page=65}} She temporarily relinquished her throne to the United States, rather than the Dole-led government, in hopes that the United States would restore Hawaii's sovereignty to the rightful holder.{{sfn|Tabrah|1984|page=102}} The government under Dole began using ʻIolani Palace as its executive building.{{sfn|Alexander|1896|page=66}}{{sfn|Siler|2012|page=250}} A delegation departed for Washington D.C. on January 19, to ask for immediate annexation by the United States.{{sfn|Kuykendall|1967|pages=605–610}} At the request of the provisional government, Stevens proclaimed Hawaii a protectorate of the United States on February 1, to temporarily provide a buffer against domestic upheaval and interference by foreign governments.{{sfn|Kuykendall|1967|pages=599–605}}{{sfn|Alexander|1896|pages=66–67}} The US flag was raised over the palace, and [[martial law]] was enforced. The annexation treaty presented to the US Senate contained a provision to grant Liliʻuokalani a $20,000 per annum lifetime pension, and Kaʻiulani a lump-sum payment of $150,000. The queen protested the proposed annexation in a January 19 letter to President [[Benjamin Harrison]]. She sent Prince [[David Kawānanakoa]] and [[Paul Neumann (Attorney General)|Paul Neumann]] to represent her.{{sfn|Alexander|1896|pages=71–76}}

Neumann delivered a letter from the queen to Grover Cleveland, who began his second non-consecutive term as president on March 4.{{sfn|Alexander|1896|page=74}} The Cleveland administration commissioned the [[Blount Report]], and based on its findings, concluded that the overthrow of Liliʻuokalani was illegal, and that Stevens and American military troops had acted inappropriately in support of those who carried out the overthrow. On November 16, Cleveland sent his minister [[Albert S. Willis]] to propose a return of the throne to Liliʻuokalani if she granted amnesty to everyone responsible. Her first response was that Hawaiian law called for property confiscation and the death penalty for treason, and that only her cabinet ministers could put aside the law in favor of amnesty.{{sfn|Calhoun|1988|page=150}}{{sfn|Love|2005|page=112}}{{sfn|Cleaver|2014|page=29}}{{sfn|Kuykendall|1967|page=642}}   Liliuokalani's extreme position lost her the goodwill of the Cleveland administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Warren Zimmermann|title=First Great Triumph: How Five Americans Made Their Country a World Power|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_TPg3gNPWqQC&amp;pg=PA290|year=2004|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|page=290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cleveland sent the issue to the Congress, stating, "The Provisional Government has not assumed a republican, or other constitutional form, but has remained a mere executive council, or oligarchy, without the consent of the people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=|first1=|title=Hawaiian Situation: The President's Message to Congress|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82016187/1893-12-21/ed-1/seq-8/|accessdate=October 19, 2017|work=The National Tribune|location=Washington D.C.|date=December 21, 1893|at=p. 8, col. 4|via=[[Chronicling America]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171109084436/http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82016187/1893-12-21/ed-1/seq-8/|archivedate=November 9, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The queen changed her position on the issue of amnesty, and on December 18, Willis demanded the provisional government reinstate her to the throne, but was refused.

At the beginning of January 1895, Robert W.

Its ultimate failure led to the arrest of many of the participants and other sympathizers of the monarchy.

In June 1897 President McKinley signed the "Treaty for the Annexation for the Hawaiian Islands", but it failed to pass in the [[United States Senate]] after the [[Kūʻē Petitions]] were submitted by a commission of Native Hawaiian delegates consisting of [[James Keauiluna Kaulia]], [[David Kalauokalani]], [[William Auld (Hawaii)|William Auld]], and [[John Richardson (Hawaii)|John Richardson]]. Members of Hui Aloha ʻĀina collected over 21,000 signatures opposing an annexation treaty. Another 17,000 signatures were collected by members of Hui Kālaiʻāina but not submitted to the Senate because those signatures were also asking for restoration of the Queen. The petitions collectively were presented as evidence of the strong grassroots opposition of the Hawaiian community to annexation, and the treaty was defeated in the Senate— however, following its failure, Hawaii was annexed anyway via the [[Newlands Resolution]], a [[joint resolution]] of Congress, in July 1898, shortly after the outbreak of the Spanish–American War.{{sfn|Haley|2014|pages=317–336}}&lt;ref name="SilvaPetition"&gt;{{harvnb|Silva|2004|pages=123–163}}; {{cite web|last=Silva |first=Noenoe K. |title=The 1897 Petitions Protesting Annexation |work=The Annexation Of Hawaii: A Collection Of Document |year=1998 |publisher=University of Hawaii at Manoa |url=http://libweb.hawaii.edu/digicoll/annexation/petition/pet-intro.php |accessdate=December 19, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230013831/http://libweb.hawaii.edu/digicoll/annexation/petition/pet-intro.php |archivedate=December 30, 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Parker|2007|page=205}}{{sfn|Mehmed|1998|pages=142–143}}

== Crown Lands of Hawaii ==
Prior to the 1848 division of land known as the [[Great Māhele]], during the reign of Kamehameha III, all land in Hawaii was owned by the monarchy. The Great Māhele subdivided the land among the monarchy, the government, and private ownership by tenants living on the land. What was reserved for the monarchy became known as the Crown Lands of Hawaii.{{sfn|Linnekin|1983|page=173}} When Hawaii was annexed, the Crown Lands were seized by the United States government. The Queen gave George Macfarlane her power of attorney in 1898 as part of her legal defense team in seeking indemnity for the government's seizure of the Crown Lands. She filed a protest with the United States Senate on December 20, 1898, requesting their return and claiming the lands were seized without due process or recompense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=HAWAII'S EX-QUEEN: Protests Against the Seizure of Her Property|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Herald-Express|The Herald]]|location=Los Angeles|date=December 21, 1898|volume=26|issue=82|at=Image 1. col. 3|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85042461/1898-12-21/ed-1/seq-1/|accessdate=October 15, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228124422/http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85042461/1898-12-21/ed-1/seq-1/|archivedate=February 28, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Liliʻuokalani v. the United States'' ===
In 1909, Liliʻuokalani brought an unsuccessful lawsuit against the United States under the Fifth Amendment seeking the return of the Hawaiian Crown Lands.{{sfn|Parker|2007|page=205}} The US courts invoked an 1864 Kingdom Supreme Court decision over a case involving the Dowager Queen Emma and Kamehameha V, using it against her.

Although Liliʻuokalani was never successful in more than a decade of legal pursuits for recompense from the United States government for seized land, in 1911 she was finally granted a lifetime pension of $1,250 a month by the Territory of Hawaii. Historian Sydney Lehua Iaukea noted that the grant never addressed the question of the legality of the seizure itself, and the figure was greatly reduced from what she had requested for recompense.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Iaukea|2012|pp=86, 181}}; {{cite news|title=Queen's Pension is Approved|newspaper=Evening Bulletin|location=Honolulu|date=March 30, 1911|at=p. 2, col. 3|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82016413/1911-03-30/ed-1/seq-2/|accessdate=October 15, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171119064942/http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82016413/1911-03-30/ed-1/seq-2/|archivedate=November 19, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious beliefs ==
Educated by American Protestant missionaries from a young age, Liliʻuokalani became a devout Christian and adherent to the principles of Christianity. These missionaries were largely of [[Congregationalist]] and [[Presbyterian]] extractions, subscribing to [[Calvinist]] theology, and Liliʻuokalani considered herself a "regular attendant on the Presbyterian worship".{{sfnm|1a1=Allen|1y=1982|1pp=69|2a1=Merry|2y=2000|2p=63|3a1=Liliuokalani|3y=1898|3p=269}} She was the first member of the royal family to consistently and regularly attend service at Kawaiahaʻo Church since King Kamehameha IV converted to [[Anglicanism]]. On Sundays, she played the organ and led the choir at Kawaiahaʻo. She also regularly attended service at [[Kaumakapili Church]] and held a special interest in the [[Liliuokalani Protestant Church|Liliʻuokalani Protestant Church]], to which she donated the Queen Liliʻuokalani Clock in 1892.{{sfnm|1a1=Kuykendall|1y=1967|1p=479|2a1=Allen|2y=1982|2pp=76–77}}

Historian Helena G. Allen noted that Liliʻuokalani and Kalākaua "believed all religions had their 'rights' and were entitled to equal treatment and opportunities". Throughout her life, Liliʻuokalani showed a broad interest in the different Christian faiths including [[Catholicism]], [[Mormonism]], [[Episcopalianism]] and other [[Protestant]] denominations.{{sfn|Allen|1982|page=241}} In 1896, she became a regular member of the Hawaiian Congregation at [[Cathedral Church of Saint Andrew (Honolulu)|St. Andrew's Cathedral]] associated with the Reformed Catholic (Anglican/Episcopal) Church of Hawaii, which King Kamehameha IV and Queen Emma had founded.{{sfn|Kuykendall|1967|page=479}} During the overthrow and her imprisonment, Bishop [[Alfred Willis]] of St. Andrew's Cathedral had openly supported the Queen while Reverend [[Henry Hodges Parker]] of Kawaiahaʻo had supported her opponents.{{sfnm|1a1=Kuykendall|1y=1967|1p=479|2a1=Garrett|2y=1992|2p=238}} Bishop Willis visited and wrote to her during her imprisonment and sent her a copy of the [[Book of Common Prayer]].{{sfn|Allen|1982|page=346}} Shortly after her release on parole, the former queen was baptized and confirmed by Bishop Willis on May 18, 1896, in a private ceremony in the presence of the sisters of St. Andrew's Priory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Join St. Andrew's – Ex-queen Liliuokalani Confirmed by Bishop Willis|newspaper=Hawaiian Gazette|location=Honolulu|publisher=|date=May 19, 1896|volume=XXXI|issue=40|at=p. 4, col. 6|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83025121/1896-05-19/ed-1/seq-4/|accessdate=October 15, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171001035930/http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83025121/1896-05-19/ed-1/seq-4/|archivedate=October 1, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her memoir, Liliʻuokalani stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;That first night of my imprisonment was the longest night I have ever passed in my life; it seemed as though the dawn of day would never come. I found in my bag a small Book of Common Prayer according to the ritual of the Episcopal Church. It was a great comfort to me, and before retiring to rest Mrs. Clark and I spent a few minutes in the devotions appropriate to the evening. Here, perhaps, I may say, that although I had been a regular attendant on the Presbyterian worship since my childhood, a constant contributor to all the missionary societies, and had helped to build their churches and ornament the walls, giving my time and my musical ability freely to make their meetings attractive to my people, yet none of these pious church members or clergymen remembered me in my prison. To this (Christian ?) conduct I contrast that of the Anglican bishop, Rt. Rev. Alfred Willis, who visited me from time to time in my house, and in whose church I have since been confirmed as a communicant. But he was not allowed to see me at the palace.{{sfn|Liliuokalani|1898|page=269}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

She traveled to Utah in 1901 for a visit with [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|Mormon president]] [[Joseph F. Smith]], a former missionary to the Hawaiian Island.

The Queen was also remembered for her support of [[Buddhist]] and [[Shinto]] priests in Hawaii and became one of the first Native Hawaiians to attend a [[Buddha's Birthday#Japan|Buddha's Birthday]] celebration of May 19, 1901, at the [[Honpa Hongwanji Mission of Hawaii|Honwangji mission]]. Her attendance in the celebration helped Buddhism and Shintoism gain acceptance into Hawaiian society and prevented the possible banning of the two religions by the Territorial government. Her presence was also widely reported in Chinese and Japanese newspapers throughout the world, and earned her the respect of many Japanese people both in Hawaii and in Japan itself.{{sfn|Koda|2006|page=237}}

{{Main|List of compositions and works by Liliuokalani}}

Liliʻuokalani was an accomplished author and songwriter. Her book ''Hawaiʻi's Story by Hawaiʻi's Queen'' gave her view of the history of her country and her overthrow. She is said to have played guitar, piano, [[organ (music)|organ]], [[ukulele|ʻukulele]] and [[zither]], and also sang alto, performing Hawaiian and English sacred and secular music.&lt;ref name="HawaiiMagazine2004"&gt;{{cite book|title=Hawaii Magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eW7xAAAAMAAJ|year=2004|publisher=Fancy Publications|location=Irvine, CA|oclc=27971891|pages=56, 58|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180113013956/https://books.google.com/books?id=eW7xAAAAMAAJ|archivedate=January 13, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Garraty|Carnes|American Council of Learned Societies|1999|pages=664–665}} In her memoirs she wrote:

{{quote |To compose was as natural to me as to breathe; and this gift of nature, never having been suffered to fall into disuse, remains a source of the greatest consolation to this day.[…] Hours of which it is not yet in place to speak, which I might have found long and lonely, passed quickly and cheerfully by, occupied and soothed by the expression of my thoughts in music.{{sfn|Liliuokalani|1898|page=31}}}}

Liliʻuokalani helped preserve key elements of Hawaiʻi's traditional poetics while mixing in Western harmonies brought by the missionaries. A compilation of her works, titled ''The Queen's Songbook'', was published in 1999 by the Queen Liliʻuokalani Trust.&lt;ref name="HawaiiMagazine2004" /&gt;{{sfn|Silva|2004|page=201}} Liliʻuokalani used her musical compositions as a way to express her feelings for her people, her country, and what was happening in the political realm in Hawaiʻi.&lt;ref name="DucatPBS"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ducat|first=Vivian|title=Hawaii's Last Queen|work=American Experience|publisher=PBS|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/hawaii/program.html|accessdate=October 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828041232/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/hawaii/program.html|archivedate=August 28, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example of the way her music reflected her political views is her translation of the [[Kumulipo]], the Hawaiian creation chant. While under house arrest, Liliʻuokalani feared she would never leave the palace alive, so she translated the Kumulipo in hopes that the history and culture of her people would never be lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Her History|publisher=Queen Liliʻuokalani Trust|url=http://onipaa.org/pages/her-history/|accessdate=October 12, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225233200/http://onipaa.org/pages/her-history|archivedate=December 25, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient chants record her family's genealogy back to the origin story of Hawaiʻi.{{sfn|Beckwith|1972|page=xiv}}

After Liliʻuokalani was imprisoned in the ʻIolani Palace, she was denied literature and newspapers, essentially cutting her off from her people, but she continued to compose music with paper and pencil while she was in confinement.{{sfn|Liliuokalani|1898|pages=289–90}}
Another of her compositions was "Aloha ʻOe", a song she had written previously and transcribed during her confinement. In her writings, she says, "At first I had no instrument, and had to transcribe the notes by voice alone; but I found, notwithstanding disadvantages, great consolation in composing, and transcribed a number of songs. Three found their way from my prison to the city of Chicago, where they were printed, among them the 'Aloha ʻOe' or 'Farewell to Thee', which became a very popular song."{{sfn|Liliuokalani|1898|pages=289–90}} Originally written as a lover's good-bye, the song came to be regarded as a symbol of, and lament for, the loss of her country. Today, it is one of the most recognizable Hawaiian songs.&lt;ref name="DucatPBS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dekneef2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BolanteKeany2007" /&gt;

Captain Julius A.

A '''literary festival''', also known as a '''book festival''' or '''writers' festival''', is a regular gathering of [[writer]]s and readers, typically on an annual basis in a particular city. A literary festival usually features a variety of presentations and readings by authors, as well as other events, delivered over a period of several days, with the primary objectives of promoting the authors' books and fostering a love of literature and writing.

[[List of writers' conferences|Writers' conferences]] are sometimes designed to provide an intellectual and academic focus for groups of writers without the involvement of the general public.

There are many literary festivals held around the world. A non-exhaustive list is set out below, including dates when a festival is usually held (where available).

'''London independence''', sometimes shortened to '''Londependence''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/live/eu-referendum/londependence/|title=‘Londependence’ May Be a Dream, but More Autonomy for the City Is Not|date= 28 June 2016 |publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to a belief favouring full-fledged independence for [[Greater London|London]] as a [[city-state]] separate from the [[United Kingdom]].
==Movement==
London's status within the United Kingdom has been debated for several years, with some calls for increased autonomy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2016/01/30/the-uk-needs-a-devolved-government-for-london/|title=The UK needs a devolved government for London|date=30 January 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theconversation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/london-after-brexit-independence-a-non-starter-but-special-status-could-protect-global-position-61609|title=London after Brexit: independence a non-starter but special status could protect global position|first=Richard G|last=Smith|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters have frequently cited Greater London's population of over 8 million people, its economic size, its global role, its diverse population and its unique challenges compared to the rest of [[England]] as reasons for greater autonomy. The idea of London becoming a city-state was discussed from the 1990s, and resurfaced during the [[Scottish independence referendum, 2014|Scottish independence referendum of 2014]].&lt;ref name="theconversation" /&gt;

The movement for either increased autonomy or full sovereignty received a boost following the [[UK EU referendum]] in 2016, during which the UK as a whole voted to leave the European Union (at 52% leave), although the majority of London voted for the UK to remain in the EU (60% remain). This led to 180,000 Londoners petitioning [[Sadiq Khan]], [[Mayor of London]] online to seek London's independence from the UK so it could remain part of the EU. Supporters cite London's status as a "[[world city]]" and its demographic and economic differences from the rest of the United Kingdom, and argue that it should become a city-state based on the model of [[Singapore]], while remaining an EU member state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/story/1716977/second-scotland-referendum-highly-likely|title=Second Scotland Referendum 'Highly Likely'}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.london24.com/news/politics/londoners_call_for_independence_from_uk_1_4591200|title=Londoners call for independence from UK|first=Zoah|last=Hedges-Stocks|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160625122929/http://www.london24.com/news/politics/londoners_call_for_independence_from_uk_1_4591200|archivedate=25 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/brexit-latest-london-independence-time-to-leave-uk-eu-referendum-sadiq-khan-boris-johnson-a7100601.html|title=It's time for London to leave the UK|date=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/wouldnt-you-prefer-to-be-president-sadiq-thousands-back-campaign-for-sadiq-khan-to-declare-londons-a3280141.html|title=Thousands call on Sadiq Khan to declare London's independence|date=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/londependence-petition-calls-for-london-to-join-the-eu-on-its-own-a7101006.html|title='Londependence' petition calls for London to join the EU on its own|date=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/06/24/londoners-want-their-own-independence-after-brexit-result/|title=Londoners want their own independence after Brexit result}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2016/06/24/70000-sign-petition-for-london-to-become-independent-and-rejoin-the-eu-5965541/|title=70,000 sign petition for London to become independent and rejoin the EU|first=Nicole Morley for|last=Metro.co.uk|date=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Spencer Livermore]] of the Labour Party said that London's independence "should be a goal", arguing that a London city-state would have twice the GDP of Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/eu-referendum-london-independence_uk_576d4c57e4b0d257114993a2|title=London Independence Goes Beyond A Twitter Joke With Politicians Seriously Discussing It|date=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Tony Travers]] argued that Khan would be "well within his rights to tell the government London didn't vote for Brexit and that City Hall now viewed the government as dysfunctional." Analyst Kevin Doran said that London becoming an independent state is not just possible, but inevitable "within 20 to 30 years' time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theweek.co.uk/73896/london-independence-could-the-capital-break-away-from-the-uk|title=London independence: Could the capital break away from the UK?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the EU referendum vote, Peter John, the Labour Party leader of the [[London Borough of Southwark]] stated it would be a "legitimate question" for London to consider its future in the United Kingdom and the European Union. Southwark had voted 72% in favour of remaining in the EU. John also said "London would be the 15th largest EU state, bigger than Austria, Denmark and Ireland and our values are in line with Europe – outward looking, confident of our place in the world, enriched by our diversity and stronger working together with our friends and neighbours than we are alone."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/southwark-council-leader-backs-calls-london-consider-independence-uk-eu-referendum-result/|title=Southwark Council Leader backs calls for London to consider independence from UK after EU Referendum result|author=Alex Yeates|date=24 June 2016 | newspaper=[[Southwark News]] |accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public opinion==
Two opinion polls have been carried out by the polling company [[YouGov]] on Londoners' preferred constitutional status.

A different survey of 2,001 people carried out by the firm Censuswide in September 2014 found that 19.9% of Londoners wanted the city to become independent, with support for this being highest among people aged 25–34.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/one-in-five-londoners-want-capital-to-split-from-rest-of-uk-and-become-independent-9722652.html |title='One in five Londoners want the capital to become independent' |last=Moore-Bridger |first=Benedict |date=10 September 2014 |publisher=Evening Standard |access-date=31 March 2017 |quote=19.9 per cent of the 2,001 people surveyed agree[d] it [London] would be better off as its own country.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The idea of London independence has been criticised as unrealistic. Brian Groom of the ''[[Financial Times]]'' wrote that "it is ludicrous to think of any nation gladly waving goodbye to its capital", calling the idea of secession a "fantasy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ft.com/content/a97a4f1c-0a8b-11e3-aeab-00144feabdc0 |title=Could London ever be a city-state? |last=Groom |first=Brian |date=26 August 2013 |publisher=Financial Times |access-date=31 March 2017 |quote=This is, of course, fantasy. Unlike Scotland, London has no separatist movement.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. James Ker-Lindsay, a senior research fellow at the [[London School of Economics]] who specialises in secession movements, stated with regard to a referendum on London Independence that it "seems difficult to see how any government would ever agree to such a vote." He also said if London broke away without permission it would not be able to join the UN.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vice.com/en_au/article/we-asked-an-expert-if-london-could-secede-from-the-uk|&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Met Gala''', formally called the '''Costume Institute Gala''' and also known as the '''Met Ball''', is an annual fundraising [[festival|gala]] for the benefit of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]'s [[Costume Institute]] in [[New York City]]. It marks the grand opening of the Costume Institute's annual fashion exhibit.&lt;ref name="metmuseum.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-met/curatorial-departments/the-costume-institute|title=The Costume Institute {{!}} The Metropolitan Museum of Art|website=www.metmuseum.org|access-date=May 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each year's event celebrates the theme of that year's Costume Institute exhibition, and the exhibition sets the tone for the formal dress of the night, since guests are expected to choose their fashion to match the theme of the exhibit.

== History ==
The Met Gala was established in 1948 by legendary fashion publicist [[Eleanor Lambert]] as a way to raise money for the newly-founded Costume Institute and mark the opening of its annual exhibit. The first gala was a midnight dinner and tickets were fifty dollars each.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/blogs/now-at-the-met/2018/met-gala-costume-institute-benefit-brief-history|title=https://www.metmuseum.org/blogs/now-at-the-met/2018/met-gala-costume-institute-benefit-brief-history|website=www.metmuseum.org|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Lambert herself dubbed it the "Party of the Year," for the first few decades of its existence the gala was simply one of many annual benefits held for New York charitable institutions. Accordingly, the attendees of the early galas were almost entirely members of New York high society or the fashion industry. From 1948 to 1971, the event was held at venues including the [[Waldorf Astoria New York|Waldorf-Astoria]], [[Central Park]], and [[Rainbow Room]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/the-met-galas-history-and-decor-throughout-the-years/all|title=A Look Back At The Met Gala's History And Decor Throughout The Years {{!}} Architectural Digest|work=Architectural Digest|access-date=2018-12-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When former Vogue editor-in-chief [[Diana Vreeland|Diane Vreeland]] became special consultant to the Costume Institute in 1972, the Gala began to evolve into a more glamorous affair, although one that was still aimed at the societal set.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.townandcountrymag.com/the-scene/parties/a9551568/met-gala-history/|title=The Met Ball Was So Much Better Before All the Celebrities Showed Up|date=2018-05-03|work=Town &amp; Country|access-date=2018-12-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event started to become more celebrity-oriented with attendees like [[Andy Warhol]], [[Diana Ross]], and [[Cher]] intermixing with the city's elite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/the-met-galas-history-and-decor-throughout-the-years/all|title=A Look Back At The Met Gala's History And Decor Throughout The Years {{!}} Architectural Digest|work=Architectural Digest|access-date=2018-12-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during the Vreeland years that the Gala was first held at the Met and that Gala themes were introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/the-met-galas-history-and-decor-throughout-the-years/all|title=A Look Back At The Met Gala's History And Decor Throughout The Years {{!}} Architectural Digest|work=Architectural Digest|access-date=2018-12-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time Vreeland died in 1989, the Met Gala was well known as a luxurious, blockbuster event and was considered "the jewel in New York City's social crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.townandcountrymag.com/the-scene/parties/a9551568/met-gala-history/|title=The Met Ball Was So Much Better Before All the Celebrities Showed Up|date=2018-05-03|work=Town &amp; Country|access-date=2018-12-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/the-met-galas-history-and-decor-throughout-the-years/all|title=A Look Back At The Met Gala's History And Decor Throughout The Years {{!}} Architectural Digest|work=Architectural Digest|access-date=2018-12-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
When the Met Gala announced a white tie dress code in 2014, a number of media outlets pointed out the difficulty and expense of obtaining traditional white tie, even for the celebrity guests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author-last=Trebay|author-first=Guy|title=At the Met Gala, a Strict Dress Code|work=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/24/fashion/at-the-met-gala-a-strict-dress-code.html?_r=2|date=23 April 2014|accessdate=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=The Met Ball Is White Tie This Year—But What Does That Even Mean?|author-last=Rothman|author-first=Lily|url=http://time.com/83217/white-tie-costume-institute-gala/|work=Time|date=5 May 2014|accessdate=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the theme "China: Through the Looking Glass" was previously named "Chinese Whispers: Tales of the East in Art, Film and Fashion".&lt;ref name="au.complex.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://au.complex.com/style/2015/05/met-gala-2015-asian-appropriation-china-through-the-looking-glass|title=The China-Themed Met Gala Wasn't Totally Offensive, But Still Problematic|website=Complex AU|access-date=May 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year's theme was met with critics saying it was "A reminder of the subtle institutionalised racism that's been compounded by centuries of Asian isolationism across the board, and enduring Western stereotypes exacerbated by ignorance and the meme-able nature of social media."&lt;ref name="au.complex.com"/&gt;

In 2016, [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], whilst channeling the theme "Manus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology", provided one of the most controversial outfits in the gala's history. She appeared in an ensemble designed by [[Givenchy]] creative director [[Riccardo Tisci]] exposing both her breasts and buttocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-style/red-carpet/madonnas-peekaboob-met-gala-moment/news-story/8210214260ffc6e6080d3c4b91398ad0|title=Madonna’s peek-a-boob Met Gala moment|website=NewsComAu|access-date=May 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Madonna hit back on her official social media channels by stating "We have fought and continue to fight for civil rights and gay rights around the world. When it comes to women’s rights we are still in the dark ages. My dress at the Met Ball was a political statement as well as a fashion statement".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-style/red-carpet/madonna-slams-ageist-and-sexist-met-gala-outfit-critics/news-story/62dae2042c15284ae704a2439b9ae158|title=Madonna slams ‘ageist and sexist’ Met Gala outfit critics|website=NewsComAu|access-date=May 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2018 Gala had a [[Roman Catholic]] theme, and included [[Rihanna]] wearing a papal [[mitre]]. Critics on social media called it "blasphemous" and "sacrilegious cosplay", even though the Catholic Church lent more than forty papal vestments from the Vatican and Cardinal [[Timothy M. Dolan]] attended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Quinn|first1=Dave|title=The Met Gala's 'Catholic Imagination' Theme Called 'Blasphemous' and 'Sacrilegious' by Critics|url=http://people.com/style/met-gala-2018-critics-call-catholic-theme-blasphemous/|accessdate=May 9, 2018|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=May 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Syme|first1=Rachel|title=Pope Rihanna and Other Revelations from the Catholic-Themed 2018 Met Gala|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/on-and-off-the-avenue/pope-rihanna-and-other-revelations-from-the-catholic-themed-2018-met-gala|accessdate=May 9, 2018|work=[[The New Yorker]]|date=May 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kyle Smith]] argued that the Catholic Church was in fact "abetting the mockery of its symbols".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Kyle|author-link=Kyle Smith|title=Red-Carpet Catholicism Is a Loss for the Church|url=https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/05/met-gala-red-carpet-mocks-catholic-symbols|accessdate=May 9, 2018|work=[[National Review]]|date=May 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Catholic apologist [[Michael Voris]] has criticized Cardinal Dolan for attending the 2018 Met Gala.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.churchmilitant.com/video/episode/vortex-dolan-disgrace-again|title=Dolan Disgrace, Again|website=www.churchmilitant.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1979">The term '''Military Inter-Allied Commission of Control'''  was used in [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|a series of peace treaties]] concluded after the [[First World War]] (1914&amp;ndash;1918) between different countries. Each of these treaties was concluded between the Principal Allied and Associated Powers (consisting of the [[United States of America]], the [[British Empire]], [[France]], [[Italy]] and [[Japan]]) on the one hand, and one of the [[Central Powers]] like [[Germany]], [[Turkey]] or [[Bulgaria]].

One of the terms of such treaties required conversion of all of the Central Powers' military and armaments related production and related facilities into purely commercial use. The decision and the modus operandi to ensure this rested with a ''Military Inter-Allied Commission of Control''. The ''Military Inter-Allied Commission of Control'' was also entrusted with a number of other responsibilities, including:
#to fix the number of customs officials, local urban and rural police, forest guards and other like officials under the control of the Government of the central power concerned.
#to receive from the central power concerned information relating to the location of the stocks and depots of munitions, the armament of the fortified works, fortresses and forts, the situation of the works or factories for the production of arms, munitions and war material and their operations.

The commission of control ceased to function in Germany on 28 February 1927, in Hungary on 31 March and in Bulgaria on 1 June.&lt;ref&gt;"News in Brief", ''Advocate of Peace through Justice'', Vol. 89, No. 7 (July, 1927), p. 442&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Murder''' is the unlawful killing of another [[human]]&lt;!-- NOTE: As the vast majority of sources show, the term "murder" generally pertains to humans, not to all forms of life.

[[Involuntary manslaughter|''Involuntary'' manslaughter]], where it is recognized, is a killing that lacks all but the most attenuated [[Mens rea|guilty intent]], recklessness.

In most countries, a person convicted of murder generally faces a long-term prison sentence, possibly a [[life imprisonment|life sentence]]; and in a few, the [[death penalty]] may be imposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/28/us-china-death-penalty-amnesty |location=London |work=The Guardian |first=Mark |last=Tran |title=China and US among top punishers but death penalty in decline |date=2011-03-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217065243/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/28/us-china-death-penalty-amnesty |archivedate=2017-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The modern English word "murder" descends from the [[Proto-Indo-European]] "mrtró" which meant "to die".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bynon|first1=Theodora|title=Historical Linguistics|date=1977|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521291880|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A-dB-7CYMwcC|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Middle English]] ''mordre'' is a noun from [[Anglo-Saxon]] ''morðor'' and [[Old French]] ''murdre''. Middle English ''mordre'' is a verb from Anglo-Saxon ''myrdrian'' and the Middle English noun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nielson|first1=William A.|last2=Patch|first2=Howard R.|title=Selections from Chaucer|date=1921|publisher=Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co.|location=New York|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JTtLAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
&lt;!-- This section is too jurisdiction-specific, and need some analysis of the Common Law definition and maybe just a statement that it has been more or less universally applied, although with some modification, in common-law jurisdictions --&gt;
The eighteenth-century English jurist [[William Blackstone]] (citing [[Edward Coke]]), in his ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'' set out the [[common law]] definition of murder, which by this definition occurs
{{quote|when a person, of sound memory and discretion, unlawfully kills any reasonable creature in being and under the king's peace, with malice aforethought, either express or implied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blackstone|first1=William|title=Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England|date=1765|publisher=Avalon Project, Yale Law School|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/blackstone_bk4ch14.asp|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810204659/http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/blackstone_bk4ch14.asp|archivedate=2011-08-10|df=}} Book the Fourth - Chapter the Fourteenth : Of Homicide.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The elements of common law murder are:

# Unlawful
# killing
# through criminal act or omission
# of a human
# by another human
# with malice aforethought.&lt;ref name="Joshua Dressler 2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joshua Dressler |title=Understanding Criminal Law|edition=3rd |publisher=Lexis |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-8205-5027-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Unlawful''' – This distinguishes murder from killings that are done within the boundaries of law, such as capital punishment, justified [[self-defence]], or the killing of enemy [[combatant]]s by lawful combatants as well as causing [[collateral damage]] to [[non-combatant]]s during a war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dennis J.

'''Сriminal act or omission''' – Killing can be committed by an act or an [[Omission (law)|omission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ashford|first1=Elizabeth|title=Killing &amp; Letting Die|url=https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~ea10/topic3b.htm|website=Philosophy 4826, Life and Death|publisher=University of St. Andrews|accessdate=10 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202001338/http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~ea10/topic3b.htm|archivedate=2 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''of a human''' – This element presents the issue of when life begins. At common law, a [[fetus]] was not a human being.&lt;ref&gt;''R v Tait'' [1990] 1 QB 290.&lt;/ref&gt; Life began when the fetus passed through the [[vagina]] and took its first breath.&lt;ref name="Joshua Dressler 2001" /&gt;

'''by another human''' – In early common law, [[suicide]] was considered murder.&lt;ref name="Joshua Dressler 2001" /&gt; The requirement that the person killed be someone other than the perpetrator excluded suicide from the definition of murder.

'''with malice aforethought''' – Originally ''[[malice aforethought]]'' carried its everyday meaning – a deliberate and premeditated (prior intent) killing of another motivated by ill will. Murder necessarily required that an appreciable time pass between the formation and execution of the intent to kill. The courts broadened the scope of murder by eliminating the requirement of actual premeditation and deliberation as well as true malice. All that was required for malice aforethought to exist is that the perpetrator act with one of the four states of mind that constitutes "malice".

The four states of mind recognized as constituting "malice" are:&lt;ref&gt;Wise, Edward. "Criminal Law" in ''Introduction to the Law of the United States'' (Clark and Ansay, eds.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=lpybMKdDoVIC&amp;pg=PA154 154] (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Ordered list|list-style-type=lower-roman
|[[Intention (criminal law)|Intent to kill]],
|Intent to inflict [[grievous bodily harm]] short of death,
|Reckless indifference to an unjustifiably high risk to human life (sometimes described as an "abandoned and malignant heart"), or
|Intent to commit a dangerous [[felony]] (the "[[felony murder]]" doctrine).
}}

Under state of mind (i), intent to kill, the ''deadly weapon rule'' applies. Thus, if the defendant intentionally uses a [[deadly weapon]] or instrument against the victim, such use authorizes a permissive inference of intent to kill. In other words, "[[transferred intent|intent follows the bullet]]". Examples of deadly weapons and instruments include but are not limited to guns, knives, deadly toxins or chemicals or gases and even vehicles when intentionally used to harm one or more victims.

Under state of mind (iii), an "abandoned and malignant heart", the killing must result from the defendant's conduct involving a reckless indifference to human life and a conscious disregard of an unreasonable risk of death or serious bodily injury. In Australian jurisdictions, the unreasonable risk must amount to a foreseen probability of death (or grievous bodily harm in most states), as opposed to possibility.&lt;ref name="R v Crabbe"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|22|1985|litigants=R v [[Douglas Crabbe|Crabbe]] |parallelcite=(1985) 156 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 464 |courtname=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]] |date=26 March 1985}}; but the common law has been modified in NSW: {{cite AustLII|HCA|27|1991|litigants=Royall v R |parallelcite=(1991) 172 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 378 |courtname=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]] |date=25 June 1991}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under state of mind (iv), the felony-murder doctrine, the felony committed must be an inherently dangerous felony, such as burglary, arson, rape, robbery or kidnapping. Importantly, the underlying felony ''cannot'' be a [[lesser included offense]] such as assault, otherwise all criminal homicides would be murder as all are felonies.

As with most legal terms, the precise definition of murder varies between jurisdictions and is usually codified in some form of legislation. Even when the legal distinction between murder and manslaughter is clear, it is not unknown for a jury to find a murder defendant guilty of the lesser offence. The jury might sympathise with the defendant (e.g. in a [[crime of passion]], or in the case of a bullied victim who kills their tormentor), and the jury may wish to protect the defendant from a sentence of life imprisonment or execution.

===Degrees of murder===
{{Redirect|Murder in the second degree|the 2016 album|Murder in the Second Degree}}
Many jurisdictions divide murder by degrees. The distinction between first- and second-degree murder exists, for example, in [[Murder (Canadian law)|Canadian murder law]] and [[Murder (United States law)#Degrees|U.S. murder law]].

The most common division is between first- and second-degree murder. Generally, second-degree murder is common law murder, and first-degree is an aggravated form. The aggravating factors of first-degree murder depend on the jurisdiction, but may include a specific intent to kill, premeditation, or deliberation. In some, murder committed by acts such as [[strangulation]], [[poisoning]], or [[lying in wait]] are also treated as first-degree murder.&lt;ref&gt;Murder in the First and Second Degree (14–17)
A murder which shall be perpetrated by ... poison, lying in wait, imprisonment, starving, torture, or by any other kind of willful, deliberate and premeditated killing or which shall be committed in the perpetration or attempted perpetration of any arson, rape or sex offense, robbery, kidnapping, burglary, or other felony committed or attempted with the use of a deadly weapon, shall be ... murder in the first degree ... and shall be punished by death or life imprisonment ... except that any person ... under 17 years of age at the time of the murder shall be punished with imprisonment ... for life.
All other kinds of murder, including that which shall be proximately caused by the unlawful distribution of opium or any synthetic or natural salt, compound, derivative, or the preparation of opium ... cause the death of the user, shall be ... murder in the second degree and ... shall be punished as a Class C felony
&lt;/ref&gt; A few states in the U.S. further distinguish [[third-degree murder]], but they differ significantly in which kinds of murders they classify as second-degree versus third-degree. For example, Minnesota defines third-degree murder as [[depraved-heart murder]], whereas Florida defines third-degree murder as [[felony murder]] (except when the underlying felony is specifically listed in the definition of first-degree murder).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1427&amp;context=flr|first=Frank|last=Brenner|title=The Impulsive Murder and the Degree Device|journal=Fordham Law Review|volume=22|issue=3|year=1953|access-date=2018-03-13|ref=harv|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180313214239/https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1427&amp;context=flr|archivedate=2018-03-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://statelaws.findlaw.com/minnesota-law/minnesota-second-degree-murder.html|title=Minnesota Second-Degree Murder|website=findlaw.com|access-date=2018-03-13|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180314043759/http://statelaws.findlaw.com/minnesota-law/minnesota-second-degree-murder.html|archivedate=2018-03-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some jurisdictions also distinguish premeditated murder. This is the [[crime]] of wrongfully and intentionally causing the death of another [[human]] being (also known as murder) after rationally considering the timing or method of doing so, in order to either increase the likelihood of success, or to evade detection or apprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Premeditation|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/premeditation|website=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=10 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910082842/https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/premeditation|archivedate=10 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[U.S. state|State]] laws in the [[United States]] vary as to definitions of "premeditation". In some states, premeditation may be construed as taking place mere seconds before the murder. Premeditated murder is one of the most serious forms of [[homicide]], and is punished more severely than [[manslaughter]] or other types of murder, often with a [[life imprisonment|life sentence]] without the possibility of [[parole]], or in some countries, the [[capital punishment|death penalty]]. In the U.S, [[United States federal law|federal law]] ({{USCSub|18|1111|a}}) criminalizes premeditated murder, felony murder and second-degree murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Title 18 USC, Sec. 1111, Murder|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1111|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=10 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910040431/https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1111|archivedate=10 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] classifies [[Murder (Canadian law)|murder]] as either 1st- or 2nd-degree. The former type of murder is often called premeditated murder, although premeditation is not the only way murder can be classified as first-degree.

===Common law===
According to Blackstone, English [[common law]] identified murder as a ''public wrong''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/blackstone/bk4ch14.htm |title=Blackstone, Book 4, Chapter 14 |publisher=Yale.edu |accessdate=2010-06-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203082805/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/blackstone/bk4ch14.htm |archivedate=2010-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to common law, murder is considered to be ''[[malum in se]]'', that is an act which is evil within itself. An act such as murder is wrong or evil by its very nature. And it is the very nature of the act which does not require any specific detailing or definition in the law to consider murder a crime.&lt;ref&gt;A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage By Bryan A. Garner, p. 545.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some jurisdictions still take a [[common law]] view of murder. In such jurisdictions, what is considered to be murder is defined by [[precedent]] case law or previous decisions of the courts of law. However, although the common law is by nature flexible and adaptable, in the interests both of certainty and of securing convictions, most common law jurisdictions have [[Codification (law)|codified]] their criminal law and now have statutory definitions of murder.

===Exclusions===

====General====
Although laws vary by country, there are circumstances of exclusion that are common in many legal systems.
*Killing of enemy combatants who have not surrendered by lawful combatants, in accordance with lawful orders in war, is also generally not considered murder; although illicit killings within a war may constitute murder or homicidal [[war crime]]s. (see the [[Laws of war]] article)
*[[Self-defence (theory)|Self-defence]]: acting in self-defence or in defence of another person is generally accepted as legal justification for killing a person in situations that would otherwise have been murder. However, a self-defence killing might be considered manslaughter if the killer established control of the situation before the killing took place. In the case of self-defence it is called a "justifiable homicide".&lt;ref name="crim liability"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000278633&amp;dateTexte=|title=Article 122-5|accessdate=2007-11-01|publisher=Legifrance|author=The French Parliament|website=French Criminal Law|language=fr|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408162844/http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000278633&amp;dateTexte=|archivedate=2008-04-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Unlawful killings without malice or intent are considered [[manslaughter]].
*In many common law countries, [[provocation (legal)|provocation]] is a partial defence to a charge of murder which acts by converting what would otherwise have been murder into manslaughter (this is voluntary manslaughter, which is more severe than involuntary manslaughter).
*Accidental killings are considered [[homicide]]s. Depending on the circumstances, these may or may not be considered criminal offenses; they are often considered [[manslaughter]].
*[[Suicide]] does not constitute murder in most societies. Assisting a suicide, however, may be considered murder in some circumstances.

====Specific to certain countries====
*[[Capital punishment]]: some countries practice the death penalty. Capital punishment may be ordered by a legitimate court of law as the result of a conviction in a [[criminal trial]] with [[due process]] for a serious crime. The 47 Member States of the [[Council of Europe]] are prohibited from using the death penalty.
*[[Euthanasia]], doctor-assisted suicide: the administration of lethal drugs by a doctor to a [[terminally ill]] patient, if the intention is solely to alleviate pain, in many jurisdictions it is seen as a special case (see the doctrine of [[double effect]] and the case of [[John Bodkin Adams|Dr John Bodkin Adams]]).&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mDvBJ5J4tusC&amp;pg=PA177&amp;lpg=PA177&amp;dq=%22Thomas+Lodwig%22+dr |title=Margaret Otlowski, '&amp;#39;Voluntary Euthanasia and the Common Law'&amp;#39;, Oxford University Press, 1997, pp. 175–177 |accessdate=2010-06-25|isbn=978-0-19-825996-1|year=1997|last1=Otlowski |first1=Margaret }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Space jurisdiction]] is similar to that of [[international waters]]. Therefore, a murder committed in outer space is subject to jurisdiction in the country that owns the space craft in which the killing transpired. In the event the murder occurred on an extraterrestrial planet (e.g. The [[Moon]]), no country can own land of any other planet&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-03-31|title=Outer Space Treaty|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Outer_Space_Treaty&amp;oldid=773109867|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; so the killer is bound by the laws of the country in which they originate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-04-26|title=Extraterritorial jurisdiction|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Extraterritorial_jurisdiction&amp;oldid=777327355|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also applies to the [[International Space Station|ISS]] per agreement signed by all countries that have worked on the station so all astronauts are covered by [[Extraterritorial jurisdiction|extraterratorial jurisdiction.]]

===Victim===
[[File:Jakub Schikaneder - Murder in the House.JPG|thumb|''Murder in the House'', [[Jakub Schikaneder]].]]
All jurisdictions require that the victim be a natural person; that is, a [[human being]] who was still alive before being murdered. In other words, under the law one cannot murder a [[cadaver|corpse]], a corporation, a non-human animal, or any other non-human [[organism]] such as a plant or bacterium.

[[California]]'s murder statute, [[California Penal Code|Penal Code]] [[187 (murder)|Section 187]], was interpreted by the [[Supreme Court of California]] in 1994 as not requiring any proof of the viability of the fetus as a prerequisite to a murder conviction.&lt;ref name="davis"&gt;''People v. Davis'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/C4/7C4t797.htm 7 Cal. 4th 797, 30 Cal. Rptr. 2d 50, 872 P.2d 591] (1994).&lt;/ref&gt; This holding has two implications. The first is a defendant in California can be convicted of murder for killing a fetus which the mother herself could have terminated without committing a crime.&lt;ref name="davis" /&gt; The second, as stated by Justice [[Stanley Mosk]] in his dissent, is that because women carrying nonviable fetuses may not be visibly pregnant, it may be possible for a defendant to be convicted of intentionally murdering a person they did not know existed.&lt;ref name="davis" /&gt;

===Mitigating circumstances===
Some countries allow conditions that "affect the balance of the mind" to be regarded as [[mitigating factor|mitigating circumstances]]. This means that a person may be found guilty of "manslaughter" on the basis of "diminished responsibility" rather than being found guilty of murder, if it can be proved that the killer was suffering from a condition that affected their judgment at the time. [[clinical depression|Depression]], [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] and medication [[adverse effect (medicine)|side-effect]]s are examples of conditions that may be taken into account when assessing responsibility.

====Insanity====
{{main|Insanity defense|M'Naghten rules}}
[[Mental Disorder (Insanity) Defense|Mental disorder]] may apply to a wide range of disorders including [[psychosis]] caused by [[schizophrenia]] and [[dementia]], and excuse the person from the need to undergo the stress of a trial as to liability. Usually, [[antisocial personality disorder|sociopathy]] and other [[personality disorders]] are not legally considered insanity, because of the belief they are the result of [[free will]] in many societies. In some jurisdictions, following the pre-trial hearing to determine the extent of the disorder, the defence of "not guilty by reason of insanity" may be used to get a not guilty verdict.&lt;ref&gt;''M'Naughten's case'', [1843] All ER Rep 229.&lt;/ref&gt; This defence has two elements:

# That the [[defendant]] had a serious mental illness, disease, or defect.
# That the defendant's mental condition, at the time of the killing, rendered the perpetrator unable to determine right from wrong, or that what they were doing was wrong.
[[File:CCTV 1 of Aaron Alexis in building 197.jpg|thumb|[[Aaron Alexis]] holding a shotgun during his rampage.]]

Under [[New York (state)|New York]] law, for example:
{{quote|§ 40.15 Mental disease or defect. In any prosecution for an offense, it is an affirmative defence that when the defendant engaged in the proscribed conduct, he lacked criminal responsibility by reason of mental disease or defect. Such lack of criminal responsibility means that at the time of such conduct, as a result of mental disease or defect, he lacked substantial capacity to know or appreciate either: 1. The nature and consequences of such conduct; or 2. That such conduct was wrong.|[[N.Y. Penal Law]], § 40.15&lt;ref&gt;N.Y.

====Postpartum depression====
[[Postpartum depression]] (also known as post-natal depression) is recognized in some countries as a mitigating factor in cases of [[infanticide]]. According to Dr. Susan Friedman, "Two dozen nations have infanticide laws that decrease the penalty for mothers who kill their children of up to one year of age. The United States does not have such a law, but mentally ill mothers may plead not guilty by reason of insanity."&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, SH. "Commentary: Postpartum Psychosis, Infanticide, and Insanity Implications for Forensic Psychiatry", J Am Acad Psychiatry Law 40:3:326-332 (September 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[law of the Republic of Ireland]], infanticide was made a separate crime from murder in 1949, applicable for the mother of a baby under one year old where "the balance of her mind was disturbed by reason of her not having fully recovered from the effect of giving birth to the child or by reason of the effect of lactation consequent upon the birth of the child".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1949/act/16/section/1/enacted/en/html#sec1 |title=Infanticide Act, 1949, Section 1 |website=[[Irish Statute Book]] |accessdate=22 May 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601084439/http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1949/act/16/section/1/enacted/en/html#sec1 |archivedate=1 June 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since independence, death sentences for murder in such cases had always been [[commutation of sentence|commuted]];&lt;ref name="Rattigan2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rattigan|first=Clíona|year=2008|title='Done to death by father or relatives': Irish families and infanticide cases, 1922–1950|journal=The History of the Family|volume=13|issue=4|pages=370–383|issn=1081-602X|doi=10.1016/j.hisfam.2008.09.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; the new act was intended "to eliminate all the terrible ritual of the [[black cap]] and the solemn words of the judge pronouncing sentence of death in those cases ... where it is clear to the Court and to everybody, except perhaps the unfortunate accused, that the sentence will never be carried out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/DebatesWebPack.nsf/takes/seanad1949070700007 |title=Infanticide Bill, 1949—Second and Subsequent Stages |website=Seanad Éireann debates |pages=Vol.36 c.1472 |nopp=Y |date=7 July 1949 |accessdate=22 May 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701225250/http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/DebatesWebPack.nsf/takes/seanad1949070700007 |archivedate=1 July 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Russia, murder of a newborn child by the mother has been separate crime since 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[[Criminal Code of Russia]], art.106&lt;/ref&gt;

====Unintentional====
For a killing to be considered murder in nine out of fifty states in the US, there normally needs to be an element of intent. A defendant may argue that they took precautions not to kill, that the death could not have been anticipated, or was unavoidable. As a general rule, [[manslaughter]]&lt;ref name="manslaughter in France"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://195.83.177.9/code/liste.phtml?lang=uk&amp;c=33&amp;r=3691|title=Article 222-8|accessdate=2007-11-01|publisher=Legifrance|author=The French Parliament|website=French Criminal Law|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102221056/http://195.83.177.9/code/liste.phtml?lang=uk&amp;c=33&amp;r=3691|archivedate=2007-11-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; constitutes [[recklessness (law)|reckless]] killing, but manslaughter also includes criminally negligent (i.e. grossly negligent) homicide.&lt;ref name="invol offences"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://195.83.177.9/code/liste.phtml?lang=uk&amp;c=33&amp;r=3686|title=Section II – Involuntary Offences Against Life|accessdate=2007-11-01|publisher=Legifrance|author=The French Parliament|website=French Criminal Law|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102221040/http://195.83.177.9/code/liste.phtml?lang=uk&amp;c=33&amp;r=3686|archivedate=2007-11-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unintentional killing that results from an involuntary action generally cannot constitute murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Michaels|first1=Alan C.|title=Defining Unintended Murder|journal=Columbia Law Review|volume=85|issue=4|pages=786–811|jstor=1122334|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; After examining the evidence, a judge or jury (depending on the jurisdiction) would determine whether the killing was intentional or unintentional.

====Diminished capacity====
In those jurisdictions using the Uniform Penal Code, such as [[California]], [[diminished capacity]] may be a defence. For example, [[Dan White]] used this defence&lt;ref&gt;The so-called "[[Twinkie defense]]").&lt;/ref&gt; to obtain a manslaughter conviction, instead of murder, in the [[assassination]] of Mayor [[George Moscone]] and Supervisor [[Harvey Milk]]. Afterward, California amended its penal code to provide "As a matter of public policy there shall be no defense of diminished capacity, diminished responsibility, or irresistible impulse in a criminal action...."&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.justia.com/codes/california/2011/pen/part-1/25-29/28/ California Penal Code § 28(b)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180425183608/https://law.justia.com/codes/california/2011/pen/part-1/25-29/28/ |date=2018-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aggravating circumstances===
Murder with specified [[aggravation (legal concept)|aggravating circumstances]] is often punished more harshly. Depending on the jurisdiction, such circumstances may include:

*Premeditation
*Poisoning
*Murder of a child
*Murder of a police officer,&lt;ref name="Murder English law"&gt;See [[Murder (English law)]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NSW (of Australia) Law"&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|ca190082|Crimes Act 1900|19B}} Mandatory life sentences for murder of police officers.&lt;/ref&gt; judge, firefighter or witness to a crime&lt;ref&gt;See [[Murder (United States law)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Murder in English law|Murder]], under [[English criminal law]], always carries a mandatory [[Life imprisonment in England and Wales|life sentence]], but is not classified into degrees. Penalties for murder committed under aggravating circumstances are often higher, under English law, than the 15-year minimum non-parole period that otherwise serves as a starting point for a murder committed by an adult.

===Felony murder rule===
{{Main|Felony murder rule}}
A legal [[doctrine]] in some [[common law]] jurisdictions  broadens the crime of murder: when an offender kills in the commission of a dangerous crime, (regardless of intent), he/she is guilty of murder. The felony murder rule is often justified by its supporters as a means of deterring dangerous felonies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sidak|first1=J. Gregory|title=Two Economic Rationals for Felony Murder|journal=Cornell Law Review|date=2015|volume=101|page=51|url=http://cornelllawreview.org/files/2016/04/Sidakessayfinalread-2.pdf|accessdate=10 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161021050754/http://cornelllawreview.org/files/2016/04/Sidakessayfinalread-2.pdf|archivedate=21 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the case of [[Ryan Holle]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows it can be used very widely.

===Year-and-a-day rule===
{{Main|Year and a day rule}}
In some [[common law]] jurisdictions, a [[defendant]] accused of murder is not guilty if the victim survives for longer than [[year and a day rule|one year and one day]] after the attack.&lt;ref&gt;See ''State v. Picotte'', 2003 WI 42, 261 Wis. 2d 249 (2003)[http://law.justia.com/wisconsin/codes/2010/940/940.10.html](search for "year-and-a-day rule")&lt;/ref&gt; This reflects the likelihood that if the victim dies, other factors will have contributed to the cause of death, breaking the chain of [[causation (law)|causation]]; and also means that the responsible person does not have a charge of murder "hanging over their head indefinitely".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Criminal lawyers back review of time limit for homicide charges|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/325302/criminal-lawyers-back-review-after-family's-plea|accessdate=14 August 2017|work=Radio NZ|date=25 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170814102630/http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/325302/criminal-lawyers-back-review-after-family's-plea|archivedate=14 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subject to any [[statute of limitations]], the accused could still be charged with an offence reflecting the seriousness of the initial assault.

With advances in modern medicine, most countries have abandoned a fixed time period and test causation on the facts of the case. This is known as "delayed death" and cases where this was applied or was attempted to be applied go back to at least 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.newsweek.com/will-john-hinckley-jr-face-murder-charges-delayed-death-james-brady-263716|journal=Newsweek|title=Will John Hinckley Jr. Face Murder Charges for the 'Delayed Death' of James Brady?|last=Wofford|first=Taylor|date=August 9, 2014|accessdate=2015-02-28|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150310062113/http://www.newsweek.com/will-john-hinckley-jr-face-murder-charges-delayed-death-james-brady-263716|archivedate=March 10, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[England and Wales]], the "year-and-a-day rule" was abolished by the [[Law Reform (Year and a Day Rule) Act 1996]]. However, if death occurs three years or more after the original attack then prosecution can take place only with the [[Attorney-General]]'s approval.

In the United States, many jurisdictions have abolished the rule as well.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3098137125217744818|title=''People v. Carrillo'', 646 N.E.2d 582 (Ill. 1995)|accessdate=2015-06-14|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904003144/http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3098137125217744818|archivedate=2015-09-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14610536214171167663|title=''State v.

In 2001 the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held that retroactive application of a state supreme court decision abolishing the year-and-a-day rule did not violate the [[Ex post facto law|Ex Post Facto]] Clause of [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article I of the United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Rogers v. Tennessee]]'', {{ussc|532|451|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The potential effect of fully abolishing the rule can be seen in the case of 74-year-old William Barnes, charged with the murder of a Philadelphia police officer Walter Barkley, who he'd shot nearly 41 years before. Barnes had served 16 years in prison for attempting to murder Barkley, but when the policeman died on August 19, 2007, this was alleged to be from complications of the wounds suffered from the shooting - and Barnes was charged with his murder. He was acquitted on May 24, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Shooter acquitted of murder charge in 1966 shooting of Philadelphia police officer|url=http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2010/05/shooter_acquitted_of_murder_ch.html|agency=Associated Press|publisher=PA Media Group|date=24 May 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910084004/http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2010/05/shooter_acquitted_of_murder_ch.html|archivedate=10 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder and natural selection==
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2016}}
[[Martin Daly]] and [[Margo Wilson]] of [[McMaster University]] have claimed that several aspects of [[homicide]]s, including the genetic relations or proximity between murderers and their victims, (as in the [[Cinderella effect]]), can often be explained by the [[evolution theory]] or [[evolutionary psychology]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=dan|title=Human behaviour: Killer instincts|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080130/full/451512a.html|website=nature.com|publisher=Nature|accessdate=23 May 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170528155523/http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080130/full/451512a.html|archivedate=28 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Abrahamic religion]]s, the first ever murder was committed by [[Cain]] against his brother Abel out of [[jealousy]].&lt;ref&gt;Schimmel, Solomon. "Envy in Jewish thought and literature." Envy: Theory and research (2008): 17-38.&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, certain types of homicide were lawful and justified. Georg Oesterdiekhoff wrote:

{{quote|Evans-Pritchard says about the [[Nuer people|Nuer]] from Sudan: "Homicide is not forbidden, and Nuer do not think it wrong to kill a man in fair fight. On the contrary, a man who slays another in combat is admired for his courage and skill." ([[E. E. Evans-Pritchard|Evans-Pritchard]] 1956: 195) This statement is true for most African tribes, for pre-modern Europeans, for Indigenous Australians, and for Native Americans, according to ethnographic reports from all over the world. ... Homicides rise to incredible numbers among [[headhunting|headhunter]] cultures such as the [[New Guinea|Papua]]. When a boy is born, the father has to kill a man. He needs a name for his child and can receive it only by a man, he himself has murdered. When a man wants to marry, he must kill a man. When a man dies, his family again has to kill a man.&lt;ref&gt;Georg Oesterdiekhoff.

In many such societies the redress was not via a legal system, but by [[blood feud|blood revenge]], although there might also be a form of payment that could be made instead—such as the [[weregild]] which in early [[Germanic society]] could be paid to the victim's family [[in lieu]] of their right of revenge.

One of the oldest-known prohibitions against murder appears in the Sumerian [[Code of Ur-Nammu]] written sometime between 2100 and 2050 [[Before Christ|BC]]. The code states, "If a man commits a murder, that man must be killed."

In [[Judeo-Christian]] traditions, the [[murder in the Bible|prohibition against murder]] is one of the [[Ten Commandments]] given by God to Moses in (Exodus: 20v13) and (Deuteronomy 5v17). The [[Vulgate]] and subsequent early English translations of the Bible used the term ''secretly killeth his neighbour'' or ''smiteth his neighbour secretly'' rather than ''murder'' for the Latin ''clam percusserit proximum''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latinvulgate.com/verse.aspx?t=0&amp;b=5&amp;c=27 |title='&amp;#39;Vulgate'&amp;#39; Deuteronomy Ch27 V24 |publisher=Latinvulgate.com |accessdate=2010-06-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010204152/http://latinvulgate.com/verse.aspx?t=0&amp;b=5&amp;c=27 |archivedate=2010-10-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hebrewoldtestament.com/B05C027.htm#V24 |title='&amp;#39;Parallel Hebrew Old Testament'&amp;#39; Deuteronomy Ch27 V24 |publisher=Hebrewoldtestament.com |accessdate=2010-06-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129231400/http://hebrewoldtestament.com/B05C027.htm#V24 |archivedate=2010-11-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later editions such as [[Young's Literal Translation]] and the [[World English Bible]] have translated the Latin ''occides'' simply as ''murder''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccel.org/bible/ylt/Exodus/20.html |title=Exodus 20v13 |quote=Thou dost not murder. |website=Young's Literal Translation |accessdate=2011-01-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426062140/http://www.ccel.org/bible/ylt/Exodus/20.html |archivedate=2011-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Exodus 20v13 |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/8229/pg8229.txt |quote=You shall not murder. |website=World English Bible |accessdate=2011-01-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than the alternatives of ''kill'', ''assassinate'', ''fall upon'', or ''slay''.

In [[Islam]] according to the [[Qur'an]], one of the greatest [[sin]]s is to kill a human being who has committed no fault. "For that cause We decreed for the Children of Israel that whosoever killeth a human being for other than manslaughter or corruption in the earth, it shall be as if he had killed all mankind, and whoso saveth the life of one, it shall be as if he had saved the life of all mankind."{{Cite quran|5|32}} "And those who cry not unto any other god along with Allah, nor take the life which Allah hath forbidden save in (course of) justice, nor commit adultery – and whoso doeth this shall pay the penalty."{{Cite quran|25|68}}

Murder demographics are affected by the improvement of [[trauma care]], which has resulted in reduced lethality of violent assaults – thus the murder rate may not necessarily indicate the overall level of social violence.&lt;ref name="harristhomas"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harris |first=Anthony R. |author2=Stephen H.

Workplace homicide, which tripled during the 1980s, is the fastest growing category of murder in America.&lt;ref name="ojp.usdoj.gov" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Csiernik|editor-first=Rick|date=2014 |title=Workplace Wellness: Issues and Responses|url= |location= |publisher=Brown Bear Press|page=19 |isbn=978-1551305714|author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development of murder rates over time in different countries is often used by both supporters and opponents of capital punishment and [[gun control]]. Using properly filtered data, it is possible to make the case for or against either of these issues. For example, one could look at murder rates in the United States from 1950 to 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Christopher Effgen |url=http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm |title=Disaster Center web site |publisher=Disastercenter.com |date=2001-09-11 |accessdate=2010-06-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68d9ZfOC6?url=http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm |archivedate=2012-06-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and notice that those rates went up sharply shortly after a [[capital punishment in the United States|moratorium on death sentences]] was effectively imposed in the late 1960s. This fact has been used to argue that capital punishment serves as a deterrent and, as such, it is morally justified. Capital punishment opponents frequently counter that the United States has much higher murder rates than [[Canada]] and most [[European Union]] countries, although all those countries have abolished the death penalty. Overall, the global pattern is [[chaos theory|too complex]], and on average, the influence of both these factors may not be significant and could be more social, economic, and cultural.

Despite the immense improvements in [[forensics]] in the past few decades, the fraction of murders solved has decreased in the United States, from 90% in 1960 to 61% in 2007.&lt;ref name="mccune"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Beale|first1=Lewis|title=Why Fewer Murder Cases Get Solved These Days|url=https://psmag.com/news/fewer-murder-cases-get-solved-3695|accessdate=10 September 2017|agency=PacificStandard|date=20 May 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910125159/https://psmag.com/news/fewer-murder-cases-get-solved-3695|archivedate=10 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solved murder rates in major U.S. cities varied in 2007 from 36% in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] to 76% in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], [[California]].&lt;ref name="monitor"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Whitley|first1=Brian|title=Why fewer murder cases get solved|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2008/1224/p02s01-usgn.html|accessdate=10 September 2017|publisher=Christian Science Monitor|date=24 December 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910084042/https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2008/1224/p02s01-usgn.html|archivedate=10 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major factors affecting the arrest rate include witness cooperation&lt;ref name="mccune" /&gt; and the number of people assigned to investigate the case.&lt;ref name="monitor" /&gt;

===History of murder rates===
[[File:Homicide-world.png|250px|thumb|Intentional homicide rate per 100,000 inhabitants, 2009]]
According to scholar Pieter Spierenburg [[homicide rates]] per 100,000 in [[Europe]] have fallen over the centuries, from 35 per 100,000 in medieval times, to 20 in 1500&amp;nbsp;AD, 5 in 1700, to below two per 100,000 in 1900.&lt;ref name="Spierenburg"&gt;Spierenburg, Pieter, ''A History of Murder: Personal Violence in Europe from the Middle Ages to the Present'', Polity, 2008. Referred to in [http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2009/11/09/091109crat_atlarge_lepore#ixzz0ePRpHvGz "Rap Sheet Why is American history so murderous?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109044828/http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2009/11/09/091109crat_atlarge_lepore |date=2010-01-09 }} by [[Jill Lepore]] New Yorker, November 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, murder rates have been higher and have fluctuated. They fell below 2 per 100,000 by 1900, rose during the first half of the century, dropped in the years following World War II, and bottomed out at 4.0 in 1957 before rising again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US murder rate by year, 1900-2010|url=https://www.democraticunderground.com/10021998000|website=Democratic Underground|accessdate=10 September 2017|date=16 December 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910083329/https://www.democraticunderground.com/10021998000|archivedate=10 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate stayed in 9 to 10 range most of the period from 1972 to 1994, before falling to 5 in present times.&lt;ref name="Spierenburg" /&gt; The increase since 1957 would have been even greater if not for the significant improvements in medical techniques and emergency response times, which mean that more and more attempted homicide victims survive. According to one estimate, if the lethality levels of criminal assaults of 1964 still applied in 1993, the country would have seen the murder rate of around 26 per 100,000, almost triple the actually observed rate of 9.5 per 100,000.&lt;ref name="harristhomas"/&gt;

[[File:Historical homicide rate in Stockholm.svg|thumb|left|250px|The historical homicide rate in [[Stockholm]] since 1400&amp;nbsp;AD. The murder rate was very high in the [[Middle Ages]]. The rate has declined greatly: from 45 / 100,000 to a low of 0.6 in the 1950s. The last decades have seen the homicide rate rise slowly.]]
A similar, but less pronounced pattern has been seen in major European countries as well. The murder rate in the United Kingdom fell to 1 per 100,000 by the beginning of the 20th century and as low as 0.62 per 100,000 in 1960, and was at 1.28 per 100,000 {{as of|lc=y|2009}}. The murder rate in France (excluding Corsica) bottomed out after World War II at less than 0.4 per 100,000, quadrupling to 1.6 per 100,000 since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cjrc.osu.edu/researchprojects/hvd/AHSV/tables/AHSV%20European%20Homicides.pdf|title=American Homicide Supplemental Volume (AHSV), European Homicides (EH)|author=Randolph Roth|date=October 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100629054202/http://cjrc.osu.edu/researchprojects/hvd/AHSV/tables/AHSV%20European%20Homicides.pdf|archivedate=2010-06-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The specific factors driving this dynamics in murder rates are complex and not universally agreed upon. Much of the raise in the U.S. murder rate during the first half of the 20th century is generally thought to be attributed to gang violence associated with [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]]. Since most murders are committed by young males, the near simultaneous low in the murder rates of major developed countries circa 1960 can be attributed to low birth rates during the Great Depression and World War II. Causes of further moves are more controversial. Some of the more exotic factors claimed to affect murder rates include the availability of abortion&lt;ref&gt;"Freakonomics", Steven D. Levitt, Stephen J. Dubner, 2005, {{ISBN|0-06-073132-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the likelihood of chronic exposure to [[lead poisoning#Nervous system|lead]] during childhood (due to the use of leaded paint in houses and [[tetraethyllead]] as a gasoline additive in internal combustion engines).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Use of the term==
In many countries, in news reports, [[journalists]] are typically careful not to call a killing a murder until the perpetrator is [[convicted]] of such. After arrest, journalists write that the person was "arrested on suspicion of murder".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Doug |last=Fisher |url=http://www.jour.sc.edu/news/csj/CSJ18July03.htm |title=Getting a hand up on court, crime terms |website=Common Sense Journalism |date=July 1, 2003 |accessdate=October 3, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624124935/http://www.jour.sc.edu/news/csj/CSJ18July03.htm |archivedate=June 24, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When a prosecutor files charges, the accused is referred to as an "accused murderer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newscript.com/allege.html |title=Charges &amp; Allegations |website=new script.com |accessdate=October 2, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603212609/http://www.newscript.com/allege.html |archivedate=June 3, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Orlov let''''' ("Eagle's Flight") was the name of an anti-terrorist operation conducted by the Montenegrin police to arrest a group of [[Albanians]] who planned terrorist attacks and an armed conflict in Albanian-inhabited parts of [[Montenegro]]. The group of 17 people planned operations from 2004 to their arrest on the night of 10/11 September 2006. Weapons and explosive material were found in police raids. The group's main operative was the destroying of cultural and religious buildings (Orthodox) in Albanian-inhabited territory. The group was organised by an Albanian association based in [[Detroit]], and members of the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]], from which they received financial aid and [[smuggled arms]] into Montenegro. The group was given a total sentence of 51 years of prison. Relations between the state and the Albanian minority strained after the event.{{sfn|Morrison|2008|p=224}}

The '''Renault Clio Cup United Kingdom''' is an entry level [[One-Design|One-make]], [[Touring car racing]] motor sport category and the current name in the long history of [[Renault]] one-make cups in the UK. It currently attracts drivers from across the [[United Kingdom]] to compete along with several drivers for European countries. The championship has been run to various regulations over the years, and can trace its history back to 1974. Several former drivers have become successful in other [[Touring car racing]] formulae, including [[Andy Priaulx]], who went on to become multiple [[World Touring Car Championship]] champion and [[Jason Plato]] who is multiple [[British Touring Car Championship]] champion. The championship currently runs on the support package of the [[British Touring Car Championship]]. The current series promoter is the [[British Automobile Racing Club]], after previously being the promoter from 1974 to 2011.&lt;ref name=BARC2013&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.renaultsport.co.uk/championships/cliocup/news/british-automobile-racing-club-takes-helm-of-renault-uk-clio-cup_6229/Default.aspx|title=British Automobile Racing Club takes helm of Renault UK Clio Cup|work=Renault Sport UK|publisher=[[Renault Sport]]|date=7 December 2012|accessdate=8 December 2012}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to this, [[Stéphane Ratel Organisation|SRO]] promoted the series in 2012.

==History==
[[File:Fulvio Mussi's Clio (Parc Ferme).JPG|thumb|A [[Renault Clio Renault Sport|Clio Renaultsport 197]], used between 2007 and 2009]]

[[Renault]] have a long history of [[One-Design|One-make racing]] in the UK and the series can trace its root back as far as 1974, when drivers competed in [[Renault 5|Renault 5 TL]]'s. The championship continued with various other models of the Renault 5 including the Renault 5 TS between 1978?–1979? and the Renault 5 GT Turbo between 1987?–1990. When the Renault 5 was replaced with the Mark I [[Renault Clio]], the championship switched too, using the Mark I between 1991 and 1995. The [[Renault Sport Spider]] roadster was used between 1996 and 1999 before returning to the Clio, this time utilizing the newer [[Renault Sport]] versions. In 2000 and 2001, the series used the [[Renault Clio Renault Sport|Clio Renaultsport 172]], followed by the [[Renault Clio Renault Sport|Clio Renaultsport 182]] between 2002 and [[2006 Renault Clio Cup United Kingdom season|2006]]. Between 2007 and 2009, the [[Renault Clio Renault Sport|Clio Renaultsport 197]] was used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.automotoportal.com/article/clio-cup-curtain-raiser-thrills-brands-hatch-crowds Clio Cup curtain-raiser thrills Brands Hatch crowds] ''automotoportal.com'' (April 3, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; This was replaced partway through the [[2009 Renault Clio Cup United Kingdom season|2009 season]] with the latest [[Renault Clio Renault Sport|Clio Renaultsport 200]], which is currently used. However, from the [[2014 Renault Clio Cup United Kingdom season|2014 season]], the new [[Renault Clio Renault Sport|Clio Renaultsport 200 Turbo]] race car will be used for the British championship.&lt;ref name =BARC2013/&gt;

Historically, the championship has been run using the tires from the French manufacturer [[Michelin]]. However, from [[2013 Renault Clio Cup United Kingdom season|2013]], tires for the championship will be supplied be [[Dunlop Tires|Dunlop]] who also supply tires to other championships on the [[TOCA]] package, including the [[British Touring Car Championship|BTCC]]&lt;ref name=BARC2013/&gt;

The series' past champion winners includes [[Andy Priaulx]], [[Jason Plato]] and [[Tom Onslow-Cole]]. Other than that, past drivers of the series that were notable outside of racing were [[Andrew Ridgeley]] of the pop group [[Wham!]] in 1985&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historicracing.com/top100.cfm?driverID=2429&amp;today=on&amp;fromrow=1 The Drivers : Andrew Ridgeley] ''historicracing.com''&lt;/ref&gt; and it introduced actor [[Rowan Atkinson]] to motorsport, which he raced seldom between 1984 to 1990. One of his races was documented for his one-off show, ''Driven Man''. The car has since re-emerged for a reunion race in 2004, which he aimed to compete in, but had to be substituted by [[Perry McCarthy]], due to illness. Atkinson bought the car following the race and was auctioned off in a [[Bonhams]] auction in 2005.

The championship currently has 16 races held at eight double header rounds at circuits across [[England]]. The series supports the [[British Touring Car Championship]] at eight of its ten rounds. In [[2012 Renault Clio Cup United Kingdom season|2012]], [[Brands Hatch]] held two rounds of the championship, whilst [[Donington Park]], [[Thruxton Circuit|Thruxton]], [[Oulton Park]], [[Snetterton Motor Racing Circuit|Snetterton]], [[Rockingham Motor Speedway|Rockingham]] and [[Silverstone Circuit|Sliverstone]] each held one round. In the past, the series has also formed part of the support package for the British rounds of the [[World Series by Renault]].

On a race weekend, the drivers have a 30-minute qualifying session, with the fastest times setting the grid for race one and their second fastest times setting the race 2 grid. Races are held over a minimum of 30 miles.&lt;ref name=2012regs&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.barc.net/file_download/107/RENAULT_CLIO_REGS.pdf|archive-url=https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20121102000448/http://www.barc.net/file_download/107/RENAULT_CLIO_REGS.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2 November 2012|title=2012 AIRASIA RENAULT UK CLIO CUP CHAMPIONSHIP REGULATIONS|work=[[British Automobile Racing Club]]|publisher=[[British Automobile Racing Club]]|date=27 February 2012|accessdate=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other UK Championships==
When the [[British Automobile Racing Club]] returned as Clio Cup UK series promoter in December 2012, they set out their plans for the national championship for the next two years. With the announcement that the current [[Renault Clio Renault Sport|Clio Renaultsport 200]] race car will be replaced from [[2014 Renault Clio Cup United Kingdom season|2014 season]], Renault UK and the [[British Automobile Racing Club|BARC]] announced a new entry level series to be known as the '''[[Michelin]] Clio Cup Series with [[Protyre]]'''. This championship, which will begin in 2013, is aimed at amateur and track day drivers and will use the current [[Renault Clio Renault Sport|Clio Renaultsport 200]] as well as the previous generation [[Renault Clio Renault Sport|Clio Renaultsport 197]]. A four round, double header calendar was also announced for 2013, visiting four of the UK's top racing circuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.renaultsport.co.uk/championships/cliocup/news/new-entry-level-clio-cup-series-launched-by-renault---barc_6231/Default.aspx|title=New entry-level Clio Cup Series launched by Renault &amp; BARC|work=Renault Sport UK|publisher=[[Renault Sport]]|date=17 December 2012|accessdate=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2017 onwards, there will be a junior edition of the Renault Clio Cup for young drivers aged 14–17.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.renaultsport.co.uk/press-centre/renault-uk-clio-cup-junior/new-renault-uk-clio-cup-junior-championship-launched-for-2017/|title=Renault Clio Cup Junior|last=|first=|date=|website=Renault Sport|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410220638/http://www.renaultsport.co.uk/press-centre/renault-uk-clio-cup-junior/new-renault-uk-clio-cup-junior-championship-launched-for-2017/|archive-date=2017-04-10|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Rolling Stone''''' was a weekly tabloid newspaper published in [[Kampala]], Uganda. The paper published its first issue on 23 August 2010, under the direction of 22-year-old Giles Muhame and two classmates from Kampala's [[Makerere University]].&lt;ref name="Atlantic"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/06/death-by-tabloid/8491/ |title=Death by Tabloid |author=Xan Rice |date=June 2011 |work=The Atlantic |accessdate=13 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MSNBC&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/39742685/ns/world_news-africa/ "Gays in Uganda say they're living in fear"], Godfrey Olukya &amp; Jason Straziuso, ''[[MSNBC]]'', [[Associated Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Muhame, the paper's title was derived from the local word ''enkurungu'': "It's a metaphor for something that strikes with lightning speed, that can kill someone if it is thrown at them".&lt;ref name="Atlantic"/&gt; The paper was small, with a circulation of approximately 2000 copies.&lt;ref name=MSNBC/&gt; It suspended publication in November 2010, after the High Court ruled that it had violated the fundamental rights of LGBT Ugandans by attempting to [[outing|out]] them and calling for their deaths. One of those listed, [[David Kato]], was subsequently murdered.

The Ugandan paper is unaffiliated with the American magazine ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', which later described the Ugandan paper's actions as "horrific" and protested its choice of name.&lt;ref name="Not in our name"&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/17390/223945 "Not In Our Name: Ugandan Newspaper’s Horrific Action"], ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', 21 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reporting on homosexuality==
On 9 October 2010, the newspaper published a front-page article—titled "100 Pictures of Uganda's Top Homos Leak"—that listed the names, photographs and addresses of 100 homosexuals alongside a yellow banner that read "Hang Them".&lt;ref name=MSNBC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/21/ugandan-paper-gay-people-hanged "Ugandan paper calls for gay people to be hanged"], Xan Rice, [[guardian.co.uk]], 21 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The paper also alleged that homosexuals aimed to "[[Homosexual recruitment|recruit]]" Ugandan children. This publication attracted international attention and criticism from human rights organizations, such as [[Amnesty International]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/ugandan-gay-rights-activist-%E2%80%98i-have-watch-my-back-more-ever%E2%80%99-2010-11-05 "Ugandan gay rights activist: ‘I have to watch my back more than ever'"], 5 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; [[No Peace Without Justice]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npwj.org/Other/Uganda-Stop-homophobic-campaign-launched-Rolling-Stone-tabloid.html-0 "Uganda: Stop homophobic campaign launched by Rolling Stone tabloid"], 14 October 2010, [[No Peace Without Justice]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association]].&lt;ref name=ILGA&gt;[http://ilga.org/ilga/en/article/mE8jac21Q7 "Uganda Newspaper Published Names/Photos of LGBT Activists and HRDs – Cover Says 'Hang Them'"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110201032313/http://ilga.org/ilga/en/article/mE8jac21Q7 |date=1 February 2011 }}, [[International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[gay rights]] activists, many Ugandans have been attacked since the publication as a result of their real or perceived [[sexual orientation]].&lt;ref name=Independent&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/outcry-as-ugandan-paper-names-top-homosexuals-2113348.html "Outcry as Ugandan paper names 'top homosexuals'"], Simon Akam, ''[[The Independent]]'', 22 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; One woman was reportedly almost killed when her neighbors began to stone her house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-11666789 |title=Uganda's Rolling Stone paper told to stop outing gays |date=1 November 2010 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a subsequent issue, ''Rolling Stone'' alleged a connection between [[Somali people|Somali]] terrorist group [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|al-Shabaab]] and Ugandan homosexuals under the headline "Homo Generals Plotted Kampala Terror Attacks", charging "a gay lobby" with complicity in the [[July 2010 Kampala attacks|July 2010 Kampala suicide bombings]].&lt;ref name="Atlantic"/&gt;

==Court case==
Following a second published edition listing the identities and addresses of alleged homosexuals, the gay rights organization [[Sexual Minorities Uganda]] petitioned the Ugandan High Court against the newspaper. On 2 November 2010, the court issued its verdict, ordering the newspaper to stop publishing the identities of Ugandan gays, shut down, and pay 1.5 million [[Ugandan shilling]]s plus court costs to each of the plaintiffs.&lt;ref name="hrf"&gt;[http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/2011/01/04/court-affirms-rights-of-ugandan-gays/ Court Affirms Rights of Ugandan Gays]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reuters110210/&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN110210&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/africa/11/02/uganda.gay.list/?hpt=T2 "Judge orders Ugandan paper to stop publishing 'gay lists'"], ''[[CNN International]]'', 2 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling said that these lists and the accompanying incitement to violence threatened the subjects' "fundamental rights and freedoms", attacked their right to human dignity, and violated their constitutional right to privacy.

Immediately following the verdict, Muhame told reporters that "the war against gays will and must continue. We have to protect our children from this dirty homosexual affront".&lt;ref name=Reuters110210&gt;{{cite news|date = 2 November 2010|accessdate =29 January 2011|url = https://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE6A103F20101102|title = Uganda court orders anti-gay paper to shut|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2011, he announced the paper's intention to appeal the decision.&lt;ref name="I2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.independent.co.ug/index.php/component/content/article/106-myblog/3796-uganda-talks-exclusive-rolling-stone-newspaper-to-appeal-high-court-ruling |title=UGANDA TALKS EXCLUSIVE: Rolling Stone newspaper to appeal High Court ruling |author=Giles Muhame |date=3 January 2011 |work=The Independent (Uganda) |accessdate=13 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that the paper was also gathering signatures of support from Ugandans.&lt;ref name="I2"/&gt;

The unrelated U.S. magazine ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', called the newspaper's actions "horrific" and stated that ''Rolling Stone'' magazine has  "demanded they [the Ugandan newspaper] cease using our name as a title".&lt;ref name="Not in our name"&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/17390/223945 "Not In Our Name: Ugandan Newspaper’s Horrific Action"], ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', 21 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; However, the magazine had little legal recourse because, despite copyrighting the name "Rolling Stone" in a large number of countries, they had not copyrighted it in Uganda. As publisher [[Jann Wenner]] stated, "There's nothing we can do. We never copyrighted the name in Uganda. We own the copyright for the name in many, many countries. But who would have thought we'd have to own the copyright in Uganda?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2010/10/jann_wenner_who_would_have_tho.html "Jann Wenner: 'Who Would Have Thought We’d Have to Own the ''Rolling Stone'' Copyright in Uganda?'"], 20 October 2010, ''[[New York Magazine]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Press Institute]] sent a letter to Muhame condemning his actions after his paper was shut down by the countries Constitutional Court. "IPI believes that when newspapers publish articles that expose private information about individuals who are outside the public eye, and when they call for violence against those individuals, they do a disservice to journalists around the world who are fighting for press freedom...Such transgressions of professional journalistic ethics make all journalists look bad – and make it harder to argue for press freedom without government restriction."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freemedia.at/newssview/article/ugandan-judge-says-rolling-stone-paper-invaded-privacy-in-outing-alleged-gays.html Ugandan Judge Says Rolling Stone Paper Invaded Privacy in Outing Alleged Gays IPI to Rolling Stone: You Make Our Job Harder]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kato murder==
{{Main|David Kato}}
[[Sexual Minorities Uganda]] leader [[David Kato]], one of the activists outed in the article and a co-plaintiff in the lawsuit, was murdered in his home by an intruder who struck him twice on the head with a hammer.&lt;ref name="Grauniad"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/27/ugandan-gay-rights-activist-murdered |title=Ugandan gay rights activist murdered weeks after court victory |first=Xan |last=Rice |date=27 January 2011 |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt; The American magazine ''Rolling Stone'',&lt;ref name="hrf"/&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{Cite news |work=The New York Times|date=27 January 2011|accessdate=29 January 2011 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/28/world/africa/28uganda.html |first=Jeffrey |last=Gettleman |title=Ugandan Who Spoke Up for Gays Is Beaten to Death}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other news sources&lt;ref name=SMH/&gt; suggested that the murder was linked to Kato's high-profile outing in the Ugandan newspaper ''Rolling Stone'', and [[Human Rights Watch]] and [[Amnesty International]] both called for an investigation into the case and protection for other gay activists.&lt;ref name=SMH&gt;{{cite news|title = Murdered Ugandan gay activist talked of threats|author = Rice, Xan|date = 29 January 2011|accessdate =29 January 2011|work = Sydney Morning Herald|url = http://www.smh.com.au/world/murdered-ugandan-gay-activist-talked-of-threats-20110128-1a8ej.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muhame condemned the murder and expressed his sympathies for Kato's family, but added that he believed that the paper was not responsible and that the murder was a simple robbery: "I have no regrets about the story. We were just exposing people who were doing wrong".&lt;ref name="Guard"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/27/uganda-paper-david-kato-death |title=Ugandan 'hang them' paper has no regrets after David Kato death |author=Xan Rice |date=27 January 2011 |work=The Guardian  |accessdate=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muhame stated to the Ugandan newspaper ''[[Daily Monitor]]'', that Kato "brought death upon himself. He hasn’t lived carefully. Kato was a shame to this country".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/-/688334/1097190/-/cio6rmz/-/index.html |title=World condemns killing of gay activist |author=Risdel Kasasira |date=28 January 2011 |work=Daily Monitor |accessdate=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; To [[CNN]], he said, "When we called for hanging of gay people, we meant ... after they have gone through the legal process ... I did not call for them to be killed in cold blood like he was".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/01/28/uganda.gay.activist/index.html?hpt=T2|title = Mourners to remember gay rights activist beaten to death|publisher=CNN|date = 28 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=May 2014}}
[[File:Single Point of Failure.png|200px|right|thumb|In this diagram the [[router (computing)|router]] is a single point of failure for the communication network between computers]]
A '''single point of failure''' ('''SPOF''') is a part of a system that, if it [[failure|fails]], will [[Cascading failure|stop the entire system from working]].&lt;ref&gt;1:  
Designing Large-scale LANs – Page 31, K. Dooley, O'Reilly, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; SPOFs are undesirable in any system with a goal of [[high availability]] or [[Reliability engineering|reliability]], be it a business practice, software application, or other industrial system.

==Overview==
Systems can be made robust by adding [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]] in all potential SPOFs. For instance, the owner of a small [[tree care]] company may only own one [[woodchipper]]. If the chipper breaks, he may be unable to complete his current job and may have to cancel future jobs until he can obtain a replacement.

Redundancy can be achieved at various levels. For instance, the owner of the tree care company may have [[spare part]]s ready for the repair of the wood chipper, in case it fails. At a higher level, he may have a second wood chipper that he can bring to the job site. Finally, at the highest level, he may have enough equipment available to completely replace everything at the work site in the case of multiple failures.

The assessment of a potential SPOF involves identifying the critical components of a complex system that would provoke a total systems failure in case of [[wikt:malfunction|malfunction]]. Highly [[reliability engineering|reliable system]]s should not rely on any such individual component.

&lt;gallery class="center" widths=320 heights=200&gt;

File:Spof_complex.svg|Completely redundant system without SPOFs.(Note: Assumes Generator and Grid sources are each rated at N, Each UPS is rated at N and "A/C" and "Electrical" are in themselves completely fault tolerant systems.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Computing==
{{main|Fault-tolerant computer system}}
In computing, redundancy can be achieved at the internal component level, at the system level (multiple machines), or site level (replication).

One would normally deploy a load balancer to ensure high availability for a server cluster at the system level.

In a high-availability [[Server (computing)|server]] [[Computer cluster|cluster]], each individual server may attain internal component redundancy by having multiple power supplies, hard drives, and other components. System level redundancy could be obtained by having spare servers waiting to take on the work of another server if it fails.

Since a data center is often a support center for other operations such as business logic, it represents a potential SPOF in itself. Thus, at the site level, the entire cluster may be replicated at another location, where it can be accessed in case the primary location becomes unavailable. This is typically addressed as part of an IT disaster recovery (resiliency) program.

[[Paul Baran]] and [[Donald Davies]] developed [[packet switching]], a key part of "survivable communications networks".
Such networks{{snd}} including [[ARPANET]] and the [[Internet]]{{snd}} are designed to have no single point of failure.
Multiple paths between any two points on the network allow those points to continue communicating with each other, the packets [[dynamic routing|"routing around" damage]], even after any single failure of any one particular path or any one intermediate node.

Network protocols used to prevent SPOF:
* [[Intermediate System to Intermediate System]]
* [[Open Shortest Path First]]
* [[Shortest Path Bridging]]

=== Software engineering ===
In [[software engineering]], a '''bottleneck''' occurs when the capacity of an [[software application|application]] or a computer system is severely limited by a single component. The bottleneck has lowest throughput of all parts of the transaction path.

=== Performance engineering ===
Tracking down bottlenecks (sometimes known as "'''hot spots'''" - sections of the code that execute most frequently - i.e. have the highest execution count) is called [[Profiling (computer programming)|performance analysis]]. Reduction is usually achieved with the help of specialized tools, known as [[Profiling (computer programming)|performance analyzers]] or [[Profiler (computer science)|profilers]]. The objective being to make those particular sections of code perform as fast as possible to improve overall [[algorithmic efficiency]].

=== Computer security ===
A mistake in just one component can compromise the entire system.

==Other fields==
The concept of a single point of failure has also been applied to fields outside of engineering, computers, and networking, such as corporate [[supply chain]] management&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gary S. Lynch|title=Single Point of Failure: The 10 Essential Laws of Supply Chain Risk Management|isbn=978-0-470-42496-4|publisher=Wiley|date=Oct 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and transportation management.&lt;ref name=crucialstuck&gt;[http://wnpr.org/post/crucial-century-old-and-sometimes-stuck-connecticut-bridge-key-northeast-corridor "Crucial, Century-Old, And Sometimes Stuck: Connecticut Bridge Is Key To Northeast Corridor"]. [[Connecticut Public Radio]], August 8, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Design structures that create single points of failure include [[bottleneck (software)|bottleneck]]s and [[series circuit]]s (in contrast to [[parallel circuit]]s).

In transportation, some noted recent examples of the concept's recent application have included the [[Nipigon River Bridge]] in Canada, where a partial bridge failure in January 2016 entirely severed road traffic between [[Eastern Canada]] and [[Western Canada]] for several days because it is located along a portion of the [[Trans-Canada Highway]] where there is no alternate [[detour]] route for vehicles to take;&lt;ref&gt;[http://globalnews.ca/news/2447050/the-nipigon-river-bridge-and-other-trans-canada-bottlenecks/ "The Nipigon River Bridge and other Trans-Canada bottlenecks"]. [[Global News]], January 11, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Norwalk River Railroad Bridge]] in [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]], [[Connecticut]], an aging [[swing bridge]] that sometimes gets stuck when opening or closing, disrupting rail traffic on the [[Northeast Corridor]] line.&lt;ref name=crucialstuck/&gt;

The concept of a single point of failure has also been applied to the fields of intelligence. [[Edward Snowden]] talked of the dangers of being what he described as "the single point of failure" – the sole repository of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/11185627/Edward-Snowden-the-true-story-behind-his-NSA-leaks.html|title=Edward Snowden: the true story behind his NSA leaks|newspaper=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2016-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Slashing''' is a crime intended to cause bodily harm to a victim. A slashing is typically performed with a [[knife]] or other type of bladed or sharp object.

==Slashing of the throat==
Cutting of the throat as to render the victim unable to [[breathing|breathe]].

==Slashing of the face==
A street crime where a perpetrator permanently disfigures a victim by slicing into their face with a blade.

Boxer [[Teddy Atlas]] was involved in a street fight in [[Stapleton, Staten Island]] in which his face was severely slashed with a "007" flip-knife. The wound took 400 stitches in total to close, with 200 on the outside of his face and 200 on the inside. He is left with a scar that stretches from top to bottom along his left cheek.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dratlasfoundation.com/aboutus_bio_teddyatlas.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917050810/http://dratlasfoundation.com/aboutus_bio_teddyatlas.html |archivedate=2011-09-17 |df= }} Teddy Atlas Biography&lt;/ref&gt;

Actress and comedian [[Tina Fey]] has a scar a few inches long on the left side of her chin and cheek, the cause of which remained unexplained to the public until a 2008 ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' profile by [[Maureen Dowd]]. Dowd reported "...a faint scar runs across Tina Fey's left cheek, the result of a violent cutting attack by a stranger when Fey was five..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dowd|first=Maureen|title=What Tina Wants|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/2009/01/tina_fey200901|work=VanityFair.com|publisher=Vanity Fair (Condé Nast Publications)|accessdate=January 12, 2012|date=January 2009|quote=... a faint scar runs across Tina Fey's left cheek, the result of a violent cutting attack by a stranger when Fey was five. Her husband says, "It was in, like, the front yard of her house, and somebody who just came up, and she just thought somebody marked her with a pen." ...|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120818112826/http://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/2009/01/tina_fey200901|archivedate=August 18, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently in her autobiographical book, where she revealed "During the spring semester of kindergarten, I was slashed in the face by a stranger in the alley behind my house... When my face was slashed, my dad held me on his lap in the car to the hospital, applying direct pressure with the swift calm of a veteran and an ex-fireman. I looked up and asked him, ‘Am I going to die?’ ‘Don’t speak,’ he said."&lt;ref&gt;''Bossypants''&lt;/ref&gt;

Actor [[Tommy Flanagan (actor)|Tommy Flanagan]] was the victim of a slashing when he was mugged outside of a club he was working at in Scotland. The slashing on both of his cheeks left him with what is known as a "[[Glasgow smile]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://fuckyeahtommyflanagan.tumblr.com/post/10498778098/seraphina01-fuckyeahtommyflanagan | title=Tommy Flanagan - Where the Ride Takes You | author=Alex Simon | date=February 2001 | accessdate=10 June 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130429101839/http://fuckyeahtommyflanagan.tumblr.com/post/10498778098/seraphina01-fuckyeahtommyflanagan | archivedate=29 April 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://glaswegiansmiler.tumblr.com/post/14722738285/film-review-january-2000-the-brit-at-the-back | title=The Brit at the Back | work=Film Review | date=January 2000 | accessdate=10 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Booth|first=Samantha|title=Scots actor Tommy Flanagan rocks on in Hollywood as biker gang drama takes off|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-interviews/2010/03/21/scots-actor-tommy-flanagan-rocks-on-in-hollywood-as-biker-gang-drama-takes-off-86908-22127632/|newspaper=Sunday Mail (UK)|date=21 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Terfenadine''' is an [[antihistamine]] formerly used for the treatment of [[allergy|allergic]] conditions. It was brought to market by [[Hoechst Marion Roussel]] (now [[Sanofi-Aventis]]) and was marketed under various brand names, including '''Seldane''' in the [[United States]], '''Triludan''' in the [[United Kingdom]], and '''Teldane''' in [[Australia]].&lt;ref name="jama96"/&gt; It was superseded by [[fexofenadine]] in the 1990s due to the risk of a particular type of disruption of the electrical rhythms of the heart (specifically [[Cardiac dysrhythmia|cardiac arrhythmia]] caused by [[QT interval]] prolongation) and has been withdrawn from markets worldwide.&lt;Ref&gt;Horak F. Antialergic and Vasoactive Drugs for Allergic Rhinitis. Chapter 4 in Allergy Frontiers:Therapy and Prevention. Volume 5 of Allergy Frontiers. Eds Pawankar R et al Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2010 {{ISBN|9784431993629}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|53}}

==Pharmacology==
Terfenadine acts as a [[peripherally-selective drug|peripherally-selective]] [[antihistamine]], or [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] of the [[histamine]] [[H1 receptor|H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor]]. It is a [[prodrug]], generally completely [[metabolism|metabolized]] to the active form [[fexofenadine]] in the [[liver]] by the [[enzyme]] [[cytochrome P450 3A4]]. Due to its near complete metabolism by the liver immediately after leaving the gut, terfenadine normally is not measurable in the plasma. Terfenadine itself, however, is [[cardiotoxic]] at higher doses, while its major [[active metabolite]] is not. Terfenadine, in addition to its antihistamine effects, also acts as a [[potassium channel blocker]] (K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;11.1 encoded by the gene ''[[hERG]]''). Since its active metabolite is not a potassium channel blocker, no cardiotoxicity is associated with [[fexofenadine]].&lt;ref name="Cir1996"/&gt; Toxicity is possible after years of continued use with no previous problems as a result of an interaction with other medications such as [[erythromycin]], or foods such as [[List of drugs affected by grapefruit|grapefruit]]. The addition of, or a dosage increase in, these CYP3A4 inhibitors makes it harder for the body to metabolize and remove terfenadine. In larger plasma concentrations, it may lead to toxic effects on the heart's rhythm (e.g. [[ventricular tachycardia]] and ''[[torsades de pointes]]'').

==History==
In the United States, Seldane was brought to market in 1985 as the first [[non-sedating antihistamines|nonsedating antihistamine]] for the treatment of [[allergic rhinitis]].&lt;ref name="jama96"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ladainews"/&gt; In June 1990, evidence of serious ventricular arrhythmias among those taking Seldane prompted the FDA to issue a report on the [[risk factor]]s associated with [[wikt:concomitant|concomitant]] use of the drug with [[macrolide]] antibiotics and [[ketoconazole]].&lt;ref name="jama96"/&gt; Two months later, the FDA required the manufacturer to send a letter to all physicians, alerting them to the problem; in July 1992, the existing precautions were elevated to a [[black box warning]]&lt;ref name="jama96"/&gt; and the issue attracted mass media attention in reports that people with liver disease or who took ketoconazole, an antifungal agent, or the antibiotic [[erythromycin]], could suffer [[cardiac dysrhythmia|cardiac arrhythmia]] if they also took Seldane.&lt;ref name="ladainews"/&gt;

In January 1997, the same month when the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) had earlier approved a generic version of Seldane made by [[Ivax Corporation|IVAX Corporation]] of Miami, the FDA recommended terfenadine-containing drugs be removed from the market and physicians consider alternative medications for their patients.&lt;ref name="ladainews"/&gt; Seldane (and Seldane-D, terfenadine combined with the decongestant [[pseudoephedrine]]) were removed from the U.S. market by their manufacturer in late 1997 after the FDA approval of Allegra-D (fexofenadine/pseudoephedrine).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= FDA Approves Allegra-D, Manufacturer To Withdraw Seldane From Marketplace | publisher= [[Food and Drug Administration]] | url= http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ANSWERS/ANS00843.html | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080223144824/http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ANSWERS/ANS00843.html | archivedate= 2008-02-23 | accessdate=2010-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terfenadine-containing drugs were subsequently removed from the Canadian market in 1999,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/medeff/advers-react-neg/fs-if/terfenadine_e.html Status of Terfenadine-Containing Drugs in Canada&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060713234226/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/medeff/advers-react-neg/fs-if/terfenadine_e.html |date=2006-07-13 }} from [[Health Canada]]&lt;/ref&gt; and are no longer available for prescription in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpnotebook.com/simplepage.cfm?ID=-1603600346 Terfenadine- General Practice notebook] from GPnotebook.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Donner Party''''' is a 1992 documentary film that traces the history of the [[Donner Party]], an ill-fated pioneer group that trekked from [[Springfield, Illinois]] to [[Sutter's Fort]], California - a disastrous journey of 2500 miles made famous by the tales of cannibalism the survivors told upon reaching their destination. The film, narrated by [[David McCullough]], premiered at the [[Telluride Mountainfilm Festival]] in May 1992 with an introductory lecture on the Donner Party by noted Western historian [[David Lavender]]. It subsequently aired on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] as part of the ''[[American Experience]]'' program in October, 1992.

The film was produced using a combination of archival materials, including letters, photographs, paintings, and diaries from members of the Donner Party, as well as new footage shot of the trail the Party journeyed along in Oregon and California. Animated maps are used to show the route the Donner Party took. On-camera experts include [[Harold Schindler]], Joseph King, Donald Buck, and [[Wallace Stegner]]. [[Timothy Hutton]], [[Amy Madigan]], [[Frances Sternhagen]], [[George Plimpton]], [[Lois Smith]], and [[Eli Wallach]] perform the letters and diaries written by the Donner Party before, during, and after their journey.

==Synopsis==
In 1846, a large wagon train left [[Springfield, Illinois]] for [[California]]. In July of that year, following the advice of ''The Emigrants' Guide to Oregon and California'' written by a pro-emigration promoter named [[Lansford Hastings]], the Donner party left the main body of emigrants to take a never before tried “shortcut” across the [[Great Basin Divide|Great Basin]].

The Donner Party arrived at the foot of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], the last mountain pass before California, weeks behind schedule and short of food. The first blizzard of the season started only one day before they planned to head up and over the Sierra Nevada. With 95% of their journey already completed, they would be forced to wait months to make the final push, enduring the most unfavorable Sierra Nevada winter in history. The group was trapped on the eastern side of the Sierra for five months, culminating in death and cannibalism. Of the 87 men, women, and children in the Donner Party only 46 survived to reach California.

==Critical reception==
[[Time (magazine)|''TIME'' magazine]] called the film "a grueling, unforgettable trip" and named it one of the top ten television programs of the year.&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,976917,00.html|newspaper=TIME| title=Short Takes|date=November 2, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[USA Today]]''’s [[Matt Roush]] wrote, “Historical narratives rarely have as much dire beauty as Ric Burns’s ''The Donner Party'', a documentary that aches with the austere eloquence of human desperation.”{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}  Kevin Thomas of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' characterized Burns as a "low key" director and wrote that the film "has everything: heroism, cowardice, stupefying folly and price and a truly terrible irony."&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Los Angeles Times|date=October 19, 1992|title=?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''The Truth'''" is the collective name for the 201st and 202nd episodes of the American [[science fiction on television|science fiction]] television series ''[[The X-Files]]''. The last episodes of the show's [[The X-Files (season 9)|ninth season]], "The Truth" originally served as the finale for the entire series, until the [[The X-Files (season 10)|return of the series]] in January 2016. First aired together on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network on May&amp;nbsp;19, 2002, the episodes were written by series creator [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] and directed by [[Kim Manners]]. "The Truth" was the most-watched episode of the ninth season and was seen by 13.25 million viewers upon its initial broadcast. The finale received mixed reviews, with many commentators criticizing the episode's lack of closure. Others were pleased with the full return of actor [[David Duchovny]] to the series, as well as the episode's conclusion.

The show centers on [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] special agents who work on unsolved paranormal cases called [[X-File]]s; this season focuses on the investigations of [[John Doggett]] ([[Robert Patrick]]), [[Monica Reyes]] ([[Annabeth Gish]]), and [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]). In this episode, Walter Skinner ([[Mitch Pileggi]]) and Scully learn that Mulder{{em dash}}who has been missing for almost a year{{em dash}}has been placed under military arrest for the supposed murder of [[Knowle Rohrer]] ([[Adam Baldwin]]), one of the government's secret "Super Soldiers". Mulder breaks out of prison with the help of Skinner, Reyes, Doggett, Scully and Alvin Kersh ([[James Pickens, Jr.]]). Mulder and Scully travel to [[New Mexico]] where helicopters destroy an Anasazi cliff dwelling ruin along with [[The Smoking Man]] ([[William B. Davis]]).

The episode featured the return of Duchovny—following his departure after the [[Existence (The X-Files)|eighth-season finale]]—as well as several other recurring characters. "The Truth" served to conclude many long-time story arcs while creating new ones for a possible [[The X-Files franchise|film franchise]]. Shooting took place at various [[California]] locales, including a hydroelectric power plant east of [[Fresno, California|Fresno]] and [[Anza-Borrego Desert State Park]]. Carter would return to ''The X-Files'' universe with a feature film, ''[[The X-Files: I Want to Believe]]'' (2008), and has publicly discussed the possibility of a third film, which would focus on the impending extraterrestrial invasion revealed in "The Truth".

==Plot==
At the [[Mount Weather Emergency Operations Center|Mount Weather]] military base, [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) appears with several government officials. He gains access to highly classified documents on a secure computer system, and is shocked and dismayed to read the documents, which provide details of the final colonization of the planet by [[Colonist (The X-Files)|alien forces]]. Before he can continue reading, Mulder hears another person approaching. He hides quickly and observes [[Knowle Rohrer]] ([[Adam Baldwin]]), a former friend of [[John Doggett]] ([[Robert Patrick]]) but who has been irreversibly transformed into an enemy "[[Super Soldiers (The X-Files)|Super Soldier]]", approach the computer system. Rohrer immediately realizes the system has been accessed. Mulder attempts to attack Rohrer, but Rohrer overpowers him. Mulder frantically flees, but Rohrer outflanks him. In a violent altercation, Mulder flips Rohrer off a catwalk onto high-voltage wiring, and Rohrer apparently dies by electrocution. Mulder attempts to escape, but is quickly arrested by several soldiers.

News of Mulder's arrest spreads to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]. Upon hearing that he has resurfaced, and in such a dire manner, [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) and [[Walter Skinner]] ([[Mitch Pileggi]]) visit him in military custody. During his time in captivity, Mulder receives mysterious visits from two phantoms of his past: [[Alex Krycek]] ([[Nicholas Lea]]) and [[X (The X-Files)|X]] ([[Steven Williams]]). Meanwhile, Scully and Skinner go to great lengths to get him released, but are unsuccessful. Mulder's fate is ultimately made the subject of a military tribunal with Deputy Director [[Alvin Kersh]] ([[James Pickens, Jr.]]) in charge. At the outset, it appears Mulder will become the hopeless victim of a [[show trial]] stacked against him.

Skinner takes Mulder's defense, while Scully, Doggett, [[Monica Reyes]] ([[Annabeth Gish]]), [[Marita Covarrubias]] ([[Laurie Holden]]), [[List of minor The X-Files characters#Gibson Praise|Gibson Praise]] (Jeff Gulka) and [[Jeffrey Spender]] ([[Chris Owens (actor)|Chris Owens]]) testify on Mulder's behalf. The prosecution presents Rohrer's body as evidence against Mulder. Aware that Rohrer is a seemingly-invincible "Super Soldier", Scully performs a  medical examination and proves that the body is not that of Rohrer. Despite this, the evidence is rejected, given that the autopsy was not authorized, and the defense is overruled. Mulder is sentenced to death for the murder of a military officer. Later, Doggett, Skinner, Reyes, and Scully help Mulder escape, with the unexpected help of Kersh who decided he should have let Mulder go in the first place. Despite being advised to immediately leave the continent via Canada, Mulder instead takes Scully to [[New Mexico]]. On their way, Mulder receives a visit by three additional ghosts: [[The Lone Gunmen]], who advise him to flee for his life rather than continue his pursuit of the truth. Mulder politely declines. Meanwhile, Doggett and Reyes find their office emptied, suggesting that the X-Files have been closed down for the third time.

Mulder and Scully arrive at [[Anasazi]] ruins to find a "wise man" who they believe can make sense of the classified documents Mulder has read. They discover the so-called "wise man" is none other than [[The Smoking Man]] ([[William B. Davis]]), who, still alive after all, is hiding out to survive the colonization—an event that will happen on [[2012 doomsday prediction|December&amp;nbsp;22, 2012]], the predicted [[Eschatology|end of the world]]. Outside, Reyes and Doggett arrive and prepare to fight Rohrer, who has been sent to kill Mulder and The Smoking Man. Rohrer is killed when the [[magnetite]] in the ruins affects his superhuman body. Switching cars with Mulder and Scully, Doggett and Reyes drive off. [[Black helicopters]] destroy the cliff dwellings—and The Smoking Man within—thinking that Mulder is still inside before flying away. Doggett and Reyes are last seen speeding away.

In a motel room in [[Roswell, New Mexico]], Mulder and Scully prepare for bed and talk. Mulder explains his belief "that the dead are not lost to us. That they speak to us as part of something greater than us—greater than any alien force. And if you and I are powerless now, I want to believe that if we listen to what's speaking, it can give us the power to save ourselves." Despite their slim chance for success, Mulder declares, "Maybe there's hope", as they lay back, content in each other's arms, in a loving embrace.&lt;ref name="BBC1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/xfiles/episodeguide/nine/page19.shtml |title=The Truth |website=BBC Cult |publisher=BBC|accessdate=May 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/xfiles/episodeguide/nine/page20.shtml |title=The Truth, Part Two |website=BBC Cult |publisher=BBC|accessdate=May 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
[[File:Chris Carter (July 2008).jpg|Chris Carter wrote the episode and noted that "it was strange to be writing these things knowing it was the last time".&lt;ref name="truthtruth" /&gt;|200px|thumb|upright|alt=A man with white hair is looking and smiling at the camera.]]

===Writing===
The episode was written by series creator Chris Carter. He noted, "It's the end—you don't get another chance. So you'd better put everything you've ever wanted to put in into the episode. There were things to distract us from what was really going on.

Several of the episode's scenes feature elements that refer to the earlier installments.

With this episode, Duchovny rejoined the main cast of ''The X-Files'' after his departure following the [[The X-Files (season 8)|eighth season]] finale "Existence". The episode marks the only time that all five principal actors—Duchovny, Anderson, Patrick, Gish, and Pileggi—are credited together in the opening titles.&lt;ref name=truthepisode/&gt; Mulder, Scully, and the Smoking Man are the only characters to appear in both this episode and the series' pilot.&lt;ref name=truthepisode/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink= Pilot (The X-Files)| title= Pilot | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits = [[Robert Mandel]] (director); [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] (writer) | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] | season = 1  | number = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This episode is the fourth of only four episodes in season nine where Duchovny appeared, the others being "[[Trust No 1]]", "[[Jump the Shark (The X-Files)|Jump the Shark]]", and "[[William (The X-Files)|William]]".

However, actress [[Lucy Lawless]] became pregnant shortly after filming the two-part episode, "[[Nothing Important Happened Today]]" and was not available for subsequent episodes.&lt;ref name="Commentary" /&gt; Actress Julia Vera was called in to play the role of the woman who is helping the Smoking Man live in the Anasazi ruins.

The scene was filmed, but was not included in the broadcast version; executive producer Frank Spotnitz later said that he was "so happy" that the producers cut the scene, noting that—despite "a lot of debate about it, on both sides"—the scene was unable to top the final scene with Mulder and Scully.&lt;ref name="deleted scene"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=[[Frank Spotnitz|Spotnitz, Frank]] |year=2002 |title=Deleted Scenes with Optional Commentary by Frank Spotnitz: Scene 77&amp;nbsp;– President Bush |location=''[[The X-Files (season 9)|The X-Files: The Complete Ninth Season]]'' |medium= DVD |publisher=[[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the DVD's audio commentary, the producers mentioned that they had considered filming the shot on the Oval Office set created by ''[[The West Wing]]'', a [[serial (radio and television)|serial]] drama created by [[Aaron Sorkin]] that was originally broadcast on [[NBC]]. In addition, they originally wanted to have [[Martin Sheen]] appear as his character on ''The West Wing'', [[Josiah Bartlet]], instead of Bush, noting that the cameo would have been "a nice, sort of wink" to the television audience.&lt;ref name="deleted scene" /&gt; Despite being cut from the final episode, the shot was featured as a deleted scene on the season nine video release.&lt;ref name="deleted scene" /&gt;

===Filming===
[[File:Fontspoint02262006.JPG|The Anasazi ruins were filmed at [[Anza-Borrego Desert State Park]]|250px|thumb|upright|alt=The shot is of a barren desert environment. There are several canyons, and it is framed against a blue sky.]]
The majority of the episode—like the rest of seasons six, seven, eight and nine—was filmed in [[Los Angeles, California]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fraga|Fraga (2010)]], ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; The first scene, featuring Mulder breaking into a military base, was shot in a hydroelectric power plant east of [[Fresno, California]]. The rooms that were featured in the episode were the main rooms for the power plant that ''The X-Files'' design team redecorated; the crew later called the set the "war room". Most of the decoration and interior scene was done by the visual effect crew; the only visible part seen in real life was a large [[sump pump]]. Bill Roe, the cinematographer for the episode, spent "four or five days lighting [the] set" for filming. [[Kim Manners]] called his work "a great job".&lt;ref name="Commentary" /&gt; The scenes that take place in the main computer terminal room were shot on a [[20th Century Fox]] sound stage, whereas the scenes with Mulder being tortured by the military guards were shot at [[Fort MacArthur]], a former military base in [[San Pedro, California]] that was decommissioned in 1974,&lt;ref name="Commentary"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=[[Kim Manners|Manners, Kim]] |year=2002 |title=Audio Commentary for "The Truth" |location=''[[The X-Files (season 9)|The X-Files: The Complete Ninth Season]]'' DVD |publisher=[[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="location"&gt;Fort MacArthur: {{Coord|33.7120|-118.2962|name=Fort MacArthur|type:landmark_region:GB-CRF}}&lt;/ref&gt; including The Marine Mammal Care Center located at Fort MacArthur.&lt;ref name="fraga"&gt;[[#Fraga|Fraga (2010)]], p. 237–238&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="location"&gt;The Marine Mammal Care Center: {{Coord|33.716915|-118.29649|name=The Marine Mammal Care Center|type:landmark_region:GB-CRF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filming the court room was one of the "most challenging sequences" Manners had ever done.&lt;ref name="Commentary" /&gt; Carter wanted the courtroom to have no spectators and no jury. This meant that Manners had to shoot each scene with a limited amount of actors and make them look "fresh".&lt;ref name="Commentary" /&gt; Manners was terrified to film the 40-page long courtroom scene, pointing out that the show was basically re-telling a nine-year history of ''The X-Files''. Corey Kaplan designed the set.&lt;ref name="Commentary" /&gt;

The Anasazi ruins were constructed in [[Anza-Borrego Desert State Park]].&lt;ref group="location"&gt;Anza-Borrego Desert State Park: {{Coord|33.2565|-116.3991|name=Anza-Borrego Desert State Park|type:landmark_region:GB-CRF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Location manager Mac Gordon later noted that, due to the presence of a rare "spiny black [[Horned lizard|horned toad]]" in the area, he and his crew were forced to hire several biologists to locate any lizards in the area and move them elsewhere. In addition, Gordon had a difficult time persuading the park rangers to build and then blow up faux-ruins. He explained, "we were on a state park property that was an off road park, with motorcycles and [All-terrain vehicles] flying all over the place, but they still blanched when I said we have to build Indian ruins and then blow it up."&lt;ref name="fraga" /&gt; However, the cameo of The Smoking Man was filmed on the [[20th Century Fox]] sound stage. Manners noted that Davis had "a hell of a time" trying to smoke his cigarettes through a hole in his neck, because the hole was "phony".&lt;ref name="Commentary" /&gt; The scene featuring The Smoking Man being burnt up by the fire from a missile was done via computer animation. The missiles were created via CGI technology by animator Mat Beck. The helicopter, however, included real smoke bombs. A shot of William B. Davis was overlapped with fire, and eventually a skull to give the effect that The Smoking Man's flesh was burnt away. Paul Rabwin later called the scene a "great sequence".&lt;ref name="sfx"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=[[Paul Rabwin|Rabwin, Paul]] |year=2002 |title=Special Effects by Mat Beck with Commentary by Paul Rabwin&amp;nbsp;– "CSM Incinerates" |location= ''[[The X-Files (season 9)|The X-Files: The Complete Ninth Season]]'' |medium= DVD |publisher=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Home Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last scene of the episode shot was between Anderson and Duchovny and was called "extremely tough" by Manners, due to it being "very emotional".&lt;ref name="Commentary" /&gt; He noted that the scene "sums up the series" about a "man who believed and a woman who was skeptical but became a believer".&lt;ref name="Commentary" /&gt; The scene was filmed at an actual motel, called La Cresenta. The location had previously been used in episodes "[[Sein Und Zeit (The X-Files)|Sein Und Zeit]]" and "[[This is Not Happening]]".&lt;ref name="fraga" /&gt;

==Analysis==
{{quote box| align  = right| width=28em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|I want to believe that... the dead are not lost to us. That they speak to us... as part of something greater than us—greater than any alien force. And if you and I are powerless now, I want to believe that if we listen to what's speaking, it can give us the power to save ourselves.|source=—Fox Mulder. The line received philosophical attention due to its perceived religious undertones.&lt;ref name=white/&gt;}}
The final scene, featuring a conversation between Mulder and Scully, has been examined by author V. Alan White due to its perceived religious undertones. In the book ''The Philosophy of The X-Files'', he notes that the final scene "undermines Mulder's seemingly persistent scorn of traditional" religion and his subtle acceptance of [[theism]].&lt;ref name="white" /&gt;&lt;ref name="white2"&gt;[[#Philosophy|White (2007)]], p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; In previous episodes—mainly those dealing with Scully's [[Catholicism]]—Mulder shows a lack of approval when it came to the concept of [[organized religion]], often pointing out that "theologians can be just as dogmatic as scientists" when it comes to unexplained phenomena.&lt;ref name="white" /&gt; White proposes that this needling may be intentional on Mulder's part, as a form of "ironic reversal of [Scully's] skepticism about the paranormal".&lt;ref name="white" /&gt; However, the final lines of "The Truth" see Mulder talking about a belief in "something greater than us, greater than any alien force".&lt;ref name="white" /&gt; White also points out the fact that during this scene Mulder grabs Scully's gold cross, an icon that symbolizes her belief through much of the series.&lt;ref name="white"&gt;[[#Philosophy|White (2007)]], p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of the episode's scenes and motifs have been compared to popular myths and legends. Michelle Bush, in her book ''Myth-X'', equated Mulder's overall quest to that of the search for the [[Holy Grail]]. She notes that in "The Truth", Mulder and Scully metaphorically "find their way to the Grail castle" only to discover that the [[Fisher King]]—the wounded knight charged with protecting the secret—is actually The Smoking Man.&lt;ref name="grail"&gt;[[#Bush|Bush (2008)]], p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Bush compared the final scene of the episode—featuring Mulder musing about hope regarding an alien invasion—to the myth of [[Pandora's Box]]. According to legend, the ancient [[List of Greek mythological figures|Greek gods]] gave [[Pandora]] a box filled with evils and told her not to open it. Due to her curiosity, she disobeyed and unleashed various calamities unto the world. Bush argues that the [[Syndicate (The X-Files)|Syndicate]]'s tampering with alien technology—such as their [[alien-human hybrid]] experiments—are similar to the contents of the box. She notes that, in both cases, "man's curiosity is his downfall".&lt;ref name="hope" /&gt; In the end, however, both Pandora's box and the world of ''The X-Files'' contain hope, which, in the legend, was the only thing in the box that Pandora did not let go of.&lt;ref name="hope"&gt;[[#Bush|Bush (2008)]], p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ratings===
"The Truth" was originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network on May&amp;nbsp;19, 2002,&lt;ref name="DVD2"&gt;{{cite DVD notes |title=The X-Files: The Complete Ninth Season |titlelink=The X-Files (season 9) |origyear=2001–02 |others=[[Kim Manners]], et al |type=booklet |publisher=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became the most-watched episode of the ninth season, receiving the season's highest [[Nielsen rating]]s. Nielsen ratings are [[audience measurement]] system that determine the audience size and composition of [[broadcast programming|television programming]] in the United States.

===Reviews===
The entry received mixed reviews by critics; the main reason for criticism was that, instead of creating a conclusion, the episode raised new questions for the audience. [[Robert Shearman]] and [[Lars Pearson]], in their book ''Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium &amp; The Lone Gunmen'', gave the episode a scathing review and awarded it one star out of five.&lt;ref name="shear"&gt;[[#Shearman|Shearman and Pearson (2009)]], pp. 278–280&lt;/ref&gt; The two, despite calling the opening "promising", derided the episode's ending—especially the revelation of alien colonization of December&amp;nbsp;22, 2012—writing, "is this really what the series was about?"&lt;ref name="shear" /&gt; Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson concluded that the problem with the episode was that the show, which he called "brilliant—frequently, truly brilliant" decided "to define itself in the summing up" with the episode, which did not answer very many questions.&lt;ref name="shear" /&gt; [[UGO]] named the episode the fourteenth "Worst Series Finale" and wrote that the episode—and the show's eighth and ninth seasons by extension—were negatively affected by the series' lack of a defining plot line. The article noted that, while the episode claimed to wrap up the story arcs for the series, "the trial of Mulder ultimately resulted in very little satisfying payoff to the series' overarching mysteries".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fitzpatrick |first=Kevin |title=TV's Worst Series Finales |url=http://www.ugo.com/tv/worst-series-finales?page=3 |website=[[UGO Networks]] |publisher=UGO Entertainment |accessdate=June 6, 2012 |date=March 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120411135101/http://www.ugo.com/tv/worst-series-finales?page=3 |archivedate=April 11, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Joyce Millman, writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', after the premiere of "The Truth", said of the show: "The most imaginative show on television has finally reached the limits of its imagination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/10/10/1034061299444.html | title=The Nearly Ex Files|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] | date=October 10, 2002 | accessdate=August 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; M.A. Crang, in his book ''Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11'', was critical of the episode's trial sequences. While he stated that these scenes "do a good job of bringing together the many disparate threads of this arc", he felt that they were "interminably dull".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11|last = Crang|first = M.A.|publisher = Createspace|year = 2015|isbn = 978-1517009038|location = |pages = 152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tom Kessenich, in his book ''Examinations'', wrote a rather positive review of the episode.&lt;ref name=kessreview&gt;[[#Kessenich|Kessenich (2002)]], pp. 195–200&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that, while the episode "told us nothing of significance" regarding the "big picture" mythology story arc, the chance to see Mulder and Scully together one last time resulted in "an exquisite Mulder-Scully moment".&lt;ref name=kessreview/&gt; He was particularly pleased with the final scene, noting that it was an appropriate conclusion; he called it "fitting", as well as "wonderful".&lt;ref name=kessreview/&gt; Kessenich maintained that, were it not for the return of Duchovny, "nobody would have given a damn about the end of this series."&lt;ref name=kessreview/&gt; Julie Salamon of ''[[The New York Times]]'' gave the episode a positive review. Salamon noted that "Until the end, the series maintained its mesmerizing visual gloominess, cleverly punctuated with suggestive plays of color and light".&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; She claimed the show "also retained its conspiracy-theory heart that has appealed so greatly to viewers".&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite web|author=Salamon, Julie |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/21/arts/television-review-scully-and-mulder-reunited-for-the-truth-and-a-kiss.html |title=Scully and Mulder Reunited for the Truth, and a Kiss |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |date=May 21, 2002 |accessdate=November 8, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411122416/http://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/21/arts/television-review-scully-and-mulder-reunited-for-the-truth-and-a-kiss.html |archivedate=April 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; John C. Snider of [[SciFiDimensions]] praised the episode, stating "The Truth is a satisfying conclusion to the series, with plenty of twists and turns, a few surprise guest appearances, and an explosive finale complete with requisite black helicopters. The romantics among us will also be pleased with the culmination of the Mulder/Scully relationship".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scifidimensions.com/May02/xfilesthetruth.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030429053052/http://www.scifidimensions.com/May02/xfilesthetruth.htm|title=Television Review: The X-Files Series Finale "The Truth"|website=[[SciFiDimensions]]|author=Snider, John C.|date=May 2002|archivedate=April 29, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Theatre Royal''' was a theatre in [[Aldershot]] in [[Hampshire]] which opened in 1891 and was demolished in 1959. The teenage [[Charlie Chaplin]] appeared there in 1904 and the actor [[James Mason]] is believed to have made his stage début at the theatre in 1931.&lt;ref name=Sweeney&gt;Sweeney, Kevin. [https://books.google.com/books?id=DVtVA4EajSgC&amp;pg=PA5 ''James Mason: A Bio-bibliography''] Greenwood Press (1999) pg 5 ''[[Google Books]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chaplin in Sherlock Holmes.jpg|thumb|140px|upright|left|A teenage [[Charlie Chaplin]] in the play ''[[Sherlock Holmes (play)|Sherlock Holmes]]'', in which he appeared at the Theatre Royal in 1904]]
Located on the corner of Gordon Road and Birchett Road in Aldershot, the Theatre Royal replaced the Apollo Music Hall which had been on the corner of Union Street and Grosvenor Road in Aldershot from 1856 until it was destroyed by a fire in February 1889&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visitoruk.com/Aldershot/19th-century-T1799.html Timeline History of Aldershot - Welcome to Aldershot website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Howard N. Cole]], ''The Story of Aldershot: a History of the Civil and Military Towns'', [[Gale &amp; Polden]], Aldershot (1951) p151&lt;/ref&gt; during a performance of ''Monte Cristo &amp; Co''. Originally a [[music hall]],&lt;ref&gt;Cole, p303&lt;/ref&gt; the Theatre Royal was regularly visited by touring companies of the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]].&lt;ref&gt;Material in the Glenn Christodoulou Theatre Collection&lt;/ref&gt; From 1887 this theatre was run by Clarence Sounes. The new theatre was designed by the theatre architects [[Bertie Crewe]] and [[W. G. R. Sprague]].&lt;ref name=Lloyd&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/AldershotTheatres/TheatreRoyalAldershot.htm The Theatre Royal on the Arthur Lloyd Music Hall and Theatre History Website]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The singer and comedian [[Arthur Lloyd (musician)|Arthur Lloyd]] appeared at the theatre in a tour of his play ''Ballyvogan'' in 1891. The theatre was extensively rebuilt and remodelled by Sounes and opened on 15 October 1900 as the New Theatre Royal with a production of ''[[The Private Secretary]]''.&lt;ref name=Lloyd/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cole, p151&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charlie Chaplin]], who had made his first stage appearance in Aldershot in 1894 returned to the town in May 1904 as a professional actor to play Billy the Page Boy in a tour of [[William Gillette]]'s play ''[[Sherlock Holmes (play)|Sherlock Holmes]]'', with [[Harry Arthur Saintsbury]] in the title role.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ovzYAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA226&amp;lpg=PA226&amp;dq=theatre+royal+aldershot&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wxu5MVmMSV&amp;sig=3sP5qiDK9w4Xkkqb4TmCOR7OpB8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi228--h_nPAhUhAZoKHYsPB6wQ6AEITDAI#v=onepage&amp;q=theatre%20royal%20aldershot&amp;f=false David Robinson, ''Chaplin: His Life And Art'', [[Penguin Books]] - [[Google Books]]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The aviator [[Samuel Franklin Cody]] was in a box in the theatre in 1912 when, being observed by the audience he was invited to step to the front of the box to talk about the aeroplanes he was developing.&lt;ref&gt;Cole, p174&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8_mxBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=theatre+royal+aldershot&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GcdYQCiDGv&amp;sig=RIM3H7qJJ6MIv9nIft0hSYfOWOo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjs3PX1o_nPAhVGdCwKHR_AB4s4FBDoAQg1MAY#v=onepage&amp;q=theatre%20royal%20aldershot&amp;f=false Murray Rowlands, ''Aldershot in the Great War: The Home of the British Army'', Pen &amp; Sword Military (2015) - [[Google Books]] - p32]&lt;/ref&gt; The English Opera Company appeared here in March 1914 in ''[[The Bohemian Girl]]'', ''[[Il trovatore|Il Trovatore]]'', ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' and ''[[Cavalleria rusticana|Cavalleria Rusticana]]'', among other works.&lt;ref&gt;Playbill for the English Opera Company - March 1914 at the Theatre Royal, Aldershot - Glenn Christodoulou Theatre Collection&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917 the [[curtain raiser]] ''Ida Collaborates'' by [[Noël Coward]] and [[Esmé Wynne-Tyson]] was performed at the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4qJOBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA777&amp;lpg=PA777&amp;dq=theatre+royal+aldershot&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=X9K3cZKmhj&amp;sig=-EloayZrp_SQEWRfHXCeMYc06iM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjxtKHcn_nPAhWmCJoKHacjDng4ChDoAQgwMAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=theatre%20royal%20aldershot&amp;f=false [[Noël Coward]] (Ed.

This new theatre was very small on a small site and could only seat 881 in total, with 197 in the stalls, 220 in the pit, 84 in the Dress Circle, and 350 in the gallery at the rear of the dress circle with its own entrance from Gordon Road. There were two boxes which seated 30 in total on each side at Dress Circle level, with elaborate plasterwork on the dress circle and box fronts. The proscenium opening was 24 feet wide and 26 feet deep with the flies 32 feet high. In addition there were eight dressing rooms, a manager's office  and a band room with the stalls, pit and circle each having its own licensed bar.&lt;ref name=Lloyd/&gt;

From 1925 to 1926 the theatre was owned by local businessman W. A. 'Willie' Rubick (1869-1926)&lt;ref&gt;[http://thejeromefamilyaldershot.co.uk/rubicks4.html 'Willie' Rubick on the Jerome Family History website]&lt;/ref&gt; on whose death the theatre transferred to his widow who sold it in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Catalogue of the sale of the Theatre Royal, Aldershot in 1928 - Jerome Family Museum, Aldershot&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1930s the theatre was owned by Town &amp; Country Theatres who also owned the [[Duchess Theatre]] in London. The actor [[James Mason]] is believed to have made his stage début here in 1931 in ''The Rascal''.&lt;ref name=Sweeney/&gt; However, some sources claim this was at the nearby [[Hippodrome, Aldershot|Hippodrome Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19840728&amp;id=0_89AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fUkMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2052,4920354 James Mason Obituary] ''[[The Glasgow Herald]]'' 28 July 1984 pg 8 – [[Google News]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Theatre Royal went bankrupt in the 1930s and was reopened as a [[Variety show|Variety Theatre]] by Ben Garcia in 1940 who managed it during [[World War II]]. Aldershot being a Garrison Town, much of the audience at this time was male leading to a number of nude revues being held at the theatre. Other acts at this time included [[Todd Slaughter]] in the [[melodrama]] ''[[Jack the Ripper]]'', [[Billy Reid (British songwriter)|Billy Reid]] and his accordion band with [[Dorothy Squires]] as his vocalist, and [[Phyllis Dixey]] in her revue ''Peek A Boo''.&lt;ref name=Lloyd/&gt;

==Decline==
From 1946 to 1948 the Theatre Royal was home to Harry Hanson's Court Players. In the late 1940s, as her film career floundered, [[Jessie Matthews]] ran an amateur theatre group at the theatre. In 1948 Garcia leased the theatre to another management who formed the Aldershot Repertory Company who put on plays there including ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'' in 1950 starring Jessie Matthews until their final production, the [[pantomime]] ''[[Aladdin#Pantomimes|Aladdin]]'' in December 1952. Following this there was a short season of [[repertory theatre]] by the [[Arthur Brough|Arthur Brough Players]] but the theatre again went bankrupt and finally closed. A backstage fire in 1957 lead to great damage and the Theatre Royal was demolished in 1959.&lt;ref name=Lloyd/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vickers/&gt; A block of flats, Matinée House, occupies the site today.

'''''This Is Your Time''''' is [[Michael W. Smith]]'s fourteenth studio album, released on January 12, 1999. All the songs from this album, except "This Is Your Time" and "This Is Your Time (Reprise)", were originally recorded for his previous studio album ''[[Live the Life]]'', but did not make the final cut for the album.&lt;ref name="JFH" /&gt;

== Background ==

The title track was inspired by the initial news report that [[Columbine High School massacre|Columbine shooting]] victim [[Cassie Bernall]] was killed for answering "yes" to the question "Do you believe in God?" Smith co-wrote the song with [[Wes King]], having enlisted his help knowing that he wanted to write about Columbine but did not want to exploit a tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.todayschristianmusic.com/artists/michael-w-smith/features/story-behind-the-song-3/ | title = Story Behind the Song: Michael W. Smith |access-date= December 27, 2014 | last = Parker | first = Mike | publisher = Today's Christian Music}}&lt;/ref&gt; The music video features a short video clip of Bernall talking about her religious beliefs and how she wanted to spread the word of God at the beginning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.godtube.com/watch/?v=7WDDZLNX | title = "This Is Your Time" official music video | accessdate = January 6, 2015 | last = Smith | first = Michael W. | publisher = [[Reunion Records]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Thundersport 500''' is a three-make [[motorcycle racing]] series organised by the UK Club Thundersport Ltd. Until 2009, the series was called the '''Honda CB500 Cup''', before the rules were changed to allow the use of [[Kawasaki ER-5]] and [[Suzuki GS500]] motorcycles. Limited modifications are allowed and many are for safety reasons only. 

== History ==

[[Sébastien Charpentier (motorcycle racer)|Sébastien Charpentier]] dominated the inaugural French CB500 Cup in 1996. The UK series began a year later and was won by [[James Toseland]], whose reward was a contract with the Castrol Honda European Supersport team. Honda France also took Charpentier to the European Supersport championship in 1998.

In 1998 the UK series saw the emergence of [[James Ellison (motorcycle racer)|James Ellison]], who went on to win two [[European Superstock 600 Championship]] titles, a [[British Superbike]] (BSB) [[Privateer (motorsport)|Privateer]] title and World Endurance title, before moving to [[MotoGP]].

Dropped as a British Superbike support class for 2000, the CB500 Cup was picked up by the New Era Motorcycle Club, who ran the class for a further 9 years until the club's closure at the end of 2008.

The French series also still runs to this day.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12215">This page lists the official '''World Champions – Professional Ballroom''' of the '''[[World Dance Council]]''' ('''WDC'''), and its historical predecessors. The championships are authorized and organized under the auspices of the WDC. The designation ''Ballroom'' replaces the previously used ''Modern'' or ''Standard'' in WDC terminology; it does not include the [[latin dances]].

World Championships of a sort have been held in [[ballroom dancing]] since 1909 when Camille de Rhynal held annual championships in [[Paris]]. Records of the years prior to the [[World War I|First World War]] are sketchy, and it is only since 1922 when the sport split into professional and amateur levels that complete records have been kept. The 1922 championships were also the first to award a single 'world championship' as opposed to titles in the individual dances.&lt;ref&gt;Early dates and names verified by Wainwright, Lyndon 1997. ''The story of British popular dance''. International Publications, Brighton. p15&lt;/ref&gt; The World Championships were held in France from 1925 to 1939, in [[Paris]] except for one year in [[Nice]].&lt;ref&gt;Wainwright, Lyndon 1997. ''The story of British popular dance''. International Publications, Brighton. p16&lt;/ref&gt;

These annual competitions only became official in 1936, and since 1937 the title was held by dancers from the [[United Kingdom]] for the rest of that century. With the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], the championships were put on hold for six years. Following its revival, the professional ballroom dancing world was becoming more and more fragmented as competing organizations vied for domination. Finally, in September 1950 the ICBD ([[International Council of Ballroom Dancing]]) was founded, becoming the world's first international professional dance organisation, and all other competitions claiming to be the 'World Championships' were boycotted by member nations.

The Championships returned once again in 1959 under the control of the ICBD, though that year was something of a trial run. The first officially awarded championship of the new series came in 1960, and have continued since then. The ICBD was renamed as the ''World Dance &amp; DanceSport Council'' (WD&amp;DSC), and renamed again as the '''WDC'''.

The '''Professional Ballroom''' section (occasionally called '''Professional Modern''' in British tradition) of [[DanceSport]]) covers the dances [[waltz (International Standard)|waltz]], [[Foxtrot (dance)|foxtrot]], [[quickstep]], [[tango (ballroom)|tango]] and [[Viennese waltz]].

The '''''Yiohan''''' was the name of a ship involved in [[human trafficking]]. It made its way to the coast of [[Sicily]], on the night of December 25, 1996, carrying illegal immigrants from Sri Lanka, India and Pakistan. Its drunken captain Yusuf Al Halal forced over 300 immigrants at gunpoint onto another smaller ship. Survivors claim that he deliberately steered and rammed the much larger ''Yiohan'' into the smaller wooden ship, thereby causing the deaths of 283 people. He was charged with murder, as he did not make any attempt to rescue survivors. The charges against him were however dropped as the incident happened 19 miles away from the Sicilian coast in international waters and didn't fall under Italian jurisdiction. The incident was downplayed and denied until 2001, when a fisherman found an ID card of a drowned Sri Lankan victim and contacted a journalist of newspaper ''[[La Repubblica]]'' in Rome.
