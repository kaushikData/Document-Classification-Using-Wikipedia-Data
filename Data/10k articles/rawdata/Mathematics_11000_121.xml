'''Nine thousand nine-hundred ninety-nine''' ('''9999''') is the [[natural number]] following 9998 and preceding [[10000 (number)|10000]].

9999 is an auspicious number in Chinese folklore. Many estimations of the rooms contained the [[Forbidden City]] point to 9999. Chinese tomb contracts often involved being buried with 9999 coins, relational notion to [[Joss paper]], as it was believed the dead would need that amount to buy the burial plot from the Earth goddess.&lt;ref&gt;Valerie Hansen, ''Negotiating Daily Life in Traditional China: How Ordinary People Used Contracts, 600-1400'' ([[Yale University Press]], [[1995]])&lt;/ref&gt;

9999 is also the [[emergency telephone number]] in [[Oman]].&lt;ref&gt;(http://www.rop.gov.om/english/regionalinfo.asp {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6ASXf1f1T?url=http://www.rop.gov.om/english/regionalinfo.asp |date=2012-09-05 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mathematics ==
 
9999 can be used as a divisor to generate 4-digit decimal recurrences. For example, 1234 / 9999 = 0.123412341234... .

9999 is a [[Kaprekar number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A006886|title=Sloane's A006886 : Kaprekar numbers|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Computer and software ==

9999 was the last possible [[line number]] in some older [[programming languages]] such as [[BASIC]].&lt;ref&gt;

  }}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Often the line "9999 END" was the first line written for a new program.

Some very old software used "9999" as end of file, however no problems occurred September 9, 1999&lt;ref&gt;

'''''Acme Commodity and Phrase Code''''' is a [[codebook]] providing the general-purpose [[Commercial code (communications)|commercial telegraph code]] known as the ''Acme Code''. It was published in 1923 by the Acme Code Company. The book provides a listing of condensed terms and [[codes]] used to shorten [[telegrams]] and save money. The book was extremely popular amongst businesses in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Newton|first=David E.|title=Encyclopedia of Cryptology|year=1997|publisher=Instructional Horizons, Inc|location=Santa Barbara California|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This code was one of the few telegram codes permitted by the Allied powers during the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The ''Acme'' code consists of one hundred thousand five letter codes each intended to stand in for a phrase.
It was designed to be tolerant of [[Transcription_error#Transposition_error|transposition errors]]; the author claims that "no  transposition  of  any  two  adjoining  letters  will
make another word in the book". However, as later discovered by J. Reeds, the code did not provide this level of error correction, containing at least eleven pairs of words differing only by the transposition of two letters.&lt;ref name=Bellovin11&gt;{{cite web

Despite these errors, this code is a precursor to more modern [[Error correction code|error correction codes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''Agent Communication Language''' ('''ACL'''), proposed by the [[Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents]] (FIPA), is a proposed standard language for [[Software agent|agent]] communications.  [[Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language]] (KQML) is another proposed standard.

The most popular ACLs are:

* FIPA-ACL&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Poslad|first=Stefan|title=Specifying Protocols for Multi-agent System Interaction|year=2007|journal=ACM Transactions on Autonomous and Adaptive Systems|volume=4|issue=4|doi=10.1145/1293731.1293735}}&lt;/ref&gt; (by the [[Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents]], a standardization consortium)
* [[KQML]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Finin|first=Tim|author2= Richard Fritzson, Don McKay and Robin McEntire |title=KQML as an agent communication language|year=1994|conference=Proceedings of the third international conference on Information and knowledge management, CIKM '94 |pages= 456–463}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language)

Both rely on [[speech act]] theory developed by [[John Searle|Searle]] in the 1960s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Searle|first=J.R.|year=1969|title=Speech Acts|publisher=Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; and enhanced by [[Terry Winograd|Winograd]] and [[Fernando Flores|Flores]] in the 1970s. They define a set of [[Performative utterance|performatives]], also called Communicative Acts, and their meaning (e.g. ask-one). The content of the performative is not standardized, but varies from system to system.

To make agents understand each other they have to not only speak the same language, but also have a common [[Ontology (computer science)|ontology]]. An ontology is a part of the agent's knowledge base that describes what kind of things an agent can deal with and how they are related to each other.

Examples of frameworks that implement a standard agent communication language (FIPA-ACL) include FIPA-OS&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last=Poslad|first=Stefan|author2=Philip Buckle and Robert Hadingham|title=The FIPA-OS agent platform: Open Source for Open Standards|year=2000|conference=Proceedings of 5th International Conference on the Practical Application Of Intelligent Agents And Multi-Agent Technology (PAAM)|pages=355–368}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Poslad|first= S|author2=Buckle P, Hadingham R.G|title=Open Source, Standards and Scaleable Agencies|journal=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|year= 2001|volume=1887|pages=296–303|DOI=10.1007/3-540-47772-1_30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and [[Java Agent Development Framework|Jade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last=Bellifeminee|first=Fabio|author2=Agostino Poggi and Giovanni Rimassa|title=JADE: a FIPA2000 compliant agent development environment|year=2001|conference=Proceedings of the fifth international conference on Autonomous agents|pages=216–217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Antoni Malet''' (born 23 February 1950) is a Catalan historian of mathematics. He is a professor of [[history of science]] at [[Pompeu Fabra University]], [[Barcelona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathunion.org/o/Organization/GA/GA-Santiago/candidatesCV/ICHM/ICHMMalet.pdf |format=PDF |title=Antoni Malet : CV |publisher=Mathunion.org |accessdate=2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; His research interests are mostly in the history of [[mathematics]] and [[optics]] in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://iris.unipa.it/retrieve/handle/10447/64768/45267/Ando.pdf|format=PDF|author=Paula Olmos|title=''Greek Science in the Long Run: Essays on the Greek Scientific Tradition (4th c.

Malet earned his Ph.D. in 1989 from [[Princeton University]] as a student of [[Charles Coulston Gillispie|Charles Gillispie]], with the thesis ''Studies on [[James Gregory (mathematician)|James Gregorie]] (1638–1675)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=18880 |title=The Mathematics Genealogy Project - Antoni Malet |publisher=Genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4217">In [[mathematical logic]], an '''axiom schema''' (plural: '''axiom schemata''' or '''axiom schemas''') generalizes the notion of [[axiom]].

==Formal definition==
An axiom schema is a [[well-formed formula|formula]] in the [[metalanguage]] of an [[axiomatic system]], in which one or more [[schematic variable]]s appear. These variables, which are metalinguistic constructs, stand for any [[First-order logic#Formation rules|term]] or [[first-order logic|subformula]] of the system, which may or may not be required to satisfy certain conditions. Often, such conditions require that certain variables be [[free variable|free]], or that certain variables not appear in the subformula or term{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}.

==Finite axiomatization==
Given that the number of possible subformulas or terms that can be inserted in place of a schematic variable is [[countably infinite]], an axiom schema stands for a countably infinite set of axioms. This set can usually be [[recursive definition|defined recursively]]. A theory that can be axiomatized without schemata is said to be ''finitely axiomatized''. Theories that can be finitely axiomatized are seen as a bit more metamathematically elegant, even if they are less practical for deductive work.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Examples==
Two very well known instances of axiom schemata are the:
* [[mathematical induction|induction]] schema that is part of [[Peano's axioms]] for the arithmetic of the [[natural number]]s;
* [[axiom schema of replacement]] that is part of the standard [[ZFC]] axiomatization of [[set theory]].
[[Czesław Ryll-Nardzewski]] proved that Peano arithmetic cannot be finitely axiomatized and [[Richard Montague]] proved that ZFC cannot be finitely axiomatized.&lt;ref&gt;Czesław Ryll-Nardzewski 1952; Richard Montague 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the axiom schemata cannot be eliminated from these theories. This is also the case for quite a few other axiomatic theories in mathematics, philosophy, linguistics, etc.

==Finitely axiomatized theories==
All theorems of [[ZFC]] are also theorems of [[von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]], but the latter can be finitely axiomatized. The set theory [[New Foundations]] can be finitely axiomatized, but only with some loss of elegance.

==In higher-order logic==
Schematic variables in [[first-order logic]] are usually trivially eliminable in [[second-order logic]], because a schematic variable is often a placeholder for any [[property]] or [[relation (mathematics)|relation]] over the individuals of the theory. This is the case with the schemata of ''Induction'' and ''Replacement'' mentioned above. Higher-order logic allows quantified variables to range over all possible properties or relations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4337">In [[mathematics]], '''Bochner spaces''' are a generalization of the concept of [[Lp space|''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' spaces]] to functions whose values lie in a [[Banach space]] which is not necessarily the space R or C of real or complex numbers.

The space ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;(X)'' consists of (equivalence classes of) all [[Bochner measurable]] functions ''f'' with values in the Banach space ''X'' whose [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] ''||f||&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;'' lies in the standard ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' space. Thus, if ''X'' is the set of complex numbers, it is the standard Lebesgue ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' space.

Almost all standard results on ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' spaces do hold on Bochner spaces too; in particular, the Bochner spaces ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;(X)'' are Banach spaces for &lt;math&gt;1\le p\le \infty&lt;/math&gt;.

==Background==
Bochner spaces are named for the [[Poland|Polish]]-[[United States|American]] [[mathematician]] [[Salomon Bochner]].

==Applications==
Bochner spaces are often used in the [[functional analysis]] approach to the study of [[partial differential equation]]s that depend on time, e.g. the [[heat equation]]: if the temperature &lt;math&gt;g(t,x)&lt;/math&gt; is a scalar function of time and space, one can write &lt;math&gt;(f(t))(x):=g(t,x)&lt;/math&gt; to make ''f'' a family ''f(t)'' (parametrized by time) of functions of space, possibly in some Bochner space.

==Definition==
Given a [[measure space]] (''T'',&amp;nbsp;Σ,&amp;nbsp;''μ''), a [[Banach space]] (''X'',&amp;nbsp;||&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;||&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;) and 1&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;+∞, the '''Bochner space''' ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;(''T'';&amp;nbsp;''X'') is defined to be the [[Kolmogorov quotient]] (by equality [[almost everywhere]]) of the space of all [[Bochner measurable]] functions ''u''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''T''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''X'' such that the corresponding norm is finite:

:&lt;math&gt;\| u \|_{L^{p} (T; X)} := \left( \int_{T} \| u(t) \|_{X}^{p} \, \mathrm{d} \mu (t) \right)^{1/p} &lt; + \infty \mbox{ for } 1 \leq p &lt; \infty,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\| u \|_{L^{\infty} (T; X)} := \mathrm{ess\,sup}_{t \in T} \| u(t) \|_{X} &lt; + \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, as is usual in the study of ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; spaces, ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;(''T'';&amp;nbsp;''X'') is a space of [[equivalence class]]es of functions, where two functions are defined to be equivalent if they are equal everywhere except upon a ''μ''-[[measure zero]] subset of ''T''. As is also usual in the study of such spaces, it is usual to [[abuse of notation|abuse notation]] and speak of a "function" in ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;(''T'';&amp;nbsp;''X'') rather than an equivalence class (which would be more technically correct).

==Application to PDE theory==
Very often, the space ''T'' is an [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]] of time over which we wish to solve some partial differential equation, and ''μ'' will be one-dimensional [[Lebesgue measure]]. The idea is to regard a function of time and space as a collection of functions of space, this collection being parametrized by time. For example, in the solution of the heat equation on a region Ω in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; and an interval of time [0, ''T''], one seeks solutions
:&lt;math&gt;u \in L^{2} \left( [0, T]; H_{0}^{1} (\Omega) \right)&lt;/math&gt;
with time derivative
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} \in L^{2} \left( [0, T]; H^{- 1} (\Omega) \right).&lt;/math&gt;
Here &lt;math&gt;H_{0}^{1} (\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Sobolev space|Sobolev]] [[Hilbert space]] of once-[[weak derivative|weakly differentiable]] functions with first weak derivative in ''L''²(Ω) that vanish at the [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] of Ω (in the sense of trace, or, equivalently, are limits of smooth functions with [[compact space|compact]] [[support (mathematics)|support]] in Ω); &lt;math&gt;H^{-1} (\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[dual space]] of &lt;math&gt;H_{0}^{1} (\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;.

(The "[[partial derivative]]" with respect to time ''t'' above is actually a [[total derivative]], since the use of Bochner spaces removes the space-dependence.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2586">'''Column generation''' or '''delayed column generation''' is an efficient algorithm for solving larger [[linear programming|linear programs]].

The overarching idea is that many linear programs are too large to consider all the variables explicitly.  Since most of the variables will be non-basic and assume a value of zero in the optimal solution, only a subset of variables need to be considered in theory when solving the problem.  Column generation leverages this idea to generate only the variables which have the potential to improve the [[Optimization (mathematics)|objective function]]—that is, to find variables with negative [[reduced cost]] (assuming [[without loss of generality]] that the problem is a minimization problem).

The problem being solved is split into two problems: the master problem and the subproblem.  The master problem is the original problem with only a subset of variables being considered.  The subproblem is a new problem created to identify a new variable.  The objective function of the subproblem is the reduced cost of the new variable with respect to the current dual variables, and the constraints require that the variable obeys the naturally occurring constraints.

The process works as follows.  The master problem is solved—from this solution, we are able to obtain dual prices for each of the constraints in the master problem.  This information is then utilized in the objective function of the subproblem.  The subproblem is solved.  If the objective value of the subproblem is negative, a variable with negative reduced cost has been identified.  This variable is then added to the master problem, and the master problem is re-solved.  Re-solving the master problem will generate a new set of dual values, and the process is repeated until no negative reduced cost variables are identified.  The subproblem returns a solution with non-negative reduced cost, we can conclude that the solution to the master problem is optimal.  

In many cases, this allows large linear programs that had been previously considered intractable to be solved.  The classical example of a problem where this is successfully used is the [[cutting stock problem]]. One particular technique in linear programming which uses this kind of approach is the [[Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition]] algorithm.  Additionally, column generation has been applied to many problems such as [[crew scheduling]], [[vehicle routing]], and the [[capacitated p-median problem]].

[[File:Stationary vs inflection pts.svg|400px|thumb|right|The [[abscissae]] ("x-coordinates") of the red circles are stationary points; the blue squares are [[inflection point]]s.]]
In [[mathematics]], a '''critical point''' or '''stationary point''' of a [[differentiable function]] of a [[Function of a real variable|real]] or [[complex variable]] is any value in its [[domain of a function|domain]] where its [[derivative]] is 0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Stewart | first=James | authorlink=James Stewart (mathematician) | title=Calculus: Early Transcendentals |publisher=[[Brooks/Cole]] | edition=6th | year=2008 | isbn=0-495-01166-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Larson | first1=Ron | authorlink=Ron Larson (mathematician)| last2=Edwards | first2=Bruce H. | title=Calculus | publisher=[[Brooks/Cole]] | edition=9th | year=2009 | isbn=0-547-16702-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some authors also classify as critical points any limit points where the function may be {{clarify|text=prolongated by continuity|date=August 2018}} or where the derivative is not defined. For a differentiable [[function of several real variables]], a '''critical point''' is a value in its domain where all [[partial derivative]]s are zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Adams |first= Robert A. |last2= Essex |first2= Christopher |title= Calculus: A Complete Course |publisher= [[Pearson Prentice Hall]] |year= 2009 |isbn= 978-0-321-54928-0 |page=744}}&lt;/ref&gt; The value of the function at a critical point is a '''critical value'''.

The interest of this notion lies in the fact that the points where the function has [[local extremum|local extrema]] are critical points.

This definition extends to [[differentiable map]]s between '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; and '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, a '''critical point''' being, in this case, a point where the [[rank of a matrix|rank]] of the [[Jacobian matrix]] is not maximal. It extends further to differentiable maps between [[differentiable manifold]]s, as the points where the rank of the Jacobian matrix decreases. In this case, critical points are also called ''[[bifurcation point]]s''.

In particular, if ''C'' is a [[plane curve]], defined by an [[implicit equation]] ''f''(''x'',''y'') = 0, the critical points of the projection onto the ''x''-axis, parallel to the ''y''-axis are the points where the tangent to ''C'' are parallel to the ''y''-axis, that is the points where &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(x,y)=0.&lt;/math&gt; In other words, the critical points are those where the [[implicit function theorem]] does not apply.

The notion of a ''critical point'' allows the mathematical description of an [[astronomy|astronomical]] phenomenon that was unexplained before the time of [[Copernicus]]. A '''stationary point''' in the orbit of a planet is a point of the trajectory of the planet on the [[celestial sphere]], where the motion of the planet seems to stop before restarting in the other direction. This occurs because of a critical point of the projection of the orbit into the [[ecliptic circle]].

==Critical point of a single variable function==
A '''critical point''' or '''stationary point''' of a [[differentiable function]] of a single [[Function of a real variable|real variable]], ''f''(''x''), is a value ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in the [[domain of a function|domain]] of ''f'' where its [[derivative]] is 0: ''f'' ′(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) = 0. A '''critical value''' is the image under ''f'' of a critical point. These concepts may be visualized through the [[graph of a function|graph]] of ''f'': at a critical point, the graph has a horizontal [[tangent]] and the derivative of the function is zero.

Although it is easily visualized on the graph (which is a curve), the notion of critical point of a function must not be confused with the notion of critical point, in some direction, of a [[curve (mathematics)|curve]] (see [[#Critical points of an implicit curve|below]] for a detailed definition). If ''g''(''x'',''y'') is a differentiable [[function of several real variables|function]] of two variables, then ''g''(''x'',''y'') = 0 is the [[implicit equation]] of a curve. A '''critical point''' of such a curve, for the projection parallel to the ''y''-axis (the map (''x'', ''y'') → ''x''), is a point of the curve  where &lt;math&gt;\frac {\partial g}{\partial y}(x,y)=0.&lt;/math&gt; This means that the tangent of the curve is parallel to the ''y''-axis, and that, at this point, ''g'' does not define an implicit function from ''x'' to ''y'' (see [[implicit function theorem]]). If (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) is such a critical point, then ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the corresponding '''critical value'''. Such a critical point is also called a '''[[bifurcation point]]''', as, generally, when ''x'' varies, there are two branches of the curve on a side of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and zero on the other side.

It follows from these definitions that the function ''f''(''x'') has a critical point ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; with critical value ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, if and only if (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) is a critical point of its graph for the projection parallel to the ''x''-axis, with the same critical value ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

For example, the critical points of the [[unit circle]] of equation ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - 1 = 0 are (0, 1) and (0, -1) for the projection parallel to the ''y''-axis, and (1, 0) and (-1, 0) for the direction parallel to the ''x''-axis. If one considers the upper half circle as the graph of the function &lt;math&gt;f(x)= \sqrt{1-x^2}, &lt;/math&gt; then ''x'' = 0 is the unique critical point, with critical value 1. The critical points of the circle for the projection parallel to the ''y''-axis correspond exactly to the points where the derivative of ''f'' is not defined.

Some authors define the '''critical points''' of a function ''f'' as the ''x''-values for which the graph has a critical point for the projection parallel to either axis. In the above example of the upper half circle, the critical points for this enlarged definition are -1, 0 and -1. Such a definition appears, usually, only in elementary textbooks, when the critical points are defined before any definition of other curves than graphs of functions, and when functions of several variables are not considered (the enlarged definition does not extend to this case).

===Examples===
* The function ''f''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 2''x'' + 3 is differentiable everywhere, with the derivative ''f'' ′(''x'') = 2''x'' + 2. This function has a unique critical point −1, because it is the unique number ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; for which 2''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 = 0. This point is a [[global minimum]] of ''f''. The corresponding critical value is ''f''(−1) = 2. The graph of ''f'' is a concave up [[parabola]], the critical point is the abscissa of the vertex, where the tangent line is horizontal, and the critical value is the ordinate of the vertex and may be represented by the intersection of this tangent line and the ''y''-axis.
* The function ''f''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2/3&lt;/sup&gt; is defined for all ''x'' and differentiable for ''x'' ≠ 0, with the derivative ''f'' ′(''x'') = 2''x''&lt;sup&gt;−1/3&lt;/sup&gt;/3. Since ''f'' ′(''x'') ≠ 0 for ''x'' ≠ 0, the only possible critical point of ''f'' is ''x'' = 0. As the derivative does not exist at 0, it depends on the authors whether this point is considered as a critical point, or not. The graph of the function ''f'' has a [[cusp (singularity)|cusp]] at this point with vertical tangent. The corresponding critical value is ''f''(0) = 0.
* The function ''f''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; − 3''x'' + 1 is differentiable everywhere, with the derivative ''f'' ′(''x'') = 3''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − 3. It has two critical points, at ''x'' = −1 and ''x'' = 1. The corresponding critical values are ''f''(−1) = 3, which is a local maximum value, and ''f''(1) = −1, which is a local minimum value of ''f''. This function has no global maximum or minimum. Since ''f''(2) = 3, we see that a critical value may also be attained at a non-critical point. Geometrically, this means that a horizontal tangent line to the graph at one point (''x'' = −1) may intersect the graph at an acute angle at another point (''x'' = 2).
* The function ''f''(''x'') = 1/''x'' has no critical points. The point x = 0 is not considered as a critical point because it is not included in the function's domain.

===Location of critical points===
By the [[Gauss-Lucas theorem]], all of a polynomial function's critical points in the [[complex plane]] are within the [[convex hull]] of the [[zero of a function|roots]] of the function. Thus for a polynomial function with only real roots, all critical points are real and are between the greatest and smallest roots.

[[Sendov's conjecture]] asserts that, if all of a function's roots lie in the [[unit disk]] in the complex plane, then there is at least one critical point within unit distance of any given root.

==Critical points of an implicit curve==
{{See also|Algebraic curve}}
Critical points play an important role in the study of [[plane curve]]s defined by [[implicit equation]]s, in particular for [[curve sketching|sketching]] them and determining their [[topology]]. The notion of critical point that is used in this section, may seem different from that of previous section. In fact it is the specialization to a simple case of the general notion of critical point given [[#Critical point of a differential map|below]].

Thus, we consider a curve {{math|''C''}} defined by an implicit equation &lt;math&gt;f(x,y)=0,&lt;/math&gt; where {{math|''f''}} is a [[differentiable function]] of two variables, commonly a [[Polynomial#Number of variables|bivariate polynomial]]. The points of the curve are the points of the [[Euclidean plane]] whose [[Cartesian coordinates]] satisfy the equation. There are two standard [[projection (mathematics)|projections]] &lt;math&gt;\pi_y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\pi_x&lt;/math&gt;, defined by &lt;math&gt;\pi_y ((x,y))=x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\pi_x ((x,y))=y,&lt;/math&gt; that map the curve onto the [[coordinate axes]]. They are called the ''projection parallel to the y-axis'' and the ''projection parallel to the x-axis'', respectively.

A point of {{math|''C''}} is '''critical for''' &lt;math&gt;\pi_y&lt;/math&gt;, if the [[tangent]] to {{math|''C''}} exists and is parallel to the ''y''-axis. In that case, the [[image (mathematics)|image]]s by &lt;math&gt;\pi_y&lt;/math&gt; of the critical point and of the tangent are the same point of the ''x''-axis, called the '''critical value'''. Thus a point is critical for &lt;math&gt;\pi_y&lt;/math&gt; if its coordinates are solution of the [[system of equations]]

:&lt;math&gt;f(x,y)=\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(x,y)=0.&lt;/math&gt;

This implies that this definition is a special case of the general definition of a critical point, which is given [[#Critical point of a differential map|below]].

The definition of a critical point for &lt;math&gt;\pi_x&lt;/math&gt; is similar. If {{math|''C''}} is the [[graph of a function]] &lt;math&gt;y=f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, then {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} is critical for &lt;math&gt;\pi_x&lt;/math&gt; if and only if {{math|''x''}} is a critical point of {{math|''f''}}, and that the critical values are the same.

Some authors define the '''critical points''' of {{math|''C''}} as the points that are critical for either &lt;math&gt;\pi_x&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\pi_y&lt;/math&gt;, although they depend not only on {{math|''C''}}, but also on the choice of the coordinate axes. It depends also on the authors if the [[singular point of a curve|singular points]] are considered as critical points. In fact the singular points are the points that satisfy

:&lt;math&gt;f(x,y)=\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x,y)=\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(x,y)=0&lt;/math&gt;,

and are thus solutions of either system of equations characterizing the critical points. With this more general definition, the critical points for &lt;math&gt;\pi_y&lt;/math&gt; are exactly the points where the [[implicit function theorem]] does not apply.

===Use of the discriminant===
When the curve {{math|''C''}} is algebraic, that is when it is defined by a bivariate polynomial {{math|''f''}}, then the [[discriminant]] is a useful tool to compute the critical points.

Here we consider only the projection &lt;math&gt;\pi_y;&lt;/math&gt; Similar results apply to &lt;math&gt;\pi_x&lt;/math&gt; by exchanging {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}}.

Let
&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Disc}_y(f)&lt;/math&gt;
be the [[discriminant]] of {{math|''f''}} viewed as a polynomial in {{math|''y''}} with coefficients that are polynomials in {{math|''x''}}. This discriminant is thus a polynomial in {{math|''x''}} which has the critical values of &lt;math&gt;\pi_y&lt;/math&gt; among its roots.

More precisely, a simple root of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Disc}_y(f)&lt;/math&gt; is either a critical value of &lt;math&gt;\pi_y&lt;/math&gt; such the corresponding critical point is a point which is not singular nor an inflection point, or the {{math|''x''}}-coordinate of an [[asymptote]] which is parallel to the {{math|''y''}}-axis and is tangent "at infinity" to an [[inflection point]] (inflexion asymptote).

A multiple root of the discriminant correspond either to several critical points or inflection asymptotes sharing the same critical value, or to a critical point which is also an inflection point, or to a singular point.

==Several variables==
For a continuously differentiable [[function of several real variables]], a point ''P'' (that is a set of values for the input variables, which is viewed as a point in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;) is '''critical''' if all of the [[partial derivative]]s of the function are zero at ''P'', or, equivalently, if its [[gradient]] is zero. The critical values are the values of the function at the critical points.

If the function is [[smooth function|smooth]], or, at least twice continuously differentiable, a critical point may be either a [[local maximum]], a [[local minimum]] or a [[saddle point]]. The different cases may be distinguished by considering the [[eigenvalue]]s of the [[Hessian matrix]] of second derivatives.

A critical point at which the Hessian matrix is [[nonsingular matrix|nonsingular]] is said to be ''nondegenerate'', and the signs of the [[eigenvalue]]s of the Hessian determine the local behavior of the function.  In the case of a function of a single variable, the Hessian is simply the [[second derivative]], viewed as a 1×1-matrix, which is nonsingular if and only if it is not zero.  In this case, a non-degenerate critical point is a local maximum or a local minimum, depending on the sign of the second derivative, which is positive for a local minimum and negative for a local maximum. If the second derivative is null, the critical point is generally an [[inflection point]], but may also be an [[undulation point]], which may be a local minimum or a local maximum.

For a function of ''n'' variables, the number of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix at a critical point is called the ''index'' of the critical point. A non-degenerate critical point is a local maximum if and only if the index is ''n'', or, equivalently, if the Hessian matrix is [[Negative-definite matrix|negative definite]]; it is a local minimum if the index is zero, or, equivalently, if the Hessian matrix is [[Positive-definite matrix|positive definite]]. For the other values of the index, a non-degenerate critical point is a [[saddle point]], that is a point which is a maximum in some directions and a minimum in others.

===Application to optimization===
{{Main|Mathematical optimization}}

By [[Fermat's theorem (stationary points)|Fermat's theorem]], all local [[maxima and minima]] of a differentiable function occur at critical points. Therefore, to find the local maxima and minima, it suffices, theoretically, to compute the zeros of the gradient and the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix at these zeros. This does not work well in practice because it requires the solution of a [[nonlinear system]] of [[simultaneous equations]], which is a difficult task.
The usual [[numerical algorithm]]s are much more efficient for finding local extrema, but cannot certify that all extrema have been found.
In particular, in [[global optimization]], these methods cannot certify that the output is really the global optimum.

When the function to minimize is a [[multivariate polynomial]], the critical points and the critical values are solutions of a [[system of polynomial equations]], and modern algorithms for solving such systems provide competitive certified methods for finding the global minimum.

==Critical point of a differentiable map==
Given a differentiable map ''f'' from '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; into '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, the '''critical points''' of ''f'' are the points of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;, where the rank of the [[Jacobian matrix]] of ''f'' is not maximal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carmo |first=Manfredo Perdigão do |title=Differential geometry of curves and surfaces |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |publisher=Prentice-Hall |year=1976 |isbn=0-13-212589-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The image of a critical point under ''f'' is a called a [[critical value]].  A point in the complement of the set of critical values is called a '''regular value'''.  [[Sard's theorem]] states that the set of critical values of a smooth map has [[measure zero]]. In particular, if ''n'' = 1, there is a finite number of critical values in each bounded interval.

Some authors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lafontaine |first=Jacques |title=An Introduction to Differential Manifolds  |publisher=Springer International Publishing|year=2015 |isbn=978-3-319-20734-6|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-20735-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; give a slightly different definition: a '''critical point''' of ''f'' is a point of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; where the rank of the [[Jacobian matrix]] of ''f'' is less than ''n''. With this convention, all points are critical when ''m'' &lt; ''n''.

These definitions extend to differential maps between [[differentiable manifold]]s in the following way. Let &lt;math&gt;f:V\rightarrow W&lt;/math&gt; be a differential map between two manifolds {{math|''V''}} and {{math|''W''}} of respective dimensions ''m'' and ''n''. In the neighborhood of a point {{math|''p''}} of {{math|''V''}} and of {{math|''f''(''p'')}}, [[Manifold#Charts|charts]] are [[diffeomorphism]]s &lt;math&gt;\varphi : V \rightarrow \mathbf{R}^m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi : W \rightarrow \mathbf{R}^n.&lt;/math&gt; The point {{math|''p''}} is '''critical''' for {{math|''f''}} if &lt;math&gt;\varphi(p)&lt;/math&gt; is critical for &lt;math&gt;\psi \circ f \circ \varphi^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt; This definition does not depend on the choice of the charts because the transitions maps being diffeomorphisms, their Jacobian matrices are invertible and multiplying by them does not modify the rank of the Jacobian matrix of &lt;math&gt;\psi \circ f \circ \varphi^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt; If ''M'' is a Hilbert manifold (not necessarily finite dimensional) and ''f'' is a real-valued function then we say that ''p'' is a critical point of ''f'' if ''f'' is ''not'' a [[submersion (mathematics)|submersion]] at ''p''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Serge Lang]], Fundamentals of Differential Geometry p. 186,{{doi|10.1007/978-1-4612-0541-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application to topology==
Critical points are fundamental for studying the [[topology]] of [[manifold]]s and [[real algebraic geometry|real algebraic varieties]]. In particular, they are the basic tool for [[Morse theory]] and [[catastrophe theory]].

The link between critical points and topology already appears at a lower level of abstraction. For example, let &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; be a sub-manifold of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^n,&lt;/math&gt; and {{math|P}} be a point outside &lt;math&gt;V.&lt;/math&gt; The square of the distance to {{math|P}} of a point of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is a differential map such that each connected component of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; contains at least a critical point, where the distance is minimal. It follows that the number of connected components of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is bounded above by the number of critical points.

In the case of real algebraic varieties, this observation associated with [[Bézout's theorem]] allows us to bound the number of connected components by a function of the degrees of the polynomials that define the variety.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6244">'''Cybertext''' is the organization of text in order to analyze the influence of the [[Artistic medium|medium]] as an integral part of the [[literary]] dynamic, as defined by [[Espen Aarseth]] in 1997. Aarseth defined it as a type of [[ergodic literature]].

==Definition==
The term cybertext was coined by [[speculative fiction]] poetry author [[Bruce Boston]].  It is derived from the word [[cybernetics]], which was [[Neologism|coined]] by [[Norbert Wiener]] in his book ''Cybernetics, or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine'' (1948), which in turn comes from the Greek word ''kybernetes'' – [[helmsman]].&lt;ref name=espen1997&gt;{{cite book|author=Aarseth, Espen|year=1997|title=Ergodic Literature|publisher=Baltimore, Maryland: The Johns Hopkins University Press|isbn=0-8018-5579-9 |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=qx_-zj0-TwoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=isbn:0801855799&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;!-- previous url http://www.hf.uib.no/cybertext/Ergodic.html dead--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Cybertexts are pieces of literature where the medium matters. Each user obtains a different outcome based on the choices they make. Cybertexts may be equated to the transition between a [[linear]] piece of literature, such as a [[novel]], and a [[game]]. In a novel, the reader has no choice, the [[plot (narrative)|plot]] and the characters are all chosen by the author, there is no 'user', just a 'reader', this is important because it entails that the person working their way through the novel is not an active participant. In a game, the person makes decisions and decides what to do, what punches to punch, or when to jump. The difference between a game and a cybertext is that cybertexts usually have more depth, there is a method to the madness, the piece usually has a point, or message that is translated to the reader as they work their way through the piece.

==Overview==
Cybertext is based on the idea that getting to the message is just as important as the message itself. In order to obtain the message work on the part of the user is required. This may also be referred to as nontrivial work on the part of the user.&lt;ref name=espen1997/&gt;

The fundamental idea in the development of the theory of cybernetics is the concept of [[feedback]]: a portion of [[information]] produced by the system that is taken, total or partially, as input. Cybernetics is the science that studies control and regulation in systems in which there exists flow and feedback of information. Though first used by [[science fiction]] poet [[Bruce Boston]], the term cybertext was brought to the [[Literature|literary]] world's attention by [[Espen Aarseth]] in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Eskelinen, Markuu and Koskimaa, Raine,(January, 2010) Retrieved from Cybertext Yearbook Database website: http://cybertext.hum.jyu.fi/search.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Aarseth's concept of cybertext focuses on the organization of the text in order to analyze the influence of the [[Artistic medium|medium]] as an integral part of the literary dynamic. According to Aarseth, cybertext is not a [[genre]] in itself; in order to classify traditions, [[literary genres]] and [[aesthetic value]], we should inspect [[Plain text|texts]] at a much more local level.&lt;ref&gt;Bolter,Jay David, Degrees of Freedom, retrieved from http://www.uv.es/~fores/programa/bolter_freedom.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application ==
The concept of cybertext offers a way to expand the reach of [[Literary criticism|literary studies]] to include phenomena that are perceived today as foreign or marginal.&lt;ref name=espen1997/&gt; In Aarseth's work, cybertext denotes the general set of text machines which, operated by readers, yield different texts for reading.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenburg, Jim. Article on: Navigating Nowhere / Hypertext Infrawhere retrieved from:  http://www.well.com/user/jer/NNHI.html&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, with a book like  [[Raymond Queneau]]'s ''[[Hundred Thousand Billion Poems]]'', each reader will encounter not just [[Poetry|poems]] arranged in a different order, but ''different poems'' depending on the precise way in which they turn the sections of page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Queneau's Poems|url=http://www.bevrowe.info/Queneau/QueneauHome_v2.html|accessdate=2016-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
An example of a cybertext is ''12 Blue'' by [[Michael Joyce (writer)|Michael Joyce]]. Depending on what link you choose or what portion of the [[diagram]] on the side you pick you will be transferred to a different portion of the text. So in the end, you do not really finish reading the entire story or 'novel' you go through random pages and try piecing the story together yourself. You may never really 'finish' the story. But, because it is a cybertext the 'finishing' of the story is not as important as its impact on the reader, or on the conveyance.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce,Michael. ''12 Blue'' Retrieved from: http://collection.eliterature.org/1/works/joyce__twelve_blue.html&lt;/ref&gt; ''Stir Fry Texts'', by Jim Andrews, is a cybertext where there are many layers of text, and as you move your mouse over the words, the layers beneath them are 'dug' through.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews,Jim. Article on Stir Fry Texts retrieved from: http://collection.eliterature.org/1/works/andrews__stir_fry_texts/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;
''The House'' is another example of a cybertext where one might assume a description of the piece as follows:
It is an unruly text, the words don't listen, you are not supreme. You are guided through the piece. This is a cybertext with minimal control. You watch as something unfolds before you, "a crumbling mania", you must be able to go with the flow, to read texts upside down, to piece together a reflection of words, to be okay with texts half read disappearing or moving so far away so continuously that you can not make out those very important words.&lt;ref&gt;Flanagan, Mary. The House, retrieved from: http://collection.eliterature.org/1/works/flanagan__thehouse/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Calculus|expanded=Specialized calculi}}

In [[fractional calculus]], an area of [[applied mathematics]], the '''differintegral''' is a combined  [[Differential operator|differentiation]]/[[integral operator|integration]] operator. Applied to a [[function (mathematics)|function]] ƒ, the ''q''-differintegral of ''f'', here denoted by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{D}^qf&lt;/math&gt;
is the fractional derivative (if ''q'' &gt; 0) or fractional integral (if ''q'' &lt; 0).  If ''q'' = 0, then the ''q''-th differintegral of a function is the function itself.  In the context of fractional integration and differentiation, there are several legitimate definitions of the differintegral.

==Standard definitions==

The three most common forms are:

*The [[Riemann–Liouville differintegral]]
:This is the simplest and easiest to use, and consequently it is the most often used. It is a generalization of the [[Cauchy formula for repeated integration]] to arbitrary order. Here, &lt;math&gt;n = \lceil q \rceil&lt;/math&gt;.
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
{}_a\mathbb{D}^q_tf(t) &amp; = \frac{d^qf(t)}{d(t-a)^q} \\
&amp; =\frac{1}{\Gamma(n-q)} \frac{d^n}{dt^n} \int_{a}^t (t-\tau)^{n-q-1}f(\tau)d\tau
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;




*The [[Grunwald–Letnikov differintegral]]
:The Grunwald–Letnikov differintegral is a direct generalization of the definition of a [[derivative]].  It is more difficult to use than the Riemann–Liouville differintegral, but can sometimes be used to solve problems that the Riemann–Liouville cannot.

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
{}_a\mathbb{D}^q_tf(t) &amp; = \frac{d^qf(t)}{d(t-a)^q} \\
&amp; =\lim_{N \to \infty}\left[\frac{t-a}{N}\right]^{-q}\sum_{j=0}^{N-1}(-1)^j{q \choose j}f\left(t-j\left[\frac{t-a}{N}\right]\right)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

*The [[Weyl differintegral]]
:This is formally similar to the Riemann–Liouville differintegral, but applies to [[periodic function]]s, with integral zero over a period.

==Definitions via transforms==

Recall the [[continuous Fourier transform]], here denoted &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; :

:&lt;math&gt; F(\omega) =  \mathcal{F}\{f(t)\} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(t) e^{- i\omega t}\,dt &lt;/math&gt;

Using the continuous Fourier transform, in Fourier space, differentiation transforms into a multiplication:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}\left[\frac{df(t)}{dt}\right] = i \omega \mathcal{F}[f(t)]&lt;/math&gt;

So,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^nf(t)}{dt^n} = \mathcal{F}^{-1}\left\{(i \omega)^n\mathcal{F}[f(t)]\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

which generalizes to

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{D}^qf(t)=\mathcal{F}^{-1}\left\{(i \omega)^q\mathcal{F}[f(t)]\right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Under the [[Laplace transform]], here denoted by &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt;, differentiation transforms into a multiplication

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}\left[\frac{df(t)}{dt}\right] = s\mathcal{L}[f(t)].&lt;/math&gt;

Generalizing to arbitrary order and solving for ''D''&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt;''f''(''t''), one obtains
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{D}^qf(t)=\mathcal{L}^{-1}\left\{s^q\mathcal{L}[f(t)]\right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Basic formal properties==

''Linearity rules''
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{D}^q(f+g)=\mathbb{D}^q(f)+\mathbb{D}^q(g)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{D}^q(af)=a\mathbb{D}^q(f)&lt;/math&gt;

''Zero rule''
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{D}^0 f=f \, &lt;/math&gt;

''Product rule''

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{D}^q_t(fg)=\sum_{j=0}^{\infty} {q \choose j}\mathbb{D}^j_t(f)\mathbb{D}^{q-j}_t(g)&lt;/math&gt;

In general, ''composition (or [[semigroup]]) rule'' is '''not satisfied'''&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite book |pages=75 (Property 2.4) |first=A. A. |last=Kilbas |first2=H. M. |last2=Srivastava |first3=J.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{D}^a\mathbb{D}^{b}f \neq \mathbb{D}^{a+b}f&lt;/math&gt;

==A selection of basic formulæ==

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{D}^q(t^n)=\frac{\Gamma(n+1)}{\Gamma(n+1-q)}t^{n-q}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{D}^q(\sin(t))=\sin \left( t+\frac{q\pi}{2} \right) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{D}^q(e^{at})=a^q e^{at}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3928">In [[mathematics]], '''Dixon's identity''' (or '''Dixon's theorem''' or '''Dixon's formula''') is any of several different but closely related identities proved by [[Alfred Dixon|A. C. Dixon]], some involving finite sums of products of three [[binomial coefficient]]s, and some evaluating a [[hypergeometric sum]].  These identities famously follow from the [[MacMahon Master theorem]], and can now be routinely proved by computer algorithms {{harv|Ekhad|1990}}.

==Statements==
The original identity, from {{harv|Dixon|1891}}, is

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=-a}^{a}(-1)^{k}{2a\choose k+a}^3 =\frac{(3a)!}{(a!)^3}.&lt;/math&gt;

A generalization, also sometimes called Dixon's identity, is

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k\in\mathbb{Z}}(-1)^k{a+b\choose a+k} {b+c\choose b+k}{c+a\choose c+k}  = \frac{(a+b+c)!}{a!b!c!}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' are non-negative integers {{harv|Wilf|1994|p=156}}. 
The sum on the left can be written as the terminating well-poised hypergeometric series
:&lt;math&gt;{b+c\choose b-a}{c+a\choose c-a}{}_3F_2(-2a,-a-b,-a-c;1+b-a,1+c-a;1)&lt;/math&gt;
and the identity follows as a limiting case (as ''a'' tends to an integer) of 
Dixon's theorem evaluating  a well-poised &lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[generalized hypergeometric series]] at 1, from {{harv|Dixon|1902}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\;_3F_2 (a,b,c;1+a-b,1+a-c;1)=
\frac{\Gamma(1+a/2)\Gamma(1+a/2-b-c)\Gamma(1+a-b)\Gamma(1+a-c)}
{\Gamma(1+a)\Gamma(1+a-b-c)\Gamma(1+a/2-b)\Gamma(1+a/2-c)}.&lt;/math&gt;
This holds for Re(1 + {{frac|1|2}}''a'' &amp;minus; ''b'' &amp;minus; ''c'') &amp;gt; 0. As ''c'' tends to &amp;minus;∞ it reduces to [[Kummer's formula]] for the hypergeometric function &lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; at &amp;minus;1. Dixon's theorem can be deduced from the evaluation of the [[Selberg integral]].

==q-analogues==
A ''q''-analogue of Dixon's formula for the [[basic hypergeometric series]] in terms of the [[q-Pochhammer symbol]] is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\;_{4}\phi_3 \left[\begin{matrix} 
a &amp; -qa^{1/2} &amp; b &amp; c \\

In [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]], the '''''{{lang|de|Entscheidungsproblem}}''''' ({{IPA-de|ɛntˈʃaɪ̯dʊŋspʁoˌbleːm|pron}}, [[German language|German]] for "decision problem") is a challenge posed by [[David Hilbert]] in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Hilbert and Ackermann&lt;/ref&gt; The problem asks for an [[algorithm]] that takes as input a statement of a [[first-order logic]] (possibly with a finite number of [[axiom]]s beyond the usual axioms of first-order logic) and answers "Yes" or "No" according to whether the statement is ''universally valid'', i.e., valid in every [[Structure (mathematical logic)|structure]] satisfying the axioms. By [[Gödel's completeness theorem|the completeness theorem of first-order logic]], a statement is universally valid if and only if it can be deduced from the axioms, so the ''{{lang|de|Entscheidungsproblem}}'' can also be viewed as asking for an algorithm to decide whether a given statement is provable from the axioms using the [[rules of logic]].

In 1936, [[Alonzo Church]] and [[Alan Turing]] published independent papers&lt;ref&gt;Church's paper was presented to the American Mathematical Society on 19 April 1935 and published on 15 April 1936. Turing, who had made substantial progress in writing up his own results, was disappointed to learn of Church's proof upon its publication (see correspondence between [[Max Newman]] and Church in [http://diglib.princeton.edu/ead/getEad?eadid=C0948&amp;kw= Alonzo Church papers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100607132453/http://diglib.princeton.edu/ead/getEad?eadid=C0948&amp;kw= |date=7 June 2010 }}). Turing quickly completed his paper and rushed it to publication; it was received by the ''Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society'' on 28 May 1936, read on 12 November 1936, and published in series 2, volume 42 (1936–7); it appeared in two sections: in Part 3 (pages 230–240), issued on Nov 30, 1936 and in Part 4 (pages 241–265), issued on Dec 23, 1936; Turing added corrections in volume 43 (1937), pp. 544–546. See the footnote at the end of Soare: 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; showing that a general solution to the ''{{lang|de|Entscheidungsproblem}}'' is impossible, assuming that the intuitive notion of "[[effectively calculable]]" is captured by the functions computable by a [[Turing machine]] (or equivalently, by those expressible in the [[lambda calculus]]). This assumption is now known as the [[Church–Turing thesis]].

== History of the problem ==
The origin of the ''{{lang|de|Entscheidungsproblem}}'' goes back to [[Gottfried Leibniz]], who in the seventeenth century, after having constructed a successful mechanical [[calculating machine]], dreamt of building a machine that could manipulate symbols in order to determine the [[truth value]]s of mathematical statements.&lt;ref&gt;Davis 2000: pp.&amp;nbsp;3&amp;ndash;20&lt;/ref&gt;  He realized that the first step would have to be a clean [[formal language]], and much of his subsequent work was directed towards that goal.  In 1928, [[David Hilbert]] and [[Wilhelm Ackermann]] posed the question in the form outlined above.

In continuation of his "program", Hilbert posed three questions at an international conference in 1928,  the third of which became known as "Hilbert's ''{{lang|de|Entscheidungsproblem}}''."&lt;ref&gt;Hodges p.&amp;nbsp;91&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929, [[Moses Schönfinkel]] published one paper on special cases of the decision problem that was prepared by [[Paul Bernays]].&lt;ref name="Kline"&gt;{{Citation | first=G. L. | last=Kline | title=Review of Foundations of mathematics and mathematical logic by S. A. Yanovskaya | journal=[[Journal of Symbolic Logic]] | volume=16 | pages=46&amp;ndash;48 | year=1951 | doi=10.2307/2268665 | jstor=2268665 | issue=1 | last2=Anovskaa | first2=S. A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As late as 1930, Hilbert believed that there would be no such thing as an unsolvable problem.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges p.&amp;nbsp;92, quoting from Hilbert&lt;/ref&gt;

== Negative answer ==
Before the question could be answered, the notion of "algorithm" had to be formally defined.  This was done by [[Alonzo Church]] in 1936 with the concept of "effective calculability" based on his [[lambda calculus|λ calculus]] and by Alan Turing in the same year with his concept of [[Turing machine]]s.  Turing  immediately recognized that these are equivalent [[model of computation|models of computation]].

The negative answer to the ''{{lang|de|Entscheidungsproblem}}'' was then given by Alonzo Church in 1935–36 and [[multiple discovery|independently]] shortly thereafter by Alan Turing in 1936.  Church proved that there is no [[computable function]] which decides for two given λ-calculus expressions whether they are equivalent or not. He relied heavily on earlier work by [[Stephen Cole Kleene|Stephen Kleene]]. Turing reduced the question of the existence of a 'general method' which decides whether any given Turing Machine halts or not (the [[halting problem]]) to the question of the existence of an 'algorithm' or 'general method' able to solve the ''{{lang|de|Entscheidungsproblem}}''. If 'Algorithm' is understood as being equivalent to a Turing Machine, and with the answer to the latter question negative (in general), the question about the existence of an Algorithm for the ''{{lang|de|Entscheidungsproblem}}'' also must be negative (in general). In his 1936 paper, Turing says: ''"Corresponding to each computing machine 'it' we construct a  formula 'Un(it)' and we show that, if there is a general method for determining whether 'Un(it)' is provable, then there is a general method for determining whether 'it' ever prints 0"''.

The work of both Church and Turing was heavily influenced by [[Kurt Gödel]]'s earlier work on his [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem|incompleteness theorem]], especially by the method of assigning numbers (a [[Gödel numbering]]) to logical formulas in order to reduce logic to arithmetic.

The ''{{lang|de|Entscheidungsproblem}}'' is related to [[Hilbert's tenth problem]], which asks for an [[algorithm]] to decide whether [[Diophantine equation]]s have a solution.  The non-existence of such an algorithm, established by [[Yuri Matiyasevich]] in 1970, also implies a negative answer to the Entscheidungsproblem.

Some first-order theories are algorithmically decidable; examples of this include [[Presburger arithmetic]], [[real closed field]]s and [[Type system#Static typing|static type systems]] of many [[programming language]]s. The general first-order theory of the [[natural number]]s expressed in [[Peano axioms|Peano's axioms]] cannot be decided with an algorithm, however.

==Practical decision procedures==
Having practical decision procedures for classes of logical formulas is of considerable interest for [[program verification]] and circuit verification. Pure Boolean logical formulas are usually decided using [[Boolean satisfiability problem|SAT-solving]] techniques based on the [[DPLL algorithm]]. Conjunctive formulas over linear real or rational arithmetic can be decided using the [[simplex algorithm]], formulas in linear integer arithmetic ([[Presburger arithmetic]]) can be decided using [[Cooper's algorithm]] or [[William Pugh (computer scientist)|William Pugh]]'s [[Omega test]]. Formulas with negations, conjunctions and disjunctions combine the difficulties of satisfiability testing with that of decision of conjunctions; they are generally decided nowadays using [[satisfiability modulo theories|SMT-solving]] techniques, which combine SAT-solving with decision procedures for conjunctions and propagation techniques. Real polynomial arithmetic, also known as the theory of [[real closed field]]s, is decidable; this is the [[Tarski–Seidenberg theorem]], which has been implemented in computers by using the [[cylindrical algebraic decomposition]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9722">In [[mathematics]], in the area of [[additive number theory]], the '''Erdős–Fuchs theorem''' is a statement about the number of ways that numbers can be represented as a sum of two elements of a given set, stating that the average order of this number cannot be too close to being a [[linear function]].

The theorem is named after [[Paul Erdős]] and [[Wolfgang Heinrich Johannes Fuchs]], who published it in 1956.

==Statement==
Let &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\mathcal{A}\subseteq\mathbb{N} &lt;/math&gt; be an infinite subset of the [[natural number]]s and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;r_{\mathcal{A},h}(n) &lt;/math&gt; its ''representation function'', which denotes the number of ways that a natural number &lt;math display="inline"&gt;n &lt;/math&gt; can be expressed as the sum of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;h &lt;/math&gt; elements of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\mathcal{A} &lt;/math&gt; (taking order into account). We then consider the ''accumulated representation function'': &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;s_{\mathcal{A},h}(x) := \sum_{n\leqslant x} r_{\mathcal{A},h}(n) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;which counts (also taking order into account) the number of solutions to &lt;math display="inline"&gt;k_1 + \cdots + k_h \leqslant x &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math display="inline"&gt;k_1,\ldots,k_h \in \mathcal{A} &lt;/math&gt;. The theorem then states that, for any given &lt;math display="inline"&gt;c&gt;0 &lt;/math&gt;, the relation &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;s_{\mathcal{A},2}(n) = cn + o\left(n^{1/4}\log(n)^{-1/2} \right) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;'''cannot''' be satisfied; that is, there is '''no''' &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\mathcal{A}\subseteq\mathbb{N} &lt;/math&gt; satisfying the above estimate.

== Theorems of Erdős-Fuchs type ==
The Erdős–Fuchs theorem has an interesting history of precedents and generalizations. In 1915, it was already known by [[G. H. Hardy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hardy|first=G. H.|year=1915|title=On the expression of a number as the sum of two squares|url=|journal=Quart. J. Math|volume=46|pages=263–83|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that in the case of the sequence &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\mathcal{Q}:=\{0,1,4,9,\ldots\} &lt;/math&gt; of [[Square number|perfect squares]] one have&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\limsup_{n\to +\infty} \frac{\left|s_{\mathcal{Q},2}(n)- \pi n\right|}{n^{1/4}\log(n)^{1/4}} &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This estimate is a little better than that described by Erdős-Fuchs, but at the cost of a slight loss of precision, P. Erdős and W. H. J. Fuchs achieved complete generality in their result (at least for the case &lt;math display="inline"&gt;h=2 &lt;/math&gt;). Another reason this result is so celebrated may be due to the fact that, in 1941, P. Erdős and [[Pál Turán|P. Turán]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Erdős|first=P.|last2=Turán|first2=P.|year=1941|title=On a problem of Sidon in additive number theory, and some related problems|url=|journal=J. London Math. Soc.|volume=16|pages=212–5|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; conjectured that, subject to the same hypotheses as in the theorem stated, the relation&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;s_{\mathcal{A},2}(n) = cn + O(1)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;could not hold. This fact remained unproved until 1956 when Erdős and Fuchs obtained their theorem, which is much stronger than the previously conjectured estimate.

=== Improved versions for h = 2 ===
This theorem has been extended in a number of different directions. In 1980, [[András Sárközy|A. Sárközy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sárközy|first=A.|year=1980|title=On a theorem of Erdős and Fuchs|url=|journal=Acta Arith.|volume=37|pages=333–338|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; considered two sequences which are "near" in some sense. He proved the following:&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Theorem''' (Sárközy, 1980)'''.''' ''If &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\mathcal{A} = \{a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt;\ldots\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\mathcal{B} = \{b_1 &lt; b_2 &lt; \ldots\}&lt;/math&gt; are two infinite subsets of natural numbers with &lt;math display="inline"&gt;a_i - b_i = o\big(a_i ^{1/2}\log(a_i)^{-1} \big)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math display="inline"&gt;|\{(i,j):a_i+b_j \leqslant n\}| = cn + o\big(n^{1/4}\log(n)^{-1/2} \big)&lt;/math&gt; cannot hold for any constant'' &lt;math display="inline"&gt;c &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;In 1990, [[Hugh Lowell Montgomery|H. L. Montgomery]] and [[Bob Vaughan|R. C. Vaughan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Montgomery|first=H. L.|last2=Vaughan|first2=R. C.|year=1990|title=On the Erdős-Fuchs theorem|url=|journal=A tribute to Paul Erdős|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|volume=|pages=331–338|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where able to remove the log from the right-hand side of Erdős-Fuchs original statement, showing that&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;s_{\mathcal{A},2}(n) = cn + o(n^{1/4})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;cannot hold. In 2004, [[Gábor Horváth (mathematician)|G. Horváth]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Horváth|first=G.|year=2004|title=An improvement of an extension of a theorem  of Erdős and Fuchs|url=|journal=Acta Math. Hung.|volume=104|pages=27–37|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; extended both these results, proving the following:&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Theorem''' (Horváth, 2004). ''If &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\mathcal{A}=\{a_1&lt;a_2&lt;\ldots\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\mathcal{B}=\{b_1&lt;b_2&lt;\ldots\}&lt;/math&gt; are infinite subsets of natural numbers with &lt;math display="inline"&gt;a_i-b_i = o\big(a_i^{1/2}\big)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;|\mathcal{A}\cap[0,n]| - |\mathcal{B}\cap[0,n]| = O(1)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math display="inline"&gt;|\{(i,j):a_i+b_j \leqslant n\}| = cn + o\big(n^{1/4} \big)&lt;/math&gt; cannot hold for any constant &lt;math display="inline"&gt;c&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== The general case (h ≥ 2) ===
The natural generalization to Erdős–Fuchs theorem, namely for &lt;math display="inline"&gt;h \geqslant 3&lt;/math&gt;, is known to hold with same strength as the Montgomery-Vaughan's version. In fact, M. Tang&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tang|first=Min|year=2009|title=On a generalization of a theorem of Erdős and Fuchs|url=|journal=Discrete Math.|volume=309|pages=6288–6293|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed in 2009 that, in the same conditions as in the original statement of Erdős-Fuchs, for every &lt;math&gt;h \geqslant 2&lt;/math&gt; the relation&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;s_{\mathcal{A},h}(n) = cn + o(n^{1/4})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;cannot hold. In another direction, in 2002, G. Horváth&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Horváth|first=G.|year=2002|title=On a theorem of Erdős and Fuchs|url=|journal=Acta Arith.|volume=103|issue=4|pages=321–328|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; gave a precise generalization of Sárközy's 1980 result, showing that&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Theorem''' (Horváth, 2002) ''If &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}^{(j)}=\{a^{(j)}_1&lt;a^{(j)}_2&lt;\ldots\}&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;j=1,\ldots,k&lt;/math&gt;) are'' &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; ''(at least two) infinite subsets of natural numbers and the following estimates are valid:''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* &lt;blockquote&gt;''&lt;math&gt;a^{(1)}_i - a^{(2)}_i = o\big((a^{(1)}_i) ^{1/2}\log(a_i^{(1)})^{-k/2} \big)&lt;/math&gt;''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* &lt;blockquote&gt;''&lt;math&gt;|\mathcal{A}^{(j)}\cap[0,n]| = \Theta\big(|\mathcal{A}^{(1)}\cap[0,n]|\big)&lt;/math&gt; (for &lt;math&gt;j=3,\ldots,k&lt;/math&gt;)''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;''then the relation:''&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''&lt;math&gt;|\{(i_1,\ldots, i_k):a^{(1)}_{i_1}+\ldots+a^{(k)}_{i_k} \leqslant n,~ a^{(j)}_{i_j} \in \mathcal{A}^{(j)} (j =1,\ldots,k)\}| = cn + o\big(n^{1/4}\log(n)^{1-3k/4} \big)&lt;/math&gt;''&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''cannot hold for any constant &lt;math display="inline"&gt;c &gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Non-linear approximations ===
Yet another direction in which the Erdős–Fuchs theorem can be improved is by considering approximations to &lt;math display="inline"&gt;s_{\mathcal{A},h}(n)&lt;/math&gt; other than &lt;math display="inline"&gt;cn&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math display="inline"&gt;c&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Ettore Bortolotti''' (6 March 1866 – 17 February 1947) was an [[Italians|Italian]] mathematician.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathematica.sns.it/autori/806/ An Italian short biography of Ettore Bortolotti] in ''Edizione Nazionale Mathematica Italiana'' online.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Bortolotti was born in [[Bologna]]. He studied [[mathematics]] under [[Salvatore Pincherle]] and [[Cesare Arzelà]] in Bologna. He graduated in mathematics in 1889 at the [[University of Bologna]], under Pincherle. He was appointed as lecturer to the Lyceum of Modica in [[Sicily]] in 1891, then studied one year in [[Paris]] as a post-graduate, before lecturing at the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]] in 1893.

In 1900, he became professor for [[infinitesimal calculus]] at [[Modena]]. There, he became dean from 1913 to 1919, then moved back to the University of Bologna, where he retired in 1936.

He was an Invited Speaker of the [[International Congress of Mathematicians|ICM]] in 1924 in Toronto&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bortolotti, Ettore|chapter=La memoria "De Infinitis Hyperbolis" di Torricelli|title=''In:'' Proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematicians in Toronto, August 11–16. 1924|volume=vol. 2|pages=943–958|chapter-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1928 in Bologna.

Bortolotti must also be considered a differential geometer and a relativist too. In fact, in the year 1929, he commented on the geometric basis for [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]’s [[Teleparallelism|absolute parallelism theory]] in a paper entitled "Stars of [[Congruence (manifolds)|congruences]] and absolute parallelism: Geometric basis for a recent theory of Einstein".&lt;ref&gt;E.

Bortolotti, ''On metric connections with absolute parallelism'', Proc. Kon. Akad. Wet. Amsterdam 30 (1927), 216-218.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bortolotti died in [[Bologna]].

In [[finance]], a '''''T''-forward measure''' is a pricing measure absolutely continuous with respect to a [[risk-neutral measure]] but rather than using the money market as [[numeraire]], it uses a bond with maturity ''T''. The use of the forward measure was pioneered by [[Farshid Jamshidian]] (1987), and later used as a means of calculating the price of [[bond option|options on bonds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation  |first=Farshid |last=Jamshidian |date=1989|title= An Exact Bond Option Pricing Formula| journal=The Journal of Finance |volume=44|pages= 205–209| doi=10.1111/j.1540-6261.1989.tb02413.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mathematical definition&lt;ref&gt;Martingale methods in financial modelling. 2nd ed. New York : Springer-Verlag, 2004. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; ==

Let

: &lt;math&gt;B(T) = \exp\left(\int_0^T r(u)\, du\right)&lt;/math&gt;

be the bank account or money market account numeraire and

: &lt;math&gt;D(T) = 1/B(T) = \exp\left(-\int_0^T r(u)\, du\right)&lt;/math&gt;

be the discount factor in the market at time 0 for maturity ''T''.  If &lt;math&gt;Q_*&lt;/math&gt; is the risk neutral measure, then the forward measure &lt;math&gt;Q_T&lt;/math&gt; is defined via the [[Radon–Nikodym derivative]] given by

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dQ_T}{dQ_*} = \frac{1}{B(T) E_{Q_*}[1/B(T)]} = \frac{D(T)}{E_{Q_*}[D(T)]}.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that this implies that the forward measure and the risk neutral measure coincide when interest rates are deterministic.  Also, this is a particular form of the [[numeraire|change of numeraire]] formula by changing the numeraire from the money market or bank account ''B''(''t'') to a ''T''-maturity bond ''P''(''t'',''T''). Indeed, if in general

:&lt;math&gt;P(t,T) = E_{Q_*}\left[\frac{B(t)}{B(T)}|\mathcal{F}(t)\right] = E_{Q_*}\left[\frac{D(T)}{D(t)}|\mathcal{F}(t)\right] &lt;/math&gt;

is the price of a zero coupon bond at time ''t'' for maturity ''T'', where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the filtration denoting market information at time ''t'', then we can write

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dQ_T}{dQ_*} = \frac{B(0) P(T,T)}{B(T) P(0,T)} &lt;/math&gt;
from which it is indeed clear that the forward ''T'' measure is associated to the ''T''-maturity zero coupon bond as [[numeraire]]. For a more detailed discussion see Brigo and Mercurio (2001).

== Consequences ==

The name "forward measure" comes from the fact that under the forward measure, [[forward price]]s are [[martingale (probability theory)|martingales]], a fact first observed by Geman (1989) (who is responsible for formally defining the measure).&lt;ref&gt;Geman, H. (1989) The importance of the forward neutral probability in the stochastic approach of interest rates. Working paper, ESSEC.&lt;/ref&gt;  Compare with futures prices, which are martingales under the risk neutral measure.  Note that when interest rates are deterministic, this implies that forward prices and futures prices are the same.

For example, the discounted stock price is a martingale under the risk-neutral measure:

:&lt;math&gt;S(t) D(t) = E_{Q_*}[D(T)S(T) | \mathcal{F}(t)].\,&lt;/math&gt;

The forward price is given by &lt;math&gt;F_S(t,T) = \frac{S(t)}{P(t,T)}&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, we have &lt;math&gt;F_S(T,T)=S(T)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;F_S(t,T) = \frac{E_{Q_*}[D(T)S(T) | \mathcal{F}(t)]}{D(t) P(t,T)}= E_{Q_T}[F_S(T,T) | \mathcal{F}(t)]\frac{E_{Q_*}[D(T)|\mathcal{F}(t)]}{D(t) P(t,T)}&lt;/math&gt;

by using the Radon-Nikodym derivative &lt;math&gt;\frac{dQ_T}{dQ_*}&lt;/math&gt; and the equality &lt;math&gt;F_S(T,T)=S(T)&lt;/math&gt;.  The last term is equal to unity by definition of the bond price so that we get

:&lt;math&gt;F_S(t,T) = E_{Q_T}[F_S(T,T)|\mathcal{F}(t)].\,&lt;/math&gt;

'''Grace Chisholm Young''' (née Chisholm) was an [[English people|English]] [[mathematician]].  She was educated at [[Girton College, Cambridge]], England and continued her studies at [[Göttingen University]] in Germany, where in 1895 she became the first woman to receive a doctorate in any field in that country.&lt;ref name="IntWomenSci"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haines|first1=Catherine M. C.|title=International Women in Science: a biographical dictionary to 1950|date=2001|publisher=ABC-CLIO Inc|location=Santa Barbara, California|isbn=1-57607-090-5|pages=383}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her early writings were published under the name of her husband, [[William Henry Young]], and they collaborated on mathematical work throughout their lives. For her work on [[calculus]] (1914–16), she was awarded the Gamble Prize for Mathematics by Girton College, University of Cambridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.agnesscott.edu/lriddle/women/young.htm | title=Biographies of Women Mathematicians: Grace Chisholm Young | publisher=[[Agnes Scott College]] | accessdate=7 March 2012 | author=Riddle, Larry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
She was the youngest of three surviving children. Her father was a senior civil servant, with the title Warden of the Standards in charge of the Weights and Measures Department.&lt;ref name="RoySoc1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rothman|first1=Patricia|title=Grace Chisholm Young and the Division of Laurels|journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London|date=1996|volume=50|issue=1|pages=89–100|jstor=531843|doi=10.1098/rsnr.1996.0008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two girls were taught at home by their mother, father and a governess which was the custom during that time. Her family encouraged her to become involved in social work, helping the poor in London. She had aspirations of studying medicine, but her family would not allow this. However, Chisholm wanted to continue her studies. She passed the senior examination for entrance into Cambridge University at the age of 17.

==Education==
Chisholm entered Girton College in 1889 aged 22, four years after she passed the senior entrance examination having been awarded the Sir Francis Goldsmid Scholarship by the college. At this time the college was only associated with the University of Cambridge with men and women graded on separate but related lists. Although she wanted to study medicine, her mother would not permit this, so, supported by her father, she decided to study mathematics.&lt;ref name="RoySoc1996" /&gt; At the end of her first year, when the Mays list came out, top of the Second class immediately below [[Ada Maddison|Isabel Maddison]]. In 1893, Grace passed her final examinations with the equivalent of a first-class degree, ranked between 23 and 24 relative to 112 men.&lt;ref name="IntWomenSci" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RoySoc1996" /&gt;

She also took (unofficially, on a challenge, with Isabel Maddison) the exam for the Final Honours School in mathematics at the [[University of Oxford]] in 1892 in which she out-performed all the Oxford students. As a result, she became the first person to obtain a First class degree at both Oxford and Cambridge Universities in any subject.&lt;ref name="RoySoc1996" /&gt;

Chisholm remained at Cambridge for an additional year to complete Part II of the [[Cambridge Mathematical Tripos|Mathematical Tripos]], which was unusual for women.

She wanted to continue her studies and since women were not yet admitted to graduate schools in England she went to the [[University of Göttingen]] in Germany to study with [[Felix Klein]]. This was one of the major mathematical centres in the world. The decision to admit her had to be approved by the Berlin Ministry of Culture and was part of an experiment in admitting women to university studies.&lt;ref name="RoySoc1996" /&gt; In 1895, at the age of 27, Chisholm became the first woman to be awarded a doctorate in any field in Germany.&lt;ref name="IntWomenSci" /&gt; Again government approval had to be obtained to allow her to take the examination, which consisted of probing questions by several professors on sections such as geometry, differential equations, physics, astronomy, and the area of her dissertation, all in German. Along with her test she was required to take courses showing broader knowledge as well as prepare a thesis which was entitled ''Algebraisch-gruppentheoretische Untersuchungen zur sphärischen Trigonometrie'' (''Algebraic Groups of Spherical Trigonometry'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agnesscott.edu/lriddle/women/young.htm |title=Grace Chisholm Young |publisher=Agnesscott.edu |date=1944-03-29 |accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
After returning to England in 1896 to marry, she resumed research she had initiated at Gӧttingen into an equation to determine the orbit of a comet. Her husband continued his work coaching in mathematics.&lt;ref name="RoySoc1996" /&gt; However, in 1897 they both returned to Gӧttingen, encouraged by Felix Klein. Both attend advanced lectures and while she continued her mathematical research her husband started to work creatively for the first time. They visited Turin in Italy to study modern geometry and under Klein's guidance they becan to work in the new area of set theory.&lt;ref name="RoySoc1996" /&gt; From about 1901, the Youngs began to publish papers together. These concerned the theory of functions of a real variable and were heavily influenced by new ideas with which she had come into contact with in Gӧttingen.  In 1908 they moved to Geneva in Switzerland where she continued to be based while her husband held a series of academic posts in India and the UK. 
 
Although most of their work was published jointly it is believed that Grace did a large amount of the actual writing, and she also produced some independent work which, according to expert opinion, was deeper and more important than her husband's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Caroline Series | title=British women mathematicians 200 years of history | year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, they published about 214 papers together.&lt;ref name="IntWomenSci" /&gt; and four books.&lt;ref name="RoySoc1996" /&gt; She began to publish in her own name in 1914, and was awarded the Gamble Prize for Mathematics by Girton College for an essay ''On infinite derivates'' in 1915.&lt;ref name="RoySoc1996" /&gt; This work was stimulated by developments in microscopy that allowed real molecular motion to be viewed. Her work between 1914-16 on relationships between derivatives of an arbitrary function contributed to the [[Denjoy-Young-Saks theorem]].

They also wrote an elementary geometry book (''The First Book of Geometry'', 1905) which was translated into 4 languages. In 1906 the Youngs published ''The Theory of Sets of Points'', the first textbook on set theory.&lt;ref name="IntWomenSci" /&gt;

==Personal life==
Chisholm married William Henry Young in 1896, the year after she received her Ph.D. from Göttingen. He had been her tutor for one term at Cambridge and they had become friends after he was one of the people that she sent a copy of her doctoral thesis.  He suggested collaboration in a publication about astronomy but they did not pursue this.&lt;ref name="IntWomenSci" /&gt; They had six children within nine years.

In addition to her career as a pioneering woman in what was then a discipline with significant [[Barrier to entry|barriers to entry]], she completed all the requirements for a [[Physician|medical degree]] except the [[Internship (medicine)|internship]]. She also learned six languages and taught each of her children a musical instrument. In addition, she published two books for children (''Bimbo:A Little Real Story for Jill and Molly'' (1905) and ''Bimbo and the Frogs: Another Real Story'' (1907)). The former was aimed to explain where babies came from to children while the latter was about cells.&lt;ref name="IntWomenSci" /&gt; In 1929 she started a historical novel ''The Crown of England'' set in the sixteenth century. She worked on this for five years but it was never published.&lt;ref name="RoySoc1996" /&gt;

With the approach of World War II, she left Switzerland in 1940 to take two of her grandchildren to England. She planned to return immediately, but because of the fall of France, she could not. This left William alone, and he died two years later in 1942. Two years after that, Grace Chisholm Young died of a heart attack.&lt;ref name="IntWomenSci" /&gt;

Of their six children, three continued on to study mathematics (including [[Laurence Chisholm Young]] and [[Rosalind Tanner|Cecilia Rosalind Tanner]]), one daughter (Janet) became a physician, and one son (Patrick) became a chemist and pursued a career in finance and business. Their eldest son (Frank) was killed in World War I and his death had a profound effect on his parents, reducing their mathematical creativity.&lt;ref name="RoySoc1996" /&gt; One of Grace's fourteen grandchildren, [[Sylvia Wiegand]] (daughter of Laurence), is a mathematician at the [[University of Nebraska]] and is a past president of the [[Association for Women in Mathematics]].

==Legacy==
In 1996 [[Sylvia Wiegand]] and her husband Roger established a fellowship for graduate student research at the University of Nebraska in honor of Grace Chisholm Young and [[William Henry Young]], called the Grace Chisholm Young and William Henry Young Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=PO BOX 880130 |url=http://www.math.unl.edu/department/awards/graduate/#young |title=UNL &amp;#124; Arts &amp; Sciences &amp;#124; Math &amp;#124; Department &amp;#124; Awards &amp;#124; Graduate Student Awards |publisher=Math.unl.edu |date=2010-11-18 |accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sylvia is one of Grace's fourteen grandchildren.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13452">In the mathematical field of [[graph theory]], an '''automorphism''' of a graph is a form of symmetry in which the graph is mapped onto itself while preserving the edge–vertex connectivity.

Formally, an automorphism of a graph ''G''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''V'',''E'') is a [[permutation]] σ of the vertex set ''V'', such that the pair of vertices (''u'',''v'') form an edge if and only if the pair (σ(''u''),σ(''v'')) also form an edge. That is, it is a [[graph isomorphism]] from ''G'' to itself. Automorphisms may be defined in this way both for [[directed graph]]s and for [[undirected graph]]s. 
The [[Function composition|composition]] of two automorphisms is another automorphism, and the set of automorphisms of a given graph, under the composition operation, forms a [[Group (mathematics)|group]], the [[automorphism group]] of the graph. In the opposite direction, by [[Frucht's theorem]], all groups can be represented as the automorphism group of a connected graph – indeed, of a [[cubic graph]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Frucht | first1=R. | title=Herstellung von Graphen mit vorgegebener abstrakter Gruppe | url=http://www.numdam.org/item?id=CM_1939__6__239_0 | language=German | year=1938 | journal=Compositio Mathematica | issn=0010-437X | volume=6 | pages=239–250 | zbl=0020.07804}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Frucht | first1=R. | title=Graphs of degree three with a given abstract group | url=http://cms.math.ca/cjm/v1/p365 |mr=0032987 | year=1949 | journal=[[Canadian Journal of Mathematics]] | issn=0008-414X | volume=1 | pages=365–378 | doi=10.4153/CJM-1949-033-6 | issue=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computational complexity==
Constructing the automorphism group is at least as difficult (in terms of its [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]]) as solving the [[graph isomorphism problem]], determining whether two given graphs correspond vertex-for-vertex and edge-for-edge. For, ''G'' and ''H'' are isomorphic if and only if the disconnected graph formed by the [[disjoint union of graphs]] ''G'' and ''H'' has an automorphism that swaps the two components.&lt;ref name="luks82"&gt;{{citation|last=Luks|first=Eugene M.|authorlink=Eugene M.

[[File:Petersen1 tiny.svg|thumb|right|This drawing of the [[Petersen graph]] displays a [[subgroup]] of its symmetries, isomorphic to the [[dihedral group]] ''D''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, but the graph has additional symmetries that are not present in the drawing.  For example, since the graph is [[symmetric graph|symmetric]], all edges are equivalent.]]

The '''graph automorphism problem''' is the problem of testing whether a graph has a nontrivial automorphism. It belongs to the [[class NP]] of computational complexity. Similar to the graph isomorphism problem, it is unknown whether it has a [[polynomial time]] algorithm or it is [[NP-complete]].&lt;ref name="lubiw81"&gt;{{citation

==Algorithms, software and applications==
While no ''worst-case'' polynomial-time algorithms are known for the general Graph Automorphism problem, finding the automorphism group (and printing out an irredundant set of generators) for many large graphs arising in applications is rather easy. Several open-source software tools are available for this task, including  [http://cs.anu.edu.au/people/bdm/nauty/ NAUTY],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=McKay|first=Brendan|title=Practical Graph Isomorphism|journal=Congressus Numerantium|year=1981|volume=30|pages=45–87|url=http://cs.anu.edu.au/people/bdm/nauty/pgi.pdf|accessdate=14 April 2011|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.tcs.hut.fi/Software/bliss/ BLISS]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Junttila|first1=Tommi|last2=Kaski|first2=Petteri|title=Engineering an efficient canonical labeling tool for large and sparse graphs|journal=Proceedings of the Ninth Workshop on Algorithm Engineering and Experiments (ALENEX07)|year=2007|url=http://ai.cs.unibas.ch/research/reading_group/junttila-kaski-alenex07.pdf|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [http://vlsicad.eecs.umich.edu/BK/SAUCY/ SAUCY].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Darga|first1=Paul|last2=Sakallah|first2=Karem|last3=Markov|first3=Igor L.|title=Faster Symmetry Discovery using Sparsity of Symmetries|journal=Proceedings of the 45th Design Automation Conference|date=June 2008|pages=149–154|doi=10.1145/1391469.1391509|url=http://vlsicad.eecs.umich.edu/BK/SAUCY/saucy-dac08.pdf|isbn=978-1-60558-115-6|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Satisfiability Symposium (SAT)|date=July 2010|url=http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~imarkov/pubs/conf/sat10-sym.pdf|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; SAUCY and BLISS are particularly efficient for sparse graphs, e.g., SAUCY processes some graphs with millions of vertices in mere seconds. However, BLISS and NAUTY can also produce [[Graph canonization|Canonical Labeling]], whereas SAUCY is currently optimized for solving Graph Automorphism. An important observation is that for a graph on ''n'' vertices, the automorphism group can be specified by no more than ''n-1'' generators, and the above software packages are guaranteed to satisfy this bound as a side-effect of their algorithms (minimal sets of generators are harder to find and are not particularly useful in practice). It also appears that the total support (i.e., the number of vertices moved) of all generators is limited by a linear function of ''n'', which is important in runtime analysis of these algorithms. However, this has not been established for a fact, as of March 2012.

Practical applications of Graph Automorphism include [[graph drawing]] and other visualization tasks, solving structured instances of [[Boolean Satisfiability]] arising in the context of [[Formal verification]] and [[Supply chain|Logistics]]. [[Molecular symmetry]] can predict or explain chemical properties.

==Symmetry display==
Several [[graph drawing]] researchers have investigated algorithms for drawing graphs in such a way that the automorphisms of the graph become visible as symmetries of the drawing. This may be done either by using a method that is not designed around symmetries, but that automatically generates symmetric drawings when possible,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Giuseppe|last1=Di Battista|first2=Roberto|last2=Tamassia|author2-link=Roberto Tamassia|first3=Ioannis G.|last3=Tollis|title=Area requirement and symmetry display of planar upward drawings|journal=[[Discrete and Computational Geometry]]|volume=7|issue=1|year=1992|pages=381–401|doi=10.1007/BF02187850}}; {{citation|first1=Peter|last1=Eades|author1-link=Peter Eades|first2=Xuemin|last2=Lin|title=Spring algorithms and symmetry|journal=Theoretical Computer Science|volume=240|issue=2|year=2000|pages=379–405|doi=10.1016/S0304-3975(99)00239-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or by explicitly identifying symmetries and using them to guide vertex placement in the drawing.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Seok-Hee|last=Hong|contribution=Drawing graphs symmetrically in three dimensions|title=[[International Symposium on Graph Drawing|Proc. 9th Int.

==Graph families defined by their automorphisms==
&lt;!--Please do not change section heading as "Template:Graph families defined by their automorphisms" points to it.--&gt;
Several families of graphs are defined by having certain types of automorphisms:
*An [[asymmetric graph]] is an undirected graph without any nontrivial automorphisms.
*A [[vertex-transitive graph]] is an undirected graph in which every vertex may be mapped by an automorphism into any other vertex.
*An [[edge-transitive graph]] is an undirected graph in which every edge may be mapped by an automorphism into any other edge.
*A [[symmetric graph]] is a graph such that every pair of adjacent vertices may be mapped by an automorphism into any other pair of adjacent vertices.
*A [[distance-transitive graph]] is a graph such that every pair of vertices may be mapped by an automorphism into any other pair of vertices that are the same distance apart.
*A [[semi-symmetric graph]] is a graph that is edge-transitive but not vertex-transitive.
*A [[half-transitive graph]] is a graph that is vertex-transitive and edge-transitive but not symmetric.
*A [[skew-symmetric graph]] is a directed graph together with a permutation σ on the vertices that maps edges to edges but reverses the direction of each edge. Additionally, σ is required to be an [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]].

Inclusion relationships between these families are indicated by the following table:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8088">In [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]], in the field of [[coding theory]], the '''Hamming bound''' is a limit on the parameters of an arbitrary [[block code]]: it is also known as the '''sphere-packing bound''' or the '''volume bound''' from an interpretation in terms of [[Sphere packing|packing balls]] in the [[Hamming metric]] into the [[Space (mathematics)|space]] of all possible words.  It gives an important limitation on the [[efficiency]] with which any [[error-correcting code]] can utilize the space in which its [[code word]]s are embedded.  A code which attains the Hamming bound is said to be a '''perfect code'''.

==Background on error-correcting codes==

An original message and an encoded version are both composed in an alphabet of ''q'' letters. Each [[code word]] contains ''n'' letters. The original message (of length ''m'') is shorter than ''n'' letters. The message is converted into an ''n''-letter codeword by an encoding algorithm, transmitted over a noisy [[channel (communications)|channel]], and finally decoded by the receiver. The decoding process interprets a garbled codeword, referred to as simply a ''word'', as the valid codeword "nearest" the ''n''-letter received string.

Mathematically, there are exactly ''q''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; possible messages of length ''m'', and each message can be regarded as a [[coordinate vector|vector]] of length ''m''. The encoding scheme converts an ''m''-dimensional vector into an ''n''-dimensional vector. Exactly ''q''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; valid codewords are possible, but any one of ''q''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; garbled codewords (words) can be received, because the noisy channel might distort one or more of the ''n'' letters while the codeword is being transmitted.

== Statement of the bound ==
Let &lt;math&gt;\ A_q(n,d)&lt;/math&gt; denote the maximum possible size of a &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;-ary block code &lt;math&gt;\ C&lt;/math&gt; of length &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and minimum [[Hamming distance]] &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; (a &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;-ary block code of length &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is a subset of the strings of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}_q^n\text{,}&lt;/math&gt; where the alphabet set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}_q&lt;/math&gt; has &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; elements).

Then, the Hamming bound is:

:&lt;math&gt;
\ A_q(n,d) \leq \frac{q^n}{\sum_{k=0}^t \binom{n}{k}(q-1)^k}
&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;t=\left\lfloor\frac{d-1}{2}\right\rfloor.&lt;/math&gt;

==Proof==
It follows from the definition of &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; that if at most 
:&lt;math&gt; t = \left\lfloor\frac{1}{2}(d-1)\right\rfloor&lt;/math&gt; 
errors are made during transmission of a [[codeword]] then [[minimum distance decoding]] will decode it correctly (i.e., it decodes the received word as the codeword that was sent). Thus the code is said to be capable of correcting &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; errors.

For each codeword &lt;math&gt;c \in C&lt;/math&gt;, consider a [[ball (mathematics)|ball]] of fixed radius &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; around &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;. Every pair of these balls (Hamming spheres) are non-intersecting by the &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;-error-correcting property. Let &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; be the number of words in each ball (in other words, the volume of the ball). A word that is in such a ball can deviate in at most &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; components from those of the ball's [[ball (mathematics)|centre]], which is a codeword. The number of such words is then obtained by [[binomial coefficients|choosing]] up to &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; of the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; components of a codeword to deviate to one of &lt;math&gt;(q-1)&lt;/math&gt; possible other values (recall, the code is &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;-ary: it takes values in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}_q^n&lt;/math&gt;). Thus,

:&lt;math&gt;m =
 \begin{matrix}
  \sum_{k=0}^t \binom{n}{k}(q-1)^k
 \end{matrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;A_q (n,d)&lt;/math&gt; is the (maximum) total number of codewords in &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, and so, by the definition of &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, the greatest number of balls with no two balls having a word in common. Taking the [[union (set theory)|union]] of the words in these balls centered at codewords, results in a set of words, each counted precisely once, that is a subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}_q^n&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;|\mathcal{A}_q^n| = q^n&lt;/math&gt; words) and so:

:&lt;math&gt; A_q(n,d) \times m = A_q(n,d) \times
 \begin{matrix}
  \sum_{k=0}^t \binom{n}{k}(q-1)^k
 \end{matrix}
\leq q^n.&lt;/math&gt;

Whence:

:&lt;math&gt;A_q(n,d) \leq \frac{q^n}{
 \begin{matrix}
  \sum_{k=0}^t \binom{n}{k}(q-1)^k
 \end{matrix}}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Covering radius and packing radius==
:{{main|Delone set}}
For an &lt;math&gt;A_q(n,d)&lt;/math&gt; code ''C'' (a subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}_q^n&lt;/math&gt;), the ''covering radius'' of ''C'' is the smallest value of ''r'' such that every element of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}_q^n&lt;/math&gt; is contained in at least one ball of radius ''r'' centered at each codeword of ''C''. The ''packing radius'' of ''C'' is the largest value of ''s'' such that the set of balls of radius ''s'' centered at each codeword of ''C'' are mutually disjoint.

From the proof of the Hamming bound, it can be seen that for &lt;math&gt; t\,=\,\left\lfloor\frac{1}{2}(d-1)\right\rfloor&lt;/math&gt;, we have:
:: ''s'' ≤ ''t'' and ''t'' ≤ ''r''.
Therefore, ''s'' ≤ ''r'' and if equality holds then ''s'' = ''r'' = ''t''. The case of equality means that the Hamming bound is attained.

== Perfect codes ==
Codes that attain the Hamming bound are called '''perfect codes'''. Examples include codes that have only one codeword, and codes that are the whole of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathcal{A}_q^n&lt;/math&gt;. Another example is given by the ''repeat codes'', where each symbol of the message is repeated an odd fixed number of times to obtain a codeword where ''q'' = 2. All of these examples are often called the ''trivial'' perfect codes.
In 1973, it was proved that any non-trivial perfect code over a prime-power alphabet has the parameters of a [[Hamming code]] or a [[Golay code (disambiguation)|Golay code]].&lt;ref&gt;Hill (1988) p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

A perfect code may be interpreted as one in which the balls of Hamming radius ''t'' centered on codewords exactly fill out the space (''t'' is the covering radius = packing radius).  A '''quasi-perfect code''' is one in which the balls of Hamming radius ''t'' centered on codewords are disjoint and the balls of radius ''t''+1 cover the space, possibly with some overlaps.&lt;ref&gt;McWilliams and Sloane, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Another way to say this is that a code is ''quasi-perfect'' if its covering radius is one greater than its packing radius.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roman|1992|loc=pg. 140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic research==

Human Dynamics as a branch of statistical physics: Its main goal is to understand human behavior using methods originally developed in statistical physics. Research in this area started to gain momentum in 2005 after the publication of A.-L. Barabási's seminal paper ''The origin of bursts and heavy tails in human dynamics.''&lt;ref name="Barabasi05-1"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=A.-L. Barabási |year=2005|title=The origin of bursts and heavy tails in human dynamics.|journal=Nature|volume= 435|pages=207–211|pmid=15889093|issue=7039|doi=10.1038/nature03459|arxiv = cond-mat/0505371 |bibcode = 2005Natur.435..207B }}&lt;/ref&gt; that introduced a queuing model that was alleged to be capable of explaining the long tailed distribution of inter event times that naturally occur in human activity.

This paper spurred a burst of activity in this new area leading to not only further theoretical development of the Barabasi model,&lt;ref name="vazquez05-1"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.95.248701|author1=A.

==Other usage==

The term ''Human Dynamics'' or ''Human Dynamics as Personality Dynamics'' has also been used to describe a technique aimed at education and team building which has been subject to some skepticism, having been described in a Dutch newspaper as a personality course with esoteric (occult) roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nd.nl/artikelen/2009/november/09/skepsis-bekritiseert-occulte-schooltraining |title=Skepsis bekritiseert 'occulte' schooltraining |work=[[Nederlands Dagblad]] |date=10 November 2009 |accessdate=4 September 2014 |language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Nanninga |first=Rob |authorlink=Rob Nanninga|date=2009 |url=http://www.skepsis.nl/human-dynamics.html |title=Human Dynamics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2118">In [[mathematical analysis]], the '''initial value theorem''' is a theorem used to relate [[frequency domain]] expressions to the [[time domain]] behavior as time approaches [[zero]].&lt;ref&gt;http://fourier.eng.hmc.edu/e102/lectures/Laplace_Transform/node17.html&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also known under the abbreviation IVT.

Let

: &lt;math&gt; F(s) = \int_0^\infty f(t) e^{-st}\,dt &lt;/math&gt;

be the (one-sided) [[Laplace transform]] of ''&amp;fnof;''(''t'').  If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is bounded on &lt;math&gt;(0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt; (or if just &lt;math&gt;f(t)=O(e^{ct})&lt;/math&gt;) and &lt;math&gt;\lim_{t\to 0^+}f(t)&lt;/math&gt; exists then the initial value theorem says&lt;ref&gt;Robert H. Cannon, ''Dynamics of Physical Systems'', [[Courier Dover Publications]], 2003, page 567.&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{t\to 0}f(t)=\lim_{s\to\infty}{sF(s)}. &lt;/math&gt;

== Proof ==
Suppose first that &lt;math&gt; f&lt;/math&gt; is bounded. Say &lt;math&gt;\lim_{t\to 0^+}f(t)=\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. A change of variable in the integral
&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty f(t)e^{-st}\,dt&lt;/math&gt; shows that 
:&lt;math&gt;sF(s)=\int_0^\infty f\left(\frac ts\right)e^{-t}\,dt&lt;/math&gt;.
Since &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is bounded the [[Dominated Convergence Theorem]] shows that
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{s\to\infty}sF(s)=\int_0^\infty\alpha e^{-t}\,dt=\alpha.&lt;/math&gt;

(Of course we don't really need DCT here, one can give a very simple proof using only elementary calculus:

Start by choosing &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;\int_A^\infty e^{-t}\,dt&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;, and then
note that &lt;math&gt;\lim_{s\to\infty}f\left(\frac ts\right)=\alpha&lt;/math&gt; ''uniformly'' for &lt;math&gt;t\in(0,A]&lt;/math&gt;.)

The theorem assuming just that &lt;math&gt;f(t)=O(e^{ct})&lt;/math&gt; follows from the theorem for bounded &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;:
Define &lt;math&gt;g(t)=e^{-ct}f(t)&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is bounded, so we've shown that &lt;math&gt;g(0^+)=\lim_{s\to\infty}sG(s)&lt;/math&gt;.
But &lt;math&gt;f(0^+)=g(0^+)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G(s)=F(s+c)&lt;/math&gt;, so
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{s\to\infty}sF(s)=\lim_{s\to\infty}(s-c)F(s)=\lim_{s\to\infty}sF(s+c)
=\lim_{s\to\infty}sG(s),&lt;/math&gt;
since &lt;math&gt;\lim_{s\to\infty}F(s)=0&lt;/math&gt;

'''Jin Akiyama''' ({{lang-ja|秋山仁}}, born 1946) is a Japanese mathematician, known for his appearances on Japanese prime-time television ([[NHK]]) presenting magic tricks with mathematical explanations.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=El mago de las matemáticas: El 'showman' japonés Jin Akiyama presenta su espectáculo divulgativo en Madrid|trans-title=The Wizard of Mathematics: The Japanese showman Jin Akiyama presents his informative show in Madrid|newspaper=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]|date=April 25, 2014|first=Yuly|last=Jara|url=http://www.elmundo.es/ciencia/2014/04/25/535a5bbd268e3e3c688b457c.html}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He is director of the Mathematical Education Research Center at the [[Tokyo University of Science]], and professor emeritus at [[Tokai University]].&lt;ref name="profile"&gt;[http://jin-akiyama.com/profile.html Profile], retrieved 2017-01-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Akiyama studied mathematics at the [[Tokyo University of Science]],&lt;ref name="profile"/&gt; where one of his mentors was Takashi Hamada.
He completed a graduate degree at [[Sophia University]] under the supervision of [[Mitio Nagumo]], in [[differential equation]]s, but soon shifted his interests to [[graph theory]]. He planned to take a position in [[Ghana]], but
after conflict there caused it to be cancelled he joined the faculty at [[Nippon Medical School|Nippon Ika University]], and then moved to the U.S. for 1978 and 1979 to work with [[Frank Harary]] at the [[University of Michigan]]. In the 1990s, his interests shifted again, from graph theory to [[discrete geometry]].&lt;ref name="fahm"&gt;{{citation

'''José Babini'''  (10 May 1897,  [[Buenos Aires]] – 18 May 1984, Buenos Aires) was a mathematician, engineer, and historian of mathematics and mathematical sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Eduardo L. Ortiz, Lewis Pyenson: ''José Babini: Matemático e historiador de la ciencia'', Llull, vol. 7, 1984, pp. 77–98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph W. Dauben]], [[Christoph J. Scriba]] (eds.): [https://books.google.com/books?id=oXjMYIonXTYC&amp;pg=PA252 ''Writing the history of mathematics''], Birkhäuser 2002, pp. 252–253&lt;/ref&gt;

Babini worked for a construction company, where the owners recognized his mathematical talent and made it possible for him to pursue academic study. From 1918 he studied in Buenos Aires. In 1921 he graduated with a qualification to teach natural science and mathematics. In 1922 he received his degree as a civil engineer. Already in 1917 he contacted the well-known Spanish mathematician [[Julio Rey Pastor]]. Instead of working as a civil engineer, Babini taught mathematics at the Faculty for Industrial Chemistry of the [[National University of the Littoral|''Universidad Nacional del Litoral'']] in [[Rosario]]. There he introduced new methods of numerical analysis and was considered a leading Argentine expert in this field. He then taught at the Faculty of Sciences of Education (''Facultad de Ciencias de la Educación'') in [[Paraná, Entre Ríos]] and at the ''Colegio Nacional y la Escuela Industrial''. When Aldo Mieli in 1938 came from Paris to Argentina, he and Babini founded at the ''Universidad Nacional del Litoral'' in Rosario the ''Instituto de Historia y Filosofía de la Ciencia'' (with the support of Rey Pastor). The ''Instituto'' existed until 1943. Babini was an editor for the journal ''Archeion'' (founded by Mieli in 1919 with the name ''Archivio di Storia della Scienza'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chimisso, Cristina|title=Writing the History of the Mind: Philosophy and Science in France, 1900 to 1960s|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|pages=100–101|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i72VGVlhDc8C&amp;pg=PA100}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with Mieli edited the series ''Panorama general de historia del ciencia'' in 12 volumes. In this series, Babini wrote, with Desiderio Papp, ''El siglo de iluminismo'' on the exact sciences in the 19th century (volume number 8 of the series).

He was a major organizer of science in Argentina and a member of the national research council [[National Scientific and Technical Research Council|CONICET]]. From 1955 to 1966 he was the dean of the ''Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales'' of the National University in Buenos Aires. In 1957 he was the rector and interim director of the newly founded ''Universidad Nacional del Nordeste''. He also presided over Argentina's newly founded university publishing house EUDEBA (''Editorial Universitaria de Buenos Aires'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Boris Spivacow: Memoria de un sueño argentino, entrevistas de (interviews by) Delia Maunás|location=Buenos Aires|publisher=Ediciones Colihue|year=1995|page=57|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=istYDhdgNO0C&amp;pg=PA57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Babini was a member of the editorial board of  [[Historical Studies in the Natural Sciences|''Historical Studies in the Physical Sciences'']] and was a co-founder of the journal ''Quipu: Revista Latinoamericana de Historia de las Ciencias y la Tecnología'' (based in Mexico City).

He was Invited Speaker of the [[International Congress of Mathematicians|ICM]] in 1928 in Bologna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Babini, José|chapter=Sobre la integración aproximada de las ecuaciones diferenciales de segundo orden|title=''In:'' Atti del Congresso Internazionale dei Matematici: Bologna del 3 al 10 de settembre di 1928|volume=vol. 3|pages=103–108}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the author, co-author, or editor of numerous books (at least 70) and essays as well as translations. In particular, he also published the first books on the history of science as it developed in Argentina.

In [[combinatorial game theory]], '''Kayles''' is a simple [[impartial game]]. In the notation of [[octal games]], Kayles is denoted '''0.77'''.

== Rules ==
Kayles is played with a row of tokens, which represent bowling pins. The row may be of any length. The two players alternate; each player, on his or her turn, may remove either any one pin (a ball bowled directly at that pin), or two adjacent pins (a ball bowled to strike both). Under the [[normal play convention]], a player loses when he or she has no legal move (that is, when all the pins are gone). The game can also be played using [[misère]] rules; in this case, the player who cannot move ''wins''.

== History ==
Kayles was invented by [[Henry Dudeney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=H. E. |last=Dudeney|title=The Canterbury puzzles|isbn=0-486-42558-4|pages=118–119, puzzle 73|publisher=Dover|year=2002}}. Originally published in 1908.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="onag"&gt;Conway, John H. ''On Numbers and Games.'' Academic Press, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard K. Guy|Richard Guy]] and [[Cedric Smith (statistician)|Cedric Smith]] were first to completely analyze the normal-play version, using [[Sprague–Grundy theorem|Sprague-Grundy theory]].&lt;ref name="guy-smith"&gt;R. K. Guy and C. A. B. Smith, The ''G''-values of various games, Proc. Cambridge Philos. Soc., 52 (1956) 514–526.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="plambeck"&gt;T.E. Plambeck, [http://www.plambeck.org/oldhtml/mathematics/games/misere/MISEREPA.PDF Daisies, Kayles and the Sibert-Conway decomposition in misere octal games], Theoret. Comput. Sci (Math Games) (1992) 96 361–388.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[misère]] version was analyzed by [[William Sibert]] in 1973, but he did not publish his work until 1989.&lt;ref name="plambeck2"&gt;Plambeck, Thane. "Kayles." http://www.plambeck.org/oldhtml/mathematics/games/misere/077/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Kayles" is an Anglicization of the French ''quilles'', meaning "bowling".

== Analysis ==
Most players quickly discover that the first player has a guaranteed win in normal Kayles whenever the row length is greater than zero. This win can be achieved using a [[symmetry strategy]]. On his or her first move, the first player should move so that the row is broken into two sections of equal length. This restricts all future moves to one section or the other. Now, the first player merely imitates the second player's moves in the opposite row.

It is more interesting to ask what the [[nim-value]] is of a row of length &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. This is often denoted &lt;math&gt;K_n&lt;/math&gt;; it is a [[nimber]], not a [[number]]. By the [[Sprague–Grundy theorem]], &lt;math&gt;K_n&lt;/math&gt; is the [[mex (mathematics)|mex]] over all possible moves of the [[nim-sum]] of the [[nim-value]]s of the two resulting sections. For example,

: &lt;math&gt;K_5 = \mbox{mex}\{K_0 + K_4, K_1 + K_3, K_2 + K_2, K_0 + K_3, K_1 + K_2\},\,&lt;/math&gt;

because from a row of length 5, one can move to the positions

: &lt;math&gt;K_0 + K_4,\quad K_1 + K_3,\quad K_2 + K_2,\quad K_0 + K_3,\text{ and } K_1 + K_2.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Recursive calculation of values (starting with &lt;math&gt;K_0 = 0&lt;/math&gt;) gives the results summarized in the following table. To find the value of &lt;math&gt;K_n&lt;/math&gt; on the table, write &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;12a + b&lt;/math&gt;, and look at row a, column b:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none;"
|+ Kayles nim-values through &lt;math&gt;K_{83}&lt;/math&gt;

|}
At this point, the nim-value sequence becomes periodic&lt;ref name="plambeck2" /&gt; with period 12, so all further rows of the table are identical to the last row.

== Applications ==
{{Expand section|date=July 2016}}
Because certain positions in [[Dots and Boxes]] reduce to Kayles positions,&lt;ref name="ww"&gt;[[E. Berlekamp]], [[J. H. Conway]], R. Guy. ''Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays.'' Academic Press, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; it is helpful to understand Kayles in order to analyze a generic Dots and Boxes position.

==Computational complexity==

Under normal play, Kayles can be solved [[Time complexity#Polynomial time|in polynomial time]] using the Sprague-Grundy theory.&lt;ref name="guy-smith" /&gt;

''Node Kayles'' is a generalization of Kayles to graphs in which each bowl “knocks down” (removes) a desired vertex and all its neighboring vertices. (Alternatively, this game can be viewed as two players finding an [[Independent set (graph theory)|independent set]] together.) Schaefer (1978)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schaefer|first1=Thomas J.|title=On the complexity of some two-person perfect-information games|journal=Journal of Computer and System Sciences|date=1978|volume=16|issue=2|pages=185–225|doi=10.1016/0022-0000(78)90045-4|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022000078900454}}&lt;/ref&gt; proved that deciding the outcome of this game is [[PSPACE-complete]]. The same result holds for a partisan version of node Kayles, in which, for every node, only one of the players is allowed to choose that particular node as the knock down target.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1927">In [[mathematics]], a sequence {{math|''a''}} = {{math| (''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} of nonnegative real numbers is called a '''logarithmically concave sequence''', or a '''log-concave sequence''' for short, if {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≥ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''−1&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''+1&lt;/sub&gt;}} holds for {{math|0 &lt; ''i'' &lt; ''n'' }}.

'''Remark:''' some authors (explicitly or not) add two further hypotheses in the definition of log-concave sequences:
* {{math|''a''}}  is non-negative
* {{math|''a''}}  has no internal zeros; in other words, the support of {{math|''a''}} is an interval of {{math|'''Z'''}}.
These hypotheses mirror the ones required for [[Logarithmically_concave_function|log-concave functions]].

Sequences that fulfill the three conditions are also called '''Pòlya Frequency sequences of order 2''' ('''PF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''' sequences). Refer to chapter 2 of &lt;ref name="brenti"&gt;Brenti, F. (1989). Unimodal Log-Concave and Pòlya Frequency Sequences in Combinatorics. American Mathematical Society.&lt;/ref&gt; for a discussion on the two notions. 
For instance, the sequence {{math|(1,1,0,0,1)}} checks the concavity inequalities but not the internal zeros condition.

Examples of log-concave sequences are given by the [[binomial coefficient]]s along any row of [[Pascal's triangle]] and the [[Newton's inequalities|elementary symmetric means]] of a finite sequence of real numbers.

[[Image:Mspline order3.svg|thumb|325px|An ''M-spline'' family of order three with four interior knots.]]

==Definition==

A family of ''M-spline'' functions of order ''k'' with ''n'' free parameters is defined by a set of knots ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp; ... &amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp; ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+''k''&lt;/sub&gt; such that

* ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''t''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;
* ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''t''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+''k''&lt;/sub&gt;
* ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''t''&lt;sub&gt;''i''+''k''&lt;/sub&gt; for all ''i''

The family includes ''n'' members indexed by ''i''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,...,''n''.

==Properties==

An ''M-spline'' ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''|''k'',&amp;nbsp;''t'') has the following mathematical properties

* ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''|''k'',&amp;nbsp;''t'') is non-negative
* ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''|''k'',&amp;nbsp;''t'') is zero unless ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''t''&lt;sub&gt;''i''+''k''&lt;/sub&gt;
* ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''|''k'',&amp;nbsp;''t'') has ''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2 continuous derivatives at interior knots ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;
* ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''|''k'',&amp;nbsp;''t'') integrates to 1

==Computation==

''M-splines'' can be efficiently and stably computed using the following recursions:

For ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,

:&lt;math&gt;
M_i(x|1,t) = \frac{1}{t_{i+1}-t_i}
&lt;/math&gt;

if ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''t''&lt;sub&gt;''i''+1&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''|1,''t'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 otherwise.

For ''k''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1,

:&lt;math&gt;
M_i(x|k,t) = \frac{k\left[(x-t_i)M_i(x|k-1,t) + (t_{i+k}-x)M_{i+1}(x|k-1,t)\right]}{(k-1)(t_{i+k}-t_i)}.
&lt;/math&gt;

==Applications==

''M-splines'' can be integrated to produce a family of monotone splines called [[I-spline]]s.  ''M-splines'' can also be used directly as basis splines for regression analysis involving positive response data (constraining the regression coefficients to be non-negative).

Atiyah grew up in [[Sudan]] and [[Egypt]] but spent most of his academic life in the United Kingdom at [[University of Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge]], and in the United States at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ias.edu/people/cos/frontpage?page=6 Institute for Advanced Study: A Community of Scholars] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106144400/http://www.ias.edu/people/cos/frontpage?page=6 |date=6 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been president of the [[Royal Society]] (1990–1995), master of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] (1990–1997), chancellor of the [[University of Leicester]] (1995–2005), and president of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] (2005–2008). Since 1997, he has been an honorary professor at the [[University of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://upcommons.upc.edu/video/bitstream/2099.2/946/17/Poster05-AbelPrize-CV.pdf |title=Atiyah's CV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atiyah's mathematical collaborators include [[Raoul Bott]], [[Friedrich Hirzebruch]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Atiyah | first1 =Michael | authorlink1 = Michael Atiyah | year = 2014 | title = [[Friedrich Hirzebruch|Friedrich Ernst Peter Hirzebruch]] 17 October 1927 — 27 May 2012 | journal = [[Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society]] | volume =  60| issue =  | pages =  229–247| publisher = Royal Society | jstor =  | doi = 10.1098/rsbm.2014.0010 | url =  | format =  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Isadore Singer]], and his students include [[Graeme Segal]], [[Nigel Hitchin]] and [[Simon Donaldson]]. Together with Hirzebruch, he laid the foundations for [[topological K-theory]], an important tool in [[algebraic topology]], which, informally speaking, describes ways in which spaces can be twisted. His best known result, the [[Atiyah–Singer index theorem]], was proved with Singer in 1963 and is used in counting the number of independent solutions to [[differential equation]]s. Some of his more recent work was inspired by theoretical physics, in particular [[instanton]]s and [[monopole (mathematics)|monopole]]s, which are responsible for some subtle corrections in [[quantum field theory]].

[[File:TrinityCollegeCamGreatCourt.jpg|thumb|right|[[Trinity Great Court|Great Court]] of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where Atiyah was a student and later [[Master of Trinity College, Cambridge|Master]]]]
Atiyah was born in [[Hampstead]], [[London]], England,  the son of Jean (née Levens) and [[Edward Atiyah]].

Atiyah spent the academic year 1955–1956 at the [[Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton]], then returned to [[Cambridge University]], where he was a research fellow and assistant [[lecturer]] (1957–1958), then a university [[lecturer]] and tutorial [[fellow]] at [[Pembroke College, Cambridge]] (1958–1961). In 1961, he moved to the [[University of Oxford]], where he was a [[reader (academic rank)|reader]] and [[professor]]ial fellow at [[St Catherine's College, Oxford|St Catherine's College]] (1961–1963).&lt;ref name="cv1"/&gt; He became [[Savilian Professor of Geometry]] and a professorial fellow of [[New College, Oxford]], from 1963 to 1969. He then took up a three-year professorship at the Institute for Advanced Study in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]] after which he returned to Oxford as a [[Royal Society]] Research Professor and professorial fellow of St Catherine's College.

===Algebraic geometry (1952–1958)===
{{Main|Algebraic geometry}}
[[File:Twisted cubic curve.png|thumb|right|250px|A [[twisted cubic curve]], the subject of Atiyah's first paper]]
Atiyah's early papers on algebraic geometry (and some general papers) are reprinted in the first volume of his collected works.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an undergraduate Atiyah was interested in classical projective geometry, and wrote his first paper: a short note on [[twisted cubics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988a|loc=paper 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started research under [[W. V. D. Hodge]] and won the [[Smith's prize]] for 1954 for a [[Sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf-theoretic]] approach to [[ruled surface]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988a|loc=paper 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; which encouraged Atiyah to continue in mathematics, rather than switch to his other interests—architecture and archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988a|p= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His PhD thesis with Hodge was on a sheaf-theoretic approach to [[Solomon Lefschetz]]'s theory of integrals of the second kind on algebraic varieties, and resulted in an invitation to visit the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton for a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988a|loc=papers 3, 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in Princeton he classified [[vector bundle]]s on an [[elliptic curve]] (extending [[Alexander Grothendieck]]'s classification of vector bundles on a genus 0 curve), by showing that any vector bundle is a sum of (essentially unique) indecomposable vector bundles,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988a|loc=paper 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then showing that the space of indecomposable vector bundles of given degree and positive dimension can be identified with the elliptic curve.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988a|loc=paper 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also studied double points on surfaces,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988a|loc=paper 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; giving the first example of a [[flop (algebraic geometry)|flop]], a special birational transformation of [[3-fold]]s that was later heavily used in [[Shigefumi Mori]]'s work on [[minimal model (birational geometry)|minimal model]]s for 3-folds.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Matsuki|2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Atiyah's flop can also be used to show that the universal marked family of [[K3 surface]]s is [[non-Hausdorff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barth|Hulek|Peters|Van de Ven|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===K theory (1959–1974)===
{{Main|K-theory}}
[[File:Möbius strip.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A [[Möbius band]] is the simplest non-trivial example of a [[vector bundle]].]]
Atiyah's works on K-theory, including his book on K-theory&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; are reprinted in volume 2 of his collected works.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The simplest nontrivial example of a vector bundle is the [[Möbius band]] (pictured on the right): a strip of paper with a twist in it, which represents a rank 1 vector bundle over a circle (the circle in question being the centerline of the Möbius band). K-theory is a tool for working with higher-dimensional analogues of this example, or in other words for describing higher-dimensional twistings: elements of the K-group of a space are represented by vector bundles over it, so the Möbius band represents an element of the K-group of a circle.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Topological [[K-theory]] was discovered by Atiyah and [[Friedrich Hirzebruch]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988b|loc=paper 24}}&lt;/ref&gt; who were inspired by Grothendieck's proof of the [[Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem]] and Bott's work on the [[Bott periodicity theorem|periodicity theorem]]. This paper only discussed the zeroth K-group; they shortly after extended it to K-groups of all degrees,&lt;ref name="paper28"&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988b|loc=paper 28}}&lt;/ref&gt; giving the first (nontrivial) example of a [[generalized cohomology theory]].

Several results showed that the newly introduced K-theory was in some ways more powerful than ordinary cohomology theory. Atiyah and Todd&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988b|loc=paper 26}}&lt;/ref&gt; used K-theory to improve the lower bounds found using ordinary cohomology by Borel and Serre for the [[James number]], describing when a map from a complex [[Stiefel manifold]] to a sphere has a cross section. ([[J. Frank Adams |Adams]] and Grant-Walker later showed that the bound found by Atiyah and Todd was best possible.) Atiyah and Hirzebruch&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988a|loc=papers 30,31}}&lt;/ref&gt; used K-theory to explain some relations between [[Steenrod operation]]s and [[Todd class]]es that Hirzebruch had noticed a few years before. The original solution of the [[Hopf invariant one problem]] operations by J. F. Adams was very long and complicated, using secondary cohomology operations. Atiyah showed how primary operations in K-theory could be used to give a short solution taking only a few lines, and in joint work with Adams&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988b|loc=paper 42}}&lt;/ref&gt; also proved analogues of the result at odd primes.

[[File:Atiyah-Hirzebruch.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|Michael Atiyah and [[Friedrich Hirzebruch]] (right), the creators of [[topological K-theory]]]]
The [[Atiyah–Hirzebruch spectral sequence]] relates the ordinary cohomology of a space to its generalized cohomology theory.&lt;ref name="paper28" /&gt; (Atiyah and Hirzebruch used the case of K-theory, but their method works for all cohomology theories).

Atiyah showed&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; that for a finite group ''G'', the [[K-theory]] of its [[classifying space]], ''BG'', is isomorphic to the [[completion (ring theory)|completion]] of its [[representation ring|character ring]]:
:&lt;math&gt; K(BG) \cong R(G)^{\wedge}.&lt;/math&gt;
The same year&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|Hirzebruch|1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; they proved the result for ''G'' any [[Compact group|compact]] [[Connected space|connected]] [[Lie group]]. Although soon the result could be extended to ''all'' compact Lie groups by incorporating results from [[Graeme Segal]]'s thesis,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Segal|1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; that extension was complicated. However a simpler and more general proof was produced by introducing [[Equivariant algebraic K-theory|equivariant K-theory]], ''i.e.'' equivalence classes of ''G''-vector bundles over a compact ''G''-space ''X''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|Segal|1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was shown that under suitable conditions the completion of the equivariant K-theory of ''X'' is isomorphic to the ordinary K-theory of a space, &lt;math&gt;X_G&lt;/math&gt;, which fibred over ''BG'' with fibre ''X'':
:&lt;math&gt;K_G(X)^{\wedge} \cong K(X_G). &lt;/math&gt;

The original result then followed as a corollary by taking ''X'' to be a point: the left hand side reduced to the completion of ''R(G)'' and the right to ''K(BG)''. See [[Atiyah–Segal completion theorem]] for more details.

He defined new generalized homology and cohomology theories called bordism and [[cobordism]], and pointed out that many of the deep results on cobordism of manifolds found by [[René Thom]], [[C. T. C. Wall]], and others could be naturally reinterpreted as statements about these cohomology theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988b|loc=paper 34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these cohomology theories, in particular complex cobordism, turned out to be some of the most powerful cohomology theories known.

He introduced&lt;ref name="paper37"&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988b|loc=paper 37}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[J-group]] ''J''(''X'') of a finite complex ''X'', defined as the group of stable fiber homotopy equivalence classes of [[sphere bundle]]s; this was later studied in detail by [[J. F. Adams]] in a series of papers, leading to the [[Adams conjecture]].

With Hirzebruch he extended the [[Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem]] to complex analytic embeddings,&lt;ref name="paper37" /&gt; and in a related paper &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988b|loc=paper 36}}&lt;/ref&gt; they showed that the [[Hodge conjecture]] for integral cohomology is false. The Hodge conjecture for rational cohomology is, as of 2008, a major unsolved problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.claymath.org/millennium/Hodge_Conjecture/Official_Problem_Description.pdf|publisher=The Clay Math Institute|title=The Hodge conjecture|first=Pierre|last=Deligne|accessdate=2008-08-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827172255/http://www.claymath.org/millennium/Hodge_Conjecture/Official_Problem_Description.pdf|archivedate=27 August 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bott periodicity theorem]] was a central theme in Atiyah's work on K-theory, and he repeatedly returned to it, reworking the proof several times to understand it better. With Bott he worked out an elementary proof,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988b|loc=paper 40}}&lt;/ref&gt; and gave another version of it in his book.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988b|loc=paper 45}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Bott and [[Alexander Shapiro|Shapiro]] he analysed the relation of Bott periodicity to the periodicity of [[Clifford algebras]];&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988b|loc=paper 39}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this paper did not have a proof of the periodicity theorem, a proof along similar lines was shortly afterwards found by R. Wood.  He found a proof of several generalizations using [[elliptic operator]]s;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988b|loc=paper 46}}&lt;/ref&gt; this new proof used an idea that he used to give a particularly short and easy proof of Bott's original periodicity theorem.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988b|loc=paper 48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Index theory (1963–1984)===
[[File:Isadore Singer 1977.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Isadore Singer]] (in 1977), who worked with Atiyah on index theory]]
{{Main|Atiyah–Singer index theorem}}
Atiyah's work on index theory is reprinted in volumes 3 and 4 of his collected works.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988c}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988d}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The index of a differential operator is closely related to the number of independent solutions (more precisely, it is the differences of the numbers of independent solutions of the differential operator and its adjoint). There are many hard and fundamental problems in mathematics that can easily be reduced to the problem of finding the number of independent solutions of some differential operator, so if one has some means of finding the index of a differential operator these problems can often be solved. This is what the Atiyah–Singer index theorem does: it gives a formula for the index of certain differential operators, in terms of topological invariants that look quite complicated but are in practice usually straightforward to calculate.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Several deep theorems, such as the [[Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem]], are special cases of the Atiyah–Singer index theorem. In fact the index theorem gave a more powerful result, because its proof applied to all compact complex manifolds, while Hirzebruch's proof only worked for projective manifolds. There were also many new applications: a typical one is calculating the dimensions of the moduli spaces of instantons. The index theorem can also be run "in reverse": the index is obviously an integer, so the formula for it must also give an integer, which sometimes gives subtle integrality conditions on invariants of manifolds. A typical example of this is [[Rochlin's theorem]], which follows from the index theorem.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

The index problem for [[elliptic differential operator]]s was posed in 1959 by [[Israil Gelfand|Gel'fand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gel'fand|1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; He noticed the homotopy invariance of the index, and asked for a formula for it by means of [[topological invariant]]s. Some of the motivating examples included the [[Riemann–Roch theorem]] and its generalization the [[Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem]], and the [[Hirzebruch signature theorem]]. [[Friedrich Hirzebruch|Hirzebruch]] and [[Armand Borel|Borel]] had proved the integrality of the [[Â genus]] of a spin manifold, and Atiyah suggested that this integrality could be explained if it were the index of the [[Dirac operator]] (which was rediscovered by Atiyah and Singer in 1961).

The first announcement of the Atiyah–Singer theorem was their 1963 paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|Singer|1963}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proof sketched in this announcement was inspired by Hirzebruch's proof of the [[Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem]] and was never published by them, though it is described in the book by Palais.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palais|1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their first published proof &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|Singer|1968a}}&lt;/ref&gt; was more similar to Grothendieck's proof of the [[Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem]], replacing the [[cobordism]] theory of the first proof with [[K-theory]], and they used this approach to give proofs of various generalizations in a sequence of papers from 1968 to 1971.

Instead of just one elliptic operator, one can consider a family of elliptic operators parameterized by some space ''Y''. In this case the index is an element of the K-theory of ''Y'', rather than an integer.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988c|loc=paper 67}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the operators in the family are real, then the index lies in the real K-theory of ''Y''. This gives a little extra information, as the map from the real K theory of ''Y'' to the complex K theory is not always injective.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988c|loc=paper 68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Graeme Segal.jpeg|thumb|right|Atiyah's former student [[Graeme Segal]] (in 1982), who worked with Atiyah on equivariant K-theory]]
With Bott, Atiyah found an analogue of the [[Lefschetz fixed-point formula]] for elliptic operators, giving the Lefschetz number of an endomorphism of an [[elliptic complex]] in terms of a sum over the fixed points of the endomorphism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988c|loc=papers 61, 62, 63}}&lt;/ref&gt; As special cases their formula included the [[Weyl character formula]], and several new results about elliptic curves with complex multiplication, some of which were initially disbelieved by experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988c|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Atiyah and Segal combined this fixed point theorem with the index theorem as follows.
If there is a compact [[group action]] of a group ''G'' on the compact manifold ''X'', commuting with the elliptic operator, then one can replace ordinary K theory in the index theorem with [[Equivariant algebraic K-theory|equivariant K-theory]].
For trivial groups ''G'' this gives the index theorem, and for a finite group ''G'' acting with isolated fixed points it gives the Atiyah–Bott fixed point theorem. In general it gives the index as a sum over fixed point submanifolds of the group ''G''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988c|loc=paper 65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atiyah&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988c|loc=paper 73}}&lt;/ref&gt; solved a problem asked independently by [[Lars Hörmander|Hörmander]] and Gel'fand, about whether complex powers of analytic functions define [[Distribution (mathematics)|distributions]]. Atiyah used [[Heisuke Hironaka|Hironaka]]'s resolution of singularities to answer this affirmatively. An ingenious and elementary solution was found at about the same time by [[J. Bernstein]], and discussed by Atiyah.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988a|loc=paper 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an application of the equivariant index theorem, Atiyah and Hirzebruch showed that manifolds with effective circle actions have vanishing [[Â-genus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988c|loc=paper 74}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Lichnerowicz showed that if a manifold has a metric of positive scalar curvature then the Â-genus vanishes.)

With [[Elmer Rees]], Atiyah studied the problem of the relation between topological and holomorphic vector bundles on projective space. They solved the simplest unknown case, by showing that all rank 2 vector bundles over projective 3-space have a holomorphic structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988c|loc=paper 76}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geoffrey Horrocks|Horrocks]] had previously found some non-trivial examples of such vector bundles, which were later used by Atiyah in his study of instantons on the 4-sphere.

[[File:Raoul Bott 1986.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Raoul Bott]], who worked with Atiyah on fixed point formulas and several other topics]]
Atiyah, Bott and [[Vijay Kumar Patodi|Vijay K. Patodi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|Bott|Patodi|1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; gave a new proof of the index theorem using the [[heat equation]].

If the [[manifold]] is allowed to have boundary, then some restrictions must be put on the domain of the elliptic operator in order to ensure a finite index. These conditions can be local (like demanding that the sections in the domain vanish at the boundary) or more complicated global conditions (like requiring that the sections in the domain solve some differential equation). The local case was worked out by Atiyah and Bott, but they showed that many interesting operators (e.g., the [[signature operator]]) do not admit local boundary conditions. To handle these operators, Atiyah, Patodi and Singer introduced global boundary conditions equivalent to attaching a cylinder to the manifold along the boundary and then restricting the domain to those sections that are square integrable along the cylinder, and also introduced the [[Atiyah–Patodi–Singer eta invariant]]. This resulted in a series of papers on spectral asymmetry,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988d|loc=papers 80–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were later unexpectedly used in theoretical physics, in particular in Witten's work on anomalies.

[[File:Schlierenfoto Mach 1-2 Pfeilflügel - NASA.jpg|thumb|right|The lacunas discussed by Petrovsky, Atiyah, Bott and Gårding are similar to the spaces between shockwaves of a supersonic object.]]
The fundamental solutions of linear [[hyperbolic partial differential equation]]s often have [[Petrovsky lacuna]]s: regions where they vanish identically. These were studied in 1945 by [[I. G. Petrovsky]], who found topological conditions describing which regions were lacunas.
In collaboration with Bott and [[Lars Gårding]], Atiyah wrote three papers updating and generalizing Petrovsky's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988d|loc=papers 84, 85, 86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atiyah&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed how to extend the index theorem to some non-compact manifolds, acted on by a discrete group with compact quotient. The kernel of the elliptic operator is in general infinite-dimensional in this case, but it is possible to get a finite index using the dimension of a module over a [[von Neumann algebra]]; this index is in general real rather than integer valued. This version is called the ''L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; index theorem,'' and was used by Atiyah and Schmid&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|Schmid|1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; to give a geometric construction, using square integrable harmonic spinors, of Harish-Chandra's [[discrete series representation]]s of [[semisimple Lie group]]s. In the course of this work they found a more elementary proof of Harish-Chandra's fundamental theorem on the local integrability of characters of Lie groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988d|loc=paper 91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With H. Donnelly and I. Singer, he extended Hirzebruch's formula (relating the signature defect at cusps of Hilbert modular surfaces to values of L-functions) from real quadratic fields to all totally real fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988d|loc=papers 92, 93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gauge theory (1977–1985)===
{{Main|Gauge theory}}
[[File:Camposcargas.PNG|thumb|right|On the left, two nearby monopoles of the same polarity repel each other, and on the right two nearby monopoles of opposite polarity form a [[dipole]]. These are abelian monopoles; the non-abelian ones studied by Atiyah are more complicated.]]
Many of his papers on gauge theory and related topics are reprinted in volume 5 of his collected works.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|year1=1988e}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common theme of these papers is the study of moduli spaces of solutions to certain [[non-linear partial differential equation]]s, in particular the equations for instantons and monopoles. This often involves finding a subtle correspondence between solutions of two seemingly quite different equations. An early example of this which Atiyah used repeatedly is the [[Penrose transform]], which can sometimes convert solutions of a non-linear equation over some real manifold into solutions of some linear holomorphic equations over a different complex manifold.

In a series of papers with several authors, Atiyah classified all instantons on 4-dimensional Euclidean space. It is more convenient to classify instantons on a sphere as this is compact, and this is essentially equivalent to classifying instantons on Euclidean space as this is conformally equivalent to a sphere and the equations for instantons are conformally invariant. With Hitchin and Singer&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988e|loc=papers 94, 97}}&lt;/ref&gt; he calculated the dimension of the moduli space of irreducible self-dual connections (instantons) for any principal bundle over a compact 4-dimensional Riemannian manifold (the [[Atiyah–Hitchin–Singer theorem]]). For example, the dimension of the space of SU&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; instantons of rank ''k''&gt;0 is 8''k''−3. To do this they used the Atiyah–Singer index theorem to calculate the dimension of the tangent space of the moduli space at a point; the tangent space is essentially the space of solutions of an elliptic differential operator, given by the linearization of the non-linear Yang–Mills equations. These moduli spaces were later used by Donaldson to construct his [[Donaldson invariant|invariants of 4-manifolds]].
Atiyah and Ward used the Penrose correspondence to reduce the classification of all instantons on the 4-sphere to a problem in algebraic geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988e|loc=paper 95}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Hitchin he used ideas of Horrocks to solve this problem, giving the [[ADHM construction]] of all instantons on a sphere; Manin and Drinfeld found the same construction at the same time, leading to a joint paper by all four authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988e|loc=paper 96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atiyah reformulated this construction using [[quaternion]]s and wrote up a leisurely account of this classification of instantons on Euclidean space as a book.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988e|loc=paper 99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
Atiyah's work on instanton moduli spaces was used in Donaldson's work on [[Donaldson theory]]. Donaldson showed that the moduli space of (degree 1) instantons over a compact simply connected [[4-manifold]] with positive definite intersection form can be compactified to give a cobordism between the manifold and a sum of copies of complex projective space. He deduced from this that the intersection form must be a sum of one-dimensional ones, which led to several spectacular applications to smooth 4-manifolds, such as the existence of non-equivalent [[smooth structure]]s on 4-dimensional Euclidean space. Donaldson went on to use the other moduli spaces studied by Atiyah to define [[Donaldson invariant]]s, which revolutionized the study of smooth 4-manifolds, and showed that they were more subtle than smooth manifolds in any other dimension, and also quite different from topological 4-manifolds. Atiyah described some of these results in a survey talk.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988e|loc=paper 112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Green's function]]s for linear partial differential equations can often be found by using the [[Fourier transform]] to convert this into an algebraic problem. Atiyah used a non-linear version of this idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988e|loc=paper 101}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used the Penrose transform to convert the Green's function for the conformally invariant Laplacian into a complex analytic object, which turned out to be essentially the diagonal embedding of the Penrose twistor space into its square. This allowed him to find an explicit formula for the conformally invariant Green's function on a 4-manifold.

In his paper with Jones,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988e|loc=paper 102}}&lt;/ref&gt; he studied the topology of the moduli space of SU(2) instantons over a 4-sphere. They showed that the natural map from this moduli space to the space of all connections induces epimorphisms of [[homology group]]s in a certain range of dimensions, and suggested that it might induce isomorphisms of homology groups in the same range of dimensions. This became known as the [[Atiyah–Jones conjecture]], and was later proved by several mathematicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boyer|Hurtubise|Mann|Milgram|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harder and [[M. S. Narasimhan]] described the cohomology of the [[moduli space]]s of [[stable vector bundle]]s over [[Riemann surface]]s by counting the number of points of the moduli spaces over finite fields, and then using the Weil conjectures to recover the cohomology over the complex numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harder|Narasimhan|1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Atiyah and [[R. Bott]] used [[Morse theory]] and the [[Yang–Mills equation]]s over a [[Riemann surface]] to reproduce and extending the results of Harder and Narasimhan.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988e|loc=papers 104–105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An old result due to [[Issai Schur|Schur]] and Horn states that the set of possible diagonal vectors of an Hermitian matrix with given eigenvalues is the convex hull of all the permutations of the eigenvalues. Atiyah proved a generalization of this that applies to all compact [[symplectic manifold]]s acted on by a torus, showing that the image of the manifold under the moment map is a convex polyhedron,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988e|loc=paper 106}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with Pressley gave a related generalization to infinite-dimensional loop groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988e|loc=paper 108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duistermaat and Heckman found a striking formula, saying that the push-forward of the [[Liouville measure]] of a [[moment map]] for a torus action is given exactly by the stationary phase approximation (which is in general just an asymptotic expansion rather than exact). Atiyah and Bott &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988e|loc=paper 109}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that this could be deduced from a more general formula in [[equivariant cohomology]], which was a consequence of well-known [[localization formula for equivariant cohomology|localization theorem]]s. Atiyah showed&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988e|loc=paper 110}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the moment map was closely related to [[geometric invariant theory]], and this idea was later developed much further by his student [[F. Kirwan]]. Witten shortly after applied the [[Duistermaat–Heckman formula]] to loop spaces and showed that this formally gave the Atiyah–Singer index theorem for the Dirac operator; this idea was lectured on by Atiyah.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988e|loc=paper 124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Hitchin he worked on [[magnetic monopole]]s, and studied their scattering using an idea of [[Nick Manton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988e|loc=papers 115, 116}}&lt;/ref&gt; His book &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|Hitchin|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Hitchin gives a detailed description of their work on magnetic monopoles. The main theme of the book is a study of a moduli space of magnetic monopoles; this has a natural Riemannian metric, and a key point is that this metric is complete and [[hyperkähler]]. The metric is then used to study the scattering of two monopoles, using a suggestion of N. Manton that the geodesic flow on the moduli space is the low energy approximation to the scattering. For example, they show that a head-on collision between two monopoles results in 90-degree scattering, with the direction of scattering depending on the relative phases of the two monopoles. He also studied monopoles on hyperbolic space.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988e|loc=paper 118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atiyah showed&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988e|loc=paper 117}}&lt;/ref&gt; that instantons in 4 dimensions can be identified with instantons in 2 dimensions, which are much easier to handle. There is of course a catch: in going from 4 to 2 dimensions the structure group of the gauge theory changes from a finite-dimensional group to an infinite-dimensional loop group. This gives another example where the moduli spaces of solutions of two apparently unrelated nonlinear partial differential equations turn out to be essentially the same.

Atiyah and Singer found that anomalies in quantum field theory could be interpreted in terms of index theory of the Dirac operator;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988e|loc=papers 119, 120, 121}}&lt;/ref&gt; this idea later became widely used by physicists.

===Later work (1986 onwards)===
[[File:Edward Witten at Harvard.jpg|thumb|right|[[Edward Witten]], whose work on invariants of manifolds and [[topological quantum field theories]] was influenced by Atiyah]]
Many of the papers in the 6th volume&lt;ref&gt;{{harvs|nb|first=Michael|last=Atiyah|year1=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; of his collected works are surveys, obituaries, and general talks. Since its publication, Atiyah has continued to publish, including several surveys, a popular book,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another paper with [[Graeme Segal|Segal]] on twisted K-theory.

One paper&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|2004|loc=paper 127}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a detailed study of the [[Dedekind eta function]] from the point of view of topology and the index theorem.

Several of his papers from around this time study the connections between quantum field theory, knots, and Donaldson theory. He introduced the concept of a [[topological quantum field theory]], inspired by Witten's work and Segal's definition of a conformal field theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|2004|loc=paper 132}}&lt;/ref&gt; His book&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes the new [[knot invariant]]s found by [[Vaughan Jones]] and [[Edward Witten]] in terms of [[topological quantum field theories]], and his paper with L. Jeffrey&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|2004|loc=paper 139}}&lt;/ref&gt; explains Witten's Lagrangian giving the [[Donaldson invariant]]s.

He studied [[skyrmion]]s with Nick Manton,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|2004|loc=papers 141, 142}}&lt;/ref&gt; finding a relation with magnetic monopoles and [[instanton]]s, and giving a conjecture for the structure of the moduli space of two skyrmions as a certain subquotient of complex projective 3-space.

Several papers&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|2004|loc=papers 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168}}&lt;/ref&gt; were inspired by a question of [https://research-information.bristol.ac.uk/en/persons/jonathan-m-robbins(60101278-f877-4e14-946f-262f3b95d5ae).html Jonathan Robbins] (called the [[Berry–Robbins problem]]), who asked if there is a map from the configuration space of ''n'' points in 3-space to the flag manifold of the unitary group. Atiyah gave an affirmative answer to this question, but felt his solution was too computational and studied a conjecture that would give a more natural solution. He also related the question to [[Nahm's equation]], and introduced the [[Atiyah conjecture on configurations]].

With [[Juan Maldacena]] and [[Cumrun Vafa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|2004|loc=paper 169}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[E. Witten]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|2004|loc=paper 170}}&lt;/ref&gt; he described the dynamics of [[M-theory]] on [[Joyce manifold|manifolds with G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; holonomy]]. These papers seem to be the first time that Atiyah has worked on exceptional Lie groups.

In his papers with [[Michael J. Hopkins|M. Hopkins]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|2004|loc=paper 172}}&lt;/ref&gt; and G. Segal&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|2004|loc=paper 173}}&lt;/ref&gt; he returned to his earlier interest of K-theory, describing some twisted forms of K-theory with applications in theoretical physics.

In October 2016, he claimed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last=Atiyah |first=Michael |eprint=1610.09366 |title=The Non-Existent Complex 6-Sphere}}&lt;/ref&gt; a short proof of the non-existence of [[Complex manifold|complex structures]] on the 6-sphere. His proof, like many predecessors, is considered flawed by the mathematical community, even after the proof was rewritten in a revised form.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://mathoverflow.net/questions/263301/what-is-the-current-understanding-regarding-complex-structures-on-the-6-sphere|title=What is the current understanding regarding complex structures on the 6-sphere?

In September 2018, at the 2018 [[Klaus_Tschira_Foundation|Heidelberg Laureate Forum]], he claimed a simple proof of the [[Riemann hypothesis]], one of the [[Millennium_Prize_Problems|most important and challenging problems]] in mathematics. His claim was met with skepticism from the mathematical community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/09/skepticism-surrounds-renowned-mathematician-s-attempted-proof-160-year-old-hypothesis|title=Skepticism surrounds renowned mathematician’s attempted proof of 160-year-old hypothesis|date=2018-09-24|work=Science {{!}} AAAS|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2180504-riemann-hypothesis-likely-remains-unsolved-despite-claimed-proof/|title=Riemann hypothesis likely remains unsolved despite claimed proof|accessdate=24 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5316">In mathematics, a '''nearly Kähler manifold''' is an [[almost Hermitian manifold]] &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, with [[almost complex structure]] &lt;math&gt; J&lt;/math&gt;,
such that the (2,1)-tensor &lt;math&gt;\nabla J &lt;/math&gt; is [[skew-symmetric matrix|skew-symmetric]]. So,

:&lt;math&gt; (\nabla_X J)X =0 &lt;/math&gt;

for every vector field &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.

In particular, a [[Kähler manifold]] is nearly Kähler. The converse is not true. 
For example, the nearly Kähler six-sphere &lt;math&gt;S^6&lt;/math&gt; is an example of a nearly Kähler manifold that is not Kähler.&lt;ref&gt;

|title=Handbook of Differential Geometry| volume =II |ISBN =978-0-444-82240-6
|editors=Franki Dillen and Leopold Verstraelen
|publisher=[[North Holland]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The familiar almost complex structure on the six-sphere is not induced by a complex atlas on &lt;math&gt;S^6&lt;/math&gt;.
Usually, non Kählerian nearly Kähler manifolds are called "strict nearly Kähler manifolds".

Nearly Kähler manifolds, also known as almost Tachibana manifolds, were studied by Shun-ichi Tachibana in 1959&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|first=Bang-Yen|last=Chen|title=Pseudo-Riemannian geometry, [delta]-invariants and applications|publisher=[[World Scientific]]|year=2011|isbn=978-981-4329-63-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then by [[Alfred Gray (mathematician)|Alfred Gray]] from 1970 on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|

For example, it was proved that any 6-dimensional strict nearly Kähler manifold is an [[Einstein manifold]] and has vanishing first Chern class
(in particular, this implies spin). 
In the 1980s, strict nearly Kähler manifolds obtained a lot of consideration because of their relation to [[Killing spinor|Killing
spinors]]: [[Thomas Friedrich (Mathematiker)|Thomas Friedrich]] and Ralf Grunewald showed that a 6-dimensional Riemannian manifold admits
a Riemannian Killing spinor if and only if it is nearly Kähler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|

Geom. |volume=3 |year=1985 |pages=265-273}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was later given a more fundamental  explanation &lt;ref&gt;B&amp;auml;r, Christian (1993) Real Killing spinors and holonomy. Comm. Math. Phys. 154, 509–521. &lt;/ref&gt; by Christian B&amp;auml;r, who pointed out  that
these  are exactly the 6-manifolds for which the corresponding 7-dimensional Riemannian cone has holonomy G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. 

The only compact 6-manifolds known to admit strict nearly Kähler metrics are &lt;math&gt;S^6,\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^3, \mathbb{P}(T\mathbb{CP}_2)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;S^3\times S^3&lt;/math&gt;. Each of these admits such a unique nearly K&amp;auml;hler metric that is also homogeneous, and these examples are in fact  the only compact  homogeneous strictly nearly Kähler 6-manifolds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|
author=Butruille, Jean-Baptiste|
title= Classification of homogeneous nearly Kähler manifolds|
journal=Ann. Global Anal. Geom. |volume=27 |year=2005 |pages=201-225}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, Foscolo and Haskins recently showed that &lt;math&gt;S^6&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S^3\times S^3&lt;/math&gt;  also admit strict nearly Kähler metrics that are not homogeneous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article| author = Foscolo, Lorenzo and Haskins, Mark | title = New G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-holonomy cones and exotic nearly Kähler structures on S&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; and S&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; x S&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; | journal = Ann. of Math. |series =  2 | volume = 185| year = 2017|number = 1 | pages = 59--130}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

B&amp;auml;r's observation about the  holonomy of Riemannian cones might seem to indicate that the nearly-Kähler condition is 
most natural and interesting in dimension 6.  This actually borne out by a theorem of  Nagy, who proved that any strict,  complete nearly Kähler manifold is locally a Riemannian product of homogeneous nearly Kähler spaces, twistor spaces over quaternion-Kähler manifolds, and 6-dimensional nearly Kähler manifolds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|

journal=Asian J. Math. |volume=6 |year=2002 |pages=481-504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly Kähler manifolds are also an interesting class of manifolds admitting a metric connection with
parallel totally antisymmetric torsion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|

Nearly Kähler manifolds should not be confused with  [[almost Kähler manifold|almost Kähler manifolds]].
An almost Kähler manifold &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is an almost Hermitian manifold with a closed [[Kähler manifold|Kähler form]]:
&lt;math&gt;d\omega = 0&lt;/math&gt;. The Kähler form or fundamental 2-form &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\omega(X,Y) = g(JX,Y), &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the metric on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. The  nearly Kähler condition and the almost Kähler condition are essentially exclusive: an almost Hermitian manifold is both nearly Kähler and almost Kahler if and only if it is Kähler.

The [[reconstruction conjecture]] of [[Stanislaw Ulam]] is one of the best-known open problems in [[graph theory]]. Using the terminology of [[Frank Harary]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation
 | last = Harary | first = Frank | author-link = Frank Harary

 | mr = 0256911

Many results supporting the digraph reconstruction conjecture appeared between 1964 and 1976. However, this conjecture was proved to be false when P. K. Stockmeyer discovered several infinite families of counterexample pairs of digraphs (including tournaments) of arbitrarily large order.&lt;ref name="s77"&gt;{{citation

Stockmeyer even observed that “perhaps the considerable effort being spent in attempts to prove the (reconstruction) conjecture should be balanced by more serious attempts to construct counterexamples.”&lt;ref name="s77"/&gt;

In 1979, Ramachandran revived the digraph reconstruction conjecture in a slightly weaker form called the '''new digraph reconstruction conjecture'''. In a digraph, the number of arcs incident from (respectively, to) a vertex ''v'' is called the [[outdegree]] ([[indegree]]) of ''v'' and is denoted by ''od''(''v'') (respectively, ''id''(''v'')). The new digraph conjecture may be stated as follows:

::'''If '''''D''''' and '''''E''''' are any two digraphs and '''ƒ''' is a bijection from '''''V''(''D'')''' to '''''V''(''E'')''' such that '''''D''\{''v''}''' and '''''E''\{ƒ(''v'')}''' are isomorphic and '''(''od''(''v''),''id''(''v''))&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''od''(ƒ(''v'')),''id''(ƒ(''v'')))''' for all '''''v''''' in '''''V''(''D'')''', then '''''D''''' and '''''E''''' are isomorphic.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The new digraph reconstruction conjecture reduces to the reconstruction conjecture in the undirected case, because if all the vertex-deleted subgraphs of two graphs are isomorphic, then the corresponding vertices must have the same degree. Thus, the new digraph reconstruction conjecture is stronger than the reconstruction conjecture, but weaker than the disproved digraph reconstruction conjecture. Several families of digraphs have been shown to satisfy the new digraph reconstruction conjecture and these include all the digraphs in the known counterexample pairs to the digraph reconstruction conjecture.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9115">In [[mathematics]], particularly [[linear algebra]], an '''orthonormal basis''' for an [[inner product space]] ''V'' with finite [[dimension (linear algebra)|dimension]] is a [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] for ''V'' whose vectors are [[orthonormal]], that is, they are all [[unit vector]]s and [[Orthogonality|orthogonal]] to each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Lay | first=David C. | title=Linear Algebra and Its Applications | publisher=[[Addison–Wesley]] | year=2006 | edition = 3rd | isbn=0-321-28713-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Strang | first=Gilbert | authorlink=Gilbert Strang | title=Linear Algebra and Its Applications | publisher=[[Brooks Cole]] | year=2006 | edition = 4th | isbn=0-03-010567-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Axler | first = Sheldon | title = Linear Algebra Done Right | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | year = 2002 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 0-387-98258-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the [[standard basis]] for a [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is an orthonormal basis, where the relevant inner product is the [[dot product]] of vectors.  The [[Image (mathematics)|image]] of the standard basis under a [[rotation (mathematics)|rotation]] or [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] (or any [[orthogonal transformation]]) is also orthonormal, and every orthonormal basis for '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; arises in this fashion.

For a general inner product space ''V'', an orthonormal basis can be used to define normalized [[orthogonal coordinates]] on ''V''.  Under these coordinates, the inner product becomes a dot product of vectors.  Thus the presence of an orthonormal basis reduces the study of a [[Dimension (vector space)|finite-dimensional]] inner product space to the study of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; under dot product.  Every finite-dimensional inner product space has an orthonormal basis, which may be obtained from an arbitrary basis using the [[Gram–Schmidt process]].

In [[functional analysis]], the concept of an orthonormal basis can be generalized to arbitrary (infinite-dimensional) [[inner product space]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Rudin | first=Walter | authorlink=Walter Rudin | title=Real &amp; Complex Analysis | publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] | year=1987 | isbn=0-07-054234-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Given a pre-Hilbert space ''H'', an orthonormal basis for ''H'' is an orthonormal set of vectors with the property that every vector in ''H'' can be written as an [[infinite linear combination]] of the vectors in the basis.  In this case, the orthonormal basis is sometimes called a '''Hilbert basis''' for ''H''.  Note that an orthonormal basis in this sense is not generally a [[Hamel basis]], since infinite linear combinations are required.  Specifically, the [[linear span]] of the basis must be [[Dense set|dense]] in ''H'', but it may not be the entire space.

If we go on to [[Hilbert space]]s, a non-orthonormal set of vectors having the same linear span as an orthonormal basis may not be a basis at all. For instance, any [[square-integrable function]] on the interval [−1, 1] can be expressed ([[almost everywhere]]) as an infinite sum of [[Legendre polynomials]] (an orthonomal basis), but not necessarily as an infinite sum of the [[monomial]]s ''x&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''.

==Examples==
* The set of vectors {''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(1,&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;0), ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(0,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;0), ''e''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(0,&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;1)} (the standard basis) forms an orthonormal basis of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.
::'''Proof:''' A straightforward computation shows that the inner products of these vectors equals zero, {{nowrap|1={{langle}}''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{rangle}} = {{langle}}''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''e''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;{{rangle}} = {{langle}}''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''e''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;{{rangle}} = 0}} and that each of their magnitudes equals one, ||''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;|| = ||''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|| = ||''e''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;|| = 1. This means that {{nowrap|{''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''e''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;} }} is an orthonormal set.  All vectors {{nowrap|(''x'', ''y'', ''z'')}} in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; can be expressed as a sum of the basis vectors scaled 
:::&lt;math&gt; (x,y,z) = xe_1 + ye_2 + ze_3, \, &lt;/math&gt;
::so {{nowrap|{''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''e''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;} }} spans '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and hence must be a basis. It may also be shown that the standard basis rotated about an axis through the origin or reflected in a plane through the origin forms an orthonormal basis of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.
* Notice that an [[Orthogonal transformation|orthogonal transformation]] of the standard inner-product space &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{R}^n,\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle)&lt;/math&gt; can be used to construct other orthogonal bases of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;.
* The set {{nowrap|{''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''n'' ∈ '''Z'''} }} with {{nowrap|1=''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') = [[exponential function|exp]](2π''inx'')}} forms an orthonormal basis of the space of functions with finite Lebesgue integrals, L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;([0,1]), with respect to the [[2-norm]]. This is fundamental to the study of [[Fourier series]].
* The set {{nowrap|{''e''&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''b'' ∈ ''B''} }} with {{nowrap|1=''e''&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt;(''c'') = 1}} if {{nowrap|1=''b'' = ''c''}} and 0 otherwise forms an orthonormal basis of ℓ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''B'').
* Eigenfunctions of a [[Sturm–Liouville eigenproblem]].
* An [[orthogonal matrix]] is a matrix whose column vectors form an orthonormal set.

==Basic formula==
If ''B'' is an orthogonal basis of ''H'', then every element ''x'' of ''H'' may be written as

:&lt;math&gt;x=\sum_{b\in B}{\langle x,b\rangle\over\lVert b\rVert^2} b.&lt;/math&gt;

When ''B'' is orthonormal, this simplifies to

:&lt;math&gt;x=\sum_{b\in B}\langle x,b\rangle b&lt;/math&gt;

and the square of the [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] of ''x'' can be given by

:&lt;math&gt;\|x\|^2=\sum_{b\in B}|\langle x,b\rangle |^2.&lt;/math&gt;

Even if ''B'' is [[Uncountable set|uncountable]], only countably many terms in this sum will be non-zero, and the expression is therefore well-defined. This sum is also called the ''[[Generalized Fourier series|Fourier expansion]]'' of ''x'', and the formula is usually known as [[Parseval's identity]].

If ''B'' is an orthonormal basis of ''H'', then ''H'' is ''isomorphic'' to ''ℓ''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''B'') in the following sense: there exists a [[bijective]] [[linear operator|linear]] map {{nowrap|Φ : ''H'' → ''ℓ''&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;(''B'')}} such that

:&lt;math&gt;\langle\Phi(x),\Phi(y)\rangle=\langle x,y\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

for all ''x'' and ''y'' in ''H''.

==Incomplete orthogonal sets==
Given a Hilbert space ''H'' and a set ''S'' of mutually orthogonal vectors in ''H'', we can take the smallest closed linear subspace ''V'' of ''H'' containing ''S''. Then ''S'' will be an orthogonal basis of ''V''; which may of course be smaller than ''H'' itself, being an ''incomplete'' orthogonal set, or be ''H'', when it is a ''complete'' orthogonal set.

==Existence==
Using [[Zorns lemma|Zorn's lemma]] and the [[Gram–Schmidt process]] (or more simply well-ordering and transfinite recursion), one can show that ''every'' Hilbert space admits a basis and thus an orthonormal basis; furthermore, any two orthonormal bases of the same space have the same [[cardinal number|cardinality]] (this can be proven in a manner akin to that of the proof of the usual [[dimension theorem for vector spaces]], with separate cases depending on whether  the larger basis candidate is countable or not). A Hilbert space is [[separable metric space|separable]] if and only if it admits a [[countable]] orthonormal basis. (One can prove this last statement without using the axiom of choice).

==As a homogeneous space==
{{Main|Stiefel manifold}}
The set of orthonormal bases for a space is a [[principal homogeneous space]] for the [[orthogonal group]] O(''n''), and is called the [[Stiefel manifold]] &lt;math&gt;V_n(\mathbf{R}^n)&lt;/math&gt; of orthonormal [[k-frame|''n''-frames]].

In other words, the space of orthonormal bases is like the orthogonal group, but without a choice of base point: given an orthogonal space, there is no natural choice of orthonormal basis, but once one is given one, there is a one-to-one correspondence between bases and the orthogonal group.
Concretely, a linear map is determined by where it sends a given basis: just as an invertible map can take any basis to any other basis, an orthogonal map can take any ''orthogonal'' basis to any other ''orthogonal'' basis.

==History==
PathVisio was created primarily at [[Maastricht University]] and [[Gladstone Institutes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pathvisio.org/about/|accessdate=10 February 2014|title=About/Core development team}}&lt;/ref&gt; The software is developed in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and it's also used as part of the [[WikiPathways]] framework as an applet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pico|first=AR|author2=Kelder T |author3=van Iersel MP |author4=Hanspers K |author5=Conklin BR |title=WikiPathways: Pathway Editing for the People|date=22 July 2008|page=e184|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0060184|url=http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.0060184|accessdate=19 September 2013|pmid=18651794|pmc=2475545|volume=6|issue=7|display-authors=etal |journal=PLoS Biology}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Starting from version 3.0 (released in 2012) plugins are [[OSGi]] compliant and a [http://www.pathvisio.org/plugins/plugins-repo/ plugin directory], describing them, was developed.
In 2015 version 3.2 was released. This was the first signed version with a certificate issued by a certification authority. Many of the running issues introduced by java 1.7 and 1.8 with the new security rules were solved.
Since 2013 a javascript version (PVJS) is being developed to replace the applet. From 2015 it also allows small edits and in the future it will be a full editor.

      <comment>Clarified the definition of generic filter (in particular, dense subset versus family of dense subsets)</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3342">In [[axiomatic set theory]], the '''Rasiowa–Sikorski lemma''' (named after [[Helena Rasiowa]] and [[Roman Sikorski]]) is one of the most fundamental facts used in the technique of [[forcing (mathematics)|forcing]]. In the area of forcing, a subset ''E'' of a forcing notion (''P'', ≤) is called '''dense in ''P''''' if for any ''p'' ∈ ''P'' there is ''e'' ∈ ''E'' with ''e'' ≤ ''p''. If ''D'' is a family of dense subsets of ''P'', a [[filter (mathematics)|filter]] ''F'' in ''P'' is called ''D''-[[generic filter|generic]] if

:''F'' ∩ ''E'' &amp;ne; ∅ for all ''E'' ∈ ''D''.

Now we can state the '''Rasiowa–Sikorski lemma''':

:Let (''P'', ≤) be a [[poset]] and ''p'' ∈ ''P''. If ''D'' is a [[countable]] family of [[Dense order|dense]] subsets of ''P'' then there exists a ''D''-generic [[filter (mathematics)|filter]] ''F'' in ''P'' such that ''p'' ∈ ''F''.

== Proof of the Rasiowa–Sikorski lemma ==
The proof runs as follows: since ''D'' is countable, one can enumerate the dense subsets of ''P''  as ''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''D''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …. By assumption, there exists ''p'' ∈ ''P''. Then by density, there exists ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''p'' with ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Repeating, one gets … ≤ ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''p'' with ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. Then ''G'' = { ''q''  ∈ ''P'': ∃ ''i'', ''q'' ≥ ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;} is a ''D''-generic filter.

The Rasiowa–Sikorski lemma can be viewed as a weaker form of an equivalent to [[Martin's axiom]]. More specifically, it is equivalent to MA(&lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;).

== Examples ==
*For (''P'', ≥) = (Func(''X'', ''Y''), ⊂), the poset of [[partial function]]s from ''X'' to ''Y'', define ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; = {''s'' ∈ ''P'': ''x'' ∈ dom(''s'')}. If ''X'' is countable, the Rasiowa–Sikorski lemma yields a {''D''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;: ''x'' ∈ ''X''}-generic filter ''F'' and thus a function ∪ ''F'': ''X'' → ''Y''.
*If we adhere to the notation used in dealing with ''D''-[[generic filter]]s, {''H'' ∪ ''G''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;: ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;''P''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;} forms an ''H''-[[generic filter]].
*If ''D'' is uncountable, but of [[cardinality]] strictly smaller than &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt; and the poset has the [[countable chain condition]], we can instead use [[Martin's axiom]].

'''René Frédéric Thom''' ({{IPA-fr|ʁəne tɔm|lang}}; 2 September 1923 – 25 October 2002) was a French [[mathematician]]. He made his reputation as a [[topologist]], moving on to aspects of what would be called [[singularity theory]]; he became world-famous among the wider academic community and the educated general public for one aspect of this latter interest, his work as founder of [[catastrophe theory]] (later developed by [[Erik Christopher Zeeman]]). He received the [[Fields Medal]] in 1958.

==Biography==
René Thom was born in [[Montbéliard]], [[Doubs]]. He was educated at the [[Lycée Saint-Louis]] and the [[École Normale Supérieure]], both in Paris.  He received his PhD in 1951 from the [[University of Paris]].  His thesis, titled ''Espaces fibrés en sphères et carrés de Steenrod'' (''Sphere bundles and Steenrod squares''), was written under the direction of [[Henri Cartan]]. The foundations of [[cobordism]] theory, for which he received the [[Fields Medal]] at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] in [[Edinburgh]] in 1958, were already present in his thesis.

After a fellowship in the [[United States]],  he went on to teach at the Universities of [[Université Joseph Fourier|Grenoble]] (1953–1954) and [[University of Strasbourg|Strasbourg]] (1954–1963), where he was appointed Professor in 1957.  In 1964, he moved to the [[Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques]], in [[Bures-sur-Yvette]]. He was awarded the [[Brouwer Medal]] in 1970, the [[Grand Prix Scientifique de la Ville de Paris]] in 1974, and became a Member of the [[Académie des Sciences]] of Paris in 1976.

While René Thom is most known to the public for his development of [[catastrophe theory]] between 1968 and 1972, his earlier work was on [[differential topology]]. In the early 1950s it concerned what are now called [[Thom space]]s, [[characteristic class]]es, [[cobordism theory]], and the [[Thom transversality theorem]]. Another example of this line of work is the [[Thom conjecture]], versions of which have been investigated using [[gauge theory]]. From  the mid 1950s he moved into [[singularity theory]], of which catastrophe theory is just one aspect, and in a series of deep (and at the time obscure) papers between 1960 and 1969 developed the theory of [[topologically stratified space|stratified sets]] and stratified maps, proving a basic stratified isotopy theorem describing the local conical structure of [[Whitney conditions|Whitney stratified sets]], now known as the [[Thom&amp;ndash;Mather isotopy theorem]]. Much of his work on stratified sets was developed so as to understand the notion of topologically stable maps, and to eventually prove the result that the set of topologically stable mappings between two smooth manifolds is a [[dense set]]. Thom's lectures on the stability of differentiable mappings, given at the [[University of Bonn]] in 1960, were written up by [[Harold Levine]] and published in the proceedings of a year long symposium on singularities at [[Liverpool University]] during 1969-70, edited by [[C. T. C. Wall]]. The proof of the density of topologically stable mappings was completed by [[John Mather (mathematician)|John Mather]] in 1970, based on the ideas developed by Thom in the previous ten years. A coherent detailed account was published in 1976 by Cristopher Gibson, Klaus Wirthmüller, Andrew du Plessis, and [[Eduard Looijenga]].

During the last twenty years of his life Thom's published work was mainly in philosophy and epistemology, and he undertook a reevaluation of [[Aristotle]]'s writings on science. In 1992, he was one of eighteen academics who sent a letter to [[Cambridge University]] protesting against plans to award [[Jacques Derrida]] an honorary doctorate.

Beyond Thom's contributions to algebraic topology, he studied differentiable mappings, through the study of [[Generic property|generic properties]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14798">[[File:Rotating Caliper 3x2.svg|thumb|Sequence of probes around the convex hull of a polygon to determine its diameter using Rotating Caliper method.]]

In [[computational geometry]], the method of '''rotating calipers''' is an [[algorithm design]] technique that can be used to solve optimization problems including finding the width or [[diameter]] of a set of points.

The method is so named because the idea is analogous to rotating a spring-loaded [[vernier caliper]] around the outside of a [[convex polygon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-cgrl.cs.mcgill.ca/~godfried/research/calipers.html "Rotating Calipers"] at Toussaint's home page&lt;/ref&gt; Every time one blade of the caliper lies flat against an edge of the polygon, it forms an [[antipodal point|antipodal pair]] with the point or edge touching the opposite blade. The complete "rotation" of the caliper around the polygon detects all antipodal pairs; the set of all pairs, viewed as a graph, forms a [[thrackle]]. The method of rotating calipers can be interpreted as the [[Duality (projective geometry)|projective dual]] of a [[sweep line algorithm]] in which the sweep is across slopes of lines rather than across {{mvar|x}}- or {{mvar|y}}-coordinates of points.

== History ==
[[File:Rotating Caliper Antipodal Pair.svg|thumb|An ''antipodal pair of vertex'' and their ''supporting parallel lines''.]]
The rotating calipers method was first used in the dissertation of [[Michael Shamos]] in 1978.&lt;ref name=shamos1978&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://euro.ecom.cmu.edu/people/faculty/mshamos/1978ShamosThesis.pdf|title = Computational Geometry|date = 1978|accessdate = |website = |publisher = Yale University|last = Shamos|first = Michael|authorlink = Michael Shamos|pages = 76–81|format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shamos uses this method to generate all [[antipodal point|antipodal]] pairs of points on a [[convex polygon]] and to compute the diameter of a convex polygon in &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt; time. [[Godfried Toussaint]] coined the phrase "rotating calipers" and also demonstrated that the method was applicable in solving many other computational geometry problems.&lt;ref name="tous83"&gt;{{cite journal

== Shamos's algorithm ==
Shamos gave following algorithm in his dissertation (pp 77–82) for the rotating calipers method that generated all antipodal pairs of vertices on convex polygon:&lt;ref name=shamos1978/&gt;

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
/* p[] is in standard form, ie, counter clockwise order, 
     distinct vertices, no collinear vertices.
   ANGLE(m,n) is a procedure that returns the clockwise angle 
     swept out by a ray as it rotates from a position parallel 
     to the directed segment Pm,Pm+1 to a position parallel to Pn,Pn+1
   We assume all indices are reduced to mod N (so that N+1 = 1).
*/
GetAllAntiPodalPairs(p[1..n])
  //Find first anti-podal pair by locating vertex opposite P1
  i = 1
  j = 2
  while angle(i, j) &lt; pi
    j++
  yield i,j

  /* Now proceed around the polygon taking account of
     possibly parallel edges. Line L passes through
     Pi, Pi+1 and M passes through Pj, Pj+1
  */

  //Loop on j until all of P has been scanned
  current = i  
  while j &lt;&gt; n
    if angle(current, i+1) &lt;= angle(current, j+1)
      j++
      current = j
    else
      i++
      current = i
    yield i,j

    //Now take care of parallel edges
    if angle(current, i+1) = angle(current, j+1)
      yield i+1, j
      yield i, j+1
      yield i+1, j+1
      if current = i
        j++
      else
        i++
&lt;/source&gt;

Another version of this algorithm appeared in the text by Preparata and Shamos in 1985 that avoided calculation of angles:&lt;ref name=preparata1985&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shamos|first1=Franco P. Preparata, Michael Ian|title=Computational Geometry An Introduction|date=1985|publisher=Springer New York|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-4612-7010-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
GetAllAntiPodalPairs(p[1..n])
  i0 = n
  i = 1
  j = i+1
  while (Area(i,i+1,j+1) &gt; Area(i,i+1,j))
    j = j+1
    j0 = j
  while (j &lt;&gt; i0)
    i = i+1
    yield i,j
    while (Area(i,i+1,j+1) &gt; Area(i,i+1,j)
      j=j+1
      if ((i,j) &lt;&gt; (j0,i0))
        yield i,j
      else 
        return
    if (Area(j,i+1,j+1) = Area(i,i+1,j))
      if ((i,j) &lt;&gt; (j0,i0))
        yield i,j+1
      else 
        yield i+1,j
&lt;/source&gt;

== Using monotone chain algorithm ==
This method has several advantages including that it avoids calculation of area or angles as well as sorting by polar angles. The method is based on finding convex hull using [https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Algorithm_Implementation/Geometry/Convex_hull/Monotone_chain Monotone chain method] devised by A.M. Andrew&lt;ref name=andrew1979&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Andrew|first1=A.

/* All indices starts from 1.		  
   dir(p,q,r) returns +ve number if p-q-r segments are clockwise,
     -ve number if they are anti clockwise and 0 if collinear.

  p’ = Sort p lexicographically (i.e. first by x then by y)
  U, L = create new stacks of points

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3640">'''Sammon mapping''' or '''Sammon projection''' is an algorithm that [[Map (mathematics)|maps]] a high-dimensional space to a space of lower dimensionality (see [[multidimensional scaling]]) by trying to preserve the structure of inter-point distances in high-dimensional space in the lower-dimension projection. It is particularly suited for use in [[exploratory data analysis]]. The method was proposed by John W. Sammon in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sammon JW|title=A nonlinear mapping for data structure analysis|journal=IEEE Transactions on Computers| volume=18|year=1969|pages=401,402 (missing in PDF),403–409|url=http://theoval.cmp.uea.ac.uk/~gcc/matlab/sammon/sammon.pdf|doi=10.1109/t-c.1969.222678 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered a non-linear approach as the mapping cannot be represented as a linear combination of the original variables as possible in techniques such as [[principal component analysis]], which also makes it more difficult to use for classification applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lerner, B; Hugo Guterman, Mayer Aladjem, Itshak Dinsteint, Yitzhak Romem|title= On pattern classification with Sammon's nonlinear mapping an experimental study|journal= Pattern Recognition|volume=31|issue=4|year=1998|pages=371–381| doi=10.1016/S0031-3203(97)00064-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Denote the distance between '''i'''th and '''j'''th objects in the original space by &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle d^{*}_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;, and the distance between their projections by &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle d^{}_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;. Sammon's mapping aims to minimize the following error function, which is often referred to as '''Sammon's stress''' or '''Sammon's error''':

:&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{1}{\sum\limits_{i&lt;j}d^{*}_{ij}}\sum_{i&lt;j}\frac{(d^{*}_{ij}-d_{ij})^2}{d^{*}_{ij}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The minimization can be performed either by [[gradient descent]], as proposed initially, or by other means, usually involving iterative methods. The number of iterations need to be experimentally determined and convergent solutions are not always guaranteed. Many implementations prefer to use the first Principal Components as a starting configuration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Pattern Analysis &amp; Applications|volume=3|issue=2|pages=61–68|doi=10.1007/s100440050006|title= On the Initialisation of Sammon's Nonlinear Mapping|author=Lerner, B; H. Guterman, M. Aladjem and I. Dinstein}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sammon mapping has been one of the most successful nonlinear metric multidimensional scaling methods since its advent in 1969, but effort has been focused on algorithm improvement rather than on the form of the stress function. The performance of the Sammon mapping has been improved by extending its stress function using left [[Bregman divergence]]

The '''square–cube law''' (or '''cube–square law''') is a mathematical principle, applied in a variety of scientific fields, which describes the relationship between the volume and the surface area as a shape's size increases or decreases. It was first described in 1638 by [[Galileo Galilei]] in his ''[[Two New Sciences]]'' as the "...ratio of two volumes is greater than the ratio of their surfaces".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  https://books.google.com/books?id=wRm4BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA176&amp;lpg=PA176&amp;dq=square+cube+law+galileo&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gTvbwNAElG&amp;sig=A5PVzej4PexQ4gzIt9mytn2Nw6k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0Y2iVb_nEorGogTYiImICg&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=square%20cube%20law%20galileo&amp;f=false  |title=How Mechanics Shaped the Modern World|work=book|author=David H. Allen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This principle states that, as a shape grows in size, its volume grows faster than its surface area. When applied to the real world this principle has many implications which are important in fields ranging from [[mechanical engineering]] to [[biomechanics]]. It helps explain phenomena including why large mammals like [[elephants]] have a harder time cooling themselves than small ones like mice, and why building taller and taller [[skyscrapers]] is increasingly difficult.

==Description==
[[File:Comparison of surface area vs volume of shapes.svg|thumb|Graphs of surface area, ''A'' against volume, ''V'' of the Platonic solids and a sphere, showing that the surface-area-to-volume ratio decreases with increasing volume.]]

The square–cube law can be stated as follows:

{{quote|When an object undergoes a proportional increase in size, its new surface area is proportional to the square of the multiplier and its new volume is proportional to the cube of the multiplier.}}

Represented mathematically:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.world-builders.org/lessons/less/les9/area.html  |title=World Builders: The Sizes of Living Things|work=|author=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;A_2=A_1\left(\frac{\ell_2}{\ell_1}\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A_1&lt;/math&gt; is the original surface area and &lt;math&gt;A_2&lt;/math&gt; is the new surface area.

:&lt;math&gt;V_2=V_1\left(\frac{\ell_2}{\ell_1}\right)^3&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;V_1&lt;/math&gt; is the original volume, &lt;math&gt;V_2&lt;/math&gt; is the new volume, &lt;math&gt;\ell_1&lt;/math&gt; is the original length and &lt;math&gt;\ell_2&lt;/math&gt; is the new length.

For example, a cube with a side length of 1 meter has a surface area of 6&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a volume of 1&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.  If the dimensions of the cube were multiplied by 2, its surface area would be multiplied by the ''square'' of 2 and become 24&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Its volume would be multiplied by the ''cube'' of 2 and become 8&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. 

The original cube (1m sides) has a surface area to volume ratio of 6:1. The larger (2m sides) cube has a surface area to volume ratio of (24/8) 3:1. As the dimensions increase, the volume will continue to grow faster than the surface area. Thus the square–cube law.  This principle applies to all solids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fathom.lib.uchicago.edu/2/21701757/|title=The Biology of B-Movie Monsters|work=|author=Michael C. LaBarbera}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Engineering===
When a physical object maintains the same density and is scaled up, its volume and mass are increased by the cube of the multiplier while its surface area increases only by the square of said multiplier.  This would mean that when the larger version of the object is accelerated at the same rate as the original, more pressure would be exerted on the surface of the larger object.

Consider a simple example of a body of mass, M, having an acceleration, a, and surface area, A, of the surface upon which the accelerating force is acting.  The force due to acceleration, &lt;math&gt;F= M a&lt;/math&gt; and the thrust pressure,  &lt;math&gt;T = \frac{F}{A} = M\frac{a}{A}&lt;/math&gt;.

Now, consider the object be exaggerated by a multiplier factor = x so that it has a new mass, &lt;math&gt;M' = x^3 M&lt;/math&gt;, and the surface upon which the force is acting has a new surface area, &lt;math&gt;A' = x^2 A&lt;/math&gt;.

The new force due to acceleration &lt;math&gt;F' = x^3 Ma&lt;/math&gt; and the resulting thrust pressure,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
T' &amp;= \frac{F'}{A'}\\
   &amp;= \frac{x^3}{x^2} \times M\frac{a}{A}\\
   &amp;= x \times M \frac{a}{A}\\
   &amp;= x \times T\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
                                  
Thus, just scaling up the size of an object, keeping the same material of construction (density), and same acceleration, would increase the thrust by the same scaling factor. This would indicate that the object would have less ability to resist stress and  would be more prone to collapse while accelerating.

This is why large vehicles perform poorly in crash tests and why there are limits to how high buildings can be built.  Similarly, the larger an object is, the less other objects would resist its motion, causing its deceleration.

====Engineering examples====
{{refimprove section|small=y|date=September 2018}}
*[[Watt steam engine|Steam engine]]: [[James Watt]], working as an instrument maker for the [[University of Glasgow]], was given a scale model [[Newcomen steam engine]] to put in working order.  Watt recognized the problem as being related to the square–cube law, in that the surface to volume ratio of the model's cylinder was greater than that of the much larger commercial engines, leading to excessive heat loss.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Experiments with this model led to Watt's famous improvements to the steam engine.

* [[Airbus A380]]: the lift and control surfaces (wings, rudders and elevators) are relatively big compared to the fuselage of the airplane. For example, taking a [[Boeing 737]] and merely magnifying its dimensions to the size of an A380 would result in wings that are too small for the aircraft weight, because of the square–cube rule.
* [[Expander cycle]] [[rocket engines]] suffer from the square–cube law. Their size, and therefore thrust, is limited by [[heat transfer]] [[efficiency]] due to the surface area of the nozzle increasing slower than the volume of fuel flowing through the nozzle.
* A [[clipper]] needs relatively more sail surface than a [[sloop]] to reach the same speed, meaning there is a higher sail-surface-to-sail-surface ratio between these craft than there is a weight-to-weight ratio.
* [[Aerostats]] generally benefit from the square–cube law. As the radius (&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;) of a balloon is increased, the cost in surface area increases quadratically (&lt;math&gt;r ^ 2&lt;/math&gt;), but the lift generated from volume increases cubically (&lt;math&gt;r^3&lt;/math&gt;).
* [[Structural Engineering]]: Materials that work at small scales may not work at larger scales. For example, the compressive stress at the bottom of small free-standing column scales at the same rate as the size of the column. Therefore, there exists a size for a given material and density at which a column will collapse on itself.

===Biomechanics===
If an animal were isometrically scaled up by a considerable amount, its relative muscular strength would be severely reduced, since the cross section of its muscles would increase by the ''square'' of the scaling factor while its mass would increase by the ''cube'' of the scaling factor.  As a result of this, cardiovascular  and respiratory functions would be severely burdened.

In the case of flying animals, the wing loading would be increased if they were isometrically scaled up, and they would therefore have to fly faster to gain the same amount of [[Lift (force)|lift]].  Air resistance per unit mass is also higher for smaller animals, which is why a small animal like an [[ant]] cannot be seriously injured from impact with the ground after being dropped from any height.

As stated by [[J. B. S. Haldane]], large animals do not look like small animals: an elephant cannot be mistaken for a mouse scaled up in size.  This is due to [[allometry|allometric scaling]]: the bones of an elephant are necessarily proportionately much larger than the bones of a mouse, because they must carry proportionately higher weight. Haldane illustrates this in his seminal 1928 essay ''On Being the Right Size'' in referring to [[allegory|allegorical ]] giants: "...consider a man 60 feet high...Giant Pope and Giant Pagan in the illustrated ''Pilgrim's Progress:'' ...These monsters...weighed 1000 times as much as [[Pilgrim's Progress|Christian]]. Every square inch of a giant bone had to support 10 times the weight borne by a square inch of human bone.  As the average human thigh-bone breaks under about 10 times the human weight, Pope and Pagan would have broken their thighs every time they took a step."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Haldane|first1=J. B. S.|title=On Being the Right Size|url=http://irl.cs.ucla.edu/papers/right-size.html|website=Internet Research Lab|publisher=UCLA|accessdate=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently, most animals show [[allometry|allometric scaling]] with increased size, both among species and within a species. The giant creatures seen in monster movies (e.g., [[Godzilla]] or [[King Kong]]) are also unrealistic, as their sheer size would force them to collapse.

However, the buoyancy of water negates to some extent the effects of gravity. Therefore, sea creatures can grow to very large sizes without the same musculoskeletal structures that would be required of similarly sized land creatures, and it is no coincidence that the largest animals to ever exist on earth are [[Largest organisms#Animals|aquatic animals]].

The metabolic rate of animals scales with a mathematical principle named [[Kleiber's law|quarter-power scaling]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/national/science/011299sci-scaling.html| title=Of Mice and Elephants: A Matter of Scale| author=George Johnson| publisher=[[The New York Times]]| date=January 12, 1999| accessdate=2015-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to the [[metabolic theory of ecology]].

=== Mass and heat transfer ===
Mass transfer such as diffusion to smaller objects such as living cells is faster than diffusion to larger objects such as entire animals. Thus, in chemical processes that take place on a surface - rather than in the bulk - finer-divided material is more active. For example, the activity of a heterogeneous [[catalyst]] is higher when it is divided into finer particles.

Heat production from a chemical process scales with the cube of the linear dimension (height, width) of the vessel, but the vessel surface area scales with only the square of the linear dimension. Consequently, larger vessels are much more difficult to cool. Also, large-scale piping for transferring hot fluids is difficult to simulate in small scale, because heat is transferred faster out from smaller pipes. Failure to take this into account in process design may lead to catastrophic [[thermal runaway]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17586">In [[mathematics]], [[economics]] and [[computer science]], particularly in the fields of [[combinatorics]], [[game theory]] and [[algorithms]], the '''stable-roommate problem''' ('''SRP''')  is the problem of finding a '''stable matching''' for an even-sized set. A [[Matching (graph theory)|matching]] is a separation of the set into disjoint pairs ("roommates"). The matching is ''stable'' if there are no two elements which are not roommates and which both prefer each other to their roommate under the matching.  This is distinct from the [[Stable marriage problem|stable-marriage problem]] in that the stable-roommates problem allows matches between any two elements, not just between classes of "men" and "women".

It is commonly stated as:
: In a given instance of the stable-roommates problem (SRP), each of ''2n'' participants ranks the others in strict order of preference. A matching is a set of ''n'' disjoint pairs of participants. A matching ''M'' in an instance of SRP is stable if there are no two participants ''x'' and ''y'', each of whom prefers the other to their partner in ''M''. Such a pair is said to block ''M'', or to be a blocking pair with respect to ''M''.

==Solution==
Unlike the [[stable marriage problem]], a stable matching may fail to exist for certain sets of participants and their preferences. For a minimal example of a stable pairing not existing, consider 4 people A, B, C, and D, whose rankings are:
: A:(B,C,D), B:(C,A,D), C:(A,B,D), D:(A,B,C)

In this ranking, each of A, B, and C is the most preferable person for someone. In any solution, one of A, B, or C ''must'' be paired with D and the other two with each other (for example AD and BC), yet for anyone who is partnered with D, another member will have rated them highest, and D’s partner will in turn prefer this other member over D. In this example, AC is a more favorable pairing than AD, but the necessary remaining pairing of BD then raises the same issue, illustrating the absence of a stable matching for these participants and their preferences.

==Algorithm==
An efficient algorithm was given in {{harv|Irving|1985}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=An efficient algorithm for the "stable roommates" problem | journal = Journal of Algorithms | volume=6 | year=1985 | pages=577–595 | first1=Robert W. | last1=Irving | doi=10.1016/0196-6774(85)90033-1 | issue=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The algorithm will determine, for any instance of the problem, whether a stable matching exists, and if so, will find such a matching. Irving’s algorithm has [[Big O notation|O(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) complexity]], provided suitable data structures are used to implement the necessary manipulation of the preference lists and identification of rotations.

The algorithm consists of two phases. In Phase 1, participants ''propose'' to each other, in a manner similar to that of the Gale-Shapley algorithm for the [[stable marriage problem]]. Each participant orders the other members by preference, resulting in a preference list&amp;mdash;an ordered set of the other participants. Participants then propose to each person on their list, in order, continuing to the next person if and when their current proposal is rejected. A participant will reject a proposal if they already hold a proposal from someone they prefer. A participant will also reject a previously-accepted proposal if they later receive a proposal that they prefer. In this case, the rejected participant will then propose to the next person on their list, continuing until a proposal is again accepted. If any participant is eventually rejected by all other participants, this indicates that no stable matching is possible. Otherwise, Phase 1 will end with each person holding a proposal from one of the others.

Consider two participants, ''q'' and ''p''.  If ''q'' holds a proposal from ''p'', then we remove from ''q''{{'}}s list all participants ''x'' after ''p'', and symmetrically, for each removed participant ''x'', we remove ''q'' from ''x''{{'}}s list, so that ''q'' is first in ''p''{{'}}s list; and ''p'', last in ''q''{{'}}s, since ''q'' and any ''x'' cannot be partners in any stable matching. The resulting reduced set of preference lists together is called the Phase 1 table. In this table, if any reduced list is empty, then there is no stable matching. Otherwise, the Phase 1 table is a ''stable table''. A stable table, by definition, is the set of preference lists from the original table after members have been removed from one or more of the lists, and the following three conditions are satisfied (where reduced list means a list in the stable table):

(i) ''p'' is first on ''q''{{'}}s reduced list if and only if ''q'' is last on ''p''{{'}}s &lt;br /&gt;
(ii) ''p'' is not on ''q''{{'}}s reduced list if and only if ''q'' is not on ''p''{{'}}s if and only if ''q'' prefers the last person on their list to ''p''; or ''p'', the last person on their list to ''q''  &lt;br /&gt;
(iii) no reduced list is empty

Stable tables have several important properties, which are used to justify the remainder of the procedure:

1. Any stable table must be a subtable of the Phase 1 table, where subtable is a table where the preference lists of the subtable are those of the supertable with some individuals removed from each other's lists.

2. In any stable table, if every reduced list contains ''exactly'' one individual, then pairing each individual with the single person on their list gives a stable matching.

3. If the stable roommates problem instance has a stable matching, then there is a stable matching contained in any one of the stable tables.

4. Any stable subtable of a stable table, and in particular any stable subtable that specifies a stable matching as in 2, can be obtained by a sequence of ''rotation eliminations'' on the stable table.

These rotation eliminations comprise Phase 2 of Irving’s algorithm.

By 2, if each reduced list of the Phase 1 table contains exactly one individual, then this gives a matching.

Otherwise, the algorithm enters Phase 2. A ''rotation'' in a stable table ''T'' is defined as a sequence (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), ..., (''x''&lt;sub&gt;k-1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;k-1&lt;/sub&gt;) such that the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are distinct, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is first on ''x''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'s reduced list (or ''x''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is last on ''y''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'s reduced list) and ''y''&lt;sub&gt;i+1&lt;/sub&gt; is second on ''x''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'s reduced list, for i = 0, ..., k-1 where the indices are taken modulo k. It follows that in any stable table with a reduced list containing at least two individuals, such a rotation always exists. To find it, start at such a ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; containing at least two individuals in their reduced list, and define recursively ''q''&lt;sub&gt;i+1&lt;/sub&gt; to be the second on ''p''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'s list and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;i+1&lt;/sub&gt; to be the last on ''q''&lt;sub&gt;i+1&lt;/sub&gt;'s list, until this sequence repeats some ''p''&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;, at which point a rotation is found: it is the sequence of pairs starting at the first occurrence of (''p''&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;) and ending at the pair before the last occurrence. The sequence of ''p''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; up until the ''p''&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; is called the ''tail'' of the rotation. The fact that it's a stable table in which this search occurs guarantees that each ''p''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; has at least two individuals on their list.

To eliminate the rotation, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; rejects ''x''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; so that ''x''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; proposes to ''y''&lt;sub&gt;i+1&lt;/sub&gt;, for each ''i''. To restore the stable table properties (i) and (ii), for each ''i'', all successors of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;i-1&lt;/sub&gt; are removed from ''y''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'s list, and ''y''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is removed from their lists. If a reduced list becomes empty during these removals, then there is no stable matching. Otherwise, the new table is again a stable table, and either already specifies a matching since each list contains exactly one individual or there remains another rotation to find and eliminate, so the step is repeated.

Phase 2 of the algorithm can now be summarized as follows:

&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
T = Phase 1 table;
while (true) {
    identify a rotation r in T;
    eliminate r from T;
    if some list in T becomes empty,
        return null; (no stable matching can exist)
    else if (each reduced list in T has size 1)
        return the matching M = {{x, y} | x and y are on each other's lists in T}; (this is a stable matching)
}
&lt;/source&gt;

To achieve an O(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) running time, a ranking matrix whose entry at row ''i'' and column ''j'' is the position of the ''j''th individual in the ''i''th's list; this takes O(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) time. With the ranking matrix, checking whether an individual prefers one to another can be done in constant time by comparing their ranks in the matrix. Furthermore, instead of explicitly removing elements from the preference lists, the indices of the first, second and last on each individual's reduced list are maintained. The first individual that is ''unmatched'', i.e. has at least two in their reduced lists, is also maintained. Then, in Phase 2, the sequence of ''p''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; "traversed" to find a rotation is stored in a list, and an array is used to mark individuals as having been visited, as in a standard [[depth-first search]] [[graph traversal]]. After the elimination of a rotation, we continue to store only its tail, if any, in the list and as visited in the array, and start the search for the next rotation at the last individual on the tail, and otherwise at the next unmatched individual if there is no tail. This reduces repeated traversal of the tail, since it is largely unaffected by the elimination of the rotation.

===Example===

The following are the preference lists for a Stable Roommates instance involving 6 participants: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

6 : {{pad|1em}}  5 {{pad|1em}}  1 {{pad|1em}}  3 {{pad|1em}}  4  {{pad|1em}} 2

A possible execution of Phase 1 consists of the following sequence of proposals and rejections, where  → represents ''proposes to'' and &amp;times; represents ''rejects''.

1 → 3 &lt;br /&gt;
2 → 6 &lt;br /&gt;
3 → 2 &lt;br /&gt;
4 → 5 &lt;br /&gt;
5 → 3; {{pad|1em}} 3 &amp;times; 1 &lt;br /&gt;
1 → 4 &lt;br /&gt;
6 → 5; {{pad|1em}} 5 &amp;times; 6 &lt;br /&gt;
6 → 1

So Phase 1 ends with the following reduced preference lists:

1 : {{pad|1em}}  &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|3}}&lt;/del&gt; {{pad|1em}}  4 {{pad|1em}}  2 {{pad|1em}}  6  {{pad|1em}} &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|5}}&lt;/del&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
2 : {{pad|1em}}  6 {{pad|1em}}  5 {{pad|1em}}  4 {{pad|1em}}  1  {{pad|1em}} 3 &lt;br /&gt;
3 : {{pad|1em}}  2 {{pad|1em}}  4 {{pad|1em}}  5 {{pad|1em}}  &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|1}}&lt;/del&gt;  {{pad|1em}} &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|6}}&lt;/del&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
4 : {{pad|1em}}  5 {{pad|1em}}  2 {{pad|1em}}  3 {{pad|1em}}  6  {{pad|1em}} 1 &lt;br /&gt;
5 : {{pad|1em}}  3 {{pad|1em}}  &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|1}}&lt;/del&gt; {{pad|1em}}  2 {{pad|1em}}  4  {{pad|1em}} &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|6}}&lt;/del&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
6 : {{pad|1em}}  &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|5}}&lt;/del&gt; {{pad|1em}}  1 {{pad|1em}}  &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|3}}&lt;/del&gt;  {{pad|1em}}  4  {{pad|1em}} 2

In Phase 2, the rotation ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = (1,4), (3,2) is first identified. This is because 2 is 1's second favorite, and 4 is the second favorite of 3. Eliminating ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; gives:

1 : {{pad|1em}}  &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|3}}&lt;/del&gt; {{pad|1em}}  &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|4}}&lt;/del&gt; {{pad|1em}}  2 {{pad|1em}}  6  {{pad|1em}} &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|5}}&lt;/del&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
2 : {{pad|1em}}  6 {{pad|1em}}  5 {{pad|1em}}  4 {{pad|1em}}  1  {{pad|1em}} &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|3}}&lt;/del&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
3 : {{pad|1em}}  &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|2}}&lt;/del&gt; {{pad|1em}}  4 {{pad|1em}}  5 {{pad|1em}}  &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|1}}&lt;/del&gt;  {{pad|1em}} &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|6}}&lt;/del&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
4 : {{pad|1em}}  5 {{pad|1em}}  2 {{pad|1em}}  3 {{pad|1em}}  &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|6}}&lt;/del&gt;  {{pad|1em}} &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|1}}&lt;/del&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
5 : {{pad|1em}}  3 {{pad|1em}}  &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|1}}&lt;/del&gt; {{pad|1em}}  2 {{pad|1em}}  4  {{pad|1em}} &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|6}}&lt;/del&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
6 : {{pad|1em}}  &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|5}}&lt;/del&gt; {{pad|1em}}  1 {{pad|1em}}  &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|3}}&lt;/del&gt;  {{pad|1em}}  &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|4}}&lt;/del&gt;  {{pad|1em}} 2

Next, the rotation ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = (1,2), (2,6), (4,5) is identified, and its elimination yields:

1 : {{pad|1em}}  &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|3}}&lt;/del&gt; {{pad|1em}}  &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|4}}&lt;/del&gt; {{pad|1em}}  &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|2}}&lt;/del&gt; {{pad|1em}}  6  {{pad|1em}} &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|5}}&lt;/del&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
2 : {{pad|1em}}  &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|6}}&lt;/del&gt; {{pad|1em}}  5 {{pad|1em}}  4 {{pad|1em}}  &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|1}}&lt;/del&gt;  {{pad|1em}} &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|3}}&lt;/del&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
3 : {{pad|1em}}  &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|2}}&lt;/del&gt; {{pad|1em}}  4 {{pad|1em}}  5 {{pad|1em}}  &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|1}}&lt;/del&gt;  {{pad|1em}} &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|6}}&lt;/del&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
4 : {{pad|1em}}  &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|5}}&lt;/del&gt; {{pad|1em}}  2 {{pad|1em}}  3 {{pad|1em}}  &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|6}}&lt;/del&gt;  {{pad|1em}} &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|1}}&lt;/del&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
5 : {{pad|1em}}  3 {{pad|1em}}  &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|1}}&lt;/del&gt; {{pad|1em}}  2 {{pad|1em}}  &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|4}}&lt;/del&gt;  {{pad|1em}} &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|6}}&lt;/del&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
6 : {{pad|1em}}  &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|5}}&lt;/del&gt; {{pad|1em}}  1 {{pad|1em}}  &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|3}}&lt;/del&gt;  {{pad|1em}}  &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|4}}&lt;/del&gt;  {{pad|1em}} &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|2}}&lt;/del&gt;

Hence 1 and 6 are matched. Finally, the rotation ''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  = (2,5), (3,4) is identified, and its elimination gives:

1 : {{pad|1em}}  &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|3}}&lt;/del&gt; {{pad|1em}}  &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|4}}&lt;/del&gt; {{pad|1em}}  &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|2}}&lt;/del&gt; {{pad|1em}}  6  {{pad|1em}} &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|5}}&lt;/del&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
2 : {{pad|1em}}  &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|6}}&lt;/del&gt; {{pad|1em}}  &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|5}}&lt;/del&gt; {{pad|1em}}  4 {{pad|1em}}  &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|1}}&lt;/del&gt;  {{pad|1em}} &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|3}}&lt;/del&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
3 : {{pad|1em}}  &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|2}}&lt;/del&gt; {{pad|1em}}  &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|4}}&lt;/del&gt; {{pad|1em}}  5 {{pad|1em}}  &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|1}}&lt;/del&gt;  {{pad|1em}} &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|6}}&lt;/del&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
4 : {{pad|1em}}  &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|5}}&lt;/del&gt; {{pad|1em}}  2 {{pad|1em}}  &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|3}}&lt;/del&gt; {{pad|1em}}  &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|6}}&lt;/del&gt;  {{pad|1em}} &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|1}}&lt;/del&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
5 : {{pad|1em}}  3 {{pad|1em}}  &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|1}}&lt;/del&gt; {{pad|1em}}  &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|2}}&lt;/del&gt; {{pad|1em}}  &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|4}}&lt;/del&gt;  {{pad|1em}} &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|6}}&lt;/del&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
6 : {{pad|1em}}  &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|5}}&lt;/del&gt; {{pad|1em}}  1 {{pad|1em}}  &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|3}}&lt;/del&gt;  {{pad|1em}}  &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|4}}&lt;/del&gt;  {{pad|1em}} &lt;del&gt;{{color|gray|2}}&lt;/del&gt;

Hence the matching {{1, 6}, {2,4}, {3, 5}} is stable.

}}

In the branch of [[mathematics]] called [[graph theory]], the '''strength''' of an undirected [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] corresponds to the minimum ratio ''edges removed''/''components created'' in a decomposition of the graph in question. It is a method to compute [[Partition of a set|partitions]] of the set of vertices and detect zones of high concentration of edges, and is analogous to [[graph toughness]] which is defined similarly for vertex removal.

== Definitions ==

The '''strength''' &lt;math&gt;\sigma(G)&lt;/math&gt; of an undirected [[Graph (discrete mathematics)#Simple graph|simple graph]] ''G''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''V'',&amp;nbsp;''E'') admits the three following definitions:

* Let &lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt; be the set of all [[Partition of a set|partitions]] of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\partial \pi&lt;/math&gt; be the set of edges crossing over the sets of the partition &lt;math&gt;\pi\in\Pi&lt;/math&gt;, then  &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sigma(G)=\min_{\pi\in\Pi}\frac{|\partial \pi|}{|\pi|-1}&lt;/math&gt;.
* Also if &lt;math&gt; \mathcal T&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all spanning trees of ''G'', then
:: &lt;math&gt;\sigma(G)=\max\left\{\sum_{T\in\mathcal T}\lambda_T\ :\ \forall T\in {\mathcal T}\ \lambda_T\geq 0\mbox{ and }\forall e\in E\ \sum_{T\ni e}\lambda_T\leq1\right\}.&lt;/math&gt;
* And by linear programming duality,
:: &lt;math&gt;\sigma(G)=\min\left\{\sum_{e\in E}y_e\ :\ \forall e\in E\ y_e\geq0\mbox{ and }\forall T\in {\mathcal T}\ \sum_{e\in E}y_e\geq1\right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Complexity ==

Computing the strength of a graph can be done in polynomial time, and the first such algorithm
was discovered by Cunningham (1985). The algorithm with best complexity for computing exactly the strength is due to Trubin (1993), uses the flow decomposition of Goldberg and Rao (1998), in time &lt;math&gt;O(\min(\sqrt{m},n^ {2/3})mn\log(n^2/m+2))&lt;/math&gt;.

== Properties ==

* If &lt;math&gt;\pi=\{V_1,\dots,V_k\}&lt;/math&gt; is one partition that maximizes, and for &lt;math&gt; i\in\{1,\dots,k\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;G_i=G/V_i&lt;/math&gt; is the restriction of ''G'' to the set &lt;math&gt;V_i&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\sigma(G_k)\geq\sigma(G)&lt;/math&gt;.
* The Tutte-Nash-Williams theorem:  &lt;math&gt;\lfloor\sigma(G)\rfloor&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum number of edge-disjoint spanning trees that can be contained in ''G''.
* Contrary to the [[graph partition]] problem, the partitions output by computing the strength are not necessarily balanced (i.e. of almost equal size).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6073">The '''trinomial triangle''' is a variation of [[Pascal's triangle]].  The difference between the two is that an entry in the trinomial triangle is the sum of the ''three'' (rather than the ''two'' in Pascal's triangle) entries above it:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
 &amp; &amp;  &amp;  &amp; 1\\
 &amp; &amp;  &amp; 1&amp; 1&amp;1\\
 &amp; &amp; 1&amp; 2&amp; 3&amp;2&amp;1\\

1&amp;4&amp;10&amp;16&amp;19&amp;16&amp;10&amp;4&amp;1\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

The &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-th entry of the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-th row is denoted by

: &lt;math&gt;{n\choose k}_2&lt;/math&gt;.

Rows are counted starting from 0. The entries of the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-th row are indexed starting with &lt;math&gt;-n&lt;/math&gt; from the left, and the middle entry has index 0. The symmetry of the entries of a row about the middle entry is expressed by the relationship

: &lt;math&gt;{n\choose k}_2={n\choose-k}_2&lt;/math&gt;

The &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-th row corresponds to the coefficients in the [[polynomial expansion]] of the expansion of the [[trinomial]] &lt;math&gt;(1 + x + x^2)&lt;/math&gt; raised to the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-th power:&lt;ref name="MathWorldTrinomialCoefficient"&gt;{{MathWorld|TrinomialCoefficient|Trinominal Coefficient}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\left(1+x+x^2\right)^n= \sum _{j=0}^{2n}{n\choose j-n}_2 x^{j}=\sum _{k=-n}^{n}{n\choose k}_2 x^{n+k}&lt;/math&gt;

or, symmetrically,
:&lt;math&gt;\left(1+x+1/x\right)^n=\sum_{k=-n}^{n}{n\choose k}_2 x^k&lt;/math&gt;,
hence the alternative name '''trinomial coefficients''' because of their relationship to the [[multinomial coefficients]]:

: &lt;math&gt;{n\choose k}_2=\sum_{\textstyle{0\leq\mu,\nu\leq n\atop\mu+2\nu=n+k}}\frac{n!}{\mu!\,\nu!\,(n-\mu-\nu)!}&lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore, the diagonals have interesting properties, such as their relationship to the [[triangular numbers]].

The sum of the elements of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-th row is &lt;math&gt;3^n&lt;/math&gt;.

== Recursion formula ==

The trinomial coefficients can be generated using the following [[Recursion|recursion formula]]:&lt;ref name="MathWorldTrinomialCoefficient"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;{0\choose 0}_2=1&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;{n+1\choose k}_2={n\choose k-1}_2+{n\choose k}_2+{n\choose k+1}_2&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;n\geq 0&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;{n\choose k}_2=0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\ k&lt;-n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ k&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.

== The middle entries ==

The middle entries of the trinomial triangle {{OEIS|A002426}}

: 1, 1, 3, 7, 19, 51, 141, 393, 1107, 3139, …

were studied by [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]]. The middle entry for the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-th row is given by

: &lt;math&gt;{n\choose0}_2=\sum_{k=0}^n\frac{n(n-1)\cdots(n-2k+1)}{(k!)^2}=\sum_{k=0}^n{n\choose 2k}{2k\choose k}.&lt;/math&gt;

The corresponding [[generating function]] is&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|CentralTrinomialCoefficient|Central Trinomial Coefficient}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;1+x+3x^2+7x^3+19x^4+\ldots=\frac1{\sqrt{(1+x)(1-3x)}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Euler also noted the following ''exemplum memorabile inductionis fallacis'' ("notable example of fallacious induction"):

: &lt;math&gt;3{n+1\choose0}_2-{n+2\choose0}_2=f_n(f_n+1)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;0\leq n\leq 7&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;f_n&lt;/math&gt; stands for the [[Fibonacci sequence]].  For larger &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, however, this relationship is incorrect. [[George Andrews (mathematician)|George Andrews]] explained this fallacy using the general identity&lt;ref&gt;George Andrews, Three Aspects for Partitions. ''Séminaire Lotharingien de Combinatoire'', B25f (1990) [http://www.mat.univie.ac.at/~slc/opapers/s25andrews.html Online copy]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
: &lt;math&gt;2\sum_{k\in\mathbb Z}\left[{n+1\choose 10k}_2-{n+1\choose 10k+1}_2\right]=f_n(f_n+1).&lt;/math&gt;

== Chess mathematics ==

[[File:King walks.svg|thumb|right|Number of ways to reach a cell with the minimum number of moves]]

The triangle corresponds to the number of possible paths that can be taken by the [[King (chess)|king]] in a game of [[chess]]. The entry in a cell represents the number of different paths (using a minimum number of moves) the king can take to reach the cell.

== Importance in combinatorics ==
The coefficient of &lt;math&gt;x^k&lt;/math&gt; in the polynomial expansion of &lt;math&gt;\left(1+x+x^2\right)^n&lt;/math&gt; specifies the number of different ways of randomly drawing  &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; cards from two sets of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; identical playing cards.&lt;ref name="ct200510"&gt;Andreas Stiller: ''Pärchenmathematik. Trinomiale und Doppelkopf.'' ("Pair mathematics.  Trinomials and the game of ''Doppelkopf''"). [[c't]] Issue 10/2005, p. 181ff&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in such a card game with two sets of the three cards A, B, C, the choices look like this:

{| class="wikitable"
!bgcolor=ececec|Number of selected cards
!bgcolor=ececec|Number of options
!bgcolor=ececec|Options
|-
|0
|1
|
|-
|1
|3
|A, B, C
|-
|2
|6
|AA, AB, AC, BB, BC, CC
|-
|3
|7
|AAB, AAC, ABB, ABC, ACC, BBC, BCC
|-
|4
|6
|AABB, AABC, AACC, ABBC, ABCC, BBCC
|-
|5
|3
|AABBC, AABCC, ABBCC
|-
|6
|1
|AABBCC
|}

In particular, this results in &lt;math&gt;{24\choose 12-24}_2={24\choose -12}_2={24\choose 12}_2&lt;/math&gt; as the number of different hands in a game of ''[[Doppelkopf]]''.

Alternatively, it is also possible to arrive at this number by considering the number of ways of choosing &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; pairs of identical cards from the two sets, which is &lt;math&gt;{n\choose p}&lt;/math&gt;. The remaining &lt;math&gt;k-2p&lt;/math&gt; cards can then be chosen in &lt;math&gt;{n-p\choose k-2p}&lt;/math&gt; ways,&lt;ref name="ct200510"/&gt; which can be written in terms of the [[binomial coefficients]] as

:&lt;math&gt;{n\choose k-n}_2=\sum_{p=\max(0,k-n)}^{\min(n,[k/2])}{n\choose p}{n-p \choose k-2p}&lt;/math&gt;.

For example,

:&lt;math&gt;6={3\choose 2-3}_2={3\choose 0}{3\choose 2}+{3\choose 1}{2\choose 0}=1\cdot 3+3\cdot 1&lt;/math&gt;.

The example above corresponds to the three ways of selecting two cards without pairs of identical cards (AB, AC, BC) and the three ways of selecting a pair of identical cards (AA, BB, CC).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2946">In [[mathematics]], particularly in the area of [[functional analysis]] and [[topological vector space]]s, the '''vague topology''' is an example of the [[weak topology|weak-* topology]] which arises in the study of [[measure theory|measures]] on [[locally compact Hausdorff space]]s.

Let ''X'' be a [[locally compact Hausdorff space]].  Let ''M''(''X'') be the space of [[complex numbers|complex]] [[Radon measure]]s on ''X'', and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'')&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; denote the dual of ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''), the [[Banach space]] of complex [[continuous function]]s on ''X'' [[vanish at infinity|vanishing at infinity]] equipped with the [[uniform norm]].  By the [[Riesz–Markov–Kakutani_representation_theorem|Riesz representation theorem]] ''M''(''X'') is [[isometry|isometric]] to ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'')&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;.  The isometry maps a measure ''&amp;mu;'' to a [[linear functional]] &lt;math&gt;I_\mu(f) := \int_X f\, d\mu.&lt;/math&gt;

The '''vague topology''' is the [[Weak topology|weak-* topology]] on ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'')&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;.  The corresponding topology on ''M''(''X'') induced by the isometry from ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'')&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; is also called the vague topology on ''M''(''X'').  Thus in particular, a sequence of measures ''(&amp;mu;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;n&amp;isin;&amp;#8469;&lt;/sub&gt;'' converges vaguely to a measure ''&amp;mu;'' whenever for all test functions ''f &amp;isin; C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(X)'',

&lt;math&gt;\int_X f d\mu_n \to \int_X f d\mu.&lt;/math&gt;

It is also not uncommon to define the vague topology by duality with continuous functions having compact support ''C&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;(X)'', i.e. a sequence of measures ''(&amp;mu;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;n&amp;isin;&amp;#8469;&lt;/sub&gt;'' converges vaguely to a measure ''&amp;mu;'' whenever the above convergence holds for all test functions ''f &amp;isin; C&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;(X)''. This construction gives rise to a different topology. In particular, the topology defined by duality with ''C&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;(X)'' can be metrizable whereas the topology defined by duality with ''C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(X)'' is not.

One application of this is to [[probability theory]]: for example, the [[central limit theorem]] is essentially a statement that if ''&amp;mu;''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are the [[probability measure]]s for certain sums of [[independent random variables]], then ''&amp;mu;''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; converge weakly (and then vaguely) to a [[normal distribution]], i.e. the measure ''&amp;mu;''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is "approximately normal" for large ''n''.

{{Italic title}}
'''''Vector Analysis''''' is a textbook by [[Edwin Bidwell Wilson]], first published in 1901 and based on the lectures that [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] had delivered on the subject at [[Yale University]].  The book did much to standardize the notation and vocabulary of three-dimensional [[linear algebra]] and [[vector calculus]], as used by physicists and mathematicians.  It went through seven editions (1913, 1916, 1922, 1925, 1929, 1931, and 1943).  The work is now in the public domain.  It was reprinted by [[Dover Publications]] in 1960.

== Contents ==

The book carries the subtitle "A text-book for the use of students of mathematics and physics.  Founded upon the lectures of J. Willard Gibbs, Ph.D., LL.D."  The first chapter covers [[Vector (geometric)|vectors]] in three spatial dimensions, the concept of a (real) [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]], and the product of a scalar with a vector.  The second chapter introduces the [[dot product|dot]] and [[cross product]]s for pairs of vectors.  These are extended to a [[Triple product|scalar triple product]] and a quadruple product.  Pages 77&amp;ndash;81 cover the essentials of [[spherical trigonometry]], a topic of considerable interest at the time because of its use in [[celestial navigation]].  The third chapter introduces the vector calculus notation based on the [[del operator]]. The [[Helmholtz decomposition]] of a [[vector field]] is given on page 237.

The final eight pages develop [[bivector (complex)|bivector]]s as these were integral to the course on the [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] theory of [[light]] that Professor Gibbs taught at Yale. First Wilson associates a bivector with an ellipse. The product of the bivector with a [[complex number]] on the [[unit circle]] is then called an ''elliptical rotation''. Wilson continues with a description of ''elliptic harmonic motion'' and the case of [[stationary wave]]s.

==Genesis==

Professor Gibbs produced an 85-page outline of his treatment of vectors for use by his students and had sent a copy to [[Oliver Heaviside]] in 1888.  In 1892 Heaviside, who was formulating his own vectorial system in the ''Transactions of the Royal Society'', praised Gibbs' "little book", saying it "deserves to be well known". However, he also noted that it was "much too condensed for a first introduction to the subject".&lt;ref&gt;[[Oliver Heaviside]] (1892) "On the forces, stresses, and fluxes of energy in the electromagnetic field", ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London'' A 183:423&amp;ndash;80.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the occasion of the bicentennial of Yale University, a series of publications were to be issued to showcase Yale's role in the advancement of knowledge. Gibbs was authoring ''[[Elementary Principles in Statistical Mechanics]]'' for that series. Mindful of the demand for innovative university textbooks, the editor of the series, Professor Morris, wished to include also a volume dedicated to Gibbs's lectures on vectors, but Gibbs's time and attention were entirely absorbed by the ''Statistical Mechanics''.

E. B. Wilson was then a new graduate student in mathematics.  He had learned about [[quaternion]]s from James Mills Peirce at Harvard, but Dean A. W. Phillips persuaded him to take Gibbs's course on vectors, which treated similar problems from a rather different perspective.  After Wilson had completed the course, Morris approached him about the project of producing a [[textbook]].  Wilson wrote the book by expanding his own class notes, providing [[exercise (mathematics)|exercise]]s, and consulting with others (including his father).&lt;ref&gt;[[Edwin Bidwell Wilson]] (1931) [http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.bams/1183494779 "Reminiscences of Gibbs by a student and colleague"] ''Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society.'' Volume 37, Number 6, 401&amp;ndash;416.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20507">'''Zero to the power of zero''', denoted by '''0&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;''', is a [[Expression (mathematics)|mathematical expression]] with no agreed-upon [[Value (mathematics)|value]]. The most common possibilities are 1 or leaving the expression undefined, with justifications existing for each, depending on context.
In [[algebra]], [[combinatorics]], or [[set theory]], the generally agreed upon value is 0&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 1, whereas in [[mathematical analysis]], the expression is generally left undefined. [[#Treatment on computers|Computer program]]s also have differing ways of handling this expression.

==Discrete exponents==
There are many widely used formulas having terms involving [[natural number|natural-number]] exponents that require 0&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; to be evaluated to 1.  For example, regarding ''b''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; as an [[empty product]] assigns it the value 1, even when {{math|1=''b'' = 0}}.  Alternatively, the [[#Combinatorial interpretation|combinatorial interpretation]] of ''b''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; is the number of [[empty tuple]]s of elements from a set with ''b'' elements; there is exactly one empty tuple, even if {{math|1=''b'' = 0}}.  Equivalently, the [[#Exponentiation over sets|set-theoretic interpretation]] of 0&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; is the number of functions from the empty set to the empty set; there is exactly one such function, the [[empty function]].&lt;ref name="Bourbaki"&gt;N. Bourbaki, Elements of Mathematics, Theory of Sets, Springer-Verlag, 2004, III.§3.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polynomials and power series==
Likewise, when working with [[polynomial]]s, it is often necessary to assign &lt;math&gt;0^0&lt;/math&gt; the value 1.  A polynomial is an expression of the form &lt;math&gt;a_0x^0+\cdots+a_nx^n&lt;/math&gt; where ''x'' is an indeterminate, and the coefficients &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt; are real numbers (or, more generally, elements of some [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]).  The set of all real polynomials in ''x'' is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R[x]&lt;/math&gt;.  Polynomials are added termwise, and multiplied by the applying the usual rules for exponents in the indeterminate ''x'' (see [[Cauchy product]]).  With these algebraic rules for manipulation, polynomials form a [[polynomial ring]].  The polynomial &lt;math&gt;x^0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[identity element]] of the polynomial ring, meaning that it is the (unique) element such that the product of &lt;math&gt;x^0&lt;/math&gt; with any polynomial &lt;math&gt;p(x)&lt;/math&gt; is just &lt;math&gt;p(x)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Nicolas Bourbaki]]|title=Algèbre|publisher=Springer|year=1970}}, §III.2 No. 9: "L'unique monôme de degré 0 est l'élément unité de &lt;math&gt;A[(X_i)_{i\in I}]&lt;/math&gt;; on l'identifie souvent à l'élément unité 1 de &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;".&lt;/ref&gt;  Polynomials can be evaluated by specializing the indeterminate ''x'' to be a real number.  More precisely, for any given real number &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; there is a unique unital [[ring homomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ev}_{x_0}:\mathbb R[x]\to\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ev}_{x_0}(x^1)=x_0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Nicolas Bourbaki]]|title=Algèbre|publisher=Springer|year=1970}}, §IV.1 No. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is called the ''evaluation homomorphism''.  Because it is a unital homomorphism, we have &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ev}_{x_0}(x^0) = 1.&lt;/math&gt;  That is, &lt;math&gt;x^0=1&lt;/math&gt; for all specializations of ''x'' to a real number (including zero).

This perspective is significant for many polynomial identities appearing in combinatorics.  For example, the [[binomial theorem]] &lt;math&gt;(1 + x)^n = \sum_{k = 0}^n \binom{n}{k} x^k&lt;/math&gt; is not valid for {{math|1=''x'' = 0}} unless {{math|1=0&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 1}}.&lt;ref&gt;"Some textbooks leave the quantity 0&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; undefined, because the functions ''x''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; and 0&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; have different limiting values when ''x'' decreases to 0. But this is a mistake. We must define {{math|1=''x''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 1}}, for all ''x'', if the binomial theorem is to be valid when {{math|1=''x'' = 0}}, {{math|1=''y'' = 0}}, and/or {{math|1=''x'' = −''y''}}. The binomial theorem is too important to be arbitrarily restricted! By contrast, the function 0&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; is quite unimportant".{{cite book|title=[[Concrete Mathematics]]|edition=1st|publisher=Addison Wesley Longman Publishing Co|date=1989-01-05|isbn=0-201-14236-8|author=[[Ronald Graham]], [[Donald Knuth]], and [[Oren Patashnik]]|page=162|chapter=Binomial coefficients}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, rings of [[power series]] require &lt;math&gt;x^0=1&lt;/math&gt; to be true for all specializations of ''x''.  Thus identities like &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1-x} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} x^n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e^{x} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{n!}&lt;/math&gt; are only true as functional identities (including at {{math|1=''x'' = 0}}) if {{math|1=0&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 1}}.

In [[differential calculus]], the [[power rule]] &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} x^n = nx^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; is not valid for {{math|1=''n'' = 1}} at {{math|1=''x'' = 0}} unless {{math|1=0&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 1}}.

==Continuous exponents==
[[Image:X^y.png|right|thumb|300px|Plot of {{math|1=''z'' = ''x''{{i sup|''y''}}}}. The red curves (with {{math|''z''}} constant) yield different limits as {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} approaches {{math|(0, 0)}}. The green curves (of finite constant slope, {{math|1=''y'' = ''ax''}}) all yield a limit of 1.]]

Limits involving algebraic operations can often be evaluated by replacing subexpressions by their limits; if the resulting expression does not determine the original limit, the expression is known as an [[indeterminate form]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=S. C.|last=Malik |author2=Savita Arora|year=1992|title=Mathematical Analysis|page=223|isbn=978-81-224-0323-7|quote=In general the limit of {{math|''φ''(''x'')/''ψ''(''x'')}} when {{math|1=''x'' = ''a''}} in case the limits of both the functions exist is equal to the limit of the numerator divided by the denominator. But what happens when both limits are zero? The division ({{math|0/0}}) then becomes meaningless. A case like this is known as an indeterminate form. Other such forms are {{math|∞/∞}}, {{math|0 × ∞}}, {{math|∞ − ∞}}, {{math|0&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;}}, {{math|1&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|∞&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;}}.|publisher=Wiley|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, when {{math|''f''(''t'')}} and {{math|''g''(''t'')}} are real-valued functions both approaching {{math|0}} (as {{math|''t''}} approaches a real number or {{math|±∞}}), with {{math|''f''(''t'') &gt; 0}}, the function {{math|''f''(''t'')&lt;sup&gt;''g''(''t'')&lt;/sup&gt;}} need not approach {{math|1}}; depending on {{math|''f''}} and {{math|''g''}}, the limit of {{math|''f''(''t'')&lt;sup&gt;''g''(''t'')&lt;/sup&gt;}} can be any nonnegative real number or {{math|+∞}}, or it can [[limit (mathematics)|diverge]]. For example, the functions below are of the form {{math|''f''(''t'')&lt;sup&gt;''g''(''t'')&lt;/sup&gt;}} with {{math|''f''(''t''), ''g''(''t'') → 0}} as {{math|''t'' → 0&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;}} (a [[one-sided limit]]), but the limits are different:
::&lt;math&gt; \lim_{t \to 0^+} {t}^{t} = 1, \quad \lim_{t \to 0^+} \left(e^{-\frac{1}{t^2}}\right)^t = 0, \quad \lim_{t \to 0^+} \left(e^{-\frac{1}{t^2}}\right)^{-t} = +\infty, \quad \lim_{t \to 0^+} \left(e^{-\frac{1}{t}}\right)^{at} = e^{-a}&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus, the two-variable function {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;''y''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, though continuous on the set {{math|{(''x'', ''y'') : ''x'' &gt; 0},}} [[Classification of discontinuities#Essential discontinuity|cannot be extended]] to a [[continuous function]] on any set containing {{math|(0, 0)}}, no matter how one chooses to define {{math|0&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=L.

==Complex exponents==
In the [[complex domain]], the function {{math|''z''{{i sup|''w''}}}} may be defined for nonzero {{math|''z''}} by choosing a [[complex logarithm#Branches of the complex logarithm|branch]] of {{math|log ''z''}} and defining {{math|''z''{{i sup|''w''}}}} as {{math|''e''{{i sup|''w'' log ''z''}}}}. This does not define {{math|0&lt;sup&gt;''w''&lt;/sup&gt;}} since there is no branch of {{math|log ''z''}} defined at {{math|1=''z'' = 0}}, let alone in a neighborhood of {{math|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;"Since {{math|log(0)}} does not exist, {{math|0&lt;sup&gt;''z''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is undefined. For {{math|Re(''z'') &gt; 0}}, we define it arbitrarily as {{math|0}}." George F. Carrier, Max Krook and Carl E. Pearson, ''Functions of a Complex Variable: Theory and Technique '', 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"For {{math|1=''z'' = 0}}, {{math|''w'' ≠ 0}}, we define {{math|1=0&lt;sup&gt;''w''&lt;/sup&gt; = 0}}, while {{math|0&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;}} is not defined." Mario Gonzalez, ''Classical Complex Analysis'', Chapman &amp; Hall, 1991, p.&amp;nbsp;56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"... Let's start at {{math|1=''x'' = 0}}. Here {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is undefined."  Mark D. Meyerson, The {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;}} Spindle, ''Mathematics Magazine'' '''69''', no. 3 (June 1996), 198-206.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of differing points of view==
The debate over the definition of  &lt;math&gt;0^0&lt;/math&gt; has been going on at least since the early 19th century. At that time, most mathematicians agreed that &lt;math&gt;0^0 = 1&lt;/math&gt;, until in 1821 [[Cauchy]]&lt;ref&gt;Augustin-Louis Cauchy, ''Cours d'Analyse de l'École Royale Polytechnique'' (1821).  In his ''Oeuvres Complètes'', series 2, volume 3.&lt;/ref&gt; listed &lt;math&gt;0^0&lt;/math&gt; along with expressions like &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \frac{0}{0}&lt;/math&gt; in a [[Indeterminate form#List of indeterminate forms|table of indeterminate forms]]. In the 1830s Libri&lt;ref&gt;Guillaume Libri, Note sur les valeurs de la fonction 0&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, ''[[Crelle's Journal|Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik]]'' '''6''' (1830), 67–72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guillaume Libri, Mémoire sur les fonctions discontinues, ''Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik'' '''10''' (1833), 303–316.&lt;/ref&gt; published an unconvincing argument for &lt;math&gt;0^0 = 1&lt;/math&gt;, and [[August Ferdinand Möbius|Möbius]]&lt;ref name="Möbius1834"&gt;{{cite journal |author =  A. F. Möbius |title = Beweis der Gleichung 0&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 1, nach J. F. Pfaff |trans-title = Proof of the equation 0&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 1, according to J. F. Pfaff|url = http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015036988163;view=1up;seq=142 |journal = Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik |volume = 12 |year = 1834 |pages = 134–136}}&lt;/ref&gt; sided with him, erroneously claiming that &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \lim_{t \to 0^+} f(t)^{g(t)} \;=\; 1&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \lim_{t \to 0^+} f(t) \;=\; \lim_{t \to 0^+} g(t) \;=\; 0&lt;/math&gt;. A commentator who signed his name simply as "S" provided the counterexample of &lt;math&gt;\textstyle (e^{-1/t})^t&lt;/math&gt;, and this quieted the debate for some time. More historical details can be found in Knuth (1992).&lt;ref name="Knuth1992" /&gt;

More recent authors interpret the situation above in different ways:
* Some argue that the best value for &lt;math&gt;0^0&lt;/math&gt; depends on context, and hence that [[defined and undefined|defining]] it once and for all is problematic.&lt;ref&gt;Examples include Edwards and Penny (1994). ''Calculus'', 4th ed, Prentice-Hall, p. 466, and Keedy, Bittinger, and Smith (1982). ''Algebra Two.'' Addison-Wesley, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Benson (1999), "The choice whether to define &lt;math&gt;0^0&lt;/math&gt; is based on convenience, not on correctness. If we refrain from defining &lt;math&gt;0^0&lt;/math&gt;, then certain assertions become unnecessarily awkward. [...] The consensus is to use the definition &lt;math&gt;0^0=1&lt;/math&gt;, although there are textbooks that refrain from defining {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;0^0&lt;/math&gt;."&lt;ref&gt;Donald C. Benson, ''The Moment of Proof : Mathematical Epiphanies.'' New York Oxford University Press (UK), 1999. {{ISBN|978-0-19-511721-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{nowrap end}}
* Others argue that &lt;math&gt;0^0&lt;/math&gt; should be defined as 1. [[Donald Knuth|Knuth]] (1992) contends strongly that &lt;math&gt;0^0&lt;/math&gt; "''has'' to be 1", drawing a distinction between the ''value'' &lt;math&gt;0^0&lt;/math&gt;, which should equal 1 as advocated by Libri, and the ''limiting form'' &lt;math&gt;0^0&lt;/math&gt; (an abbreviation for a limit of &lt;math&gt;\textstyle f(x)^{g(x)}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\textstyle f(x), g(x) \to 0&lt;/math&gt;), which is necessarily an indeterminate form as listed by Cauchy: "Both Cauchy and Libri were right, but Libri and his defenders did not understand why truth was on their side."&lt;ref name="Knuth1992"&gt;Donald E. Knuth, Two notes on notation, ''[[American Mathematical Monthly|Amer. Math. Monthly]]'' '''99''' no. 5 (May 1992), 403–422 ([https://arxiv.org/abs/math/9205211 arXiv:math/9205211 &amp;#91;math.HO&amp;#93;]).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment on computers==

===IEEE floating-point standard===
The [[IEEE 754-2008]] floating-point standard is used in the design of most floating-point libraries. It recommends a number of operations for computing a power:&lt;ref name="Muller_2010"&gt;{{cite book |author-last1=Muller |author-first1=Jean-Michel |author-last2=Brisebarre |author-first2=Nicolas |author-last3=de Dinechin |author-first3=Florent |author-last4=Jeannerod |author-first4=Claude-Pierre |author-last5=Lefèvre |author-first5=Vincent |author-last6=Melquiond |author-first6=Guillaume |author-last7=Revol |author-first7=Nathalie |author-last8=Stehlé |author-first8=Damien |author-last9=Torres |author-first9=Serge |title=Handbook of Floating-Point Arithmetic |year=2010 |publisher=[[Birkhäuser]] |edition=1 |doi=10.1007/978-0-8176-4705-6 |lccn=2009939668|page=216}}  {{isbn|978-0-8176-4705-6}} (online), {{isbn|0-8176-4704-X}} (print)&lt;/ref&gt; 
*&lt;tt&gt;pow&lt;/tt&gt; treats 0&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; as 1. If the power is an exact integer the result is the same as for &lt;tt&gt;pown&lt;/tt&gt;, otherwise the result is as for &lt;tt&gt;powr&lt;/tt&gt; (except for some exceptional cases).
*&lt;tt&gt;pown&lt;/tt&gt; treats 0&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; as 1. The power must be an exact integer. The value is defined for negative bases; e.g., &lt;tt&gt;pown(−3,5)&lt;/tt&gt; is −243.
*&lt;tt&gt;powr&lt;/tt&gt; treats 0&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; as [[NaN]] (Not-a-Number – undefined). The value is also NaN for cases like &lt;tt&gt;powr(−3,2)&lt;/tt&gt; where the base is less than zero. The value is defined by ''e''&lt;sup&gt;power×log(base)&lt;/sup&gt;.

The &lt;tt&gt;pow&lt;/tt&gt; variant is inspired by the &lt;tt&gt;pow&lt;/tt&gt; function from [[C99]], mainly for compatibility.&lt;ref&gt;http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/754/email/msg03270.html (beginning of the discussion about the power functions for the revision of the IEEE 754 standard, May 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; It is useful mostly for languages with a single power function. The &lt;tt&gt;pown&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;powr&lt;/tt&gt; variants have been introduced due to conflicting usage of the power functions and the different points of view (as stated above).&lt;ref&gt;http://grouper.ieee.org/groups//754/email/msg03292.html (suggestion of variants in the discussion about the power functions for the revision of the IEEE 754 standard, May 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Programming languages===
The C and C++ standards do not specify the result of 0&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; (a domain error may occur), but as of [[C99]], if the [[normative]] annex&amp;nbsp;F is supported, the result is required to be 1 because this value is more useful than [[NaN]] for significant applications&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Rationale for International Standard—Programming Languages—C|version=Revision 5.10|date=April 2003|author=John Benito|url=http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/C99RationaleV5.10.pdf|page=182|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; (for instance, with [[#Discrete_exponents|discrete exponents]]). The [[Java (programming language)|Java]] standard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html#pow-double-double- |title=Math (Java Platform SE 8) pow |publisher=Oracle}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[.NET Framework]] [[method (computer science)|method]] &lt;code&gt;System.Math.Pow&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.math.pow.aspx |title=.NET Framework Class Library Math.Pow Method |publisher=Microsoft}}&lt;/ref&gt; also treat 0&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; as 1.

===Mathematics software===
*[[SageMath]] simplifies ''b''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; to 1,  even if no constraints are placed on ''b''. It takes 0&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; to be 1, but does not simplify 0&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; for other ''x''.{{cn|date=June 2018}}
*[[Maple (software)|Maple]] distinguishes between ''integers'' 0, 1, ... and the corresponding ''[[floating point|floats]]'' 0.0, 1.0, ... (usually denoted 0., 1., ...). If ''x'' does not evaluate to a number, then ''x''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; and ''x''&lt;sup&gt;0.0&lt;/sup&gt; are respectively evaluated to 1 (''integer'') and 1.0 (''float''); on the other hand, 0&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; is evaluated to the integer 0, while 0.0&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; is evaluated as 0.&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;. If both the base and the exponent are zero (or are evaluated to zero), the result is ''Float(undefined)'' if the exponent is the ''float'' 0.0; with an integer as exponent, the evaluation of 0&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; results in the ''integer'' 1, while that of 0.&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; results in the ''float'' 1.0.{{cn|date=June 2018}}
*[[Macsyma]] also simplifies ''b''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; to 1 even if no constraints are placed on ''b'', but issues an error for 0&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;. For ''x'' &gt; 0, it simplifies 0&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; to 0. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}
*[[Mathematica]] distinguishes between integers as exact, and floating point numbers as approximate. It simplifies ''b''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; to 1, even if no constraints are placed on ''b'', does not simplify 0&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;, and takes 0&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; to be "Indeterminate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Power.html |title=Wolfram Language &amp; System Documentation: Power  |publisher=Wolfram| access-date =August 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[PARI/GP]] also distinguishes between integer and floating-point types: When the exponent 0 is of integer type, the expression, such as 0^0 or 0.^0, is simplified to 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=pari.git;a=commitdiff;h=c2fac9a15 |title=pari.git / commitdiff – 10- x ^ t_FRAC: return an exact result if possible; e.g. 4^(1/2) is now 2 |access-date=September 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the exponent is not of integer type, PARI/GP treats ''x''^''n'' as the transcendental function &lt;math&gt;e^{n \log x}&lt;/math&gt;, so that 0^0. yields a domain error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/pub/pari/manuals/2.11.0/users.pdf |title=Users' Guide to PARI/GP (version 2.11.0) |author=The PARI Group |format=PDF |pages=10,122 |year=2018 |quote="There is also the exponentiation operator ^, when the exponent is of type integer; otherwise, it is considered as a transcendental function.

*[[MATLAB|Matlab]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Magma computer algebra system|Magma]], [[GAP computer algebra system|GAP]], [[SINGULAR|singular]], and [[GNU Octave]] evaluate 0&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; as 1.{{cn|date=June 2018}}
