The "'''Argentine National Anthem'''" ({{lang-es|Himno Nacional Argentino}}) is the national anthem of Argentina. Its lyrics were written by the Buenos Aires-born politician Vicente López y Planes and the music was composed by the Spanish musician Blas Parera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.casarosada.gov.ar/nuestro-pais/simbolos-nacionales |title=Símbolos Nacionales |publisher=Presidency of the Argentine Nation |language=Spanish |trans-title=National Symbols |accessdate=21 November 2011 |quote=La necesidad de tener una canción patriótica, que surgió con la Revolución de Mayo y que el Triunvirato supo comprender, se ve plasmada hoy en el Himno Nacional Argentino, con música de Blas Parera, letra de Vicente López y Planes, y arreglo de Juan P. Esnaola.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was adopted as the sole official song on May 11, 1813, three years after the May Revolution; May 11 is therefore now Anthem Day in Argentina.

Some first, quite different, anthems were composed from 1810; a version was then introduced in 1813 which was used throughout the nineteenth century. The present, much shorter, anthem comprises only the first and last verses and the chorus of the 1813 Patriotic March, omitting much emotional text about the struggle for independence from Spain (''with strong arms they tear to pieces the arrogant Iberian lion'').

==Etymology==
The third Argentine national anthem was originally named "{{lang|es|Marcha Patriótica}}" ({{lang-en|Patriotic March}}), later renamed "{{lang|es|Canción Patriótica Nacional}}" ({{lang-en|"National Patriotic Song"}}), and then "{{lang|es|Canción Patriótica}}" ({{lang-en|"Patriotic Song"}}). It has been called "Himno Nacional Argentino" since it was published with that name in 1847.

==History==
[[File:Himno Nacional Argentino.jpg|thumb|The Argentine National Anthem being played for the first time in [[Mariquita Sánchez]]'s house (painting by [[Pedro Subercaseaux]])]]
The first Argentine national anthem was the "Patriotic March", published on 15 November 1810 in the ''{{lang|es|[[Gazeta de Buenos Ayres]]}}''. It had lyrics by Esteban de Luca and music by Blas Parera. This original composition made no reference to the [[name of Argentina]] (the country was not formally named "República Argentina" until 1826, although it was referred to as such) or an independentist will, and talked instead about Spain being conquered by France in the [[Peninsular War]], the absolutist restoration begun by the Council of Regency, and the need to keep the republican freedoms achieved so far in the Americas: "Spain was victim / of the plotting Gaul / because to the tyrants / she bent her neck / If there treachery / has doomed a thousands cities / let sacred freedom and union reign here / Let the father to the sons / be able to say / enjoy rights / that I did not enjoy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Seamos libres y lo demás no importa nada |trans-title=Let us be free and nothing else matters |last=Galasso |first=Norberto |authorlink=Norberto Galasso |year=2000 |publisher=Colihue |location=Buenos Aires |language=Spanish |isbn=978-950-581-779-5 |page=103 |quote=''España fue presa / del Galo sutil / porque a los tiranos / rindió la cerbiz. / Si allá la perfidia / perdió a pueblos mil / libertad sagrada / y unión reine aquí / El padre a sus hijos / pueda ya decir / Gozad de derechos / que no conocí.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-1812, the ruling [[First Triumvirate (Argentina)|triumvirate]] ordered the [[Buenos Aires Cabildo]] to commission a national anthem. Cayetano Rodríguez, a Franciscan friar, wrote a text that was approved on 4 August. The Catalan musician Blas Parera, music director of the local theater, set it to music and performed it for the first time with the orchestra he conducted on 1 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=El Himno Nacional Argentino |trans-title=The Argentine National Anthem |last=Vega |first=Carlos |year=1962 |publisher=Eudeba |location=Buenos Aires |language=Spanish |pages=15–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Less than a year later the [[Asamblea del Año XIII|Assembly of Year XIII]] estimated that the song was not effective enough to serve as a national anthem. On 6 March 1813 several poets were asked to submit lyrics. The poem by the lawyer Vicente López y Planes was unanimously considered the best. It was approved as the "sole national march" (''{{lang|es|única marcha nacional}}'') on May 11, 1813. Parera was asked to compose a new musical setting around the same date. He must have finished the piece in a few days. Oral tradition has it that the premiere took place on May 14, 1813 at the home of the aristocrat [[Mariquita Sánchez|Mariquita Sánchez de Thompson]], but there is no documentary evidence of that.&lt;ref&gt;Galasso, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; If this episode is true, then Parera, contrary to certain misconceptions, wrote quickly and under no visible coercion. The published song sheet is dated 14 May 1813. He again conducted the official premiere in the theater on May 28, and was paid 200 [[Argentine peso|pesos]].&lt;ref&gt;Vega, ''El Himno Nacional Argentino'', pp. 22–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Partitura del Himno Nacional Argentino hallada en Bolivia.jpg|thumb|[[Music sheet]] found in [[Santa Ana de Velasco]], [[Bolivia]], c. 1860.]]

The composition was then known as ''{{lang|es|Canción Patriótica Nacional}}'' (National Patriotic Song), and later simply as ''{{lang|es|Canción Patriótica}}'' (Patriotic Song), but in [[Juan Pedro Esnaola]]'s early arrangement, dated around 1848, it appeared under the title ''{{lang|es|Himno Nacional Argentino}}'', and the name has been retained until today.&lt;ref&gt;Vega, ''El Himno Nacional Argentino'', pp. 88–89.&lt;/ref&gt; In the complete version of the Anthem of May (as was christened by López) it is noted that the political vision portrayed is not only Argentine, but Latin American. The lyrics are ardently pro-independence and anti-Spanish, as the country was at that time fighting for its independence from Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nationalanthems.me/argentina-himno-nacional-argentino/ |title=Argentina |publisher=NationalAnthems.me |accessdate=21 November 2011 |quote=The original lyrics of the anthem included harsh attacks on Spain, the former colonial power.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song became popular immediately. Within ten years documented performances took place throughout Argentina, and also in Chile, Peru, and Colombia until they had their own national anthems.&lt;ref&gt;Vega, ''El Himno Nacional Argentino'', pp. 30–41.&lt;/ref&gt; Different versions emerged, making mass singing difficult; several reforms were then proposed. In 1860 Esnaola was commissioned to create an official version. He took the task to heart, making many changes to the music, including a slower tempo, a fuller texture, alterations to the melody, and enrichment of the harmony. In 1927 a committee produced a historicist version that undid several of Esnaola's changes, but introduced new problems in the sung line. After a heated public debate fueled by the newspaper ''{{lang|es|[[La Prensa (Buenos Aires)|La Prensa]]}}'', this version was rejected and, following the recommendations of a second committee, Esnaola's arrangement was officially reinstated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=O juremos con gloria morir: historia de una épica de estado |trans-title=Or swear to die gloriously: history of a state epic |last=Buch |first=Esteban |date=January 1994 |publisher=Editorial Sudamericana |location=Buenos Aires |language=Spanish |isbn=978-950-07-0964-4 |pages=103–114 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944 it was confirmed as the official anthem.

Throughout the 19th century the anthem was sung in its entirety. However, once harsh feelings against Spain had dissipated, and the country had become home to many Spanish immigrants, a modification was introduced by a decree of President [[Julio Argentino Roca]] on March 30, 1900:

{{quote|''"Without producing alterations in the lyrics of the National Anthem, there are in it verses that perfectly describe the concept that nations universally have regarding their anthems in peaceful times, and that harmonize with the serenity and dignity of thousands of Spanish that share our living, those that can and must be preferred to be sung in official parties, for they respect the traditions and the law in no offense to anyone, the President of the Republic decrees that:''

''In official or public parties, as well as in public schools, shall be sung only the first and last verses and the chorus of the National Song sanctioned by the General Assembly on May 11, 1813."''}}
==Controversy==
The song includes a line that has given rise to controversy: ''Buenos--Ayres se [o]pone á la frente De los pueblos de la ínclita union''&lt;!--spelling, double hyphen, and accents á and union verbatim from original--&gt;. In the manuscript and an early printed song-sheet the word ''opone'' is used; a slightly later version of the song-sheet correcting obvious errors such as spelling mistakes was issued with the same date of 14 May 1813, but with ''opone'' changed to ''pone''. The meaning reverses: "Buenos Aires ''opposes'' the front of the people of the union" to "Buenos Aires ''positions itself at'' the front ...". The original ''opone''  has been interpreted as advancing part of the centralist views in Buenos Aires, but has also been considered a "tragical misprint".&lt;ref name=scielo&gt;[http://www.scielo.org.ar/scielo.php?pid=S1669-90412006000100015&amp;script=sci_arttext The Patriotic March written by Vicente López: Depiction of a historical scene of tension]. Analysis of the original Marcha Patriótica, in Spanish, with abstract in English.&lt;/ref&gt; In many other lines the anthem goes beyond the [[Argentine War of Independence|Argentine theater]] of the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] and references events in Mexico, Central America, Northern South America, and Upper Peru.&lt;ref&gt;Galasso, pp. 102–103.&lt;/ref&gt; The growing ideas of independence are reflected in lines such as "On the surface of the earth rises a glorious new nation, her head is crowned with laurels, and a Lion lies defeated at her feet". This portrays not just Spanish absolutism, but Spain itself, as the enemy.&lt;ref&gt;Galasso, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

The words strongly attacking Spain were no longer sung.&lt;ref&gt;Buch, ''O juremos con gloria morir'', pp. 87–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
Performance of the national anthem is mandatory during all official events, and Argentines in attendance are expected to stand up and sing it. [[Radio in Argentina|Radio]] broadcasters voluntarily perform the anthem at midnight, while [[Television in Argentina|TV channels]] do so before closing down their daily broadcast. On [[Public holidays in Argentina|national holidays]], it is mandatory to perform the national anthem at midnight and noon.

The national anthem is ruled in [[Law of Argentina|Argentine law]] by Decree 10302/1944.&lt;ref name=Decree10302&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://servicios.infoleg.gob.ar/infolegInternet/verNorma.do?id=59311 |title=Decreto 10302/1944 |publisher=Ministry of Justice and Human Rights |language=Spanish |trans-title=Decree 10302/1944 |accessdate=21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rock musician [[Charly García]] broke legal regulations dealing with the reproduction of the song when he included an idiosyncratic [[cover version]] in his 1990 album ''{{lang|es|Filosofía barata y zapatos de goma}}'', stirring much controversy.&lt;ref&gt;Buch, ''O juremos con gloria morir'', pp. 147–156.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 various [[Music of Argentina|Argentine artists]] reedited the anthem and other patriotic songs in the joint album ''{{lang|es|El Grito Sagrado}}''. Other singers followed on their footsteps recreating the piece in their own ways.

A line from the original version of the national anthem was used as the Argentine title of the 1928 film known in English as ''[[The Charge of the Gauchos]]''.

The national anthem appears at the beginning of the [[1985 in film|1985]] film ''[[The Official Story]]'', an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winner.
===Short instrumental versions===
{{listen

 | title       = Short instrumental
 | description = Recording by the [[United States Navy]] Band of the abridged version, used at occasions such as soccer games.
 | format      = [[Ogg]]
}}
Due to the excessive length of the official version, in international events such as the [[Olympic Games]], professional [[Association football|soccer]] games, and the [[Rugby World Cup]], only the instrumental introduction (which lasts 1 minute 6 seconds) is played. Another variation is to play the musical break that leads into the chorus, the chorus itself, and the [[coda (music)|coda]]. Although traditional, these arrangements are not recognized by Argentine law.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28130">'''Cognitive musicology''' is a branch of [[cognitive science]] concerned with [[Cognitive model#Computational models|computationally modeling]] musical knowledge with the goal of understanding both music and cognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Laske | first = Otto | title = Navigating New Musical Horizons (Contributions to the Study of Music and Dance) | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = Westport | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-0-313-30632-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cognitive musicology can be differentiated from other branches of [[music psychology]] via its methodological emphasis, using computer modeling to study music-related [[knowledge representation]] with roots in [[artificial intelligence]] and [[cognitive science]]. The use of computer models provides an exacting, interactive medium in which to formulate and test theories.&lt;ref&gt;Laske, O. (1999). AI and music: A cornerstone of cognitive musicology. In M. Balaban, K. Ebcioglu, &amp; O. Laske (Eds.), ''Understanding music with AI: Perspectives on music cognition.'' Cambridge: The [[MIT Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

This interdisciplinary field investigates topics such as the parallels between language and music in the brain. Biologically inspired models of computation are often included in research, such as neural networks and evolutionary programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Graci | first1 = C | year = 2009 | title = A brief tour of the learning sciences featuring a cognitive tool for investigating melodic phenomena | url = | journal = Journal of Educational Technology Systems | volume = 38 | issue = 2| pages = 181–211 | doi=10.2190/et.38.2.i}}&lt;/ref&gt; This field seeks to model how musical knowledge is represented, stored, perceived, performed, and generated. By using a well-structured computer environment, the systematic structures of these cognitive phenomena can be investigated.&lt;ref&gt;Hamman, M., 1999. "Structure as Performance: Cognitive Musicology and the Objectification of Procedure," in  Otto Laske: Navigating New Musical Horizons, ed. J. Tabor. New York: Greenwood Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even while enjoying the simplest of melodies there are multiple brain processes that are synchronizing to comprehend what is going on. After the stimulus enters and undergoes the processes of the ear, it enters the auditory cortex, part of the temporal lobe, which begins processing the sound by assessing its pitch and volume. From here, brain functioning differs amongst the analysis of different aspects of music. For instance, the rhythm is processed and regulated by the left frontal cortex, the left parietal cortex and the right cerebellum standardly. Tonality, the building of musical structure around a central chord, is assessed by the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum (Abram, 2015). Music is able to access many different brain functions that play an integral role in other higher brain functions such as motor control, memory, language, reading and emotion. Research has shown that music can be used as an alternative method to access these functions that may be unavailable through non-musical stimulus due to a disorder. Musicology explores the use of music and how it can provide alternative transmission routes for information processing in the brain for diseases such as Parkinson's and [[dyslexia]] as well.

==Notable researchers==
The polymath [[H. Christopher Longuet-Higgins|Christopher Longuet-Higgins]], who coined the term "cognitive science", is one of the pioneers of cognitive musicology.  Among other things, he is noted for the computational implementation of an early key-finding algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;Longuet-Higgins, C. (1987) Mental Processes: Studies in cognitive science. Cambridge, MA, US: The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Key finding is an essential element of tonal music, and the key-finding problem has attracted considerable attention in the psychology of music over the past several decades.  Carol Krumhansl and Mark Schmuckler proposed an empirically grounded key-finding algorithm which bears their names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Krumhansl | first = Carol | title = Cognitive Foundations of Musical Pitch | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford Oxfordshire | year = 1990 | isbn = 0-19-505475-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their approach is based on key-profiles which were painstakingly determined by what has come to be known as the probe-tone technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Krumhansl | first1 = C. | last2 = Kessler | first2 = E. | year = 1982 | title = Tracing the dynamic changes in perceived tonal organisation in a spatial representation of musical keys | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 89 | issue = | pages = 334–368 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.89.4.334}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This algorithm has successfully been able to model the perception of musical key in short excerpts of music, as well as to track listeners' changing sense of key movement throughout an entire piece of music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmuckler | first1 = M. A. | last2 = Tomovski | first2 = R. | year = 2005 | title = Perceptual tests of musical key-finding | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance | volume = 31 | issue = | pages = 1124–1149 | doi=10.1037/0096-1523.31.5.1124}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Temperley, whose early work within the field of cognitive musicology applied dynamic programming to aspects of music cognition, has suggested a number of refinements to the Krumhansl-Schmuckler Key-Finding Algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Temperley | first = David | title = The Cognition of Basic Musical Structures | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-0-262-20134-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Otto Laske was a champion of cognitive musicology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Laske | first = Otto | title = Otto Laske | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = Westport | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-0-313-30632-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A collection of papers that he co-edited served to heighten the visibility of cognitive musicology and to strengthen its association with AI and music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Balaban | first = Mira | title = Understanding Music with AI | publisher = AAAI Press | year = 1992 | location = Menlo Park | isbn = 0-262-52170-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The foreword of this book reprints a free-wheeling interview with [[Marvin Minsky]], one of the founding fathers of AI, in which he discusses some of his early writings on music and the mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Minsky | first1 = M | year = 1981 | title = Music, mind, and meaning | url = http://web.media.mit.edu/~minsky/papers/MusicMindMeaning.html | journal = Computer Music Journal | volume = 5 | issue = 3| pages = 28–44 | doi=10.2307/3679983}}&lt;/ref&gt; AI researcher turned cognitive scientist Douglas Hofstadter has also contributed a number of ideas pertaining to music from an AI perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hofstadter | first = Douglas | title = Gödel, Escher, Bach | publisher = Basic Books | location = New York | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-0-465-02656-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Musician Steve Larson, who worked for a time in Hofstadter's lab, formulated a theory of "musical forces" derived by analogy with physical forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Larson | first1 = S | year = 2004 | title = Musical Forces and Melodic Expectations: Comparing Computer Models with Experimental Results | doi = 10.1525/mp.2004.21.4.457 | journal = Music Perception | volume = 21 | issue = 4| pages = 457–498 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hofstadter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cope | first = David | title = Virtual Music | publisher = The MIT Press | location = Cambridge | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-262-53261-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; also weighed in on David Cope's experiments in musical intelligence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cope | first = David | title = Experiments in Musical Intelligence | publisher = A-R Editions | location = Madison | year = 1996 | isbn = 978-0-89579-337-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which take the form of a computer program called EMI which produces music in the form of, say, Bach, or Chopin, or Cope.

Cope's programs are written in [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], which turns out to be a popular language for research in cognitive musicology.  Desain and Honing have exploited Lisp in their efforts to tap the potential of microworld methodology in cognitive musicology research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Honing | first1 = H | year = 1993 | title = A microworld approach to formalizing musical knowledge | url = | journal = Computers and the Humanities | volume = 27 | issue = 1| pages = 41–47 | doi=10.1007/bf01830716}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also working in Lisp, Heinrich Taube has explored computer composition from a wide variety of perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Taube | first = Heinrich | title = Notes from the Metalevel | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-90-265-1975-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are, of course, researchers who chose to use languages other than Lisp for their research into the computational modeling of musical processes.  Tim Rowe, for example, explores "machine musicianship" through C++ programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rowe | first = Robert | title = Machine Musicianship | publisher = MIT Pr | location = City | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-262-68149-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A rather different computational methodology for researching musical phenomena is the toolkit approach advocated by David Huron.&lt;ref&gt;Huron, D. (2002). Music Information Processing Using the Humdrum Toolkit: Concepts, Examples, and Lessons. "Computer Music Journal, 26" (2), 11–26.&lt;/ref&gt;  At a higher level of abstraction, Gerraint Wiggins has investigated general properties of music knowledge representations such as structural generality and expressive completeness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wiggins | first1 = G. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 1993 | title = A Framework for the Evaluation of Music Representation Systems | url = | journal = Computer Music Journal | volume = 17 | issue = 3| pages = 31–42 | doi=10.2307/3680941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a great deal of cognitive musicology research features symbolic computation, notable contributions have been made from the biologically inspired computational paradigms.  For example, [[Jamshed Bharucha]] and Peter Todd have modeled music perception in tonal music with neural networks.&lt;ref&gt;Bharucha, J. J., &amp; Todd, P. M. (1989). Modeling the perception of tonal structure with neural nets. ''Computer Music Journal'', 44−53&lt;/ref&gt;  Al Biles has applied genetic algorithms to the composition of jazz solos.&lt;ref&gt;Biles, J. A. 1994. "GenJam: A Genetic Algorithm for Generating Jazz Solos." Proceedings of the 1994 International Computer Music Conference. San Francisco: International Computer Music Association&lt;/ref&gt;  Numerous researchers have explored algorithmic composition grounded in a wide range of mathematical formalisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Nierhaus | first = Gerhard | title = Algorithmic Composition | publisher = Springer | location = Berlin | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-3-211-75539-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cope | first = David | title = Computer Models of Musical Creativity | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-0-262-03338-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within [[cognitive psychology]], among the most prominent researchers is [[Diana Deutsch]], who has engaged in a wide variety of work ranging from studies of absolute pitch and musical illusions to the formulation of musical knowledge representations to relationships between music and language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Deutsch | first = Diana | title = The Psychology of Music | publisher = Academic Press | location = Boston | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-0-12-213565-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Equally important is Aniruddh D. Patel, whose work combines traditional methodologies of cognitive psychology with [[neuroscience]].  Patel is also the author of a comprehensive survey of cognitive science research on music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Patel | first = Aniruddh | title =Music, Language, and the Brain | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-0-12-213565-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most significant contribution to viewing music from a linguistic perspective is the [[Generative Theory of Tonal Music]] (GTTM) proposed by [[Fred Lerdahl]] and [[Ray Jackendoff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lerdahl | first = Fred |author2=Ray Jackendoff | title = A Generative Theory of Tonal Music | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge | year = 1996 | isbn = 978-0-262-62107-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although GTTM is presented at the algorithmic level of abstraction rather than the implementational level, their ideas have found computational manifestations in a number of computational projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Katz|first=Jonah|author2=David Pesetsky|title=The Recursive Syntax and Prosody of Tonal Music|journal=Recursion: Structural Complexity in Language and Cognition|date=May 2009|volume=Conference at UMass Amherst|url=http://web.mit.edu/linguistics/people/faculty/pesetsky/Katz_Pesetsky_Recursion_Conference_Music.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hamanaka|first=Masatoshi|author2=Hirata, Keiji |author3=Tojo, Satoshi |title=Implementing 'A Generative Theory of Tonal Music'|journal=Journal of New Music Research|date=2006|volume=35|issue=4|pages=249–277|doi=10.1080/09298210701563238}}&lt;!--|accessdate=21 May 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

For the German-speaking area, Laske's conception of cognitive musicology has been advanced by Uwe Seifert in his book ''Systematische Musiktheorie und Kognitionswissenschaft. Zur Grundlegung der kognitiven Musikwissenschaft'' ("Systematic music theory and cognitive science. The foundation of cognitive musicology")&lt;ref&gt;Uwe Seifert: ''Systematische Musiktheorie und Kognitionswissenschaft. Zur Grundlegung der kognitiven Musikwissenschaft''. Orpheus Verlag für systematische Musikwissenschaft, Bonn 1993&lt;/ref&gt;  and  subsequent publications.

== Music and language acquisition skills ==
Both music and speech rely on sound processing and require interpretation of several sound features such as timbre, pitch, duration, and their interactions (Elzbieta, 2015). A fMRI study revealed that the Broca's and Wernicke's areas, two areas that are known to activated during speech and language processing, were found activated while the subject was listening to unexpected musical chords (Elzbieta, 2015). This relation between language and music may explain why, it has been found that exposure to music has produced an acceleration in the development of behaviors related to the acquisition of language. The Suzuki music education which is very widely known, emphasizes learning music by ear over reading musical notation and preferably begins with formal lessons between the ages of 3 and 5 years. One fundamental reasoning in favor of this education points to a parallelism between natural speech acquisition and purely auditory based musical training as opposed to musical training due to visual cues. There is evidence that children who take music classes have obtained skills to help them in language acquisition and learning (Oechslin, 2015), an ability that relies heavily on the dorsal pathway. Other studies show an overall enhancement of verbal intelligence in children taking music classes. Since both activities tap into several integrated brain functions and have shared brain pathways it is understandable why strength in music acquisition might also correlate with strength in language acquisition.

== Music and pre-natal development ==
Extensive prenatal exposure to a melody has been shown to induce neural representations that last for several months. In a study done by Partanen in 2013, mothers in the learning group listened to the ‘Twinkle twinkle little star' melody 5 times per week during their last trimester. After birth and again at the age of 4 months, they played the infants in the control and learning group a modified melody in which some of the notes were changed. Both at birth and at the age of 4 months, infants in the ''learning group'' had stronger event related potentials to the unchanged notes than the ''control group''. Since listening to music at a young age can already map out neural representations that are lasting, exposure to music could help strengthen brain plasticity in areas of the brain that are involved in language and speech processing.

== Music therapy effect on cognitive disorders ==
If neural pathways can be stimulated with entertainment there is a higher chance that it will be more easily accessible. This illustrates why music is so powerful and can be used in such a myriad of different therapies. Music that is enjoyable to a person illicit an interesting response that we are all aware of. Listening to music is not perceived as a chore because it is enjoyable, however our brain is still learning and utilizing the same brain functions as it would when speaking or acquiring language. Music has the capability to be a very productive form of therapy mostly because it is stimulating, entertaining, and appears rewarding. Using fMRI, Menon and Levitin found for the first time that listening to music strongly modulates activity in a network of mesolimbic structures involved in reward processing. This included the nucleus accumbens and the ventral tegmental area (VTA), as well as the hypothalamus, and insula, which are all thought to be involved in regulating autonomic and physiological responses to rewarding and emotional stimuli (Gold, 2013).

Pitch perception was positively correlated with phonemic awareness and reading abilities in children (Flaugnacco, 2014). Likewise, the ability to tap to a rhythmic beat correlated with performance on reading and attention tests (Flaugnacco, 2014). These are only a fraction of the studies that have linked reading skills with rhythmic perception, which is shown in a meta-analysis of 25 cross-sectional studies that found a significant association between music training and reading skills (Butzlaff, 2000). Since the correlation is so extensive it is natural that researchers have tried to see if music could serve as an alternative pathway to strengthen reading abilities in people with developmental disorders such as dyslexia. Dyslexia is a disorder characterized by a long lasting difficulty in reading acquisition, specifically text decoding. Reading results have been shown to be slow and inaccurate, despite adequate intelligence and instruction. The difficulties have been shown to stem from a phonological core deficit that impacts reading comprehension, memory and prediction abilities (Flaugnacco, 2014). It was shown that music training modified reading and phonological abilities even when these skills are severely impaired. By improving temporal processing and rhythm abilities, through training, phonological awareness and reading skills in children with dyslexia were improved. The OPERA hypothesis proposed by Patel (2011), states that since music places higher demands on the process than speech it bring brings adaptive brain plasticity of the same neural network involved in language processing.

Parkinson's disease is a complex neurological disorder that negatively impacts both motor and non-motor functions caused by the degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra (Ashoori, 2015). This in turn leads to a DA deficiency in the basal ganglia. The deficiencies of dopamine in these areas of the brain have shown to cause symptoms such as tremors at rest, rigidity, akinesia, and postural instability. They are also associated with impairments of internal timing of an individual (Ashoori, 2015). Rhythm is a powerful sensory cue that has shown to help regulate motor timing and coordination when there is a deficient internal timing system in the brain. Some studies have shown that musically cued gait training significantly improves multiple deficits of Parkinsons, including in gait, motor timing, and perceptual timing. Ashoori's study consisted of 15 non-demented patients with idiopathic Parkinson's who had no prior musical training and maintained their dopamine therapy during the trials. There were three 30-min training sessions per week for 1 month where the participants walked to the beats of German folk music without explicit instructions to synchronize their footsteps to the beat. Compared to pre-training gait performance, the Parkinson's patients showed significant improvement in gait velocity and stride length during the training sessions. The gait improvement was sustained for 1 month after training, which indicates a lasting therapeutic effect. Even though this was uncued it shows how the gait of these Parkinson's patients was automatically synchronized with the rhythm of the music. Also the lasting therapeutic effect shows that this might have affected the internal timing of the individual in a way that could not be accessed by other means.

There are two kinds of '''coin boards'''.

==Merchandise board==
The first kind, also known as a '''merchandise board''', is a variation on [[pull-tab]] games.  A game board of this type typically comes with a registered package of pull-tab tickets, a signers card, and a pay-out slip.

When a ticket is sold, the player opens the ticket to reveal its hidden numbers. If a number on the ticket matches a number on the game board, the player wins a prize and/or a chance at one or more seal prizes, which are revealed at the end of the game.

The game board displays the winning numbers along with the prizes. Some of the winners receive instant cash only, while some of the winning numbers match numbers on coins, wallets, or small panels that are built into the board. When a player opens a ticket containing one of these numbers, the game manager removes the coin or panel and gives it to the player. When the coin or panel is removed, a prize is revealed that may consist of instant cash, merchandise, and/or a chance at a seal prize. Instant cash or merchandise winnings are given to the player immediately by the manager.

If a player wins a chance at a seal prize, that player's name is added to the signers card. When the game ends—all the tickets sell out, or all the prizes are won—the manager opens the seals on the game board (or, in some versions, [[Scratchcard|scratches off an opaque substance]]) to reveal the winning numbers. The players whose names appear next to the winning numbers on the signers card win a seal prize. The seal prizes are usually the most valuable prizes.

[[United States]] collector coins are embedded in most coin boards sold in the US. Sometimes they are visible, and sometimes they are hidden behind panels. ''Coin boards'' contain only coin and cash prizes. ''Merchandise boards'' also contain coins, but some or all of the prizes consist of merchandise rather than cash.

The ''pay-out slip'' that is typically provided with each board lists the number of winners and values of all prizes. This information may be used for accounting purposes and to verify that the game complies with local gaming regulations.

==Coin Collecting Board==
[[File:Large Cent Board with Coins.jpg|thumb|Large Cent Board with Coins]]
The second kind of coin board, also known as a '''coin collecting board''', is one intended for collectors of coins to assemble a complete set of dates and mints for a particular coin series. It consists of a strip of [[Cardboard (paper product)|cardboard]], typically measuring 11 inches wide by 14 inches tall, with holes punched into it the size of the particular coins. A face paper having the same hole pattern carries the appropriate text and graphics. This typically consists of dates and mintmarks printed beneath each opening, sometimes with the addition of the number of pieces coined for that issue. A bold title for the coin series will appear at the top of the board, and the bottom of the face will have publication and copyright information. On some coin boards the bottom of the face will also provide some historical and technical information about the coin series, as well as misguided instructions for [[Cleaning (coinage)|cleaning]] the coins. On the most common coin boards, those published by Whitman, this information was later moved to the back of the board, and this is more typical for other publishers, too.

The coin collecting board was invented in 1934 by Joseph Kent Post, an [[engineer]] with Kimberly-Clark in [[Neenah, Wisconsin]]. His knowledge of [[paper]] products and their manufacture, combined with his interest in coin collecting, prompted him to devise this inexpensive means to collect coins. Debuting early in 1935, his first coin boards (one each for Indian Head and Lincoln Cents) were priced at [[quarter (United States coin)|25 cents]] retail, and these quickly proved successful. Sold at newsstands, [[stationery]] stores, [[nickel (United States coin)|5]]-and-[[dime (United States coin)|10]]-cent stores and similar retail outlets, coin boards were the point of entry for thousands of new coin collectors between 1935 and 1942, when most publishers discontinued them in favor of the more convenient coin folders still used today. Post marketed his coin boards under the brand name Kent Co. Coin Card, but later in 1935 he sold his invention to Whitman Publishing Company of [[Racine, Wisconsin]], which was already a leading producer of [[puzzle]]s, games and other paper novelties. Whitman became the most prolific of coin board producers and had the most extensive list of coin series titles.

Other publishers of coin boards included Colonial Coin &amp; Stamp Company and Gramercy Stamp Company, both located in [[New York City]], J. Oberwise &amp; Company and Lincoln Printing Company, both located in [[Los Angeles, California]], and Earl &amp; Koehler of Portland, [[Oregon]]. Whitman and Oberwise boards are seen with some frequency, but the other companies' boards are fairly scarce, those of Gramercy and E &amp; K being genuinely rare. Coin collecting boards have been retired from their original usage for the most part, and all are now considered quite collectable. Their collector value varies with their relative rarity and condition.

'''''Dance Se Puder''''' (Dance If You Can) is a [[Brazil]]ian [[talent show]], presented as a segment on Programa Eliana, from the [[Sistema Brasileiro de Televisão|SBT]] network. Several celebrities compete dancing various music styles. They perform to a panel usually consisting of three judges. Viewers can vote and eliminate a participant per round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbt.com.br/eliana/fiquepordentro/74618/Dance-Se-Puder-Carrossel-e-Chiquititas-quebram-tudo-em-quadro-de-danca.html|title=Dance Se Puder: Carrossel e Chiquititas quebram tudo em quadro de dança|author=|date=28 March 2016|publisher=[[Sistema Brasileiro de Televisão|SBT]]|accessdate=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Judges ==
Contestants are given points from 0 to 10 by three judges, including the choreographers Jaime Arôxa and Ivan Santos, which is present in almost all stages of the competition, along with a guest. At the end of the competition, the winner will take a cash prize of R$50,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbt.com.br/eliana/fiquepordentro/74500/Eliana-estreia-o-novo-quadro-%E2%80%9CDance-Se-Puder%E2%80%9D-neste-domingo.html|title=Eliana estreia o novo quadro "Dance Se Puder" neste domingo|author=|date=24 March 2016|publisher=[[Sistema Brasileiro de Televisão|SBT]]|accessdate=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Format ==
Two groups with five members each compete. Each contestant has to dance to a song chosen randomly and each has a week to prepare a dance performance. The two groups don't compete in the same week. The ''Supimpas'' show up on a Sunday and the ''Five Stars'' are presented in the following Sunday. Each contestant receives a score on a scale from 0 to 10 by the three jugdes. The three scores are calculated and the results of each group member are added together to form the final score. After the presentation and scores of the Five Stars, it's time to know which team scored higher. The team that has scored the most points is the winner, and all members are safe from elimination. The loser team is in the hot seat and the teammate who scored the less is automatically up for elimination. Plus, the loser team have to choose a second teammate of their own to face the audience's preference. The vote is set by text message.

In the second round, it was decided that one of the members of the ''Five Stars'' would have their points disregarded so that the average score of the teams would be balanced. Pedro Henrique was chosen, ironically being the one who had more points for his team in that round. If the Five Stars lost because of Pedro Henrique, he could not be placed in the bottom two since he won invencibility.

After the elimination of Jean in the third round, the ''Supimpas'' was depleted due to two consecutive eliminations. So the solution was move a member of the ''Five Stars'' to the ''Supimpas''. Gabriel was chosen and a random song was chosen for him for the fourth round.

In the fourth round the teams merged.

A '''dead pool''', also known as a '''death pool''', is a game of prediction which involves guessing when someone will die. Sometimes it is a bet where money is involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/columnist/popcandy/2004-07-06-pop-candy_x.htm |title=Celebrity obsession extends beyond the grave |work=[[USA Today]] |first=Whitney |last=Matheson |agency=Pop Candy (column) |date=July 6, 2004 |accessdate=August 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern application ==
In the early 20th century, death pools were popular in dangerous sports such as motorsport, for example the [[1911 Indianapolis 500|first edition]] of the [[Indianapolis 500]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.indystar.com/article/20110527/SPORTS0107/105270322/Even-first-Indy-500-race-spectacle |title=Even the first Indy 500 race was a spectacle |publisher=Indianapolis Star |first=Phillip B |last=Wilson |date=May 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Variants ===
A typical modern dead pool might have players pick out celebrities who they think will die within the year. Most games start on January 1 and run for 12 months, although there are some variations on game length and timing.{{cn|date=January 2014}} 

In 2000, website [[Fucked Company]] claimed to be a "dot-com dead pool" which invited users to predict the next [[dot-com bubble|Internet startups]] to fail during that era's [[dot com bust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Festa|first=Paul |url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1023-955447.html?hhTest=1 |title=Dot-com dead pool brakes for Ford |work=CNet News |date=2002-08-26|accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site itself folded in 2007 after a long history as a target for [[strategic lawsuit against public participation|strategic lawsuits against public participation]] by companies.&lt;ref name="rowan"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4064822,00.html|last=Rowan|first=David|title=The dead list|date=17 September 2000 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Application in contemporary society ===
The ''[[Rotten.com]] Dead Pool'', the largest in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url = http://www.macleans.ca/canada/features/article.jsp?content=20080201_143436_5540|title = Who's in your celebrity dead pool?|first = Kathleen|last = Kennedy|publisher = Maclean|date = February 1, 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140112063126/http://www.macleans.ca/canada/features/article.jsp?content=20080201_143436_5540|archivedate = 12 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses [[NNDB]] as its source of qualified celebrities, and as arbiter of their life status. 

The concept and success strategies are also detailed in a (previously) annual guide called ''The Dead Pool,'' written by [[KQRS-FM]] radio personality Mike Gelfand and author Mike Wilkinson. KQRS-FM in [[Minneapolis/St. Paul]], Minnesota also does an annual on air dead pool contest, where show hosts and listeners will attempt to pick which celebrity will die in that calendar year.

In his AP news article "Some say death pools are in poor taste"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061229/NEWS/612290302 |title=Some say death pools are in poor taste |publisher=Herald Tribune |first=Matt |last=Sedensky |date=December 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which brought national attention to ''The Old Blue Eyes Celebrity Death Watch''), author Matt Sedensky writes, "Players scour newspapers and Web sites for news on celebrities' health; they rely on tips from insiders; and they consider a public figure's lifestyle, absence of recent appearances and rumors of illness".

==In popular culture==
A dead pool is a key plot element of the 1988 final installment of the ''[[Dirty Harry (film series)|Dirty Harry]]'' film series, ''[[The Dead Pool]]''. Harry investigates the players, when several people listed in a game of dead pool die in suspicious circumstances.

The [[Marvel Comics]] character [[Deadpool]] takes his name after escaping from [[Ajax (comics)|Ajax]] and [[List of Weapon X members|Dr. Killebrew]], who formed their own dead pool based on which of their experimental subjects would die first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Truffaut-Wong|first1=Olivia|title=How Did 'Deadpool' Get His Name? The Answer Is Way More Obvious Than You'd Think|url=http://www.bustle.com/articles/140676-how-did-deadpool-get-his-name-the-answer-is-way-more-obvious-than-youd-think|website=Bustle|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2016 film ''[[Deadpool (film)|Deadpool]]'', the character takes his name from a dead pool of mercenaries, himself included, who are regular patrons at his favorite bar.

In the [[MTV]] show ''[[Teen Wolf (2011 TV series)|Teen Wolf]]'', the main plotline of [[Teen Wolf (season 4)|Season 4]] revolves around a dead pool specifically targeting the supernaturals of [[Beacon Hills]], which is set up by a mysterious character named The Benefactor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2408">Hosted by [[Duke University]], the '''Duke Annual Robo-Climb Competition (DARC)''' challenges students to create innovative wall-climbing [[robot]]s that can ascend vertical surfaces. The competition, which will be held on Duke's campus in [[Durham, North Carolina]], will allow students to showcase their wall-climbing technology in an international forum and encourage students to network with industry leaders.

==General Guidelines==

The rules for design are very flexible in order to generate maximum technological creativity. The competition will evaluate each [[robot]]’s performance in climbing a wall constructed of different materials and obstacles of various dimensions. Each student group will have an opportunity to practice with the wall prior to the competition. [[Judge]]s will score each [[robot]] in five functional areas: utility, navigation, versatility,  speed, and innovation. 

The  functional areas will specifically measure the robot’s ability to complete the following tasks:	
*[[Utility]]: Carry a load in proportion to its own body weight. 
*[[Navigation]]: Climb the full length of the wall without touching obstacles on the wall. 
*Versatility: Climb up surfaces composed of different materials and constructed in various shapes and sizes. 
*[[Speed]]: Climb up the full length of the wall from bottom to top in any manner as quickly as possible. 
*[[Innovation]]: Demonstrate unique capabilities, innovative use of technology, general creativity, or style.

==The Wall==

The wall, as depicted in below, will be used to test the [[robot]]’s performance in [[navigation]], versatility, and [[speed]]. (The [[utility]] and [[innovation]] tasks will be performed independently.) The wall measures 9 ft (2.743 m) in height and 8 ft (2.438 m) in width. The wall is made of [[ferrous]] metal plated on plywood, and contains three sections composed of different materials and obstacles. The first section, closest to the floor, contain a wooden ramp surface, two obstacles, and one hole. The second section, in the middle of the wall, contains an [[acrylic glass]] surface and three obstacles. The third section, at the top of the wall, contains a flat piece of carpet, two obstacles, and a slit.

A sequel titled ''[[Fast RMX]]'' was released on the [[Nintendo Switch]] on 3 March 2017 as a launch title for the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dornbush|first1=Jonathon|title=Fast RMX Announced for Nintendo Switch|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/13/fast-rmx-announced-for-nintendo-switch|website=IGN|accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
Fast Racing Neo is played using the left stick to steer, A to accelerate, B to brake, X or L to change phases, (colors between blue and orange) ZL and ZR to lean (drift) left and right respectively. Changing phases comes into play when, during a race, either blue or orange set pieces of the track are driven on. You would then change phases respective of the color to get a speed boost if done correctly. There are also phase boost pieces that will give you a boost through the air, or on to another part of the track. (I.e. over a gap.)

{{LGBT rights}}
'''Gay Blue Jeans Day''', alternatively '''National Gay Blue Jeans Day''' or just '''Gay Jeans Day''' is a celebration frequently advertised on college campuses in the United States in coordination with [[World AIDS Day]], [[Gay Equality Day]], [[Gay Pride Week]], or [[National Coming Out Day]]. Students are encouraged to wear jeans on a particular day to communicate their support of [[gay rights]].

The organizers of Gay Jeans Day at CMU analyse the action in this way.&lt;ref name="cmuPR"&gt;[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dtw/GJD/press_release.html Gay Jeans Day Press Release]&lt;/ref&gt;
* To let GLBT students on their campus know there is a supportive community.
* Jeans are chosen for this event because most people have a pair, and because deciding what to wear causes everyone—no matter what their sexual orientation—to think about how other people will react to their choice of clothing. 
* Allow straight people to think about how others will react to their perceived sexual orientation, and to experience having to alter their normal behavior to avoid being perceived as gay.

During campus debates in the early 1990s about such Jeans Days, the Lesbian and Gay Alliance at [[Bowling Green State University]] published a letter to the local newspaper indicating that part of the logic of using a common piece of clothing such as jeans was to demonstrate that, when jeans indicated participation in affirming such rights, people would deliberately wear another form of clothing in tacit protest.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

Many supporters of the protest&lt;ref name="cornell"&gt;[http://www.rso.cornell.edu/dash/jeans3.html Support for Gay Jeans Day]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051109170131/http://www.rso.cornell.edu/dash/jeans3.html |date=November 9, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that the protest was effective because it forced heterosexuals to do something to actively engage in homophobia (wear something else that day), or wear their usual attire (blue jeans) and become possible targets of homophobia themselves, and that many people unaware of the
protest might wear blue jeans and be educated by becoming targets of homophobia
&lt;ref name="lantern"&gt;[http://media.www.thelantern.com/media/storage/paper333/news/1999/02/01/Column/Blue-Jeans.Garnered.Unwitting.Support-46286.shtml '''Blue Jeans Garnered Unwitting Support''' Ohio State University Lantern ]&lt;/ref&gt;
Others argue that the protest simply forces everyone to examine their own
personal relationship to homophobia by leaving no space to be uninterested.

==Date==
The date and name of 'wear Blue Jeans if You're Gay Day' 'Jeans Day', 'Gay Jeans Day' etc. varies with place and time. BSC celebrates on October 11, the same day as [[National Coming Out Day]].&lt;ref name="Bridgewater State College" /&gt; Other universities celebrate the day some time during Pride month (June) or on a day when many students will be on campus (e.g., the first day of the semester).{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==History==

"Jeans Day" began at Rutgers University in 1974.&lt;ref name="Bridgewater State College"&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1796">Celebrated on the fourth Sunday of January, '''Goat throwing''' (in Spanish: ''Lanzamiento de cabra desde campanario'' or ''Salto de la cabra'') was a [[festival]] in [[Manganeses de la Polvorosa]], [[province of Zamora]], [[Spain]] where a group of young men threw a live [[goat]] from the top of a [[church (building)|church]] based on local legend. A crowd below would then catch the falling goat with a canvas sheet. In 2004 it was banned against animal rights and since then, toy goats have been used. 
[[Animal rights]] groups demanded the end of this festival several times,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marbella-guide.com/goat-throwing-in-Spain/ Goat Throwing in Spain] ( {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/62G2jRz4z?url=http://www.marbella-guide.com/goat-throwing-in-Spain/ |date=October 7, 2011 }})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/50360.stm |title=Spanish ceremony gets Lorelay's goat |work=[[BBC]] News |date=January 25, 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; until the practice was banned in 2000. The legend states that a goat, which miraculously fed the poor with its milk, fell out of the tower, but landed safely.[http://www.easyvoyage.co.uk/report/spain-s-top-ten-craziest-festivals-32738]
A toy [[plush]] goat was thrown in the 2014 celebration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://interbenavente.es/not/6140/y_una_cabra_salto_desde_el_campanario_en_manganeses_de_la_polvorosa Y una cabra saltó desde el campanario en Manganeses de la Polvorosa] in benavente.es&lt;/ref&gt;

'''God's Pottery''' is a [[New York City]] faux-Christian&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.funnysong.com/2008/07/gods-pottery-fake-or-real-christians.asp]&lt;/ref&gt; acoustic music and comedy duo. Its members are Wilson Hall (as "Jeremiah Smallchild") and Krister Johnson (as "Gideon Lamb"). They are both from [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charlestoncitypaper.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A22075]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The duo often would just mess around and make up fake bands.&lt;ref name="BA"&gt;{{cite web|title=BA #238: Krister Johnson|url=http://boxangeles.com/2018/07/29/ba-238-krister-johnson/|website=the Box Angeles podcast|date=August 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Hall was on vacation he came up with a Christian band idea and wrote some funny song titles's.&lt;ref name="BA"/&gt; Before they knew it they were writing lyrics and began performing in rooms in downtown NYC.&lt;ref name="BA"/&gt;

==Career==
Initially the idea was to goof around, but quickly comedians like [[Eugene Mirman]] and the [[Upright Citizens Brigade]] invited the duo to perform on their shows.&lt;ref name="BA"/&gt;

They made the act into an hour long show and traveled to [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] and signed with Mirman's manager.&lt;ref name="BA"/&gt; {{Quote frame |quote=The angle comedically was it was ludicrous, but there was no winking. We were always deeply in character. And we always took it seriously.|author=Krister Johnson&lt;ref name="BA"/&gt;}}

God's Pottery appeared on the [[Last Comic Standing 6|sixth season]] of the [[NBC]] [[reality show]] ''[[Last Comic Standing]]''. They were selected as semi-finalists in the [[New York City]] audition, then selected as finalists after a performance in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]]. They were eliminated along with [[Esther Ku]] in the first head-to-head elimination round on Episode 7, finishing in 12th place.&lt;ref name="BA"/&gt;

The duo released an [[Extended play|EP]] from [[Comedy Central Records]] entitled ''Live at [[Comix]]'' in December 2007.
 
They also wrote the book ''What Would God's Pottery Do''.

==Reception==
According to theatre critic [[Eric Bentley]]’s book ''The Playwright as Thinker'', when [[Erwin Piscator]] [[Theatre director|directed]] the premiere of ''Hoppla, We’re Alive!'' in 1925 and Frau Meller, the mother in the play, said "There’s only one thing to do: either hang one’s self {{sic}} or change the world," the youthful audience burst spontaneously into [[The Internationale|the ''Internationale'']].&lt;ref&gt;Bentley (1987).&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hoppla, We're Alive!'' was one of the books burned in the infamous Nazi book burning, along with 20,000 other left-wing and Jewish books.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

== Story ==
For ten long years, the small island nation of Azbaristan has been rent by a disastrous civil war. Two factions of the government―the Northern People's Republic of Azbaristan and the Southern Azbaristan Democratic Front―have fought over resources and thousands have died in the struggle. When the cease-fire was negotiated, the North controlled everything except the Southern capital city of Talvade. Knowing that the North's fiery leader, Chairman Kropanin Borzai, could order his forces to resume the war at any moment, the SADF wasted no time in petitioning the Western Democratic Alliance in a desperate plea for support. In exchange for exclusive trade rights to South Azbaristan's vast oil and natural gas reserves, the WDA sent help in the form of military advisors and hardware.

One exceptional individual is a fighter pilot known only by his callsign, Razor, who served in the Second Gulf War and the War on Terror and has extensive experience in both air-to-air and air-to-ground operations with almost any fixed-wing combat aircraft. The skill and ability of this one pilot rivals that of an entire squadron, North or South, and can hold his own even when outnumbered ten to one.

There are fifteen combat aircraft of four profiles to choose from―ground attack, multirole, fighter and air superiority―each with two versions. They're divided by generation and range from classics like the F-4 Phantom II and MiG-21 Fishbed to the most advanced stealth aircraft like the F-22 Raptor and Su-50 PAK-FA, armed with a variety of air-to-air and air-to-ground munitions. Some are more specialized to one mission profile than others, with armament weighted toward that specialization, but all carry a cannon.

==Reception==
When Trickstar Studios and Maximum Family Games announced the release of JASF, hopes were high for the game's reception. The air combat flight simulation craze was at its peak and games of the theme were experiencing record sales. The ''[[Ace Combat]]'' series was ultra-popular, the ''Blazing Angels'' were getting older but still maintaining a fan base among historical fiction nuts and Tom Clancy's ''[[Tom Clancy's H.A.W.X|HAWX]]'' games were on the rise. It was assumed that this one was destined to take its place in the air combat flight simulator community.

The game garnered a mixed reaction from the players, however. While the graphics were impressive, the game was plagued by a weak storyline, jumpy mechanics, a repetitive score, poor AI and some very frustrating rendering issues. It also lacked a choice mechanic, which applied rewards and consequences to choices the player made in-game. This made the experience very linear and locked players in a brain-melting "same-darn-thing-every-time" routine. With these shortcomings, the game experienced a brief life and met an abrupt end.

Reviews on aggregator [[Metacritic]] have been generally negative and below 50 points.&lt;ref name="meta"&gt;{{cite web|title=JASF: Jane's Advanced Strike Fighters Xbox 360|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/jasf-janes-advanced-strike-fighters/critic-reviews|publisher=Metacritic.com|accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Justice Pao''''' is a 236-episode television series from [[Taiwan]], first airing on [[Chinese Television System]] (CTS) from February 1993 to January 1994.

==Background==
The show stars [[Jin Chao-chun]] as the legendary [[Song dynasty]] official [[Bao Zheng]]. It was hugely popular in many countries in East Asia and Southeast Asia.

The series was originally scheduled for just 15 episodes. However, the show garnered high ratings when the initial episodes aired. Due to its popularity, CTS expanded the show to 236 episodes.

The [[TVB]] and [[ATV Home]] networks in Hong Kong both bought the series in an attempt to gain viewers. Competition between the two networks during the showing of the series was so severe that identical episodes were shown on both channels on the same night. It was also one of the first dramas that used [[NICAM]] technology ([[Second audio program|Dual Sound Switch]] Cantonese/Mandarin).

{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}}
[[File:Clark Gable - publicity.JPG|thumb|right|American actor [[Clark Gable]] was a leading man in over 60 major [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] productions. ]]
A l'''eading man''' is the [[actor]] who is the protagonist or plays a [[love interest]] to the [[leading actress]] in a film or play. A leading man is sometimes an all-rounder; capable of singing, dancing, and acting at a professional level.

A leading man can also be an actor who is often seen in romantic roles. An example of this would be [[Bruce Cabot]]'s role in ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]''. Less frequently, the epithet has been applied to an actor who is often associated with one particular actress; for example, [[Spencer Tracy]] had a similar association with [[Katharine Hepburn]].

'''Marathi Keertan''' Or " Kirtan " is an art of spiritual teaching through [[story-telling]].  It is typically performed by one or two main performers, called '''Keertankar''', accompanied by [[Pump organ|Harmonium]] and [[Tabla]] musicians.  It involves singing, acting, dancing, and story-telling, However it  is unlike any other performing art as it is basically pure glorification of god and godly acts.&lt;ref&gt;

Based on the format and subjects, Keertan / Kirtan has been classified into several types, described in the sections below.

== Origin ==
In Indian mythology the story of [[Prahlad|Bhakta Prahlad]] is famous for the uninterrupted devotion of a small child towards the almighty God, despite the obstacles created by his own father demon Hiranyakashipu. In the same "Avatar katha" child Prahlad the heavenly prince defines 9 types of "Bhakti" devotion. The relevant shloka

}}&lt;/ref&gt; says,

&lt;poem&gt;
Shrawanam keertanam vishnoh smaranam padsevanam |
Archanam vandanam dasyam sakhyam atmanivedanam ||
&lt;/poem&gt;

Meaning -There are 9 types (stages) of "Bhakti" or ways of devotion.
# Shravanam- Hearing stories of the god or heavenly virtues.
# Keertanam- Admire and sing the songs of god and goodness.
# Smaranam- Remembering god and goodness.
# Paad sevanam- Offering services to Godly places and godly work.
# Archanam- Performing pooja or offering decorations and comforts to god and good people.
# Vandanam- Respects feet of the almighty.
# Daasyam- Selfless and uninterrupted services to god. 
# Sakhyam- Making friendship with god,without material expectations. 
# Atmanivedanam- Offering one's everything to god without leaving back anything.

The second type namely, "Keertan or Kirtan" as is called is performing art of presenting sayings from old good books and mythological literature along with a tint of music, dance, humor, etc. Due to scarce means of transport and communications, the performers called Keertankars use to travel a lot. Town to town and place to place over long periods and offer performances so as to enlighten the people.  All over India this form of devotion is still live and prevalent in one form or another. All states have Keertans in Temples, Gurudwaras, mandirs and holy festival places too.

Keertan is also called Hari Keertan, Katha or Harikatha, Sankirtan, Nam sankeertan, etc. Keertan carries a tradition as old as times of age old muni Narada the best devotee of lord [[Vishnu]]. Naradiya keertan follows a format that is named after [[Narada]] the sacred son of Brahmadev or lord [[Brahma]]

It lasts for period of any length, ideally for half an hour to 3 hours at a stretch.

=== Dress code ===

==== Gentlemen ====
There are no hard and fast written rules,and different dress codes are prevalent in different geographic and social environments. However, by convention and as an age old practice and tradition, men wear
 
# White 9 yards cotton clothing [[dhoti]].(performers of Ramdasi keertankars  prefer clothing in saffron colour.)
# Knee long [[kurta]] with full sleeves, often called "Barabandi (that apparel has no buttons but 12 tags to tie or top called Zabba that is very common during festive occasions"
# A white or colored turban or "[[Puneri Pagadi]]" (a special crownlike decorative traditional head gear that is a cap, usually in saffron color) on the head.
# A 2 yard long colored "uttareeya or uparane "hanging on shoulders.
# The performer stands barefoot on a special mattress.musician with harmonium at his left and tabala on his right side.
# Fresh flower garland.
# Red or saffron kumkum or sandlewood tilak [[tilak]] on his forehead.(sometimes black colored "Bukka" also preferred especially by those practicing " varkari keertan".)

==== Ladies ====

# Usually wear the traditional Indian 6 yards or 9 yards saree.
# Traditional ornaments including ear rings,bracelets or bangles,Necklace,nose rings of different decors.
# fresh flower Garland, flowers decorating hair too.)
# Red Kumkum [[tilak]] on forehead.

The performer has accomplishment of musical instruments like harmonium, drums and string instruments of various types mostly "Zanz","chipali", "Tal" or "Chimata".Performer needs to study a lot of things in literature, music dance, humor and acting. He has to be a good orator and able debating artist. Usually the subjects are full of devotion, sacrifice, kindness, bravery, values of life, extinguishing ills of life, personal development of each individual physically and spiritually.

A lot of reading, practice of debating, musical training, sound memory and all round knowledge only can make a good performer in Keertan.  But after all,the main cause and purpose of Keertan is "glorification of god and godly acts"

=== Training ===

The main institute for training is "Keertan Kul", with office situated at Sangli and the "Shankaracharya of Karaveer Peeth " as Chair person.  There are some institutes offering the training in Keertan apart from individual schools and coaching classes in small towns all over India.

Marathi Naradiya keertan is taught at the following locations in its formal traditional way:
# Akhil Bharatiya Keertan Sanstha at Dadar, Mumbai&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://keertansanstha.in/itihaas/|title=इतिहास {{!}} अखिल भारतीय कीर्तन संस्था|last=|first=|date=|website=keertansanstha.in|language=mr|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Narad Mandir at Sadashiv Peth, Pune
# Kavikulaguru Kalidas Sanskrit University at Ramtek, Nagpur&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kksanskrituni.digitaluniversity.ac/Content.aspx?ID=872|title=Kavikulaguru Kalidas Sanskrit University|website=kksanskrituni.digitaluniversity.ac|access-date=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also some smaller schools at Goa, Beed and Ujjain.

These are working as independent autonomous bodies.  Different institutes offer education in different languages as suitable for the students and audiences around e.g. Institutes in Maharashtra prefer Marathi medium while those in Karnataka go for Kannada, Hindi is medium in U P and M.P,and Punjabi in Punjab and so on. Some have started training in various mediums including Hindi and English too along with the local language.

Naradiya Keertan knows no boundaries.It accepts saying from great authors all over the world,if they suit their subject under consideration as to prove the principle or spiritual lessons.The training is also available by postal course also if one wants to do it at home as self studying,with outside guidance in literature and music.A good knowledge of "Sanskrit" the ancient language of India is essential for a best performer.Mostly it tells stories of old mythology and religious deeds of great lives including god and godly men.

== Rashtriya Keertan ==
having taken inspiration from Indian freedom fighter Lokmanya Tilak, a medical practitioner from a small town of Wai- district Satara shri Dattopant Patwardhan, left his profession and became the pioneer of this form of Naradiya Keertan . He started this new era of Rashtriya keertan. he used the format of Naradiya keertan to teach masses and make awareness amongst them about the struggle for freedom against the British regime.He used many mythological stories from great epics which gave the message to masses and encouraged the movement for liberty.
In modern times, stories of great scientists, warriors, freedom fighters and social reformers National leaders,battles fought,  etc.are conveniently selected to entertain and educate the masses.So, Naradiya keertan is still a popular tool of mass education .It serves today as an art of spiritual training through entertainment.It is devotion with added stint of an art.

== Ramdasi Keertan ==

This form was named after [[Samarth Ramdas]].  Here the format is like Naradiya Keertan, only difference is it is based on poetry by Samarth Ramdas, and mostly the stories selected are from "Ramayana". In between chanting is also dedicated to lord Ram, glorifying his deeds and bravery. In his world known book "[[Dasbodh]]", Samarth Ramdas has explained in detail how a keertan should be performed effectively.

== Varkari Keertan ==
Varkari Keertan was pioneered by [[Namdev|Sant Namdev]] around 900 years back in Maharashtra.  It is usually based on poetry of 7 famous saints of Maharashtra namely, Saint Nivruttinath, [[Dnyaneshwar|Sant Dnyaneshwar]], Sopandev, Muktabai, saint Eknath, Saint Namdev, and [[Saint Tukaram]] maharaj.  Sometimes other sayings of saints are chosen.

The show goes for 2 or 3 hours as time permits and is not divided into parts like "Naradiya Keertan".  This form was effectively performed for years by personalities like "Hari Bhakti Parayan" (sincere devotee of god) Sonopant (mama) Dandekar, Dhunda maharaj Deglurkar, Babamaharaj Satarkar, Dekhanebuwa, and many others in modern times. An institute at Alandi near Pune offers training in this form of Keertan.

== Jugalbandi Keertan ==

This format is just like Naradiya Keertan. It was most evolved form that is performed by two persons together. The philosophy is presented from all angles, sometimes contradicting each other. The performance is more interesting as it goes in question-Answer form, sometimes creating a dialogue with audiences also. Finally both the performers come to a conclusion that gives some spiritual lesson for the listeners.

"'''Monster'''" is a song by American [[hip hop music|hip hop]] recording artist [[Kanye West]], released as the third single from his fifth studio album, ''[[My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy]]'' (2010). The track features rappers {{nowrap|[[Jay-Z]]}}, [[Rick Ross]], [[Nicki Minaj]], and singer [[Justin Vernon]] of [[indie folk]] group [[Bon Iver]]. All five credited performers have writing credits on the [[posse cut]], with the production handled by West and [[Mike Dean (producer)|Mike Dean]]. Lyrically, the song expresses often disturbing, [[horror film]] influenced concepts, with some comparing the track's eerie aesthetic to the [[Michael Jackson]] song "[[Thriller (song)|Thriller]]". The song contains an atmospheric, drum-heavy composition, notable for featuring no [[Sampling (music)|sample]]s.

Originally released through West's [[GOOD Friday]] initiative, a weekly free music giveaway started by the rapper to promote ''My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy'', the song was later confirmed to be featured on the album, and was released as a [[Music download|digital download]] on October 23. The song was listed amongst the best tracks of 2010 by publications, with ''[[NME]]'' placing it at number 53 on its list of the "150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years".

The song debuted and peaked on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] at position 18. The track was promoted with a [[music video]] directed by [[Jake Nava]]. The music video had several references to horror films and featured extensive horror imagery, with [[zombies]], decapitated corpses and heavily atmospheric cinematography. The music video was widely controversial, being banned from [[MTV]]. The video has been criticized for its portrayal of women, and the content of the video was described as weird and disturbing in nature.

==Background==

To promote his upcoming fifth album, West launched GOOD Fridays, a weekly free music giveaway.&lt;ref name=friday/&gt; The intention was to release a free new song every Friday for a few months, and the weekly tracks generally featured various rappers from his label, [[GOOD Music]], and other artists he usually collaborated with.&lt;ref name="friday"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kaufman |first=Gil |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1646259/20100823/west_kanye.jhtml |title=Kanye West Promises New Song Every Week Through Christmas – Music, Celebrity, Artist News |publisher=MTV.

Ross had the concept of the song explained to him by West, which according to Ross, blew him away in presentation.&lt;ref name=BAWSE/&gt; West was so impressed by Ross that he invited him back to his studio during the final stages of the album, where he also appeared on "[[Devil in a New Dress]]".&lt;ref name="synth"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rodriguez|first=Jayson|title=Rick Ross Recalls 'Pressure' Of Kanye West's 'Devil In A New Dress'|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1652169/rick-ross-recalls-pressure-kanye-wests-devil-new-dress.jhtml|date=2010-11-10|work=MTV|publisher=Viacom|accessdate=2011-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Ross was there, both Jay-Z and Minaj were recording their verses.&lt;ref name=BAWSE/&gt; Ross expressed his admiration for Minaj, who impressed him during the recording.&lt;ref name=BAWSE/&gt; He stated that what he had observed had earned him respect for Minaj, who called the recording process a "moment of history".&lt;ref name=BAWSE/&gt;

Ross expressed admiration for Minaj, and praised her lyricism. }}

Minaj expressed excitement when approached to collaborate on the song, and she had contributed 32 [[Bar (music)|bars]] to the track.&lt;ref name=CREW/&gt; Her main inspiration behind working on the track was the possibility of meeting Jay-Z, with whom she was obsessed since a young age.&lt;ref name="OBSESSED"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ziegbe|first=Mawuse|title=Nicki Minaj Remembers Being 'Obsessed' With Jay-Z|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1651069/nicki-minaj-remembers-being-obsessed-with-jay-z.jhtml|date=2010-10-28|work=MTV|publisher=Viacom|accessdate=2011-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to her, she literally couldn't have a conversation without quoting a line by him, and it was a dream come true to collaborate with the artist.&lt;ref name=OBSESSED/&gt; Minaj had recorded her lines around four months before the lyrics finally appeared on the song.&lt;ref name=CREW/&gt; Minaj described both Jay-Z and West as "icons", and stated that she was blessed to be working with them.&lt;ref name=CREW/&gt; In an interview with [[Rap-Up]], Minaj mused "never in a billion years would've thought that I would've not only been on a song with one of them but both them".&lt;ref name="CREW"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ryan|first=Sean|title= Nicki Minaj Addresses Marriage Rumors, Talks "Monster"| url= http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.12166/title.nicki-minaj-addresses-marriage-rumors-talks-monster|date=2010-08-08|work=HipHopDX|accessdate=2011-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Justin Vernon's involvement on the song stemmed from being approached by West directly.&lt;ref name=IVER/&gt; West first got into contact with Vernon when he directly phoned him, with the intention of sampling his song "Woods".&lt;ref name=IVER/&gt; The two talked on the phone for about 40 minutes, where West explained some of the concepts for the project, and invited him down to his studio in Hawaii.&lt;ref name=IVER/&gt; West is a big admirer of Bon Iver's album ''[[For Emma, Forever Ago]]'', and was impressed with Vernon's unique use of [[auto-tune]]. The two artists became friends while playing games of [[basketball]] together, and West introduced him to [[Jeff Bhasker]], one of his main producers.&lt;ref name=IVER2/&gt;&lt;ref name=IVER/&gt;

Vernon was sampled on another song from the album, "[[Lost in the World]]" and appears on vocals on "Monster".&lt;ref name=IVER/&gt; While there during recording sessions, he had reportedly recorded 10 tracks.&lt;ref name=IVER2/&gt; He watched Minaj record her verse, and he too, expressed admiration for Minaj's performance on the song, however he noted that initially he had no idea who she was.&lt;ref name=IVER/&gt; Vernon described the process as highly artistic, stating that the fourteen-hour day recording schedule allowed for a lot of fun and creativity.&lt;ref name="IVER"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hill|first=Logan|title=Bon Iver's Justin Vernon on Recording Kanye's Dark Fantasy|url=http://www.vulture.com/2010/11/bon_ivers_justin_vernon_on.html|date=2010-10-14|work=Vulture.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Rick Ross drops by to say hi, keeping his appearance so brief that I can't help but wonder what he's even doing here. Justin Vernon inexplicably bookends the thing, pushing his [[falsetto]] into Antony range on the outro and muttering befuddling lyrics that have nothing to do with the rest of the song. All this over the straight-up funkiest beat Kanye West has made in years, a rippling [[Electro (music)|electro]] push-pull that adds an effortless strut to his recent progged-out chilliness.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"She switches up her delivery repeatedly over the course of 31 bars, veering between cartoonish sweetness and unhinged villainy. She dramatizes the jarring dynamic shifts in the clip by appearing as a fanged [[dominatrix]] torturing a far more innocent version of herself in a neon pink wig and frilly white dress.

Due to negative reactions the video was removed from Kanye West's [[YouTube]] channel. It is unknown if it violated YouTube's policy against showing gory content or if [[Vevo]] took it down. However, the video is available on Nicki Minaj's YouTube channel.

==Legacy==
Minaj's verse has become so iconic and acclaimed that artists like [[Demi Lovato]], [[Chloë Grace Moretz]], [[Ed Sheeran]], [[Troye Sivan]], [[Millie Bobby Brown]], among others, have rapped the verse in concerts or interviews.

In January 2016, singer [[Adele]] rapped Nicki Minaj's verse on ''[[The Late Late Show with James Corden]]'' during a segment called "Carpool Karaoke", which Minaj reacted to with praise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/adele-88-1194635 |title=Nicki Minaj reacts to Adele rapping her 'Monster' verse: 'She is mad ratchet' |publisher =NME |date= 2016-01-15|accessdate=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; British actress [[Millie Bobby Brown]] rapped the same verse while on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' with [[Jimmy Fallon]] in September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Monroe, Jazz|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/67967-watch-stranger-things-millie-bobby-brown-aka-eleven-rap-nicki-minajs-monster-verse/ |title=Watch "Stranger Things"' Millie Bobby Brown (aka Eleven) Rap Nicki Minaj's "Monster" Verse |publisher =Pitchfork |date= 2016-09-01|accessdate=2016-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|article|date=March 2011}}
'''Nicolas Economou''' ({{lang-gr|Νικόλας Οικονόμου}}; 11 August 1953 – 29 December 1993) was a Cypriot composer and pianist born in [[Nicosia]], Cyprus.

A precociously gifted pianist, Economou came to international attention at the 1969 [[International Tchaikovsky Competition|Tchaikovsky Competition]] when he was 16.  After studying at the [[Moscow Conservatory|Tchaikovsky Conservatory]] in Moscow he eventually moved via [[Düsseldorf]] to [[Munich]].  From his base there he established himself throughout Europe as a concert pianist, composer, arranger, conductor and organiser of music festivals.  In December 1993 Economou was killed in an automobile accident in Cyprus while driving at night in thick fog.

==Precocious talent==
Nicolas Economou was the first child of his family. His parents, who loved classical music, decided to expose him to music as a creative outlet rather than a career. At the age of five, he started taking piano lessons and he soon revealed his extraordinary talent by improvising on the piano and composing short pieces of music. When [[Solon Michaelides]], the celebrated Cypriot composer, conductor, musicologist and friend of the family heard him play for the first time, when Economou was not yet seven years old, he declared: "This child is a blessing to his parents, Cyprus, and the World". On his advice, Economou's musical training was undertaken by George Arvanitakis.

The turning point in Economou's life came at the age of ten. It had to be decided whether he would eventually take up music as a career. Again Solon Michaelides, who was following Economou's progress, suggested that his musical education should be continued outside Cyprus where he would have greater opportunities. In September 1964, after an audition, he was accepted at the [[Moscow Conservatory|Special School of Music of the Tchaikovsky Conservatory]] in Moscow, a preparatory school for youngsters to enter the Conservatory. In December of that year, in [[Athens]], he won the "Keti Papaioannou" Panhellenic Competition for young musicians up to the age of seventeen. Events themselves were now forming the course of Economou's life. The following year at the age of twelve, far away from his family and culture, he began his musical studies in Moscow.

After three years of studies, his piano teacher suggested that he should enter the [[International Tchaikovsky Competition|Tchaikovsky Competition]], a world-renowned international music competition. After a year of preparation and at the age of sixteen, he participated in the competition, gaining favourable reviews from the press, radio and television. A year later, he was admitted to the Tchaikovsky Conservatory itself. Leaving Moscow in 1972, he moved to [[Düsseldorf]], before settling in [[Munich]], Germany.

==Pianist==
As a performer, he appeared in Europe, the USA and Canada as well as the USSR, Japan, Iceland, and Israel. He performed solo, and with orchestras and other famous performers and composers like [[Martha Argerich]], [[Rodion Shchedrin]], [[Sviatoslav Richter]], [[Michel Beroff]], [[Chick Corea]] and others. As well as performing in concert with Martha Argerich and Chick Corea, he also recorded with them. The record with Chick Corea, entitled ''On Two Pianos'', was the result of a series of concerts in Germany in 1981/82 during which the two musicians interacted with each other by improvising in their own style. He also released two other solo albums.

The Nicolas Economou Foundation posthumously published seven CDs under the series title ''L'Art de Nicolas Economou'', compiling hours of recordings that Economou left behind.

==Composer==
Economou studied composition with [[Vladislav Zolotaryov]] and [[Wilhelm Killmayer]]. He wrote music for piano, for small ensembles, symphonic music and film music. Many of his compositions have themes and rhythms from Cyprus and the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. Some of his compositions are: ''Children Studies'', ''Sonata for Chick'' (dedicated to Chick Corea) for piano, ''Cyprus Picture'' and ''Cyprus Dances'' for an [[musical ensemble|ensemble]] of eight players.  He wrote the soundtracks for twelve films including ''[[Rosa Luxemburg (film)|Rosa Luxemburg]]'' and ''[[Marianne and Juliane|Die bleierne Zeit]]'', both by [[Margarethe von Trotta]].

Economou also arranged [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[The Nutcracker|The Nutcracker Suite]]'' (originally written for orchestra) for two pianos, dedicated to his daughter and Martha Argerich's daughter. Performers and critics alike have praised this arrangement, since all the musical colours portrayed by the orchestra are very well conveyed by two pianos. Economou also arranged Vivaldi's ''[[The Four Seasons (Vivaldi)|The Four Seasons]]'' for four pianos.

==Conductor and organiser==
In 1978, with the collaboration of the City of Munich, Economou organised a "Cyprus Week" in Munich, with artists from Cyprus including actors, musicians, painters, sculptors and the late shadow performer, Paphios. He was also the founder of the "Solisten Ensemble" in Munich with which he performed some of his compositions and those of other composers. He was the co-founder of the well-established [[Münchner Klaviersommer]] (Munich Piano Summer). In February 1992 he organised in [[Venice]] the first of a series of piano festivals he intended to establish in Europe with the title "Pianisti non-Solo".

As a conductor he directed the distinguished [[Moscow Chamber Orchestra]], the [[Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra|Bavarian Symphony Orchestra]], Germany's Youth Orchestra and the La Fenice Opera Orchestra of Venice.

==Recognition and awards==
In acknowledgement of his services and contribution to culture and the arts in general, Economou was honoured on various occasions by several bodies.
* The city of Munich honoured him in 1979 for his contribution to the arts, as a composer and interpreter of classical and modern music, with the award for "Best Interpreter of the Year".
* In 1983, the Bavarian TV produced a television portrait of Economou, more than an hour in duration, in which he is shown in all facets of his creative life. The film, called ''Kreisleriana'' (after the [[Kreisleriana|work for piano]] by Schumann), was directed by Klaus Voswinkel.
* Since 1988, a seat bearing his name has stood in the [[Prinzregententheater]] of the City of Munich, next to seats of other prominent artists.
* In Cyprus he was honoured with the 1991 "Tefkros Anthias and Theodosis Pierides Award".
* Because of his outstanding contribution to music, he was accepted in 1992 into one of Europe's prominent societies, the Academia Scientiarum et Artium Europaea (The [[European Academy of Sciences and Arts]]), members of which are [[Nobel prize winners]], politicians, artists, church dignitaries and others.

==Character==
Economou was a thinker and expressed many of this thoughts and ideas in literary work, poetry and prose. He was a citizen of the World and refused to accept borders, either in the geographical sense, in artistic expression or ideas.

He had many well-known friends, not only musicians but also persons coming from a variety of intellectual backgrounds. Among them as the late philosopher and playwright [[Friedrich Dürrenmatt]], with whom he had a special bond. Others include [[Arthur Miller]] and his family, [[Rodion Shchedrin]] and the legendary Maja Plisestkaya, [[Maximilian]] and [[Maria Schell]], [[Volker Schlondorff]] and [[Margarethe von Trotta]]. In [[Greece]] he had close ties with the late Solon Michaelides and [[Manos Hadjidakis]].

Even though he spent almost all of his life far away from his birthplace, deep inside he remained a Cypriot with all the characteristics of the Mediterranean people. He never lost touch with the island and during his visits to Cyprus he used to mix with all kinds of people, regardless of their background. He greatly enjoyed discussing politics and would eagerly prompt discussions on life and philosophical issues. He was always frank and direct and had no inhibitions in expressing an opinion, and for this he was very much respected.

==Personal life==
Nicolas Economou is the father of [[Semeli Economou]] from his first marriage to Greek-American born Maritsa Tsirigos.

'''Nintendo Campus Challenge''' was a video game competition sponsored by [[Nintendo]] and held at nearly 60 college campuses and other events throughout the United States, including a Canadian Tour.  There were two Campus Challenge events, one in [[Nintendo Campus Challenge 1991|1991]] and another in [[Nintendo Campus Challenge 1992|1992]].

==1991 games==
[[File:Campus-challenge-1991.jpg|thumb|right|''Nintendo Campus Challenge 1991'' Cartridge]]
Like [[Nintendo World Championships]], the official event gave each player 6 minutes and 21 seconds to play in the contest, but there are three different minigames. The first minigame of the competition is ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', where players must collect 25 coins. The next minigame is a version of [[Pin*Bot (video game)|''Pin*Bot'']]'','' where players must get 100,000 points. The final minigame is [[Dr. Mario (video game)|''Dr. Mario'']], which lasts until the time expires. Once time expires, a player's score is totaled using the following formula:

*''Super Mario Bros. 3'' score times 10
*+ ''PinBot'' score
*+ ''Dr. Mario'' score times 100
The following advertisement was printed in Game Players Strategy Guide to Nintendo Games Vol. 4, issue #5:

''"Ok, you should really be studying for that calculus test next week. And there's a paper due in English Lit. But who cares? The Nintendo Camps Challenge is coming! Nintendo of America is following up its hugely successful Nintendo World Champions with its first Nintendo Campus Challenge. During the next year, competitions will be held at 50 universities and popular spring break gatherings throughout the U.S. One lucky student will become the 'college valedictorian of videogames.' Contestants will play a special combination of three Nintendo games - Dr. Mario, Rad Racer, and Super Mario Bros. 3. There are categories for both men and women, and all finalists receive round-trip airfare to the January 1992 championship. Prizes include new cars and cash scholarships. Meanwhile, don't let those grades slide too badly."'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.neswarpzone.com/campus.html|title = Nintendo Campus Challenge|date = |accessdate = 2014-10-28|website = NESWarpZone.com|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Rad Racer]]'' was not used in the final version of the competition cartridge, as it had previously appeared on the [[Nintendo World Championships]] cartridge and that both games used a different mapper chip than what the 1991 Nintendo Campus Challenge uses.

==1991 cartridge==
{{see also|Video game collecting}}

There is only one known original copy of the 1991 Campus Challenge cartridge known to exist. The game was found by a [[Video game collecting|video game collector]], Rob Walters, at a garage sale in New York &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Greatest Video Game Garage Sale | publisher = VGPC.com | url = http://blog.videogamepricecharts.com/2009/07/greatest-video-game-garage-sale-ever.html | accessdate = 2009-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2006. The game sold for $14,000 in July 2009 to collector JJ Hendricks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Nintendo Campus Challenge 1991 Price History | publisher = VGPC.com | url = http://www.videogamepricecharts.com/game/nes/nintendo-campus-challenge-1991 | accessdate = 2009-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After 3 months, Hendricks resold the game on eBay for $20,100.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.racketboy.com/journal/game-collecting/nes1991-nintendo-campus-challenge-cartridge|title = Behind the Sale: 1991 Nintendo Campus Challenge Cartridge|date = 2009-10-22|accessdate = 2014-10-28|website = RacketBoy.com|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1991 event structure==
The [[Nintendo Campus Challenge 1991]] was held at 58 college campuses and [[spring break]] locations. The event consisted of three stages. The main stage had the competition on 12 different game stations. The second stage was [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] systems with various games while the third stage had [[Game Boy]] systems. Attendees at the events could play as many times as they wanted and the highest score at the end of the day was announced the winner.

The winner from each location was flown to [[Disney World]] in [[Orlando]], [[Florida]] over [[New Year]]'s weekend in January 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Campus Challenge Video | publisher = Youtube.com | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQuZb90i6WY | accessdate = 2017-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All the competitors played in the first round followed by a second round with the six highest scoring players only. The final round was a head-to-head match between Steven Lucas and Matt Sekelsky. Steven Lucas won with a score of 2,394,130.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Campus Challenge Winner Video | publisher = Youtube.com | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGjGrkavHYA | accessdate = 2017-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SNES Campus Challenge cart has an unusual shape, with the PCB board parallel to the SNES. The cart has four ROM chips, presumably three for each game plus the additional one to link them all together. It also has the [[List of Super NES enhancement chips|DSP-1]] chip, which is used in ''[[Pilotwings]]''. There is a set of eight switches, which were likely used to change the settings in the game, although they seemed to have no effect when changed. A phone jack is present, likely to relay the scores to a Nintendo server to determine the grand prize winner.

The rules are the same as the 1991 version, except with three SNES minigames. The first minigame of the competition is ''[[Super Mario World]]'', where players must collect 50 coins (very similar to Nintendo World Championships' first minigame, ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]''). The second game is a version of ''[[F-Zero]],'' where players must complete two laps. The final minigame is ''Pilotwings,'' where players must land on two targets successfully. Once time expires, a player's score is totaled using the following formula:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Nintendo Campus Challenge | publisher = MarioWiki.com | url = http://www.mariowiki.com/Nintendo_Campus_Challenge | accessdate = 2009-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Super Mario World'' score
*+ ''F-Zero'' score times 100
*+ ''Pilotwings'' score times 10,000

== 1992 cartridge ==
There are reportedly three cartridges in existence,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://kotaku.com/5868520/and-now-the-25000-super-nintendo-cartridge|title = And Now, the $25,000 Super Nintendo Cartridge|date = 2011-12-15|accessdate = 2014-10-28|website = Kotaku.com|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; but only two known are known. One was found at the same [[New York City]] garage sale by Rob Walters as the 1991 cartridge. The cartridge is owned by a video game collector named Rick Bruns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Nintendo 1992 Campus Challenge | publisher = SNESMaps.com | url = http://snesmaps.com/maps/1992Challenge/1992Challenge.html | accessdate = 2009-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The second one was found in an attic of a former employee of a company who did projects for Nintendo.  Nintendo sent the cartridge to the company along with some systems and other games.

==1992 event structure==
The 1992 "Nintendo Campus Challenge" competition was held at 35 college campuses throughout the US, including Central Michigan University, Arizona State University, and Texas A&amp;M University. The winner at each location won a [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] Super Set with two controllers and a ''Super Mario World'' game cartridge, along with individual copies of '' F-Zero'', and ''Pilotwings''. Consolation prizes of $100, $75, and $50 were awarded to second, third, and fourth place contestants. The winner of the whole US competition won $10,000. In addition, all the winners were put into a draw to win prizes of $5,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.snescentral.com/article.php?id=0790|title = Nintendo Campus Challenge|date = |accessdate = 2014-10-28|website = SNESCentral.com|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the competition cartridge, Nintendo sent previews for new games, including ''[[Contra III: The Alien Wars]]'', [[Rival Turf!|''Rival Turf'']],'' [[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past]]'', ''[[The Addams Family (video game)|The Addams Family]]'', and ''[[Super Scope 6]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!topic/rec.games.video/MDmDn6main0|title = Nintendo Campus Challenge|date = 1991-04-14|accessdate = 2014-10-28|website = Usenet.com|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar competitions were held in Europe and Japan in 1992. The winner of the US competition, Jeff Hanson, won against the winner of the Japanese competition, Yuichi Suyama, and became the World Champion at the 1993 [[Consumer Electronics Show]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Greatest Moments in Video Game History|last = Weston|first = D.B.|publisher = DB Weston|date = 2012-08-07|isbn = 9781301174140|location = |pages = 62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[film studies|film]], [[diegesis]] refers to the story world, and the events that occur within it. Thus, non-diegesis are things which occur outside the story-world. 

A '''non-diegetic insert''' is a film technique that combines a shot or a series of shots cut into a sequence, showing objects represented as being outside the space of the narrative. Put more simply, a non-diegetic insert is a scene that is outside the story world which is "inserted" into the story world. Diegetic could also refer to sound in media or film studies.

==Examples==
* Three images shown during the disastrous opening night of the play in ''[[The Band Wagon]]'', as a metaphor to highlight how much of a flop the show is.
* Sky sequences shown in [[Gus Van Sant]]'s [[Elephant (2003 film)|''Elephant'']].
*Most famously in ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'' a bandit, either following the character's death or before the narrative began, shot his gun directly at the audience.
* Starting scene of Charlie Chaplin's film [[Modern_Times_(film)|Modern Times]].

The '''persona and reception of Roman Reigns''' refers to the ascendency of American [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] [[Roman Reigns]] (Leati Joseph Anoaʻi) within [[WWE]], which has divided critical and public opinion.

Reigns debuted on the [[WWE]] main roster in November 2012 (having performed in [[Florida Championship Wrestling|its developmental system]] since 2010) as part of [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#S|stable]] [[The Shield (professional wrestling)|The Shield]] and was well-received by fans and critics. Support began to dwindle upon Reigns's transition to a [[Face (professional wrestling)|heroic]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#M|main event]] singles act in 2014, largely due to his perceived forced [[Push (professional wrestling)|push]]. This would manifest itself with Reigns main eventing consecutive [[WrestleMania|WrestleManias]] (WWE's premier annual [[List of WWE pay-per-view events|pay-per-view event]]) facing [[Brock Lesnar]] in a [[professional wrestling match types#Singles matches|singles]] turned [[professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|triple threat match]] due to [[Seth Rollins]]’ [[Money in the Bank (2014)|Money in the Bank cash-in]] for the [[WWE Championship|WWE World Heavyweight Championship]] at [[WrestleMania 31]], [[Triple H]] in a singles match for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship at [[WrestleMania 32]], [[The Undertaker]] in a [[professional wrestling match types#No Holds Barred|No Holds Barred match]] at [[WrestleMania 33]] and Brock Lesnar for the second time one-on-one in a singles match for the [[WWE Universal Championship]] at [[WrestleMania 34]] while being booed in all four main events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Newby|first=Jake|title=WWE needs to finally do something different with Pensacola's Roman Reigns|url=https://www.pnj.com/story/news/local/2018/04/09/wwe-needs-finally-do-something-different-pensacolas-roman-reigns/499541002/|work=[[Pensacola News Journal]]|accessdate=23 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180423232925/https://www.pnj.com/story/news/local/2018/04/09/wwe-needs-finally-do-something-different-pensacolas-roman-reigns/499541002/|archive-date=23 April 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also won the WWE World Heavyweight Championship three times, having a "mixed, at best" crowd reaction on his first world title win, being cheered for his second and being completely booed for his third, but cheered for his first WWE Universal Championship win at [[SummerSlam (2018)|SummerSlam]] in August 2018.

Wrestling journalists have offered both praise and criticism for Reigns, noting both his talent and WWE's apparent attempts to conceal fan hostility towards him. David Shoemaker of ''[[Grantland]]'' wrote in 2016 that Reigns was the company's "most despised wrestler" in over 25 years.&lt;ref name="shoemaker"/&gt; Fans have taken issue with Reigns over various reasons: his perceived special treatment, real-life demeanor, wrestling moveset, speaking skills and character presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Keller|first1=Wade|title=Coach telling fans they're sheep if they boo Reigns is not doing Reigns any favors|url=https://www.pwtorch.com/site/2018/03/01/kellers-take-coach-telling-fans-theyre-sheep-boo-reigns-not-reigns-favors/|publisher=Pro Wrestling Torch|accessdate=March 25, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180325111514/https://www.pwtorch.com/site/2018/03/01/kellers-take-coach-telling-fans-theyre-sheep-boo-reigns-not-reigns-favors/|archive-date=March 25, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Reigns was [[Suspension (punishment)|suspended]] for drug use, [[Yahoo!

At [[Money in the Bank (2018)|Money in the Bank]], Reigns' match with [[Jinder Mahal]] was widely rejected by crowd in Illinois. Within the first two minutes of the match, once again, chants of "CM Punk" and "Boring" were heard. The crowd continued to ignore the match by playing with beach balls, performing the Mexican wave, and continued chants of other wrestlers names, booing officials who confiscated the beach balls, and continued negative chants about the match. Every other match on the card, however, was well received. In July 2018 on ''Raw'', Reigns told fans who "boo", "hate", or claim that he "is being crammed down our throats" to "learn to like it or close your mouth." Meanwhile, Wade Keller of ''Pro Wrestling Torch'' criticised Anoa’i for arguing that he deserves his push due to hard work and winning many titles. Keller pointed out that Anoa’i "doesn't work harder than dozens of other colleagues, yet he acts as if he's special", and that Reigns' title wins were "granted by Vince McMahon."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Keller |first1=Wade |title=7/23 WWE Raw Results |url=https://www.pwtorch.com/site/2018/07/23/7-23-wwe-raw-results-kellers-report-on-the-historic-announcements-by-vince-stephanie-and-triple-h-plus-more-summerslam-developments/ |website=pwtorch.com |accessdate=July 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Extreme Rules (2018)|Extreme Rules]], Reigns again received overwhelming boos while his opponent [[Bobby Lashley]] was wildly cheered.

=== Universal Champion and hiatus (2018–present)===
In August 2018 at SummerSlam, the audience started out giving Reigns a fairly mixed reaction during his entrance. Following Braun Strowman's announcement of his plan to cash-in post match, the crowd cheered. A brief chant of "Let's go Roman/Roman Sucks" filled the arena at one point, followed by chants of "You both suck" directed at both Lesnar and Reigns. in the ring. When Reigns pinned Lesnar to win the WWE Universal Championship, the crowd cheered. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.mykhel.com/wwe/wwe-rumour-brock-lesnar-not-defending-universal-title-until-summerslam-091335.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SSlam2018"&gt;{{cite web|last=Powell|first=Jason|title=Powell’s WWE SummerSlam 2018 live review: Brock Lesnar vs. Roman Reigns for the WWE Universal Championship, AJ Styles vs. Samoa Joe for the WWE Championship, Alexa Bliss vs. Ronda Rousey for the Raw Women’s Championship, Daniel Bryan vs. The Miz|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2018/08/19/powells-wwe-summerslam-2018-live-review-brock-lesnar-vs-roman-reigns-for-the-wwe-universal-championship-aj-styles-vs-samoa-joe-for-the-wwe-championship-alexa-bliss-vs-ronda-rousey-for-the-raw/|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|accessdate=August 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following night on ''Raw'', Reigns was again booed early in the show, but received a mixed reaction for suggesting that he defend his newly-won championship against [[Finn Bálor]] later that night. After beating Bálor, Reigns was again heavily booed by the crowd, which increased in intensity after the match when Braun Strowman attempted to cash in his Money in the Bank title shot. The subsequent Shield reunion and attack on Strowman was positively received by the Brooklyn audience, but was viewed by many as a cheap attempt to garner positive reactions for Reigns.&lt;ref name="Raw08202018"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2018/08/20/8-20-powells-wwe-raw-live-tv-review-the-night-after-wwe-summerslam/|title=8/20 Powell’s WWE Raw Live TV Review: The night after WWE SummerSlam, new champions Roman Reigns and Ronda Rousey, Triple H appearance, Dean Ambrose vs. Dolph Ziggler|date=August 20, 2018|last=Powell|first=Jason|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|accessdate=August 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Hell in a Cell (2018)|Hell in a Cell]], Reigns defended his Universal Championship against Braun Strowman, during which Reigns was booed heavily while the villainous Strowman was wildly cheered by fans. The match was victim to high controversy, with the first incident being when special guest referee [[Mick Foley]] counted Reigns down for a three count, but instead of Strowman getting the victory, the pinfall was simply ignored, with the second being when the match ended in a no contest after interference from a returning Brock Lesnar. After the match ended, the network stream abruptly ended with many saying this was done to avoid broadcasting the heavy boos from fans with many taking to social media claiming that chants of "Bullshit!" and "We want refunds!" along with heavy booing broke out as Reigns, Strowman and Lesnar all had walked to the back.&lt;ref name="HIAC2018"&gt;{{cite web|last=Powell|first=Jason|title=Powell’s WWE Hell in a Cell 2018 live review: Roman Reigns vs. Braun Strowman in an HIAC for the WWE Universal Championship with Mick Foley as referee, AJ Styles vs. Samoa Joe for the WWE Title, Jeff Hardy vs. Randy Orton in an HIAC match|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2018/09/16/powells-wwe-hell-in-a-cell-2018-live-review-roman-reigns-vs-braun-strowman-in-an-hiac-for-the-wwe-universal-championship-with-mick-foley-as-referee-aj-styles-vs-samoa-joe-for-the-wwe-title-jeff/|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|accessdate=September 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Routledge, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Several series of events in the [[United Kingdom]] and elsewhere offer pub philosophy in a variety of formats, typically involving an invited speaker and some degree of open discussion. Among the more long-standing of these are:

*Big Ideas (based in London, UK) https://web.archive.org/web/20100912055756/http://bigi.org.uk/
*Kant's Cave (held in London, UK, by [[Philosophy For All]])

*PhiloMadrid (based in Madrid, Spain)
*Philosophy In Pubs (based in Liverpool, UK) http://www.philosophyinpubs.co.uk
*PIPS Brighton (based in Brighton, UK) http://www.pips-brighton.org.uk/
*The [[Stoa]] (based in [[Faversham]], Kent, UK)
*[[Skeptics in the Pub]]
*Thinking While Drinking (based in [[San Diego]], [[California]]) http://thinkingwhiledrinking.org

Pub Philosophy groups, while often run by amateurs, have sometimes been recruited by more mainstream institutions to provide a distinctively participatory public forum. Such alliances have included [[Tate Liverpool]] and [[University of Chester]] working with Philosophy in Pubs,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/liverpool/eventseducation/talksdiscussions/22109.htm Tate Liverpool] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101108093210/http://www.tate.org.uk/liverpool/eventseducation/talksdiscussions/22109.htm |date=2010-11-08 }} Retrieved 02-09-10.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Brighton Science Festival]] 2010 working with PIPS Brighton&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brightonscience.com/2010/programme/pips.html Brighton Science Festival 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120721203722/http://www.brightonscience.com/2010/programme/pips.html |date=2012-07-21 }} Retrieved 02-09-10&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[London School of Economics]] producing an event in collaboration with Big Ideas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/forumForEuropeanPhilosophy/events/PanelDiscussion.htm London School of Economics] Retrieved 02-09-10&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Puss in the corner''' is a [[children's game]] for five players.

==Description==
A yard, court, room, or other square area with four corners, posts, or trees [[equidistant]] from one another is chosen as the playing arena. One player is nominated "Puss" and takes his place in the center of the arena.  Each of the other four players selects one of the corners and takes their place there. Play begins with the four corner players attempting to exchange places with each other in any direction.  "Puss" attempts to gain a corner during the exchange. Should they succeed, the player left without a corner becomes "Puss" and takes their place in the center of the arena. Play resumes in a similar manner. Should players A and B attempt to exchange corners and A gains B's corner but A's corner is gained by "Puss", then B becomes "Puss" rather than A.

'''Ratcatcher's Day''', '''Rat-catcher's Day''' or '''Rat Catcher's Day''' is celebrated on 26 June or 22 July, commemorating the myth of the [[The Pied Piper of Hamelin|Pied Piper of Hamelin]].  The town of [[Hamelin]] in [[Germany]] uses the June date&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The legend of the Pied Piper |url=https://www.hameln.de/en/thepiedpiper/thepiedpiper/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the term "Pied Piper Day".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hameln.de/en/thepiedpiper/thepiedpipergoingunesco/pied-piper-day/&lt;/ref&gt;  The confusion of dates is because the [[Brothers Grimm]] cite 26 June 1284 as the date the Pied Piper led the children out of the town, while the poem by [[Robert Browning]] gives it as 22 July 1376.  It is a holiday remembering [[rat-catcher]]s, similar to [[Administrative Professionals' Day|Secretary's Day]] and Presidents Day.

Famous Ratcatcher's in literature include Serafina, the Chief Rat Catcher of the Biltmore Estate in Asheville, N.C. Serafina is a fictional character created by author Robert Beatty and was first introduced in "Serafina and the Black Cloak," a spooky, historical-fiction novel. Serafina's mysterious adventures grew into a trilogy (Book 2: Serafina and the Twisted Staff, Book 3: Serafina and the Splintered Heart) and the 4th book in the series is due for release in Summer 2019. https://robert-beatty.com

The '''Royal Game of Ur''', also known as the '''Game of Twenty Squares''' or simply the '''Game of Ur''', is a [[Two-player game|two-player]] [[Strategy game|strategy]] [[Race game|race]] [[board game]] that was first played in ancient [[Mesopotamia]] during the early third millennium BC. The game was popular across the Middle East among people of all social strata and boards for playing it have been found at locations as far away from Mesopotamia as [[Crete]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. At the height of its popularity, the game acquired spiritual significance, and events in the game were believed to reflect a player's future and convey messages from deities or other supernatural beings. The Game of Ur remained popular until [[late antiquity]], when it stopped being played, possibly evolving into, or being displaced by, an early form of [[backgammon]]. It was eventually forgotten everywhere except among the [[Cochin Jews|Jewish population]] of the Indian city of [[Kochi]], who continued playing a version of it until the 1950s when they began [[Aliyah|emigrating]] to [[Israel]].

The Game of Ur received its name because it was first rediscovered by the English archaeologist [[Leonard Woolley|Sir Leonard Woolley]] during his excavations of the [[Royal Cemetery at Ur]] between 1922 and 1934. Copies of the game have since been found by other archaeologists across the Middle East. The rules of the Game of Ur as it was played in the second century BC have been preserved on a Babylonian clay tablet written by the scribe Itti-Marduk-balālu. Based on this tablet and the shape of the {{boardgloss|gameboard}}, [[British Museum]] curator [[Irving Finkel]] has reconstructed the basic rules of how the game might have been played. The object of the game is to run the course of the board and bear all one's pieces off before one's opponent. Like modern backgammon, the game combines elements of both strategy and random chance.

==History==
[[File:bm-royalgame.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|A [[graffito (archaeology)|graffito]] version of the game from the palace of [[Sargon II]] (British Museum in London){{sfn|Collon|2011}}{{sfn|Green|2008}}]]

The Game of Ur was popular across the Middle East{{sfn|Bell|1979|page=25}}{{sfn|Green|2008}} and boards for it have been found in [[Iran]], [[Syria]], Egypt, [[Lebanon]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Cyprus]], and [[Crete]].{{sfn|Bell|1979|page=25}}{{sfn|Green|2008}} Four gameboards bearing a very close resemblance to the Royal Game of Ur were found in the funeral chamber of the [[KV62|Tomb of Tutankhamun]].{{sfn|Botermans|2008|page=712}} These boards came with small boxes to store dice and game pieces{{sfn|Botermans|2008|page=712}} and many had [[senet]] boards on the reverse sides so that the same board could be used to play either game and merely had to be flipped over.{{sfn|Botermans|2008|page=712}} The game was popular among all social classes.{{sfn|Green|2008}} A [[Graffito (archaeology)|graffito]] version of the game carved with a sharp object, possibly a dagger, was discovered on one of the [[Shedu|human-headed winged bull]] gate sentinels from the palace of [[Sargon II]] (721–705 BC) in the city of [[Khorsabad]].{{sfn|Collon|2011}}{{sfn|Green|2008}}

The Game of Ur eventually acquired superstitious significance{{sfn|Donovan|2017|pages=14–15}}{{sfn|Green|2008}} and the tablet of Itti-Marduk-balālu provides vague predictions for the players' futures if they land on certain spaces,{{sfn|Donovan|2017|page=14}}{{sfn|Green|2008}} such as "You will find a friend", "You will become powerful like a lion", or "You will draw fine beer".{{sfn|Donovan|2017|page=14}}{{sfn|Green|2008}} People saw relationships between a player's success in the game and his or her success in real life.{{sfn|Donovan|2017|pages=15–16}}{{sfn|Green|2008}} Seemingly random events such as landing on a certain square were interpreted as messages from deities, ghosts of deceased ancestors, or from a person's own soul.{{sfn|Donovan|2017|page=16}}

It is unclear what led to the Game of Ur's eventual decline during late antiquity.{{sfn|Donovan|2017|page=16}} One theory holds that it evolved into [[backgammon]];{{sfn|Donovan|2017|page=16}} whereas another holds that early forms of backgammon eclipsed the Game of Ur in popularity, causing players to eventually forget about the older game.{{sfn|Donovan|2017|page=16}}{{sfn|Green|2008}} At some point before the game fell out of popularity in the Middle East, it was apparently introduced to the Indian city of [[Kochi]] by a group of Jewish merchants.{{sfn|Donovan|2017|page=16}}{{sfn|Green|2008}} Members of the [[Cochin Jews|Jewish population of Kochi]] were still playing a recognizable form of the Game of Ur by the time they started [[Aliyah|emigrating]] to [[Israel]] in the 1950s after [[World War II]].{{sfn|Donovan|2017|page=16}}{{sfn|Green|2008}} The Kochi version of the game had twenty squares, just like the original Mesopotamian version,{{sfn|Green|2008}} but each player had twelve pieces rather than seven{{sfn|Green|2008}} and the placement of the twenty squares was slightly different.{{sfn|Green|2008}}

==Modern rediscovery==
The British archaeologist [[Leonard Woolley|Sir Leonard Woolley]] discovered five gameboards of the Game of Ur during his excavation of the [[Royal Cemetery at Ur]] between 1922 and 1934.{{sfn|Bell|1979|page=16}}{{sfn|Botermans|2008|page=712}}{{sfn|Donovan|2017|page=13}} Because the game was first discovered in the Royal Cemetery at Ur, it became known as the "Royal Game of Ur",{{sfn|Donovan|2017|page=13}} but later archaeologists uncovered other copies of the game from various other locations across the Middle East.{{sfn|Donovan|2017|page=13}} Each of the boards discovered by Wooley date to around 3000 BC.{{sfn|Bell|1979|page=16}}{{sfn|Botermans|2008|page=713}} All five boards were of an identical type,{{sfn|Bell|1979|page=16}}{{sfn|Botermans|2008|page=712}} but they were made of different materials and had different decorations.{{sfn|Bell|1979|page=16}}{{sfn|Botermans|2008|page=712}} Woolley reproduced images of two of these boards in his 1949 book, ''The First Phases''.{{sfn|Bell|1979|page=16}}{{sfn|Botermans|2008|page=712}} One of these is a relatively simple set with a background composed of discs of shell with blue or red centers set in wood-covered [[bitumen]].{{sfn|Bell|1979|page=16}}{{sfn|Botermans|2008|page=712}} The other is a more elaborate one completely covered with shell plaques, inlaid with red [[limestone]] and [[lapis lazuli]].{{sfn|Bell|1979|pages=16–17}}{{sfn|Botermans|2008|page=712}} Other gameboards are often engraved with images of animals.{{sfn|Bell|1979|page=17}}{{sfn|Botermans|2008|page=712}}{{sfn|Green|2008}}

===Reconstruction===
[[File:Royal Game of Ur rules.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Rules tablet|Rules tablet dated 177 BC (British Museum ref:{{British-Museum-db|33333,b|id=796973}})]]

When the Game of Ur was first discovered, no one knew how it was played.{{sfn|Finkel|2007|page=16}}{{sfn|Donovan|2017|page=14}}{{sfn|Botermans|2008|page=712}}{{sfn|Bell|1979|pages=16–19}} Then, in the early 1980s, [[Irving Finkel]], a curator at the [[British Museum]], translated a clay tablet written {{circa}} 177 BC by the Babylonian scribe Itti-Marduk-balālu describing how the game was played during that time period, based on an earlier description of the rules by another scribe named Iddin-Bēl.{{sfn|Finkel|2007|page=16}}{{sfn|Donovan|2017|page=14}} This tablet was written during the waning days of Babylonian civilization,{{sfn|Donovan|2017|page=14}} long after the time when the Game of Ur was first played.{{sfn|Botermans|2008|page=712}} It had been discovered in 1880 in the ruins of Babylon and sold to the British Museum.{{sfn|Finkel|2007|page=16}} Finkel also used photographs of another tablet describing the rules, which had been in the personal collection of Count Aymar de Liedekerke-Beaufort, but had been destroyed during [[World War I]].{{sfn|Finkel|2007|page=16}} This second tablet was undated, but is believed by archaeologists to have been written several centuries earlier than the tablet by Itti-Marduk-balālu and to have originated from the city of [[Uruk]].{{sfn|Finkel|2007|page=16}} The backs of both tablets show diagrams of the gameboard, clearly indicating which game they are describing.{{sfn|Finkel|2007|page=16}}{{sfn|Green|2008}} Based on these rules and the shape of the gameboard, Finkel was able to reconstruct how the game might have been played.{{sfn|Finkel|2007|page=16}}{{sfn|Donovan|2017|page=14}}{{sfn|Botermans|2008|page=712}}

The Game of Ur is a [[race game]]{{sfn|Finkel|2007|page=16}}{{sfn|Botermans|2008|page=712}}{{sfn|Donovan|2017|page=14}} and it is probably a direct ancestor of the [[Tables (board game)|tables]], or [[backgammon]], family of games, which are still played today.{{sfn|Botermans|2008|page=712}}{{sfn|Donovan|2017|pages=16, 35}} The Game of Ur is played using two sets of seven [[Draughts|checker]]-like game pieces.{{sfn|Botermans|2008|page=713}} One set of pieces are white with five black dots and the other set is black with five white dots.{{sfn|Botermans|2008|page=712}}{{sfn|Bell|1979|page=17}} The gameboard is composed of two rectangular sets of boxes, one containing three rows of four boxes each and the other containing three rows of two boxes each, joined together by a "narrow bridge" of two boxes.{{sfn|Becker|2007|pages=11–12}} The gameplay involves elements of both luck and strategy.{{sfn|Botermans|2008|page=713}} Movements are determined by rolling a set of [[Four-sided die|four-sided, pyramid-shaped dice]].{{sfn|Botermans|2008|page=713}}{{sfn|Bell|1979|page=17}} Two of the four corners of each die are marked and the other two are not, giving each die an equal chance of landing with a marked or unmarked corner facing up.{{sfn|Botermans|2008|page=712}}{{sfn|Bell|1979|page=17}} The number of marked ends facing upwards after a roll of the dice indicates how many spaces a player may move during that turn.{{sfn|Finkel|2007|pages=26–27}} A single game can last up to half an hour{{sfn|Botermans|2008|page=713}} and can be very intense.{{sfn|Botermans|2008|page=713}}

The object of the game is for a player to move all seven of his or her pieces along the course (''two proposed versions of which are shown at right'') and off the board before his or her opponent.{{sfn|Botermans|2008|page=718}} On all surviving gameboards, the two sides of the board are always identical with each other, indicating that the two sides of the board belong to each player.{{sfn|Bell|1979|page=17}} When a piece is on one of the player's own squares, it is safe from capture,{{sfn|Botermans|2008|page=716}} but, when it is on one of the eight squares in the middle of the board, the opponent's pieces may capture it by landing on the same space, sending the piece back off the board so that it must restart the course from the beginning.{{sfn|Botermans|2008|page=716}} This means there are six "safe" squares and eight "combat" squares.{{sfn|Botermans|2008|page=716}} There can never be more than one piece on a single square at any given time,{{sfn|Botermans|2008|pages=716, 720}} so having too many pieces on the board at once can impede a player's mobility.{{sfn|Botermans|2008|page=720}}

When a player rolls a number using the dice, he or she may choose to move any of his or her pieces on the board or add a new piece to the board if he or she still has pieces that have not entered the game.{{sfn|Botermans|2008|page=718}} A player is not required to capture a piece every time he or she has the opportunity.{{sfn|Botermans|2008|pages=716, 718}} Nonetheless, players are required to move a piece whenever possible, even if it results in an unfavorable outcome.{{sfn|Botermans|2008|page=718}} All surviving gameboards have a colored rosette in the middle of the center row.{{sfn|Bell|1979|page=17}}{{sfn|Finkel|2007|pages=26–27}}{{sfn|Becker|2007|pages=11–12}} According to Finkel's reconstruction, if a piece is located on the space with the rosette, it is safe from capture.{{sfn|Finkel|2007|pages=26–27}} In order to remove a piece from the board, a player must roll exactly the number of spaces remaining until the end of the course plus one.{{sfn|Botermans|2008|page=718}} If the player rolls a number any higher or lower than this number, he or she may not remove the piece from the board.{{sfn|Botermans|2008|page=718}}

===Gambling===
One archaeological dig uncovered twenty-one white balls alongside a set of the Game of Ur.{{sfn|Botermans|2008|page=713}} It is believed that these balls were probably used [[Gambling|for placing wagers]].{{sfn|Botermans|2008|page=713}} According to the tablet of Itti-Marduk-balālu, whenever a player skips one of the boxes marked with a rosette, he or she must place a token in the pot.{{sfn|Finkel|2007|pages=26–27}} If a player lands on a rosette, he or she may take a token from the pot.{{sfn|Finkel|2007|pages=26–27}}

'''''South Park''''' is a [[first-person shooter]] [[Adventure game|adventure]] [[video game]] based on the American animated comedy series [[South Park|of the same name]]. The game was developed by [[Iguana Entertainment]] and published by [[Acclaim Entertainment]] for the [[Nintendo 64]] in 1998 for North America and in 1999 for Europe. It was later ported to [[Microsoft Windows]] in 1999 and released in North America only. The [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] port was developed by [[Appaloosa Interactive]] in 1999. A [[Game Boy Color]] version was in development, but it was eventually canceled by creators [[Matt Stone]] and [[Trey Parker]], feelings the game would not fit in a console marketed towards children. However, they did keep a few copies of the Game Boy Color version to commemorate what was originally started as the first ''South Park'' game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.unseen64.net/2008/04/05/south-park-gbc-cancelled/| title= South Park [Unreleased] |accessdate= 2008-07-08|publisher=Unseen 64.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the Nintendo 64 version's positive reception, the PC and PlayStation versions of ''South Park'' were [[List of video games notable for negative reception|panned by critics]]. A [[Sega Dreamcast]] version was planned for a 2000 release, but was cancelled during development for unknown reasons. In 2018, a [[ROM image]] of the Game Boy Color version was leaked online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lostmediawiki.com/South_Park_%28found_GBC_game;_1998%29|title=South Park (found GBC game; 1998)|website=lostmediawiki.com|accessdate=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
''South Park'' is a [[first-person shooter]]. The game's single player mode places the player in control of one of the four main characters of South Park ([[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] or [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]]). The player must defeat a variety of enemies using the various weapons found throughout each stage in order to reach the exit point at the end.

In addition to completing levels, the player must also prevent large enemies in the stage (dubbed 'Tanks') from reaching the exit before they do. If they fail to do so, they will be forced to defend South Park from the 'Tanks' in a short minigame after the stage.

===Multiplayer===
In Head-to-Head mode, the players select a level, characters, and game style (time limited, damage limited, or unending). The [[Microsoft Windows]] version allows for online head-to-head play.

In the PlayStation and Nintendo 64 versions, upon reaching select stages in single player mode, codes are revealed.  These can then be input into the "Cheesy Poofs Decoder" to unlock additional characters for Head-to-Head play. All characters are unlocked in the Microsoft Windows version.

==Story==
A mysterious comet is approaching the earth, described by the opening narration as a force of concentrated evil that no force of good can stand against. As it comes closer, South Park is beset by enemies, including rabid mutant turkeys, deformed clones of the townsfolk, alien visitors, berserk robots, and sentient killer toys. Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny hear about the dangers from Chef, and take up arms to investigate their sources and defend the town.

''South Park''{{'}}s reception depended on the platform. Overall, the game was met with overwhelmingly negative critical reception with the PC and PlayStation versions, while the Nintendo 64 version generally received positive reviews from critics. The PlayStation and PC versions received poor reception due to the bad graphics, poor visuals and bad voice acting. The Nintendo 64 version received the best reviews upon release. Aggregating review website [[GameRankings]] gave the [[Nintendo 64]] version 67.11%,&lt;ref name="GRN64" /&gt; the PC version 51.72%&lt;ref name="GRPC" /&gt; and the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] version 41.22%.&lt;ref name="GRPS" /&gt;

[[GameSpot]] gave the PlayStation version a 1.4/10, stating that "''South Park'' is definitely one of those games that is bound to come up when you start thinking about the worst game you've ever played."&lt;ref name="GSpotPS" /&gt; [[IGN]] called the PlayStation version "frustrating" due to poor graphics, repetition of the voice acting, and lack of play value for the head-to-head mode.&lt;ref name="IGNPS" /&gt; GameSpot stated in the PC version that "A good license and good graphics aren't enough."&lt;ref name="GSpotPC" /&gt; The voice acting, done by the original voice actors, was criticized for being repetitive, isolated, and old.&lt;ref name="GSpotPC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IGNPS" /&gt; The weapons of the game were also criticized for being unprofessional.&lt;ref name="GSpotPS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IGNPS" /&gt;

Despite the negative reception from the Windows and PlayStation versions, the Nintendo 64 version was praised for its 3D graphics and storyline, with IGN calling the game "just as funny as the Comedy Central series."&lt;ref name="IGNN64" /&gt; GameSpot stated in the Nintendo 64 version that the level design was "really not very good on its own, but given the license, it at least makes sense."&lt;ref name="GSpotN64" /&gt;

==Sequel==
A spiritual sequel in the style of a sandbox action-adventure game was in development for the [[PlayStation 2]], [[Gamecube]] and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], but was not finished. Little was known about the game until a build was found on an Xbox development kit, but only video footage of the beta build has been released to the public. The footage appears to showcase the PlayStation 2 version, due to the visual button displays used in the game. A cutscene from the game was even leaked on YouTube showing Cartman in a mental hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2015/09/30/the-story-behind-the-lost-south-park-game/|title=The inside story of the long-lost South Park game|publisher=|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Spare Parts Puppet Theatre''' is located at 1–9 Short Street, [[Fremantle, Western Australia]], in [[Pioneer Park, Fremantle|Pioneer Park]], opposite the [[Fremantle railway station]].

==History==
The building was constructed as a commercial building in 1921.  It is a two storey [[limestone]] building with a [[corrugated iron]] roof, constructed in the [[Federation architecture#Styles|Federation Free Classical]] style of architecture.  The building was used as the [[State Shipping Service of Western Australia|State Shipping Service]] Office. In 1975 it was vested in the [[City of Fremantle]] and in September 1978 it was officially opened as the Fremantle Art Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| author1=Fremantle Art Gallery | title=Selection from the City of Fremantle collection, official opening exhibition, September 10 – October 9, 1978 | publication-date=1978 | publisher=The Gallery | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/9595343 | accessdate=28 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988 it was refurbished to specifically accommodate the Spare Parts Puppet Theatre.

==Heritage value==
The building is listed on the [[City of Fremantle]]'s Municipal Heritage List.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fremantle.wa.gov.au/files/8a085022-191f-4713-80ee-9f7a00b8119c/Heritage_Areas_LPS4_2011.pdf|format=pdf|title=City of Fremantle Heritage List|publisher=[[City of Fremantle]]|accessdate=28 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319121238/http://www.fremantle.wa.gov.au/files/8a085022-191f-4713-80ee-9f7a00b8119c/Heritage_Areas_LPS4_2011.pdf|archivedate=19 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The aim of the competition, as stated by C-SPAN, is to provide an opportunity for young people to voice their opinions on current events.&lt;ref name=Hodges&gt;{{cite news |title=C-SPAN lets area students have a voice |author=Michael H. Hodges |newspaper=The Detroit News  |date=24 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Middle and high school students can compete alone or in groups of up to three, entering a video documentary between 5 and 8 minutes in length, which presents more than one side to the selected topic and includes related C-SPAN programming.&lt;ref name=Porter/&gt; Each year a new theme related to current affairs is provided, and competitors must use this as the basis for their entry.&lt;ref name=Pick&gt;{{cite news |title=Behind the Lens: Local teen filmmakers tackle C-SPAN’s StudentCam Documentary Contest |author=Anne Pick |newspaper=The Source Weekly |date=13 January 2010|url=http://www.tsweekly.com/news/features/behind-the-lens-local-teen-filmmakers-tackle-c-spans-studentcam-documentary-contest.html |accessdate=11 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subjects have ranged from [[video game violence]] to [[illegal immigration]].&lt;ref name=Gavin/&gt;

==History==
The StudentCam competition developed from a documentary competition called CampaignCam, run by C-SPAN during the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential campaign]] as a way of including students' views about the election. The StudentCam forerunner won a Beacon Award in 2005, conferred by the cable industry for excellence in communications and public affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=2005 Beacon Awards: Education: Full Campaign/Single Activity; Cable Network III |author= |work=Multichannel News |date=9 May 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, StudentCam was launched by C-SPAN, adding a requirement that students include relevant C-SPAN programming.&lt;ref name=Porter/&gt; The 2009 competition received the most entries to date, when nearly 2,000 students&lt;ref name=Porter/&gt; from 41 states, the [[District of Columbia]] and [[Guam]]&lt;ref name=Hodges/&gt; submitted a total of 921 submissions.&lt;ref name=West&gt;{{cite news |title=C-SPAN surprises PMS students with award for StudentCam video entry |author=Emily West |newspaper=Pleasanton Weekly |date=20 March 2009 |url=http://www.pleasantonweekly.com/news/show_story.php?id=1535 |accessdate=12 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The grand prize winner of the competition, Sawyer Bowman, a 10th grade student from [[Davidson, North Carolina]] was congratulated by President [[Barack Obama]] via a specially-recorded video message.&lt;ref name=Hodges/&gt; A first-prize winner in the 2010 competition, Matthew Shimura, met [[First Lady]] [[Michelle Obama]] at the [[White House]] in April 2010 during a [[town hall meeting]] for her "Let's Move!" initiative, to talk about fighting childhood obesity, which was the subject of Matthew's video.&lt;ref name=Bryan&gt;{{cite web |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2010/04/michelle-obama-obesity.html |title=Michelle Obama explains how the First Family fights fat; Now, yours can, too |author=Andrew Malcolm |date=7 April 2010 |work=L.A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1032">'''Takenoko-zoku''' (竹の子族, lit. "[[bamboo]] shoot tribe") describes a type of dance group active from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s in [[Tokyo]], especially in [[Harajuku]]. The teenagers, mainly girls but often with one boy leading, were colorfully dressed and danced in a distinctive style on the sidewalk to music from stereos.&lt;ref name=Okubo&gt;{{cite web|last1=Okubo|first1=Miki|title=Harajuku – District for Anti-fashion|url=http://fashion.semiotix.org/2014/02/harajuku-district-for-anti-fashion/|website=SemiotiX – Design, Style and Fashion|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To an extent, they were precursors to the [[gyaru]] groups that would eventually arise in the 90s.&lt;ref name=Okubo/&gt;

A performance of a takenoko-zoku group can be seen in [[Chris Marker]]'s film ''[[Sans Soleil]]''.

==Cast and characters==
===Main cast===
* [[AnnaSophia Robb]] as [[Carrie Bradshaw]]; The protagonist and voice-over narrator of the series. She is a 16-year-old high school student living in the fictional town of Castlebury, [[Connecticut]], who dreams of being a famous writer. Carrie's mother recently died from cancer and as a result, Carrie's younger sister, Dorrit, is more rebellious than ever, and their father, Tom, is overwhelmed with the responsibility of suddenly having to care for two teenage girls on his own. Instead of attending school on one day during the week, Carrie takes an internship at a law firm in New York City which she relishes as a stepping stone in her quest to leave her small town behind her. She left this position to work for Larissa Loughlin at ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'' magazine. Towards the end of high school, Larissa offers Carrie a full-time job at the magazine, which she accepts over going to NYU. Unfortunately, when Larissa is fired, so is Carrie. She decides to stay in New York, rather than going to Malibu with Sebastian. In the Season 2 finale, she moves into Larissa's apartment with Samantha.
* [[Austin Butler]] as Sebastian Kydd; The new kid at Castlebury High School and Carrie's love interest. Sebastian moves to Castlebury after getting kicked out of his old high school for having sex with his art history teacher. He lives with his divorced mother who is never around. He and Carrie date during the second half of the first season, before breaking up (after a fight resulting in Sebastian kissing Maggie, Carrie's best friend). They are constantly going back and forth from a couple to singles and back, which is much more known as an on and off relationship, but it is clear that they both have feelings for each other. At the end of Season 2, Sebastian moves to Malibu to run his company, and it seems that he and Carrie may have broken up.
*[[Ellen Wong]] as Jill "Mouse" Chen; Jill is Carrie's nerdy and sweet best friend from high school and the ex-girlfriend of a college guy she still loves, and lost her virginity to. They broke up because both of their grades were getting low, because they were only focusing on eachother. In school, she is an academic overachiever who is said to be under pressure and driven to be the best at everything by her stern parents. Mouse accepts an offer to go to Harvard towards the end of Season 2.
*[[Katie Findlay]] as Maggie Landers; Carrie's best friend, and Walt's sexually active ex-girlfriend. She is a sarcastic and self-assured underachieving student who barely passes her classes and is said to have an unhappy home life where her parents neglect and ignore her, who are not able to pay for her college life. She cares about Carrie, and will sacrifice her own happiness for Carrie's. Maggie is proposed to by Pete in the last episode of Season 2, and she accepts.
* [[Stefania LaVie Owen]] as Dorrit Bradshaw; Carrie's troubled, 14-year-old, rebellious younger sister. She openly resents Carrie for being close with their mother, and for not having more time with her. She is rebelling by dyeing her hair and wearing too much eye make-up as well as seeing a guy older that Carrie called Miller.
* [[Brendan Dooling]] as Walter "Walt" Reynolds; Carrie's other best friend. He is Maggie's ex-boyfriend. He doesn't know that she is cheating on him with a cop. In the ending of the first episode, it's implied that Walt is [[Closeted|secretly gay]]. In later episodes it is clear he is confused about his sexuality, he even sparks an interest in a man named Bennet Wilcox (an employee at Interview Magazine). At the end of the first season he and Maggie break up, and she (as well as the rest of the group) finds out about his homosexuality. In season 2 he begins dating Bennett and his mom sees a picture of them in a local newspaper and kicks him out. He lives at Carrie's for 3 episodes before being scared off by the potential to get AIDS, breaking up with Bennett and moving back in with his parents, denying his sexuality again. By the end of Season 2, his parents finally accept Walt's homosexuality.
* [[Chloe Bridges]] as Donna LaDonna; The school's most popular girl, and the [[Queen bee (sociology)|leader]] of a [[clique]]s called "[[Adolescent cliques|The Jens]]", which is made up of all of the school's shallow and narcissistic "mean girls". She was Carrie's chief rival in the first season and also had a crush on Walt. When she found out that Walt was gay, she protected his secret by telling the whole school that they had sex, and pretending that they were dating for real. She is currently frenemies with Carrie.
* [[Freema Agyeman]] as Larissa Loughlin; A hip, British, cutting-edge style editor at ''Interview'' magazine and party girl, who acts as Carrie's mentor in New York City, while she is working at the law firm. It is later revealed that Larissa is an African princess who ran away from her family and found financial support from a British lord before moving to America. Carrie introduces Larissa to Harlan, her father Tom's friend, and Larissa and Harlan get married in the Season 2 finale.
* [[Matt Letscher]] as Tom Bradshaw; Carrie's overprotective father. He loosens up a bit as the series progresses. When Carrie chooses a job at Interview over going to NYU, Tom disapproves and cuts her off financially. In the Season 2 finale, Tom and Carrie mend their relationship when she tells him that she will stay in New York and support herself.
* Lindsey Gort as [[Samantha Jones (Sex and the City)|Samantha Jones]]; Donna's brash and outgoing older cousin whom Carrie befriends. She is part of Manhattan's music scene, where she used to work at a bar as a bouncer. Samantha and Carrie move in together at the end of Season 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2013/08/carrie-diaries-season-2-scoop-how-will-carrie-bradshaw-meet-samantha-jones.html|title='Carrie Diaries' Season 2 scoop: How will Carrie Bradshaw meet Samantha Jones?|last=Bucksbaum|first=Sydney|work=Zap2It|date=August 15, 2013|accessdate=February 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="samantha"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/441002/the-carrie-diaries-casts-samantha-jones-for-season-2|title=''The Carrie Diaries'' Casts Samantha Jones For Season 2|last=Bricker|first=Tierney|work=E!

==Plot==

Two sorcerers, Finn and Shernomore, have an intense magical duel in favor of saving Finn's wife, Meena. Finn gains the upperhand at first, but is defeated by Shernomore who deceives him by stepping on a "force field", and losing all of his powers and youthfullness, which then transfers to Shernomore and transforms Meena into a stone statue in exchange for her power of love as a source of his magic.

In the present day, Ruslan, a wandering artist dreaming to become a knight, is having a small play which he plays the role of Finn and Shernomore, and is written by an eccentric and an aspiring playwright, Lester. In the castle lived a adventurous and kind princess named Meelah. She considers the castle as a hindrance for his father and the King, is forcing her to get married despite she doesn't love whoever he suggests. One night, she sneaks out and she was almost harrased by two men, until Ruslan arrives. He saves Meelah from the two and escape. When the two are alone, Ruslan, afraid of being  judged by his status, disguises himself as a knight.

The next day, they share romantic moments as they develop their feelings for each other. Unfortunately, much to Ruslan's surprise and horror, Meelah was kidnapped via a tornado by Shernomore, He tries to pursue Meelah, but fails to do so and knocks himself unconscious. When he gained consciousness, he is confronted by the King, who mistakenly accuses him of harming the princess. He tries to tell the truth, but none of them belived him. Realizing Shernomore is real, he consults Lester and they set off to the cave where a wise cat lives. 

The two asks for help on where to find Meelah and reveals to them a magic vortex where they discover a magical place and gives them a pea pod as a "gift". When they reached the cliff, a hamster suddenly steals the pod and they pursue it. But they realized that they are supposed to give it to him and unlocks a dinosaur-like bridge.

Meanwhile, at Shernomore's castle, Meelah awakens at a bed and she tries to escape using a hat that makes the user invisible. Despite Shernomore casting a spell that makes all of the desserts there alive, she manages to defeat these and discovers the other ladies who are victims of Shernomore's evil sorcery.

When the two arrive at the cave, they meet a strange old man who holds a staff similar to a wizard, and asks help on where to find Finn. However, the old man reveals himself to be Finn. But due to him having no contact on the outside world for too long, he is too paranoid to communicate with. With the help of Ruslan's plan, they pretend to be "wizards" who are casting a "spell" to lure him down. Finn, beliving that his powers are restored, tries to stop them. Ruslan and the gang pretend to be dead, only for them to contain Finn. When they got him, Ruslan asks where to find Shernomore and how to stop him, Finn tells them that his castle is made of spiky rocks and the source of his power is in his beard, asking him to cut it off, but no one was able to do that. And he tells Ruslan that he needs a magic sword in order to do that. After asking for the directions on where to find the sword, they locate and it is guarded by a giant knight. The giant challenges Ruslan in exchange for the armor and sword, but Ruslan manages to defeat all of them and they went to Shernomore's castle. 

When they got to the castle, they splitted to find Meelah. Ruslan finds Meelah in a different outfit and appearance and tells him that she does not need to rescue her, for she is happy at this place. This breaks Ruslan's heart. Feeling down, he slowly leaves the place. Suddenly, a giant monster attacks them.  Lester tries to convince Ruslan to fight, but he's too lonely to do so. The bird gets Meelah's pendant and makes Ruslan realize that he is being deceived by Shernomore and gains courage to fight the monster. 

After defeating the monster, they went to the place where Meelah is kept and  he and Shernomore engages at a n intense duel. Ruslan is defeated at first, but manages to incapacitate Shernomore by cutting his beard, losing his powers and transforms the stone staues and Finn back to normal. Ruslan tries to escape with Meelah, but they are trapped in the force field the same way as Finn did before. Ruslan sacrifices himself by pushing Meelah out of the trap, leaving him incapacitated. Meelah tries to pull Ruslan out, but is interrupted by the three nights, resulting in Ruslan's soul being zapped from him and leaving him lifeless. Enraged, Meelah fights the three knights and defeats them all (including Shernomore who is tied up). 

Meelah mourns for the apparent death of Ruslan and says that she loves him so much. A now-rejuvenated Finn appears and brings back Ruslan to life. The two reunite including Lester and Finn and Meena reunites as well. Ruslan confesses that he is not a real knight, but Meelah accepts this, and tells she still loves him no matter what. Finn conjures up a fireworks display, and they lived happily ever after.

During the credits, Ruslan and Meelah shows being married and living a happy life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://stolenprincess.com/en/story|title=History|work=The Stolen Princess|accessdate=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Budget==

The film is co-financed by Ukrainian State Film Agency: its share is 19.5 million UAH (total production cost of the film is 95.2 million UAH).

==Production==

On January 30, 2013 producer Egor Olesov informed about the development of [[Ruslan and Lyudmila]] project based on a [[fairy tale]] poem with the same title by Aleksandr Pushkin. In September 2013, press service of FILM.UA Group announced the start of film production, and later the protagonists and synopsis for [[Ruslan and Lyudmila]] were presented with the film itself announced as 2D animation; later, however, the concept changed, and a decision was made to create a 3D animated film.  

Hollywood consultants helped with developing the characters. According to the authors of the film, [[Ruslan and Lyudmila]] was made in English and then dubbed in Ukrainian. As Olesov says, Hollywood celebrities will be involved in English dubbing, and in [[Ukraine]], popular local actors will lend their voices to the film. For the international market, the film was given another title, ''The Stolen Princess''.

In December 2015, the script and characters’ stories were finalized; animation of approved scenes was completed.

It was also announced that sales to some other territories were pending.&lt;ref name="hollywoodreporter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/afm-stolen-princess-sells-china-954618|title=AFM: Ukranian Animated Film 'The Stolen Princess' Sells to China|author=Nick Holdsworth|publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 13–16, 2017 in Hong Kong, FILMART took place, which is an annual film and TV content market.

On the penultimate day of the market, the scenes from the animated film were screened in Asia for the first time; the invitation to the premiere appeared on the cover of The Hollywood Reporter, and the screening itself was successful and gathered positive feedback from market participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stolenprincess.com/en/news/text/20-in-asia-the-first-screening-of-the-stolen-princess-takes-place|title=In Asia, The First Screening of The Stolen Princess Takes Place|accessdate=2017-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early April, Cannes hosted MIPTV (Marché International des Programmes de Télévision), a major European market of audiovisual content.

Immediately after Ukrainian release, the theatrical release took place in [[Romania]] (March 16) and Turkey (March 23). During the first Romanian weekend, Ukrainian animated feature film collected $165,066 in the box office&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stolenprincess.com/en/news/text/54-in-the-first-weekend-of-international-release-the-stolen-princess-collects-an-impressive-box-office-in-romania|title=In the First Weekend of International Release, The Stolen Princess Collects an Impressive Box Office in Romania|publisher=The official site of the film "The Stolen Princess"|accessdate=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and placed second after American blockbuster [[Lara Croft]]: [[Tomb Raider]] (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer). It is interesting to compare the film with the main animated releases of 2017–2018 from Hollywood majors such as [[Disney Pixar]], [[DreamWorks Animation]], and [[Blue Sky Studios]], which also took place in Romania: the box office of Ukrainian Princess during the first weekend exceeded those of [[Coco (2017 film)|Coco]], [[Ferdinand the Bull]], and Baby Boss, ceding only to the third movie of Cars franchise. The premiere box office of the Ukrainian film places it third among animated releases in Turkey in 2018.

As of April 13, ''The Stolen Princess'' is now shown in the cinemas of [[Ukraine]], [[Romania]], [[Turkey]], [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Egypt]], [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Kuwait]], [[Lebanon]], [[Jordan]], [[Qatar]], [[Oman]] and [[Bahrain]]. In total, the rights to the animated film screening have been sold to more than 50 countries, including France, Germany, countries of the Middle East, Southern Africa, Asia, and Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stolenprincess.com/en/news/text/65-ukradena-princeza-and-otkradnatata-printsesa-ukrainian-cartoon-just-released-in-croatia-bosnia-and-hertzegovina-and-bulgaria|title="Ukradena princeza" and "Откраднатата принцеса": Ukrainian animated feature film just released in Croatia, Bosnia and Hertzegovina, and Bulgaria|publisher=The official site of the film "The Stolen Princess"|accessdate=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2018 Ukrainian media reported that the film had been shown in more than 40 countries with more than half a million viewers.&lt;ref name="234385princess"/&gt; In January 2019 the film will become the first Ukrainian film to be commercially released to cinemas in China.&lt;ref name="234385princess"&gt;{{uk icon}} [https://life.pravda.com.ua/culture/2018/11/29/234385/ "The kidnapped princess" will become the first Ukrainian film to be shown in cinemas of China], [[Ukrayinska Pravda|''Life'']] (29 November 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Transporter''''' (French: '''''Le Transporteur''''') is an English-language French [[action film]] franchise, comprising four films released between 2002 and 2015, and a television series. [[Jason Statham]] plays Frank Martin in the first three movies, a professional freelance courier driver for hire. Statham himself is an accomplished [[martial artist]], allowing him to do all the combat scenes involving Frank Martin himself. This permits the films' signature Hong Kong-style fight scenes, choreographed by [[Corey Yuen]]. 
[[Chris Vance (actor)|Chris Vance]] portrays Frank Martin in the [[Transporter: The Series|television series]] and [[Ed Skrein]] portrays Frank Martin in the [[The Transporter Refueled|fourth film]], a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]].

===''The Transporter''===
{{Main|The Transporter}}
Frank Martin ([[Jason Statham]]) is a highly skilled driver known only as "The Transporter." He will transport anything, no questions asked, always on time, and he is known as the best in the business. He strictly follows three rules when transporting: Rule Number 1: "Once the deal is made, it is final", Rule Number 2: "No names", and Rule Number 3: "Never open the package." Frank inadvertently breaks his own rule, opens the package and finds a bound and gagged woman.

===''Transporter 2''===
{{Main|Transporter 2}}
Frank is working as the driver/chauffeur for a wealthy family, in the United States. Martin bonds with their young son, whom he drives to school every day. When the boy is kidnapped, Frank must again take action in order to protect his young "package" and his family. Eventually, Martin unravels a scheme involving biological weapons and the nefarious Gianni Chellini. Martin is forced to remove a bomb from the bottom of his car by executing an aerial corkscrew manoeuver underneath a crane. The crane catches the bomb and Martin escapes unharmed. Frank debuts the [[Audi A8 W12]] in this film.

Inspector Tarconi plays an even more prominent role in this film. It is established that he and Frank are now friends, and Tarconi goes as far as to lie to the police to cover for Frank. His cooking prowess is established as well.

===''Transporter 3''===
{{Main|Transporter 3}}
Frank has been pressured into transporting Valentina ([[Natalya Rudakova]]) the kidnapped daughter of Leonid Vasilev ([[Jeroen Krabbé]]), the head of the Environmental Protection Agency for Ukraine, from [[Marseille]] through [[Stuttgart]] and [[Budapest]] until he ends up in [[Odessa]] on the [[Black Sea]]. Along the way, with the help of Inspector Tarconi ([[François Berléand]]), Frank has to contend with the people who strong armed him to take the job, agents sent by Vasilev to intercept him, and the general non-cooperation of his passenger, who he realises is the package mid-way through the film. Despite Valentina's cynical disposition and Frank's resistance to get involved, Frank and Valentina fall for each other, while escaping from one life-threatening situation after another. Martin again drives an armoured [[Audi A8 W12]] in the film, as well as a [[BMX]] bicycle.

===''The Transporter Refueled''===
{{main|The Transporter Refueled}}

==Frank Martin==
{{Main
| Frank Martin (Transporter)
}}
'''Frank Martin''' is the [[protagonist]] of the films and television series. He initially serves as a [[reluctant hero]]. He is portrayed as a former [[Special Forces]] operative who was a team leader of a search and destroy unit. His military background includes operations "in and out of" [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]] and [[Sudan]]. He retires from this after becoming fatigued and disenchanted with his superior officers. In simple terms, he got tired of seeing his best efforts turned to nothing by the same people paying him to do the job. So he puts his skills to action as a private driver for hire.

The {{nihongo|'''Ueno Zoo'''|恩賜上野動物園|Onshi Ueno Dōbutsuen}} is a {{Convert|14.3|ha|sing=on}} [[zoo]], managed by the [[Tokyo Metropolitan Government]], and located in [[Taitō, Tokyo]], [[Japan]]. It is Japan's oldest zoo, opening on March 20, 1882. It is a five-minute walk from the Park Exit of [[Ueno Station]], with convenient access from Tokyo's public-transportation network. The [[Ueno Zoo Monorail]], the first [[monorail]] in the country, connects the eastern and western parts of the grounds.

The zoo is in [[Ueno Park]], a large [[urban park]] that is home to museums, a small amusement park, and other attractions. The zoo is closed Mondays (Tuesday if Monday is a holiday).

== History ==
The zoo started life as a menagerie attached to the National Museum of Natural History. In 1881, responsibility for this menagerie was handed to naturalist and civil servant [[Tanaka Yoshio]], who oversaw its transition into a public zoo.&lt;ref name="Itoh2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mayumi Itoh|title=Japanese Wartime Zoo Policy: The Silent Victims of World War II|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_arGAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA16|date=15 November 2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-11744-0|pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ground was originally estate of the imperial family, but was {{Nihongo|[[:wikt:bestowal|bestow]]ed|恩賜|onshi|forming the first part of the name in Japanese, untranslated officially}} to the municipal government in 1924 — along with [[Ueno Park]] — on the occasion of crown prince [[Hirohito]]'s wedding.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1= Kawata |first1=Ken| editor1-last=Kisling | editor1-first=Vernon N. | year=2001 | title=Zoo and Aquarium History: Ancient Animal Collections to Zoological Gardens  | publisher=CRC Press | isbn=978-0-8493-2100-9  | chapter =Zoos of Japan | page=298 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World War II ===
In August 1943, the administrator of Tokyo, [[Shigeo Ōdachi]], ordered that all "wild and dangerous animals" at the zoo be killed, claiming that bombs could hit the zoo and escaping wild animals would wreak havoc in the streets of Tokyo. Requests by the staff at the zoo for a reprieve, or to evacuate the animals elsewhere, were refused.  The animals were executed primarily by poisoning, strangulation or by simply placing the animals on starvation diets.  A memorial service was held for the animals in September 1943 (while two of the elephants were still starving) and a permanent memorial (built anew in 1975) can be found in the Ueno Zoo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://japanfocus.org/-Frederick_S_-Litten/3225 Starving the Elephants - The Slaughter of Animals in Wartime Tokyo's Ueno Zoo]&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the March 1945 bombings of Tokyo, the Japanese placed U.S. Army Air Force navigator and bombardier Ray "Hap" Halloran on display naked in a Ueno Zoo tiger cage so civilians could walk in front of the cage and view the B-29 prisoner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20080430w1.html War trauma leads to efforts to reconcile | The Japan Times Online] Article dated Wednesday, April 30, 2008 (Retrieved on June 28, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haphalloran.com/autobiography.asp The Autobiography of Raymond "Hap" Halloran]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recent renovations ===
The zoo provides animals an environment similar to the natural habitat.  In recent years, the old-fashioned cages of the past have been replaced with modern habitats, such as the "Gorilla Woods," built after two well-publicized mishaps in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aapn.org/japanesegorillas.html The Controversy over the Value of Zoo Animals Two Stories about Gorillas in a Japanese Zoo and What They Mean]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Animal population ==
[[File:Seals ueno.jpg|thumb|California sea lions sleeping]]
[[File:Llama at ueno.jpg|thumb|Llama]]
The zoo is home to more than 3,000 individuals representing over 400 species.&lt;ref name="zoo_main"/&gt;  The [[Sumatran tiger]], and [[western lowland gorilla]] head the list of the zoo's population. Ueno has more species on exhibition than any other zoo in Japan.

The zoo is also home to [[zebra]]s,  [[Japanese macaque]]s,  [[red-crowned crane]]s, [[white-tailed eagle]]s and [[king penguin]]s, along with [[goat]]s, [[sheep]], [[pig]]s, [[llama]]s, [[ostrich]]es, and [[rabbit]]s.

At some point, redistribution of the animals among Tokyo's other zoos (including [[Tama Zoo]] and [[Inokashira Nature Park]]) left Ueno without a lion. However, in response to public demand, Ueno borrowed a female from the Yokohama Municipal Zoo. {{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

=== Principal animals ===

[[File:Giant Panda in Ueno Zoo.JPG|thumb|Giant panda at Ueno Zoo]]
After the death of [[Giant panda]] [[Ling Ling (giant panda)|Ling Ling]] in 2008, Ueno Zoo was without a member of this species for the first time since 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20080501a3.html Giant panda Ling Ling dies at Ueno Zoo], Kyodo News, [[Japan Times]], 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Two new giant pandas arrived from the Chinese [[Wolong Nature Reserve]] in February 2011. The male panda, Billy (比力 ビーリー) was renamed in Ueno to Līlī  (力力 リーリー) to emphasize his playful vitality. The female's name Siennyu (仙女 シィエンニュ ‘Fairy’) was changed to Shinshin (真真 シンシン), referring to purity (純真) and innocence (天真).&lt;ref&gt;{{ja icon}} [http://www.ueno-panda.jp/press The Ueno Pandas' Profiles], Ueno Zoo, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}} [[Foreign relations of Japan|PRC Embassy in Japan]], [http://big5.fmprc.gov.cn/gate/big5/jp.china-embassy.org/chn/zrdt/t801184.htm 大熊貓"比力、仙女"抵東京] (Giant Pandas Bili &amp; Xiannü Arrived at Tokyo)&lt;/ref&gt; The new names were based on a public poll.

[[File:Zambita.jpg|right|thumb| An Argentine couple dancing Zamba in the streets of [[Buenos Aires]] as a show for tourists.]]
'''Zamba''' is a traditional dance of [[Argentina]]. It is a style of [[Music of Argentina|Argentine music]] and Argentine folk dance. Zamba is very different from its [[homophone]], the [[samba]] - musically, rhythmically, temperamentally, in the steps of the dance and in its costume. It has six beats to the bar and is a majestic dance, performed by couples who circle each other waving white [[handkerchief]]s very elegantly. It has common elements with the [[cueca]].

Zambas are composed about every genre, from those that celebrate people or events of [[History of Argentina|Argentine history]], to those that describe the beauty of a region, or of its women. There are zambas of political protest, and even one called ''[[Aerolíneas Argentinas]]''. The ''[[bombo legüero]]'' drum is prominent in the playing of the zamba.

==Name and Origin==
The name "zamba" refers to a colonial term for [[zambo]] (people that are descendants of [[Amerindian]] and [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African people]]). It is therefore called zamba because its lyrical content was aimed at its native listeners.

The dance originated in the Argentine province of Salta in the Creole genre known as the zamacueca  of [[Peru]], in 1824 at the same time that [[Peru]], under [[José de San Martín]], obtained independence. It came to Argentina through "Alto Peru," a region that is modern day [[Bolivia]] and through Chile between 1825 and 1830.&lt;ref&gt;La primera descripcion coreográfica completa documentada de la zamacueca se encuentra en "Mefistófeles" año 1 Nº22 "Aires Nacionales" del folclorólogo Arturo Berrutti, publicado en Buenos Aires el 29 de julio de 1882; {{cite book

| publisher = Vilco SRL
| isbn = 987-43-4537-3
| language = Spanish
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The Zamba is a slow dance in three-quarter time played primarily on guitar and [[bombo legüero]]. The steps of the dance are a walking step, an alternate step (two steps at one time), and a tip toe alternate step or "sobrepaso punteado" (three steps at one time). The Zamba also requires a handkerchief.

==Today==
Today Zamba is frequently danced in the streets of [[Argentina]] and always danced in [[Argentine]] folklore parties and festivals.It is performed during the national holidays of [[Argentina]].

'''''Zeebo Extreme''''' is a series of 3D racing videogames created for the [[Zeebo]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tecnologia.uol.com.br/ultnot/2009/02/27/ult530u6705.jhtm  | title=Tectoy Digital libera vídeo de "Zeebo Extreme"; assista |publisher=UOL Technologia }}&lt;/ref&gt; The games were developed by the [[Tec Toy|Tectoy Digital]] studio in [[Campinas]], [[Brazil]]. To date, five Zeebo Extreme games have been introduced in Brazil and four in Mexico. 

Each of the games involves a race over air, water or land in a particular type of vehicle, such as an airplane, [[Gravity racer|billy cart]] or jet board. In single player mode, the player competes against the game. In two-player mode, players race against each other. The games offer a variety of courses, levels of difficulty and [[power-up]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.zeebo.com.br/games.aspx  |title=Zeebo Brazil Games  |deadurl=yes  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091217135804/http://www.zeebo.com.br/games.aspx  |archivedate=2009-12-17  |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The games use either the standard Zeebo ''Z-Pad'' gamepad or the Boomerang control, a motion-sensitive controller similar to the [[Wii Remote]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zeebo.com.br/console.aspx#boomerang {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918102156/http://www.zeebo.com.br/console.aspx |date=2009-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
