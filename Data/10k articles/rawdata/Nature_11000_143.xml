The '''Adamastor Ocean''' was a "proto-Atlantic" ocean that opened with the break-up of the [[Rodinia]] supercontinent 780-750&amp;nbsp;Ma. It separated the [[R√≠o de la Plata Craton]] from the [[Congo Craton]].  The inversion of the Adamastor Ocean began 640&amp;nbsp;Ma with the development of a large [[back-arc basin]] along the western margin of the [[Kalahari Craton]], and the ocean closed when R√≠o de la Plata collided with Kalahari about 545&amp;nbsp;Ma along the sinistral [[Sierra Ballena Shear Zone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rapela|Pankhurst|Casquet|Fanning|2007|loc=7.6 Tectonic Model, p. 76}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[S√£o Francisco plate]] and the R√≠o de la Plata plate amalgamated 630‚Äì620&amp;nbsp;Ma, closing the Adamastor Ocean on the South American side and forming the [[Mantiqueira Mountains]] around 600&amp;nbsp;Ma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brito Neves|Campos Neto|Fuck|1999|loc=Mantiqueira branched systems of orogens, pp. 161‚Äì162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was named after the mythical giant [[Adamastor]] in [[Vasco da Gama]]'s writings.

'''{{lang|ae|Ameretat}}''' [[Help:IPA/English|/…ôÀàm…ôr…ôt…ôt/]] (Avestan: ''ê¨Äê¨®ê¨Üê¨≠ê¨Üê¨ôê¨Åê¨ô‚Äé {{lang|ae|Am…ôr…ôtƒÅt}}'') is the [[Avestan language]] name of the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] divinity/divine concept of [[immortality]].  Ameretat is the [[Amesha Spenta]] of long life on earth and perpetuality in the hereafter. 

The word ''{{lang|ae|am…ôr…ôtƒÅt}}'' is grammatically feminine and the divinity Ameretat is a female entity. Etymologically, Avestan ''{{lang|ae|am…ôr…ôtƒÅt}}'' derives from an [[Proto-Indo-Iranian language|Indo-Iranian]] root and is linguistically related to [[Vedic Sanskrit]] ''[[amrita|am·πõtatva]]''.
In [[Sassanid Era]] Zoroastrian tradition, Ameretat appears as [[Middle Persian]] ê≠†ê≠¨ê≠•ê≠´ê≠£ê≠†ê≠£ ''Amurdad'', continuing in [[Persian language|New Persian]] as ŸÖÿ±ÿØÿßÿØ ''Mordad'' or ''Amordad''. 

==In scripture==
===In the Gathas===
Like the other [[Amesha Spenta]]s also, Ameretat is already attested in the [[Gathas]], the oldest texts of the Zoroastrianism and considered to have been composed by [[Zoroaster]] himself. And like most other principles, Ameretat is not unambiguously an entity in those hymns. Unlike four of the other Amesha Spentas, Ameretat does not have a standing epithet that in later Avesta texts becomes an element of her proper name.

Already in the Gathas, Ameretat is closely allied with [[Haurvatat]], the Amesha Spenta of "Wholeness" and health. Addressing [[Ahura Mazda]] in ''[[Yasna]]'' 34.11, the prophet [[Zoroaster]] exclaims that "both Wholeness and Immortality are for sustenance" in the Kingdom of God. In the same verse, as also in ''Yasna'' 45.10 and 51.7, parallels are drawn between Ameretat and Haurvatat on the one hand and "endurance and strength" on the other.

===In the Younger Avesta===
The relationship between Ameretat and Haurvatat is carried forward into the Younger Avesta (''[[Yasna]]'' 1.2; 3.1; 4.1; 6.17; 7.26; 8.1 etc.; ''[[Yasht]]'' 1.15; 10.92). The Younger Avestan texts allude to their respective guardianships of plant life and water (comparable with the Gathic allusion to sustenence), but these identifications are only properly developed in later tradition (see below). These associations with also reflect the Zoroastrian cosmological model in which each of the Amesha Spentas is identified with one aspect of creation.

The antithetical counterpart of Ameretat is the demon (''[[daeva]]'') ''Shud'' "hunger", while Haurvatat's counterpart is ''Tarshna'' "thirst". Ameretat and Haurvatat are the only two Amesha Spentas who are not already assigned an antithetical counterpart in the Gathas. In the eschatological framework of ''Yasht'' 1.25, Ameretat and Haurvatat represent the reward of the righteous after death (''cf.'' [[Ashi]] and ''[[ashavan]]'').

==In tradition==
&lt;!-- and into the texts of Zoroastrian tradition where Ameretat is characterized as the guardian of plant life and Haurvatat is the guardian of water. --&gt;
In the ''[[Bundahishn]]'', a Zoroastrian account of creation completed in the 12th century, Ameretat and Haurvatat appear‚Äîtogether with [[Armaiti|Spenta Armaiti]] (MP: ''Spendarmad''), the third female Amesha Spenta‚Äîon the left hand of Ahura Mazda (''Bundahishn'' 26.8). Throughout Zoroastrian scripture and tradition, these three principles are most consistently identified with the creations that they represent: respectively plant life, water, and earth. 

According to the cosmological legends of the ''Bundahishn'', when [[Angra Mainyu]] (MP: Ahriman) withered the primordial plant, Ameretat crushed it to pulp and mixed it with water. [[Tishtrya]] then took the water and spread it over the world as rain, which in turn caused a multitude of other plants to grow up.

In the calendrical dedication of ''Siroza'' 1.7, Ameretat is invoked on the seventh day of each month together with the ''Gaokarena'' (the "White [[Haoma]]"). This Younger Avestan allusion to immortality is properly developed in ''Bundahishn'' 27.2&lt;!--/XVI.4--&gt;, where White Haoma is considered to be the "death-dispelling chief of plants." From this White Hom, the ambrosia of immortality will be prepared at the final renovation of the world (''Bd.'' 19.13; 30.25). Other chapters have the nectar being created from Ameretat herself (e.g. ''Bd.'' 26.113).

According to the [[Denkard|''Denkard's'']] recollection of lost Avestan texts, Zoroaster's ''tan-gohr'', his material self, was under the protection of Ameretat and Haurvatat up until the prophet's conception. The divinities caused the rains to nourish the grass, which six white cows then ate. Upon drinking the milk from those cows, Zoroaster's mother absorbed his ''tan-gohr''. (''Denkard'' 7.2.19&amp;nbsp;''ff)''

Through the association with plants and water, Ameretat and Haurvatat are consequently identified with food and drink (''cf.'' sustenance in the Gathas, above), and traditionally it was out of respect for these two Amesha Spentas that meals were to be taken in silence. In ''[[Book of Arda Viraf|Book of Arda Viraz]]'' 23.6-8, the righteous Viraz sees a man punished in hell "for consuming Hordad and Amurdad while unlawfully chattering while he chewed."

In the hierarchy of [[yazata|''yazata''s]], Ameretat has [[Rashnu]], [[Arshtat]], and [[Zam]] as assistants or cooperators (''hamkars''). Rashnu and Arshtat both have roles in [[Zoroastrian eschatology]] while Zam is the divinity of the earth and nourisher of plants. 

In the day-name and month-name dedications of the [[Zoroastrian calendar]], the seventh day of the month and fifth month of the year are named after Ameretat/''Amurdad''/''Mordad'' and are under her protection. The [[Iranian calendar|Iranian civil calendar]] of 1925 follows Zoroastrian month-naming conventions and hence also has ''Mordad'' as the fifth month of the year.

==In other religions==
Haurvatat-Ameretat ([[Pahlavi script|Pahlavi]] ''hrwd ºd'' '' ºmwrd ºd'') appears in [[Sogdian language]] texts&lt;!-- Manichean? Buddhist? --&gt; as ''hrwwt mrwwt''. A relationship to [[Armenian language|Armenian]] ''hawrot'' ''mawrot'' has been suggested but is not confirmed. According to Islam tradition, Al-Quran mentions two entities sent to Babil (Babylon) named Harut and Marut, to test people faith because they teach witchcraft and sorcery. These entities stated that they were sent to test the faith of the people before teaching them.

{{Antimatter}}
{{Weapons of mass destruction}}
An '''antimatter weapon''' is a possible device according to theories using [[antimatter]] as a power source, a [[propellant]], or an explosive for a [[weapon]]. Antimatter weapons cannot yet be produced due to the current cost of production of antimatter (estimated at 63 trillion [[united states dollar|dollars]] per gram) given the extremely limited technology available to create it in sufficient masses to be viable in a weapon, and the fact that it annihilates upon touching ordinary matter, making containment very difficult.

The paramount advantage of such a theoretical weapon is that antimatter and matter collisions result in the entire sum of their [[mass energy equivalence|mass energy equivalent]] being released as energy, which is at least an order of magnitude greater than the energy release of the most efficient [[Thermonuclear weapon|fusion weapons]] (100% vs 7-10%). [[Annihilation]] requires and converts exactly equal masses of antimatter and matter by the collision which releases the entire mass-energy of both, which for 1 gram is ~1.8√ó10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; joules. Using the convention that 1 kiloton [[TNT equivalent]] = 4.184√ó10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; joules, one gram of antimatter reacting with one gram of ordinary matter results in 42.96 kilotons-equivalent of energy (though there is considerable "loss" by production of [[neutrinos]]).

== Acquiring and storing antimatter ==
Antimatter production and containment are currently impenetrable barriers (due to current technological limitations) to the creation of antimatter weapons. Quantities measured in grams will be required to achieve a destructive effect comparable with conventional nuclear weapons.

Currently, the few known physics reactions for producing antimatter involve [[particle accelerators]] or [[particle bombardment]], but are both currently highly inefficient and prohibitively expensive. The global production rate per year is only 1 to 10 nanograms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.engr.psu.edu/antimatter/papers/nasa_anti.pdf |title=Antimatter Production for Near-term Propulsion Applications |quote=The cost of producing large quantities of antimatter (i.e., gram-scale or above) with current facilities is exceedingly high. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070306065325/http://www.engr.psu.edu/antimatter/Papers/NASA_anti.pdf |archivedate=2007-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the annual production of [[antiproton]]s at the Antiproton Decelerator facility of CERN was several picograms at a cost of US$20 million. Thus, at the current level of production, an equivalent of a 10&amp;nbsp;[[TNT equivalent|Mt]] [[hydrogen bomb]], about 250&amp;nbsp;grams of antimatter will take 2.5 billion years of the energy production of the entire Earth to produce.&lt;ref name=CERN&gt;{{cite web |url=http://public.web.cern.ch/public/en/spotlight/SpotlightAandD-en.html |title=Angels and Demons |work=[[CERN]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105085146/http://public.web.cern.ch/public/en/spotlight/SpotlightAandD-en.html |archivedate=2012-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;   A milligram of antimatter will take 100,000 times the annual production rate to produce (or 100,000 years).&lt;ref&gt;[http://athena-positrons.web.cern.ch/ATHENA-positrons/wwwathena/FAQ.html Antimatter FAQ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110321161343/http://athena-positrons.web.cern.ch/ATHENA-positrons/wwwathena/FAQ.html |date=2011-03-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an equivalent of the [[Little Boy|Hiroshima atomic bomb]] would take half a gram of antimatter, but would take CERN two million years to produce at the current production rate.&lt;ref name=CERN /&gt;

Since the first creation of artificial antiprotons in 1955, production rates increased nearly geometrically until the mid-1980s; A significant advancement was made recently as a single [[antihydrogen]] atom was produced suspended in a magnetic field. Physical laws such as the small cross-section of antiproton production in high-energy nuclear collisions make it exceedingly difficult to improve the production efficiency of antimatter given current technology.

== Recent advances &amp; physics obstacles ==
Research conducted in 2008 dramatically increased the quantity of [[positron]]s (antielectrons) that can be produced. Physicists at the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] in California used a short, ultra-intense laser to irradiate a millimetre-thick gold target which produced more than 100 billion positrons.&lt;ref&gt;

Even if it were possible to convert energy directly into particle/antiparticle pairs without any loss, a large-scale [[power plant]] generating 2000&amp;nbsp;[[MWe]] would take 25 hours to produce just one gram of antimatter. Given the average price of electric power of around US$50 per megawatt hour, this puts a lower limit on the cost of antimatter at $2.5 [[1000000 (number)|million]] per gram.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.gov|title=U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)|author=|date=|website=www.eia.gov|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180128120254/https://www.eia.gov/|archivedate=28 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They suggest that this would make antimatter very cost-effective as a rocket fuel, as just one milligram would be enough to send a probe to [[Pluto]] and back in a year, a mission that would be completely unaffordable with conventional fuels. By way of comparison, the cost of the [[Manhattan Project]] (to produce the first atomic bomb) is estimated at US$23 billion in 2007 prices.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctbto.org/nuclear-testing/history-of-nuclear-testing/manhattan-project|title=Manhattan Project|accessdate=17 January 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141228200033/http://www.ctbto.org/nuclear-testing/history-of-nuclear-testing/manhattan-project|archivedate=28 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most scientists, however, doubt whether such efficiencies could ever be achieved.

The second problem is the containment of antimatter. Antimatter annihilates with regular matter on contact, so it would be necessary to prevent contact, for example by producing antimatter in the form of solid charged or magnetized particles, and suspending them using [[electromagnetic fields]] in a near-perfect vacuum. The obvious solution of confining a charged object inside a similarly charged container is not feasible as the electric field inside is uniform.  For this reason it is necessary to have charged objects moving relative to the container which can be confined to a central region by magnetic fields; for example, in the form of a toroid or Penning trap (see below).  

In order to achieve compactness given macroscopic weight, the overall electric charge of the antimatter weapon core would have to be very small compared to the number of particles. For example, it is not feasible to construct a weapon using positrons alone, due to their mutual repulsion. The antimatter weapon core would have to consist primarily of neutral antiparticles. Extremely small amounts of [[antihydrogen]] have been produced in laboratories, but containing them (by cooling them to temperatures of several [[kelvin|millikelvins]] and trapping them in a [[Penning trap]]) is extremely difficult. And even if these proposed experiments were successful, they would only trap several antihydrogen atoms for research purposes, far too few for weapons or spacecraft propulsion. Heavier antimatter atoms have yet to be produced.

The difficulty of preventing accidental detonation of an antimatter weapon may be contrasted with that of a nuclear weapon. Whereas nuclear weapons are '[[fail-safe]]', antimatter weapons are inherently '[[fail-deadly]]': In an antimatter weapon, any failure of containment would immediately result in annihilation, which would damage or destroy the containment system and lead to the release of all of the antimatter material, causing the weapon to detonate entirely at full yield. By contrast, a modern nuclear weapon will explode with a significant yield if (and only if) the [[Nuclear weapon design|nuclear trigger]] is fired with absolute precision resulting in a neutron source wholly releasing promptly (&lt; microseconds). In short, an antimatter weapon must be actively kept from detonating; whereas a nuclear weapon will not unless deliberately made to do so.

==Cost==
{{As of|2004}}, the cost of producing one millionth of a gram of antimatter was estimated at US$60 billion.&lt;ref name="sfgate.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/science/article/Air-Force-pursuing-antimatter-weapons-Program-2689674.php|title=Air Force pursuing antimatter weapons / Program was touted publicly, then came official gag order|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|accessdate=17 January 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141229183617/http://www.sfgate.com/science/article/Air-Force-pursuing-antimatter-weapons-Program-2689674.php|archivedate=29 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smaller weapons are more economically feasible: A modern MK3 [[hand grenade]] contains 227&amp;nbsp;g of [[TNT]].&lt;ref&gt;Dockery, Kevin (2004). ''Weapons of the Navy SEALs''. New York: Berkley Publishing Group. p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; One billionth of a gram of positrons contains as much energy as 37.8 kilograms (83 pounds) of TNT,&lt;ref name="sfgate.com"/&gt; making the 2004 cost of "positron hand grenade" (10 trillionth of a gram of antimatter, 378&amp;nbsp;g TNT equivalent) that could be fitted in a [[sniper|sniper's]] bullet US$600,000. This excludes the cost of the micro containment device if such a thing is possible.{{original research?|date=March 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6693">'''Aquadag''' is a trade name for a water-based [[colloidal]] [[graphite]] coating commonly used in [[cathode ray tube]]s (CRTs).  It is manufactured by [[Acheson Industries]], a subsidiary of [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]]. The name is a shortened form of "Aqueous Deflocculated Acheson Graphite", but has become a generic term for conductive graphite coatings used in vacuum tubes. Other related products include Oildag, Electrodag and Molydag. The product names are often printed with DAG in upper case (e.g. AquaDAG).  It is used as an electrically conductive coating on insulating surfaces, and as a lubricant.

==Properties==

Aquadag consists of a dispersion of colloidal graphite in distilled water.&lt;ref name="Agar"&gt;{{cite web

It can be applied by brushing, swabbing, spraying, or dipping, after which the surface is dried, leaving a layer of pure graphite.

After drying the coating is electrically conductive.  Its resistance and other electrical properties vary with degree of dilution and application method.  When diluted 1:1 and applied by brush its resistance is:
:Air-dried                ~800 [[ohms per square]]
:Heated to 200 ¬∞C         ~500 ohms per square
:Heated to 300 ¬∞C         ~20‚Äì30 ohms per square

==Use in cathode ray tubes==
A conductive aquadag coating applied to the inside of the glass envelope of [[cathode ray tube]]s, serves as a high-voltage electrode.  The coating covers the inside walls of the "bell" of the CRT tube, from just inside the neck, and stops just short of the screen.  Due to the graphite, it is electrically conductive and forms part of the high-voltage positive [[electrode]], the second [[anode]], which accelerates the electron beam.&lt;ref name="Bali"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The second anode is a metal cylinder inside the neck of the tube, connected to a high positive voltage of 18 to 25&amp;nbsp;kilovolts.  It has spring clips, which press against the walls of the tube, making contact with the aquadag coating so it also carries this high positive voltage.  The [[electron beam]] from the [[electron gun]] in the neck of the tube is accelerated by the high voltage on the anode and passes through it to strike the screen.

The aquadag coating has two functions: it maintains a uniform electric field inside the tube near the screen, so the electron beam remains collimated and is not distorted by external fields, and it collects the electrons after they have hit the screen, serving as the return path for the cathode current.&lt;ref name="Avison"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   When the electron beam hits the screen, in addition to causing the [[fluorescent]] [[phosphor]] coating to give off light, it also knocks other electrons out of the surface.  These ''[[secondary electrons]]'' are attracted to the high positive voltage of the coating and return through it to the anode power supply.  Without the coating a negative space charge would develop near the screen, deflecting the electron beam.  A typical value of beam current collected by the anode coating is 0.6 mA.&lt;ref name="Gulati" /&gt;

In some CRTs the aquadag coating performs a third function, as a [[filter capacitor]] for the high-voltage anode supply.&lt;ref name="Bali" /&gt;  A second conductive coating is applied to part of the outside of the tube facing the inside coating.  This outside coating is connected to the ground side of the anode supply, thus the full anode voltage is applied between the coatings.   The sandwich of the two coatings separated by the [[dielectric]] glass wall of the tube form a final [[capacitor]] to filter out ripple from the anode supply.  Although the capacitance is small, around 500&amp;nbsp;pF,&lt;ref name="Bali" /&gt; due to the low anode current it is sufficient to act as a filter capacitor.

In the television tube manufacturing industry, the manufacturing step that applies the aquadag is called "dagging".

==Other uses==
Aside from its use in the production of CRTs, Aquadag is used in many types of high-voltage lab apparatus where a conductive coating is needed on an insulating surface.  The surfaces of some metals (most notably aluminum) can develop nonconductive oxide layers, which tend to disrupt the electrostatic field produced around the surface of the metal when used as an electrode.  Aquadag is not subject to such effects and provides a completely uniform equipotential surface for electrostatics.

==Other dags==
There are also deflocculated graphite products dispersed in liquids other than water. Acheson has extended the use of the dag [[brandname]] to non-graphite products e.g. the copper-based Electrodag 437 conductive paint.

In [[Gallo-Roman religion]], '''Arduinna''' (also Arduina, Arduinnae or Arduinne) was the eponymous tutelary goddess of the [[Ardennes]] Forest and region, thought to be represented as a huntress riding a [[boar]] (primarily in the present-day regions of [[Belgium]] and [[Luxembourg]]). Her cult originated in the Ardennes region of present-day Belgium, Luxembourg, and France. She was [[Interpretatio graeca#Interpretatio romana|identified with]] the [[Roman mythology|Roman]] goddess [[Diana (goddess)|Diana]].&lt;ref&gt;Some of Diana's attributes have then been reflected to Arduina: "In Celtic mythology Arduina is the goddess of woodlands, wild life, the hunt and the moon." (Ramesh Chopra, ed. (2005) ''Academic Dictionary Of Mythology'', ''s.v.'' "Arduina").&lt;/ref&gt;

==Depictions==
In ''The Gods of the Celts'', Miranda Green states that some depictions of Arduinna show her riding a [[boar]].&lt;ref&gt;Green, ''Gods of the Celts'', 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;180; the connection is also made in popularized guidebooks such as B.G. Walker (1991), ''Woman's Dictionary of Symbol and Sacred Objects'' (San Francisco: Harper) and J.C. Cooper (1992) ''Symbolic and Mythological Animals'' (London).&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Simone Deyts&lt;ref&gt;Deyts, Simone (1992) ''Images des Dieux de la Gaule'' (Images of the Gods of Gaul). Paris: Editions Errance. {{ISBN|2-87772-067-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; notes that the bronze Gallo-Roman statue of a woman in a short belted tunic, riding a boar [[sidesaddle]] and holding a knife, conserved in the [[National Archaeological Museum (France)|Mus√©e des antiquit√©s nationales]], [[St-Germain-en-Laye]],&lt;ref&gt;The bronze is illustrated in Boucher, S. (1976) ''Recherches sur les Bronzes Figur√©s de Gaule Pr√©-romaine et Romaine'' (Research on the Bronze Figures of Gaul, Pre-Roman and Roman). Paris, Ecole Fran√ßais de Rome, fig. 292, or [http://www.bridgemanart.com/search?filter_text=Arduinna&amp;x=29&amp;y=16 Bridgeman archives: Arduinna])&lt;/ref&gt; bears no inscription, and was simply assumed to be Arduinna by the 19th century [[antiquarian]] who discovered it‚Äîperhaps because the modern symbol of the Ardennes region is also a boar.&lt;ref&gt;Deyts 1992, pp.&amp;nbsp;46‚Äì47.&lt;/ref&gt; Another such bronze, from the collection of [[Richard Payne Knight]], has been in the [[British Museum]] since 1824; it is traditionally identified as "Diana".&lt;ref&gt;British Museum, [https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=423686&amp;partid=1&amp;searchText=boar&amp;fromADBC=ad&amp;toADBC=ad&amp;numpages=10&amp;images=on&amp;orig=%2Fresearch%2Fsearch_the_collection_database.aspx&amp;currentPage=21 illustration and description.]&lt;/ref&gt; Both bronze statuettes are now headless.

==Inscriptions==
Arduinna is directly attested from two inscriptions:

* [[D√ºren (district)|D√ºren]], Germany: ''deae Ardbinnae'' ({{CIL|13|07848}}; the object in question is an altar)
* Rome, Italy: ''Arduinne'' ({{CIL|6|00046}}; this is an inscribed relief, on which the name ''Arduinne'' has also been read as ''Saturno'')

==Etymology==

The name Arduinna derives from the [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]] ''arduo-'' meaning height.&lt;ref&gt;Delamarre, Xavier &amp; Lambert, P. Y. (2003). ''Dictionnaire de la Langue Gauloise'' (Dictionary of the Gaulish Language). 2nd edition. Paris, Editions Errance. {{ISBN|2-87772-237-6}}, p.&amp;nbsp;51).&lt;/ref&gt; It is also found in several placenames, such as the Ardennes Woods (''Arduenna silva'') and the [[Arden, Warwickshire|Forest of Arden]] in England, in personal names ''Arduunus'' and ''Arda'' ‚Äî the latter from coinage of the [[Treveri]]&lt;ref&gt;''RIG''-4, 36-43&lt;/ref&gt; ‚Äî and the Galatian ''ŒëœÅŒ¥ŒÆ''. The name ''Arduenna silva'' for "wooded heights" was applied to several forested mountains, not just the modern Ardennes: it is found in the d√©partements of [[Haute-Loire]] and [[Puy-de-D√¥me]] and in the French commune of [[Alleuze]].&lt;ref&gt;Delamarre (2003), pp.&amp;nbsp;51‚Äì52.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been suggested that the [[gemination]] ''-nn-'' is typical to a language of the [[Belgae]],&lt;ref&gt;e.g. M.Gysseling, De Vroegste geschiedenis van het Nederlands: een taalkundige benadering in ''Naamkunde'' '''2''', 1970, p157-180&lt;/ref&gt; being different from Celtic and thus suggesting a ''[[Nordwestblock]]'' etymology, which, generally speaking, is also assumed to be closer to [[Germanic languages|Germanic]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==Historical references==
In 585, [[:fr:Walfroy le Stylite|St. Walfroy]] (Wulfilaich) preached to the local population of [[Villers-devant-Orval]] in the Ardennes to persuade them to abandon the worship of Diana. On the hill near [[Margut]], there was, according to [[Gregory of Tours]], a large stone statue of Diana where people would worship. Worshippers would also sing chants in Diana's honour as they drank and feasted. After some difficulties, Walfroy and his followers succeeded in pulling down the statue, which they demolished with hammers.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory of Tours, ''[[Gregory_of_Tours#History_of_the_Franks|History]] VIII''.15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The [[Asteroid belt|Main belt]] [[asteroid]] [[394 Arduina]], discovered on 19 November 1894, is named for Arduinna.

In [[Church architecture|Christian architecture]] the '''baptistery''' or '''baptistry''' ([[Old French]] ''baptisterie''; [[Latin]] ''baptisterium''; [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|Œ≤Œ±œÄœÑŒπœÉœÑŒÆœÅŒπŒøŒΩ}}, 'bathing-place, baptistery', from {{lang|grc|Œ≤Œ±œÄœÑŒØŒ∂ŒµŒπŒΩ}}, bapt√≠zein, 'to baptize') is the separate centrally planned structure surrounding the [[baptismal font]]. The baptistery may be incorporated within the body of a church or [[cathedral]], and provided with an altar as a chapel. In the early [[early Christianity|Church]], the [[catechumen]]s were instructed and the [[sacrament]] of [[baptism]] was administered in the baptistery.

==Design==
[[File:Rom, San Giovanni in Laterano, Baptisterium, Au√üenansicht 2.jpg|thumb|The [[Lateran Baptistery]], Rome, 440]]
{{further information|Mathematics and architecture}}
The sacramental importance and sometimes architectural splendor of the baptistery reflect the historical importance of [[baptism]] to Christians. The octagonal plan of the [[Lateran Baptistery]], the first structure expressly built as a baptistery, provided a widely followed model. The baptistery might be twelve-sided, or even circular as at [[Pisa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | publisher=Pontificio Istituto di Archeologia Cristiana| isbn=9788885991422

In a [[narthex]] or [[Antechamber|anteroom]], the catechumens were instructed and made their [[Creed|confession of faith]] before baptism. The main interior space centered upon the [[baptismal font]] (''piscina''), in which those to be baptized were thrice immersed. Three steps led down to the floor of the font, and over it might be suspended a gold or silver dove. The iconography of [[fresco]]s or [[mosaic]]s on the walls were commonly of the scenes in the life of [[Saint John the Baptist]]. The font was at first always of stone, but latterly metals were often used.

The Lateran baptistery's font was fed by a natural spring. When the site had been the palatial dwelling of the Laterani, before Constantine presented it to Bishop Miltiades, the spring formed the water source for the numerous occupants of the ''domus.'' As the requirements for Christian baptisteries expanded, [[Christianised sites|Christianization of sacred pagan springs]] presented natural opportunities. [[Cassiodorus]], in a letter written in AD 527, described a fair held at a former pagan shrine of [[Leucothea]], in the still culturally Greek region of south Italy. This shrine had been Christianized by converting it to a baptistery (''Variae'' 8.33). There are also examples of the transition from miraculous springs to baptisteries from [[Gregory of Tours]] (died ''c.'' 594) and [[Maximus of Turin|Maximus, bishop of Turin]] (died ''c.'' 466).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1353/earl.2001.0037 | issn=1086-3184 | volume=9 | issue=3 | pages=387‚Äì402 | last=Barnish | first=S.J.B. | title=Religio in stagno: Divinity, and the Christianization of the Countryside in Late Antique Italy

==History==
[[File:Basilica of St. John in Ephesus 06.jpg|thumb|Baptistery in the [[Basilica of St. John]] in [[Ephesus]], Turkey]]

Baptisteries belong to a period of the church when great numbers of adult catechumens were baptized and [[immersion baptism|immersion]] was the rule. They did not seem to be common before the emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius made [[Christianity]] the [[state religion]] in&lt;ref&gt;[[Edict of Thessalonica]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2017}} the [[Edict of Thessalonica]] (i.e. before the 4th century). As early as the 6th century, the baptismal font was commonly built in the [[porch]] of the church, before it was moved into the church itself. After the 9th century, with infant baptism increasingly the rule, few baptisteries were built. Some of the older baptisteries were so large that there are accounts of councils and [[synod]]s being held in them. They had to be large because a bishop in the early church would customarily baptize all the catechumens in his [[diocese]] and the rite was performed only three times a year, on certain holy days. Baptisteries were thus attached to the [[cathedral]] and not to the [[parish]] churches.

During the months when no baptisms occurred, the baptistery doors were sealed with the [[bishop]]'s [[Seal (device)|seal]], a method of controlling the orthodoxy of all baptism in the diocese. Some baptisteries were divided into two parts to separate the sexes;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Augusti|first1=|last2=Coleman|first2=Lyman|title=The Antiquities of the Christian Church. Translated and compiled from the works of Augusti with numerous additions from Rheinwald, Siegel and others, by Rev. Lyman Coleman. Mainly an abridgement of Augusti's "Handbuch der christlichen Arch√§ologie."|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GXVjAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA86|year=1842|publisher=T. Ward &amp; Company|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; or sometimes the church had two baptisteries, one for each sex. A [[fireplace]] was often provided to warm the neophytes after immersion.

Though baptisteries were forbidden to be used as [[burial]]-places by the [[Council of Auxerre]] (578), they were sometimes used as such. The Florentine [[Antipope John XXIII]] was buried in the [[Battistero di San Giovanni (Florence)|Baptistery]], facing [[Santa Maria del Fiore|Florence's Duomo]], with great ceremony. A tomb was erected here. Many of the early [[Archbishop of Canterbury|archbishops of Canterbury]] in England were buried in the baptistery at Canterbury.

According to the records of early church councils, baptisteries were first built and used to correct what were considered the evils arising from the practice of private baptism. As soon as Christianity had expanded so that baptism became the rule, and as immersion of adults gave place to sprinkling of infants, the ancient baptisteries were no longer necessary. They are still in general use, however, in Florence and Pisa.

The baptistery of the [[Lateran]] must be the earliest ecclesiastical building still in use. (''Main article: [[Lateran Baptistery]].'') A large part of it remains as built by [[Constantine]]. The central area, with the basin of the font, is an octagon around which stand eight [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]] columns, with [[marble]] capitals and [[entablature]] of classical form. Outside these are an [[ambulatory]] and outer walls forming a larger octagon. Attached to one side, toward the Lateran basilica, is a porch with two noble porphyry columns and richly carved capitals, bases and entablatures. 

The circular church of [[Santa Costanza]], also of the 4th century, served as a baptistery and contained the tomb of the daughter of Constantine. This is a remarkably perfect structure with a central dome, columns, and mosaics of classical fashion. Two side niches contain the earliest known mosaics of distinctively Christian subjects. In one is represented [[Moses]] receiving the Old Law, in the other [[Christ]] delivers to [[Saint Peter]] the New Law charter, sealed with the XP monogram.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|last=Lethaby|first=W.

The earliest surviving structure that was used as a baptistery is the tomb-like baptistery at [[Dura-Europas]].&lt;ref&gt; [http://divinity.library.vanderbilt.edu/burns/3262/dura2.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Another baptistery of the earliest times has been excavated at [[Aquileia]].

One was built in the mid-5th century, and the other in the 6th. A large baptistery decorated with mosaics was built in the 6th century at [[Naples]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

In the East the metropolitan baptistery at Constantinople still stands at the side of the former patriarchal [[Church of Holy Wisdom]]. Many others, in [[Syria]] for example, were found in late 19th and early 20th-centry archeological research, as were some belonging to churches of [[North Africa]]. In [[France]] the most famous early baptistery is [[Baptist√®re Saint-Jean]] at [[Poitiers]]. Other  early examples exist at [[Riez]], [[Fr√©jus]] and [[Aix-en-Provence]]. In [[England]], a detached baptistery is known to have been associated with [[Canterbury Cathedral]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

'''Bloody Bones''' is a [[bogeyman]] figure feared by children and is sometimes called '''Rawhead''', '''Tommy Rawhead''', or '''Rawhead-and-Bloody-Bones'''.

==Origins==
The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] cites approximately 1548 as the earliest written appearance of "Blooddybone".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bloody Bones, n.|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/20450|website=OED Online (Oxford English Dictionary Third Edition, March 2012)|publisher=Oxford University Press, March 2015|accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "Raw-Head and Bloody-Bones, and such other Names" was used "to awe children, and keep them in subjection", as recorded by [[John Locke]] in 1693.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, John. ''Some Thoughts Concerning Education'' (1902 ed.). Cambridge University Press. p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Samuel Johnson]] in his ''[[Dictionary of the English Language]]'' (first published in 1755) defined "Rawhead" as "the name of a spectre, mentioned to fright children".&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Samuel. ''Dictionary of the English Language''. (Vol. 2, 1777 ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;  The stories originated in [[Great Britain]] where they were particularly common in [[Lancashire]] and [[Yorkshire]],&lt;ref name=Wright&gt;Wright, Elizabeth Mary (1913). ''Rustic Speech and Folk-Lore''. Humphrey Milford, Oxford University Press. p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Briggs&gt;Briggs, Katharine (1976). ''An Encyclopedia of Fairies''. Pantheon Books. pp. 338-339. {{ISBN|0394409183}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and spread to [[North America]] where the stories were common in the [[Southern United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederic Gomes Cassidy]] and Joan Houston Hall (1985). ''[[Dictionary of American Regional English]]''. Harvard University Press. p. 486.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Folklore==
Bloody Bones is sometimes regarded as a water demon haunting deep ponds and old [[marl]] pits (which often became filled with water to form ponds) where it dragged children into the depths, much like the [[Grindylow]] and [[Jenny Greenteeth]]. Children were told to "keep away from the marl-pit or rawhead and bloody bones will have you." &lt;ref name=Wright/&gt;&lt;ref name=Briggs/&gt;

Ruth Tongue said in ''Somerset Folklore'' that he "lived in a dark cupboard, usually under the stairs.  If you were heroic enough to peep through a crack you would get a glimpse of the dreadful, crouching creature, with blood running down his face, seated waiting on a pile of raw bones that had belonged to children who told lies or said bad words. If you peeped through the keyhole he got you anyway." &lt;ref&gt;As quoted in Briggs, Katharine (1967). ''The Fairies in Tradition and Literature''. Routledge. p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Old Bloody Bones''' is a [[Cornwall|Cornish]] version of Rawhead-and-Bloody-Bones according to F. W. Jones in ''Old Cornwall''. Old Bloody Bones inhabited Knockers Hole near the village of [[Baldhu]]. There was said to have been a massacre in the area, and it is suggested that he was a [[ghost]] or evil spirit attracted by the carnage.&lt;ref&gt;As retold in Briggs, Katharine (1976). ''An Encyclopedia of Fairies''. Pantheon Books. p. 316. {{ISBN|0394409183}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Southern United States, Rawhead and Bloody Bones are sometimes regarded as two individual creatures or two separate parts of the same monster. One is a skull stripped of skin that bites its victims (Rawhead) and its companion is a dancing headless skeleton (Bloody Bones). In one [[cautionary tale]] a gossip loses his head to the monster as punishment for his wicked tongue. Legends about Bloody Bones eventually made their way into [[African-American]] tradition as well as spreading to other parts of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://deepsouthmag.com/2014/10/17/bloody-bones-a-history-of-southern-scares/ "Bloody Bones: A History of Southern Scares"] ''Deep South Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2018}}
In the opening of "An Evening's Entertainment" (published 1925), English ghost story writer [[M R James|M. R. James]] mourns the loss of unrecorded folklore tales, citing "Rawhead and Bloody Bones" as an example of such a case where the name survives but the tale behind the name is lost. ''"We hear, indeed, of sheeted spectres with saucer eyes, and ‚Äî still more intriguing ‚Äî of 'Rawhead and Bloody Bones' (an expression which the Oxford Dictionary traces back to 1550), but the context of these striking images eludes us. Here, then, is a problem which has long obsessed me; but I see no means of solving it finally. The aged grandams are gone, and the collectors of folk-lore began their work in England too late to save most of the actual stories which the grandams told. Yet such things do not easily die quite out..."''

In the novel ''Cold Days'', in [[The Dresden Files]] series, a Rawhead is a creature native to the Never-Never.  It appears as a large, skinless creature with a gaping many-jawed mouth. Its form is made from the discarded remains of pigs and cows, the bodies of children, and grown adults if it gets large enough to consume them.

The short story "Rawhead Rex" was first published in [[Clive Barker]]'s ''[[Books of Blood]]'' Vol. III. In the story Rawhead is accidentally awakened by the townsfolk of the rural town of Zeal, [[Kent]]. He goes on a murderous rampage killing and eating townspeople, including numerous children, and the Vicar of the town. He is a giant nine-foot-tall humanoid creature with a giant, sharp-toothed head. It is finally defeated by a talisman depicting a pregnant woman, the antithesis of the monster and the only thing it fears. The story was later turned into the movie ''[[Rawhead Rex (film)|Rawhead Rex]]'' (1986) which Barker has disowned, although he is the credited screenwriter.

In the television series ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'' (Season 1, Episode 12 "Faith"), [[Dean Winchester|Dean]] and [[Sam Winchester|Sam]] rescue two children hiding in a cupboard in the basement of a house. Sam leaves with the children just before Dean is attacked by the Rawhead and thrown to the ground. Despite the fact that they are both in a puddle of water, Dean uses his taser to electrocute the Rawhead, killing it and severely injuring himself.

[[Siouxsie and the Banshees]] recorded a song called "Rawhead and Bloodybones" on their album ''[[Peepshow (album)|Peepshow]]'', which starts out, "Bad words or bad deeds/unpunished invite grief."

Rawhead and Bloody Bones appear in a [[Hellboy]] and the B.P.R.D. story in England.

"Bloody bones gon' get you" is repeated as the outro in Yelawolf's 2017 song 'Shadows' (ft Josh Hadley, on the Trial By Fire album); sung by Nashville-based gospel quartet, the McCrary Sisters.

In [[Laurell K. Hamilton]]'s 1996 novel, [[Bloody Bones (novel)|Bloody Bones]], Magnus Bouvier explains to [[Anita Blake]] how his family captured and imprisoned Rawhead-and-Bloody-Bones in order to feed off of its magical blood and increase their own power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bloody Bones|last=Hamilton|first=Laurell K.|publisher=Ace Books|year=1996|isbn=0-441-00374-5|location=United States|pages=370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Susanna Clarke]]'s 2004 novel, [[Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell|Johnathan Strange and Mr Norrell]], the [[Gentleman with the Thistledown Hair]] refers to "raw head and bloody bones" as one of a number of shapes he might have to take in the event of magical combat, implying that this is a form which the Faeries take to achieve certain ends, rather than a distinct sort of creature from Faerie beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Johnathan Strange and Mr Norrell|last=Clarke|first=Susanna|publisher=Bloomsbury|year=2004|isbn=0-7475-7988-1|location=London|pages=948}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Blue Hill Meteorological Observatory''', also known as '''Great Blue Hill Weather Observatory''', '''Blue Hill Weather Observatory''', or simply the '''Blue Hill Observatory''', in [[Milton, Massachusetts]] is the foremost structure associated with the history of weather observations in the United States. Located atop [[Great Blue Hill]] at the junction of Interstate 93 and Route 138 about &lt;span style="white-space:nowrap"&gt;10&amp;nbsp;miles&amp;nbsp;(16&amp;nbsp;km)&lt;/span&gt; south of [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], it is home to the oldest continuous weather record in [[North America]], and was the location of the earliest kite soundings of the atmosphere in North America in the 1890s, as well as the development of the [[radiosonde]] in the 1930s.

Founded by [[Abbott Lawrence Rotch]] in 1884, the observatory took a leading role in the newly emerging science of meteorology and was the scene of many of the first scientific measurements of upper atmosphere weather conditions, using kites to carry weather instruments aloft. Knowledge of wind velocities, air temperature and relative humidity at various levels came into use as vital elements in weather prediction due to techniques developed at this site. By 1895 the observatory was the source of weather forecasts of remarkable accuracy. On October 8, 1896, a record of 8740 feet (2,665 m) was achieved for a weather kite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Fragments of Science|journal=Popular Science Monthly|date=November 1897|page=137|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/68249#page/145/mode/1up|accessdate=7 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the [[Great New England Hurricane of 1938]], the observatory measured the strongest wind gust ever directly measured and recorded in a hurricane at 186&amp;nbsp;mph (299&amp;nbsp;km/h).&lt;ref&gt;"ANNIVERSARY OF GREAT NEW ENGLAND HURRICANE OF 1938
" http://www.bluehill.org/Data/2010/september/sep21.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

The observatory remains active to this day, continuing to add to its data base of weather observations now more than one hundred years old, and stands as a monument to the science of meteorology in the United States.

The observatory offers meteorological science programs and is open to the public on weekends.

==History==

===Site===
The Blue Hill Meteorological Observatory was founded by American [[meteorologist]] Abbott Lawrence Rotch (1861‚Äì1912) in 1884.  By the time he graduated from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1884, Rotch had conceived and carried into execution his plans for the erection of a meteorological observatory on the summit of the Great Blue Hill, ten miles south of [[Boston, Massachusetts]] in the [[Blue Hills Reservation]], a 6,000-acre (24&amp;nbsp;km¬≤) public park managed by the [[Department of Conservation and Recreation (Massachusetts)|Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation]].

Rotch chose the site because the elevation of 635 feet was the highest point within ten miles of the Atlantic Ocean, on the East Coast south of central Maine.  The Observatory was founded as a weather station and research facility.  This location afforded early weather scientists a unique opportunity for recording extremes of weather and experimenting with weather-recording instruments.

The observatory building was completed by the end of 1884 and the first regular observations were begun on February 1, 1885. Rotch became the first director of the observatory and maintained it at his own expense until his death in 1912 when he bequeathed it to [[Harvard University]] with an endowment of $50,000.

===The building===
[[File:Bho summit01.jpg|thumb|left|200px|View of the observatory in 1897]]

Construction of the observatory was started by Rotch in 1884 using his own private funds, and designed by architects [[Rotch &amp; Tilden]].  The original structure consisted of a two-story circular tower and an adjoining housing unit which contained two bedrooms, a dining room and a kitchen.  In 1889, a two-story east wing was added to provide additional working space for research, domestic chores, and the library.  In 1902, a two-story west wing containing a new library was added to provide additional work space.  A steel fire door and brick wall connect the library to the earlier masonry structure.  A timbrel vault (18 by 35&amp;nbsp;ft) of cohesive tiles spans the library.  The timbrel vault tile roof is believed to have been installed by the Guastavino Company using an extremely tenacious mortar developed by [[Rafael Guastavino]], the founder of the firm.

Native stone, gathered from the summit of the Great Blue Hill, was used for the two-story tower, adjoining housing unit, and the east and west wings. [[Copper sheathing]] was used for roofing.  A stone wall and iron fence were erected in 1905 to provide security for the building and instruments and privacy for the staff.  The original stone tower eventually proved to be unsuitable. Wind-driven rain penetrated its walls, damaging the instruments and records. Vibration from the instruments on masts atop the tower contributed to the structural problems.

In 1908, the original tower was demolished and a new reinforced three-story late [[Gothic Revival]] concrete tower, 20 feet 6&amp;nbsp;inches wide and 32 feet 8&amp;nbsp;inches high was constructed in its place.  The concrete construction of the tower was chosen specifically to provide the maximum amount of stability and durability in the event of high winds.  The tower has a crenelated top and a cornice containing [[dentils]].  The windows are double-hung sash with a shallow recessed arch over the windows on the first and second floors.
[[File:Great Blue Hill Weather Station Milton MA 01.jpg|thumb|left|View from the west-northwest]]
The new tower provided the durable weather-resistant, vibration-free environment necessary for accurate instrument readings.  The first floor of the tower contains the director's office.  The weather bureau is on the second floor and a laboratory and access to the roof are found on the third floor.  Various wind gauges and other meteorological recording instruments are attached to the roof of the tower.  The observatory still retains barometers and other instrumentation dating from the late 19th century.  These instruments are used to calibrate the modern instrumentation to preserve the accuracy and integrity of the data base dating back to 1885.

In 1962, a metal tower containing a [[Heliostat|siderostat]] for collecting the sun's rays and directing them by mirrors to an optical bench inside the observatory, was erected adjacent to the west wing for studies related to the upper atmosphere.  This project was abandoned after a few years.  This tower, with its mirrors still present, is no longer in use.

The observatory has been neglected for a number of years. Although the structure is generally weather-tight, due to both solid construction and a copper roof, the reinforced concrete tower is plagued by the elements. The frost-thaw cycle has caused some cracking and [[spalling]] of the concrete.

In 1980, the building was listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as "Great Blue Hill Weather Observatory", as part of a multiple property nomination by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts entitled "Prehistoric and Historic Resources of the Blue Hills and Neponset River Reservations and Selected Adjacent Lands".

In 1981, the Metropolitan District Commission transferred responsibility for the observatory to the Blue Hill Weather Club, a local group of supporters, who plan to restore the observatory and establish a weather museum on the site. The observatory will be kept open to continue its record of continuous weather observations. The [[National Weather Service]] continues to operate an [[Automated airport weather station#Automated Surface Observing System .28ASOS.29|Automated Surface Observing System]] at the site.

A white marble stone containing a summary record of climatological data from 1885 to 1984 and dedicated to the memory of Abbott Lawrence Rotch is located on the front yard of the building.

It was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1989 with name "Blue Hill Meteorological Observatory".&lt;ref name="nhlsum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nrhpinv2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Blue Hill Meteorological Observatory|date=May 1, 1989 |author=Harry Butowsky |publisher=National Park Service|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}} and {{NHLS url|id=80000665|title=''Accompanying four photos, exterior and memorial plaque, from 1984 and 1985''|photos=y}}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(32&amp;nbsp;KB)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of its operations==
[[File:Great Blue Hill Weather Station Milton MA 02.jpg|thumb|left]]
[[File:Campbell-Stokes recorder, Blue Hill Meteorological Observatory, Milton MA.jpg|thumb|right|[[Campbell‚ÄìStokes recorder]]]]
Under Rotch's leadership, the Blue Hill Meteorological Observatory quickly became famous for its pioneering studies of the upper atmosphere.  The study of cloud heights, directions and velocities that Rotch carried out at the Blue Hill Observatory made significant contributions to the knowledge of clouds in the early years of the 20th century.

Rotch continued to work at the Blue Hill Observatory until his death on April 7, 1912.  Under the terms of his will, the observatory was given to Harvard University with an endowment of $50,000 for operating costs.  Harvard operated the observatory until 1971 when it disassociated itself from the site.  The Rotch endowment was kept by Harvard.

After 1912, the Blue Hill Meteorological Observatory continued to operate as an active meteorological observatory.  Weather observations and recordings have continued to this day, providing modern meteorologists with a record of uninterrupted climatological observations that is unique in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Blue Hill Observatory and Science Center. [http://www.bluehill.org/history.html The Blue Hill Observatory:]  Retrieved on 2006-12-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since these recordings were obtained from the same site with virtually no environmental change, they provide an important index to [[climate change]].  This information is of special importance to students of climatic change, in an age where so many weather records are flawed by environmental and procedural changes, and by repeated moves of the observing site over a number of years.  For this reason, the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] designated the Blue Hill Observatory one of 26 International Benchmark stations within the [[United States]].

During the 1950s, the site housed a research group that used [[radar]] to scan approaching thunder storms as far away as western New York State, as part of an inquiry into the causes of lightning. Findings by this group were instrumental in the development of the US [[weather radar]] program. The installation consisted of a steel tower supporting a second-hand military radar set, several [[Quonset hut]]s and box trailers, surrounded by a chain-link fence. Group members were on call to monitor the radar whenever severe storms could be observed. Data were also collected from a network of amateur co-operative observers who corresponded by mail. This era coincided with the end of the long career of the famous Director of the Observatory, Dr. Charles Brooks, said to be one of the few who accurately forecast the path of the destructive [[New England Hurricane of 1938|Hurricane of September, 1938]].

==Accomplishments==
Since 1885, the staff of the observatory and others have documented the scientific work completed at the Blue Hill Observatory in almost 900 scientific publications.

'''Bridge scour''' is the removal of [[sediment]] such as [[sand]] and [[gravel]] from around [[bridge]] [[abutment]]s or [[Pier (architecture)|piers]]. Scour, caused by swiftly moving water, can scoop out ''scour holes'', compromising the integrity of a structure.&lt;ref&gt;Linda P. Warren, [http://ma.water.usgs.gov/publications/ofr/scour.htm Scour at Bridges: Stream Stability and Scour Assessment at Bridges in Massachusetts], U.S. Geological Survey, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, bridge scour is one of the three main causes of [[bridge failure]] (the others being collision and overloading). It has been estimated that 60% of all bridge failures result from scour and other hydraulic-related causes.&lt;ref name="presentation"&gt;Mark N. Landers, [http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1140&amp;context=usgsstaffpub&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fscholar.google.com%2Fscholar%3Fhl%3Den%26q%3DShirhole%2Band%2BHolt%2B1991%26as_sdt%3D0%252C22%26as_ylo%3D%26as_vis%3D0#search=%22Shirhole%20Holt%201991%22 Bridge Scour Data Management].

==Areas affected by scour==
[[Image:HomochittoRiver1974.jpg|right|thumb|240px|[[Mississippi Highway 33]] bridge over the [[Homochitto River#River modification|Homochitto River]] failed due to [[flood]] induced [[erosion]].]]

Water normally flows faster around piers and abutments making them susceptible to local scour. At bridge openings, contraction scour can occur when water accelerates as it flows through an opening that is narrower than the channel upstream from the bridge. Degradation scour occurs both upstream and downstream from a bridge over large areas. Over long periods of time, this can result in lowering of the stream bed.&lt;ref name="presentation" /&gt;

==Causes==

Stream channel instability resulting in river [[erosion]] and changing angles-of-attack can contribute to bridge scour. Debris can also have a substantial impact on bridge scour in several ways. A build-up of material can reduce the size of the waterway under a bridge causing ''contraction scour'' in the channel. A build-up of debris on the abutment can increase the obstruction area and increase ''local scour''. Debris can deflect the water flow, changing the angle of attack, increasing ''local scour''. Debris might also shift the entire channel around the bridge causing increased water flow and scour in another location.&lt;ref name="structures" /&gt;

The most frequently encountered bridge scour problems usually involve loose alluvial material that can be easily eroded. However, one should not assume that total scour in cohesive or cemented soils will not be as large as in non-cohesive soils, the scour takes longer to develop.

Many of the equations for scour were derived from laboratory studies, for which the range of applicability is difficult to ascertain. Most studies focussed on piers and pile formations, though most bridge scour problems are related to the more complex configuration of the bridge abutment. Some studies were verified using limited field data, though this is also difficult to accurately scale for physical modelling purposes. During field measurements of post scour, a scour hole that had developed on the rising stage of a flood, or at the peak, may be filled in again on the falling stage. For this reason, the maximum depth of scour cannot be simply modelled after the event.

Scour can also cause problems with the hydraulic analysis of a bridge. Scour may considerably deepen the channel through a bridge and effectively reduce or even eliminate the [[Backwater (river)|backwater]]. This reduction in backwater should not be relied on, however, because of the unpredictable nature of the processes involved.

When considering scour it is normal to distinguish between non-cohesive or cohesionless (alluvial) sediments and cohesive material. The former are usually of most interest to laboratory studies. Cohesive materials require special techniques and are poorly researched.

The first major issue when considering scour is the distinction between '''clear-water''' scour and '''live-bed''' scour. The critical issue here is whether or not the mean bed shear stress of the flow upstream of the bridge is less than or larger than the threshold value needed to move the bed material.

If the upstream shear stress is less than the threshold value, the bed material upstream of the bridge is at rest. This is referred to as the clear-water condition because the approach flow is clear and does not contain sediment. Thus, any bed material that is removed from a local scour hole is not replaced by sediment being transported by the approach flow. The maximum local scour depth is achieved when the size of the scour hole results in a local reduction in shear stress to the critical value such that the flow can no longer remove bed material from the scoured area.

Live-bed scour occurs where the upstream shear stress is greater than the threshold value and the bed material upstream of the crossing is moving. This means that the approach flow continuously transports sediment into a local scour hole. By itself, a live bed in a uniform channel will not cause a scour hole - for this to be created some additional increase in shear stress is needed, such as that caused by a contraction (natural or artificial, such as a bridge) or a local obstruction (e.g. a bridge pier). The equilibrium scour depth is achieved when material is transported into the scour hole at the same rate at which it is transported out.

Typically the maximum equilibrium clear-water scour is about 10% larger than the equilibrium live-bed scour. Conditions that favour clear water scour are:
* Bed material that is too coarse to be transported 
* Vegetated or artificial reinforced channels where velocities are only high enough due to local scour, or
* Flat bed slopes during low flows.
It is possible that both clear water and live-bed scour can occur. During a flood event,  bed shear stress may change as the flood flows change. It is possible to have clear-water conditions at the commencement of a flood event, transitioning to a live bed before reverting to clear water conditions. Note that the maximum scour depth may occur under initial clear-water conditions, not necessarily when the flood levels peak and live-bed scour is underway. Similarly, relatively high velocities can be experienced when the flow is just contained within the banks, rather than spread over the floodplains at the peak discharge.

Urbanisation has the effect of increasing flood magnitudes and causing hydrographs to peak earlier, resulting in higher stream velocities and degradation. Channel improvements or the extraction of gravel (above or below the site in question) can alter water levels, flow velocities, bed slopes and sediment transport characteristics and consequently affect scour. For instance, if an alluvial channel is straightened, widened or altered in any other way that results in an increased flow-energy condition, the channel will tend back towards a lower energy state by degrading upstream, widening and aggrading downstream.

The significance of degradation scour to bridge design is that the engineer has to decide whether the existing channel elevation is likely to be constant over the life of the bridge, or whether it will change. If change is probable then it must be allowed for when designing the waterway and foundations.

The lateral stability of a river channel may also affect scour depths, because movement of the channel may result in the bridge being incorrectly positioned or aligned with respect to the approach flow. This problem can be significant under any circumstances but is potentially very serious in arid or semi-arid regions and with ephemeral (intermittent) streams. Lateral migration rates are largely unpredictable. Sometimes a channel that has been stable for many years may suddenly start to move, but significant influences are floods, bank material, vegetation of the banks and floodplains, and land use.

Scour at bridge sites is typically classified as contraction (or constriction) scour and local scour. Contraction scour occurs over a whole cross-section as a result of the increased velocities and bed shear stresses arising from a narrowing of the channel by a construction such as a bridge. In general, the smaller the opening ratio the larger the waterway velocity and the greater the potential for scour. If the flow contracts from a wide floodplain, considerable scour and bank failure can occur. Relatively severe constrictions may require regular maintenance for decades to combat erosion. It is evident that one way to reduce contraction scour is to make the opening wider.

Local scour arises from the increased velocities and associated vortices as water accelerates around the corners of abutments, piers and spur dykes. The flow pattern around a cylindrical pier. The approaching flow decelerates as it nears the cylinder, coming to rest at the centre of the pier. The resulting stagnation pressure is highest near the water surface where the approach velocity is greatest, and smaller lower down. The downward pressure gradient at the pier face directs the flow downwards. Local pier scour begins when the downflow velocity near the stagnation point is strong enough to overcome the resistance to motion of the bed particles.

During flooding, although the foundations of a bridge might not suffer damage, the fill behind abutments may scour. This type of damage typically occurs with single-span bridges with vertical wall abutments.

==Bridge examination and scour evaluation==

The examination process is normally conducted by [[hydrologists]] and [[Hydrology|hydrologic]] technicians, and involves a review of historical [[engineering]] information about the bridge, followed by a visual inspection. Information is recorded about the type of rock or sediment carried by the river, and the angle at which the river flows toward and away from the bridge. The area under the bridge is also inspected for holes and other evidence of scour.

Bridge examination begins by office investigation. The history of the bridge and any previous scour related problems should be noted. Once a bridge is recognized as a potential scour bridge, it will proceed to further evaluation including field review, scour vulnerability analysis and prioritizing. Bridges will also be rated in different categories and prioritized for scour risk. Once a bridge is evaluated as scour critical, the bridge owner should prepare a scour plan of action to mitigate the known and potential deficiencies. The plan may include installation of countermeasures, monitoring, inspections after flood events, and procedures for closing bridges if necessary.

Alternatively, sensing technologies are also being put in place for scour assessment. The scour-sensing level can be classified into three levels: general bridge inspection, collecting limited data and collecting detailed data.&lt;ref&gt;Ettouney, Mohammed M.; Alampalli, Sreenivas (2011). Infrastructure Health in Civil 
Engineering : Applications and Management. CRC Press. Retrieved April 04, 2012, from Ebook Library.
&lt;/ref&gt; There are three different types of scour-monitoring systems: fixed, portable and geophysical positioning. Each system can help to detect scour damage in an effort to avoid bridge failure, thus increasing public safety.

==Countermeasures and prevention==
Hydraulic Engineering Circular No. 23 Manual (HEC-23) contains general design guidelines as scour countermeasures that are applicable to piers and abutments. The design guideline numbering in the following table indicates the HEC-23 design guideline chapter.

Bend way weirs, spurs and guide banks can help to align the upstream flow while riprap, gabions, articulated concrete blocks and grout filled mattresses can mechanically stabilize the pier and abutment slopes.&lt;ref&gt;Lagasse, P. F., Zevenbergen, L. W., Schall, J. D., &amp; Clopper, P. E. U.S Department of Transportation, 
Federal Highway Administration. (2001). Bridge scour and stream instability countermeasures (NHI 01-003). Retrieved from website: http://isddc.dot.gov/OLPFiles/FHWA/010592.pdf
&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Riprap]] remains the most common countermeasure used to prevent scour at bridge abutments. A number of physical additions to the abutments of bridges can help prevent scour, such as the installation of [[gabion]]s and stone pitching upstream from the foundation. The addition of sheet piles or interlocking [[prefabricated]] concrete blocks can also offer protection. These countermeasures do not change the scouring flow and are temporary since the components are known to move or be washed away in a flood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/engineering/hydraulics/library_listing.cfm |title=Publications - Hydraulics Engineering - FHWA |publisher=Fhwa.dot.gov |date=2006-04-26 |accessdate=2010-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; FHWA recommends design criteria in HEC-18 and 23, such as avoiding unfavourable flow patterns, streamlining the abutments, and designing pier foundations resistant to scour without depending upon the use of riprap or other countermeasures.

Trapezoidal-shaped channels through a bridge can significantly decrease ''local scour'' depths compared to vertical wall abutments, as they provide a smoother transition through a bridge opening. This eliminates abrupt corners that cause turbulent areas. [[Levee#Spur dykes|Spur dike]]s, barbs, [[groynes]], and vanes are river training structures that change stream hydraulics to mitigate undesirable erosion or deposits. They are usually used on unstable stream channels to help redirect stream flow to more desirable locations through the bridge. The insertion of piles or deeper footings is also used to help strengthen bridges.

==Estimating scour depth==
Hydraulic Engineering Circular No. 18 Manual (HEC-18) was published by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA).  This manual includes several techniques of estimating scour depth. The empirical scour equations for live bed scour, clear water scour, and local scour at piers and abutment are shown in Chapter 5-General Scour section. The total scour depth is determined by adding three scour components which includes the long-term aggradation and degradation of the river bed, general scour at the bridge and local scour at the piers or abutment.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, E. V., &amp; Davis, S. R. U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway 
Administration. (2001). Hydraulics engineering publications title: Evaluating scour at bridges, fourth edition description (NHI-01-001). Retrieved from website: http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/engineering/hydraulics/library_arc.cfm?pub_number=17&amp;id=37
)&lt;/ref&gt; However, research had shown that the standard equations in HEC-18 over-predict scour depth for a number of hydraulic and geologic conditions.  Most of the HEC-18 relationships are based on laboratory flume studies conducted with sand-sized sediments increased with factors of safety that are not easily recognizable or adjustable.&lt;ref&gt;Chase, K. J., Holnbeck, S. R., Montana., &amp; Geological Survey (U.S.). (2004). Evaluation of 
pier-scour equations for coarse-bed streams. Reston, Va: U.S. Dept. of the Interior, U.S. Geological Survey.
&lt;/ref&gt; Sand and fine gravel are the most easily eroded bed materials, but streams frequently contain much more scour resistant materials such as compact till, stiff clay, and shale. The consequences of using design methods based on a single soil type are especially significant for many major physiographic provinces with distinctly different geologic conditions and foundation materials. This can lead to overly conservative design values for scour in low risk or non-critical hydrologic conditions. Thus, equation improvements are continued to be made in an effort to minimize the underestimation and overestimation of scour.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1533">'''Clarkeite''' is a [[uranium oxide]] mineral of composition (Na,Ca,Pb)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(O,OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or (Na,Ca,Pb)(UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)O(OH)¬∑0-1H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.

The color of samples varies from dark brown to reddish orange. Clarkeite forms by [[oxidation]] and replacement of [[uraninite]] late during [[pegmatite]] crystallization. Although uraninite-bearing [[granite]] pegmatites are common,  clarkeite is rare and occurs intimately intergrown with other [[uranium]] minerals.

It is known from only two localities; the [[Spruce Pine, North Carolina|Spruce Pine]] pegmatite district in western [[North Carolina]], [[US]], and [[Rajputana]], in the [[Ajmer]] district, [[India]]. Clarkeite is the only known naturally occurring high-temperature uranate. The general formula for ideal clarkeite is Na[(UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)O(OH)](H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;0-1&lt;/sub&gt;.

It was named for [[Frank Wigglesworth Clarke]] (1847‚Äì1931), American mineral chemist, and former chief chemist of the [[United States Geological Survey]].

[[File:Devprayag - Confluence of Bhagirathi and Alaknanda.JPG|thumb|Confluence of the [[Bhagirathi]] and [[Alaknanda]] Rivers to produce the [[Ganges]] at [[Devprayag]], [[India]]]]
[[Image:Confluence.JPG|thumb|The same confluence viewed from upstream at a different time; note the swirl of sediment from the Alaknanda.]]
In [[geography]], a '''confluence''' (also:  ''conflux'') occurs where two or more flowing bodies of water join together to form a single channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/conflux|title=Conflux ‚Äì Definition of conflux by Merriam-Webster|work=merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A confluence can occur in several configurations:  at the point where a [[tributary]] joins a larger [[river]] ([[main stem]]); or where two streams meet to become the [[river source|source]] of a river of a new name (such as the confluence of the [[Monongahela River|Monongahela]] and [[Allegheny River|Allegheny]] rivers at [[Pittsburgh]], forming the [[Ohio River|Ohio]]); or where two separated channels of a river (forming a [[river island]]) rejoin at the downstream end.

==Scientific study of confluences==
Confluences are studied in a variety of sciences. [[Hydrology]] studies the characteristic flow patterns of confluences and how they give rise to patterns of erosion, bars, and scour pools.&lt;ref&gt;A widely cited work is James L. Best (1986) The morphology of river channel confluences.  ''Progress in Physical Geography'' 10:157‚Äì174.  For work citing Best, see [https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=16553134579381758779&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=0,5&amp;hl=en].&lt;/ref&gt; The water flows and their consequences are often studied with [[mathematical model]]s.&lt;ref&gt;A recent contribution with review of earlier work is Laurent Schindfessel, St√©phan Cre√´lle and Tom De Mulder (2015) "Flow patterns in an open channel confluence with increasingly dominant tributary inflow," ''Water'' 7: 4724‚Äì4751; available on line.&lt;/ref&gt; Confluences are relevant to the distribution of living organisms (i.e., [[ecology]]) as well; "the general pattern [downstream of confluences] of increasing stream flow and decreasing slopes drives a corresponding shift in habitat characteristics."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from Beechie et al. (2012), who cite earlier work.  Tim Beechie, John S. Richardson, Angela M. Gurnell, and Junjiro Negishi (2012) "Watershed processes, human impacts, and process-based restoration." In Philip Roni and Tim Beechie (eds.) (2012) ''Stream and Watershed Restoration: A Guide to Restoring Riverine Processes and Habitats'', John Wiley &amp; Sons. Excerpts available on line at Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another science relevant to the study of confluences is [[chemistry]], because sometimes the mixing of the waters of two streams triggers a chemical reaction, particularly in a polluted stream. The [[United States Geological Survey]] gives an example:  "chemical changes occur when a stream contaminated with [[acid mine drainage]] combines with a stream with near-neutral [[pH]] water; these reactions happen very rapidly and influence the subsequent transport of metals downstream of the mixing zone."&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Geological Survey, "How do contaminants mix at the confluence of two streams?", on line at [https://toxics.usgs.gov/highlights/contaminants_mix.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

A natural phenomenon at confluences that is obvious even to casual observers is a difference in color between the two streams; see images in this article for several examples. According to Lynch, "the color of each river is determined by many things: type and amount of vegetation in the watershed, geological properties, dissolved chemicals, [[Sediment transport|sediments]] and biologic content ‚Äì usually [[algae]]." Lynch also notes that color differences can persist for miles downstream before they finally blend completely.&lt;ref&gt;David Lynch (2014) "The Confluence of Rivers"; Earth Science Picture of the Day, at [http://epod.usra.edu/blog/2014/01/the-confluence-of-rivers.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== River confluence flow zones ===

Hydrodynamic behaviour of flow in a confluence can be divided into six distinct features&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Best|first=James L.|pages=27‚Äì35|doi=10.2110/pec.87.39.0027|title = Recent Developments in Fluvial Sedimentology|year = 1987|isbn = 978-0-918985-67-5|chapter = Flow Dynamics at River Channel Confluences: Implications for Sediment Transport and Bed Morphology}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are commonly called confluence flow zones (CFZ). These include

# Stagnation zone

==Confluences and humankind==
[[File:Point State Park fountain.jpg|thumb|The fountain at [[Point State Park]] in [[Pittsburgh]], at the apex of the confluence of the [[Allegheny River|Allegheny]] (top) and the [[Monongahela River|Monongahela]]]]
Since rivers often serve as political boundaries, confluences sometimes demarcate three abutting political entities, such as nations, states, or provinces, forming a [[tripoint]]. Various examples are found in the list below.

A number of major cities, such as [[Chongqing]], [[St. Louis]], and [[Khartoum]],  arose at confluences; further examples appear in the list. Within a city, a confluence often forms a visually prominent point, so that confluences are sometimes chosen as the site of prominent public buildings or monuments, as in [[Deutsches Eck|Koblenz]], [[Mus√©e des Confluences|Lyon]], and [[The Forks, Winnipeg|Winnipeg]]. Cities also often build parks at confluences, sometimes as projects of municipal improvement, as at [[Kelley Point Park|Portland]] and [[Point State Park|Pittsburgh]]. In other cases, a confluence is an industrial site, as in [[Philadelphia Naval Shipyard|Philadelphia]] or [[Mannheim Harbour|Mannheim]]. Often a confluence lies in the shared [[floodplain]] of the two rivers and nothing is built on it, for example at [[Manaus]], described below.

One other way that confluences may be employed by humans is as a sacred place in a [[religion]]. Rogers suggests that for the ancient peoples of the [[Iron Age]] in northwest Europe, watery locations were often sacred, especially sources and confluences.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Adam (2011) ''Late Roman Towns in Britain: Rethinking Change and Decline''.  Cambridge:  Cambridge University Press, p. 42. Excerpts available on line at Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-Christian [[Slav]]ic peoples chose confluences as the sites for fortified triangular temples, where they practiced human sacrifice and other sacred rites.&lt;ref&gt;Gasparini, Evel (n.d.) "Slavic religion", in ''Encyclopedia Brittanica'', on line edition:  [https://www.britannica.com/topic/Slavic-religion#toc548484main]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Hinduism]], the confluence of two sacred rivers often is a pilgrimage site for ritual bathing.&lt;ref&gt;Source: Letizia (2017), who writes, "as rivers are considered holy entities, at the meeting of two streams the 'sacredness' of the first river add to that of the second one. The confluence seems to have a sort of 'additive fame' ... because it gives pilgrims the chance to bathe in two rivers at the same time."&lt;/ref&gt; In Pittsburgh, a number of adherents to [[Mayanism]] consider their city's confluence to be sacred.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Rodgers, "So how did the Point get on a Mayan calendar?", ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'', June 22, 2008.  On line at [http://www.post-gazette.com/local/neighborhoods/2008/06/22/So-how-did-the-Point-get-on-a-Mayan-calendar/stories/200806220263].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable confluences==
[[File:Whiteandblueniles.jpg|thumb|The [[White Nile]] and [[Blue Nile]] merge at [[Khartoum]]; April 2013 satellite view]]

===Africa===
* At [[Lokoja]], [[Nigeria]], the [[Benue River]] flows into the [[Niger River|Niger]].
* At [[Kazungula]] in [[Zambia]], the [[Chobe River]] flows into the [[Zambezi]]. The confluence defines the [[tripoint]] of [[Zambia]] (north of the rivers), [[Botswana]] (south of the rivers) and [[Namibia]] (west of the rivers). The land border between Botswana and [[Zimbabwe]] to the east also reaches the Zambezi at this confluence, so there is a second tripoint (Zambia-Botswana-Zimbabwe) only 150 meters downstream from the first.  See [[Kazungula]] and [[Quadripoint]],  and Gallery below for image.
* The Sudanese capital of [[Khartoum]] is located at the confluence of the [[White Nile]] and the [[Blue Nile]], the beginning of the [[Nile]].

===Asia===
[[File:Mouth of Nam Khan.JPG|thumb|The [[Nam Khan]] flows into the [[Mekong]] at [[Luang Prabang]] in [[Laos]]]]
[[File:SkylineOfChongqing.jpg|thumb|The confluence of the [[Jialing River|Jialing]] and the [[Yangtze]] in [[Chongqing]]. The Yangtze flows left to right across the bottom of the image.]]
* 82&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Basra]] in [[Iraq]] at the town of [[Al-Qurnah]] is the confluence of the rivers [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]], forming the [[Shatt al-Arab]].
* At [[Devprayag]] in [[India]], the [[Ganges River]] originates at the confluence of the [[Bhagirathi]] and the [[Alaknanda]]; see images above.
* Near [[Allahabad]], India, the [[Yamuna]] flows into the Ganges. In [[Hinduism]], this is a pilgrimage site for ritual bathing;&lt;ref&gt;See reporting in the ''New York Times'' ([https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/15/world/for-hindu-millions-rivers-of-divine-nectar.html?mcubz=1]) and ''The Atlantic'' ([https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2013/01/kumbh-mela-the-largest-gathering-on-earth/100438/]).&lt;/ref&gt; during a [[Kumbh Mela]] event tens of millions of people visit the site. In Hindu belief the site is held to be a ''triple'' confluence ([[Triveni Sangam]]), the third river being the metaphysical (not physically present) [[Sarasvati River|Sarasvati]].&lt;ref&gt;The incorporation of invisible rivers into confluences elsewhere in the subcontinent is documented by Letizia (2017).&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Kuala Lumpur]], the capital of [[Malaysia]], is where the [[Gombak River]] (previously known as Sungai Lumpur, which means "muddy river") flows into the [[Klang River]] at the site of the [[Jamek Mosque]]. Recently, the Kolam Biru (Blue Pool), a pool with elaborate fountains, has been installed at the apex of the confluence.&lt;ref&gt;See ''New Straits Times'', August 28, 2017, 'Najib launches River of Life, Blue Pool projects", at [https://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2017/08/273894/najib-launches-river-life-blue-pool-projects].&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Nam Khan]] River flows into the Mekong at [[Luang Prabang]] in Laos.
* The [[Jialing River|Jialing]] flows into the [[Yangtze]] at [[Chongqing]] in [[China]]. The confluence forms a focal point in the city, marked by Chaotianmen Square, built in 1998.
* In the Far East, the [[Amur River|Amur]] forms the international boundary between China and [[Russia]]. The [[Ussuri]], which also demarcates the border, flows into the Amur at a point midway between [[Fuyuan, Heilongjiang|Fuyuan]] in China and [[Khabarovsk]] in Russia. The apex of the confluence is located in a rural area, part of China, where a commemorative park, Dongji Square, has been built; it features an enormous sculpture representing the Chinese character for "East".&lt;ref&gt;See Bruno Ma√ß√£es, "Signs and Symbols on the Sino-Russian Border", published in ''[[The Diplomat]]''.  On line at [http://thediplomat.com/2016/05/signs-and-symbols-on-the-sino-russian-border/].&lt;/ref&gt; The Amur-Ussuri border region was the location of the [[Sino-Soviet border conflict]] of 1969; the borderline near the confluence was settled peacefully by treaty in 2008.

===Australia===
* The two largest rivers in Australia, the [[Murray River|Murray]] and its tributary the [[Darling River|Darling]], converge at [[Wentworth, New South Wales]].
* The [[Franklin River|Franklin]] flows into the [[Gordon River|Gordon]] in south-western [[Tasmania]].

[[File:DSC00679 Ile de la Cite.JPG|thumb|The [[Seine]] becomes a single channel at the west end of the [[√éle de la Cit√©]] in [[Paris]]. The [[Pont Neuf]] can be seen.]]

===Europe===
====Seine====
* The [[Seine]] divides in the historical center of [[Paris]], flowing around two river islands, the [[√éle Saint-Louis]] and the [[√éle de la Cit√©]]. At the downstream confluence, where the river becomes a single channel again, the √éle de la Cit√© is crossed by the famous [[Pont Neuf]], adjacent to an equestrian statue of King [[Henri IV]] and the historically more recent Vert Galant park. The site has repeatedly been portrayed by artists including [[Claude Monet|Monet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]], and [[Camille Pissarro|Pissarro]].
* Further upstream, the [[Marne (river)|Marne]] empties into the Seine at [[Charenton-le-Pont]], just southeast of the Paris city limits. The site is dominated by the [[:fr:Huatian Chinagora|Huatian Chinagora]], a four-star hotel under Chinese management.
[[Image:Koblenz im Buga-Jahr 2011 - Deutsches Eck 01.jpg|thumb|The [[Moselle (river)|Mosel]] flows into the [[Rhine]] at [[Koblenz]].]]

====Rhine====
* The [[Rhine]] carries much river traffic, and major inland ports are found at its confluence with the [[Ruhr (river)|Ruhr]] at [[Duisburg]], and with the [[Neckar]] at [[Mannheim]]; see [[Mannheim Harbour]].
* The [[Main River|Main]] flows into the Rhine just south of [[Mainz]].
* The [[Moselle (river)|Mosel]] flows into the Rhine further north at [[Koblenz]]. The name "Koblenz" itself has its origin in the Latin name "Confluentes". In German, this confluence is known as the "[[Deutsches Eck]]" ("German corner") and is the site of an imposing monument to German unification featuring an equestrian statue of [[Kaiser Wilhelm I]].
* Upstream in [[Switzerland]], a small town also named [[Koblenz, Switzerland|Koblenz]] (for the same reason) is where the [[Aare River|Aare]] joins the Rhine.

====Danube basin====
[[File:Passau aerial view 1.jpg|thumb|The triple confluence in [[Passau]]; from left to right, the [[Inn River|Inn]], the [[Danube]], and the [[Ilz]].]]
* [[Passau]], Germany, sometimes called the {{lang|de|Dreifl√ºssestadt}} (City of Three Rivers), is the site of a triple confluence, described thus in a guidebook: "from the north the little [[Ilz]] sluices brackish water down from the [[peat]]-rich [[Bavarian Forest]], meeting the cloudy brown of the [[Danube]] as it flows from the west and the pale snow-melt jade of the [[Inn River|Inn]] from the south [i.e., the [[Alps]]] to create a murky tricolour."&lt;ref&gt;See Andrea Schulte-Peevers, Kerry Christiani, Marc Di Duca, Catherine Le Nevez, Tom Masters, Ryan Ver Berkmoes, and Benedict Walker (2016) ''Lonely Planet Germany'', Lonely Planet Publishing. Excepts posted on line at Google Books:  [https://books.google.com/books?id=dRiHCwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=dreiflusseeck+passau&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Thaya River|Thaya]] flows into the [[Morava (river)|Morava]] in a rural location near [[Hohenau an der March]] in Austria, forming the [[tripoint]] of Austria, Czechia, and Slovakia.
* The Morava flows into the Danube at [[Dev√≠n]], on the border between Slovakia and Austria.
* The [[Sava]] flows into the Danube at [[Belgrade]], the capital of [[Serbia]].
* In [[karst|karst topography]], which arises in soluble rock, rivers sometimes flow underground and form subterranean confluences, as at [[Planina Cave]] in [[Slovenia]], where the [[Pivka (river)|Pivka]] and [[Rak (river)|Rak]] merge to form the [[Unica (river)|Unica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.dedi.si/dediscina/89-planinska-jama |language=Slovenian|title=Planinska jama |trans-title=Planina Cave |encyclopedia=Enciklopedija naravne in kulturne dedi≈°ƒçine na Slovenskem [Encyclopedia of Natural and Cultural Heritage in Slovenia] |first1=Janja |last1=Kogov≈°ek |first2=Metka |last2=Petriƒç |first3=Nadja |last3=Zupan Hajna |first4=Tanja |last4=Pipan |editor1-first=Mateja |editor1-last=≈†mid Hribar |editor2-first=Gregor |editor2-last=Gole≈æ |editor3-first=Dan |editor3-last=Podjed |editor4-first=Drago |editor4-last=Kladnik |editor5-first=Bojan |editor5-last=Erhartiƒç |editor6-first=Primo≈æ |editor6-last=Pavlin |editor7-first=Jerele |editor7-last=Ines |accessdate=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other====
* [[Lyon]], [[France]] lies where the [[Sa√¥ne]] flows into the [[Rhone]]. A major new museum of science and anthropology, the [[Mus√©e des Confluences]], opened on the site in 2014.
* The [[Lusatian Neisse]] flows into the [[Oder]] at a rural location in Poland opposite the German village of Ratzdorf. The two rivers form the [[Oder-Neisse line]], the postwar boundary of Germany and Poland.
* The [[Triangle of Three Emperors]], a former political [[tripoint]], lies in present-day [[Poland]]. The empires that abutted (in the decades before World War I) were the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]], [[German Empire|German]], and [[Russian Empire|Russian]].
* [[Rovaniemi]], the capital of [[Finland|Finnish]] [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]] and one of the largest towns above the [[Arctic Circle]], is at the confluence of rivers [[Ounasjoki]] and [[Kemijoki]].
* [[Kryvyi Rih]], [[Ukraine]] is located (and named after) on the confluence of the [[Saksahan]] and [[Inhulets River]].
* The [[Oka River|Oka]] flows into the [[Volga]] at [[Nizhny Novgorod]] in [[Russia]]. The [[Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, Nizhny Novgorod|Alexander Nevsky Cathedral]] overlooks the site.

'''Mississippi basin'''
* [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]] lies atop bluffs overlooking the confluence of the [[Mississippi River]] with its tributary the [[Yazoo River|Yazoo]]. Both rivers, as well as the bluffs, played an important role in the [[Vicksburg Campaign]], a pivotal event of the [[American Civil War]].
* The [[Missouri River]] flows into the [[Mississippi River]] at [[Jones-Confluence Point State Park]], just north of [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. Slightly further upstream, the [[Illinois River]] flows into the Mississippi.
* The [[Madison River|Madison]], [[Jefferson River|Jefferson]] and [[Gallatin River|Gallatin]] Rivers in [[Three Forks, Montana]] form the confluence of the Missouri River.
* At [[Keokuk, Iowa]], the [[Des Moines River]] flows into the Mississippi. This forms the political [[tripoint]] between the U.S. states of [[Iowa]], [[Missouri]], and [[Illinois]].
* Just south of [[Cairo, Illinois]], the [[Ohio River]] flows into the Mississippi, forming the tripoint between the states of [[Illinois]], [[Missouri]], and [[Kentucky]].
* The Ohio River is formed by the confluence of the [[Monongahela River|Monongahela]] and [[Allegheny River|Allegheny]] rivers, located in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]]. The site is of great historical significance; in the 1970s it was upgraded by the creation of [[Point State Park]], highlighted by a large fountain.
'''Atlantic watersheds'''
* At [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia]], the [[Shenandoah River]] flows into the [[Potomac River]], at the [[tripoint]] of the U.S. states of [[Virginia]], [[West Virginia]], and [[Maryland]].
* At [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], the [[Schuylkill River]] flows into the [[Delaware River]], next to the former [[Philadelphia Naval Shipyard]]; the site remains industrial.
* At [[Cohoes, New York]], a few miles north of [[Albany, New York|Albany]], the [[Mohawk River]] flows into the [[Hudson River|Hudson]] in three channels separated by islands. The confluence is historically important: upstream traffic on or along the Hudson often took a left turn at the Mohawk, which offers a uniquely level passageway through the [[Appalachian Mountains]] that assisted commerce and the settlement of the West.
* At [[Ottawa]], the capital of Canada, the [[Rideau River]] flows‚Äîunusually, as a waterfall‚Äîinto the [[Ottawa River]]; see [[Rideau Falls]]. On the island separating the two portions of the falls is a park with military monuments, among them the [[Ottawa Memorial]].
* The [[Hochelaga Archipelago]], including the island and city of [[Montreal]], is located where the [[Ottawa River]] flows into the [[St. Lawrence River]] in [[Quebec]], [[Canada]].
* [[Winnipeg]], [[Canada]], is at the confluence of the [[Red River of the North|Red River]], and the [[Assiniboine River]].  The area is referred to as [[The Forks, Winnipeg|The Forks]] by locals, and has been an important trade location for over 6000 years.
'''Pacific watersheds'''
* The [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]] flows into the [[Colorado River]] at the heart of [[Canyonlands National Park]] in [[Utah]]'s [[Canyon Country]].
* The [[Snake River]] flows into the [[Columbia River]] at the [[Tri-Cities (WA)|Tri-Cities]] of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]].
* In [[Portland, Oregon]], the [[Willamette River]] flows into the Columbia at [[Kelley Point Park]], built on land acquired from the Port of Portland in 1984.
* [[Lytton, British Columbia]], [[Canada]], is located at the confluence of the muddy [[Fraser River]] and the clearer [[Thompson River]].

===South America===
* [[Manaus]], [[Brazil]] is on the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]] near its confluence with the [[Amazon River|Amazon]] (see [[Meeting of Waters]]). It is the chief port and a hub for the region's extensive river system.
* The [[Iguazu River|Iguaz√∫]] flows into the [[Paran√° River|Paran√°]] at the "Triple Frontier" ({{lang-es|La Triple Frontera}}, {{lang-pt|Tr√≠plice Fronteira}}), the [[tripoint]] for [[Paraguay]], [[Argentina]], and [[Brazil]].

==Confluences of two waterways==
[[Image:IHNCconfluence.png|thumb|left|'''Confluence of canals'''&lt;br /&gt;This simplified diagram shows how a section of the Industrial Canal in [[New Orleans]] also serves as the channel for the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway and the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet Canal. At the bottom, a portion of the Intracoastal is also shown to be "confluent" with the Mississippi River.]]
Occasionally "confluence" is used to describe the meeting of tidal or other non-riverine bodies of water, such as two canals&lt;ref&gt;The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers refers to the confluence of the [[Assawoman Canal]] with the [[Bethany Loop Canal]] in Delaware. See: {{cite web

The term confluence also applies to the merger of the flow of two [[glacier]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Kotlyakov and Anna Komarova (2006) ''Elsevier's Dictionary of Geography: in English, Russian, French, Spanish and German''.  Elsevier.  Passage cited may be accessed on [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''DLR-Tubsat''' ([[Pseudonym|a.k.a.]] ''TUBSAT'') was a [[Germany|German]] [[remote sensing]] [[Miniaturized satellite#Microsatellites|microsatellite]], developed in [[joint venture]] between [[Technical University of Berlin]] (TUB) and [[German Aerospace Center]] (DLR).

==Mission objectives==
The prime objective of DLR-Tubsat was to test [[attitude control]] system (S/C attitude recovery from hibernation). The secondary objective of the mission was to test a TV camera system for disaster monitoring with the goal of the introduction of an interactive Earth observation concept, where the target is not identified in advance, a search action may be involved, or a particular target region has to be followed visually from orbit.&lt;ref name="TUBSAT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DLR-Tubsat"&gt;{{cite news|title=DLR-Tubsat|publisher=skyrocket.de|accessdate=9 Jul 2016|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/dlr-tubsat.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Flight Experiences With DLR-Tubsat"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="976">A '''hazard quotient''' is the ratio of the potential [[Exposure assessment|exposure]] to a substance and the level at which no adverse effects are expected. If the Hazard Quotient is calculated to be less than 1, then no adverse health effects are expected as a result of exposure. If the Hazard Quotient is greater than 1, then adverse health effects are possible. The Hazard Quotient cannot be translated to a [[probability]] that adverse health effects will occur, and is unlikely to be proportional to [[risk]]. It is especially important to note that a Hazard Quotient exceeding 1 does not necessarily mean that adverse effects will occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www3.epa.gov/airtoxics/natamain/gloss1.html|title=NATA Glossary of Key Terms|accessdate=2015-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7673">'''Hybrid wood''' or '''wood hybrid systems (WHS)''' is a multilayer [[composite material]], composed on the surface of a skin made of composite wood ([[Wood-plastic composite|WPC]]) adhering to an underneath structural core, in general aluminum. Invented in Japan in 2008, this technological evolution is based on wood composite technology which was conceived in 1972 by Sadao Nishibori&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://patents.justia.com/inventor/sadao-nishibori|title=Sadao Nishibori Inventions, Patents and Patent Applications - Justia Patents Search|website=patents.justia.com|access-date=2016-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and patented in 1983&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.patentgenius.com/patent/4610900.html|title=Wood-like molded product of synthetic resin - Patent # 4610900 - PatentGenius|website=www.patentgenius.com|access-date=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; to substitute [http://www.wood-database.com/wood-articles/restricted-and-endangered-wood-species/ threatened exotic wood species].

In truth, speaking of hybrid wood profiles only makes sense when the outer layer ‚Äì the composite wood ‚Äì and the core ‚Äì aluminum ‚Äì are adhering sufficiently to each other to prevent any [[delamination]] under any climatic conditions to which they may be exposed. To this day, only [[Plastics extrusion#Coextrusion|coextrusion]] at high temperature of a powerful adhesive and of composite wood allows the "fusion" of 2 materials as different as aluminum and composite wood. This adhesiveness is so powerful that [[Bending (metalworking)|bending]] the profiles is possible even at very low radii, thus broadening significantly the fields of applications.

In the construction, decoration or design industry sector, hybrid woods have the look, feel and sometimes smell of natural wood. They are easier to install and better performing than natural wood and their exceptional properties allow utilizations that are many times broader than those of wood. They are used in exterior and interior applications such as fa√ßades trims, [[Cladding (construction)|cladding]], [[louver]]s, screens, [[pergola]], [[Canopy (building)|canopies]] or any durable installations such as [[Street furniture|urban furniture]] for instance.

==Manufacturing==
[[File:Bois Hybride Geolam 01.jpg|alt=Hybrid wood|thumb|256x256px|Hybrid wood]]
Wood hybrid profiles are obtained through [[extrusion]]. The wood composite covers a core in [[Anodizing#Anodized aluminium|anodized aluminum]] core. The optimal adhesiveness between these two materials is made possible by applying a [[Plastics extrusion#Coextrusion|coextruded]] intermediate adhesive layer. The wood composite layer can be applied on only one side of the profile if so required. The wood fibers to resins ratio as well as the type of core vary according to the desired characteristics. Manufacturing of these profiles generates a low carbon print only if the raw materials are of recycled origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.geolam.com/sites/default/files/medias/documentations/en_geolam_low_carbon_footprint.pdf|title=LCCO2 calculation|last=Wada|first=Yasuhiko|date=1994|website=|publisher=Wood Plastic Recycled Composite Industrial Committee Japan|access-date=2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
[[File:Wood-hybrid-composite-WHS.jpg|alt=hybrid wood|thumb|256x256px|Bent hybrid wood]]
The lifetime of wood hybrid profiles is significantly longer than that of exotic woods, both internally and externally. For the same cross section, the aluminum used for the core allows the profile to be lighter, more stable (no shrinkage, no warping, no splinter, no knot) and more rigid than a natural wood profile, thus allowing longer spans between supports or longer cantilevers. Over time and without maintenance the aspect of the overall installation as well of the surface of the profiles will remain in accordance to the wishes of the designer or the architect. The material is rot proof, is insensitive to bad weather, sun exposure, fungus or termites. The combination of the physical properties of the core and of the aesthetics of the composite wood allows hybrid woods to outperform:

*'''Composite woods''': because of their mechanical properties, their dimensional stability, their lightness, and their ease of implementation.
*'''Natural woods:'''  because of their durability, their original colorfastness, their lengths and cross sections and the lack of maintenance or staining, independently of the climatic conditions or the moisture level of their environment.

==History==
Hollow composite woods, invented in 1992,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.patentgenius.com/patent/5323971.html|title=Pulverizing, separating, and size regulating molded resin articles - Patent # 5323971 - PatentGenius|website=www.patentgenius.com|access-date=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; offer a weak mechanical resistance. During their installation as railings or louvers, it is imperative that metallic supporting rods be inserted in the cells in order to avoid the profiles to flex, buckle or warp. Without these rods and for this particular technology, these disturbances remain unavoidable under the joint actions of bad weather, of the sun and of moisture intake by the material. The use of the supporting rods creates another issue: the notable difference of the expansion coefficient of both raw materials (a 3.5 factor between hybrid wood and metal) creates frequent disturbances, even when installation has been carefully made. For a horizontal installation, the stagnation of condensation waters between composite and metal decreases the durability of the installation.

In 2008, major technological advancements&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.patentgenius.com/patent/5080292.html|title=Method for pulverizing gelatin, and paint, coating layer, film and     finished cloth - Patent # 5080292 - PatentGenius|website=www.patentgenius.com|access-date=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowed to marry two distinct technologies: extrusion of a correctly assayed compound&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.patentgenius.com/patent/5665425.html|title=Wood meal and method of manufacturing the same - Patent # 5665425 - PatentGenius|website=www.patentgenius.com|access-date=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and application through extrusion at high temperature of a layered adhesive. This "fusion" of such different materials ‚Äì composite wood and aluminum ‚Äì is made possible by the thin adhesive layered sandwiched between outer skin and central core. This breakthrough allows today to market   easy to install products with the look and feel of exotic wood and perfectly durable without maintenance.

==Applications==
[[File:Facade bois hybride paris geolam 01.jpg|alt=Fa√ßade in hybrid wood (Paris)|thumb|354x354px|Fa√ßade in hybrid wood]]
For new buildings as well as for renovations, hybrid wood profiles are perfectly suitable for [[Cladding (construction)|cladding]], [[siding]], screen wall, [[windbreak]], [[fence]], [[pergola]], trims, [[louver]]s and [[Handrail|railings]].

[[File:ErRedeteMitDemViehDenV√∂gelnUndDenFischen.jpg|thumb|First edition&lt;br&gt;(publ. Verlag Dr. G. Borotha-Schoeler)]]
'''''King Solomon's Ring''''' is a [[zoology|zoological]] book for the general audience, written by the [[Austria]]n scientist [[Konrad Lorenz]] in 1949.  The first English-language edition appeared in 1952.

The book's title refers to the legendary [[Seal of Solomon]], a ring that supposedly gave King [[Solomon]] the power to speak to animals.  Lorenz claims that he likewise achieved this feat of communication with several [[species]].  He accomplished this by raising them in and around his home and observing their behavior.  ''King Solomon's Ring'' describes the methods of his investigation, and his resulting findings about [[animal psychology]].

Lorenz's findings include the surprisingly refined social system of the common Eurasian [[jackdaw]], the uncanny behavior and bodily features of the tiny [[water shrew]], and the surprisingly complex interactions of seemingly unintelligent aquarium [[fish]]. He interlards his [[narrative]] with [[anecdote]]s based on his unusual methods, without which he could not have made many of his observations.

''King Solomon's Ring'' dispels several common misconceptions about animals' intelligence, but at the same time points out many of their similarities with humans, although some of these similarities come from speculative extrapolations (in fact, Lorenz has been criticized for excessive [[anthropomorphism]]). ''King Solomon's Ring'' also addresses the issue of keeping [[pet]]s. Lorenz praises the benefits that a pet owner derives from his pet, however, he also describes the hazards that an animal can pose to the inhabitants and material contents of a house, and the ways in which a pet's captivity can make it miserable, and explains how to avoid each of these causes for discontent.

A few of the findings it presents have found their way into [[common knowledge]] since its publication, such as the phenomenon of [[imprinting (psychology)|imprinting]].  {{As of|2005}}, it has been printed at least six times in English, and is still being published.

A '''lava spine''' is a vertically growing monolith of viscous [[lava]] that is slowly forced from a [[volcanic vent]], such as those growing on a [[lava dome]] (Bates &amp; Jackson, 1987). It may also be considered a kind of dome called a spiny dome (Fink &amp; Anderson, 2000). In February 1983, the dome activity of [[Mount St. Helens]] culminated in a spine that reached a height of about 100&amp;nbsp;ft before collapsing after two weeks, but another lava spine called the '''Whaleback''' never collapsed. A [[diatreme]] may also be referred to as a lava spine, such as the [[Mount Pelee#Volcanic spine|example of Mount Pelee]] in 1902.

==Volcanoes==
{{Further|List of Cascade volcanoes}}

Volcanoes south of the [[Fraser River]] in the [[Cascade Volcanoes|Cascade Volcanic Arc]] (a [[geology|geological]] term) belong to the Cascade Range (a [[geography|geographic]] term). Peaks are listed north to south.

===North Cascades===
[[File:Mount Baker.jpg|thumb|right|Mount Baker]]
*[[Coquihalla Mountain]] (southern British Columbia)&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; highest peak in the [[Bedded Range]]. It is a major preserved [[stratovolcano]] in the [[Pemberton Volcanic Belt]], an extinct portion of the [[Canadian Cascade Arc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Monger|first=J.W.H.|chapter=Character of volcanism, volcanic hazards, and risk, northern end of the Cascade magmatic arc, British Columbia and Washington State|page=235|title=Geology and Geological Hazards of the Vancouver Region, Southwestern British Columbia|date=1994|publisher=[[Natural Resources Canada]]|location=[[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]]|isbn=0-660-15784-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mount Baker is one of the snowiest places on Earth; in 1999 the ski area (on a subsidiary peak) recorded the world's greatest single-season snowfall: {{convert|1140|in|mm|abbr=on}}.
*[[Glacier Peak]] (northern Washington)&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; secluded and relatively inaccessible peak. Contrary to its name, its glacial cover is not that extensive. The volcano is surprisingly small in volume, and gets most of its height by having grown atop a nonvolcanic ridge.

===High Cascades===

*[[Mount Rainier]] (southeast of [[Tacoma, Washington]])&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; highest peak in the Cascades, it dominates the surrounding landscape. There is no other higher peak northward until the Yukon-Alaska-BC border apex beyond the [[Alsek River]].
*[[Mount St. Helens]] (southern Washington)&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; Erupted in 1980, leveling forests to the north of the mountain and sending ash across the northwest. The northern part of the mountain was destroyed in the blast ([[1980 Mount St. Helens eruption]]).
*[[Mount Adams (Washington)|Mount Adams]] (east of Mount St. Helens)&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; the second highest peak in Washington and third highest in the Cascade Range.
*[[Mount Hood]] (northern [[Oregon]])&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; the highest peak in Oregon and arguably the most frequently climbed major peak in the Cascades.
*[[Mount Jefferson (Oregon)|Mount Jefferson]] (northcentral Oregon)&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; the second highest peak in Oregon.
*[[Three Fingered Jack]] (northcentral Oregon)&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; Highly eroded [[Pleistocene]] volcano.
*[[Mount Washington (Oregon)|Mount Washington]] (between Santiam and McKenzie passes)&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; a highly eroded shield volcano.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://areas.wildernet.com/pages/area.cfm?areaname=Mount%20Washington%20Wilderness&amp;CU_ID=144|publisher=Wildernet.com|title=Mount Washington Wilderness, Willamette National Forest, Oregon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Three Sisters (Oregon)|Three Sisters]] (near the city of [[Bend, Oregon]])&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; South Sister is the highest and youngest, with a well-defined crater. Middle Sister is more pyramidal and eroded. North Sister is the oldest and has a crumbling rock pinnacle.
*[[Broken Top]] (to the southeast of South Sister)&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; a highly eroded extinct [[stratovolcano]]. Contains [[Bend Glacier|Bend]] and [[Crook Glacier]]s.
*[[Newberry Volcano]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; isolated [[caldera]] with two crater [[lake]]s. Very variable lavas. Flows from here have reached the city of Bend.
*[[Mount Bachelor]] (near Three Sisters)&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; a geologically young (less than 15,000 years) shield-to-stratovolcano which is now the site of a popular [[skiing|ski]] resort. ([[Mt. Bachelor ski area]])
*[[Diamond Peak (Oregon)|Diamond Peak]] (south of [[Willamette Pass]]) &amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; a {{convert|8744|ft|m|abbr=on}} volcano composed of {{convert|15|km3|cumi|1|abbr=on}} of [[basaltic andesite]].
*[[Mount Bailey (Oregon)|Mount Bailey]] (north of Mount Mazama)
*[[Mount Thielsen]] (east of Mount Bailey)&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; highly eroded volcano with a prominent spire, making it the Lightning Rod of the Cascades.
*[[Mount Mazama]] (southern Oregon)&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; better known for its [[Crater Lake]], which is a [[caldera]] formed by a catastrophic eruption which took out most of the summit roughly 6,900 years ago. Mount Mazama is estimated to have been about {{convert|11000|ft|m|abbr=on}} elevation prior to the blast.
*[[Mount Scott (Klamath County, Oregon)|Mount Scott]] (southern Oregon)&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; on the southeastern flank of Crater Lake.  At {{convert|8929|ft|m|abbr=on}} elevation, this small stratovolcano is the highest peak in [[Crater Lake National Park]].
*[[Mount McLoughlin]] (near [[Klamath Falls, Oregon]])&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; presents a symmetrical appearance when viewed from [[Klamath Lake]].
*[[Medicine Lake Volcano]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; a [[shield volcano]] in [[northern California]] which is the largest volcano by volume in the Cascades.
*[[Mount Shasta]] (northern California)&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; second highest peak in the Cascades. Can be seen in the [[Sacramento Valley]] as far as {{convert|140|mi|km|abbr=on}} away, as it is a dominating feature of the region.
*[[Lassen Peak]] (south of Mount Shasta)&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; southernmost volcano in the Cascades and the most easily climbed peak in the Cascades. It erupted from 1914 to 1921, and like Mount Shasta, it too can be seen in the Sacramento Valley, up to {{convert|120|mi|km|abbr=on}} away. Lowest Peak because the Cascades extend from it.

This is a list of [[wetland]]s in Australia that are designated by the [[Ramsar Convention]] as sites of international importance. Under the Convention, the wetlands are considered as being of significant value not only for the Australian community, but for humanity as a whole.

The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands came into force for Australia on {{start date|1975|12|21|df=y}}. As of 28 February 2018, Australia has 66 sites designated as Wetlands of International Importance, with a total area of {{convert| 8342175|ha|acre}}.&lt;ref name="Ramsar list"&gt;{{cite web|title=The List of Wetlands of International Importance|url=http://www.ramsar.org/pdf/sitelist.pdf|type=PDF|publisher=The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands|accessdate=28 June 2014|date=19 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=annotated&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ramsar.org/cda/en/ramsar-pubs-annolist-annotated-ramsar-16713/main/ramsar/1-30-168%5E16713_4000_0__ |title=The Annotated Ramsar List: Australia |accessdate=28 June 2014 |work=The Annotated Ramsar List of Wetlands of International Importance |publisher=The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands |date=10 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110919211637/http://www.ramsar.org/cda/en/ramsar-pubs-annolist-annotated-ramsar-16713/main/ramsar/1-30-168%5E16713_4000_0__ |archivedate=19 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RS2344"/&gt;  

==Management of Ramsar wetlands in the Australian jurisdiction==
The management of Ramsar sites listed within Australia is controlled at national level by the Australian government via the ''[[Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999]]'' and its accompanying regulations, the ''Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Regulations 2000''.&lt;ref name=EPBC-Act&gt;{{cite web|title=ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION ACT 1999|url=http://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/epabca1999588/|publisher=[[Australasian Legal Information Institute]]|accessdate=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Regulation10point02&gt;{{cite web|title=ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION REGULATIONS 2000 - REG 10.02|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_reg/epabcr2000697/s10.02.html|publisher=[[Australasian Legal Information Institute]]|accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act, as of 2015, lists the principles required for meeting treaty obligations in respect to ‚Äúwetlands of international importance‚Äù including ‚Äúenvironmental approvals‚Äù (i.e. sections 16-17B), the prerequisites for the making of both ‚Äúdeclarations‚Äù and ‚Äúbilateral agreements‚Äù (i.e. sections 34C and 37F, and 52 respectively), the approval process (i.e. section 138), ‚Äústrategic assessments‚Äù (i.e. section 134J), and the management approach (i.e. sections 325 to 336 inclusive).&lt;ref name=EPBC-Act/&gt;

The applicable regulation (i.e. regulation 10.02) lists three requirements as of 2015.  Firstly, a set of general principles for management is described including the need for "public consultation," the involvement of parties with an interest and/or who may be affected by the management of wetland, as well as allowing for "continuing community and technical input."  Secondly, the requirements for the management plan to be prepared for each listed wetland are described.  Thirdly, the requirements for the ‚Äúenvironmental impact assessment and approval" are described for parties wishing to undertake activities that are likely to have "a significant impact on the ecological character of a Ramsar wetland."&lt;ref name=Regulation10point02/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schedule6&gt;{{cite web|title=ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION REGULATIONS 2000 - SCHEDULE 6|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_reg/epabcr2000697/sch6.html|publisher=[[Australasian Legal Information Institute]]|accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of representative [[animal]]s by the number of [[neuron]]s in their whole [[nervous system]] and the number of neurons in their [[brain]] (for those with a brain). These numbers are estimates derived by multiplying the density of neurons in a particular animal by the average volume of the animal's brain.

The whole human brain contains 86 billion neurons and roughly 16 billion neurons in the cerebral cortex.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2012/feb/28/how-many-neurons-human-brain&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Herculano-Houzel2009"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The human brain in numbers: a linearly scaled-up primate brain |journal = Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|volume = 3|pages = 31|last=Herculano-Houzel |first=Suzana |date=9 November 2009 |doi=10.3389/neuro.09.031.2009 |pmid = 19915731|pmc = 2776484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[Neuron]]s are the [[cell (biology)|cells]] that transmit [[information]] in an [[animal]]'s [[nervous system]] so that it can [[sense]] [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] from its environment and [[behavior|behave]] accordingly. Not all animals have neurons; ''[[Trichoplax]]'' and [[sponge]]s lack [[nerve cell]]s altogether.

Neurons may be packed to form structures such as the [[brain]] of [[vertebrate]]s or the [[Insect physiology#Nervous system|neural ganglions]] of [[insect]]s.

The number of neurons and their relative abundance in different parts of the brain is a determinant of neural function and, consequently, of behavior.

==Whole nervous system==
{{Expand list|date=August 2008}}
&lt;!--To keep this list sortable, please put only one figure under Neurons, further details can be given under details, such as done with Ants --&gt;

All numbers for neurons (except Caenorhabditis and Ciona), and all numbers for synapses (except Ciona) are estimations.

==Cerebral cortex==
Non-mammals are included in this list because, although only mammals have a [[cerebral cortex]], the [[pallium (neuroanatomy)|pallium]] of [[reptiles]] and [[birds]] is functionally similar to the mammalian cortex and is therefore also frequently referred to as "cortex".

&lt;!--To keep this list sortable, please put only one figure under Neurons, further details can be given under details, such as done with Ants --&gt;

[[Natural history]] specimen dealers had an important role in the development of science in the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries. They supplied the rapidly growing, both in size and number, museums and educational establishments and private collectors whose collections, either in entirety or parts finally entered [[List of natural history museums|museums]].
Most sold not just [[Zoological specimen|zoological]], [[Botany|botanical]] and [[Geology|geological]] specimens but also 
equipment and books. Many also sold [[Archaeology|archaeological]] and [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] items.They purchased 
specimens from professional and amateur collectors, sometimes collected themselves as well as acting as agents for the sale of 
collections. Many were based in [[Mercantilism|mercantile]] centres notably [[Amsterdam]], [[Hamburg]], and [[London]] or 
in major cities. Some were specialists and some were [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] authorities who wrote scientific works and manuals, some functioned as trading museums or institutes.

The '''Mascarene Islands''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|m|√¶|s|k|…ô|Àà|r|iÀê|n}}, {{Lang-fr| Mascareignes}}) or '''Mascarenes''' or '''Mascarenhas Archipelago''' is a group of [[island]]s in the [[Indian Ocean]] east of [[Madagascar]] consisting of [[Mauritius]], [[R√©union]] and [[Rodrigues]]. Their name derives from the [[Portuguese people| Portuguese]] navigator [[Pedro Mascarenhas]], who first visited them in April 1512. The islands share a common [[geologic]] origin in the volcanism of the [[R√©union hotspot]] beneath the [[Mascarene Plateau]] and form a distinct [[ecoregion]] with a unique flora and fauna.

==Location and description==
The [[archipelago]] comprises three large islands, [[Mauritius]], [[R√©union]], and [[Rodrigues]], plus a number of volcanic remnants in the tropics of the southwestern Indian Ocean, generally between 700 and 1500 kilometres east of Madagascar. The [[terrain]] includes a variety of [[reef]]s, [[atoll]]s, and small islands. They present various [[Topography|topographical]] and [[Edaphology|edaphic]] regions. On the largest islands these gave rise to unusual biodiversity. The [[Oceanic climate|climate is oceanic]] and [[Tropics|tropical]].

===Geology===
[[File:Piton de la Fournaise 1.JPG|thumb|left|[[Piton de la Fournaise]]]]
The islands are [[volcanic]] in origin; [[Saya de Malha Bank|Saya de Malha]] (35 mya) was the first of the Mascarene islands to rise out of the Indian Ocean due to the [[R√©union hotspot]], followed by [[Nazareth Bank]] (some 2,000 years later), [[Soudan Bank]] and [[Cargados Carajos]]. The youngest islands to form were Mauritius (7‚Äì10 mya), the oldest of the existing islands, created along with the undersea Rodrigues ridge. The islands of Rodrigues and R√©union were created in the last two million years. R√©union is the largest of the islands (2,500&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), followed by Mauritius (1,900&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and Rodrigues (110&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Eventually Saya de Malha, Nazareth and Soudan were completely submerged, Cargados Carajos remaining as a coral atoll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Emmanuel Van Heygen |url=http://www.phelsumania.com/public/articles/biogeography_dispersal_mascarenes.html |title=Dispersal of the Genus Phelsuma in the Mascarenes |publisher=Phelsumania.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716192754/http://www.phelsumania.com/public/articles/biogeography_dispersal_mascarenes.html |archivedate=2012-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The R√©union hotspot was beginning to cool and Rodrigues came out as a small island.

R√©union is home to the highest peaks in the Mascarenes, the [[shield volcano]]es [[Piton des Neiges]] (3,069 m) and [[Piton de la Fournaise]] (2,525 m). Piton de la Fournaise, on the southeastern corner of R√©union, is one of the most active volcanoes in the world, erupting last in 2017. [[Piton de la Petite Rivi√®re Noire]] (828 m) is the highest peak on Mauritius, and the gentle hills of Rodrigues rise to only 390 m.

The [[Mascarene Plateau]] is an undersea plateau that extends approximately 2000&amp;nbsp;km, from the [[Seychelles]] to R√©union. The plateau covers an area of over 115,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of shallow water, with depths ranging from 8 to 150 meters, plunging to 4000 m to the [[abyssal plain]] at its edges. The southern part of the plateau, including the [[Saya de Malha Bank]], [[Nazareth Bank]], [[Soudan Banks]] and [[Cargados Carajos]] Shoals (Saint Brandon) (then one large island), was formed by the R√©union hotspot. These were once volcanic islands, much like Mauritius and R√©union, which have now sunk or eroded to below sea level or, in the case of the Cargados Carajos, to low coral islands. The Saya de Malha Bank formed 35 million years ago, and the Nazareth Bank and the Cargados Carajos shoals after that. [[Limestone]] banks found on the plateau are the remnants of [[coral reef]]s, indicating that the plateau was a succession of islands. Some of the banks may have been islands as recently as 18,000‚Äì6,000 years ago, when sea levels were as much as 130 meters lower during the most recent [[ice age]].

==Flora==
[[File:Foetidia mauritiana leaves.jpg|thumb|168px|right|''Foetidia mauritiana'']]
[[File:Phyllanthus tenellus 1.jpg|thumb|168px|right|''Phyllanthus tenellus'' (Mascarenes leafflower)]]
The habitats of the islands differ in size, topography, age, and in proximity to the nearest major land mass, namely (Madagascar). As is common among remote islands, the Mascarene fauna and flora display a high degree of [[endemism]]; they include over a thousand species of which several hundred are endemic.  There also are many introduced species but until Europeans first settled the islands in the sixteenth century the Mascarenes are not known to have harboured any human populations, so much of the island's wildlife, which would have gone extinct much earlier had any native people lived there, was still flourishing during the early days of settlement.

In prehistoric times the islands were covered in a diverse range of [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical moist broadleaf forest]]. At present however, though the Mascarene islands form a distinct [[ecoregion]], known as the ''[[Biodiversity of the Mascarene islands|Mascarene forests]]'', the ecoregion is not homogeneous, and comprises at least five fairly distinct vegetation zones that reflect variations in altitude and in moisture regime.

The freshwater [[Biota (ecology)|biota]] includes coastal [[wetland]]s and [[swamp forest]]s, grading into rainforest to windward and to lowland dry forest to leeward. Dryland areas include palm [[savanna]]s, [[Montane ecology|montane]] deciduous forests and heathlands on the highest peaks of R√©union.&lt;ref name="ups-tlse1"&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120130185300/http://www.edb.ups-tlse.fr/equipe1/Site_Thebaud/Publications_files/EoI_Mascarene_preprint2.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|dry lowland forests]] range from sea level to elevations of some 200 metres. They occur in regions with less than 1000&amp;nbsp;mm average annual rainfall. These dry lowland forests are dominated by palms such as [[Latania]] species and [[Dictyosperma album]], and by the palm-like screw-pines ([[Pandanus]] species). There also are sclerophyllous trees such as species in the family [[Combretaceae]], for example [[Terminalia bentzoe]] &lt;ref name="ups-tlse1"/&gt;

Semi-dry [[sclerophyllous]] [[forests]] occur between the coastal areas and an altitude of 360 metres on Mauritius and Rodrigues. On R√©union only small relict patches remain at altitudes up to 750 metres on the western slopes. This semi-dry ecosystem occurs where the average annual rainfall is about 1000‚Äì1500&amp;nbsp;mm. Characteristic families of the flora in the include [[Ebenaceae]], with [[ebony]] species in the genus [[Diospyros]]. Other tree families are occurring such as [[Pleurostylia]] spp. ([[Celastraceae]]), [[Foetidia]] spp.  ([[Lecythidaceae]]), [[Olea europea]] subsp. africana ([[Oleaceae]]), Cossinia pinnata ([[Sapindaceae]]), Dombeya spp.  (Sterculiaceae), and a variety of Sapotaceae species [[Sideroxylon boutonianum]], [[Sideroxylon borbonicum]] spp. and [[Mimusops]]. The ecosystem is also home to several spectacular endemic species of [[Hibiscus]] ([[Malvaceae]]) [[Zanthoxylum]]  spp. ([[Rutaceae]]),  Obetia ficifolia ([[Urticaceae]]), and Scolopia heterophylla ([[Flacourtiaceae]]).&lt;ref name="ups-tlse1"/&gt;

The [[lowland rainforests]] are characterized by dense [[evergreen]] forests, with a canopy exceeding 30 meters. With an average annual rainfall of 1500‚Äì6000&amp;nbsp;mm, occur on Mauritius island above 360 m and all over the eastern lowlands from the coast to 800‚Äì900 m and, on the western side. On R√©union island the Lowland rainforests is present from 750 to 1100 m. These
forests have a canopy of tall trees up to 30 m high and represent the more diversified plant communities of the Mascarene Islands. Characteristic plants include trees in the plant family [[Sapotaceae]] e.g. [[Mimusops]] spp. [[Labourdonnaisia]] spp., [[Hernandiaceae]] [[Hernandia mascarenensis]], [[Clusiaceae]] [[Calophyllum]] spp., and [[Myrtaceae]] [[Syzygium]] spp., [[Eugenia]] spp., [[Sideroxylon]] spp., [[Monimiastrum]] spp.; shrubs in the plant family Rubiaceae (Gaertnera spp., Chassalia spp., Bertiera spp., Coffea spp.); [[bamboo]]s as [[Nastus borbonicus]], numerous species of orchids (e.g.,  Angraecum spp.,  Bulbophyllum spp.) and ferns e.g., Asplenium spp., Hymenophyllum spp., Trichomanes spp., Elaphoglossum spp., Marattia fraxinea.&lt;ref name="ups-tlse1"/&gt;

The [[cloud forest]]s, a dense type of hygrophilous rainforest, occur on R√©union between 800 and 1900 m on eastern slopes with an average annual rainfall 2000‚Äì10,000&amp;nbsp;mm, and between 1100 and 2000 m on western slopes with an average annual rainfall 2000‚Äì3000&amp;nbsp;mm and are also restricted to a small area of Mauritius around the montane area "Montagne Cocotte" above 750 m on Mauritius with an average annual rainfall 4500‚Äì5500&amp;nbsp;mm.  These type of forests is present on both islands with a canopy of 6 to 10 m high. They are rich in [[epiphyte]]s (orchids, ferns, mosses, lichens), emergent [[tree fern]]s (Cyathea spp.), and, originally, palms ([[Acanthophoenix rubra]]), but these now survive only in areas of R√©union where [[poaching]] has not wiped them out. Untransformed cloud forests still cover large areas on R√©union with 44,000 ha in 2005.
These forests are characterized by trees such as Dombeya spp., on the R√©union island only, and species in the plant family Monimiaceae (Monimia spp., Tambourissa spp.) as canopy species, with small trees and shrubs sucth as Psiadia spp. (Asteraceae) and Melicope spp. (Rutaceae) in the understory. They also include large areas of three monodominant plant communities, forests with [[Acacia heterophylla]] (Fabaceae) as canopy species that are very similar to Acacia koa forests in [[Hawaii]], thickets dominated by [[Erica reunionensis]] (Ericaceae), or hyperhumid screw-pine forest ([[Pandanus montanus]]).&lt;ref name="ups-tlse1"/&gt;

The [[subalpine scrub]] with an average annual rainfall 2000‚Äì6000&amp;nbsp;mm is above the tree line to 1800‚Äì2000 m, at elevations where frosts occur regularly in winter, dominated by shrubs in the plant families of [[Ericaceae]] (Erica spp.), [[Asteraceae]] (Hubertia spp., Psiadia spp.,  Stoebe passerinoides), and [[Rhamnaceae]] ([[Phylica nitida]]), with some notable endemic species suchs Heterochaenia rivalsii (Campanulaceae), Eriotrix commersonii ([[Asteraceae]]), and Cynoglossum borbonicum ([[Boraginaceae]]).&lt;ref name="ups-tlse1"/&gt;

The summits of the [[volcano]]es are covered by large mineral areas with sparse grasslands rich in endemic grasses (Poaceae, e.g., Festuca borbonica, Agrostis salaziensis, Pennisetum caffrum) and orchids (Orchidaceae, e.g.,  Disa borbonica), ericoid thickets, or thickets of the small tree Sophora denudata ([[Fabaceae]]), depending on substrate texture and age.&lt;ref name="ups-tlse1"/&gt;

Finally the Mascarene Islands are surrounded by approximately 750 square km of coral reef. Rodrigues has nearly continuous fringing reefs bounding an extensive lagoon with deep channels, whereas Mauritius is surrounded by a discontinuous fringing reef and a small barrier reef. In contrast, R√©union has very short stretches of narrow fringing reefs along the western and southwestern coasts only. The islets of the Cargados Carajos Shoals, which have a very depauperate terrestrial biota owing to being so low-lying and swamped during cyclones, are bound to the east by an extensive arc of fringing reef, which accounts for ‚àº30% of the reefs of the Mascarene Islands. Lagoon reefs and reef flats are dominated by scleractinian corals such as branching and tabular Acropora,  Porites massives, foliaceous Montipora and Pavona, and sand consolidated with beds of seagrass such Halophila spp. ([[Hydrocharitaceae]]).
Among coral reef fishes, wrasses (Labridae), damselfish (Pomacentridae), carnivorous groupers ([[Serranidae]]), and [[surgeonfishes]] ([[Acanthuridae]]) have many species.&lt;ref name="ups-tlse1"/&gt;

Most of the indigenous Mascarene flora and fauna are thought to have descended originally from [[Madagascar|Madagascan]] and [[Africa]]n ancestors.   The Mascarenes are home to many endemic species of [[Dombeyoideae]], the [[Monotypic taxon|monotypic]] genus [[Psiloxylon]] (''[[Psiloxylon|Psiloxylon mauritianum]]''), and members of the family [[Monimiaceae]], [[Escalloniaceae]] and [[Foetidia]].  Indigenous trees for example include species in the genera [[Ocotea]], [[Erythrina]], [[Sideroxylon]] and several species of palms in the genus [[Hyophorbe]].  Ferns are prominent components of the biotas of the islands, especially in the tropical forest. Most ferns disperse easily via [[Seed dispersal|ornithochory]] of their spores, allowing fairly frequent colonization from Madagascar and exchange among the Mascarene islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ist-world.org/ProjectDetails.aspx?ProjectId=50c160d51b144d349e6b4916daaf0808&amp;SourceDatabaseId=018774364ea94468b3f4dec24aa1ee53 |title=MASCARENES FERNS - Investigating the fern diversity of the Mascarene Islands using phylogeographic approaches |publisher=Ist-world.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605145511/http://www.ist-world.org/ProjectDetails.aspx?ProjectId=50c160d51b144d349e6b4916daaf0808&amp;SourceDatabaseId=018774364ea94468b3f4dec24aa1ee53 |archivedate=2013-06-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other endemic families include the [[Asteropeiaceae]], [[Sarcolaenaceae]] and [[Sphaerosepalaceae]] (with [[psiloxylaceae]] ). The four largest families present in the Mascarene Islands are: [[Myrtaceae]], [[Rubiaceae]], [[Orchidaceae]], and [[Euphorbiaceae]], they comprise between 193 and 223 species each, for a total of 831 species, or 26.9% of the flowering plant flora. Another seven families contain 80 or more species each: [[Poaceae]], [[Apocynaceae]], [[Cyperaceae]], [[Cunoniaceae]], [[Rutaceae]], [[Araliaceae]], and [[Sapotaceae]], representing an additional ca. 660 species in all, 21.3% of the angiosperm flora. Some families that have few species, but are distributed too in the Americas, showing its ancient related origin, are typically in wet areas and occur as relict species in wet Islands wideworld, with several families including [[Phyllanthaceae]], [[Hernandiaceae]], [[Lauraceae]], [[Ebenaceae]] with Mauritius ebony, [[Diospyros tesselaria]].

The increasing disappearance of young calvaria trees, is suggested due to ''[[Cylindraspis]]'' [[tortoises]], [[fruit bat]]s or the [[broad-billed parrot]] could have been dispersing the seeds.

The [[Tambalacoque]] (''Sideroxylon grandiflorum''), often called the dodo tree, is also threatened with extinction, although this is principally as a result of unripened seed destruction by the introduced crab-eating macaque (''Macaca fascicularis'') rather than any connection to a reliance on the dodo to assist with seed germination after the seeds passed through the extinct bird's digestive tract.

In the Mascarenes, the angiosperms with 22 species have 21 endemic. The endemic [[Dombeyoideae]] from the Mascarenes are polyphyletic and split into nine clades. [[Trochetia]] appears monophyletic and more closely related to [[Eriolaena]] and [[Helmiopsis]] than to [[Dombeya]]. All Dombeya taxa are included in a clade together with [[Ruizia]] and [[Astiria]], this means that Dombeya is paraphyletic. In terms of breeding systems the Malagasy Dombeyoideae are hermaphroditic, whereas those of the Mascarenes are considered dioecious. The polyphyly of the Mascarene Dombeyoideae suggests that dioecy has been acquired several times. At least five colonization events from Madagascar to the Mascarene archipelago were produced. The evolutionary history of two lineages of Mascarene Domeyoideae seems to be related to adaption to xeric habitats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/iapt/tax/2009/00000058/00000002/art00016 |title=ingentaconnect Systematics of Dombeyoideae (Malvaceae) in the Mascarene archipel |publisher=Ingentaconnect.com |date=2009-05-01 |accessdate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fauna==
[[File:Hoefnagel dodo.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The [[dodo]] was a frugivore giant columbiforme of [[Mauritius]] Island where there are several [[Ocotea]] species. Painted by [[Jacob Hoefnagel]], c. 1602]]
Indeed, much of the Mascarenes' native fauna has become endangered or extinct since the human settlement of the islands in the 17th century. Settlers cleared most of the forests for agriculture and grazing, and introduced many exotic species, including [[pig]]s, [[rat]]s, [[cat]]s, [[monkey]]s, and [[mongoose]]s.{{citation needed|date = February 2017}}

Many of the Mascarene birds evolved into flightless forms; the most famous of which was the [[extinct]] flightless [[pigeon]], the [[dodo]] of Mauritius. As well as the dodo thirteen additional species of birds became extinct including the [[R√©union flightless ibis]], [[broad-billed parrot]], [[red rail]], [[Rodrigues rail]], [[Rodrigues solitaire]].&lt;ref name="internationaldovesociety1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationaldovesociety.com/MiscSpecies/RodriguesSolitaire.htm |title=Rodrigues Solitaire |publisher=Internationaldovesociety.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="internationaldovesociety1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beautyofbirds.com/rodriguessolitairepigeons.html |title=Rodrigues Solitaire |publisher=Beautyofbirds.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today sixteen endemic bird species survive on the islands.{{citation needed|date = February 2017}}

Contemporary sources state that the dodo used [[gizzard stones]]&lt;ref name="tripod1"/&gt; and could swallow [[ocotea]] fruits.&lt;ref name="tripod1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tmale.tripod.com/SeedDispersal/IntroPage.htm |title=Seed Dispersal in Australian Subtropical Rainforest |publisher=Tmale.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.potomitan.info/dodo/c32.php |title=Le Mus√©e Du Dodo - Dodo And Solitaires, Myths And Reality |publisher=Potomitan.info |date= |accessdate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seed distribution of at least some ''Ocotea'' species is performed by [[frugivore|frugivorous]] birds and there exist a few reports of "solitaires" from the Mascarenes without mention of which island these came from, and the term was also used for other [[species]] with "solitary" habits, such as the [[R√©union swamphen|R√©union blue swamphen]] and the [[R√©union sacred ibis]]. At one point it was even believed that R√©union was the home of not only a white dodo, but also a white solitaire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Mauritius, R√©union, and Rodrigues were also once each home to one or more species of [[giant tortoises]], now extinct, which comprised the genus ''[[Cylindraspis]]''. There are thirteen living endemic reptile species, including a number of species of day [[gecko]]es ([[genus]] ''[[Phelsuma]]'').{{citation needed|date = February 2017}}

The islands have no native [[mammal]]s, except for [[bat]]s such as the [[Mauritian flying fox]].

==Wildlife, threats and preservation==
Today Mauritius has one of the highest population densities in the world and on all of the islands, there has been a great loss of habitat and many of the surviving endemic species are still threatened with extinction with little protection. Less than 40 percent of R√©union is covered with natural vegetation, only about 5 percent of Mauritius, and almost none of Rodrigues. On R√©union, forest has been cleared for agriculture and then overtaken by introduced plants. Mauritius was largely converted to sugar cane, tea, and conifer plantations. On Rodrigues the damage has been done by shifting cultivation.

{{See also|History of Mauritius}}
The early colonial history of the islands, like that of the Caribbean, is a confusing story of takeovers between the rival Portuguese, Dutch, French and British colonizers, usually separate or in varying combinations, sometimes even with distant other colonies, e.g. in the [[East Indies]].

Around 1507, the explorer [[Diogo Fernandes Pereira]] discovered the island group. The area remained under nominal Portuguese rule until [[√âtienne de Flacourt]] arrived with a French naval squadron and took possession in 1649.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Islands in the southern Indian Ocean westward of Longitude 80 degrees east, including Madagascar |last=Moriarty |first=Cpt.

On 14 July 1767 this became a French crown colony, still under one governor general. From 3 February 1803 till 2 September 1810 the French colony of [[Indes-Orientales]], under a ''[[capitaine g√©n√©ral]]'' (captain-general), included R√©union and (nominally) the Seychelles.

===Mauritius===
{{unreferenced section|date = July 2014}}
[[Mauritius]] was formed 8‚Äì10 million years ago, and is geographically one of the oldest remaining islands in the group. It was discovered in the 10th century by the Arabs and was first named Dina Harobi, but the first permanent settlement was by the Dutch in 1638. It was seized in 1715 by France, who remained in control of it until the British took over in 1810. Mauritius gained independence in 1968.

===Rodrigues===
{{unreferenced section|date = July 2014}}
[[Rodrigues (island)|Rodrigues]] was formed at around the same time as Reunion. It was first discovered by the [[Arabs]] but named after Portuguese navigator [[Diogo Rodrigues]]. It was under Dutch control in 1601 and settled by the French in 1691. Britain took possession of Rodrigues in 1809. When Mauritius gained independence in 1968, Rodrigues was forcefully joined to it.{{discuss}} Rodrigues remains an autonomous region of Mauritius.{{citation needed|date = July 2014}}

===R√©union===
[[R√©union]] was discovered first by the Arabs then by the Portuguese, who named it Santa Apol√≥nia. It was then occupied by the French as part of Mauritius. It was first inhabited by French mutineers who arrived on the island between 1646 and 1669.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://documents.irevues.inist.fr/bitstream/handle/2042/14363/HERMES_2002_32-33_91.pdf?sequence=1|title=De Bourbon a la Reunion, L'Historie D'une Ile|publisher=Documents.irevues.inist.fr|language=fr|accessdate=2013-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was given its current name in 1793. From 1810 to 1815 it was held by the British, before being returned to France. R√©union became an overseas [[Departments of France|department]] of France in 1946.{{citation needed|date = July 2014}}

===Cargados Carajos===
[[Cargados Carajos]] is the remnant of one or more large volcanic islands which sank with the rising tides. Today it is administered by Mauritius.

===Saya de Malha===
[[Saya de Malha Bank]] is a large, [[submerged bank]]. Prehistorically it was a group of volcanic islands, and was joined to the [[Great Chagos Bank]] until continental drift pushed them apart.

===Soudan Banks===
[[Soudan Banks]] are a group of low-lying banks on the [[Mascarene Plateau]].

===Nazareth Bank===
[[Nazareth Bank]] is located just north of Cargados Carajos, and prehistorically they were a single geological feature. Today it is a large, shallow fishing bank.

===Hawkins Bank===
[[Hawkins Bank]] is located on the northernmost point of the [[Mascarene Plateau]].

'''Palaeogeography''' (or '''paleogeography''') is the study of historical [[geography]], generally physical [[landscape]]s. Palaeogeography can also include the study of human or cultural environments. When the focus is specifically on the study of  [[landform]]s, the term paleogeomorphology is sometimes used instead.

Paleogeography yields information that is crucial to scientific understanding in a variety of contexts. For example, paleogeographic analysis of [[sedimentary basins]] plays a key role in the field of [[petroleum geology]], because the ancient [[geomorphological]] environments of the [[Earth]]'s surface are preserved in the [[stratigraphy|stratigraphic]] record. Paleogeographers also study the [[Sedimentary depositional environment|sedimentary environment]] associated with [[fossils]] for clues to the [[evolution]]ary development of extinct species. And paleogeographic evidence contributed to the development of [[continental drift]] theory, and continues to inform current [[plate tectonics|plate tectonic]] theories, yielding information about the shape and latitudinal location of [[supercontinent]]s such as [[Pangaea]] and ancient oceans such as [[Panthalassa]], thus enabling the [[Plate reconstruction|reconstruction]] of prehistoric continents and oceans.

In the [[outline of physical science|physical sciences]], a '''phase''' is a region of space (a [[thermodynamic system]]), throughout which all physical properties of a material are essentially uniform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Modell|first=Michael|author2=Robert C. Reid|title=Thermodynamics and Its Applications |publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ |date=1974 |isbn=978-0-13-914861-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fermi2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Enrico Fermi|title=Thermodynamics|date=25 April 2012|publisher=Courier Corporation|isbn=978-0-486-13485-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|86}}&lt;ref name="Adkins1983"&gt;{{cite book|author=Clement John Adkins|title=Equilibrium Thermodynamics|date=14 July 1983|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-27456-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}} Examples of physical properties include [[density]], [[refractive index|index of refraction]], [[magnetization]] and chemical composition. A simple description is that a phase is a region of material that is chemically uniform, physically distinct, and (often) mechanically separable. In a system consisting of ice and water in a glass jar, the ice cubes are one phase, the water is a second phase, and the humid air is a third phase over the ice and water. The glass of the jar is another separate phase. (See {{section link|state of matter|Glass}})

The term ''phase'' is sometimes used as a synonym for [[state of matter]], but there can be several [[Miscibility|immiscible]] phases of the same state of matter. Also, the term ''phase'' is sometimes used to refer to a set of equilibrium states demarcated in terms of state variables such as pressure and temperature by a [[phase boundary]] on a [[phase diagram]]. Because phase boundaries relate to changes in the organization of matter, such as a change from liquid to solid or a more subtle change from one crystal structure to another, this latter usage is similar to the use of "phase" as a synonym for state of matter. However, the state of matter and phase diagram usages are not [[wikt:commensurate|commensurate]] with the formal definition given above and the intended meaning must be determined in part from the context in which the term is used.

[[Image:Argon ice 1.jpg|thumb|right|A small piece of rapidly melting [[argon]] ice shows the transition from solid to liquid.]]

== Types of phases ==
[[File:Steel pd.svg|thumb|left|350px|Iron-carbon [[phase diagram]], showing the conditions necessary to form different phases]]

Distinct phases may be described as different [[state of matter|states of matter]] such as [[gas]], [[liquid]], [[solid]], [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] or [[Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensate]]. Useful [[mesophase]]s between solid and liquid form other states of matter.

Distinct phases may also exist within a given state of matter. As shown in the diagram for iron alloys, several phases exist for both the solid and liquid states. Phases may also be differentiated based on [[solubility]] as in polar (hydrophilic) or non-polar (hydrophobic). A mixture of water (a polar liquid) and oil (a non-polar liquid) will spontaneously separate into two phases. Water has a very low [[solubility]] (is insoluble) in oil, and oil has a low solubility in water. Solubility is the maximum amount of a solute that can dissolve in a solvent before the solute ceases to dissolve and remains in a separate phase. A mixture can separate into more than two liquid phases and the concept of phase separation extends to solids, i.e., solids can form [[solid solution]]s or crystallize into distinct crystal phases. Metal pairs that are mutually soluble can form [[alloy]]s, whereas metal pairs that are mutually insoluble cannot.

As many as [[multiphasic liquid|eight immiscible liquid phases]] have been observed.{{efn|One such system is, from the top: [[mineral oil]], [[silicone oil]], [[water]], [[aniline]], [[perfluoro(dimethylcyclohexane)]], [[white phosphorus]], [[gallium]], and [[mercury (element)|mercury]]. The system remains indefinitely separated at {{val|45|u=¬∞C}}, where gallium and phosphorus are in the molten state. From {{cite book

 |isbn=978-3-527-60567-5
}}}} Mutually immiscible liquid phases are formed from water (aqueous phase), hydrophobic organic solvents, perfluorocarbons ([[organofluorine chemistry#Fluorous phases|fluorous phase]]), silicones, several different metals, and also from molten phosphorus. Not all organic solvents are completely miscible, e.g. a mixture of [[ethylene glycol]] and [[toluene]] may separate into two distinct organic phases.{{efn|This phenomenon can be used to help with catalyst recycling in [[Heck reaction|Heck vinylation]]. See {{cite journal

}}}}

Phases do not need to macroscopically separate spontaneously. [[Emulsion]]s and [[colloid]]s are examples of immiscible phase pair combinations that do not physically separate.

==Phase equilibrium==
Left to equilibration, many compositions will form a uniform single phase, but depending on the temperature and pressure even a single substance may separate into two or more distinct phases. Within each phase, the properties are uniform but between the two phases properties differ.

Water in a closed jar with an air space over it forms a two phase system. Most of the water is in the liquid phase, where it is held by the mutual attraction of water molecules. Even at equilibrium molecules are constantly in motion and, once in a while, a molecule in the liquid phase gains enough kinetic energy to break away from the liquid phase and enter the gas phase. Likewise, every once in a while a vapor molecule collides with the liquid surface and condenses into the liquid. At equilibrium, evaporation and condensation processes exactly balance and there is no net change in the volume of either phase.

At room temperature and pressure, the water jar reaches equilibrium when the air over the water has a humidity of about 3%. This percentage increases as the temperature goes up. At 100&amp;nbsp;¬∞C and atmospheric pressure, equilibrium is not reached until the air is 100% water. If the liquid is heated a little over 100&amp;nbsp;¬∞C, the transition from liquid to gas will occur not only at the surface, but throughout the liquid volume: the water boils.

==Number of phases==
{{see also|Multiphasic liquid}}
[[Image:phase-diag2.svg|thumb|right|280px|A typical phase diagram for a single-component material, exhibiting solid, liquid and gaseous phases. The solid green line shows the usual shape of the liquid‚Äìsolid phase line. The dotted green line shows the anomalous behavior of water when the pressure increases. The [[triple point]] and the [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]] are shown as red dots.]]

For a given composition, only certain phases are possible at a given [[temperature]] and pressure. The number and type of phases that will form is hard to predict and is usually determined by experiment. The results of such experiments can be plotted in [[phase diagram]]s.

The phase diagram shown here is for a single component system. In this simple system, which phases that are possible depends only on [[pressure]] and [[temperature]]. The markings show points where two or more phases can co-exist in equilibrium. At temperatures and pressures away from the markings, there will be only one phase at equilibrium.

In the diagram, the blue line marking the boundary between liquid and gas does not continue indefinitely, but terminates at a point called the [[critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]]. As the temperature and pressure approach the critical point, the properties of the liquid and gas become progressively more similar. At the critical point, the liquid and gas become indistinguishable. Above the critical point, there are no longer separate liquid and gas phases: there is only a generic fluid phase referred to as a [[supercritical fluid]]. In water, the critical point occurs at around 647 [[Kelvin|K]] (374&amp;nbsp;¬∞C or 705&amp;nbsp;¬∞F) and 22.064 [[Pascal (pressure)|MPa]].

An unusual feature of the water phase diagram is that the solid‚Äìliquid phase line (illustrated by the dotted green line) has a negative slope. For most substances, the slope is positive as exemplified by the dark green line. This unusual feature of water is related to ice having a lower density than liquid water. Increasing the pressure drives the water into the higher density phase, which causes melting.

Another interesting though not unusual feature of the phase diagram is the point where the solid‚Äìliquid phase line meets the liquid‚Äìgas phase line. The intersection is referred to as the [[triple point]]. At the triple point, all three phases can coexist.

Experimentally, the phase lines are relatively easy to map due to the interdependence of temperature and pressure that develops when multiple phases forms. See [[Gibbs' phase rule]]. Consider a test apparatus consisting of a closed and well insulated cylinder equipped with a piston. By charging the right amount of water and applying heat, the system can be brought to any point in the gas region of the phase diagram. If the piston is slowly lowered, the system will trace a curve of increasing temperature and pressure within the gas region of the phase diagram. At the point where gas begins to condense to liquid, the direction of the temperature and pressure curve will abruptly change to trace along the phase line until all of the water has condensed.

==Interfacial phenomena==
{{further|Surface science}}
Between two phases in equilibrium there is a narrow region where the properties are not that of either phase. Although this region may be very thin, it can have significant and easily observable effects, such as causing a liquid to exhibit [[surface tension]]. In mixtures, some components may preferentially move toward the interface. In terms of modeling, describing, or understanding the behavior of a particular system, it may be efficacious to treat the interfacial region as a separate phase.

==Crystal phases==

A single material may have several distinct solid states capable of forming separate phases. Water is a well-known example of such a material. For example, water [[ice]] is ordinarily found in the hexagonal form [[ice Ih|ice I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;]], but can also exist as the cubic [[ice Ic|ice I&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;]], the [[rhombohedral crystal system|rhombohedral]] [[ice II]], and many other forms. [[Polymorphism (materials science)|Polymorphism]] is the ability of a solid to exist in more than one crystal form. For pure chemical elements, polymorphism is known as [[allotropy]]. For example, [[diamond]], [[graphite]], and [[fullerene]]s are different allotropes of [[carbon]].

==Phase transitions==
{{main|Phase transition}}
When a substance undergoes a phase transition (changes from one [[state of matter]] to another) it usually either takes up or releases energy. For example, when water evaporates, the increase in kinetic energy as the evaporating molecules escape the attractive forces of the liquid is reflected in a decrease in temperature. The energy required to induce the phase transition is taken from the internal thermal energy of the water, which cools the liquid to a lower temperature; hence evaporation is useful for cooling. See [[Enthalpy of vaporization]]. The reverse process, condensation, releases heat. The heat energy, or enthalpy, associated with a solid to liquid transition is the [[enthalpy of fusion]] and that associated with a solid to gas transition is the [[enthalpy of sublimation]].

&lt;br /&gt;

== Phases out of equilibrium ==
While phases of matter are traditionally defined for systems in thermal equilibrium, work on quantum [[Many body localization|many-body localized]] (MBL) systems has provided a framework for defining phases out of equilibrium. MBL phases never reach thermal equilibrium, and can allow for new forms of order disallowed in equilibrium via a phenomenon known as [[localization protected quantum order.]] The transitions between different MBL phases and between MBL and thermalizing phases are novel dynamical phase transitions whose properties are active areas of research.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3342">A '''photometric redshift''' is an estimate for the recession velocity of an astronomical object, such as a [[galaxy]] or [[quasar]], without measuring its spectrum.  The technique uses [[photometry (astronomy)|photometry]] (that is, the brightness of the object viewed through various standard [[filter (optics)|filters]], each of which lets through a relatively broad [[passband]] of colours, such as red light, green light, or blue light) to determine the [[redshift]], and hence, through [[Hubble's law]], the distance, of the observed object. The technique relies upon the spectrum of radiation being emitted by the object having strong features that can be detected by the relatively crude filters.

The technique was developed in the 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;The technique was first described by Baum, W. A.: 1962, in G. C. McVittie (ed.), ''Problems of extra-galactic research'', p. 390, IAU Symposium No. 15&lt;/ref&gt; but was largely replaced in the 1970s and 1980s by [[spectroscopic redshift]]s, using [[spectroscopy]] to observe the [[frequency]] (or [[wavelength]]) of characteristic [[spectral line]]s, and measure the shift of these lines from their laboratory positions.  The photometric redshift technique has come back into mainstream use since 2000, as a result of large sky surveys conducted in the late 1990s and 2000s which have detected a large number of faint high-redshift objects, and telescope time limitations mean that only a small fraction of these can be observed by spectroscopy. 

Photometric redshifts were originally determined by calculating the expected observed data from a known emission spectrum at a range of redshifts.  In recent years, [[Bayesian method|Bayesian]] statistical methods and [[artificial neural network]]s have been used to estimate redshifts from photometric data.

As photometric filters are sensitive to a range of wavelengths, and the technique relies on making many assumptions about the nature of the spectrum at the light-source, [[Observational error|errors]] for these sorts of measurements can range up to Œ¥''z'' = 0.5, and are much less reliable than spectroscopic determinations.&lt;ref&gt;Bolzonella, M.; Miralles, J.-M.; Pell√≥, R., [https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0003380 Photometric redshifts based on standard SED fitting procedures], ''[[Astronomy and Astrophysics]]'', '''363''', p.476-492 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of sufficient [[telescope time]] to determine a spectroscopic redshift for each object, the technique of photometric redshifts provides a method to determine an at least qualitative characterization of a redshift.

For example, if a Sun-like spectrum had a redshift of ''z'' = 1, it would be brightest in the [[infrared]] rather than at the yellow-green color associated with the peak of its [[blackbody spectrum]], and the light intensity will be reduced in the filter by a factor of two (i.e. 1+''z'') (see [[K correction]] for more details on the photometric consequences of redshift).&lt;ref&gt;A pedagogical overview of the K-correction by David Hogg and other members of the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey|SDSS]] collaboration can be found at [https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0210394 astro-ph].&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Royal Museum for Central Africa''' or RMCA ({{lang-nl|Koninklijk Museum voor Midden-Afrika}} or KMMA; {{lang-fr|Mus√©e royal de l'Afrique centrale}} or MRAC), colloquially known as the '''Africa Museum''', is an [[ethnography]] and [[natural history]] museum situated in [[Tervuren]] in [[Flemish Brabant]], [[Belgium]], just outside [[Brussels]]. It was first built to showcase [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold II's]] [[Congo Free State]] in the [[Brussels International (1897)|1897 World Exhibition]].

The museum focuses on the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], a former [[Belgian Congo|Belgian colony]]. The sphere of interest however (especially in biological research) extends to the whole [[Congo River basin]], [[Middle Africa]], [[East Africa]] and [[West Africa]], attempting to integrate "[[Africa]]" as a whole. Intended originally as a colonial museum, from 1960 onwards it has more focused on [[ethnography]] and [[anthropology]]. Like most museums, it houses a research department in addition to its public exhibit department.

Not all research pertains to Africa (e.g. research on the [[archaeozoology]] of [[Sagalassos]], [[Turkey]]). Some researchers have strong ties with the [[Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences]].

As of November 2013, the museum is closed for renovation work (including the construction of new exhibition space) which is expected to last until December 2018 when the museum will reopen.&lt;ref name=refurb&gt;{{cite web|title=During the renovation|url=http://www.africamuseum.be/renovation/|publisher=Africamuseum.be|accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Mus√©e du Congo, Tervuren, Belgium; one of five interior scen Wellcome V0014542.jpg|thumb|left|The interior of the original exhibit in the ''Palais des Colonies'']]
[[File:Royal Museum for Central Africa Interior 1.jpg|{{largethumb}}|The interior of the museum, photographed in 2011, shortly before the museum's major renovation]]

After his [[Congo Free State]] was recognized by the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1884‚Äì1885, [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold II]] wanted to publicise the [[civilizing mission]] and the economic opportunities available in the colony to a wider public, both in Belgium and internationally. After considering other places, the king decided to have a temporary&lt;ref name = Independent2013/&gt; exhibition in his royal estate at Tervuren. When the [[Brussels International (1897)|1897 International Exposition]] was held in [[Brussels]], a colonial section was built in Tervuren, connected to the city centre by the monumental [[Avenue de Tervueren]]. The Brussels-Tervuren [[Brussels tram route 44|tram line 44]] was built at the same time as the original museum by King Leopold II to bring the visitors from the city centre to the colonial exhibition. The colonial section was hosted in the {{illm|Palais des Colonies|fr}} (Palace of the Colonies). The building was designed by the Belgian architect [[Albert-Philippe Aldophe]] and the classical gardens by French landscape architect [[Elie Lain√©]]. In the main hall [[Georges Hob√©]] designed a distinctive wooden ''[[Art Nouveau]]'' structure to evoke the forest, using [[Bilinga (wood)|Bilinga wood]], an African tree. The exhibition displayed ethnographic objects, stuffed animals and Congolese export products (coffee, cacao and tobacco). In the park, a temporary "[[Human zoo]]" - a copy of an African village - was built, in which 60 Congolese people lived for the duration of the exhibition. The exposition was a huge success.

[[File:TervurenMuseum2016.jpg|{{largethumb}}|The museum during the renovation (2016)]]
In 1898 the Palace of the Colonies became the Museum of the Congo (''Mus√©e du Congo'') and a permanent exhibition was installed. A decade later, in 1912, a small, similar museum - the {{illm|Mus√©e africain de Namur|fr}} (African Museum of Namur) - was opened in [[Namur (city)|Namur]]. The Museum began to support academic research, but due to the avid collecting of the scientists, the collection soon grew too large for the museum and enlargement was needed. Tervuren became a rich suburb of Brussels. The new museum started construction in 1904 and was designed by the French architect [[Charles Girault]] in [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]] "palace" architecture, reminiscent of ''[[Petit Palais]]'' in [[Paris]], with large gardens extending into the Tervuren Forest (a part of the [[Sonian Forest]]). It was officially opened by [[Albert I of Belgium|King Albert I]] in 1910 and named the Museum of the Belgian Congo (''Mus√©e du Congo Belge'' or ''Museum van Belgisch-Kongo''). In 1952 the adjective "Royal" was added. In preparation for [[Expo '58]], in 1957 a large building was constructed to accommodate African personnel working in the exhibition: the ''Centre d'Accueil du Personnel Africain'' (CAPA). In 1960, following the independence of the Congo, the museum's name was changed to its current title: the Royal Museum for Central Africa.

In late 2013 the museum was closed to allow a major renovation of its exhibits and an extension. Its reopening is planned for December 2018.&lt;ref name = Independent2013/&gt; 66 million euros has been spent on the modernization by the Belgian government. The additional space created will allow contemporary art from Central Africa to be displayed alongside the original colonial exhibits.&lt;ref&gt;https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-belgium-museum-africa/king-leopolds-ghost-belgiums-africa-museum-to-reopen-idUKKCN1IX540&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
[[File:Museum central Africa monument Luc Viatour.jpg|Monument in the park.|right|thumb|250px]]
There has been controversy surrounding the Museum. It had been called a museum that "has remained frozen in time"&lt;ref name = Independent2013/&gt; as it showed how a museum looked like in the mid-twentieth century. No mention was made of the savage excesses and pillage during Belgium's colonial era.&lt;ref name = Independent2013/&gt; 

''[[The Guardian]]'' reported in July 2002 that, after initial outrage by Belgian historians over ''[[King Leopold's Ghost]]'' by [[Adam Hochschild]], the state-funded museum would finance an investigation into Hochschild's allegations. The resulting more modern exhibition "The Memory of Congo" (February‚ÄìOctober 2005), tried  to tell the story of the Congo Free State before it became a Belgian colony and a less one-sided view of the Belgian colonial era.&lt;ref name = Independent2013&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/belgian-museum-faces-up-to-its-brutal-colonial-legacy-8973870.html|title=Belgian museum faces up to its brutal colonial legacy|last=McDonald-Gibson|first=Charlotte|date=2013-11-29|website=The Independent|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition was praised by the international press, with French newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'' claiming that "the museum has done better than revisit a particularly stormy page in history...[it] has pushed the public to join it in looking into the reality of colonialism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=La Belgique confront√©e √† la violence de son aventure coloniale au Congo|newspaper=[[Le Monde]]|date=26 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Second Industrial Revolution''', also known as the '''Technological Revolution''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Muntone|first=Stephanie|title=Second Industrial Revolution|url=http://www.education.com/study-help/article/us-history-glided-age-technological-revolution/|work=Education.com|publisher=The McGraw-Hill Companies|accessdate=14 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022224325/http://www.education.com/study-help/article/us-history-glided-age-technological-revolution/|archivedate=22 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a phase of rapid [[industrialization]] in the final third of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th. The [[First Industrial Revolution]], which ended in the early to mid 1800s, was punctuated by a slowdown in macroinventions{{clarify|date=January 2018}} before the Second Industrial Revolution in 1870. Though a number of its characteristic events can be traced to earlier innovations in [[manufacturing]], such as the establishment of a [[machine tool]] industry, the development of methods for manufacturing [[interchangeable parts]] and the invention of the [[Bessemer Process]] to produce [[steel]], the Second Industrial Revolution is generally dated between 1870 and 1914 (the start of [[World War I]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ushistoryscene.com/article/second-industrial-revolution/ The Second Industrial Revolution: 1870-1914]&lt;/ref&gt;

Advancements in manufacturing and production technology enabled the widespread adoption of preexisting technological systems such as [[electrical telegraph|telegraph]] and [[railroad]] networks, gas and [[water supply]], and [[sewage systems]], which had earlier been concentrated to a few select cities. The enormous expansion of rail and telegraph lines after 1870 allowed unprecedented movement of people and ideas, which culminated in a new wave of [[globalization]]. In the same time period, new technological systems were introduced, most significantly [[electrical power]] and [[telephone]]s. The Second Industrial Revolution continued into the 20th century with early factory [[electrification]] and the [[production line]], and ended at the start of [[World War I]].

==Overview==
The Second Industrial Revolution was a period of rapid industrial development, primarily in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Germany]] and the [[United States]], but also in [[France]], the [[Low Countries]], [[Italy]] and [[Japan]]. It followed on from the [[First Industrial Revolution]] that began in Britain in the late 18th century that then spread throughout Western Europe and North America. It was characterized by the build out of [[railroad]]s, large-scale iron and [[steel]] production, widespread use of [[machinery]] in manufacturing, greatly increased use of steam power, widespread use of the [[electrical telegraph|telegraph]], use of [[petroleum]] and the beginning of [[electrification]].  It also was the period during which modern organizational methods for operating large scale businesses over vast areas came into use.

The concept was introduced by [[Patrick Geddes]], ''[[Patrick Geddes#Published works|Cities in Evolution]]'' (1910), but [[David Landes]]' use of the term in a 1966 essay and in ''[[The Unbound Prometheus]]'' (1972) standardized scholarly definitions of the term, which was most intensely promoted by [[Alfred D. Chandler, Jr.|Alfred Chandler]] (1918‚Äì2007). However, some continue to express reservations about its use.&lt;ref&gt;James Hull, "The Second Industrial Revolution: The History of a Concept", ''Storia Della Storiografia,'' 1999, Issue 36, pp 81‚Äì90&lt;/ref&gt;

Landes (2003) stresses the importance of new technologies, especially, the [[internal combustion engine]] and petroleum, new materials and substances, including alloys and [[Chemical industry|chemicals]], electricity and communication technologies (such as the [[telegraph]], telephone and [[radio]]).

Vaclav Smil called the period 1867‚Äì1914 "The Age of [[Synergy]]" during which most of the great innovations were developed since the inventions and innovations were engineering and [[Applied science|science-based]].&lt;ref name ="Smil2005"&gt;{{cite book |title=Creating the Twentieth Century: Technical Innovations of 1867‚Äì1914 and Their Lasting Impact |last=Smil |first=Vaclav |authorlink=Vaclav Smil  |year=2005 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford; New York |isbn=0-19-516874-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Industry and technology ==
A synergy between iron and steel, railroads and coal developed at the beginning of the Second Industrial Revolution.  Railroads allowed cheap transportation of materials and products, which in turn led to cheap rails to build more roads.  Railroads also benefited from cheap coal for their steam locomotives.  This synergy led to the laying of 75,000 miles of track in the U.S. in the 1880s, the largest amount anywhere in world history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chandler|1993|pp=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Iron ===
The [[hot blast]] technique, in which the hot [[flue gas]] from a blast furnace is used to [[air preheater|preheat]] combustion air blown into a [[blast furnace]], was invented and patented by [[James Beaumont Neilson]] in 1828 at [[Wilsontown Ironworks]] in Scotland. Hot blast was the single most important advance in fuel efficiency of the blast furnace as it greatly reduced the fuel consumption for making pig iron, and was one of the most important technologies developed during the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Unbound Prometheus: Technological Change and Industrial Development in Western Europe from 1750 to the Present|last=Landes|first=David.  S.|authorlink=David Landes|year=1969|publisher=Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge|location=Cambridge, New York|isbn=0-521-09418-6|pages=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Falling costs for producing [[wrought iron]] coincided with the emergence of the [[railway]] in the 1830s.

The early technique of hot blast used iron for the regenerative heating medium.  Iron caused problems with expansion and contraction, which stressed the iron and caused failure. [[Edward Alfred Cowper]] developed the Cowper stove in 1857.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Landes|year-1969|pp=256‚Äì7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This stove used firebrick as a storage medium, solving the expansion and cracking problem.  The Cowper stove was also capable of producing high heat, which resulted in very high throughput of blast furnaces.  The Cowper stove is still used in today's blast furnaces.

With the greatly reduced cost of producing pig iron with [[coke (fuel)|coke]] using hot blast, demand grew dramatically and so did the size of blast furnaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Landes|year-1969|pp=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

=== Steel ===
[[File:ConverterB.jpg|thumb|300px|A diagram of the [[Bessemer converter]]. Air blown through holes in the converter bottom creates a violent reaction in the molten pig iron that oxidizes the excess carbon, converting the pig iron to pure iron or steel, depending on the residual carbon.]]

The [[Bessemer process]], invented by [[Sir Henry Bessemer]], allowed the [[mass-production]] of [[steel]], increasing the scale and speed of production of this vital material, and decreasing the labor requirements. The key principle was the removal of excess carbon and other impurities from [[pig iron]] by [[oxidation]] with air blown through the molten iron. The oxidation also raises the temperature of the iron mass and keeps it molten.

The "acid" Bessemer process had a serious limitation in that it required relatively scarce [[hematite]] ore&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Landes|year-1969|pp=228}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is low in phosphorus. [[Sidney Gilchrist Thomas]] developed a more sophisticated process to eliminate the [[phosphorus]] from [[iron]]. Collaborating with his cousin, [[Percy Gilchrist]] a chemist at the [[Blaenavon Ironworks]], [[Wales]], he patented his process in 1878;&lt;ref&gt;[http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s-THOM-GIL-1850.html ''Thomas, Sidney Gilchrist'' at Welsh Biography Online]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bolckow Vaughan]] &amp; Co. in [[Yorkshire]] was the first company to use his patented process.&lt;ref name=EB-Thom&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Thomas, Sidney Gilchrist |volume=26 |page=867}}&lt;/ref&gt; His process was especially valuable on the continent of Europe, where the proportion of phosphoric iron was much greater than in England, and both in Belgium and in Germany the name of the inventor became more widely known than in his own country. In America, although non-phosphoric iron largely predominated, an immense interest was taken in the invention.&lt;ref name=EB-Thom/&gt;

[[File:Barrow Steelworks.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Barrow Hematite Steel Company]] operated 18 Bessemer converters and owned the largest steelworks in the world at the turn of the 20th century.]]

The next great advance in steel making was the [[Siemens-Martin process]]. Sir [[Charles William Siemens]] developed his regenerative furnace in the 1850s, for which he claimed in 1857 to able to recover enough heat to save 70‚Äì80% of the fuel. The furnace operated at a high temperature by using [[Air preheater|regenerative preheating]] of fuel and air for [[combustion]]. Through this method, an open-hearth furnace can reach temperatures high enough to melt steel, but Siemens did not initially use it in that manner.

French engineer [[Pierre-√âmile Martin]] was the first to take out a license for the Siemens furnace and apply it to the production of steel in 1865. The Siemens-Martin process complemented rather than replaced the [[Bessemer process]].  Its main advantages were that it did not expose the steel to excessive nitrogen (which would cause the steel to become brittle), it was easier to control, and that it permitted the melting and refining of large amounts of scrap steel, lowering steel production costs and recycling an otherwise troublesome waste material. It became the leading steel making process by the early 20th century.

The availability of cheap steel allowed building larger bridges, railroads, [[skyscraper]]s, and ships.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Birch, ''Economic History of the British Iron and Steel Industry'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Other important steel products‚Äîalso made using the open hearth process‚Äîwere [[steel cable]], steel rod and sheet steel which enabled large, high-pressure boilers and high-tensile strength steel for machinery which enabled much more powerful engines, gears and axles than were previously possible. With large amounts of steel it became possible to build much more powerful guns and carriages, tanks, [[armored fighting vehicle]]s and naval ships.

=== Rail ===
[[File:The rail rolling mill, Hughesovka.jpg|thumb|300px|A rail rolling mill in [[Donetsk]], 1887.]]
The increase in steel production from the 1860s meant that [[railroad]]s could finally be made from steel at a competitive cost. Being a much more durable material, steel steadily replaced iron as the standard for railway rail, and due to its greater strength, longer lengths of rails could now be rolled. [[Wrought iron]] was soft and contained flaws caused by included [[dross]].  Iron rails could also not support heavy locomotives and was damaged by [[hammer blow]]. The first to make durable [[rail profile|rails]] of steel rather than [[wrought iron]] was [[Robert Forester Mushet]] at the [[Darkhill Ironworks]], [[Gloucestershire]] in 1857.

The first of his steel rails was sent to [[Derby Midland railway station]].  They were laid at part of the station approach where the iron rails had to be renewed at least every six months, and occasionally every three. Six years later, in 1863, the rail seemed as perfect as ever, although some 700 trains had passed over it daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rolt |first1=L.T.C |title=Victorian Engineering |year=1974 |origyear= |publisher=Pelican |location=London |isbn=  |page=183 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This provided the basis for the accelerated construction of [[railways|rail transportation]] throughout the world in the late nineteenth century.  Steel rails lasted over ten times longer than did iron,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Railroads and American Economic Growth: Essays in Econometric History |last=Fogel |first=Robert W.|authorlink= |year=1964 |publisher=The Johns Hopkins Press |location=Baltimore and London |isbn= 0801811481 |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and with the falling cost of steel, heavier weight rails were used.  This allowed the use of more powerful locomotives, which could pull longer trains, and longer rail cars, all of which greatly increased the productivity of railroads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Inside the Black Box: Technology and Economics|last= Rosenberg|first=Nathan|authorlink=|year=1982|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, New York|isbn=0-521-27367-6|pages=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rail became the dominant form of transport infrastructure throughout the industrialized world,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Grubler|first1=Arnulf|author1-link=|title=The Rise and Fall of Infrastructures|year=1990|url=http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Admin/PUB/Documents/XB-90-704.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; producing a steady decrease in the cost of shipping seen for the rest of the century.&lt;ref name ="Fogel1964"&gt;{{cite book |title=Railroads and American Economic Growth: Essays in Econometric History |last=Fogel |first=Robert W.|authorlink= |year=1964 |publisher=The Johns Hopkins Press |location=Baltimore and London |isbn= 0-8018-1148-1 |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electrification ===
{{Main|Electrification|Electricity}}
The theoretical and practical basis for the harnessing of electric power was laid by the scientist and experimentalist [[Michael Faraday]]. Through his research on the [[electromagnetic field|magnetic field]] around a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] carrying a [[direct current]], Faraday established the basis for the concept of the electromagnetic field in physics.&lt;ref name="EncBrit"&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Faraday, Michael |volume=10 |page=173 |first=James Clerk |last=Maxwell |authorlink=James Clerk Maxwell}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IEEUK"&gt;[http://www.theiet.org/about/libarc/archives/biographies/faraday.cfm "Archives Biographies: Michael Faraday", The Institution of Engineering and Technology.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929004417/http://www.theiet.org/about/libarc/archives/biographies/faraday.cfm |date=September 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[invention]]s of [[electric motor|electromagnetic rotary devices]] were the foundation of the practical use of electricity in technology.

In 1881, [[Sir Joseph Swan]], inventor of the first feasible [[incandescent light bulb]], supplied about 1,200 Swan incandescent lamps to the [[Savoy Theatre]] in the City of Westminster, London, which was the first theatre, and the first public building in the world, to be lit entirely by electricity.&lt;ref&gt;"The Savoy Theatre", ''[[The Times]]'', October 3, 1881&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TRE&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/carte/savoy/electric.html Description of lightbulb experiment] in ''The Times'', December 29, 1881&lt;/ref&gt; Swan's lightbulb had already been used in 1879 to light Mosley Street, in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], the first electrical street lighting installation in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.frognet.net/~ejcov/jwswan.html|title=Sir Joseph Wilson Swan|publisher=home.frognet.net|accessdate=16 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510005841/http://home.frognet.net/~ejcov/jwswan.html|archivedate=10 May 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rsc.org/Chemsoc/Activities/ChemicalLandmarks/UK/JosephSwan.asp |title=Sir Joseph Swan, The Literary &amp; Philosophical Society of Newcastle |date=3 February 2009 |publisher=rsc.org |accessdate=16 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This set the stage for the electrification of industry and the home.

The first modern power station in the world was built by the English [[electrical engineer]] [[Sebastian de Ferranti]] at [[Deptford]]. Built on an unprecedented scale and pioneering the use of high voltage (10,000V) [[alternating current]], it generated 800 kilowatts and supplied central London. On its completion in 1891 it supplied high-voltage [[AC power]] that was then "stepped down" with transformers for consumer use on each street. [[Electrification]] allowed the final major developments in manufacturing methods of the Second Industrial Revolution, namely the [[assembly line]] and [[mass production]].&lt;ref name ="Ford1922"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Ford|first1=Henry|author1-link=Henry Ford|author2=Crowther, Samuel |title=My Life and Work: An Autobiography of Henry Ford|year=1922|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=22786&amp;pageno=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Electrification]] was called "the most important engineering achievement of the 20th century" by the [[National Academy of Engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Century of Innovation: Twenty Engineering Achievements That Transformed Our Lives |last=Constable |first=George|authorlink= |author2=Somerville, Bob  |year=2003 |publisher=Joseph Henry Press|location=Washington, DC |isbn= 0-309-08908-5 |pages= |url=http://www.greatachievements.org/?id=2988 }} (Viewable on line)&lt;/ref&gt; Electric lighting in factories greatly improved working conditions, eliminating the heat and pollution caused by gas lighting, and reducing the fire hazard to the extent that the cost of electricity for lighting was often offset by the reduction in fire insurance premiums. [[Frank J. Sprague]] developed the first successful DC motor in 1886. By 1889 110 electric [[tram|street railways]] were either using his equipment or in planning.  The electric street railway became a major infrastructure before 1920.  The AC ([[Induction motor]]) was developed in the 1890s and soon began to be used in the [[electrification#History of electrification|electrification]] of industry.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book |title= Electrifying America: Social Meanings of a New Technology|last=Nye |first=David E.|authorlink=  |year=1990 |publisher= The MIT Press |isbn= |pages=14, 15 |url= |location= Cambridge, MA; London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Household electrification did not become common until the 1920s, and then only in cities. [[Fluorescent light]]ing was commercially introduced at the [[1939 World's Fair]].

Electrification also allowed the inexpensive production of [[Electrochemistry#19th century|electro-chemicals]], such as aluminium, chlorine, sodium hydroxide, and magnesium.&lt;ref name ="McNeil1990"&gt;{{cite book |title=An Encyclopedia of the History of Technology |last=McNeil |first=Ian|authorlink= |year=1990 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=0-415-14792-1 |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Machine tools ===
{{Main|Machine tool}}
[[File:JFIScrewThread300.png|thumb|A graphic representation of formulas for the pitches of threads of screw bolts.]]

The use of [[machine tool]]s began with the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution|First Industrial Revolution]]. The increase in [[mechanization]] required more metal parts, which were usually made of [[cast iron]] or [[wrought iron]]‚Äîand hand working lacked precision and was a slow and expensive process. One of the first machine tools was [[John Wilkinson (industrialist)|John Wilkinson]]'s boring machine, that bored a precise hole in [[James Watt]]'s first steam engine in 1774. Advances in the accuracy of machine tools can be traced to [[Henry Maudslay]] and refined by [[Joseph Whitworth]]. Standardization of screw threads began with [[Henry Maudslay]] around 1800, when the modern [[screw-cutting lathe]] made [[interchangeable parts|interchangeable]] V-thread machine screws a practical commodity.

In 1841, [[Joseph Whitworth]] created a design that, through its adoption by many British railroad companies, became the world's first national machine tool standard called [[British Standard Whitworth]].&lt;ref name="Roe1916pp9-10"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roe|1916}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=X-EJAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;f=false pp. 9‚Äì10.]&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1840s through 1860s, this standard was often used in the United States and Canada as well, in addition to myriad intra- and inter-company standards.

The importance of [[machine tools]] to mass production is shown by the fact that production of the [[Ford Model T]] used 32,000 machine tools, most of which were powered by electricity.&lt;ref name ="Hounshell1984"&gt;{{Hounshell1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Ford]] is quoted as saying that mass production would not have been possible without electricity because it allowed placement of machine tools and other equipment in the order of the work flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Edison as I Know Him |last=Ford |first=Henry |authorlink= |author2=Crowther, Samuel |year=1930 |publisher= Cosmopolitan Book Company |isbn= |pages=30 |url= |location= New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Paper making ===
{{Main|Paper machine}}
The first paper making machine was the [[Fourdrinier machine]], built by Sealy and [[Henry Fourdrinier]], stationers in [[London]]. In 1800, [[Matthias Koops]], working in London, investigated the idea of using wood to make paper, and began his printing business a year later. However, his enterprise was unsuccessful due to the prohibitive cost at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Carruthers, George. Paper in the Making. Toronto: The Garden City Press Co-Operative, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthew, H.C.G. and Brian Harrison. "Koops. Matthias." ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography: from the earliest times to the year 2000'', Vol. 32. London: Oxford University Press, 2004: 80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burger, Peter. Charles Fenerty and his Paper Invention. Toronto: Peter Burger, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-9783318-1-8}}. pp. 30‚Äì32.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in the 1840s,  that [[Charles Fenerty]] in [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Friedrich Gottlob Keller]] in [[Saxony]] both invented a successful machine which extracted the fibres from wood (as with rags) and from it, made paper. This started a new era for [[History of paper|paper making]],&lt;ref&gt;Burger, Peter. Charles Fenerty and his Paper Invention. Toronto: Peter Burger, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-9783318-1-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, together with the invention of the [[fountain pen]] and the mass-produced [[pencil]] of the same period, and in conjunction with the advent of the steam driven rotary [[printing press]], wood based paper caused a major transformation of the 19th century economy and society in industrialized countries. With the introduction of cheaper paper, schoolbooks, fiction, non-fiction, and newspapers became gradually available by 1900. Cheap wood based paper also allowed keeping personal diaries or writing letters and so, by 1850, the [[clerk (position)|clerk]], or writer, ceased to be a high-status job. By the 1880s chemical processes for paper manufacture were in use, becoming dominant by 1900.

=== Petroleum ===
The [[petroleum industry#History|petroleum industry]], both production and [[Petroleum refinery|refining]], began in 1848 with the first oil works in Scotland. The chemist [[James Young (Scottish chemist)|James Young]] set up a small business refining the crude oil in 1848. Young found that by slow distillation he could obtain a number of useful liquids from it, one of which he named "paraffine oil" because at low temperatures it congealed into a substance resembling paraffin wax.&lt;ref name=russell&gt;{{cite book | last = Russell | first = Loris S. | authorlink = | title = A Heritage of Light: Lamps and Lighting in the Early Canadian Home | publisher = University of Toronto Press | year = 2003 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-8020-3765-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1850 Young built the first truly commercial oil-works and oil refinery in the world at [[Bathgate]], using oil extracted from locally mined [[torbanite]], shale, and bituminous coal to manufacture [[naphtha]] and lubricating oils; paraffin for fuel use and solid paraffin were not sold till 1856.

[[Drilling rig#Cable tool drilling|Cable tool drilling]] was developed in ancient China and was used for drilling brine wells.  The salt domes also held natural gas, which some wells produced and which was used for evaporation of the brine.  Chinese well drilling technology was introduced to Europe in 1828.&lt;ref&gt;

Although there were many efforts in the mid-19th century to drill for oil [[Edwin Drake]]'s 1859 well near Titusville, Pennsylvania, is considered the first "modern oil well".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vArc08DO9ykC&amp;pg=PA13 M.

S.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Temple|1986|pp=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first primary product was kerosene for lamps and heaters.&lt;ref name ="McNeil1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name = Yergin&gt;{{cite book|title=The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money &amp; Power|last=Yergin|first=Daniel|authorlink=|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar developments around [[Petroleum industry in Azerbaijan|Baku]] fed the European market.

Kerosene lighting was much more efficient and less expensive than vegetable oils, tallow and whale oil.  Although town gas lighting was available in some cities, kerosene produced a brighter light until the invention of the [[gas mantle]]. Both were replaced by electricity for street lighting following the 1890s and for households during the 1920s. [[Gasoline]] was an unwanted byproduct of oil refining until automobiles were mass-produced after 1914, and gasoline shortages appeared during World War I. The invention of the [[Burton process]] for [[cracking (chemistry)|thermal cracking]] doubled the yield of gasoline, which helped alleviate the shortages.&lt;ref name = Yergin/&gt;

=== Chemical ===
[[File:BASF Werk Ludwigshafen 1881.JPG|thumb|The [[BASF]]-chemical factories in [[Ludwigshafen]], Germany, 1881]]
[[Synthetic dye]] was discovered by English chemist [[William Henry Perkin]] in 1856. At the time, chemistry was still in a quite primitive state; it was still a difficult proposition to determine the arrangement of the elements in compounds and chemical industry was still in its infancy. Perkin's accidental discovery was that [[aniline]] could be partly transformed into a crude mixture which when extracted with alcohol produced a substance with an intense purple colour. He scaled up production of the new "[[mauveine]]", and commercialized it as the world's first synthetic dye.&lt;ref name="chemistry.msu.edu"&gt;Michigan State University, Department of Chemistry website.{{cite web |url=http://www.chemistry.msu.edu/Portraits/PortraitsHH_Detail.asp?HH_LName=Perkin |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030202902/http://www.chemistry.msu.edu/Portraits/PortraitsHH_Detail.asp?HH_LName=Perkin |archivedate=2007-10-30 |df= }} Accessed 18 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the discovery of mauveine, many new [[aniline dye]]s appeared (some discovered by Perkin himself), and factories producing them were constructed across Europe.
Towards the end of the century, Perkin and other British companies found their research and development efforts increasingly eclipsed by the German chemical industry which became world dominant by 1914.

=== Maritime technology ===
[[File:Launch-of-the-SS-GB.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The launch of [[SS Great Britain|''Great Britain'']], which was advanced for her time, 1843.|alt=A crowd of people watch a large black and red ship with one funnel and six masts adorned with flags]]
This era saw the birth of the modern ship as disparate technological advances came together.

The [[propeller (marine)|screw propeller]] was introduced in 1835 by [[Francis Pettit Smith]] who discovered a new way of building propellers by accident. Up to that time, propellers were literally screws, of considerable length. But during the testing of a boat propelled by one, the screw snapped off, leaving a fragment shaped much like a modern boat propeller. The boat moved faster with the broken propeller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boatbuilding.com/article.php/designofpropellers1 |title=History and Design of Propellers: Part 1 |publisher=the boatbuilding.community |accessdate=2007-09-03 |date=2004-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070811200813/http://www.boatbuilding.com/article.php/designofpropellers1 |archivedate=2007-08-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The superiority of screw against paddles was taken up by navies. Trials with Smith's [[SS Archimedes|SS ''Archimedes'']], the first steam driven screw, led to the famous tug-of-war competition in 1845 between the screw-driven {{HMS|Rattler|1843|6}} and the paddle steamer {{HMS|Alecto|1839|6}}; the former pulling the latter backward at 2.5 knots (4.6&amp;nbsp;km/h).

The first seagoing iron steamboat was built by [[Horseley Ironworks]] and named the ''[[Aaron Manby]]''. It also used an innovative oscillating engine for power. The boat was built at Tipton using temporary bolts, disassembled for transportation to London, and reassembled on the Thames in 1822, this time using permanent rivets.

Other technological developments followed, including the invention of the [[surface condenser]], which allowed boilers to run on purified water rather than salt water, eliminating the need to stop to clean them on long sea journeys. The ''[[SS Great Western|Great Western]]''&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan (2006), pp. 57‚Äì59&lt;/ref&gt;
,&lt;ref name="Beckett 2006, pp. 171‚Äì173"&gt;Beckett (2006), pp. 171‚Äì173&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dumpleton and Miller (2002), pp. 34‚Äì46&lt;/ref&gt; built by engineer [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]], was the longest ship in the world at {{convert|236|ft|m|abbr=on}} with a {{convert|250|ft|m|adj=on}} [[keel]] and was the first to prove that transatlantic steamship services were viable. The ship was constructed mainly from wood, but Brunel added bolts and iron diagonal reinforcements to maintain the keel's strength. In addition to its steam-powered [[paddle wheel]]s, the ship carried four masts for sails.

Brunel followed this up with the [[SS Great Britain|''Great Britain'']], launched in 1843 and considered the first modern ship built of metal rather than wood, powered by an engine rather than wind or oars, and driven by propeller rather than paddle wheel.&lt;ref&gt;Lienhard, John H (2003). ''The Engines of Our Ingenuity''. [[Oxford University Press]] (US). {{ISBN|978-0-19-516731-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Brunel's vision and engineering innovations made the building of large-scale, propeller-driven, all-metal steamships a practical reality, but the prevailing economic and industrial conditions meant that it would be several decades before transoceanic steamship travel emerged as a viable industry.

Highly efficient [[Steam engine#Multiple expansion engines|multiple expansion steam engines]] began being used on ships, allowing them to carry less coal than freight.&lt;ref name="Wells1890"/&gt; [[Marine steam engine#Oscillating|The oscillating engine]] was first built by [[Aaron Manby (ironmaster)|Aaron Manby]] and Joseph Maudslay in the 1820s as a type of direct-acting engine that was designed to achieve further reductions in engine size and weight. Oscillating engines had the piston rods connected directly to the crankshaft, dispensing with the need for connecting rods. In order to achieve this aim, the engine cylinders were not immobile as in most engines, but secured in the middle by trunnions which allowed the cylinders themselves to pivot back and forth as the crankshaft rotated, hence the term ''oscillating''.

It was [[John Penn (engineer)|John Penn]], engineer for the [[Royal Navy]] who perfected the oscillating engine. One of his earliest engines was the [[grasshopper beam engine]]. In 1844 he replaced the engines of the [[Admiralty]] yacht, {{HMS|Black Eagle}} with oscillating engines of double the power, without increasing either the weight or space occupied, an achievement which broke the naval supply dominance of [[Boulton &amp; Watt]] and [[Henry Maudslay|Maudslay, Son &amp; Field]]. Penn also introduced the [[marine steam engine#Trunk|trunk engine]] for driving screw propellers in vessels of war. {{HMS|Encounter|1846|6}} (1846) and {{HMS|Arrogant|1848|6}} (1848) were the first ships to be fitted with such engines and such was their efficacy that by the time of Penn's death in 1878, the engines had been fitted in 230 ships and were the first mass-produced, high-pressure and high-revolution marine engines.&lt;ref&gt;Osbon, G. A., 1965, The Crimean War gunboats. Part. 1. The Mariner's Mirror, The Journal of the Society of Nautical Research. 51, 103‚Äì116 &amp; Preston, A., &amp; Major, 1965, J., Send a gunboat. Longmans, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

The revolution in naval design led to the first modern [[battleship]]s in the 1870s, evolved from the [[ironclad]] design of the 1860s. The [[Devastation-class ironclad|''Devastation''-class]] [[turret ship]]s were built for the British [[Royal Navy]] as the first class of ocean-going [[capital ship]] that did not carry [[sail]]s, and the first whose entire main armament was mounted on top of the hull rather than inside it.

===Rubber===
The [[vulcanization]] of [[rubber]], by American [[Charles Goodyear]] and Englishman [[Thomas Hancock (inventor)|Thomas Hancock]] in the 1840s paved the way for a growing rubber industry, especially the manufacture of [[Tyres|rubber tyre]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=1493: Uncovering the New World Columbus Created|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Veu9u0brhrcC&amp;pg=PA245 |pages=244‚Äì245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Boyd Dunlop]] developed the first practical [[pneumatic]] tyre in 1887 in South Belfast. [[Willie Hume]] demonstrated the supremacy of Dunlop's newly invented pneumatic tyres in 1889, winning the tyre's first ever races in Ireland and then England.&lt;ref name="Gold Hume"&gt;[http://www.thepedalclub.org/archives/goldenbook/u-z/WilliamHume.html The Golden Book of Cycling - William Hume, 1938.

&lt;ref name="Dunlop time"&gt;[http://www.dunlop.eu/dunlop_uk/what_sets_dunlop_apart/history/ Dunlop, What sets Dunlop apart, History, 1889]&lt;/ref&gt; Dunlop's development of the pneumatic tyre arrived at a crucial time in the development of [[road transport]] and commercial production began in late 1890.

===Bicycles===
The modern bicycle was designed by the English engineer [[Harry John Lawson]] in 1876, although it was [[John Kemp Starley]] who produced the first commercially successful safety bicycle a few years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.makingthemodernworld.org.uk/icons_of_invention/technology/1880-1939/IC.025/|title=Icons of Invention: Rover safety bicycle, 1885|publisher=The Science Museum.|accessdate=2010-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its popularity soon grew, causing the [[bike boom]] of the 1890s.

Road networks improved greatly in the period, using the [[Macadam]] method pioneered by Scottish engineer [[John Loudon McAdam]], and hard surfaced roads were built around the time of the bicycle craze of the 1890s. Modern [[Tarmacadam|tarmac]] was patented by British civil engineer [[Edgar Purnell Hooley]] in 1901.&lt;ref name=Morton2002&gt;{{citation |year=2002 |author=Ralph Morton|title=Construction UK: Introduction to the Industry| place=Oxford |publisher=Blackwell Science|page=51 |isbn=0-632-05852-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cW4CRawd1TgC&amp;pg=PA51 |accessdate=22 June 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Automobile===
German inventor [[Karl Benz]] patented the world's [[Benz Patent Motorwagen|first automobile]] in 1886. It featured wire wheels (unlike carriages' wooden ones)&lt;ref&gt;[[G.N. Georgano]] ''Cars: Early and Vintage, 1886-1930''. (London: Grange-Universal, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; with a four-stroke engine of his own design between the rear wheels, with a very advanced coil ignition &lt;ref name="Georgano"&gt;[[G.N. Georgano]]&lt;/ref&gt; and evaporative cooling rather than a radiator.&lt;ref name="Georgano"/&gt; Power was transmitted by means of two [[roller chain]]s to the rear axle. It was the first [[automobile]] entirely designed as such to generate its own power, not simply a motorized-stage coach or horse carriage.

Benz began to sell the vehicle (advertising it as the Benz Patent Motorwagen) in the late summer of 1888, making it the first commercially available automobile in history.

[[Henry Ford]] built his first car in 1896 and worked as a pioneer in the industry, with others who would eventually form their own companies, until the founding of Ford Motor Company in 1903.&lt;ref name="Ford1922" /&gt; Ford and others at the company struggled with ways to scale up production in keeping with Henry Ford's vision of a car designed and manufactured on a scale so as to be affordable by the average worker.&lt;ref name="Ford1922" /&gt; The solution that Ford Motor developed was a completely redesigned factory with [[machine tools]] and special purpose machines that were systematically positioned in the work sequence. All unnecessary human motions were eliminated by placing all work and tools within easy reach, and where practical on conveyors, forming the [[assembly line]], the complete process being called [[mass production]]. This was the first time in history when a large, complex product consisting of 5000 parts had been produced on a scale of hundreds of thousands per year.&lt;ref name ="Ford1922" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hounshell1984" /&gt; The savings from [[mass production]] methods allowed the price of the [[Model T]] to decline from $780 in 1910 to $360 in 1916. In 1924 2 million T-Fords were produced and retailed $290 each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mass Production, the Stock Market Crash and the Great Depression |last=Beaudreau |first=Bernard C. |authorlink= |year=1996 |publisher=Authors Choice Press|location=New York, Lincoln, Shanghi |isbn= |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Applied science===
[[Applied science]] opened many opportunities. By the middle of the 19th century there was a scientific understanding of chemistry and a fundamental understanding of [[thermodynamics]] and by the last quarter of the century both of these sciences were near their present-day basic form. Thermodynamic principles were used in the development of [[physical chemistry]]. Understanding chemistry greatly aided the development of basic inorganic chemical manufacturing and the aniline dye industries.

The science of [[metallurgy]] was advanced through the work of [[Henry Clifton Sorby]] and others. Sorby pioneered the study of [[iron]] and [[steel]] under [[microscope]], which paved the way for a scientific understanding of metal and the mass-production of steel. In 1863 he used etching with acid to study the microscopic structure of metals and was the first to understand that a small but precise quantity of carbon gave steel its strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography of Henry Clifton Sorby|url=http://www.sorby.org.uk/hcsorby.shtml|accessdate=22 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205211758/http://www.sorby.org.uk/hcsorby.shtml|archivedate=5 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This paved the way for [[Henry Bessemer]] and [[Robert Forester Mushet]] to develop the method for mass-producing steel.

Other processes were developed for purifying various elements such as [[chromium]], [[molybdenum]], [[titanium]], [[vanadium]] and [[nickel]] which could be used for making alloys with special properties, especially with steel. [[Vanadium steel]], for example, is strong and fatigue resistant, and was used in half the automotive steel.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Watts, ''The People's Tycoon: Henry Ford and the American Century'' (2006) p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;  Alloy steels were used for ball bearings which were used in large scale bicycle production in the 1880s.  Ball and roller bearings also began being used in machinery.  Other important alloys are used in high temperatures, such as steam turbine blades, and stainless steels for corrosion resistance.

The work of [[Justus von Liebig]] and [[August Wilhelm von Hofmann]] laid the groundwork for modern industrial chemistry. Liebig is considered the "father of the fertilizer industry" for his discovery of [[nitrogen]] as an essential plant nutrient and went on to establish [[Liebig's Extract of Meat Company]] which produced the [[Oxo (food)|Oxo]] [[meat extract]]. Hofmann headed a school of practical chemistry in London, under the style of the [[Royal College of Chemistry]], introduced modern conventions for [[molecular modeling]] and taught Perkin who discovered the first synthetic dye.

The science of [[thermodynamics]] was developed into its modern form by [[Nicolas L√©onard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]], [[William Rankine]], [[Rudolf Clausius]], [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]], [[James Clerk Maxwell]], [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] and [[J. Willard Gibbs]]. These scientific principles were applied to a variety of industrial concerns, including improving the efficiency of boilers and [[steam turbine]]s. The work of [[Michael Faraday]] and others was pivotal in laying the foundations of the modern scientific understanding of [[electricity]].

Scottish scientist [[James Clerk Maxwell]] was particularly influential‚Äîhis discoveries ushered in the era of [[modern physics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/HistTopics/Knots_and_physics.html |title=Topology and Scottish mathematical physics |publisher=University of St Andrews |accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His most prominent achievement was to formulate a [[Maxwell's equations|set of equations]] that described [[electricity]], [[magnetism]], and [[optics]] as manifestations of the same [[phenomenon]], namely the [[electromagnetic field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=James Clerk Maxwell |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/James_Clerk_Maxwell |accessdate=25 March 2013 |publisher=IEEE Global History Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unification of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of [[radio waves]] and was the basis for the future development of radio technology by [[David Edward Hughes|Hughes]], [[Guglielmo Marconi|Marconi]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Maxwell |first=James Clerk |title=A dynamical theory of the electromagnetic field |url=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/A_Dynamical_Theory_of_the_Electromagnetic_Field.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |volume=155 |pages=459‚Äì512 |year=1865 |bibcode=1865RSPT..155..459C |doi=10.1098/rstl.1865.0008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maxwell himself developed the first durable [[Color photography|colour photograph]] in 1861 and published the first scientific treatment of [[control theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Maxwell, James Clerk |year=1868 |title=On Governors |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London |volume=16 |pages=270‚Äì283 |doi=10.1098/rspl.1867.0055 |jstor=112510}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mayr |first=Otto | author-link= Otto Mayr | title=Maxwell and the Origins of Cybernetics |journal=Isis |volume=62 |issue=4 |year=1971 |pages=424‚Äì444 |doi=10.1086/350788}}&lt;/ref&gt; Control theory is the basis for [[process control]], which is widely used in [[automation]], particularly for [[process industries]], and for controlling ships and airplanes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Control Engineering 1800‚Äì1930 |last=Benett|first= Stuart|authorlink=|year=1986|publisher =Institution of Engineering and Technology

These governors came into use in the late 18th century on wind and water mills to correctly position the gap between mill stones, and were adapted to steam engines by [[James Watt]].  Improved versions were used to stabilize automatic tracking mechanisms of telescopes and to control speed of ship propellers and rudders.  However, those governors were sluggish and oscillated about the [[Setpoint (control system)|set point]]. [[James Clerk Maxwell]] wrote a paper mathematically analyzing the actions of governors, which marked the beginning of the formal development of control theory.  The science was continually improved and evolved into an engineering discipline.

===Fertilizer===
[[Justus von Liebig]] was the first to understand the importance of [[ammonia]] as [[fertilizer]], and promoted the importance of inorganic minerals to [[plant nutrition]]. In England, he attempted to implement his theories commercially through a fertilizer created by treating [[phosphate of lime]] in bone meal with [[sulfuric acid]]. Another pioneer was [[John Bennet Lawes]] who began to experiment on the effects of various manures on plants growing in pots in 1837, leading to a manure formed by treating phosphates with sulphuric acid; this was to be the first product of the nascent artificial manure industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Lawes, Sir John Bennet |volume=16 |page=300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery of [[Coprolite#Coprolite mining|coprolites]] in commercial quantities in [[East Anglia]], led Fisons and [[Edward Packard (businessman, born 1819)|Edward Packard]] to develop one of the first large-scale commercial fertilizer plants at [[Bramford]], and [[Snape, Suffolk|Snape]] in the 1850s. By the 1870s [[superphosphate]]s produced in those factories, were being shipped around the world from the port at [[Ipswich]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yara.com/en/about/history/stories/fisons_inter.html History of Fisons at Yara.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060520151251/http://www.yara.com/en/about/history/stories/fisons_inter.html |date=2006-05-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/templates/article.jsp?articleid=50172&amp;back=|title=Oxford DNB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Birkeland‚ÄìEyde process]] was developed by Norwegian industrialist and scientist [[Kristian Birkeland]] along with his business partner [[Sam Eyde]] in 1903,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The development of modern chemistry|author=Aaron John Ihde|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|year=1984|isbn=0486642356|page=678}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was soon replaced by the much more efficient [[Haber process]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A short history of twentieth-century technology c. 1900-c. 1950|author1=Trevor Illtyd Williams|author2=Thomas Kingston Derry|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1982|isbn=0198581599|pages=134‚Äì135}}&lt;/ref&gt;
developed by the [[Nobel prize]]-winning chemists [[Carl Bosch]] of [[IG Farben]] and [[Fritz Haber]] in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/haberbosch.html Haber &amp; Bosch ''Most influential persons of the 20th century''], by [[J√ºrgen Schmidhuber]]&lt;/ref&gt; The process utilized molecular nitrogen (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) gas in an economically sustainable synthesis of [[ammonia]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). The ammonia produced in the Haber process is the main raw material for production of [[nitric acid]].

===Engines and turbines===
The [[steam turbine]] was developed by Sir [[Charles Algernon Parsons|Charles Parsons]] in 1884. His first model was connected to a [[dynamo]] that generated 7.5&amp;nbsp;kW (10&amp;nbsp;hp) of electricity.&lt;ref name="birrcastle.com"&gt;[http://www.birrcastle.com/steamTurbineAndElectricity.asp ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510152751/http://www.birrcastle.com/steamTurbineAndElectricity.asp |date=May 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The invention of Parson's steam turbine made cheap and plentiful electricity possible and revolutionized [[Turbinia|marine transport and naval warfare]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universityscience.ie/pages/scientists/sci_charles_parsons.php ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110063209/http://www.universityscience.ie/pages/scientists/sci_charles_parsons.php |date=January 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of Parson's death, his turbine had been adopted for all major world power stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike earlier steam engines, the turbine produced rotary power rather than reciprocating power which required a crank and heavy flywheel. The large number of stages of the turbine allowed for high efficiency and reduced size by 90%. The turbine's first application was in shipping followed by electric generation in 1903.

The first widely used [[internal combustion engine]] was the [[Otto engine|Otto type]] of 1876. From the 1880s until electrification it was successful in small shops because small steam engines were inefficient and required too much operator attention.&lt;ref name="Smil2005" /&gt; The Otto engine soon began being used to power automobiles, and remains as today's common gasoline engine.

The [[diesel engine]] was independently designed by [[Rudolf Diesel]] and [[Herbert Akroyd Stuart]] in the 1890s using thermodynamic principles with the specific intention of being highly efficient. It took several years to perfect and become popular, but found application in shipping before powering locomotives. It remains the world's most efficient prime mover.&lt;ref name="Smil2005" /&gt;

===Telecommunications===
[[File:1891 Telegraph Lines.jpg|thumb|400px|Major telegraph lines in 1891.]]
The first commercial [[telegraph]] system was installed by Sir [[William Fothergill Cooke]] and [[Charles Wheatstone]] in May 1837 between [[Euston railway station]] and [[Camden Town]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.connected-earth.com/journeys/Firstgenerationtechnologies/Thetelegraph/Thetelegraphicagedawns/index.htm The telegraphic age dawns]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6EKr7FUkw?url=http://www.connected-earth.com/journeys/Firstgenerationtechnologies/Thetelegraph/Thetelegraphicagedawns/index.htm |date=2013-02-10 }} BT Group Connected Earth Online Museum.

The rapid expansion of telegraph networks took place throughout the century, with the first [[undersea cable]] being built by [[John Watkins Brett]] between [[France]] and [[England]].
The [[Atlantic Telegraph Company]] was formed in [[London]] in 1856 to undertake to construct a commercial telegraph cable across the Atlantic Ocean. This was successfully completed on 18 July 1866 by the ship [[SS Great Eastern|SS ''Great Eastern'']], captained by [[Sir James Anderson]] after many mishaps along the away.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Arthur (1994). The Living Rock: The Story of Metals Since Earliest Times and Their Impact on Civilization. p. 203. Woodhead Publishing. {{ISBN|978-1-85573-301-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1850s until 1911, British submarine cable systems dominated the world system. This was set out as a formal strategic goal, which became known as the [[All Red Line]].&lt;ref name="kennedy197110"&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=563928| title=Imperial Cable Communications and Strategy, 1870-1914 | author=Kennedy, P.

The [[telephone]] was patented in 1876 by [[Alexander Graham Bell]], and like the early telegraph, it was used mainly to speed business transactions.&lt;ref&gt;Richard John, ''Network Nation: Inventing American Telecommunications''  (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

As mentioned above, one of the most important scientific advancements in all of history was the unification of light, electricity and magnetism through [[Maxwell's equations|Maxwell's electromagnetic theory]]. A scientific understanding of electricity was necessary for the development of efficient electric generators, motors and transformers. [[David Edward Hughes]] and [[Heinrich Hertz]] both demonstrated and confirmed the phenomenon of electromagnetic waves that had been predicted by Maxwell.&lt;ref name="Smil2005" /&gt;

It was Italian inventor [[Guglielmo Marconi]] who successfully commercialized radio at the turn of the century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Amit|last=Roy|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1081208/jsp/nation/story_10221833.jsp|work=The Telegraph|location=[[Kolkota]]|title=Cambridge 'pioneer' honour for Bose|date=8 December 2008|accessdate=10 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He founded [[Marconi Company|The Wireless Telegraph &amp; Signal Company]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in 1897&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Icons of invention: the makers of the modern world from Gutenberg to Gates|publisher=ABC-CLIO|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WKuG-VIwID8C&amp;pg=PA161|accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ingenious Ireland: A County-by-County Exploration of the Mysteries and Marvels of the Ingenious Irish|publisher=Simon and Schuster|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=exics12jmtwC&amp;pg=PA313|accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the same year transmitted [[Morse code]] across [[Salisbury Plain]], sent the first ever wireless communication over open sea&lt;ref&gt;BBC Wales, [https://web.archive.org/web/20070120163444/http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/historyhunters/locations/pages/3_1_flatholm.shtml Marconi's Waves]&lt;/ref&gt; and made the first transatlantic transmission in 1901 from [[Poldhu]], [[Cornwall]] to [[Signal Hill (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Signal Hill]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]. Marconi built high-powered stations on both sides of the Atlantic and began a commercial service to transmit nightly news summaries to subscribing ships in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Clifden Station of the Marconi Wireless Telegraph System|journal=Scientific American|date=23 November 1907}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The key development of the [[vacuum tube]] by Sir [[John Ambrose Fleming]] in 1904 underpinned the development of modern electronics and radio broadcasting. [[Lee De Forest]]'s subsequent invention of the [[triode]] allowed the amplification of electronic signals, which paved the way for radio broadcasting in the 1920s.

===Modern business management===
Railroads are credited with creating the modern [[business enterprise]] by scholars such as Alfred Chandler.  Previously, the management of most businesses had consisted of individual owners or groups of partners, some of whom often had little daily hands-on operations involvement.  Centralized expertise in the home office was not enough.  A railroad required expertise available across the whole length of its trackage, to deal with daily crises, breakdowns and bad weather.    A collision in Massachusetts in 1841 led to a call for safety reform.  This led to the reorganization of railroads into different departments with clear lines of management authority.  When the telegraph became available, companies built telegraph lines  along the railroads to keep track of trains.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Railroads involved complex operations and employed extremely large amounts of capital and ran a more complicated business compared to anything previous.  Consequently, they needed better ways to track costs.  For example, to calculate rates they needed to know the cost of a ton-mile of freight.  They also needed to keep track of cars, which could go missing for months at a time.  This led to what was called "railroad accounting", which was later adopted by steel and other industries, and eventually became modern accounting.&lt;ref&gt;Compare: {{cite book |last= Chandler Jr. |first= Alfred |date= 1993 |title= The Visible Hand|publisher= Harvard University Press|page= 115 |isbn= 0674417682 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=lAI3AwAAQBAJ | access-date = 2017-06-29 | quote = [...] American railroad accounting overstated operating costs and understated capital consumption.[...] The basic innovations in financial and capital accounting appeared in the 1850s in response to specific needs and were perfected in the years after the Civil War.

&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Later in the Second Industrial Revolution, [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]] and others in America developed the concept of [[scientific management]] or [[Taylorism]]. Scientific management initially concentrated on reducing the steps taken in performing work (such as bricklaying or shoveling) by using analysis such as [[time and motion study|time-and-motion studies]], but the concepts evolved into fields such as [[industrial engineering]], [[manufacturing engineering]], and [[business management]] that helped to completely restructure{{cn|date=June 2017}} the operations of factories, and later entire segments of the economy.

Taylor's core principles included:{{cn|date=June 2017}}

* replacing rule-of-thumb work methods with methods based on a scientific study of the tasks
* scientifically selecting, training, and developing each employee rather than passively leaving them to train themselves
* providing "detailed instruction and supervision of each worker in the performance of that worker's discrete task"
* dividing work nearly equally between managers and workers, such that the managers apply scientific-management principles to planning the work and the workers actually perform the tasks

==Socio-economic impacts==
The period from 1870 to 1890 saw the greatest increase in economic growth in such a short period as ever in previous history. Living standards improved significantly in the newly industrialized countries as the prices of goods fell dramatically due to the increases in [[Productivity improving technologies (historical)|productivity]].  This caused [[unemployment]] and great upheavals in commerce and industry, with many laborers being displaced by machines and many factories, ships and other forms of fixed capital becoming obsolete in a very short time span.&lt;ref name="Wells1890"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The economic changes that have occurred during the last quarter of a century -or during the present generation of living men- have unquestionably been more important and more varied than during any period of the world's history".&lt;ref name ="Wells1890"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Crop failures no longer resulted in starvation in areas connected to large markets through transport infrastructure.&lt;ref name="Wells1890"/&gt;

Massive improvements in public health and sanitation resulted from [[public health]] initiatives, such as the construction of the [[London sewerage system]] in the 1860s and the passage of laws that regulated filtered water supplies‚Äî(the [[Metropolis Water Act 1852|Metropolis Water Act]] introduced regulation of the water supply companies in [[London]], including minimum standards of water quality for the first time in 1852). This greatly reduced the infection and death rates from many diseases.

By 1870 the work done by steam engines exceeded that done by animal and human power.  Horses and mules remained important in agriculture until the development of the internal combustion tractor near the end of the Second Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Ayres|last2=Warr|first1=Robert U.|first2 = Benjamin|author1-link =|title=Accounting for Growth: The Role of Physical Work|year=2004|url=http://www.iea.org/work/2004/eewp/Ayres-paper1.pdf|postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Improvements in steam efficiency, like [[triple-expansion steam engine]]s, allowed ships to carry much more freight than coal, resulting in greatly increased volumes of international trade.  Higher steam engine efficiency caused the number of steam engines to increase several fold, leading to an increase in coal usage, the phenomenon being called the [[Jevons paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

By 1890 there was an international telegraph network allowing orders to be placed by merchants in England or the US to suppliers in India and China for goods to be transported in efficient new steamships.  This, plus the opening of the [[Suez Canal]], led to the decline of the great warehousing districts in London and elsewhere, and the elimination of many middlemen.&lt;ref name="Wells1890"/&gt;

The tremendous growth in productivity, transportation networks, industrial production and agricultural output lowered the prices of almost all goods.  This led to many business failures and periods that were called ''depressions'' that occurred as the world economy actually grew.&lt;ref name="Wells1890"/&gt;  See also: [[Long depression]]

The factory system centralized production in separate buildings funded and directed by specialists (as opposed to work at home). The division of labor made both unskilled and skilled labor more productive, and led to a rapid growth of population in industrial centers. The shift away from agriculture toward industry had occurred in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] by the 1730s, when the percentage of the working population engaged in agriculture fell below 50%, a development that would only happen elsewhere (the [[Low Countries]]) in the 1830s and '40s. By 1890, the figure had fallen to under 10% percent and the vast majority of the British population was [[urbanization|urbanized]]. This milestone was reached by the [[Low Countries]] and the US in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=David Grigg|title=Agriculture in the World Economy: an Historical Geography of Decline|journal=|jstor=40572192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the first industrial revolution, the second supported population growth and saw most governments protect their national economies with tariffs. Britain retained its belief in [[free trade]] throughout this period.  The wide-ranging social impact of both revolutions included the remaking of the working class as new technologies appeared. The changes resulted in the creation of a larger, increasingly professional, middle class, the decline of child labor and the dramatic growth of a consumer-based, material culture.&lt;ref&gt;Hull (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1900, the leaders in industrial production was Britain with 24% of the world total, followed by the US (19%), Germany (13%), Russia (9%) and France (7%). Europe together accounted for 62%.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kennedy, ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers'' (1987) p. 149, based on Paul Bairoch, "International Industrialization Levels from 1750 to 1980," ''Journal of European Economic History'' (1982) v. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

The great inventions and innovations of the Second Industrial Revolution are part of our modern life.  They continued to be drivers of the economy until after WWII.  Only a few major innovations occurred in the post-war era, some of which are: computers, semiconductors, the fiber optic network and the Internet, cellular telephones, [[combustion turbine]]s (jet engines) and the [[Green Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Century of Innovation: Twenty Engineering Achievements That Transformed Our Lives|last=Constable|first=George|authorlink=|author2=Somerville, Bob|year=2003|publisher=Joseph Henry Press|location=Washington, DC|isbn=0-309-08908-5|pages=|url=http://www.greatachievements.org/id=2988}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}This link is to entire on line book.&lt;/ref&gt; Although commercial aviation existed before WWII, it became a major industry after the war.

&lt;/ref&gt;]]
New products and services were introduced which greatly increased international trade. Improvements in [[steam engine]] design and the wide availability of cheap steel meant that slow, sailing ships were replaced with faster steamship, which could handle more trade with smaller crews. The [[history of chemical engineering|chemical]] industries also moved to the forefront. Britain invested less in technological research than the U.S. and Germany, which caught up.

The development of more intricate and efficient machines along with [[mass production]] techniques (after 1910) greatly expanded output and lowered production costs. As a result, production often exceeded domestic demand. Among the new conditions, more markedly evident in Britain, the forerunner of Europe's industrial states, were the long-term effects of the severe [[Long Depression]] of 1873‚Äì1896, which had followed fifteen years of great economic instability. Businesses in practically every industry suffered from lengthy periods of low &amp;mdash; and falling &amp;mdash; profit rates and price deflation after 1873.

==United States==
The U.S. had its highest economic growth rate in the last two decades of the Second Industrial Revolution;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Vatter | last2 = Walker| last3 =Alperovitz| first1 = Harold G.| first2 = John F.| first3 =Gar| author1-link =| title = The onset and persistence of secular stagnation in the U.S. economy: 1910‚Äì1990, Journal of Economic Issues| date = June 1995| url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa5437/is_n2_v29/ai_n28658086/| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, population growth slowed while productivity growth peaked around the mid 20th century.  The [[Gilded Age]] in America was based on heavy industry such as factories, railroads and [[coal mining]].  The iconic event was the opening of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] in 1869, providing six-day service between the East Coast and San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen E. Ambrose, ''Nothing Like It In The World; The men who built the Transcontinental Railroad 1863‚Äì1869'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Gilded Age, American railroad mileage tripled between 1860 and 1880, and tripled again by 1920, opening new areas to commercial farming, creating a truly national marketplace and inspiring a boom in coal mining and steel production. The voracious appetite for capital of the great trunk railroads facilitated the consolidation of the nation's financial market in [[Wall Street]]. By 1900, the process of economic concentration had extended into most branches of industry&amp;mdash;a few large corporations, some organized as "trusts" (e.g. Standard Oil), dominated in steel, oil, sugar, meatpacking, and the manufacture of agriculture machinery. Other major components of this infrastructure were the new methods for manufacturing steel, especially the [[Bessemer process]]. The first billion-dollar corporation was [[United States Steel]], formed by financier [[J. P. Morgan]] in 1901, who purchased and consolidated steel firms built by [[Andrew Carnegie]] and others.&lt;ref name="Edward C. Kirkland 1961"&gt;Edward C. Kirkland, ''Industry Comes of Age, Business, Labor, and Public Policy 1860‚Äì1897'' (1961)&lt;/ref&gt;

Increased mechanization of industry and improvements to worker efficiency, increased the productivity of factories while undercutting the need for skilled labor. Mechanical innovations such as batch and continuous processing began to become much more prominent in factories. This mechanization made some factories an assemblage of unskilled laborers performing simple and repetitive tasks under the direction of skilled foremen and engineers. In some cases, the advancement of such mechanization substituted for low-skilled workers altogether. Both the number of unskilled and skilled workers increased, as their wage rates grew&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Hovey Calhoun, ''The American Civil Engineer: Origins and Conflicts'' (1960)&lt;/ref&gt; Engineering colleges were established to feed the enormous demand for expertise. Together with rapid growth of small business, a new middle class was rapidly growing, especially in northern cities.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Licht, ''Working for the Railroad: The Organization of Work in the Nineteenth Century'' (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Employment distribution ===
In the early 1900s there was a disparity between the levels of employment seen in the northern and southern United States. On average, states in the North had both a higher population, and a higher rate of employment than states in the South. The higher rate of employment is easily seen by considering the 1909 rates of employment compared to the populations of each state in the 1910 census. This difference was most notable in the states with the largest populations, such as New York and Pennsylvania. Each of these states had roughly 5 percent more of the total US workforce than would be expected given their populations. Conversely, the states in the South with the best actual rates of employment, North Carolina and Georgia, had roughly 2 percent less of the workforce than one would expect from their population. When the averages of all southern states and all northern states are taken, the trend holds with the North over-performing by about 2 percent, and the South under-performing by about 1 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Steuart, William M. Abstract of the Census of Manufactures, 1914 .. Washington: Govt. Print. Off., 1917.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Germany==
The [[German Empire]] came to rival Britain as Europe's primary industrial nation during this period. Since Germany industrialized later, it was able to model its factories after those of Britain, thus making more efficient use of its capital and avoiding legacy methods in its leap to the envelope of technology. Germany invested more heavily than the British in research, especially in chemistry, motors and electricity. The German [[Concern (business)|concern]] system (known as ''Konzerne''), being significantly concentrated, was able to make more efficient use of capital.  Germany was not weighted down with an expensive worldwide empire that needed defense. Following Germany's annexation of [[Alsace-Lorraine]] in 1871, it absorbed parts of what had been France's industrial base.&lt;ref&gt;Broadberry and O'Rourke (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1900 the German chemical industry dominated the world market for [[Dye|synthetic dyes]]. The three major firms [[BASF]], [[Bayer]] and [[Hoechst AG|Hoechst]] produced several hundred different dyes, along with the five smaller firms. In 1913 these eight firms produced almost 90 percent of the world supply of dyestuffs, and sold about 80 percent of their production abroad.  The three major firms had also integrated upstream into the production of essential raw materials and they began to expand into other areas of chemistry such as [[Drug|pharmaceuticals]], [[photographic film]], [[Agrochemical|agricultural chemicals]] and [[Electrochemistry|electrochemical]]. Top-level decision-making was in the hands of professional salaried managers, leading Chandler to call the German dye companies "the world's first truly managerial industrial enterprises".&lt;ref&gt;Chandler (1990) p 474-5&lt;/ref&gt;  There were many spin offs from research‚Äîsuch as the pharmaceutical industry, which emerged from chemical research.&lt;ref&gt;Carsten Burhop, "Pharmaceutical Research in Wilhelmine Germany: the Case of E. Merck," ''Business History Review''. Volume: 83. Issue: 3. 2009. pp 475+. in [[ProQuest]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Belgium==
[[History of Belgium|Belgium]] during the [[Belle √âpoque]] showed the value of the [[History of rail transport|railways]] for speeding the Second Industrial Revolution. After 1830, when it [[Belgian Revolution|broke away from the Netherlands]] and became a new nation, it decided to stimulate industry. It planned and funded a simple cruciform system that connected major cities, ports and mining areas, and linked to neighboring countries. Belgium thus became the railway center of the region. [[History of rail transport in Belgium|The system]] was soundly built along British lines, so that profits were low but the infrastructure necessary for rapid industrial growth was put in place.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick O‚ÄôBrien, ''Railways and the Economic Development of Western Europe, 1830‚Äì1914'' (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative uses==
There have been other times that have been called "second industrial revolution". Industrial revolutions may be renumbered by taking earlier developments, such as the rise of [[medieval technology]] in the 12th century, or of ancient Chinese technology during the [[Tang Dynasty]], or of [[ancient Roman technology]], as first. "Second industrial revolution" has been used in the popular press and by technologists or industrialists to refer to the changes following the spread of new technology after [[World War I]].

Excitement and debate over the dangers and benefits of the [[Atomic Age]] were more intense and lasting than those over the [[Space age]] but both were predicted to lead to another industrial revolution. At the start of the [[21st century]]&lt;ref&gt;google.com&lt;/ref&gt; the term "second industrial revolution" has been used to describe the anticipated effects of hypothetical [[molecular nanotechnology]] systems upon society. In this more recent scenario, they would render the majority of today's modern manufacturing processes obsolete, transforming all facets of the modern economy.

In the [[geologic timescale]], the '''Sinemurian''' is an [[age (geology)|age]] and [[stage (stratigraphy)|stage]] in the [[Early Jurassic|Early or Lower Jurassic]] [[epoch (geology)|epoch]] or [[series (stratigraphy)|series]]. It spans the time between 199.3 ¬± 2 [[annum|Ma]] and 190.8 ¬± 1.5 Ma (million years ago).&lt;ref name="benton, 2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Benton|first=Michael J.|title=Prehistoric Life|year=2012|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|location=Edinburgh, Scotland|isbn=978-0-7566-9910-9|pages=44‚Äì45}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sinemurian is preceded by the [[Hettangian]] and is followed by the [[Pliensbachian]].&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed geologic timescale see Gradstein ''et al.'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe the Sinemurian age, together with the Hettangian age, saw the deposition of the lower [[Lias Group|Lias]], in Great Britain known as the [[Blue Lias]].

==Stratigraphic definitions==
[[Image:Cliff Face East Quantoxhead - geograph.org.uk - 1003272.jpg|thumb|Jurassic rock strata in the cliffs at [[East Quantoxhead]], near the Sinemurian [[List of Global Boundary Stratotype Sections and Points|golden spike]].]]
The Sinemurian stage was defined and introduced into scientific literature by French palaeontologist [[Alcide d'Orbigny]] in 1842. It takes its name from the French town of [[Semur-en-Auxois]], near [[Dijon]]. The [[calcareous]] soil formed from the Jurassic [[limestone]] of the region is in part responsible for the character of the classic [[Sancerre (wine)|Sancerre wines]].
 
The base of the Sinemurian stage is at the first appearance of the [[ammonite]] [[genus|genera]] ''[[Vermiceras]]'' and ''[[Metophioceras]]'' in the stratigraphic record. A global reference profile ([[GSSP|GSSP or golden spike]]) for the Sinemurian stage is located in a cliff north of the hamlet of [[East Quantoxhead]], 6 kilometres east of [[Watchet]], [[Somerset]], [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;See for the description of the GSSP Bloos &amp; Page (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Eteoderoceras armatum sinemurian.jpg|thumb|left|''Eteoderoceras armatum'', a Sinemurian ammonite]]
The top of the Sinemurian (the base of the Pliensbachian) is at the first appearances of the ammonite species ''[[Bifericeras|Bifericeras donovani]]'' and ammonite genus ''[[Apoderoceras]]''.

The Sinemurian contains six ammonite [[biozone]]s in the [[Tethys Ocean|Tethys domain]]:
*zone of ''[[Echioceras|Echioceras raricostatum]]''
*zone of ''[[Oxynotoceras|Oxynotoceras oxynotum]]''

The ''Pierre Sonnantes'' or '''Singing Stones of Brittany''' are located on the left bank of the river [[Arguenon]] opposite the ruined castle of Gilles de Bretagne at Notre-Dame-le-Guildo, near [[Dinard]] in the [[C√¥tes-d'Armor]], France.

The stones are round and smooth, shiny black and extremely large, weighing in excess of ten tonnes each and are made of a heavy metallic stone that rings like a bell if struck by another smaller piece of the same stone. There are hundreds of tonnes of them and there is no indication of where they came from or how they got there. They are accepted as [[basalt]] rocks, but this type of rock is usually associated with volcanic eruptions and there is no evidence or history of volcanic activity there.

The stones are unlike any of the surrounding stones either on the ground or on the cliff face overlooking them; legend has it that these stones were spewed up by the giant [[Gargantua]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10912">'''Sustainable urban infrastructure''' expands on the concept of [[Infrastructure|urban infrastructure]] by adding the sustainability element with the expectation of improved and more sustained [[Urban planning|urban development]]. In the construction and physical and organizational structures that enable cities to function, there is the aim of meeting the needs of the present generation without compromising the capabilities of the future generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tiwari |first=Alok |year=2016 |title=Urban Infrastructure Research: A Review of Ethiopian Cities |location=London |publisher=Springer |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-30403-8 |isbn=978-3-319-30401-4 |issn=2211-4165 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
According to the College of Engineering and Applied Science of the [[University of Colorado Denver]], urban infrastructure refers to the engineered systems (water, energy, transport, sanitation, information) that make up a city.  However, challenges resulting from increasing population growth generated a need for sustainable infrastructure that is high performing, cost-effective, resource-efficient and environmentally-friendly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/Engineering/Programs/Civil-Engineering/DegreePrograms/SpecialtyAreas/Pages/SustainableInfrastructure.aspx|title=Specialized Areas of Study|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] maintains that the planning process of sustainable design can lead to the development of a community that is ecologically, economically, and socially sustainable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/greenkit/sustain.htm|title=Action Planning and the Sustainable Community|website=U.S. EPA|accessdate=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[design]] emphasis for a sustainable urban infrastructure is on localization and [[sustainable living]]. The aim is to reduce individual's [[ecological footprint]] according to the principles of [[sustainable development]] in areas with a high [[population density]].

The criteria for what can be included in this kind of urban environment varies from place to place, given differences in existing infrastructure and built form, [[climate]] and availability of local resources or talents.

Generally speaking the following could be considered sustainable urban infrastructure:
* [[public transport]] networks 
* [[distributed generation]] and integrated [[energy demand management]] initiatives and programs
* high efficiency buildings and other development constraints such as only permitting the construction of [[green building]]s and [[sustainable habitat]]s with [[energy-efficient landscaping]].
* connected [[protected area|green space]]s and [[wildlife corridor]]s
* [[Low-impact development (Canada/US)|low impact development]] practices to protect [[water resources]]

== Global Initiatives ==

=== Canada ===

Sustainable urban infrastructure is also called '''sustainable municipal infrastructure''' in Canada. It is an [[infrastructure]] initiative that facilitates a place or [[region]]s progress towards the goal of [[sustainable living]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unepinquiry.org/publication/sustainable-infrastructure-and-finance/|title=Sustainable Infrastructure and Finance - UN Environment Inquiry|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Attention is paid to [[technology|technological]] and [[government]] [[policy|policies]] which enable [[urban planning]] for [[sustainable architecture]] and [[sustainable agriculture]].

Several organizations in Canada related to the [[FCM InfraGuide]] project, including the [[Federation of Canadian Municipalities]], [[Infrastructure Canada]], [[National Research Council of Canada]], and [[Canadian Public Works Association]], seek to achieve [[sustainability]] in [[municipal infrastructure]] especially large scale [[urban infrastructure]], they advocate [[environmental protocol]]s and inclusion of [[ecological and social indicator]]s and factors in [[decision making]] at the earliest possible stage.  There is little focus yet on [[sustainable rural infrastructure]] though this is a stated goal of the project, as is spreading it to achieve [[rural development]] in [[developing nation]]s.

In their view, [[sustainability]] concerns apply to all of "maintaining, repairing and upgrading the infrastructure that sustains our [[quality of life]]" including at least:
* municipal [[decision making]] and [[investment planning]]
* [[potable water]] supply
* [[stormwater]] and [[waste water]] especially minimizing the distance that such water travels to be treated and reused
* [[road]]s and [[sidewalk]]s and their integration with [[Public transport|transit systems]] to achieve smoother flow of people
* [[environmental protocol]]s and multi-discipline practices to ensure they are respected, e.g. [[green procurement]].

These and other Canadian official entities including the [[Auditor General of Canada]] and [[Service Canada]] are focused on related efforts such as [[municipal performance audit]]s, [[information technology]] and [[communications technology]], [[moral purchasing]] and sharing of "data, information, common infrastructure, technology" and the need to "integrate their business processes" to further reduce duplication and waste, especially [[e-waste]] and [[greenhouse gas]] emissions ''a concern under [[Kyoto Protocol]] targets that Canada has committed to achieve.''  In 2011, Canada withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol due to economic concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/climate-change/global-climate-change-regime/p21831|title=The Global Climate Change Regime|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|accessdate=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-16151310|title=Canada to withdraw from Kyoto Protocol|website=BBC News|accessdate=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Communities of Tomorrow is a non-profit enterprise in Saskatchewan, Canada that fosters the development and commercialization of innovative sustainable infrastructure solutions for the global marketplace. Sustainable infrastructure is the development of water, sewer, roads, and other infrastructure systems that meet the needs of current and future generations in a socially, economically and environmentally sustainable manner. Communities of Tomorrow brings industry firms together with researchers to collaboratively develop new infrastructure solutions to existing or future problems with the ultimate goal to commercialize them.  It‚Äôs about building greener and longer lasting infrastructure, such as roads and water systems, to offer the global marketplace.

=== Switzerland ===

The Swiss [[Global Infrastructure Basel Foundation]] (GIB) supports various stakeholders, such as governments, banks and cities, in the designing, implementing and financing sustainable urban infrastructure projects at all stages of the project cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://issuu.com/utkmedia/docs/nachhaltigesinvestment_2016/65?e=1307954/30767650|title=Nachhaltigesinvestment 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, GIB has developed, in cooperation with the French bank [[Natixis]], the SuRe¬Æ Standard ‚Äì The Standard for Sustainable and Resilient Infrastructure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laprensalibre.cr/Noticias/detalle/69610/firman-acuerdo-para-garantizar-transparencia-en-construcciones|title=Firman acuerdo para garantizar transparencia en construcciones - laprensalibre.cr|first=|last=www.laprensalibre.cr|website=www.laprensalibre.cr}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a global voluntary ISEAL standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ictsd.org/bridges-news/bridges-africa/news/sustainable-trade-infrastructure-in-africa-a-key-element-for-growth|title=Sustainable trade infrastructure in Africa: A key element for growth and prosperity? - International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development|website=www.ictsd.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; GIB has also developed the SuRe¬Æ SmartScan, a simplified version of the SuRe¬Æ Standard that serves as a self-assessment tool for sustainable infrastructure projects. It provides project developers with a comprehensive analysis of the various themes covered by the SuRe¬Æ Standard, offering a solid foundation for green infrastructure projects that are planning to become certified by the SuRe¬Æ Standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunwindenergy.com/content/sure-global-infrastructure-standard-sustainable-future|title=SuRe - The Global Infrastructure Standard for a Sustainable Future|first=|last=Kronsbein|date=6 February 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aspects==
{{original research|date=March 2015}}
Roadside and urban infrastructures such as signposts, bollards and street furniture are prone to damage and deterioration. As infrastructure deteriorates, it requires either replacement or enhancement. Existing public funding sources are inadequate to meet the need.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Closing the infrastructure gap|url=https://www2.deloitte.com/ie/en/pages/finance/articles/closing-the-infrastructure-gap.html|website=Deloitte|accessdate=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-healing technology could protect surrounding paving and foundations from damage when items of infrastructure are impacted, which can reduce maintenance and improve the sustainability of urban developments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McKeag|first1=Tom|title=Highway, heal thyself|url=https://www.greenbiz.com/article/biomimicry-self-healing-road-materials-sustainable-concrete|accessdate=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-healing developments result in zero-waste and zero-landfill from maintenance on items of urban infrastructure for the life of the development.

'''''The Slater Field Guide to Australian Birds ''''' is one of the main national bird [[field guide]]s used by Australian [[birdwatching|birders]].

==Description==
The guide was first published in 1986 in Sydney by Rigby Publishers and authored by [[Peter Slater (ornithologist)|Peter Slater]] and other members of his family.  It is 215&amp;nbsp;mm high by 113&amp;nbsp;mm wide and weighs 440&amp;nbsp;g.  The [[imprint page]] asserts [[copyright]] of the paintings for Peter Slater, of the text for Pat Slater, and of the maps for Raoul Slater.&lt;ref&gt;Slater ''et al''. (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1970-74 Slater had produced a [[A Field Guide to Australian Birds (Slater)|two-volume guide to Australian birds]] which was the first of the new generation of Australian field guides to appear after the [[World War II|Second World War]].  It was shortly followed by guides authored by [[Graham Pizzey]] in 1980 and by [[Ken Simpson]] and [[Nicolas Day]] in 1984.  Slater's second guide continued the evolutionary succession only two years later.  In a review in the ornithological journal ''[[Emu (journal)|Emu]]'' Ian Taylor said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;‚ÄùPeter Slater, in conjunction with his wife Pat and their son Raoul, has produced a one volume field guide for the whole of Australia which looks like being serious competition for Graham Pizzey's popular field guide.  The great strengths of this book lie in its size and its format.  For the first time, here is a field guide which can actually be used in the field.  Unlike earlier multi-volume or large format guides, Slater will fit in a trouser or jacket pocket.  Gone are the days of carrying guides in day packs or rushing back to the car to confirm an identification.  What is remarkable is that it has taken so long for a pocket sized field guide to appear.  Our northern hemisphere counterparts have had them for years.  The other great strength is the format.  At last we have a field guide with the text and distribution maps opposite the illustrations.‚Äù&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;Taylor (1987).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A second updated and reorganised 360-page edition was issued by New Holland Publishers in 2009.  It has 64 new or revised colour plates, incorporating all the new birds recorded in Australia since 1986.&lt;ref&gt;New Holland.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tropical Atlantic realm''' is one of twelve [[marine realm]]s that cover the world's coastal seas and [[continental shelf|continental shelves]]. 

The Tropical Atlantic covers both sides of the Atlantic. In the western Atlantic, it extends from [[Bermuda]], southern [[Florida]], and the southern [[Gulf of Mexico]] through the [[Caribbean]] and along South America's Atlantic coast to [[Cape Frio]] in [[Brazil]]'s [[Rio de Janeiro state]]. In the Eastern Atlantic, it extends along the [[Africa]]n coast from [[Ras Nouadhibou|Cape Blanco]] in [[Mauritania]] to the [[Tigres Peninsula]] on the coast of [[Angola]]. It also includes the seas around [[St. Helena]] and [[Ascension Island|Ascension]] islands.

The Tropical Atlantic is bounded on the north and south by temperate ocean realms. The Temperate Northern Atlantic realm lies to the north on both the North American and African-European shores of the Atlantic. To the south, the ocean realms conform to the continental margins, not the ocean basins; the Temperate South America realm lies to the south along the South American coast, and the Temperate Southern Africa realm lies to the south along the African coast.

==Marine provinces==
The Tropical Atlantic realm is divided into six [[marine provinces]], which are in turn divided into 25 [[marine ecoregion]]s.

'''Uludaƒü''' ({{IPA-tr|Ààu…´ud…ëÀê}}), the ancient '''Mysian Olympus''' (also '''Bithynian Olympus'''), is a mountain in [[Bursa Province]], [[Turkey]], with an elevation of {{Convert|2543|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. 

In [[Turkish language|Turkish]], ''Uludaƒü'' means "[[:wikt:ulu#Turkish|great]] mountain". In ancient times the range of which it is a part, extending along the southern edge of [[Bithynia]], was known as Olympos in Greek and Olympus in Latin, the western extremity being known as the Mysian Olympus and the eastern as the Bithynian Olympus,&lt;ref&gt;Charles Anthon, ''A System of Ancient and Medi√¶val Geography for the Use of Schools'', Harper, 1850, p. 632&lt;/ref&gt; and the city of [[Bursa]] was known as Prusa ad Olympum from its position near the mountain.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Anthon, ''A Classical Dictionary'', Harper, 1869, p. 1135&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the [[Middle Ages]], it contained hermitages and monasteries: "The rise of this monastic centre in the 8th c. and its prestige up to the 11th are linked to the resistance of numerous monks to the policy of the [[Iconoclasm (Byzantine)|iconoclast]] emperors and then to a latent opposition to the urban, [[Constantinople|Constantinopolitan]] monasticism of the [[Studites]]."&lt;ref&gt;Andre Vauchez et al., ''Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages'', Routledge, 2000, p. 1046&lt;/ref&gt; One of the greatest monks of the Christian East, the wonder-working Byzantine monk [[Saint Joannicius the Great]], lived as a hermit on this mountain.

Mt. Uludaƒü is the highest mountain of the [[Marmara Region|Marmara]] region. Its highest peak is Kartaltepe at {{Convert|2543|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. To the north are high plateaus: Sarƒ±alan, Kirazlƒ±yayla, Kadƒ±yayla, and Sobra.

There is an abandoned [[Wolframite|wolfram]] mine near the summit. The mine and the integrated plant, which were built in 1974 for US$60 million, were closed in 1989 due to high production costs.
The area is a popular center for [[winter sports]] such as [[skiing]], and a [[national park]] of rich [[flora]] and [[fauna]]. Summer activities, such as trekking and [[camping]], also are popular.

== Uludaƒü National Park Turkey ==

The highest area in western [[Anatolia]], Uludaƒü is easily ascended by car or cable-car. The park is about {{convert|22|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} south of Bursa and is signposted from there. Bursa can be reached by road from [[Istanbul]]. The cable-car ascends from Bursa and has an intermediate stop in the alpine meadows of Kadiyayla at about {{Convert|1200|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} elevation. It ends at Sarialan at about {{Convert|1630|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.

[[File:Uludag ski rando.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Skiing in the Uludaƒü range (February 2007 photograph)]]
Habitats of the park range from [[Maquis shrubland|maquis]] on the lower slopes, through [[deciduous]] woodland and [[beech]] and [[fir]] forest to alpine meadows at the highest levels. It is a refuge for mountain birds, such as [[lammergeier]] and other [[vultures]], [[golden eagle]] and more than 20 other [[Bird of prey|raptor]] species. Other high-altitude species include [[alpine accentor]], [[rock thrush]]es and [[choughs]]. The area is also good for eastern specialities such as [[isabelline wheatear]], and, at almost the most westerly points of their range, [[red-fronted serin]] and [[Kr√ºper's nuthatch]]. The dense fir forest holds [[short-toed treecreeper]], [[common crossbill]] and [[Tengmalm's owl]], a rare and very local bird in Turkey, as well as the [[white-backed woodpecker]]. 
The rare and local butterfly, ''[[Parnassius apollo graslini]]'', is found on Uludag and the area has much of interest to botanists, with colourful pink primroses (''[[Primula vulgaris]]'' var. ''sibthorpii''), leopard's bane (''[[Doronicum orientale]]''), crocuses: the purple ''[[Crocus siberi]]'' and yellow ''[[Crocus flavus]]'', and grape hyacinths (''[[Muscari racemosum]]''). There are also few [[wolf]] packs roaming on the mountain.
