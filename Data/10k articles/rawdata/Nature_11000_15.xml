'''Air pollution forecasting''' is the application of science and technology to predict the composition of the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] for a given location and time.

The forecast may give the pollutants concentration or the [[air quality index]].

Countries and cities are given forecasts by organizations like the [[EPA]], as well as private companies like AirVisual, Aerostate, BreezoMeter and PlumeLabs that give air pollution forecast.

==Techniques==
* Air pollution forecasting can be done by coupling [[weather forecasting]] systems with [[Chemical transport model]].
* Using [[machine learning]] techniques&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S135223100000385X "Neural networks and periodic components used in air quality forecasting"]&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The forecast takes into account local emission sources (like nearby [[traffic]] or industry) and remote sources (e.g. [[dust]] that is carried by [[Air parcel|air parcels]] and follows the [[wind]] direction).

==Motivation==
* By knowing the air quality forecast one can decide how to act, e.g. due to air pollution [[Air_pollution#Health_effects|health effects]], one can choose the best time to do an outdoor activity.
* Deciding whether to put on a skin care ointment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dermalogica &amp; BreezoMeter partner to educate on pollution's skin effects |url=https://blog.breezometer.com/dermalogica-cosmetics |accessdate=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
* Find the cleanest route for cars&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Clean Air Route Finder |url=https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/environment/pollution-and-air-quality/clean-air-route-finder |publisher=Greater London Authority}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
* Deciding whether to leave the windows open or closed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Air Pollution Maps: Users Love Them, Your Brand Needs Them |url=https://blog.breezometer.com/air-pollution-maps}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Aphanite''', or '''aphanitic''' as an adjective (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] αφανης, "invisible"), is a name given to certain [[igneous rock]]s that are so fine-grained that their component [[mineral]] [[crystal]]s are not detectable by the unaided eye&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Aphanite|volume=2|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; (as opposed to [[phaneritic]] igneous rocks, where the minerals are visible to the unaided eye). This [[Texture (geology)|geological texture]] results from rapid cooling in [[volcanic]] or [[hypabyssal]] (shallow subsurface) environments. As a rule, the texture of these rocks is not the same as that of [[volcanic glass]] (e.g., [[obsidian]]), with volcanic glass being non-crystalline ([[amorphous]]), and having a glass-like appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Bates and Jackson, 1984, ''Dictionary of Geological Terms'', 3rd ed., Prepared by the American Geological Institute&lt;/ref&gt;

Aphanites are commonly [[porphyritic]], having large crystals embedded in the fine [[groundmass]] or [[matrix (geology)|matrix]].  The large [[inclusion (mineral)|inclusion]]s are called [[phenocryst]]s.

They consist essentially of very fine-grained minerals, such as [[plagioclase]] [[feldspar]], with [[hornblende]] or [[augite]], and may contain also [[biotite]], [[quartz]], and [[orthoclase]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

==Common rocks that can be aphanitic==
* [[Andesite]]
* [[Basalt]]
* [[Basanite]]
* [[Dacite]]
* [[Felsite]]
* [[Phonolite]]
* [[Rhyolite]]
* [[Trachyte]]

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8088">'''Apparent polar wander (APW)''' is the perceived movement of the [[Earth]]'s [[paleomagnetism|paleo]]-[[Poles of astronomical bodies|magnetic pole]]s relative to a [[continent]] while regarding the continent being studied as fixed in position.&lt;ref name="Kearey-2009-p67"&gt;{{Cite book |first=Philip |last=Kearey |first2=Keith A. |last2=Klepeis |first3=Frederick  J. |last3=Vine |year=2009 |title=Global  Tectonics |edition=3 |pages=67 |place=Chichester |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-1-4051-0777-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is frequently displayed on the present latitude-longitude map as a path connecting the locations of [[geomagnetic pole]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, inferred at distinct times using paleomagnetic techniques.

In reality, the relative polar movement can be either polar wandering or continental drift (or a combination of both).&lt;ref name="Tauxe-2010"&gt;{{Cite book |first=Lisa |last=Tauxe |year=2010 |title=Essentials of Paleomagnetism |place=University of California |isbn=9780520260313}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Data from around the globe are needed in order to isolate or distinguish between the two. Nevertheless, the magnetic poles rarely stray far from the geographic poles of the planet. Therefore, the concept of apparent polar wander is very useful in plate tectonics, since it can retrace the relative motion of continents, as well as the formation and break-up of supercontinents.

==History==
It has been known for a long time that the geomagnetic field varies through time, and records of its direction and magnitude have been kept in different locations since the 1800s.&lt;ref name="Tauxe-2010"/&gt; The technique of drawing apparent polar wander was first developed by Creer et al. (1954), and was a  major step taken towards the acceptance of the plate tectonics theory. Since then many discoveries have been made in that field, and apparent polar wander has become better understood with the evolution of the theory and of the Geocentric Axial Dipole (GAD) model. There are over 10,000 paleomagnetic poles recorded in the database today.&lt;ref name="Tauxe-2010"/&gt;

==Paleomagnetic poles==
Much research in [[paleomagnetism]] is aimed at finding paleomagnetic poles for different continents and at different epochs, in order to assemble them in APWP tracks.&lt;ref name="Tauxe-2010"/&gt; Paleomagnetic poles have the advantage that they should have the same value at each observing locality on the basis of the Geocentric axial dipole (GAD) model.&lt;ref name="M&amp;M-2000"&gt;{{Cite book |first=M. |last=McElhinny |first2=P. |last2=McFadden |year=2000 |title=Paleomagnetism: Continents and Oceans |publisher = Academic Press|isbn=0080513468}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus they can be used to compare paleomagnetic results from widely separated localities.

==Rock magnetism==
Fossil magnetization in rocks is key to locate a paleomagnetic pole. At the time of formation, rocks conserve the direction of the magnetic field. The inclination(Im) and declination vectors(Dm) are preserved and therefore the paleolatitude(λp) and paleolongitude(φp) of the pole can be found.&lt;ref name=M&amp;M-2000/&gt;

===Blocking temperature===
The reason the characteristics of the field are conserved comes from the concept of blocking temperature (also known as [[closure temperature]] in geochronology). This temperature is where the system becomes blocked against thermal agitation at lower temperatures.&lt;ref name=M&amp;M-2000/&gt; Therefore, some minerals exhibit remnant magnetization. One problem that arises in the determination of remnant (or fossil) magnetization is that if the temperature rises above this point, the magnetic history is destroyed. However, in theory it should be possible to relate the magnetic blocking temperature to the isotopic closure temperature, such that it could be checked whether or not a sample can be used.&lt;ref name=M&amp;M-2000/&gt;

==APWP tracks==
Often, APWP tracks represent the motion of a plate relative to a fixed point (paleomagnetic pole). The usual pattern observed consists of long, gently curved segments linked by short, sharply curved segments. Those respectively  correspond to time intervals of constant plate motion versus changing plate motion.&lt;ref name=M&amp;M-2000/&gt;

These segments are described by the rotation about a pivot point, which is called the paleomagnetic Euler pole ("Euler" is pronounced like "oiler") (see [[Euler's rotation theorem]]). The relative motion between two plates is also described by the rotation about an Euler Pole. In recent times it is easier to determine finite rotations as transforms and ridges are respectively perpendicular and parallel to the direction of a finite rotation pole.&lt;ref name=Tauxe-2010/&gt; In this way reconstructions of the last 200 Ma rely mostly on marine geophysical data. Older than that we run out of seafloor, so other ways have to be used, like paleomagnetic poles and fit of geological observations.

Determining paleomagnetic poles is a complicated process since with increasing time more uncertainties come into play. Reliability of poles has been subject to debate for many years. Paleomagnetic poles are usually a group mean determined from different samples, in order to average out the secular variation over time to respect GAD hypothesis.&lt;ref name=Tauxe-2010/&gt; 
The treatment of data is a big step and involves a lot of statistical calculations to obtain a valid paleomagnetic pole.

When applied to continents, it is possible to define finite rotation with paleomagnetic poles; that is, describe the certain motion of a continent based on records of its paleomagnetic poles. However, there are two major problems for constraining finite rotation:&lt;ref name=M&amp;M-2000/&gt;

• Because of random magnetic reversals, the north magnetic pole at a given time could either be in the North or South hemisphere. Without context, it is impossible to know which is the north-seeking direction of the magnetic vectors. Again, in recent times there is often a better context, but after 300Ma it becomes increasingly difficult.

• The paleolongitude cannot be constrained from the pole alone. This is why data from different locations are needed, as it reduces the degrees of freedom. With the apparent polar wander path of high fidelity, however, paleolongitude could be constrained by the paleomagnetic Euler rotations (rotation poles and angles) estimated from the circle modelling to the APWP tracks.&lt;ref name="WuKravchinsky14"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2014GL060080/abstract|title=Derivation of paleo-longitude from the geometric parametrization of apparent polar wander path: implication for absolute plate motion reconstruction|last=Wu|first=L.|author2=Kravchinsky V.A.|accessdate=10 February 2014|doi=10.1002/2014GL060080|volume=41|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|pages=4503–4511}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of much paleomagnetic research is to assemble poles in APWPs for the different continental fragments, which is the first step in reconstructing the paleogeography. The two main issues in this construction are

* 1) The selection of reliable poles (criteria V90, BC02)
* 2) Curve fitting.&lt;ref name=M&amp;M-2000/&gt;
The first issue has been addressed with general selection criteria. The common ones have been described by Van der Voo (1990; V90). These include the uncertainty on ages, the number of samples, positive field tests to constrain the age of magnetization relative to the age of the rock (e.g. fold test), pole positions etc. Besse and Courtillot (2002; BC02) brought some modifications to these criteria for particular applications. 
Once poles are selected and attributed a certain degree of reliability, the task of curve fitting remains, in order to define apparent polar wander paths. Different approaches have been used for this process: Discrete windows, Key poles, Moving windows, splines, Paleomagnetic Euler pole (PEP) analysis, Master path, inclination-only data. These differ in the way poles are separated, the relative importance attributed to some poles and the general shape of resulting curves.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3173">In [[polymer chemistry]], [[materials science]], and [[food science]], '''bloom''' refers to the migration of one component of a solid mixture to the surface of an article.  The process is an example of [[Phase (matter)|phase separation]] or phase aggregation. 

==Materials science==
[[File:EU food contact material symbol.svg|150px|thumb|EU food contact material symbol: used for marking materials intended to come into contact with food in the European Union as defined in regulation (EC) No 1935/2004]]
Blooming is commonly encountered in polymer additives such as [[Polymer stabilizers|stabilizers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zweifel|first1=Hans|last2=Maier|first2=Ralph D.|last3=Schiller|first3=Michael|title=Plastics additives handbook|date=2009|publisher=Hanser|location=Munich|isbn=978-3-446-40801-2|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many polymers are essentially pure hydrocarbons whereas additives are often significantly more polar, this results their being forced out via hydrophobic forces. The blooming of additives may be desirable or undesirable. For example, the migration of antioxidants to the polymer surface may help it resist degradation. Conversely, the leaching of additives from packaging materials into foods, or the blooming of additives in biomedical devices is often of high concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nouman |first1=Micheal |last2=Saunier |first2=Johanna |last3=Jubeli |first3=Emile |last4=Yagoubi |first4=Najet |title=Additive blooming in polymer materials: Consequences in the pharmaceutical and medical field |journal=Polymer Degradation and Stability |date=September 2017 |volume=143 |pages=239–252 |doi=10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2017.07.021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regulations exist in many counties that require both the levels of blooming and the materials involved to be of a safe level, for example the international symbol for materials approved for [[Food contact materials|food contact]] is a wine glass and a fork symbol.

===Sulfur bloom=== 
Sulfur bloom refers to the migration of [[sulfur]], usually as S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, to the surface of a rubber article either before or after [[vulcanization]].  Blooming is undesirable in rubber processing.  When sulfur bloom appears before vulcanization, the rubber is deprived of the crosslinking agent. Sulfur bloom after vulcanization indicates incomplete vulcanization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rubber Compounding: Principles: Materials, and Techniques |edition=Second |author=Barlow, Fred W. |publisher=M. Dekker |year=1993 |isbn=0824789687}}&lt;/ref&gt; In rubber processing, ingredients other than sulfur can "bloom", including antioxidants, fatty acids, and accelerators.

==Food science==
===Chocolate bloom===
{{main|Chocolate bloom}}
Chocolate bloom refers two types of whitish coating that can appear on the surface of chocolate: fat bloom, caused by changes in the fat crystals in the chocolate; and sugar bloom, due to crystals formed by the action of moisture on the sugar. Chocolate that has "bloomed" remains edible but may have an unappetizing appearance and texture.

A '''bur''' (also spelled '''burr''')&lt;ref name=Cook68&gt;{{Cite book |last=Cook |first=J. Gordon |year=1968 |title=ABC of Plant Terms |publication-place=Watford, Herts |publisher=Merrow |oclc=223208923 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[seed]] or dry [[fruit]] or [[infructescence]] that has hooks or teeth.

Some other forms of [[Diaspore (botany)|diaspores]], such as the stems of certain species of [[Cactaceae|cactus]] also are covered with thorns and may function as burs.

Bur-bearing plants such as ''Xanthium'' species are often single-stemmed when growing in dense groups, but branch and spread when growing singly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/agriculture/pests-weeds/weeds/profiles/californian-burr Noogoora burr, Californian burr, Italian cockleburr and South American burr (''Xanthium'' species).] New South Wales Department of Primary Industries. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==
Burs catch on the fur of passing animals or the clothing of people. The hooks or teeth generally cause irritation, and some species commonly cause gross injury to animals, or expensive damage to clothing or to vehicle tires.

Burs serve the plants that bear them in two main ways. 
* Firstly, burs tend to repel some [[herbivore]]s, much as other [[Thorns, spines, and prickles|spines and prickles]] do. 
* Secondly, plants with burs rely largely on living agents to disperse their seeds; their burs are mechanisms of [[seed dispersal]] by [[Seed dispersal#By animals|epizoochory]] (dispersal by attaching to the outside of animals).&lt;ref name=sf&gt;Magee, M. B. [http://homeguides.sfgate.com/plants-burrs-26416.html Plants With Burrs.] ''San Francisco Chronicle''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most epizoochorous burs attach to hair on the body or legs of the host animal, but a special class of epizoochorous bur is known as the '''trample-bur''' (or '''trample-burr'''). Several species of ''[[Tribulus]]'', ''[[Harpagophytum]]'', and ''[[Grielum]]'' produce fruit in the form of trample-burs. As the name suggests, they attach themselves to the animal when trampled. They may hook onto the legs of animals as the large hooks of ''[[Harpagophytum]]'' do, sometimes causing serious injury, but sometimes hooking onto the leg of say, an ostrich, apparently without causing discomfort.&lt;ref&gt;Midgley, J.J. and Illing, N. Were Malagasy Uncarina fruits dispersed by the extinct elephant bird? South African Journal of Science 105, November/December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; It also might penetrate a hoof or foot pad or the tires of a vehicle, only to be shed after being carried for a considerable time and distance; most ''Tribulus'' and ''Grielum'' species are specialised for such attachment, variously being flat, but with upward-directed spikes as in say, ''Grielum humifusum'',&lt;ref name="OudtshoornRooyen1999"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Karen van Rheede van Oudtshoorn|author2=Margaretha W. van Rooyen|title=Dispersal Biology of Desert Plants|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bdTfBfsl-DcC&amp;pg=PA95|year=1999|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-64886-4|pages=95–}}&lt;/ref&gt; or shaped like a [[caltrop]] as in some species of ''Tribulus'' that have achieved the status of [[Cosmopolitan distribution|cosmopolitan]] weeds by sticking to the tires of aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Holm, L. et al. A geographical atlas of world weeds. Krieger 1991, {{ISBN|978-0894643576}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relevance to humans==
Burs are best known as sources of irritation, injury to livestock, damage to clothing, punctures to tires, and clogging equipment such as agricultural harvesting machinery.

Some have however been used for such purposes as fabric fulling, for which the [[Dipsacus|fuller's teasel]] is a traditional resource.

The bur of [[burdock]] was the inspiration for [[hook and loop fastener]], also known as [[Velcro]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1996883,00.html|title=A Brief History of: Velcro|first=Claire|last=Suddath|date=15 June 2010|accessdate=17 October 2018|publisher=[[Time_(magazine)|Time]]|via=content.time.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''Cenomanian''' is, in the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy|ICS]]' [[geological timescale]] the oldest or earliest [[age (geology)|age]] of the [[Late Cretaceous]] [[epoch (geology)|epoch]] or the lowest [[stage (stratigraphy)|stage]] of the [[Upper Cretaceous]] [[series (stratigraphy)|series]].&lt;ref&gt;See for a detailed geologic timescale Gradstein ''et al.'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; An age is a unit of [[geochronology]]: it is a unit of time; the stage is a unit in the [[stratigraphic column]] deposited during the corresponding age. Both age and stage bear the same name.

As a unit of geologic time measure, the Cenomanian age spans the time between&lt;ref name="IUGS-ISC"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 100.5 ± 0.9 [[annum|Ma]] and 93.9 ± 0.8 Ma (million years ago). In the geologic timescale it is preceded by the [[Albian]] and is followed by the [[Turonian]]. The Upper Cenomanian starts approximately at 95 M.a.

The Cenomanian is coeval with the [[Woodbinian]] of the regional timescale of the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the early part of the [[Eaglefordian]] of the regional timescale of the [[East Coast of the United States]].

At the end of the Cenomanian an [[anoxic event]] took place, called the [[Cenomanian-Turonian boundary event]] or the "Bonarelli Event", that is associated with a minor extinction event for marine species.

==Stratigraphic definitions==
The Cenomanian was introduced in scientific literature by French [[palaeontology|palaeontologist]] [[Alcide d'Orbigny]] in 1847. Its name comes from the [[New Latin]] name of the French city of [[Le Mans]] (département [[Sarthe]]), ''Cenomanum''.

The base of the Cenomanian stage (which is also the base of the Upper Cretaceous series) is placed at the first appearance of [[foram]] species ''[[Rotalipora|Rotalipora globotruncanoides]]'' in the [[stratigraphic record]]. An official reference profile for the base of the Cenomanian (a [[GSSP]]) is located in an [[outcrop]] at the western flank of [[Mont Risou]], near the village of [[Rosans]] in the French [[Alps]] (département [[Hautes-Alpes]], coordinates: 44°23'33"N, 5°30'43"E). The base is, in the reference profile, located 36 meters below the top of the [[Marnes Bleues Formation]].&lt;ref&gt;The GSSP for the Cenomanian was established by Kennedy ''et al.'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

The top of the Cenomanian (the base of the Turonian) is at the first appearance of [[ammonite]] species ''[[Watinoceras|Watinoceras devonense]]''.

Important [[index fossil]]s for the Cenomanian are the ammonites ''[[Calycoceras|Calycoceras naviculare]]'', ''[[Acanthoceras (ammonite)|Acanthoceras rhotomagense]]'' and ''[[Mantelliceras|Mantelliceras mantelli]]''.

==Sequence stratigraphy and palaeoclimatology==
The late Cenomanian represents the highest [[mean sea-level]] observed in the [[Phanerozoic]] [[Geologic time scale#Terminology|eon]], the past six hundred million years (approximately one hundred and fifty meters above present day sea-levels). A corollary is that the highlands were at all time lows, so the landscape on Earth was one of warm broad shallow seas inundating low-lying land areas on the precursors to today's continents. What few lands rose above the waves were made of old mountains and hills, upland [[plateau]]s, all much weathered. [[Tectonic]] mountain building was minimal and most continents were isolated by large stretches of water. Without highlands to brake winds, the climate would have been windy and waves large, adding to the weathering and fast rate of sediment deposition.

==Palaeontology==

During the Cenomanian was the origin of the crown-group Crocodylia, the true-crocodiles&lt;ref&gt;Mateus, O., Callapez P. M., &amp; Puértolas-Pascual E. (2017).  The oldest Crocodylia? a new eusuchian from the Late Cretaceous (Cenomanian) of Portugal. Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, Program and Abstracts. 2017, 160.&lt;/ref&gt; and snakes.

The modern Christmas tree was developed in medieval [[Livonia]] (present-day [[Estonia]] and [[Latvia]]) and [[early Modern history of Germany|early modern Germany]], where Protestant Germans brought decorated trees into their homes.&lt;ref name="Perry2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Perry|first=Joe|title=Christmas in Germany: A Cultural History|date=27 September 2010|publisher=[[University of North Carolina Press]]|language=English|isbn=9780807899410|page=32|quote=A chronicle from Stasbourg, written in 1604 and widely seen as the first account of a Christmas tree in German-speaking lands, records that Protestant artisans brought fir trees into their homes in the holiday season and decorated them with "roses made of colored paper, apples, wafers, tinsel, sweetmeats, etc." ...

The tree was traditionally decorated with "roses made of colored paper, apples, wafers, tinsel, [and] sweetmeats". In the 18th century, it began to be illuminated by candles, which were ultimately replaced by [[Christmas lights]] after the advent of [[electrification]]. Today, there is a wide variety of [[Christmas ornament|traditional ornaments]], such as [[garland]]s, [[Christmas ornament|baubles]], [[tinsel]], and [[candy cane]]s. An angel or star might be [[tree-topper|placed at the top of the tree]] to represent the [[Angel]] [[Gabriel]] or the [[Star of Bethlehem]], respectively, from the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]].&lt;ref name="Mandryk2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones2011"/&gt; Edible items such as [[gingerbread]], [[chocolate]] and other sweets are also popular and are tied to or hung from the tree's branches with ribbons.

In the [[Western Christian]] tradition, Christmas trees are variously erected on days such as the [[first day of Advent]] or even as late as [[Christmas Eve]] depending on the country;&lt;ref name="Crump2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Crump|first=William D.|title=The Christmas Encyclopedia, 3d ed.|date=15 September 2001|publisher=McFarland|language=English |isbn=9780786468270|page=386|quote=Christmas trees in the countryside did not appear until World War I, although Slovenians of German ancestry were decorating trees before then.

==History==

===Possible predecessors===  
[[File:yggdrasil.jpg|thumb|upright|From ''Northern Antiquities'', an English translation of the [[Prose Edda]] from 1847. Painted by Oluf Olufsen Bagge.]]

The relevance of ancient pre-Christian customs to the 16th-century German initiation of the Christmas tree custom is disputed. Resistance to the custom was often because of its supposed Lutheran origins.&lt;ref&gt;Gillian Cooke, ''A Celebration of Christmas'', 1980, page 62: "Martin Luther has been credited with the creation of the Christmas tree. ... The Christmas tree did not spring fully fledged into ... tree was slow to spread from its Alsatian home, partly because of resistance to its supposed Lutheran origins."&lt;/ref&gt;

Other sources have offered a connection between the first documented Christmas trees in Alsace around 1600 and pre-Christian traditions. For example, according to the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', "The use of [[evergreen|evergreen trees]], wreaths, and garlands to symbolize eternal life was a custom of the ancient [[Egyptians]], [[Chinese people|Chinese]], and [[Hebrews]]. Tree worship was common among the pagan Europeans and survived their conversion to Christianity in the Scandinavian customs of decorating the house and barn with evergreens at the New Year to scare away the devil and of setting up a tree for the birds during Christmas time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2012 |title=Christmas tree |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/115737/Christmas-tree |date= |accessdate=2012-11-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030053259/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/115737/Christmas-tree |archivedate=2012-10-30 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Roman mid-winter festival of [[Saturnalia]], houses were decorated with [[wreaths]] of evergreen plants, along with other antecedent customs now associated with Christmas.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/0/20617780 |title=BBC Religion &amp; Ethics – Did the Romans invent Christmas?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2016-09-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161207095037/http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/0/20617780 |archive-date=2016-12-07 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern Christmas tree is frequently traced to the symbolism of trees in pre-Christian winter rites, wherein [[Viking]] and [[Saxon]] worshiped trees.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;  The story of [[Saint Boniface]] cutting down [[Donar's Oak]] illustrates the pagan practices in 8th century among the Germans.  A later folk version of the story adds the detail that an evergreen tree grew in place of the felled oak, telling them about how its triangular shape reminds humanity of the [[Trinity]] and how it points to heaven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fritz Allhoff, Scott C. Lowe|title=Christmas|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|year=2010|quote=His biographer, Eddius Stephanus, relates that while Boniface was serving as a missionary near Geismar, Germany, he had enough of the locals' reverence for the old gods. Taking an axe to an oak tree dedicated to Norse god Thor, Boniface chopped the tree down and dared Thor to zap him for it. When nothing happened, Boniface pointed out a young fir tree amid the roots of the oak and explained how this tree was a more fitting object of reverence as it pointed towards the Christian heaven and its triangular shape was reminiscent of the Christian trinity.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The story, not recounted in the ''[[hagiography|vitae]]'' written in his time, appears in a [[BBC]] Devon website, "Devon Myths and Legends", and in a number of educational storybooks, including ''St. Boniface and the Little Fir Tree: A Story to Color'' by Jenny Melmoth and Val Hayward (Warrington: Alfresco Books 1999 {{ISBN|1-873727-15-1}}), ''The Brightest Star of All: Christmas Stories for the Family'' by Carrie Papa (Abingdon Press 1999 {{ISBN|978-0-687-64813-9}}) and [https://books.google.com/books?id=BdEAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA207 "How Saint Boniface Kept Christmas Eve"] by Mary Louise Harvey in ''The American Normal Readers: Fifth Book'', 207-22.

Alternatively, it is identified with the "[[tree of life (biblical)|tree of paradise]]" of medieval [[mystery play]]s that were given on 24 December, the commemoration and [[name day]] of [[Adam and Eve]] in various countries. In such plays, a tree decorated with apples (to represent the forbidden fruit) and wafers (to represent the [[Eucharist]] and redemption) was used as a setting for the play. Like the [[Nativity scene|Christmas crib]], the Paradise tree was later placed in homes. The apples were replaced by round objects such as shiny red balls.&lt;ref name="Dues"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Karas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lazowski"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HIhIPIYLQ6QC&amp;pg=PA204 |author=Philip Lazowski |title=Understanding Your Neighbor's Faith |publisher=KTAV Publishing House |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-88125-811-0 |pages=203–04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Foley"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XstmMVLDzIIC&amp;pg=PA18 |author=Michael P.

The main prop of a popular medieval play about Adam and Eve was a fir tree hung with apples (paradise tree) representing the Garden of Eden. The Germans set up a paradise tree in their homes on December 24, the religious feast day of Adam and Eve. They hung wafers on it (symbolizing the host, the Christian sign of redemption); in a later tradition, the wafers were replaced by cookies of various shapes. Candles, too, were often added as the symbol of Christ. In the same room, during the Christmas season, was the [[Christmas pyramid]], a triangular construction of wood, with shelves to hold Christmas figurines, decorated with evergreens, candles, and a star. By the 16th century, the Christmas pyramid and paradise tree had merged, becoming the Christmas tree. |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |year=2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the Middle Ages, an early predecessor appears referred in the Regiment of the [[Cistercians|Order of Cister]] around 1400, in Alcobaça, Portugal. The Regiment of the local ''high-Sacristans'' of the Cistercian Order refers to what may be considered one of the oldest references to the Christmas tree: "Note on how to put the Christmas branch, ''scilicet'': On the Christmas eve, you will look for a large Branch of green laurel, and you shall reap many red oranges, and place them on the branches that come of the laurel, specifically as you have seen, and in every orange you shall put a candle, and hang the Branch by a rope in the pole, which shall be by the candle of the ''altar-mor''."&lt;ref&gt;''Biblioteca Nacional de Portugal'' (National Library of Portugal) - ''Codices Alcobacenses'' ([http://www.bnportugal.pt/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=195%3Acodices-alcobacences&amp;catid=71%3Areservados-manuscritos&amp;Itemid=212&amp;lang=pt] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130221070531/http://www.bnportugal.pt/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=195%3Acodices-alcobacences&amp;catid=71%3Areservados-manuscritos&amp;Itemid=212&amp;lang=pt |date=2013-02-21 }} ); [BN: cod. alc.

Modern Christmas trees originated during the [[German Renaissance|Renaissance]] of [[early Modern history of Germany|early modern Germany]].

The first recorded Christmas tree can be found on the keystone sculpture of a private home in [[Turckheim]], Alsace (then part of Germany, today France), dating 1576.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Le Vieux Turckheim|last=Ehrsam|first=Roger|publisher=Jérôme Do Bentzinger|year=1999|isbn=290623883X|location=Ville de Turckheim|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Georgia====
[[File:Chichilaki Georgian christmass tree.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Chichilaki]], a Georgian Christmas tree variety]]

[[Georgians]] have their own traditional Christmas tree called [[Chichilaki]], made from dried up [[hazelnut]] or [[walnut]] branches that are shaped to form a small coniferous tree. These pale-colored ornaments differ in height from {{convert|20|cm|in|abbr=on}} to {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}}. Chichilakis are most common in the [[Guria]] and [[Samegrelo]] regions of Georgia near the [[Black Sea]], but they can also be found in some stores around the capital of [[Tbilisi]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}
Georgians believe that Chichilaki resembles the famous beard of [[St. Basil the Great]], because [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] commemorates St.&amp;nbsp;Basil on [[January 1]].

====Poland====
There was an old [[pagan]] custom, associated with [[Koliada]], of suspending a branch of fir, spruce or pine called [[Podłaźniczka]] from the ceiling. The branches were decorated with apples, nuts, cookies, colored paper, stars made of straw, ribbons and colored wafers. Some people believed that the tree had magical powers that were linked with harvesting and success in the next year.

In the late 18th and early 19th century, these traditions were almost completely replaced by the German custom of decorating the Christmas tree.

====Estonia, Latvia and Germany====
[[File:Franz Skarbina Unter dem Weihnachtsbaum.jpg|thumb|upright|Girl with Christmas tree, painting 1892 by [[Franz Skarbina]] (1849–1910)]]
Customs of erecting decorated trees in wintertime can be traced to Christmas celebrations in Renaissance-era [[guild]]s in [[Northern Germany]] and [[Livonia]]. The first evidence of decorated trees associated with Christmas Day are trees in guildhalls decorated with sweets to be enjoyed by the apprentices and children. In [[Livonia]] (present-day [[Estonia]] and [[Latvia]]), in 1441, 1442, 1510 and 1514, the [[Brotherhood of Blackheads]] erected a tree for the holidays in their guild houses in Reval (now [[Tallinn]]) and [[Riga]]. On the last night of the celebrations leading up to the holidays, the tree was taken to the [[Town Hall Square, Tallinn|Town Hall Square]], where the members of the brotherhood danced around it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Friedrich Amelung |title=Geschichte der Revaler Schwarzenhäupter: von ihrem Ursprung an bis auf die Gegenwart: nach den urkundenmäßigen Quellen des Revaler Schwarzenhäupter-Archivs 1, Die erste Blütezeit von 1399–1557  |language=de|trans-title=History of the Tallinn Blackheads: from their origins until the present day: from the testimonial sources of the Tallinn Blackheads archive. 1: The first golden age of 1399–1557 |location=[[Tallinn|Reval]] |publisher=Wassermann |year=1885 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Bremen]] guild chronicle of 1570 reports that a small tree decorated with "apples, nuts, dates, pretzels and paper flowers" was erected in the guild-house for the benefit of the guild members' children, who collected the dainties on Christmas Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D1jgAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22aus+Deutschland%22|title=Das Weihnachtsfest.

After the [[Protestant Reformation]], such trees are seen in the houses of upper-class Protestant families as a counterpart to the Catholic [[Nativity scene|Christmas cribs]]. This transition from the guild hall to the bourgeois family homes in the Protestant parts of Germany ultimately gives rise to the modern tradition as it developed in the 18th and 19th centuries.

===18th to early 20th centuries===

====Germany====
[[File:Die Gartenlaube (1888) Nr49 Beilage.jpg|thumb|upright|A little Christmas tree on the table, painting by Ludwig Blume-Siebert in 1888]]

By the early 18th century, the custom had become common in towns of the upper [[Rhineland]], but it had not yet spread to rural areas. Wax candles, expensive items at the time, are found in attestations from the late 18th century.

Along the lower Rhine, an area of Roman Catholic majority, the Christmas tree was largely regarded as a Protestant custom. As a result, it remained confined to the upper Rhineland for a relatively long period of time. The custom did eventually gain wider acceptance beginning around 1815 by way of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] officials who emigrated there following the [[Congress of Vienna]].

In the 19th century, the Christmas tree was taken to be an expression of [[Culture of Germany|German culture]] and of {{lang|de|[[Gemütlichkeit]]}}, especially among [[ethnic Germans|emigrants]] overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Johannes Marbach |title=Die heilige Weihnachtszeit nach Bedeutung, Geschichte, Sitten und Symbolen|language=German |trans-title=The holy Christmas season for meaning, history, customs and symbols |year=1859 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FXhEAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA416 |page=416 |quote={{lang|de|Was ist auch eine deutsche Christenfamilie am Christabend ohne Christbäumchen?

A decisive factor in winning general popularity was the German army's decision to place Christmas trees in its barracks and military hospitals during the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. Only at the start of the 20th century did Christmas trees appear inside churches, this time in a new brightly lit form.&lt;ref name="Hermelink"&gt;{{cite book |author=Jan Hermelink |chapter=Weihnachtsgottesdienst |trans-chapter=Christmas worship |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=WOrt4xXGSKcC&amp;pg=PA290 |editor=Christian Grethlein |editor2=Günter Ruddat |title=Liturgisches Kompendium|language=German |publisher=Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht |year=2003 |isbn=978-3-525-57211-5 |page=290 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Adoption by European nobility====
[[File:Woonkamer vol keurig geklede kinderen die bij de kerstboom dansen.jpg|thumb|Christmas tree painting 1877 by H. J. Overbeek]]
In the early 19th century, the custom became popular among the nobility and spread to royal courts as far as Russia. [[Princess Henrietta of Nassau-Weilburg]] introduced the Christmas tree to [[Vienna]] in 1816, and the custom spread across Austria in the following years. In [[France]], the first Christmas tree was introduced in 1840 by the [[Prince Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orléans|duchesse d'Orléans]]. In Denmark a Danish newspaper claims that the first attested Christmas tree was lit in 1808 by countess Wilhemine of Holsteinborg. It was the aging countess who told the story of the first Danish Christmas tree to the Danish writer [[Hans Christian Andersen]] in 1865. He had published a fairy-tale called ''[[The Fir-Tree]]'' in 1844, recounting the fate of a fir-tree being used as a Christmas tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/artikel/307946:Kronik--Danmarks-foerste-juletrae-blev-taendt-i-1808 |work=Kristelig Dagblad |title=Danmarks første juletræ blev tændt i 1808 |date=December 17, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213095846/http://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/artikel/307946:Kronik--Danmarks-foerste-juletrae-blev-taendt-i-1808 |archivedate=December 13, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the [[personal union]] with [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]], [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]]'s German-born wife, [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]], introduced a Christmas tree at a party she gave for children in 1800.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thamesweb.co.uk/christmas/christmas_tree.html|title=The History of the Christmas Tree at Windsor|access-date=2013-01-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111224161224/http://www.thamesweb.co.uk/christmas/christmas_tree.html|archive-date=2011-12-24|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The custom did not at first spread much beyond the royal family.&lt;ref&gt;In 1829 the diarist [[Charles Greville (diarist)|Greville]], visiting [[Panshanger]] country house, describes three small Christmas trees "such as is customary in Germany", which [[Dorothea Lieven|Princess Lieven]] had put up. {{cite book|last=Hole|first=Christine|title=English Custom and Usage|year=1950|publisher=B.

In 1842 a newspaper advert for Christmas trees makes clear their smart cachet, German origins and association with children and gift-giving.&lt;ref&gt;"GERMAN CHRISTMAS TREES. The nobility and gentry are respectfully informed that these handsome JUVENILE CHRISTMAS PRESENTS are supplied and elegantly fitted up...":''Times'' [London, England] 20 December 1842, p.&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/ref&gt; An illustrated book, ''The Christmas Tree'', describing their use and origins in detail, was on sale in December 1844.&lt;ref&gt;''The Christmas Tree'': published by Darton and Clark, London. "The ceremony of the Christmas tree, so well known throughout Germany, bids fair to be welcomed among us, with the other festivities of the season, especially now the Queen, within her own little circle, has set the fashion, by introducing it on the Christmas Eve in her own regal palace."

In fewer than ten years their use in better-off homes was widespread. By 1856 a northern provincial newspaper contained an advert alluding casually to them,&lt;ref&gt;"Now the best Christmas box / You can give to the young / Is not toys, nor fine playthings, / Nor trees gaily hung...": Manchester Guardian, Saturday, January 05, 1856, p.&amp;nbsp;6.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as reporting the accidental death of a woman whose dress caught fire as she lit the tapers on a Christmas tree.&lt;ref&gt;''Manchester Guardian'', 24 January 1856, p.&amp;nbsp;3: the death of Caroline Luttrell of [[Kilve Court]], Somerset.&lt;/ref&gt; They had not yet spread down the social scale though, as a report from Berlin in 1858 contrasts the situation there where "Every family has its own" with that of Britain, where Christmas trees were still the preserve of the wealthy or the "romantic".&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' (London, England), 28 December 1858, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Their use at public entertainments, charity bazaars and in hospitals made them increasingly familiar however, and in 1906 a charity was set up specifically to ensure even poor children in London slums 'who had never seen a Christmas tree' would enjoy one that year.&lt;ref&gt;The Poor Children's Yuletide Association. ''The Times'' (London, England), 20 December 1906, p.&amp;nbsp;2" "The association sent 71 trees 'bearing thousands of toys' to the poorest districts of London."&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-German sentiment after [[World War I]] briefly reduced their popularity&lt;ref&gt;"A Merry Christmas": ''The Times'' (London, England), 27 December 1918, p.&amp;nbsp;2: "...the so-called "Christmas tree" was out of favour. Large stocks of young firs were to be seen at Covent Garden on Christmas Eve, but found few buyers. It was remembered that the 'Christmas tree' has enemy associations."&lt;/ref&gt; but the effect was short-lived&lt;ref&gt;The next year a charity fair in aid of injured soldiers featured 'a huge Christmas-tree'. 'St. Dunstan's Christmas Fair'. ''The Times'' (London, England), 20 December 1919, p.&amp;nbsp;9.&lt;/ref&gt; and by the mid-1920s the use of Christmas trees had spread to all classes.&lt;ref&gt;'Poor families in Lewisham and similar districts are just as particular about the shape of their trees as people in Belgravia...' 'Shapely Christmas Trees': ''The Times'' (London, England), 17 December 1926, p.&amp;nbsp;11.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933 a restriction on the importation of foreign trees led to the "rapid growth of a new industry" as the growing of Christmas trees within Britain became commercially viable due to the size of demand.&lt;ref&gt;Christmas Tree Plantations. ''The Times'' (London, England), 11 December 1937, p.&amp;nbsp;11.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2013 the number of trees grown in Britain for the Christmas market was approximately 8 million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cornwall-25117501|title=Christmas tree grower Ivor Dungey gets award|publisher=BBC News|access-date=2018-06-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180731014120/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cornwall-25117501|archive-date=2018-07-31|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their display in homes, shops and public spaces a normal part of the Christmas season.

The tradition was introduced to [[North America]] in the winter of 1781 by [[Germans in the American Revolution|Hessian soldiers]] stationed in the [[Province of Québec (1763–1791)]] to garrison the colony against [[Invasion of Canada (1775)|American attack]]. General [[Friedrich Adolf Riedesel]] and his wife, [[Frederika Charlotte|the Baroness von Riedesel]], held a Christmas party for the officers at [[Sorel-Tracy|Sorel]], delighting their guests with a fir tree decorated with candles and fruits.&lt;ref name="Werner"&gt;{{cite book |title=In Pursuit of Liberty: Coming of Age in the American Revolution |author=Emmy E.

The Christmas tree became very common in the United States in the early nineteenth century. The first image of a Christmas tree was published in 1836 as the frontispiece to ''The Stranger's Gift'' by Hermann Bokum. The first mention of the Christmas tree in American literature was in a story in the 1836 edition of ''The Token and Atlantic Souvenir'', titled "New Year's Day," by Catherine Maria Sedgwick, where she tells the story of a German maid decorating her mistress's tree. Also, a woodcut of the British Royal family with their Christmas tree at Windsor Castle, initially published in ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'' December 1848, was copied in the United States at Christmas 1850, in ''[[Godey's Lady's Book]]''. ''Godey's'' copied it exactly, except for the removal of the Queen's tiara and Prince Albert's moustache, to remake the engraving into an American scene.&lt;ref name="AFP"&gt;{{cite book |author=Alfred Lewis Shoemaker |origyear=1959 |title=Christmas in Pennsylvania: a folk-cultural study |pages=52–53 |publisher=Stackpole Books |year=1999 |isbn=0-8117-0328-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The republished ''Godey's'' image became the first widely circulated picture of a decorated evergreen Christmas tree in America. Art historian Karal Ann Marling called Prince Albert and Queen Victoria, shorn of their royal trappings, "the first influential American Christmas tree".&lt;ref name="ADT"&gt;{{cite book |author=Karal Ann Marling |year=2000 |title=Merry Christmas! Celebrating America's greatest holiday |page=244 |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |isbn=0-674-00318-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Folk-culture historian Alfred Lewis Shoemaker states, "In all of America there was no more important medium in spreading the Christmas tree in the decade 1850–60 than ''Godey's Lady's Book''". The image was reprinted in 1860, and by the 1870s, putting up a Christmas tree had become even more common in America.&lt;ref name="AFP"/&gt;

Several cities in the United States with German connections lay claim to that country's first Christmas tree: [[Windsor Locks, Connecticut]], claims that a Hessian soldier put up a Christmas tree in 1777 while imprisoned at the Noden-Reed House,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wfsb.com/clip/12040705/first-decorated-christmas-tree-in-windsor-locks|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210223922/http://www.wfsb.com/clip/12040705/first-decorated-christmas-tree-in-windsor-locks|dead-url=yes|archive-date=10 December 2015|title=First Decorated Christmas Tree in Windsor Locks|author=Joseph Wenzel IV|publisher=WFSB|date=30 November 2015|accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the "First Christmas Tree in America" is also claimed by [[Easton, Pennsylvania]], where German settlers purportedly erected a Christmas tree in 1816. In his diary, Matthew Zahm of [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]], recorded the use of a Christmas tree in 1821, leading Lancaster to also lay claim to the first Christmas tree in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The History of Christmas |work=Gareth Marples |url=http://www.thehistoryof.net/the-history-of-christmas.html |accessdate=December 2, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060628034631/http://www.thehistoryof.net/the-history-of-christmas.html |archive-date=2006-06-28 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other accounts credit [[Charles Follen]], a German immigrant to Boston, for being the first to introduce to America the custom of decorating a Christmas tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1996/12.12/ProfessorBrough.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990823204728/http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/1996/12.12/ProfessorBrough.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 23, 1999 |title=Professor Brought Christmas Tree to New England |date=December 12, 1996 |accessdate=December 2, 2012 |work=[[Harvard Gazette|Harvard University Gazette]] |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[August Imgard]], a German immigrant living in [[Wooster, Ohio]], is said to be the first to popularize the practice of decorating a tree with [[candy cane]]s.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} In 1847, Imgard cut a blue spruce tree from a woods outside town, had the Wooster village tinsmith construct a star, and placed the tree in his house, decorating it with paper ornaments, gilded nuts and [[Kuchen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=They're Still Cheering Man Who Gave America Christmas Tree|url=http://www.the-daily-record.com/citizen%20news/2007/12/10/they-re-still-cheering-man-who-gave-america-christmas-tree-cleveland-ceremonies-honor-him-august-imgard-of-wooster-ohio|publisher=[[Wisconsin Rapids Daily Tribune]]|accessdate=16 May 2013|date=24 December 1938|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219034027/http://www.the-daily-record.com/citizen%20news/2007/12/10/they-re-still-cheering-man-who-gave-america-christmas-tree-cleveland-ceremonies-honor-him-august-imgard-of-wooster-ohio|archive-date=2013-12-19|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; German immigrant Charles Minnegerode accepted a position as a professor of humanities at the [[College of William &amp; Mary]] in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]], in 1842, where he taught Latin and Greek.

When Edward H.

Johnson became the "Father of Electric Christmas Tree Lights".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldchristmastreelights.com/history.htm|title=A Brief History of Electric Christmas Lighting in America|website=oldchristmastreelights.com|accessdate=2014-12-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219174210/http://www.oldchristmastreelights.com/history.htm|archive-date=2014-12-19|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lyrics sung in the United States to the German tune {{lang|de|[[O Tannenbaum]]}} begin "O Christmas tree...", giving rise to the mistaken idea that the [[German language|German]] word {{lang|de|Tannenbaum}} (fir tree) means "Christmas tree", the German word for which is instead {{lang|de|Weihnachtsbaum}}.

In [[Russia]], the Christmas tree was banned after the [[October Revolution]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=E4CML6akeYMC&amp;pg=PT222|title=Santa Claus|access-date=2015-12-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222171000/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=E4CML6akeYMC&amp;pg=PT222|archive-date=2015-12-22|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but then reinstated as a ''New-year spruce'' ({{lang|ru|Новогодняя ёлка}}, {{lang|ru-Latn|Novogodnyaya yolka}}) in 1935. It became a fully secular icon of the [[New Year]] holiday, for example, the crowning star was regarded not as a symbol of Bethlehem Star, but as the [[Red star]]. Decorations, such as figurines of airplanes, bicycles, space rockets, [[cosmonaut]]s, and characters of Russian fairy tales, were produced. This tradition persists after the fall of the USSR, with the [[Novy God|New Year holiday]] outweighing the Christmas (7 January) for a wide majority of Russian people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.levada.ru/27-04-2012/1-maya-sobirayutsya-prazdnovat-59-rossiyan |title=1 мая собираются праздновать 59% россиян |trans-title=May 1 going to celebrate 59% of Russians |date=April 27, 2012 |accessdate=December 2, 2012 |language=Russian |quote=New Year is among the most important holidays for 81% of Russians, while Christmas is such only for 19%, ranking after [[Victory Day]], [[Easter]], [[International Women's Day]]. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101064834/http://www.levada.ru/27-04-2012/1-maya-sobirayutsya-prazdnovat-59-rossiyan |archive-date=2012-11-01 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The TV special ''[[A Charlie Brown Christmas]]'' (1965) was influential on the pop culture surrounding the Christmas tree. [[Aluminum Christmas tree]]s were popular during the early 1960s in the US. They were satirized in the Charlie Brown show and came to be seen as symbolizing the commercialization of Christmas. The term  ''Charlie Brown Christmas tree'', describing any poor-looking or malformed little tree, also derives from the 1965 TV special, based on the appearance of [[Charlie Brown]]'s Christmas tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://muse.jhu.edu/|title = Materialism and the Modern U.S. Christmas|last = Belk|first = Russell|year = 2000|journal = Advertising &amp; Society Review|accessdate = October 5, 2014|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140506133533/http://muse.jhu.edu/|archive-date = 2014-05-06|dead-url = no|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Public Christmas trees====
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-12787, Prag, Weihnachtsfeier für Erwerbslose.jpg|thumb|left| An early example of a public Christmas celebration tree for the unemployed in [[Prague]] ]]
Since the early 20th century, it has become common in many cities, towns, and department stores to put up public Christmas trees outdoors, such as the [[Macy's Great Tree]] in [[Atlanta]] (since 1948), the [[Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree]] in New York City, and the large Christmas tree at [[Victoria Square, Adelaide|Victoria Square]] in [[Adelaide]].
The use of fire retardant allows many indoor public areas to place real trees and be compliant with code.   Licensed applicants of fire retardant solution spray the tree, tag the tree, and provide a certificate for inspection.  Real trees are popular with high end visual merchandising displays around the world.  Leading global retailers such as [[Apple (company)|Apple]] often place real trees in their window displays.  In 2009, Apple placed two [[Fraser fir]] trees in every one of [[Apple Store|its retail establishments]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

The United States' [[National Christmas Tree (United States)|National Christmas Tree]] has been lit each year since 1923 on the South Lawn of the [[White House]]. Today,{{clarify|date=February 2012}} the lighting of the National Christmas Tree is part of what has become a major holiday event at the White House. President [[Jimmy Carter]] lit only the crowning star atop the tree in 1979 in honor of the Americans being [[Iran hostage crisis|held hostage in Iran]].&lt;ref name="npspp"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/whho/historyculture/lighting-of-the-national-christmas-tree-history.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115224842/http://www.nps.gov/whho/historyculture/lighting-of-the-national-christmas-tree-history.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 15, 2008 |title=Lighting of the National Christmas Tree |publisher=[[National Park Service]] |accessdate=April 5, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same was true in 1980, except that the tree was fully lit for 417 seconds, one second for each day the hostages had been in captivity.&lt;ref name="npspp"/&gt;

During most of the 1970s and 1980s, the largest decorated Christmas tree in the world was put up every year on the property of the ''[[National Enquirer]]'' in [[Lantana, Florida]]. This tradition grew into one of the most spectacular and celebrated events in the history of southern Florida, but was discontinued on the death of the paper's founder in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Flashback Blog: The World's Largest Decorated Christmas Tree |work=[[The Palm Beach Post]] |date=December 3, 2009 |url=http://www.historicpalmbeach.com/flashback/2009/12/the-worlds-largest-decorated-christmas-tree |accessdate=March 4, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091205193345/http://www.historicpalmbeach.com/flashback/2009/12/the-worlds-largest-decorated-christmas-tree/ |archivedate=December 5, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cities, a charity event called the [[Festival of Trees]] is organized, in which multiple trees are decorated and displayed.

The giving of Christmas trees has also often been associated with the end of hostilities.

"Chrismon" (plural "Chrismons")  was adopted for the type of [[Christmas decoration]] and explained as a portmanteau of "'''Chris'''t-'''mon'''ogram" (a [[Christogram]]).&lt;ref&gt;so in ''The Lutheran Witness'', Volume 83 (1964), p. 548 "the Chrismon (from CHRISt-MONogram) tree", and in James Edgar, Ellen Edgar, ''A Chrismon Service'' (1981), p. 2.
The word's actual etymology, from Middle Latin ([[Landulf of Milan]], 12th century) [[:wikt:crismon|crismon]], is less than clear:
[[George Henry Lane-Fox Pitt-Rivers]], ''The riddle of the 'Labarum' and the origin of Christian symbols'', Allen &amp; Unwin, 1966, p. 28; "I can find no roots, etymology or grounds for the adoption of the word adopted by some Christians, 'Chrismon', which is supposed to mean the 'Monogram of Christ', and which appears in some dictionaries (i.e. Funk and Wagnalis, 1922)."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stookey2011"&gt;{{cite book|title=Calendar: Christ's Time for the Church|last=Stookey|first=Laurence Hull|date=1 December 2011|publisher=Abingdon Press|isbn=9781426728044|page=107|quote=Beyond that the term "Chrismon" is used loosely to refer to symbols related to Christ, including the orb, crown, fish, star, anchor, and a wide variety of forms on the cross.

}}

[[File:Candle on Christmas tree 3.jpg|thumb|A candle on a Christmas tree]]
Both setting up and taking down a Christmas tree are associated with specific dates. Traditionally, Christmas trees were not brought in and decorated until [[Christmas Eve]] (24 December){{Citation needed |date=December 2011}} or, in the traditions celebrating Christmas Eve rather than [[Twelve Days of Christmas|the first day of Christmas]], 23 December, and then removed the day after [[Twelfth Night (holiday)|Twelfth Night]] (5 January); to have a tree up before or after these dates was even considered bad luck,{{Citation needed |date=December 2011}} and that to avoid bad luck from affecting the house's residents, the tree must be left up until after the following [[Twelfth Night]] passes.

In many areas, it has become customary to set up one's Christmas tree at the beginning of the [[Advent]] season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Peter Mazar |title=School Year, Church Year: Customs and Decorations for the Classroom |year=2000 |publisher=Liturgy Training Publications |isbn=1568542402 |page=161 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some families in the U.S. and Canada will put up a Christmas tree a week prior to American [[Thanksgiving]] (the fourth Thursday of November), and Christmas decorations can show up even earlier in retail stores, often the day after [[Halloween]] (31 October). In Canada many families wait until after [[Remembrance Day]], as to show respect to fallen soldiers. Some households do not put up the tree until the second week of December, and leave it up until 6 January ([[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]]). In Germany, traditionally the tree is put up on 24 December and taken down on 7 January, though many start one or two weeks earlier, and in Roman Catholic homes the tree may be kept until February 2 ([[Candlemas]]).{{why |date=December 2012}}{{citation needed |date=December 2012}}

In [[Italy]], [[Ireland]] and [[Argentina]], along with many countries in Latin America, the Christmas tree is put up on 8 December ([[Immaculate Conception|Immaculate Conception day]]) and left up until 6 January. In Australia, the Christmas tree is usually put up on 1 December, which occurs about 2 weeks before the school summer holidays (except for South Australia, where most people put up their tree in November following the completion of the [[Adelaide Christmas Pageant]], a time frame that has started to filter into other states as the official time Christmas decorations and in store Santa Claus start to appear) and is left up until it is taken down.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Some traditions suggest that Christmas trees may be kept up until no later than 2 February, the feast of the [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple]] (Candlemas), when the Christmas season effectively closes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.holytrinitygerman.org/postepiphanycustoms.html |title=Customs of the Weeks after Epiphany |publisher=Holy Trinity (German) Catholic Church, Boston |accessdate=December 2, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730170514/http://www.holytrinitygerman.org/postepiphanycustoms.html |archive-date=2013-07-30 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Superstitions say that it is a bad sign if Christmas greenery is not removed by Candlemas Eve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/holidays/christmas/superstitions.asp |title=Christmas Superstitions |date=December 2006 |publisher=[[Snopes.com]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christmas ornaments are decorations (usually made of glass, metal, wood, or ceramics) that are used to decorate a Christmas tree. The first decorated trees were adorned with apples, white candy canes and pastries in the shapes of stars, hearts and flowers.  [[Glass]] baubles were first made in [[Lauscha]], [[Germany]],  and also garlands of glass beads and [[tin]] figures that could be hung on trees. The popularity of these decorations grew into the production of glass figures made by highly skilled [[artisans]] with [[clay]] molds.

Tinsel and several types of garland or ribbon are commonly used to decorate a Christmas tree. Silvered [[saran (plastic)|saran]]-based tinsel was introduced later. Delicate mold-blown and painted colored glass Christmas ornaments were a specialty of the glass factories in the [[Thuringian Forest]], especially in Lauscha in the late 19th century, and have since become a large industry, complete with famous-name designers. Baubles are another common decoration, consisting of small hollow glass or plastic spheres coated with a thin metallic layer to make them reflective, with a further coating of a thin pigmented polymer in order to provide coloration.
Lighting with electric lights (Christmas lights or, in the United Kingdom, fairy lights) is commonly done. A [[tree-topper]], sometimes an angel but more frequently a star, completes the decoration.

In the late 1800s, home-made white Christmas trees were made by wrapping strips of cotton batting around leafless branches creating the appearance of a snow-laden tree.
In the 1940s and 1950s, popularized by Hollywood films in the late 1930s,  [[flocking (texture)|flocking]] was very popular on the [[West Coast of the United States]]. There were home flocking kits that could be used with vacuum cleaners. In the 1980s some trees were sprayed with fluffy white flocking to simulate snow.

==Production==

[[File:Christmas tree for sale.jpg|thumb|Undecorated Christmas trees for sale]]
Each year, 33 to 36 million Christmas trees are produced in America, and 50 to 60 million are produced in Europe. In 1998, there were about 15,000 growers in America (a third of them "choose and cut" farms). In that same year, it was estimated that Americans spent $1.5 billion on Christmas trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apsnet.org/education/feature/1225tree/top.htm |title=The Christmas Tree |accessdate=December 8, 2006 |author=Gary A.

===Natural trees===
{{See also|Christmas tree cultivation}}
The most commonly used species are [[fir]] (''Abies''), which have the benefit of not shedding their needles when they dry out, as well as retaining good foliage color and scent; but species in other [[genus|genera]] are also used.

In northern [[Europe]] most commonly used are:
* [[Picea abies|Norway spruce]] ''Picea abies'' (the original tree, generally the cheapest)
* [[Abies alba|Silver fir]] ''Abies alba''
* [[Abies nordmanniana|Nordmann fir]] ''Abies nordmanniana''
* [[Noble fir]] ''Abies procera''
* [[Picea omorika|Serbian spruce]] ''Picea omorika''
* [[Scots pine]] ''Pinus sylvestris''
* [[Stone pine]] ''Pinus pinea'' (as small table-top trees)
* [[Swiss pine]] ''Pinus cembra''

In [[North America]], [[Central America]] and [[South America]] most commonly used are:
* [[Douglas fir]] ''Pseudotsuga menziesii''
* [[Abies balsamea|Balsam fir]] ''Abies balsamea''
* [[Fraser Fir]] ''Abies fraseri''
* [[Abies grandis|Grand fir]] ''Abies grandis''
* [[Abies guatemalensis|Guatemalan fir]] ''Abies guatemalensis''
* [[Noble fir]] ''Abies procera''
* [[Abies magnifica|Red fir]] ''Abies magnifica''
* [[Abies concolor|White fir]] ''Abies concolor''
* [[Colorado Pinyon|Pinyon pine]] ''Pinus edulis''
* [[Jeffrey pine]] ''Pinus jeffreyi''
* [[Scots pine]] ''Pinus sylvestris''
* [[Stone pine]] ''Pinus pinea'' (as small table-top trees)
* [[Araucaria heterophylla|Norfolk Island pine]] ''Araucaria heterophylla''

Several other species are used to a lesser extent. Less-traditional conifers are sometimes used, such as [[Sequoiadendron giganteum|giant sequoia]], [[Leyland cypress]], [[Cupressus macrocarpa|Monterey cypress]] and [[Juniperus virginiana|eastern juniper]]. Various types of [[spruce]] tree are also used for Christmas trees (including the [[Picea pungens|blue spruce]] and, less commonly, the [[Picea glauca|white spruce]]); but spruces begin to lose their needles rapidly upon being cut, and spruce needles are often sharp, making decorating uncomfortable. [[Pinus virginiana|Virginia pine]] is still available on some tree farms in the southeastern United States; however, its winter color is faded. The long-needled [[Pinus strobus|eastern white pine]] is also used there, though it is an unpopular Christmas tree in most parts of the country, owing also to its faded winter coloration and limp branches, making decorating difficult with all but the lightest ornaments. Norfolk Island pine is sometimes used, particularly in [[Oceania]], and in [[Australia]], some species of the genera ''[[Casuarina]]'' and ''[[Allocasuarina]]'' are also occasionally used as Christmas trees. But, by far, the most common tree is the [[Pinus radiata|Monterey pine]]. ''[[Adenanthos sericeus]]'' or Albany woolly bush is commonly sold in southern Australia as a potted living Christmas tree. [[Tsuga|Hemlock]] species are generally considered unsuitable as Christmas trees due to their poor needle retention and inability to support the weight of lights and ornaments.

Some trees, frequently referred to as "living Christmas trees", are sold live with roots and soil, often from a [[plant nursery]], to be stored at nurseries in planters or planted later outdoors and enjoyed (and often decorated) for years or decades. Others are produced in a container and sometimes as [[topiary]] for a porch or patio. However, when done improperly, the combination of root loss caused by digging, and the indoor environment of high temperature and low humidity is very detrimental to the tree's health; additionally, the warmth of an indoor climate will bring the tree out of its natural winter [[dormancy]], leaving it little protection when put back outside into a cold outdoor climate. Often Christmas trees are a large attraction for living animals, including mice and spiders. Thus, the survival rate of these trees is low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clemson.edu/extension/hgic/plants/other/seasonal/hgic1751.html |title=Living Christmas Trees |publisher=[[Clemson University]] |accessdate=July 12, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606222650/https://www.clemson.edu/extension/hgic/plants/other/seasonal/hgic1751.html |archive-date=2010-06-06 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when done properly, replanting provides higher survival rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.for.msu.edu/extension/ExtDocs/xmastree.htm |title=Christmas tree |publisher=Department of Forestry, [[Michigan State University]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315150004/http://www.for.msu.edu/extension/ExtDocs/xmastree.htm |archivedate=15 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

European tradition prefers the open aspect of naturally grown, unsheared trees, while in North America (outside western areas where trees are often wild-harvested on public lands)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blm.gov/co/st/en/BLM_Information/newsroom/2004/blm_and_forest_service0.html |title=BLM and Forest Service Christmas tree permits available |publisher=[[Bureau of Land Management]] |date=November 30, 2004 |accessdate=December 18, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140114174843/http://www.blm.gov/co/st/en/BLM_Information/newsroom/2004/blm_and_forest_service0.html |archive-date=2014-01-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; there is a preference for close-sheared trees with denser foliage, but less space to hang decorations.

In the past, Christmas trees were often harvested from wild forests, but now almost all are commercially grown on [[tree farm]]s. Almost all Christmas trees in the United States are grown on Christmas tree farms where they are cut after about ten years of growth and new trees planted. According to the [[United States Department of Agriculture]]'s agriculture census for 2007, 21,537 farms were producing conifers for the cut Christmas tree market in America, {{convert|5717.09|km2|acre|0}} were planted in Christmas trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.agcensus.usda.gov/Publications/2007/Online_Highlights/Specialty_Crops/speccrop.pdf |title=2007 Census of Agriculture: Specialty Crops (Volume 2, Subject Series, Part 8) |at=Table 1, page 1 |date=November 2009 |format=PDF |publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]] |access-date=2012-12-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216135500/http://www.agcensus.usda.gov/Publications/2007/Online_Highlights/Specialty_Crops/speccrop.pdf |archive-date=2013-02-16 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Christmas tree farm near New Germany, Nova Scotia, Canada.jpg|upright=4|thumb|center|A Christmas tree farm near [[New Germany, Nova Scotia]], Canada.]]
The life cycle of a Christmas tree from the seed to a {{convert|2|m|ft|0|adj=on}} tree takes, depending on species and treatment in cultivation, between 8 and 12 years. First, the seed is extracted from cones harvested from older trees. These seeds are then usually grown in nurseries and then sold to Christmas tree farms at an age of 3–4 years. The remaining development of the tree greatly depends on the climate, soil quality, as well as the cultivation and how the trees are tended by the Christmas tree farmer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.weihnachtsbaumversand.de/Wissenswertes:_:35.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071125213649/http://www.weihnachtsbaumversand.de/Wissenswertes%3A_%3A35.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=November 25, 2007 |title=Unsere kleine Baumschule — Wissenswertes |trans-title=Our little nursery: Trivia |language=de |year=2010 |accessdate=December 18, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate about the environmental impact of artificial trees is ongoing. Generally, natural tree growers contend that artificial trees are more environmentally harmful than their natural counterparts.&lt;ref name="hayes"/&gt; However, trade groups such as the [[American Christmas Tree Association]], continue to refute that artificial trees are more harmful to the environment, and maintain that the PVC used in Christmas trees has excellent recyclable properties.&lt;ref name="acta"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christmastreeassociation.org/Article%20Pages/facts-on-pvc-used-in-artificial-christmas-trees |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229105616/http://www.christmastreeassociation.org/Article%20Pages/facts-on-pvc-used-in-artificial-christmas-trees |dead-url=yes |archive-date=December 29, 2008 |title=Facts on PVC Used in Artificial Christmas Trees |publisher=[[American Christmas Tree Association]] |accessdate=December 21, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most artificial trees are made of recycled PVC rigid sheets using tin stabilizer in the recent years. In the past, [[lead]] was often used as a stabilizer in PVC, but is now banned by Chinese laws.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}
The use of lead stabilizer in Chinese imported trees has been an issue of concern among politicians and scientists over recent years.

Under the [[Marxist-Leninist atheism|Marxist-Leninist]] doctrine of [[state atheism]] in the Soviet Union, after its foundation in 1917, Christmas celebrations—along with other religious holidays—were prohibited as a result of the Soviet [[Anti-religious campaign during the Russian Civil War|anti-religious campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asia.rbth.com/articles/2010/12/15/and_so_is_this_christmas05210.html|title=And so, is this Christmas?|date=15 Dec 2010|author=Jennifer Eremeeva|work=[[Russia Beyond the Headlines]]|quote=Russian Christians adhere to the Eastern Orthodox calendar, which lags 13 days behind the modern day calendar.

Christmas was shifted to New Year's Eve. At the beginning, stringent measures were put in place to see off any holdover of the old days: Christmas trees, introduced to Russia by Tsar Peter The Great in the 17th Century, were banned in 1916 by the Holy Synod as too German.

Not teachers but the League's local set the programme for this special occasion.}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the Christmas tree being prohibited in accordance with [[Soviet anti-religious legislation]], people supplanted the former Christmas custom with New Year's trees.&lt;ref name="MIG"&gt;{{cite book |date=1993 |title=Echo of Islam |publisher=MIG |quote=In the former Soviet Union, fir trees were usually put up to mark New Year's day, following a tradition established by the officially atheist state.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dice2009"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dice |first=Elizabeth A. |date=2009 |title=Christmas and Hanukkah |publisher=Infobase Publishing |isbn=9781438119717 |page=44 |quote=The Christmas tree, or Yolka, is another tradition that was banned during the Soviet era.

[[Pope John Paul II]] introduced the Christmas tree custom to the Vatican in 1982. Although at first disapproved of by some as out of place at the centre of the Roman Catholic Church, the [[Vatican Christmas Tree]] has become an integral part of the Vatican Christmas celebrations,&lt;ref name="Stenhouse"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wantedinrome.com/news/2000419/christmas-the-vatican-christmas-tree.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730173019/http://www.wantedinrome.com/news/2000419/christmas-the-vatican-christmas-tree.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 30, 2013 |author=Margaret Stenhouse |title=The Vatican Christmas Tree |date=December 22, 2010 |accessdate=December 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2005 [[Pope Benedict XVI]] spoke of it as part of the normal Christmas decorations in Catholic homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.appleseeds.org/christmas-quotes.htm |title=Pre-Christmas Reflection: May Our Spirits Open to the True Spiritual Light |agency=Zenit News Agency |date=December 21, 2005 |accessdate=December 19, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625212305/http://www.appleseeds.org/christmas-quotes.htm |archive-date=2012-06-25 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Pope John Paul called the Christmas tree a symbol of Christ. This very ancient custom, he said, exalts the value of life, as in winter what is evergreen becomes a sign of undying life, and it reminds Christians of the "tree of life" of {{Bibleverse||Genesis|2:9}}, an image of Christ, the supreme gift of God to humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.zenit.org/article-11828?l=english |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071208101926/http://www.zenit.org/article-11828?l=english |dead-url=yes |archive-date=December 8, 2007 |title=Christmas tree is symbol of Christ, says Pope — And a Sign of 'Undying Life' |agency=Zenit News Agency |date=December 19, 2004 |accessdate=December 19, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the previous year he said: "Beside the crib, the Christmas tree, with its twinkling lights, reminds us that with the birth of Jesus the tree of life has blossomed anew in the desert of humanity.

In 2005, the city of Boston renamed the spruce tree used to decorate the Boston Common a "Holiday Tree" rather than a "Christmas Tree".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Boston's 'Holiday Tree' Sparks Controversy |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=510132 |work=[[The Harvard Crimson]] |date=November 28, 2005 |accessdate=January 8, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107035844/http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=510132 |archive-date=2007-11-07 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name change drew a poor response from the public and it was reversed after the city was threatened with several lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=At Christmas, what's in a name? |url=http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/ChristmasCountdown/story?id=1356566 |publisher=[[ABC News]] |date=November 29, 2005 |accessdate=19 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Update|reason=economics has changed with falling cost of renewables|date=November 2018}}

'''Clean coal technology''' is a collection of technologies being developed to attempt to help lessen the [[environmental impact of coal|environmental impact of coal energy generation]] and to mitigate worldwide [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_energy/coalvswind/c01.html |publisher=Union of Concerned Scientists |title= Coal vs. Wind |accessdate=2008-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; When coal is used as a fuel source, the gaseous emissions generated by the thermal decomposition of the coal include [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[nitrogen oxides]] (NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;), mercury, and other chemical byproducts that vary depending on the type of the coal being used. These emissions have been established to have a negative impact on the environment and human health, contributing to acid rain, lung cancer and cardiovascular disease. As a result, clean coal technologies are being developed to remove or reduce pollutant emissions to the atmosphere. Some of the techniques that would be used to accomplish this include chemically washing [[mineral]]s and impurities from the coal, [[gasification]] (see also [[Integrated gasification combined cycle|IGCC]]), improved technology for treating [[flue]] gases to remove pollutants to increasingly stringent levels and at higher efficiency, [[carbon capture and storage]] technologies to capture the carbon dioxide from the [[flue gas]] and dewatering lower rank coals ([[brown coal]]s) to improve the [[calorific value]], and thus the efficiency of the conversion into [[electricity]].  Concerns exist regarding the economic viability of these technologies and the timeframe of delivery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/30/fossilfuels-carbonemissions |publisher=The Guardian |title=Time to bury the ‘clean coal’ myth |accessdate=2008-12-23 | location=London | date=2008-10-30 | first=Fred | last=Pearce}}&lt;/ref&gt; potentially high hidden economic costs in terms of social and [[environmental degradation|environmental damage]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/international/press/reports/cost-of-coal.pdf |publisher=Greenpeace |title=The True Cost of Coal |accessdate=2008-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the costs and viability of disposing of removed carbon and other toxic matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/ccs/ |publisher=University of Edinburgh, School of Geosciences |title=Carbon Capture and Storage |accessdate=2008-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070219221240/http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/ccs |archivedate=2007-02-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2008/07/02/carbon-capture-storage.html |publisher=Discovery Channel |title=Carbon Capture Plans get Reality Check |accessdate=2008-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its original usage, the term "Clean Coal" was used to refer to technologies that were designed to reduce emission of pollutants associated with burning coal, such as washing coal at the mine.  This step removes some of the sulfur and other contaminants, including rocks and soil.  This makes coal cleaner and cheaper to transport.  More recently, the definition of clean coal has been expanded to include carbon capture and storage.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Silent Epidemic: Coal and the Hidden Threat to Health|last=Lockwood|first=Alan|publisher=The MIT Press|year=2012|isbn=9780262017893|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=2–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Clean coal technology usually addresses atmospheric problems resulting from burning coal.  Historically, the primary focus was on SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, the most important gases in causation of [[acid rain]], and particulates which cause visible air pollution and have [[Coal#Health effects|deleterious effects on human health]]. 

==Technology==
Several different technological methods are available for the purpose of carbon capture as demanded by  the clean coal concept:
*Pre-combustion capture – This involves [[gasification]] of a feedstock (such as coal) to form [[synthesis gas]], which may be [[water-gas shift reaction|shifted]] to produce a H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-[[rich burn|rich gas mixture]], from which the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be efficiently captured and separated, transported, and ultimately sequestered,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pre-combustion Carbon Capture Research|url=http://energy.gov/fe/science-innovation/carbon-capture-and-storage-research/carbon-capture-rd/pre-combustion-carbon|website=Energy.gov|publisher=Office of Fossil Energy, U.S. Department of Energy|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technology is usually associated with [[Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle]] process configurations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.technologyreview.com/Energy/18398/|title= Picking a Winner in Clean-Coal Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Post-combustion capture – This refers to capture of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from exhaust gases of combustion processes.
*[[Oxy-fuel combustion]] – Fossil fuels such as coal are burned in a mixture of recirculated [[flue gas]] and oxygen, rather than in air, which largely eliminates nitrogen from the flue gas enabling efficient, low-cost CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=R&amp;D Facts - Oxy-Fuel Combustion|url=http://www.netl.doe.gov/publications/factsheets/rd/R&amp;D127.pdf|publisher=National Energy Technology Laboratory, U.S. Department of Energy|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Kemper Project|Kemper County IGCC Project]], a proposed 582 [[Watt#Megawatt|MW]] [[coal gasification]]-based power plant, was expected to use pre-combustion capture of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to capture 65% of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; the plant produces, which would have been utilized and geologically sequestered in [[enhanced oil recovery]] operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IGCC Project Examples - Kemper County IGCC Project|url=http://www.netl.doe.gov/research/Coal/energy-systems/gasification/gasifipedia/project-examples#kemper|website=Gasifipedia|publisher=National Energy Technology Laboratory, U.S. Department of Energy|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, after many delays and a cost runup to $7.5 billion (triple the initial budget), the coal gasification project was abandoned and as of late 2017, Kemper is under construction as a cheaper [[natural gas]] power plant.&lt;ref name='ars_nat_gas_2017'&gt;{{cite news|last1=Geuss|first1=Megan|title=$7.5 billion Kemper power plant suspends coal gasification|url=https://arstechnica.com/business/2017/06/7-5-billion-kemper-power-plant-suspends-coal-gasification/ |publisher=Ars Technica|date=2017-06-29 |accessdate=2017-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Saskatchewan Government's [[Boundary Dam Power Station|Boundary Dam Integrated Carbon Capture and Sequestration Demonstration Project]] will use post-combustion, amine-based scrubber technology to capture 90% of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emitted by Unit 3 of the power plant; this CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will be pipelined to and utilized for enhanced oil recovery in the Weyburn oil fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boundary Dam Integrated Carbon Capture and Sequestration Demonstration Project|url=http://www.globalccsinstitute.com/project/boundary-dam-integrated-carbon-capture-and-sequestration-demonstration-project|publisher=Global CCS Institute|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Oxyfuel CCS fossil fuel power plant operation.png|thumb|right|An oxyfuel CCS power plant operation processes the exhaust gases so as to separate the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; so that it may be stored or sequestered]]
An early example of a coal-based plant using (oxy-fuel) carbon-capture technology is Swedish company [[Vattenfall]]’s [[Schwarze Pumpe power station]] located in [[Spremberg]], [[Germany]], built by German firm [[Siemens]], which went on-line in September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vattenfall.com/www/co2_en/co2_en/index.jsp |publisher=Vattenfall |title=Vattenfall's Project on CSS |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101026074817/http://www2.vattenfall.com/www/co2_en/co2_en/index.jsp |archivedate=2010-10-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="discovermagazine"/&gt; The facility captures CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and acid rain producing pollutants, separates them, and compresses the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into a liquid. Plans are to inject the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into depleted natural gas fields or other geological formations. Vattenfall opines that this technology is considered not to be a final solution for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction in the atmosphere, but provides an achievable solution in the near term while more desirable alternative solutions to power generation can be made economically practical.&lt;ref name="discovermagazine"&gt;http://discovermagazine.com/2009/feb/25-can-clean-coal-actually-work/?searchterm=clean%20coal "Can Clean Coal Actually Work?" article in Feb. 2009 issue, p. 18, Retrieved 2009-05-11&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples of oxy-combustion carbon capture are in progress. [[Callide Power Station]] has retrofitted a 30-MWth existing PC-fired power plant to operate in oxy-fuel mode; in Ciuden, Spain, Endesa has a newly built 30-MWth oxy-fuel plant using circulating fluidized bed combustion (CFBC) technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview of Oxy-fuel Combustion Technology for CO2 Capture|url=http://cornerstonemag.net/overview-of-oxy-fuel-combustion-technology-for-co2-capture/|website=Cornerstone Magazine|publisher=World Coal Association|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Babcock-ThermoEnergy's Zero Emission Boiler System (ZEBS) is oxy-combustion-based; this system features near 100% carbon-capture and according to company information virtually no air-emissions.&lt;ref&gt;[leads nowhere previously cited - http://ww25.thermoenergy.com/Zm9yY2VTUg]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other carbon capture and storage technologies include those that [[Dewatering|dewater]] low-rank coals. [[Coal rank|Low-rank coals]] often contain a higher level of moisture content which contains a lower energy content per tonne. This causes a reduced burning efficiency and an increased emissions output. Reduction of moisture from the coal prior to combustion can reduce emissions by up to 50 percent.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

The UK government is working towards a clean energy future and supported clean coal projects across the country. In August 2010, UK-based company [[B9 Coal]] announced a clean coal project with 90% carbon capture to be put forward to DECC. This proposed project was to create pure streams of hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The hydrogen was then to be used as an emissions-free fuel to run an [[AFC Energy|alkaline fuel cell]] whilst the carbon dioxide was to be captured.

==Demonstration projects in the United States==
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) began conducting a joint program with the industry and State agencies to demonstrate clean coal technologies large enough for commercial use. The program, called the Clean Coal Technology &amp; Clean Coal Power Initiative (CCPI), has had a number of successes that have reduced emissions and waste from coal-based electricity generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://energy.gov/fe/science-innovation/clean-coal-research/major-demonstrations/clean-coal-power-initiative | publisher= U.S. Department of Energy | title= Clean Coal Technology &amp; The Clean Coal Power Initiative }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Energy Technology Laboratory]] has administered three rounds of CCPI funding and the following projects were selected during each round:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.netl.doe.gov/technologies/coalpower/cctc/ccpi/index.html# |title= Major Demonstrations: Clean Coal Power Initiative (CCPI) |publisher= NETL |accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These programs have helped to meet regulatory challenges by incorporating pollution control technologies into a portfolio of cost-effective regulatory compliance options for conventional and developmental coal-fired power plants. This portfolio has positioned the U.S. as a top exporter of clean coal technologies such as those used for SOx, NOx and mercury, and more recently for carbon capture, consistent with a goal of deploying advanced coal-based power systems in commercial service with improved efficiency and environmental performance to meet increasingly stringent environmental regulations and market demands, leading to widespread, global deployment which will contribute to significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. The DOE continues its programs and initiatives through regional sequestration partnerships, a carbon sequestration leadership forum and the Carbon Sequestration Core Program, a CCS research and development program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.fossil.energy.gov/programs/sequestration/index.html | publisher=U.S. Department of Energy | title= Carbon Sequestration }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a report by the assistant secretary for fossil energy at the U.S. Department of Energy, clean coal technology has paid measurable dividends. Technological innovation introduced through the CCT Program now provides consumers cost-effective, clean, coal-based energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://fossil.energy.gov/programs/powersystems/publications/Clean_Coal_Topical_Reports/Investment_pays_off.pdf | publisher= U.S. Department of Energy | title= Clean Coal Technology: The Investment Pays Off}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clean coal and the environment==
{{Further|Environmental effects of coal}}

According to [[United Nations]] [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]], the burning of coal, a [[fossil fuel]], is a major contributor to  [[global warming]]. (See the UN [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]]).  As 26% of the world's electrical generation in 2004 was from coal-fired generation (see [[World energy resources and consumption]]), reaching the carbon dioxide reduction targets of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] will require modifications to how coal is utilized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ncseonline.org/NLE/CRSreports/Climate/clim-2.cfm?&amp;CFID=1255395&amp;CFTOKEN=96369856 |title= CRS Issue Brief for Congress - IB89005: Global Climate Change |publisher= National Council for Science and the Environment |date= August 13, 2001 |accessdate= 2008-09-13 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081226020613/http://www.ncseonline.org/NLE/CRSreports/Climate/clim-2.cfm?&amp;CFID=1255395&amp;CFTOKEN=96369856 |archivedate= December 26, 2008 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coal, which is primarily used for the generation of electricity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/coal/page/special/feature.html| publisher= Energy Information Administration | title=U.S. Coal Supply and Demand | accessdate=2009-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the second largest domestic contributor to carbon dioxide emissions in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cdiac.ornl.gov/trends/emis_mon/emis_mon_co2.html |title=Estimates of Monthly CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Emissions and Associated &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C/&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; Values from Fossil-Fuel Consumption in the U.S.A. | accessdate=2009-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The public has become more concerned about global warming which has led to new legislation.  The coal industry has responded by running advertising touting clean coal in an effort to counter negative perceptions and claiming  more than $50 billion towards the development and deployment of "traditional" clean coal technologies over the past 30 years; and promising $500 million towards carbon capture and storage research and development.&lt;ref name="ACCCE"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.americaspower.org/News/Press-Room/Press-Releases/ACCCE-Details-More-than-80-CO2-Capture-and-Storage-Projects | publisher= America's Power | title=ACCCE Details More than 80 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Capture and Storage Projects | accessdate=2009-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is still concern about clean coal technology being perceived as more environmentally friendly than it is, and the term "Clean Coal" has been used as an example of "[[greenwashing]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morris|first=Louise|date=2008-12-01|title=Greenwashing Coal|url=|journal=Chain Reaction|volume=104|pages=25|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Sierra Club, "Despite the industry's hype, there's no such thing as 'clean coal.'

Conjunction with enhanced oil recovery and other applications; commercial-scale CCS is currently being tested in the U.S. and other countries.{{by whom|date=November 2010}} Proposed CCS sites are subjected to extensive investigation and monitoring to avoid potential hazards, which could include leakage of sequestered CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to the atmosphere, induced geological instability, or contamination of water sources such as oceans and aquifers used for drinking water supplies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awwa.org/publications/MainStreamArticle.cfm?itemnumber=39815 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302185350/http://www.awwa.org/publications/MainStreamArticle.cfm?itemnumber=39815 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=March 2, 2009 |title=AWWA warns Congress about CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; injection concerns |publisher=American Water Works Association |date=July 29, 2008 |accessdate=2008-08-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ohvec.org/links/news/archive/2005/fair_use/10_16.html |title=‘Clean coal’ push concerns environmental activists |publisher=Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition |date=October 16, 2005 |accessdate=2008-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/green-science/clean-coal.htm|title=What is clean coal technology?|date=2007-07-18|work=HowStuffWorks|access-date=2018-05-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Great Plains Synfuels plant supports the technical feasibility of carbon dioxide sequestration. Carbon dioxide from the coal gasification is shipped to Canada where it is injected into the ground to aid in oil recovery. A drawback of the carbon sequestration process is that it is expensive compared to traditional processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |ssrn=1300126 |publisher=SSRN | title=Carbonomics: How to Fix the Climate and Charge it to OPEC |accessdate=2009-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Clean coal and health ==
Both traditional coal technology and clean coal technologies result in a release of hazardous air pollutants and many of them have an adverse affect on human health.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  According to Alan H. Lockwood, MD, coal is linked to diseases of the Respiratory System, Cardiovascular System, and Nervous System.  A key point that Dr. Lockwood brings up is that “the most obvious threats to health posed by the carbon capture and storage strategies… would occur in the event of the release of large amounts of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  The potential releases could occur at any of the stages: at the site of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture, during transport, or transfer… or escape during or after storage.” Dr. Lockwood goes on to explain that this can lead to “symptoms of death by displacing oxygen from inhaled air, leading to hypoxia and asphyxiation, or by causing symptomatic or fatal acidification of the blood and body fluids after inhalation” &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Comisión Federal de Electricidad''' ({{lang-en|Federal Electricity Commission}}) is the [[Government-owned corporation|state-owned]] [[electric utility]] of [[Mexico]], widely known as '''CFE'''. It is the country's dominant electric company, and the country's second most powerful state-owned company after [[Pemex]]. The Mexican [[Constitution of Mexico|constitution]] states that the government is responsible for the control and development of the national electric industry, and CFE carries out this mission. The company's slogan is "Una empresa de clase mundial" ("A World-Class Company").

==Affiliations==
[[File:Cfe building.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The CFE building in Mexico City]]
CFE is not a part of the [[North American Electric Reliability Corporation]], though its transmission system in northern [[Baja California]] is part of the [[Western Electricity Coordinating Council]] through its interconnection with [[San Diego Gas &amp; Electric]] via the Miguel-Tijuana and the LaRosita-Imperial Valley Lines and the [[Path 45]] corridor; it also has a few other interconnections across the border with local utilities in the [[United States]].

== Takeover of Luz y Fuerza del Centro ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2011}}
[[File:Luz y Fuerza 1903 a 2009.svg|thumb|left|150px|Logo of Luz y Fuerza del Centro]]
On 12 October 2009, President [[Felipe Calderón]] issued a decree dissolving Luz y Fuerza del Centro (LFC, also rendered on logo as "LyF"), the state-owned power company serving most of central Mexico—including [[Mexico City]], most of the [[State of Mexico]] and some communities in the states of [[Morelos]], [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]] and [[Puebla]].  The government claimed that spending had outpaced sales due in part to massive featherbedding, and it no longer made sense for the company to stay afloat.&lt;ref name="LYF"&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125530734212079359?mod=googlenews_wsj Mexico Power Takeover Creates Sparks ]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the government, spending at the company was increasingly outpacing sales &lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8301986.stm Mexico shuts down troubled energy firm]&lt;/ref&gt; CFE went on to control the national electric system and expand its operations nationwide, while the smaller LFC kept a low profile, maintaining its operations in the central region of Mexico.

LFC provided electricity to several states where, by virtue of a federal law, CFE had no operations (a 1985 agreement between CFE and LFC increased the areas served by the former).  As of March 2010, LFC's operations have been fully absorbed by CFE.

==Nickname==
[[File:Edificio CFE Matehuala, S.L.P.jpg|thumb|CFE building in [[Matehuala]], San Luis Potosí.]]
Since the CFE is the dominant electric company in [[Mexico]], most customers refer to it as "la comisión" (e.g. "The commission").{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} While there are other Mexican government commissions, the term is almost exclusively applied to the CFE.

== Controversies ==
Two corruption scandals in the US cite payments of bribes to officials at the CFE in return for contracts.

=== 2010 ===
In September 2010, [[ABB Group|ABB]], a Swiss corporation, admitted that ''ABB Network Management'', paid bribes to officials at CFE from 1997 to 2004, totaling approximately $1.9 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2010/September/10-crm-1096.html | title=ABB Ltd and Two Subsidiaries Resolve Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Investigation and Will Pay $19 Million in Criminal Penalties | author=Office of Public Affairs| publisher=US Department of Justice | date=29 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In exchange for the bribe payments, according to court documents, [[ABB Group|ABB]] received contracts worth more than $81 million in revenue.

The matter was resolved in September 2010 in a US court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2010/2010-175.htm | title=SEC Charges ABB For Bribery Schemes in Mexico and Iraq | author=Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Unit | publisher=US Securities and Exchange Commission| date=29 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2011 ===
In May 2011, Lindsey Manufacturing Company of the US was convicted by a US federal jury under the [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]] (FCPA) for their alleged roles in a scheme to pay bribes to officials at the CFE.

The bribes were paid through an intermediary, who allegedly had a corrupt relationship with a senior CFE official.&lt;ref name="USDoJ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2011/May/11-crm-596.html | title=California Company, Its Two Executives and Intermediary Convicted by Federal Jury in Los Angeles on All Counts for Their Involvement in Scheme to Bribe Officials at State-Owned Electrical Utility in Mexico| author=Office of Public Affairs | publisher=US Department of Justice | date=10 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lindsey Manufacturing allegedly received more than $19 million in CFE business over the course of seven years as a result of working through the intermediary.&lt;ref name="USDoJ" /&gt;

According to evidence presented at trial, the intermediary bought a CFE official a $297,500 [[Ferrari]] Spyder and a $1.8 million yacht, as well as paying more than $170,000 towards the official’s credit card bills.&lt;ref name="lindsey"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fcpablog.com/blog/2011/12/12/doj-tosses-aguilars-conviction-pending-appeal.html
| title= DOJ Tosses Aguilar's Conviction, Pending Appeal | author= Angela Gomez | publisher= The FCPA Blog | date=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2011, a US District Court dismissed the indictments against Lindsey Manufacturing, citing misconduct by the prosecution. The US Department of Justice (DOJ) said it planned to appeal the dismissal,&lt;ref name="lindsey" /&gt; but in May 2012 the government withdrew its appeal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fcpaprofessor.com/lindsey-manufacturing-case-officially-over&lt;/ref&gt;

===2016===

====Enrique Ochoa Reza  (President of PRI) and ''Comisión Federal de Electricidad'' violation  article 127 of Mexican Constitution  ====
In September 2016, as reported by Pablo Gomez from Aristegui Noticias, Enrique Ochoa Reza the President of the PRI, after working at the Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE) (Federal Commission of Electricity) for 2 years and 155 days, received $1,206,000 pesos of liquidation for voluntary retirement the CFE, despite the fact that as stipulated in the article 33 of the ''Manual de Trabajo de Servidores Publicos de Mando la CFE" (Rules for Work for Public Servers in Charge of the  CFE) those liquidations only apply after 3 years of service, and can not be paid to individuals who choose voluntary retirement. Such payment also goes against the Article 127 of the [[Mexican Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;http://aristeguinoticias.com/2909/mexico/enrique-ochoa-reza-pri-y-la-cfe-violaron-la-constitucion-articulo-de-pablo-gomez/&lt;/ref&gt; The [[President of Mexico]] [[Enrique Peña Nieto]] gave his opinion on the matter by saying: "En este tema que tanto lacera, el tema de la corrupcion, esta en todos los ordenes de la sociedad y en todos los ambitos, no hay alguien que pueda a atraverse a arrojar la primera piedra" ("This topic that is so much talked, topic of the corruption, is in every order of the society and in every ambit, there is no one capable of throwing the first stone.") This was seen as a [[biblical]] reference to the story where Jesus defends a woman caught in adultery by saying "He who is free of sin throw the first stone".&lt;ref&gt;http://aristeguinoticias.com/2909/mexico/en-que-estara-pensando-pena-nieto/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Darwin and His Great Discovery''''' is a [[science book]] for young adults by [[L. Sprague de Camp]] and [[Catherine Crook de Camp]], first published by [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] in 1972.&lt;ref name="Laughlin"&gt;{{cite book | last=Laughlin | first=Charlotte |author2=Daniel J. H. Levack | title=De Camp: An L. Sprague de Camp Bibliography | location=San Francisco | publisher=Underwood/Miller | year=1983 | page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Booklist"&gt;"Books for young adults" in ''The Booklist'', v. 69, no. 10, January 15, 1973, page 488.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The work is an examination of [[natural history|naturalist]] [[Charles Darwin]] and the [[theory]] of [[evolution]] he proposed and marshaled evidence for in ''[[The Origin of Species]]''. A brief account of his visit to the [[Galápagos Islands]] brings up the issue of [[Anthropogeny|human origins]], leading into a discussion of early theories on the formation and age of the earth and evolution. A biographical sketch of Darwin follows, covering his youth, his naturalistic studies on the voyage of the ''[[HMS Beagle|Beagle]]'' and subsequent life, focusing on his scientific researches and writings. The history of the theory of human evolution as currently understood is then presented, with sections on the work of [[Gregor Mendel|Mendel]], the development of the science of [[genetics]], and the [[Scopes Trial]]. It includes a selected bibliography and index.

==Reception==
Isadora Kunitz, writing in the ''Library Journal'', found the work a "well-written account of Charles Darwin's life and work," with "[d]etails about his personal life add[ing] to the interest of the book." She judged it "an excellent supplementary title for collections."&lt;ref name="LJ"&gt;Kunitz, Isadora. "The Book Review: Junior High Up" in ''Library Journal'', v. 97, no. 20, November 15, 1972, page 3812.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Booklist'' called it "[w]ell written, readable, and informative" and suitable for readers of junior high and high school age.&lt;ref name="Booklist"/&gt;

==Relation to other works==
The Scopes Trial was the subject of a comprehensive study previously written by L. Sprague de Camp, published as ''[[The Great Monkey Trial]]'' in 1968.

[[File:Disdrometer.jpg|thumb|A disdrometer in place in the [[Everglades]]]]

A '''disdrometer''' is an instrument used to measure the [[Raindrop size distribution|drop size distribution]] and [[velocity]] of falling [[hydrometeors]]. Some disdrometers can distinguish between [[rain]], [[graupel]], and [[hail]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.arm.gov/instruments/disdrometer&lt;/ref&gt;

The uses for disdrometers are numerous. They can be used for [[Air traffic control|traffic control]], scientific examination, airport observation systems, and [[hydrology]]. The latest disdrometers employ [[microwave]] or [[laser]] technologies. 2D video disdrometers can be used to analyze individual raindrops and [[snowflake]]s.&lt;ref&gt;https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/asl.376&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Vladimir Milov]], of the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]], says :

&lt;blockquote&gt;The "energy superpower" concept is an illusion with no basis in reality. Perhaps most dangerously, it doesn’t recognize the mutual [[energy dependency|dependence]] between Russia and energy consumers. Because of political conflicts and declining production, future supply disruptions to Europe are likely. As a result, European gas companies may likely someday demand elimination of the take-or-pay conditions in their Russian contracts. This would threaten Gazprom’s ability to borrow. Putin’s attempt to use energy to increase Russian influence could backfire in the long run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carnegieendowment.org/events/index.cfm?fa=eventDetail&amp;id=860 |title=How Sustainable is Russia's Future as an Energy Superpower? |publisher=Carnegieendowment.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Manik Talwani, a geophysicist at Rice University, there are two countries that are most likely to join Saudi Arabia in attaining the status of oil superpower: Venezuela and Canada.&lt;ref name=talwani&gt;[http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article4476.htm Canada: The next oil superpower?], by Manik Talwani. The New York Times 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Citing their enormous potential reserves (1.2 trillion potential barrels for Venezuela and 1.75 trillion for Canada's [[oil sand]]s), Talwani believes that they have the reserves to become energy superpowers in the next few decades as oil production declines elsewhere.  However, as Talwani notes, both need US$100 billion or more to increase their production levels up to those of true energy superpowers.

==Threats to energy superpowers==
[[File:Natural gas production world.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Countries where natural gas fields are located]]

In 2007, [[al-Qaeda]] announced a new strategy for fighting the [[United States]]. Rather than only targeting U.S. interests directly in an attempt to cripple it, al-Qaeda considers cutting off the supply of energy to the U.S. to be a high priority. As reported after a failed 2006 attempt in Saudi Arabia: 

: "A major supply disruption would send energy prices soaring. Had the [[Abqaiq]] attack been successful – guards fired on cars driven by the bombers, detonating the explosives inside – some experts say oil prices would have likely broken all records. A catastrophic hit could bring transportation and other parts of the U.S. and world economies to a standstill."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/story.html?id=c7352232-1809-44a8-9006-f269b0d623ea&amp;k=0 |first=Ian |last=MacLeod |publisher=CanWest News Service |title=Al-Qaeda calls for attacks on Canadian oil facilities |date=14 February 2007 |accessdate=2007-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403004138/http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/story.html?id=c7352232-1809-44a8-9006-f269b0d623ea&amp;k=0 |archivedate=2007-04-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Taku glacier firn ice sampling.png|thumb|right|Sampling the surface of a glacier.  There is increasingly dense firn between surface snow and blue glacier ice.]]
[[File:Firn field on the top of Säuleck.jpg|thumb|right|Firn field on the top of [[Säuleck]], [[Hohe Tauern]]]]
'''Firn''' ({{IPAc-en|f|ɪər|n}}; from [[Swiss German]] {{lang|gsw|firn}} "last year's", cognate with ''before'') is partially compacted [[névé]], a type of [[snow]] that has been left over from past seasons and has been [[Recrystallization (chemistry)|recrystallized]] into a substance denser than névé. It is [[ice]] that is at an intermediate stage between snow and glacial ice. Firn has the appearance of wet sugar, but has a hardness that makes it extremely resistant to shovelling. Its density generally ranges from 0.4&amp;nbsp;g/cm³ to 0.83&amp;nbsp;g/cm³,&lt;ref&gt;Cuffey and Paterson (2010), The Physics of Glaciers 4th Edition&lt;/ref&gt; and it can often be found underneath the snow that accumulates at the head of a [[glacier]].

[[Snowflake]]s are compressed under the weight of the overlying [[snowpack]]. Individual [[crystal]]s near the melting point are semiliquid and slick, allowing them to glide along other crystal planes and to fill in the spaces between them, increasing the ice's density. Where the crystals touch they bond together, squeezing the air between them to the surface or into bubbles.

In the summer months, the crystal metamorphosis can occur more rapidly because of water percolation between the crystals. By summer's end, the result is firn.

The minimum altitude that firn accumulates on a glacier is called the ''firn limit'', ''firn line'' or ''snowline''.

== Other uses ==
In colloquial and technical language, 'firn' is used to describe certain forms of [[Snow#By age|old snow or harsch]]:
* Old snowfields or [[névé]] (''Firnfelder''), even if the snow is not yet one year old
* the more recent snow layers of a glacier (a 'firned' glacier)
* the uppermost, soft layer of snow that is frozen overnight and, as a result of spring sunshine and high air temperatures, forms on an area of old snow or ''[[harsch]]'' (a slope ''firns up''; in Switzerland called ''Sulz'', but this term in Germany refers to a certain depth at which skiing downhill is no longer enjoyable)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2446">'''Flemish Energy Agency''' ({{lang-nl|Vlaams Energieagentschap}}; '''''VEA''''') is a government agency of the [[Flemish Region]] under the ''Flemish Ministry of Environment, Nature and Energy'', tasked with the preparation and execution of Flemish [[energy policy]]. 

==Overview==
The agency was created by a decision of the Flemish government dated April 16, 2004 as part of the government reform project ''Beter Bestuurlijk Beleid''. By a decision of the Flemish Government of March 31, 2006, the agency began operation on April 1, 2006. It is led by an Administrator-General, who is appointed by the [[Flemish government|Flemish Government]] for a renewable six year term.

The agency is made up out of the parts, responsible for energy, of the former Division of Natural Resources and Energy (ANRE) of the Flemish administration. It currently has some 50 employees.

The agency has its main office in [[Brussels|Brussel]] and has offices in [[Ghent|Gent]] and [[Hasselt]]. The agency employs a highly educated, technically trained staff, about two thirds of whom are engineers, legal and environmental protection specialists.

==Mission==
The Flemish Energy Agency has the following tasks:
* The promotion and support of the use of [[renewable energy]] and [[green energy]];
* The promotion and support of [[energy conservation]] by means of:
** building standards with regards to energy;
** emission trading;
** covenants with the industry;
** [[energy demand management]];
** reporting in the field of [[energy economics]];
* The development and execution of social energy policy;
* Communication to the industry and general public with regard to these aforementioned issues.

The agency works closely with other Flemish agencies and administrations, as well as with the federal and local governments to develop new decrees and regulations and to enforce existing energy regulations. To enforce the compliance to energy regulations, the agency has the power to impose administrative sanctions, for instance fines, as punishment for non-compliance.

As the samples cooled, the fluid shrank more than the surrounding mineral, and created a vapor bubble. Source: USGS]]
A '''fluid inclusions''' is a microscopic bubble of liquid and gas that is trapped within a [[crystal]]. As [[mineral]]s often form from a liquid or aqueous medium, tiny [[bleb (mineralogy)|bleb]]s of that liquid can become trapped within the crystal structure or in healed fractures within a crystal. These small inclusions range in size from 0.1 to 1&amp;nbsp;mm and are usually only visible in detail by microscopic study.

These inclusions occur in a wide variety of environments. For example, they are found within cementing minerals of [[sedimentary rocks]], in [[gangue]] minerals such as [[quartz]] or [[calcite]] in [[hydrothermal circulation]] deposits, in fossil [[amber]], and in deep [[ice cores]] from the [[Greenland]] and [[Antarctic]] ice caps. The inclusions can provide information about the conditions existing during the formation of the enclosing mineral.

Hydrothermal [[ore]] minerals typically form from high temperature aqueous solutions. The trapped fluid in an inclusion preserves a record of the composition, temperature and pressure of the mineralizing environment. An inclusion often contains two or more phases. If a vapor bubble is present in the inclusion along with a liquid phase, simple heating of the inclusion to the point of resorption of the vapor bubble gives a likely temperature of the original fluid. If minute crystals are present in the inclusion, such as [[halite]], [[sylvite]], [[hematite]], or sulfides are present, they provide direct clues as to the composition of the original fluid.

In the recent years, fluid inclusion research has been extensively applied to understand the role of fluids in the deep crust and crust-mantle interface. Fluid inclusions trapped within [[granulite]] facies rocks have provided important clues on the petrogenesis of dry granulite facies rocks through the influx of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-rich fluids from sub-lithospheric sources. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-rich fluid inclusions were also recorded from a number of ultrahigh-temperature granulite facies terranes suggesting the involvement of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in extreme crustal metamorphism. Some recent studies speculate that CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; derived by sub-solidus decarbonation reactions during extreme metamorphism has contributed to the deglaciation of the snowball Earth (Santosh and Omori, 2008).

[[image:Treesmed.gif|thumb|250px|This 84-million-year-old air bubble lies trapped in amber (fossilized tree sap). Using a quadrupole mass spectrometer, scientists can learn what the atmosphere was like when the dinosaurs roamed the earth. Source: USGS]]

[[Geology applications of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy|Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy]] can be used to determine the composition of fluid inclusions.&lt;ref name="Porchi"&gt;Mormone, A., Piochi, M., Bellatreccia, F., De Astis, G., Moretti, R., Della Ventura, G., &amp; Mangiacapra, A. (2011). A CO2-rich magma source beneath the Phlegraean Volcanic District (Southern Italy): Evidence from a melt inclusion study. Chemical Geology, 287(1), 66-80&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paleoclimate applications==
Trapped bubbles of air and water within fossil amber can be analyzed to provide direct evidence of the climate conditions existing when the resin or tree sap formed. The analysis of these trapped bubbles of air provides a record of atmosphere composition going back 140 million years. The data indicate that the oxygen content of the atmosphere reached a high of nearly 35% during the [[Cretaceous]] [[Geologic time scale|Period]] and then plummeted to near present levels during the early [[Tertiary]] [http://minerals.cr.usgs.gov/gips/na/amber.html]. The abrupt decline corresponds to or closely follows the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]] and may be the result of a major [[meteorite]] impact that created the [[Chicxulub Crater]].

Air bubbles trapped within the deep ice caps can also be analyzed for clues to ancient climate conditions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4263">The '''Jackson Prairie''' is a {{convert|611200|acre|ha|adj=on}}&lt;ref name=wildlife/&gt;  [[temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands|temperate grassland]] [[ecoregion]] in [[Mississippi]].  It is a [[Disjunct distribution|disjunct]] of the [[Black Belt (U.S. region)|Blackbelt (or Black Prairie)]]  [[Physical geography|physiographic]] area.&lt;ref name=attract&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/r8/mississippi/Bienville_RD/attractions.html |title=Harrell Prairie Botanical Area |publisher=[[United States Forest Service]] |accessdate=2009-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Description==
The prairie is a narrow strip across the state from the [[Mississippi River]] to the border of [[Alabama]].  It is only {{convert|40|mi|km}} across at its widest,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Federal Writers' Project, Federal Writers' Project Mississippi, Mississippi |title=Mississippi: A Guide to the Magnolia State |publisher=US History Publishers |date=1959 |isbn=978-1-60354-023-0 |page=34 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nb2ME6mgsAsC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;dq=%22Jackson+Prairie%22+mississippi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NPcAaou00J&amp;sig=MpwO-CAeWABIMMg1bCzzfCXqoL0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ru_WSdHKONjelQfF6IDlDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6#PPA34,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and generally {{convert|10|-|30|mi|km}} wide.  It runs in a diagonal line from near [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]] in the northwest, through [[Bienville National Forest]] and southeast to the Alabama border.&lt;ref name="plants"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lowe|first=Ephraim Noble|title=Plants of Mississippi: A List of Flowering Plants and Ferns|publisher=Hedermann Brothers|date=1921|page=47|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H4UUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA47&amp;lpg=PA47&amp;dq=%22Jackson+Prairie%22+mississippi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IEeUzlsUpl&amp;sig=UwbPRPAEmEXEERK6nI0DRxAR2b8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=w-zWSe31Fc3rlQfWmJzZDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4#PPA47,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contrast between the [[alkali]]ne [[Soil ph|soil]] of the prairies and the [[acid]]ic soil of the forests causes the sharp delineation in plant types in each region.  In the western portion of the prairie, the [[soil]] is a brown [[loess]] [[loam]] over [[calcareous]] [[clay]].  In hilly areas, the clay is covered by red and yellow [[sand]] from the [[Pliocene]] epoch.&lt;ref name=plants/&gt;  The underlying clay, an identifying component of the Jackson Prairie Belt, shrinks and swells dramatically based on the amount of rainwater.  Each cycle adds to the mounds and depressions, building them up over time.&lt;ref name=hiking/&gt; 

The prairies [[Fire ecology|depend on periodic outbreaks of fire]] to keep the forest from overgrowing the prairie.

==Flora and fauna==
The prairie used to support quantities of [[bobwhite quail]] (''Colinus virginianus''), [[wild turkey|eastern wild turkey]] (''Meleagris gallopavo silvestris''), and a variety of [[songbird]] species.

==Conservation==
Because of the soil and climate, this ecoregion is ideally suited for farming, leading to most of the prairie being converted into farmland and [[Agriculture|crop agriculture]]. There are a few remaining sections in the [[Bienville National Forest]], including the largest remaining undisturbed portion at the [[Harrell Prairie Botanical Area]].&lt;ref name="hiking"&gt;{{cite book |last=McGinnis |first=Helen |title=Hiking Mississippi: A Guide to Trails and Natural Areas |publisher=[[University Press of Mississippi]] |date=1995 |page=14 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n91BB7MB7N4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA14,M1|isbn=978-0-87805-664-4|accessdate=2009-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Grassland Reserve Program]] of 2002 enabled agencies to purchase [[conservation easement]]s to protect prairies.&lt;ref name=wildlife&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wildlifemiss.org/financial/prairie.htm |title=Grasslands Reserve Program |last=Cummins |first=James L. |publisher=Mississippi Fish and Wildlife Foundation |accessdate=2009-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513050135/http://www.wildlifemiss.org/financial/prairie.htm |archivedate=2008-05-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Karkar Geothermal Power Plant (Karkar GTPP)''' ({{lang-hy|Կարկառի երկրաջերմաէլեկտրակայան}}) is a proposed [[geothermal power plant]] to be constructed in [[Armenia]]. The plant will be the first of its kind in Armenia and will be situated at the [[Karkar, Armenia|Karkar]] site in the southernmost province of Armenia, [[Syunik Province|Syunik]].&lt;ref name="invest"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.invest-armenia.com/docs/AIF-Investment-Brochure.pdf|title=Investment Projects |website=Armenia Investment Forum|pages=19–20|access-date=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial studies envisage the construction of a 28-30 MW capacity geothermal power plant with an annual electric output of 250 million [[kilowatt hours]] (kWh) according to data provided in 2016.&lt;ref name="panarmenian"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.panarmenian.net/eng/news/217303/ |title=First-ever geothermal power station to be built in Armenia |date=19 July 2016 |website=PanArmenian.net|access-date=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Karkar GTPP will allow for the production of [[heat]] to be used in the heating of [[greenhouses]], residential buildings, and industrial sites.&lt;ref name="blogspot"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://geothermal-powerplant.blogspot.am/2010/08/jermaghbyur-geothermal-power-plant.html|title=Jermaghbyur Geothermal Power Plant|date=4 October 2009|website=Geothermal Power Plant/Geothermal Energy|access-date=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commissioned in 2008-2009, the Karkar GTPP is a unique project in Armenia in that it does not possess an analogue in the region, and positively differs from other energy producing [[power plants]] in its renewability of [[resources]], independence from imported energy sources, as well as its minimal environmental impact.&lt;ref name="blogspot"/&gt;

== Site selection ==
[[File:Thermal lake near Satan's bridge - panoramio.jpg|thumb|A thermal lake near [[Satani Kamurj]], [[Syunik Province]]]]
The Karkar site was selected for exploratory drilling on the basis of field investigations for the prospective sites of [[Jermaghbyur]] and Karkar, which were recognized as the most promising by both local and international geothermal experts.&lt;ref name="invest"/&gt; In 2006, the [[World Bank]] (WB) Energy Invest PIU contracted Ameria CJSC, a professional advisory and insurance services company registered in Armenia&lt;ref name="blogspot"/&gt; to draft a detailed [[feasibility study]] for the construction of the Karkar GTPP.&lt;ref name="renewable"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nature-ic.am/res/publications/brochures/Final_RE_Eng_Dec16.pdf |title=Use of Renewable Energy Sources in the World and Armenia/Through Innovations to Clear Technologies |year=2010 |location=Yerevan |pages=53–54 |access-date=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study was executed in the framework of a governmental plan aimed at diversifying energy sources in Armenia, and achieving greater independence from foreign imported energy sources.&lt;ref name="blogspot"/&gt; The results of the feasibility study demonstrated the possibility of constructing a [[Geothermal power#Flash steam power stations|flash type]] geothermal power plant functioning on the basis of 6 production [[boreholes]] at 2.5–3&amp;nbsp;km depth, and 2 boreholes for return flow at 3&amp;nbsp;km depth with an installed capacity of 25 MW. The necessary investment was estimated in the amount of 17.6 billion [[Armenian Dram|AMD]], with specific costs per kilowatt of installed capacity at US$1564. At the time of the study, the annual average electricity production was thought to be 199.4 million kWh.&lt;ref name="renewable"/&gt; That number has today grown to 250 million kWh.&lt;ref name="panarmenian"/&gt; The study demonstrated the strategic importance and effectiveness of using [[geothermal energy]] in Armenia for the provision of heat supply and the generation of [[electric power]].&lt;ref name="blogspot"/&gt;

The field investigations at the prospective sites, which included field scoutings, [[magnetotellurics|magnetotelluric]] (MT) sounding and 3D MT studies, along with independent interpretations of the results of these studies, were supported under the Geofund 2: Armenia Geothermal Project financed by the GEF and were completed in 2012.&lt;ref name="wbdoc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/741191468191058345/pdf/PAD1243-PAD-P152039-IDA-R2015-0100-1-Box391456B-PUBLIC-disclosed-6-9-15.pdf|title=International Bank for Reconstruction and Development Project Appraisal Document on a Proposed Strategic Climate Fund Grant in the Amount of US$8.55 Million to the Republic of Armenia for a Geothermal Exploratory Drilling Project |date=18 May 2015 |website=The World Bank |pages=14–15 |access-date=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exploratory Drilling ==
The Geothermal Exploratory Drilling Project (GEDP) is a new project consisting of two independent stages, which aim to confirm the suitability of the geothermal resource at the Karkar field for electric power generation. If confirmed, future steps will include involvement of the private sector in the development of a geothermal power plant. Geothermal resources differ from other [[renewable energy]] sources, such as [[wind]], [[solar energy|solar]] and [[Hydropower|hydro]] in that the commercial exploitability of a geothermal field largely depends on its meeting of certain specific parameters of [[temperature]] and [[pressure]]. These parameters may be considered with sufficient confidence only upon viable assessment of the results of exploratory drillings.&lt;ref name="worldbank"/&gt;

The GEDP was implemented with the support of the World Bank. On Monday, 8 June 2016 the [[World Bank]] Board of Executive Directors approved a US$8.55 million grant for the realization of the first stage of the project, with Arthur Kochnakyan appointed as the World Bank Task Team Leader for the project. The objective of the Government of Armenia is to construct a geothermal power plant at the Karkar site upon confirmation of the availability of exploitable geothermal resources.&lt;ref name="worldbank"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2015/06/08/world-bank-supports-exploration-of-geothermal-resources-in-armenia|title=World Bank Supports Geothermal Resources in Armenia |date=8 June 2015 |website=The World Bank |access-date=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a total potential for [[geothermal power]] currently estimated at approximately 150MW, indigenous Armenian geothermal resources have the potential to become an affordable source of [[base load]] electricity, in turn contributing to the country's [[Ministry of Energy Infrastructures and Natural Resources#Energy security|energy security]].&lt;ref name="wbdoc"/&gt;

== Initial stage ==
Initial exploration consists of drilling of three separate wells 1500 m deep, which will require the use of the US$9 million provided by the [[Climate Investment Funds]] and the 2 million AMD supplied by the Government of Armenia.&lt;ref name="panarmenian"/&gt; The much-needed involvement of commercial investors for the funding of the resource validation phase of the project has been greatly deterred by a combination of high capital requirements, with drilling costs typically ranging between US$2 and US$5 million per well, highly uncertain results, and the time required for its completion.&lt;ref name="wbdoc"/&gt; The R2E2 Fund, a non-profit organization established by the Government of Armenia in 2005 with the specific objective of promoting development of [[Renewable energy in Armenia|renewable energies]] and energy efficiency markets in Armenia, will be responsible for the implementation of the project.&lt;ref name="worldbank"/&gt; The Fund has the required capacity and necessary experience in implementing Bank financed projects.&lt;ref name="worldbank"/&gt;

July 2016 saw the construction of the first slim well for exploratory purposes. An access road to the Karkar site was previously constructed to allow for the transportation and installation of rig pads required for drilling of the slim well(s), as well as other infrastructures. Should primary drilling yield positive results, a full feasibility study of the area will be completed to provide necessary information regarding the type of geothermal technology to be installed at the site. The feasibility study will also allow for the determination of future economic and financial performance estimates, as well as for helping find solutions to issues ranging from compliance with environmental and social safeguards to legal and regulatory concerns. The contribution of the Government of Armenia to the project is expressed in the form of land provision, support in obtaining all the necessary permits, co-financing of taxes, supporting the construction of [[transmission lines]] and the infrastructure demanded at the site, as well as the provision of [[tax exemptions]].&lt;ref name="invest"/&gt;

During a policy seminar held on 23 September 2016 regarding "The Challenges of Energy Security in Armenia",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://armenpress.am/arm/news/819604/nacionalizaciya-esa-E28093-ne-reshenie-voprosa-areg-galstyan.html|title=ՀԷՑ-ի ազգայնացունը հարցի լուծում չէ. Արեգ Գալստյան|last=|first=|date=23 September 2015|website=ArmenPress|publisher=|language=Armenian|access-date=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ministry of Energy Infrastructures and Natural Resources|Deputy Minister of Energy Infrastructures and Natural Resources of Armenia]], [[Areg Galstyan]], announced that the first results of exploratory drilling of geothermal sources were due in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arka.am/en/news/technology/first_results_of_exploratory_drilling_of_geothermal_sources_in_armenia_expected_in_2016/ |title=First Results of Exploratory Drilling of Geothermal Sources in Armenia Expected in 2016 |date=23 September 2015 |website=Arka |access-date=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a latter interview given on 27 October 2016, the same deputy minister informed journalists of the completion of the appraisal of geothermal resources in the Karkar site with optimistic first results for the survey, particularly with regards to compliance of specific temperature and pressure requirements.&lt;ref name="energycentral"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energycentral.com/news/deputy-minister-armenia-has-all-prerequisites-construction-geothermal-power-plant |title=Deputy minister/ Armenia has all prerequisites for construction of a geothermal power plant |date=27 October 2016 |website=Energy Central |access-date=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A final assessment of the area's geothermal power capacity is to be drafted on the basis of the results obtained upon completion of the exploratory drilling stage.&lt;ref name="panarmenian"/&gt;

== Second stage ==
The second stage of GEDP envisages the construction phase of the geothermal power station.&lt;ref name="worldbank"/&gt;&lt;ref name="energycentral"/&gt; Initial construction costs of the geothermal power plant are projected to be US$90 million to 110 million,&lt;ref name="invest"/&gt; which are to be subsidized by public and private capital (i.e commercial debt and equity) in accordance with a specific financing plan of the Government of Armenia.&lt;ref name="wbdoc"/&gt; An international tender is to be announced based on the final results of the exploratory drillings to attract investors for the development of the plant, where priority will be given to the lowest bidder.&lt;ref name="panarmenian"/&gt;

In the event of its construction, the Karkar Geothermal Power Plant is set to occupy an approximate area of 1.5 hectares, which will include [[piping]] and parking areas, warehouses and maintenance facilities, a fluid storage house, workers' quarters, and associated facilities pursuant to the building footprint of the future plant. A total of 4 to 10 production and [[injection well]]s with casing diameters of 18 5/8 inches at the surface narrowing to 7 inches at 1250 meters are to be drilled and installed to harness the heat of the rocks situated at similar depths.&lt;ref name="invest"/&gt; The heat trapped by these rocks reach temperatures of 99&amp;nbsp;°C at depths of 920 meters, escalating towards 250-300&amp;nbsp;°C at 2500–3000 meters as demonstrated by the Jermaghbyur borehole data.&lt;ref name="renewable"/&gt;

[[File:Satélite Mancha de Montearagón.JPG|250px|thumb|La Mancha de Montearagón subregion]]
'''La Mancha''' ({{IPA-es|la ˈmantʃa}}) is a [[natural region|natural]] and [[historical region]] located on an arid but fertile elevated plateau (610 m or 2000&amp;nbsp;ft.) of central [[Spain]], south of [[Madrid]], from the mountains of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] to the western spurs of the hills of [[Cuenca, Spain|Cuenca]], and bordered to the south by the [[Sierra Morena]] and to the north by the [[Alcarria]] region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Mancha, La |volume=17 |page=542}}&lt;/ref&gt;
La Mancha includes portions of the modern provinces of [[Province of Cuenca|Cuenca]], [[Toledo (province)|Toledo]], and [[Albacete]], and most of the [[Ciudad Real]] province. La Mancha historical comarca constitutes the southern portion of [[Castilla-La Mancha]] [[autonomous community]] and makes up most of the present-day administrative region.

==Name==
The name "La Mancha" is probably derived from the Arab word المنشا ''al-mansha'', meaning  "the dry land" or "wilderness". The name of the city of [[Almansa]] in [[Albacete]] also has the same origin.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090426054426/http://culturitalia.uibk.ac.at/hispanoteca/Landeskunde-Spanien/Autonom%C3%ADas/AUTONOM%C3%8DAS/CASTILLA-LA%20MANCHA.htm Castilla-La Mancha&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''mancha'' in Spanish literally means ''spot'', ''stain'', or ''patch'', but no apparent link exists between this word and the name of the region.

==Geography==
[[Image:Meseta herd.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Pastures and sheep in La Mancha]]
The largest plain in Spain, La Mancha is made up of a [[plateau]] averaging 500 to 600 metres in altitude (although it reaches 900 metres in Campo de Montiel and other parts), centering on the province of Ciudad Real. The region is watered by the [[Guadiana]], Jabalón, [[Záncara]], Cigüela, and [[Júcar]] rivers. 
[[File:Paisaje La Mancha.jpg|thumb|250px|Landscape of the fields in La Mancha]]

==Climate==
The climate is cold semi-arid (Köppen ''BSk''), with strong fluctuations. Farming (wheat, barley, oats, sugar beets, wine grapes, olives) and cattle raising are the primary economic activities, but they are severely restricted by the harsh environmental conditions.

==Culture==
[[File:Aquila adalberti.jpg|thumb|The [[Spanish imperial eagle]] can be found mostly in the region of La Mancha.|250px]]
Culturally, La Mancha includes the Sierra de Alcaraz, northern [[Sierra Morena]], Montes de Toledo and Serranía de Cuenca, parts of [[Tajo]] river valley, and it is administratively divided among the comarcas of Campo de Montiel and Campo de ras de Ocaña y [[Manchuela]] to the north.

The inhabitants are called ''Manchegos''.

==Agriculture==
La Mancha has always been an important agricultural zone. [[Viticulture]] is important in [[Tomelloso]], [[Alcázar de San Juan]], [[Socuéllamos]],  [[Valdepeñas]], [[La Solana]]  and [[Manzanares, Ciudad Real|Manzanares]], in [[Ciudad Real (province)|Ciudad Real]] and [[Villarrobledo]] in [[Albacete (province)|Albacete]].  Other crops include cereals (hence the famous [[windmill]]s) and [[saffron]].  Sheep are raised and bred, providing the famous [[Manchego cheese]], as are goats, including the [[La Mancha goat]], one of the assumed progenitors of the [[American La Mancha goat]].

La Mancha includes two National Parks, [[Las Tablas de Daimiel]] and [[Cabañeros National Park|Cabañeros]], and one Natural Park, Las Lagunas de Ruidera.

==People==
Famous Spaniards like the cinema directors [[Pedro Almodóvar]] and [[José Luis Cuerda]], painters [[Antonio López García|Antonio López]] and his uncle Antonio López Torres, footballer [[Andrés Iniesta]], music band [[Angelus Apatrida]] and actress [[Sara Montiel]] were born in La Mancha.

==La Mancha and Cervantes==
[[File:Don Quixote Inn in La Mancha.jpg|thumb|300px|Don Quixote Inn in La Mancha, Spain]]
[[File:Don Quixote statue.jpg|thumb|300px|Don Quixote statue at La Mancha Inn, Spain]]
[[Miguel de Cervantes]] described La Mancha and its [[windmill]]s in his novel ''[[Don Quixote|Don Quixote de La Mancha]]''. Cervantes was making fun of the region, using a pun; a "mancha" was also a stain, as on one's honor, and thus an inappropriately-named homeland for a dignified knight-errant.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110724030754/http://www.anoisewithin.org/docs/Mancha_StudyGuide.pdf A Noise Within]&lt;/ref&gt; Translator [[John Ormsby (translator)|John Ormsby]] believed that Cervantes chose it because it was the most ordinary, prosaic, anti-romantic, and therefore unlikely place from which a chivalrous, [[romantic hero]] could originate, making Quixote seem even more absurd. However, due to the fame of Cervantes' character, the name of La Mancha did become associated worldwide with romantic chivalry.

Several film versions of ''Don Quixote'' have actually been filmed largely in La Mancha. However, some, including the 1957 Russian film version, and the screen version of ''Man of La Mancha'', were not. The 1957 film was shot in [[Crimea]], while ''[[Man of La Mancha (film)|Man of La Mancha]]'' was filmed in Italy. [[G.W. Pabst]]'s 1933 version of Cervantes's novel was shot in [[Alpes-de-Haute-Provence]]. The 2000 made-for-TV ''[[Don Quixote (2000 TV film)|Don Quixote]]'', starring [[John Lithgow]] as Don Quixote and [[Bob Hoskins]] as Sancho Panza, was shot on several locations in Spain, but not in La Mancha.

''[[Euphorbia]]'' is a highly diverse [[plant]] [[genus]], comprising some 5,000 currently accepted taxa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tropicos.org/NameSearch.aspx?name=Euphorbia | title=Tropicos - Name Search}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is an alphabetical '''list of the ''Euphorbia'' species''' and notable intraspecific [[taxa]].

The list includes the former (and never generally accepted) genus ''Chamaesyce'', as well as the related genera ''Elaeophorbia'', ''Endadenium'', ''Monadenium'', ''Synadenium'' and ''Pedilanthus'' which according to recent [[DNA sequence]]-based [[phylogenetic]] studies are all nested within ''Euphorbia''&lt;ref name = dnaphylogeny&gt;Steinmann &amp; Porter (2002), Steinmann (2003), Bruyns ''et al.'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Noticeably [[succulent plant]]s are marked by (s).

(In the [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/World_top_peak_prominence.svg SVG version], hover over a peak to highlight its parent(s) and click it to view its article.)]]
This is a list of [[mountain]] peaks ordered by their [[topographic prominence]].

==Terminology==
The prominence of a peak is the minimum height of climb to the summit on any route from a higher peak, or from sea level if there is no higher peak. The lowest point on that route is the [[col]].

For full definitions and explanations of ''topographic prominence'', ''key col'', and ''parent'', see [[topographic prominence]]. In particular, the different definitions of the parent of a peak are addressed at length in that article. ''Height'' on the other hand simply means elevation of the summit above sea level.

Regarding parents, the ''prominence parent'' of peak A can be found by dividing the island or region in question into territories, by tracing the runoff from the key col ([[mountain pass]]) of every peak that is more prominent than peak A. The parent is the peak whose territory peak A resides in.

The ''encirclement parent'' is found by tracing the contour below peak A's key col and picking the highest mountain in that region. This is easier to determine than the prominence parent; however, it tends to give non-intuitive results for peaks with very low cols such as Jabal Shams which is #110 in the list.

Note that either sort of parent of a typical very high-prominence peak such as [[Denali]] will lie far away from the peak itself, reflecting the independence of the peak.

Most sources (and the table below) define no parent for island and landmass highpoints; others treat Mount Everest as the parent of every such peak with the ocean as the "key col".

In the table below, where a single parent is listed, the different definitions agree; where two are given, the prominence parent is marked "&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;", and the encirclement parent "²".

==Prominence table==
The following sortable table lists the Earth's 125 most topographically prominent summits. Of these, [[China]] has the most: 16. Close behind it are [[Indonesia]], with 13, and the [[United States]] with 12.

==Additional peaks==
The list of peaks that follow is not complete, but the peaks are all notable. Note that island high points (whose prominence is equal to their elevation) can be found at the [[List of islands by highest point]]; hence most are not included below. Some well-known peaks listed here do not score highly by prominence.

All peaks with a prominence of more than 1,500 metres rank as an [[Ultra-prominent peak|Ultra]]. For a complete listing of all 1,524 peaks with prominence greater than this level, see the [[Ultra-prominent peak#Lists of ultras|lists of Ultras]].

==Notes==
&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;.{{note|b}}By convention, cols created by human activity are not counted. Therefore, the [[Suez Canal|Suez]], [[Panama Canal|Panama]] and other canals are ignored in these calculations. Cuts that lower the natural elevations of mountain passes are also ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peaklist.org/WWlists/WorldTop50.html|title=PEAKLIST.ORG - World Top 50 Prominence|first=Aaron|last=Maizlish|date=|website=www.peaklist.org|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towers, monuments and similar on the peaks are also ignored.

'''Rivers of Lithuania''' are typical lowland rivers: they are slow, they make [[meander]]s, the valleys are wide. Because of abundant precipitation, the river net is dense: on the average 0.99&amp;nbsp;km of rivers flow in 1&amp;nbsp;km² of the territory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/fi/fcp/en/LTU/profile.htm The Republic of Lithuania], Fishery Country Profile, [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the United Nations, May 2005. Accessed June 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the rivers are not evenly distributed. The highest density is in the [[Samogitia]]n Highlands where it rains more often and in the northern Lithuania where the soil has clay and it does not allow the water to drain underground. The lowest density is in the southeastern Lithuania where the soil has a lot sand and the rainwater quickly ooze into the underground. 

Almost 70% (some 49,600&amp;nbsp;km²) of the territory of Lithuania are drained by the [[Neman River]] and its tributaries. The other 5 river basins are small and located nears the borders: [[Mūša]]-[[Nemunėlis]] ([[Lielupe]]; 8,976&amp;nbsp;km²), [[Venta River|Venta]] (5,140&amp;nbsp;km²), [[Daugava River|Daugava]] (1,857&amp;nbsp;km²), small rivers flowing into the [[Baltic Sea]] (2,523&amp;nbsp;km²) and [[Pregolya]] (54&amp;nbsp;km²). During the winter all rivers freeze over. In the spring almost all rivers flood from melting snow and ice. However, usually only in the Neman River delta the water bursts out of the valley. Nowadays floods are controlled by dams and also due to drainage most rivers have lower water levels than they used to have. In the western Lithuania rivers tend to irregularly flood during the fall because of excessive rains. In the eastern Lithuania rivers tend to discharge a constant amount of water because they are regulated by flow-through lakes and sandy soil, which quickly absorbs any excess rain or snow water. 

During the Soviet times (1945-1990) rivers suffered a lot of damage because of [[drainage]]. Many swamps were drained and now they cannot feed the rivers anymore. Other smaller rivers were straightened and turned into drainage canals.

[[Lithuania]] counts around 29 thousand watercourses, longer than 0.25&amp;nbsp;km. The total length of all these watercourses would be around 65,000&amp;nbsp;km. The number of rivers and rivulets longer than 3&amp;nbsp;km has been calculated very precisely – 4,418. 758&lt;ref name=geo&gt;Stasys Vaitiekūnas, Elena Valančienė, Lietuvos geografija (Geography of Lithuania), Alma littera, 2004, page 65. {{ISBN|9955-08-534-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; rivers are longer than 10&amp;nbsp;km. Lithuania has 21 rivers longer than {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}}:

The [[Virvyčia]] (99.7&amp;nbsp;km) is just shy of the 100&amp;nbsp;km limit. The length of the [[Žeimena]] is an object of discussion; it could be up to 114&amp;nbsp;km. 

Note: length in Lithuania also includes the length of rivers when they serve as borders with neighboring countries.

'''Mount San Cristobal''' is a [[dormant volcano|dormant]] [[volcano]] in [[Quezon province]] on the island of [[Luzon]], [[Philippines]]. The mountain rises to an elevation of {{convert|1470|m|abbr=on}} [[above mean sea level]] &lt;ref name="pinoymountaineer" /&gt; and is one of the volcanic features of  [[Macolod Corridor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tectonophysics|date=1990|publisher=Elsevier Science Publishers|location=Amsterdam|page=266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mount San Cristobal is considered the Devil's mountain in Filipino folklore. It is the alter-ego of the Holy Mountain,&lt;ref name=pinoymountaineer&gt;{{cite web|title=Mt. Cristobal (1,470+)|url=http://www.pinoymountaineer.com/2007/09/mt-cristobal-1470.html|website=Pinoy Mountaineer|accessdate=5 February 2015|date=23 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mount Banahaw]], and is part of [[Mounts Banahaw–San Cristobal Protected Landscape]] covering 10,901 hectares (26,940 acres) of land.

The mountain is bounded by [[San Pablo, Laguna|San Pablo]], province of [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]] at its northern slope and [[Dolores, Quezon|Dolores]], province of [[Quezon (province)|Quezon]] at its southern slope.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5365">In [[Norse mythology]], '''Mímameiðr''' ([[Old Norse]] "[[Mímir|Mimi's]] tree"&lt;ref name=SIMEK216&gt;Simek (2007:216)&lt;/ref&gt;) is a tree whose branches stretch over every land, is unharmed by fire or [[metal]], bears fruit that assists pregnant women, and upon whose highest bough roosts the cock [[Víðópnir]]. Mímameiðr is solely attested in the Old Norse poem ''[[Fjölsvinnsmál]]''. Due to parallels between descriptions of the two, scholars theorize that ''Mímameiðr'' may be another name for the world tree [[Yggdrasil]], and also [[Hoddmímis holt]], a wood within which [[Líf and Lífthrasir]] are foretold to take refuge during the events of [[Ragnarök]]. ''Mímameiðr'' is sometimes modernly anglicized as '''Mimameid''' or '''Mimameith'''.&lt;ref name=ANGLICIZATIONS&gt;The anglicization ''Mimameid'' is used in such modern works as Lindow (2001:232), whereas ''Mimameith'' appears in Bellows (1923:242).&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Fjölsvinnsmál''==
Mímameiðr is mentioned in stanzas of the eddic-meter poem ''Fjölsvinnsmál'', where the tree is described as having limbs that stretch over every land, bearing helpful fruit, and as harboring the cock Víðópnir. The first mention occurs when [[Svipdagr]] asks [[Fjölsviðr]] to tell him what the name of the tree whose branches reach over every land. Fjolsvith responds that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
{|
|
::&lt;small&gt;[[Benjamin Thorpe]] translation:&lt;/small&gt;
:Mimameidir it is called;
:but few men know from what roots it springs:
:it by that will fall which fewest know.
:Nore fire nor iron will harm it.&lt;ref name=THORPE98&gt;Thorpe (1907:98).&lt;/ref&gt;
|
::&lt;small&gt;[[Henry Adams Bellows (businessman)|Henry Adams Bellows]] translation:&lt;/small&gt;
:"Mimameith its name, and no man knows
:What root beneath it runs;
:And few can guess what shall fell the tree,
:For fire nor iron shall fell it."&lt;ref name=BELLOWS242&gt;Bellows (1923:242).&lt;/ref&gt;
|
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This stanza is followed by another where Svipdagr asks Fjölsviðr what grows from the seed of the tree. Fjölsviðr responds that fruit grows from the tree:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
{|
|
::&lt;small&gt;Benjamin Thorpe translation:&lt;/small&gt;
:Its fruit shall on the fire be laid,
:for labouring women;
:out then will pass what would in remain:
:so is it a creator of mankind."&lt;ref name=THORPE98/&gt;
|
::&lt;small&gt;Henry Adams Bellows translation:&lt;/small&gt;
:"Women, sick with child shall seek
:Its fruit to the flames to bear;
:Then out shall come what within was hid,
:And so is it mighty with men."&lt;ref name=BELLOWS243&gt;Bellows (1923:243).&lt;/ref&gt;
|
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the notes to his translation of this stanza, Bellows comments this stanza is to be understood as explaining that, when cooked, the fruit of Mímameiðr—which he identifies as Yggdrasil—will assure safe childbirth.&lt;ref name=BELLOWS243/&gt;

A third mention occurs when Svipdagr tells Fjölsviðr to tell him what the name of the glittering, golden cock is that sits "on the highest bough". Fjölsviðr complies, revealing that the cock is named Víðópnir:

==Theories==
Scholar [[Rudolf Simek]] connects Mímameiðr with [[Mímisbrunnr]] ("Mímir's well"), which is located beneath one of the three roots of the cosmological tree Yggdrasil. Simek concludes that due to the location of the well, ''Mímameiðr'' is potentially another name for Yggdrasil. In addition, Simek says that [[Hoddmímis holt]] ("Hoard-[[Mímir]]'s" [[Woodland|holt]])—a wood whose name refers to the same figure and wherein Líf and Lífþrasir survive [[Ragnarök]]—may also be another name for Yggdrasil, and therefore is likely the same location as Mímameiðr.&lt;ref name=SIMEK216AND154&gt;Simek (1995:216 and 154).&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar [[John Lindow]] concurs, noting that if the figures within the location names are the same, then the identification of all the locations as within close vicinity is likely.&lt;ref name=LINDOW179&gt;Lindow (2001:179).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mössbauer effect''', or '''recoilless nuclear resonance fluorescence''', is a physical phenomenon discovered by [[Rudolf Mössbauer]] in 1958. It involves the resonant and [[Atomic recoil|recoil]]-free emission and absorption of [[gamma ray|gamma radiation]] by atomic nuclei bound in a solid. Its main application is in [[Mössbauer spectroscopy]].

In the Mössbauer effect, a narrow resonance for nuclear gamma emission and absorption results from the momentum of recoil being delivered to a surrounding crystal lattice rather than to the emitting or absorbing nucleus alone. When this occurs, no gamma energy is lost to the kinetic energy of recoiling nuclei at either the emitting or absorbing end of a gamma transition: emission and absorption occur at the same energy, resulting in strong, resonant absorption.

==History==

The emission and absorption of [[X-ray]]s by gases had been observed previously, and it was expected that a similar phenomenon would be found for [[gamma ray]]s, which are created by [[atomic nucleus|nuclear]] transitions (as opposed to X-rays, which are typically produced by [[electron]]ic transitions).  However, attempts to observe nuclear resonance produced by gamma-rays in gases failed due to energy being lost to recoil, preventing resonance (the [[Doppler effect]] also broadens the gamma-ray spectrum).  Mössbauer was able to observe resonance in nuclei of solid [[iridium]], which raised the question of why gamma-ray resonance was possible in solids, but not in gases. Mössbauer proposed that, for the case of atoms bound into a solid, under certain circumstances a fraction of the nuclear events could occur essentially without recoil. He attributed the observed resonance to this recoil-free fraction of nuclear events.

The Mössbauer effect was one of the last major discoveries in physics to be originally reported in the German language. The first report in English was a letter describing a repetition of the experiment.&lt;ref&gt;

The discovery was rewarded with the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1961 together with [[Robert Hofstadter]]'s research of [[electron scattering]] in atomic nuclei.

==Description==
[[File:MössbauerSpectrum57Fe.svg|thumb|right|250px|Mössbauer absorption spectrum of &lt;sup&gt;57&lt;/sup&gt;Fe]]
The Mössbauer Effect is a process in which a nucleus emits or absorbs gamma rays without loss of energy to a nuclear recoil. It was discovered by the German physicist Rudolf L. Mössbauer in 1958 and has proved to be remarkably useful for basic research in physics and chemistry. It has been used, for instance, in precisely measuring small energy changes in nuclei, atoms, and crystals induced by electrical, magnetic, or gravitational fields. In a transition of a nucleus from a higher to a lower energy state with accompanying emission of gamma rays, the emission generally causes the nucleus to recoil, and this takes energy from the emitted gamma rays. Thus the gamma rays do not have sufficient energy to excite a target nucleus to be examined. However, Mössbauer discovered that it is possible to have transitions in which the recoil is absorbed by a whole crystal in which the emitting nucleus is bound. Under these circumstances, the energy that goes into the recoil is a negligible portion of the energy of the transition. Therefore, the emitted gamma rays carry virtually all of the energy liberated by the nuclear transition. The gamma rays thus are able to induce a reverse transition, under similar conditions of negligible recoil, in a target nucleus of the same material as the emitter but in a lower energy state. In general, gamma rays are produced by nuclear transitions from an unstable high-energy state to a stable low-energy state. The energy of the emitted gamma ray corresponds to the energy of the nuclear transition, minus an amount of energy that is lost as recoil to the emitting atom.  If the lost recoil energy is small compared with the energy [[linewidth]] of the nuclear transition, then the gamma ray energy still corresponds to the energy of the nuclear transition, and the gamma ray can be absorbed by a second atom of the same type as the first. This emission and subsequent absorption is called [[resonance|resonant]] [[fluorescence]].  Additional recoil energy is also lost during absorption, so in order for resonance to occur the recoil energy must actually be less than half the linewidth for the corresponding nuclear transition.

The amount of energy in the recoiling body ({{math|''E''&lt;small&gt;{{sub|R}}&lt;/small&gt;}}) can be found from momentum conservation:

:&lt;math&gt;|P_\mathrm{R}| = |P_\mathrm{\gamma}| \,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''P''&lt;small&gt;{{sub|R}}&lt;/small&gt;}} is the momentum of the recoiling matter, and {{math|''P''{{sub|γ}}}} the momentum of the gamma ray. Substituting energy into the equation gives:

:&lt;math&gt;E_\mathrm{R} = \frac{E_\mathrm{\gamma}^2}{2Mc^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''E''&lt;small&gt;{{sub|R}}&lt;/small&gt;}} ({{val|0.002|ul=eV}} for {{SimpleNuclide2|Fe|57}}) is the energy lost as recoil, {{math|''E''{{sub|γ}}}} is the energy of the gamma ray ({{val|14.4|ul=keV}} for {{SimpleNuclide2|Fe|57}}), {{math|''M''}} ({{val|56.9354|ul=u}} for {{SimpleNuclide2|Fe|57}}) is the mass of the emitting or absorbing body, and ''c'' is the [[speed of light]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the case of a gas the emitting and absorbing bodies are atoms, so the mass is relatively small, resulting in a large recoil energy, which prevents resonance.  (Note that the same equation applies for recoil energy losses in x-rays, but the photon energy is much less, resulting in a lower energy loss, which is why gas-phase resonance could be observed with x-rays.)

In a solid, the nuclei are bound to the lattice and do not recoil in the same way as in a gas.  The lattice as a whole recoils but the recoil energy is negligible because the {{math|''M''}} in the above equation is the mass of the whole lattice.  However, the energy in a decay can be taken up or supplied by lattice vibrations.  The energy of these vibrations is quantised in units known as ''phonons''.  The Mössbauer effect occurs because there is a finite probability of a decay occurring involving no phonons.  Thus in a fraction of the nuclear events (the '''recoil-free fraction''', given by the [[Lamb–Mössbauer factor]]), the entire crystal acts as the recoiling body, and these events are essentially recoil-free.  In these cases, since the recoil energy is negligible, the emitted gamma rays have the appropriate energy and resonance can occur.

In general (depending on the half-life of the decay), gamma rays have very narrow linewidths.  This means they are very sensitive to small changes in the energies of nuclear transitions.  In fact, gamma rays can be used as a probe to observe the effects of interactions between a nucleus and its electrons and those of its neighbors.  This is the basis for Mössbauer spectroscopy, which combines the Mössbauer effect with the [[Doppler effect]] to monitor such interactions.

[[Zero-phonon line and phonon sideband|Zero-phonon optical transitions]], a process closely analogous to the Mössbauer effect, can be observed in lattice-bound [[chromophore]]s at low temperatures.

The '''Olduvai Gorge Museum''' is located in the [[Ngorongoro Conservation Area]] in Northern [[Tanzania]] on the edge of the [[Olduvai Gorge]]. The museum was founded by [[Mary Leakey]] and is now under the jurisdiction of the Tanzanian government's Department of Cultural [[Antiquities]]. It is a [[museum]] dedicated to the appreciation and understanding of the Olduvai Gorge and [[Laetoli]] fossil sites. 

==History==
The [[Olduvai Gorge]] Museum was founded by [[Mary Leakey]] in the late 1970s. The museum was originally designed to house paleoanthropological [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] from the surrounding area. The [[Olduvai Gorge]] Museum was later after her death put under control of the Tanzanian government's Department of Cultural Antiquities. During the mid-1990s, the [[J. Paul Getty Museum]]'s Department of Conservation renovated and added to the museum. This included a new wing with exhibitions that were designed by the Getty Museum.

==Location==
The Olduvai Gorge Museum is located in the [[Ngorongoro Conservation Area]] in Northern [[Tanzania]] on the edge of the [[Olduvai Gorge]]; directly where the Gorge split into two. It is approximately 5 km from the main road to the [[Serengeti]] plains north west of the Ngorongoro Conservation Area.

==Exhibits==
The exhibits at the Olduvai Gorge Museum are centered around the paleoanthropological research and [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] that have come from the surrounding area. There is one hall dedicated to the Leakey family and their pursuit of working at Olduvai Gorge. This hall has historical artifacts from the Olduvai Gorge area as well as charts and maps explaining the process of [[fossil]] excavation.  Many of the artifacts are original but some are casts (specifically the [[Hominidae|hominid]] skulls). The adjacent hall is dedicated solely to the [[Laetoli]] fossilized footprints. A cast that was made of part of the footprint trail in 1996 by the J. Paul Getty Museum is on display. Accompanying this are several charts and photographs describing and illustrating the process of the Laetoli Footprints creation. There is also a large illustration depicting three ''[[Australopithecus afarensis]]'' walking through the area 3.6 million years ago. In addition to these indoor museum exhibits there are also two outdoor lecture areas. These are utilized for orientation presentations given by museum staff.

==Staff==
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Museum Staff.jpg|thumb|Olduvai Gorge Museum Staff, February 2006]] --&gt;
The Olduvai Gorge Museum staff consists of roughly 120 people. The museum has two curators [[Godfrey Olle Moita Maasai]] (on site) and [[Donatius Kamamba]] (off site Tanzanian Department of Cultural Antiquities). The staff mainly consists of people from the local [[Maasai people|Maasai]] tribe. The staff is housed in what was once the Leakey's camp. Some members of the staff have been there since the museum opened and plan to continue working at the museum for as long as possible. They consider themselves the caretakers of Olduvai Gorge.

==Visitors==
There are roughly 150 visitors a day during the peak season in the [[Ngorongoro Conservation Area]]. During the rainy season (March-August) the attendance can fall to 0 visitors a day. Visitors typically come from the closest city ([[Arusha]]) by [[safari]] vehicle. They commonly come for lunch and then depart to continue their [[safari]] in the [[Ngorongoro Conservation Area]]. According to the staff at the museum, visitors have come from all [[continents]] and represent most countries.

'''Planetary boundaries''' is a concept involving Earth system processes which contain environmental boundaries, proposed in 2009 by a group of [[Earth system science|Earth system]] and [[environmental science|environmental scientists]] led by [[Johan Rockström]] from the [[Stockholm Resilience Centre]] and [[Will Steffen]] from the [[Australian National University]]. The group wanted to define a "safe operating space for humanity" for the international community, including governments at all levels, international organizations, civil society, the scientific community and the [[private sector]], as a precondition for [[sustainable development]]. The framework is based on scientific evidence that human actions since the [[Industrial Revolution]] have become the main driver of global environmental change. 

According to the paradigm, "transgressing one or more planetary boundaries may be deleterious or even catastrophic due to the risk of crossing thresholds that will trigger non-linear, abrupt environmental change within continental-to planetary-scale systems."&lt;ref name="Rockstrom09"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1063&amp;context=iss_pub|title=Planetary Boundaries: Exploring the Safe Operating Space for Humanity|year=2009|authors=Rockström et al.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Earth system process boundaries mark the safe zone for the planet to the extent that they are not crossed. As of 2009, two boundaries have already been crossed, while others are in imminent danger of being crossed.&lt;ref&gt;Editorial, {{Harvnb|Nature|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rockstrom09"/&gt;

==History of framework==
[[File:Planetary Boundaries.png|thumb|Planetary boundaries diagram of 2009.]]

In 2009, a group of [[Earth system science|Earth system]] and [[environmental science|environmental scientists]] led by [[Johan Rockström]] from the [[Stockholm Resilience Centre]] and [[Will Steffen]] from the [[Australian National University]] collaborated with 26 leading academics, including [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|Nobel]] laureate [[Paul Crutzen]], [[Goddard Institute for Space Studies]] climate scientist [[James Hansen]] and the [[German Chancellor]]'s chief climate adviser [[Hans Joachim Schellnhuber]] and identified nine "planetary life support systems" essential for human survival, attempting to quantify how far seven of these systems had been pushed already.  They estimated how much further humans can go before [[planetary habitability]] is threatened.&lt;ref name="Rockström 2009"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rockström|Steffen|26 others|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Estimates indicated that three of these boundaries—[[climate change]], [[biodiversity]] loss, and the biogeochemical flow boundary—appear to have been crossed.

[http://nceas.ucsb.edu/files/news/comment.pdf  Planetary boundaries]: A series of commentaries in ''Nature reports climate change'' on the planetary boundaries concept set out in the original paper.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, a second paper was published in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' to update the Planetary Boundaries concept&lt;ref name="SteffenEtAl2015" /&gt; and findings were presented at the [[World Economic Forum]] in Davos, January 2015.

A 2018 study, co-authored by Rockström, calls into question the international agreement to limit warming to 2 degrees above pre-industrial temperatures set forth in the [[Paris Agreement]].  The scientists raise the possibility that even if [[greenhouse gas]] emissions are [[Climate change mitigation|substantially reduced]] to limit warming to 2 degrees, that might be the  "threshold" at which self-reinforcing [[climate feedbacks]] add additional warming until the [[Climate|climate system]] stabilizes in a [[Climate state#Hothouse|hothouse climate state]]. This would make parts of the world uninhabitable, raise sea levels by up to {{convert|60|m|ft}}, and raise temperatures by {{convert|4-5|C-change}} to levels that are higher than any [[interglacial]] period in the past 1.2 million years. Rockström notes that whether this would occur "is one of the most existential questions in science." Study author Katherine Richardson stresses, "We note that the Earth has never in its history had a quasi-stable state that is around 2 °C warmer than the preindustrial and suggest that there is substantial risk that the system, itself, will ‘want’ to continue warming because of all of these other processes – even if we stop emissions. This implies not only reducing emissions but much more.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/07/31/1810141115|doi=10.1073/pnas.1810141115|journal=PNAS|title=Trajectories of the Earth System in the Anthropocene|authors=Steffen et al.|year=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/aug/06/domino-effect-of-climate-events-could-push-earth-into-a-hothouse-state|work=The Guardian|title=Domino-effect of climate events could push Earth into a ‘hothouse’ state|last=Watts|first=Jonathan|date=2018-08-07|accessdate=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Terra.png|thumb|The planet [[Earth]] is a finite system, which means it has limits.]]

===The idea===
The idea that our planet has limits, including the burden placed upon it by human activities, has been around for some time. In 1972, ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' was published. It presented a model in which five variables: [[world population]], industrialization, pollution, food production, and [[resources depletion]], are examined, and considered to grow [[exponential growth|exponentially]], whereas the ability of technology to increase resources availability is only [[linear function|linear]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Meadows|others|1972}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the report was widely dismissed, particularly by economists and businessmen,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Meyer|Nørgård|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and it has often been claimed that history has proved the projections to be incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|van Vuuren|Faber|2009}}, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008, Graham Turner from the [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] (CSIRO) published "A comparison of ''The Limits to Growth'' with thirty years of reality".&lt;ref name="Turner 2008"&gt;{{Harvnb|Turner|2008}}, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Turner found that the observed historical data from 1970 to 2000 closely matches the simulated results of the "standard run" limits of growth model for almost all the outputs reported. "The comparison is well within uncertainty bounds of nearly all the data in terms of both magnitude and the trends over time."&lt;ref name="Turner 2008"/&gt; Turner also examined a number of reports, particularly by economists, which over the years have purported to discredit the limits-to-growth model. Turner says these reports are flawed, and reflect misunderstandings about the model.&lt;ref name="Turner 2008"/&gt; In 2010, Nørgård, Peet and Ragnarsdóttir called the book a "pioneering report", and said that it "has withstood the test of time and, indeed, has only become more relevant."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nørgård|Peet|Ragnarsdóttir|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote box
| quote = With few exceptions, economics as a discipline has been dominated by a perception of living in an unlimited world, where resource and pollution problems in one area were solved by moving resources or people to other parts. The very hint of any global limitation as suggested in the report ''The Limits to Growth'' was met with disbelief and rejection by businesses and most economists. However, this conclusion was mostly based on false premises.

''[[Our Common Future]]''&lt;ref&gt;Also known as the {{Harvnb|Brundtland Report|1987}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 1987 by United Nations' [[Brundtland Commission|World Commission on Environment and Development]]. It tried to recapture the spirit of the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment|Stockholm Conference]]. Its aim was to interlock the concepts of development and environment for future political discussions. It introduced the famous definition for [[sustainable development]]:

{{quote|"Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs."|''{{Harvnb|Brundtland Report|1987}}''}}

Of a different kind is the approach made by [[James Lovelock]]. In the 1970s he and [[microbiologist]] [[Lynn Margulis]] presented the [[Gaia hypothesis|Gaia theory or hypothesis]], that states that all [[organisms]] and their [[inorganic]] surroundings on Earth are integrated into a single self-regulating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lovelock|1972}}; {{Harvnb|Lovelock|Margulis|1974}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The system has the ability to react to perturbations or deviations, much like a living organism adjusts its regulation mechanisms to accommodate environmental changes such as temperature ([[homeostasis]]). Nevertheless, this capacity has limits. For instance, when a living organism is subjected to a temperature that is lower or higher than its living range, it can perish because its regulating mechanism cannot make the necessary adjustments. Similarly the Earth may not be able to react to large deviations in critical parameters. In his book ''[[The Revenge of Gaia]]'', he affirms that the destruction of rainforests and biodiversity, compounded with the increase of [[greenhouse gas]]es made by humans, is producing [[global warming]].

===From Holocene to Anthropocene===
{{Main|Anthropocene}}

{{quote box
| quote = Our planet’s ability to provide an accommodating environment for humanity is being challenged by our own activities. The environment—our life-support system—is changing rapidly from the stable Holocene state of the last 12,000 years, during which we developed agriculture, villages, cities, and contemporary civilizations, to an unknown future state of significantly different conditions.

The [[Holocene]] began about 10,000 years ago. It is the current [[interglacial]] period, and it has proven to be a relatively stable environment of the Earth. There have been natural environmental fluctuations during the Holocene, but the key atmospheric and biogeochemical parameters have been relatively stable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dansgaard|others1993}}; {{Harvnb|Petit|others|1999}}; {{Harvnb|Rioual|others|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This stability and [[Resilience (ecology)|resilience]] has allowed agriculture to develop and complex societies to thrive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|van der Leeuw|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rockström ''et al.'', we "have now become so dependent on those investments for our way of life, and how we have organized society, technologies, and economies around them, that we must take the range within which Earth System processes varied in the Holocene as a scientific reference point for a desirable planetary state."&lt;ref name="Rockström 2009"/&gt;

Since the [[industrial revolution]], according to [[Paul J. Crutzen|Paul Crutzen]], Will Steffen and others, the planet has entered a new epoch, the [[Anthropocene]]. In the Anthropocene, humans have become the main agents of change to the Earth system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crutzen|2002}}; {{Harvnb|Steffen|Crutzen|McNeill|2007}}; {{Harvnb|Zalasiewicz|others|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There have been well publicized scientific warnings about risks in the areas of climate change and stratospheric ozone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG2|2007}}{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}; {{Harvnb|WMO|2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, other [[biophysical]] processes are also important.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mace|Masundire|Baillie|2005}}; {{Harvnb|Folke|others|2004}}; {{Harvnb|Gordon|Peterson|Bennett|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, since the advent of the Anthropocene, the rate at which species are being extinguished has increased over 100 times,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mace|Masundire|Baillie|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and humans are now the driving force altering global river flows&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shiklomanov|Rodda|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as water vapor flows from the land surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gordon|Peterson|Bennett|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Continuing pressure on the Earth's biophysical systems from human activities raises concerns that further pressure could be destabilizing, and precipitate sudden or irreversible changes to the environment.

==Nine boundaries==
'''Thresholds and  boundaries'''

The ''threshold'', or climatological [[Tipping point (climatology)|tipping point]], is the value at which a very small increment for the control variable (like CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) produces a large, possibly catastrophic, change in the response variable (global warming).

The threshold points are difficult to locate, because the Earth System is very complex. Instead of defining the threshold value, the study establishes a range, and the threshold is supposed to lie inside it. The lower end of that range is defined as the ''boundary''. Therefore, it defines a safe space, in the sense that as long as we are below the boundary, we are below the threshold value. If the boundary is crossed, we enter into a danger zone.&lt;ref name="Rockström 2009"/&gt;

The proposed framework lays the groundwork for shifting approach to governance and management, away from the essentially sectoral analyses of limits to growth aimed at minimizing negative [[Externality|externaliti]]es, toward the estimation of the safe space for human development. Planetary boundaries define, as it were, the boundaries of the "planetary playing field" for humanity if major [[Human impact on the environment|human-induced environmental change]] on a global scale is to be avoided

Transgressing one or more planetary boundaries may be highly damaging or even catastrophic, due to the risk of crossing thresholds that trigger non-linear, abrupt [[environmental change]] within [[continent]]al- to planetary-scale systems. The 2009 study identified nine planetary boundaries and, drawing on current scientific understanding, the researchers proposed quantifications for seven of them. These seven are climate change ([[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] concentration in the atmosphere &lt; 350 ppm and/or a maximum change of +1 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in [[radiative forcing]]); [[ocean acidification]] (mean surface seawater saturation state with respect to aragonite ≥ 80% of pre-[[Industrial Revolution|industrial]] levels); [[stratosphere|stratospheric]] ozone (less than 5% reduction in total atmospheric [[Ozone|O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] from a pre-industrial level of 290 [[Dobson Unit]]s); [[Biogeochemical cycle|biogeochemical]] [[Nitrogen cycle|nitrogen (N) cycle]] (limit industrial and agricultural fixation of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to 35 Tg N/yr) and [[Phosphorus cycle|phosphorus (P) cycle]] (annual P inflow to oceans not to exceed 10 times the natural background [[weathering]] of P); global freshwater use (&lt; 4000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/yr of consumptive use of runoff resources); land system change (&lt; 15% of the ice-free land surface under cropland); and the rate at which biological diversity is lost (annual rate of &lt; 10 extinctions per million species). The two additional planetary boundaries for which the group had not yet been able to determine a boundary level are [[Air pollution|chemical pollution and atmospheric aerosol loading]].

==Debate==
===On the framework===
{{quote box
| quote = &lt;center&gt;'''From the  [[Stockholm Memorandum]]'''&lt;/center&gt; Science indicates that we are transgressing planetary boundaries that have kept civilization safe for the past 10,000 years. Evidence is growing that human pressures are starting to overwhelm the Earth’s buffering capacity. Humans are now the most significant driver of [[global change]], propelling the planet into a new geological epoch, the [[Anthropocene]]. We can no longer exclude the possibility that our collective actions will trigger tipping points, risking abrupt and irreversible consequences for human communities and ecological systems.

[[Christopher Field]], director of the [[Carnegie Institution|Carnegie Institution's Department of Global Ecology]], is impressed: "This kind of work is critically important. Overall, this is an impressive attempt to define a safety zone."&lt;ref name="Zimmer 2009"&gt;{{Harvnb|Zimmer|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; But the conservation biologist [[Stuart Pimm]] is not impressed: "I don’t think this is in any way a useful way of thinking about things... The notion of a single boundary is just devoid of serious content. In what way is an extinction rate 10 times the background rate acceptable?"&lt;ref name="Zimmer 2009"/&gt; and the environmental policy analyst [[William C. Clark|Bill Clark]] thinks: "Tipping points in the earth system are dense, unpredictable... and unlikely to be avoidable through early warning indicators. It follows that... 'safe operating spaces' and 'planetary boundaries' are thus highly suspect and potentially the new 'opiates'."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clark|2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The biogeochemist [[William H. Schlesinger|William Schlesinger]] queries whether thresholds are a good idea for pollutions at all. He thinks waiting until we near some suggested limit will just permit us to continue to a point where it is too late. "Management based on thresholds, although attractive in its simplicity, allows pernicious, slow and diffuse degradation to persist nearly indefinitely."&lt;ref name="Schlesinger 2009"&gt;{{Harvnb|Schlesinger|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hydrologist David Molden thinks planetary boundaries are a welcome new approach in the 'limits to growth' debate. "As a scientific organizing principle, the concept has many strengths ... the numbers are important because they provide targets for policymakers, giving a clear indication of the magnitude and direction of change. They also provide benchmarks and direction for science. As we improve our understanding of Earth processes and complex inter-relationships, these benchmarks can and will be updated ... we now have a tool we can use to help us think more deeply—and urgently—about planetary limits and the critical actions we have to take."&lt;ref name="Molden 2009"&gt;{{Harvnb|Molden|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ocean chemist]] Peter Brewer queries whether it is "truly useful to create a list of environmental limits without serious plans for how they may be achieved ... they may become just another stick to beat citizens with. Disruption of the global nitrogen cycle is one clear example: it is likely that a large fraction of people on Earth would not be alive today without the artificial production of fertilizer. How can such ethical and economic issues be matched with a simple call to set limits? ... food is not optional."&lt;ref name="Brewer 2009"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brewer|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The environment advisor Steve Bass says the "description of planetary boundaries is a sound idea. We need to know how to live within the unusually stable conditions of our present Holocene period and not do anything that causes irreversible environmental change ... Their paper has profound implications for future governance systems, offering some of the 'wiring' needed to link governance of national and global economies with governance of the environment and natural resources. The planetary boundaries concept should enable policymakers to understand more clearly that, like human rights and representative government, environmental change knows no borders."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bass|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The climate change policy advisor [[Adele Morris]] thinks that price-based policies are also needed to avoid political and economic thresholds. "Staying within a 'safe operating space' will require staying within all the relevant boundaries, including the electorate’s willingness to pay."&lt;ref name="Morris 2010"&gt;{{Harvnb|Morris|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

| quote = In summary, the planetary boundary concept is a very important one, and its proposal should now be followed by discussions of the connections between the various boundaries and of their association with other concepts such as the '[[limits to growth]]'. Importantly, this novel concept highlights the risk of reaching thresholds or tipping points for non-linear or abrupt changes in Earth-system processes. As such, it can help society to reach the agreements required for dealing effectively with existing global environmental threats, such as climate change.

In their report (2012) entitled "Resilient People, Resilient Planet: A future worth choosing", The High-level Panel on Global Sustainability called for bold global efforts, "including launching a major global scientific initiative, to strengthen the interface between science and policy. We must define, through science, what scientists refer to as "planetary boundaries", "environmental thresholds" and "tipping points"."&lt;ref&gt;

In 2011, at their second meeting, the High-level Panel on Global Sustainability&lt;ref&gt;United Nations [https://www.un.org/wcm/content/site/climatechange/pages/gsp High-level Panel on Global Sustainability]&lt;/ref&gt; of the United Nations had incorporated the concept of  planetary boundaries into their framework, stating that their goal was: "To eradicate poverty and reduce inequality, make growth inclusive, and production and consumption more sustainable while combating climate change and respecting the range of other planetary boundaries."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|UN GSP 2 meeting|2011}}, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Elsewhere in their proceedings, panel members have expressed reservations about the political effectiveness of using the concept of "planetary boundaries": "Planetary boundaries are still an evolving concept that should be used with caution [...] The planetary boundaries question can be divisive as it can be perceived as a tool of the "North" to tell the "South" not to follow the resource intensive and environmentally destructive development pathway that rich countries took themselves... This language is unacceptable to most of the developing countries as they fear that an emphasis on boundaries would place unacceptable brakes on poor countries."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|UN Sherpa 3 meeting|2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the concept is routinely used in the proceedings of the United Nations,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|UN Agenda 21}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the ''UN Daily News''. For example, the [[UNEP]] Executive Director [[Achim Steiner]] states that the challenge of agriculture is to "feed a growing global population without pushing humanity's [[Ecological footprint|footprint]] beyond planetary boundaries."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/news/dh/pdf/english/2011/01062011.pdf Sustainable agriculture key to green growth, poverty reduction] ''UN Daily News'', 1 June 2011, page 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) Yearbook 2010 also repeated Rockström's message, conceptually linking it with [[ecosystem management]] and [[Sustainable Governance Indicators|environmental governance indicators]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|UNEP|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The planetary boundaries concept is also used in proceedings by the [[European Commission]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|The Budapest Declaration}}; {{Harvnb|Greenfield|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and was referred to in the [[European Environment Agency]] synthesis report ''The European environment – state and outlook 2010''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Martin|Henrichs|others|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Climate change====
[[File:Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and global annual average temperatures over the years 1880 to 2009.png|thumb|300px|right|The black line shows the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration for the period 1880–2008. Red bars show temperatures above and blue bars show temperatures below the average temperature. Year-to-year temperature fluctuations are due to natural processes, such as the effects of [[El Niño]], [[La Niña]], and the eruption of large volcanoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|USGCRP|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Radiative forcing]] is a measure of the difference between the incoming [[Irradiance|radiation energy]] and the outgoing radiation energy acting across the boundary of the earth. Positive radiative forcing results in warming. From the start of the industrial revolution in 1750 to 2005, the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide has led to a positive radiative forcing, averaging about 1.66&amp;nbsp;W/m².&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG1|2007}}, "[http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/spmsspm-human-and.html Human and Natural Drivers of Climate Change]". &lt;!-- Same link, formerly titled "Figure SPM.2". --&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

The climate scientist [[Myles Allen]] thinks setting "a limit on long-term atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations merely distracts from the much more immediate challenge of limiting warming to 2 °C." He says the concentration of carbon dioxide is not a control variable we can "meaningfully claim to control", and he questions whether keeping carbon dioxide levels below 350 ppm will avoid more than 2&amp;nbsp;°C of warming.&lt;ref name="Allen 2009"/&gt;

Adele Morris, policy director, Climate and Energy Economics Project, [[Brookings Institution]], makes a criticism from the economical-political point of view. She puts emphasis in choosing policies that minimize costs and preserve consensus.  She favors a system of [[carbon tax|green-house gas emissions tax]], and [[emissions trading]], as ways to prevent global warming. She thinks that too-ambitious objectives, like the boundary limit on CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, may discourage such actions.&lt;ref name="Morris 2010"/&gt;

====Biodiversity loss====
According to the biologist [[Cristián Samper]], a " boundary that expresses the probability of families of species disappearing over time would better reflect our potential impacts on the future of life on Earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Samper|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The conservation ecologist Gretchen Daily claims that "it is time to confront the hard truth that traditional approaches to conservation, taken alone, are doomed to fail. Nature reserves are too small, too few, too isolated and too subject to change to support more than a tiny fraction of Earth’s biodiversity. The challenge is to make conservation attractive—from economic and cultural perspectives. We cannot go on treating nature like an all-you-can-eat buffet. We depend on nature for food security, clean water, climate stability, seafood, timber, and other biological and physical services. To maintain these benefits, we need not just remote reserves but places everywhere—more like 'ecosystem service stations.' A few pioneers are integrating conservation and human development. The Costa Rican government is paying landowners for [[ecosystem services]] from tropical forests, including carbon offsets, hydropower production, biodiversity conservation and scenic beauty. [[China]] is investing $100 billion in "ecocompensation," including innovative policy and finance mechanisms that reward conservation and restoration. The country is also creating "ecosystem function conservation areas" that make up 18 percent of its land area.  Colombia and South Africa have made dramatic policy changes, too. Three advances would help the rest of the world scale such models of success. One: new science and tools to value and account for [[natural capital]], in biophysical, economic and other terms [...] Two: compelling demonstrations of such tools in resource policy. Three: cooperation among governments, development organizations, corporations and communities to help nations build more durable economies while also maintaining critical ecosystem services."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Daily|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nitrogen Cycle.svg|thumb|380px|right|[[Nitrogen cycle]]]]

==== Nitrogen cycle ====
Since the industrial revolution, the Earth's [[nitrogen cycle]] has been disturbed even more than the carbon cycle. "Human activities now convert more nitrogen from the atmosphere into reactive forms than all of the Earth´s terrestrial processes combined. Much of this new reactive nitrogen pollutes waterways and coastal zones, is emitted back to the atmosphere in changed forms, or accumulates in the terrestrial biosphere."&lt;ref name="Stockholm Resilience Centre 2009"&gt;{{Harvnb|Stockholm Resilience Centre|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Only a small part of the fertilizers applied in agriculture is used by plants. Most of the nitrogen and phosphorus ends up in rivers, lakes and the sea, where excess amounts stress aquatic ecosystems. For example, fertilizer which discharges from rivers into the Gulf of Mexico has damaged [[Shrimp fishery|shrimp fisheries]] because of [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxia]].&lt;ref name="Stockholm Resilience Centre 2009"/&gt;

The biogeochemist [[William H. Schlesinger|William Schlesinger]]  thinks waiting until we near some suggested limit for nitrogen deposition and other pollutions will just permit us to continue to a point where it is too late. He says the boundary suggested for phosphorus is not sustainable, and would exhaust the known phosphorus reserves in less than 200 years.&lt;ref name="Schlesinger 2009"/&gt;

With regard to nitrogen, the biogeochemist and ecosystem scientist Robert Howarth says: "Human activity has greatly altered the flow of nitrogen across the globe. The single largest contributor is fertilizer use. But the burning of fossil fuels actually dominates the problem in some regions, such as the northeastern U.S. The solution in that case is to conserve energy and use it more efficiently. Hybrid vehicles are another excellent fix; their nitrogen emissions are significantly less than traditional vehicles because their engines turn off while the vehicle is stopped. (Emissions from conventional vehicles actually rise when the engine is idling.) Nitrogen emissions from U.S. power plants could be greatly reduced, too, if plants that predate the Clean Air Act and its amendments were required to comply; these plants pollute far out of proportion to the amount of electricity they produce.

In agriculture, many farmers could use less fertilizer, and the reductions in crop yields would be small or nonexistent. Runoff from corn fields is particularly avoidable because corn’s roots penetrate only the top few inches of soil and assimilate nutrients for only two months of the year. In addition, nitrogen losses can be reduced by 30 percent or more if farmers plant winter cover crops, such as rye or wheat, which can help the soil hold nitrogen. These crops also increase carbon sequestration in soils, mitigating climate change. Better yet is to grow perennial plants such as grasses rather than corn; nitrogen losses are many times lower. Nitrogen pollution from [[Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations|concentrated animal feeding operations]] (CAFOs) is a huge problem.

As recently as the 1970s, most animals were fed local crops, and the animals’ wastes were returned to the fields as fertilizer. Today most U.S. animals are fed crops grown hundreds of miles away, making it “uneconomical” to return the manure. The solution? Require CAFO owners to treat their wastes, just as municipalities must do with human wastes. Further, if we ate less meat, less waste would be generated and less synthetic fertilizer would be needed to grow animal feed. Eating meat from animals that are range-fed on perennial grasses would be ideal. The explosive growth in the production of ethanol as a biofuel is greatly aggravating nitrogen pollution. Several studies have suggested that if mandated U.S. ethanol targets are met, the amount of nitrogen flowing down the [[Mississippi River]] and fueling the Gulf of Mexico dead zone may increase by 30 to 40 percent. The best alternative would be to forgo the production of ethanol from corn. If the country wants to rely on biofuels, it should instead grow grasses and trees and burn these to co-generate heat and electricity; nitrogen pollution and greenhouse gas emissions would be much lower."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Howarth|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Phosphorus ====
{{Further|Peak phosphorus}}
With regard to phosphorus, the ocean engineer David Vaccari says that the most sustainable environmental [[phosphorus cycle|flow of phosphorus]] "would be the natural flux: seven million metric tons per year (Mt/yr). To hit that mark yet satisfy our usage of 22 Mt/yr, we would have to recycle or reuse 72 percent of our phosphorus [...] The flow could be reduced with existing technologies... [lowering] the loss to waterways from 22 to 8.25 Mt/yr, not very much above the natural flux."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Vaccari|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Peak phosphorus is a concept to describe the point in time at which the maximum global [[phosphorus]] production rate is reached. Phosphorus is a scarce finite resource on earth and means of production other than mining are unavailable because of its non-gaseous environmental cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Neset|Cordell|2011|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some researchers, Earth's phosphorus reserves are expected to be completely depleted in 50–100 years and peak phosphorus to be reached in approximately 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cordell|Drangert|White|2009|p=292}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|2008|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

]]

====Ocean acidification====
[[Ocean acidification|Surface ocean acidity]] has increased thirty percent since the industrial revolution. About one quarter of the additional carbon dioxide generated by humans is dissolved in the oceans, where it forms [[carbonic acid]]. This acidity inhibits the ability of corals, shellfish and plankton to build shells and skeletons. [[Cascade effect (ecology)|Knock-on effects]] could have serious consequences for [[fish stock]]s. This boundary is clearly interconnected with the climate change boundaries, since the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is also the underlying control variable for the ocean acidification boundary.&lt;ref name="Stockholm Resilience Centre 2009"/&gt;

The ocean chemist Peter Brewer thinks "ocean acidification has impacts other than simple changes in pH, and these may need boundaries too."&lt;ref name="Brewer 2009"/&gt;

The marine chemist Scott Doney thinks "the main tactics are raising energy efficiency, switching to renewable and nuclear power, protecting forests and exploring carbon sequestration technologies. Regionally, nutrient runoff to coastal waters not only creates dead zones but also amplifies acidification. The excess nutrients cause more phytoplankton to grow, and as they die the added CO2 from their decay acidifies the water. We have to be smarter about how we fertilize fields and lawns and treat livestock manure and sewage ... Locally, acidic water could be buffered with limestone or chemical bases produced electrochemically from seawater and rocks. More practical may be protecting specific shellfish beds and aquaculture fisheries. Larval mollusks such as clams and oysters appear to be more susceptible to acidification than adults, and recycling old clamshells into the mud may help buffer pH and provide better substrate for larval attachment. The drop in ocean pH is expected to accelerate in coming decades, so marine ecosystems will have to adapt. We can enhance their chances for success by reducing other insults such as water pollution and overfishing, making them better able to withstand some acidification while we transition away from a fossil-fuel energy economy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Doney|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Land use====
[[File:Europe land use map.png|thumb|350px|right|Europe land use map. Human land uses include arable farmland (yellow) and pasture (light green)]]

Across the planet, forests, wetlands and other vegetation types are being converted to agricultural and other [[land use]]s, impacting freshwater, carbon and other cycles, and reducing biodiversity.&lt;ref name="Stockholm Resilience Centre 2009"/&gt;

The environment advisor Steve Bass says research tells us that "the sustainability of land use depends less on percentages and more on other factors. For example, the environmental impact of 15 per cent coverage by intensively farmed cropland in large blocks will be significantly different from that of 15 per cent of land farmed in more sustainable ways, integrated into the landscape. The boundary of 15 per cent land-use change is, in practice, a premature policy guideline that dilutes the authors' overall scientific proposition. Instead, the authors might want to consider a limit on soil degradation or soil loss. This would be a more valid and useful indicator of the state of terrestrial health."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bass|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Earth systems scientist Eric Lambin thinks that "intensive agriculture should be concentrated on land that has the best potential for high-yield crops ... We can avoid losing the best agricultural land by controlling land degradation, freshwater depletion and urban sprawl. This step will require zoning and the adoption of more efficient agricultural practices, especially in developing countries. The need for farmland can be lessened, too, by decreasing waste along the food distribution chain, encouraging slower population growth, ensuring more equitable food distribution worldwide and significantly reducing meat consumption in rich countries."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lambin|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Freshwater====
[[File:PeakWaterAquifer.PNG|thumb|300px|left|Overexploitation of [[groundwater]] from an [[aquifer]] can result in a [[peak water]] curve.&lt;ref name="Palaniappan 2008"&gt;{{Harvnb|Palaniappan|Gleick|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Human pressures on global [[freshwater]] systems are having [[Water crisis|dramatic effects]]. The [[Water cycle|freshwater cycle]] is another boundary significantly affected by climate change.&lt;ref name="Stockholm Resilience Centre 2009"/&gt; Freshwater resources, such as lakes and [[aquifer]]s, are usually renewable resources which naturally recharge (the term [[fossil water]] is sometimes used to describe aquifers which don't recharge). [[Overexploitation]] occurs if a water resource is mined or extracted at a rate that exceeds the recharge rate. Recharge usually comes from area streams, rivers and lakes. Forests enhance the recharge of aquifers in some locales, although generally forests are a major source of aquifer [[Overdrafting|depletion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wrm.org.uy/deforestation/UNreport.html "Underlying Causes of Deforestation"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010411092448/http://wrm.org.uy/deforestation/UNreport.html |date=11 April 2001 }} UN Report.{{who|date=December 2011}}  &lt;!--  **This is a _web page_ that purports to be a UN report, but lacking any information as to where the original may be found.  This is NOT a relible source, and should be removed.** --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Depleted aquifers can become polluted with contaminants such as [[nitrate]]s, or permanently damaged through subsidence or through saline intrusion from the ocean. This turns much of the world's underground water and lakes into finite resources with peak usage debates similar to [[peak oil|oil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Larsen|2005}}; {{Harvnb|Sandford|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Hubbert's original analysis did not apply to renewable resources, their overexploitation can result in a [[Hubbert peak|Hubbert-like peak]]. A modified [[Hubbert curve]] applies to any resource that can be harvested faster than it can be replaced.&lt;ref name="Palaniappan 2008"/&gt;

The [[hydrologist]] [[Peter Gleick]] comments: "Few rational observers deny the need for boundaries to freshwater use. More controversial is defining where those limits are or what steps to take to constrain ourselves within them. Another way to describe these boundaries is the concept of [[peak water]]. Three different ideas are useful. 'Peak renewable' water limits are the total renewable flows in a watershed. Many of the world's major rivers are already approaching this threshold—when evaporation and consumption surpass natural replenishment from precipitation and other sources. 'Peak nonrenewable' limits apply where human use of water far exceeds natural recharge rates, such as in fossil groundwater basins of the Great Plains, Libya, India, northern China and parts of California's Central Valley. 'Peak ecological' water is the idea that for any hydrological system, increasing withdrawals eventually reach the point where any additional economic benefit of taking the water is outweighed by the additional ecological destruction that causes. Although it is difficult to quantify this point accurately, we have clearly passed the point of peak ecological water in many basins around the world where huge damage has occurred ... The good news is that the potential for savings, without hurting human health or economic productivity, is vast. Improvements in water-use efficiency are possible in every sector. More food can be grown with less water (and less water contamination) by shifting from conventional flood irrigation to drip and precision sprinklers, along with more accurately monitoring and managing soil moisture. Conventional power plants can change from water cooling to dry cooling, and more energy can be generated by sources that use extremely little water, such as photovoltaics and wind."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gleick|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hydrologist David Molden says "a global limit on water consumption is necessary, but the suggested planetary boundary of 4,000 cubic kilometres per year is too generous."&lt;ref name="Molden 2009"/&gt;

====Ozone depletion====
{{Main|Ozone depletion}}
[[File:NASA and NOAA Announce Ozone Hole is a Double Record Breaker.png|thumb|right|During 21–30 September 2006 the average area of the Antarctic ozone hole was the largest ever observed]]

The stratospheric [[ozone layer]] protectively filters [[ultraviolet radiation]] (UV) from the [[Sun]], which would otherwise damage biological systems. The actions taken after the [[Montreal Protocol]] appeared to be keeping the planet within a safe boundary.&lt;ref name="Stockholm Resilience Centre 2009"/&gt; However, in 2011, according to a paper published in ''Nature'', the boundary was unexpectedly [[Ozone depletion#Arctic ozone hole|pushed in the Arctic]]; "... the fraction of the Arctic vortex in March with total ozone less than 275 Dobson units (DU) is typically near zero, but reached nearly 45%".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Manney|Santee|27 others|2011|p=473}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nobel laureate in chemistry, [[Mario J. Molina|Mario Molina]], says "five per cent is a reasonable limit for acceptable ozone depletion, but it doesn't represent a tipping point".&lt;ref name="Molina 2009"/&gt;

The physicist David Fahey says that as a result of the Montreal Protocol "stratospheric ozone depletion will largely reverse by 2100. The gain has relied, in part, on intermediate substitutes, notably hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), and the growing use of compounds that cause no depletion, such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). Ongoing success depends on several steps:
* "Continue observing the ozone layer to promptly reveal unexpected changes. Ensure that nations adhere to regulations; for example, the HCFC phaseout will not be complete until 2030.
* "Maintain the Scientific Assessment Panel under the protocol. It attributes causes of changes in the ozone layer and evaluates new chemicals for their potential to destroy ozone and contribute to climate change.
* "Maintain the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel. It provides information on technologies and substitute compounds that helps nations assess how the demand for applications such as refrigeration, air-conditioning and foam insulation can be met while protecting the ozone layer.
"The two panels will also have to evaluate climate change and ozone recovery together. Climate change affects ozone abundance by altering the chemical composition and dynamics of the stratosphere, and compounds such as HCFCs and HFCs are greenhouse gases. For example, the large projected demand for HFCs could significantly contribute to climate change."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fahey|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Atmospheric aerosols====
[[Aerosol]] particles in the atmosphere impact the health of humans and influence [[monsoon]] and global [[atmospheric circulation]] systems. Some aerosols produce clouds which cool the Earth by reflecting sunlight back to space, while others, like soot, produce thin clouds in the upper stratosphere which behave like a greenhouse, warming the Earth. On balance, anthropogenic aerosols probably produce a net negative [[radiative forcing]] (cooling influence).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG1|2007}}.{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}} &lt;!-- Needs author, chapter, and section, with links. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Worldwide each year, aerosol particles result in about 800,000 premature deaths. Aerosol loading is sufficiently important to be included among the planetary boundaries, but it is not yet clear whether an appropriate safe threshold measure can be identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stockholm Resilience Centre|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{clear}}

====Chemical pollution====
Some chemicals, such as [[persistent organic pollutants]], [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]]s and [[radionuclide]]s, have potentially irreversible [[Bioaccumulation|additive]] and synergic effects on biological organisms, reducing fertility and resulting in permanent [[genetic damage]].  Sublethal uptakes are drastically reducing marine bird and mammal populations. This boundary seems important, although it is hard to quantify.&lt;ref name="Stockholm Resilience Centre 2009"/&gt;

A Bayesian emulator for persistent organic pollutants has been developed which can potentially be used to quantify the boundaries for chemical pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Handoh|Kawai|2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; To date, critical exposure levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) above which mass mortality events of marine mammals are likely to occur, have been proposed as a chemical pollution planetary boundary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Handoh|Kawai|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interaction among boundaries==
A planetary boundary may interact in a manner that changes the safe operating level of other boundaries. Rockström ''et al.'' 2009 did not analyze such interactions, but they suggested that many of these interactions will reduce rather than expand the proposed boundary levels.

For example, the [[land use]] boundary could shift downward if the freshwater boundary is breached, causing lands to become arid and unavailable for agriculture. At a regional level, water resources may decline in Asia if [[deforestation]] continues in the [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazon]].  Such considerations suggest the need for "extreme caution in approaching or transgressing any individual planetary boundaries."&lt;ref name="Rockström 2009"/&gt;

Another example has to do with [[coral reef]]s and [[marine ecosystem]]s. In 2009, {{Harvtxt|De'Ath|Lough|Fabricius|2009}} showed that, since 1990, calcification in the reefs of the [[Great Barrier Reef|Great Barrier]] that they examined decreased at a rate unprecedented over the last 400 years (14% in less than 20 years). Their evidence suggests that the increasing temperature stress and the declining ocean saturation state of [[aragonite]] is making it difficult for reef corals to deposit calcium carbonate. {{Harvtxt|Bellwood|others|2004}} explored how multiple stressors, such as increased nutrient loads and [[fishing pressure]], move corals into less desirable ecosystem states. {{Harvtxt|Guinotte|Fabry|2008}} showed that ocean acidification will significantly change the distribution and abundance of a whole range of marine life, particularly species "that build skeletons, shells, and tests of biogenic calcium carbonate. "Increasing temperatures, surface [[UV radiation]] levels and ocean acidity all stress marine [[Biota (ecology)|biota]], and the combination of these stresses may well cause perturbations in the abundance and diversity of marine biological systems that go well beyond the effects of a single stressor acting alone."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rockström|Steffen|26 others|2009}}, [http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art32/appendix1.pdf Appendix 1. Supplementary Information].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent developments==
{{quote box
| quote = The concept of planetary boundaries challenges the belief that resources are either limitless or infinitely substitutable. It threatens the business-as-usual approach to economic growth. The fact that reference to planetary boundaries was excluded from the [ [[Rio+20]] ] conference statement is a counterintuitive sign that the concept is being taken very seriously and has indeed gained enough traction to be threatening to the status quo. Had planetary boundaries remained in the statement, the most credible interpretation is that they would join a growing list of nice-sounding goals that are included but never achieved in the end. Planetary boundaries will not go away. The intrinsic limits to the amount of resources and environmental services that humanity can extract safely from the Earth System cannot be eliminated by wishful thinking, denial, or omission from official sustainable development conference statements. It is simply the nature of the planet we inhabit.

In 2012, [[Steven Running]] suggested a tenth boundary, the annual net global [[primary production]] of all [[terrestrial plant]]s, as an easily determinable measure integrating many variables that will give "a clear signal about the health of ecosystems".&lt;ref&gt;

===Not yet endorsed by United Nations ===
The United Nations secretary general [[Ban Ki-moon]] endorsed the concept of planetary boundaries on 16 March 2012, when he presented the key points of the report of his High Level Panel on Global Sustainability to an informal [[Plenary session|plenary]] of the UN General Assembly.&lt;ref name=ITIN /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scidev.net/en/science-and-innovation-policy/science-at-rio-20/news/rio-20-zero-draft-accepts-planetary-boundaries-.html Rio+20 zero draft accepts 'planetary boundaries'] ''SciDev.Net'', 28 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Ban stated: "The Panel’s vision is to eradicate poverty and reduce inequality, to make growth inclusive and production and consumption more sustainable, while combating climate change and respecting a range of other planetary boundaries."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2012/sgsm14166.doc.htm Secretary-General Highlights Key Points...] ''United Nations News'', 16 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was incorporated into the so-called "zero draft" of the outcome of the [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development]] to be convened in Rio de Janeiro 20–22 June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uncsd2012.org/rio20/content/documents/370The%20Future%20We%20Want%2010Jan%20clean%20_no%20brackets.pdf Zero draft of the outcome document] RIO+20, United Nations Conference on Sustainability Development.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the use of the concept was subsequently withdrawn from the text of the conference, "partly due to concerns from some poorer countries that its adoption could lead to the sidelining of poverty reduction and economic development. It is also, say observers, because the idea is simply too new to be officially adopted, and needed to be challenged, weathered and chewed over to test its robustness before standing a chance of being internationally accepted at UN negotiations."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scidev.net/en/agriculture-and-environment/features/your-guide-to-science-and-technology-at-rio-20-1.html Your guide to science and technology at Rio+20] ''scidev.net'', 12 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; It was suggested that three of the boundaries (including climate change) might push the Earth system into a new state if crossed; these also strongly influence the remaining boundaries. In the paper, the framework is developed to make it more applicable at the regional scale.

===Agricultural and nutritional impacts===
[[File:Planetary boundaries of agriculture and nutrition.png|thumb|400px|Environmental impacts of agriculture and nutrition within the framework of planetary boundaries according to Meier (2017)&lt;ref name="Meier 2017"&gt;{{Harvnb|Meier|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Human activities related to agriculture and nutrition globally contribute to the transgression of four out of nine planetary boundaries. Surplus nutrient flows (N, P) into aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems are of highest importance, followed by excessive land-system change and biodiversity loss. Whereas in the case of biodiversity loss, P cycle and land-system change, the transgression is in the zone of uncertainty—indicating an increasing risk (yellow circle in the figure), the N boundary related to agriculture is more than 200% transgressed—indicating a high risk (red marked circle in the figure).&lt;ref name="Meier 2017"/&gt;

A magnetosphere is produced by the interaction of a stream of [[Charged particle|charged particles]], such as [[solar wind]], with a planet's (or similar body's) [[magnetic field]]. All planets with intrinsic magnetic fields, including Earth, are surrounded by a magnetosphere.&lt;ref name="OndohMarubashi2001"/&gt;

[[File:Ecuador Andes Cayambe 2012.jpg|thumb|250px|Incised stream in the [[Ecuador]]ian [[Andes]] in [[Cayambe Canton]].]]
'''River incision''' is the narrow [[erosion]] caused by a [[river]] or stream that is far from its [[base level]]. River incision is common after [[tectonic uplift]] of the landscape. Incision by multiple rivers result in a dissected landscape, for example a [[dissected plateau]]. River Incision is the natural process by which a river cuts downward into its bed, deepening the active channel. Though it is a natural process, it can be accelerated rapidly by human factors including land use changes such as timber harvest, mining, agriculture, and road and dam construction. The rate of incision is a function of basal shear-stress. Shear stress is increased by factors such as sediment in the water, which increase its density (Lague, et. al. 2005). Shear stress is defined as   , where t= Shear Stress (N/m2), g= Weight Density of Water (N/m3, lb/ft ), D = Average water depth (m, ft), and Sw = Water Surface slope (m/m, ft/ft). Increases in slope, depth, or density of water increase the water’s potential to cause erosion (Lague 2014).

==Causes==
Traditional logging in the West coast of the United States included many practices which increased river incision. Timber removal and the associated road construction facilitate runoff and thus increased erosion and sediment delivery to streams (Wakabayashi 2001). Increases in sediment increases the water’s stream power, increasing the stream’s ability to do geomorphic work on the bed and banks (Yang et. al.1974). This leads to scouring of the bed material, exposing the bedrock channel bed to erosion and thus faster rates of channel incision (Kondolf, et. al. 2002). The scoured bed material consists of finer sediments such as silts, sands, and gravels. The removal of these removes important aquatic habitats for salmonid species and other aquatic organisms (Kondolf 1997). In many agricultural areas, rivers have been straightened and dyked for flood control and to plant crops in the floodplain (Doyle, et al.). Normally, floods are allowed to spread out across the floodplain, allowing deposition of sediment and slowing water speeds, reducing the erosive potential of the water (Heiler, et. al. 1995). Channelization concentrates flood flows down the active channel, increasing erosion. River incision due to agriculture is well-documented throughout the agricultural regions of the world, such as the Central Valley of California (Florsheim, et. al. 2011).

In-stream gravel mining is also well documented as a cause of river incision. Stable material on the river bed mitigate erosion (Jansen 2006), removing this armoring layer of gravel, boulders, etc. exposes the channel bed to the erosive force of the water.   “On the Russian River near Healdsburg, California, instream pit mining in the 1950s and 1960s caused channel incision in excess of 3-6 m over an 11-km length of river” (Kondolf et. al. 2002). 

Tectonics play an important role in shaping landscapes and rivers, and tectonic uplift and river incision go hand in hand. Over geologic time, as mountains rise higher, water erodes deep gorges and channels, dissecting the landscape. In some instances, such as the Sierra Nevada mountains of California, up to 1 km of incision has been shown to have occurred over the last 5 million years (Lavé 2001). “River erosion is one of the primary agents of landscape evolution. Outside of glaciated regions, rivers are responsible for sculpting uplifted terrain into arborescent valley networks and creating the relief that drives gravitational transport processes such as landsliding” (Tucker, et. al. 2002).  Rivers and streams that cross tectonic boundaries are subject to immense geomorphic change. When an area in the path of a river is uplifted, the river must either divert, or slowly incise into the uplifted area, creating a gorge or canyonn(Schumm, et. al. 2002).

==Effects==
===Groundwater level drop===
As a channel bed drops, the water in the surrounding aquifer runs into the stream, lowering the water table. This modifies the flow regime of a stream, and can lead to a large reduction in summer flows (Neal 2009). Prolonged incision can lower the water table to the point where the roots of the riparian vegetation can no longer access it for water, causing the death of the riparian forest and thus a loss of soil stability, contributing to increased sedimentation (Lowrance et. al. 1997). Riparian forests are some of the most productive and diverse ecosystems on the planet and are for this reason the focus of many restoration projects throughout the United States.

===Change in hillslope form===
At low erosion rates increased stream incision may make gentle slopes to erode creating convex-up forms. Convex slopes around a stream can thus indirectly reflect accelerated [[tectonics|crustal uplift]]. This is because accelerated incision may trigger accelerated erosion on the adjacent slopes creating slopes progressively steeper slopes that are in equilibrium with high erosion rates.&lt;ref name=Simons1962&gt;{{Citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29231">'''Scriptural geologists''' (or '''Mosaic geologists''') were a heterogeneous group of writers in the early nineteenth century, who claimed "the primacy of [[Biblical literalism|literalistic]] biblical [[exegesis]]" and a short [[Young Earth creationism|Young Earth]] time-scale.{{sfn|Rudwick|1988|pp=42-44}} Their views were marginalised and ignored by the [[scientific community]] of their time.{{sfn|Rudwick|1988|pp=42-44}}{{sfn|Rudwick|2008|p=84, "But since [William Henry Fitton] and other geologists regarded [scriptural geology] as scientifically worthless…"}}{{sfn|Wood|2004|p=168}} They "had much the same relationship to 'philosophical' (or scientific) geologists as their indirect descendants, the twentieth-century creationists."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rudwick|1988|pp=42–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Wood describes them as "mostly Anglican evangelicals" with "no institutional focus and little sense of commonality".{{sfn|Wood|2004|p=169}} They generally lacked any background in geology,{{sfn|Piccardi|2007|p=46}}{{sfn|Livingstone|Hart|Noll|1999|pp=186–187}} and had little influence even in church circles.&lt;ref name="Piccardi2007"&gt;{{harvnb|Piccardi|2007|p=46}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===Reason for appearance===
Up until the end of the 18th century Classical British scholarship was theologically based, using the Bible as a basic source for world history and chronology.{{sfn|O'Connor|2007|pp=361–362}} Early work in the developing science of [[geology]] sought "theories of the Earth" combining mechanical [[physical law]]s in the [[natural philosophy]] of [[René Descartes]] with belief in the [[Genesis flood narrative|global flood]] described in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] [[s:Bible (Wikisource)/Genesis#Chapter 6|6-8]].{{sfn|Young|Stearley|2008|pp=62–65}} The Genesis Flood was given serious consideration as a basis for explaining geological data, and though by 1800 naturalists accepted an old-earth cosmology, this was not an inevitable conclusion among the educated. Amateur and popular geologists continued to use scripture centred geology well into the 19th century.{{sfn|O'Connor|2007|pp=361–362}}{{sfn|Rupke|1983|pp=42-50}}{{sfn|Millhauser|1954|p=67}}
 
In the 18th century, geologists became convinced that an immense time had been needed to build up the huge thickness of rock [[stratum|strata]] visible in quarries and cliffs, implying extensive pre-human periods. The concept of [[Neptunism]] taught by [[Abraham Gottlob Werner]] proposed that rock strata had been deposited from a primeval global ocean rather than by Noah's Flood. Opposing this, [[James Hutton]] proposed an indefinitely old cycle of eroded rocks being deposited in the sea, consolidated and heaved up by volcanic forces into mountains which in turn eroded, all in natural processes which continue to operate.{{sfn|Young|Stearley|2008|pp=74–89}}
By 1807 when the [[Geological Society of London]] was founded as the first professional geological society,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geolsoc.org.uk/gsl/society/bicentenary Bicentenary of Geological Society of London]&lt;/ref&gt; most of its members accepted a basic [[Geologic time scale#History and nomenclature of the time scale|geologic time scale]], and researchers including [[William Smith (geologist)|William Smith]] had found that strata could be identified by characteristic [[fossil]]s.{{sfn|Young|1995}}

Theologians sought to reconcile scripture, the book of God's word, with natural history, the book of God's works. [[Thomas Chalmers]] (a minister of the Scottish Kirk) popularised [[Gap creationism]] (or "interval" theory),  a form of [[old Earth creationism]] that posits that the six-day creation as described in the [[Book of Genesis]] involved literal 24-hour days, but that there was a gap of time between two distinct creations in the first and the second verses of Genesis, explaining many scientific observations, including the [[age of the Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;''Evolution vs. Creationism: An Introduction'', [[Eugenie Scott]], pp61-62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Scientific Case Against Scientific Creationism'', Jon P. Alston, p24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/wic.html What is Creationism?], Mark Isaak, [[TalkOrigins Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Chalmers' suggestion was supported by theological liberals, what Milton Millhauser referred to as the party of "reconciliation," such as [[Edward Hitchcock]], [[William Daniel Conybeare|W. D. Conybeare]], and the future [[Cardinal Wiseman]]. [[Sharon Turner]] included it in his children's book ''A Sacred History of the World.''  Millhauser wrote that "Its prestige was such that the " interval" theory presently became almost the official British rival to the continental one that interpreted the Six Days as six creative eras,"  adding his subjective estimate that "until about 1850, the casual pulpit or periodical assurance that geology does not conflict with revelation was based, in possibly seven instances out of ten, on Chalmers' "interval" theory."{{sfn|Millhauser|1954|pp=66–70}}

The research of [[Georges Cuvier]] indicated "repeated irruptions and retreats of the sea" which he identified with a long series of sudden catastrophes which had caused [[extinction]]s: when this was translated into English in 1813, [[Robert Jameson]] added suggestions that the last catastrophe was the biblical Deluge. The [[Church of England]] clergyman [[William Buckland]] became the foremost proponent of [[Flood geology]], proposing in 1819 that certain surface features were evidence of violent flooding during the Deluge as the last of a series of catastrophes.{{sfn|Young|1995}}

Historian of Religion Arthur McCalla considers that "All geological work that was taken seriously by experts took for granted the reality of deep time" and that scriptural geologists were not given "the slightest credence" by working geologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McCalla|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ralph O'Connor, a history professor at the University of Aberdeen, considers McCalla's views to be an "overstatement", and states that "the 'orthodoxy' of an old-earth cosmology was not there for the taking; it had to be painstakingly constructed, using various performance strategies designed to persuade the literate classes that the new school of geology trumped biblical exegesis in questions about earth history."{{sfn|O'Connor|2007|p=361}}

The British scriptural geologists' writings came in two waves. The first, in the 1820s, was in response to [[Gap creationism|'gap theory']] and included [[Granville Penn]]'s ''A Comparative Estimate of the Mineral and Mosaical Geologies'' (1822) and [[George Bugg]]'s ''Scriptural Geology'' (1826). Realizing that the majority opinion was slipping away from scriptural geology, their zeal increased.  While the period from 1815-1830 represents the incubation of the movement, 1830 to 1844 marks its most intense and significant activity.{{sfn|Millhauser|1954|p=72}}  This was largely in response to [[Charles Lyell]]'s ''[[Principles of Geology]]'' and Buckland's [[Bridgewater Treatise]], ''Geology and Mineralogy considered with reference to Natural Theology'', which retracted his earlier ideas that flood geology had found evidence of a universal flood. Responses included [[George Fairholme|George Fairholme's]] ''General View of the Geology of Scripture'' (1833) and ''The Mosaic Deluge'' (1837).{{sfn|Livingstone|Hart|Noll|1999|pp=178–179}}

O'Connor wrote of the times that, "Although secularization in various forms was on the ascendant among the upper and upper-middle classes, the Bible was still the most important book in early nineteenth-century British cultural life. Although liberalizing churchmen were busily instructing people that the Bible was not intended to teach facts about the natural world, the text of Genesis 1 appeared on the face of it to suggest otherwise, with its bald statements of what had been created when. For all but a growing minority, the Bible remained a vital touchstone for speculation about the natural world; conversely, any thoughtful reading of the first few chapters of Genesis necessarily involved reflections about the natural world."{{sfn|O'Connor|2007|p=391}}

===Geological competence===
Professor of [[intellectual history]] [[David N. Livingstone]] states that scriptural geologists "were not, as it turns out, geologists at all", concluding that "while it may be proper to speak of Scriptural ''Geology'', it is not really accurate to speak of Scriptural ''Geologists''."{{sfn|Livingstone|Hart|Noll|1999|pp=186–187}} L. Piccardi and W. Bruce Masse state that "[a]part from [[George Young (Presbyterian minister)|George Young]], none of these scriptural geologists had any geological competence".{{sfn|Piccardi|2007|p=46}} David Clifford states that they were "not themselves geologists" but rather "keen but biased amateurs" and that one of them, James Mellor Brown, "felt that no scientific expertise was required when examining scientific matters."{{sfn|Clifford|2006|pp=133–134}} Taking a more positive view, Milton Millhauser states that the leaders of the party were "by no means ignorant of the science [they] assailed."{{sfn|Millhauser|1954|p=73}}

O'Connor argues that terminology in the 21st-century is a stumbling-block to modern analysis of geologic competence of the scriptural geologists because science today is understood in the language of [[Charles Lyell|Lyell]] and [[Charles darwin|Darwin]] rather than that of [[Granville Penn|Penn]] and [[George Fairholme|Fairholme]]. Scriptural geologists saw themselves as 'geologists' (in the early 19th-century understanding of the term) and valued geologic fieldwork.  Biblical exegesis, too, was central to science in general and earth history in particular.{{sfn|O'Connor|2007|pp=362}}  For the educated of the early 19th-century the Bible was itself valuable evidence. Evidence does not speak for itself, but requires interpretation. A heap of strata, or a line of Hebrew, is interpreted in various ways. To use the words 'geology' or 'science' in the 21st century sense automatically excludes Scriptural geologist perspectives on this debate, and skews the discussion from the start.{{sfn|O’Connor|2007|pp=361–362}}

They have been described as "genteel laymen ... versed in polite literature; clergymen, linguists, and antiquaries—those, in general, with vested interests in mediating the meaning of books, rather than rocks, in churches and classrooms", although a number of them were involved in fossil collecting or scientific endeavours. However, for the majority, geology was not their main scientific interest, but rather a transient or peripheral concern.{{sfn|O'Connor|2007|pp=371–373}}

;Theologians
:;Thomas Gisborne
{{main article|Thomas Gisborne}}
:Thomas Gisborne, B.A. in 1780, M.A. in 1783, from St. John's College, Cambridge, became a close friend of [[William Wilberforce]] whom he met in college.  Gisborne wrote thirteen books, many of which went through numerous printings (two were interpreted into Welsh and German). Two of his books were related to science: ''Testimony of Natural Theology to Christianity'' (1818) and ''Considerations on Modern Theories of Geology'' (1837).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Connor|2007|p=371}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

:;Sir William Cockburn, 11th Baronet

Gillispie described  "reasonably respectable" [[Sir William Cockburn, 11th Baronet|William Cockburn]], [[Dean of York]], as spouting clerical "fulminations against science in general and all its works",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gillispie|1996|p=152}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and writing&lt;ref name="SpecificallyThe"&gt;Specifically: ''The Bible Defended Against the British Association'' (1839) and ''A Letter to Professor Buckland Concerning the Origin of the World'' (1838)&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Sir William Cockburn, 11th Baronet#Attitude to Geology and Geological Competence|clerical attacks on geology]] and uninformed attempts to frame theoretical systems reconciling the geological and scriptural records."{{sfn|Gillispie|1996|p=248}}

:;George Bugg
:[[George Bugg]], B.A. in 1795 from St. John's College, Cambridge, was ordained deacon in York and became a priest and curate of Dewsbury, near Leeds. Bugg's most significant work was his two-volume ''Scriptural Geology''. Volume I (361 pages) appeared in 1826. Volume II (356 pages) was published in 1827.{{sfn|O'Connor|2007|pp=367, 371}}  Although critics would object to associating geology with the Bible as a repetition of the mistakes the church made at the time of Galileo, Bugg held that there was a significant difference.  Copernicus could easily reconcile his theory with scripture.  But according to Bugg, modern geologists could not harmonize the Bible with their theories without changing the meaning of the scriptures.{{sfn|O'Connor|2007|pp=367-68}}  He contended that "the history of creation has one plain, obvious, and consistent meaning, throughout all the Word of God." There is no hint of any other meaning than the obvious one in the rest of Scripture unless the Biblical authors have misled their readers.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}  Millhouse quotes Bugg saying, "Was ever the ''word of God'' laid so deplorably prostrate at the feet of an infant and precocious science!"{{sfn|Millhauser|1954|p=71}}  Wood says the Bugg was "an embittered clergyman who could not find a [[Benefice#Church of England|benefice]]".{{sfn|Wood|2004|p=169}}

:;George Young
:[[George Young (Presbyterian minister)|George Young]], B.A. in 1801 from the University of Edinburgh, studied literature and excelled in mathematics and natural philosophy under the tutelage of Professor [[John Playfair]].  In 1806 he became the pastor of the Chapel in Cliff Street serving for 42 years until his death. He wrote ''A Geological Survey of the Yorkshire Coast'', (with John Bird in 1822, 2nd ed. 1828){{sfn|O'Connor|2007|p=375}} and ''Scriptural Geology'' (1838).{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} He was a fossil collector and dealer.{{sfn|O'Connor|2007|p=372}}

:Geologist Martin Simpson described Young's ''Geological Survey'' as "in every way worthy of a pupil of the celebrated Playfair."{{sfn|Simpson|1884|pp=iv-v}}  And, Piccardi and Masse said that George Young was geologically competent.&lt;ref name="Piccardi2007" /&gt;

;Scientists
:;Andrew Ure
:[[Andrew Ure]], M.A. in 1799, M.D. in 1801 in Glasgow, was a scientist and physician. He served briefly as an army surgeon then in 1803 became a member of the Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons in Glasgow as Professor of Natural Philosophy (specializing in chemistry and physics) at the Andersonian Institution (now the University of Strathclyde).{{sfn|O'Connor|2007|p=372}}  He was probably the first consulting chemist in Britain and highly esteemed by contemporary scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Millhauser|1954|p=71}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote ''A Dictionary of Chemistry'' (1821), ''Elements of the Art of Dyeing'' (1824), and ''A New System of Geology'' (1829).{{sfn|O'Connor|2007|p=375}}{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

:The leading [[University of Cambridge]] geologist [[Adam Sedgwick]], a Church of England clergyman, condemned ''A New System of Geology'' pulling "it to pieces without mercy" and calling it a "monument of folly".{{sfn|Brooke|Cantor|2000|p=62}}{{sfn|Clark|1970|p=362}}  Gillispie chastised Andrew Ure as of the "men of the lunatic fringe"{{sfn|Brooke|Cantor|2000|p=57}} who produced clerical "fulminations against science in general and all its works".{{sfn|Gillispie|1996|p=152}} Ure was not a cleric.

:;George Fairholme
:[[George Fairholme]] was a wealthy banker and landowner,{{sfn|O'Connor|2007|p=371}} self-taught naturalist.  He was not opposed to studying geology; rather, he did battle with the new theories which were, in his view, inconsistent with Scripture and scientific facts.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Millhauser|1954|p=73}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Genesis did not teach science or geology, rather, it offers a true grasp of earth history for geologists to follow. He tried to show from geology and geography that a global Flood had molded the continents. The strata, in his view, were connected chiefly with the Flood.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Charles Gillispie listed Fairholme as among "the lunatic fringe."{{sfn|Brooke|Cantor|2000|p=57}} But Millhauser said he was "by no means ignorant of the science [he] assailed"{{sfn|Millhauser|1954|p=73}}

:;John Murray
:[[John Murray (science lecturer)|John Murray]] was self-taught early in his career, but he eventually obtained M.A. and Ph. D. degrees. While traveling widely to observe geological and archeological sites, he lectured and conducted experimental field research using chemical analysis to study rocks and fossils.{{sfn|O'Connor|2007|p=372  "Murray only failed to gain the chemistry chair at King's College, London, in 1831, because of his refusal to join the Church of England (he was a staunch Presbyterian)."}}

;Other
:;Granville Penn
:[[Granville Penn]] attended Magdalen College, Oxford and became an assistant chief clerk in the War Department.  His major work on geology (1822) was ''A Comparative Estimate of the Mineral and Mosaical Geologies''.{{sfn|O'Connor|2007|pp=372, 373}} Penn made no claim to be a geologist, yet he read the geological literature of his day.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Millhauser|1954|p=71}} "a scholar of some competence, who had studied geology."&lt;/ref&gt;

:Contemporary [[Hugh Miller]] described Granville Penn as one of "the abler and more respectable anti-geologists" and "certainly one of the most extensively informed of his class,"{{sfn|Miller|1857|pp=367–68}}  But where Penn's view of Biblical verses conflicted with Millers own views, Miller labeled Penn's views as "mere idle glosses, ignorantly or surreptitiously introduced into the text by ancient copyists."{{sfn|Clifford|2006|p=133}} Gillispie chastised Penn as among "men of the lunatic fringe, ... [who] got out their fantastic geologies and natural histories, a literature which enjoyed surprising vogue, but which is too absurd to disinter".{{sfn|Brooke|Cantor|2000|p=57}} Millhauser said the Penn "had come to suspect it [the new geology] of a tendency toward [[Lucretius|Lucretian]] materialism."{{sfn|Millhauser|1954|p=71}}

==Reception==

===By historians of science===
A number of modern historians have "rounded on scriptural geologists as simplistic fundamentalists who defended an untenable and anti-scientific worldview". Historian of science Charles Gillispie chastised a number of them as "men of the lunatic fringe, like Granville Penn, John Faber, Andrew Ure, and George Fairholme, [who] got out their fantastic geologies and natural histories, a literature which enjoyed surprising vogue, but which is too absurd to disinter".{{sfn|Brooke|Cantor|2000|p=57}} Gillispie describes their views, along with their "reasonably respectable" colleagues (such as Edward Bouverie Pusey and [[Sir William Cockburn, 11th Baronet|William Cockburn]], [[Dean of York]]), as clerical "fulminations against science in general and all its works",{{sfn|Gillispie|1996|p=152}} and listed the works of Cockburn&lt;ref name="SpecificallyThe" /&gt; and Fairholme&lt;ref&gt;Specifically: ''New and Conclusive Physical Demonstrations: Both of the Fact and Period of the Mosaic Deluge and of Its Having Been the Only Event of the Kind that Has Ever Occurred upon the Earth'' (1838)&lt;/ref&gt; as among "[[Sir William Cockburn, 11th Baronet#Attitude to Geology and Geological Competence|clerical attacks on geology]] and uninformed attempts to frame theoretical systems reconciling the geological and scriptural records."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gillispie|1996|p=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin J. S. Rudwick]] initially dismissed them as mere 'dogmatic irritants', but later discerned a couple of points of consilience: a concern with time and sequence; and an adoption of the pictorial conventions of some scriptural geologists by the mainstream.{{sfn|Brooke|Cantor|2000|p=57}}

'''Selkies''' (also spelled ''silkies'', ''sylkies'', ''selchies'') or '''Selkie folk''' ({{lang-sco|selkie fowk}}) meaning "'''Seal Folk'''"{{Efn|''selkie'' simply means "seal" in Scots dialect. {{harvp|Bruford|1974}}, p. 78, note 1. {{harvp|Bruford|1997|p=120}}.}} are mythological beings capable of [[therianthropy]], changing from [[pinniped|seal]] to human form by shedding their skin.

These selkie folk are recounted in [[Scottish mythology|Scottish folklore]], sourced mainly from [[Northern Isles|Orkney and Shetland]].

The [[Folklore genre|folk-tales]] frequently revolve around female selkies being coerced into relationships with humans by someone stealing and hiding their sealskin, thus exhibiting the tale motif of the [[swan maiden]] type.

While "selkies" is the proper term for such shapeshifters according to an [[Orcadians|Orcadian]] folklorist, treatises on [[Shetland]] refer to them merely as '''[[merman|mermen]]''' or '''[[mermaid|merwomen]]'''.

There are counterparts in [[Faroe Islands|Faroese]] and [[Iceland]]ic [[folklore]] that speak of seal-women and seal-skin. In some instances the Irish mermaid ([[merrow]]) is regarded as a half-seal, half-human being.

==Terminology==
The [[Scots language|Scots]] word ''{{lang|sco|selkie}}'' is diminutive for ''{{lang|sco|selch}}'' which strictly speaking means "grey seal"&lt;!--Brit spelling--&gt; (''[[Halichoerus grypus]]''). Alternate spellings for the diminutive include: selky, seilkie, sejlki, silkie, silkey, saelkie, sylkie, etc.&lt;ref name="DSL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dsl.ac.uk/entry/snd/selch |title=Selch |date=2004 |website=Scottish National Dictionary |publisher=DSL |accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "selkie" according to [[Alan Bruford]] should be treated as meaning any seal with or without the implication of transformation into human form.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bruford|1974}}, p. 78, note 1: "A selkie is simply a seal, though readers of the ballad [on the selkie] have tended to assume that in itself it means a seal which can take human form". {{harvp|Bruford|1997|p=120}}: "‘selkie’ in itself does not imply the ability to take human form any more than ‘seal’ does".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Walter Traill Dennison|W. Traill Dennison]] insisted "selkie" was the correct term to be applied to these shapeshifters, to be distinguished from the merfolk, and that [[Samuel Hibbert-Ware|Samuel Hibbert]] committed an error in referring to them as "mermen" and "mermaids".{{sfnp|Dennison|1893|p=173}} However, when other Norse cultures are examined, Icelandic writers also refer to the seal-wives as merfolk ({{lang|is|marmennlar}}).&lt;ref name=jon_gudmundsson-eng/&gt;

There also seems to be some conflation between the selkie and [[finfolk]]. This confounding only existed in Shetland, claimed Dennison, and that in Orkney the selkie are distinguished from the [[finfolk]], and the selkies' abode undersea is not "Finfolk-a-heem";{{sfnp|Dennison|1893|pp=172–173}} this notion, although seconded by [[Ernest Marwick]],&lt;ref&gt;Marwick, Ernest W. (1975) ''The Folklore of Orkney and Shetland'', London, B. T. Batsford: "in Shetland, Fin Folk and Seal Folk were frequently confused, but in Orkney they were completely distinguished", p. 25, cf. pp. 48–49, quoted by Burford&lt;/ref&gt; has been challenged by [[Alan Bruford|Bruford]].{{sfnp|Bruford|1997|p=121}}

There is further confusion with the Norse concept of the [[Finns]] as shapeshifters,{{sfnp|Bruford|1997|p=121}} "Finns" (synonymous with finfolk&lt;ref name="SND-finn"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dsl.ac.uk/entry/snd/finn |title=Finn |date=2004 |website=Scottish National Dictionary |publisher=DSL |accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) being the Shetlandic name for dwellers of the sea who could remove their seal-skin and transform into humans according to one native correspondent.{{Refn|group="lower-alpha"|George Sinclair Jr., an informant for [[Karl Blind]]. This intelligence about the "Finns" was also repeated by [[Francis James Child]] in his annotation to ballad 113, "[[The Great Silkie of Sule Skerry]]".&lt;ref name=child/&gt;}}&lt;ref name=blind/&gt;

;Gaelic terms
In [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] stories, specific terms for selkies are rarely used. They are seldom differentiated from [[mermaid]]s. They are most commonly referred to as ''maighdeann-mhara'' in [[Scottish Gaelic]], ''maighdean mhara'' in [[irish language|Irish]], and ''moidyn varrey'' in [[Manx language|Manx]] &lt;ref&gt;Fargher, C. ''English Manx-Dictionary'' Shearwater Press 1979&lt;/ref&gt; ("maiden of the sea" i.e. mermaids) and clearly have the seal-like attributes of selkies.&lt;ref name=TaD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tobarandualchais.co.uk/fullrecord/74582/1 |title=Maighdeann-mhara a' tionndadh na boireannach |last=MacIntyre |first=Michael |date=1972 |website=School of Scottish Studies |language=gd |publisher=Tobar an Dualchais |accessdate=5 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The only term which specifically refers to a selkie but which is only rarely encountered is ''maighdeann-ròin'', or "seal maiden".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tobarandualchais.co.uk/fullrecord/46882/1 |title=A' mhaighdeann-ròin a chaidh air ais dhan mhuir |last=Fleming |first=Cirsty Mary |date=1973 |website=School of Scottish Studies |language=gd |publisher=Tobar an Dualchais |accessdate=26 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scottish legend==

Many of the folk-tales on selkie folk have been collected from the [[Northern Isles]] (Orkney and Shetland).&lt;ref name="Lore of Scotland"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1-ORpjD6XEcC&amp;pg=PA404 |title=The Lore of Scotland: A guide to Scottish legends |publisher=Arrow Books |last1=Westwood |first1=Jennifer |last2=Kingshill |first2=Sophia |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2011 |pages=404–405 |isbn=9780099547167 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Orkney]] lore, ''selkie'' is said to denote various seals of greater size than the grey seal&lt;!-- ''P. vitulina''--&gt;; only these large seals are credited with the ability to shapeshift into humans, and are called "selkie folk".{{sfnp|Dennison|1893|p=172}} Something similar is stated in [[Shetland]] tradition, that the mermen and mermaids prefer to assume the shape of larger seals, referred to as "Haaf-fish".{{sfnp|Hibbert|1891|p=261}}

===Selkie wife and human lover===

A typical folk-tale is that of a man who steals a female selkie's skin, finds her naked on the sea shore, and compels her to become his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hiestand|1992|p=331}}: "Those are always the basic ingredients: an unmarried farmer, a seal-skin, a naked woman in the waves".&lt;/ref&gt; But the wife will spend her time in captivity longing for the sea, her true home, and will often be seen gazing longingly at the ocean. She may bear several children by her human husband, but once she discovers her skin, she will immediately return to the sea and abandon the children she loved. Sometimes, one of her children discovers or knows the whereabouts of the skin.{{Refn|group="lower-alpha"|The child with a sore on her feet reveals it to be in the aisins (space beneath the eaves) in the Orkney version from [[North Ronaldsay]], the mother told the child she was looking for the skin for her, so she could make a rivlin (shoe) to heal her sore.}}{{Efn|The children found the skin under a sheaf of corn (wheat or other grain) in the tale about the man of [[Unst]], Shetland.}} Sometimes it is revealed she already had a first husband from her own kind.&lt;ref name=shetland-mermaid-wife&gt;Shetland version localized in [[Unst]]: {{harvp|Hibbert|1891|pp=262–263}}; {{harvp|Keightley|1850|pp=169–171}}: "The Mermaid Wife".&lt;/ref&gt;{{Refn|Orcadian versions: Dennison (tale from [[North Ronaldsay]]);{{sfnp|Dennison|1893|pp=173–175}} Capt. Clark Kennedy (1884, tale from Stromness skipper)&lt;ref name="Baily's Magazine"/&gt;}} Although in some [[Children's literature|children's story]] versions, the selkie revisits her family on land once a year,&lt;!--her children and playing with them in the waves--&gt; in the typical folktale she is never seen again by them.{{sfnp|Hiestand|1992|p=332}}
Sometimes the human will not know that their lover is a selkie, and wakes to find them returned to their seal form.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} In one version, the selkie wife was never seen again (at least in human form) by the family, but the children would witness a large seal approach them and "greet" them plaintively.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Pottinger|1908}}, "Selkie Wife" (from [[Deerness]], Orkney), p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

Male selkies are described as being very handsome in their human form, and having great [[seductive]] powers over human women. They typically seek those who are dissatisfied with their lives, such as married women waiting for their [[fishermen]] husbands.{{sfnp|Dennison|1893|p=172}} In one popular tattletale version about a certain "Ursilla" of Orkney (a pseudonym), it was rumored that when she wished to make contact with her male selkie would shed seven tears into the sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Dennison|1893|pp=175–176}}: Dennison believed it to be "an imaginary tale, invented by gossips".&lt;/ref&gt;

Children born between man and seal-folk may have webbed hands, as in the case of the Shetland mermaid whose children had a "a sort of web between their fingers",{{sfnp|Hibbert|1891|p=264}} or "Ursilla" rumored to have children sired by a male selkie, such that the children had to have the webbing between their fingers and toes made of horny material clipped away intermittently. Some of the descendants actually did have these hereditary traits, according to [[Walter Traill Dennison]] who was related to the family.{{sfnp|Dennison|1893|p=176}}{{sfnp|McEntire|2007|p=128}}

Some legends say that selkies could turn human every so often when the conditions of the tides were correct, but oral storytellers disagreed as to the time interval.{{sfnp|Dennison|1893|p=172}} In Ursilla's rumor, the contacted male selkie promised to visit her at the "seventh stream" or springtide.{{sfnp|Dennison|1893|p=176}} In the ballad ''[[The Great Silkie of Sule Skerry]]'', the seal-husband promised to return in seven years; the number "seven" being commonplace in balladry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Wimberly |first=Louis Charles |author-link=&lt;!--Louis Charles Wimberly--&gt; |title=Minstrelsy, Music, and the Dance in ''The English and Scottish Popular Ballads'' |place=Linconln |publisher=U of Nebraska |year=1921 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r5dNAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA89 |page=89 |series=University of Nebraska Studies in Language, Literature, and Criticism, 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one version, the selkie could only assume human form once every seven years because they are bodies that house condemned souls.&lt;ref name="Baily's Magazine"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kennedy  |first= Capt. Clark |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r5obAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA355 |title=Wild Sport in the Orkney Isles |journal=Baily's Magazine of Sports &amp; Pastimes |date=July 1884 |volume=42 |pages=355–356, 406–407}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is the notion that they are either humans who had committed sinful wrongdoing,{{sfnp|Dennison|1893|p=172}} or fallen angels.{{sfnp|Dennison|1893|p=172}}{{sfnp|Hibbert|1891|p=264}}

== Orkney tales ==&lt;!--Orkney selkie wife tales--&gt;

The selkie-wife tale had its version for practically every island of Orkney according to [[Walter Traill Dennison|W. Traill Dennison]]. In his study, he included a version collected from a resident of [[North Ronaldsay]], in which a "goodman of Wastness", a confirmed bachelor, falls in love with a damsel among the selkie-folk, whose skin he captures. She searches the house in his absence, and finds her seal-skin thanks to her youngest daughter who had once seen it being hidden under the roof.{{sfnp|Dennison|1893|pp=173–175}}

In "Selkie Wife", a version from [[Deerness]] on the [[Mainland, Orkney]], the husband locked away the seal-skin in a sea-kist ([[Chest (furniture)|chest]]) and hid the key, but the seal woman is said to have acquiesced to the concealment, saying it was "better tae keep her selkie days oot o' her mind".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Pottinger|1908|pp=173–175}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when she discovered her skin, she departed hastily leaving her clothes all scattered about.{{sfnp|McEntire|2007|p=128}}

A fisherman named Alick supposedly gained a wife by stealing the seal-skin of a selkie, in a tale told by an Orkney [[Skipper (boating)|skipper]]. The Alick in the tale is given as a good acquaintance of the father of the storyteller, John Heddle of [[Stromness]].&lt;ref name="Baily's Magazine"/&gt;

==Shetland tales==

A version of the tale about the mermaid compelled to become wife to a human who steals her seal-skin, localized in [[Unst]], was published by [[Samuel Hibbert-Ware|Samuel Hibbert]] in 1822. She already had a husband of her own kind in her case.&lt;ref name=shetland-mermaid-wife/&gt;

Some stories from Shetland have selkies luring islanders into the sea at [[midsummer]], the lovelorn humans never returning to dry land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/environment/dramatic-decline-in-island-common-seal-populations-baffles-experts-1-678745 |title=Dramatic decline in island common seal populations baffles experts |last=Hardie |first=Alison |date=20 January 2007 |work=[[The Scotsman]] |accessdate=17 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Shetland, the sea-folk were believed to revert to human shape and breathed air in the atmosphere in the submarine homeland, but with their sea-dress (seal-skin) they had the ability to transform into seals to make transit from there to the reefs above the sea. However, each skin was unique and irreplaceable.{{sfnp|Hibbert|1891|p=261}}

In the tale of "Gioga's Son", a group of seals resting in the [[Ve Skerries]] were ambushed and skinned by [[Papa Stour]] fishermen, but as these were actually seal-folk, the spilling of the blood caused a surge in seawater, and one fisherman was left abandoned. The seal-folk victims recovered in human-like form, but lamented the loss of their skin without which they could not return to their submarine home. Ollavitinus was particularly distressed since he was now separated from his wife; however, his mother Gioga struck a bargain with the abandoned seaman, offering to carrying him back to Papa Stour on condition the skin would be returned.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hibbert|1891|pp=262–263}}; {{harvp|Keightley|1850|pp=167–169}}: "Gioga's son".&lt;/ref&gt; In a different telling of the same plot line, the stranded man is called Herman Perk, while the rescuing selkie's name is unidentified.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolson, John (1920) "Herman Perk and the Seal",''Some Folk-Tales and Legends of Shetland'', Edinburgh: Thomas Allan and Sons, pp. 62–63. Cited by [[D. L. Ashliman|Ashliman, D. L.]] (2000–2011), "[https://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type4080.html The Mermaid Wife]"&lt;/ref&gt;

Tales of the seal bride type has been assigned the number ML 4080 under [[Reidar Thoralf Christiansen]]'s system of classification of migratory folktales.{{sfnp|Bruford|1997|pp=121–122}}{{sfnp|McEntire|2007|p=126}} These stories of selkie-wives are also recognized to be of the [[swan maiden]] motif type.&lt;ref name="Monaghan"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nd9R6GQBB_0C&amp;pg=PA411 |title=The Encyclopedia of Celtic Mythology and Folklore |publisher=Infobase Publishing |last=Monaghan |first=Patricia |year=2009 |page=411 |isbn=978-1438110370 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are now hundreds of seal bride type tales that have been found from Ireland to Iceland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Berry |first=Robert James |last2=Firth |first2=Howie N. |title=The People of Orkney |publisher=Orkney Press |year=1986 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5lWgAAAAMAAJ |pages=172, 206|isbn=9780907618089 }}. Cited by {{sfnp|Bruford|1997|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only one specimen was found in Norway by Christiansen.{{sfnp|Bruford|1997|p=122}}

In the [[Faroe Islands]] there are analogous beliefs in seal-folk and seal-women also.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NigkAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=irish+seal |last=Spence |first=Lewis |title=The Minor Traditions of British Mythology |publisher=Ayer Publishing |year=1972 |origyear=1948 |pages=50–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seal [[shapeshifters]] similar to the selkie exist in the folklore of many cultures. A corresponding creature existed in Swedish legend, and the [[Chinook people]] of North America have a similar tale of a boy who changes into a seal.

==Icelandic folk-tales==

The folk-tale "''Selshamurinn''" ("The Seal-Skin") published by [[Jón Árnason (author)|Jón Árnason]] offers an Icelandic analogue of the selkie folk tale.&lt;ref name=booth/&gt; The tale relates how a man from Mýrdalur forced a woman transformed from a seal to marry him after taking possession of her seal-skin. She discovers the key to the chest in her husband's usual clothes when he dresses up for a Christmas outing, and the seal woman is reunited with the male seal who was her betrothed partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Jón Árnason|1862|pp=632–634}} "Selshamurinn"; {{harvp|Jón Árnason|Simpson (tr.)|1972|pp=100–102}} "The Seal's Skin "; {{harvp|Jón Árnason|Boucher (tr.)|1977|pp=81–82}} "The Seal-Skin", etc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ashliman (tr.)|2000}} "The Sealskin".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rune"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vikingrune.com/selkies-folktale/ |title=The Seal's Skin: Icelandic Folktale |website=The Viking Rune |accessdate=12 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another such tale was recorded by [[Jón Guðmundsson the Learned]] (in 1641), and according to him these seal folk were sea-dwelling elves called ''marmennlar'' ([[merman|mermen]] and [[mermaid]]s).&lt;ref name=jon_gudmundsson-eng&gt;{{Cite book|ref={{SfnRef|Jón Árnason|Powell (tr.)|Magnússon (tr.)|1866}}|author=Jón Árnason |translator1=George E.

==Faroese legends==
In the [[Faroe Islands]] there are two versions of the story of the 'seal wife'. A young farmer from the town of [[Mikladalur]] on [[Kalsoy]] island goes to the beach to watch the selkies dance. He hides the skin of a beautiful selkie maid so she cannot go back to sea, and forces her to marry him. He keeps her skin in a chest, and keeps the key with him both day and night. One day when out fishing, he discovers that he has forgotten to bring his key. When he returns home, the selkie wife has escaped back to sea, leaving their children behind. Later, when the farmer is out on a hunt, he kills both her selkie husband and two selkie sons, and she promises to take revenge upon the men of Mikladalur.  Some shall be drowned, some shall fall from cliffs and slopes, and this shall continue, until so many men have been lost that they will be able to link arms around the whole island of [[Kalsoy]]. There are still occasional deaths occurring in this way on the island.
[[File:Selkie statue in Mikladalur.jpeg|alt=|thumb|Statue of the selkie in [[Mikladalur]]]]
''Peter Kagan and the Wind'' by [[Gordon Bok]] tells of the fisherman Kagan who married a seal-woman. Against his wife's wishes he set sail dangerously late in the year, and was trapped battling a terrible storm, unable to return home. His wife shifted to her seal form and saved him, even though this meant she could never return to her human body and hence her happy home.

==Irish folklore==
The mermaid in Irish folkore (sometimes called "[[merrow]]" in Hiberno-English) have been regarded as a seal-woman in some instances. In a certain collection of lore in [[County Kerry]], there is an [[onomastic]] tale in [[Tralee]] which claimed the Lee family was descended from a man who took a ''murdúch'' (mermaid) for a wife; she later escaped and joined her seal-husband, suggesting she was of the seal-folk kind.&lt;ref&gt;Domhnall Ó Murchadha ''Rannscéalta'' (1920), cited by {{harvp|Gilchrist|1921|p=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also the tradition that the [[Conneely|Conneely clan]] of [[Connemara]] was descended from seals, and it was taboo for them to kill the animals lest it bring ill luck. And since "conneely" became a moniker of the animal, many changed their surname to Connelly.&lt;ref&gt;Kinahan G. H., "[https://books.google.com/books?id=JU0x0i2r-ogC&amp;pg=PA259 Connemara Folk-Lore]", ''Folk-Lore Journal'' '''II:''' 259; ''Folklore Record'' '''IV''': 104.

==Theories of origins==
Before the advent of [[modern medicine]], many physiological conditions were untreatable. When children were born with abnormalities, it was common to blame the [[fairies]].&lt;ref name="Eason"&gt;{{cite book |last=Eason |first=Cassandra |title=Fabulous creatures, mythical monsters, and animal power symbols: a handbook |pages=147–48 |chapter=Fabulous creatures, mythical monsters and animal power symbols |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=s4AP30k4IFwC&amp;pg=PA148 |accessdate=11 May 2013 |isbn=9780275994259 |year=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The MacCodrum clan of the [[Outer Hebrides]] became known as the "MacCodrums of the seals" as they claimed to be descended from a union between a fisherman and a selkie. This was an explanation for their [[syndactyly]] – a [[hereditary]] growth of skin between their fingers that made their hands resemble [[flipper (anatomy)|flippers]].&lt;ref name="Garry"&gt;{{cite book |last=Garry |first=Jane |last2=El-Shamy |first2=Hasan |title=Archetypes and Motifs in Folklore and Literature |pages=97 |chapter=Animal brides and grooms |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Cn6pWMverBIC&amp;pg=PA97 |accessdate=11 May 2013 |isbn=9780765629531 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scottish [[folklorist]] and [[antiquarian]], [[David MacRitchie]] believed that early settlers in Scotland probably encountered, and even married, [[Finns|Finnish]] and [[Sami people|Sami]] women who were misidentified as selkies because of their sealskin [[kayak]]s and clothing.&lt;ref name="Garry"/&gt; Others have suggested that the traditions concerning the selkies may have been due to misinterpreted sightings of [[Finn-men]] ([[Inuit]] from the [[Davis Strait]]). The Inuit wore clothes and used kayaks that were both made of animal skins. Both the clothes and kayaks would lose buoyancy when saturated and would need to be dried out. It is thought that sightings of Inuit divesting themselves of their clothing or lying next to the skins on the rocks could have led to the belief in their ability to change from a seal to a man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.orkneyjar.com/folklore/selkiefolk/origins/origin5.htm |title=The Origin of the Selkie-folk: Documented Finmen sightings |last=Towrie |first=Sigurd |website=Orkneyjar.com |publisher=Sigurd Towrie |accessdate=30 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another belief is that [[shipwreck]]ed [[Spaniards]] were washed ashore, and their jet black hair resembled seals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Carole B. |last=Silver |title=Strange and Secret Peoples: Fairies and Victorian Consciousness |page=47 |isbn=978-0-19-512199-5 |year=1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[anthropologist]] A. Asbjørn Jøn has recognised, though, there is a strong body of lore that indicates that selkies "are said to be [[supernaturally]] formed from the [[souls]] of drowned people".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=A. Asbjørn |last=Jøn |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280883413 |title=Dugongs and Mermaids, Selkies and Seals |journal=Australian Folklore |volume=13 |year=1998 |pages=94–98 |isbn=978-1-86389-543-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern treatments==

Scottish poet [[George Mackay Brown]] wrote a modern prose version of the story, entitled "Sealskin".&lt;ref&gt;Brown, George Mackay (1983), "Sealskin",  ''A Time to Keep and Other Stories'', New York, Vanguard Press, pp. 172–173, cited in {{harvp|Hiestand|1992|p=330}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Selkies—or references to them—have appeared in numerous novels, songs and films, though the extent to which these reflect traditional stories varies greatly. Work where selkie lore forms the central theme include:

* ''[[A Stranger Came Ashore]]'', a [[young adult novel]] by [[Scottish people|Scottish]] author [[Mollie Hunter]]. Set on the [[Shetland Islands]] in the north of Scotland, the plot revolves around a boy who must protect his sister from the Great Selkie. 
* ''[[Song of the Sea (2014 film)|Song of the Sea]]'', an Irish animated film about a young boy who must deal with the disappearance of his selkie mother and his resentment of his sister, born when his mother disappeared.
* ''[[The Secret of Roan Inish]]'', a 1994 American/Irish independent film based on the novel ''Secret of the Ron Mor Skerry'', by Rosalie K. Fry. The film's story follows a young girl who uncovers the mystery of her family's Selkie ancestry, and its connection to her lost brother.
* ''[[Selkie (film)|Selkie]]'', a 2000 [[Television of Australia|Australian]] [[Television film|made-for-TV]] film.
* ''Anchor'', a song by [[Novo Amor]] is inspired by the legend of the selkie. The video produced by Storm and Shelter features a fisherman who finds a woman at sea and rescues her, taking her home. However, her true home is the sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2015/10/novo-amor-reinterprets-the-selkie-legend-with-music-video-for-anchor-watch/|title=Novo Amor reinterprets the Selkie legend with music video for "Anchor"  — watch|date=2015-10-02|work=Consequence of Sound|access-date=2017-07-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[My Hero Academia]]'', contains a character named Selkie who possesses seal-like abilities and appearance.
* In the ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'' card game, selkies are a type of blue/green-aligned merfolk, native to the plane of ''Shadowmoor''. They are unknown from the "sunny" counterpart to ''Shadowmoor'', ''Lorwyn''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6651">"'''The shot heard round the world'''" is a phrase referring to several historical incidents, particularly the opening of the [[American Revolutionary War]] in 1775 and the [[assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] in 1914.

==Skirmish at the North Bridge==
{{Main|Battles of Lexington and Concord}}
[[File:French's Concord Minuteman statue.jpg|thumb|right|The opening stanza of "Concord Hymn" is inscribed at the base of ''The Minute Man'' statue by [[Daniel Chester French]], located at the North Bridge in [[Concord, Massachusetts]].]]
{{Quote box|align=left|width=33%|
&lt;poem&gt;By the rude bridge that arched the flood,
Their flag to April’s breeze unfurled,
Here once the embattled farmers stood,
And fired the shot heard round the world.
&lt;/poem&gt;| − Emerson, "Concord Hymn"}}
The phrase comes from the opening stanza of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]'s "[[Concord Hymn]]" (1837) and refers to the first shot of the [[American Revolution]] at the [[Old North Bridge]] in [[Concord, Massachusetts]], where the first British soldiers fell in the [[battles of Lexington and Concord]]. Historically, no single shot can be cited as the first shot of the battle or the war. Shots were fired earlier at [[Lexington, Massachusetts]] where eight Americans were killed and a British soldier was slightly wounded, but accounts of that event are confused and contradictory.&lt;ref name=globe&gt;{{cite journal |last=Parker |first=Brock |date=April 28, 2014 |title=The old tavern debate: Which town fired first? |journal=Boston Globe |volume=285 |issue=118 |pages=B1, B13 |publisher=Boston Globe Media Partners LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The North Bridge skirmish did see the first shots by Americans acting under orders, the first organized volley by Americans, the first British fatalities, and the first British retreat.

The towns of Lexington and Concord have debated over the point of origin for the Revolutionary War since 1824, when the [[Marquis de Lafayette]] visited the towns. He was welcomed to Lexington hearing it described as the "birthplace of American liberty", but he was then informed in Concord that the "first forcible resistance" was made there. President [[Ulysses Grant]] considered not attending the 1875 centennial celebrations in the area to evade the issue. In 1894, Lexington petitioned the state legislature to proclaim April 19 as "Lexington Day", to which Concord objected; the current name for the holiday is [[Patriots' Day]].&lt;ref name=globe/&gt;

Emerson lived in a house known as [[the Old Manse]] at the time when he was composing the "Concord Hymn," from which his grandfather and father (then a young child) had witnessed the skirmish. The house is located approximately {{convert|300|ft|m}} from the North Bridge.

==Assassination of Franz Ferdinand==
{{Main|Assassination of Franz Ferdinand}}

The death of Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, propelled Austria-Hungary and the rest of Europe into World War I.

==Widespread idiomatic use==
The phrase "Shot heard round the world" continues to be a stock phrase in the 21st century, widely used to refer to extraordinary events in general.&lt;ref name=spelling&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/candy-spelling/shot-heard-round-the-worl_b_3697577.html |title=Shot Heard 'Round the World |author=
Candy Spelling |date=October 2, 2013 |work=HuffPost Entertainment - The Blog |publisher=Huffington Post |accessdate=October 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase has been applied to several dramatic moments in sports history, for example. In baseball, the [[Shot Heard 'Round the World (baseball)|"Shot Heard 'Round the World"]] refers to the game-winning walk-off home run by New York Giants outfielder [[Bobby Thomson]] off Brooklyn Dodgers pitcher [[Ralph Branca]] to win the National League pennant on October 3, 1951. The Giants won the game 5-4 as a result of the home run, defeating their traditional rivals in the pennant playoff series, although they eventually lost the World Series to the Yankees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Peretz | first = Howard G. | title = It Ain't Over 'Till The Fat Lady Sings: The 100 Greatest Sports Finishes of All Time | publisher = Barnes and Nobles Books | location = New York |year=1999 | pages =4&amp;ndash;5 | ISBN=0-7607-1707-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Uluru''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|uː|l|ə|ˈ|r|uː}}, [[Pitjantjatjara dialect|Pitjantjatjara]]: ''{{Lang|pjt|Uluṟu}}''), also known as '''Ayers Rock''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɛər|z|_|ˈ|r|ɒ|k}}) and officially [[gazetted]] as "Uluru{{\}}Ayers Rock",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Place Names Register Extract: Uluru{{\}}Ayers Rock |url=http://www.ntlis.nt.gov.au/placenames/view.jsp?id=10532 |work=Northern Territory Place Names Register |publisher=Northern Territory Government |date=6 November 2002 |accessdate=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a large [[sandstone]] rock formation in the southern part of the [[Northern Territory]] in central Australia. It lies {{convert|335|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} south west of the nearest large town, [[Alice Springs]], {{convert|450|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} by road.

Uluru is sacred to the [[Pitjantjatjara]] [[Anangu]], the [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal people]] of the area. The area around the formation is home to an abundance of springs, [[depression (geology)|waterholes]], rock caves and [[cave painting|ancient paintings]]. Uluru is listed as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. Uluru and [[Kata Tjuta]], also known as the Olgas, are the two major features of the [[Uluṟu-Kata Tjuṯa National Park]].

==Name==
The local Anangu, the [[Pitjantjatjara]] people, call the landmark ''Uluṟu'' ({{IPA-aus|ʊlʊɻʊ|Pitjantjatjara}}). This word is a [[proper noun]], with no further particular meaning in the [[Pitjantjatjara dialect]], although it is used as a local family name by the senior Traditional Owners of Uluru.&lt;ref name="Issacs1980"&gt;{{cite book |title=Australian Dreaming: 40,000 Years of Aboriginal History |publisher=Lansdowne Press |location=Sydney |first=Jennifer |last=Issacs |year=1980 |pages=40–41 |isbn=0-7018-1330-X |oclc=6578832}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 July 1873, the [[Surveying|surveyor]] [[William Gosse (explorer)|William Gosse]] sighted the landmark and named it Ayers Rock in honour of the then [[Chief Secretary of South Australia]], [[Henry Ayers|Sir Henry Ayers]].&lt;ref name="engovauhistory"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.environment.gov.au/parks/uluru/culture-history/history/early-european-history.html |title=Uluṟu–Kata Tjuṯa National Park – Early European history |work=Australian Department of the Environment and Water Resources |accessdate=7 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, both names have been used.

In 1993, a [[dual naming]] policy was adopted that allowed official names that consist of both the traditional Aboriginal name and the English name. On 15 December 1993, it was renamed "Ayers Rock / Uluru" and became the first official dual-named feature in the Northern Territory. The order of the dual names was officially reversed to "Uluru / Ayers Rock" on 6 November 2002 following a request from the Regional Tourism Association in Alice Springs.&lt;ref name="dualnaming"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://placenames.nt.gov.au/policies/dualnaming |title=Dual Naming of Features |work=NT.gov.au |accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Uluru is one of Australia's most recognisable natural landmarks. The [[sandstone]] formation stands {{convert|348|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} high, rising {{convert|863|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level with most of its bulk lying underground, and has a total circumference of {{convert|9.4|km|mi|1|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="welcomeland"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.environment.gov.au/parks/publications/uluru/pubs/visitor-guide.pdf |title=Welcome to Aboriginal land: Uluṟu–Kata Tjuṯa National Park – Visitor guide and maps |publisher=Australian Department of the Environment and Water Resources |location=Canberra |date=October 2005 |accessdate=3 April 2007 |oclc=754614279 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030134047/http://www.environment.gov.au/parks/publications/uluru/pubs/visitor-guide.pdf |archivedate=30 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Uluru and the nearby [[Kata Tjuta]] formation have great cultural significance for the Aṉangu people, the traditional inhabitants of the area, who lead walking tours to inform visitors about the local flora and fauna, [[bush food]] and the [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] [[dreamtime]] stories of the area.

Uluru is notable for [[color constancy|appearing to change colour]] at different times of the day and year, most notably when it glows red at [[dawn]] and [[sunset]].

Kata Tjuta, also called Mount Olga or the Olgas, lies {{convert|25|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} west of Uluru. Special viewing areas with road access and parking have been constructed to give tourists the best views of both sites at dawn and dusk.

===Composition===
Uluru is dominantly composed of coarse-grained [[arkose]] (a type of sandstone characterized by an abundance of [[feldspar]]) and some [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]].&lt;ref name="Young_etal_2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="engovaugeology"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.environment.gov.au/parks/uluru/nature-science/geology.html |title=Uluṟu–Kata Tjuṯa National Park – Geology |publisher=Australian Department of the Environment and Water Resources |accessdate=3 April 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028194412/http://www.environment.gov.au/parks/uluru/nature-science/geology.html |archivedate=28 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Average composition is 50% feldspar, 25–35% [[quartz]] and up to 25% rock fragments; most feldspar is [[Feldspar|K-feldspar]] with only minor [[plagioclase]] as [[Roundness (geology)|subrounded]] grains and highly altered inclusions within K-feldspar.&lt;ref name="Young_etal_2002" /&gt; The grains are typically {{convert|2|–|4|mm}} in diameter, and are angular to subangular; the finer sandstone is [[Sorting (sediment)|well sorted]], with sorting decreasing with increasing [[grain size]].&lt;ref name="Young_etal_2002" /&gt; The rock fragments include subrounded [[basalt]], invariably replaced to various degrees by [[Chlorite group|chlorite]] and [[epidote]].&lt;ref name="Young_etal_2002" /&gt; The minerals present suggest derivation from a predominantly [[granite]] source, similar to the [[Musgrave Block]] exposed to the south.&lt;ref name="Sweet_1992" /&gt; When relatively fresh, the rock has a grey colour, but weathering of iron-bearing minerals by the process of [[redox|oxidation]] gives the outer surface layer of rock a red-brown rusty colour.&lt;ref name="Young_etal_2002" /&gt; Features related to deposition of the sediment include [[cross-bedding]] and [[Ripple marks|ripples]], analysis of which indicated deposition from broad shallow high energy [[fluvial]] channels and sheet flooding, typical of [[alluvial fan]]s.&lt;ref name="Young_etal_2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sweet_1992" /&gt;

===Age and origin===
[[File:UluruRockWater.jpg|thumb|left|Rain water flows off Uluru along channels marked by dark algae, forming small ponds at the base]]

The Mutitjulu Arkose is believed to be of about the same age as the [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] at [[Kata Tjuta]], and to have a similar origin despite the rock type being different, but it is younger than the rocks exposed to the east at [[Mount Conner]],&lt;ref name="Young_etal_2002" /&gt; and unrelated to them. The strata at Uluru are nearly vertical, [[Strike and dip|dipping]] to the south west at 85°, and have an exposed thickness of at least {{convert|2400|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}}. The strata dip below the surrounding plain and no doubt extend well beyond Uluru in the subsurface, but the extent is not known.

The rock was originally sand, deposited as part of an extensive [[alluvial fan]] that extended out from the ancestors of the [[Musgrave Ranges|Musgrave]], Mann and [[Petermann Ranges (Australia)|Petermann Ranges]] to the south and west, but separate from a nearby fan that deposited the sand, pebbles and cobbles that now make up Kata Tjuta.&lt;ref name="Young_etal_2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sweet_1992" /&gt;

The similar mineral composition of the Mutitjulu Arkose and the [[granite]] ranges to the south is now explained. The ancestors of the ranges to the south were once much larger than the eroded remnants we see today. They were thrust up during a [[Orogeny|mountain building]] episode referred to as the [[Petermann Orogeny]] that took place in late [[Neoproterozoic]] to early [[Cambrian]] times (550–530 [[Megaannum|Ma]]), and thus the Mutitjulu Arkose is believed to have been deposited at about the same time.

The arkose [[sandstone]] which makes up the formation is composed of grains that show little sorting based on grain size, exhibit very little rounding and the feldspars in the rock are relatively fresh in appearance. This lack of sorting and grain rounding is typical of arkosic sandstones and is indicative of relatively rapid erosion from the granites of the growing mountains to the south. The layers of sand were nearly horizontal when deposited, but were tilted to their near vertical position during a later episode of mountain building, possibly the [[Alice Springs Orogeny]] of [[Paleozoic|Palaeozoic]] age (400–300 [[Annum|Ma]]).&lt;ref name="Young_etal_2002" /&gt;

==Fauna and flora==
{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2017}}
[[File:Black-footed Rock-wallaby(small).jpg|thumb|[[Black-flanked rock-wallaby]] (''Petrogale lateralis'')]]

Historically, 46 species of native [[mammal]]s are known to have been living near Uluru; according to recent surveys there are currently 21. Aṉangu acknowledge that a decrease in the number has implications for the condition and health of the landscape. Moves are supported for the reintroduction of locally extinct animals such as [[malleefowl]], [[common brushtail possum]], [[rufous hare-wallaby]] or mala, [[bilby]], [[boodie|burrowing bettong]], and the [[black-flanked rock-wallaby]].&lt;ref name="uktnppm"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.environment.gov.au/parks/publications/uluru/pubs/management-plan.pdf |title=Uluṟu–Kata Tjuṯa National Park Plan of Management |publisher=Environment Australia |location=Canberra |author=Uluṟu–Kata Tjuṯa Board of Management |edition=4th |year=2000 |isbn=0-642-54673-8 |oclc=57667136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[mulgara]], the only mammal listed as [[vulnerable species|vulnerable]], is mostly restricted to the transitional sand plain area, a narrow band of country that stretches from the vicinity of Uluru to the northern boundary of the park and into Ayers Rock Resort. This area also contains the [[marsupial mole]], [[Aspidites ramsayi|woma python]], and [[great desert skink]].

[[File:UluruBaseTrees.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Trees at the base of Uluru]]

The [[bat]] population of the park comprises at least seven species that depend on day roosting sites within caves and crevices of Uluru and Kata Tjuta. Most of the bats forage for aerial [[predation|prey]] within {{convert|100|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} or so from the rock face. The park has a very rich [[reptile]] fauna of high conservation significance, with 73 species having been reliably recorded. Four species of [[frog]]s are [[Abundance (ecology)|abundant]] at the base of Uluru and Kata Tjuta following summer rains. The great desert skink is listed as vulnerable.

Aṉangu continue to hunt and gather animal species in remote areas of the park and on Aṉangu land elsewhere. Hunting is largely confined to the [[red kangaroo]], [[Australian bustard|bush turkey]], [[emu]], and [[lizard]]s such as the [[sand goanna]] and [[perentie]].

Of the 27 mammal species found in the park, six are introduced: the [[house mouse]], [[camel]], [[fox]], cat, dog, and [[rabbit]]. These species are distributed throughout the park, but their densities are greatest near the rich water run-off areas of Uluru and Kata Tjuta.

Uluṟu–Kata Tjuṯa National Park [[flora]] represents a large portion of plants found in Central Australia. A number of these species are considered rare and restricted in the park or the immediate region. Many rare and [[endemism|endemic]] plants are found in the park.

The growth and reproduction of plant communities rely on irregular rainfall. Some plants are able to survive fire and some are dependent on it to reproduce. Plants are an important part of ''[[Dreaming (Australian Aboriginal art)|Tjukurpa]]'', and ceremonies are held for each of the major plant foods. Many plants are associated with [[ancestor|ancestral]] beings.

Flora in Uluṟu–Kata Tjuṯa National Park can be broken into these categories:
* Punu – trees
* Puti – shrubs
* Tjulpun-tjulpunpa – flowers
* Ukiri – grasses

Trees such as the [[Acacia aneura|mulga]] and [[Corymbia opaca|centralian bloodwood]] are used to make tools such as spearheads, [[boomerang]]s, and bowls. The red [[sap]] of the bloodwood is used as a disinfectant and an inhalant for coughs and colds.

Several rare and endangered species are found in the park. Most of them, like [[Ophioglossum|adder's tongue ferns]], are restricted to the moist areas at the base of the formation, which are areas of high visitor use and subject to erosion.

Since the first Europeans arrived, 34 exotic plant species have been recorded in the park, representing about 6.4% of the total park flora. Some, such as perennial buffel grass (''[[Cenchrus ciliaris]]''), were introduced to rehabilitate areas damaged by erosion. It is the most threatening weed in the park and has spread to invade water- and nutrient-rich drainage lines. A few others, such as burrgrass, were brought in accidentally, carried on cars and people.

==Climate and five seasons==
The park has a hot desert climate and receives an average rainfall of {{convert|284.6|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} per year.&lt;ref name="BoM-Yulara" /&gt; The average high temperature in summer (December–January) is {{convert|37.8|°C|°F|1|abbr=on}}, and the average low temperature in winter (June–July) is {{convert|4.7|°C|°F|1|abbr=on}}. Temperature extremes in the park have been recorded at {{convert|46|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}} during the summer and {{convert|−5|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}} during winter. [[Ultraviolet|UV]] levels are extreme between October and March, averaging between 11 and 15 on the [[Ultraviolet index|UV index]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bom.gov.au/nt/uv/yulara.shtml Yulara Ultraviolet (UV) Index Forecast Graph].

==Aboriginal myths, legends and traditions==
According to the Aṉangu, traditional landowners of Uluru:&lt;ref name="CWLTH"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.environment.gov.au/parks/uluru/culture-history/culture/creation.html |title=The Creation Period |work=Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5mr7pLgkR?url=http://www.environment.gov.au/parks/uluru/culture-history/culture/creation.html |archivedate=17 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The world was once a featureless place. None of the places we know existed until creator beings, in the forms of people, plants and animals, traveled widely across the land. Then, in a process of creation and destruction, they formed the landscape as we know it today. Aṉangu land is still inhabited by the spirits of dozens of these ancestral creator beings which are referred to as ''Tjukuritja'' or ''Waparitja''.}}

There are a number of differing accounts given, by outsiders, of Aboriginal ancestral stories for the origins of Uluru and its many cracks and fissures. One such account, taken from Robert Layton's (1989) ''Uluru: An Aboriginal history of Ayers Rock'',&lt;ref name="abhistuluru"/&gt; reads as follows:

{{quote|Uluru was built up during the creation period by two boys who played in the mud after rain. When they had finished their game they travelled south to Wiputa ... Fighting together, the two boys made their way to the table topped [[Mount Conner]], on top of which their bodies are preserved as boulders. (Page 5)}}

Two other accounts are given in Norbert Brockman's (1997) ''Encyclopedia of Sacred Places''.&lt;ref name="encycsacred"&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Sacred Places |first=Norbert C |last=Brockman |publisher=ABC-Clio Inc |location=[[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], California |date=June 1997 |pages=292–93 |isbn=0-19-512739-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first tells of serpent beings who waged many wars around Uluru, scarring the rock. The second tells of two tribes of ancestral spirits who were invited to a feast, but were distracted by the beautiful Sleepy Lizard Women and did not show up. In response, the angry hosts sang evil into a mud sculpture that came to life as the dingo. There followed a great battle, which ended in the deaths of the leaders of both tribes. The earth itself rose up in grief at the bloodshed, becoming Uluru.

The Commonwealth Department of Environment's webpage advises:&lt;ref name="CWLTH"/&gt;

{{quote|Many...Tjukurpa such as Kalaya (Emu), Liru (poisonous snake), Lungkata (blue tongue lizard), Luunpa (kingfisher) and Tjintir-tjintirpa ([[willie wagtail]]) travel through [[Uluṟu-Kata Tjuṯa National Park]]. Other Tjukurpa affect only one specific area.}}
{{quote|Kuniya, the woma python, lived in the rocks at Uluru where she fought the Liru, the poisonous snake.}}

It is sometimes reported that those who take rocks from the formation will be cursed and suffer misfortune. There have been many instances where people who removed such rocks attempted to mail them back to various agencies in an attempt to remove the perceived curse.&lt;ref name="rocktheft"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/03/07/1046826515667.html |title=Rock theft brings bad luck |work=The Age |date=7 March 2003 |accessdate=3 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rocktheft2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/strange-but-true/news/article.cfm?c_id=500835&amp;objectid=10509543 |title=Uluru tourists return 'cursed' souvenirs |work=New Zealand Herald |first=Kathy |last=Marks |date=12 May 2008 |accessdate=14 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Uluru petroglyphs IV.jpg|thumb|[[Petroglyph]]s on Uluru]]
[[File:Uluru1 2003-11-21.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Uluru]]

Archaeological findings to the east and west indicate that humans settled in the area more than 10,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="abhistuluru"&gt;{{cite book |title=Uluru: An Aboriginal History of Ayers Rock |first=Robert |last=Layton |edition=2001 revised |publisher=Aboriginal Studies Press |location=Canberra |date=August 2001 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vRBblyNmZxUC |isbn=0-85575-202-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Europeans arrived in the Australian [[Western Desert cultural bloc|Western Desert]] in the 1870s. Uluru and Kata Tjuta were first mapped by Europeans in 1872 during the expeditionary period made possible by the construction of the [[Australian Overland Telegraph Line]]. In separate expeditions, [[Ernest Giles]] and [[William Gosse (explorer)|William Gosse]] were the first European explorers to this area.

While exploring the area in 1872, Giles sighted Kata Tjuta from a location near [[Kings Canyon (Northern Territory)|Kings Canyon]] and called it Mount Olga, while the following year Gosse observed Uluru and named it Ayers Rock, in honour of the [[Chief Secretary of South Australia]], Sir [[Henry Ayers]]. Further explorations followed with the aim of establishing the possibilities of the area for [[pastoralism]]. In the late 19th century, pastoralists attempted to establish themselves in areas adjoining the Southwestern/Petermann Reserve and interaction between Aṉangu and white people became more frequent and more violent. Due to the effects of grazing and drought, bush food stores became depleted. Competition for these resources created conflict between the two groups, resulting in more frequent police patrols. Later, during the depression in the 1930s, Aṉangu became involved in [[dingo]] scalping with 'doggers' who introduced Aṉangu to European foods and ways.

Between 1918 and 1921, large adjoining areas of South Australia, Western Australia, and the [[Northern Territory]] were declared as Aboriginal reserves, sanctuaries for nomadic people who had virtually no contact with European settlers. In 1920, part of Uluṟu–Kata Tjuṯa National Park was declared an Aboriginal Reserve (commonly known as the South-Western or Petermann Reserve) by the Australian government under the Aboriginals Ordinance.

The first tourists arrived in the Uluru area in 1936. Beginning in the 1940s, permanent European settlement of the area for reasons of the Aboriginal welfare policy and to help promote tourism of Uluru. This increased tourism prompted the formation of the first vehicular tracks in 1948 and tour bus services began early in the 1950s. In 1958, the area that would become the Uluṟu–Kata Tjuṯa National Park was excised from the Petermann Reserve; it was placed under the management of the Northern Territory Reserves Board and named the Ayers Rock–Mount Olga National Park. The first [[park ranger|ranger]] was Bill Harney, a well-recognised central Australian figure.&lt;ref name="uktnppm" /&gt; By 1959, the first motel leases had been granted and Eddie Connellan had constructed an airstrip close to the northern side of Uluru.&lt;ref name="engovauhistory"/&gt;

On 26 October 1985, the Australian government returned ownership of Uluru to the local Pitjantjatjara Aborigines, with one of the conditions being that the Aṉangu would lease it back to the National Parks and Wildlife agency for 99 years and that it would be jointly managed. An agreement originally made between the community and Prime Minister [[Bob Hawke]] that the climb to the top by tourists would be stopped was later broken.&lt;ref name="Toyne1984"&gt;{{cite book |title=Growing Up the Country: The Pitjantjatjara Struggle for Their Land |publisher=McPhee Gribble |location=[[Fitzroy, Victoria]] |year=1984 |first1=Phillip |last1=Toyne |first2=Daniel |last2=Vachon |page=137 |isbn=0-14-007641-7 |oclc=12611425}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sites.coloradocollege.edu/indigenoustraditions/sacred-lands/uluru-from-all-angles-the-modern-controversy-of-climbing-the-sacred/ |title=Uluru from All Angles: The Modern Controversy of Climbing the Sacred |work=Indigenous Religious Traditions |publisher=Colorado College |first=Lucy |last=Gamble |accessdate=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Aboriginal community of [[Mutitjulu]], with a population of approximately 300, is located near the eastern end of Uluru.

==Tourism==
[[File:Lasseter Highway1437.jpg|thumb|Driving on [[Lasseter Highway]] from Uluṟu–Kata Tjuṯa National Park, April 2007]]
The development of tourism infrastructure adjacent to the base of Uluru that began in the 1950s soon produced adverse environmental impacts. It was decided in the early 1970s to remove all accommodation-related tourist facilities and re-establish them outside the park. In 1975, a reservation of {{convert|104|km2|sqmi|0}} of land beyond the park's northern boundary, {{convert|15|km|mi|0}} from Uluru, was approved for the development of a tourist facility and an associated [[Ayers Rock Airport|airport]], to be known as [[Yulara, Northern Territory|Yulara]]. The camp ground within the park was closed in 1983 and the motels closed in late 1984, coinciding with the opening of the Yulara resort. In 1992, the majority interest in the Yulara resort held by the Northern Territory Government was sold and the resort was renamed Ayers Rock Resort.

Since the park was listed as a [[World Heritage Site]], annual visitor numbers rose to over 400,000 visitors by the year 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.environment.gov.au/parks/uluru/culture-history/heritage/index.html |title=World Heritage and International Significance |publisher=Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts |accessdate=17 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increased tourism provides regional and national economic benefits. It also presents an ongoing challenge to balance conservation of cultural values and visitor needs.

===Climbing===
[[File:uluruwarning.jpg|thumb|upright|Climbers and a warning sign]]

The local Aṉangu do not climb Uluru because of its great spiritual significance. They request that visitors do not climb the rock, partly due to the path crossing a sacred traditional [[Dreamtime]] [[Songline|track]], and also due to a sense of responsibility for the safety of visitors. The visitors guide says "the climb is not prohibited, but we prefer that, as a guest on Aṉangu land, you will choose to respect our law and culture by not climbing."&lt;ref name="welcomeland" /&gt;

According to a 2010 publication, just over one-third of all visitors to the park climb Uluru; a high percentage of these were children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.environment.gov.au/resource/management-plan-2010-2020-uluru-kata-tjuta-national-park |title=Uluṟu–Kata Tjuṯa National Park – Management Plan 2010–2020 |publisher=Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts |location=Canberra |page=90 |date=2010 |isbn=978-0-9807460-1-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A chain handhold added in 1964 and extended in 1976 makes the hour-long climb easier, but it is still a steep, {{convert|800|m|mi|1|abbr=on}} hike to the top, where it can be quite windy. It is recommended individuals drink plenty of water while climbing, and those who are [[Physical fitness|unfit]], suffer from [[vertigo]] or medical conditions restricting exercise, do not attempt it. Climbing Uluru is generally closed to the public when high winds are present at the top. There have been at least 37 deaths relating to recreational climbing since such incidents began being recorded.&lt;ref name="welcomeland" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title='Please don't climb Uluru': Japanese tourist dies at sacred site |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-07-04/japanese-tourist-dies-climbing-uluru/9937848 |website=[[ABC Online]] |accessdate=28 July 2018 |language=en-AU |date=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; About one-sixth of visitors made the climb between 2011 and 2015.&lt;ref name="bbc20171101"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-41827203 |title=Australia to ban climbing on Uluru from 2019 |work=BBC News |date=1 November 2017 |accessdate=2 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 December 1983, the Prime Minister of Australia, [[Bob Hawke]], promised to hand back the land title to the Aṉangu traditional custodians and caretakers and agreed to the community's 10-point plan which included forbidding the climbing of Uluru.  The government, however, set access to climb Uluru and a 99-year lease, instead of the previously agreed upon 50-year lease, as conditions before the title was officially given back to the Aṉangu on 26 October 1985.&lt;ref name="Toyne1984"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/blogs/on-this-day/2010/10/on-this-day-aboriginal-australians-get-uluru-back |title=On this day: Aboriginal Australians get Uluru back |work=Australian Geographic |first=Julian |last=Swallow |date=26 October 2010 |accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aboriginal traditional owners of Uluṟu–Kata Tjuṯa National Park (Nguraritja) and the Federal Government's [[Director of National Parks]] share decision-making on the management of Uluṟu–Kata Tjuṯa National Park. Under their joint Uluṟu–Kata Tjuṯa National Park Management Plan 2010–20, issued by the Director of National Parks under the ''[[Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999]]'', clause 6.3.3 provides that the Director and the Uluṟu–Kata Tjuṯa Board of Management work towards closure of the climb and, additionally, provides that it will close upon any of three conditions being met: there are "adequate new visitor experiences", less than 20 per cent of visitors make the climb or the "critical factors" in decisions to visit are "cultural and natural experiences".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.environment.gov.au/resource/management-plan-2010-2020-uluru-kata-tjuta-national-park |title=Uluṟu–Kata Tjuṯa National Park – Management Plan 2010–2020 |publisher=Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts |location=Canberra |page=102 |date=2010 |isbn=978-0-9807460-1-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite cogent evidence the second condition was met by July 2013, the climb remained open.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/09/people-still-climbing-uluru-closure |title=People still climbing Uluru despite closure condition being met |work=The Guardian |first=Oliver |last=Laughland |date=8 July 2013 |access-date=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several controversial incidents on top of Uluru in 2010, including a [[striptease]], golfing and nudity, led to renewed calls for banning the climb.&lt;ref name="ntn100630"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ntnews.com.au/article/2010/06/30/159961_ntnews.html |title=Rock rage rolls on |work=Northern Territory News |date=30 June 2010 |accessdate=28 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mail100628"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1290180/French-exotic-dancer-Miss-Alizee-Sery-angers-Aboriginals-stripping-Ayers-Rock.html |title=Stripper sparks fury among Aboriginals after YouTube exotic dance on sacred Ayers Rock |work=Daily Mail |first=Richard |last=Shears |date=28 June 2010 |accessdate=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 November 2017, the Uluṟu–Kata Tjuṯa National Park board voted unanimously to prohibit climbing Uluru, with the ban to take effect in October 2019.&lt;ref name="climbban"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-11-01/uluru-climbs-banned-after-unanimous-board-decision/9103512 |title=Uluru climbs banned from October 2019 after unanimous board decision to 'close the playground' |work=ABC News |first1=Georgia |last1=Hitch |first2=Nick |last2=Hose |date=1 November 2017 |accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Photography===
The Aṉangu also request that visitors do not photograph certain sections of Uluru, for reasons related to traditional ''Tjukurpa'' beliefs. These areas are the sites of gender-linked rituals and are forbidden ground for Aṉangu of the opposite sex to those participating in the rituals in question. The photographic restriction is intended to prevent Aṉangu from inadvertently violating this taboo by encountering photographs of the forbidden sites in the outside world.&lt;ref name="tjukurpa"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.environment.gov.au/parks/uluru/culture-history/culture/tjukurpa.html |title=Uluṟu–Kata Tjuṯa National Park – Tjukurpa |work=Australian Department of the Environment and Water Resources |accessdate=3 April 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070307175107/http://www.environment.gov.au/parks/uluru/tjukurpa/ |archivedate=7 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''von Kármán–Gabrielli diagram''' (also '''Gabrielli–von Kármán diagram''', '''GvK diagram''') is a diagram which compares the efficiency of transportation methods by plotting specific [[tractive force]], or specific resistance (''&amp;epsilon;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;P/mgv&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;E/mgd'') against velocity (''v'').  It was first used by [[Theodore von Kármán]] and [[Giuseppe Gabrielli]] in their 1950 paper on this subject.&lt;ref&gt;"What price speed? Specific power required for propulsion of vehicles", G. Gabrielli and Th. von Kármán, ''Mechanical Engineering'' '''72''' (1950), #10, pp. 775-781.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ingenia.org.uk/ingenia/articles.aspx?Index=305 "What Price Speed - Revisited"], The Railway Research Group, Imperial College, ''Ingenia'' '''22''' (March 2005). [http://www.ingenia.org.uk/ingenia/issues/issue22/Imperial.pdf PDF with the graphs]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;pp. 385-386, ''Springer Handbook of Robotics'', eds.

The basic idea is that formally, 1 kWh/ 100 km is equivalent to a [[force]] (see [[Work (physics)#Work and energy]]), a resistance force amounting to [[Newton (unit)|36 N]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1810/217849/327.370.pdf?sequence=17 Useful data - Cambridge repository] website repository.cam.ac.uk; see page 328.&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:Lev-Beh-Ziz.jpg|thumb|300px|Clockwise from left: [[Behemoth]] (on earth), Ziz (in sky), and [[Leviathan]] (under sea).]]
The '''Ziz''' ([[Hebrew]]: {{hebrew|זיז}}) is a giant [[griffin]]-like [[bird]] in [[Jewish mythology]], said to be large enough to be able to block out the sun with its wingspan.

==Description==
It is considered a giant animal/monster corresponding to [[archetype|archetypal]] creatures. Rabbis have said that the Ziz is comparable to the Persian [[Simurgh]], while modern scholars compare the Ziz to the Sumerian [[Anzû (mythology)|Anzû]] and the Ancient Greek [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]].&lt;ref name=Wazana&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wazana|first=Nili|title=Anzu and Ziz: Great Mythical Birds in Ancient Near Eastern, Biblical, and Rabbinic Traditions|journal=[[Journal of the Ancient Near Eastern Society]]|year=2008|volume=31|pages=111–135|url=http://www.jtsa.edu/Documents/pagedocs/JANES/2009/Wazana_JANES31.pdf|accessdate=26 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is only passing mention of the Ziz in the Bible, found in Psalms 50:11 "I know all the birds of the mountains and ''Zīz śāday'' is mine" and Psalms 80:13-14 "The boar from the forest ravages it, and ''Zīz śāday'' {{hebrew|וְזִיז שָׂדַי}} feeds on it", and these are often lost in translation from the Hebrew.&lt;ref name=Wazana /&gt; The Jewish [[aggadah|aggadot]] say of the Ziz:
{{quote|As [[Leviathan]] is the king of fishes, so the Ziz is appointed to rule over the birds. His name comes from the variety of tastes his flesh has; it tastes like this, ''zeh'', and like that, ''zeh''. The Ziz is as monstrous of size as Leviathan himself. His ankles rest on the earth, and his head reaches to the very sky.

It once happened that travelers on a vessel noticed a bird. As he stood in the water, it merely covered his feet, and his head knocked against the sky. The onlookers thought the water could not have any depth at that point, and they prepared to take a bath there. A heavenly voice warned them: "Alight not here! Once a carpenter's axe slipped from his hand at this spot, and it took it seven years to touch bottom." The bird the travelers saw was none other than the Ziz. His wings are so huge that unfurled they darken the sun. They protect the earth against the storms of the south; without their aid the earth would not be able to resist the winds blowing thence. Once an egg of the Ziz fell to the ground and broke. The fluid from it flooded sixty cities, and the shock crushed three hundred cedars. Fortunately such accidents do not occur frequently. As a rule the bird lets her eggs slide gently into her nest. This one mishap was because the egg was rotten, and the bird cast it away carelessly.

The Ziz has another name, ''Renanin'', because he is the celestial singer. On account of his relation to the heavenly regions he is also called ''Sekwi'', the seer, and, besides, he is called "son of the nest," because his fledgling birds break away from the shell without being hatched by the mother bird; they spring directly from the nest, as it were. Like Leviathan, so Ziz is a delicacy to be served to the pious at the end of time, to compensate them for the privations which abstaining from the unclean fowls imposed upon them. [...] The creation of the fifth day, the animal world, rules over the celestial spheres. Witness the Ziz, which can darken the sun with its pinions.&lt;ref name="Barnstone2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnstone|first=Willis|authorlink=Willis Barnstone|title=The Other Bible|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J9aKaGTOQDAC&amp;pg=PA23|year=2005|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-081598-1|page=23-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GinzbergCohen1913"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ginzberg|first1=Louis|authorlink1=Louis Ginzberg|last2=Cohen|first2=Boaz|authorlink2=Boaz Cohen|title=Bible times and characters from the creation to Jacob|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZLVbAAAAMAAJ|year=1913|publisher=Jewish Publication Society of America}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Non-Jews also knew of the Ziz. [[Johannes Buxtorf]]'s 1603 ''Synagoga Judaica'' discusses the Ziz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buxtorf|first=Johannes|title=Synagoga Judaica|year=1603|publisher=Sebastianus Henricpetrus|location=Basel|pages=36, 335, 649–654|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l5oPAAAAQAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His text is echoed in English by Samuel Purchas in 1613:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Purchas|first=Samuel|title=Purchas, His Pilgrimage; or, Relations of the World and the Religions Observed in All Ages|year=1614|publisher=William Stansby|location=London|pages=222–223|url=https://archive.org/details/purchashispilgri00purc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::''[[Elia Levita|Elias Leuita]]'' reporteth of a huge huge bird, also called ''Bariuchne'', to be rosted at this feast; of which the Talmud saith, that an egge sometime falling out of her nest, did ouerthrow and breake downe three hundred tall Cedars; with which fall the egge being broken, ouerflowed and carried away sixtie Villages... But to take view of other strange creatures, make roome, I pray, for another Rabbi with his Bird; and a great deale of roome you will say is requisite: Rabbi ''Kimchi'' on the 50. Psalme auerreth out of Rabbi ''Iehudah'', that ''Ziz'' is a bird so great, that with spreading abroad his wings, he hideth the Sunne, and darkeneth all the world. And (to leape back into the Talmud) a certaine Rabbi sayling on the Sea, saw a bird in the middle of the Sea, so high, that the water reached but to her knees; whereupon he wished his companions there to wash, because it was so shallow; ''Doe it not'' (saith a voyce from heauen) for it is seuen yeares space since a Hatchet, by chance falling out of a mans hand in this place, and alwayes descending, is not yet come at the bottome.

[[Humphrey Prideaux]] in 1698 describes the Ziz as being like a giant celestial rooster:
{{quote|For in the Tract ''Bava Bathra'' of the ''Babylonish Talmud'', we have a Story of such a ''prodigious Bird'', called ''Ziz'', which standing with his Feet upon the ''Earth'', reacheth up unto the ''Heavens'' with his head, and with the spreading of his Wings darkneth the whole Orb of the ''Sun'', and causeth a total ''Eclipse'' thereof. This ''Bird'' the ''Chaldee Paraphrast'' on the ''Psalms'' says, is a ''Cock'', which he describes of the same bigness, and tells us that he crows before the ''Lord''. And the ''Chaldee Paraphrast'' on ''Job'' also tells us of him, and of his crowing every morning before ''the Lord'', and that ''God'' giveth him Wisdom for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Prideaux|first=Humphrey|title=The True Nature of Imposture Fully Displayd in the Life of Mahomet|year=1698|publisher=William Rogers|location=London|pages=60|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QhdSAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA60&amp;q=ziz}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''İğneada Floodplain Forests National Park''' ({{lang-tr|İğneada Longoz Ormanları Milli Parkı}}), established on November 13, 2007, is a [[national park]] located within [[Kırklareli Province]] in [[Marmara Region]] of Turkey.&lt;ref name="mp"/&gt;

The national park covers an area of {{convert|3155|ha|acre|abbr=on}} and is located  at [[İğneada]] town on the Turkish-Bulgarian border at {{convert|25|km|mi|abbr=on}} far from [[Demirköy, Kırklareli|Demirköy]] district of Kırklareli Province.&lt;ref name="mp"/&gt;

Streams running down from the [[Strandzha]] mountain range towards [[Black Sea]] formed [[alluvium]] on the shore, where [[floodplain]] ({{lang-tr|longoz}}) occurred due to seasonal floodings.

The [[protected area]] is administered by the  Directorate-General of Nature Protection and National Parks ({{lang-tr|Doğa Koruma ve Milli Parklar Genel Müdürlüğü}}) of the [[Ministry of Environment and Forest (Turkey)|Ministry of Environment and Forest]].&lt;ref name="mp"/&gt;

The national park is a rare [[ecosystem]], which consists of [[marsh]], [[swamp]], lakes and coastal sand [[dune]]s. The Strandzha mountain range is situated in the south and west. There are five lakes with [[aquatic plant]]. Lake Erikli covering   {{convert|43|ha|acre|abbr=on}} is a [[lagoon]], which gets separated from the sea in the summer months as a result of drought. Lake Mert of {{convert|266|ha|acre|abbr=on}} area is formed by Çavuşdere creek at its mouth. Lake Saka is a small lake of {{convert|5|ha|acre|abbr=on}} situated in the south of the national park between the floodplain and the dunes. The two other lakes are Lake Hamam of size {{convert|19|ha|acre|abbr=on}} and Lake Pedina of {{convert|10|ha|acre|abbr=on}}. The sand dunes are situated on both sides of İğneada town. The dunes in the north stretch out from east of Lake Erikli to İğneada. The southern dunes run from the Lake Mert's sea connection to the south of Lake Saka, reaching a width of {{convert|50|-|60|m|ft|abbr=on}} at some places.&lt;ref name="eos"/&gt;

==Ecosystem==

===Flora===
[[File:İğneadaFloodplainForestsNP (10).JPG|thumb|A view from the national park. Trees on the leftside of the trail and typical [[typha]] on the rightside.]]
[[File:İğneadaFloodplainForestsNP (11).JPG|thumb|Sandy lakeshore, typha and wood in the background in the national park.]]
The {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} long dunes with the plant species, unique to the southwestern Black Sea region, are of great importance. The flora of dunes in the belt between the lakes, marsh and the sea are under protection by international agreement. The national park is also habitat for swamp and non-evergreen mixed wood. [[Vine]] species are the most distinct plants of the forest. Sprecies of [[European ash]] (''Fraxinus excelsior''), [[oak]] (''Quercus''), [[alder]] (''(Alnus''), [[beech]] (''Fagaceae'') and [[maple]] (''Aceraceae'') are trees found in the national park forest.&lt;ref name="eos"/&gt;

===Fauna===
