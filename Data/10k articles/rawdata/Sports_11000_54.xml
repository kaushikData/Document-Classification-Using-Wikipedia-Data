The '''100 Marathon Club''' or British 100 Marathon Club is a club for [[marathon]] and [[Ultra-marathon|ultra marathon]] runners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.runnersworld.co.uk/event-editorial/the-100-marathon-club/4291.html | title=Runner’s World UK article on 100 Marathon Club | publisher=Runner’s World UK | accessdate=19 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a membership that is primarily based in the [[United Kingdom|UK]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.100marathonclub.org.uk/rec-alpha.html | title=100 Marathon Club list of current members | publisher=100 Marathon Club | accessdate=19 August 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110507132057/http://www.100marathonclub.org.uk/rec-alpha.html | archive-date=2011-05-07 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but with additional members from outside Britain. It is affiliated to [[UK Athletics]].

==Club membership==
The club has two types of membership; full and associate. Full membership is available to anyone who has run at least 100 marathons or ultra marathons (ultras), whereas for associate membership, a runner only needs to have run at least 50 marathons or ultras. Associate members are also known as [[Wannabe (disambiguation)|Wannabe]]s and are not permitted to wear the official club kit. On reaching their 100th marathon though, associate members in becoming full members, are also able to obtain a commemorative medal from the club.

===Club activities===
The club has an annual Challenge Competition that is centred on members taking part in designated distance races within the UK and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].

The club membership includes many prolific marathon runners who have run many more than 100 marathons, including Brian Mills who completed his 1000th marathon in 2014, Collette O’Hagan a 67-year-old, who became the first women in Ireland to run 400 marathons, in June 2016&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/sport/collette-o-hagan-far-from-running-on-empty-1.2844472] "Far From Running on Empty".

The club also has a group on [[Facebook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hs.facebook.com/group.php?gid=115982735082448 | title=100 Marathon Club on Facebook | publisher=Facebook | accessdate=19 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Club kit===
The kit colour is predominantly blue with yellow and includes the club logo on the front in yellow, green and red, and also on the back in just yellow.

{{Infobox cricket tournament
| previous_year = 1749
| previous_tournament = 1749 English cricket season
| next_year = 1751
| next_tournament = 1751 English cricket season
}}
1750 was the 54th English [[cricket]] season since the earliest known [[First-class cricket#Important matches classification|important match]] was played. Details have survived of six [[First-class cricket#Important matches classification|important eleven-a-side]] and four [[single wicket cricket|single wicket matches]]. [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent]] and [[Surrey county cricket teams|Surrey]] played three inter-county matches.

In ''At the Sign of the Wicket'', [[F. S. Ashley-Cooper]] gives the opinion that the [[Hambledon Club]] was founded in or about 1750, but there is no evidence to support this view and the club's origin is unknown. As the team was playing top-class cricket in the [[1756 English cricket season|1756 season]] (i.e., its earliest recorded matches), it seems likely that a local club of some kind was founded much earlier than 1750 as it must have risen to a position of prominence in Hampshire before being able to take on the likes of [[Dartford Cricket Club|Dartford]] from 1756. It is possible, as with many later county clubs, that a parish club was in existence for a long time and was then subject to substantial reorganisation after its team became famous. This might explain the many "origins" of the Hambledon Club up to about the [[1767 English cricket season|1767 season]].

== Important matches ==
The following matches are classified as [[First-class cricket#Important matches classification|important]]:&lt;ref name="status" group="note"&gt;First-class cricket was officially defined in May 1894 by a meeting at [[Lord's]] of [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC) and the [[county cricket|county clubs]] which were then competing in the [[County Championship]]. The ruling was effective from the beginning of the 1895 season. Pre-1895 matches of the same standard have no official definition of status because the ruling is not retrospective and the [[First-class cricket#Important matches classification|important matches]] designation, as applied to a given match, is based on the views of one or more substantial historical sources. For further information, see [[First-class cricket]], [[Forms of cricket]] and [[History of cricket]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Dartford scored 46 and 34; Addington replied with 39 and 35. [[William Hodsoll]] and the two Bryants all played for Dartford as given men. According to the ''London Evening Post'' on Thursday, 19 July, Dartford lost five second innings wickets in five successive deliveries by a mixture of caught and bowled, but they still made enough to win.

Surrey scored 55 and 42; Kent replied with 63 and 35-9 to win a very tight contest. A deciding match and again it was won by the team batting second. Five runs were still needed when the penultimate wicket fell. The teams were unchanged from the two previous matches but again there are no individual scores. The London Club ruled beforehand that players must reside in the county they play for. The Frames still lived at [[Warlingham]] in 1750, though [[John Frame (cricketer)|John Frame]] was latterly associated with [[Dartford Cricket Club|Dartford]].

==Single wicket==
''Thursday, 26 July''. [[Richmond Cricket Club (18th century)|Five of Richmond]] played [[London Cricket Club|Five of London]] for a guinea a man on the [[Artillery Ground]]. No details are known.&lt;ref name=ASW68/&gt;

''Monday, 10 September''. The first of three "fives" between [[Stephen Dingate's XI cricket team|Stephen Dingate's Five]] and [[Tom Faulkner's XI cricket team|Tom Faulkner's Five]] at the [[Artillery Ground]]. Faulkner's team won this one, which was played for fifty guineas. Teams were: [[Stephen Dingate]], [[James Bryant (Kent cricketer)|James Bryant]], [[John Bryant (cricketer)|John Bryant]], [[John Bell (Kent cricketer)|John Bell]] and [[Thomas Bell (cricketer)|Thomas Bell]] versus [[Tom Faulkner]], [[Joe Harris (cricketer)|Joseph Harris]], [[John Harris (Surrey cricketer)|John Harris]], [[Durling (Surrey cricketer)|Durling]] and [[Perry (Surrey cricketer)|Perry]].&lt;ref name=ASW68/&gt;

''Friday, 14 September''. The second match ended in a tie, both sides totalling nine. As single-wicket rules applied, all batsmen were out. It is known they were all bowled (but not who by) except for Dingate who was caught in the 2nd innings, Thomas Bell who was run out in the 2nd innings and Joe Harris who was caught in the 2nd innings (apparently while trying to hit the winning run).&lt;ref name=ASW68/&gt;

''Monday, 17 September''. The third and deciding game of "fives" was won by Tom Faulkner’s side by an innings and one run. Dingate’s team scored 10 and 18 but Faulkner’s scored 29. The individual figures in the recorded score of Dingate’s second innings add up to 20 but 18 was definitely the correct total so one or more of the individual scores was wrong.&lt;ref name=ASW68/&gt;

''Monday, 24 September''. [[London Cricket Club|Five of London]] v [[Addington Cricket Club|Five of Addington]]. Venue unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Maun, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other events==
''c.Monday, 27 April''. Death, at [[Deptford]], of [[Robert Colchin]] (1713–1750), ''aka'' "Long Robin", apparently of [[smallpox]].&lt;ref&gt;Maun, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Wednesday, 8 August''. Death, at [[Godalming]], of [[Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond]] (1701–1750), who was arguably the greatest of the game’s early [[patron (cricket)|patrons]], particularly of the [[Slindon Cricket Club]] and of [[Sussex county cricket teams|Sussex]] cricket in general. His death was followed by an immediate slump in Sussex cricket and it is not until 1766 that a recovery can be discerned.&lt;ref&gt;Maun, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bellewstown''' ({{Irish place name|Baile an Bheileogaigh}}) is a village located 8 km south of [[Drogheda]], on the Hill of Crockafotha in [[County Meath]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. It was named after Darren Bellew, who led the townspeople to a victory over the infamous [[O'Shúilleabháin clan]] in 1407.

==Bellewstown Races==
In 1780, George Tandy, a former mayor of [[Drogheda]] and brother of [[James Napper Tandy]], persuaded [[King George III]] to sponsor a race at Bellewstown. The race was called His Majesty's Plate and was valued at £100.

The tradition of summer horse racing at Bellewstown dates back centuries. The first record of racing here appears in the August edition of the ''[[Dublin Gazette]]'' and the ''Weekly Courier'' in 1726. There was originally a cricket ground in the middle of the race track. Racing continues to occur on an annual basis, taking place during the course of the summer. There are currently two meetings a year, comprising three days in July and two days in August. The track is a one mile and one furlong left-handed course, featuring both flat and hurdle racing.

==Bellewstown village==
Amenities in Bellewstown include a primary school, [[Catholic church]], pub, GAA grounds, racecourse, and golf course.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2084">The '''Cambodian national cricket team''' is a cricket team that represents the nation of [[Cambodia]] in international cricket competitions and is administered by the [[Cricket Association of Cambodia]].

Cambodia applied for [[Asian Cricket Council]] membership, which was granted in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asiancricket.org/index.php/news/july-2012/2462 NEW ACC MEMBERS: CAMBODIA, CHINESE TAIPEI AND TAJIKISTAN] Asian Cricket Council. Retrieved 29 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The Cricket Association also plans to apply for membership of the National Olympic Committee.

Cricket in the former French colony of Cambodia is still a mainly expatriate game at senior level, and a growing interest with the younger set of boys that play. Additionally, a structured cricket league is being planned in the country with the help of the [[Thailand Cricket League]] and that the [[Olympic Stadium (Phnom Penh)|National Stadium, Phnom Penh]] and Army Stadium will be available. Cambodia is planned to host the [[2023 Southeast Asian Games]] and a cricket ground could be funded and built.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asiancricket.org/index.php/news/october-2012/2509 CAMBODIA COMING ON] Asian Cricket Council.

The '''Canberra Stadium''', known also as Bruce Stadium (For sponsorship reasons it is officially known as '''GIO Stadium Canberra''', or simply '''GIO Stadium''') is a facility primarily used for [[rugby league]], [[soccer]] and [[rugby union]] games, located adjacent to the [[Australian Institute of Sport]] in [[Canberra]], the capital of [[Australia]]. The GIO Stadium Canberra is the largest sports venue by capacity in Canberra.

== History ==
Designed by architect [[Philip Cox]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Bleby, Michael |url=http://www.afr.com/leadership/entrepreneur/profiles/architect-philip-cox-delivers-upfront-on-architectures-deficiencies-20160810-gqpgrv |title=Architect Philip Cox delivers upfront on architecture's deficiencies |work=[[Financial Review]] |location=Australia |date=20 August 2016 |access-date=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and constructed in 1977 for the [[Pacific Conference Games]], it also was the venue for the 4th [[International Association of Athletics Federations|IAAF]] [[World Cup in Athletics]]. At the latter meet, the still-current world record for the women's 400m was recorded by East German [[Marita Koch]], and a world record for the women's 4 × 100 m was set by East Germany and stood until the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 London Olympic Games]].

In the late 1980s the running track was removed and re-located to the warm up stadium at the AIS site. In the [[1990 NSWRL season]], the [[1989 NSWRL season|reigning NSWRL premiers]] the [[Canberra Raiders]] moved to Bruce Stadium from [[Seiffert Oval]] in [[Queanbeyan, New South Wales|Queanbeyan]], their home ground since entering the [[NSWRL]] in [[1982 NSWRFL season|1982]]. The Raiders won their second straight premiership in 1990.

The removal of the track meant that [[Australian rules football]], more specifically the [[Australian Football League]] (AFL), could now be played at the ground. In 1995, an AFL match for premiership points was contested between the [[West Coast Eagles]] and [[Fitzroy Football Club|Fitzroy]]. There were also a number of pre-season AFL games played at the venue, mostly featuring the [[Sydney Swans]].

Also around this time, as an experiment, a cricket pitch was placed in the centre of the ground, and a day/night 1 day cricket match was played between 2 local teams before a small crowd. Regular cricket matches on the ground did not eventuate.

[[File:A league pre season sydney vs newcastle.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Sydney FC]] playing [[Newcastle United Jets|Newcastle]] at Canberra Stadium in 2006]]
Further renovations occurred in 1997 in preparation for staging soccer matches as part of the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] in Sydney, which also in turn shrank the size of the playing field preventing any future Australian rules football games being played on the field. The final cost of the renovations was more than seven times what was originally anticipated by the territory government of the time, and the subsequent controversy ended the career of then Chief Minister [[Kate Carnell]]. During the lead-up, on 28 May 2000, unseasonal snow fell during a match between the Raiders and the Wests Tigers, the only such event in [[National Rugby League]] history, with the snow causing frost damage to the turf intended for the [[Football at the Summer Olympics|Olympic football]] tournament.

Olympic soccer in 2000 has initiated a stadium facelift converting the playing surface from oval to rectangular and bringing the crowd closer to the action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2000/2000v1.pdf 2000 Summer Olympics official report.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20001109071400/http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2000/2000v1.pdf |date=9 November 2000 }} Volume 1. p. 392.&lt;/ref&gt; The only downside to this revamp is the stadium can no longer host AFL games. It is now an all-seater rectangular stadium with two main grandstands on either side of the playing field. As a result, all top-class cricket and Australian Rules football games in Canberra are now staged at the 15,000 capacity [[Manuka Oval]].

A [[2008 Rugby League World Cup Group B]] game between [[Scotland national rugby league team|Scotland]] and [[France national rugby league team|France]] was played at Canberra Stadium, the first ever rugby league test played at the venue. France defeated Scotland 36-16.

In 2009 there was an [[A-League]] [[Canberra A-League Bid|bid]] from Canberra that, if successful would have seen a team play at the stadium starting with the 2010–11 season. However, the league chose to award second teams to [[Sydney Rovers FC]] (which dissolved due to financial issues) and [[Melbourne Heart FC]].

==Ownership==
The stadium is currently owned by the [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]] through the [[Australian Sports Commission]] and leased to the [[Australian Capital Territory|Australian Capital Territory Government]]. While the current lease is due to expire in 2010, the ACT Government is seeking ownership of the stadium through a land transfer with the Australian Government.

==Seating and capacity==
Capacity is a nominal all-seated 25,011, the largest crowd being 28,753 for the 2004 Super 12 Final. The main grandstand is named after Canberra Raiders and [[Australia national rugby league team|Australian]] rugby league player [[Mal Meninga]], and a statue of another Raiders and Australian league representative [[Laurie Daley]] adorns the main grandstand entrance.

[[File:Gregan Larkham stand.JPG|thumb|220px|alt=Picture of the Gregan Larkham Grandstand|Unveiling of the Gregan-Larkham stand at Canberra Stadium on 28 April 2007.]]
The eastern grandstand was named the Gregan/Larkham Grandstand on 28 April 2007, after [[Brumbies]] and [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]] rugby union greats [[George Gregan]] and [[Stephen Larkham]]. Both ended their international careers after the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]] as the two most-capped players in Wallabies history (at that time), with Gregan at [[List of rugby union Test caps leaders|a world-record]] 139 and Larkham at 102.

== Possible replacement ==
Whilst the stadium suits the needs of its two current primary tenants, as of 2017 it is the smallest Super Rugby stadium and only a medium-sized NRL venue. The stadium itself is approaching 35 years old, and despite modernizations over the years is lacking in certain amenities for fans – especially covered seating.

Additionally, Australia had [[Australia 2022 FIFA World Cup bid|bid]] for the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]] and Canberra Stadium does not meet the necessary criterion to host matches. As such, the ACT Government launched a study examining the upgrading or replacing of Canberra Stadium, with options ranging from increasing capacity and enclosing the current facility, to completely re-configuring the current stadium to an oval for cricket and Australian rules football and building a state of the art rectangular facility next door.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.canberrastadium.com.au/about/masterplan.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Citing costs of building multiple facilities as an issue, ACT Sports Minister [[Andrew Barr]] indicated his preference would be a 'super stadium' built with World Cup standard facilities and capacity, able to be reduced to approximately 30,000 seats after the event. Such a facility would have to incorporate [[movable seating]] in order to accommodate all of the major Australian sporting codes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/news/local/sport/general/barr-prefers-one-super-stadium/1824401.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100509204824/http://www.canberratimes.com.au/news/local/sport/general/barr-prefers-one-super-stadium/1824401.aspx |archivedate=9 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official bid for the 2022 World Cup indicated that the 'super stadium' plan was unlikely and the original plan of a new rectangular stadium built next door to the current stadium, with the existing facility re-configured for oval field sports, was considered to be the likely outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.australiabid.com.au/australias-bid_stadiums_canberra-stadium.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20100706013507/http://www.australiabid.com.au/australias-bid_stadiums_canberra-stadium.aspx |archivedate=6 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the failed world cup bid a new rectangular covered stadium was proposed for Canberra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/city-promised-new-stadium-with-roof-by-2020-20120302-1u8si.html|title=City promised new stadium with roof by 2020|first=Chris|last=Dutton|work=canberratimes.com.au|accessdate=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 the ACT government announced  plans to build a 30,000 covered (with a roof similar to [[Forsyth Barr Stadium]]) rectangular stadium in the city on the shores of Lake Burley Griffin. It would be part of a 15-year significant redevelopment of the foreshore which extends the city to the Eastern Basin. Along with the stadium, as part of the redevelopment there would be apartments, a convention centre and an urban beach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/stadium-urban-beach-convention-centre-on-cards-for-canberra-cbd-20130326-2gqua.html|title=Stadium, urban beach, convention centre on cards for Canberra CBD|first=Larissa Nicholson and Stephanie|last=Anderson|work=canberratimes.com.au|accessdate=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plans to build a new stadium have, however, been put on hold indefinitely due to the need for funds to compensate local residents over an asbestos home insulation debacle.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/rugby-union/union-news/mr-fluffy-cleanup-and-delayed-new-stadium-in-canberra-could-affect-chances-of-hosting-wallabies-tests-20140916-10ho08.html|title=Mr Fluffy clean-up and delayed new stadium in Canberra could affect chances of hosting Wallabies Tests|first=Chris|last=Dutton|work=smh.com.au|accessdate=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plans to construct the new stadium have since been pushed back by a decade.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

[[File:Schachboxen1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|A chess boxing match in Berlin, 2008]]
'''Chess boxing,''' or '''chessboxing,''' is a hybrid that combines two traditional pastimes: [[chess]], a cerebral board game, and [[boxing]], a physical sport. The competitors fight in alternating rounds of chess and boxing. Chessboxing was invented by Dutch performance artist [[Iepe Rubingh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/espn/eticket/story?page=chessboxing|title=ESPN.com - E-Ticket: By Hook Or By Rook|work=go.com|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2005/nov/09/boxing.chess|title=Wanna piece of this?|author=Stephen Moss|work=the Guardian|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; What was initially only thought to be an art performance quickly turned into a fully developed competitive sport.&lt;ref&gt;Justus Bender: [http://www.zeit.de/2005/39/Sport_2fSchachboxen_39 Königsdisziplin], In: ''Die Zeit''. Nr. 39, 22. September 2005, ISSN 0044-2070&lt;/ref&gt; Chessboxing is particularly popular in Germany, the United Kingdom, India, and Russia.

== History ==
Rubingh’s idea to create a new sport fusing the two disciplines, [[chess]] and [[boxing]], originates from the 1992 comic ''[[Froid Équateur]]''—written by French comic book artist [[Enki Bilal]] (born Enes Bilalović)—that portrays a chessboxing world championship. In the comic book version, however, the opponents fight an entire boxing match before they face each other in a game of [[chess]]. Finding this to be impractical, Rubingh developed the idea further until it turned into the competitive sport that chessboxing is today with alternating rounds of chess and boxing and a detailed set of rules and regulations.&lt;ref&gt;Ada Calhoun: [http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1821639,00.html Chess-Boxing Hits It Big], ''Time'', 2008-07-13&lt;/ref&gt; An earlier version of combining chess and boxing was said to have taken place in a boxing club outside London in the late 1970s. The Robinson brothers were in the habit of playing a round of chess against one another after a training session at their boxing club. However, no direct correlation can be made between the Robinson brothers’ chess playing and chessboxing.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Chandler: [http://www.thisislocallondon.co.uk/news/9933055.Chessboxing___the_bizarre_craze_that_started_in_a_Kidbrooke_youth_club/  Robinson Brothers]&lt;/ref&gt; The same goes for the Kung-Fu movie ''[[Mystery of Chessboxing]]'' (1979) as well as the Wu-Tang Clan's song [[Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)|"Da Mystery of Chessboxin'"]] (1993).

=== The early years (2003)===
The first chessboxing competition took place in Berlin in 2003. That same year, the first world championship fight was held in Amsterdam in cooperation with the Dutch Boxing Association as well as the [[Dutch Chess Federation]] and under the auspices of the [[World Chess Boxing Organisation]] (WCBO) that was founded in Berlin shortly before. Dutch middleweight fighters Iepe Rubingh and Jean Louis Veenstra faced each other in the ring. After his opponent exceeded the chess time limit, Rubingh won the fight in the 11th round going down in the history books as the first ever World Chess Boxing Champion. The same goes for the [http://www.chessboxingberlin.de/ Chess Boxing Club Berlin], created in the following year (2004), that is the first of its kind making Berlin the birthplace of chessboxing.&lt;ref&gt;WCBO: [https://www.berlin.de/rbmskzl/_assets/internationales/rueckblick/pdf-dateien/schachboxen.pdf?timestamp=1371120888 Pressemitteilung – Battle of the Cities]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2005–2008: the first champions ===
[[File:Schachboxen2.jpg|thumb|right|A picture of a chess round in a chess boxing match in 2008.]]
Two years after the first world championship, the first European Chess Boxing Championship took place in Berlin on October 1, 2005. Present day chessboxing commentator Andreas Dilschneider was defeated by Tihomir Atanassov Dovramadjiev when he resigned in the 7th round (chess), crowning the latter by being the first European Chess Boxing Champion.&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Dilschneider: [http://magazin.spiegel.de/EpubDelivery/spiegel/pdf/42736496 "Was war da los Herr Dilschneider?"], In: Der Spiegel, 42/2005&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, more than 800 spectators filled the Gloria Theatre in Cologne for the world championship qualification fight between Zoran Mijatovic and Frank Stoldt. The 36-year-old Frank Stoldt, who was a former UN-Peacekeeper in Kosovo and Afghanistan, won when his opponent resigned in chess in the 7th round. After qualifying himself to fight for the title in 2006, Frank Stoldt went up against the American David Depto in November 2007 in Berlin to fight for the first world championship title in the light heavyweight division. More than 800 tickets were sold for the event at the Tape Club in Berlin, making it the biggest chessboxing title fight to that date. Frank Stoldt defeated Depto in the 7th round, and thereby cemented Berlin’s status as the leading city in the chessboxing world becoming the first German world champion.&lt;ref&gt;Berliner Morgenpost: [http://www.morgenpost.de/berlin-aktuell/ich-bin-ein-berliner/article106615642/Frank-Stoldt-Weltmeister-im-Schachboxen.html Frank Stoldt – Weltmeister im Schachboxen]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2008–2011: the chessboxing family grows ===
Chessboxing first received credit from the international Chess Federation [[FIDE]], in April 2008; its president, [[Kirsan Ilyumzhinov]], took part in a chessboxing demo fight in Elista.&lt;ref&gt;FIDE: [http://www.fide.com/component/content/article/2-articles/1327-fide-videos Kirsan as a Chessboxer]&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the chessboxing community began to grow globally at an even faster rate. In 2008, chessboxing clubs were founded in London and Krasnoyarsk. Created in 2009, the Los Angeles Chessboxing Club was the first of its kind in the United States and was directly followed by the New York Chessboxing Club in 2010. The Boxwerk in Munich also opened in 2010 and offers chessboxing training. In addition to the WCBO’s initially European and then later world championships taking place worldwide, the scene at the London Chessboxing Club grew where chessboxing events take place on a regular basis. In 2011, the first international club matchup took place with Berlin and London in the ring—London came out the winner with 2:1 won bouts.&lt;ref&gt;Arno Nickel: [http://de.chessbase.com/post/schachboxen-berlin-london-1-2 London schlägt Berlin]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2011–2014: chess boxing turns professional and goes worldwide ===
In 2011, the WCBO and with it the global chessboxing community made the biggest leap forward in its development to date with the foundation of the Chessboxing Organisation of India and its expansion in Asia, including also Chessboxing China and the Chessboxing Organisation of Iran which were founded in 2012. Furthermore, the third chessboxing organisation in the United States, USA Chessboxing, was founded in 2011 and the European movement was being reinforced by the foundation of the Italian Chessboxing Federation in 2012. What's more, the professionalisation of chessboxing started to take shape in the second decade of the 21st century. In addition to the WCBO that became a registered association under German law in 2014, the Chess Boxing Global Marketing CBGM GmbH—called Chess Boxing Global, CBG—was founded, that as of May 2013, is responsible for organising all of the professional chessboxing fights worldwide and above all, for the organisation of the Chess Boxing World Championships.

The Chess Boxing Organisation India was founded in 2011 by kickboxing official and former Indian kickboxing and karate champion Montu Das. With this, the growth of chessboxing in Asia gained momentum with the first Chess Boxing Organisation in Western Asia already being built in the following year by another experienced official in the kickboxing world: Fereydoun Pouya started the Chess Boxing Organisation Iran.

At the same time, the process of turning chessboxing professional reached a milestone: The 2013 World Championship in Moscow was the first chessboxing event organised and marketed by Chess Boxing Global. With three world championship fights in one night, more than 1200 spectators and a standard of fighting never seen before, the first CBG event set new standards in the history of chessboxing with Leonid Chernobaev leading the way. He has been able to make a name for himself with more than 15 years of chess playing experience and in the boxing world, as [[Marco Huck]]'s and [[Yoan Pablo Hernández]]’ sparring partner and having fought over 200 amateur bouts. He won the light heavyweight title against Indian fighter Shailesh Tripathi after a technical knockout in the 8th round (boxing). Sven Rooch secured his title in the middleweight class division winning against Jonatan Rodriguez Vega after the Spaniard resigned in the 7th round (chess) and Russian Nikolay Sazhin won the heavyweight title against Gianluca Sirci by checkmate. Thus, Sazhin (Heavyweight), Chernobaev (Light heavyweight) and Rooch (Middleweight) would all go down in Chess Boxing history as the first Chess Boxing Global World Champions. They are also the first professional world champions in chessboxing ever.&lt;ref&gt;Nik Afanasjew: [http://www.tagesspiegel.de/sport/schachboxen-knockout-oder-matt/9160876.html Knockout oder Matt]&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of its development into a mass sport, there was much success in 2013 and early 2014 for the chessboxing world. There were more competitors in the second and third Indian Championships in summer 2013 and early 2014 than in any chessboxing events ever before, with more than 245 fighters varying in both age and weight class, taking place in Salem and Jodhpur, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Shamik Bag: [https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-25099024 Chess boxing catching on in India]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the chessboxing community in London—under the command of London Chessboxing and the WCBA—has continued to grow constantly since 2011 and by now stages chessboxing events for 800 or more spectators on a regular basis 4–5 times a year at the Scala, King's Cross.

Late 2014 also saw [http://www.chessboxingfinland.com Finnish Chessboxing Club] being founded in Helsinki by five founding members. Since 2013, actively developing Moscow Chess Boxing club [http://mcbf.ru/ MCBF]

=== 2015 to present: Chessboxing today ===
Chessboxing events in 2015 were produced by [[London Chessboxing]] under the [[World Chessboxing Association|WCBA]]—two events at [[Scala (club)|Scala]], [[Kings Cross, London|Kings Cross]] in [[London]]. The second event in June 2015, The Grandmaster Bash!, saw the British, European and [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] light welterweight world champion [[Terry Marsh (boxer)|Terry Marsh]] fight and defeat Dymer Agasaryan. [[Terry Marsh (boxer)|Terry Marsh]] (57) is the first professional boxer to compete in Chessboxing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/boxing/2367974/Marsh-happy-to-roll-with-the-punches.html|website=The Telegraph

The fight was one of the most compelling to watch as it went the distance, normal time ending in draw. After a deciding round of boxing [[Terry Marsh (boxer)|Terry Marsh]] was awarded victory on points.

Chessboxing has also become more popular among young, poor women in India where the sport has been seen as an alternative to traditional roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tarafdar|first1=Swati|title=Chess Boxing Offers a Way Out of Poverty for Young Women in India|url=https://www.newsdeeply.com/womensadvancement/articles/2018/05/10/chess-boxing-offers-a-way-out-of-poverty-for-young-women-in-india|accessdate=11 May 2018|publisher=News Deeply: Women's Advancement Deeply|date=May 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rules ==
A chessboxing fight consists of 11 rounds, 6 rounds of chess and 5 rounds of boxing, and a victory in either chess or boxing wins and ends the entire contest. Chess and boxing rounds alternate, a full-distance contest begins and ends with a round of chess. Each round lasts three minutes, regardless of whether it involves chess or boxing. A single chess game is played over the six chess rounds. These total 18 minutes; each player is subject to a [[time control]] of 9 minutes with no [[Fischer delay|increment]] to make all their moves ([[blitz chess]]). After each chess round, the exact setup is digitally recorded and then repositioned before the following chess round. The breaks between the chess and boxing rounds usually last 60 seconds. The duration of the rounds and overall fight time in amateur chessboxing fights can change to some degree, as in for example youth tournaments and exhibition fights.

=== Decisions ===
A chessboxing match can end by any of the following:
* Victory by [[knockout]] or [[technical knockout]] in boxing
* Victory by [[checkmate]] in chess
* Loss due to exceeding the chess game's [[time control]]
* Victory due to disqualification of his or her opponent by the referee e.g. due to inactivity due to overextended playing time (chess or boxing rounds following multiple warnings).
**This rule prevents a player who is in an obviously lost position in one arena from stalling in order to attempt to win in the other
* Loss by resignation (chess or boxing rounds)

In the case that neither of the chessboxers win in regulation time and the chess game ends in a [[Draw (chess)|draw]], the fighter who is ahead on boxing [[Points decision|points]] wins the overall bout. In case the scoreboard is also tied, the fighter that used the [[White and Black in chess|black]] chess pieces will be named the winner. This has not yet occurred in practice.

=== Weight classes ===
Like [[Weight class (boxing)|boxing]], chessboxers are divided into [[Weight class|weight classes]]. Currently, the following apply to professional chessboxing events of Chess Boxing Global (as of October 2014):

==== Men (17 years+) ====
* Lightweight: max. 154.324 lbs (70&amp;nbsp;kg)
* Middleweight: max. 176.37 lbs (80&amp;nbsp;kg)
* Light heavyweight: max. 198.416 lbs (90&amp;nbsp;kg)
* Heavyweight: 198.416+ lbs (90+ kg)&lt;ref&gt;Chess Boxing Global: [http://www.chessboxing-global.com/about/ CBG Rules]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Women (17 years+) ====
* Lightweight: max. 121.254 lbs (55 kg)
* Middleweight: max. 143.3 lbs (65 kg)
* Light heavyweight: max. 165.347 lbs (75 kg)
* Heavyweight: 165.347+ lbs (75+ kg)

For amateur and youth chessboxing bouts under the flag of the WCBO weight classes are graduated in 5-kilo-steps. In exception event hosts can classify into 10-kilo-steps.

== Particular requirements and training ==
A chess boxer must have strong skills in both chess and boxing in order to be permitted to compete in a professional chess boxing fight. The current minimum requirements to fight in a Chess Boxing Global event include an [[Elo rating]] of 1600 and a record of at least 50 amateur bouts fought in boxing or another similar martial art. One deciding factor in chess boxing is that the fighters have to mainly train in speed chess; the skills required by speed chess are different from those for chess using classical time controls. However, chess boxing is not only the ability to master both sports but above all, being able to withstand the constant switch from a full contact sport to a thinking sport, round after round. After three minutes of boxing, pulses are racing, yet the opponents have to face each other at the chessboard barely having taken a break, and have to then perform calmly and think tactically. This switch becomes increasingly hard for the athletes as the fight goes on and they become tired.

In order to train these skills, a specialised chess boxing training is used, in which physical interval training forms are combined with blitz or speed chess games. Thereby the fighters adapt the rhythm of a chessboxing bout.  For instance exercises like "track chess" and "stair chess" in which training partners will play an 18-minute game of speed chess over six rounds with intensive running exercises in between, such as 400-meter sprints or stair sprints. Other common methods of training combine speed chess games with strength exercises such as push-ups. The classic chess boxing training is box sparring combined with a game of speed chess.

'''Clarence Park''' is a Victorian park used for sports and leisure in [[St Albans]], [[England]]. It is still largely in its original form and has a rich variety of trees and planting. It is close to [[St Albans City railway station]].

==Overview==
The park was laid out in early 1894, and comprises a {{convert|16|acre|m2|sing=on}} municipal sports ground and a {{convert|9|acre|m2|sing=on}} public park and [[pleasure ground]]. The benefactor, Sir [[Sir John Blundell Maple, 1st Baronet|John Maple]], the owner of Maple's furniture store in [[Tottenham Court Road]] and who lived at nearby [[Childwickbury Manor|Childwickbury]], donated the land and paid for the laying out, the planting and the construction of the buildings; the layout of the park itself was designed by the City Surveyor, Mr G. Ford. A striking water fountain, which can still be seen today, was donated by Lady Maple.

The park was opened on 23 July 1894 by the [[Prince George, Duke of Cambridge|Duke of Cambridge]], a member of the [[British Royal Family|Royal family]], and the event was accompanied by great celebrations in the city of St Albans. 

The sports ground hosts cricket, hockey, bowls and croquet and is also the home of [[St Albans City F.C.|St Albans City Football Club]]. 

The public park includes large grass areas used for sun bathing and games during summer, a bandstand, a children's play-park and a café. The public park is also used as the site of some of the human "Peopletown" skits on [[Disney Channel]]'s preschool series ''[[Bunnytown]]''.

==Cricket ground==
[[File:Cricket Pavilion, Clarence Park - geograph.org.uk - 121356.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cricket pavilion]] at Clarence Park]]

The '''Estadio Manuel Ferreira''' is a [[Association football|football]] [[stadium]] in [[Asunción]], [[Paraguay]]. It is the home venue of [[Olimpia Asunción|Club Olimpia]] and is named after former club president [[Manuel Ferreira Sosa]].

The stadium was opened in May 1964 with a friendly match between Olimpia and the powerful [[Santos Futebol Clube|Santos FC]] of [[Brazil]], which had the great [[Pelé]] in its team. The excitement to see Pelé playing was so big that the stadium's capacity was exceeded. Because of that during the game one of the fences supporting the crowd in the stands broke and many were injured. As soon as the incident happened, Pelé ran and jumped over the fence to help the injured people. Only minor injuries occurred and the match proceeded, ending in a 2–2 draw.

Even though this is the "home" of Club Olimpia, the [[Estadio Defensores del Chaco|Defensores del Chaco]] stadium is used for important matches such as international matches for [[Copa Libertadores]] or derbies against the classic rivals such as [[Cerro Porteño]]. This is because the Defensores del Chaco has a greater capacity (48,000).

The stadium is nicknamed "El Bosque de Para Uno" on account of its surroundings constituting large, tall trees, thus the area is vaguely reminiscent of a [[forest]] (bosque). "Para Uno" references the location having been the first stop of a now defunct [[Paraguay]]an train.

[[File:Goal Line Technology Diagram.png|thumb|right|Diagram of a Goal Line Technology system based around sensors in the ball and goal frame. Most operational systems instead use cameras to track the ball ]]
In [[association football]], '''goal-line technology''' (sometimes referred to as a '''Goal Decision System''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wenger praise for Goal Decision System|url=http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/news/news/2013-14/aug/arsene-wenger-praise-for-goal-decision-system.html|publisher=PremierLeague.com|accessdate=10 August 2013|date=8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the use of electronic aid to determine if a [[Scoring in association football|goal]] has been scored or not. In detail, it is a method used to determine when the ball has completely crossed the goal line in between the goal-posts and underneath the crossbar with the assistance of electronic devices and at the same time assisting the [[Referee (association football)|referee]] in awarding a goal or not. The objective of goal-line technology (GLT) is not to replace the role of the officials, but rather to support them in their decision-making. The GLT must provide a clear indication as to whether the ball has fully crossed the line, and this information will serve to assist the referee in making his final decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=FIFA|title=Testing Manual|journal=FIFA Quality Programme for Goal Line Technology|year=2012|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/fifaqualityprogramme/goal-linetechnology/01/66/02/89/glt_testing_manual_2012.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to similar technology in other sports, goal-line technology is a relatively recent addition to association football; its integration having been opposed by the sport's authorities. In July 2012, the [[International Football Association Board]] (IFAB) officially approved the use of goal line technology, amending the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]] to permit (but not require) its use. Due to its expense, goal-line technology is only used at the highest levels of the game. Goal-line technology is currently used in the top European domestic leagues, and at major international competitions such as the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 Men's]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1117/2.2201406.01| title = Keeping an eye on the ball| journal = SPIE Newsroom| year = 2014| last1 = Thomas | first1 = K. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/y=2014/m=4/news=goal-line-technology-set-ahead-fifa-world-cup-2311481.html|title=Goal-line technology set up ahead of FIFA World Cup|first=|last=FIFA.com|date=1 April 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018 Men's]]&lt;ref&gt;https://football-technology.fifa.com/en/blog/hidden-technologies-at--2018-fwc/&lt;/ref&gt; and [[2015 FIFA Women's World Cup|2015 Women's]] FIFA World Cups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/womensworldcup/news/y=2015/m=3/news=hawk-eye-confirmed-as-goal-line-technology-provider-for-canada-2015-2580727.html |title=Hawk-Eye confirmed as goal-line technology provider for Canada 2015 |date=31 March 2015 |publisher=[[FIFA]] |access-date=2 June 2015}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{seealso|Scoring in association football}}
In association football, a [[Goal (sport)#Association football|goal]] is scored if the whole of the ball crosses the [[Football pitch|goal line]] between the [[goalpost]]s and under the crossbar. In most cases, this is relatively unambiguous (goal nets being a low-tech way of verifying that the ball passed the correct side of the goalposts). Occasionally however situations occur when it is difficult for [[referee (association football)|referee]]s and their [[Assistant referee (association football)|assistant]]s to tell if a goal has been scored before a rebound, save, or defender's clearance from the goal area.

==Rules==
Since 2012, goal-line technology has been permitted in matches. Text relating to goal-line technology can now be found within four of the Laws of the Game:

*'''Law 1 ([[Football pitch|The Field of Play]])''': permitting modifications to the goal frame.
*'''Law 2 ([[Ball (association football)|The Ball]])''': permitting the use of approved balls with integrated technology.
*'''Law 5 ([[Referee (association football)|The Referee]])''': requiring the referee to test a goal-line technology system prior to a match and not use it if a fault is found.
*'''Law 10 ([[Scoring in association football|The Method of Scoring]])''': permitting use of goal-line technology to verify whether or not goals have been scored. It states that "the use of GLT must be stipulated in the respective competition rules".

The Laws themselves are not specific as to the nature of Goal Line technology systems, however other documentation from FIFA, which is cited by the Laws, goes into more detail. The ''FIFA Quality Programme for GLT Testing Manual''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quality.fifa.com/en/News/Updated-goal-line-technology-testing-manual-published/|title=Updated goal-line technology testing manual published - FIFA Quality Programme|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150515115539/http://quality.fifa.com/en/News/Updated-goal-line-technology-testing-manual-published/|archivedate=15 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; precisely define the requirements of the systems. Four basic requirements of a system are stipulated:

*The system must address ''only'' the matter of whether a goal has been scored or not.
*The system must be accurate.
*The system must indicate the scoring of a goal immediately, confirming this within one second.
*The system must communicate its information solely to the match officials (via vibration and visual alert on the referee's watch)

FIFA have a system whereby a particular technology provider needs to show effectiveness to successfully obtain a license for their technology, then an installation within a particular stadium must pass a "final installation test" before use, and before each game the referee must check that the system is functional.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://football-technology.fifa.com/media/1011/goal-line_technology_testing_manual_2014.pdf|title=TESTING MANUAL 2014 version 2.0|last=|first=|date=|year=2014|website=FIFA.com|publisher=FIFA Quality Programme for Goal-Line Technology|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quality.fifa.com/en/Goal-Line-Technology/Become-a-licensee/Final-installation-test/|title=Final installation test - FIFA Quality Programme|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706221701/http://quality.fifa.com/en/Goal-Line-Technology/Become-a-licensee/Final-installation-test/|archivedate=6 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current implementation==
Due to the expense of goal-line technology systems, the technology is only currently used at the very top levels of the game. In domestic competition, goal-line technology is only regularly used in a few major European leagues:
[[Serie A]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Serie A approves goal-line technology for next season|url=http://www.espnfc.co.uk/italian-serie-a/story/2297461/serie-a-approves-goal-line-technology-for-next-season|accessdate=6 January 2016|work=ESPN FC|date=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

and the [[Premier League]].&lt;ref name="Premier_league"&gt;{{cite news|title=Goal-line technology: Premier League votes in favour for 2013-14|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22107409|accessdate=6 January 2016|work=BBC|date=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Asof|September 2018}}, FIFA's website list 167 stadiums with licensed GLT installations, 166 of which use the [[Hawk-Eye]] system.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://football-technology.fifa.com/en/resource-hub/certified-product-database/goal-line-technology/installations/|title=FOOTBALL TECHNOLOGY - Resource Hub|publisher=FIFA}}&lt;/ref&gt; One stadium uses [[GoalControl]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://football-technology.fifa.com/en/resource-hub/certified-product-database/goal-line-technology/installations/|title=FOOTBALL TECHNOLOGY - Resource Hub|publisher=FIFA}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is the other licensed provider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Football Technology - Installations |url=https://football-technology.fifa.com/en/resource-hub/certified-product-database/goal-line-technology/installations/ |website=|publisher=FIFA |accessdate=16 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Pre-implementation history===
Prior to 2012, competitions were unable to implement technology as provision was not made for it in the Laws. The Laws of association football are controlled by the [[International Football Association Board]] (IFAB), a body on which FIFA holds 50% of the voting power, sufficient to veto any changes to the laws.

====Pre-2011====
Compared to other sports, association football was late to allow technology to assist with in-game decisions. The matter was a subject of debate within the game for over a decade with the game's lawmakers resisting calls for its implementation.

Throughout the 2000s various incidents incited discussion as to the potential for goal-line technology in the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nigerian media bitter in defeat|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/africa/cup_of_nations/cup_news/642400.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=1 August 2012|date=14 February 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/4130167.stm |title=Manchester United 0-0 Tottenham |publisher=BBC News |date=4 January 2005 |accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/aug/15/crystal-palace-neil-warnock-freddie-sears |title = Neil Warnock furious as 'phantom goal' costs Crystal Palace |first = Herman |last = Miller |date = 15 August 2009 |location=London |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/aug/17/bristol-city-palace-no-replay |title = Bristol City-Crystal Palace game will not be replayed |date = 17 August 2009 | location=London |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of use of technology in association football was contrasted with other sports, which had incorporated video replays and other systems into their rules.&lt;ref name="UK_PM"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Emery|first1=Daniel|title=PM and goal-line technology firms dispute Fifa claims|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10435509|accessdate=23 April 2015|work=BBC|date=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to this, FIFA decided to test a system by [[Adidas]] in which a football with an embedded [[integrated circuit|microchip]] would send a signal to the referee if it crossed a sensor going through the goal.&lt;ref name="geekweek1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geekweek.com/2010/04/goal-line-technology-cross-too-many-lines-for-fifa-1.html |title=Goal-Line Technology: Crossing Too Many Lines For FIFA? |publisher=GeekWeek |date=19 April 2010 |first=Liam |last=McGrath |accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to FIFA president [[Sepp Blatter]], "We did different tests at the [[2005 FIFA U-17 World Championship|Under-17 World Cup in Peru]] but the evidence wasn't clear so we will carry out trials in junior competitions in 2007".&lt;ref name="geekweek1" /&gt; However, those trials did not materialise and by 2008, Blatter had rejected the system outright, describing the technology as 'only 95% accurate'.&lt;ref name="geekweek1" /&gt; FIFA and IFAB were resistant to introducing technology in the game, voting in March 2010 to permanently ditch the technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Football's lawmakers reject goal-line technology|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/8553463.stm|accessdate=23 April 2015|work=BBC|date=6 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following several refereeing errors at the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] – including the disallowed goal in [[Germany national football team|Germany]]'s 4–1 victory over [[England national football team|England]], when [[Frank Lampard]] hit a shot from outside of the penalty box that bounced off the crossbar and over the line; the ball came back out and the goal was disallowed because the [[Assistant referee (association football)|assistant referee]] did not call for a goal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/soccer/world-cup-2010/writers/jonathan_wilson/06/28/soccer.technology/index.html |title = Soccer could use instant replay, but not at expense of the sport's flow |first = Jonathan |last = Wilson |date = 28 June 2010 |work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; – Blatter announced that FIFA would reopen the goal-line technology discussion.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/30/sports/soccer/30ref.html?hp|title=FIFA President Apologizes for Refereeing Errors|date=29 June 2010|work=NY Times|accessdate=29 June 2010 | first=Jeffrey | last=Marcus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]], [[UEFA]] president [[Michel Platini]] dismissed the need for goal-line technology, instead arguing for placing additional assistant referees behind the goal. However, in a Group D match with [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]] losing 1–0 to [[England national football team|England]], the on-field officials did not see Ukraine's [[Marko Dević]]'s shot briefly cross the line before it was cleared by England's [[John Terry]], although an offside in the build-up to the incident was too unnoticed by the match officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/9343883/Euro-2012-Ukraines-ghost-goal-against-England-another-example-of-why-we-need-goal-line-technology-says-Sepp-Blatter.html|title=Euro 2012: Ukraine's ghost goal against England another example of why we need goal-line technology, says Sepp Blatter|work=The Daily Telegrapgh|date=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/rooney-seizes-his-chance-to-lift-englands-expectations-7866807.html|title=Rooney seizes his chance to lift England's expectations |work=The Independent|date=20 June 2012|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Initial testing====
[[File:Teamgeist II adidas.jpg|thumb|The [[Adidas]] Teamgeist II with implanted chip, part of the proposed Cairos-Adidas system for goal-line technology]]
Heeding calls for the use of technology, in July 2011 FIFA began a process of sanctioned tests that eventually resulted in the approval of the systems used in the current game.

The first stage of testing considered multiple goal-line technology systems, with the requirement that the system notified the referee of the decision within one second of the incident happening. The message needed to be relayed via a visual signal and vibration.&lt;ref name="july 2011"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/jul/21/fifa-goal-line-technology | work=[[The Guardian]] | title=Fifa to run tests on nine goal-line technology systems this autumn | date=21 July 2011 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tests were conducted by [[Empa]] between September and December 2011.&lt;ref name="March 2012 IFAB/FIFA"&gt;{{cite news|last=Conway|first=Richard|title=Goal-line technology edges closer |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17228500|accessdate=3 March 2012|work=[[BBC Sport]]|date=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tested systems included:&lt;ref name="March 2012 IFAB/FIFA" /&gt;

* A system from [[Carios Technologies]], in collaboration with [[Adidas]], based around a modified ball with an implanted chip and a magnetic field generated by thin cables behind the goal line. The system could detect if the ball passed through the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wipo.int/wipo_magazine/en/2010/04/article_0001.html |title=Goal-line technology – Getting it right |publisher=[[The WIPO Journal]] |date=August 2010 |accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[GoalRef]]: Another system based on generated magnetic fields and a sensor within the ball.&lt;ref name="belgium/eng announcement" /&gt;
* Goalminder: A system based on cameras installed in the goal frame. This provided a visual playback to officials rather than an automatic goal-or-no-goal alert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goalminder.co.uk/ |title=About Goalminder - Goal Line Technology - Visually Informed |accessdate=13 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111215103841/http://www.goalminder.co.uk/ |archivedate=15 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/business/enterprise/s/1461303_goalminder-aims-to-end-goal-line-errors |title=Goalminder aims to end goal-line errors |date=11 October 2011 |publisher=menmedia.co.uk |accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hawk-Eye]]: A [[Sony]]-owned system based several on multiple high-speed cameras whose images are used to which [[Triangulation|triangulate]] the position of the ball.&lt;ref name="belgium/eng announcement" /&gt; Hawk-Eye systems were, and still are, used in several other sports for supporting officiating decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Sport technology enables improved decisions |date = 11 October 2011 |first = David |last = Boothroyd |url = http://www.newelectronics.co.uk/electronics-technology/sport-technology-enables-improved-decisions/37425/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Second phase of testing====
On 3 March 2012, [[IFAB]] announced that two of the eight proposed systems had proceeded to the second stage of testing. These were Hawk-Eye and GoalRef.&lt;ref name="March 2012 IFAB/FIFA"/&gt; In the second phase of testing, the manufacturer of the technology chose a stadium to test its technology in a number of imagined scenarios. Testing was also conducted in professional training sessions and in laboratories to account for different climatic conditions and other magnetic field distortions. There were also tests on the watches to be worn by referees. The systems underwent testing in some competitive matches.

GoalRef technology underwent match testing in some [[Danish Superliga]] matches in the first half of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dbu.dk/Nyheder/2012/Maj/FIFA_tester_teknologi.aspx |title=FIFA tester teknologi i Silkeborg og Farum |last=Berendt |first=Lars |publisher=[[Danish Football Association]] |language=Danish |date=16 May 2012 |accessdate=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sciencenordic.com/ball-tells-you-when-it%E2%80%99s|title=The ball tells you when it’s in|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the second phase trials, on 5 July 2012 IFAB approved GoalRef in principle, making it available for use in professional matches under a set of revised [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]]. Each installation however would also require licensing approval for use in the individual stadium, on a 12-month basis. The [[2012 FIFA Club World Cup]] was the first tournament where GoalRef was used by a match referee. Goal Ref was used for the first time on 6 December 2012 in the first match of the 2012 FIFA Club World Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/premier-league/fifa-give-debut-to-goalline-technology-in-world-club-curtainraiser-3317352.html
|title= FIFA give debut to goal-line technology in World club curtain-raiser|date=6 December 2012 |work=Irish Independent|accessdate=6 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first match to use the Hawk-Eye goal-line technology was [[Eastleigh F.C.]] versus [[A.F.C. Totton]] in the [[Hampshire Senior Cup]] final at [[St Mary's Stadium]], [[Southampton]] in [[England]] on 16 May 2012. Although it used Hawk-Eye, the system had no bearing on the referee's decisions and the system readings were only available to [[FIFA]]'s independent testing agency.&lt;ref name="April bbc"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17874013 | title=Non-league final to be used for goal-line technology experiment | date=27 April 2012 | work=[[BBC Sport]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system was also in place for the technology's second test on 2 June for [[England national football team|England]]'s [[friendly match]] against [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]].&lt;ref name="belgium/eng announcement"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/may/24/england-belgium-goalline-technology | title=England friendly against Belgium to be big test of goalline technology | newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | date=24 May 2012 | location=London | first=Jamie | last=Jackson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Introduction===
[[File:Dzeko city.jpg|thumb|[[Edin Džeko]] of Manchester City scored the first goal in the Premier League that was given by goal-line technology]]
Following the success of the trials, in July 2012 IFAB voted unanimously to officially amend the Laws of the Game to permit (but not require) goal-line technology.&lt;ref name=IFABofficial&gt;{{cite web|title=IFAB makes three unanimous historic decisions|url=https://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/news/y=2012/m=7/news=ifab-makes-three-unanimous-historic-decisions-1660541.html|website=FIFA.com|publisher=FIFA|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In December 2012, [[FIFA]] announced it would introduce goal-line technology at the [[2012 FIFA Club World Cup]] in [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/FIFA-set-to-introduce-goal-line-technology/tabid/415/articleID/279404/Default.aspx/Default.aspx|work=3 News NZ |title= Goal-line tech gets green light| date=6 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hawk-Eye]] technology was employed at [[Toyota Stadium]], while GoalRef was used at [[International Stadium Yokohama]].

[[GoalControl]], a camera-based system which uses 14 high-speed cameras located around the pitch and directed at both goals, was used at [[2013 Confederations Cup]], partly as a trial for use at the next year's [[2014 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/apr/02/fifa-goalline-technology-snub-hawkeye|title= Fifa snubs Hawk-Eye in favour of German goalline technology|date=2 April 2013|work=Guardian|accessdate=4 April 2013|location=London|first=Dominic|last=Fifield}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCgoalcontrol"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22002733 | title=GoalControl to provide goal-line system at World Cup in Brazil | publisher=BBC | date=2 April 2013 | accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Football Association]] announced that Hawk-Eye would be used in the [[2013–14 Premier League|2013–14 Premier League season]].&lt;ref name="BBC_Premier"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22107409 | title=Goal-line technology: Premier League votes in favour for 2013-14 | work=BBC | date=2013-04-11 | accessdate=2013-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 December 2013, it was announced that Hawk-Eye would be used in three of the four quarter-finals and subsequent matches in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;BBC: [https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/25405720 Football League to use goal-line technology in Capital One Cup]&lt;/ref&gt; The system was used when, on the very next day, in the [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] – [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] quarter-final, a goal from Frank Lampard was allowed.&lt;ref&gt;BBC: [https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/25312545 Sunderland 2-1 Chelsea]&lt;/ref&gt; The first goal to be decisively awarded using goal-line technology in the English Premier League was [[Edin Džeko]]'s goal for [[Manchester City]] against [[Cardiff City]] on 18 January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Arsenal stay top, technology aids Manchester City |date=19 January 2014 |first=Tom |last= Williams |url= http://www.smh.com.au/sport/soccer/arsenal-stay-top-technology-aids-manchester-city-20140119-3124s.html |work=Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following success at the Confederations Cup, GoalControl was used at the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]]. The first goal given by the technology was in the 15 June 2014 [[2014 FIFA World Cup Group E#France vs Honduras|group stage match]] between [[France national football team|France]] and [[Honduras national football team|Honduras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=France 3-0 Honduras|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25285092|accessdate=15 June 2014|work=[[BBC Sport]]|date=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goal Line Technology was implemented across the major European competitions. In December 2014, the [[Bundesliga]] clubs approved goal-line technology that will be introduced at the start of the [[2015–16 Bundesliga]] season. The league picked the cheaper Hawk-Eye system over two German technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carlyleobserver.com/sports/bundesliga-approves-hawk-eye-goal-line-technology-for-new-season-1.1650074|title=Bundesliga approves Hawk-Eye goal-line technology for new season|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; GoalControl was introduced for [[Ligue 1]] for the start of the [[2015–16 Ligue 1]] season.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ligue1.com/ligue1/article/lfp-adopts-goal-line-technology.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GC_L1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Ligue 1 decides to go with GoalControl {{!}} GoalControl - Advanced Goal Line Technology |url=https://www.goalcontrol.de/en/news/2015/05/21/ligue-1-entscheidet-sich-f%C3%BCr-goalcontrol/ |website=www.goalcontrol.de |accessdate=13 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ligue 1 later switched to using Hawk-Eye in 2018 after the GoalControl system made errors.&lt;ref name="L1-GC-HE"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Holyman |first1=Ian |title=Hawk-Eye to provide goal-line tech in Ligue 1 |url=http://www.espn.co.uk/football/french-ligue-1/story/3472391/hawk-eye-to-provide-goal-line-tech-in-ligue-1-after-goal-control-deal-ended |accessdate=13 July 2018 |work=ESPN.com |date=26 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goal Line Technology was used in the [[UEFA Europa League]] final, [[UEFA Champions League]], [[UEFA European Championship|European Championship]] and [[Copa America]] for the first time in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35726091|title=Goalline technology to be used in Champions League final|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/22/uefa-goal-line-technology-euro-2016|title=Uefa to use goal-line technology at Euro 2016 and in Champions League|first=Press|last=Association|date=22 January 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fourfourtwo.com/news/copa-america-use-goal-line-technology#:b-aD2lVKTshaWA|title=Copa America to use goal-line technology|date=26 May 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Criticism==

===Human element is lost===
While advocates for goal-line technology maintain that it would significantly reduce refereeing errors during play, there are also criticisms of the technology. Much of the criticism came from within FIFA itself including former FIFA president [[Sepp Blatter]]. Apart from the criticisms revolving around the technical aspects of the two proposed technologies, critics point out that such technology would impact on the human element of the game and remove the enjoyment of debating mistakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kelso |first=Paul |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup-2010/teams/england/7857951/England-v-Germany-Frank-Lampards-goal-reignites-goal-line-technology-debate.html |title=England v Germany: Frank Lampard's 'goal' reignites goal-line technology debate |newspaper=The Telegraph |date= 27 June 2010|accessdate=28 June 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sepp Blatter has been quoted as saying "Other sports regularly change the laws of the game to react to the new technology. ... We don't do it and this makes the fascination and the popularity of football".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=CBC Sports |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/soccer/story/2008/03/08/fifa-instant-replay.html |title=FIFA halts instant replay experiment |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=8 March 2008 |accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study suggested that in the [[2010–11 Premier League|2010–11 Premier League season]] "errors took place nearly 30% of the time that video replays could help prevent", but some people claim that instant replays would interrupt the flow of the game and take away possible plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newelectronics.co.uk/electronics-technology/sport-technology-enables-improved-decisions/37425/ |title=Sport technology enables improved decisions |date=11 October 2011 |publisher=newelectronics.co.uk |accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics believe it would be prohibitively expensive to implement the technology at all levels of the game and particularly for smaller/poorer football associations. FIFA officials have expressed a preference for 'better refereeing' as well as more match officials over implementing the technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup-2010/teams/england/7857729/England-v-Germany-Fifa-want-better-refereeing-not-goal-line-technology.html |title=England v Germany: Fifa want 'better refereeing' not goal-line technology |newspaper=The Telegraph |date= 27 June 2010|accessdate=28 June 2010 | location=London | first=Paul | last=Kelso}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Advocates in turn cite the many examples of incorrect goal-line decisions deciding important games and point out that the technology has improved much since the initial trials carried out by FIFA.  Advocates contend that any extra help for the referee should outweigh arguments that it would lead to non-uniform rules (since not all football associations would be able to implement it).

Blatter had been opposed to goal-line technology until [[Frank Lampard]]'s disallowed goal in the [[2010 World Cup]]  where the ball clearly crossed the line.&lt;ref name="july 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/sports/soccer/news/_/id/7061644/soccer-not-set-install-goal-line-aids-2013 |title=Soccer: No goal-line aids until 2013 |date=5 October 2011 |publisher=ESPN |location=London |accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2012/dec/11/michel-platini-goalline-technology-video|title=Michel Platini: goalline technology money would be better spent on grassroots – video|first=|last=theguardian.com|date=11 December 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of [[Assistant referee (association football)#Additional assistant referee|additional assistant referees,]] who are mostly positioned beside the goal-line, was partly in order to facilitate in such situations.

===Cost===

In April 2013, [[Major League Soccer|MLS]] commissioner Don Garber confirmed that MLS would not adopt goal-line technology for the 2014 season, citing cost as the overriding factor. [[GoalControl]] installation would cost about $260,000 per stadium, and a further $3,900 for each game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2013/04/25/mls-commissioner-don-garber-says-league-wont-adopt-goal-line-technology-2014|title=mlssoccer.com - MLS Commissioner Don Garber says league won't adopt goal-line technology by 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In early 2014, the vast majority of teams in the two divisions of the German [[Bundesliga]] voted against introducing goal-line technology for financial reasons. The costs per club would have ranged from  €250,000 for a chip inside the ball up to €500,000 for Hawk-Eye or GoalControl. The manager of [[1. FC Köln]], [[Jörg Schmadtke]], summarized the vote with "The cost is so exorbitant, that using this (technology) is not acceptable".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/sport/fussball/bundesliga-fuehrt-torlinientechnologie-vorerst-nicht-ein-a-960412.html Fußball: Bundesliga verzichtet auf Torlinientechnik], Spiegel Online, 2014-03-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

World governing body FIFA are set to make £300,000 from the Premier League’s decision to install goal-line technology in all top-flight stadiums before the start of next season. Each of the 20 clubs will have to pay FIFA £15,000 to install, test and receive the ‘FIFA quality seal’ for Hawk-Eye’s camera-based system, which is expected to cost around £250,000 per ground in total. FIFA will also make an extra £15,000 from Wembley Stadium, which will have the technology installed for use in events such as the FA Cup semi-finals and final.

The [[Scottish Professional Football League]] stated in December 2017 that it would not be implementing goal-line technology, as it is only affordable for the richest leagues in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42504610 |title=Goal-line technology 'unaffordable' for Scottish Premiership |first=Jonathan |last=Sutherland |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |date=28 December 2017 |accessdate=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hassanal Bolkiah National Stadium''' is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Bandar Seri Begawan]], [[Brunei]]. It is currently used mostly for [[association football]] matches. The stadium holds 28,000 and was opened in 1984. It was named after [[Sultan of Brunei|Bruneian Sultan]] [[Hassanal Bolkiah]].

== Construction ==
Unusually for a public building in Brunei, members of the public donated and contributed towards the building of the stadium. Although the final collection of $1,102,761.57 accounted for a little more than 1.1 percent of the total building cost ($100 million), the public participation showed the Bruneians' great interest and support for this project. The entire project cost for the stadium is about $100 million.

== Opening ==
It was opened on 23 September 1983, the date was chosen to celebrate the 69th birthday of Bolkiah's father and predecessor [[Omar Ali Saifuddien III]]. On the evening of the opening day, a friendly football match was played between the [[Brunei national football team]] and an invited [[English Football League]] team, [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]]. Despite the jet lag and the humid weather, Sheffield United won 1–0. The next day another match was held between United and a Brunei invited team which ended in a 1-1 draw.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bt.com.bn/en/life/2008/10/26/national_stadium_celebrates_its_25th_year National Stadium celebrates its 25th year] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214074651/http://bt.com.bn/en/life/2008/10/26/national_stadium_celebrates_its_25th_year |date=2009-02-14 }} [[The Brunei Times]], 26 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Newmarket Road''' was the home ground for [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], before they moved to [[The Nest (football ground)|The Nest]].

Today, the club plays at [[Carrow Road]], which has been their home ground since 1935.

==History==
Norwich City F.C. played at Newmarket Road from the club's founding in 1902 to 1908, with a record attendance of 10,366 in a match against [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] in a second round FA Cup match in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

'''Percival Molson Memorial Stadium''' (also known in [[French language|French]] as '''''Stade Percival-Molson'''''; commonly referred to as '''Molson Stadium''' in English or '''Stade Molson''' in French) is an outdoor [[Canadian football|football]] stadium located [[Downtown Montreal|downtown]] on the slopes of [[Mount Royal]] in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], [[Canada]]. Named in honour of [[Percival Molson]], it is owned by [[McGill University]] and has been the home of the [[Montreal Alouettes]] of the [[Canadian Football League]] from 1954 to 1967 and again from 1998 to present. The stadium is also home to the [[McGill Redmen]] of the [[RSEQ]], the [[Montreal Royal (AUDL)|Montreal Royal]] of the [[American Ultimate Disc League]], and the Canadian Corporate Soccer League, the largest amateur corporate league in Canada. The [[Selwyn House School|Selwyn House Gryphons]] high-school football team also play their home games at the stadium. The stadium has a capacity of 23,420 the result of a renovation project begun in 2009 that increased capacity from 20,202 to over 25,000, before seats were removed in 2014 to reduce capacity to its current level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://montrealgazette.com/sports/football/cfl/montreal-alouettes/sold-out-molson-stadium-crowd-to-see-if-jacques-chapdelaine-can-turn-alouettes-around|title=Sold-out Molson Stadium crowd to see if Jacques Chapdelaine can turn Alouettes around|last=Zurkowsky|first=Herb|work=[[Montreal Gazette]]|date=October 1, 2016|accessdate=August 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Montreal Alouettes vs. Hamilton Tiger-Cats,  July 6 2006.jpg|thumb|[[Montreal Alouettes]] [[cheerleader]]s entertain the crowd during a timeout in a game against the [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]] on July 6, 2006, at Molson Stadium]]
[[File:Football. At Molson Stadium BAnQ P48S1P06931.jpg|thumb|left|Football practice in 1941]]

Construction was completed in 1914 on what was then known as McGill Graduates stadium, which was located on the slope of [[Mount Royal]], at the corner of University and Pine (avenue Des Pins). The stadium sat dormant through [[World War I]] with the cessation of football from 1914 to 1918. On July 5, 1917, Captain [[Percival Molson]] (1880&amp;ndash;1917), a [[McGill University]] alumnus and sports star who had been instrumental in getting the stadium plan approved, was killed in action in [[France]] (Molson was the great-grandson of brewer [[John Molson]]). His will left $75,000 to the university to help pay most of the total costs for the completion of the stadium. Other individual donors whose generosity built and renovated the stadium were [[William C. Macdonald]] and [[John Wilson McConnell|John W. McConnell]]. Designed by [[Percy Erskine Nobbs]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://cac.mcgill.ca/campus/buildings/Gym.html ''Virtual McGill'']&lt;/ref&gt; the stadium was officially dedicated as '''McGill Graduates' Stadium''' at an intercollegiate track meet on October 22, 1915. It was renamed Percival Molson Memorial Stadium on October 25, 1919 by the university's Board of Governors, in honour of their fallen hero.

The Montreal Alouettes played at the stadium from 1954 to 1967 before moving to the [[Autostade]]. An attempted return to the Molson Stadium in 1972 was not successful and the team went back to the Autostade the following season. When a revived Alouettes franchise was forced to move a playoff game out of [[Olympic Stadium (Montreal)|Olympic Stadium]] due to a [[U2]] concert, they moved the game to Molson Stadium. The game was a sellout, prompting the Als to make Molson Stadium their primary home the following season.  However, all playoff games are played at Olympic Stadium, which until 2007 hosted at least one home game as well. Percival Molson Stadium is also home of the [[Selwyn House School|Selwyn House]] Gryphons&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.versusfootball.com/showGame.action?gameId=6944&amp;leagueId=14&amp;newsId=7645 Versusfootball.com - Le site web ultime pour les équipes, joueurs et fans de football!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and the McGill [[McGill Redmen football|Redmen football]] and rugby teams. The only [[Grey Cup]] game to have been played at Molson Stadium was in 1931. Nevertheless, it was the first time the Grey Cup had been contested outside of Ontario. It also served as a venue for [[Field hockey at the 1976 Summer Olympics|field hockey]], during the [[1976 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1976/1976v2.pdf 1976 Summer Olympics official report.] Volume 2. pp. 150-5.&lt;/ref&gt; It seated 20,202 and had been sold out for Alouettes games from August 12, 1999 until the 2009 renovation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.montrealalouettes.com/article/the_cfl_publishes_the_2008_schedule The CFL Publishes The 2008 Schedule | Montreal Alouettes&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304214200/http://en.montrealalouettes.com/article/the_cfl_publishes_the_2008_schedule |date=2012-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alouettes' decision to return to the venue was problematic because the team was being sponsored by the [[Labatt Brewing Company]] and the stadium shared the name of its major competitor, [[Molson Brewery|Molson]], though not named for it. Eventually, the team chose to change sponsors and have been sponsored by Budweiser since 2014. In 2004, The Alouettes installed a [[FieldTurf]] surface at Molson Stadium replacing the old-style Astroturf.

==Renovation==
Molson Stadium has been renovated and expanded, adding nearly 5,000 seats in time for the [[2010 CFL season]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.montrealkiosk.com/the-montrealer.php The Montrealer - Montreal Newspapers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The project to see the smallest CFL stadium increase to a [[seating capacity]] of 25,012 cost $29.4 million.&lt;ref name="bare_url"&gt;[http://en.montrealalouettes.com/article/visiting-the-new-home Visiting the Alouettes' new home | Montreal Alouettes&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Eleven rows were removed from the south side of the stadium to construct a second tier and add the majority of the new seats, about 3,800. Also, temporary bleachers in the east end-zone were replaced with 1,500 permanent seats, a new section was added to the northeast corner, and 19 new private suites were constructed. The cost of the renovations were shared by the [[Quebec]] government ($19.3 million), the city of Montreal ($4 million), and [[Robert Wetenhall]], the Alouettes' owner ($6,023,935).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.canada.com/Sports/Expansion+Montreal+Molson+Stadium+approved/1367728/story.html|title=Expansion of Montreal's Molson Stadium approved|last=Zurkowsky|first=Herb|publisher=Montreal Gazette|date=March 8, 2009|accessdate=March 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/football/story/2009/03/09/mtl-stadium-expansion.html|title=Molson Stadium to begin $29.4M expansion|publisher=CBC News|date=March 9, 2009|accessdate=March 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bare_url_a"&gt;[http://en.montrealalouettes.com/article/percival-molson-stadium_47113 Expansion Project Approved | Montreal Alouettes&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810033034/http://en.montrealalouettes.com/article/percival-molson-stadium_47113 |date=2011-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Layout==
Because the playing surface is surrounded by a running track, the full 65-yard width of the end zones is not available at the two end lines. However, the full width is available for more than half of each end zone, with the only missing pieces being the relatively small bits off the corners. Since the [[2014 CFL season]], it is the only stadium in the CFL to cut the corners on the end zones after Edmonton's [[Commonwealth Stadium (Edmonton)|Commonwealth Stadium]] squared off theirs.

'''Skibobbing''' is a [[winter sport]]  involving a bicycle-type frame attached to skis instead of wheels and some times a set of foot skis. The use of foot skis is what actually defines "skibobbing". Although the original idea for a bicycle with skis was patented as early as 1892, and skibobbing had been a form of transportation in the [[Alps]], it was not until 1954 that the first international race was held. Seven years later, the FISB (Fédération Internationále de Skibob) was formed, which since 1967 has held an annual Skibobbing World Championship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skibike.net/History.htm Skibike.net]&lt;/ref&gt; Although skibobs are often called ski bikes or snow bikes they&lt;ref name=skibob&gt;{{cite web|title=SkiBob|url=http://www.holz-schlitten.de/SkiBob_idQQ1ZZmodeQQartlistZZcatQQ7|publisher=www.holz-schlitten.de|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; are completely separate, and the sport should not be confused with [[snowbiking]],&lt;ref name=skibob /&gt; which is the sport or recreation of cycling on [[snow]].

Originally, skibobbing was one of the very few methods by which people without strength in their knees could [[alpine ski]], but it soon became a popular sport amongst the physically able, too.  The main attractions are said to be the speeds attained (in some skibob [[giant slalom]] races, speeds can be reached of up to 120&amp;nbsp;mph or more) and the feeling of [[jet skiing]] on snow.

Austrian skibobber [[Erich Brenter]] is noted for setting the first world record for downhill skibobbing speed in 1964, at {{Convert|102|mph}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,836821,00.html?promoid=googlep Time (magazine): 1967]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sophia Gardens Cardiff''' ({{lang-cy|Gerddi Soffia Caerdydd}}) is a [[cricket]] stadium in [[Cardiff]], [[Wales]]. It is located in [[Sophia Gardens]] on the [[River Taff]]. It is home to [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club]] and is listed as an international [[List of Test cricket grounds|Test cricket venue]].

The venue is home to [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club]] which has played its home matches there since 24 May 1967,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/allaction/139727171/in/set-72057594124227176/ Pavilion Plaque, Sophia Gardens]&lt;/ref&gt; after moving away from [[Cardiff Arms Park]]. A 125-year lease of the ground was acquired in 1995, with the previous leaseholders, [[Cardiff Athletic Club]], moving its cricket section ([[Cardiff Cricket Club]]) to the Diamond Ground in [[Whitchurch, Cardiff|Whitchurch]]. Beside the cricket ground is the large sports hall complex of the [[Sport Wales National Centre]]. [[Cardiff Corinthians F.C.]] have previously used the area for football. In July 2007, Glamorgan cricketer [[Mike Powell (cricketer)|Mike Powell]] was granted his wish to have a rib, removed during surgery, buried at the ground.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/glamorgan/content/story/302557.html Powell buries his rib at Sophia Gardens]&lt;/ref&gt;

==International cricket==
Sophia Gardens has been an international cricket venue since 20 May 1999, when it played host to the [[1999 Cricket World Cup]] match between [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] and [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]]. From 2001 to 2012, the ground was a regular venue for [[One Day International]]s, hosting nine matches in 12 years, but it was not until 2006 that it hosted its first [[England cricket team|England]] match, the first match of the series against [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] on 30 August 2006. In 2012, the ground was named as one of three venues for the [[2013 ICC Champions Trophy]], along with [[The Oval]] and [[Edgbaston Cricket Ground|Edgbaston]]; it hosted five matches, including the opener between [[India national cricket team|India]] and [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]] on 6 June 2013, and the semi-final between India and [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]] on 20 June.&lt;ref name="champions"&gt;{{cite news |title=Glamorgan host more 2013 Champions Trophy games |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cricket/19324236 |publisher=BBC Sport (British Broadcasting Corporation) |date=21 August 2012 |accessdate=13 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ground also hosted two [[Twenty20 International]]s between England and Pakistan in September 2010, and it is due to host another against Australia in August 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ashes 2015: England and Australia open Test series in Cardiff |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cricket/27371063 |publisher=BBC Sport (British Broadcasting Corporation) |date=12 May 2014 |accessdate=13 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 April 2008, the [[England and Wales Cricket Board]] (ECB) announced that the venue would host a series of major Test matches over the next four years. It would host its first [[Test cricket|Test match]] on 8 July 2009 as the opening match of an [[The Ashes|Ashes]] series between England and Australia.&lt;ref name="glamorgancricket.com"&gt;[http://www.glamorgancricket.com/news_view.php?news_id=1277 SWALEC Stadium awarded more international cricket] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926165111/http://www.glamorgancricket.com/news_view.php?news_id=1277 |date=2008-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This made Sophia Gardens the 100th [[List of Test cricket grounds|Test match venue]]. In July 2011, the ECB stripped the ground of its right to host the 2012 [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] Test because of Glamorgan's late payment of the £2.5&amp;nbsp;million fee it owed for hosting the 2011 [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]] Test.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/other-sport/cricket-swalec-test-match-loss-1818970 Cricket: Swalec Test match loss is confirmed]&lt;/ref&gt; The ground was originally set to host a Test match against New Zealand in 2013, but this was given up in exchange for the 2013 Champions Trophy.&lt;ref name="champions"/&gt; The ground was chosen as the venue for the first Test of the [[2015 Ashes series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Trent Bridge to host Ashes Tests in 2013 and 2015 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cricket/15020210 |publisher=BBC Sport (British Broadcasting Corporation) |date=22 September 2011 |accessdate=13 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The £9.4&amp;nbsp;million cost to redevelop stadium was funded by with approximately half (£4.5&amp;nbsp;million) being provided in the form of a [[Cardiff Council]] loan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://icwales.icnetwork.co.uk/sports/cricket-news/2008/05/11/atherton-says-cardiff-ground-too-small-for-ashes-cricket-91466-20891059/ Atherton says Cardiff ground “too small” for Ashes cricket]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is possible that the revamped stadium could host seven Test matches, nine One Day Internationals and two [[Cricket World Cup|World Cup]] games up to 2028, injecting at least £50&amp;nbsp;million into the local economy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/4921718.stm Cardiff to host Ashes Test match]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/england/content/story/244931.html Cardiff to host Ashes Test in 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;  Construction of the redevelopment of Sophia Gardens began in April 2007,&lt;ref name="glamorgancricket.com"/&gt; and the redeveloped stadium was first opened for competitive matches on 9 May 2008, when the Glamorgan Dragons played the [[Gloucestershire County Cricket Club|Gloucestershire Gladiators]] in a [[Friends Provident Trophy]] match in which the Gladiators won by six wickets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://icwales.icnetwork.co.uk/sports/cricket-news/2008/05/10/cricket-gladiators-spoil-glamorgan-s-opening-night-party-91466-20889156/ Gladiators spoil Glamorgan’s opening-night party]&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
On 4 March 2008, Glamorgan Cricket Club announced a 10-year sponsorship deal with [[SWALEC]], thought to be the biggest single sponsorship by a county cricket club, giving SWALEC the naming rights to the new stadium, worth in excess of £1.5&amp;nbsp;million over 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/cricket/cricket-sophia-gardens-ground-renamed-2187086 Cricket: Sophia Gardens ground to be renamed Swalec Stadium]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In June 2015, ahead of the First Test of the [[2015 Ashes series]], the stadium was renamed as simply "The SSE SWALEC" in reflection of the ownership of sponsors SWALEC by [[SSE plc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Gareth |last=Griffiths |title=Glamorgan rename ground as The SSE SWALEC ahead of Ashes showdown between England and Australia |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/cricket/glamorgan-rename-ground-sse-swalec-9390996 |work=Wales Online |publisher=Media Wales |date=4 June 2015 |accessdate=5 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new logo from June 2015 was designed to reflect the shape of the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sse.com/newsandviews/allarticles/2015/06/new-name-for-wales-best-known-cricket-ground/ SSE]&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2018 the stadium officially reverted to its traditional name of Sophia Gardens following the end of the sponsorship deal.&lt;ref name=wo&gt;Booth, Dominic (30 April 2018) [https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/cricket/glamorgan-cricket-cardiff-ashes-swalec-14595449 Iconic Cardiff sporting venue renamed as sponsorship deal comes to an end], ''[[Wales Online]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2958">'''''The Darker Image''''' was the first all-[[African American|black]] female swimsuit [[wall calendar|calendar]] to break into mainstream bookstores across the United States, such as [[Barnes &amp; Noble]] and [[Waldenbooks]], in 1994-1997.&lt;ref name=lat94&gt;{{cite news|last=Aubry|first=Erin|title=Banking On a Recipe of Class and Cheesecake; Photographer Ken Townsend Breaks Ground by Getting the First Swimsuit Calendar Featuring Black Women into Major Bookstores|work=[[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=2004-10-10|page=E1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before [[King (magazine)|''King'']], [[Smooth (magazine)|''Smooth'']] and ''BlackMen'' magazines existed, black calendars such as ''The Darker Image'' were among the first to usher [[hip hop models]] into the mainstream print media (other than perhaps [[Jet (magazine)|''Jet'' magazine]]). ''The Darker Image'' was particularly well distributed and sat on shelves in [[Borders Group|Borders Books &amp; Music]] and Barnes &amp; Noble nationwide&lt;ref name=lat94 /&gt; and was featured on ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'', ''[[Extra (U.S. TV program)|Extra]]'', and ''[[The Jenny Jones Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Television show appearances can be viewed under the "Television" section under "Press" on the Darker Image website.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' quoted Barnes &amp; Noble calendar buyer Bill Costello as saying, "The market is crying out for it.  It's rare that you can say in the business, 'This is needed, there's nothing else like it.' In this case, it was true."&lt;ref name=lat94 /&gt; The Darker Image's distribution records for a minority-themed swimsuit calendar remain unbroken.

''The Darker Image'' calendar became a small part of the cultural zeitgeist of the time, particularly in the urban world, with the calendar prominently featured in John Singleton’s movie ''[[Higher Learning]]'', and [[The Hollywood Reporter]] writing: “‘Phat Beach,’ the first Hollywood beach blanket-type movie featuring blacks, has just wrapped principal photography.... Coolio and Paperboy will provide the rap tunes for the models from Darker Image '95 Swimsuit Calendar.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Parker|first=Donna|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|title=Leigh and Basinger goin' to 'Kansas City'|date=1995-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Darker Image'' calendar did not feature any big name models or actresses at the time, although many of the models in the calendar went on to impressive careers, including [[Traci Bingham]], [[Melissa De Sousa]], [[Amy Hunter]], and [[Mari Morrow]].&lt;ref&gt;Bingham, DeSousa, and Hunter appeared in the 1996 Darker Image Calendar; Morrow appeared in 1994 Darker Image Calendar.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Warrender Swim Centre''' &amp;ndash; traditionally known as '''Warrender Baths''' &amp;ndash; is a [[swimming pool]] and fitness complex in [[Marchmont]], [[Edinburgh]].

[[File:Warrender Baths, Edinburgh.JPG|thumb|Entrance to Warrender Baths]]
It consists of a pool {{convert|25|yd}} in length, a sauna, and an assortment of fitness equipment. It is notable for its [[Victorian architecture]] with bright interior and its old-fashioned poolside changing facilities. The baths enjoy category "B" [[listed building]] conservation status.&lt;ref&gt;Staff (19 March 1993) [http://data.historic-scotland.gov.uk/pls/htmldb/f?p=2200:15:0::::BUILDING:30607 Warrender baths, Thirlestane Road]  City of Edinburgh Council, Statutory List, Category B, Retrieved 21 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;


==History==
In 1886, some Edinburgh residents and members of the Bellahouston Private Baths Club, Glasgow, decided to build a swimming club in Edinburgh. Frank Y. Henderson therefore formed the Warrender Private Baths Club Limited which bought some land from Sir [[Sir George Warrender, 7th Baronet|George Warrender]], 6th Baronet,&lt;ref name = Gazetteer&gt;[http://www.scottish-places.info/features/featurefirst16889.html Gazetteer for Scotland - Warrender Swim Centre] Accessed 31 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and, using the local architect Robert Paterson, had the baths built.  The original cost was £11,000 and the baths were opened on Saturday 17 December 1887 by Sir George.&lt;ref name =WBC&gt;[http://www.swimwarrender.com/pages/43/Club_History.html Warrender Baths Club, History] Accessed 5 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =WBC2&gt;Gilmore, J., editor (1990) "A Hundred Years of Warrender Baths Club 1888-1988" Warrender Baths Club, Edinburgh {{ISBN|0-9516787-0-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warrender Baths differed from many similar facilities in Edinburgh in that they were originally built privately with the emphasis on fitness and leisure. Many of the city's comparable swimming pools were part of a much wider scheme to build public baths to promote cleanliness and hygiene amongst the working classes, who did not have routine access at the time to sanitation. Warrender Baths also sported a billiard room and a reading room.

Initially the facilities were a success, but by 1906 were no longer viable and were closed. They were bought by the city for £3000, where they joined the city's portfolio of similar pools. Periodically suffering further closure threats, they were refurbished in 2005&lt;ref name = Gazetteer/&gt; and are now secure.

The baths are home to the [[Warrender Baths Club]] which is said to be the oldest, most famous and most successful swimming club in Scotland.&lt;ref name =WBC/&gt;  [[David Wilkie (swimmer)|David Wilkie]] the Olympic gold medallist swimmer,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/wi/david-wilkie-1.html David Wilkie Biography] Accessed 5 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ellen King]] and [[Keri-Anne Payne]]&lt;ref&gt;Magnay, Jacqueline (29 December 2012) [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/9770763/Keri-Anne-Payne-considers-switching-to-the-pool-after-the-pain-of-fourth-at-London-Olympics.html Keri-Anne Payne considers switching to the pool after the pain of fourth at London Olympics] The Telegraph, Retrieved 24 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt; both silver Olympic medallists,  bronze medal Olympic swimmers [[Paul Easter]], [[Gordon Downie (swimmer)|Gordon Downie]] and [[Alan McClatchey]], bronze Paralympic medal winners George Simpson&lt;ref name = WBC/&gt; and [[Sean Fraser (swimmer)|Sean Fraser]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edinburghnews.scotsman.com/sport/London-calling-as-Fraser-nets.4481126.jp |title=London calling as Fraser nets bronze in 100m clash |work=[[Edinburgh Evening News]] |date=11 September 2008 |accessdate=2013-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Olympic finalist [[Jean McDowell]] swam and trained with Warrender Baths Club.&lt;ref name = WBC2/&gt;

In November 2009, a swimming customer at Warrender Swim Centre was hit with glass due to a glazing fault, resulting in an injury to his arm and requiring the closure of the centre as a precautionary measure to ensure the safety of customers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edinburghnews.scotsman.com/edinburgh/Pool-shut-after-glass-panel.5802126.jp Pool shut after glass panel falls on swimmer] 6 November 2009, Accessed 28 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The baths were opened again in June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edinburghleisure.co.uk/list-115 The wait over - Warrender swimming pool is open again!] 21 June 2010,  Accessed 28 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
