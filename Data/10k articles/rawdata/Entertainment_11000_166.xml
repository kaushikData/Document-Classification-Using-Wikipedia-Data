==Reception==

In 2008, ''4Players'' was one of the main reviewers of Atari's new game ''[[Alone in the Dark (2008 video game)|Alone in the Dark]]'' which were threatened with legal action after they gave the game a mediocre rating. ''4Players'' was accused of obtaining an illegal version of the game before it was released and Atari wanted to force ''4Players'' to pull the review from their webpage. At the same time Atari also cancelled an advertising campaign on the ''4Players'' website, which was interpreted as applying further pressure on the online portal. This garnered an enormous media echo nationally and internationally, which forced Atari to row back on its demands and both ''4Players'' and Atari were able to settle differences out of court.&lt;ref name="sue"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/digital/computerspiele-industrie-spieleriese-gibt-klein-bei-1.197319|title=Spieleriese gibt klein bei|language=German|accessdate=4 October 2016|author=Sarina Märschel|publisher=[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]|website=sueddeutsche.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kotaku"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5018149/legal-mess-over-euro-alone-in-the-dark-reviews-update|title=Legal Mess Over Euro Alone In The Dark Reviews|accessdate=4 October 2016|author=Luke Plunkett|publisher=[[Kotaku]]|website=kotaku.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spiegel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/spielzeug/per-anwalt-gegen-kritiken-spieleindustrie-setzt-fachpresse-unter-druck-a-561478.html|title=Spieleindustrie setzt Fachpresse unter Druck|language=German|accessdate=4 October 2016|author=Christian Stöcker|publisher=[[Spiegel Online]]|website=spiegel.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Animaniacs'''''|アニマニアックス|Animaniakkusu}} are a series of [[platform game|platform]] [[video game]]s developed by [[Konami]], based on the [[Animaniacs|hit animated series of the same name]]. Two games were developed featuring significantly different gameplay and storylines; one for [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]], and one for the [[Sega Mega Drive/Genesis]] and [[Game Boy]]. The SNES and Genesis versions were released in 1994, and the Game Boy version in 1995.

==Plot==
{{see also|List of Animaniacs characters}}
In the Genesis version, the Warner Siblings, [[Yakko, Wakko, and Dot]], decide to open up a hip pop culture shop in order to become closer to their favorite movie stars. To this end, they travel across various movie sets in the [[Warner Bros.]] studio lot in order to retrieve movie memorabilia to sell. However, once they collect all the memorabilia, [[Pinky and the Brain]] attempt to steal them in order to further their world domination plans.

In the SNES version, the Brain once again has another plan to conquer the world by deciding to steal the script of the new Warner Bros. film while it was under development. The CEO of Warner Bros. studio reluctantly asks the Warner Siblings for their assistance to retrieve all 24 pages of the script and foil the Brain's plan, which is the primary objective of the game.

==Gameplay==

===Genesis/Game Boy version===
The game features four main levels, which can be entered in any order. The player must reach the end of each level and beat the boss to obtain a piece of movie memorabilia. After clearing all four levels, players travel to the final level where they must fight [[Pinky and the Brain]]. Players control Yakko, Wakko, and Dot, switching control between them to use their respective powers accordingly. Yakko uses a paddleball to stun enemies, and is also able to push and pull objects such as crates. Wakko uses a mallet which can be used to hit switches, break certain objects and light fuses. Dot is able to blow kisses which, when used on certain characters, triggers certain actions needed to progress.

The Warner Brothers and Sister have health indicators and a number of lives. The lives can be increased by obtaining either 100 stars, or obtaining a small golden form of their faces. Their health is indicated by their faces on the top left of the screen. When they smile, they are healthy, but when they are looking either tired, unhappy, or weak, then they should find health soon (which is found in the forms of several forms of ice cream or sweets or other kinds of food). The levels are timed.

This version was ported to the Game Boy by [[Factor 5]], but due to space constraints, only three levels are present in this version and certain parts of the three levels are absent. Both the ''Science Fiction/Space Opera – Space Wars (Space Trucking)'' and nearly all of the final ''Action Movie – Once There Was A Man Named Oscar'' levels are absent from this version. On easy mode, the Game Boy version ends early, on the first three levels. On normal and hard modes, the Game Boy version continues after the player completes the first three levels, goes to ''Once There Was A Man Named Oscar'', and battles Pinky and the Brain.

===SNES version===
Players navigate the three characters through a three-dimensional playing field. The primary objective of the game is to collect 24 pages of a script, though the game can be completed without obtaining all of them.  The game focuses more on parodies of films at the different stages, that are once more based on different genres of movies.

The characters have no health bar, lives (the game ends when all the characters are defeated/captured, one by one) or special abilities. Characters can pick up and throw things as well as execute a dash move. If all three are together, they can also stack themselves up to reach higher platforms. A slot machine at the bottom of the screen is activated after obtaining a certain number of coins and can be used for a range of power ups, such as temporary invincibility or bringing back characters who were defeated or captured earlier.

Throughout the game, there are small robots with white block heads, red bodies and yellow appendages who work for Pinky and the Brain.

==Reception==
Reviewing the Genesis version, ''[[GamePro]]'' assessed that the game successfully appeals to the TV show's preadolescent target audience. They criticized the limited music and absence of voices, but praised the cartoony and detailed graphics and the way the level design requires the player to make regular use of all three characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=ProReview: Animaniacs|journal=[[GamePro]]|issue=75|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=December 1994|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; They gave the Super NES version a negative review, citing overly simplistic and frustrating gameplay, though they did praise the graphics for their large and colorful sprites and background references to the TV show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=ProReview: Animaniacs|journal=[[GamePro]]|issue=75|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=December 1994|page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing the Game Boy version, they criticized the slow-moving characters and trial-and-error gameplay, but approved of the graphics and audio and concluded, "The humor and spirit of the Animaniacs lives on in this handheld game."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Animaniacs|journal=[[GamePro]]|issue=83|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=August 1995|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Super Play'' was more negative on the SNES version, giving it only 28%&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/Superplay_Issue_26_1994-12_Future_Publishing_GB#page/n45/mode/2up&lt;/ref&gt;

''Digital Press'' gave the Genesis version 8 out of 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Hirsch|first=Howie|title= Random Reviews|url=https://archive.org/stream/Digital_Press_Issue_32_1997-06_Santulli_Joe_US#page/n19/mode/2up |magazine= Digital Press|page= 21|publisher= |date= June 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' reviewed the Genesis version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that "Cutting edge innovation isn't here, but what is here is plenty of fun."&lt;ref name="NG"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=|first=|title=Finals|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=2|publisher=[[Future US|Imagine Media]]|date=February 1995|page=99-100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arnolt Bronnen''' (19 August 1895 – 12 October 1959) was an [[Austria]]n [[playwright]] and [[Theatre director|director]].

==Life and career==
Bronnen was born in [[Vienna]], Austria. His father was Jewish and his mother was Christian.&lt;ref&gt;''The Menorah Journal'' 19 (1930) [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZpUWAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Arnolt+Bronnen%22+jewish+father&amp;dq=%22Arnolt+Bronnen%22+jewish+father&amp;hl=en&amp;redir_esc=y 170].&lt;/ref&gt; Bronnen's most famous play is the [[Expressionism (theatre)|Expressionist]] drama ''[[Parricide (play)|Parricide]]'' (''Vatermord'', 1922); its première production is notable, among other things, for being that from which Bronnen's friend, the young [[Bertolt Brecht]] in an early stage of his directing career, withdrew, after being taken to hospital with malnutrition and the actors of the cast, led by [[Heinrich George]], walked out on him.&lt;ref name="willett"&gt;Willett and Manheim (1970, viii) and Thomson (1994, 26).&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Cambridge Guide to Theatre'', the "erotic, anti-[[bourgeois]], black expressionism" of the play "caused a sensation" when it was eventually performed.

Bronnen also wrote ''[[Birth of Youth]]'' (''Geburt der Jugend'', 1922) and ''[[Die Excesse]]'' (1923).&lt;ref name="cgt"&gt;Banham (1998, 132).&lt;/ref&gt; After having collaborated on film treatments and various theatrical projects together, in 1923 Bronnen and Brecht co-directed a condensed version of ''Pastor Ephraim Magnus'' (a [[Nihilism|nihilistic]], Expressionist play, according to ''The Cambridge Guide'', "stuffed with [[Perversion|perversities]] and [[Sadism and masochism|sado-masochistic]] [[Motif (narrative)|motifs]]") by [[Hans Henny Jahnn]].&lt;ref name="cgtsacks"&gt;Banham (1998, 553), Sacks (1994, xviii), and Willett and Manheim (1970, viii).&lt;/ref&gt; Later in his life he wrote [[reportage plays]].&lt;ref name="cgt"/&gt;

Bronnen signed the [[Gelöbnis treuester Gefolgschaft]], a "vow of most faithful allegiance" to [[Adolf Hitler]] in 1933;&lt;ref name=letters&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7iC7BGIcvTQC&amp;pg=PA367 88 "writers"], from ''Letters of Heinrich and Thomas Mann, 1900-1949'', Weimar and Now: German Cultural Criticism 12, University of California Press 1998, {{ISBN|0-520-07278-2}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;367&amp;ndash;68.&lt;/ref&gt; after the [[World War II|Second World War]] he became a [[communist]].&lt;ref name="cgt"/&gt;

Bronnen died in [[East Berlin]] and is buried in the [[Dorotheenstadt cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (1980, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=vuiIUZKUCeOziQLv34G4BQ&amp;id=wHUaAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Taylor%2C+Literature+and+Society+in+Germany&amp;q=alongside+Heinrich+Mann#search_anchor 65]).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bangladesh Amateur Radio League''' ('''BARL''') is a national [[non-profit organization]] for [[amateur radio]] enthusiasts in [[Bangladesh]].  BARL is the national member society representing Bangladesh in the [[International Amateur Radio Union]], which it joined in 1982.&lt;ref name="iaru"&gt;International Amateur Radio Union (2008). [http://www.iaru.org/iaru-soc.html "Member Societies"].  Retrieved Aug. 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Amateur radio activities in [[East Pakistan]] were suspended during the war with [[India]] in 1965, and the ban on amateur radio activities remained in effect after Bangladesh achieved independence from [[Pakistan]] in 1971. The Bangladesh Amateur Radio League was founded on May 20, 1979 by radio enthusiasts and immediately began lobbying the government for approval of amateur radio operation in the country.  Efforts to legalize amateur radio in Bangladesh would not succeed until 1991, when a new [[democracy|democratically]] elected government faced a telecommunications emergency during a major [[cyclone]].  Persuaded of the value amateur radio could offer Bangladesh society, amateur radio was legalized in the country, with many restrictions, on August 29, 1991.&lt;ref name="barl_history"&gt;Bangladesh Amateur Radio League (2008). [http://www.barl.org/index.php?id=61 "A Brief History of Amateur Radio in Bangladesh "].  Retrieved Sep. 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Amateur radio license]] examinations and license grants were suspended by the government in 2004.  Representatives of the Bangladesh Amateur Radio League lobbied the [[Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission]] to reinstate the examinations and licensing process, which was resumed on August 13, 2008.&lt;ref name="BARL"&gt;American Amateur Radio League (2008).

== Governance ==
The 2014 Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the Bangladesh Amateur Radio League took place on August 22, 2014 at Dhaka.  Almost all of the members were present at the meeting, which concluded with elections of a new [[executive committee]].  Sumon Ahmed Sabir (S21SD) was elected President, Saiful Huda (S21SH) and Dr. Zahidul Haque (S21VA) were elected Vice Presidents, Rubyat Hasan Khan Ratul (S21RA) was elected General-Secretary, Sohrab Hossain Ivan (S21RV) was elected Assistant Secretary, and Mohammad Alam (S21AK) was elected Treasurer.  Members at Large include Ataul Hakim (S21AZ)[Silent Key] , Tanvir Ahmed (S21TA), Md. Rashidul Alam (S21RM), Md. Mukul Hossain (S21MB) and Syed Shamsul Alam (S21ED).

'''Circus Amok''' is a New York City-based circus and theater troupe that produces free outdoor performances every year in the NYC parks. Founded in 1989 by performance artist [[Jennifer Miller]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brooklynrail.org/2007/9/streets/political-circus-dazzles-brooklyn Political Circus Dazzles Brooklyn] by Marie Carter, September, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; who directs the company, the troupe began touring the city parks annually in 1994. The company performs in small neighborhood parks and well-traveled public squares in Brooklyn, the Bronx, Manhattan and Queens. Circus Amok's performances address various political themes and social justice issues, which in recent years have included housing, health care, [[gentrification]], [[gay marriage]], immigration, the Department of Homeland Security, [[police brutality]], and public education.&lt;ref name="timeout.com"&gt;[http://www.timeout.com/newyork/article/4705/juggler-vein Juggler Vein: Circus Amok Puts Politics in the Center Ring]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} by Lawrence Ferber, August 31-September 6, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

[[Image:Charleston rhythm.png|thumb|"[[Charleston (song)|Charleston]]" rhythm, simple rhythm commonly used in comping.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes (2002), p.6.&lt;/ref&gt; {{audio|Charleston_rhythm.mid|Play example}}]]

'''Comping''' (an abbreviation of [[accompaniment|accompanying]]; or possibly from the verb, to "complement") is the [[jazz harmony|chords]], [[rhythm]]s, and [[countermelody|countermelodies]] that keyboard players ([[piano]] or organ), [[guitar]] players, or drummers use to support a [[jazz]] musician's [[musical improvisation|improvised]] [[solo (music)|solo]] or [[melody]] lines. It is also the action of accompanying, and the left-hand part of a solo pianist.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Fred (2002). ''The Jazz Pianist: Left Hand Voicings and Chord Theory'', p.5. {{ISBN|9780757993152}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term ''comping'' is also an abbreviation of compiling, whereby the best sections of several takes are "comped" into one track. &lt;ref&gt;Lesa Soundz, 4 Sound Engineers, http://www.4soundengineers.com/what-is-comping-the-audio-editing-technique-all-engineers-should-know/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
In a standard jazz combo, the [[pianist]] or [[guitarist]] typically comps during the [[horn section|horn]] and [[double bass]] solos by improvising [[chord (music)|chord]]s and [[counter-melody|countermelodies]].

The chordal accompaniment used in jazz is different from the chordal accompaniment style used in many types of [[popular music]], such as rock and folk.
*In a '''rock or folk band''', a guitarist or piano player will accompany by playing primarily [[root-position]] [[triad (music)|triads]] consisting of the notes of the chord known as the [[root (chord)|root]], [[third (chord)|3rd]], and [[fifth (chord)|5th]]. In the key of C, the G chord would include the notes G, B, and D (the root, 3rd, and 5th of the chord). In a [[hard rock]] or [[heavy metal music]] band, a guitarist often comps by playing [[power chord]]s (root, fifth and octave, or for fast chord changes, just root and fifth).
* In a '''jazz band''' a guitarist or pianist will comp by playing a variety of chords that include the notes of the chord known as the 3rd, [[seventh (chord)|7th]], [[ninth (chord)|9th]], and [[thirteenth (chord)|13th]] (jazz chord players often omit the root, because the [[bass (chord)|bassist]] usually plays the root. The fifth of the chord is also omitted, except when the fifth is flattened or sharpened). In the key of C, the G7 chord in a jazz context might be performed by playing the notes B, E, F, and A (the 3rd, 13th, flat 7th, and 9th notes of the chord). As well, jazz compers may use [[altered chord]]s that contain flattened or sharpened 5ths, sharp 11ths, flat or sharpened 9ths, and flat 13ths for some songs or soloists. For example, an [[altered dominant|altered]] G7 chord might be played with a basic [[voicing (music)|voicing]], often the 3rd (B) and 7th (F), along with some of the following notes A{{music|b}}, A{{music|#}}, C{{music|#}}, and E{{music|b}} ({{music|b}}9, {{music|#}}9, {{music|#}}11, {{music|b}}13), subject to the taste and style of the performer and/or the bandleader.

In combos with a guitar player, the guitar player usually comps for soloists.  If there is both a pianist and a guitarist, as sometimes occurs in [[organ trio]]s or [[big band]]s, they may either alternate comping or comp at the same time.  Having two chordal instruments comp at the same time is difficult to do well. The two compers may make different, clashing interpretations of the same chord (e.g., the pianist may add a flat 13th, while the guitarist plays a natural 13th), or the texture may become overly cluttered. This may also result in a fight between the pianist and guitarist. One solution is for the two comping instrumentalists to play sparsely.
===Chords===
Comping is almost always improvised by the comping musicians based on a [[chord chart]], [[lead sheet]] (which contains the chords written above the melody), [[sheet music]], or, in [[country music]], the [[Nashville number system]]. The exception is well-known progressions (e.g., [[12 bar blues]]) and [[jazz standard]]s such as "[[I've Got Rhythm]]", known colloquially as "Rhythm Changes". For well-known progressions, the bandleader may simply say "solos on blues changes" or "solos on Rhythm Changes", and the comping musicians are expected to be familiar with these chord progressions. Top soloists playing with the most advanced comping musicians may simply call out the name of jazz standards, and the sidemen will be expected to know the chord progression. For example, the soloist may request "[[Autumn Leaves (1945 song)|Autumn Leaves]]" without providing the compers with a chord chart or sheet music. The compers at the highest professional level would be expected to know this tune.

Since there are many variant versions of these chord progressions, the comping musicians will have to come to an unspoken consensus on which chords to use. For example, there are many different [[Turnaround (music)|turnaround]]s used for the last two bars of a 12 bar blues; however, if the bandleader, playing Hammond organ, plays I/VI7/ii7/V7 for the turnaround, most skilled compers will hear these chords by ear and then replicate them in subsequent choruses (each full playing of the 12-bar progression is colloquially called a "chorus").

===Drums===
During [[Swing (jazz performance style)|swing]]-feel songs, [[drummer]]s will usually comp with one hand on the [[snare drum]] while playing time on the [[cymbal]]s, typically on the [[ride cymbal]] (see [[drum kit]]). More skilled drummers often comp with even all three limbs excluding their right-hand ride pattern (snare drum, [[bass drum]], [[Hi-hat (instrument)|hi-hats]]). They will most likely develop the simple jazz drum pattern and add a few "bomb" bass drum notes for extra effect. 
===Horns===
In small jazz ensembles ("combos") with more unusual instrumentation, horn players (e.g., saxophone, trumpet, etc.) can comp by playing the melody line in the background, or by playing a sequence of notes called "[[guide tone]]s" which outline the harmonic framework. Guide tones are usually the 3rd, 7th, or 9th notes of a given chord.  Guide tone lines are constructed by descending (or ascending) through the guide tones of the chart, normally by semitone or tone.  For instance, in a duo for [[saxophone]] and bass, the saxophonist might comp during the bass solo by playing guide tones. 

For example, during the standard jazz chord progression ii7/V7/I/VI7 (in the key of C Major, this would be d minor 7/G7/C/A7), a horn player might play the guide tones, in whole notes, C (minor 7th of d minor), B (third of G7), A (sixth of C; sixths are added to major chords and dominant seventh chords in jazz even when not specified) and G (minor 7th of A7). This is only one possible guide tone sequence. A second guide tone sequence (in whole notes) might be F (minor third of d minor), E (sixth of G7), D (ninth of C Major; as with sixths, ninths are often added to chord voicings even when not indicated), C# (major third of A7).
===Drum solo===
During a [[drum]] solo, the entire band may tacet (called "laying out" in jazz slang). Alternatively, the pianist (and possibly the bassist and/or guitarist or organist) sometimes comps, often using a predictable pattern of rhythmically played chords called "hits". A well-known example is the second half of "[[Take Five]]", with [[Dave Brubeck]]'s piano [[vamp (music)|vamp]] comping for [[Joe Morello]]'s drum solo. During piano solos, pianists often comp for themselves, playing melodic lines and solos with the right hand while comping with the left hand.

==Roles ==
While any jazz instrument can be used for comping, the chordal rhythm section instruments (piano, organ, and guitar) have developed the largest collection of pedagogical materials about comping. Since a jazz soloist has such wide-ranging harmonic, melodic, and rhythmic possibilities, chordal instrumentalists must have a similarly wide range of tools at their disposal to support the soloist properly.

Comping musicians must know many different types of [[chord voicing]]s so that they can match the mood the soloist is trying to create. To support some soloists, a comper needs to use very simple voicings (such as the 3rd and 7th of a chord). However, for other soloists who play in a very dense, complicated style, compers may need to use chords with many additional extensions, such as 9ths, 13ths, and altered voicings; they may also [[harmonization|re-harmonize]] [[chord progression]]s depending on the soloist, thus creating a feedback of idea exchange between the soloist and the comper. For the most sophisticated soloists, a comper may need to be able to respond in real time to newly improvised implied chord changes.

Compers must have an understanding of rhythm that allows them to respond to the rhythms and beat patterns the soloist plays, such as Latin or Afro-Cuban rhythms. As well, they must have a melodic sense based on a knowledge of a huge repertoire of different scales and scalar patterns, to be able to improvise countermelodies to supplement the soloist's melodies and fill in empty spaces.

By comping, pianists, organists, and guitarists provide the "glue" that holds the rhythm section together. They take the soloist's improvised solos and melodies and add harmonies (as a bass player does) and rhythms (as a drummer does). By doing this, the comper helps ensure that the band is always at the same energy level as the soloist. [[Wynton Kelly]] and [[Herbie Hancock]] are examples of pianists who are responsive when comping. [[Oscar Peterson]] usually comped busily, while [[Count Basie]] comped sparsely. There is no single appropriate way to comp for a soloist. 
===Adapting to soloist===
A comper adapts his or her style to that of the soloist. In a jazz band with multiple soloists, this may require different styles for different soloists. For example, the saxophone player in a band may imply many extensions and altered chords in his soloing (e.g., b9, b13, etc.). For this soloist, a comper may decide to play [[altered dominant]]s and dense harmonies. The next soloist, a [[jazz guitarist]], may play sparse, delicate melody lines, with lots of space. For this soloist, the comper may use open voicings, omit passing chords, and try to play mainly in the space left by the soloist. If a soloist starts implying a certain style or feel in his solo, whether this is Afro-Cuban music or hard-driving swing, the entire rhythm section may shift to this style to support him.

In a tune, if a soloist starts playing in a [[jazz fusion|jazz-rock fusion]] style, the comping musicians may adapt and shift into a rock-influenced groove. A guitarist who is comping may turn on an [[distortion (music)|overdrive]] pedal to add [[rock music]]-style "growl" to his tone. A guitarist may also use other [[effects unit]]s, such as a [[chorus effect]]. A keyboardist playing [[Fender Rhodes]] [[electric piano]] or [[Hammond organ]] may turn up his [[preamplifier]] to produce a natural tube overdrive tone for his sound. A drummer may shift to a rock style of drumming.

===Soloing===
In all but the largest [[big band]]s, the comping sidemen in a jazz show are often called upon by the [[bandleader]] to improvise a solo. Here, the comper takes centre stage and performs an improvised melody line. For 1920s [[Dixieland]] and some [[Swing era]] jazz, the comper may embellish the melody line and improvise by ear during his solo. For [[Bebop]]-style groups, the comper playing a solo will often base his improvisations on the [[chord progression]] of the song. Bebop tunes often have one, two or even three chord changes per bar and some tunes change keys every few bars; as such, it is hard to solo "by ear" on a Bebop song.

The '''Digi-Comp II''' was a toy computer invented by John Thomas Godfrey&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/lsj/obituary.aspx?n=john-thomas-godfrey-jack&amp;pid=134332357&lt;/ref&gt; and manufactured by [[E.S.R., Inc.]] that used {{convert|1/2|in|mm|round=0.5}} [[marble (toy)|marble]]s rolling down a ramp to perform basic calculations.  A two-level [[masonite]] platform with guides served as the medium for a supply of marbles that rolled down an inclined plane moving plastic cams as they went.  The plastic cams played the part of [[Flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flops]] in an electronic computer - as a marble passed one of the cams, it would flip the cam around - in one position, the cam would allow the marble to pass in one direction, in the other position, it would cause the marble to drop through a hole and roll to the bottom of the ramp. The Digi-Comp II platform measures {{convert|14 &amp;times; 28.5|in|cm}}.&lt;ref name=dc2bshop/&gt;

The Digi-Comp II was not programmable, unlike the [[Digi-Comp I]], an earlier offering in the E.S.R. product line that used an assortment of plastic slides, tubes, and bent metal wires to solve simple logic problems.

== Computational power ==
Computer scientist [[Scott Aaronson]] analyzed the computational power of the Digi-Comp II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=1902|title=The Power of the Digi-Comp II|last=Aaronson|first=Scott|authorlink=Scott Aaronson|date=4 July 2014|website=Shtetl-Optimized|accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several ways to [[Mathematical model|mathematically model]] the device's computational capabilities. A natural abstraction is a [[directed acyclic graph]] in which each internal vertex has an out-degree of 2, representing a toggle cam that routes balls to one of two other vertices. A fixed number of balls are placed at a designated source vertex, and the [[decision problem]] is to determine whether any balls ever reach a designated sink vertex. Aaronson showed that this decision problem, given as inputs a description of the DAG and the number of balls to run (encoded in [[Unary numeral system|unary]]), is [[complete (complexity)|complete]] under [[log-space reduction]] for [[CC (complexity)|CC]], the class of problems log-space reducible to the [[stable marriage problem]]. He also showed that the variant of the problem in which the number of balls is encoded in [[Binary number|binary]], allowing the machine to run for an exponentially longer time, is still in [[P (complexity)|P]].

== Reproductions ==
A slightly downscaled reproduction of the Digi-Comp II, made from [[plywood]], is available from Evil Mad Scientist. This reproduction uses {{convert|11|mm|in|abbr=on|frac=16}} steel pachinko balls, and measures {{convert|10 &amp;times; 24|in|cm}}.&lt;ref name=dc2bshop&gt;{{cite web|title=Digi-Comp II: First Edition|url=https://shop.evilmadscientist.com/tinykitlist/637|website=Evil Mad Scientists (Shop)|accessdate=12 February 2018|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Oskay|first1=Windell|title=The Making of the Digi-Comp II, First Edition|publisher=Evil Mad Scientist Laboratories|url=https://www.evilmadscientist.com/2013/makingdciife/|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evil Mad Scientist also created a giant variant measuring around {{convert|4 &amp;times; 8|ft|m|1}} in size that uses [[billiard ball]]s. The [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]'s Stata Center houses one copy of the giant version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DigiComp II|url=https://cel60celebration.mit.edu/digicomp-ii|website=Cel 60 Celebration|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Envy''''' (Russian: ''Зависть'') is a novel published in [[1927 in literature|1927]] by the Russian novelist [[Yuri Olesha]]. It is remarkable for its poetic style, undulating modes of transition between the scenes, innovative structure, biting satire, and ruthless examination of Socialist ideals.

== Plot summary ==

The novel is about a pathetic young man named Nikolai Kavalerov, who refuses to accept Communist values and is consumed by loathing and envy for his benefactor Andrei Babichev, a model Soviet citizen who manages a successful [[sausage]] factory. With Andrei Babichev's brother Ivan, Kavalerov attempts to stage a comeback of all the old, petty feelings that were crushed under communism. In the end, Ivan and Kavalerov are crushed by their own iniquity.

==Publication History==
"Envy" first appeared in [[Red Virgin Soil]], a Soviet literary magazine, in late 1927. Olesha wrote the novel while working at the "Whistle", a widely read newspaper of the Railway Workers' Union. He read pages of the novel to other notable Soviet writers: [[Mikhail Bulgakov]], [[Isaac Babel]], [[Ilya Ilf]], and [[Yevgeny Petrov (writer)|Yevgeny Petrov]].

An '''ethnographic film''' is a non-fiction film, often similar to a documentary film, historically dealing with non-Western people, and sometimes associated with anthropology.

==Origins==
Prospector, explorer, and eventual filmmaker [[Robert J. Flaherty]] is considered to be the forefather of ethnographic film. He is most famous for his 1922 film ''[[Nanook of the North]]''. Flaherty's attempts to realistically portray Inuit people were valuable pictures of a little-known way of life. Flaherty was not trained in anthropology, but he did have good relationships with his subjects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cinemaweb.com/silentfilm/bookshelf/23_rf1_2.htm Flaherty, Richard. "How I filmed Nanook of the North,"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The contribution of Felix-Louis Regnault may have started the movement. He was filming a Wolof woman making pottery without the aid of a wheel at the Exposition Ethnographique de l'Afrique Occidentale. He published his findings in 1895. His later films followed the same subject, described to capture the "cross cultural study of movement." He later proposed the creation of an archive of anthropological research footage.

The Cambridge Anthropological Expedition to the Torres Straits, initiated by Alfred Cort Haddon in 1898, covered all aspects of Torres Straits life. Haddon wrote to his friend Baldwin Spencer recommending he use film for recording evidence. Spencer then recorded the Australian Aborigines, a project that consisted of 7,000 feet of film, later housed in the National Museum at Victoria.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bIor21FBXWEC&amp;pg=PA13#v=onepage&amp;q=ethnographic%20film]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, [[Gregory Bateson]] and [[Margaret Mead]] discovered that using film frame-by-frame was an essential component of documenting complex rituals in Bali and New Guinea. [[John Marshall (filmmaker)|John Marshall]] made what is likely the most-viewed ethnographic film in American colleges (''[[The Hunters (1957 film)|The Hunters]]''),&lt;ref&gt;university catalog counts&lt;/ref&gt; his filming of the Ju/'hoansi of the Kalahari (the !Kung-San) that spans from 1951 to 2000. His ethnographic film ''[[N!ai, the Story of a !Kung Woman]]'' is not only ethnography but also a biography of the central character, N!ai, incorporating footage from her childhood through adulthood. Marshall ended his career with a five-part series, ''A Kalahari Family'' (2004), that critically examined his fifty-year involvement with the Ju/'hoansi. [[Napoleon Chagnon]] and [[Tim Asch]]'s two famous films, ''[[The Ax Fight]]'' and ''The Feast'' (both filmed in the 1960s), are intimately documented ethnographic accounts of an Amazonian rainforest people, the [[Ya̧nomamö|Yanomamo]].

The genre flourished in France in the fifties due to the role of ethnographers as [[Marcel Griaule]], [[Germaine Dieterlen]], and [[Jean Rouch]]. Light [[16 mm film|16 mm]] cameras synchronized with light tape-recorders would re-evolutionise the methods of both cinema and anthropology.

Rouch, who has developed the concept in theory and practice, went against the dogma that in research the camera person must stay out of the event or distance him/herself as an observer. He decided to make the camera interfere and became an actor, developing and popularizing [[Cinéma vérité]]. This was of course earlier deemed the "[[Observer-expectancy effect|observer effect]]" by Gregory Bateson,{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} who was perhaps unaware of the dogma Rouch was attempting to violate. Bateson, as one of the earliest to write about using cameras in the studies of humans, was not only aware of the observer effect, but both he and his partner, Margaret Mead, wrote about many ways of dealing theoretically and practically with that effect.&lt;ref&gt;Bateson, Gregory. ''Naven'', Cambridge, 1936. Mead, Margaret. "Letters from the Field." 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Gardner, a film artist, collaborated with several anthropologists (Karl Heider among them) to produce ''Dead Birds'' (1964), a study of ritual warfare among the Dani of New Guinea ). [[David Maybury-Lewis]] was among the first to receive enough funding to send many video cameras into the field in a single field setting to gain multiple simultaneous points of view. In the 1970s, Judith and David MacDougall introduced subtitling their subjects' speech and went on to make films that involved more collaborative relationships with their subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David MacDougall|url=http://www.berkeleymedia.com/catalog/berkeleymedia/producers/david_macdougall|work=Berkeley Media|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==
Although ethnographic film can be seen as a way of presenting and understanding different cultures that is not normally seen, there are some issues in the case of portrayal. As of late, ethnographic film has been influenced by ideas of observational cinema similar to the British Free Cinema movement. 
The arrival of lightweight sound cameras and their accessories opened up possibilities of being able to film almost everywhere. This led to revealing private and informal behaviours to already discreet film-makers. 
The issue of presentation was noted by Flaherty, when he realized that when the audience is shown individuals dealing with problems, it helps them affirm the rationality of their own choices.
Despite new lightweight camera equipment, the status of the camera was still seen as an invisible presence. This only led to undermine the idea of film being an disembodied observer. It was later realized that the procedure of filming could carry false interpretations of the behaviour recorded. Film-makers then had new intentions for their films to be self-revelatory, making sure to film the primary encounter as evidence of their production.
An example of this would be ''Chronique d'un éte'', a film by Rouch and Morin where it touched on questions about how film deals with reality and changed the course of ethnographic film-making. Due to the difficulty of film being a direct representation of the subject, film-makers then perceived their work as a venture of the complexities of the presented cultural, or their work as a continuing inquiry.
However, the camera continues to see selectively. This means leaving the film-maker with the precaution of interpretation during the process of recording. While observing informal events, a technique of filming from different angles or shooting the scene more than once has been developed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/2155700]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many ethnographic films include recorded speech by people in the community being filmed. When this speech is in a language unfamiliar to the intended audience of the ethnographic film, the producers generally use voice over translation or subtitles. However, it has been shown that these translations of the film's subjects to the film's audience have not always been accurate. In the film ''Spirits of Defiance: The Mangbetu People of Zaire'' about the Mangbetu people of the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], Robert McKee has shown that the subtitles can not only leave out part of what is said, but at times even change what is said to support the point of view of the film's producers.&lt;ref&gt;McKee, Robert Guy. 2017. Film-maker ventriloquism in ethnographic film: Where subtitles don’t let subjects “speak for themselves”. ''GIALens'' Volume 11, No. 1: 1-27. [http://www.gial.edu/documents/gialens/Vol11-1/McKee-Film-Maker-Ventriloquism.pdf Online access]&lt;/ref&gt; Timothy Asch has set out ethical principles for producers of ethnographic films to ensure that communities being filmed have input into how they are portrayed.&lt;ref&gt;Asch, Timothy. 1992. The ethics of ethnographic film-making. In Peter Ian Crawford &amp; David Turton (eds.), ''Film as ethnography'' 196-204. New York: Manchester University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Great American Songbook Foundation''' is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to the preservation and promotion of the music of the [[Great American Songbook]]. Located on the campus of the Center for the Performing Arts in [[Carmel, Indiana]], the Songbook Foundation's administrative offices are located on the Gallery level of the [[The Palladium at the Center for Performing Arts|Palladium]], a 1600-seat concert hall that opened in January 2011. The organization was previously known as the Michael Feinstein Foundation for the Education and Preservation of the Great American Songbook and the Michael Feinstein Great American Songbook Initiative; in July 2014, the organization's board of directors voted to change its name to the Great American Songbook Foundation.

== History and operation ==

[[Michael Feinstein|Michael Feinstein's]] lifetime interest in, and immense knowledge of, the music of the [[Great American Songbook]] led him to found the organization in 2007. Upon Feinstein's appointment as Artistic Director of [[The Palladium at the Center for Performing Arts|the Center for the Performing Arts]] in 2009, the organization committed to locating its headquarters and archives on the Center's campus in Carmel, Indiana.&lt;ref&gt;Jay Handelman, "Behind the Scenes: Feinstein Works to Preserve Classic Music", ''Herald-Tribune'' Sunday, March 31, 2013, retrieved from http://arts.heraldtribune.com/2013-03-31/featured/behind-the-scenes-feinstein-works-to-preserve-classic-music/.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Great American Songbook Foundation's administrative headquarters houses a reference library, study and listening rooms for researchers, archival storage space, and the Songbook Exhibit Gallery, an exhibit space featuring rotating interactive presentations about the music, its creators and the performers of the Great American Songbook.&lt;ref&gt;Joel Henning, "A Cultural Conversation with Michael Feinstein: Saving the Songbook", ''Wall Street Journal'', Feb. 2, 2012, retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/919205138&lt;/ref&gt; The long-term goal of the Great American Songbook Foundation is to construct a free-standing museum on the campus of the Center with additional exhibit, instructional, and programming space.

The Great American Songbook Foundation is staffed by four full-time employees. They are assisted by a volunteer group of docents who serve as guides for the Songbook Exhibit Gallery and a team of collections assistants who assist the archivist with the Songbook Foundation's ongoing preservation efforts. The Songbook Foundation's national board of directors currently has twenty-two members.

== Education and outreach ==
The Great American Songbook Foundation offers a variety of programs about the history and significance of the Great American Songbook that are accessible to the public and appeal to music enthusiasts of all ages.

=== Songbook Exhibit Gallery ===
[[File:Songbook Gallery- Blast From the Past.jpg|thumbnail|right|The Songbook Exhibit Gallery is located in the Foundation's administrative headquarters in Carmel, Indiana.]]
The Songbook Exhibit Gallery features rotating exhibits and welcomes over 3500 visitors each year. These rotating exhibits provide guests with a view of the Songbook that is both educational and entertaining, and helps them to place the music of this era in context with the significant events and major cultural shifts that occurred in the United States during the twentieth century. The Songbook Foundation offers corresponding educational programs and guided tours for school groups, civic and professional organizations, and members of the general public. The Songbook Gallery is open Monday through Friday from 10:00am to 4:00pm, and one hour before all Jazz and Songbook Series performances at the Palladium.

Since 2011, the Songbook Foundation has presented the following exhibits: "The Great American Songbook" (2011), "G.I. Jive: The Music and Entertainers of World War II" (2012), "Blast from the Past: Roaring Hot '20s Jazz" (2013), "A Change Is Gonna Come: 1960s Broadway Musicals" (2014), "Gus Kahn: The Man Behind the Music" (2015), and "The Great Indiana Songbook: Two Centuries of Hoosier Music" (2016).  The exhibit now on display is "Ella Sings the Songbook", celebrating [[Ella Fitzgerald]]'s 100th birthday and commemorating her more than fifty-year career, much of which was spent performing music from the Great American Songbook.  In particular, the exhibit highlights the series of eight albums of Songbook music sung by Ella under the direction of [[Norman Granz]] and issued by [[Verve Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.indystar.com/story/entertainment/music/2017/01/19/ella-fitzgerald-centennial-carmel-indiana-palladium-songbook-verve-feinstein/96776082/|title=Carmel exhibit celebrates Ella Fitzgerald centennial|last=Lindquist|first=David|date=January 19, 2017|newspaper=Indianapolis Star|access-date=2017-02-22|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|work=|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These exhibits focus on different time periods, styles, and artists.&lt;ref&gt;Jay Handelman, "Behind the Scenes", 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the interactive display which houses clips and short biographies of over four decades of singers and songwriters,  artifacts from the Songbook Archives that relate to the music and musicians being highlighted in the Songbook Gallery exhibits are displayed.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Grossberg, "Archive Promotes Classic American Songs", ''The Columbus Dispatch'' Sunday April 21, 2013, retrieved from http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/travel/2013/04/21/1-archive-promotes-classic-american-songs.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the Great American Songbook Foundation partnered with four other institutions to form the Exhibit Alliance, a group of organizations that presented concurrent exhibits on the 1960s. The Exhibit Alliance continues to grow and now includes the Great American Songbook Foundation, the [[Indiana Historical Society]], the [[Kurt Vonnegut Memorial Library]], the [[Indianapolis Public Library]], the Carmel-Clay Historical Society and the Carmel-Clay Public Library.

=== Songbook Academy® Summer Intensive ===
[[File:2014 Songbook Academy.jpg|thumbnail|left|Songbook Academy founder [[Michael Feinstein]] and Grammy-winner [[Cheryl Bentyne]] of [[The Manhattan Transfer]] coaching participants in the 2014 Songbook Academy]]
The Songbook Academy Summer Intensive, formerly known as the High School Vocal Academy and Competition, originated in 2009 and is held annually in July. The program is "the only vocal competition based solely on music from Broadway, Hollywood musicals and the Tin Pan Alley era."&lt;ref&gt;Joel Henning, "A Cultural Conversation", 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the past several years, the scope and visibility of the program has grown significantly. The competition initially involved only Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan and Ohio; Iowa and Wisconsin were added the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Joel Henning, "A Cultural Conversation", 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Chris Lewis, an educator and musician, joined as director, and four additional states were added.&lt;ref&gt;Joel Henning, "A Cultural Conversation", 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the number of states doubled to twenty-two.&lt;ref&gt;"High School Vocalists Compete at Songbook Finals", ''Current in Fishers'', July 17, 2013, retrieved from http://currentinfishers.com/high-school-vocalists-compete-at-songbook-finals.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Songbook Academy continued expanding its national reach in 2014 with the addition of nine states, for a total of thirty-one states and six regional competition events.

Following the 2014 Songbook Academy, the regional component of the audition process was eliminated; in 2015, forty young singers were invited to Carmel for the Songbook Academy week (previously, only the top two winners from each region were invited). Judges and mentors for 2017 included program founder [[Michael Feinstein]], broadway actress and singer [[Eden Espinosa]], jazz singer and educator Ly Wilder, television writer and producer [[Marc Cherry]], and internationally renowned soprano [[Sylvia McNair]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecenterfortheperformingarts.org/Great-American-Songbook-Inititative/Annual-Competition/2013-Judges Thecenterfortheperformingarts.org Retrieved 21 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In past years, prominent artists including [[Laura Osnes]], [[Jarrod Spector]], [[Sandi Patty]], [[Jane Monheit]], [[Janis Siegel]], and Jim Caruso have served as mentors for the program. The Songbook Academy accepts applications from high school students in all forty-eight contiguous states. The week culminates in a mainstage performance at the Palladium where three participants receive the following awards: the Songbook Inspiration Award, the Songbook Celebration Award, and the title of Great American Songbook Youth Ambassador.

Recent Songbook Academy finalists have performed in major venues in Las Vegas, Pasadena, New York City, Costa Mesa, Washington, D.C., San Francisco, and with Michael Feinstein in his appearances throughout the nation. Julia Goodwin, the winner in 2013, was featured with [[Darren Criss]], [[Kelli O'Hara]], and [[Aaron Tveit]] on Feinstein's ''New Years Eve at the Rainbow Room'' special, which was nationally broadcast on [[PBS]] in 2014. In September 2015, Nick Ziobro, Julia Goodwin, Maddie Baillio, and Lucas DeBard performed with the American Pops Orchestra on the Millennium Stage at the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]]. These singers also joined Feinstein onstage at New York City's [[Carnegie Hall]] in February 2016. In June 2016, Maddie Baillio was cast as Tracy Turnblad in NBC's production of ''Hairspray Live!''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.playbill.com/article/see-who-hairspray-live-chose-as-the-new-tracy-turnblad&lt;/ref&gt; On July 23, 2016, seventeen year old Finn Sagal of La Canada Flintridge, California was named the 2017 Songbook Youth Ambassador at the conclusion of the Songbook Academy Finals, which is held annually at the Palladium in [[Carmel, Indiana]].

=== Songbook Hall of Fame ===
[[File:Songbook Hall of Fame exhibit- landscape.JPG|thumbnail|right|The Great American Songbook Hall of Fame exhibit is housed in the Shiel Sexton Songbook Lounge at The Palladium.]]
The Great American Songbook Hall of Fame is a tribute to people who have contributed to the genre, memorializing composers, performers, and lyricists who have added to the history of the Songbook.&lt;ref&gt;"Songbook Hall of Fame Names 2013 Honorees", ''The Indianapolis Recorder'' May 14, 2013, retrieved from http://www.indianapolisrecorder.com/aroundtown/article_76b47d2a-bcb9-11e2-bd51-0019bb2963f4.html.&lt;/ref&gt; Artists are nominated and selected based on the following criteria:
* Artists who made a significant contribution to the Golden Age of American popular music, typically defined as the period from the early years of the Twentieth century through the 1960s;
* Living songwriters, both lyricists and composers, who have made a significant impact on American pop culture by creating the most beloved songs from the American popular songbook; and
* Artists, songwriters and/or performers who continues to create the soundtrack of our lives by writing and/or performing music that will become the pop standards of tomorrow."&lt;ref&gt;"Songbook Hall of Fame Names 2013 Honorees", 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year, the Center for the Performing Arts hosts the Songbook Celebration Gala, a black-tie event that celebrates the lives and careers of the artists who have been selected for induction into the Great American Songbook Hall of Fame. Nominees (or their representatives, in the case of posthumous award winners) are invited to Carmel where they are honored with tribute performances celebrating their achievements. Tribute performers at past Songbook Celebration Gala events include [[Jimmy Smits]], [[Andrea McArdle]], [[Jessica Sanchez]], [[Laura Osnes]], [[Karen Ziemba]], [[Chris Mann (singer)|Chris Mann]], and [[Kristin Chenoweth]].

Great American Songbook Hall of Fame Inductees include [[Alan Bergman|Alan]] &amp; [[Marilyn Bergman]], [[Barry Manilow]], and [[Cole Porter]] (2012); [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Rita Moreno]], [[Frank Sinatra]], and [[Jimmy Webb]] (2013); [[Nat King Cole]], [[Shirley Jones]], [[Johnny Mathis]], and [[Linda Ronstadt]] (2014); [[George Gershwin|George]] &amp; [[Ira Gershwin]], [[Chita Rivera]], and [[Steve Lawrence]] &amp; [[Eydie Gormé]] (2015); and [[Hoagy Carmichael]], [[Diahann Carroll]], and [[Dionne Warwick]] (2016).

=== GRAMMY Museum Cultural Affiliation ===
In July 2017, the Los Angeles-based [[GRAMMY Museum]] announced that the Great American Songbook Foundation has been designated as a Cultural Affiliate, joining four other institutions worldwide: the [[Bob Marley Museum]] in Kingston, Jamaica; the [[Woody Guthrie Center]] in Tulsa, OH; [[The Beatles Story]] in Liverpool, UK; and the [[National Blues Museum]] in St. Louis, MO.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.indystar.com/story/entertainment/arts/2017/07/19/grammy-museum-adds-carmels-great-american-songbook-foundation-elite-group/491631001/&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship will allow collaboration between the organizations on exhibits and educational and research programs, among other amenities.

=== Perfect Harmony Music Program ===
Founded in 2015, the Foundation's Perfect Harmony program offers music experiences to people with Alzheimer's, dementia and other neurodegenerative diseases. This new program was launched in collaboration with the Greater Indiana Chapter of the [[Alzheimer's Association]].

Music can enliven the brain and bring joy to people of all abilities, even those with memory problems. The healing power of music is becoming increasingly apparent in numerous studies, as well as in varied practical applications. A comprehensive article in the March/April 2015 issue of Scientific American Mind, "The Healing Power of Music," describes the results of research, along with specific examples of music's impact on the brain. The greatest benefits from music therapy– cognitive, emotional and social– come from intentional engagement with music.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.musicianbrain.com/papers/Thompson_Schlaug_Healing-Power-of-Music_SciAmMind.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

During the science-based Perfect Harmony program, participants and caregivers are involved in social singing with Songbook music. As a group, people share experiences related to memorable songs and the monthly theme. Reading lyrics, actively singing together, listening to songs, engaging in short discussion, and fun and games with rhythm, movement, and instruments, increases mood, memory, and overall quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alzheimers.net/2014-07-21/why-music-boosts-brain-activity-in-dementia-patients/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Songbook Film Series ===
The Great American Songbook Foundation partnered with Indianapolis-based Heartland Film and the Center for the Performing Arts to present classic movie musicals to the public, cultivating a new generation of movie lovers. Some screenings included guest speakers, who enlightened audiences on the nature and creation of the movies shown.&lt;ref&gt;Jill Disis, "Heartland Pictures Launches the Great American Songbook Movie Series at the Palladium", Indianapolis Star Sept. 27, 2012, retrieved from http://www.indystar.com/article/20120927/
THINGSTODO04/209280311/Heartland-launches-Great-American-Songbook-Movie-Series-Palladium.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Songbook Film Series is currently on hiatus.''

== Archives, library, and preservation ==
[[File:Songbook Archives.jpg|thumbnail|right|A group of high school students tours the Songbook Archives, which are adjacent to the Foundation's administrative headquarters.]]

The Songbook Archives serves as a repository for the papers of significant Songbook figures including [[Meredith Willson]], [[Hy Zaret]], and [[Gus Kahn]], as well as special collections covering such artists as [[The Andrews Sisters]] in the following formats: sheet music, photos, scrapbooks, posters, LPs, 45s, music magazines, books, lacquer discs, personal papers, theatre playbills, film, video, analog tape, and recordings. Many of these items are currently approaching one hundred years of age. A finite window of time exists to preserve these materials through digitization.

The Foundation's non-circulating library houses a wide variety of reference materials. In addition, students, teachers and researchers from around the world visit the Foundation's website to view and research selections from the Archives, which contains over one hundred collections, 35,000 pieces of sheet music, and 3000 reference books.

Items housed in the Foundation's Archives include:

:* 7000 audio recordings in thirteen different formats, including [[Rudy Vallée]]'s radio transcription discs dating from 1932
:* [[Meredith Willson]]'s personal papers, scripts, and recordings, including [[The Music Man]] and [[The Unsinkable Molly Brown (musical)|The Unsinkable Molly Brown]]
:* Musical orchestrations from [[Bob Hope|Bob]] and [[Dolores Hope]]'s decades of live performances across the globe
:* The piano which was used by composer [[Richard A. Whiting]] to write "[[Hooray for Hollywood]]"
:* [[Hy Zaret]]'s original lyrics for "[[Unchained Melody]]", one of the twentieth century's most frequently recorded songs

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1139">'''''Knee Deep in Paradise''''' is the title of an [[autobiography]] authored by [[actor]]/[[comedian]] [[Brett Butler (comedian)|Brett Butler]], released in 1996.
{{italics}}
The [[memoir]] is very direct, and deals with her pre-stardom life, prior to the success of her popular ABC sitcom ''[[Grace Under Fire (TV series)|Grace Under Fire]]''.

Notable for its unflinching candor, Butler's book provides accounts of such tragic personal events as being abandoned by her father when she was 4 years old, being beaten by her husband, and the ubiquitous crutches of drinking, drugs and sex.  It progresses to her discovery of [[stand-up comedy]] and how it helped to channel her creativity.  She develops her career, sobers up, and discovers her true self.

It was published by [[Hyperion (publisher)|Hyperion]] and is available in [[hardcover]] ({{ISBN|0-7868-8914-4}}), softcover ({{ISBN|0-7868-6136-3}}), and [[audiobook]] formats.

{{nihongo|'''Kurara Chibana'''|知花 くらら|''Chibana Kurara''|born March 27, 1982}} is a Japanese humanitarian, actress, model and beauty pageant titleholder who was crowned [[Miss Universe Japan|Miss Universe Japan 2006]] and competed at [[Miss Universe 2006]] where she finished as the 1st Runner-up.

==Miss Universe 2006==
Chibana is known for her participation in Miss Universe 2006 where she represented Japan. She won the Best National Costume Award for her [[samurai]]-themed outfit designed by the artist Yuichi Miyagawa and the designer Yoshiyuki Ogata, and later became the first runner-up for Miss Universe 2006. During the final, Chibana wore a black evening gown exhibiting intricate laticework designed by Olivier Theyskens for [[Rochas]], and at the preliminaries, Chibana sported a unique red and pink-hued gown with silver corseting designed by Novespazio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.missosology.org/missuniverse06/inesligron.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706013944/http://www.missosology.org/missuniverse06/inesligron.html |date=July 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the pageant, held in Los Angeles, Chibana was the crowd favorite and her flirty winks drew an unusually enthusiastic response from the audience. In spite of the crowd support, her performance in both the swimsuit and evening gown segments were consistently the best and she made it to the top 5 over heavy favorites, Miss Mexico and Miss Colombia despite wearing an ordinary gown.

Above all, Chibana was known to be very charismatic especially during the interview portion. Her ability to connect with the audience was something not witnessed before in the Miss Universe pageant. Paula Shugart, President of the [[Miss Universe Organization]] said in an interview that the scores between Zuleyka and Kurara were very close. During the announcement of the winner, the audience was very vocal in their support for Chibana. Most people including many of the contestants thought that Chibana would win it all.
Japan had not come that close to winning the crown since 1959 when [[Akiko Kojima]] won the first [[Miss Universe]] crown for Japan. Kurara Chibana's successor, Miss Universe Japan 2007, [[Riyo Mori]] won the Miss Universe 2007 title in Mexico City. She also managed to outdo the two [[Japanese people|Japanese women]] who managed to enter the semi-finals in most recent years: [[Miyako Miyazaki]], fourth runner-up in 2003, and Mizuho Sakaguchi, 3rd runner-up in 1988.

==Personal information==
She was an educational-[[philosophy]] student at [[Sophia University]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} She got her [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in 2006.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} She turned down a job offer from a publishing company in order to compete in the [[Miss Universe Japan]] pageant, which was held on April 25, 2006 in Tokyo.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8660">[[File:Locking music 3.jpg|thumb|right|350px|A dancer doing various locking moves]]
'''Locking''' is a style of [[funk music|funk dance]], which is today also associated, but not to be confused with [[hip hop dance|hip hop]]. The name is based on the concept of ''locking'' movements, which basically means freezing from a fast movement and "locking" in a certain position, holding that position for a short while and then continuing in the same speed as before. It relies on fast and distinct arm and hand movements combined with more relaxed hips and legs. The movements are generally large and exaggerated, and often very rhythmic and tightly synced with the music. Locking is quite [[performance]] oriented, often interacting with the audience by smiling or giving them a [[high five]], and some moves are quite comical in nature.

Locking was originally danced to traditional [[funk music]], such as that produced or performed by [[James Brown]]. Funk music is still commonly favored by locking dancers and used by many competitions such as the locking division of [[Juste Debout]]. Locking movements create a strong contrast towards the many fast moves that are otherwise performed quite continuously, combined with [[Mime artist|mime]] style performance and acting towards the audience and other dancers. Locking includes quite a lot of [[acrobatics]] and physically demanding moves, such as landing on one's knees and the [[Split (gymnastics)|split]]. These moves often require knee protection of some sort.

==History==
The beginning of Locking can be traced to one man, [[Don Campbell (dancer)|Don Campbell]]. In the late 1960s he put together several [[fad dance]]s adding moves of his own (known as the "Lock") when performing. The original lock was created by accident: Campbell couldn't do a move called the 'Funky Chicken' and stopped at a particular point whilst moving his arms, creating a 'locking' effect.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Q84TiHcqDqcC&amp;pg=PA147&amp;lpg=PA147&amp;dq=campbellock+%22soul+train%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bSmHcb2MxZ&amp;sig=Nni5OdwwpmC7Wv6EfqgFr_NqPaQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2mZtTaLWA8OclgeQptSaBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=50&amp;ved=0CP8CEOgBMDE#v=onepage&amp;q=campbellock%20%22soul%20train%22&amp;f=false Hip Hop Culture]'', by Emmett George Price, p. 147, published 2006 by [[ABC-CLIO]] (via [[Google Books]])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=Lamont|title=B-Boys: A Children's Guide to Hip Hop|date=2013|publisher=70 West Press|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wasn't able to perform it fluently, for he couldn't remember which step to take next. (Even the acting towards the audience was spontaneous: when people started laughing at Don because of his unfamiliar moves, he responded by pointing at them.) These halts soon became popular as Don added them into his performances. The resulting dance was called Campbellocking, which was later shortened to Locking. In the early 1970s this set off a movement of Locking dance groups, notably Campbell's group [[The Lockers]]. Other lockers Jimmy "Scoo B Doo" Foster, Greggory "Campbellock Jr." Pope, Tony "GoGo" Lewis, Fred "Mr Penguin" Berry (a.k.a. Rerun), Leo "Fluky Luke" Williamson, Damita Jo Freeman and others also helped set the foundation for the locking dance and clothes style.

Clothes style can consist of loud striped socks, pegged pants that stopped at the knees, bright colorful satin shirts with big collars, big colorful bow ties, gigantic Apple Boy hats, and white gloves.

==Moves==
Locking may be done in solo or in unison with two or more dancers doing steps or handshakes together. A locker may smile while performing to emphasize the comical nature of the dance; other times, a serious demeanor will be maintained to place emphasis on technique. Other important stylistic features are waving of arms, pointing, walking stationary and grabbing and rotating the cap or hat. Don Campbell created the original freezes, incorporating his unique rhythm and adding gestures such as points and handclaps. Other dancers also adapted this style while creating other steps and moves.

Locking is by nature an improvisational dance but also consists of a set of signature moves of locking pioneers, However, many lockers alter or blend these with other moves or create their own variations. In general, Lockers will often put a small pause and move up on the second and fourth beats to emphasize the locking.

'''Mikhail Fyodorovich Larionov''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Михаи́л Фёдорович Ларио́нов; June 3, 1881 &amp;ndash; May 10, 1964) was an avant-garde [[Russia]]n painter.

==Life and work==
Larionov was born at [[Tiraspol]], in the [[Kherson Governorate]] of the [[Russian Empire]]. In 1898 he entered the [[Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture]] under [[Isaac Levitan]] and [[Valentin Serov]]. He was suspended three times for his radical outlook. In 1900 he met [[Natalia Goncharova]] and formed a lifelong relationship with her.

From 1902 his style was [[Impressionism]]. After a visit to Paris in 1906 he moved into [[Post-Impressionism]] and then a [[Neo-primitive]] style which derived partly from Russian [[lubok|sign painting]]. In 1908 he staged the Golden Fleece exhibition in Moscow, which included paintings by international avant-garde artists such as [[Henri Matisse|Matisse]], [[André Derain|Derain]], [[Georges Braque|Braque]], [[Paul Gauguin|Gauguin]] and [[Vincent van Gogh|Van Gogh]]. Other group shows promoted by him included [[Vladimir Tatlin|Tatlin]], [[Marc Chagall|Chagall]] and [[Kazimir Malevich|Malevich]].

Larionov was a founding member of two important Russian artistic groups [[Jack of Diamonds (artists)|Jack of Diamonds]] (1909&amp;ndash;1911) and the more radical [[Donkey's Tail]] (1912–1913). He gave names to both groups. His first solo show was for one day in Moscow in 1911. Larionov was influenced by the Georgian artist [[Niko Pirosmani]].

In 1913 he created [[Rayonism]], which was the first creation of near-abstract art in Russia. He had a one-man show at the [[Omega Workshops]].&lt;ref name=Shone&gt;[[Richard Shone|Shone, Richard]]. (1999) ''The Art of Bloomsbury Roger Fry, Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant''. Princeton: [[Princeton University Press]], pp. 137-138. {{ISBN|0-691-04993-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1915 he left Russia and worked with the ballet owner [[Sergei Diaghilev]] in Paris on the productions of the [[Ballets Russes]]. He spent the rest of his life in [[France]] and obtained the French citizenship. He died, aged 82, in the Paris suburb of [[Fontenay-aux-Roses]].

In 2001, the [[Transnistrian Republican Bank|Central Bank of Transnistria]] minted a silver coin honoring this native of today's [[Transnistria]], as part of a series of memorable coins called ''[[The Outstanding People of Pridnestrovie]]''.

The highest price paid for a Larionov painting at auction is 2,200,000 British pounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.artdaily.com/section/news/index.asp?int_sec=2&amp;int_new=20576 |title=Larionov Still Life Sells For Record GBP2.2 Million |author=Artdaily |authorlink=ArtDaily |year=2011 |publisher=Artdaily.com |accessdate=25 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205104228/http://www.artdaily.com/section/news/index.asp?int_sec=2&amp;int_new=20576 |archivedate=5 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is in the highest category "1A – a world famous artist" in "[[United Artists Rating]]".

'''Miramar''' is a [[water park]], salt-water [[spa]] and [[sauna]] complex opened in 1973 at the Waidsee Lake, Weinheim, Germany.
{{As of|2014}}, approximately 50% of the 650,000 annual visitors pay extra for the Sauna area.&lt;ref name="prothmann-20140811"/&gt;
The [[catchment area]] for visitors covers a {{convert|100|km|mi|sigfig=1}} radius, including [[Frankfurt am Main]] to the north, and [[Pforzheim]] to the south.&lt;ref name="prothmann-20140811"/&gt;

The main bathing area contains a wave pool and several slides.&lt;ref name="rnz-20131028"/&gt;&lt;ref name="prothmann-20140811"/&gt;
{{As of|2018}} there were nine water slides in the main indoor pool area with various levels of difficulty and speed, plus [[jacuzzi]]s and outside areas.&lt;ref name="mainecho-20180911"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.main-echo.de/unser-echo/gruppen/Gemeinde-Bessenbach;verein0,1094,B::art293497,6340119|title=Ein Tag Urlaubsfeeling mitten in Weinheim|trans-title=One day holiday fleeing in the middle of Weinheim|location=[[Bessenbach ]]|work=Main Echo|date=11 September 2018|accessdate=12 September 2018|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The thermal spa area has saltwater pools, and these pools are also used to offer [[physiotherapy]].&lt;ref name="mainecho-20180911"/&gt;&lt;ref name="prothmann-20140811"/&gt;

The sauna area is designated as a nudist/{{lang|de|[[Freikörperkultur]]}} ({{lang|de|FKK}}) area, which is extended to the swimming and thermal spa areas on Tuesday evenings.&lt;ref name="prothmann-20140811"/&gt;

==History==
The original swimming bath complex owned by the Town of Weinheim was offered for sale.&lt;ref name="prothmann-20140811"/&gt;  In late-1987 Miramar was purchased by the Steinhart family for the symbolic price of one [[Deutsche Mark]], after which significant expansion and development followed.&lt;ref name="rnz-20180224"/&gt;

Each year {{convert|20.34|TJ|GWh}} of [[geothermal heating]] is used, with hot water at {{convert|63.5|C|sigfig=3}} extracted from a borehole with a flowrate of {{convert|9-10|l/s}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|title=Geothermal Energy Use in Germany|first1=Josef|last1=Weber|first2=Britta|last2=Ganz|first3=Ruediger|last3=Schellschmidt|first4=Burkhard|last4=Sanner|first5=Ruediger|last5=Schulz|date=19–25 April 2015|accessdate=12 September 2018|url=https://pangea.stanford.edu/ERE/db/WGC/papers/WGC/2015/01045.pdf|page=14|conference=World Geothermal Congress|location=Melbourne, Australia|quote=Weinheim (Miramar) … [Flow rate (l/s):] 10 … [Temperature (°C):] 63.5 … [Energy (TJ/yr):] 20.34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The water park had its fortieth birthday in 2013, by which time 17.5 million people had visited.&lt;ref name="rnz-20131028"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rnz.de/nachrichten/bergstrasse_artikel,-Bergstrasse-Weinheim-Schon-175-Millionen-Gaeste-badeten-im-Miramar-_arid,23900.html|title=Weinheim: Schon 17,5 Millionen Gäste badeten im Miramar|work=Rhein Neckar Zeitung|trans-title=Weinheim: already 17.5 million visitors have bathed at Miramar|author=Keke|date=28 October 2013|accessdate=12 September 2018|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="metropol-20131027"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.metropolnews.info/mp98967/miramar-in-weinheim-feiert-40-geburtstag|title=Miramar in Weinheim feiert 40.

Works of art are present through the whole premises.&lt;ref name="prothmann-20140811"&gt;{{cite interview|url=http://archiv.weinheimblog.de/11/wir-sind-ein-familienbad/18127.html|title=„Wir sind ein Familienbad“|trans-title="We are a family swimming pool"|interviewer=Hardy Prothmann|first=Marcus|last=Steinhart|date=11 August 2014|accessdate=12 September 2018|work=Weinheim Blog|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The operation of the on-site shop and massage services are leased out, but the catering in the restaurants is kept in-house by Miramar.&lt;ref name="prothmann-20140811"/&gt;  Of the 150 employees Miramar had in 2014, approximately fifty were working in the catering division, and twenty in cleaning.&lt;ref name="prothmann-20140811"/&gt;

==Water slides==
The indoor complex at Miramar has a number of slides, including an AquaBowl, a TurboSlide and an AquaRacer [[water slide]] installed by Aquarena.&lt;ref name="aquarena-20160826"&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.aquarena.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/aquarena_image2016_E_web.pdf|title=See you in the tube|date=26 August 2016|accessdate=12 September 2018|author=Aquarena|pages=5, 8, 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In summer 2012 a vertical drop [[AquaLoop]] water slide called "Hurricane Loop" was opened.&lt;ref name="rnz-20170404"/&gt; In April 2017, a {{convert|125|m|ft|adj=mid|-long}} slide called "Twister" was scheduled to be opened by the Lord Mayor of Weinheim, Heiner Bernhard ([[:de:Heiner Bernhard|de]]).&lt;ref name="rnz-20170404"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rnz.de/nachrichten/bergstrasse_artikel,-Bergstrasse-Miramar-in-Weinheim-Twister-Rutsche-soll-zur-neuen-Sensation-werden-_arid,266025.html|title="Twister-Rutsche" soll zur neuen Sensation werden|trans-title="Twister-Slide" should become a new sensation|newspaper=Rhein Neckar Zeitung|date=4 April 2017|accessdate=12 September 2018|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slides are inspected and certified by the Technical Inspection Associations ({{lang|de|TÜV}}, {{lang|de|[[Technischer Überwachungsverein]]}}).&lt;ref name="prothmann-20140811"/&gt;

==Sauna complex==
The sauna and relaxation area is a nudist/FKK area at all times.
In 1998 the Sauna and relaxation areas were rebuilt.&lt;ref name="nacktbaden-weinheim"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nacktbaden.de/203-0-weinheim-miramar.html|title=Weinheim: Miramar|work=Nackt Baden|accessdate=12 September 2018|language=de|quote=nur noch dienstags und samstags abends wie bereits beschrieben.

[&lt;time datetime="2013-05" title="May 2013"&gt;05/2013&lt;/time&gt;]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to April 2001, there had also been nudism/FKK in the other areas on Sunday evenings.&lt;ref name="nacktbaden-weinheim"/&gt;  Prior to May 2013, there had also been nudism/FKK in the other areas on Saturday evenings.&lt;ref name="nacktbaden-weinheim"/&gt;

In April 2018, a [[tree house]] sauna ({{lang|de|"Baumsauna"}}) looking out over the Waidsee Lake was opened, which had cost €800,000 and took six months to build.&lt;ref name="rnz-20180224"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rnz.de/nachrichten/bergstrasse_artikel,-miramar-weinheim-miramar-eroeffnete-neue-baum-sauna-plus-video-_arid,340596.html|title=Miramar eröffnete neue Baum-Sauna|trans-title=Miramar opens new Tree house sauna|first=Philipp|last=Weber|work=Rhein Neckar Zeitung|date=24 February 2018|accessdate=12 September 2018|quote=Ende 1987 im Besitz der Familie Steinhart.

==Safety==
{{As of|2018|pre=summer}} Miramar employed a former [[police officer]] to oversee visitor safety, with dedicated safety teams patrolling at busy times.&lt;ref name="hoffman-21080815"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.heidelberg24.de/region/weinheim-wieder-vergewaltigung-in-freizeitbad-so-will-miramar-seine-besucher-schuetzen-10121709.html|title=So will das Miramar seine Besucher künftig schützen|trans-title=The Miramar wants to protect its visitors in the future|work=Heidelberger 24|first=Christian|last=Hoffmann|date=15 August 2018|accessdate=25 September 2018|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; In cooperation with the police force, staff and [[lifeguard]]s at the Miramar pool are trained in [[safeguarding]] techniques.&lt;ref name="d-echo-20180829"/&gt;  All incidents and reports are recorded to identify patterns.&lt;ref name="hoffman-21080815"/&gt;  A €250 fine, followed by Miramar site ban, is applied for breaches of the pool or sauna etiquette rules.  {{As of|2018|pre=mid}} twenty-nine bans were in place, including four for private [[masturbation]] on the premises.&lt;ref name="hoffman-21080815"/&gt;

'''''My Idea of Fun''''' is the second novel by [[Will Self]], and was published in 1993.

==Plot summary==
A lonely boy grows up just outside [[Brighton]] in a caravan park with his over-sexual mother and the tenant Mr Broadhurst, who takes the boy on a disturbing and often violent journey.

The novel works as a strange [[Bildungsroman]], in which the main character, Ian Wharton, learns the art of black magic from Broadhurst, who is also known as the Fat Controller. At the Fat Controller's behest Ian engages in a series of strange acts including time travel and trips to an alternate reality called the Land of Children's jokes, a grotesque alternate universe inhabited by the menacing and deformed characters from jokes. The protagonist's education culminates in bizarre rites of bestiality and necrophilia. However, he finds that in exchange for knowledge of the black arts Broadhurst begins to take over more and more aspects of his life.

The novel may also be seen as an example of an [[unreliable narrator]], as it is unclear whether the strange events in the novel are meant to be real or hallucinatory.

==Reviews==

The '''''PMG Clash of Legends, Starring Hulk Hogan''''' was an [[United States|American]] [[professional wrestling]] [[pay-per-view]] (PPV) event (in various territories) promoted by [[Memphis Wrestling]] owner [[Corey Maclin]] in conjunction with [[Hulk Hogan]], which took place on April 27, 2007 in the [[FedExForum]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. The event attracted a degree of attention after a scheduled match between [[WWE Hall of Fame|Hall of]] [[Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame|Famers]] Hogan and [[Jerry Lawler]] was vetoed by [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE), resulting in a lawsuit between Maclin and WWE. It was described by the [[Dave Meltzer|Wrestling Observer]] as "the biggest [[Independent circuit|indie]] undertaking in the U.S. geared toward the non-[[Hispanic]] market in many years".&lt;ref name="WO3"&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.wrestlingobserver.com/wo/news/headlines/default.asp?aID=19208 | author = | title = More updates on Lawler vs. Hogan | publisher=[[Dave Meltzer|Wrestling Observer]] | accessdate = April 13, 2007 | date = April 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The ''PMG Clash of Legends'' had originally been scheduled to take place in the [[Mid-South Coliseum]]. However, the Mid-South Coliseum was closed in late 2005 due to failure to comply with [[Disability rights movement|disabled accessibility]] regulations. When the FedExForum was chosen as a replacement, the operators of the FedExForum contacted WWE, which had in the past held events in the FedExForum, to ensure that WWE did not object to an alternative professional wrestling promotion staging an event there. WWE did not object to the event taking place. Following the announcement that Lawler would not be allowed to wrestle at the event, WWE offered to refund Maclin's deposit on the rental of the FedExForum. He declined.&lt;ref name="WO2"&gt;{{ cite web|url=http://www.wrestlingobserver.com/wo/news/headlines/default.asp?aID=19218|last=Meltzer|first=Dave|title= Update on Memphis situation regarding WWE and Memphis Wrestling|publisher=Wrestling Observer Newsletter|accessdate=2007-04-13|date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the sole match announced for the event was the titular "Clash of Legends", a bout between Hogan and Memphis Wrestling mainstay Lawler that had been promoted on the Memphis Wrestling television show ''Memphis Wrestling Prime Time'' for several months.&lt;ref name="WO"&gt;{{ cite web|url=http://www.wrestlingobserver.com/wo/news/headlines/default.asp?aID=19108|last=Tramel|first=B|title=Memphis Wrestling TV report|publisher=Wrestling Observer Newsletter|accessdate=2007-04-13|date=2007-04-01|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070525134150/http://www.wrestlingobserver.com/wo/news/headlines/default.asp?aID=19108|archivedate=May 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Torch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/artman/publish/article_19889.shtml|last=Keller|first=Wade|title=WWE News: Date for Hulk Hogan's return to the ring announced today, facing Lawler |publisher=Pro Wrestling Torch|accessdate=2007-04-13|date=2007-03-31 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070428100531/http://www.pwtorch.com/artman/publish/article_19889.shtml &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on April 12, 2007, Lawler announced in a [[news conference]] that WWE had barred him from wrestling Hogan on the basis that [[NBC Universal]] employees (which includes Lawler, on the basis of co-hosting the NBC Universal-owned [[USA Network]]'s ''[[WWE Raw]]'', and his appearances on the biannual ''[[WWE Saturday Night's Main Event]]'') are contractually prohibited from appearing on any of the channels owned by [[MTV Networks]], which includes [[VH1]], the channel on which ''[[Hogan Knows Best]]'',  a [[reality television]] series starring Hogan, airs.&lt;ref name="MM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mikemooneyham.com/pages/viewfull.cfm?ObjectID=F6EF190B-3048-8903-32706EB4EECC196C|last=Mooneyham|first=Mike|title=Hogan-Lawler Called Off|publisher= mikemooneyham.com|accessdate=2007-05-12|date=2007-04-15| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070822103347/http://www.mikemooneyham.com/pages/viewfull.cfm?ObjectID=F6EF190B-3048-8903-32706EB4EECC196C| archivedate = August 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the cancellation of the Hogan-Lawler match, Memphis Wrestling owner Corey Maclin announced that Hogan would instead wrestle [[Paul Wight]] in Wight's first match since leaving WWE in December 2006. When referred to by the [[ring name]] he used in WWE, "The Big Show", Wight stated that this was his "[[slave name]]" and that he was to be referred to as "'The Great' Paul Wight".&lt;ref name="MM" /&gt;

In response to Maclin's announcement, WWE immediately banned all WWE employees from appearing at Memphis Wrestling events, with the result that [[The Boogeyman (wrestler)|The Boogeyman]], [[Charlie Haas]] and [[Shelton Benjamin]] were all obliged to cancel their scheduled appearances at the April 13, 2007 Memphis Wrestling show in [[Tunica, Mississippi]].&lt;ref name="WO2"/&gt; [[Robert Gibson (wrestler)|Robert Gibson]] was to team with his longtime [[The Rock 'n' Roll Express|Rock 'n' Roll Express]] partner [[Ricky Morton]] to face Too Cool II, however WWE pulled Gibson from the event as well, as he was a WWE [[Road Agent (professional wrestling)|producer]]. Gibson would be replaced by [[Kid Kash]], and [[Bobby Eaton]] filled Kash's original spot as [[Koko B. Ware]]'s tag team partner against [[Bill Dundee]] and [[Dutch Mantel]].&lt;ref name="PWI2842007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=M|title=WWE pulls another talent from Memphis Hulk Hogan event|publisher=Pro Wrestling Insider|date=2007-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The event was hosted by Maclin and [[Lance Russell]], and [[List of mayors of Memphis, Tennessee|mayor of Memphis]] [[W. W. Herenton]] served as [[timekeeper]]. Colin Bowman was brought in at the last minute as the Show Director.&lt;ref name="WO3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WO2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Results"&gt;{{ cite web|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/artman/publish/article_20124.shtml|last=Tramel|first=Brian| title=4/27 Memphis Wrestling: Hogan vs. Paul Wight, Beefcake, Bagwell, Abdullah, Valentine, Slick|publisher=[[Wade Keller|Pro Wrestling Torch]]|accessdate=2007-04-28|date=2007-04-28| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070515162924/http://www.pwtorch.com/artman/publish/article_20124.shtml| archivedate = May 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 5, 2007, it was revealed that 2,200 fans attended the event, yielding a [[United States dollar|$]]104,500 gate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rasslinriotnews.blogspot.com/2007/05/col-coverage-official-gate-released.html|last=Tramel| first=Brian|title=COL Coverage: Official Gate Released!!!|publisher= Rasslin' Riot Online via [[Blogger (service)|Blogger.com]]| accessdate=2007-05-06|date=2007-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2008, Maclin filed a claim for [[punitive damages]] against WWE and WWE Chairman [[Vince McMahon]] in the [[Shelby County, Tennessee|Shelby County]] [[circuit court]], alleging that WWE and McMahon had breached section two of the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]].&lt;ref name="Dries"&gt;{{ cite web|url=http://www.memphisdailynews.com/Editorial/StoryLead.aspx?id=100606|last=Dries| first=Bill|title=Memphis Promoter Files Suit Against WWE|publisher=[[The Daily News (Memphis)|The Daily News]]|accessdate= 2008-01-12|date=2008-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''People's Liberation Army Daily''''' ({{zh|s=解放军报|p=Jiěfàngjūn Bào}}), or '''''PLA Daily''''' for short, is the official newspaper of the Chinese [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA). Institutionally, the ''PLA Daily'' is the mouthpiece of and speaks for the [[People's Liberation Army General Political Department|General Political Department]] of the PLA, and in that capacity speaks on the part of the PLA itself. Its editorial line hews closely to that found in the Communist Party's own official newspaper, ''[[People's Daily]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.hoover.org/sites/default/files/uploads/documents/CLM38MS.pdf|title = Chinese Leadership and Elite Responses to the U.S. Pacific Pivot|last = Swaine|first = Michael D.|date = Summer 2012|journal = China Leadership Monitor|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The paper generally covers news stories relating to the PLA and other military affairs, while projecting the voice of the military into the public policy realm for primarily domestic consumption. In August 2010, an editorial suggested that Chinese military strategy was out of date, and that China must "audaciously learn from the experience of the information cultures of foreign militaries", along with modernization and open procurement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE67E07020100815

|quote="audaciously learn from the experience of the information cultures of foreign militaries,"
| first=Ben
| last=Blanchard
| date=2010-08-15
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''PLA Daily'', while officially serving as the voice of the military, does not stray far from the Party's own messaging when it comes to foreign policy. "There is a strong correlation between foreign policy rhetoric in the—CCP’s civilian voice—the People’s Daily—and its military voice—the PLA Daily," writes scholar of strategy [[Alastair Iain Johnston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = How New and Assertive is China's New Assertiveness|last = Iain Johnston|first = Alastair|date = Spring 2013|journal = International Security, Vol 37, No. 4, pp. 7-48 |pmid = |access-date = |publisher = MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The appearances of the pet policy initiatives of Chinese leaders in the pages of ''PLA Daily'' are often taken by scholars as an expression of those leaders' strength in the military. Scholars with the [[Strategic Studies Institute]] of the [[U.S. Army War College]] cites the vast number of appearances of propaganda related to the "[[scientific development concept]]"—promulgated by Party leader [[Hu Jintao]]—as evidence that Hu's "influence on certain areas of the PLA's development since 2004 has been substantial."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Assessing the People's Liberation Army in the Hu Jintao Era|author1=Roy Kamphausen |author2=David Lai |author3=Travis Tanner |publisher = The United States Army War College|year = 2014|isbn = |location = |pages = 151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The ''PLA Daily'' was established on January 1, 1956, under the aegis of the Chinese Communist Party's Central Military Commission, and directly controlled by the GDP. During the [[Cultural Revolution]], the publications chief editor was purged in a political struggle, army commander [[Lin Biao]]—at the time [[Mao Zedong]]'s close comrade—was put in charge of the leadership of the publication.
The most important editorials of the newspaper were jointly published by  ''People's Daily'' and ''Red Flag'', from 1967 to 1978, so called "Two newspapers and one journal"(两报一刊), directly representing the highest voice of Chinese Communist Party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://v.huanqiu.com/history/201104/20110428201140.shtml “两报一刊社论”两次泄露中共最大机密]. &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pinkwashing''' is a form of [[cause marketing]] that uses a range of [[Pink ribbon#Pinkwashing|pink ribbon]] logos, displayed on various products. The Pink ribbon logo symbolizes support for [[breast cancer]]-related charities or foundations.&lt;ref name="thinkbeforeyoupink.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thinkbeforeyoupink.org/past-campaigns/buckets-for-the-cure-2/|title=Think Before You Pink » What the Cluck?!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
         
The term 'pinkwashing' is associated with companies that use the pink ribbon symbol or use the support of breast cancer charities as a marketing technique, to promote one of their products, while at the same time manufactured products have proven to contain ingredients, that are linked to the disease developed or are used in a manner that associates it with the increased risk of disease.

== Etymology ==
The term pinkwashing is compound word modelled on the term [[whitewash]]ing, and was first coined by [[Breast Cancer Action]] (BCA). On thinkbeforeyoupink.org, a project of BCA, 'pinkwasher' is defined as, "a company or organisation that claims to care about breast cancer by promoting a pink ribbon product, but at the same time, produces, manufactures and/or sells products that are linked to the disease."

== Origin of the 'Pink ribbon' ==
The '[[Pink Ribbons, Inc.|pink ribbon]]' first originated from a woman named Charlotte Hayley in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rerobinson.net/uploads/3/6/2/2/3622550/hsu_masters_thesis_2016_robinson.pdf|title=Reproducing Neoliberal Breast Cancer Awareness: A Discourse Analysis of Pinkwashing Campaigns|last=Robinson|first=Rebecca Elizabeth|date=May 2016|website=rerobinson.net/|publisher=|access-date=|type=Thesis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charlotte hand made and dispensed peach colored ribbons with informational cards that read " [[National Cancer Institute|The National Cancer Institute]] annual budget is $1.8 billion, only 5% goes for cancer prevention. Help us wake up our legislators and Americans by wearing this ribbon".

[[Self (magazine)|Self magazine]] in conjunction with [[Estée Lauder Companies|Estee Lauder]] were working on a [[National Breast Cancer Awareness Month|NBCAM]] matter that same year and proposed Hayley with an opportunity to contribute in the issue in a trade for the rights to use the peach coloured ribbon. Hayley declined the offer, having no desire to work with big companies. Following declining the offer, Self magazine and Estee Lauder changed the ribbons color to pink (to avoid legal difficulties over rights) and then used the ribbon as their emblem. Estee Lauder distributed the ribbons to woman at the cosmetic counters included with instructions on small cards how to conduct a correct self-examination for breast cancer.

== 'Pink ribbon' products draw critical examination ==
As the largest Organization monetizing breast cancer, [[Susan G. Komen for the Cure|Susan G. Komen Foundation]] and its licensing of a [[registered trademark|proprietary trademark]] is running the "pink ribbon" logo, and slogan on a wide range of products and has drawn close scrutiny over 'pinkwashing' products.

==Advertisement and marketing controversies==
One of National Breast Cancer Awareness Month's (NBCAM) largest supporters is the [[AstraZeneca|Astra Zeneca]] Health Care Foundation. "Since the Foundation began, it has supported NBCAM's goals of public awareness, public education, knowledge sharing, and greater access to services in the fight against breast cancer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astrazeneca-us.com/responsibility/astrazeneca-healthcare-foundation/national-breast-cancer-awareness-month|title=National Breast Cancer Awareness Month|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some scholars question the true intentions of Astra Zeneca; in P. C. Pezzullos' article, "Resisting National Breast Cancer Awareness Month: The Rhetoric of Counter public and their Cultural Performances".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://comphacker.org/pdfs/338/12021472.pdf | title=Resisting "National Breast Cancer Awareness Month": The Rhetoric of Counterpublics and their Cultural Performances | author=Pezzullo, Phaedra C. | journal=Quarterly Journal of Speech | year=2003 | volume=89 | issue=4 | pages=345–365 | doi=10.1080/0033563032000160981}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Toxic Links Coalition (TLC) disapproves of Astra Zeneca being NBCAM's initial supporter for two reasons: Firstly, Astra Zeneca is the manufacturer of the world's best selling cancer drug in which also produces many of the toxins causing Breast Cancer; secondly, Astra Zeneca has profited from the promotion of mammograms, which is also what might be causing breast cancer.{{Citation needed|reason=Mamogramms may cause Breast Cancer?!?|date=July 2017}} For this reason, "TLC emphasizes the importance of stopping the production of carcinogenic toxic chemicals" (Pezzullo, p.&amp;nbsp;353).
Komen promotions which have drawn criticism include Houston-based [[hydraulic fracturing|fracking]] equipment and vendor [[Baker Hughes]], who sponsored $100,000 for a campaign with the tagline, "Doing their bit for a cure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2014/10/24/Women-s-health-advocates-denounce-Susan-G-Komen-partner-Baker-Hughes/stories/201410240202|title=Women's health advocates denounce Komen Foundation's partnership with Baker Hughes|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents insist that hydraulic fracturing extracts oil and gas, using a mixture of water and chemicals, including known or possible [[carcinogen]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2014/10/21/komen-is-supposed-to-be-curing-breast-cancer-so-why-is-its-pink-ribbon-on-so-many-carcinogenic-products/|title=Komen is supposed to be curing breast cancer. So why is its pink ribbon on so many carcinogenic products?|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar concerns have been raised about automobile manufacturers as sponsors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/ABC_Univision/News/pink-washing-real-hurts-commentary/story?id=20530435|title=Pink Washing Is Real and It Hurts [Commentary]|author=ABC News|work=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; as vehicle exhaust contains carcinogens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/health/2011/12/07/iom-report-has-familiar-list-of-known-breast-cancer-risks/|title=IOM Report Has Familiar List of Known Breast Cancer Risks|work=WSJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Komens' own "Promise Me" perfume has also drawn Breast Cancer Action, as the label fails to disclose that the product contains [[galaxolide]] and [[toluene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bcaction.org/raise-a-stink/|title=Raise a Stink!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "pinkwashing" issue is not limited to Komen and its sponsors. In 2007, the [[Estée Lauder Companies|Estée Lauder]] Pink Ribbon Collection series used a donation to [[The Breast Cancer Research Foundation]] (BCRF) to promote products containing [[paraben]]s, chemicals linked to breast cancer. In 2012, the Food and Drug Administration had connected [[5-Hour Energy]] drinks, a caffeinated energy shot promoted using a Living Beyond Breast Cancer (LBBC) sponsorship as [[cause marketing]], to thirteen deaths and serious injuries, including [[myocardial infarction|heart attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-brothers/breast-cancer-awareness-m_3_b_6022920.html|title=Breast Cancer Awareness Month Brings the Usual 'Pinkwashing' and Unethical Cause-Marketing Partnerships|work=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Think Before You Pink launched an online campaign against [[Yoplait]], the national sponsor of Susan G. Komen's annual walk. Their pink-lidded yogurt was sold to raise money for breast cancer but was made from dairy containing the hormone rBGH or rBST (recombinant bovine growth hormone or recombinant bovine somatotrophin). With enough pressure from the public, [[General Mills]] (the manufacture of Yoplait) pledged to go rBGH free.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Think Before You Pink » Yoplait: Put A Lid On It|url = http://thinkbeforeyoupink.org/past-campaigns/yoplait/|website = thinkbeforeyoupink.org|accessdate = 2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Komen partnered with Kentucky Fried Chicken ([[KFC]]) briefly on a "Buckets for a Cure" campaign. In response, Breast Cancer Action launched the "What's the Cluck?" campaign,&lt;ref name="thinkbeforeyoupink.org"/&gt; arguing that, although Komen's intentions may have been to promote KFC's new grilled chicken and vegetable meals, the same pink buckets held fried chicken, which can be attributed to high-fat diets linked to cancer risk and diseases. Komen contested and saw the marketing as effective because they were able to reach women who were not brought in by other advertisements in their neighbourhoods, like the billboards or the spokesperson at their church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/amywestervelt/2011/11/04/the-pinkwashing-debate-empty-criticism-or-serious-liability|title=The Pinkwashing Debate: Empty Criticism or Serious Liability?|first=Amy|last=Westervelt|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Komen, KFC's pink buckets of chicken helped raise $4 million, and "money from partnerships such as this allowed Komen to provide screening mammograms to 600,000 women last year".&lt;ref&gt;Komen's pink ribbons raise lots of green, many questions; Survivors, groups ask world's largest charity fighting breast cancer to be more sensitive USA TODAY July 18, 2011 Monday&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6816">[[File:Ricky Gervais 2010.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Comedian [[Ricky Gervais]] is believed to have been one of the people involved with ''Planet Relief''.]]

'''''Planet Relief'''''  was a proposed [[BBC]] [[television special]] dealing with the issue of [[global warming]], originally scheduled for broadcast in January 2008. The programme, which had been in development for 18 months, was meant to be similar to previous BBC programmes such as ''[[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]]'' and ''[[Sport Relief]]''. However, it was [[Cancellation (television)|cancelled]] before it was broadcast, allegedly because the BBC was concerned that it would be "biased" towards promoting responses based on acceptance of mainstream [[climate change]] science.

==Concept==
The original idea for ''Planet Relief'' was to increase awareness of climate change. The show, unlike previous BBC specials such as ''Comic Relief'', was not planned to be a charity event, but to increase awareness, similar to ''[[Live Earth]]''. It was mainly inspired by ''[[Live 8]]'', with ''Planet Relief'' seen as its climate change counterpart. The programme would have involved an [[Power station|electric power station]] being shut down for one night, for which the BBC had spent over a year negotiating,&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|last=Black|first=Richard|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6979596.stm|title=BBC switches off climate special|publisher=BBC|date=2007-09-05|accessdate=2007-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; urging viewers "to turn off all unnecessary lights and electric gadgets for the evening." People reported to have been involved with the show included comedians [[Ricky Gervais]] and [[Graham Norton]], entertainment personality [[Jonathan Ross]], the head of BBC comedy [[Jon Plowman]] and environmental expert Matt Prescott.&lt;ref name="Sun"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nathan|first=Sara|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2001320029-2007270686,00.html|title=Beeb show to save the world|publisher=''The Sun''|date=2007-06-15|accessdate=2007-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.directtradesupplies.co.uk/blog/interview-dr-matt-prescott-researcher-campaigner-energy-saving-specialist/ Dr Matt Prescott's] years of experience within ecology and planet conservation helped him to become the professional guidance to spearhead the campaign's concept.

==Cancellation==
The BBC scrapped the idea for ''Planet Relief'' on 5 September 2007.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; [[Peter Barron]], editor of ''[[Newsnight]]'' said, "It is absolutely not the BBC's job to save the planet."&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; [[Peter Horrocks]], head of BBC television news said, "It is not the BBC's job to lead opinion or proselytise on this or any other subject."&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; There were also concerns that the power station shutdown "might overload parts of the [electricity distribution] network."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Haines|first=Lester|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/09/05/climate_special_canned/|title=BBC cans Planet Relief special|publisher=''The Register''|date=2007-09-05|accessdate=2007-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC did not, however, say that the show was cancelled due to bias, stating rather that, "The BBC is committed to programmes about climate change but after ''Live Earth'' what audiences say is they are looking for programmes of a documentary or factual nature to explain the complex subject."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Beckford|first=Mark|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/main.jhtml?xml=/earth/2007/09/06/eabbc106.xml|title=BBC drops 'Planet Relief' plan to save world|publisher=''Daily Telegraph''|date=2007-09-06|accessdate=2007-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Right wing]] commentators opposed the idea of ''Planet Relief'', including [[Keith Waterhouse]] who said in the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' before the show was cancelled that, "If the idea is still developing, we can only hope it gets lost in the darkroom. Heaven knows ''Comic Relief'' is puerile and patronising enough. Can you imagine what ''Cosmic Relief''&amp;mdash;in fact, they're toying with calling it ''Planet Relief'', on which note I can only warn readers of a nervous disposition to avoid any enterprise containing the word Planet&amp;mdash;is going to be like?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Waterhouse|first=Keith|authorlink=Keith Waterhouse|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/columnists/columnists.html?in_article_id=478588&amp;in_page_id=1772&amp;in_author_id=255&amp;in_a_source=&amp;in_check=N|title=Comic Relief is bad enough, but plans for an environmental Planet Relief are no joke|publisher=''Daily Mail''|date=2007-08-29|accessdate=2007-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Complaints about the programme also came from [[Scientists opposing the mainstream scientific assessment of global warming|climate sceptics]] such as [[Martin Durkin (television director)|Martin Durkin]], who said, "The thing that disturbs me most is that the BBC has such a leviathan position … that if it decides that it is going to adopt climate change as a moral purpose, I have got a lot of trouble with that. I don't think it is the role of the BBC to spend my money on a moral purpose."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Wray | first = Richard |author2=Holmwood, Leigh  | title = BBC news chiefs attack plans for climate change campaign |  publisher = ''The Guardian'' | date = 2007-09-05 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,2156728,00.html | accessdate =  2007-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For their part, climate change activists attacked the BBC for cancelling the programme. Author [[Mark Lynas]] said, "This decision shows a real poverty of understanding among senior BBC executives about the gravity of the situation we face. The only reason why this became an issue is that there is a small but vociferous group of climate 'sceptics' lobbying against taking action, so the BBC is behaving like a coward and refusing to take a more consistent stance."&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;

Another critic, [[Friends of the Earth]] executive director [[Tony Juniper]], said, "This is a very disappointing decision considering the huge potential for the BBC in helping us more quickly make the shift toward a low-carbon society. The science of climate change is very clear and if approached in the right way taking up this very serious issue would not compromise the BBC' impartiality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sherwin|first=Adam|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article2393266.ece|title=BBC scraps plans for day-long TV special on climate change|publisher=''The Times''|date=2007-09-06|accessdate=2007-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Polaris''''' (published in 1997) is a [[French-language]] post-apocalyptic undersea [[role-playing game]] written by Philippe Tessier and published by Halloween Concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darkshire.net/jhkim/rpg/encyclopedia/alphabetical/P-Q.html|title=RPG Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third edition of the game was published in 2008 by Blackbook Editions. This edition is not equivalent to the third edition that could be found at one time on the [[Internet]].

In this universe, humankind has fled the Earth's surface, made unhabitable by some [[wikt:cataclysm|cataclysm]], to a life of hardship under the seas. Human declining fertility, war and political intrigues between great powers and piracy are only examples of the difficulties humanity has to face every day. But there may be hope, as strange phenomenons, known as the Polaris effect, could be the key to humans' salvation, or final demise.

'''Romanticism''' (also known as the '''Romantic era''') was an artistic, literary, musical and intellectual movement that originated in Europe toward the end of the 18th century, and in most areas was at its peak in the approximate period from 1800 to 1850. Romanticism was characterized by its emphasis on emotion and individualism as well as glorification of all the past and nature, preferring the medieval rather than the classical. &lt;!-- Please do not adjust these dates without raising the matter on the talk page first --&gt;  It was partly a reaction to the [[Industrial Revolution]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9083836 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051013060413/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9083836 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=13 October 2005 |title=''Romanticism''.

The movement emphasized intense emotion as an authentic source of [[aesthetic]] experience, placing new emphasis on such emotions as [[apprehension (fear)|apprehension]], [[horror and terror]], and [[Awe (emotion)|awe]]—especially that experienced in confronting the new aesthetic categories of the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublimity]] and beauty of nature. It elevated [[folk art]] and ancient custom to something noble, but also spontaneity as a desirable characteristic (as in the musical [[impromptu]]). In contrast to the [[Rationalism]] and [[Classicism]] of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], Romanticism revived [[medievalism]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Núria Perpinyà|Perpinya]], Núria. [http://www.logos-verlag.de/cgi-bin/buch/isbn/3794 Ruins, Nostalgia and Ugliness. Five Romantic perceptions of Middle Ages and a spoon of Game of Thrones and Avant-garde oddity]. Berlin: Logos Verlag. 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and elements of art and narrative perceived as authentically medieval in an attempt to escape population growth, early [[urban sprawl]], and [[Industrial Revolution|industrialism]].

Although the movement was rooted in the German ''[[Sturm und Drang]]'' movement, which preferred intuition and emotion to the rationalism of the Enlightenment, the events and ideologies of the [[French Revolution]] were also proximate factors. Romanticism assigned a high value to the achievements of "heroic" individualists and artists, whose examples, it maintained, would raise the quality of society. It also promoted the individual imagination as a critical authority allowed of freedom from classical notions of form in art. There was a strong recourse to historical and natural inevitability, a ''[[Zeitgeist]]'', in the representation of its ideas. In the second half of the 19th century, [[Realism (art movement)|Realism]] was offered as a polar opposite to Romanticism.&lt;ref&gt;"'A remarkable thing,' continued Bazarov, 'these funny old romantics! They work up their nervous system into a state of agitation, then, of course, their equilibrium is upset.'" ([[Ivan Turgenev]], ''[[Fathers and Sons (novel)|Fathers and Sons]]'', chap. 4 [1862])&lt;/ref&gt; The decline of Romanticism during this time was associated with multiple processes, including social and political changes and the spread of nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/901360| jstor = 901360| title = The Decline of Romanticism: End of the Century, Turn of the Century-- Introductory Sketch of an Essay| journal = Studia Musicologica Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae| volume = 12| issue = 1/4| page = 263| year = 1970| last1 = Szabolcsi | first1 = B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defining Romanticism==

===Basic characteristics===
The nature of Romanticism may be approached from the primary importance of the free expression of the feelings of the artist. The importance the Romantics placed on emotion is summed up in the remark of the German painter [[Caspar David Friedrich]], "the artist's feeling is his law".&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 96&lt;/ref&gt; To [[William Wordsworth]], poetry should begin as "the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings", which the poet then "recollect[s] in tranquility", evoking a new but corresponding emotion the poet can then mold into art.&lt;ref&gt;From the Preface to the 2nd edition of ''[[Lyrical Ballads]]'', quoted Day, 2&lt;/ref&gt;

To express these feelings, it was considered the content of art had to come from the imagination of the artist, with as little interference as possible from "artificial" rules dictating what a work should consist of. [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] and others believed there were natural laws the imagination—at least of a good creative artist—would unconsciously follow through [[artistic inspiration]] if left alone.&lt;ref&gt;Day, 3&lt;/ref&gt; As well as rules, the influence of models from other works was considered to impede the creator's own imagination, so that [[originality]] was essential. The concept of the [[genius]], or artist who was able to produce his own original work through this process of ''creation from nothingness'', is key to Romanticism, and to be derivative was the worst sin.&lt;ref name="Ruthven01p40"&gt;Ruthven (2001) p. 40 quote: "Romantic ideology of literary authorship, which conceives of the text as an autonomous object produced by an individual genius."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Spearing87"&gt;Spearing (1987) quote: "Surprising as it may seem to us, living after the Romantic movement has transformed older ideas about literature, in the Middle Ages authority was prized more highly than originality."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eco94"&gt;Eco (1994) p. 95 quote:
Much art has been and is repetitive. The concept of absolute originality is a contemporary one, born with Romanticism; classical art was in vast measure serial, and the "modern" avant-garde (at the beginning of this century) challenged the Romantic idea of "creation from nothingness", with its techniques of collage, mustachios on the Mona Lisa, art about art, and so on.&lt;/ref&gt; This idea is often called "romantic originality."&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse (1926), throughout; Smith (1924); Millen, Jessica ''Romantic Creativity and the Ideal of Originality: A Contextual Analysis'', in [http://eview.anu.edu.au/cross-sections/vol6/pdf/ch07.pdf ''Cross-sections'', The Bruce Hall Academic Journal – Volume VI, 2010 PDF]; Forest Pyle, The Ideology of Imagination: Subject and Society in the Discourse of Romanticism (Stanford University Press, 1995) p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Translator and prominent Romantic [[August Wilhelm Schlegel]] argued in his ''Lectures on Dramatic Arts and Letters'' that the most phenomenal power of human nature is its capacity to divide and diverge into opposite directions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=European Romanticism: A Brief History with Documents|last=1963–|first=Breckman, Warren|date=2008|publisher=Bedford/St. Martins|others=Rogers D.

Not essential to Romanticism, but so widespread as to be normative, was a strong belief and interest in the importance of nature. This particularly in the effect of nature upon the artist when he is surrounded by it, preferably alone. In contrast to the usually very social art of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], Romantics were distrustful of the human world, and tended to believe a close connection with nature was mentally and morally healthy. Romantic art addressed its audiences with what was intended to be felt as the personal voice of the artist. So, in literature, "much of romantic poetry invited the reader to identify the protagonists with the poets themselves".&lt;ref&gt;Day 3–4; quotation from M.H. Abrams, quoted in Day, 4&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Isaiah Berlin]], Romanticism embodied "a new and restless spirit, seeking violently to burst through old and cramping forms, a nervous preoccupation with perpetually changing inner states of consciousness, a longing for the unbounded and the indefinable, for perpetual movement and change, an effort to return to the forgotten sources of life, a passionate effort at self-assertion both individual and collective, a search after means of expressing an unappeasable yearning for unattainable goals."&lt;ref&gt;Berlin, 92&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology===
The group of words with the root "Roman" in the various European languages, such as "romance" and "Romanesque", has a complicated history, but by the middle of the 18th century "romantic" in English and ''romantique'' in French were both in common use as adjectives of praise for natural phenomena such as views and sunsets, in a sense close to modern English usage but without the amorous connotation. The application of the term to literature first became common in Germany, where the circle around the Schlegel brothers, critics [[August Wilhelm Schlegel|August]] and [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich]], began to speak of ''romantische Poesie'' ("romantic poetry") in the 1790s, contrasting it with "classic" but in terms of spirit rather than merely dating.  Friedrich Schlegel wrote in his ''Dialogue on Poetry'' (1800), "I seek and find the romantic among the older moderns, in Shakespeare, in Cervantes, in Italian poetry, in that age of chivalry, love and fable, from which the phenomenon and the word itself are derived."&lt;ref&gt;Ferber, 6–7&lt;/ref&gt;

In both French and German the closeness of the adjective to ''roman'', meaning the fairly new literary form of the [[novel]], had some effect on the sense of the word in those languages.  The use of the word, invented by [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich Schlegel]], did not become general very quickly, and was probably spread more widely in France by its persistent use by [[Germaine de Staël]] in her ''[[De l'Allemagne]]'' (1813), recounting her travels in Germany.&lt;ref name="Ferber, 7"&gt;Ferber, 7&lt;/ref&gt;  In England Wordsworth wrote in a preface to his poems of 1815 of the "romantic harp" and "classic lyre",&lt;ref name="Ferber, 7"/&gt; but in 1820 [[Lord Byron|Byron]] could still write, perhaps slightly disingenuously, "I perceive that in Germany, as well as in Italy, there is a great struggle about what they call 'Classical' and 'Romantic', terms which were not subjects of classification in England, at least when I left it four or five years ago".&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen, 241.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is only from the 1820s that Romanticism certainly knew itself by its name, and in 1824 the [[Académie française]] took the wholly ineffective step of issuing a decree condemning it in literature.&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen, 242.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Period===
The period typically called Romantic varies greatly between different countries and different artistic media or areas of thought. [[Margaret Drabble]] described it in literature as taking place "roughly between 1770 and 1848",&lt;ref&gt;in her ''Oxford Companion'' article, quoted by Day, 1&lt;/ref&gt; and few dates much earlier than 1770 will be found. In English literature, [[M. H. Abrams]] placed it between 1789, or 1798, this latter a very typical view, and about 1830, perhaps a little later than some other critics.&lt;ref&gt;Day, 1–5&lt;/ref&gt;  Others have proposed 1780–1830.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = British Literature 1780–1830|last = Mellor|first = Anne|publisher = Harcourt Brace &amp; Co./Wadsworth|year = 1996|isbn = 978-1413022537|location = NY|pages = |last2 = Matlak|first2 = Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other fields and other countries the period denominated as Romantic can be considerably different; [[Romantic music|musical Romanticism]], for example, is generally regarded as only having ceased as a major artistic force as late as 1910, but in an extreme extension the ''[[Four Last Songs]]'' of [[Richard Strauss]] are described stylistically as "Late Romantic" and were composed in 1946–48.&lt;ref&gt;Edward F. Kravitt, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=WpR6Ja9eQzYC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=%22Four+Last+Songs%22+%22Late+Romantic%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FC92T8K_JIWA8gPP3JCeDQ&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Four%20Last%20Songs%22%20%22Late%20Romantic%22&amp;f=false The Lied: Mirror of Late Romanticism]'' (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1996): 47. {{ISBN|0300063652}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in most fields the Romantic Period is said to be over by about 1850, or earlier.

The early period of the Romantic Era was a time of war, with the French Revolution (1789–1799) followed by the [[Napoleonic Wars]] until 1815.  These wars, along with the political and social turmoil that went along with them, served as the background for Romanticism.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Greenblatt et al., ''Norton Anthology of English Literature'', eighth edition, "The Romantic Period – Volume D" (New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company Inc., 2006): {{Page needed|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The key generation of French Romantics born between 1795–1805 had, in the words of one of their number, [[Alfred de Vigny]], been "conceived between battles, attended school to the rolling of drums".&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, 147, inc. quotation&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Jacques Barzun]], there were three generations of Romantic artists. The first emerged in the 1790s and 1800s, the second in the 1820s, and the third later in the century.&lt;ref&gt;Barzun, 469&lt;/ref&gt;

===Context and place in history===
The more precise characterization and specific definition of Romanticism has been the subject of debate in the fields of [[intellectual history]] and [[literary history]] throughout the 20th century, without any great measure of consensus emerging.  That it was part of the [[Counter-Enlightenment]], a reaction against the [[Age of Enlightenment]], is generally accepted in current scholarship.  Its relationship to the [[French Revolution]], which began in 1789 in the very early stages of the period, is clearly important, but highly variable depending on geography and individual reactions.  Most Romantics can be said to be broadly progressive in their views, but a considerable number always had, or developed, a wide range of conservative views,&lt;ref&gt;Day, 1–3; the arch-conservative and Romantic is [[Joseph de Maistre]], but many Romantics swung from youthful radicalism to conservative views in middle age, for example Wordsworth. [[Samuel Palmer]]'s only published text was a short piece opposing the [[Repeal of the corn laws]].&lt;/ref&gt; and nationalism was in many countries strongly associated with Romanticism, as discussed in detail below.

In philosophy and the history of ideas, Romanticism was seen by Isaiah Berlin as disrupting for over a century the classic Western traditions of rationality and the idea of moral absolutes and agreed values, leading "to something like the melting away of the very notion of objective truth",&lt;ref&gt;Berlin, 57&lt;/ref&gt; and hence not only to nationalism, but also [[fascism]] and [[totalitarianism]], with a gradual recovery coming only after World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Several of Berlin's pieces dealing with this theme are collected in the work referenced. See in particular: Berlin, 34–47, 57–59, 183–206, 207–37.&lt;/ref&gt;  For the Romantics, Berlin says, &lt;blockquote&gt;in the realm of ethics, politics, aesthetics it was the authenticity and sincerity of the pursuit of inner goals that mattered; this applied equally to individuals and groups—states, nations, movements. This is most evident in the aesthetics of romanticism, where the notion of eternal models, a Platonic vision of ideal beauty, which the artist seeks to convey, however imperfectly, on canvas or in sound, is replaced by a passionate belief in spiritual freedom, individual creativity. The painter, the poet, the composer do not hold up a mirror to nature, however ideal, but invent; they do not imitate (the doctrine of mimesis), but create not merely the means but the goals that they pursue; these goals represent the self-expression of the artist's own unique, inner vision, to set aside which in response to the demands of some "external" voice—church, state, public opinion, family friends, arbiters of taste—is an act of betrayal of what alone justifies their existence for those who are in any sense creative.&lt;ref&gt;Berlin, 57–58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- yes, 2 semi-colons &amp; about 15 commas in the quote --&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:John William Waterhouse - The Lady of Shalott - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|[[John William Waterhouse]], ''[[The Lady of Shalott (painting)|The Lady of Shalott]]'', 1888, after a poem by [[Tennyson]]; like many [[Victorian painting]]s, romantic but not Romantic.]]

[[Arthur Lovejoy]] attempted to demonstrate the difficulty of defining Romanticism in his seminal article "On The Discrimination of Romanticisms" in his ''Essays in the [[History of ideas|History of Ideas]]'' (1948); some scholars see Romanticism as essentially continuous with the present, some like [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]] see in it the inaugural moment of [[modernity]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldandi.com/newhome/public/2004/february/bkpub1.asp Linda Simon ''The Sleep of Reason'' by Robert Hughes]&lt;/ref&gt; and some like [[Chateaubriand]], [[Novalis]] and Samuel Taylor Coleridge see it as the beginning of a tradition of resistance to [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] rationalism—a "Counter-Enlightenment"—&lt;ref&gt;''[[Three Critics of the Enlightenment: Vico, Hamann, Herder]]'', Pimlico, 2000 {{ISBN|0712664920}} was one of [[Isaiah Berlin]]'s many publications on the Enlightenment and its enemies that did much to popularise the concept of a Counter-Enlightenment movement that he characterised as [[Relativism|relativist]], [[Rationalism|anti-rationalist]], [[Vitalism|vitalist]] and organic,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Darrin McMahon|Darrin M. McMahon]], "The Counter-Enlightenment and the Low-Life of Literature in Pre-Revolutionary France" ''Past and Present'' No. 159 (May 1998:77–112) p. 79 note 7.&lt;/ref&gt; to be associated most closely with [[German Romanticism]]. An earlier definition comes from [[Charles Baudelaire]]: "Romanticism is precisely situated neither in choice of subject nor exact truth, but in the way of feeling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Salon_de_1846_%28Curiosit%C3%A9s_esth%C3%A9tiques%29#II._.E2.80.94_Qu.E2.80.99est-ce_que_le_romantisme.3F |title=Baudelaire's speech at the "Salon des curiosités Estethiques |language=fr |publisher=Fr.wikisource.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The end of the Romantic era is marked in some areas by a new style of [[Realism (arts)|Realism]], which affected literature, especially the novel and drama, painting, and even music, through [[Verismo]] opera. This movement was led by France, with [[Balzac]] and [[Flaubert]] in literature and [[Courbet]] in painting; [[Stendhal]] and [[Goya]] were important precursors of Realism in their respective media. However, Romantic styles, now often representing the established and safe style against which Realists rebelled, continued to flourish in many fields for the rest of the century and beyond. In music such works from after about 1850 are referred to by some writers as "Late Romantic"  and by others as "Neoromantic" or "Postromantic", but other fields do not usually use these terms; in English literature and painting the convenient term "Victorian" avoids having to characterise the period further.

In northern Europe, the Early Romantic visionary optimism and belief that the world was in the process of great change and improvement had largely vanished, and some art became more conventionally political and polemical as its creators engaged polemically with the world as it was. Elsewhere, including in very different ways the United States and Russia, feelings that great change was underway or just about to come were still possible. Displays of intense emotion in art remained prominent, as did the exotic and historical settings pioneered by the Romantics, but experimentation with form and technique was generally reduced, often replaced with meticulous technique, as in the poems of [[Tennyson]] or many paintings.  If not realist, late 19th-century art was often extremely detailed, and pride was taken in adding authentic details in a way that earlier Romantics did not trouble with. Many Romantic ideas about the nature and purpose of art, above all the pre-eminent importance of originality, remained important for later generations, and often underlie modern views, despite opposition from theorists.

In literature, Romanticism found recurrent themes in the evocation or criticism of the past, the cult of "[[sensibility]]" with its emphasis on women and children, the isolation of the artist or narrator, and respect for nature. Furthermore, several romantic authors, such as [[Edgar Allan Poe]] and [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], based their writings on the [[supernatural]]/[[occult]] and human [[psychology]]. Romanticism tended to regard [[satire]] as something unworthy of serious attention, a prejudice still influential today.&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, James (1958) [https://books.google.com/books?id=4kc4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 ''English Satire''] p. 1. There were a few exceptions, notably Byron, who integrated satire into some of his greatest works, yet shared much in common with his Romantic contemporaries. Bloom, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;  The romantic movement in literature was preceded by the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and succeeded by [[Literary realism|Realism]].

Some authors cite 16th century poet [[Isabella di Morra]] as an early precursor of Romantic literature. Her lyrics covering themes of isolation and loneliness, which reflected the tragic events of her life, are considered "an impressive prefigurement of Romanticism",&lt;ref&gt;Paul F. Grendler, [[Renaissance Society of America]], ''Encyclopedia of the Renaissance'', [[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner]], 1999, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; differing from the [[Petrarch]]ist fashion of the time based on the [[philosophy of love]].

The precursors of Romanticism in English poetry go back to the middle of the 18th century, including figures such as [[Joseph Warton]] (headmaster at [[Winchester College]]) and his brother [[Thomas Warton]], [[Oxford Professor of Poetry|Professor of Poetry]] at [[Oxford University]].&lt;ref name="John Keats page 106"&gt;John Keats. By Sidney Colvin, p. 106. Elibron Classics&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph maintained that invention and imagination were the chief qualities of a poet. [[Thomas Chatterton]] is generally considered the first Romantic poet in English.&lt;ref name="Thomas Chatterton 1971, page 11"&gt;Thomas Chatterton, Grevel Lindop, 1972, Fyffield Books, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The Scottish poet [[James Macpherson]] influenced the early development of Romanticism with the international success of his [[Ossian]] cycle of poems published in 1762, inspiring both [[Goethe]] and the young [[Walter Scott]]. Both Chatterton and Macpherson's work involved elements of fraud, as what they claimed was earlier literature that they had discovered or compiled was, in fact, entirely their own work. The [[Gothic novel]], beginning with [[Horace Walpole]]'s ''[[The Castle of Otranto]]'' (1764), was an important precursor of one strain of Romanticism, with a delight in horror and threat, and exotic picturesque settings, matched in Walpole's case by his role in the early [[Gothic Revival|revival of Gothic architecture]]. ''[[Tristram Shandy]]'', a novel by [[Laurence Sterne]] (1759–67) introduced a whimsical version of the anti-rational [[sentimental novel]] to the English literary public.

===Germany===
[[File:Des Knaben Wunderhorn III (1808).jpg|thumb|Title page of Volume III of ''[[Des Knaben Wunderhorn]]'', 1808]]
An early German influence came from [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], whose 1774 novel ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]'' had young men throughout Europe emulating its protagonist, a young artist with a very sensitive and passionate temperament. At that time Germany was a multitude of small separate states, and Goethe's works would have a seminal influence in developing a unifying sense of [[nationalism]].  Another philosophic influence came from the German idealism of [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Friedrich Schelling]], making [[Jena]] (where Fichte lived, as well as Schelling, [[Hegel]], [[Schiller]] and the brothers [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Schlegel]]) a center for early [[German Romanticism]] (see [[Jena Romanticism]]). Important writers were [[Ludwig Tieck]], [[Novalis]] (''[[Heinrich von Ofterdingen]]'', 1799), [[Heinrich von Kleist]] and [[Friedrich Hölderlin]]. [[Heidelberg]] later became a center of German Romanticism, where writers and poets such as [[Clemens Brentano]], [[Achim von Arnim]], and [[Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff]] (''[[Aus dem Leben eines Taugenichts]]'') met regularly in literary circles.

Important motifs in German Romanticism are travelling, nature, for example the [[German Forest]], and [[Germanic mythology|Germanic myths]]. The later German Romanticism of, for example [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]]'s ''[[Der Sandmann]]'' (''The Sandman''), 1817, and [[Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff]]'s ''Das Marmorbild'' (''The Marble Statue''), 1819, was darker in its motifs and has [[gothic novel|gothic]] elements.  The significance to Romanticism of childhood innocence, the importance of imagination, and racial theories all combined to give an unprecedented importance to [[folk literature]], non-classical [[mythology]] and [[children's literature]], above all in Germany.  Brentano and von Arnim were significant literary figures who together published ''[[Des Knaben Wunderhorn]]'' ("The Boy's Magic Horn" or [[cornucopia]]), a collection of versified folk tales, in 1806–08.  The first collection of ''[[Grimms' Fairy Tales]]'' by the [[Brothers Grimm]] was published in 1812.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Zipes |first=Jack |year=1988 |title=The Brothers Grimm: From Enchanted Forests to the Modern World |edition = 1st |publisher= Routledge |isbn=978-0415900812 |pages= 7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the much later work of [[Hans Christian Andersen]], who was publishing his invented tales in Danish from 1835, these German works were at least mainly based on collected [[Folklore|folk tales]], and the Grimms remained true to the style of the telling in their early editions, though later rewriting some parts.  One of the brothers, [[Jacob Grimm|Jacob]], published in 1835 ''[[Deutsche Mythologie]]'', a long academic work on Germanic mythology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Zipes |first=Jack| year=2000 |title=The Oxford Companion to Fairy Tales |publisher= Oxford University Press |pages=13–14,  218–19 |isbn=978-0198601159 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another strain is exemplified by Schiller's highly emotional language and the depiction of physical violence in his play ''[[The Robbers]]'' of 1781.

In [[English literature]], the key figures of the Romantic movement are considered to be the group of poets including [[William Wordsworth]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[John Keats]], [[Lord Byron]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], and the much older [[William Blake]], followed later by the isolated figure of [[John Clare]]; also such novelists as [[Walter Scott]] from Scotland and [[Mary Shelley]], and the essayists [[William Hazlitt]] and [[Charles Lamb]]. The publication in 1798 of ''[[Lyrical Ballads]]'', with many of the finest poems by Wordsworth and Coleridge, is often held to mark the start of the movement.  The majority of the poems were by Wordsworth, and many dealt with the lives of the poor in his native [[Lake District]], or his feelings about nature—which he more fully developed in his long poem ''[[The Prelude]]'', never published in his lifetime.  The longest poem in the volume was Coleridge's ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]'', which showed the Gothic side of English Romanticism, and the exotic settings that many works featured. In the period when they were writing, the [[Lake Poets]] were widely regarded as a marginal group of radicals, though they were supported by the critic and writer [[William Hazlitt]] and others.
[[File:Anne-Louis Girodet-Trioson 006.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson|Girodet]], ''[[Chateaubriand]]'' in Rome, 1808]]

In contrast [[Lord Byron]] and [[Walter Scott]] achieved enormous fame and influence throughout Europe with works exploiting the violence and drama of their exotic and historical settings; Goethe called Byron "undoubtedly the greatest genius of our century".&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen, 215.&lt;/ref&gt; Scott achieved immediate success with his long narrative poem ''[[The Lay of the Last Minstrel]]'' in 1805, followed by the full [[epic poem]] ''[[Marmion (poem)|Marmion]]'' in 1808. Both were set in the distant Scottish past, already evoked in ''Ossian''; [[Romanticism in Scotland|Romanticism and Scotland]] were to have a long and fruitful partnership.  Byron had equal success with the first part of ''[[Childe Harold's Pilgrimage]]'' in 1812, followed by four "Turkish tales", all in the form of long poems, starting with ''[[The Giaour]]'' in 1813, drawing from his [[Grand Tour]], which had reached Ottoman Europe, and [[Orientalism|orientalizing]] the themes of the Gothic novel in verse.  These featured different variations of the "[[Byronic hero]]", and his own life contributed a further version. Scott meanwhile was effectively inventing the [[historical novel]], beginning in 1814 with ''[[Waverley (novel)|Waverley]]'', set in the [[1745 Jacobite rising]], which was an enormous and highly profitable success, followed by over 20 further [[Waverley Novels]] over the next 17 years, with settings going back to the [[Crusades]] that he had researched to a degree that was new in literature.&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen, 192–96.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to Germany, Romanticism in English literature had little connection with nationalism, and the Romantics were often regarded with suspicion for the sympathy many felt for the ideals of the [[French Revolution]], whose collapse and replacement with the dictatorship of Napoleon was, as elsewhere in Europe, a shock to the movement. Though his novels celebrated Scottish identity and history, Scott was politically a firm Unionist, but admitted to Jacobite sympathies. Several spent much time abroad, and a famous stay on [[Lake Geneva]] with Byron and Shelley in 1816 produced the hugely influential novel ''[[Frankenstein]]'' by Shelley's wife-to-be [[Mary Shelley]] and the [[novella]] ''[[The Vampyre]]'' by Byron's doctor [[John William Polidori]].  The lyrics of [[Robert Burns]] in Scotland and [[Thomas Moore]], from Ireland reflected in different ways their countries and the Romantic interest in folk literature, but neither had a fully Romantic approach to life or their work.

Though they have modern critical champions such as [[György Lukács]], Scott's novels are today more likely to be experienced in the form of the many operas that composers continued to base on them over the following decades, such as [[Donizetti]]'s ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'' and [[Vincenzo Bellini]]'s ''[[I puritani]]'' (both 1835).  Byron is now most highly regarded for his short lyrics and his generally unromantic prose writings, especially his letters, and his unfinished [[satire]] ''[[Don Juan (Byron)|Don Juan]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen, 197–200.&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike many Romantics, Byron's widely publicised personal life appeared to match his work, and his death at 36 in 1824 from disease when helping the [[Greek War of Independence]] appeared from a distance to be a suitably Romantic end, entrenching his legend.&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen, 213–20.&lt;/ref&gt;  Keats in 1821 and Shelley in 1822 both died in Italy, Blake (at almost 70) in 1827, and Coleridge largely ceased to write in the 1820s.  Wordsworth was by 1820 respectable and highly regarded, holding a government [[sinecure]], but wrote relatively little.  In the discussion of English literature, the Romantic period is often regarded as finishing around the 1820s, or sometimes even earlier, although many authors of the succeeding decades were no less committed to Romantic values.

The most significant novelist in English during the peak Romantic period, other than Walter Scott, was [[Jane Austen]], whose essentially conservative world-view had little in common with her Romantic contemporaries, retaining a strong belief in decorum and social rules, though critics {{who|date=December 2015}} have detected tremors under the surface of some works, especially ''[[Mansfield Park]]'' (1814) and ''[[Persuasion (novel)|Persuasion]]'' (1817).&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen, 188–89.&lt;/ref&gt; But around the mid-century the undoubtedly Romantic novels of the [[Yorkshire]]-based [[Brontë family]] appeared.  Most notably [[Charlotte Brontë|Charlotte's]] ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' and [[Emily Brontë|Emily's]] ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'', both published in 1847, which also introduced more gothic themes. While these two novels were written and published after the Romantic period is said to have ended, their novels were heavily influenced by Romantic literature they'd read as children.

Byron, Keats and Shelley all wrote for the stage, but with little success in England, with Shelley's ''[[The Cenci]]'' perhaps the best work produced, though that was not played in a public theatre in England until a century after his death. Byron's plays, along with dramatizations of his poems and Scott's novels, were much more popular on the Continent, and especially in France, and through these versions several were turned into operas, many still performed today.  If contemporary poets had little success on the stage, the period was a legendary one for performances of [[Shakespeare]], and went some way to restoring his original texts and removing the Augustan "improvements" to them. The greatest actor of the period, [[Edmund Kean]], restored the tragic ending to ''[[King Lear]]'';&lt;ref&gt;Or at least he tried to; Kean played the tragic Lear for a few performances. They were not well received, and with regret, he reverted to [[Nahum Tate]]'s version with a comic ending, which had been standard since 1689. See [[Stanley Wells]], "Introduction" from ''King Lear'' Oxford University Press, 2000, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Coleridge said that, "Seeing him act was like reading Shakespeare by flashes of lightning."&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge, Samuel Taylor]], ''Table Talk'', 27 April 1823 in {{cite book|last1=Coleridge|first1=Samuel Taylor|last2=Morley|first2=Henry|title=Table Talk of Samuel Taylor Coleridge and The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, Christobel, &amp;amp;c |publisher=Routledge|location=New York|year=1884|page=38|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OJIRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although after [[Acts of Union 1707|union with England]] in 1707 Scotland increasingly adopted English language and wider cultural norms, its literature developed a distinct national identity and began to enjoy an international reputation. [[Allan Ramsay (poet)|Allan Ramsay]] (1686–1758) laid the foundations of a reawakening of interest in older Scottish literature, as well as leading the trend for pastoral poetry, helping to develop the [[Habbie stanza]] as a [[poetic form]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Buchan, ''Crowded with Genius'' (London: Harper Collins, 2003), {{ISBN|0060558881}}, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Macpherson]] (1736–96) was the first Scottish poet to gain an international reputation. Claiming to have found poetry written by the ancient bard [[Ossian]], he published translations that acquired international popularity, being proclaimed as a Celtic equivalent of the [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] [[Epic poetry|epics]]. ''Fingal'', written in 1762, was speedily translated into many European languages, and its appreciation of natural beauty and treatment of the ancient legend has been credited more than any single work with bringing about the Romantic movement in European, and especially in German literature, through its influence on [[Johann Gottfried von Herder]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Buchan, ''Crowded with Genius'' (London: Harper Collins, 2003), {{ISBN|0060558881}}, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also popularised in France by figures that included [[Napoleon]].&lt;ref&gt;H. Gaskill, ''The Reception of Ossian in Europe'' (Continuum, 2004), {{ISBN|0826461352}}, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually it became clear that the poems were not direct translations from the Gaelic, but flowery adaptations made to suit the aesthetic expectations of his audience.&lt;ref&gt;D. Thomson, ''The Gaelic Sources of Macpherson's "Ossian"'' (Aberdeen: Oliver &amp; Boyd, 1952).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Burns]] (1759–96) and [[Walter Scott]] (1771–1832) were highly influenced by the Ossian cycle. Burns, an Ayrshire poet and lyricist, is widely regarded as the [[national poet]] of Scotland and a major influence on the Romantic movement. His poem (and song) "[[Auld Lang Syne]]" is often sung at [[Hogmanay]] (the last day of the year), and "[[Scots Wha Hae]]" served for a long time as an unofficial [[national anthem]] of the country.&lt;ref&gt;L. McIlvanney, "Hugh Blair, Robert Burns, and the Invention of Scottish Literature", ''Eighteenth-Century Life'', vol. 29 (2), Spring 2005, pp. 25–46.&lt;/ref&gt; Scott began as a poet and also collected and published Scottish ballads. His first prose work, ''[[Waverley (novel)|Waverley]]'' in 1814, is often called the first historical novel.&lt;ref&gt;K. S. Whetter, ''Understanding Genre and Medieval Romance'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2008), {{ISBN|0754661423}}, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; It launched a highly successful career, with other historical novels such as ''[[Rob Roy (novel)|Rob Roy]]'' (1817), ''[[The Heart of Midlothian]]'' (1818) and ''[[Ivanhoe]]'' (1820). Scott probably did more than any other figure to define and popularise Scottish cultural identity in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;N. Davidson, ''The Origins of Scottish Nationhood'' (Pluto Press, 2008), {{ISBN|0745316085}}, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Other major literary figures connected with Romanticism include the poets and novelists [[James Hogg]] (1770–1835), [[Allan Cunningham (author)|Allan Cunningham]] (1784–1842) and [[John Galt (novelist)|John Galt]] (1779–1839).&lt;ref&gt;A. Maunder, ''FOF Companion to the British Short Story'' (Infobase Publishing, 2007), {{ISBN|0816074968}}, p. 374.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most significant figures of the Romantic movement, [[Lord Byron]], was brought up in Scotland until he inherited his family's [[Baron Byron|English peerage]].&lt;ref&gt;P.

[[File:Sir Henry Raeburn - Portrait of Sir Walter Scott.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Henry Raeburn|Raeburn's]] portrait of [[Walter Scott]] in 1822]]  Scotland was also the location of two of the most important literary magazines of the era, ''[[The Edinburgh Review]]'' (founded in 1802) and ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]'' (founded in 1817), which had a major impact on the development of British literature and drama in the era of Romanticism.&lt;ref&gt;A.

Scottish "national drama" emerged in the early 1800s, as plays with specifically Scottish themes began to dominate the Scottish stage. Theatres had been discouraged by the [[Church of Scotland]] and fears of Jacobite assemblies. In the later eighteenth century, many plays were written for and performed by small amateur companies and were not published and so most have been lost. Towards the end of the century there were "[[closet dramas]]", primarily designed to be read, rather than performed, including work by Scott, Hogg, Galt and [[Joanna Baillie]] (1762–1851), often influenced by the ballad tradition and [[Gothic literature|Gothic]] Romanticism.&lt;ref name=Brown2007pp229-30&gt;I.

===France===
Romanticism was relatively late in developing [[19th-century French literature#Romanticism|in French literature]], more so than in the visual arts. The 18th-century precursor to Romanticism, the cult of sensibility, had become associated with the [[Ancien regime]], and the French Revolution had been more of an inspiration to foreign writers than those experiencing it at first-hand. The first major figure was [[François-René de Chateaubriand]], a minor aristocrat who had remained a royalist throughout the Revolution, and returned to France from exile in England and America under Napoleon, with whose regime he had an uneasy relationship. His writings, all in prose, included some fiction, such as his influential [[novella]] of exile ''[[René (novella)|René]]'' (1802), which anticipated Byron in its alienated hero, but mostly contemporary history and politics, his travels, a defence of religion and the medieval spirit (''[[Génie du christianisme]]'' 1802), and finally in the 1830s and 1840s his enormous [[autobiography]] ''[[Mémoires d'Outre-Tombe]]'' ("Memoirs from beyond the grave").&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen, 202–03, 241–42.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Jean-Jacques Grandville - Frenzied Romans at the First Performance of Hernani - WGA10359.jpg|thumb|The "battle of ''[[Hernani (drama)|Hernani]]''" was fought nightly at the theatre in 1830]]
After the [[Bourbon Restoration]], French Romanticism developed in the lively world of [[Theatre of France#19th century|Parisian theatre]], with productions of [[Shakespeare]], Schiller (in France a key Romantic author), and adaptations of Scott and Byron alongside French authors, several of whom began to write in the late 1820s. Cliques of pro- and anti-Romantics developed, and productions were often accompanied by raucous vocalizing by the two sides, including the shouted assertion by one theatregoer in 1822 that "Shakespeare, c'est l'aide-de-camp de Wellington" ("Shakespeare is [[Duke of Wellington|Wellington's]] [[aide-de-camp]]").&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen, 239–46, 240 quoted.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexandre Dumas]] began as a dramatist, with a series of successes beginning with ''Henri III et sa cour'' (1829) before turning to novels that were mostly historical adventures somewhat in the manner of Scott, most famously ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'' and ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'', both of 1844. [[Victor Hugo]] published as a poet in the 1820s before achieving success on the stage with ''[[Hernani (drama)|Hernani]]''—a historical drama in a quasi-Shakespearian style that had famously riotous performances on its first run in 1830.&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen, 244–46.&lt;/ref&gt; Like Dumas, Hugo is best known for his novels, and was already writing ''[[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame]]'' (1831), one of the best known works, which became a paradigm of the French Romantic movement. The preface to his unperformed play "Cromwell" gives an important manifesto of French Romanticism, stating that "there are no rules, or models". The career of [[Prosper Mérimée]] followed a similar pattern; he is now best known as the originator of the story of ''[[Carmen (novella)|Carmen]]'', with his novella published 1845. [[Alfred de Vigny]] remains best known as a dramatist, with his play on the life of the English poet ''Chatterton'' (1835) perhaps his best work. [[George Sand]] was a central figure of the Parisian literary scene, famous both for her novels and criticism and her affairs with [[Chopin]] and several others;&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen&lt;/ref&gt; she too was inspired by the theatre, and wrote works to be staged at her [[House of George Sand|private estate]].

French Romantic poets of the 1830s to 1850s include [[Alfred de Musset]], [[Gérard de Nerval]], [[Alphonse de Lamartine]] and the flamboyant [[Théophile Gautier]], whose prolific output in various forms continued until his death in 1872.

[[Stendhal]] is today probably the most highly regarded French novelist of the period, but he stands in a complex relation with Romanticism, and is notable for his penetrating psychological insight into his characters and his realism, qualities rarely prominent in Romantic fiction. As a survivor of the French [[retreat from Moscow]] in 1812, fantasies of heroism and adventure had little appeal for him, and like Goya he is often seen as a forerunner of Realism. His most important works are ''Le Rouge et le Noir'' (''[[The Red and the Black]]'', 1830) and ''La Chartreuse de Parme'' (''[[The Charterhouse of Parma]]'', 1839).

=== Poland ===
[[File:Adam Mickiewicz.PNG|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Portrait of Adam Mickiewicz on the Ayu-Dag Cliff|''Adam Mickiewicz on the Ayu-Dag'']], by [[Walenty Wańkowicz]], 1828]]
{{Main|Romanticism in Poland}}
[[Romanticism in Poland]] is often taken to begin with the publication of [[Adam Mickiewicz]]'s first poems in 1822, and end with the crushing of the [[January Uprising]] of 1863 against the Russians. It was strongly marked by interest in Polish history.&lt;ref&gt;Leon Dyczewski, ''Values in the Polish cultural tradition'' (2002) p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; Polish Romanticism revived the old "Sarmatism" traditions of the ''[[szlachta]]'' or Polish nobility. Old traditions and customs were revived and portrayed in a positive light in the Polish messianic movement and in works of great Polish poets such as Adam Mickiewicz (''[[Pan Tadeusz]]''), [[Juliusz Słowacki]] and [[Zygmunt Krasiński]], as well as prose writers such as [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]]. This close connection between Polish Romanticism and Polish history became one of the defining qualities of the literature of [[Romanticism in Poland|Polish Romanticism]] period, differentiating it from that of other countries. They had not suffered the loss of national statehood as was the case with Poland.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher J. Murray, ''Encyclopedia of the romantic era, 1760–1850'' (2004) vol. 2. p. 742&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by the general spirit and main ideas of European Romanticism, the literature of Polish Romanticism is unique, as many scholars have pointed out, in having developed largely outside of Poland and in its emphatic focus upon the issue of Polish [[nationalism]]. The Polish intelligentsia, along with leading members of its government, left Poland in the early 1830s, during what is referred to as the "[[Great Emigration]]", resettling in France, Germany, Great Britain, Turkey, and the United States.
[[File:Juliusz Słowacki 1.PNG|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Juliusz Słowacki]], a Polish poet considered one of the [[Three Bards|"Three National Bards" of Polish literature]]—a major figure in the Polish Romantic period, and the father of modern Polish drama.]]
Their art featured [[wikt:emotionalism|emotionalism]] and [[Irrationalism and Aestheticism|irrationality]], fantasy and imagination, personality cults, [[folklore]] and country life, and the propagation of ideals of freedom. In the second period, many of the [[Polish Romantics]] worked abroad, often banished from Poland by the occupying powers due to their politically subversive ideas. Their work became increasingly dominated by the ideals of political struggle for freedom and their country's [[sovereignty]]. Elements of mysticism became more prominent. There developed the idea of the ''[[Three Bards|poeta wieszcz]]'' (the prophet). The ''[[wieszcz]]'' (bard) functioned as spiritual leader to the nation fighting for its independence. The most notable poet so recognized was [[Adam Mickiewicz]].

[[Zygmunt Krasiński|Zygmunt Krasinski]] also wrote to inspire political and religious hope in his countrymen. Unlike his predecessors, who called for victory at whatever price in Poland's struggle against Russia, Krasinski emphasized Poland's [[Spirituality|spiritual]] role in its fight for independence, advocating an intellectual rather than a military superiority. His works best exemplify the [[Messianism|Messianic movement in Poland]]: in two early dramas, ''Nie-boska komedyia''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Nie-Boska komedia|url = https://pl.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nie-Boska_komedia&amp;oldid=41481531|language = pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1835; ''The Undivine Comedy)'' and ''[[Irydion]]'' (1836; ''Iridion)'', as well as in the later ''Psalmy przyszłości'' (1845), he asserted that Poland was the [[Christ of Europe]]: specifically chosen by God to carry the world's burdens, to suffer, and eventually be resurrected.

=== Russia ===
Early Russian Romanticism is associated with the writers [[Konstantin Batyushkov]] (''A Vision on the Shores of the Lethe'', 1809), [[Vasily Zhukovsky]] (''The Bard'', 1811; ''Svetlana'', 1813) and [[Nikolay Karamzin]] (''Poor Liza'', 1792; ''Julia'', 1796; ''Martha the Mayoress'', 1802; ''The Sensitive and the Cold'', 1803). However the principal exponent of Romanticism in Russia is [[Alexander Pushkin]] (''[[The Prisoner of the Caucasus (poem)|The Prisoner of the Caucasus]]'', 1820–1821; ''The Robber Brothers'', 1822; ''[[Ruslan and Ludmila]]'', 1820; ''[[Eugene Onegin]]'', 1825–1832). Pushkin's work influenced many writers in the 19th century and led to his eventual recognition as Russia's greatest poet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faculty.virginia.edu/dostoevsky/texts/devil_pushkinbio.html|title=Alexander Sergeevich Pushkin (1799–1837) |publisher=University of Virginia Slavic Department|accessdate=1 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Russian Romantic poets include [[Mikhail Lermontov]] (''[[A Hero of Our Time]]'', 1839), [[Fyodor Tyutchev]] (''Silentium!'', 1830), [[Yevgeny Baratynsky]] (''Eda'', 1826), [[Anton Delvig]], and [[Wilhelm Küchelbecker]].

Influenced heavily by Lord Byron, Lermontov sought to explore the Romantic emphasis on metaphysical discontent with society and self, while Tyutchev's poems often described scenes of nature or passions of love. Tyutchev commonly operated with such categories as night and day, north and south, dream and reality, cosmos and chaos, and the still world of winter and spring teeming with life. Baratynsky's style was fairly classical in nature, dwelling on the models of the previous century.

===Spain===
{{Main|Romanticism in Spanish literature}}
[[File:José de Espronceda (detalle).jpg|thumb|upright|''[[El escritor José de Espronceda]]'', [[portrait]] by [[Antonio María Esquivel]] ({{circa|1845}}) ([[Museo del Prado]], [[Madrid]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=El escritor José de Espronceda |url=https://www.museodelprado.es/coleccion/obra-de-arte/jose-de-espronceda/e97beaab-f0a3-4f73-8302-1c8185110410 |access-date=March 27, 2013 |website=[[Museo del Prado]] |location=Madrid |language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Romanticism in Spanish literature]] developed a well-known literature with a huge variety of poets and playwrights. The most important Spanish poet during this movement was [[José de Espronceda]]. After him there were other poets like [[Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer]], [[Mariano José de Larra]] and the dramatists [[Ángel de Saavedra]] and [[José Zorrilla]], author of ''[[Don Juan Tenorio]]''. Before them may be mentioned the pre-romantics [[José Cadalso]] and [[Manuel José Quintana]].&lt;ref&gt;Philip W. Silver, ''Ruin and restitution: reinterpreting romanticism in Spain'' (1997) p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;  The plays of [[Antonio García Gutiérrez]] were adapted to produce Giuseppe Verdi's operas ''[[Il trovatore]]'' and ''[[Simon Boccanegra]]''. Spanish Romanticism also influenced regional literatures. For example, in [[Catalonia]] and in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] there was a national boom of writers in the local languages, like the Catalan [[Jacint Verdaguer]] and the Galician [[Rosalía de Castro]], the main figures of the [[Romantic nationalism|national revivalist]] movements [[Renaixença]] and [[Rexurdimento]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Brenan, ''The literature of the Spanish people: from Roman times to the present'' (1965) p. 364&lt;/ref&gt;

There are scholars who consider Spanish Romanticism to be Proto-Existentialism because it is more anguished than the movement in other European countries. Foster et al., for example, say that the work of Spain's writers such as Espronceda, Larra, and other writers in the 19th century demonstrated a "metaphysical crisis".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Spanish Literature : Current debates on Hispanism|last=Foster|first=David|last2=Altamiranda|first2=Daniel|last3=de Urioste|first3=Carmen|publisher=Garland Publishing, Inc.|year=2001|isbn=978-0815335634|location=New York|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; These observers put more weight on the link between the 19th-century Spanish writers with the existentialist movement that emerged immediately after. According to Richard Caldwell, the writers that we now identify with Spain's romanticism were actually precursors to those who galvanized the literary movement that emerged in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caldwell|first=Richard|date=1970|title=The Persistence of Romantic Thought in Spain|url=|journal=Modern Language Review|volume=65|pages=803–12|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This notion is the subject of debate for there are authors who stress that Spain's romanticism is one of the earliest in Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=El primer romantico 'europeo' de España|last=Sebold|first=Russell|publisher=Editorial Gredos|year=1974|isbn=978-8424905910|location=Madrid|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while some assert that Spain really had no period of literary romanticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shaw|first=Donald|date=1963|title=Towards an Understanding of Spanish Romanticism|url=|journal=Modern Language Review|volume=58|pages=190–95|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This controversy underscores a certain uniqueness to Spanish romanticism in comparison to its European counterparts.

===Portugal===
[[File:Almeida Garrett - litografia sobre papel.png|thumb|upright|Portuguese poet, novelist, politician and playwright [[Almeida Garrett]] (1799–1854)]]
Romanticism began in [[Portugal]] with the publication of the poem ''Camões'' (1825), by [[Almeida Garrett]], who was raised by his uncle D. Alexandre, bishop of [[Angra do Heroísmo|Angra]], in the precepts of [[Neoclassicism]], which can be observed in his early work. The author himself confesses (in ''Camões''' preface) that he voluntarily refused to follow the principles of epic poetry enunciated by [[Aristotle]] in his [[Poetics (Aristotle)|''Poetics'']], as he did the same to [[Horace]]'s [[Ars Poetica (Horace)|''Ars Poetica'']]. Almeida Garrett had participated in the [[Liberal Revolution of 1820|1820 Liberal Revolution]], which caused him to exile himself in England in 1823 and then in France, after the [[Vilafrancada|Vila-Francada]]. While living in Great Britain, he had contacts with the Romantic movement and read authors such as [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], Scott, Ossian, Byron, Hugo, Lamartine and de Staël, at the same time visiting feudal castles and ruins of [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] churches and abbeys, which would be reflected in his writings. In 1838, he presented ''Um Auto de Gil Vicente'' ("A Play by [[Gil Vicente]]"), in an attempt to create a new national theatre, free of Greco-Roman and foreign influence. But his masterpiece would be ''Frei Luís de Sousa'' (1843), named by himself as a "Romantic drama" and it was acclaimed as an exceptional work, dealing with themes as national independence, faith, justice and love. He was also deeply interested in Portuguese folkloric verse, which resulted in the publication of ''Romanceiro'' ("Traditional Portuguese Ballads") (1843), that recollect a great number of ancient popular ballads, known as "romances" or "rimances", in ''redondilha maior'' verse form, that contained stories of [[chivalry]], life of [[saint]]s, [[crusades]], [[courtly love]], etc. He wrote the novels ''Viagens na Minha Terra'', ''O Arco de Sant'Ana'' and ''Helena.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Obras Completas de Almeida Garrett – 2 Volumes|last=Almeida Garrett|first=João Baptista|publisher=Lello Editores|year=1990|isbn=978-9724801926|location=Porto|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.infopedia.pt/$almeida-garrett|title=Artigo de apoio Infopédia – Almeida Garrett|last=Infopédia|website=Infopédia – Dicionários Porto Editora|language=pt-PT|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="José"&gt;{{Cite book|title=História da literatura portuguesa|last=José.|first=Saraiva, António|date=1996|publisher=Porto Editora|others=Lopes, Oscar|isbn=978-9720301703|edition= 17a|location=[Porto, Portugal]|oclc=35124986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexandre Herculano]] is, alongside Almeida Garrett, one of the founders of Portuguese Romanticism. He too was forced to exile to Great Britain and France because of his [[Liberalism|liberal]] ideals. All of his poetry and prose are (unlike Almeida Garrett's) entirely Romantic, rejecting [[Classical mythology|Greco-Roman myth]] and history.&lt;ref&gt;file:///C:/Users/Utilizador/Downloads/portoeditora_herculano_aharpacrente.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; He sought inspiration in medieval Portuguese poems and [[chronicle]]s as in the [[Bible]]. His output is vast and covers many different genres, such as historical essays, poetry, novels, opuscules and theatre, where he brings back a whole world of Portuguese legends, tradition and history, especially in ''Eurico, o Presbítero'' ("Eurico, the Priest") and ''Lendas e Narrativas'' ("Legends and Narratives"). His work was influenced by Chateaubriand, Schiller, [[Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock|Klopstock]], Walter Scott and the Old Testament [[Psalms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.infopedia.pt/$alexandre-herculano|title=Artigo de apoio Infopédia – Alexandre Herculano|last=Infopédia|website=Infopédia – Dicionários Porto Editora|language=pt-PT|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[António Feliciano de Castilho]] made the case for [[Ultra-Romanticism]], publishing the poems ''A Noite no Castelo'' ("Night in the Castle") and ''Os Ciúmes do Bardo'' ("The Jealousy of the Bard"), both in 1836, and the drama ''Camões''. He became an unquestionable master for successive Ultra-Romantic generations, whose influence would not be challenged until the famous Coimbra Question. He also created polemics by translating [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]'s ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'' without knowing German, but using French versions of the play. Other notable figures of Portuguese Romanticism are the famous novelists [[Camilo Castelo Branco]] and [[Júlio Dinis]], and [[António Augusto Soares de Passos|Soares de Passos]], Bulhão Pato and Pinheiro Chagas.&lt;ref name="José"/&gt;

Romantic style would be revived in the beginning of the 20th century, notably through the works of poets linked to the Portuguese Renaissance (Renascença Portuguesa), such as [[Teixeira de Pascoaes|Teixeira de Pascoais]], [[Jaime Cortesão]], Mário Beirão, among others, who can be considered Neo-Romantics. An early Portuguese expression of Romanticism is found already in poets such as [[Manuel Maria Barbosa du Bocage]] (especially in his sonnets dated at the end of the 18th century) and [[Leonor de Almeida Portugal, 4th Marquise of Alorna|Leonor de Almeida Portugal, Marquise of Alorna]].&lt;ref name="José"/&gt;

Romanticism in Italian literature was a minor movement, yet still important; it began officially in 1816 when [[Germaine de Staël]] wrote an article in the journal ''Biblioteca italiana'' called "Sulla maniera e l'utilità delle traduzioni", inviting Italian people to reject [[Neoclassicism]] and to study new authors from other countries. Before that date, [[Ugo Foscolo]] had already published poems anticipating Romantic themes. The most important Romantic writers were [[Ludovico di Breme]], Pietro Borsieri and [[Giovanni Berchet]]. Better known authors such as [[Alessandro Manzoni]] and [[Giacomo Leopardi]] were influenced by [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] as well as by Romanticism and Classicism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=La nuova enciclopedia della letteratura|publisher=Garzanti|location=Milan|year=1985|page=829}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spanish-speaking South American Romanticism was influenced heavily by [[Esteban Echeverría]], who wrote in the 1830 and 1840s. His writings were influenced by his hatred for the Argentine dictator [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]], and filled with themes of blood and terror, using the metaphor of a slaughterhouse to portray the violence of Rosas' dictatorship.

Brazilian Romanticism is characterized and divided in three different periods. The first one is basically focused on the creation of a sense of national identity, using the ideal of the heroic Indian. Some examples include [[José de Alencar]], who wrote ''[[Iracema]]'' and ''[[The Guarani|O Guarani]]'', and [[Gonçalves Dias]], renowned by the poem "[[Canção do exílio]]" (Song of the Exile). The second period, sometimes called [[Ultra-Romanticism]], is marked by a profound influence of European themes and traditions, involving the melancholy, sadness and despair related to unobtainable love. Goethe and Lord Byron are commonly quoted in these works. Some of the most notable authors of this phase are [[Álvares de Azevedo]], [[Casimiro de Abreu]], [[Fagundes Varela]] and [[Junqueira Freire]]. The third cycle is marked by social poetry, especially the abolitionist movement, and it includes [[Castro Alves]], [[Tobias Barreto]] and [[Pedro Luís Pereira de Sousa]].&lt;ref&gt;Roberto González Echevarría and Enrique Pupo-Walker, ''The Cambridge History of Latin American Literature: Brazilian Literature'' (1996) vol. 2 p. 367&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, at least by 1818 with William Cullen Bryant's "[[To a Waterfowl]]", Romantic poetry was being published. American Romantic [[Gothic literature]] made an early appearance with [[Washington Irving]]'s ''[[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]'' (1820) and ''[[Rip Van Winkle]]'' (1819), followed from 1823 onwards by the ''[[Leatherstocking Tales]]'' of [[James Fenimore Cooper]], with their emphasis on heroic simplicity and their fervent landscape descriptions of an already-exotic mythicized frontier peopled by "[[noble savage]]s", similar to the philosophical theory of [[Rousseau]], exemplified by [[Uncas]], from ''[[The Last of the Mohicans]]''. There are picturesque "local color" elements in Washington Irving's essays and especially his travel books. [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s tales of the macabre and his balladic poetry were more influential in France than at home, but the romantic American novel developed fully with the atmosphere and [[melodrama]] of [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]'' (1850). Later [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalist]] writers such as [[Henry David Thoreau]] and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] still show elements of its influence and imagination, as does the [[romantic realism]] of [[Walt Whitman]]. The poetry of [[Emily Dickinson]]—nearly unread in her own time—and [[Herman Melville]]'s novel ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' can be taken as epitomes of American Romantic literature. By the 1880s, however, psychological and [[social realism]] were competing with Romanticism in the novel.

====Influence of European Romanticism on American writers====
The European Romantic movement reached America in the early 19th century. American Romanticism was just as multifaceted and individualistic as it was in Europe. Like the Europeans, the American Romantics demonstrated a high level of moral enthusiasm, commitment to individualism and the unfolding of the self, an emphasis on intuitive perception, and the assumption that the natural world was inherently good, while human society was filled with corruption.&lt;ref name="George L 1997 p 613"&gt;George L. McMichael and Frederick C. Crews, eds. ''Anthology of American Literature: Colonial through romantic'' (6th ed. 1997) p. 613&lt;/ref&gt;

Romanticism became popular in American politics, philosophy and art. The movement appealed to the revolutionary spirit of America as well as to those longing to break free of the strict religious traditions of early settlement. The Romantics rejected rationalism and religious intellect. It appealed to those in opposition of Calvinism, which includes the belief that the destiny of each individual is preordained. The Romantic movement gave rise to [[New England]] [[Transcendentalism]], which portrayed a less restrictive relationship between God and Universe. The new philosophy presented the individual with a more personal relationship with God. Transcendentalism and Romanticism appealed to Americans in a similar fashion, for both privileged feeling over reason, individual freedom of expression over the restraints of tradition and custom. It often involved a rapturous response to nature. It encouraged the rejection of harsh, rigid Calvinism, and promised a new blossoming of American culture.&lt;ref name="George L 1997 p 613"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Romanticism, American", in ''The Oxford Dictionary of American Art and Artists'' ed by Ann Lee Morgan (Oxford University Press, 2007) [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t238.e1140 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

American Romanticism embraced the individual and rebelled against the confinement of neoclassicism and religious tradition. The Romantic movement in America created a new literary genre that continues to influence American writers. Novels, short stories, and poems replaced the sermons and manifestos of yore. Romantic literature was personal, intense, and portrayed more emotion than ever seen in neoclassical literature. America's preoccupation with freedom became a great source of motivation for Romantic writers as many were delighted in free expression and emotion without so much fear of ridicule and controversy. They also put more effort into the psychological development of their characters, and the main characters typically displayed extremes of sensitivity and excitement.&lt;ref&gt;The relationship of the American poet Wallace Stevens to Romanticism is raised in the poem "[[Another Weeping Woman]]" and its commentary.&lt;/ref&gt;

The works of the Romantic Era also differed from preceding works in that they spoke to a wider audience, partly reflecting the greater distribution of books as costs came down during the period.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[File:The Bard (1774).jpeg|thumb|largethumb|[[Thomas Jones (artist)|Thomas Jones]], ''The Bard'', 1774, a prophetic combination of Romanticism and nationalism by the Welsh artist]]

In the visual arts, Romanticism first showed itself in [[landscape painting]], where from as early as the 1760s British artists began to turn to wilder landscapes and storms, and [[Gothic architecture]], even if they had to make do with [[Welsh art|Wales as a setting]]. [[Caspar David Friedrich]] and [[J. M. W. Turner]] were born less than a year apart in 1774 and 1775 respectively and were to take German and English landscape painting to their extremes of Romanticism, but both their artistic sensibilities were formed when forms of Romanticism was already strongly present in art. [[John Constable]], born in 1776, stayed closer to the English landscape tradition, but in his largest "six-footers" insisted on the heroic status of a patch of the working countryside where he had grown up—challenging the traditional [[hierarchy of genres]], which relegated landscape painting to a low status. Turner also painted very large landscapes, and above all, seascapes. Some of these large paintings had contemporary settings and [[staffage]], but others had small figures that turned the work into [[history painting]] in the manner of [[Claude Lorrain]], like [[Salvator Rosa]] a [[late Baroque]] artist whose landscapes had elements that Romantic painters repeatedly turned to.  Friedrich often used single figures, or features like crosses, set alone amidst a huge landscape, "making them images of the transitoriness of human life and the premonition of death."&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 96–101, 99 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

Other groups of artists expressed feelings that verged on the mystical, many largely abandoning classical drawing and proportions.  These included [[William Blake]] and [[Samuel Palmer]] and the other members of [[Ancients (art group)|the Ancients]] in England, and in Germany [[Philipp Otto Runge]]. Like Friedrich, none of these artists had significant influence after their deaths for the rest of the 19th century, and were 20th century rediscoveries from obscurity, though Blake was always known as a poet, and Norway's leading painter [[Johan Christian Dahl]] was heavily influenced by Friedrich. The Rome-based [[Nazarene movement]] of German artists, active from 1810, took a very different path, concentrating on medievalizing history paintings with religious and nationalist themes.&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 112–21&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Anne-Louis Girodet-Trioson 001.jpg|thumb|left|[[Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson]], ''[[Ossian]] receiving the Ghosts of the French Heroes'', 1800–02]]

The arrival of Romanticism in French art was delayed by the strong hold of [[Neoclassicism]] on the academies, but from the [[Napoleonic]] period it became increasingly popular, initially in the form of history paintings propagandising for the new regime, of which [[Girodet]]'s ''[[Ossian]] receiving the Ghosts of the French Heroes'', for Napoleon's [[Château de Malmaison]], was one of the earliest.  Girodet's old teacher [[Jacques-Louis David|David]] was puzzled and disappointed by his pupil's direction, saying: "Either Girodet is mad or I no longer know anything of the art of painting".&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 184–190, 187 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;  A new generation of the French school,&lt;ref&gt;Walter Friedlaender, ''From David to Delacroix'', 1974, remains the best available account of the subject.&lt;/ref&gt; developed personal Romantic styles, though still concentrating on history painting with a political message. [[Théodore Géricault]] (1791–1824) had his first success with ''[[The Charging Chasseur]]'', a heroic military figure derived from [[Rubens]], at the [[Paris Salon]] of 1812 in the years of the Empire, but his next major completed work, ''[[The Raft of the Medusa]]'' of 1821, remains the greatest achievement of the Romantic history painting, which in its day had a powerful anti-government message.

[[Eugène Delacroix]] (1798–1863) made his first Salon hits with ''[[The Barque of Dante]]'' (1822), ''[[The Massacre at Chios]]'' (1824) and ''[[Death of Sardanapalus]]'' (1827). The second was a scene from the Greek War of Independence, completed the year Byron died there, and the last was a scene from one of Byron's plays. With Shakespeare, Byron was to provide the subject matter for many other works of Delacroix, who also spent long periods in North Africa, painting colourful scenes of mounted Arab warriors. His ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' (1830) remains, with the ''Medusa'', one of the best-known works of French Romantic painting. Both reflected current events, and increasingly "[[history painting]]", literally "story painting", a phrase dating back to the Italian Renaissance meaning the painting of subjects with groups of figures, long considered the highest and most difficult form of art, did indeed become the painting of historical scenes, rather than those from religion or mythology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/roma/hd_roma.htm|title=Romanticism|website=metmuseum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francisco Goya]] was called "the last great painter in whose art thought and observation were balanced and combined to form a faultless unity".&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 142&lt;/ref&gt;  But the extent to which he was a Romantic is a complex question. In Spain, there was still a struggle to introduce the values of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], in which Goya saw himself as a participant.  The demonic and anti-rational monsters thrown up by his imagination are only superficially similar to those of the Gothic fantasies of northern Europe, and in many ways he remained wedded to the classicism and realism of his training, as well as looking forward to the Realism of the later 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 133–42&lt;/ref&gt; But he, more than any other artist of the period, exemplified the Romantic values of the expression of the artist's feelings and his personal imaginative world.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, 279–80&lt;/ref&gt;  He also shared with many of the Romantic painters a more free handling of paint, emphasized in the new prominence of the brushstroke and [[impasto]], which tended to be repressed in neoclassicism under a self-effacing finish.

[[Sculpture]] remained largely impervious to Romanticism, probably partly for technical reasons, as the most prestigious material of the day, marble, does not lend itself to expansive gestures. The leading sculptors in Europe, [[Antonio Canova]] and [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]], were both based in Rome and firm Neoclassicists, not at all tempted to allow influence from medieval sculpture, which would have been one possible approach to Romantic sculpture. When it did develop, true Romantic sculpture—with the exception of a few artists such as [[Rudolf Maison]]—&lt;ref&gt;McKay, James, ''The Dictionary of Sculptors in Bronze'', Antique Collectors Club, London, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; rather oddly was missing in Germany, and mainly found in France, with [[François Rude]], best known from his group of the 1830s from the [[Arc de Triomphe]] in Paris, [[David d'Angers]], and [[Auguste Préault]]. Préault's plaster relief entitled ''Slaughter'', which represented the horrors of wars with exacerbated passion, caused so much scandal at the 1834 [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] that Préault was banned from this official annual exhibition for nearly twenty years.&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 397, 379–84&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy, the most important Romantic sculptor was [[Lorenzo Bartolini]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dizionario di arte e letteratura|publisher=Zanichelli|location=Bologna|year=2002|page=544}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, historical painting on idealized medieval and Renaissance themes is known as the [[Troubadour style|''style Troubadour'']], a term with no equivalent for other countries, though the same trends occurred there. Delacroix, [[Ingres]] and [[Richard Parkes Bonington]] all worked in this style, as did lesser specialists such as [[Pierre-Henri Révoil]] (1776–1842) and [[Fleury-François Richard]] (1777–1852). Their pictures are often small, and feature intimate private and anecdotal moments, as well as those of high drama. The lives of great artists such as [[Raphael]] were commemorated on equal terms with those of rulers, and fictional characters were also depicted. Fleury-Richard's ''Valentine of Milan weeping for the death of her husband'', shown in the [[Paris Salon]] of 1802, marked the arrival of the style, which lasted until the mid-century, before being subsumed into the increasingly academic history painting of artists like [[Paul Delaroche]].&lt;ref&gt;Noon, throughout, especially pp. 124–155&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Hayez, Fracesco - Crusaders Thirsting near Jerusalem - 1836-50.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Francesco Hayez]], ''Crusaders Thirsting near Jerusalem'']]

Another trend was for very large apocalyptic history paintings, often combining extreme natural events, or divine wrath, with human disaster, attempting to outdo ''The Raft of the Medusa'', and now often drawing comparisons with effects from Hollywood. The leading English artist in the style was [[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]], whose tiny figures were dwarfed by enormous earthquakes and storms, and worked his way through the biblical disasters, and those to come in the [[Christian eschatology|final days]]. Other works such as Delacroix's ''[[Death of Sardanapalus]]'' included larger figures, and these often drew heavily on earlier artists, especially [[Poussin]] and [[Rubens]], with extra emotionalism and special effects.

Elsewhere in Europe, leading artists adopted Romantic styles: in Russia there were the portraitists [[Orest Kiprensky]] and [[Vasily Tropinin]], with [[Ivan Aivazovsky]] specializing in [[marine painting]], and in Norway [[Hans Gude]] painted scenes of [[fjord]]s. In Italy [[Francesco Hayez]] (1791–1882) was the leading artist of Romanticism in mid-19th-century [[Milan]].  His long, prolific and extremely successful career saw him begin as a Neoclassical painter, pass right through the Romantic period, and emerge at the other end as a sentimental painter of young women. His Romantic period included many historical pieces of "Troubadour" tendencies, but on a very large scale, that are heavily influenced by [[Gian Battista Tiepolo]] and other [[late Baroque]] Italian masters.

Literary Romanticism had its counterpart in the American visual arts, most especially in the exaltation of an untamed American [[Landscape art|landscape]] found in the paintings of the [[Hudson River School]]. Painters like [[Thomas Cole]], [[Albert Bierstadt]] and [[Frederic Edwin Church]] and others often expressed Romantic themes in their paintings. They sometimes depicted ancient ruins of the old world, such as in Fredric Edwin Church's piece ''Sunrise in Syria''. These works reflected the Gothic feelings of death and decay. They also show the Romantic ideal that Nature is powerful and will eventually overcome the transient creations of men. More often, they worked to distinguish themselves from their European counterparts by depicting uniquely American scenes and landscapes. This idea of an American identity in the art world is reflected in [[W. C. Bryant]]'s poem, ''To Cole, the Painter, Departing for Europe'', where Bryant encourages Cole to remember the powerful scenes that can only be found in America.

Some American paintings (such as Albert Bierstadt's ''[[The Rocky Mountains, Lander's Peak]]'') promote the literary idea of the "[[noble savage]]" by portraying idealized Native Americans living in harmony with the natural world. Thomas Cole's paintings tend towards [[allegory]], explicit in ''[[The Voyage of Life]]'' series painted in the early 1840s, showing the stages of life set amidst an awesome and immense nature.

==Music==

[[File:Beethoven.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ludwig van Beethoven]], painted by [[Joseph Karl Stieler]], 1820]]
Musical Romanticism is predominantly a German phenomenon—so much so that one respected French reference work defines it entirely in terms of "The role of music in the aesthetics of German romanticism".&lt;ref&gt;Boyer 1961, 585.&lt;/ref&gt; Another French encyclopedia holds that the German temperament generally "can be described as the deep and diverse action of romanticism on German musicians", and that there is only one true representative of Romanticism in French music, [[Hector Berlioz]], while in Italy, the sole great name of musical Romanticism is [[Giuseppe Verdi]], "a sort of [Victor] Hugo of opera, gifted with a real genius for dramatic effect". Nevertheless, the huge popularity of German Romantic music led, "whether by imitation or by reaction", to an often nationalistically inspired vogue amongst Polish, Hungarian, Russian, Czech, and Scandinavian musicians, successful "perhaps more because of its extra-musical traits than for the actual value of musical works by its masters".&lt;ref&gt;Ferchault 1957.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the term "Romanticism" when applied to music has come to imply the period roughly from 1800 until 1850, or else until around 1900, the contemporary application of "romantic" to music did not coincide with this modern interpretation. Indeed, one of the earliest sustained applications of the term to music occurs in 1789, in the ''Mémoires'' of [[André Grétry]].&lt;ref&gt;Grétre 1789.&lt;/ref&gt; This is of particular interest because it is a French source on a subject mainly dominated by Germans, but also because it explicitly acknowledges its debt to [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] (himself a composer, amongst other things) and, by so doing, establishes a link to one of the major influences on the Romantic movement generally.&lt;ref name="Samson 2001"&gt;Samson 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1810 [[E.T.A. Hoffmann]] named [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] as "the three masters of instrumental compositions" who "breathe one and the same romantic spirit". He justified his view on the basis of these composers' depth of evocative expression and their marked individuality. In Haydn's music, according to Hoffmann, "a child-like, serene disposition prevails", while Mozart (in the late [[Symphony No. 39 (Mozart)|E-flat major Symphony]], for example) "leads us into the depths of the spiritual world", with elements of fear, love, and sorrow, "a presentiment of the infinite ... in the eternal dance of the spheres". Beethoven's music, on the other hand, conveys a sense of "the monstrous and immeasurable", with the pain of an endless longing that "will burst our breasts in a fully coherent concord of all the passions."&lt;ref&gt;Hoffmann 1810, col. 632.&lt;/ref&gt; This elevation in the valuation of pure emotion resulted in the promotion of music from the subordinate position it had held in relation to the verbal and plastic arts during the Enlightenment. Because music was considered to be free of the constraints of reason, imagery, or any other precise concept, it came to be regarded, first in the writings of [[Wilhelm Heinrich Wackenroder|Wackenroder]] and [[Ludwig Tieck|Tieck]] and later by writers such as [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]] and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], as preeminent among the arts, the one best able to express the secrets of the universe, to evoke the spirit world, infinity, and the absolute.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer 1961, 585–86.&lt;/ref&gt;

This chronologic agreement of musical and literary Romanticism continued as far as the middle of the 19th century, when [[Richard Wagner]] denigrated the music of [[Meyerbeer]] and [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]] as "[[Neoromanticism (music)|neoromantic]]": "The Opera, to which we shall now return, has swallowed down the Neoromanticism of Berlioz, too, as a plump, fine-flavoured oyster, whose digestion has conferred on it anew a brisk and well-to-do appearance."&lt;ref&gt;Wagner 1995, 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was only toward the end of the 19th century that the newly emergent discipline of ''Musikwissenschaft'' ([[musicology]])—itself a product of the historicizing proclivity of the age—attempted a more scientific [[periodization]] of music history, and a distinction between [[Classical period (music)|Viennese Classical]] and Romantic periods was proposed. The key figure in this trend was [[Guido Adler]], who viewed Beethoven and [[Franz Schubert]] as transitional but essentially Classical composers, with Romanticism achieving full maturity only in the post-Beethoven generation of [[Frédéric Chopin]], [[Robert Schumann]], Berlioz, and [[Franz Liszt]]. From Adler's viewpoint, found in books like ''Der Stil in der Musik'' (1911), composers of the [[New German School]] and various late-19th-century [[Musical nationalism|nationalist]] composers were not Romantics but "moderns" or "realists" (by analogy with the fields of painting and literature), and this schema remained prevalent through the first decades of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Samson 2001"/&gt;

By the second quarter of the 20th century, an awareness that radical changes in musical syntax had occurred during the early 1900s caused another shift in historical viewpoint, and the change of century came to be seen as marking a decisive break with the musical past. This in turn led historians such as [[Alfred Einstein]]&lt;ref&gt;Einstein 1947.&lt;/ref&gt; to extend the musical "[[Romantic music|Romantic Era]]" throughout the 19th century and into the first decade of the 20th. It has continued to be referred to as such in some of the standard music references such as ''[[The Oxford Companion to Music]]''&lt;ref&gt;Warrack 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Donald Jay Grout|Grout's]] ''History of Western Music''&lt;ref&gt;Grout 1960, 492.&lt;/ref&gt; but was not unchallenged. For example, the prominent German musicologist [[Friedrich Blume]], the chief editor of the first edition of ''[[Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart]]'' (1949–86), accepted the earlier position that Classicism and Romanticism together constitute a single period beginning in the middle of the 18th century, but at the same time held that it continued into the 20th century, including such pre–World War II developments as [[Expressionist music|expressionism]] and [[Neoclassicism (music)|neoclassicism]].&lt;ref&gt;Blume 1970; Samson 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; This is reflected in some notable recent reference works such as the ''[[New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]''&lt;ref name="Samson 2001"/&gt; and the new edition of ''[[Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Wehnert 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the contemporary music culture, the romantic musician followed a public career depending on sensitive middle-class audiences rather than on a courtly patron, as had been the case with earlier musicians and composers. Public persona characterized a new generation of virtuosi who made their way as soloists, epitomized in the concert tours of [[Paganini]] and [[Liszt]], and the conductor began to emerge as an important figure, on whose skill the interpretation of the increasingly complex music depended.&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen, 176–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sciences===
{{Main|Romanticism in science}}
The Romantic movement affected most aspects of intellectual life, and [[Romanticism in science|Romanticism and science]] had a powerful connection, especially in the period 1800–40. Many scientists were influenced by versions of the ''[[Naturphilosophie]]'' of [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] and others, and without abandoning [[empiricism]], sought in their work to uncover what they tended to believe was a unified and organic Nature. The English scientist Sir [[Humphry Davy]], a prominent Romantic thinker, said that understanding nature required "an attitude of admiration, love and worship, [...] a personal response."&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham, A., and Jardine, N., ed. ''Romanticism and the Sciences'', p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;  He believed that knowledge was only attainable by those who truly appreciated and respected nature.  Self-understanding was an important aspect of Romanticism.  It had less to do with proving that man was capable of understanding nature (through his budding intellect) and therefore controlling it, and more to do with the emotional appeal of connecting himself with nature and understanding it through a harmonious co-existence.&lt;ref&gt;Bossi, M., and Poggi, S., ed. ''Romanticism in Science: Science in Europe, 1790–1840'', p.xiv; Cunningham, A., and Jardine, N., ed. ''Romanticism and the Sciences'', p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historiography===
[[Historiography|History writing]] was very strongly, and many would say harmfully, influenced by Romanticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=E. Sreedharan|title=A Textbook of Historiography, 500 B.C. to A.D. 2000|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jJVoi3PIejwC&amp;pg=PR9|year=2004|publisher=Orient Blackswan|pages=128–68|isbn=978-8125026570}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In England [[Thomas Carlyle]] was a highly influential essayist who turned historian; he both invented and exemplified the phrase "hero-worship",&lt;ref&gt;in his published lectures ''[[On Heroes, Hero-Worship, and The Heroic in History]]'' of 1841&lt;/ref&gt; lavishing largely uncritical praise on strong leaders such as [[Oliver Cromwell]], [[Frederick the Great]] and Napoleon.  Romantic nationalism had a largely negative effect on the writing of history in the 19th century, as each nation tended to [[Historiography and nationalism|produce its own version of history]], and the critical attitude, even cynicism, of earlier historians was often replaced by a tendency to create romantic stories with clearly distinguished heroes and villains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ceri Crossley|title=French Historians and Romanticism: Thierry, Guizot, the Saint-Simonians, Quinet, Michelet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ovaIAgAAQBAJ|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1134976683}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Nationalist ideology of the period placed great emphasis on racial coherence, and the antiquity of peoples, and tended to vastly over-emphasize the continuity between past periods and the present, leading to [[national mysticism]].  Much historical effort in the 20th century was devoted to combating the romantic historical myths created in the 19th century.

===Theology===
To insulate theology from [[reductionism]] in science, 19th-century post-Enlightenment German theologians moved in a new direction, led by [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] and [[Albrecht Ritschl]]. They took the Romantic approach of rooting religion in the inner world of the human spirit, so that it is a person's feeling or sensibility about spiritual matters that comprises religion.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Clayton and Zachary Simpson, eds. ''The Oxford Handbook of Religion and Science'' (2006) p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chess===

{{main| Romantic chess}}

The "[[Immortal Game]]", played by [[Adolf Anderssen]] and [[Lionel Kieseritzky]] on [[21 June]] 1851 in London—where Anderssen made bold [[sacrifice (chess)|sacrifices]] to secure victory, giving up both [[rook (chess)|rooks]] and a bishop, then his [[queen (chess)|queen]], and then [[checkmate|checkmating]] his opponent with his three remaining [[minor piece]]s—is considered a supreme example of Romantic chess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Teach Yourself Chess |author=[[William Hartston|Hartston, Bill]] |publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton |isbn=978-0340670392 |year=1996 |page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; The end of the Romantic era in chess is considered to be the [[Vienna 1873 chess tournament|1873 Vienna Tournament]] where [[Wilhelm Steinitz]] popularized positional play and the closed game.

One of Romanticism's key ideas and most enduring legacies is the assertion of nationalism, which became a central theme of Romantic art and political philosophy. From the earliest parts of the movement, with their focus on development of [[national language]]s and [[folklore]], and the importance of local customs and traditions, to the movements that would redraw the map of Europe and lead to calls for self-determination of nationalities, nationalism was one of the key vehicles of Romanticism, its role, expression and meaning. One of the most important functions of medieval references in the 19th century was nationalist. Popular and epic poetry were its workhorses. This is visible in Germany and Ireland, where underlying Germanic or Celtic [[Stratum (linguistics)|linguistic substrates]] dating from before the Romanization-Latinization were sought out.

Early Romantic nationalism was strongly inspired by [[Rousseau]], and by the ideas of [[Johann Gottfried von Herder]], who in 1784 argued that the geography formed the natural economy of a people, and shaped their customs and society.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

The nature of nationalism changed dramatically, however, after the [[French Revolution]] with the rise of [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]], and the reactions in other nations. Napoleonic nationalism and republicanism were, at first, inspirational to movements in other nations: self-determination and a consciousness of national unity were held to be two of the reasons why France was able to defeat other countries in battle. But as the [[French First Republic|French Republic]] became [[First French Empire|Napoleon's Empire]], Napoleon became not the inspiration for nationalism, but the object of its struggle. In [[Prussia]], the development of spiritual renewal as a means to engage in [[Napoleonic Wars|the struggle against Napoleon]] was argued by, among others, [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], a disciple of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]. The word ''[[Volkstum]]'', or nationality, was coined in German as part of this resistance to the now conquering emperor. Fichte expressed the unity of language and nation in his address "To the German Nation" in 1806:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Those who speak the same language are joined to each other by a multitude of invisible bonds by nature herself, long before any human art begins; they understand each other and have the power of continuing to make themselves understood more and more clearly; they belong together and are by nature one and an inseparable whole. ...Only when each people, left to itself, develops and forms itself in accordance with its own peculiar quality, and only when in every people each individual develops himself in accordance with that common quality, as well as in accordance with his own peculiar quality—then, and then only, does the manifestation of divinity appear in its true mirror as it ought to be.&lt;ref name="Fichte"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1806fichte.asp | title=Address to the German Nation | publisher=Fordham University | date=1806 | accessdate=October 1, 2013 | author=Fichte, Johann}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This view of nationalism inspired the collection of [[folklore]] by such people as the [[Brothers Grimm]], the revival of old epics as national, and the construction of new epics as if they were old, as in the ''[[Kalevala]]'', compiled from Finnish tales and folklore, or ''[[Ossian]]'', where the claimed ancient roots were invented. The view that fairy tales, unless contaminated from outside literary sources, were preserved in the same form over thousands of years, was not exclusive to Romantic Nationalists, but fit in well with their views that such tales expressed the primordial nature of a people. For instance, the Brothers Grimm rejected many tales they collected because of their similarity to tales by [[Charles Perrault]], which they thought proved they were not truly German tales;&lt;ref&gt;Maria Tatar, ''The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales'', p. 31 {{ISBN|0691067228}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'' survived in their collection because the tale of [[Brynhildr]] convinced them that the figure of the sleeping princess was authentically German. [[Vuk Karadžić]]  contributed to [[Serbian language|Serbian]] folk literature, using peasant culture as the foundation. He regarded the oral literature of the peasants as an integral part of Serbian culture, compiling it to use in his collections of folk songs, tales, and proverbs, as well as the first dictionary of vernacular Serbian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Prilozi za književnost, jezik, istoriju i folklor|year=1965|publisher=Државна штампарија Краљевине Срба, Хрвата и Словенаца|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CnpHAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22%D1%81%D1%80%D0%B1%D0%B8+%D1%83+%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%82%D1%83%22&amp;dq=%22%D1%81%D1%80%D0%B1%D0%B8+%D1%83+%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%82%D1%83%22|accessdate=19 January 2012|page=264|language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar projects were undertaken by the Russian [[Alexander Afanasyev]], the Norwegians [[Peter Christen Asbjørnsen]] and [[Jørgen Moe]], and the Englishman [[Joseph Jacobs]].&lt;ref&gt;Jack Zipes, ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p. 846, {{ISBN|039397636X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Polish nationalism and messianism ===
Romanticism played an essential role in the national awakening of many Central European peoples lacking their own national states, not least in Poland, which had recently failed to restore its independence when [[Imperial Russian Army|Russia's army]] crushed the [[November Uprising|Polish Uprising]] under [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]]. Revival and reinterpretation of ancient myths, customs and traditions by Romantic poets and painters helped to distinguish their indigenous cultures from those of the dominant nations and crystallise the mythography of [[Romantic nationalism]]. Patriotism, nationalism, revolution and armed struggle for independence also became popular themes in the arts of this period. Arguably, the most distinguished Romantic poet of this part of Europe was [[Adam Mickiewicz]], who developed an idea that [[Christ of Europe|Poland was the Messiah of Nations]], predestined to suffer just as [[Jesus]] had suffered to save all the people. The Polish self-image as a "[[Christ of Europe|Christ among nations]]" or the martyr of Europe can be traced back to its history of [[Christendom]] and suffering under invasions. During the periods of foreign occupation, the Catholic Church served as bastion of Poland's national identity and language, and the major promoter of [[Culture of Poland|Polish culture]]. The [[Partitions of Poland|partitions]] came to be seen in Poland as a Polish sacrifice for the security for [[Western culture|Western civilization]]. Adam Mickiewicz wrote the patriotic drama [[Dziady (poem)|Dziady]] (directed against the Russians) where he depicts Poland as the Christ of Nations. He also wrote "Verily I say unto you, it is not for you to learn civilization from foreigners, but it is you who are to teach them civilization ... You are among the foreigners like the Apostles among the idolaters". In "[[Books of the Polish nation and Polish pilgrimage]]" Mickiewicz detailed his vision of Poland as a Messias and a Christ of Nations, that would save mankind. Dziady is known for various interpretation. The most known ones are the moral aspect of part II, [[individualist]] and romantic message of part IV, as well as deeply patriotic, messianistic and Christian vision in part III of poem. Zdzisław Kępiński, however, focuses his interpretation on [[Slavic mythology|Slavic pagan]] and [[occult]] elements found in the drama. In his book ''Mickiewicz hermetyczny'' he writes about [[Hermeticism|hermetic]], [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophic]] and [[Alchemy|alchemical]] philosophy on the book as well as [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] symbols.

'''Sam Burke''' and '''Maximilian''' "'''Twitch'''" '''Williams''' are two fictional [[NYPD]] [[homicide]] [[detective]]s, created by [[Todd McFarlane]]. Sam and Twitch were originally featured in McFarlane's hit comic series ''[[Spawn (comics)|Spawn]]''. Due to their popularity, they were later given their own title in 1999, called ''Sam and Twitch''. In their self-titled series, the duo were the protagonists in a dark and gritty [[New York City]]. The fictional universe of ''Sam and Twitch'' is somewhat different from average comics in which costumed heroes are not the norm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://splashpage.mtv.com/2010/06/21/todd-mcfarlane-plans-sam-and-twitch-tv-series/|title=Todd McFarlane Plans 'Sam And Twitch' TV Series|date=June 21, 2010|first=Blair |last=Marnell |publisher=MTV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=samtwitch&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=26780|title=McFarlane On The Anatomy Of "Sam &amp; Twitch"|date= June 18, 2010 | first=Josh |last=Wigler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sam Burke ==
Detective Sam Burke is often seen as the brawn of the group. Sam is a large, headstrong man with a penchant for foul language and gruff behavior. Sam is usually the one to take "action" against any type of villain they encounter. Though Sam has often been accused of [[police brutality]], the charges have never stuck. In fact, Sam takes great pride in being one of the few honest cops in a precinct he sees as infested with corruption and scandal. Although his style with criminals is rough, and he comes across as boorish to most others, he's actually quite compassionate, beneath his rough exterior, to those in need. He has a real passion for doing the right thing and seeing justice done, even if he has to resort to not-so-civil means. Sam is very protective of those few he trusts and considers friends, especially his partner Twitch. Twitch's dedication to his work despite the corruption of the Police department is shown to be inspiring to Sam, and he often goes to great lengths to protect Twitch from even their fellow officers, who may mean verbal or physical harm to Sam's highly intelligent, diminutive partner.&lt;ref name=host/&gt;

Despite his down-and-dirty, [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynical]], and hot-tempered personality, Sam is essentially a good man, with a strong sense of duty and honor. His straightforward ways have often put the detective duo at odds with even their fellow police, but while Twitch is considerably more reasonable than his larger partner, (and often pokes fun at Sam's fiery temperament and statements) he shows a deep trust and respect for him as well. While Twitch often figures out and solves the duo's various cases and predicaments, Sam is unquestionably the drive and conviction which sees the two through.&lt;ref name=samtwitch/&gt;

While not as talented as Twitch in deduction, Sam is skilled in being able to see through people and getting information. Even with a large and fat build, Sam has shown considerable strength, speed and durability in fighting superhuman foes. He's capable of going toe-to-toe against the Udaku in a fistfight, who's powerful enough to rip a man's head off.&lt;ref&gt;''Sam and Twitch'' #2&lt;/ref&gt; Sam has also displayed some form of police intuition that warns him of traps and lies, which he jokingly calls a "spider-sense".

== Twitch Williams ==
Maximilian Steven Percival "Twitch" Williams III is mainly seen as the "brains" of the partnership. He is the one who usually solves or puts the pieces together in the rare crimes the detectives encounter. A brilliant mathematician who excelled at [[trigonometry]], he has used his knowledge of angles to become an excellent marksman. A shooting [[Child prodigy|prodigy]], Twitch makes up for his small size with his ability to handle twin pistols with extreme accuracy and efficiency. He claims to have earned the nickname "Twitch," as Sam once said, "because he doesn't, ever!" In reality, "Twitch" was his despised high-school nickname, which Sam learned after intercepting a reunion invitation asking for 'Twitch' Williams. He refers to Sam Burke as "sir", as throughout the years Sam has, time and time again, earned his trust and respect.&lt;ref name=samtwitch/&gt;

Twitch was once married and has several children, but due to his busy schedule with crime cases, his wife eventually divorced him, and denies him custody of his kids. This had a great emotional impact on Twitch, but did not seem to hinder him from his work. He eventually reconciled with his wife and since then does his best to spend as much time with his family as his duty allows. Twitch comes from a family with a proud tradition in law enforcement, his father and siblings all being cops themselves. Despite his reserved and soft-spoken manner, he is extremely passionate and proud of his job, in some ways more so than Sam. It is because of this that, despite his incredible intelligence, the apparent rampant corruption of the Police Department, which he works for, troubles him greatly. In some ways, Twitch is a little more naïve than the street-smart and more realistic Sam, and has had to deal with many harsh truths.&lt;ref name=host&gt;{{cite news|title=Host of Heroes Join Ranks with Sam and Twitch|location=Washington, DC|date=May 1, 2004|last= Szadkowski|first= Joseph| newspaper=The Washington Times {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-116137442.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twitch has battled against many super-human foes such as [[Overt-Kill]], a monstrous, mafia-hired cyborg. Despite Overt-Kill's seemingly bulletproof exterior, Twitch was able to defeat him with a single, well-aimed bullet through Overt-Kill's ear canal.&lt;ref name="Boyd2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyd|first=Todd|title=African Americans and Popular Culture &amp;#91;3 volumes&amp;#93;|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Evxm9Wd6P6EC&amp;pg=RA2-PA174|volume=2|date=30 October 2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-06408-1|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publication history ==

=== ''Spawn'' ===
Sam and Twitch were originally introduced in the comic book series ''[[Spawn (comics)|Spawn]]'' as tertiary characters to the larger storyline of Al Simmons. The duo were at first at odds with Al, both due to Al's questionable methods and personality and Al's own distrust of the police. Eventually however, they had come to form a mutual respect and Al often sought help from the two, seeing them as two of the only people, cops, no less, that he could actually trust. Even after the detectives' own [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series had started the two often made appearances in Spawn.&lt;ref name="MisirogluRoach2004"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Misiroglu|first1=Gina Renée|last2=Roach|first2=David A.|title=The Superhero Book: The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Comic-book Icons and Hollywood Heroes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IDlEHGKj8JgC&amp;pg=PA445|date=1 January 2004|publisher=Visible Ink Press|isbn=978-1-57859-154-1|page=445}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Sam and Twitch'' ===
Due to issues with publishing, ''Sam and Twitch'' was not always released in a timely manner. This affected sales. The series was subsequently cancelled in 2003 with only 26 issues after a four-year run. The delays continued until the end.

The character Spawn makes a small cameo appearance in ''Sam and Twitch'' and requests the duo's help. Sam and Twitch say that they are preoccupied and brush him off.

The series has been collected as these graphic novels:
* ''Sam and Twitch Book One: Udaku'' TPB - collects #1-8 in black &amp; white (Image Comics, 2000, 192 pages, {{ISBN|1-58240-176-4}})
* ''Sam and Twitch: The [[Brian Michael Bendis]] Collection'' Volume 1 TPB - collects #1-9 (Image Comics, 2006, 224 pages, {{ISBN|1-58240-583-2}})
* ''Sam and Twitch: The Brian Michael Bendis Collection'' Volume 2 TPB - collects #10-19 (Image Comics, 2007 {{ISBN|978-1-58240-745-6}})
* ''Sam and Twitch: The Complete Collection Book 1'' Hardcover- Collects Issues 1-12
* ''Sam and Twitch: The Complete Collection Book 2'' Hardcover- Collects Issues 13-24
* ''Sam and Twitch: The Writer'' TPB

=== ''Case Files: Sam &amp; Twitch'' ===
The first issue of ''Case Files'' was released in June 2003, a few months before the November cancellation of the original ''Sam and Twitch'' series. Whereas the original series was concurrent with the duo's appearances in ''Spawn'', the continuity of ''Case Files'' starts much later in their lives and revisits one of their old nemesis.&lt;ref name="Blengino2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Blengino|first=Luca|title=Sam and Twitch: The Writer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j2MERQAACAAJ|year=2010|publisher=Image Comics|isbn=978-1-60706-227-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other notable characters ==
*'''Dr. K. C. McRory:''' Dubbed "Dr. Death" by the detectives, Dr. McRory is in charge of the crime scene investigation department at the precinct. As with many characters, she dislikes Sam for his sloppy habits and abrasive personality. She gets along quite well with Twitch. She may be based loosely on the DC Comics character [[Carrie Kelly]], as they share initials—albeit in a different order—and have matching glasses and hairstyle.
*'''[[Jinx (Image Comics)|Jinx]]:''' A bounty hunter who assists the duo in tracking down a fellow hunter who has gone insane. Jinx also stars in a separate comic book series.

==In other media==
* In the HBO miniseries ''[[Todd McFarlane's Spawn]]'', Sam was voiced by James Keane and Twitch was voiced by [[Mike McShane|Michael McShane]].&lt;ref name="Muir2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Muir|first=John Kenneth|title=The Encyclopedia of Superheroes on Film and Television|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kdMzAQAAIAAJ|year=2008|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|isbn=978-0-7864-3755-9|page=494}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the 1997 [[Spawn (film)|live-action film]], two detectives resembling Sam and Twitch arrest [[Jason Wynn]] towards the end of the film. It is stated that Todd McFarlane wanted a movie to be about Sam and Twitch and Spawn would have been the background character. Sam and Twitch were going to investigate the murders that Spawn was involved in.&lt;ref name="Hughes2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hughes|first=David|title=Comic Book Movies - Virgin Film|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v3vSSClbsrQC&amp;pg=PT201|date=31 October 2012|publisher=Ebury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4481-3279-9|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sam &amp; Twitch appeared in the ''[[Spawn: In the Demon's Hand]]'' videogame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spawn Fights to Regain His Humanity after Death|date=November 18, 2000|last=Szadkowski|first=Joseph|newspaper=The Washington Times|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-67094827.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Like most of McFarlane's characters, Sam &amp; Twitch has been the basis for several action figures by [[McFarlane Toys]].&lt;ref name="Moen2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moen|first=Justin|title=Toys &amp; Prices 2011|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QGQVx5FEYcIC&amp;pg=PA106|date=3 September 2010|publisher=Krause Publications|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=1-4402-1653-3|pages=106–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In a February 2017 exclusive interview with Deadline, the head of BBC America revealed that [[Kevin Smith]] is attached to write, direct, and executive produce a ''Sam &amp; Twitch'' police procedural for [[BBC America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://comicbook.com/2017/02/16/kevin-smith-helming-spawn-spin-off-tv-show-for-bbc-america/|title=Kevin Smith Helming Spawn Spin-off TV Show for BBC America|date=February 16, 2017|last=Burlingame|first=Russ|website=ComicBook.com|accessdate=February 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the comic book, each episode of the series is planned to follow a closed-ended procedural format, with certain character-serialized aspects to the storytelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2017/02/bbc-america-new-kevin-smith-show-doctor-who-orphan-black-1201912649/|title=BBC America Boss On New Kevin Smith Show, How 'Orphan Black' Ends, The Next Doctor Who &amp; 'Planet Earth II' Big Picture|last=Patten|first=Dominic|date=February 16, 2017|website=Deadline|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Songwriters Hall of Fame''' ('''SHOF''') was founded in 1969 by songwriter [[Johnny Mercer]] and music publisher/songwriter [[Abe Olman]] and publisher/executive [[Howie Richmond]] to honor those whose work represents and maintains the heritage and legacy of a spectrum of the most beloved songs from the world's popular music songbook. It not only celebrates these established songwriters, but is also involved on the development of new songwriting talent through workshops, showcases and scholarships. There are many programs designed to teach and discover new songwriters. [[Nile Rodgers]] serves as the organization's chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/8463518/nile-rodgers-chairman-songwriters-hall-of-fame-announcement|title=Nile Rodgers Appointed Chairman of the Songwriters Hall of Fame: Exclusive|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hall of Fame only existed as an online virtual collection until 2010, when it was first put on display as a physical gallery inside [[The Grammy Museum]] in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|publisher=Songwriters Hall of Fame|url=http://www.songhall.org/about/entry/about_us|accessdate=June 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; With an under-construction basement installation at the [[Brill Building]] in New York, the Hall does not have a permanent place and the awards are not televised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Songwriters Hall of Fame Honorees Range from Gaga to Grateful Dead|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|url=https://variety.com/2015/music/spotlight/songwriters-hall-of-fame-honorees-range-from-gaga-to-grateful-dead-1201523300/|date=June 18, 2015|accessdate=June 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sound &amp; Vision''''' is an American magazine, purchased by AVTech Media Ltd. (UK) in March 2018, covering [[home cinema|home theater]], [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]], [[video]] and [[multimedia]] consumer products. Before 2000, it had been published for most of its history as '''''Stereo Review'''''. The magazine is headquartered in New York City.&lt;ref name="rlb"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Lee Brewer|title=Writer's Market 2016: The Most Trusted Guide to Getting Published|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zsA_CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA406|accessdate=October 30, 2016|date=September 1, 2015|publisher=F+W Media, Inc.|isbn=978-1-59963-937-6|page=406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and profile==
''Stereo Review'' was an American magazine first published in 1958&lt;ref name="rlb"/&gt; by [[Ziff-Davis]] with the title ''HiFi and Music Review''.&lt;ref name=fra&gt;{{cite book|author=Frank Hoffmann|title=Encyclopedia of Recorded Sound|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-FOSAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2023|accessdate=November 30, 2016|date=November 12, 2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-94950-1|page=2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the initial phase the magazine was headquartered in [[Chicago, Illinois]].&lt;ref name="fra"/&gt; It was one of a handful of magazines then available for the individual interested in [[high fidelity]]. Throughout its life it published a blend of record and equipment reviews, articles on music and musicians, and articles on technical issues and advice. The name changed to ''HiFi Review'' in 1959.  It became ''HiFi/Stereo Review'' in 1961 to reflect the growing use of [[stereophonic]] technology in recordings and broadcasts. In 1968 it became, simply, ''Stereo Review'', reflecting the broad shift to stereophonic reproduction and simplifying the title. In the late 1980s, the magazine was acquired by CBS Magazines (now [[Hachette Filipacchi Media U.S.|Hachette Filipacchi]]), and in 1989 it absorbed ''[[High Fidelity Magazine|High Fidelity]]'' magazine. During the 1990s, consumer trends began to branch out into [[home cinema|home theater]] matters and the magazine contents followed in kind. In 1999 ''Stereo Review''  merged with ''[[Video (magazine)|Video]]'', a magazine Hachette Filipacchi had acquired from [[Reese Communications]],&lt;ref&gt;Lazarus, George.

''Chicago Tribune''. 14 March 1995. {{ISSN|1085-6706}}&lt;/ref&gt; to become ''Stereo Review's Sound &amp; Vision'' before settling on its current name in 2000, reflecting how dominant home theater had become in consumer purchases.

In June 2009 Hachette Filipacchi sold the publication to [[Bonnier Corporation]], the U.S. division of the [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[Bonnier Group]], along with four other magazines: ''Popular Photography'', ''Boating'', ''Flying'' and ''American Photo''.&lt;ref name="PressRelease06Jan10"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bonniercorp.com/news/bonnier-corp-acquires-five-magazine-brands-from-hachette-filipacchi-media-us-1000072410.html|title=Bonnier Corp.

One of the key features of the magazine was the permanence of its staff. Some staffers stayed for decades. One of them, Louise Boundas, rose from the ranks to become the magazine's editor from the late 1980s into the 1990s. Another, [[Julian Hirsch]], was known for his technical reviews of equipment; he was involved with the magazine from 1961 until his retirement in 1998, nearly 40 years.

A Canadian magazine with the same title and focus ceased publication about a year before ''Stereo Review'' took the name.

'''''Spotlight''''' is the [[BBC]]'s regional TV news programme for the South West of England, covering [[Cornwall]], [[Devon]], [[Isles of Scilly]], southern and western [[Somerset]], western [[Dorset]] and the [[Channel Islands]]. There is also a special version of the programme for viewers in the Channel Islands. It debuted on 20 April 1961. The main version of the programme broadcasts between 18:30 and 19:00 on weekdays, with shorter bulletins at other times. The programme can be viewed anywhere in the UK (and Europe) on [[Sky (UK and Ireland)|Sky]] channel 967/968 on the [[BBC UK regional TV on satellite]] service. Its main competitors are [[ITV West Country]]'s main evening programme ''[[ITV News West Country]]'' in Cornwall, Devon, Isles of Scilly, southern and western Somerset and western Dorset; and [[ITV Channel Television]]'s main evening programme ''[[ITV News Channel TV]]'' in the Channel Islands.

''Spotlight'' is broadcast from BBC Broadcasting House in Seymour Road, [[Plymouth]], the headquarters of [[BBC South West]]. There are smaller studios in [[Barnstaple]], [[Exeter]], [[Paignton]], [[Taunton]] and [[Truro]].

==History==
Although local radio had been broadcast from Plymouth as station 2PY between 1924 and 1934, the first regional television programme was not broadcast until 20 April 1961, just nine days before the rival ITV service from [[Westward Television]] began broadcasting. At first a ten-minute bulletin called ''News from the South West'' was read by Tom Salmon, but in under a year it had doubled in length and had been renamed as ''South West at Six'', hosted by [[Sheila Tracy]]. The name ''Spotlight'' was adopted on 30 September 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Those early radio broadcasts had been made from the Athenaeum Chambers in Athenaeum Lane in Plymouth (next to what became [[Westward Television|Westward]] and [[Television South West|TSW]]'s headquarters), but just before the Second World War the BBC started looking for alternative premises. A Victorian villa named ''Ingledene'' in Seymour Road was bought from the Douglass family and this building has, as of 2012, remained the BBC's headquarters in the South West. It has been considerably extended over the years, including the addition of a new and larger television studio in 1974 in preparation for the conversion of ''Spotlight'' to colour the following year.&lt;ref name=DA /&gt; A replacement purpose-built broadcasting centre on the opposite side of Sutton Harbour from [[Barbican, Plymouth|the Barbican]] has been under construction since 2008 and was due to open in mid-2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In late 2012, the owner of the harbour expressed fears the move may never happen and admitted other parties had expressed an interest in moving to the site earmarked for the BBC.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130505070857/http://www.thisisplymouth.co.uk/Inquiries-site-earmarked-BBC/story-17433822-detail/story.html '''Inquiries over site earmarked for BBC''', This is Plymouth]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the BBC confirmed that it was not moving to Sutton Harbour, and instead was refurbishing its existing Plymouth headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2013/seymour-road.html "BBC South West announces major investment in Plymouth Seymour Road base", BBC Media Centre]&lt;/ref&gt;

A lighthouse motif has been in use within the programme's title sequences for many years until May 2000, when Spotlight adopted the generic BBC regional news design. The motif returned in May 2006, and the use of a lighthouse in the titles continued until the latest relaunch in June 2015.

==BBC Channel Islands==
[[File:BBC Channel Islands.png|thumb|right|''BBC Channel Islands'' title screen]]
''BBC Channel Islands'' is the dedicated [[Regional variation|opt-out service]] for the [[Channel Islands]].

Local news broadcasts for the Islands began in the 1990s, when a short bulletin aired following the [[BBC Nine O'Clock News|Nine O'Clock News]]. Since October 2000, two evening bulletins have been broadcast at 6:30pm and following the News at Ten. Originally broadcast from a studio at the [[Frémont Point transmitting station|Fremont Point transmitter]], the news service is now entirely based at the studios of [[BBC Radio Jersey]] in St Helier.

The opt-outs are presented by Charlie McArdle and produced by a team of multi-skilling journalists who write, film and edit their own stories, as well as producing and directing the bulletins on weekdays. The main opt takes up the first 12 minutes of the nightly 6.30pm programme with a full opt at 10.25pm and a short 30-second update at 8pm. No opt-outs are broadcast during the day and at weekends, except for special occasions such as local elections or major sporting events such as the Island Games.

Like other BBC enterprises in the Channel Islands, funding comes primarily from [[Television licensing in the United Kingdom|television licence]] fees collected within the Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TV licences |publisher=Guernsey Post |url=http://www.guernseypost.com/retail-services/tv-licences/ |accessdate=2 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512075128/http://www.guernseypost.com/retail-services/tv-licences/ |archivedate=12 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A '''sucker bet''' is a [[gambling wager]] in which the expected return does not reflect the [[odds]] of winning, and is significantly lower. For example, the chances of correctly guessing the order of the final three cards in a game of [[Faro (card game)|Faro]] is usually 1 in 6, yet the bet only pays 4:1 or 5:1. The complexity of the game can disguise the nature of the odds, so that the player does not realise that they are taking a sucker bet.

The name originates in that sucker bets are often created to lure inexperienced players into betting against large odds, blinded by the offer of "fast money".

Variants include:

* Parlay: One bet ticket written with at least two wagers (all must win for the ticket to cash).
* Teaser: A sucker wager that allows bettors to add and subtract points from posted odds.
* Exotic: Any wager other than a straight bet or parlay (also referred to as a proposition or prop).

Taking insurance in [[blackjack]] is also often considered a sucker bet.{{clarify inline|date=July 2018}}

[[File:British tabloids - July 5 2011.jpg|thumb|right|upright|British tabloids (top two rows), July 5, 2011]]

A '''tabloid''' is a [[newspaper]] with a compact page size smaller than [[broadsheet]]. There is no standard size for this [[newspaper format]].

The term ''[[tabloid journalism]]'' refers to an emphasis on such topics as sensational crime stories, astrology, celebrity gossip and television, and is not a reference to newspapers printed in this format. Some small-format papers with a high standard of journalism refer to themselves as ''[[Compact (newspaper)|compact]]'' newspapers. Larger newspapers, traditionally associated with higher-quality journalism, are called [[broadsheet]]s, even if the newspaper is now printed on smaller pages.

==History==
[[File:Tabloid products; Burroughs Wellcome and Company Wellcome L0041219.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|alt=3 pill pots from the Burroughs Wellcome and Company : Tabloid Mixed Glands No. 2 tablets, Emprazil tablets and Tabloid Acetylsalicylic Aid tablets [Aspirin]|Tabloid products: Burroughs Wellcome and Company]]
The word "tabloid" comes from the name given by the London-based pharmaceutical company [[GlaxoSmithKline|Burroughs Wellcome &amp; Co.]] to the compressed [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablets]] they marketed as "Tabloid" pills in the late 1880s.&lt;ref name="pills"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/About-us/History/WTX051935.htm |title=Henry Wellcome the Sailesman|work=Wellcome|date=18 November 2008|accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The connotation of ''tabloid'' was soon applied to other small compressed items. A 1902 item in London's ''Westminster Gazette'' noted, "The proprietor intends to give in tabloid form all the news printed by other journals."  Thus "tabloid journalism" in 1901 originally meant a paper that condensed stories into a simplified, easily absorbed format. The term preceded the 1918 reference to smaller sheet newspapers that contained the condensed stories.&lt;ref&gt;"tabloid, n. and adj.", ''Oxford English Dictionary'' [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/196821?rskey=OEVygJ&amp;amp;result=1 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{comparison newspaper size.svg}}

==Types==
Tabloid newspapers, especially in the [[United Kingdom]], vary widely in their target market, political alignment, editorial style, and circulation.  Thus, various terms have been coined to describe the subtypes of this versatile paper format.  There are, broadly, two main types of tabloid newspaper: ''red top'' and ''compact''.  The distinction is largely of editorial style; both red top and compact tabloids span the width of the political spectrum from [[socialism]] to [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[conservative|conservatism]], although red-top tabloids, on account of their historically working-class target market, generally embrace [[populism]] to some degree. Red top tabloids are so named due to their tendency, in British and Commonwealth usage, to have their [[Nameplate (publishing)|masthead]]s printed in red ink; the term ''compact'' was coined to avoid the connotation of the word ''tabloid'', which implies a red top tabloid, and has lent its name to [[tabloid journalism]], which is journalism after the fashion of red top reporters.

===Red top tabloids===
{{See also|Red tops}}
Red top tabloids, named after their distinguishing red mastheads, employ a form of writing known as [[tabloid journalism]]; this style emphasizes features such as [[sensationalism|sensational]] crime stories, astrology, [[gossip column]]s about the personal lives of celebrities and sports stars, and [[junk food news]]. Celebrity gossip columns which appear in red top tabloids and focus on their [[Human sexual activity|sexual practices]], [[recreational drug use|misuse of narcotics]], and the [[privacy|private]] aspects of their lives often border on, and sometimes cross the line of [[defamation]].

Red tops tend to be written with a simplistic, straightforward vocabulary and grammar; their layout usually gives greater prominence to the picture than to the word.  The writing style of red top tabloids is often accused of [[sensationalism]]; red tops have been accused of deliberately igniting [[controversy]] and selectively reporting on attention-grabbing stories, or those with [[shock value]]. In the extreme case, red top tabloids have been accused of lying or misrepresenting the truth to increase circulation.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Examples of British red top newspapers include ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', the ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]'' and the ''[[Daily Mirror]]''.

===Compact tabloids===
{{For|a list of newspapers publishing in the compact "tabloid" format|Compact (newspaper)}}
In contrast to red top tabloids, compacts use an editorial style more closely associated with [[broadsheet]] newspapers. In fact, most compact tabloids formerly used the broadsheet paper size, but changed to accommodate reading in tight spaces, such as on a crowded [[commuter bus]] or [[train]]. The term ''compact'' was coined in the 1970s by the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', one of the earlier newspapers to make the change, although it now once again calls itself a tabloid.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} The purpose behind this was to avoid the association of the word ''tabloid'' with the flamboyant, salacious editorial style of the red top newspaper.

The early converts from broadsheet format made the change in the 1970s; two British papers that took this step at the time were the ''Daily Mail'' and the ''[[Daily Express]]''. In 2003, ''[[The Independent]]'' also made the change for the same reasons, quickly followed by ''[[The Scotsman]]'' and ''[[The Times]]''. On the other hand, ''[[Morning Star (British newspaper)|The Morning Star]]'' had always used the tabloid size, but stands in contrast to both the red top papers and the former broadsheets; although ''The Morning Star'' emphasises [[hard news]], it embraces [[socialism]] and is circulated mostly among [[blue-collar]] [[labourer]]s.

Compact tabloids, just like [[broadsheet]]- and [[Berliner (format)|Berliner]]-format newspapers, span the political spectrum from [[progressivism|progressive]] to [[conservative]] and from [[capitalist]] to [[socialist]].

In [[Morocco]], ''[[Maroc Soir (newspaper)|Maroc Soir]]'', launched in November 2005, is published in tabloid format.&lt;ref name=press&gt;{{cite journal|title=Morocco: New French speaking paper for the younger generation|journal=Press Business|date=February 2006|issue=1|url=http://www.press-business.com/pdf/2006_01_press_business.pdf|accessdate=7 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014110104/http://www.press-business.com/pdf/2006_01_press_business.pdf|archivedate=14 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In South Africa, the Bloemfontein-based daily newspaper ''[[Volksblad]]'' became the first serious broadsheet newspaper to switch to tabloid, but only on Saturdays. Despite the format proving to be popular with its readers, the newspaper remains broadsheet on weekdays. This is also true of Pietermaritzburg's daily, ''The Witness'' in the province of KwaZulu-Natal.
The ''[[Daily Sun]]'', published by [[Naspers]], has since become South Africa's biggest-selling daily newspaper and is aimed primarily at the black working class.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} It sells over 500,000 copies per day, reaching approximately 3,000,000 readers.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Besides offering a sometimes satirical view of the seriousness of mainstream news, the ''Daily Sun'' also covers fringe theories and paranormal claims such as tokoloshes (hob-goblins), ancestral visions and all things supernatural. It is also published as the ''Sunday Sun''.

===Asia===
In Bangladesh, The Daily ''[[Manabzamin]]'' became the first and is now the largest circulated Bengali language tabloid in the world, in 1998. Published from Bangladesh, by renowned news presenter Mahbuba Chowdhury, the Daily Manab Zamin is ranked in the Top 500 newspaper websites, and in the Top 10 Bengali news site categories in the world, and is the only newspaper in Bangladesh which houses credentials with [[FIFA]], [[UEFA]], [[The Football Association]], [[Warner Bros.]], and [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]]. The Daily ''Manabzamin'' is led by Editor-in-Chief Matiur Rahman Chowdhury, who is also the regional correspondent for [[Voice of America]] and political talkshow host in Bengali television stations [[Banglavision]] and ''Channel i''. The newspaper receives visitors from 179 countries, and hosts 770,000 unique IP visitors, every month.

In the [[People's Republic of China]], [[Chinese tabloid]]s have exploded in popularity since the mid-1990s and have tested the limits of press censorship{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} by taking editorial positions critical of the government and by engaging in critical investigative reporting.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

In [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], the weekly English-language newspaper ''[[The Financial]]'' switched to a compact format in 2005 and doubled the number of pages in each issue. Other Georgian-language newspapers have tested compact formats in the early 1990s.

Tabloid journalism is still an evolving concept in India's print media. The first tabloid, ''[[Blitz (newspaper)|Blitz]]''  was started by [[Russi Karanjia]] on February 1, 1941 with the words "Our Blitz, India's Blitz against [[Hitler]]!". ''Blitz'' was first published in English and then branched out with Hindi, Marathi and Urdu versions. In 1974, Russi's daughter Rita founded the ''[[Cine Blitz]]'' magazine. In 2005, ''Times of India'' brought out a dedicated Mumbai tabloid newspaper ''[[Mumbai Mirror]]'' which gives prominence to Mumbai-related stories and issues. ''[[Tehelka]]'' started off as a news portal in 2000. It broke the story about match-fixing in Indian and International Cricket and the sting operation on defence deals in the Indian Army. In 2007, it closed shop and reappeared in tabloid form, and has been appreciated for its brand of investigative journalism. Other popular tabloid newspapers in English media are ''[[Mid-Day]]'', an afternoon newspaper published out of and dedicated to Mumbai and business newspapers like ''[[Mint (newspaper)|MINT]]''. There are numerous tabloids in most of India's official languages. There is an all youth tabloid by the name of TILT - The ILIKE Times.

In Indonesia, tabloids include Bola, ''GO'' (Gema Olahraga, defunct), ''Soccer'' (defunct), ''Fantasy'' (defunct), ''Buletin Sinetron'' (defunct), ''Pro TV'' (defunct), ''Citra'' (defunct), ''Genie'', ''Bintang Indonesia (Indonesian Stars)'', ''Nyata'', ''Wanita Indonesia'' (Women of Indonesia), ''Cek and Ricek'', and ''Nova''.

In Oman, ''[[TheWeek]]'' is a free, 48-page, all-colour, independent weekly published from Muscat in the Sultanate of Oman. Oman's first free newspaper was launched in March 2003 and has now gone on to gather what is believed to be the largest readership for any publication in Oman. Ms Mohana Prabhakar is the managing editor of the publication. ''TheWeek'' is audited by BPA Worldwide, which has certified its circulation as being a weekly average of 50,300.

In Pakistan, ''[[Khabrain]]'' is a tabloid newspaper popular within the lower middle class. This news group introduced a new paper, ''[[Naya Akhbar]]'' which is comparably more sensational. At the local level, many sensational tabloids can be seen but, unlike ''Khabrain'' or other big national newspapers, they are distributed only on local levels in districts.

[[List of newspapers in the Philippines#Tabloids|Tabloids in the Philippines]] are usually written in local languages, like Tagalog or Bisaya, but some are written in English, like the ''[[People's Journal]]'' and ''Tempo''. Like their common journalistic connotations, Philippine tabloids usually report sensationalist crime stories and celebrity gossip, and some tabloids feature topless photos of girls. Several tabloids are vernacular counterparts of English broadsheet newspapers by the same publisher, like ''[[Pilipino Star Ngayon]]'' (''The Philippine Star''), ''[[Inquirer Bandera|Bandera]]'' (''Philippine Daily Inquirer''), and ''Balita'' (''Manila Bulletin'').

===Europe===
The [[Berliner (format)|Berliner]] format, used by many prominent European newspapers, is sized between the tabloid and the broadsheet. In a newspaper context, the term ''Berliner'' is generally used only to describe size, not to refer to other qualities of the publication. The biggest tabloid (and newspaper in general) in Europe, by circulation, is Germany's ''[[Bild]]'', with around 2.5 million copies (down from above 5 million in the 1980s). Although its paper size is bigger, its style was copied from the British tabloids.

In [[Denmark]], tabloids in the British sense are known as 'formiddagsblade' (before-noon newspapers), the two biggest being ''[[B.T. (tabloid)|BT]]'' and ''[[Ekstra Bladet]]''. The old more serious newspaper ''[[Berlingske Tidende]]'' shifted from broadsheet to tabloid format in 2006, while keeping the news profile intact.

In [[Finland]], the biggest newspaper and biggest daily subscription newspaper in the Nordic countries ''[[Helsingin Sanomat]]'' changed its size from broadsheet to tabloid on 8 January 2013.

In France the ''Nice Matin'' (or ''Le Dauphiné''), a popular Southern France newspaper changed from Broadsheet to Tabloid on 8 April 2006. They changed the printing format in one day after test results showed that 74% liked the Tabloid format compared to Broadsheet. But the most famous tabloid dealing with crime stories is ''[[Le Nouveau Détective]],'' created in the early 20th century. This weekly tabloid has a national circulation.

In the [[Netherlands]], several newspapers have started publishing tabloid versions of their newspapers, including one of the major 'quality' newspapers, [[NRC Handelsblad]], with ''[[nrc•next]]'' in 2006. Two free tabloid newspapers were also introduced in the early 2000s, '[[Metro International|Metro]] and [[Sp!ts]], mostly for distribution in public transportation. In 2007 a third and fourth free tabloid appeared, '[[De Pers]]' and '[[DAG (newspaper)|DAG]]'. [[De Telegraaf]], the Dutch newspaper that most closely resembles the style of British tabloid papers, comes in broadsheet but announced it will change to tabloid in April 2014.&lt;ref name="Telegraaf op Zondag terug (in Dutch)"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/22229483/__Telegraaf_op_Zondag_terug__.html |title=Telegraaf op Zondag terug |year=2014 |accessdate=22 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Norway]], close to all newspapers have switched from the broadsheet to the tabloid format, which measures 280 x 400&amp;nbsp;mm. The three biggest newspapers are ''[[Verdens Gang|VG]]'', ''[[Dagbladet]]'', and ''[[Aftenposten]]'', the former the most sensationalist one and the latter more serious.

In [[Poland]], the newspaper ''[[Fakt]]'', sometimes ''[[Super Express (newspaper)|Super Express]]'' is considered as tabloid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VpPPptHEDEYC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;dq=Gazeta+Wyborcza+tabloid&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hl=pl&amp;cd=4#v=onepage&amp;q=Gazeta%20Wyborcza%20tabloid&amp;f=false |title=Cathie Burton, Alun Drake, Hitting the headlines in Europe: a country-by-country guide to effective media relations, 2004, ISBN 0-7494-4226-3 |publisher=Google|accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Russia and Ukraine, major English language newspapers like the ''Moscow Times'' and the ''[[Kyiv Post]]'' use a compact format.

In the United Kingdom, three previously broadsheet daily newspapers—''[[The Times]]'', ''[[The Scotsman]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]''—have switched to tabloid size in recent years, and two—''[[Daily Express]]'' and ''[[Daily Mail]]''—in former years, although ''The Times'' and ''The Scotsman'' call the format "[[compact (newspaper)|compact]]" to avoid the down-market connotation of the word ''tabloid''. Similarly, when referring to the down-market tabloid newspapers the alternative term "[[Red Tops|red-top]]" (referring to their traditionally red-coloured mastheads) is increasingly used, to distinguish them from the up- and middle-market compact newspapers. [[Morning Star (British newspaper)|The Morning Star]] also comes in tabloid format; however, it avoids celebrity stories, and instead favours issues relating to [[labour unions]].

===North America===
[[File:Finest picture front page.jpg|thumb|"A photographer's photographer" quote by [[Florence Harding|First Lady Mrs. Warren G. Harding]] who stated the Edward Jackson's photograph of her was "the best photo ever taken." The photo ran on the entire front page of the February 5, 1921 ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]''.]]

In [[Canada]] many newspapers of [[Postmedia]]'s ''Sun'' brand are in tabloid format including ''[[The Province]]'', a newspaper for the [[British Columbia]] market.  The Canadian publisher [[Black Press]] publishes newspapers in both tabloid ({{convert|10+1/4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wide by {{convert|14+1/2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} deep) and what it calls "tall tab" format, where the latter is {{convert|10+1/4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wide by {{convert|16+1/4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} deep, larger than tabloid but smaller than the broadsheets it also publishes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bcnewsgroup.com/BlackPress/advertising/ratecards/2007_Island_Retail.pdf] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327201505/http://www.bcnewsgroup.com/BlackPress/advertising/ratecards/2007_Island_Retail.pdf |date=March 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[History of American newspapers|United States]], daily tabloids date back to the founding of the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' in 1919, followed by the ''[[New York Daily Mirror]]'' and the ''[[New York Evening Graphic]]'' in the 1920s. Competition among those three for crime, sex and celebrity news was considered a scandal to the mainstream press of the day. The tabloid format is used by a number of respected and indeed prize-winning American papers. Prominent U.S. tabloids include the ''[[New York Post]]'', the ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' and  ''[[Newsday]]'' in New York, the ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]'', ''[[The Bakersfield Californian]]'' and ''[[La Opinión]]'' in California, ''[[The Jersey Journal]]'' and ''[[The Trentonian]]'' in New Jersey, the ''[[Philadelphia Daily News]]'', the ''[[Delaware County Daily Times]]'' and ''[[The Citizens' Voice]]'', ''[[The Burlington Free Press]]'', the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', and the ''[[Boston Herald]]''. US tabloids that ceased publication include Denver's ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]''.

===Oceania===
In Australia, tabloids include ''[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]]'', ''[[Herald Sun]]'', ''[[The Sun-Herald]]'', ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|Daily Telegraph]]'', ''[[The Courier Mail]]'' (All News Ltd papers), ''[[The West Australian]]'', ''[[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury]]'', ''[[Hamilton Spectator (Aus)|The Hamilton Spectator]]'', ''The Portland Observer'', ''The Casterton News'' and ''The Melbourne Observer''.

===South America===
In Argentina, one of the country's two main newspapers, ''[[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]]'', is a tabloid and in the Southern Philippines, a new weekly tabloid, ''The Mindanao Examiner'', now includes media services, such as photography and video production, into its line as a source to finance the high cost of printing and other expenses. It is also into independent film making.

In Brazil, many newspapers are tabloids, including sports daily ''[[Lance!]]'' (which circulates in cities such as [[Rio de Janeiro]] and [[São Paulo]]), most publications currently and formerly owned by [[Grupo RBS]] (especially the [[Porto Alegre]] daily ''[[Zero Hora]]''), and, in March 2009, Rio de Janeiro-based ''[[O Dia]]'' switched to tabloid from broadsheet, though, several years later, it reverted to being a broadsheet. Its sister publication, ''[[Meia Hora]]'' has always been a tabloid, but in slightly smaller format than ''O Dia'' and ''Lance!''.

==As a weekly alternative newspaper==

The more recent usage of the term 'tabloid' refers to weekly or semi-weekly newspapers in tabloid format. Many of these are essentially straightforward newspapers, publishing in tabloid format, because subway and bus commuters prefer to read smaller-size newspapers due to lack of space.
These newspapers are distinguished from the major daily newspapers, in that they purport to offer an "alternative" viewpoint, either in the sense that the paper's editors are more locally oriented, or that the paper is editorially independent from major media conglomerates.

Other factors that distinguish "alternative" weekly tabloids from the major daily newspapers are their less-frequent publication, and that they are usually free to the user, since they rely on ad revenue. As well, alternative weekly tabloids tend to concentrate on local- or even neighbourhood-level issues, and on local entertainment in the bars and local theatres.

Alternative tabloids can be positioned as [[upmarket]] (quality) newspapers, to appeal to the better-educated, higher-income sector of the market; as [[Middle-market newspaper|middle-market]] (popular); or as [[downmarket]] (sensational) newspapers, which emphasize sensational crime stories and celebrity gossip. In each case, the newspapers will draw their advertising revenue from different types of businesses or services. An upmarket weekly's advertisers are often organic grocers, boutiques, and theatre companies while a downmarket's may have those of trade schools, supermarkets, and the sex industry. Both usually contain ads from local bars, auto dealers, movie theaters, and a classified ads section.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twindx.com/uploaded/Daily%20Express.jpg] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304110552/http://www.twindx.com/uploaded/Daily%20Express.jpg |date=March 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Terror Train''''' is a 1980 [[slasher film]]{{sfn|Rockoff|2016|p=14}} directed by [[Roger Spottiswoode]] in his directorial debut and starring [[Jamie Lee Curtis]], [[Ben Johnson (actor)|Ben Johnson]], and [[Hart Bochner]]. Set aboard a moving train on [[New Year's Eve]], the film follows a group of medical school students holding a costume party who are targeted by a killer who steals their costumes after murdering them to avoid being caught. It features supporting performances from Sandee Currie, [[Anthony Sherwood]], and [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]].

The concept for the film was based on an idea by executive producer Daniel Grodnik, who sought to "make ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' on a train." A full-length script for the film was composed by [[Thomas Y. Drake|T.Y. Drake]], and production was initiated within four months. The film was shot in [[Montreal]] between late November and late December 1979, shortly after Curtis had completed filming for ''[[Prom Night (1980 film)|Prom Night]]'' (1980).

An independently-produced film, ''Terror Train'' was purchased for distribution by the major studio [[20th Century Fox]], who had yet to release a slasher film; the studio was able to supply an expansive marketing campaign for the film that cost an estimated $5 million. It was released theatrically in the United States on October 3, 1980, grossing $8 million during its theatrical run.

== Plot ==
At a college [[fraternity]]'s [[New Year's Eve]] party, a reluctant Alana Maxwell is coerced into participating in a [[prank]]: she lures the shy and awkward [[Fraternities and sororities#Joining|pledge]] Kenny Hampson into a darkened room on the promise of a sexual liaison. However some other students have placed a woman's corpse (stolen from the university medical school during the [[School holiday|Christmas vacation]]) in the bed instead. Kenny is traumatized by the prank and is sent to a [[psychiatric institution]].

Three years later, the members of the same fraternities and sororities hold a New Year's Eve [[costume party]] aboard a [[train]]. Class clown Ed is disguised as [[Groucho Marx]]; Prank ringleader Doc Manley is disguised as a [[monk]]; Jackson is disguised as an [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|alien]] [[lizard]]; Doc's girlfriend, Alana's best friend Mitchy, is disguised as a [[witch]]; and Alana's boyfriend Mo is disguised as a [[bird]]. Also along are Carne, the train conductor, and a [[Magic (illusion)|magician]] hired to entertain the crowd.

Ed is murdered prior to boarding and the killer dresses himself in Ed's Groucho Marx mask, allowing him to board the train unnoticed. As the train journeys into the wilderness, the killer wanders amongst the students, who believe him to be Ed. In the [[sleeping car|sleeper]] bathroom, he murders Jackson by smashing his head into a mirror. Carne finds Jackson's bloodied body in the bathroom, still donning the lizard costume. When Carne returns to the scene with the brakemaster Charlie, the killer has hidden Jackson's body and is now posing in the lizard costume; as he appears conscious, Charlie assures Carne that the partygoer was merely drunk.

Mitchy goes with the killer, whom she believes to be Jackson, to a [[Sleeping car#Compartments and Double Bedrooms|compartment]] where she attempts to seduce him. As she closes her eyes, he caresses her with Jackson's severed hand before murdering her. Carne subsequently finds her corpse in the compartment with her throat slashed. Alana stumbles upon the scene, and Carne informs her that Mitchy is dead. During a magic show held by the magician and his female assistant, Doc finds Mo stabbed to death, though the partying onlookers assume the scene to be a prank. Carne stops the train and sequesters the students in one car; while doing so, two [[pullman porter]]s find the corpse of Pet, another student. 

Suspecting Kenny may be involved, Alana recalls the prank to Doc, and recounts her attempt to visit Kenny at the psychiatric hospital. Doc subsequently seals himself inside a room in the sleeper car where the killer is hiding, and is murdered; shortly after, Alana and Carne find his [[decapitation|decapitated]] body. Believing the magician may be Kenny in disguise, Alana notifies Carne, who goes to lock him inside the parlor car; there he finds the magician's female assistant, but the porters are unable to find the magician.

Alana is sequestered in a locked compartment for her safety, which the masked killer infiltrates with an axe, and she is pursued through the train. While in-between cars, she manages to push the killer overboard, unaware that he has managed to hold on below. After finding the magician's body in his [[Indian Basket Trick|sword box]], Alana runs through the train car and finds Charlie seated with his head resting in his hands. She tells him the magician is dead, and lays her head on the table, when he grabs her by her wrists. As she looks up, she realizes it is Kenny dressed in Charlie's uniform. He removes the cap, revealing a blonde wig, and Alana realizes he had been posing in [[drag (clothing)|drag]] as the magician's female assistant.

Alana apologizes to Kenny about the prank, but he refuses to accept and forces her to kiss him; the kiss causes Kenny to relive his memories from the prank and drives him deeper into insanity. Carne rushes to the scene and beats down Kenny with a shovel, causing him to fall out the open door of the baggage car to his presumed death. His body lands in a nearly frozen river and floats away as the train roars off.

==Themes==
The motivation for the villain in ''Terror Train'', similarly to other slasher films, is based on [[revenge]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Slasher Films: An International Filmography, 1960 Through 2001|author=Armstrong, Kent Byron|year=2003|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-786-41462-8|p=314}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, as film scholar John Kenneth Muir notes, the film's central organizing principle is "[[magic (illusion)|magic]], or the often undetectable gulf between reality and [[illusion]]...In other words, characters live and die in ''Terror Train'' based, in large part, on how they perceive the reality or non-reality around them." Muir adds: "If the would-be victims can see through the illusion, they tend to survive. If they can't do so, they die. It's as simple that, but this approach makes ''Terror Train'' a more complex and layered film than the average slasher picture."{{sfn|Muir|2012|p=137}}

==Production==
===Conception===
Producer Daniel Grodnik had the idea for the film's central narrative, which he had wanted to be "like ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' on a train."&lt;ref name=grodnik&gt;{{cite av media|title=Destination Death: An Interview with Daniel Grodnik|publisher=Scream Factory|work=Terror Train|medium=Blu-ray featurette|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grodnik had been a friend of ''Halloween'' director [[John Carpenter]] and producer [[Debra Hill]], both of whom gave him their blessing when he told them of his idea.&lt;ref name=grodnik/&gt; Grodnik pitched the film to American producer [[Sandy Howard]], who was impressed by the concept.&lt;ref name=grodnik/&gt; 

The film was the first motion picture directed by Roger Spottiswoode (a former editor for [[Sam Peckinpah]]),&lt;ref name=grodnik/&gt; who would go on to make such films as  ''[[Turner &amp; Hooch]]'' (1989), ''[[Air America (film)|Air America]]'' (1990), and ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies]]'' (1997). Spottiswoode was hired to direct the film by Sandy Howard on the condition that he also edit the film{{sfn|Rockoff|2016|p=94}} (though Anne Henderson was later brought in to edit).{{sfn|Muir|2012|p=136}} Because it was made under a Canadian [[tax shelter]], Daniel Grodnik was appointed executive producer, as he was legally unable to serve as a primary producer.&lt;ref name=grodnik/&gt;

There was no stage show magician in the original script, but producer Howard was a fan of magic tricks and illusions, so a magician character was written in.&lt;ref name=carmody/&gt; Copperfield's character becomes the suspect at one point of the movie, but it turns out to be a red herring when the real killer is revealed to be Kenny Hampson. There is some confusion about David Copperfield's character's name. Twice, in the movie the Conductor calls out to him as "Ken", but this is when it is believed by he and the passengers that he is Kenny Hampson, the murderer. Additionally, his assistant calls out to him as "Ken," but since his assistant is Kenny in disguise, this could have been an intentional misdirection. In the credits, he is simply listed as "The Magician."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|title=Terror Train|people=Spottiswoode, Roger (dir.)|year=1980|publisher=20th Century Fox|medium=Film credits}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casting===
Producer Grodnik sought Jamie Lee Curtis for the lead role of Alana Maxwell based on her performance in the successful ''Halloween'', released two years prior.&lt;ref name=grodnik/&gt; Curtis was also signed on to star in [[Paul Lynch (director)|Paul Lynch]]'s ''[[Prom Night (1980 film)|Prom Night]]'', which she filmed in Toronto two months before production began on ''Terror Train''.{{efn|''Prom Night'' was filmed in the late summer of 1979,&lt;ref name=hamilton&gt;{{cite av media| title  =The Horrors of Hamilton High: The Making of Prom Night| url =https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3995520/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1| author      = Felsher, Michael|medium= Blu-ray featurette| publisher= Synapse Films|year =2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; while filming for ''Terror Train'' did not begin until November 1979.}} Veteran actor [[Ben Johnson (actor)|Ben Johnson]] was cast as Carne, the train conductor, whom Grodnik said was "amused" to have been in a horror film amongst such a young cast.&lt;ref name=grodnik/&gt; 

The majority of the supporting cast was made of Canadian actors, including [[Hart Bochner]], Sandee Currie, and [[Anthony Sherwood]]. The film included a number of untrained actors, including Derek MacKinnon in the role of the villain, as well as illusionist [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]] as the Magician, and rock singer [[Vanity (singer)|Vanity]] as one of the coed partygoers.&lt;ref name=trap/&gt;&lt;ref name=rs&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|title=Rockers' 20 Best Appearances in Eighties Horror Movies|author=Kreps, Daniel et al.|date=October 31, 2014|accessdate=January 1, 2018|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/rockers-20-best-appearances-in-eighties-horror-movies-20141031/vanity-terror-train-1980-20141031|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223011850/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/rockers-20-best-appearances-in-eighties-horror-movies-20141031/vanity-terror-train-1980-20141031|archivedate=December 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Set construction===
[[File:Cheyenne River sleeper in Sandwich, MA.jpg|thumb|Sleeper used in the film, located along a siding in [[Sandwich, Massachusetts]] in 2014]]
To create the train for the film, the producers leased an actual [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] locomotive from the [[Steamtown, U.S.A.|Steamtown Foundation]] in [[Bellows Falls, Vermont]].&lt;ref name=carmody/&gt;{{sfn|Rockoff|2016|p=94}} The train's engine was renumbered from its original [[Canadian Pacific Railway No. 1293|1293]] to 1881, and, along with five passenger cars, painted black with silver stripes.&lt;ref name=trap/&gt; Afterward, the Steamtown Foundation reverted the engine back to its original number and had it restored to a historic color and lettering scheme. Production designer Glenn Bywdwell crafted the interiors of the train in an [[Art Deco]] style.&lt;ref name=bydwell/&gt; As of July 2014, Canadian Pacific Railway No. 1293 continues to be an "operable locomotive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|series=Steamtown NHS: Special History Study. |url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/steamtown/shs3e.htm|title=Canadian Pacific Railway No. 1293|work=National Park Services|date=February 14, 2002|accessdate=December 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
Principal photography for ''Terror Train'' mainly took place in and around [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec, Canada]].&lt;ref name=grodnik/&gt; The shoot began on November 21, 1979, and was completed on December 23.&lt;ref name=ihorror&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ihorror.com/jamie-lee-curtis-making-scream-queen-terror-train/|work=iHorror|title=Jamie Lee Curtis: The Making of a Scream Queen – Terror Train|author=Grove, David|date=October 23, 2016|accessdate=December 30, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025192037/http://ihorror.com/jamie-lee-curtis-making-scream-queen-terror-train/|archivedate=October 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bulk of the film's train sequences were shot first, while the film's opening sequence was shot on December 22, 1979, the penultimate day of the shoot; filming of it took place at a real fraternity house belonging to [[McGill University]].&lt;ref name=ihorror/&gt; The final day of shooting (December 23) consisted of a small crew completing the footage of Kenny's body plummeting from the train into a frozen river below, which was shot on location in [[New Hampshire]], United States.&lt;ref name=ihorror/&gt; The stunt man was reportedly unable to withstand the freezing temperature of the water, leading art director Guy Comtois played the part of the dead killer instead.&lt;ref name=ihorror/&gt; 

The interior train sequences posed numerous obstacles for the crew, specifically cinematographer [[John Alcott]], who devised a unique method of lighting ''Terror Train'' given the limited space and scant natural lighting of the sets: He rewired the entire train and mounted individual dimmers on the exteriors of the carriage cars.{{sfn|Rockoff|2016|pages=94–5}} Utilizing a variety of bulbs with different wattages, and controlling them with the external dimmers, Alcott could light the set in a very fast, efficient manner. At times, Alcott also used medical lights-"pen torches"- to hand light the actors' faces,&lt;ref name=trap&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.terrortrap.com/interviews/rogerspottiswoode/|title=All Aboard...If You Dare!: An Interview with Roger Spottiswoode|date=April 2011|work=The Terror Trap|accessdate=December 29, 2017|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130203134934/http://www.terrortrap.com/interviews/rogerspottiswoode/|archivedate=February 3, 2013|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Christmas lights]].&lt;ref name=carmody&gt;{{cite av media|title=Riding the Rails: An Interview with Don Carmody|publisher=Scream Factory|work=Terror Train|medium=Blu-ray featurette|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; To capture some of the film's footage, Alcott used a small lens he had previously used while shooting ''[[Barry Lyndon]]''.&lt;ref name=trap/&gt; To achieve the rocking motion of a real train on film, a crew was appointed to push on each side of the stationary train car in order for the interior sequences to appear as though they were taking place on a moving train.&lt;ref name=bydwell&gt;{{cite av media|title=All Aboard: An Interview with Ben Glydwell|publisher=Scream Factory|work=Terror Train|medium=Blu-ray featurette|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking a cue from director [[John Ford]], Ben Johnson originally asked director Spottiswoode to give his character Carne less dialogue in ''Terror Train'', rather than more.&lt;ref name=trap/&gt; Jamie Lee Curtis also provided input in regard to her character during the filming process: The kissing sequence between her character and that of the killer was an idea that she originated: "I just thought that if she kissed him that it would bring a lot of tenderness to the scene and to the film," she recalled. "The kiss was totally my idea. All during filming, I was looking for ways to make my character more interesting but there weren’t many opportunities because most of the film was about the action and the killer."&lt;ref name=ihorror/&gt;

Canadian actor Derek MacKinnon, who played the masked killer, appears in 11 scenes in ''Terror Train'', wearing a different costume or masked disguise in each scene, including his real character of Kenny.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} There was friction between director Spottiswoode and McKinnon during the shoot, which Spottiswoode claimed was a result of his inexperience:  "He wasn’t an actor," Spottiswoode recalled. "He was a [[Transvestism|transvestite]] from the streets of Montreal, and he wasn’t familiar with the concepts of a contract and showing up for work on time. In a strange way though he did a pretty good job. He was familiar with that world of cheap theater and was strangely effective."&lt;ref name=ihorror/&gt;

==Release==
The film was purchased for theatrical release in the United States by [[20th Century Fox]], who had recently garnered attention with the release of ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977).&lt;ref name=grodnik/&gt; The studio spent an estimated $5 million on an advertising campaign for the film,&lt;ref name="times"/&gt; which would be their only foray into the [[slasher film]] sub-genre during its peak years.{{sfn|Rockoff|2016|p=95–6}} The campaign included billboards and trade advertisements, as well as several posters: The first one-sheet featured the killer dressed in the Groucho Marx mask, brandishing a knife; a second one-sheet emphasized the film's college youth setting, including the same image of the killer in addition to a bonfire and a train in the foreground.{{Sfn|Nowell|2010|p=206}}

==Reception==

===Box office===
''Terror Train'' opened in the United States on October 3, 1980, and grossed an estimate $8,000,000 at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1980/0TETR.php|title=Terror Train|work=The Numbers|accessdate=December 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical response===
''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' deemed the film "competent" in a mildly positive review,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Variety|title=Terror Train|url=https://variety.com/1979/film/reviews/terror-train-1200424652/|accessdate=December 31, 2017|date=December 31, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film one out of four stars, writing: "The classic horror films of the 1930s appealed to the intelligence of its audiences, to their sense of humor and irony. Movies like ''Terror Train'', and all of its sordid predecessors and its rip-offs still to come, just don't care. They're a series of sensations, strung together on a plot. Any plot will do. Just don't forget the knife, and the girl, and the blood." However, he conceded that "it's not a rock-bottom-budget, schlock exploitation film."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19801009/REVIEWS/10090301 |title=Terror Train |author=[[Roger Ebert|Ebert, Roger]] |work=Chicago Sun-Times|via=RogerEbert.com |date=October 9, 1980|accessdate=December 30, 2017}} {{rating|1|4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ed Blank of the ''[[Pittsburgh Press]]'' criticized the film for its lack of characterization and backstory, summarizing: "''Terror Train''.

{{nihongo|'''''The 3rd Birthday'''''|ザ・サード バースデイ|Za Sādo Bāsudei|lead=yes}} is a [[Third-person shooter|third-person]] [[role-playing shooters|role-playing shooter]] co-developed by [[Square Enix]] and [[HexaDrive]], and published by Square Enix for the [[PlayStation Portable]]. It was released in Japan in 2010 and in North America and Europe in 2011. The game is both the third entry in the ''Parasite Eve'' video game series, based on the [[Parasite Eve|titular Japanese novel]], and a spin-off, having only a loose connection to events from past games. The game features a [[third-person shooter]]-based combat system with role-playing mechanics. A key mechanic is the Overdive ability, which allows the player to possess pre-positioned human allies and inflict damage upon enemies.

The game takes place in 2013, a year after creatures known as the Twisted have appeared from beneath Manhattan and decimated the city. To fight back against the Twisted, an investigatory team called the Counter Twisted Investigation (CTI) is formed. Among their number is series protagonist [[Aya Brea]], who was found unconscious and suffering amnesia two years before the game's events. Using her Overdive ability, Aya travels into the past to alter the outcome of battles against the Twisted. At the same time, Aya attempts to find out the origin of the Twisted and regain her memories.

''The 3rd Birthday'' was created as a conceptual rebirth for Aya's character, as well as a means of re-introducing her to the gaming community, with it being over a decade since the last game in the series. Among the staff were Hajime Tabata, [[Yoshinori Kitase]], [[Motomu Toriyama]], [[Isamu Kamikokuryo]], and Aya's original designer [[Tetsuya Nomura]]. Originally announced as an episodic title for mobile phones, the game was later changed into a PSP exclusive. Upon release, the game reached sixth place in Japanese sales charts, and was among the top five games in North American and UK sales charts during its opening months. Reviews have been mixed; critics praised the presentation and several parts of the gameplay, while opinions were mixed about the story, and many cited difficulties with camera control and some of the shooter mechanics. Several reviewers have also made negative comments on Aya's portrayal.

==Gameplay==
[[File:3rd Birthday gameplay.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Combat in ''The 3rd Birthday''. Shown is Aya in battle with a Twisted, along with the health of selectable human units, her ammo count, and other [[HUD (video gaming)|HUD]] displays.]]
''The 3rd Birthday'' is a [[Third-person shooter|third-person]] [[role-playing shooters|role-playing shooter]]. The player controls series protagonist [[Aya Brea]] through rendered-to-scale environments in from a third person perspective.&lt;ref name= "GSreview"/&gt; The game plays out as a series of missions, between which Aya rests at the Counter Twisted Investigation headquarters, which acts as the game's main hub. In the hub, Aya can receive briefings for missions, view additional documents, buy and customize new weapons. She also has the option to transport back there should she die during a mission. The game can be saved both at the hub and in safe zones within missions.&lt;ref name= "T3Bmanual"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.jp.square-enix.com/document/manual/1371/T3BD_PSPmanual_PUBb.pdf?SQEXSC=u3mvbop6dcbv46mkc53v3loo01|title=The 3rd Birthday North American instruction manual|format=PDF|publisher=[[Square Enix]]|accessdate=2015-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of each mission, Aya is given a grade based on performance, enemies killed, and the number of times she died. Depending on her score, she will earn differing amounts of Bounty Points, a currency used to customize weapons and repair protective gear in the hub area.&lt;ref name= "T3Bmanual"/&gt;

During missions, players navigate a series of linear linked areas fighting off multiple enemies. Items can be picked up during missions, such as grenades and medical kits. Aya has access to multiple guns for use in combat, including handguns, assault rifles and shotguns. By holding down a button on the controller, Aya automatically aims at an enemy and can fire at will. Taking cover behind objects or shields, or standing idle outside of battle, allows Aya to regenerate health. While in combat, an energy meter is charged and can be activated when full. When activated, Aya entered "Liberation Mode", a state enabling her to move around the battlefield at high speed for a short period of time.&lt;ref name= "GSreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "T3Bmanual"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGNreview"/&gt;

In most battle situations, Aya is accompanied by a group of allied NPC (non-playable character) soldiers that the player can direct around the battle area. Available commands include offering supporting fire, directly attacking enemies, or staying behind cover. They can also all fire at the same enemy in certain situations, dealing high damage. Each NPC has a separate health meter, and is permanently removed from battle upon defeat. Central to combat is Overdive, an ability which enables Aya to transmit herself between bodies. If her health is low, Aya can transport into the body of an allied NPC, taking on their health level, position and current weapon in the process. NPCs not controlled by Aya are controlled by the game's AI. Aya can remain in a body for the duration of a level, or until the unit has died. If Aya cannot jump to another body, she dies and the level must either be restarted or exited. Overdive can be activated at any time, enabling Aya to transport around the battlefield to avoid enemy attacks or save herself when her current unit's health is low. Overdive can also be used to attack enemies if Aya maintains a sustained assault. After a time, a triangle icon appears on enemies, allowing her to perform an Overdive attack, dealing high damage to the targeted enemy.&lt;ref name= "GSreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "T3Bmanual"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGNreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "EGreview"/&gt;

During combat, Aya gains experience points and gains experience levels when a certain quantity is achieved. Gaining a level both restores her health and raises her maximum health and energy levels. Weapons also gain levels the more they are used.&lt;ref name= "GSreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "T3Bmanual"/&gt; In addition to leveling up, Aya's stats can be customized using Over Energy (OE) clips found during missions or acquired during Overdive attacks. Using a 3x3 grid accessed in the hub area, certain OE clips grand different stat boosts and abilities. Creating a new grid automatically deletes the effects of the original.&lt;ref name= "T3Bmanual"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGNreview"/&gt;

==Plot==
The game's story plays out in episodes, similar to a television series, with many events told out of sequence. On Christmas Eve of 2012, monstrous creatures dubbed as "Babels" appear in [[New York City]]. Along with lifeforms spawned by them called the Twisted, they lay waste to the city and consume any human in their path. By the following year, an investigatory team known as the CTI (Counter Twisted Investigation) has been formed. One of the CTI members is Aya Brea, who was found outside St. Thomson's Cathedral in 2010, just before the Babels and Twisted began appearing. Dr. Hyde Bohr, Chief of the CTI, finds that Aya is suffering from amnesia, and that her personality has changed. After taking Aya in, the CTI discovered that she was capable of transferring her soul from body to body independent of time, an ability dubbed "Overdive", which enables her to fight the Twisted.

Bohr and the others planned to use this unique ability to travel back through time and prevent the disaster, developing a machine called "Overdive System" to allow Aya to travel into the past and change events. As she embarks on each mission, she is confronted by powerful, sentient Twisted born from corrupted humans, later dubbed High Ones. One such High One is Kyle Madigan, a man she met and fell in love with during ''[[Parasite Eve II]]''. As she defeats each High One, she regains pieces of her memory, most prominently her memories of being engaged to Kyle, and the existence of Eve Brea, her adopted sister. After an incident that saw the CTI HQ and the Overdive device destroyed by the Kyle High One, Aya reunites with Kunihiko Maeda, a man who aided her in ''[[Parasite Eve (video game)|Parasite Eve]]'', to resolve the entire mystery behind the appearance of the Babel, Twisted and High Ones. Aya eventually discovers that Bohr is himself a High One. Bohr masterminded the death of other High Ones in order to form the Grand Babel, which functions like a giant Overdive system. Bohr seeks to dive back in the past to Time Zero, the point where events were set in motion, to fulfill his plan for the survival of his own species from a time war cycle between humans, the Twisted, and the High Ones. Aya battles Bohr and is pulled with him into Time Zero, where she discovers the truth.

In 2010 at St. Thomson's Cathedral, Aya and Kyle were going to be married. The Cathedral was attacked by a SWAT team and Aya was killed. Eve attempted to save Aya by sending her consciousness into Aya's body, creating the Overdive ability. The event caused Aya's consciousness to separate from her body and fragment through time to create the Twisted, Eve's consciousness to become trapped in Aya's body, and parts of Eve's body to be transplanted into people close to the pair to create the High Ones. The "Aya" of the main story is in fact Eve in Aya's body. After these revelations, Eve returns to her body and is asked by Bohr to assimilate him and trigger the birth of a new species. Eve refuses, and when Bohr tries to force the process, a reborn Aya shoots him to death. Aya then reveals that to avert the birth of the Twisted and High Ones, the sources (Aya and Eve) must be removed. Expressing her regret at not being able to marry Kyle, she tells Eve to shoot her. In a fit of emotion, Eve switches bodies with Aya before shooting her, creating a new timeline where Eve's body and Aya's consciousness do not exist, erasing the game's events. Though Eve offers to marry Kyle, he refuses and hints that he is going to find Aya. In a post-credits sequence four years after the game's events, Eve is walking the streets of New York and is wished a "Happy Fourth Birthday" by a woman resembling Aya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The 3rd Birthday Insider|publisher=Square Enix|chapter=Unfolded Story|isbn=978-4757531130|language=Japanese|date=2011-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
Concepts for a third installment in the ''Parasite Eve'' video game series had been around for some time. As work was being finished on ''[[Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII]]'', Nomura voiced his wish to create a new game for the character Aya Brea, and this time it was taken up.&lt;ref name="3RDmobile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.famitsu.com/interview/article/1211430_1493.html|title=クリエーターインタビュー【4】『The 3rd Birthday（ザ・サード・バースデイ）』|language=Japanese|publisher=''[[Famitsu]]''|date=2007-10-22|accessdate=2015-04-08|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427235324/http://www.famitsu.com/interview/article/1211430_1493.html|archivedate=2014-04-27 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the story of ''[[Parasite Eve II]]'' not leaving many avenues for a sequel, the development team wanted to take advantage of advancing gaming technology and popularity by creating a mature gaming experience that would re-introduce Aya to players around the world.&lt;ref name= "GSpreview"/&gt; The main staff consisted of director Hajime Tabata, producer [[Yoshinori Kitase]], creative producer and character designer [[Tetsuya Nomura]], art director [[Isamu Kamikokuryo]], scenario director [[Motomu Toriyama]], and main writer Toshimitsu Takeuchi.&lt;ref name= "GSpreview"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2007/09/28/all-star-stafflist-for-parasite-eve-sequel|title=All-Star Stafflist for Parasite Eve Sequel|author=Gantayat, Anoop|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2007-09-28|accessdate=2015-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.famitsu.com/event/tgs/2007/1210654_1603.html|script-title=ja:【イベントリポート】『キングダム ハーツ』新プロジェクトの全貌も！ スクウェア･エニックスクローズドシアター徹底リポート|language=Japanese|publisher=''[[Famitsu]]''|date=2007-09-20|accessdate=2015-04-08|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080815205452/http://www.famitsu.com/event/tgs/2007/1210654_1603.html|archivedate=2008-08-15|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nomura requested Tabata as the two had worked well together on previous projects, and Nomura was busy with other projects despite his strong interest.&lt;ref name= "AndriaNomura"/&gt; ''The 3rd Birthday'' was originally announced in May 2007 as an episodic mobile game developed by [[Square Enix]] for Japan's [[Freedom of Mobile Multimedia Access|FOMA]] mobile service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/20070514/3rdbd.htm|title=スクウェア・エニックス、iモード「The 3rd Birthday」発表「パラサイト・イヴ」のアヤの全く新しい物語|language=Japanese|publisher=Game Watch Impress|date=2007-05-14|accessdate=2015-04-08|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130628225900/http://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/20070514/3rdbd.htm|archivedate=2013-06-28|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, during a special Square Enix event, the game was announced to have changed to a game for the [[PlayStation Portable]].&lt;ref name="PSP"&gt;{{cite web | date=2008-08-02 | title=【速報】『ファイナルファンタジー アギトXIII』のPSP版発売が決定 DKΣ3713リポート | url= http://www.famitsu.com/game/news/1217142_1124.html | language=Japanese| publisher=''[[Famitsu]]''|accessdate=2013-10-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029204717/http://www.famitsu.com/game/news/1217142_1124.html |archivedate=2013-10-29 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the reason, as stated by Nomura, was that the desired level of realism was not possible on mobile phones.&lt;ref name="FamRealism"/&gt; The game became exclusive to PSP as Tabata wanted to make full usage of the platform's hardware capabilities, along with it being a gaming platform available worldwide.&lt;ref name= "GSpreview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-3rd-birthday-impressions-and-interview/1100-6266275/|title=The 3rd Birthday Impressions and Interview|author=Parker, Laura|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=2010-06-16|accessdate=2015-04-08|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150408185718/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-3rd-birthday-impressions-and-interview/1100-6266275/|archivedate=2015-04-08|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tabata and his team worked on ''The 3rd Birthday'' at the same time as fellow mobile-turned-PSP title ''[[Final Fantasy Type-0]]''. Square Enix requested Tabata to concentrate on finishing ''The 3rd Birthday'', leading to ''Type-0'' almost being cancelled.&lt;ref name="Type0cancel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2015/03/16/tabata-final-fantasy-type-0-was-almost-cancelled|title=Tabata: Final Fantasy Type-0 Was Almost Cancelled|last=Moser|first=Casside|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2015-03-15|accessdate=2015-03-15|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6X4H51FBY?url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/16/tabata-final-fantasy-type-0-was-almost-cancelled|archivedate=2015-03-16|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final version of the game was co-developed by Square Enix and [[HexaDrive]], a company created by former [[Capcom]] staff members.&lt;ref name= "HexaInfo"/&gt; As the new form of ''The 3rd Birthday'' had transformed into a third-person shooter, Square Enix wanted staff members with experience at developing such games, and then-company CEO [[Yoichi Wada]] recommended HexaDrive to Tabata. As multiple HexaDrive staff members had also worked on fellow shooter ''[[Lost Planet: Extreme Condition]]'', Tabata agreed to the collaboration.&lt;ref name="HexaInfo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.famitsu.com/news/201504/06075460.html|title=『FF零式HD』の開発を手掛けたヘキサドライブ松下社長に直撃！　田畑Dとは『FFXV』でも……!?|publisher=''[[Famitsu]]''|language=Japanese|date=2015-04-06|accessdate=2015-04-06|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6XaP78PWu?url=http://www.famitsu.com/news/201504/06075460.html|archivedate=2015-04-06|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While aiming for a high quality product, the team designed the game as if for the [[PlayStation 3]] home console, then worked to fit it onto the PSP.

While designing levels to function with the game's Overdive system, the team considered what the level would hold, how often players would utilize the function, the difficulty of levels, and the positioning and strength of enemies.&lt;ref name= "SilAya"/&gt; During development, a questionnaire was circulated around company staff concerning the character Aya, to find out which of the planned features was popular. One of those that survived in the final game was Aya's clothes being damaged when she was hit by an enemy, which was used to emphasize her sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.famitsu.com/news/201012/22037175.html|script-title=ja:『ザ・サード バースデイ』開発者インタビュー【その1】――シャワーシーンでレーティングが... ...|language=Japanese|publisher=''[[Famitsu]]''|date=2010-12-22|accessdate=2015-04-08|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204035317/http://www.famitsu.com/news/201012/22037175.html|archivedate=2014-02-04|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nomura was among the first to suggest this feature originally.&lt;ref name= "AndriaNomura"/&gt;

Nomura worked on the character designs for the main cast. He was originally only going to work on Aya and Eve, but after seeing the settings for the other characters, he offered to design them too. The team wanted to emphasize the character's sexuality. As part of this, the team included a scene where Aya takes a shower.

This meant that it would be difficult to create a straightforward sequel, so the team instead decided to make the game about Aya's return.&lt;ref name= "SilAya"/&gt; Toriyama imagined story concepts such as the snowy New York setting and the image of a bloodstained wedding dress. These two concepts survived the platform change. Over the course of the development, he adjusted the plot numerous times to be more adult-oriented and to include complex narrative twists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Gantayat, Anoop |date=2010-11-23 |url=http://andriasang.com/comrw1/toriyama_3rd_birthday/ |title=The 3rd Birthday: Motomu Toriyama Shares His Thoughts |publisher=Andriasang|accessdate=2015-04-08|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121225032939/http://andriasang.com/comrw1/toriyama_3rd_birthday/|archivedate=2012-12-25|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original concept was to make the game feel like a television drama, with multiple cliffhangers and moments of high drama.&lt;ref name="3RDmobile"/&gt; The game was designed from the outset as having no direct connection to the previous ''Parasite Eve'' games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.famitsu.com/game/news/1236866_1124.html|title=『FF』シリーズのクリエイターが集結した、『ザ・サード バースデイ』インタビュー完全版|language=Japanese|publisher=''[[Famitsu]]''|date=2010-06-25|accessdate=2015-04-08|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319041542/http://www.famitsu.com/game/news/1236866_1124.html|archivedate=2015-03-19|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game's title came from it being Aya's third video game appearance, as well as it being a noticeable change in setting.

It was originally only going to represent the number, but Nomura added the extra lines to display the game's "multi-faceted" nature.&lt;ref name="3RDmobile"/&gt; A notable addition was the option to skip cutscenes, a feature the team regretted leaving out of ''Crisis Core''.&lt;ref name="triviadev"&gt;{{cite web | author=Gantayat, Anoop| date=2010-10-14| title=The 3rd Birthday Has Skippable Event Scenes| url=http://andriasang.com/comq6w/3rd_birthday_and_crisis_core/ | publisher=Amdriasang | accessdate=2010-10-14|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121225031024/http://andriasang.com/comq6w/3rd_birthday_and_crisis_core/|archivedate=2012-12-25|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
{{Main|Music of the Parasite Eve series}}
The music for ''The 3rd Birthday'' was composed by Mitsuto Suzuki and [[Tsuyoshi Sekito]], with additional work by original ''Parasite Eve'' composer [[Yoko Shimomura]].&lt;ref name= "GScomposer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/sound-byte-meet-the-composer-behind-the-3rd-birthday/1100-6330891/|title=Sound Byte: Meet the Composer behind The 3rd Birthday|author=Tong, Sophia|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=2011-08-25|accessdate=2015-04-09|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150409161140/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/sound-byte-meet-the-composer-behind-the-3rd-birthday/1100-6330891/|archivedate=2015-04-09|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shimomura was involved from an early stage, when ''The 3rd Birthday'' was still a mobile game.&lt;ref name="3RDmobile"/&gt; When she was originally asked to compose for the title, she was involved with a number of other projects which made handling the entire score difficult. When asked whether she wanted to work with anyone on the composition, she suggested Suzuki and Sekito. The general instruction was to follow the pattern used by the music for ''Parasite Eve'', with Suzuki and Sekito handling the majority of tracks, going so far as referring to the songs from the original ''Parasite Eve'' when handling remixes of old themes. In keeping with the game's other development goals, Shimomura wanted to alter some of the established music, although she asked the team to include familiar themes from earlier games for fans. Suzuki was responsible for a large amount of track mixing. Sekito was mostly involved with choosing and helping with instrumentation, in particular whether to include symphonic music. The composers had a relatively high degree of freedom, but they also had problems when composing some tracks that did not fit into selected scenes. Re-orchestrations of two pieces of classical music, "[[Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme, BWV 140|Sleepers Wake]]" by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], and "[[Joy to the World]]", a popular Christmas song, were used by Suzuki and Shimomura respectively to represent key moments and motifs within the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.famitsu.com/news/201101/09039068.html|script-title=ja:『ザ・サード バースデイ』の楽曲に迫るインタビュー完全版！|language=Japanese|publisher=''[[Famitsu]]''|date=2011-01-09|accessdate=2015-04-09|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804061313/http://www.famitsu.com/news/201101/09039068.html|archivedate=2012-08-04|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The order of songs in the game was created to reflect the situation in a level. These variations were emphasized during mixing, while they also needed to adjust the mixing and track length based on the game as a whole.&lt;ref name= "GScomposer"/&gt; For the game's theme song, the company collaborated with Japanese rock band [[Superfly (band)|Superfly]].

Japanese gaming magazine ''[[Famitsu]]'' praised the title's gameplay, calling Aya "deeply customizable", finding the Overdive system and its strategic elements exhilarating and saying that those undaunted by the high difficulty would find much enjoyment in repeated playthroughs.&lt;ref name="FamReview"/&gt; Jeremy Parish of [[1UP.com]] called it "an interesting blend of RPG and shooter", praising the working of Overdive.&lt;ref name="1UPreview"/&gt; [[Eurogamer]]'s Kristan Reed was less enthusiastic, referring to the conflicts with the Twisted as "relentless and ultimately repetitive", finding the high difficulty off-putting and Aya's movement speed unsuited for battle.&lt;ref name= "EGreview"/&gt; ''[[Game Informer]]''{{'}}s Annette Gonzalez enjoyed the control layout and gameplay, but cited difficulties with the camera.&lt;ref name= "GIreview"/&gt; Carolyn Petit of [[GameSpot]] said that the game sometimes succeeded in creating tension, but that other battles were frustrating and the camera was difficult.&lt;ref name= "GSreview"/&gt; [[IGN]]'s Patrick Kolan was pleased with the effort put into the game, and generally praised the battle and later levels, despite several cases of repetition during the main campaign.&lt;ref name="IGNreview"/&gt; Emily Gera of VideoGamer.com found the basic shooter gameplay repetitive, but felt that the gameplay was saved by the Overdive ability and the quality of fights.&lt;ref name="VGreview"/&gt;

Parish said the game looked "gorgeous" and the soundtrack "exceptional".&lt;ref name="1UPreview"/&gt; Petit praised the CGI cutscenes and varied level environments, and said the score "shifts adeptly between haunting and thrilling to suit the action."&lt;ref name= "GSreview"/&gt; Kolan generally called the game one of the best-looking entries on the platform, and praised the soundtrack, despite it being "a little ho-hum".&lt;ref name="IGNreview"/&gt; Gonzalez also praised the cutscenes, while citing the environments as "[ranging] from detailed to drab".&lt;ref name= "GIreview"/&gt;

''Famitsu'' was less positive about the story, saying that the mix of different elements made it "a bit hard to follow."&lt;ref name="FamReview"/&gt; Parish positively noted connections to the second game, but found the later story developments either confusing or weak, and disliked the way returning supporting characters had been changed.&lt;ref name="1UPreview"/&gt; Petit said that those who wanted a straightforward story would be disappointed, and positively noted its exploration of existence, identity, and memory. Her main criticism was with the dialogue, which she referred to as "stilted".&lt;ref name= "GSreview"/&gt; Kolan also faulted the voice acting and localization, especially when compared to games such as ''[[Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together]]''.&lt;ref name="IGNreview"/&gt; Gonzalez cited the story as intriguing, with "plenty of plot twists".&lt;ref name= "GIreview"/&gt; Parish and Petit were both highly critical of Aya's portrayal: Parish disliked both her outfit, which seemed to conform too much female stereotypes in video games, and the clothes-tearing mechanic, which seemed to be included merely to flaunt her sexuality.&lt;ref name="1UPreview"/&gt; Petit shared many points of criticism with Parish, also noting that Aya's portrayal of "one-part action hero, one-part submissive sex object" was wrong for a lead character, and that Aya's in-combat vocals were not suited to the game's situations.&lt;ref name= "GSreview"/&gt; Reed referred to Aya as "[a] sighing, whimpering lead character".&lt;ref name= "EGreview"/&gt;

'''The Animation Guild, I.A.T.S.E. Local 839''' is a professional [[guild]] and [[trade union|union]] of [[animation]] artists, writers and technicians.  It was formed in 1952. In 2002, the organization changed its name from '''Motion Picture Screen Cartoonists'''.

The full name of the organization is The Animation Guild and Affiliated Optical Electronic and Graphic Arts, Local 839 of the [[International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees]] and Moving Picture Technicians, Artists and Allied Crafts of the United States, its Territories and Canada, [[American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations]]/[[Canadian Labour Congress]].

== Governance ==

The Animation Guild is governed by its membership, which meets every two months. To supervise the Guild's affairs, every three years the membership elects a sixteen-person '''Executive Board''' by secret mail ballot. The Executive Board meets every month. As of December 2016, the key executives on the Board are:

*'''President''': Karen Carnegie Johnson
*'''Vice President''': Jeanette Moreno King
*'''Business Representative''': Jason MacLeod
The Business Representative is the only paid, full-time elected official of the Guild, which also has a paid staff. All other Board members work at studios under the Guild's jurisdiction.

== Collective bargaining agreements ==

The Animation Guild negotiates and enforces [[collective bargaining agreements]], or '''CBA'''s, with companies employing persons under its [[The Animation Guild, I.A.T.S.E. Local 839#Jurisdiction|jurisdiction]]. These CBAs:

*define terms and conditions of [[employment]];
*set minimum [[wages]], hours and working conditions;
*provide for a [[grievance]] procedure, whereby the Guild intervenes on behalf of its members in disputes with their employers;
*specify the payment of contributions to the [http://www.mpiphp.org Motion Picture Industry Pension and Health Plans] (MPIPHP), to provide [[health insurance]] and a [[defined-benefit pension]]. The MPIPHP is entirely ''employer-funded'', by hourly contributions and by residuals and supplemental market payments.

All of the terms and conditions of Animation Guild CBAs are ''minimums''; that is, any employee working under a CBA has the unrestricted right to negotiate better terms and conditions than those set forth in the CBA. Such better terms and conditions include but are not limited to:

*"overscale" wages;
*sick pay;
*additional [[Annual leave|vacation]] time;
*provisions to allow employees to work at home or off-premises.

The text of the Guild's current CBAs and sideletters can be found on their [http://www.animationguild.org website].

=== Animation Guild 401(k) Plan ===

Although not part of the CBA, the Guild sponsors a multi-employer, employee-funded [[401(k) plan]] to which virtually all of its employers are signed. The [[401(k) plan]] was administered by [[Mass Mutual]] in the past, but is currently managed by [[The Vanguard Group]].

== Jurisdiction ==

The Animation Guild's [[jurisdiction]] is determined by its parent body, the [[IATSE]], and as defined in its CBA.

=== Work jurisdiction ===

The Guild covers all artistic, creative and technical job categories in the [[animation]] process, with the following exceptions:

*'''Animation camerapersons''' are under the jurisdiction of [http://www.cameraguild.com IATSE Local 600].
*'''Track readers''' and '''soundpersons''' are under the jurisdiction of [http://www.695.com IATSE Local 695].
*'''Animation editors''' are under the jurisdiction of the [[Motion Picture Editors Guild]], IATSE Local 700.
*'''Animation voice actors''' are covered by the [[SAG-AFTRA|Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists]].
*Generally speaking, '''[[animation director]]s''' of theatrical features are not covered, as they are considered management due to their ability to hire and fire employees, but [[animation director]]s in other media such as television are covered.
*Although animation '''[[Television producer|producers]]''', '''production managers''' and non-creative support personnel are not covered under the Guild CBA, [[employers]] will sometimes sign a so-called "non-affiliate" agreement that allows them to cover them for purposes of [[health insurance]] and [[pension]].
*Although most '''animation writers''' are under the Animation Guild's jurisdiction, some are covered by the [[Writers Guild of America, west]].
*So-called "freelancers" are covered under the CBA if they are working as employees of a signator employer. ''Bona fide'' [[independent contractors]] are not covered, since they are not employees of the company for which they perform work.

Although the Guild's traditional [[jurisdiction]] was limited to those working on [[animated film]]s, in recent years the Guild has expanded to the point where a significant percentage of its members are employed in motion picture [[computer graphics]]. Today, both [[Computer graphics#2D|2D]] and [[Computer graphics#3D|3D]] artists work under the Guild's [[jurisdiction]], both in [[animation]] and [[live action]].

=== Geographical jurisdiction ===

All of the Animation Guild's current [[collective bargaining agreements]] are with [[employers]] in [[southern California]]. The [[IATSE]] and other IA locals have [[jurisdiction]] over [[animation]] in other areas of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].

== Membership requirements ==

Membership in the Animation Guild can be acquired in either of two ways:

=== Membership by employment ===

[[Animation]] artists, writers and technicians who are hired by [[The Animation Guild, I.A.T.S.E. Local 839#Animation studios signed with TAG|employers]] signed to Guild [[The Animation Guild, I.A.T.S.E. Local 839#Collective bargaining agreements|CBAs]] will be required to join the Guild after thirty days' employment. The one-time initiation fee consists of two weeks' minimum scale wages for the job category in which the applicant has been hired.

Dues are charged quarterly and are also based upon the scale rate for the job category as of the beginning of the quarter. As of August 2008 the highest dues rate is $101.00.

=== Membership by organizing ===

[[Animation]] artists, writers and technicians who are employed by companies that do not have TAG agreements, may become members if and when the company is organized. Potential members may assist the Guild in its organizing efforts by signing a confidential [https://web.archive.org/web/20090626113051/http://www.animationguild.org/_QandA/whyorganize/whyorganize_1f.htm representation card].

After the employer is organized and signed to a [[The Animation Guild, I.A.T.S.E. Local 839#Collective bargaining agreements|collective bargaining agreement]], employees often are brought into membership without initiation fees.

The Faction became a registered charity in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithoutPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1145820&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0|title=Charity overview|access-date=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their first production was ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' at the [[Brockley Jack Theatre]], London, in October 2008. The Faction is now led by two artistic directors; Mark Leipacher and Rachel Valentine Smith, and is supported by a core ensemble of eleven actors and associate artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thefaction.org.uk/ensemble|title=thefaction|website=thefaction.org.uk|access-date=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

During The Faction's formative years, they toured across the UK, played studio theatres across London, and established an open-air season in [[Brockwell Park]]. They were then invited to be an associate ensemble of the [[New Diorama Theatre]]. With the support of their 5-year relationship at The New Diorama, The Faction was able to trial a more permanent model of working in [[repertory theatre]], with a core ensemble.  

Since 2012, The Faction have produced five annual sell-out repertory seasons, engaging with over 26,000 audience members and 4,000 students. In 2016, The Faction partnered with [[Selfridges]] to create an auditorium in their [[Oxford Street]] store for Shakespeare 400 celebrations, where they produced a version of ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' to critical acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/richard-brownliemarshall/much-ado-about-nothing-at_b_11759604.html|title=''Much Ado About Nothing'' At Selfridges|website=HuffPost UK|access-date=2017-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Faction took their work even further afield later that year, in partnership with the [[British Council]], and the [[American University of Beirut]], producing and co-directing an Arabic premiere production of ''[[King Lear]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aub.edu.lb/news/2016/Pages/malik-lear.aspx|title=AUB – 2016 – ''Al-Malik Lear'' adds Lebanese twist to Shakespearean tragedy|website=www.aub.edu.lb|access-date=2017-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Shakespeare, The Faction have produced work by other classic writers such Cervantes, Euripedes, Gorky, Lorca and Schiller. They also bridge the divide between classics and new writing by engaging some of the UK's most exciting and emerging writers. To date, this has included Ranjit Bolt (''Three Sisters''), Gareth Jandrell (''Thebes'', published by Bloomsbury Methuen Drama), Emily Juniper (''[[Miss Julie]]'' and ''[[Vassa Zheleznova (play)|Vassa Zheleznova]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jun/13/rewriting-classical-theatre-women-faction-maxim-gorky-vassa-zheleznova|title=Rewriting classical theatre: 'Female characters are sad, have babies or talk about men'|last=Saner|first=Emine|date=2016-06-13|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-06-05|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and two unique projects: ''Reptember'' and ''Demetrius''.  

''Reptember'' is an [[Off West End]] award-nominated project, consisting of 12 classic texts adapted for solo performance by some of our most promising playwrights, including Jessica Sian and Will Gore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newdiorama.com/whats-on/reptember|title=New Diorama|last=http://feastcreative.com|first=Feast Creative|website=newdiorama.com|access-date=2017-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Demetrius'' is an ongoing portmanteau project to complete [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]]'s [[Demetrius (play)|final unfinished work]]. Established writers such as April de Angelis, Glyn Maxwell and Simon Reade complete a "unit" before passing the baton to up and coming writers like Jon Brittain and Daniel Kanaber.

'''''The Green Bird''''' score is composed and orchestrated by [[Elliot Goldenthal]] for the 1999 [[Musical theatre|musical]] of [[The Green Bird|the same name]], directed by long-time Goldenthal collaborator [[Julie Taymor]]; it is an allegorical fairy tale of a royal family's rite of passage after being separated by a wicked grandmother.

The score itself is typical of Goldenthal's style; atonal, sometimes disonant and a balance between theatre, drama and invention. It was, along with the musical itself, well received by critics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soundtrack-express.com/osts/greenbird.htm The Green Bird - Elliot Goldenthal&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moviemusicuk.us/greenbirdcd.htm The Green Bird&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''This Movie Sucks!''''' (sometimes abbreviated as ''TMS!'') is a [[Television in Canada|Canadian]] [[comedy]] [[television series]] hosted by [[Ed the Sock]], premiering on May 28, 2010, two years after ''[[Ed's Night Party]]'' went off the air.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stalbertgazette.com/article/GB/20100513/CP05/305139830/-1/SAG03/ed-the-sock-brings-his-wisecracks-back-to-tv-with-new-indie-show-on&amp;template=cpArt Ed the Sock brings his wisecracks back to TV with new indie show on CHCH] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716125802/http://www.stalbertgazette.com/article/GB/20100513/CP05/305139830/-1/SAG03/ed-the-sock-brings-his-wisecracks-back-to-tv-with-new-indie-show-on%26template%3DcpArt |date=2011-07-16 }} The Canadian Press, May 13, 2010 (Article by Bill Brioux)&lt;/ref&gt; The show is similar to another former Ed the Sock series, ''[[Ed's Nite In]]''. ''This Movie Sucks!'' features his ''Night Party'' co-host, [[Liana Kerzner]] and another [[MuchMusic]] personality, comedian [[Ron Sparks (comedian)|Ron Sparks]]. Currently being produced and broadcast by [[CHCH-TV]] [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], it is also being shown on [[CJNT-TV]] [[Montreal]] and [[CHEK-TV]] [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], as well as [[Movieola]] and [[Silver Screen Classics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sweetposer.tk/urbmn/index.php/2010/05/13/news-ed-the-sock-on-chch/ Ed The Sock Debuts May 28, 2010 On Channel Zero Outlets] URBMN, May 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

A third season of ''This Movie Sucks!'' was reported as being under development. It was to feature six new one-hour episodes, as the cast stated that the original two-hour format was "killing" them. Reruns ceased on [[CHCH-TV]] until that time, although they still played on other channels. New films to be featured in season three would have included ''Raiders of Lost Atlantis'' and ''The Wild Weng'', a film that like the previously featured ''[[The Impossible Kid (film)|The Impossible Kid]]'' starred [[Philippines|Filipino]] actor ''[[Weng Weng]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://popcultureaddict.com/edthesoc/ FU Ottawa!: Catching Up with Ed the Sock] Confessions of a Pop Culture Addict, April 21, 2011 (Article by Sam Tweedle)&lt;/ref&gt; The third season either never went into production or simply never aired and CHCH has since removed the show from its listings.

== Premise ==
In each two-hour episode Ed has guests over to watch (and make fun of) a [[List of films considered the worst|bad movie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chartattack.com/news/82302/thirteen-reasons-to-celebrate-ed-the-socks-return-to-television|title=Ed The Sock Returning To Save Television|work=CHARTattack|date=May 14, 2010|author=Kate Harper|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708140535/http://www.chartattack.com/news/82302/thirteen-reasons-to-celebrate-ed-the-socks-return-to-television|archivedate=July 8, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movies are often edited for time and also to include humorous sound or film effects or to point out significant details. Examples of this include an often used joke of speeding up certain boring sections of a film and playing them with the addition of a music track. Sometimes things other than the main movie are also featured, such as an episode of ''[[DoDo, The Kid from Outer Space]]'' which was shown in between the screening of ''[[The Manster]]''.

When not making fun of the movie, the cast also engage in humorous interludes, including such notables as tellings of the stories of "Roninja" and "Lake Erie Pete" and even a fake [[telethon]] to help alleviate "Cheap Bastard Disorder". Occasionally the cast also wander away from their studio to attend events such as [[Anime North]] or to go to a different studio where Liana gets filmed in a [[giantess]] video. The show is filmed in a deliberately low-budget manner, and much of the work behind it is even done by student volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hamiltonmountainnews.com/news/article/211346 |title=Mohawk students help bring Ed back to TV|work=Hamilton MountainNews|date=May 27, 2010|author=Gord Bowes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarities have been noted between the series and ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'' and also ''[[The All-Night Show]]''.{{Original research inline|date=January 2015}}

== Characters ==
[[File:ThisMovieSucks!-Initial-Hosts.png|200px|thumb|The original hosts of ''This Movie Sucks!'' as seen in the first episode]]

=== Main cast ===
*'''[[Ed the Sock]]''' is a puppet, created and voiced by [[Steven Kerzner]]. Ed has a scowl, a cigar sticking out of his mouth and a rough, gravelly voice. The show is alleged to be set in his apartment or basement, although as Ed himself has noted, everyone knows they are in fact shooting everything in a studio.
*'''[[Liana K]]erzner''' (stage name '''Liana K''') is Ed's co-host, and is actually the wife of [[Steven Kerzner]]. Unlike the other characters, she was never referred to as a guest, likely due to her previous role as co-host on ''[[Ed &amp; Red's Night Party]]''.
*'''[[Ron Sparks (comedian)|Ron Sparks]]''' is a [[comedian]] who has appeared in almost every episode alongside Ed and Liana. He sits behind the couch, usually accompanied by a drink, and is known for making off the wall comments. In one episode in which he was unable to attend, the rest of the cast try to find him an understudy, with ''Max Brand'' eventually earning the coveted title.

=== Recurring characters ===
*'''Andrew Young''' is one of the writers on the show who has been in several episodes. Andrew dressed up in a [[starfish]] [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] costume at [[Anime North]] even though he didn't want to because Ed insisted. Ed has also gotten Andrew to dress up as a two headed [[monster]] and a [[mummy]], with Andrew frequently yelling at Ed that he hates doing that. Andrew is an [[internet radio]] host for ''Geek Hard Radio'' and a [[filmmaker]]. Ed broadcasts one of Andrew's [[short films]] at the end of the third episode after Andrew agrees to dress up in costume, or at least find someone else to do it for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myspace.com/socialretardproductions/blog/535563336 |title=LACTOSE to be featured on this week's Episode of THIS MOVIE SUCKS!|work=Social Retard Productions's Blog|date=June 9, 2010|author=Andrew Young}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another episode he auditions to be Ron's understudy, but he loses to ''Max Brand''.
*'''Larissa Drobot''' is an intern who often helps out with projects in the show. In ''[[The Manster]]'' episode Liana did special effects make-up on Larissa's face. In the ''[[Wild Women of Wongo]]'' episode she shared a story. In the fake telethon episode, she tried to have her birds do some tricks.
*'''Amusing Duck''' is a cheap foreign import [[toy]] which the cast found in a [[Novelty item|novelty shop]]. First introduced in ''[[The Manster]]'' episode, the duck is capable of excreting plastic eggs out of a plastic flap representing the bird's buttocks, with the toy's box stating in broken English "Lay egg is true!". It later appears after the showing of ''[[The Killer Shrews]]'', after it bashes through the wall in parody of several scenes in the movie, although it was quite clearly pushed through by ''Andrew Young''.
*'''Naked Dave''' is a friend of Liana's who likes to take off his shirt for no reason, which Ed hates. He is very proud and protective of his sports car (to the point where he kills Steve the intern after Steve threatens to egg the car). Naked Dave was a guest in the episode ''[[The Master (U.S. TV series)|The Master]]'', but at the end of the episode he is killed by ''Roninja''. He does, however, appear later during the fake telethon to fight "Cheap Bastard Disorder".
*'''Bandito''' appears during the [[Cinema of Mexico|Mexican]] movies double feature special, after Ed invites [[Lucha libre|Mexican wrestler]] ''Bandito'' on the show as a guest because he is the closest guest he has to a real Mexican person. Despite being a [[luchador]], his only piece of costuming is his wrestling mask so Ed makes fun of his [[T-shirt]] and shorts. The first movie features ''[[The Robot vs. The Aztec Mummy]]'', so Liana dresses him up in a [[robot]] costume. Ed later sends him to the most dangerous neighbourhood in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] to pick up some [[Mexican food]]. He is then attacked and possibly killed by ''Lake Erie Pete'' after ''Andrew Young'' is supposed to fight him dressed as the mummy but leaves. He is also later seen in the fake telethon episode, manning the phones.
*'''Max Brand''' was a frequent guest on Ed's old show. He appears in the [[telethon]] episode as a dancer who also works answering phones on the [[Call centre|phone bank]]. In another episode he returns to audition to be Ron's understudy and wins the part, in that episode he introduces himself by saying "I'm Ron Sparks but I'm coloured."

=== Other characters ===
*'''Charlene Zacks''' was a regular on Ed's old show who Ed always puts down. They frequently pass insults back and forth with Ed coming out on top. She was a guest in the premiere Gorilla episode of ''TMS!'' but has not been back since.
*'''Steve''' is another intern who enjoys eating bags of [[potato chips]]. He is killed by Naked Dave the zombie after threatening to egg his car, as instructed by Ed. Steve never talks.
*'''Emily Schooley''' is shown in the fake telethon episode, where she plays a phone operator coerced into helping Ed and Liana out. She sometimes works behind the scenes as well - in the Roninja episode, she did Naked Dave's makeup as well as working as set continuity/PA. In real life she is an actor and improviser.
*'''Roninja''' is featured in the episode featuring ''[[The Master (U.S. TV series)|The Master]]'' (about an [[United States|American]] [[Second World War]] [[veteran]] who was trained by the [[ninja]]). Ron Sparks tells the legend of the ''Roninja'', a half [[Ronin]]/half Ninja who became a [[crime fighter]] after his parents were killed by "the [[Yakuza]] gang". After the story Sparks suddenly disappears making it appear very possible that he is in fact himself the Roninja. Ed keeps saying that the Roninja isn't real, but Liana points out there is a Roninja page on [[Wikipedia]].  It is obviously Sparks playing the Roninja (he has Spark's voice and drink), but it is not shown whether he is actually supposed to be the same person.  At the end of the episode Roninja kills another guest, [[Naked Dave]].
*'''Lake Erie Pete''' is shown in the Mexican movies episode, during the ''Haunted Swamp'' feature. Sparks tells the legend of ''[[Lake Erie|Lake Erie Pete]]'', about a man who becomes a crime-fighting [[swamp monster]] after his parents are killed by one. The story is almost exactly the same as the ''Roninja'' story from the previous episode. After telling it, Sparks again disappears then Lake Erie Pete shows up in a cheap ''[[Creature from the Black Lagoon]]'' mask to ambush the Robot after the failed Robot/Mummy fight.
*'''Crackers''' the clown appears during the fake [[telethon]] episode,  during which he plays a song on his [[accordion]] and also plays back-up music for other performers to dance to.

== Reception ==
''This Movie Sucks!'' initially garnered a lukewarm reception, with it being criticized for having a bad choice in movies to mock and for it seeming generally weaker than previous [[Ed the Sock]] efforts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sweetposer.tk/urbmn/index.php/2010/06/07/tv-review-movie-sucks-2-eps/ TV Review - Ed The Sock’s This Movie Sucks!] URBMN, June 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gilles, Ed.

'''Trivia''' refers to bits of [[information]], often of little importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Urg3hNc4tu0C&amp;pg=PT175|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Phrase and Fable|first=Elizabeth|last=Knowles|date=12 October 2006|publisher=Oxford University Press, UK|accessdate=1 May 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Latin meaning and etymology ==
The ''trivia'' (singular ''[[trivium]]'') are  three lower ''[[Liberal arts education|Artes Liberales]]'', i.e. [[grammar]], [[logic]], and [[rhetoric]]. These were the topics of [[basic education]], foundational to the ''[[Quadrivium|quadrivia]]'' of higher education, and hence the material of basic education and an important building block for all undergraduates. 

The ancient [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] used the word ''triviae'' to describe where one road split or forked into two roads. Triviae was formed from ''tri'' (three) and ''viae'' (roads) – literally meaning "three roads", and in transferred use "a public place" and hence the meaning "commonplace."&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|trivial|accessdate=2015-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pertaining adjective is ''triviālis''. The adjective ''trivial'' was adopted in [[Early Modern English]], while the noun ''trivium'' only appears in learned usage from the 19th century, in reference to the ''Artes Liberales'' and the plural ''trivia'' in the sense of "trivialities, trifles" only in the 20th century.{{cn|date=September 2014}}

The Latin adjective ''triviālis'' in Classical Latin besides its literal meaning could have the meaning "appropriate to the street corner, commonplace, vulgar." In [[late Latin]], it could also simply mean "triple." In [[medieval Latin]], it came to refer to the lower division of the ''[[Liberal arts education|Artes Liberales]]'', namely [[grammar]], [[rhetoric]], and [[logic]]. (The other four Liberal Arts were the ''[[quadrivium]]'', namely [[arithmetic]], [[geometry]], [[music]], and [[astronomy]], which were more challenging.) Hence, ''trivial'' in this sense would have meant "of interest only to an undergraduate."{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}}

==English usage==
The adjective ''trivial'' introduced into  English in the 15th to 16th century was influenced by all three meanings of the Latin adjective:

*A 15th century English translation of [[Ranulf Higden]] mentions the ''arte trivialle'', referring to the ''trivium'' of the Liberal Arts.&lt;ref&gt;trans. Higden (Rolls Series, dating to 1432-50) VI. 333 ''to whom sche redde the arte trivialle'' (translating ''trivium legeret''), cited after [[OED]].&lt;/ref&gt;
*the same work also calls ''a triuialle distinccion'' a threefold division. This is due to an application of the term by [[Arnobius]], and was never common either in Latin or English.&lt;ref&gt;trans. Higden (Rolls Series) VI. 333 '' Giraldus of Wales, which describede Topographie of Irlonde, Itinerary of Wales, and the Lyfe of Kinge Henry the Secunde, under a triuialle distinccion''  (translating ''sub triplici distinctione''), cited after [[OED]].&lt;/ref&gt;
*the meaning "trite, commonplace, unimportant, slight" occurs from the late 16th century, notably in the works of [[Shakespeare]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Henry VI, Part 3]]'' (1593) ''We haue but triuiall argument''.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Trivia'' was used as a title by [[Logan Pearsall Smith]] in 1902,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/8544 |title=Project Gutenberg etext |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date=2005-07-01 |accessdate=2012-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by ''More Trivia'' and ''All Trivia'' in 1921 and 1933, respectively, collections of short "moral pieces" or aphorisms. Book II of the 1902 publication is headed with a quote from "Gay's ''Trivia, or New Art of Walking Streets of London.''",
: "Thou, Trivia, goddess, aid my song: Through spacious streets conduct thy bard along."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gay|first1=John|title=Trivia: Or, The Art of Walking the Streets of London|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Trivia.html?id=rcYIAAAAQAAJ|website=Google Books|publisher=Bernard Linton|location=London|date=1730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern usage===
''Trivialities, bits of information of little consequence'' was the title of a popular book by British [[Aphorism|aphorist]] Logan Pearsall Smith (1865-1946), first published in 1902 but popularized in 1918 (with ''More Trivia'' following in 1921 and a collected edition including both in 1933). It consisted of short essays often tied to observation of small things and commonplace moments. ''Trivia'' is the plural of ''trivium'', "a public place." The adjectival form of this, ''trivialis'', was hence translated by Smith as "commonplace."&lt;ref name=etmyonline&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=trivia Trivia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151226040440/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=trivia |date=2015-12-26 }}, Etmyology Online&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1918 version of his book ''Trivia'', Smith wrote:&lt;ref name=etmyonline/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;I KNOW too much; I have stuffed too many of the facts of History and Science into my intellectuals. My eyes have grown dim over books; believing in geological periods, cave dwellers, Chinese Dynasties, and the fixed stars has prematurely aged me.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the 1960s, nostalgic college students and others began to informally trade questions and answers about the popular culture of their youth. The first known documented labeling of this casual parlor game as "Trivia" was in a ''[[Columbia Daily Spectator]]'' column published on February&amp;nbsp;5, 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Columbia Daily Spectator 5 February 1965|publisher=Columbia University Archives|url=http://spectatorarchive.library.columbia.edu/cgi-bin/columbia?a=d&amp;d=cs19650205-01.1.4&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN------|accessdate=2014-04-18|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140418220653/http://spectatorarchive.library.columbia.edu/cgi-bin/columbia?a=d&amp;d=cs19650205-01.1.4&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN------|archivedate=18 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author, Ed Goodgold ''(né'' Edwin F. Goodgold; born 1944), then started the first organized "trivia contests" with the help of Dan Carlinsky. Ed and Dan  wrote the book ''Trivia'' (Dell, 1966) which achieved a ranking on the [[New York Times best seller list]]; the book was an extension of the pair's Columbia contests and was followed by other Goodgold and Carlinsky trivia titles. In their second book, ''More Trivial Trivia'', the authors criticized practitioners who were "indiscriminate enough to confuse the flower of trivia with the weed of minutiae"; Trivia, they wrote, "is concerned with tugging at heartstrings," while minutiae deals with such unevocative questions as "Which state is the largest consumer of Jell-O?" But over the years the word has come to refer to obscure and arcane bits of dry knowledge as well as nostalgic remembrances of pop culture.{{cn|date=April 2015}} The board game ''[[Trivial Pursuit]]'' was released in 1982 and was a craze in the U.S. for several years thereafter.&lt;ref name=etmyonline/&gt;

==Organized competition==
The largest current trivia contest&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.triviahalloffame.com/wwsp.htm|title=Trivia World|publisher=Triviahalloffame.com|accessdate=2008-12-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516051228/http://www.triviahalloffame.com/wwsp.htm|archivedate=2008-05-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Ken|last=Jennings|url=http://www.ken-jennings.com/excerpt3.html|title=Chapter 13: What is Tradition?|work=Brainiac|accessdate=2008-12-23|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124222833/http://www.ken-jennings.com/excerpt3.html|archivedate=2009-01-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is held in [[Stevens Point, Wisconsin]], at the [[University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point]]'s [[college]] radio station [[WWSP|WWSP 89.9 FM]]. This is a college station with 11,500 watts of power and about a 65-mile (105-kilometre) radius, and the contest serves as a fund raiser for the station. The contest is open to anyone, and it is played in April of each year spanning 54 hours over a weekend with eight questions each hour. There are usually 400 teams ranging from 1 to 150 players. The top ten teams are awarded trophies. The 48th WWSP contest was held on April 21–23, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stevenspointjournal.com/story/news/local/2017/04/24/festivus-repeats-trivia-champions/100839898/?hootPostID=8c173d33746ee579fe3b15d3f220ffbe|title=Festivus repeats as Trivia champions|author=|date=|website=stevenspointjournal.com|accessdate=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two longest continuous trivia contests in the world are the [[Great Midwest Trivia Contest]] at [[Lawrence University]] and the [[Williams College|Williams Trivia Contest]], which both debuted in the spring of 1966. Lawrence hosts its contest annually. Unusually, Williams has a separate contest for each semester, and thus its 84th game took place in May 2008.

The [[University of Colorado system|University of Colorado]] [https://cutriviabowl.com/ Trivia Bowl] was a mostly student contest featuring a single-elimination tournament based on the GE [[College Bowl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cualum.org/heritage/alumni_lng/traditions.html#trivia|title=University of Colorado Heritage Center|publisher=Cualum.org|accessdate=2008-12-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203134300/http://www.cualum.org/heritage/alumni_lng/traditions.html#trivia|archivedate=2007-02-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the best trivia players in America trace participation through this tournament including many ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' and ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (U.S. game show)|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'' contestants.  In recent years, the event been a regional qualifier for T.R.A.S.H. (Testing Recall About Strange Happenings) utilizing a round robin competition format.

Today, many bars and restaurants host weekly trivia nights in an effort to draw in more patrons, especially during weeknights.

==Quiz bowl==
Another quiz competition is the [[quiz bowl]] tournaments found in high schools and universities in the U.S., as well as in elementary, middle, and junior high schools; the Canadian equivalent is competition geared toward [[Reach for the Top]], among high schools, although Canadian universities and a few high schools are beginning to participate in U.S. quiz bowl leagues.  The [[National Academic Quiz Tournaments]] is a national organization, founded in 1996, which supplies questions to high school and college-level tournaments across North America.

'''[[Paul Oakenfold]] produced Urban Soundtracks''' for pieces of classic and contemporary [[literature]] from late 1999 to 2002. They were aired by [[Galaxy FM]] in the UK. They were also aired on BBC Radio One at the same time.

There were a total of 35 soundtrack [[audiobook]]s produced and aired over the Galaxy network during 1999-2002. Each two-hour programme went out on Sunday evenings at 7:00 pm. These tracks blend classic literature with a mixture of dance and contemporary music. The narratives were read by famous voices such as [[Ewan McGregor]], [[Kylie Minogue]], [[Richard Blackwood]], [[Sean Pertwee]], Max Bleasly, [[Tom Baker]], Neneh Cherry, [[Christopher Lee]], [[Brian Blessed]], [[Neil Tennant]] and [[Honor Blackman]].

The series, won a Bronze Award in the 2002 [[Sony Radio Academy Awards]] Specialist Music category, and was endorsed by the [[National Literacy Trust]]. The series also included [[Pinocchio]] read by [[Ronan Keating]], [[The Little Mermaid]] by [[All Saints (group)|All Saints]]' singer [[Nicole Appleton]] and [[Kylie Minogue]] read [[Alice in Wonderland]]. Broadcast on the radio stations Galaxy and Kiss 100, they proved to be hugely popular with the core 15 to 34-year-old audience.

Although highly successful and well received, the series have never been released and are not officially commercially available.

However, some copies recorded at time of broadcast seem to be in circulation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2309">The '''Utopia Group SA''' was a Luxembourgish [[movie theater|cinema]] chain which owned and operated cinemas located in [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Luxembourg]], and the [[Netherlands]]. In 2015, its French, Luxembourg and Dutch operations were acquired by the [[Kinepolis|Kinepolis Group]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.euroinvestor.com/news/2015/11/09/kinepolis-group-takes-over-utopolis-activities-in-luxembourg-the-netherlands-and-france/13253763|title=Kinepolis Group takes over Utopolis' activities in Luxembourg, the Netherlands and France|work=EuroInvestor|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The Utopia Group's Belgian operations were bought by the French ''[[UGC (cinema operator)|Union Générale Cinématographique]]'' (UGC), following a ruling against Kinepolis' bid by the Belgian competition authority&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.filmjournal.com/columns/kinepolis-acquires-utopolis-circuit|title=Kinepolis acquires Utopolis circuit {{!}} Film Journal International|website=www.filmjournal.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;''.''

Originally formed in 2002 as a result of a merger between Luxembourg's Utopia SA and the Dutch Polyfilm BV, the company operated 19 cinemas, predominantly in the [[Benelux]] region, under the brand name of "Utopolis", with its flagship cinema, Utopolis Kirchberg (now [[Kinepolis Kirchberg]]), based in Luxembourg City.

Whilst most of the Utopia Group's cinemas have been renamed following the changes in ownership, a tribute remains in the form of the "Utopia" cinema in the [[Limpertsberg]] district of Luxembourg City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Utopolis Belval and Kirchberg cinemas in Luxembourg to become Kinepolis {{!}} Kinepolis Group|url=https://corporate.kinepolis.com/en/press-releases/utopolis-belval-and-kirchberg-cinemas-luxembourg-become-kinepolis|website=corporate.kinepolis.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''''Wolf's Rain'''''|ウルフズレイン|Urufuzu Rein|lead=yes}} is an [[anime]] series created by writer [[Keiko Nobumoto]] and produced by [[Bones (studio)|Bones]]. It was directed by [[Tensai Okamura]] and featured character designs by [[Toshihiro Kawamoto]] with a soundtrack produced and arranged by [[Yoko Kanno]]. It focuses on the journey of four lone wolves who cross paths while following the scent of the Lunar Flower and seeking Paradise.

''Wolf's Rain'' spans twenty-six television episodes and four [[original video animation]] (OVA) episodes, with each episode running approximately twenty-five minutes. The series was originally broadcast in Japan on [[Fuji TV]] and the anime [[communications satellite|CS]] television network, [[Animax]]. The complete thirty episode series is licensed for North American release by [[Funimation]], in Europe by [[Beez Entertainment]] and in Australia and New Zealand by [[Madman Entertainment]]. The series was adapted into a short two-[[tankōbon|volume]] [[manga]] series written by Keiko Nobumoto and illustrated by Toshitsugu Iida. The manga, which was released while the series was airing, is a retelling of the story rather than a straight adaptation. It was originally serialized in ''[[Magazine Z]]'' and has been released in North America by [[Viz Media]].

The anime series was well received in Japan, being the third-ranked anime series in its timeslot while airing on Fuji TV. The Bandai Entertainment English-language release sold well in North America. It helped Bandai gain the 2004 Anime Company of the Year award from industry news company ICv2 in the ICv2 Retailers Guide to Anime/Manga. The manga adaptation was selected as one of their top ten anime products of 2005 and sold well in North America. Reviewers of the series gave it high marks for characterization, visual presentation, narrative and its soundtrack, while disparaging the existence of four recapitulation episodes in the middle of the series. The manga adaptation also sold well in North America and received good reviews, though reviewers felt its short length resulted in a rushed plot and neglected supporting characters.

==Plot==
According to an old legend, when the end of the world comes, a place known as Paradise will appear. However, only wolves will know how to find it. Although wolves are believed to have been hunted to extinction nearly two hundred years ago, they still exist, surviving by casting illusions over themselves to make them appear human.&lt;ref name="Ep1"&gt;{{cite episode |title=City of Howls |series=Wolf's Rain |episodelink=List of Wolf's Rain episodes |number=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Freeze City is a northern human city in a world where the majority of people live in poverty and hardship.

[[List of Wolf's Rain characters#Kiba|Kiba]], an injured lone white wolf, goes to Freeze City following the scent of the Lunar Flower, which is the key to opening Paradise. There he encounters [[List of Wolf's Rain characters#Tsume|Tsume]], [[List of Wolf's Rain characters#Hige|Hige]] and [[List of Wolf's Rain characters#Toboe|Toboe]], three other wolves who were drawn to Freeze City by the scent of the Lunar Flower and are now living in the city. The wolves encounter [[List of Wolf's Rain characters#Quent Yaiden|Quent Yaiden]], a former Sheriff of Kyrios who is obsessed with hunting down wolves, and his dog [[List of Wolf's Rain characters#Blue|Blue]]. [[List of Wolf's Rain characters#Cheza|Cheza]], the Flower Maiden who is destined to lead the wolves to Paradise, is being studied at a laboratory under the care of [[List of Wolf's Rain characters#Cher Degré|Cher Degré]]. She is awakened by the smell of wolf's blood. As Kiba and Hige approach the lab to find her, she is stolen away by [[List of Wolf's Rain characters#Darcia|Lord Darcia the Third]], whose people created Cheza.

With the Flower Maiden gone, the wolves have no reason to stay in the city. Despite some initial misgivings and suspicions, they decide to stay together and follow Kiba in his search for the Flower Maiden and Paradise. As they pursue Cheza, the wolves travel through various cities and the remnants of former habitations. Cher joins the city's army to try to recover Cheza, while Cher's ex-husband [[List of Wolf's Rain characters#Hubb Lebowski|Hubb Lebowski]] searches desperately for Cher, and Quent continues his relentless pursuit of the wolves. When Blue eventually encounters Cheza, it awakens her wolf blood from dormancy and causes her to leave Quent and take on her own human form. She joins the wolves and travels with them for a while, developing an intense and close [[romantic relationship]] with Hige, and meanwhile Hubb finds himself traveling with Quent, who is now searching for Blue as well as the wolves. Hubb eventually finds Cher and from there they continue their pursuit of the wolves to find Cheza.

Together the wolves reach Darcia's keep after Kiba goes off on his own. Hubb, Cher and Quent arrive in the keep, and Tsume, Toboe, and Hige find Kiba, Cheza and Darcia during a sword fight between Darcia and Kiba. The reunion is short-lived however because Jaguara's troops attack, destroying the keep in the process. The Noble's troops capture Cheza, Hubb, Cher and Blue during the raid, and the wolves get separated from Kiba. After finding Kiba, the wolves continue their journey to rescue Cheza from Jaguara, while Cher rescues Blue and manages to find Cheza with help from Hubb, but Jaguara's troops instantly recapture Cheza, taking Hubb with them and forcing Cher and Blue to find Cheza on their own.

The wolves and the humans eventually come together in Jaguara's city, where the captured Cheza is being held. In attempting to rescue the abducted Cheza, Kiba, Tsume and Toboe are captured. Tsume and Toboe are thrown into a dungeon with Hubb while [[List of Wolf's Rain characters#Jaguara|Jaguara]] attempts to use Kiba's blood to force Paradise to open. Meanwhile, Hige and Blue are reunited outside the Keep, where Hige remembers that he had once worked for Jaguara and decides to go rescue his friends, but not before telling Blue to stay outside and promising her that he will return to her no matter what. While waiting for Hige, Blue is reunited with her master Quent and meanwhile Darcia, having survived the attack on his keep, interrupts Jaguara's ceremony as Kiba and the other wolves break free and rush to free the Flower Maiden. Hige is wounded during the fight against Jaguara and Kiba arrives after Darcia is poisoned by the Noble. Darcia battles Jaguara along with Kiba and finally slays her as the keep begins to collapse, ending the anime's original 26-episode run.

As the [[original video animation]] (OVA) episodes begin, the wolves and the humans escape Jaguara's city, which has fallen into chaos. Quent is gravely wounded saving Blue from an oncoming vehicle, but he and Blue are found by Hubb and Cher, and subsequently by the wolves and Cheza. Together, they all continue making their way to Paradise, pursued by the now insane Darcia. As the Earth begins to fall into destruction, Cher dies when the car falls off a cliff. And soon after, Toboe is accidentally shot by Quent when he tries to shoot Darcia who in turn kills Quent. Hubb tries to keep up with the remaining wolves climbing up a mountain, but falls to his death. Darcia attacks the remaining wolves killing Hige, Blue, and Tsume, leaving only Kiba, Cheza and Darcia alive at the place where Paradise can be opened. Darcia and Kiba battle over who will open Paradise, in which Kiba is fatally wounded.  Darcia dies when he attempts to enter Paradise due to not being a true wolf. Kiba finds Cheza as she dies and disintegrates into seeds. Dying, Kiba concludes that his quest has failed, but rain begins to fall and Cheza's seeds grow into thousands of lunar flowers. As he dies, Kiba falls into the water's depths but sees the blood red moon turning back to its normal color. Cheza's death causes Paradise, as well as the world, to be reborn. However, Darcia's corruption can be seen taking root in this new Paradise.

===Changes in manga adaptation===
The two-volume manga adaptation includes some of the core events of the anime series with few changes, but as a whole the manga veers greatly from its anime inspiration. Many events from the anime do not occur in the manga, and some of the events from the anime that are presented in the manga are completely different in terms of dialogue, chronological sequence, and final outcomes.&lt;ref name="Manga1" /&gt; In particular, the second volume tells an almost completely different story, with Darcia recruiting Blue to help him open the door to Paradise with her blood. The wolves must go to Darcia's keep, rather than Jaguara's, in order to free Cheza, with Kiba missing but appearing at the end to make the final rescue effort. At the end of the manga, the four wolves and Cheza are sitting on a rock as the clouds break and sunlight streams through for the first time. The world rejoices the end of the [[Ice Age]] and rumors that Paradise has been found abound.&lt;ref name="Manga2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wolf's Rain, Volume 2 |last=Nobumoto |first=Keiko |authorlink=Keiko Nobumoto |date=February 1, 2005 |publisher=Viz Media| series=Wolf's Rain |isbn=1-59116-718-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the manga most of the characters are similar in appearance and personality to their anime counterparts, but some characters seen in the anime do not appear in the manga, including the Noble Lord Orkham.&lt;ref name="Manga1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Manga2" /&gt;

==Characters==
{{Main|List of Wolf's Rain characters}}

*{{Nihongo|'''[[List of Wolf's Rain characters#Kiba|Kiba]]'''|キバ|lit. "Fang"}} is an [[Arctic wolf]] who is dedicated solely to finding the Lunar Flower and opening the way to Paradise. He will protect Cheza with his life. Kiba primarily acts on his instincts, which sometimes lead him to behave rashly, and the others to call him idealistic. Full of wolf pride, Kiba initially expresses disgust at wolves who use human disguises, but eventually realizes that it is necessary to survive. {{Voiced by|[[Mamoru Miyano]]|[[Johnny Yong Bosch]]}}
*{{Nihongo|'''[[List of Wolf's Rain characters#Tsume|Tsume]]'''|ツメ|lit. "Claw"}} is a [[grey wolf]] with a large X shaped scar across his chest, not counting many others. Rough and self-reliant, Tsume is a strong fighter who keeps his true feelings to himself. He joins the others after his human gang in Freeze City betrays him. He does not initially believe in Paradise, but eventually starts to believe in their goal. Though he frequently quarrels with Kiba over their journey, he eventually accepts his leadership and comes to trust in him, also growing protective of Toboe and eventually forming a brotherly relationship with him. {{Voiced by|[[Kenta Miyake]]|[[Crispin Freeman]]}}
*{{Nihongo|'''[[List of Wolf's Rain characters#Hige|Hige]]'''|ヒゲ|lit. "Whiskers"}} is a [[Mexican wolf]] with a carefree attitude, who seems quite comfortable living in human society. Hige likes to converse with girls and to eat, he is quite chubby. After meeting Kiba, he goes along with the idea of searching for Paradise without much argument. Hige wears a collar around his neck, that seems to attract soldiers of a Noble, Lady Jaguara, leading him to put his wolf crew in danger and himself in pain. {{Voiced by|[[Akio Suyama]]|[[Joshua Seth]]}}
*{{Nihongo|'''[[List of Wolf's Rain characters#Toboe|Toboe]]'''|トオボエ|Tōboe|lit. "Howling"}} is a [[red wolf]] and the youngest of the group. He is considered the pup or the [[runt]] by the others, but after he desperately fights a huge walrus during the journey to rescue Cheza from Jaguara, the other wolves change their mind about him. He was raised by an old woman who found him outside the city, and still wears the bracelets she gave him. Due to his upbringing, Toboe is friendly and protective towards most humans. He forms a brotherly relationship with Tsume. {{Voiced by|[[Hiroki Shimowada]]|[[Mona Marshall]]}}
*{{Nihongo|'''[[List of Wolf's Rain characters#Cheza|Cheza]]'''|チェザ|Cheza|}} is also called the "Flower Maiden". The wolves need Cheza to find and open the gateway to Paradise. She was created via [[alchemy]] from a Lunar Flower, and as such needs water and sunlight to survive. Originally asleep and under study in a lab in Freeze City, Cheza is eventually able to join the wolves, whom she loves, and travels with them. She refers to herself in the third person, usually adapted to "this one". The spilling of wolf blood makes Cheza scream, and she has the ability to heal them or put them to sleep through her song and touch. {{Voiced by|[[Arisa Ogasawara]]|[[Sherry Lynn]]}}
*{{Nihongo|'''[[List of Wolf's Rain characters#Blue|Blue]]'''|ブルー|Burū|}} is a blue [[wolfdog]]. At first, she travels along with Quent Yaiden, hunting wolves. But Blue finds out that she is actually half-wolf, and unwilling to hunt her own kind, Blue leaves Quent to join the wolves, eventually falling in love with Hige. She is strong, fearless and independent. {{Voiced by|[[Mayumi Asano]]|[[Jessica Straus (voice actress)|Jessica Straus]]}}

===Anime===
{{Main|List of Wolf's Rain episodes}}

The ''Wolf's Rain'' anime series was produced by [[BONES (studio)|BONES]] and directed by [[Tensai Okamura]].  [[Keiko Nobumoto]] was the writer and [[story editor]], while [[Toshihiro Kawamoto]] created the character designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.b-ch.com/cgi-bin/contents/ttl/det.cgi?ttl_c=154 |title=Wolf's Rain |publisher=[[Bandai Visual|Bandai Channel]] |accessdate=May 7, 2008 |language=Japanese |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080501194102/http://www.b-ch.com/cgi-bin/contents/ttl/det.cgi?ttl_c=154 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = May 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series premiered in Japan on [[Fuji TV]] on January 6, 2003 and ran for a full season of twenty-six episodes, with the final episode airing on July 29, 2003. A four episode [[original video animation]] (OVA) was later created and released to DVD to provide a fuller conclusion to the story than the original television run did, and to make up for the four [[wikt:recapitulate|recapitulation]] episodes that originally broadcast in the middle of the series.

Each chapter of the manga series is called a "grope", which is a reference to a Japanese phrase for arriving somewhere after enduring hardships.&lt;ref name="Manga1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wolf's Rain, Volume 1 |last=Nobumoto |first=Keiko |authorlink=Keiko Nobumoto |date=November 3, 2004 |publisher=Viz Media| series=Wolf's Rain |isbn=1-59116-591-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There he meets Tsume, Hige, and Toboe, three other wolves using illusions to appear humans so they can live in relative safety in the city. All four soon find themselves the target of Quent Yaiden and his dog Blue, who seek to kill every remaining wolf in the world. Cheza, the Lunar Flower, awakens at Kiba's arrival, but she is stolen away by Darcia. The four wolves join together and leave the town. After a rough trip through a town that violently rejects all outsiders, the wolves are able to meet with Cheza, who sensed their presence below and jumped from Darcia's airship to float down to them.

Her song also affects Blue, who realizes for the first time that she has wolf blood in her. Darcia recaptures Cheza, badly wounding the four wolves in the process. Darcia aims to open Paradise using Cheza and the blood of Blue, whom he found in the woods and recruited for the project. After a fight with Darcia that leaves Kiba completely blind, the wolves are able to free Cheza and escape Darcia's keep just before it collapses. At the end, as the wolves and Cheza sit on a rock, the sun breaks through the clouds for the first time and the Ice Age ends, leading people to believe that Paradise has open.

==Reception==
In Japan, ''Wolf's Rain'' ranked third among anime series airing in the same time slot behind ''[[Air Master]]'' and ''[[Dear Boys]]''.&lt;ref name="ANN_AskJohn"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.animenation.net/news/askjohn.php?id=756|title=Ask John: Why Was Wolf's Rain So Bad?|first=John|last=Oppliger|authorlink=John Oppliger|accessdate= 2008-01-03|date=September 24, 2003|publisher=[[AnimeNation]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060116114725/http://www.animenation.net/news/askjohn.php?id=756|archivedate= January 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was considered "a big hit in 2004" for the North American market,&lt;ref name="ICv2_Announce" /&gt; selling well in mass markets as well as in online markets and at independent retailers. ICv2 notes that it has "a strong appeal to the growing teen and older anime audience."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/6266.html | title=ICv2 2004 Anime Awards, Part 1 | accessdate=2007-12-29|date=January 13, 2005| publisher=ICv2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was selected as one of the top ten anime properties of 2005 for the ICv2 Retailers Guide to Anime/Manga.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/6340.html | title=Manga Market Continues Robust Growth in '04 | accessdate=2007-12-29|date=January 26, 2005 | publisher=ICv2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its release was also a central reason Bandai Entertainment earned the ICv2 Anime Company of the Year award for 2004.&lt;ref name="ICv2_Announce"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/7318.html | title=Bandai Announces Complete Collections | accessdate=December 29, 2007 |date=August 4, 2004 | publisher=ICv2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tasha Robinson of ''[[SciFi Weekly]]'' praised the series for its unusual focus on non-human characters and the interesting dynamic of wolves behaving like wolves as they interact with the human characters and environments in the series.&lt;ref name="SciFiReview"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue377/anime.html | title=Anime Reviews: Wolf's Rain | first=Tasha |last=Robinson |work=SciFi Weekly | accessdate=December 29, 2007 |date=July 12, 2004 |volume=10 | issue=377 | publisher=[[Syfy|Sci Fi channel]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071218211929/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue377/anime.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = December 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ANNSeriesReview" /&gt; Carlo Santos of [[Anime News Network]] praised the visuals of the series, noting that they "showcase Studio BONES at their most imaginative, with beautiful backgrounds that depict settings from high-tech mysticism to urban decay to open wilderness. The character designs are equally striking: in their human form, the wolves wear contemporary outfits, making them the most accessible of all characters."&lt;ref name="ANNSeriesReview"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/wolf's-rain/dvd-1-7 | title=Wolf's Rain DVD 1–7 – Review | accessdate=December 29, 2007 |date=March 6, 2006 | author=Carlo Santos | publisher=Anime News Network }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Santos and Chris Beveridge of Mania.com noted that the [[DVD region code#Region codes and countries|Region 1]] DVD volume containing the four recapitulation episodes should be left unbought and skipped as a waste of money; however, they praised Bandai's release of the episodes for putting the episodes on a single volume, unlike in the Japanese release where they were spread over two DVDs requiring them to be bought to get the new episodes on the same volumes.&lt;ref name="ANNSeriesReview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AoDSeriesReview"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.animeondvd.com/reviews2/disc_reviews/3823.php | title=Wolf's Rain Vol. #7 (of 7) | accessdate=December 29, 2007 |date=April 13, 2004 | author=Chris Beveridge | publisher=AnimeOnDVD.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.animeondvd.com/reviews2/disc_reviews/3481.php | title=Wolf's Rain Vol. #4 (of 7) | accessdate=December 29, 2007 |date=December 13, 2004 | author=Chris Beveridge | publisher=AnimeOnDVD.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics have complained that while the show had an original and innovative storyline with beautiful visuals and appealing characters, the episodes themselves were poorly paced, undeveloped, and plagued with plot holes.&lt;ref name="ANN_AskJohn" /&gt;

In ''[[The Anime Encyclopedia]]'', Jonathan Clements and [[Helen McCarthy]] criticized the production delays and the hiatuses that led to the creation of the four recap episodes, stating that "if the makers had spent less time recounting the story so far, they might have had more than enough space to finish the entire run within the requisite 26 episodes". They praised the series' soundtrack, feeling it supported "the atmosphere and character development", and felt the "moody, dark, and understated" art was attractive.&lt;ref name="AnimeEncyc"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Clements |first=Jonathan |authorlink=Jonathan Clements |author2=[[Helen McCarthy]] |title=The Anime Encyclopedia: A Guide to Japanese Animation Since 1917, Revised and Expanded Edition |date=November 1, 2006 |publisher=Stone Bridge Press |location=Berkeley, California |isbn=1-933330-10-4 |oclc=71237342 |pages=728–729 |edition=2nd }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yoko Kanno's soundtrack for the series has also been hailed for its beauty and the way it adds to the series' emotional impact.&lt;ref name="ANNReview"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/wolf's-rain | title=Wolf's Rain&amp;nbsp;– Review | accessdate=December 29, 2007 |date=March 12, 2004 | publisher=Anime News Network }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ANNSeriesReview" /&gt; The instrumental tracks were found to mirror the show's tone perfectly, evoking feelings of sorrow and loss.  According to one reviewer, the soundtrack "...shows [Kanno's] skills as both composer and pianist..." and is "...a treat to hear."&lt;ref name="AFMusicReview" /&gt; Kanno's work in the series was nominated for an [[Annie Award]] in the "Music in an Animated Television Production" category in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://annieawards.com/32ndannieawardwinners.htm | title=32nd Annual Annie Award Nominees and Winners | date=July 28, 2006 | publisher=AnnieAwards.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Wolf's Rain'' manga adaptation has also enjoyed success in the North American market, with the second volume being the ninth best-selling graphic novel on the [[Nielsen BookScan]] list for February 13, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/6457.html | title=D.N.Angel Tops BookScan List | accessdate=December 29, 2007 |date=February 18, 2005 | publisher=ICv2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was considered a "major manga hit" among manga series adapted from an anime series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/8360.html | title='Onegai Twins' Manga From DrMaster | accessdate=December 29, 2007 |date=March 14, 2006 | publisher=ICv2 |quote=Both the Please Teacher and the Onegai Twins manga were adapted from popular anime series, a reversal of the usual pattern in Japan where a popular manga typically inspires an anime adaptation, but this anime-to-manga method has produced some major manga hits in the U.S. such as the ''Cowboy Bebop'', ''Wolf's Rain'', and ''Samurai Champloo'' manga series, all of which were based on anime.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anime News Network]]'s Liann Cooper praised its artwork, but also felt its short length and rushed story line made it hard to connect to the characters. He also felt the supporting characters, Cher, Hubb and Quent, were only included "just to have them included".&lt;ref name="AnnMangaReview"&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/right-turn-only/2004-11-08 | title=Right Turn Only | accessdate=December 30, 2007 |date=November 8, 2004 |first=Liann |last=Cooper | publisher=Anime News Network }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlo Santos, also of [[Anime News Network]], praised the "snappy pacing" while also considering it the primary downfall of the series.&lt;ref name="AnnMangaReview GN1"&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/wolf's-rain-gn-1 | title=Wolf's Rain GN 1 Review | accessdate=March 28, 2008 |date=November 18, 2004 |first=Carlo |last=Santos | publisher=Anime News Network }}&lt;/ref&gt; In reviewing the series for ''[[Manga: The Complete Guide]]'', Rebecca Brown felt the series was a "transparent grab for cash" and criticized its extreme brievity and the art, which she felt was "barely adequate and at times not even that."&lt;ref name="MangaGuide"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Thompson |first=Jason |authorlink=Jason Thompson (writer) |title=[[Manga: The Complete Guide]] |date=October 9, 2007 |publisher=[[Del Rey Books|Del Rey]] |location=New York City |isbn=978-0-345-48590-8 |oclc=85833345 |page= }}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/15/arts/music/15reitz.html "Rosetta Reitz, Champion of Jazz Women, Dies at 84"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 14 November 2008.

'''Women in musicology''' describes the role of [[Women in music|women professors, scholars and researchers]] in [[postsecondary education]] [[musicology]] departments at [[postsecondary education]] institutions, including [[university|universities]], [[college]]s and [[Music conservatory|music conservatories]]. Traditionally, the vast majority of major [[musicology|musicologists]] and music historians have been men. Nevertheless, some women musicologists have reached the top ranks of the profession. [[Carolyn Abbate]] (born 1956) is an American musicologist who did her PhD at [[Princeton University]]. She  has been described by the ''[[Harvard Gazette]]'' as "one of the world's most accomplished and admired music historians".&lt;ref name=HG&gt;[http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2013/11/abbate-named-university-professor/ "Abbate named University Professor"], ''Harvard Gazette'', 20 November 2013. Accessed 10 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Susan McClary]] (born 1946) is a musicologist associated with the "[[New Musicology]]" who incorporates [[feminism|feminist]] music criticism in her work. McClary holds a PhD from [[Harvard University]]. One of her best known works is ''Feminine Endings'' (1991), which covers musical constructions of gender and sexuality, gendered aspects of traditional music theory, gendered sexuality in musical narrative, music as a gendered discourse and issues affecting women musicians. In the book, McClary suggests that the [[sonata form]] (used in symphonies and string quartets) may be a [[sexist]] or [[misogynist]]ic procedure that constructs of [[gender]] and sexual identity. McClary's ''Conventional Wisdom'' (2000) argues that the traditional musicological assumption of the existence of "purely musical" elements, divorced from culture and meaning, the social and the body, is a conceit used to veil the social and political imperatives of the worldview that produces the [[classical canon]] most prized by supposedly objective musicologists.

American musicologist [[Marcia Citron]] has asked "[w]hy is music composed by women so marginal to the standard 'classical' repertoire?"&lt;ref name="Citron, Marcia J 1993"&gt;Citron, Marcia J. Gender and the Musical Canon. CUP Archive, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Citron "examines the practices and attitudes that have led to the exclusion of women composers from the received '[[Western canon|canon]]' of performed musical works." She argues that in the 1800s, women composers typically wrote [[art song]]s for performance in small recitals rather than [[symphony|symphonies]] intended for performance with an orchestra in a large hall, with the latter works being seen as the most important genre for composers; since women composers did not write many symphonies, they were deemed to be not notable as composers.&lt;ref name="Citron, Marcia J 1993"/&gt;

==Ethnomusicologists==
[[File:Frances Densmore.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Frances Densmore]] (1867&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; 1957) was an [[United States|American]] [[anthropology|anthropologist]] and [[ethnography|ethnographer]]  known for her studies of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[music]] and [[culture]].]]

[[Ethnomusicology|Ethnomusicologists]] study the many musics around the world that emphasize their cultural, social, material, cognitive, biological, and other dimensions or contexts instead of or in addition to its isolated sound component or any particular repertoire.
Ethnomusicology –&amp;nbsp;a term coined by [[Jaap Kunst]] from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ἔθνος (''ethnos'', "nation") and μουσική (''mousike'', "music")&amp;nbsp;– is often described as the [[anthropology]] or [[ethnography]] of music. Initially, ethnomusicology was almost exclusively oriented toward non-[[Western world|Western]] music, but now includes the study of Western music from anthropological, sociological and intercultural perspectives.

Notable ethnomusicologists include:

*[[Judith Becker]]
*[[Frances Densmore]]
*[[Ida Halpern]]
