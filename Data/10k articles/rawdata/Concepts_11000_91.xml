In [[programming languages]], an '''abstract type''' is a type in a [[nominative type system]] that cannot be [[Instance (computer science)|instantiated]] directly; a type that is not abstract – which ''can'' be instantiated – is called a ''concrete type''. Every instance of an abstract type is an instance of some concrete [[subtype]]. Abstract types are also known as ''existential types''.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, John C.; Plotkin, Gordon D.; [http://theory.stanford.edu/~jcm/papers/mitch-plotkin-88.pdf ''Abstract Types Have Existential Type''], ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems, Vol. 10, No. 3, July 1988, pp. 470–502&lt;/ref&gt;

An abstract type may provide no implementation, or an incomplete implementation. In some languages, abstract types with no implementation (rather than an incomplete implementation) are known as ''[[Protocol (object-oriented programming)|protocols]]'', ''interfaces'', ''signatures'', or ''class types''. In [[Class-based programming|class-based]] [[object-oriented programming]], abstract types are implemented as ''abstract classes'' (also known as ''[[abstract base class]]es''), and concrete types as ''[[concrete class]]es''. In [[generic programming]], the analogous notion is a [[Concept (generic programming)|concept]], which similarly specifies syntax and semantics, but does not require a subtype relationship: two unrelated types may satisfy the same concept.

Often, abstract types will have one or more implementations provided separately, for example, in the form of concrete subtypes that ''can'' be instantiated. In object-oriented programming, an abstract class may include ''abstract methods'' or ''abstract properties''&lt;ref&gt;http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/abstract.html&lt;/ref&gt; that are shared by its subclasses. Other names for language features that are (or may be) used to implement abstract types include ''[[Trait (computer science)|traits]]'', ''[[mixin]]s'', ''flavors'', ''roles'', or ''type classes''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

== Signifying abstract types ==

Abstract classes can be created, signified, or simulated in several ways:
* By use of the explicit [[keyword (computer programming)|keyword]] &lt;tt&gt;abstract&lt;/tt&gt; in the class definition, as in [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[D (programming language)|D]] or [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]].
* By including, in the class definition, one or more [[abstract method]]s (called ''pure [[virtual functions]]'' in [[C++]]), which the class is declared to accept as part of its protocol, but for which no implementation is provided.
* By [[inheritance (computer science)|inheriting]] from an abstract type, and not overriding all missing features necessary to complete the class definition.
* In many dynamically typed languages such as [[Smalltalk]], any class that sends a particular method to [[this (computer science)|this]], but doesn't implement that method, can be considered abstract.  (However, in many such languages, like [[Objective-C]], the error is not detected until the class is used, and the message returns results in an exception error message such as "Does not recognize selector: xxx" as &lt;code&gt;- [NSObject doesNotRecognizeSelector:(SEL)selector]&lt;/code&gt; is invoked upon detection of an unimplemented method).

=== Example (Java) ===

&lt;source lang="java"&gt;

//By default, all methods in all classes are concrete, unless the abstract keyword is used.
abstract class Demo {
    // An abstract class may include abstract methods, which have no implementation.
    abstract public int sum(int x, int y);

    // An abstract class may also include concrete methods.
    public int product(int x, int y) { return x*y; }
}

//By default, all methods in all interfaces are abstract, unless the default keyword is used.
interface DemoInterface {
    [abstract] int getLength(); //Abstract can be used here, though is completely useless
    
    //The default keyword can be used in this context to specify a concrete method in an interface
    default int product(int x, int y) {
        return x * y;
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== Use of abstract types ==

Abstract types are an important feature in [[static typing|statically typed]] OOP languages. Many [[dynamic typing|dynamically typed]] languages have no equivalent feature (although the use of [[duck typing]] makes abstract types unnecessary); however ''[[Trait (computer programming)|traits]]'' are found in some modern dynamically-typed languages.

Some authors argue that classes should be [[Leaf class (programming language)|leaf class]]es (have no subtypes), or else be abstract.&lt;ref name="riel1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Riel|first=Arthur|title=Object-Oriented Design Heuristics|publisher=Addison-Wesley Professional|year=1996|isbn=0-201-63385-X|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="meyers1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Meyers|first=Scott|title=More Effective C++|publisher=Addison-Wesley Professional|year=1996|isbn=0-201-63371-X |page=258
|quote=Make non-leaf classes abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abstract types are useful in that they can be used to define and enforce a ''[[Protocol (object-oriented programming)|protocol]]''; a set of operations that all objects implementing the protocol must support.

'''Artificial creation''' is a field of research that studies the primary synthesis of complex lifelike structures from primordial lifeless origins.  

The field bears some similarity to [[artificial life]], but unlike artificial life, artificial creation focuses on the primary emergence of complex structures and processes of abiogenesis.  Artificial creation does not rely exclusively on the application of [[evolutionary computation]] and [[genetic algorithms]] to optimize artificial creatures or grow synthetic life forms.  Artificial creation instead studies systems of rules of interaction, initial conditions and  primordial building blocks that can generate complex lifelike structures, based exclusively on repeated application of rules of interaction.
   
An essential difference that distinguishes artificial creation from other related fields is that no explicit [[fitness function]] is used to select for fit structures. Structures exist based only on their ability to persist as entities that do not violate the system's rules of interaction. Artificial creation studies the way in which complex [[emergent properties]] can arise to form a [[self-organizing system]].

==Origins==

Although concepts and elements of artificial creation are represented to some degree in many areas, the field itself is less than a decade old. There are models of self-organizing systems that produce emergent properties in [[biology]], [[computer science]], [[mathematics]], [[engineering]] and other fields. Artificial creation differs from these in that it focuses on underlying properties of systems that can generate the endless environmentally interactive complexity of living systems.  

One of the primary impetuses for the exploration of artificial creation comes from the realization in the [[artificial life]] and [[evolutionary computing]] fields that some basic assumptions common in these fields represent subtle mischaracterizations of natural [[evolution]].  These fall into two general classes: 1) there are fundamental problems with the use of [[fitness functions]] for the primary synthesis of complex systems, and 2)  the process of [[self-replication]] used in almost all artificial life research is not a fundamental property of [[self-organizing systems]].

==Issues==

The concept of a [[fitness function]] (or [[objective function]]) is central to [[artificial life]] systems. The [[fitness function]] is used to drive a given [[artificial evolution]] process to create [[synthetic organisms]] capable of performing a given task.  However, [[fitness functions]], even aggregate high-level ones, drive evolving systems to particular solutions and place a ceiling on innovation and complexity.  Natural [[evolution]] does not drive organisms toward particular solutions to problems.  There is no motive force for [[evolution]] in our universe beyond that of adherence to physical law.  This is a subtle point: when modern organisms are viewed in a local context it does appear that they are evolving to optimize particular abilities that will help them survive.  This is not the case in a global sense.  In fact, the pressure to optimize a given ability comes from the current state of a given population.  The only fundamental selective pressure is the ability of structures to adhere to physical law.  [[Stochastic]] events initiated the appearance of features that we might view as adaptive traits, and it is the local evolution of these traits that much of evolutionary theory is based upon.  

The universe maintains its own consistency.  However, when trying to model the universe, or create [[artificial organisms]] by mimicking natural evolution, the application of [[fitness functions]] that select for particular abilities force an unnatural bias onto the evolving organisms. 

In [[evolutionary biology]], it is well understood that all properties of organisms and [[ecosystems]] are [[emergent properties]] of fundamental physical law. The conceptual problems related to generations, offspring and populations that occur in [[artificial life]] systems stem from the fact that self-replication is itself an innovation of life on Earth.  The dynamics observed in modern self-replicating life forms on Earth are extremely complex [[emergent properties]] of the organisms themselves, not driving forces imposed by an external controlling entity.

'''Biplots''' are a type of exploratory graph used in [[statistics]], a generalization of the simple two-variable scatterplot. A biplot allows information on both [[sampling (statistics)|samples]] and variables of a [[data matrix (statistics)|data matrix]] to be displayed graphically. Samples are displayed as points while variables are displayed either as vectors, linear axes or nonlinear trajectories. In the case of categorical variables, ''category level points'' may be used to represent the levels of a categorical variable. A ''generalised'' biplot displays information on both continuous and categorical variables.

==Introduction and history==
The biplot was introduced by [[K. Ruben Gabriel]] (1971).&lt;ref&gt;'Gabriel, K. R. (1971). The biplot graphic display of matrices with application to principal component analysis. ''Biometrika'', ''58''(3), 453–467.&lt;/ref&gt; Gower and Hand (1996) wrote a monograph on biplots. Yan and Kang (2003) described various methods which can be used in order to visualize and interpret a biplot. The book by Greenacre (2010) is a practical user-oriented guide to biplots, along with scripts in the open-source [[R programming language]], to generate biplots associated with [[principal component analysis]] (PCA), [[multidimensional scaling]] (MDS), log-ratio analysis (LRA)—also known as spectral mapping&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Paul J. |last=Lewi |title=Spectral mapping, a personal and historical account of an adventure in multivariate data analysis |journal=Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems |volume=77 |issue=1-2 |year=2005 |pages=215–223 |doi=10.1016/j.chemolab.2004.07.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Livingstone (2009). ''A Practical Guide to Scientific Data Analysis.'' Chichester, John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd, 233–238. {{ISBN|978-0-470-85153-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;—[[discriminant analysis]] (DA) and various forms of [[correspondence analysis]]: simple correspondence analysis (CA), multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA).  The book by Gower, Lubbe and le Roux (2011) aims to popularize biplots as a useful and reliable method for the visualization of multivariate data when researchers want to consider, for example, principal component analysis (PCA), canonical variates analysis (CVA) or various types of correspondence analysis.

==Construction==
A biplot is constructed by using the [[singular value decomposition]] (SVD) to obtain a [[low-rank approximation]] to a transformed version of the data matrix '''X''', whose ''n'' rows are the samples (also called the cases, or objects), and whose ''p'' columns are the variables. The transformed data matrix '''Y''' is obtained from the original matrix '''X''' by centering and optionally standardizing the columns (the variables). Using the SVD, we can write '''Y'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;∑&lt;sub&gt;''k''=1,...''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''d''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;'''u'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;'''v'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;;, where the '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; are ''n''-dimensional column vectors, the '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; are ''p''-dimensional column vectors, and the ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; are a non-increasing sequence of non-negative [[scalar (mathematics)|scalars]]. The biplot is formed from two scatterplots that share a common set of axes and have a between-set [[scalar product]] interpretation. The first scatterplot is formed from the points (''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;''u''&lt;sub&gt;1''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;nbsp;''d''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;''u''&lt;sub&gt;2''i''&lt;/sub&gt;), for ''i''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,...,''n''.  The second plot is formed from the points (''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1−α&lt;/sup&gt;''v''&lt;sub&gt;1''j''&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''d''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1−α&lt;/sup&gt;''v''&lt;sub&gt;2''j''&lt;/sub&gt;), for ''j''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,...,''p''.  This is the biplot formed by the dominant two terms of the SVD, which can then be represented in a two-dimensional display.  Typical choices of α are 1 (to give a distance interpretation to the row display) and 0 (to give a distance interpretation to the column display), and in some rare cases α=1/2 to obtain a symmetrically scaled biplot (which gives no distance interpretation to the rows or the columns, but only the scalar product interpretation).  The set of points depicting the variables can be drawn as arrows from the origin to reinforce the idea that they represent biplot axes onto which the samples can be projected to approximate the original data.

'''Robert C. "Bob" Mants, Jr.''' (April 25, 1943 – December 7, 2011) was an American civil rights activist, serving as a field secretary for the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC). He helped lead [[Selma to Montgomery marches|the voting rights march from Selma to Montgomery]]; he was standing in the second rank (with [[Albert Turner (civil rights activist)|Albert Turner]], behind [[Hosea Williams]] and [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]]) on [[Bloody Sunday (1965)|Bloody Sunday]]. After Selma, Mants moved to [[Lowndes County, Alabama|Lowndes County]], working for civil rights for the remainder of his life. Lowndes County contained the majority of the distance covered by the Selma to Montgomery march, and was then notorious for its racist violence.

While in Americus, Mants reported over the [[Wide Area Telephone Service]] that "negro and white" mobs were forming on the evening of July 6, 1964, possibly in response to riots the evening before or the integration of two downtown restaurants earlier in the day, which had occurred without incident. Mants was working to calm and disperse the mobs. An hour later, Mants reported a drive-by shooting with no reported injuries or deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |url=http://cdm15932.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p15932coll2/id/24020 |title=King—July, 1964 WATS Line Calls |author=King, Mary E. |date=1962–1999 |publisher=Wisconsin Historical Society: Freedom Summer Collection |accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mants and [[Stokely Carmichael]] from the SNCC first arrived in Selma to participate in the 1965 Selma-to-Montgomery march;&lt;ref name=Interview /&gt; in photographs of Bloody Sunday taken by [[Spider Martin]], Mants can be seen wearing a patterned cap, marching next to Albert Turner just behind John Lewis after crossing the [[Edmund Pettus Bridge]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spidermartin.com/image-gallery/x3g93wop9oi0brr0tjwp54kfsoas96 |title=1/5 'Selma 1965 Bloody Sunday': Hosea Williams and John Lewis leading marchers over the Alabama River |author=Martin, Spider |date=7 March 1965 |publisher=Spider Martin |accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spidermartin.com/image-gallery/rxtx0c3nbgkjd4gn6gkdr6uzxvel9h |title=1/7 'Two Minute Warning': Hosea Williams and John Lewis confront troopers on Bloody Sunday |author=Martin, Spider |date=7 March 1965 |publisher=Spider Martin |accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; earlier that morning, Mants had participated in a prayer at the [[Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church (Selma, Alabama)|Brown Chapel A.M.E.

While marching to Montgomery in late March 1965, Mants was passing out buttons and leaflets when a resident of Lowndes County, pleased the civil rights movement was coming to her, memorably quoted [[Revelation 7]]:9 to him.&lt;ref name=Interview /&gt; In 1964, Lowndes County had no registered black voters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/14/us/ex-black-militant-gets-life-for-murdering-deputy.html |title=Ex-Black Militant Gets Life for Murdering Deputy |author=Firestone, David |date=14 March 2002 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though the county's population was predominantly black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/05/us/a-selma-march-relives-those-first-steps-of-65.html |title=A Selma March Relives Those First Steps of '65 |author=Smothers, Ronald |date=5 March 1990 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=21 February 2017 |quote=Two months after Bloody Sunday, Robert Mants said as he marched today, an organization he was in got to work in nearby Lowndes County, which was 81 percent black and had fewer than 30 black registered voters and no black elected officials.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The county was known as "Bloody Lowndes" or the rusty buckle of the [[Black Belt (region of Alabama)|Black Belt of Alabama]] because of its long, violent history of whites retaliating against blacks who tried to register to vote.&lt;ref name=BloodyLowndes&gt;{{cite book |url=https://nyupress.org/books/9780814743317/ |title=Bloody Lowndes: Civil Rights and Black Power in Alabama's Black Belt |author=Jeffries, Hasan Kwame |date=August 2010 |isbn=978-0-81474-331-7 |publisher=New York University Press |location=New York, New York |accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Interview&gt;{{cite interview |subject=Bob Mants |interviewer=Carroll Blue |date=18 October 1988 |publisher=Washington University Libraries, Film and Media Archive, Henry Hampton Collection |accessdate=21 February 2017 |title=Eyes on the Prize II: America at the Racial Crossroads 1965 to 1985 |url=http://digital.wustl.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=eop;cc=eop;rgn=main;view=text;idno=man5427.0175.102}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Mants and other SNCC officials began to register black voters,&lt;ref name=AlBenn /&gt; the newly registered voters, many of which still lived on plantations, were made homeless by the predominantly white landowners.&lt;ref name=Interview /&gt; Many of the displaced black residents were housed in a temporary "Tent City" and subject to intimidation over the next two years as shots were regularly fired into the encampment.&lt;ref name=SNCC /&gt; In response, SNCC set up the [[Alabama Poor People's Land Fund]] to purchase plots of land and building materials to help the displaced black residents to build new homes.&lt;ref name=Interview /&gt;

SNCC also tried a new strategy in Lowndes County, setting up the [[Lowndes County Freedom Organization]] (LCFO) in 1966 as an independent Black political party, adopting a snarling black panther as its logo. LCFO would in turn inspire other leaders, such as Stokely Carmichael, who adopted the structure of LCFO for [[Black Power]], and [[Bobby Seale]] and [[Huey P. Newton]], who adopted the black panther logo for the [[Black Panther Party]].&lt;ref name=BloodyLowndes /&gt;

Mants remained in Lowndes County after the march, saying "if there was any place I wanted to raise my kids, it would be here, because they could see black people moving forward, advancing ourselves as a race."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/02/us/in-selma-everything-and-nothing-changed.html?pagewanted=all |title=In Selma, Everything and Nothing Changed |author=Applebome, Peter |date=2 August 1994 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mants served as a farm management specialist at [[Tuskegee University]].&lt;ref name=AlBenn /&gt; In 1984, Mants was elected to the Lowndes County Commission, unseating a white incumbent, and served one term.&lt;ref name=SNCC /&gt;&lt;ref name=AlBenn /&gt;

In 2000, Mants opposed the creation of a landfill along [[U.S. Route 80]], the highway taken by marchers in the third Selma to Montgomery march, calling it "an insult." As head of Lowndes County Friends of the Trail, he noted "you can't commemorate [the route of the march] on the one hand and desecrate it on the other."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/02/us/at-odds-in-alabama-over-a-landfill-on-a-historic-trail.html |title=At Odds in Alabama Over a Landfill on a Historic Trail |author=Sengupta, Somini |date=2 October 2000 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a member of the aspartyl proteases, HIV protease is highly substrate-selective and cleavage-specific.

==Chou’s distorted key theory==
Knowledge of the protein cleavage sites by HIV protease can provide very useful information for finding effective inhibitors against the culprit enzyme, as elaborated by [[Kuo-Chen Chou]].&lt;ref name="Chou01"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Chou K.C. | title = Review: Prediction of human immunodeficiency virus protease cleavage sites in proteins | journal = Analytical Biochemistry | volume = 233 |  pages = 1–14 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8789141 | doi = 10.1006/abio.1996.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Fisher’s [[lock-and-key model]] proposed by [[Hermann Emil Fischer]] in 1884 and Koshland’s [[induced fit]] theory by [[Daniel E. Koshland, Jr.]] in 1958, given a peptide, the prerequisite condition for it to be cleaved by HIV-protease is a good fit and binding between the substrate and the enzyme’s active site.  However, such a peptide, after a modification on its scissile bond with some simple chemical procedure, will completely lose its cleavability but it can still tightly bind to the enzyme’s active site. According to [[Kuo-Chen Chou]], the molecule thus modified can be likened to a ‘‘distorted key”,&lt;ref name=Chou01/&gt; which can be inserted into a lock but can neither open the lock nor automatically get out from it. That is why a molecule modified from a cleavable peptide can spontaneously become a competitive inhibitor against the enzyme.

An illustration about Chou’s distorted key theory is given in Fig.3, where panel (a) shows an effective binding of a cleavable peptide to the active site of HIV protease, while panel (b) the peptide has become a non-cleavable one after its scissile bond is modified although it can still bind to the active site. Such a modified peptide, or ‘‘distorted key”, will automatically become an [[Enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]] candidate against HIV protease.

[[Image:K3 distorted key.jpg|thumb|right|400px| Figure 3. An illustration for the Chou’s distorted key theory, where panel (a) shows an effective binding of a cleavable peptide to the active site of HIV protease, while panel (b) the peptide has become a non-cleavable one after its scissile bond is modified although it can still bind to the active site. Such a modified peptide, or ‘‘distorted key”, will automatically become an inhibitor candidate against HIV protease.]]

Even for non-peptide inhibitors, the information derived from the cleavable peptides can also provide useful insights about the key binding groups and fitting conformation, among many other detailed requirements in [[Habitat|microenvironment]].

Many efforts have been made to predict the protein cleavage sites by HIV-protease (see, e.g.,

In [[cognitive psychology]] and [[decision science]], '''conservatism''' or '''conservatism bias''' is a [[cognitive bias|bias]] in human information processing, which refers to the tendency to revise one's belief insufficiently when presented with new evidence. This bias describes human [[belief revision]] in which persons over-weigh the [[prior distribution]] ([[base rate]]) and under-weigh new [[statistical sample|sample evidence]] when compared to Bayesian belief-revision.

According to the theory, "opinion change is very orderly, and usually proportional to the numbers of [[Bayes' theorem]] – but it is insufficient in amount".&lt;ref name="edwards1"/&gt; In other words, persons update their prior beliefs as new evidence becomes available, but they do so more slowly than they would if they used Bayes' theorem.

This bias was discussed by [[Ward Edwards]] in 1968,&lt;ref name="edwards1"/&gt; who reported on experiments like the following one:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There are two bookbags, one containing 700 red and 300 blue chips, the other containing 300 red and 700 blue. Take one of the bags. Now, you sample, randomly, with replacement after each chip. In 12 samples, you get 8 reds and 4 blues. what is the probability that this is the predominantly red bag?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Most subjects chose an answer around .7. The correct answer according to Bayes' theorem is closer to .97. Edwards suggested that people updated beliefs conservatively, in accordance with Bayes' theorem more slowly. They updated from .5 incorrectly according to an observed bias in several experiments.&lt;ref name="edwards1"/&gt;

==In finance==

In finance, evidence has been found that investors under-react to corporate events, consistent with conservatism. This includes announcements of earnings, changes in [[dividend]]s, and [[stock split]]s.&lt;ref name=Kadiyala/&gt;

==Possible explanations==
The traditional explanation for this effect is that it is an extension of the [[anchoring bias]], as studied by Tversky and Kahneman. The initial "anchor" is the .5 probability given when there are two choices without any other evidence, and people fail to adjust sufficiently far away. However, a recent study suggests that the belief revising conservatism can be explained by an [[information-theoretic]] generative mechanism and that assumes a noisy conversion of objective evidence (observation) into subjective estimates (judgment).&lt;ref name="HilbertPsychBull"/&gt; The study explains that the estimates of conditional probabilities are conservative because of noise in the retrieval of information from memory, whereas noise is defined as the mixing of evidence. Memories of high likelihoods are mixed with evidence of low likelihood and the resulting estimate is lower than it should be. The retrieval of memories of lower likelihoods are higher than they should be, and the result is conservatism (low is not low enough, and high is not high enough, the result is not extreme enough, which is conservative).

In an incentivized experimental study, it has been shown that the conservatism bias decreased in those with greater cognitive ability, though it did not disappear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Cognitive abilities and behavioral biases|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167268109001103|journal = Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization|date = 2009|pages = 147–152|volume = 72|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/j.jebo.2009.04.018|first = Jörg|last = Oechssler|first2 = Andreas|last2 = Roider|first3 = Patrick W.|last3 = Schmitz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cyberbullying''' or '''cyberharassment''' is a form of [[bullying]] or [[harassment]] using electronic means. Cyberbullying and Cyberharassment are also known as '''online bullying'''. It has become increasingly common, especially among teenagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cyberbullying: its nature and impact in secondary school pupils|journal=The Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry | doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2007.01846.x|pmid=18363945 |volume=49|issue=4|pages=376–385|year=2008|last1=Smith|first1=Peter K.|last2=Mahdavi|first2=Jess|last3=Carvalho|first3=Manuel|last4=Fisher|first4=Sonja|last5=Russell|first5=Shanette|last6=Tippett|first6=Neil}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyberbullying is when someone, typically teens, bully or harass others on social media sites.  Harmful bullying behavior can include posting rumors, [[threats]], sexual remarks, a [[Doxing|victims' personal information]], or pejorative labels (i.e., [[hate speech]]).&lt;ref name="definitions.uslegal.com" /&gt; Bullying or harassment can be identified by repeated behavior and an intent to harm.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Victims may have lower self-esteem, increased [[suicidal ideation]], and a variety of emotional responses, including being scared, frustrated, angry, and depressed.&lt;ref name="patchin3" /&gt;

Awareness in the United States has risen in the [[2010s]], due in part to high-profile cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/02/nyregion/02suicide.html?_r=0|title=Legal Debate Swirls Over Charges in a Student's Suicide|last=Hu|first=Winnie|date=1 October 2010|work=New York Times|access-date=1 December 2016|publisher=|others=Nate Schweber|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chapin|first=John|date=2014-08-17|title=Adolescents and Cyber Bullying: The Precaution Adoption Process Model|journal=Education and Information Technologies|language=en|volume=21|issue=4|pages=719–728|doi=10.1007/s10639-014-9349-1|issn=1360-2357}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several US states and other countries have laws specific to cyberbullying.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Some are designed to specifically target teen cyberbullying, while others use laws extending from the scope of physical harassment.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In cases of adult cyberharassment, these reports are usually filed beginning with local police.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Research has demonstrated a number of serious consequences of cyberbullying victimization.&lt;ref name="patchin1" /&gt;

[[Internet troll]]ing is a common form of bullying over the Internet in an [[online community]] (such as in [[Online game|online gaming]] or [[social media]]) in order to elicit a reaction, disruption, or for someone's own personal amusement.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pewFiveFacts" /&gt; Cyberstalking is another form of bullying or harassment that uses electronic communications to [[Stalking|stalk]] a victim; this may pose a credible threat to the victim.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Not all negative interaction online or on social media can be attributed to cyberbullying. Research suggests that there are also interactions online that result in [[peer pressure]], which can have a negative, positive, or neutral impact on those involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Keeffe|first=Gwenn Schurgin|last2=Clarke-Pearson|first2=Kathleen|last3=Media|first3=Council on Communications and|date=2011-04-01|title=The Impact of Social Media on Children, Adolescents, and Families|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/127/4/800|journal=Pediatrics|language=en|volume=127|issue=4|pages=800–804|doi=10.1542/peds.2011-0054|issn=0031-4005|pmid=21444588}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/suren-ramasubbu/influence-of-social-media-on-teenagers_b_7427740.html|title=Influence of Social Media on Teenagers|last=Ramasubbu|first=Suren|date=2015-05-26|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/the-teenage-brain-on-social-media|title=The teenage brain on social media|last=Wolpert|first=Stuart|website=UCLA Newsroom|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==
A frequently used definition of cyberbullying is "an aggressive, intentional act or behavior that is carried out by a group or an individual, using electronic forms of contact, repeatedly and over time against a victim who cannot easily defend him or herself."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moreno|first=Megan A.|date=2014-05-01|title=Cyberbullying|journal=JAMA Pediatrics|volume=168|issue=5|doi=10.1001/jamapediatrics.2013.3343|pmid=24791741|issn=2168-6203|page=500}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many variations of the definition, such as the [[National Crime Prevention Council]]'s more specific definition: "the process of using the Internet, cell phones or other devices to send or post text or images intended to hurt or embarrass another person."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Cyberbullying is often similar to traditional bullying, with some notable distinctions. Victims of cyberbullying may not know the identity of their bully, or why the bully is targeting them. The harassment can have wide-reaching effects on the victim, as the content used to harass the victim can be spread and shared easily among many people and often remains accessible long after the initial incident.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pettalia|first=Jennifer L.|last2=Levin|first2=Elizabeth|last3=Dickinson|first3=Joël|date=2013-11-01|title=Cyberbullying: Eliciting harm without consequence|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563213002586|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=29|issue=6|pages=2758–2765|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2013.07.020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms "cyberharassment" and "cyberbullying" are sometimes used synonymously, though some people use  the latter to refer specifically to harassment among minors or in a school setting.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite report|url=https://www.hsdl.org/?abstract&amp;did=735549|title=Protection of Children Online: Federal and State Laws Addressing Cyberstalking, Cyberharassment, and Cyberbullying|last=Smith|first=Alison M.|date=5 September 2008|issue=|doi=|volume=|pmid=|id=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cyberstalking===
{{further|Cyberstalking}}
Cyberstalking is a form of online harassment in which the perpetrator uses electronic communications to [[Stalking|stalk]] a victim. This is considered more dangerous than other forms of cyberbullying because it generally involves a credible threat to the victim's safety. Cyberstalkers may send repeated messages intended to threaten or harass. They may encourage others to do the same, either explicitly or by impersonating their victim and asking others to contact them.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Trolling ===
{{Further|Internet troll}}
Internet trolls intentionally try to provoke or offend others in order to elicit a reaction.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Diaz|first=Fernando L.|year=2016|title=Trolling &amp; the First Amendment: Protecting Internet Speech in the Era of Cyberbullies &amp; Internet Defamation|url=|journal=University of Illinois Journal of Law, Technology &amp; Policy|volume=|pages=135–160|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trolls and cyberbullies do not always have the same goals: while some trolls engage in cyberbullying, others may be engaged in comparatively harmless mischief. A troll may be disruptive either for their own amusement or because they are genuinely a combative person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/10/what-an-academic-who-wrote-her-dissertation-on-trolls-thinks-of-violentacrez/263631/|title = What an Academic Who Wrote Her Dissertation on Trolls Thinks of Violentacrez|date = October 15, 2012|accessdate = |website = The Atlantic|publisher = |last = Phillips|first = Whitney}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manuals to educate the public, teachers and parents summarize, "Cyberbullying is being cruel to others by sending or posting harmful material using a cell phone or the internet." Research, legislation and education in the field are ongoing. Research has identified basic definitions and guidelines to help recognize and cope with what is regarded as abuse of electronic communications.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}
* Cyberbullying involves repeated behavior with intent to harm.
* Cyberbullying is perpetrated through [[harassment]], [[cyberstalking]], denigration (sending or posting cruel rumors and falsehoods to damage reputation and friendships), [[impersonation]], and exclusion (intentionally and cruelly excluding someone from an online group)&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110410181159/http://csriu.org/cyberbully/docs/cbcteducator.pdf ''An Educator's Guide to Cyberbullying''] Brown Senate.gov, archived from [http://www.csriu.org/cyberbully/docs/cbcteducator.pdf the original] on 10 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyberbullying can be as simple as continuing to send emails or text messages harassing someone who has said they want no further contact with the sender. It may also include public actions such as repeated [[threat]]s, sexual remarks, pejorative labels (i.e. [[hate speech]]) or defamatory false accusations, ganging up on a victim by making the person the subject of ridicule in online forums, hacking into or vandalizing sites about a person, and posting false statements as fact aimed a discrediting or humiliating a targeted person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Defining a Cyberbully|url=https://www.nsf.gov/discoveries/disc_summ.jsp?cntn_id=121847|publisher=The National Science Foundation|accessdate=November 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyberbullying could be limited to posting rumors about a person on the internet with the intention of bringing about hatred in others' minds or convincing others to dislike or participate in online denigration of a target. It may go to the extent of personally identifying victims of crime and publishing materials defaming or humiliating them.&lt;ref name="definitions.uslegal.com"&gt;[http://definitions.uslegal.com/c/cyber-bullying/ Cyberbullying – Law and Legal Definitions] US Legal&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyberbullies may disclose victims' personal data (e.g. real name, home address, or workplace/schools) on websites or forums—called [[doxing]], or may use [[impersonation]], creating fake accounts, comments or sites posing as their target for the purpose of publishing material in their name that defames, discredits or ridicules them. This can leave the cyberbully anonymous, which can make it difficult for them to be caught or punished for their behavior, although not all cyberbullies maintain their anonymity. Text or instant messages and emails between friends can also constitute cyberbullying if what is said is hurtful.

The recent rise of smartphones and mobile apps have yielded a more accessible form of cyberbullying. It is expected that cyberbullying via these platforms will occur more often than through more stationary internet platforms. In addition, the combination of cameras and Internet access and the instant availability of these modern smartphone technologies yield specific types of cyberbullying not found in other platforms. It is likely that those cyberbullied via mobile devices will experience a wider range of types cyberbullying than those who are exclusively bullied elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Görzig|first=Anke|author2=Lara A. Frumkin|title=Cyberbullying experiences on-the-go: When social media can become distressing|journal=Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace|volume=7|issue=1|year=2013|url=http://www.cyberpsychology.eu/view.php?cisloclanku=2013022801&amp;article=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some teens argue that some events categorized as cyberbullying are simply drama. Danah Boyd writes, "teens regularly used that word [drama] to describe various forms of interpersonal conflict that ranged from insignificant joking around to serious jealousy-driven relational aggression. Whereas adults might have labeled many of these practices as bullying, teens saw them as drama."&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, D. (2014). Bullying is social media amplifying meanness and cruelty? In It's Complicated the social lives of networked teens (p. 137). New Haven, CT: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In social media ===
Cyberbullying can take place on social media sites such as Facebook, Myspace, and Twitter. "By 2008, 93% of young people between the ages of 12 and 17 were online. In fact, youth spend more time with media than any single other activity besides sleeping."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewresearch.org/millennials/teen-internet-use-graphic/ |title=Teen and Young Adult Internet Use |work=Pew Internet Project |accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last decade has witnessed a surge of cyberbullying, bullying that occurs through the use of electronic communication technologies, such as e-mail, instant messaging, social media, online gaming, or through digital messages or images sent to a cellular phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kowalski, Giumetti, Schroeder &amp; Lattanner|first=R.

R.|year=2014|title=Bullying in the digital age: A critical review and meta-analysis of cyberbullying research among youth.|url=|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=140|issue=4|pages=1073–1137|via=google scholar|doi=10.1037/a0035618|pmid=24512111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many risks attached to social media sites, and cyberbullying is one of the larger risks. One million children were harassed, threatened or subjected to other forms of cyberbullying on Facebook during the past year,{{when|date=December 2017}} while 90 percent of social-media-using teens who have witnessed online cruelty say they have ignored mean behavior on social media, and 35 percent have done so frequently. 95 percent of social-media-using teens who have witnessed cruel behavior on social networking sites say they have seen others ignoring the mean behavior, and 55 percent have witnessed this frequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.internetsafety101.org/cyberbullyingstatistics.htm |title=Cyberbullying Statistics |work=Internet Safety 101 |accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2013 Pew Research study, eight out of ten teens who use social media now share more information about themselves than they have in the past. This includes their location, images, and contact information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2013/05/21/teens-social-media-and-privacy/ |title=Teens, Social Media, and Privacy |accessdate=15 November 2015|date=2013-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to protect children, it is important that personal information such as age, birthday, school/church, phone number, etc. be kept confidential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highya.com/articles-guides/stranger-danger-protecting-your-children-from-cyber-bullying-sexting-and-social-media |title=Stranger Danger: Protecting Your Children from Cyber Bullying, Sexting, &amp; Social Media |accessdate=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two studies from 2014 found that 80% of body-shaming [[Twitter|tweets]] are sent by women, while they also accounted for 50% of [[Misogyny|misogynistic]] tweets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-36380247|title=Twitter abuse - '50% of misogynistic tweets from women'|date=2016-05-26|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-09-07|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.demos.co.uk/press-release/staggering-scale-of-social-media-misogyny-mapped-in-new-demos-study/|title=New Demos study reveals scale of social media misogyny - Demos|website=www.demos.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyberbullying can also take place through the use of websites belonging to certain groups to effectively request the targeting of another individual or group. An example of this is the [[#Bullying of climate scientists and activists|bullying of climate scientists and activists]].&lt;ref name=scientificamerican-climate&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/climate-cyber-bullying|title=Cyber Bullying Intensifies as Climate Data Questioned|author1=Douglas Fischer |author2=The Daily Climate |work=scientificamerican.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=timemag-climate&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ideas.time.com/2012/04/10/when-grownups-bully-climate-scientists/|title=Dominique Browning: When Grownups Bully Climate Scientists – TIME.com|work=TIME.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=latrobe-climate&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latrobe.edu.au/news/articles/2011/opinion/bullying-climate-change-scientists|title=Bullying climate change scientists|work=latrobe.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In gaming ===
{{See also|Gamergate controversy}}
[[File:Gamers Playin expo.jpg|thumb|Harassment in [[gaming culture]] can occur in [[Online game|online gaming]].]]
Of those who reported having experienced online harassment in a Pew Research poll, 16% said the most recent incident had occurred in an online game.&lt;ref name="pewFiveFacts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/10/30/5-facts-about-online-harassment/|last=Duggan|first=Maeve|publisher=Pew Research Center|title=5 facts about online harassment}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study from National Sun Yat-sen University observed that children who enjoyed violent video games were significantly more likely to both experience and perpetrate cyberbullying.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Paths to Bullying in Online Gaming: The Effects of Gender, Preference for Playing Violent Games, Hostility, and Aggressive Behavior on Bullying|journal=Journal of Educational Computing Research|volume=47|issue=3|pages=235–249|doi=10.2190/ec.47.3.a|year=2013|last1=Yang|first1=Shu Ching}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study that discusses the direct correlation between exposure to violent video games and cyber bullying also took into account personal factors such as "duration of playing online games, alcohol consumption in the last 3 months, parents drunk in the last 3 months, anger, hostility, ADHD, and a sense of belonging"&lt;ref&gt;Lam L, Cheng Z and Liu X, 'Violent Online Games Exposure And Cyberbullying/Victimization Among Adolescents' (2013) 16 Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking&lt;/ref&gt; as potential contributing factors of cyberbullying.

Gaming was a more common venue for men in which to experience harassment, whereas women's harassment tended to occur via social media.&lt;ref name="washpoPewGamergate"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2014/10/23/gamergate-and-how-internet-users-think-about-gaming-and-harassment/|last=Rosenberg|first=Alyssa|work=The Washington Post|title=Gamergate and how Internet users think about gaming and harassment}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most respondents considered [[gaming culture]] to be equally welcoming to both genders, though 44% thought it favored men.&lt;ref name="nprPewLeastWelcoming"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2014/10/22/357826882/pew-gaming-is-least-welcoming-online-space-for-women|last=Hu|first=Elise|publisher=NPR|work=All Tech Considered|title=Pew: Gaming Is Least Welcoming Online Space For Women}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keza MacDonald writes in ''[[The Guardian]]'' that [[sexism in gaming|sexism exists in gaming culture]], but is not mainstream within it.&lt;ref name="guardianReallySexist"&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2012/mar/06/are-gamers-really-sexist|work=[[The Guardian]]|last=MacDonald|first=Keza|title=Are gamers really sexist?|date=2012-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual harassment in gaming generally involves slurs directed towards women, sex role stereotyping, and overaggressive language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Gender Stereotypes, Aggression, and Computer Games: An Online Survey of Women|journal=CyberPsychology &amp; Behavior|volume=7|issue=6|pages=714–27|doi=10.1089/cpb.2004.7.714|pmid=15687807|year=2004|last1=Norris|first1=Kamala O.}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] made reference to the harassment of women gamers during his remarks in honor of Women's History Month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/03/16/remarks-president-reception-honor-womens-history-month|title=Remarks by the President at Reception in Honor of Women's History Month|date=March 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In search engines ===
[[Information cascade]]s happen when users start passing along information they assume to be true, but cannot know to be true, based on information on what other users are doing. This can be accelerated by search engines' ranking technologies and their [[personalized search|tendency to return results relevant to a user's previous interests]]. This type of information spreading is hard to stop. Information cascades over social media and the Internet may also be harmless, and may contain truthful information.&lt;ref name=citron-hatecrimes /&gt;

Bullies use [[Google bomb]]s (a term applicable to any search engine){{citation needed|date=June 2016}} to increase the prominence of favored posts sorted by the most popular searches, done by linking to those posts from as many other web pages as possible. Examples include the [[campaign for the neologism "santorum"]] organized by the [[LGBT]] lobby. Google bombs can manipulate the Internet's search engines regardless of how authentic the pages are, but there is a way to counteract this type of manipulation as well.&lt;ref name=citron-hatecrimes&gt;{{Cite book|title = Hate Crimes in Cyberspace|last = Citron|first = Danielle|publisher = Harvard University Press|year = 2014 |location = Cambridge, Mass., USA &amp; London, UK|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=wmiABAAAQBAJ |isbn=978-0-674-36829-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Schools ===
The safety of schools is increasingly becoming a focus of state legislative action. There was an increase in cyberbullying enacted legislation between 2006 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsl.org/issues-research/educ/cyberbullying.aspx Cyberbullying Enacted Legislation: 2006–2010] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130609000529/http://www.ncsl.org/issues-research/educ/cyberbullying.aspx |date=June 9, 2013 }} Legislation by State, NCSL&lt;/ref&gt; Initiatives and curriclulum requirements also exist in the UK (the [[Ofsted eSafety guidance]]) and Australia ([[Overarching Learning Outcome 13]]).

In 2012, a group of teenagers in a design class [[New Haven, Connecticut]] developed an application to help fight bullying, "Back Off Bully" (BOB). This is an anonymous resource for computer, smart phone or iPad. When someone witnesses or is the victim of bullying, they can immediately report the incident. The app asks questions about time, location and how the bullying is happening, as well as providing positive action and empowerment regarding the incident. The reported information goes to a database, where it may be studied by administrators. Common threads are spotted so others can intervene and break the bully's pattern.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.whdh.com/news/articles/local/south/12007792580056/ct-teens-develop-bullying-app-to-protect-peers/ CT teens develop bullying app to protect peers] 7 News; June 2012 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622100810/http://www1.whdh.com/news/articles/local/south/12007792580056/ct-teens-develop-bullying-app-to-protect-peers/ |date=June 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Back Off Bully" is being considered as standard operating procedure at schools across Connecticut, while recent studies carried out among 66 high school teachers have concluded that prevention programs have proved ineffective to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1002/pits.21603 | volume=49| issue=4|year=2012|journal=Psychology in the Schools|pages=352–367 | last1 = Stauffer | first1 = Sterling |title = High school teachers' perceptions of cyberbullying prevention and intervention strategies| last2 = Allen Heath | first2 = Melissa | last3 = Marie Coyne | first3 = Sarah | last4 = Ferrin | first4 = Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Protection ===
There are laws that only address online harassment of children or focus on child predators, as well as laws that protect adult cyberstalking victims, or victims of any age. Currently, there are 45 cyberstalking (and related) laws on the books. While some sites specialize in laws that protect victims age 18 and under, Working to Halt Online Abuse is a help resource containing a list of current and pending cyberstalking-related United States federal and state laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haltabuse.org/resources/laws/index.shtml Current and pending cyberstalking-related United States federal and state laws] WHOA&lt;/ref&gt; It also lists those states that do not yet have laws, and related laws from other countries. The Global Cyber Law Database (GCLD) aims to become the most comprehensive and authoritative source of cyber laws for all countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyberlawdb.com/main/ The Global Cyber Law Database] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620182226/http://www.cyberlawdb.com/main/ |date=June 20, 2012 }} GCLD&lt;/ref&gt; Some states such as Florida, California, and Missouri have developed state laws against Cyberbullying. California has the Safe Place to Learn Act and also has a law that states "the use of an electronic device to cause someone to fear for their life" can be charged with a misdemeanor which can be punishable to up to one year in prison. In Florida, the "Jeffrey Johnson Stand Up for All Students Act" prohibits any type of bullying and does speak on cyberbullying. In Missouri, anyone who violently threatens someone over social media can be convicted with a Class A misdemeanor, but if the victim is seventeen years or younger,they can be convicted with a Class D felony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-charges/cyber-bullying.html|title=Cyberbullying Laws - FindLaw|work=Findlaw|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Age ===
Children report negative online behaviors occurring from the second grade. According to research, boys initiate negative online activity earlier than girls. However, by middle school, girls are more likely to engage in cyberbullying than boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=MacDonald|first1=Gregg|title=Cyber-bullying defies traditional stereotype: Girls are more likely than boys to engage in this new trend, research suggests|work=Fairfax Times|date=September 1, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526084157/http://ww2.fairfaxtimes.com/cms/story.php?id=2078 |url=http://www.fairfaxtimes.com/cms/story.php?id=2078|archivedate=May 26, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether the bully is male or female, the purpose is to intentionally embarrass, harass, intimidate, or make threats online.

Studies on the psycho-social effects of cyberspace have begun to monitor the effects cyberbullying may have on the victims. Consequences of cyberbullying are multi-faceted, and affect online and offline behavior. Research on adolescents reported that changes in the victims' behavior as a result of cyberbullying could potentially  be positive. Victims "created a cognitive pattern of bullies, which consequently helped them to recognize aggressive people."&lt;ref name="cyberpsychology.eu"&gt;[http://www.cyberpsychology.eu/view.php?cisloclanku=2011121901&amp;article=4 Cyberbullying in Adolescent Victims: Perception and Coping] Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the ''Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace'' abstract reports critical impacts in almost all of the respondents, taking the form of lower self-esteem, loneliness, disillusionment, and distrust of people. The more extreme effects included [[self-harm]]. Children have killed each other and committed [[suicide]] after cyberbullying incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stopcyberbullying.org/what_is_cyberbullying_exactly.html |title=Stop Cyberbullying |publisher=Stop Cyberbullying |date=2005-06-27 |accessdate=2013-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some cases of digital self-harm have been reported, in which an individual engages in cyberbullying against themselves, or purposefully and knowingly exposes themselves to cyberbullying.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|last=Topping|first=Alexandra|title=Cyberbullying on social networks spawning form of self-harm|journal=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/aug/06/cyberbullying-social-networks-self-harm|accessdate=6 August 2013|date=2013-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Englander|first=Elizabeth|title=Digital Self-Harm: Frequency, Type, Motivations, and Outcomes|journal=MARC Research Reports|date=June 2012|volume=5|url=http://vc.bridgew.edu/marc_reports/5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Adults ===
Cyberstalking may be an extension of physical stalking,&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;https://docs.education.gov.au/system/files/doc/other/australian_covert_bullying_prevalence_study_chapter_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and may have criminal consequences. A target's understanding of why cyberstalking is happening is helpful to remedy and take protective action. Among factors that motivate stalkers are [[envy]], pathological obsession (professional or sexual), unemployment or failure with own job or life, or the desire to intimidate and cause others to feel inferior. The stalker may be [[delusional]] and believe he/she "knows" the target. The stalker wants to instill fear in a person to justify his/her status, or may  believe they can get away with these actions (anonymity).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/criminal_mind/psychology/cyberstalking/3.html |author=Wayne Petherick |title=Cyber-Stalking:Obsessional Pursuit and the Digital Criminal |date=2009 |work=TrueTV |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209045152/http://trutv.com/library/crime/criminal_mind/psychology/cyberstalking/3.html |archivedate=February 9, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US federal cyberstalking law is designed to prosecute people for using electronic means to repeatedly harass or threaten someone online. There are resources dedicated to helping adult victims deal with cyberbullies legally and effectively. One of the steps recommended is to record everything and contact police.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiredsafety.org/subjects/cyberbullying.php Cyberbullying] Stalking and Harassment&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;[http://voices.yahoo.com/what-cyberbullies-adults-11081994.html What to Do About Cyberbullies: For Adults], by Rena Sherwood; YAHOO Contributor network&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian Covert Bullying Prevalence Study (ACBPS). Child Health Promotion Research Centre, Edith Cowan University, Perth]. Deewr.gov.au. Retrieved on July 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; assessed cyberbullying experiences among 7,418 students. Rates of cyberbullying increased with age, with 4.9% of students in Year 4 reporting cyberbullying compared to 7.9% in year nine. Cross et al., (2009) reported that rates of bullying and harassing others were lower, but also increased with age. Only 1.2% of Year 4 students reported cyberbullying others compared to 5.6% of Year 9 students.

=== China ===
In mainland China, cyberbullying has yet to receive adequate scholarly attention. A study investigating the risk factors of cyberbullying sampled 1438 high school students from central China. Data  showed that 34.84% had participated in bullying and 56.88% had been bullied online.&lt;!-- (Commenting this out until it's rewritten in a way that makes sense.)

It is common among high school students (28 out of 36 students) to participate in social media platforms. 58% admitted to changing a nickname for others, 56.3% to humiliation, 54.2% to making fun of someone, and 54.2% to spreading rumors. The Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups interviewed 1820 teenagers, 17.5% of whom indicated having experienced cyberbullying. This included insults, abuse, and the publishing of personal private pictures on social media without permission.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

=== Finland ===
Sourander et al. (2010) conducted a population-based cross-sectional study that took place in Finland. The authors of this study took the self-reports of 2215 Finish adolescents between the ages of 13 and 16 about cyberbullying and cybervictimization during the previous six months. It was found that, amongst the total sample, 4.8% were victims only, 7.4% were cyberbullies only, and 5.4% were cyberbully-victims.

The authors of this study were able to conclude that cyberbullying as well as cybervictimization is associated not only with psychiatric issues, but psychosomatic issues. Many adolescents in the study reported headaches or difficulty sleeping. The authors believe that their results indicate a greater need for new ideas on how to prevent cyberbullying and what to do when it occurs. It is clearly a worldwide problem that needs to be taken seriously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sourander, A. |author2=Klomek, A.B. |author3=Ikonen, M. |author4=Lindroos, J. |author5=Luntamo, T. |author6=Koskeiainen, M. |author7=Helenius, H. |title=Psychosocial risk factors associated with cyberbullying among adolescents: A population-based study|year=2010|journal=Archives of General Psychiatry|volume=67|issue=7|pages=720–728|url=http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/67/7/720|doi=10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2010.79 |pmid=20603453 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thanks.)The journal article titled "Exploring traditional and cyberbullying among Irish adolescents" studies by --&gt;The Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) pilot survey was carried out in eight post-primary schools across Ireland, including 318 students aged 15–18. 59% were boys and 41% were girls. Participation in this survey was voluntary for students, and consent had to be obtained from parents, students and the school itself. This survey was anonymous and confidential, and took 40 minutes to complete. It asked questions on traditional forms of bullying as well as cyberbullying, risk behaviours and self-reported health and [[life satisfaction]].

66% of the students said that they had never been bullied. 14% had been victims of traditional forms of bullying. 10% had been victims of cyberbullying, and the remaining 10% had been victims of both traditional forms of bullying and cyberbullying. Boys mostly said they were victims of traditional forms of bullying, and girls mostly were victims of both traditional forms of bullying and cyberbullying. 20% of the students in this survey said that they had been cyberbullied, showing that cyberbullying is on the rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Kelly|first2=Colette|last3=Molcho|first3=Michal|year=2014|title=360 Link|journal=International Journal of Public Health|volume=60|issue=2|pages=199–206|doi=10.1007/s00038-014-0638-7|pmid=25540816|last1=Callaghan|first1=Mary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Japan ===
According to recent{{when|date=December 2017}} research, in Japan, 17 percent (compared with a 25-country average of 37 percent) of youth between the ages of 8 and 17 have been victims of online bullying. The number shows that online bullying is a serious concern in Japan. Teenagers who spend more than 10 hours a week on the Internet are more likely to become the targets of online bullying. Only 28 percent of the survey participants understood what cyberbullying is. However, they do know the severity of the issue; 63 percent of the surveyed students worried about being targeted as victims of cyberbullying.&lt;ref&gt;Cross-Tab Marketing Services &amp; Telecommunications Research Group for Microsoft Corporation&lt;/ref&gt;

Since teenagers find themselves congregating socially on the internet via social media, they become easy targets for cyberbullying. Cyberbullying may occur via email, text, chat rooms, and social media websites. Some cyberbullies set up websites or blogs to post the target's images, publicize their personal information, gossip about the target, express why they hate the target, request people to agree with the bully's view, and send links to the target to make sure they are watching the activity.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Marilyn A. (2005). Cyber bullying: An old problem in a new guise?&lt;/ref&gt;

Much cyberbullying is an act of relational aggression, which involves alienating the victim from peers through gossip or ostracism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sugimori Shinkichi |year=2012 |url=http://www.nippon.com/en/currents/d00054/|title=Anatomy of Japanese Bullying|work=nippon.com|accessdate=January 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of attack can be easily launched via texting or other online activities. One 19-year-old Japanese student was targeted by classmates who posted his photo online, insulted him constantly, and asked him to die. Because of the constant harassment, he did attempt suicide twice. Even when he quit school, the attacks did not stop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/World/Cyber-bullying-bedevils-Japan/2007/11/12/1194766557213.html|title=Cyber bullying bedevils Japan|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=January 5, 2015|date=2007-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyberbullying can cause serious psychological impact to the victims. They often feel anxious, nervous, tired, and depressed. Other examples of negative psychological trauma include losing confidence as a result being socially isolated from their schoolmates or friends. Psychological problems can also show up in the form of headaches, skin problems, abdominal pain, sleep problems, bed-wetting, and crying.

==== 2000 ====
A survey by the Crimes Against Children Research Center at the [[University of New Hampshire]] in 2000 found that 6% of the young people in the survey had experienced some form of harassment, including threats and negative rumors, and 2% had suffered distressing harassment.&lt;ref name=ccrc&gt;Finkelhor, D., Mitchell, K.J., &amp; Wolak, J.

* 42% of children had been bullied online. One in four had experienced it more than once.
* 35% had been threatened online. Nearly one in five had experienced it more than once.
* 21% had received mean or threatening e-mails or other messages.
* 58% admitted that someone had said hurtful things to them online. More than four out of ten said this had happened more than once.
* 58% had not told their parents or an adult about something hurtful that had happened to them online.

The Youth Internet Safety Survey-2, conducted by the Crimes Against Children Research Center at the [[University of New Hampshire]] in 2005, found that 9% of the young people in the survey had experienced some form of harassment.&lt;ref name=ccrc2&gt;Wolak, J., Mitchell, K.J., &amp; Finkelhor, D.

Hinduja and Patchin completed a study in the summer of 2005 of approximately 1,500 Internet-using adolescents and found that over one-third of youth reported being victimized online, and over 16% of respondents admitted to cyberbullying others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statistics on Bullying |url=http://district.seattleschools.org/modules/groups/homepagefiles/cms/1583136/File/Departmental%20Content/cyber%20bullying/lesson%202/cbms_2_tr1.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004224632/http://district.seattleschools.org/modules/groups/homepagefiles/cms/1583136/File/Departmental%20Content/cyber%20bullying/lesson%202/cbms_2_tr1.pdf |archivedate=October 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While most of the instances of cyberbullying involved relatively minor behavior (41% were disrespected, 19% were called names), over 12% were physically threatened and about 5% were scared for their safety. Notably, fewer than 15% of victims told an adult about the incident.&lt;ref name="patchin1" /&gt; Additional research by Hinduja and Patchin in 2007&lt;ref name="patchin2"&gt;Hinduja, S. &amp; Patchin, J.

The authors acknowledge that both of these studies provide only preliminary information about the nature and consequences of online bullying, due to the methodological challenges associated with an online survey.

Almost three-quarters (73%) stated that they knew the bully, while 26% stated that the offender was a stranger. 10% of responders indicated that another person had taken a picture and/or video of them via a [[camera phone|cellular phone camera]], consequently making them feel uncomfortable, embarrassed, or threatened. Many youths are not comfortable telling an authority figure about their cyberbullying [[victimization]] for fear their access to technology will be taken from them; while 24% and 14% told a parent or teacher respectively, 28% did not tell anyone, and 41% told a friend.&lt;ref name=survey /&gt;

In 2007, Debbie Heimowitz, a [[Stanford University]] master's student, created ''[[Adina's Deck]]'', a film based on Stanford-accredited research. She worked in focus groups for ten weeks in three schools to learn about the problem of cyberbullying in northern California. The findings determined that over 60% of students had been cyberbullied and were victims of cyberbullying. The film is now being used in classrooms nationwide as it was designed around learning goals pertaining to problems that students had understanding the topic. The middle school of [[Suicide of Megan Meier|Megan Meier]] is reportedly using the film as a solution to the crisis in their town.

In 2008, researchers Sameer Hinduja ([[Florida Atlantic University]]) and Justin Patchin ([[University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire]]) published a book on cyberbullying that summarized the current state of cyberbullying research (''Bullying Beyond the Schoolyard: Preventing and Responding to Cyberbullying'').&lt;ref name=patchin3&gt;{{cite book | last= Hinduja | first = S. |author2=Patchin, J.

They also reported findings from a then-recent study of cyberbullying. In a random sample of approximately 2000 middle-school students from a large school district in the southern United States, about 10% of respondents reported being cyberbullied in the previous 30 days while over 17% reported having been cyberbullied at least once in their lifetime.&lt;ref name="patchin3" /&gt; While these rates are slightly lower than some of the findings from their previous research, Hinduja and Patchin pointed out that the earlier studies were predominantly conducted among older adolescents and Internet samples.

In 2014, Mehari, Farrell, and Le published a study that focused on the literature on cyberbullying among adolescents. They found that researchers have generally assumed that cyberbullying is distinct from aggression perpetrated in person. Mehari et al. suggest that the media through which aggression is perpetrated may be best conceptualized as a new classification of aggression, rather than considering cyberbullying as a distinct counterpart to existing forms of aggression. They suggest that future research on cyberbullying should be considered within the context of theoretical and empirical knowledge of aggression in adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://scholarscompass.vcu.edu/psyc_pubs/15/|title = Cyberbullying among adolescents: Measures in search of a construct|last = Mehari|first = Krista|date = 2014|journal = Psychology of Violence|doi = 10.1037/a0037521|pmid = |access-date = March 24, 2015|last2 = Farrell|first2 = Albert|last3 = Le|first3 = Anh-Thuy|volume=4|issue = 4|pages=399–415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyberbullying on social media has usually been student-to-student, but recently, students have been cyberbullying their teachers. High school students in Colorado created a Twitter site that bullies teachers. This ranges from obscenities to false accusations of inappropriate actions with students.&lt;ref name=durangoherald20151029&gt;{{cite web|title = 9-R students create teacher-bashing tweets|url = http://www.durangoherald.com/article/20151029/NEWS01/151029500/-1/news01&amp;source=RSS|website = The Durango Herald|date=29 October 2015|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender ===
Research conducted to try and determine differences in cyber bullying patterns comparing male to female and ages of each are relatively inconclusive.

Comparatively, the review of articles indicates that age differences have some indicators of cyber bullying; increasing age indicates increasing bullying behaviors.  Gender differences have mixed results but one finding indicated that younger females(10 or 11) and older males(13+) tend to engage in cyber bullying behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;A meta-analysis of sex differences in cyber-bullying behavior: The moderating role of age.

CNET News, by Stefanie Olsen, June 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawmakers are seeking to address cyberbullying with new legislation because there is currently no specific law on the books that deals with it. A fairly new federal cyberstalking law might address such acts, according to [[Parry Aftab]], but no one has been prosecuted under it yet. The proposed federal law would make it illegal to use electronic means to "coerce, intimidate, harass or cause other substantial emotional distress."

In August 2008, the California state legislature passed one of the first laws in the country to deal directly with cyberbullying. Assembly Bill 86 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fbusd.us/vnews/display.v/ART/4cd41cda558da%3C|title=Fort Bragg USD|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; gives school administrators the authority to discipline students for bullying, offline or online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centerdigitaled.com/edtech/Education-Legislation-Cyber-Bullying.html |title=Education Legislation: Cyber-Bullying |publisher=Centerdigitaled.com |date=2009-03-16 |accessdate=2016-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law took effect on January 1, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/31/AR2008123103067.html|title=States Passing Laws to Combat Cyber-Bullying&amp;nbsp;— washingtonpost.com|work=The Washington Post |accessdate=January 2, 2009|last=Surdin|first=Ashley | date=January 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A law in New York's Albany County that criminalized cyberbullying was struck down as unconstitutional by the [[New York Court of Appeals]] in ''[[People v. Marquan M.]]''

A recent{{when|date=December 2017}} ruling first seen in the UK determined that it is possible for an [[Internet service provider]] (ISP) to be liable for the content of the sites it hosts, setting a precedent that any ISP should treat a notice of complaint seriously and investigate it immediately.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.out-law.com/page-5624 International IT and e-commerce legal info].

While some states have laws that require schools to mediate cyberbullying conflicts, several states have been sued on First Amendment grounds for doing so. By examining the decisions of three such lawsuits heard in lower courts, Alvin J. Primack and Kevin A. Johnson argued that current First Amendment doctrine, particularly the case of ''Morse v. Frederick'' (2007), may offer interpretive resources for justifying administrative reach to some online digital speech. They concluded, "[w]ithout clearer standards, school administrators are likely to feel constrained and err on the side of inaction."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Primack|first=Alvin J.|last2=Johnson|first2=Kevin A.|date=Spring 2017|title=Student cyberbullying inside the digital schoolhouse gate: Toward a standard for determining where a "School" is|journal=First Amendment Studies|volume=51.1|pages=30–48|doi=10.1080/21689725.2016.1278177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European Union ===

Since the 1990s, the United Kingdom and other European countries have been working to solve [[workplace bullying]] since there is no legislation regulating cyberbullying. The pervasive nature of technology has made the act of bullying online much easier.&lt;ref name=european-perspective&gt;{{cite web|title=Bullying, Harassment and Stress in the Workplace — A European Perspective|url=http://www.internationallaborlaw.com/files/2013/01/Bullying-Harassment-and-Stress-in-the-workplace-A-European-Perspective.pdf|publisher=  Proskauer|accessdate=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 24-hour internet connection gives bullies a neverending opportunity to find and bully victims. Employers in the European Union have more legal responsibility to their employees than do those in other countries. Since employers do not have the ability to fire or hire an employee at will like in the United States, employers in Europe are held to a high standard in how their employees are treated.

In 2007, the European Union developed the Framework Agreement on Harassment and Violence at Work, a law that prevents bullying occurring in the workplace and holds employers accountable for providing fair working conditions.&lt;ref name=european-perspective /&gt; The law defines the responsibilities of an employer such as protecting his or her employees from bullies in a work environment and the psychological pain a victim faces from bullies during business hours. Lawyers pursuing cyberbullying cases use the Ordinance on Victimization at Work law, since there are not any laws specifically condemning cyberbullying.&lt;ref name=european-perspective /&gt;

In 1993, Sweden was the first European Union country to have a law against cyberbullying. The Ordinance on Victimization at Work protected victims from "recurrent reprehensible or distinctly negative actions which are directed which are directed against individual employees in an offensive manner and can result in those employees being placed outside the workplace community".&lt;ref name=european-perspective /&gt;

In 2002, France passed the Social Modernization Law, which added consequences to the French Labor Code for cyberbullying such as holding employers accountable for their involvement in harassment.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} The legislation defines "moral harassment" as "repeated acts leading to a
deterioration of the working conditions and that are likely to harm the dignity, the physical or
psychological heath of the victim or his professional career."&lt;ref name=european-perspective /&gt;

The United Kingdom does not have anti-bullying legislation. However, it does have the Protection From Harassment Act, an anti-stalking law.&lt;ref name=european-perspective /&gt; U.K. courts have used this legislation in bullying cases.

[[File:Take A Stand Against Cyberbullying.png|thumb|This image portrays the support and awareness that many anti-cyberbullying campaigns have in some countries around the world.]]
The United States and some other countries have more extensive legislation on cyberbullying than the European Union. Cyberbullying incidents on social media are widespread and have increased drastically in number.&lt;ref name=european-perspective /&gt; However, the process of getting a claim against a bully is not an easy one because of the victim's need to provide sufficient evidence to prove the existence of bullying.

As of mid-2015, countries in the European Union like the United Kingdom are in the process of creating laws specially related to cyberbullying. Since the process takes time, the government is supporting school programs to promote internet safety with the help of teachers and parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statutory guidance – Keeping children safe in education|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/keeping-children-safe-in-education--2|website=GOV.UK|publisher=Department for Education|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This will allow the government to take the time it needs to create the cyberbullying laws while helping safeguard students from cyberbullying as much as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New guidelines to help industry promote internet safety|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-guidelines-to-help-industry-promote-internet-safety|website=GOV.UK|publisher=Department for Education &amp; Tim Loughton|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Research on preventative legislation ===
{{Original research section|date=May 2018}}

Researchers suggest that programs be put in place for prevention of cyberbullying. These programs would be incorporated into school curricula and would include online safety and instruction on how to use the Internet properly.&lt;ref name= von&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Von Marees | first1 = N. | last2 = Petermann | first2 = F. | year = 2012 | title = Cyberbullying: An increasing challenge for schools | url = | journal = School Psychology International | volume = 33 | issue = 5| page = 476 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This could teach the victim proper methods of potentially avoiding the cyberbully, such as blocking messages or increasing the security of their computer.&lt;ref name= von /&gt;

Even in a perfect world, no crime can be stopped fully. That is why it is suggested that within this prevention method, effective coping strategies should be introduced and adopted. As with any crime, people learn to cope with what has happened. People can adopt coping strategies to combat future cyberbullying. Coping strategies may include social support groups composed of victims of cyberbullying,&lt;ref name= von /&gt; which could allow students to share their stories, and remove the feeling of being alone.

Teachers should be involved in all prevention educational models, as they are essentially the "police" of the classroom. Most cyberbullying often goes unreported as the victim feels nothing can be done to help in their current situation.&lt;ref name= von /&gt; However, if given the proper tools with preventative measures and more power in the classroom, teachers can be of assistance. If the parent, teacher, and victim can work together, solutions may be found.&lt;ref name= von /&gt;

There have been many legislative attempts to facilitate the control of bullying and cyberbullying. Some existing legislation is incorrectly thought to be tied to bullying and cyberbullying (including terms such as "libel" and "slander"). The problem is that the existing legislation does not directly apply to bullying, nor define it as its own criminal behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Smyth, S. M. (2010). Cybercrime in Canadian criminal law. (pp. 105–122). Toronto, ON: Carswell.&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-cyberbullying advocates have even expressed concern about the broad scope of some of the bills attempted to be passed.&lt;ref name= walt&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Walther | first1 = B | year = 2012 | title = Cyberbullying: Holding grownups liable for negligent entrustment | url = | journal = Houston Law Review | volume = 49 | issue = 2| pages = 531–562 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, attempts have been made to pass legislation against cyberbullying. Few states attempted to pass broad sanctions in an effort to prohibit cyberbullying. Problems include how to define cyberbullying and cyberstalking, and, if charges are pressed, whether this violates the bully's freedom of speech.&lt;ref name= walt /&gt; B. Walther said that "Illinois is the only state to criminalize 'electronic communication(s) sent for the purpose of harassing another person' when the activity takes place outside a public school setting." This was criticized for infringement on freedom of speech.&lt;ref name= walt /&gt;

'Cyberbullying' is the use of technology to bully a person, or threatening an individual online. Cyberbullying has become more common nowadays because of all the technology that children have access to. The most common apps that teenagers use to cyberbully are Instagram, Twitter, and Snapchat. Cyberbullying has become harder to stop because parents and teachers are unaware of when and where it is happening. Online bullying has become a bigger problem and 33% of all youth has been a victim of cyberbullying. Teens will say awful things to one another online and what they do not realize is that once it is said and published online it will not go away. Home used to be a safe place for teens but now a child is still within reach of becoming a victim of cyberbullying- whether it is through YouTube, Ask.fm, or a text message.

Preventing a child from being cyberbullied is hard, but now they are working to form laws to help stop the issue from getting worse than it already is. They have created movies such as 'Cyberbully' by Charles Biname and 'The Duff' by Ari Sandel for teenagers to watch and see how cyberbullying can affect an individual. Parents can become more involved in their children's lives when it comes to social media to help prevent their child from being bullied. Children that are victims of this problem feel they can not go to an adult for help because they may feel embarrassed by the situation. Bullying online will not only hurt the teenager emotionally but there is also a risk of the child hurting themselves physically as well. Suicide has become the 3rd leading cause of death among persons from 10 to 24 years of age and online bullying takes a big part in that.

Being able to tell if a child is being hurt from this issue can be tough, but there are certain things that a child will do that should give a red flag that they are being bullied. Such as if they post a video or a picture on Instagram with comments like "Am I ugly? Someone said I was but is it true?" or "Am I cute?". A cyberbully could have said nasty words to that child and the victim could be looking for compliments. If the victim is always online wondering when the bully will strike next that could also be a sign. Being an active parent in their children's lives will make a difference on whether your child is experiencing online bullying or not. Also bringing police involved in the case will be a problem solver too.

== Harmful effects ==
Research has demonstrated a number of serious consequences of cyberbullying victimization.&lt;ref name="patchin1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="patchin2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="patchin3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="patchin" /&gt; Victims may have lower self-esteem, increased suicidal ideation, and a variety of emotional responses, including being scared, frustrated, angry, and depressed.&lt;ref name="patchin3" /&gt; Cyberbullying may be more harmful than traditional bullying, because there is no escaping it.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://demetrioskritikos.com/cyber-bullying/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 25, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150813032718/http://demetrioskritikos.com/cyber-bullying/ |archivedate=August 13, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most damaging effects is that a victim begins to avoid friends and activities, which is often the very intention of the bully.

Cyberbullying campaigns are sometimes so damaging that victims have committed suicide. There are at least four examples in the United States in which cyberbullying has been linked to the suicide of a teenager.&lt;ref name="patchin3" /&gt; The [[suicide of Megan Meier]] is a recent example that led to the conviction of the adult perpetrator of the attacks. Holly Grogan committed suicide by jumping off a 30-foot bridge near Gloucester in the UK. It was reported that a number of her schoolmates had posted a number of hateful messages on her Facebook page.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=High school teachers' perceptions of cyberbullying prevention and intervention strategies|journal=Psychology in the Schools|volume=49|issue=4|page=352|doi=10.1002/pits.21603|year=2012|last1=Stauffer|first1=Sterling|last2=Heath|first2=Melissa Allen|last3=Coyne|first3=Sarah Marie|last4=Ferrin|first4=Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lucie Russell, director of campaigns, policy and participation at youth mental health charity Young Minds, young people who suffer from [[mental disorder]]s are vulnerable to cyberbullying as they are sometimes unable to shrug it off:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When someone says nasty things healthy people can filter that out, they're able to put a block between that and their self-esteem. But mentally unwell people don't have the strength and the self-esteem to do that, to separate it, and so it gets compiled with everything else. To them, it becomes the absolute truth – there's no filter, there's no block. That person will take that on, take it as fact.&lt;ref name="Guardian8813"&gt;{{cite news|title = Cyberbullying websites should be boycotted, says Cameron: Prime minister calls for website operators to 'step up to the plate', following death of 14-year-old Hannah Smith|newspaper = The Guardian|date = 8 August 2013|author = Alexandra Topping|author2 = Ellen Coyne and agencies}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Social media has allowed bullies to disconnect from the impact they may be having on others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carlyleobserver.com/article/20120427/CARLYLE0101/304279977/-1/carlyle/cyber-bullying-and-popular-culture|title=Cyber-bullying and popular culture|author=Kelly Running|work=Carlyle Observer|accessdate=January 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intimidation, emotional damage, and suicide ===
According to the Cyberbullying Research Center, "there have been several high‐profile cases involving teenagers taking their own lives in part because of being harassed and mistreated over the Internet, a phenomenon we have termed cyberbullicide – suicide indirectly or directly influenced by experiences with online aggression."

Cyberbullying is an intense form of psychological abuse, whose victims are more than twice as likely to suffer from mental disorders compared to traditional bullying.&lt;ref name="cyberthreat"&gt;{{cite journal | journal=[[Ideas and Discoveries (magazine)|Ideas and Discoveries]] |title=Cyberthreat: How to protect yourself from online bullying | year=2011 | page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reluctance youth have in telling an authority figure about instances of cyberbullying has led to fatal outcomes. At least three children between the ages of 12 and 13 have committed suicide due to depression brought on by cyberbullying, according to reports by ''USA Today'' and the ''Baltimore Examiner''. These include the [[suicide of Ryan Halligan]] and the [[suicide of Megan Meier]], the latter of which resulted in ''[[United States v. Lori Drew]]''. Teen suicides tied to cyberbullying have recently become more prevalent. Rebecca Ann Sedwick committed suicide after being terrorized through mobile applications such as [[Ask.fm]], [[Kik Messenger]] and [[Voxer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Alvarez|first=Lizette|title=Girl's Suicide Points to Rise in Apps Used by Cyberbullies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/14/us/suicide-of-girl-after-bullying-raises-worries-on-web-sites.html?_r=0|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== On youth and teenagers ===
The effects of cyberbullying vary, but research illustrates that cyberbullying adversely affects youth to a higher degree than adolescents and adults. Youth are more likely to suffer since they are still growing mentally and physically.&lt;ref name="Effects of Bullying"&gt;{{cite web|title=Effects of Bullying|url=http://www.stopbullying.gov/at-risk/effects/|website=StopBullying.gov|publisher=U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services|accessdate=18 November 2015|date=29 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jennifer N. Caudle, a certified family physician, says, "Kids that are bullied are likely to experience anxiety, depression, loneliness, unhappiness and poor sleep".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cyber-Bullying and its Effect on our Youth|url=http://www.osteopathic.org/osteopathic-health/about-your-health/health-conditions-library/general-health/Pages/cyber-bullying.aspx|website=American Osteopathic Association|publisher=American Osteopathic Association|accessdate=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Against Cyberbullying.png|thumb|This image shows different aspects of cyberbullying that can take place on the internet which puts more emotional strain on the younger children and teenage who experience cyberbullying.]]

Most of the time cyberbullying goes unnoticed; the younger generation hides their bullying from anyone that can help to prevent the bullying from occurring and from getting worse. Between 20% and 40% of adolescents are victims of cyberbullying worldwide.&lt;ref name="Effects of Bullying" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deniz|first1=Metin|title=A Study on Primary School Students' Being Cyber Bullies and Victims According to Gender, Grade, and Socioeconomic Status|journal=Croatian Journal of Education|date=7 July 2015|volume=17|issue=3|pages=659–680|doi=10.15516/cje.v17i3.835}}&lt;/ref&gt; The youth slowly change their behaviors and actions so they become more withdrawn and quiet, but this may go unnoticed since the change is subtle.&lt;ref name="Effects of Bullying" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Metin Deniz believes cyberbullying will "become a serious problem in the future with an increase in the Internet and mobile phone usage among young people".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

If preventive actions are not taken against cyberbullying, younger children in addition to teenagers will feel more lonely and depressed along with having significant changes in their eating and sleeping patterns as well as loss of interest in their normal activities. These changes will affect their growth and development into adulthood.&lt;ref name="Effects of Bullying" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Younger children and teenagers are 76.2% less likely to display suicidal behaviors and thoughts, but are still at risk depending on other factors such as mental health status, home care, and relationships with others.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; The risk of suicide increases by 35% to 45% when victims do not have any support from anyone in their life, and cyberbullying amplifies the situation.&lt;ref name="Effects of Bullying" /&gt;

Young people seem particularly vulnerable to the effects of cyberbullying through [[anonymous social media]], perhaps because adolescents are attracted to these platforms as a means of seeking validation from their peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Odd Girl Out|last=Simmons|first=Rachel|publisher=Mariner Books|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abuse on these platforms, such as [[ASKfm]], [[Yik Yak]] and [[Sarahah]], can be particularly keenly felt by young people, leading to issues of loss of confidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Binns|first=Amy|date=2013|title=Facebook's Ugly Sisters: Anonymity and abuse on Formspring and Ask.fm|url=http://clok.uclan.ac.uk/8378/|journal=Media Education Research Journal|volume=4 | issue = 1 |page=27|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been a number of suicides related to bullying on these platforms in the US&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/family-friends-shocked-at-cyberposts-after-teen-s-death-1.1827393|title=Family and Friends shocked at cyberposts after teen's death|last=Polsky|first=Carol|date=23 March 2010|website=Newsday|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/social-media/8653867/Teenager-in-rail-suicide-was-sent-abusive-message-on-social-networking-site.html|title=Teenager in rail suicide was sent abusive message on social networking site|last=|first=|date=22 July 2011|work=The Telegraph|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awareness ==

=== Campaigns ===

==== International ====
The Cybersmile Foundation is a cyberbullying charity committed to tackling all forms of [[online bullying]], abuse, and hate campaigns. It was founded in 2010 in response to the increasing number of cyberbullying related incidents of [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[eating disorder]]s, social isolation, [[self-harm]] and suicides devastating lives around the world. Cybersmile provides support to victims and their friends and families through social media interaction, email and helpline support. They also run an annual event, [[Stop Cyberbullying Day]], to draw attention to the issue.

==== Spain ====
Multiple non-profit organizations fight cyberbullying and cyberstalking. They advise victims, provide awareness campaigns, and report offenses to the police. These NGOs include the ''Protégeles'', ''PantallasAmigas'', ''[[Foundation Alia2]]'', the non-profit initiative ''Actúa Contra el Ciberacoso'', the National Communications Technology Institute (INTECO), the Agency of Internet quality, the ''Agencia Española de Protección de Datos'', the ''Oficina de Seguridad del Internauta'', the Spanish Internet users' Association, the Internauts' Association, and the Spanish Association of Mothers and Parents Internauts. The government of [[Castile and León]] has also created a ''Plan de Prevención del Ciberacoso y Promoción de la Navegación Segura en Centro Escolares'', and the government of the [[Canary Islands]] has created a portal on the phenomenon called ''Viveinternet''.

==== United States ====
In March 2007, the Advertising Council in the United States, in partnership with the National Crime Prevention Council, U.S. Department of Justice, and Crime Prevention Coalition of America, joined to announce the launch of a new [[public service advertising]] campaign designed to educate preteens and teens about how they can play a role in ending cyberbullying.

As of 2008, the [[Boy Scouts of America]]'s 2008 edition of ''[[Boy Scout Handbook|The Boy Scout Handbook]]'' addresses how to deal with online bullying. A new [[Ranks in the Boy Scouts of America#First Class|First Class]] rank requirements adds: "Describe the three things you should avoid doing related to use of the Internet. Describe a cyberbully and how you should respond to one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.usscouts.org/advance/boyscout/changes/bsrank4-08.asp|publisher=US Scout Service Project|title=First Class Rank Requirements|accessdate=August 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.nbcnews.com/id/22576610/ns/health-childrens_health/t/always-be-prepared-battle-bullies/#.VlVoUcovPO0|publisher = NBC News|title = Always be prepared to battle bullies|accessdate = |date = 2008-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, [[KTTV]] Fox 11 News in Los Angeles put out a report about organized cyberbullying on sites like [[Stickam]] by people who call themselves "[[Anonymous (group)|/b/rothas]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai09cWlyPrQ|publisher = Fox 11|title = Leelila Strogov – Fox 11 LA – Cyber Bullies|accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The site had put out a report on July 26, 2007, about a subject that partly featured cyberbullying, titled "Hackers on Steroids".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNO6G4ApJQY|publisher = Fox Television Stations, Inc.|title = FOX 11 Investigates: 'Anonymous'|accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 2, 2008, parents, teens, teachers, and Internet executives came together at Wired Safety's International Stop Cyberbullying Conference, a two-day gathering in White Plains, New York and New York City. Executives from Facebook, [[Verizon]], MySpace, [[Microsoft]], and many others talked with hundreds about how to better protect themselves and their personal reputations, children and businesses from online harassment. Sponsors of the conference included [[McAfee]], [[AOL]], [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], [[Procter &amp; Gamble]], [[Girl Scouts of the USA]], WiredTrust, Children's Safety Research and Innovation Centre, and KidZui.com. Cyberharassment versus cyberbullying was a forefront topic, where age makes a difference; abusive internet behavior by adults with the repeated clear intent to harm, ridicule or damage a person or business was classified as [[stalking]] harassment, versus bullying by teens and young adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith |first=Skylar |url=http://www.dailytitan.com/2009/10/cal-state-fullerton-student-causes-crash/comment-page-46/ |title=2 dead after head-on collision with CSUF student |publisher=Dailytitan.com |date= 2009-10-26|accessdate=2016-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An organized movement to make [[revenge porn]] illegal began in August 2012: End Revenge Porn.&lt;ref name="endrevengeporn.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.endrevengeporn.org/|title=End Revenge Porn}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently revenge porn is only illegal in two states, but the demand for its criminalization is on the rise as digital technology has increased in the past few generations.  The organization seeks to provide support for victims, educate the public, and gain activist support to bring new legislation before the United States Government.&lt;ref name="endrevengeporn.org" /&gt;

In 2006, PACER.org created a week-long event that was held once a year in October. Today, the campaign is a month-long event and is now known as the National Bullying Prevention Awareness Month.&lt;ref&gt;Hertzog, J.
(2015, October 5). October is National Bullying Prevention Awareness
Month. Retrieved November 3, 2015, from http://www.stopbullying.gov/blog/2015/10/05/october-national-bullying-prevention-awareness-month&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Canada ====
Originating in Canada, [[Anti-Bullying Day]] is a day of celebration for those who choose to participate wearing a symbol of colours (pink, blue or purple) as a stance against bullying.  A British Columbia teacher founded the Stop A Bully movement, which uses pink wristbands to represent the wearer's stance to stop bullying.

Pink Shirt Day was inspired by David Shepherd and Travis Price. Their high school friends organized a protest in sympathy for a Grade 9 boy who was bullied for wearing a pink shirt. Their stance from wearing pink has been a huge inspiration in the Great Vancouver Mainland. "We know that victims of bullying, witnesses of bullying and bullies themselves all experience the very real and long term negative impacts of bullying regardless of its forms – physical, verbal, written, or on-line (cyberbullying)".

ERASE (Expect Respect and A Safe Education) is an initiative started by the province of British Columbia to foster safe schools and prevent bullying. It builds on already-effective programs set up by the provincial government to ensure consistent policies and practices regarding the prevention of bullying.

=== Community support ===
A number of organizations are in coalition to provide awareness, protection and recourse for this escalating problem. Some aim to inform and provide measures to avoid as well as effectively terminate cyberbullying and cyberharassment. Anti-bullying charity [[Act Against Bullying]] launched the CyberKind campaign in August 2009 to promote positive internet usage.

In 2007, YouTube introduced the first Anti-Bullying Channel for youth (BeatBullying), using the assistance of celebrities to tackle the problem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/7098978.stm YouTube tackles bullying online] BBC News, November 19, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, a 17-year-old girl named Alexis Skye Pilkington was found dead in her room by her parents. Her parents claimed that after repeated cyberbullying, she was driven to suicide. Shortly after her death, attacks resumed. Members of [[eBaums World]] began to [[Troll (Internet)|troll]] teens' memorial pages on [[Facebook]], with the comments including expressions of pleasure over the death, with pictures of what seemed to be a banana as their profile pictures. Family and friends of the deceased teen responded by creating Facebook groups denouncing cyberbullying and trolling, with logos of bananas behind a red circle with a diagonal line through it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Salazar|first=Cristian|title=Alexis Pilkington Facebook Horror: Cyber Bullies Harass Teen Even After Suicide|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/24/alexis-pilkington-faceboo_n_512482.html|accessdate=22 October 2012|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response and partnership to the 2011 film ''[[Bully (2011 film)|Bully]]'', a grassroots effort to stop cyberbullying called the Bully Project was created. Their goal is to start "a national movement to stop bullying that is transforming children's lives and changing a culture of bullying into one of empathy and action."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebullyproject.com/|title=The BULLY Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Declaration of Principles on Equality''' reflects a moral and professional consensus among [[human rights]] and [[Egalitarianism|equality]] experts done in December 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Petrova, D., ‘The Declaration of Principles on Equality: A Contribution to International Human Rights Law’, Equal Rights Review, Volume 2, December 2008, pp58-72.&lt;/ref&gt; It contains 27 principles that establish a new [[paradigm]] on equality, drawing on established and emerging principles of [[international law]].&lt;ref&gt;Declaration of Principles of Equality, Equal Rights Trust, October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described by the High Court of Delhi as reflecting the ‘current international understanding of Principles on Equality.’&lt;ref&gt;Naz Foundation v. Government of NCT of Delhi and Others, WP(C) No.7455/2001 at 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The need to formulate general [[Legal doctrine|legal principles]] on equality was defined on the basis of (i) acknowledging the pervasiveness of [[discrimination]] and the weaknesses in the protection of the right to equality at both international and national levels, (ii) the absence of comprehensive equality legislation in many countries around the world and the recognition that such legislation is necessary to give effect to states’ obligations under [[international human rights law|international]] and [[regional human rights regimes|regional human rights law]]; (iii) the disparities and inconsistencies in approaches to discrimination and equality in the different frameworks of the UN, EU, the Council of Europe, various national jurisdictions, etc. which meant that virtually none of the key concepts of equality law had universally accepted definitions; (iv) the fragmentation of the [[anti-discrimination law|anti-discrimination]] struggle, whereby different status/identity groups are enmeshed in [[identity politics]] and are unable to follow a universal human rights approach to equality and develop [[solidarity]] with other [[disadvantaged]] groups.

The Principles on Equality were agreed by a group of experts in several stages of consultations. They were discussed at a conference entitled ‘Principles on Equality and the Development of Legal Standards on Equality’ organised by The Equal Rights Trust (ERT) on 3–5 April 2008 in London. Participants of different backgrounds, including academics, legal practitioners and [[human rights activist]]s from all regions of the world took part in this event. Participants debated a version of the draft that had incorporated their comments on an earlier document. They subsequently contributed comments. A number of further experts participated in various stages of drafting and deliberation.

ERT launched the Declaration of Principles on Equality on 21 October 2008, in London. The document was signed initially by 128 experts from 44 countries, and subsequently by hundreds of others. It establishes, for the first time, general legal principles on equality as a basic human right. The Declaration contains 27 principles on which national equality legislation and policies should be based. The principles formulated and agreed by the experts through a two-year-long consultative process are based on concepts and jurisprudence developed in international, regional and national legal contexts. The Declaration is intended to assist efforts of legislators, the judiciary, civil society organisations and anyone else involved in combating discrimination and promoting equality, in particular through developing effective equality legislation and policies.

The legal basis of the 27 Principles is found (i) in the [[United Nations Charter|Charter of the United Nations]]&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Charter, 1 UNTS XVI, entered into force 24 October 1945.&lt;/ref&gt; which recognises the inherent dignity and worth and the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family as the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world; (ii) Article 1 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]&lt;ref&gt;Universal Declaration on Human Rights, General Assembly resolution 217 A (III), 10 December 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; proclaiming that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights; and common Article 2 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]&lt;ref&gt;International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 999 U.N.T.S. 171, entered into force 23 March 1976&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]];&lt;ref&gt;International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 993 U.N.T.S. 3, entered into force 3 Jan 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; (iii) the recognition, in Article 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, of the right to non-discrimination as an autonomous human right and the correlative obligation of States to realise this right; (iv) a number of provisions in international and regional treaties; (v) non-binding opinions, recommendations, and interpretations by organs of international and regional organisation including the Council of Europe; (vi) jurisprudence of international, regional and national courts related to equality.

==Principles==
Marking a transition from identity politics to a unitary human rights framework on equality, 
the Declaration provides guidance on some of the most complex and controversial issues that arise in any attempt to develop comprehensive equality legislation at the national level. For example, it defines the [[equality before the law|right to equality]], equal treatment, and the right to non-discrimination, and gives a legal definition of [[discrimination]], as well as of the most important types of discrimination (direct, indirect, harassment, discrimination by association and by perception); through these, it provides guidance on the question of how the right to non-discrimination relates to the right to equality. The Declaration also provides general principles on how to approach the question of the grounds on which discrimination must be prohibited: should the right to non-discrimination apply only to a closed list of grounds? Are new grounds emerging that should require equal pro-tection? Is there a hierarchy of the ground of discrimination, and what should be the approach to defining exceptions?

Having taken account of the existing notions of affirmative action, positive action, special measures and positive measures in various legal frameworks, the Declaration further formulates principles on which to base the law on positive action and positive duties. Positive action does not constitute discrimination as long as the difference in treatment is aimed at achieving full and effective equality and the means adopted are proportionate to that aim. Positive ac¬tion measures are not defined as an exception to the principle of equal treatment but as part of its implementation. States have a positive duty to promote equality.

The definition of the right to non-discrimination in Principle 4 as a free-standing right is meant in two senses: (i) in the sense that it is a separate right, which can be violated even if a related right is not: for example, a person’s right to non-discrimination in the enjoyment of the right to education may be violated, while no breach of her right to education has been found; this understanding is well established in the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human rights; (ii) in the sense of an autonomous right, not related to any other right set forth by law. In this second sense, the free-standing status of the right to non-discrimination means that this right does not depend on whether another legal right actually exists. This is the approach followed in defining discrimination in the European Union equality Directives, as well as in the national legislation of a number of the EU member states.

The Declaration further contains principles on equality related to: the relationship between discrimination and violence; the scope of application of the right to equality (“all areas of activity regulated by law”); the personal scope: who are the right-holders, e.g. whether legal persons can claim the right as well as individuals and groups; the definition of duty-bearers; the content of the duty to give effect to the right to equality; the obligations regarding multiple discrimination; the duty of accommodating difference (defining the concept of reasonable accommodation); the relationship between the right to equality and poverty; the specificity of equality legislation; the duty to ensure participation in developing law and policies implementing the right to equality; and the duty to provide education related to equality.

Another set of principles are related to enforcement of the right to equality and define access to justice in equality law; victimisation; standing rules; evidence and proof in adjudicating equality rights; remedies and sanctions; the role of specialised bodies; and the duty to gather and disseminate information including statistics as part of the enforcement of the right to equality. Finally, the Declaration contains principles prohibiting regressive interpretation and derogations from the right to equality.

==Limitations==
The Declaration of Principles on Equality, as its title indicates, provides only the most general and abstract synthesis of legal standards on equality. Those who would be looking for more detailed guidance on specific issues would be disappointed. But the Declaration’s significance consists in the fact that it documents a degree of moral and professional consensus among global experts at the most fundamental level, reflecting both basic values shared by the signatories and a negotiated agreement on exactly how to express these values in the form and the language of universal legal principles. As an established common ground, the Declaration can therefore serve as the basis for further elaboration of specific legal standards related to equality issues.

==Recent developments==
On 25 November 2011, the Standing Committee of the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] (PACE) adopted a [http://assembly.coe.int/ASP/Doc/ATListingDetails_E.asp?ATID=11380 Resolution and a Recommendation on “The Declaration of Principles on Equality and the Activities of the Council of Europe”] at its meeting in Edinburgh, UK, welcoming and endorsing the Declaration.&lt;ref&gt;REC 1986 (2011) 25/11/2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Resolution, for the adoption of which a simple majority was necessary, and the Recommendation, which required a qualified majority of two thirds, were voted on during the session of the Standing Committee under the UK Chairmanship of the Council of Europe in Edinburgh. The Standing Committee acts on behalf of PACE when the latter is not in session, and its Resolutions and Recommendations have identical legal status with those of the full assembly.

In the Resolution, the Parliamentary Assembly welcomes the Declaration of Principles on Equality and “calls on member states to take into account the principles contained in the Declaration when adopting equality and non-discrimination legislation and policies”.

In the Recommendation, which is addressed to the [[Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe|Committee of Ministers]], the highest executive authority of the Council of Europe:

“1. Referring to its Resolution on the Declaration of Principles on Equality and activities of the Council of Europe, the Parliamentary Assembly recommends that the Committee of Ministers:

1.1. enhance efforts aimed at speeding up ratification of Protocol No. 12 to the European Convention on Human Rights (ETS No. 5) by the members states which have not yet done so;

1.2. disseminate information on good practices in the implementation of policies aimed at combating discrimination and inequalities;

1.3. ensure that the Declaration is taken into account in the work of the different Council of Europe bodies and expert groups dealing with the issues of equality and non-discrimination;

1.4. promote the Declaration in its dealings with external actors, and in particular with policymakers from the Council of Europe member states;

2. Moreover, recalling the necessity of harmonising the interpretation and implementation of the rights to equality and non-discrimination, the Assembly recommends that the Committee of Ministers:

2.1. step up co-operation with the European Union on the consolidation of standards in the area of non-discrimination and promotion of equality;

2.2. pursue co-operation with other international organisations, in particular the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), the United Nations and its Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, with a view to achieving coherent interpretations of the principles of equality and non-discrimination and the implementation of common policies in the field of combating discrimination and inequalities.”

The Resolution and Recommendation were proposed by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights (CLAHR), whose member Boriss Cilevics (Latvia) was the Rapporteur on the matter. The position of the CLAHR, which was adopted in June 2011 in Oslo, was preceded by a hearing held in Paris on 8 March 2011, at which The Equal Rights Trust provided testimony. The Recommendation will now progress to the Committee of Ministers which should consider a response.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3542">In [[mathematics]], the '''distortion''' is a measure of the amount by which a [[function (mathematics)|function]] from the [[Euclidean plane]] to itself distorts circles to ellipses.  If the distortion of a function is equal to one, then it is [[conformal map|conformal]]; if the distortion is bounded and the function is a [[homeomorphism]], then it is [[quasiconformal mapping|quasiconformal]].  The distortion of a function ƒ of the plane is given by

:&lt;math&gt;H(z,f)  = \limsup_{r\to 0}\frac{\max_{|h|=r}|f(z+h)-f(z)|}{\min_{|h|=r}|f(z+h)-f(z)|}&lt;/math&gt;

which is the limiting eccentricity of the ellipse produced by applying ƒ to small circles centered at&amp;nbsp;''z''.  This geometrical definition is often very difficult to work with, and the necessary analytical features can be extrapolated to the following definition.  A mapping ''ƒ''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;Ω&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; from an open domain in the plane to the plane has finite distortion at a point ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;Ω if ''ƒ'' is in the [[Sobolev space]] W{{su|p=1,1|b=loc}}(Ω,&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian determinant]] J(''x'',ƒ) is locally integrable and does not change sign in Ω, and there is a measurable function ''K''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1 such that

:&lt;math&gt;|Df(x)|^2 \le K(x)|J(x,f)| &lt;/math&gt;

almost everywhere.  Here ''Df'' is the [[weak derivative]] of ƒ, and |''Df''| is the [[Hilbert–Schmidt norm]].

For functions on a higher-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, there are more measures of distortion because there are more than two [[Principal axis theorem|principal axes]] of a symmetric tensor.  The pointwise information is contained in the ''distortion tensor''

:&lt;math&gt;G(x,f) =
\begin{cases}
|J(x,f)^{-2/n}D^Tf(x)Df(x)&amp;\text{if }J(x,f)\not=0\\
I &amp;\text{if }J(x,f)=0.
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

The outer distortion ''K''&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt; and inner distortion ''K''&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt; are defined via the [[Rayleigh quotient]]s

:&lt;math&gt;K_O(x) = \sup_{\xi\not=0}\frac{\langle G(x)\xi,\xi\rangle^{n/2}}{|\xi|^n},\quad K_O(x) = \sup_{\xi\not=0}\frac{\langle G^{-1}(x)\xi,\xi\rangle^{n/2}}{|\xi|^n}.&lt;/math&gt;

The outer distortion can also be characterized by means of an inequality similar to that given in the two-dimensional case.  If Ω is an open set in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, then a function {{nowrap|&amp;fnof; &amp;isin; W{{su|p=1,1|b=loc}}(&amp;Omega;,'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;)}} has finite distortion if its Jacobian is locally integrable and does not change sign, and there is a measurable function ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''O''&lt;/sub&gt; (the outer distortion) such that

:&lt;math&gt;|Df(x)|^n \le K_O(x)|J(x,f)| &lt;/math&gt;

almost everywhere.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10587">In [[quantum mechanics]], '''einselection''', short for ''environment-induced superselection'', is a name coined by [[Wojciech H. Zurek]]&lt;ref name="zurek03"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zurek |first1=W. H. |year=2003 |title=Decoherence, einselection, and the quantum origins of the classical |journal=[[Reviews of Modern Physics]] |volume=75 |issue=3  |pages=715–775 |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.75.715 |bibcode=2003RvMP...75..715Z|arxiv=quant-ph/0105127 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
for a process which is claimed to explain the appearance of [[wavefunction collapse]] and the [[emergence]] of [[classical description]]s of reality from [[quantum description]]s.    In this approach, classicality is described as an emergent property induced in [[open quantum system]]s by their environments. Due to the [[interaction]] with the environment, the vast majority of states in the [[Hilbert space]] of a quantum open system become highly unstable due to entangling interaction with the environment, which in effect monitors selected observables of the system. After a [[decoherence]] time, which for macroscopic objects is typically many orders of magnitude shorter than any other dynamical timescale,&lt;ref name="zurek04"&gt;{{cite arxiv |eprint=quant-ph/0302044|last1= Zurek|first1= Wojciech H.|title= Reduction of the Wavepacket: How Long Does it Take? |year= 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; a generic quantum state decays into an [[density matrix|uncertain state]] which can be decomposed into a mixture of simple [[pointer states]]. In this way the environment induces effective superselection rules. Thus, einselection precludes stable existence of pure superpositions of pointer states.  These '[[pointer states]]' are stable despite environmental interaction. The einselected states lack coherence, and therefore do not exhibit the quantum behaviours of [[quantum entanglement|entanglement]] and [[quantum superposition|superposition]].

Advocates of this approach argue that since only quasi-local, essentially classical states survive the decoherence process, einselection can in many ways explain the emergence of a (seemingly) classical reality in a fundamentally quantum universe (at least to local observers). However, the basic program has been criticized as relying on a circular argument (e.g. [[R. E. Kastner]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kastner |first=R. E. |year=2014 |title=Einselection' of Pointer Observables: the New H-Theorem? |journal=[[Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics]] |volume=48 |pages=56 |url=http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/10757/1/Einselection_and_HThm_Final.pdf|bibcode=2014SHPMP..48...56K |doi=10.1016/j.shpsb.2014.06.004 |arxiv=1406.4126 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). So the question of whether the 'einselection' account can really explain the phenomenon of wave function collapse remains unsettled.

==Definition==
Zurek has defined einselection as follows "[[Quantum decoherence|Decoherence]] leads to einselection when the [[quantum state|states]] of the [[Environment (systems)|environment]] &lt;math&gt;|\epsilon_i \rangle&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to different pointer states become orthogonal:
&lt;math&gt;\langle \epsilon_i|\epsilon_j \rangle = \delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;",&lt;ref name="zurek03"/&gt;

==Details==
Einselected pointer states are distinguished by their ability to persist in spite of the environmental monitoring and therefore are the ones in which quantum open systems are observed. Understanding the nature of these states and the process of their dynamical selection is of fundamental importance. This process has been studied first in a measurement situation: When the system is an apparatus whose intrinsic dynamics can be neglected, pointer states turn out to be [[eigenstates]] of the interaction [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] between the apparatus and its environment.&lt;ref name="zurek05"&gt;
*{{cite journal |last=Zurek |first=W. H. |year=1981 |title= Pointer basis of quantum apparatus: Into what mixture does the wave packet collapse?|journal=[[Physical Review D]] |volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=1516 |doi=10.1103/physrevd.24.1516|bibcode=1981PhRvD..24.1516Z }}
*{{cite journal |last=Zurek |first=W. H. |year=1981 |title= Environment-induced superselection rules|journal=[[Physical Review D]] |volume=26 |issue=8 |pages=1862 |doi=10.1103/physrevd.26.1862|bibcode=1982PhRvD..26.1862Z }}&lt;/ref&gt; In more general situations, when the system's dynamics is relevant, einselection is more complicated. Pointer states result from the interplay between self-evolution and environmental monitoring.

To study einselection, an operational definition of pointer states has been introduced.&lt;ref name="zurek06"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zurek |first=W. H. |year=1993 |journal=[[Progress of Theoretical Physics]] |volume=89 |issue=2 |pages=281–312 |doi=10.1143/ptp/89.2.281 |title=Preferred States, Predictability, Classicality and the Environment-Induced Decoherence|bibcode=1993PThPh..89..281Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zurek07"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zurek |first1=W.

P. |year=1993 |title=Coherent states via decoherence |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |volume=70 |issue=9 |pages=1187–1190 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.70.1187 |bibcode=1993PhRvL..70.1187Z|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1233897/files/article.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This is the "predictability sieve" criterion, based on an intuitive idea: ''Pointer states'' can be defined as the ones which become minimally entangled with the environment in the course of their evolution. The predictability sieve criterion is a way to quantify this idea by using the following algorithmic procedure: For every initial pure state &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, one measures the [[Quantum entanglement|entanglement]] generated dynamically between the system and the environment by computing the entropy:
::&lt;math&gt; \mathcal {H}_\Psi (t)= -\operatorname{Tr} \left ( \rho_\Psi(t) \log \rho_\Psi(t) \right ) &lt;/math&gt;
or some other measure of predictability &lt;ref name="zurek06"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zurek07"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zurek08"&gt;

The nature of pointer states has been investigated using the predictability sieve criterion only for a limited number of examples.&lt;ref name="zurek06"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zurek07"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zurek08"/&gt; Apart from the already mentioned case of the measurement situation (where pointer states are simply eigenstates of the interaction Hamiltonian) the most notable example is that of a quantum [[Brownian]] particle coupled through its position with a bath of independent [[harmonic oscillators]]. In such case pointer states are localized in [[phase space]], even though the interaction Hamiltonian involves the position of the particle.&lt;ref name="zurek07"/&gt; Pointer states are the result of the interplay between self-evolution and interaction with the environment and turn out to be coherent states.

There is also a [[quantum limit]] of decoherence: When the spacing between [[energy levels]] of the system is large compared to the [[frequencies]] present in the environment, [[energy eigenstates]] are einselected nearly independently of the nature of the system-environment coupling.&lt;ref name="zurek82"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Paz |first=J. P. |last2=Zurek |first2=W. H. |year=1999 |title=Quantum limit of decoherence: Environment induced superselection of energy eigenstates |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |volume=82 |issue=26 |pages=5181–5185 |arxiv=quant-ph/9811026 |doi=10.1103/physrevlett.82.5181|bibcode=1999PhRvL..82.5181P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collisional decoherence ==

There has been significant work on correctly identifying the pointer states in the case of a massive particle decohered by collisions with a fluid environment, often known as ''collisional decoherence''.  In particular, Busse and Hornberger have identified certain solitonic wavepackets as being unusually stable in the presence of such decoherence.&lt;ref name="busse2009"&gt;{{Cite journal |arxiv=0905.4609 |last1=Busse |first1=M. |title=Emergence of pointer states in a non-perturbative environment |journal=[[Journal of Physics A]] |volume=42 |issue=36 |pages=362001 |last2=Hornberger |first2=K. |year=2009 |doi=10.1088/1751-8113/42/36/362001 |bibcode=2009JPhA...42J2001B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="busse2010"&gt;{{Cite journal |arxiv=0910.1062 |last1=Busse |first1=M. |title=Pointer basis induced by collisional decoherence |journal=[[Journal of Physics A]] |volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=015303 |last2=Hornberger |first2=K. |year=2009 |doi=10.1088/1751-8113/43/1/015303 |bibcode=2010JPhA...43a5303B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6850">'''The Group on International Perspectives on Governmental Aggression and Peace''' [http://people.bu.edu/gipgap/ (GIPGAP)] is an international multi-disciplinary team of academics and researchers. The group has been undertaking extensive research into social attitudes to [[peace]] and [[war]], using the Personal and Institutional Rights to Aggression and Peace Scale, or PAIRTAPS. There is no shortage of critical literature on peace and war. However this is the first-ever global study of the attitudes of ordinary citizens to peace and war. GIPGAP is co-ordinated by [[Kathleen Malley-Morrison]] of [[Boston University]], and has its origins in an earlier group that investigated [[domestic violence]] within a project entitled International Perspectives on Family Violence and Abuse. The GIPGAP project involves surveying and analysis of the views of citizens from more than 30 countries —covering [[North America]], [[South America]], [[Central America]], [[Western Europe]], [[Eastern Europe]], the [[Middle East]], [[Africa]], the [[Asia Pacific]], [[South Asia]], [[Australia]], and the [[Pacific Islands]].

==Research Instrument==
The basic research instrument, the Personal and Institutional Rights to Aggression and Peace Scale, is an online survey, utilizing aspects of both [[qualitative research]] and [[quantitative research]]. Respondents are encouraged to indicate the degree to which they agree or disagree with certain propositions and the instrument also encourages respondents to make specific comment upon issues. The survey is available to respondents in a range of language versions, including English, French, German, Greek, Icelandic, Italian, Japanese, and Portuguese.

==Research Findings==
Preliminary findings for individual countries can be found in the publications list and especially the 4-volume publication in 2009 by Praeger International. In general, there was disapproval for the notion that nations should have a right to invade other nations, disapproval for the use of torture, disapproval for the killing of [[civilians]], approval for the right to protest war, and tentative approval for the notion of a right to peace.  Women were very much in support of the notion of the right of children to grow up in a world of peace. Further research, analysis and scholarly publication is planned for the future.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16942">In a [[Tournament#Group tournaments|group tournament]], unlike a [[Tournament#Knockout tournaments|knockout tournament]], there is no scheduled decisive final match.  Instead, all the competitors are ranked by examining the results of all the matches played in the tournament.  Typically, points are awarded for each match,&lt;ref group="n"&gt;A match for the purposes of a tournament (also called a ''[[wikt:tie#Noun|tie]]'', ''[[wikt:fixture#Noun|fixture]]'', or ''[[wikt:rubber#Noun 2|rubber]]'') may comprise multiple individual matches in the sport or game concerned (also called ''[[wikt:rubber#Noun 2|rubber]]s'' or ''[[wikt:leg#Noun|leg]]s'').&lt;/ref&gt; with competitors ranked based either on total number of points or average points per match. Usually each competitor finishes with an equal number of matches, in which case rankings by total points and by average points are equivalent at the end of the tournament, though not necessarily while it is in progress. Examples with unequal numbers of matches include the [[1895 County Championship]] in English cricket, and the U.S. [[National Football League]] prior to 1972, when tie games were excluded from the [[winning percentage]] used for [[regular season|regular-season]] standings.

==Points calculation==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[2007 Southeast Asia Basketball Association Championship]] --&gt;
In two-competitor games where [[tie (draw)|tie]]s are rare or impossible, competitors are typically ranked by number of wins, with ties counting half; each competitor's listings are usually ordered wins–losses(–ties).  Giving a half-point for a [[draw (chess)|draw in chess]] was introduced in 1868 by the [[British Chess Association]]; previously, drawn games in [[chess tournament]]s were replayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last=Sunnucks | first=Anne |authorlink=Anne Sunnucks | year=1970 |encyclopedia=The Encyclopaedia of Chess |title=drawn games | publisher=St. Martins Press | isbn=978-0-7091-4697-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where draws are more common, the award may be 2 points for a win and 1 for a draw, which is mathematically equivalent but avoids having half-points in the listings. These are usually ordered wins–draws–losses.  If there are more than 2 competitors per match, points may be ordinal—for example, 3 for first, 2 for second, 1 for third. An extreme example of this is [[Formula One]], where the top ten racers in each [[List of Formula One Grands Prix|Grand Prix]] are given 25, 18, 15, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2 and 1 respectively. 

Some games may have more complex ranking criteria. For example, in [[rugby union]], [[rugby union bonus points system|bonus points]] may be awarded for scoring a certain number of [[try|tries]] in a match, usually four, or for losing by a relatively small margin, usually 7 (the value of a converted try) or less.

Additionally in many leagues, the governing body is able to penalize a competitor who has broken the league's rules (for instance by allowing an ineligible player to play) by deducting points from that competitor's total. Sometimes this deduction may be carried over to a following season, particularly if the infraction occurs during the [[Season (sports)#Off-season|off-season]], meaning that the competitor will start the following season with a negative points total rather than zero.

Official listings while a tournament is in progress may need to take account of competitors having played differing fractions of their schedules. Some use average points (such as the "points percentage" of the [[National Hockey League]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Leach |first1=Zach |title=The Case For Points Percentage |url=https://www.prohockeyrumors.com/2017/12/the-case-for-points-percentage.html |website=Pro Hockey Rumors |accessdate=16 July 2018 |date=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and others total points (such as the English [[Premier League]], although comparisons between teams typically mention where one has "games in hand" on the other). The [[games behind]] figure in [[Major League Baseball]] gives the same rank order as average points.

===Association football===
In [[association football]], where draws are relatively common, many leagues give [[3 points for a win]] and 1 for a draw in an attempt to encourage attacking play.  Besides the traditional 2-1-0 points and newer 3-1-0 points systems for win-draw-loss, various other systems have been used to try to encourage attractive play.  Some examples:

* 3-2-1 as in the [[Superleague Greece|Greek League]] 1959–73;&lt;ref name="GRE"&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesg/grkhist.html Greece - Final Tables 1959-1999]&lt;/ref&gt; or 4-2-1. Giving 1 point extra in each case for losing may be simply cosmetic, but does allow for awarding 0 points for [[wiktionary:forfeit|forfeit]]ing a match.  (The [[FIFA]] standard is to count a forfeit as a 3–0 defeat.)
*The [[USL W-League]] in 2002 gave 4-1-0 with a bonus point for scoring three goals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesu/usa-wom02.html United States (Women) 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[1981–82 League of Ireland]] season had 4-3-2-1-0 points for away win&amp;nbsp;— home win&amp;nbsp;— away draw&amp;nbsp;— home draw&amp;nbsp;— loss&lt;ref name="ROI"&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesi/ierhist.html (Republic of) Ireland League Tables] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080221000146/http://www.rsssf.com/tablesi/ierhist.html |date=2008-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[Football in China|China]] in the 1970s and 1980s, bonus points were for scoring headed goals, and for teams whose players were selected for the [[China national football team|national squad]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesc/chinahist.html China League History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140607124048/http://www.rsssf.com/tablesc/chinahist.html |date=2014-06-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[First Professional Football League|Bulgaria]] for three seasons 1984–87 gave no points for scoreless draws.&lt;ref name="BUL"&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesb/bulghist.html Bulgaria Championship History 1924–1997]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Ligue 1|France]] gave a bonus point for scoring 3 goals in 1973–76,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesf/franfullhist.html France - First Division Results and Tables 1932-1998]&lt;/ref&gt; but stopped after rumours this encouraged [[match fixing]]. However, [[Michel Hidalgo]] has reported to the [[French Football Federation]] similar proposals to encourage attacking play.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uefa.com/magazine/news/Kind=128/newsId=402528.html Football industry: French in search of lost goals]&lt;/ref&gt;
Some leagues have used [[penalty shootout (football)|penalty shootouts]] after drawn games, in which case points will vary for regulation win&amp;nbsp;— penalties win&amp;nbsp;— penalties loss&amp;nbsp;— regulation loss:
* In the [[Playoffs#Association football|playoff]]s of the [[Championnat de France de football féminin|French women's league]], 4-2-1-0.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesf/fran-wom02.html France (Women) First Level 2001–02]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Yugoslav First League|Yugoslav League]] had 2-1-0-0 from 1989–92&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesj/joeghist.html Yugoslavia - List of Final Tables]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Major League Soccer]] had 3-1-0-0 from 1996–99.&lt;ref name="MLS"&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/usadave/mls.html USA - Major League Soccer]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The original [[Japan Football League (former)|Japan Football League]] had 3-3-1-0 in 1996&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesj/jap96.html Japan 1996]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the [[North American Soccer League (1968–1984)|North American Soccer League]] in 1975–84, 6-1-0-0, with a bonus point each for up to 3 goals scored&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/usadave/nasl.html North American Soccer League]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the [[Western Soccer League]] in 1989, 6-4-2-0, with a bonus point each for up to 3 goals scored&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/usadave/wsa.html USA - Western Soccer Alliance/League]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[EFL Trophy]] and [[Scottish League Cup]] from 2016–17, 3-2-1-0 in the first round groups.

===Basketball===
In [[FIBA]] (basketball)-sanctioned tournaments, where ties are impossible (a game goes into as many extra periods&amp;nbsp;— or overtimes&amp;nbsp;— as necessary to determine a winner), the following method is used:
*Win (including by forfeit) = 2 points
*Loss = 1 point
*Loss by default (all players were ejected/disqualified/injured) = 1 point
*Loss by forfeit (fails to show up for a scheduled game or withdraws from the court before the end of the game) = 0 points&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiba.com/downloads/Rules/2012/OfficialBasketballRules2012.pdf Official Basketball Rules 2012 pp. 24–25]&lt;/ref&gt;
For an example, see [[2006 FIBA World Championship]].

===Ice Hockey===
In the [[National Hockey League]] (and various other minor hockey leagues), where [[regular season]] games tied after three periods go into a five-minute sudden-death overtime period and then a shootout if needed, the following method is used:

*Win: 2 points
*Loss in regulation time: 0 points
*Loss in overtime or shootout: 1 point

Most European [[ice hockey]] leagues including the [[KHL]] use an alteration to the NHL method that does not encourage regulation draws by awarding more combined points than regulation decisions. This system was also used at the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in the preliminary round-robin games:&lt;ref name=Format&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iihf.com/en/channels10/olympics-2010/home/men/format.html |title=2010 OWG Men's Tournament Playing Format |publisher=[[International Ice Hockey Federation]] |accessdate=18 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Win in regulation time: 3 points
*Win in overtime or shootout: 2 points
*Loss in regulation time: 0 points
*Loss in overtime or shootout: 1 point

==Tiebreaker criteria==
When competitors are level on points, there is usually some [[tiebreaker]] criterion.  

Sometimes, however, ranking ties may stand: prior to 1994, the [[Six Nations Championship|Five Nations Championship]] in rugby union could result in joint champions; likewise for the [[British Home Championship]] in [[association football]] until 1978.  In [[college football]] in the [[United States]], many [[list of college athletic conferences|conference]]s permit joint champions. However, if [[automatic bids to college bowl games|ranking within the conference determines eligibility]] for a [[Bowl game#Post-season bowls|postseason bowl game]], tiebreak criteria will be required to separate the joint champions. Similarly, U.S. college conferences in other sports, notably [[college basketball|basketball]], use tiebreak criteria as needed to determine seeding in postseason conference tournaments.

A tiebreaker may be a [[One-game playoff|play-off]], with extra matches between the tied competitors. This may be a full match or a reduced format such as a [[penalty shootout]] or [[speed chess]]. If there are more than two tied competitors in a 2-competitor game, the play-off may be a round-robin or knockout tournament.  

Instead of a playoff, the original matches may provide the tie-breaker criteria: 
;head-to-head: considering only results of matches between the deadlocked competitors. If more than a single match is involved, a subtable may be used recursively for the ranking. For example, in the [[Super League Greece 2006-07]], part of the final table was:&lt;ref&gt;

'''''Horne v. Flores''''', 557 U.S. 433 (2009), is a case in which the [[United States Supreme Court]] [[Remand (court procedure)#United States|remanded]] the case to determine whether [[Arizona|Arizona’s]] [[Education in the United States|general education]] funding budget supports [[Equal Educational Opportunities Act]] (EEOA)-compliant [[English as a foreign or second language|English Language Learner (ELL)]] programming.

==Background==
The case was brought in 1992 by English Language Learner (ELL) students against the [[Arizona#Education|state board of education and state superintendent]] on the grounds that the [[Nogales, Arizona|Nogales]] Unified School District had failed to teach the students [[English language|English]], which was vital to their success.  The case is styled after the plaintiff, Miriam Flores, one of the parents involved in the case, and the defendant, [[Tom Horne|Thomas Horne]], the Arizona Superintendent of Public Instruction. 

In 2000, after almost eight years of pretrial proceedings and settling of various claims, the federal district court in Arizona held that the state was violating the Equal Educational Opportunity Act because the amount of funding it allocated for the special needs of ELL students was arbitrary and not related to the actual funding needed to cover the costs of ELL instruction in the plaintiffs' school district.

==Opinion of the Court==
On June 25, 2009, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] overturned the decision of the state court, deciding in favor of Horne, and allowing the state to determine its own requirements with regards to ELL instruction. [[Justice Alito]] wrote the opinion for the 5-4 majority.  The opinion held that in evaluating the actions of the state attention should focus on student outcomes rather than on spending and inputs to schools.&lt;ref&gt;To support this, the majority opinion relied on the arguments in [[Eric Hanushek|Eric A. Hanushek]] and Alfred A. Lindseth (2009), ''Schoolhouses, courthouses, and statehouses:  Solving the funding-achievement puzzle in America's public schools'' (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dissent==
[[Justice Breyer]], joined by [[Justice Stevens]], [[Justice Souter]], and [[Justice Ginsburg]]. Justice Breyer argued that the lower courts did fairly consider every change in circumstances that the parties called to their attention, and that the majority opinion risks denying schoolchildren the English language instruction necessary to overcome language barriers that impede equal participation.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/08-289.ZD.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Human Brain Project''' ('''HBP''') is a large ten-year scientific research project, based on [[Exascale computing|exascale supercomputers]], that aims to build a collaborative [[Information and communications technology|ICT]]-based scientific research infrastructure to allow researchers across Europe to advance knowledge in the fields of neuroscience, computing, and brain-related medicine.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Human Brain Project, Framework Partnership Agreement https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/documents/10180/538356/FPA++Annex+1+Part+B/41c4da2e-0e69-4295-8e98-3484677d661f&lt;/ref&gt; The Project, which started on 1 October 2013, is a [[European Commission]]  [[Future and Emerging Technologies]] Flagship. The HBP is coordinated by the [[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne]] and is largely funded by the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/h2020-section/fet-flagships&lt;/ref&gt; The project coordination office is in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Human Brain Project relocates to Geneva|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/science_technology/Human_Brain_Project_relocates_to_Geneva.html?cid=37219978|accessdate=29 October 2013|newspaper=SwissInfo|date=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategic goals and organisation==
[[File:Rolex Learning center.jpg|thumb|The 2013 HBP Summit–the inauguration of the Project–took place in the [[EPFL Learning Centre]] in October 2013. It brought together scientists from over 100 Partner Institutions.]]

Fundamental to the HBP approach is to investigate the brain on different spatial and temporal scales (i.e. from the molecular to the large networks underlying higher cognitive processes, and from milliseconds to years). To achieve this goal, the HBP relies on the collaboration of scientists from diverse disciplines, including neuroscience, philosophy and computer science, to take advantage of the loop of experimental data, modelling theories and simulations. The idea is that empirical results are used to develop theories, which then foster modelling and simulations which result in predictions that are in turn verified by empirical results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2016.10.046 |pmid=27809997 |title=The Human Brain Project: Creating a European Research Infrastructure to Decode the Human Brain |journal=Neuron |volume=92 |issue=3 |pages=574–581 |year=2016 |last1=Amunts |first1=Katrin |last2=Ebell |first2=Christoph |last3=Muller |first3=Jeff |last4=Telefont |first4=Martin |last5=Knoll |first5=Alois |last6=Lippert |first6=Thomas }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary objective of the HBP is to create an ICT-based research infrastructure for brain research, cognitive neuroscience and brain-inspired computing, which can be used by researchers world-wide.

The Project is divided into 12 Subprojects. Six of these develop ICT-based platforms (Subprojects 5-10), which consist of prototype hardware, software, databases, and programming interfaces. These tools are available to researchers worldwide via the HBP [[Collaboratory]]. Three Subprojects gather data on empirical neuroscience and establish theoretical foundations (Subprojects 1-4) and one is responsible for ethics and society (Subproject 12). Subproject 11 coordinates the project.

* SP1 Mouse Brain Organisation: Understanding the structure of the mouse brain, and its electrical and chemical functions
* SP2 Human Brain Organisation: Understanding the structure of the human brain, and its electrical and chemical functions
* SP3 Systems and Cognitive Neuroscience: Understanding how the brain performs its systems-level and cognitive functional activities
* SP4 Theoretical Neuroscience: Deriving high-level mathematical models to synthesize conclusions from research data
* SP5 [[Neuroinformatics]] Platform: Gathering, organising and making available brain data
* SP6 [[Brain simulation|Brain Simulation]] Platform: Developing data-driven reconstructions of brain tissue and simulation capabilities to explore these reconstructions
* SP7 [[High-performance computing|High-performance Analytics and Computing]] Platform: Providing the ICT capability to map the brain in unprecedented detail, construct complex models, run large simulations, and analyse large volumes of data
* SP8 [[Medical informatics|Medical Informatics]] Platform: Developing the infrastructure to share hospital and medical research data for the purpose of understanding disease clusters and their respective disease signatures
* SP9 [[Neuromorphic engineering|Neuromorphic Computing]] Platform: Developing and applying brain-inspired computing technology
* SP10 [[Neurorobotics]] Platform: Developing virtual and real robots and environments for testing brain simulations
* SP11 Management and Coordination: General coordination of the project
* SP12 Ethics and Society: Exploring the ethical and societal impact of HBP’s work

The HBP is coordinated by the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne and involves researchers from over 117 partner institutions in 19 countries across Europe.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Notable Partner Institutions include the [[University of Heidelberg]], [[Forschungszentrum Jülich]], and the [[University Hospital of Lausanne]].

The scientific direction is provided by representatives from each of the HBP's Subprojects, which form the Science and Infrastructure Board (SIB). Katrin Amunts from Forschungszentrum Jülich is the Chair of the SIB. Alois Knoll from TU Munich is Vice Chair of the SIB for software. The Directorate steers the daily work of the HBP – it is led by Andreas Mortensen from EPFL. 

==Funding==
The HBP is funded by the European Commission Directorate General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology (DG CONNECT) under the Horizon 2020 framework, an EU Research and Innovation funding programme. It was one of the two initial Future Emerging Technologies (FET) Flagship projects.

The project is split into five phases, each supplied with separate funding. The call for funding for the Project's initial two-and-a-half-year 'Ramp-Up Phase' of  EUR 54 million closed in November 2013 and the results were announced in March 2014. Twenty-two projects from thirty-two organisations were selected for the initial funding of EUR 8.3 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Human Brain Project just got bigger |url=https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/documents/10180/538356/HBP+Competitive+Calls+Programme+-+Press+Release/e98a279e-6e08-4ad5-bd07-b125c9d63cd3?version=1.1 |accessdate=2014-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ramp-Up Phase ended on 31 March 2016. Funding is reassessed every two years using Specific Grant Agreements (SGA); the first of which began in April 2016 (ending in April 2018), and the second with a total EU funding of 88 Million Euro starting in April 2018 (ending in March 2020). The HBP's total costs are estimated at EUR 1.019 billion, of which EUR 500 million will be provided by the European Commission, EUR 500 million by national, public and private organisations, and EUR 19 million by the Core Project Ramp-Up Phase Partners.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Obstacles==
One of the Project's primary hurdles is the unsystematic nature of the information collected from previous brain research. Neurological research data varies by biological organisation schemes, species studied, and by developmental stages, making it difficult to collectively use the data to replicate the brain in a model that acts as a single system.&lt;ref name="report"&gt;[http://tierra.aslab.upm.es/documents/projects/HBP_flagship_report_for_Europe.pdf "A Report to the European Commission" ] The Human Brain Project.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other obstacles include engineering problems involving power consumption, memory, and storage.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/discover/the-project/overview&lt;/ref&gt; For example, detailed neuron representations are very computationally expensive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/s12868-015-0162-6 |title=Simulation of alcohol action upon a detailed Purkinje neuron model and a simpler surrogate model that runs &gt;400 times faster |journal=BMC Neuroscience |volume=16 |year=2015 |last1=Forrest |first1=Michael D }}&lt;/ref&gt; and whole brain simulation is at the leading edge of our computational capability.

==Implications==
[[File:01337LOW HQ MERCK SERONO.jpg|thumb|The Human Brain Project moved to [[Campus Biotech]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/sci-tech/surprise-move_human-brain-project-relocates-to-geneva/37219978|title=Human Brain Project relocates to Geneva - SWI swissinfo.ch|website=SWI swissinfo.ch|access-date=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Technologies generated by the HBP and other similar projects offer several possibilities to other fields of research. For instance, a brain model can be used to investigate signatures of disease in the brain and the impact of certain drugs, enabling the development of better diagnosis and treatment methods. Ultimately, these technologies will likely lead to more advanced medical options available to patients at a lower cost.&lt;ref name="report" /&gt;

In addition, detailed brain simulation requires significant computing power, leading to developments in supercomputing and energy-efficient, brain-inspired computing techniques. Computational developments can be extended into areas such as data mining, telecommunications, appliances, and other industrial uses.&lt;ref name="report" /&gt;

The long-term ethical consequences of the Project are also considered. The Project follows a policy of Responsible Research and Innovation, and its Ethics Advisory Board is responsible for monitoring the use of human volunteers, animal subjects, and the data collected. Implications on European society, industry, and economy are investigated by the HBP Ethics and Society Programme's Foresight Lab.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/ethics-and-society Human Brain Project-Ethics and Society] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130829141728/http://www.humanbrainproject.eu/ethics-and-society |date=29 August 2013 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
An open letter was sent on 7 July 2014 to the European Commission by 154 European researchers (750 signatures as of 3 September 2014)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/513027a |pmid=25186884 |title=Neuroscience: Where is the brain in the Human Brain Project? |journal=Nature |volume=513 |issue=7516 |pages=27–9 |year=2014 |last1=Frégnac |first1=Yves |last2=Laurent |first2=Gilles |bibcode=2014Natur.513...27F }}&lt;/ref&gt; complaining of the HBP's overly narrow approach, and threatening to boycott the Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open message to the European Commission concerning the Human Brain Project|url=http://www.neurofuture.eu/|accessdate=2014-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Central to this controversy was an internal dispute about funding for cognitive scientists who study high level brain functions, such as thought and behaviour. However, the HBP stated that there is “no question that cognition and behaviour are vital to the HBP”, explaining that cognitive neuroscience research was repositioned in the Project to allow the Core Project to focus on building the Platforms. In addition, The Open Letter called on the EC to “reallocate the funding currently allocated to the HBP core and partnering projects to broad neuroscience-directed funding to meet the original goals of the HBP—understanding brain function and its effect on society”. In its response, the HBP said that “while [neuroscience research] generates a vast amount of valuable data, there is currently no technology for sharing, organising, analysing or integrating this information, beyond papers and even databases. The HBP will provide the critical missing layer to move towards a multi-level reconstruction and simulation of the brain”. It added that “cognitive and behavioural neuroscience will become the most significant component of neuroscience in HBP over the course of the Project. However, for this to happen the Platforms have to be in place first”.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/documents/10180/17646/HBP-Statement.090614.pdf|title=The Vital Role of Neuroscience in the Human Brain Project|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=11 March 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140823003843/https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/documents/10180/17646/HBP-Statement.090614.pdf|archivedate=23 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Dayan]], director of computational neuroscience at [[University College London]], argued that the goal of a large-scale simulation of the brain is radically premature,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scientists threaten to boycott €1.2bn Human Brain Project|publisher=The Guardian|date=7 July 2014|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/jul/07/human-brain-project-researchers-threaten-boycott|accessdate=2014-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Geoffrey Hinton]] said that "[t]he real problem with that project is they have no clue how to get a large system like that to learn".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Brean |first=Joseph |url=http://www.nationalpost.com/m/wp/blog.html?b=news.nationalpost.com/2014/07/08/a-billion-dollar-european-effort-to-model-the-human-brain-in-a-supercomputer-is-in-danger-of-collapsing |title=A billion-dollar European effort to model the brain in a supercomputer is in danger of collapsing |work=[[National Post]] |date=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar concerns as to the project's methodology were raised by [[Robert Epstein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://aeon.co/essays/your-brain-does-not-process-information-and-it-is-not-a-computer|title=Your brain does not process information and it is not a computer – Robert Epstein {{!}} Aeon Essays|website=Aeon|access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The HBP has said that its members share the uncertainty surrounding large-scale simulation, but that “reconstructing and simulating the human brain is a vision, a target; the benefits will come from the technology needed to get there. That technology, developed by the HBP, will benefit all of neuroscience as well as related fields”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 2015 the project underwent a review process and the three-member executive committee, led by Markram, was dissolved&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1015-36 |title=Trouble in Mind |journal=Scientific American |volume=313 |issue=4 |pages=36–42 |year=2015 |last1=Theil |first1=Stefan |bibcode=2015SciAm.313d..36T }}&lt;/ref&gt; and replaced by a 22-member governing board.&lt;ref&gt;http://sciencebusiness.net/news/77294/%E2%82%AC1B-Human-Brain-Project-back-on-track-after-Commission-signs-new-contract{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Don Rickles 1973.JPG|thumb|120px|Publicity photo of [[Don Rickles]], a well-regarded insult comedian, in 1973.]]
'''Insult comedy''' is a [[comedy]] genre in which the act consists mainly of offensive insults directed at the performer's audience or other performers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G2nZzPKpwjkC&amp;pg=PA167 | title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Comedy Writing |author=James Mendrinos, Jim Mendrinos |isbn=978-1-59257-231-1 |publisher=Penguin |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical targets for insult include individuals in the show's audience, the town hosting the performance, or the subject of a [[Roast (comedy)|roast]]. An insult comedian often maintains a competitive and interactive relationship with his or her audience. The style has been described as "festive abuse".

The style can be distinguished from an act based on satire, or political humor. Insult comedy is often used to deflect or silence [[heckler]]s even when the rest of the show is not focused around it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2088">In [[Inuit mythology]], an '''inua''' (ᐃᓄᐊ; plural '''inuat''' ᐃᓄᐊᑦ, literally "possessor" or "master") is a [[Soul (spirit)|spirit or soul]] that exists in all people, animals, lakes, mountains, and plants.  They were sometimes personified in mythology.  The concept is similar to [[mana]]. For arctic people, human and animals are equal - All life has the same kind of soul or "life essence" (inua). This creates a predicament that, in order to survive people must kill other creatures that are like them. Recognition of this dilemma lies at the centre of hunting practice, which is based upon respect and reciprocity. The hunter will only succeed if the animal chooses to give its life as a gift in return for moral and respectful behaviour on the part of the whole community. For example, after a seal has been killed fresh water is poured into its mouth so that its soul will not be thirsty and it will tell the other seals of the respect shown to it.

Among the [[Central Alaskan Yup'ik people|Yu'pik]] near Kuskokwim Bay of Coastal Alaska, the word '''yua''' (absolutive case form of the word ''yuk'' "human; human-like spirit") has similar connotations as that of the Iñupiaq of Northern Alaska, who similar to the Inuit call it ''iñua'' or ''inua''. For both the Yu'piak and Iñupiaq, the meaning is closest to an understanding of a world in which "Most Arctic peoples believe all the world is animate, and that animals have souls or spirits", (Berlo and Phillips 161) a foundational belief of the continuum and inter-connectivity of all life and spirit of all that which is, that which has been, and that which is yet to be.

'''Julius von Sachs''' ({{IPA-de|zaks|lang}}; 2 October 1832 – 29 May 1897) was a German [[botanist]] from [[Wrocław|Breslau]], [[Prussian Silesia]].  He is a monumental figure in the [[history of botany]].

==Early life==
Sachs was born at Breslau on 2 October 1832. His father, Graveur Sachs, was an engraver by trade, and father taught son delineation and accuracy of line and color.  From earliest boyhood Julius was fascinated with plants, making collections of them on many field excursions with his father.  He gave much of his time between the ages of thirteen and sixteen to drawing and painting the flowers, fungi, and other specimens which he collected.  At the Gymnasium from 1845 to 1850 he was most interested in the natural sciences, collecting skulls, writing a monograph on the crayfish. His natural science teacher, one Krober, showed a singular lack of foresight when he solemnly warned young Sachs against devoting himself to the natural sciences.

When he was but sixteen years old, his father died, and in the next year both his mother and a brother died of the cholera. Suddenly without financial support, he was fortunate to be taken into the family of [[Jan Evangelista Purkyně]] who had accepted a professorship at the [[Charles University in Prague|University of Prague]]. Sachs was admitted to the university in 1851.

Sachs famously labored long hours in the laboratory for Purkyně, and then long hours for himself each day after his work in the laboratory was finished.  After the lab, he could devote himself entirely to establishing how plants grow.

==Career==
In 1856 Sachs graduated as doctor of philosophy, and then adopted a botanical career, establishing himself as ''[[Privatdozent]]'' for [[plant physiology]]. In 1859 he was appointed physiological assistant to the Agricultural Academy of Tharandt (now part of the [[Technical University of Dresden]]) at [[Julius Adolph Stöckhardt]]; and in 1862 he was called to be director of the [[Chemnitz University of Technology|Polytechnic at Chemnitz]], but was almost immediately transferred to the Agricultural Academy at Poppelsdorf (now part of the [[University of Bonn]]), where he remained until 1867, when he was nominated professor of botany in the [[University of Freiburg]].

In 1868 he accepted the chair of botany in the [[University of Würzburg]], which he continued to occupy (in spite of calls from more prestigious German universities) until his death.

Sachs achieved distinction as an investigator, a writer and a teacher; his name will ever be especially associated with the great development of plant physiology which marked the latter half of the 19th century, though there is scarcely a branch of botany to which he did not materially contribute. His earlier papers, scattered through the volumes of botanical journals and of the publications of learned societies (a collected edition was published in 1892-93), are of great and varied interest. Prominent among them is the series of "Keimungsgeschichten," which laid the foundation of our knowledge of microchemical methods, as also of the [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] and physiological details of [[germination]].
Then there is his resuscitation of the method of "water-culture," and the application of it to the investigation of the problems of nutrition.

Most important are his experiments, developing the concept of [[photosynthesis]], that the [[starch]]-grains, found in leaf [[chloroplasts]], depend on sunlight. A leaf that has been in sunlight, then bleached white and stained with [[iodine]] turns black, proving its starch content, whereas a leaf from the same plant that has been out of the sun will remain white.  A demonstration of this experiment is shown in the second episode of [[BBC Four]]'s "Botany: A Blooming History" presented by [[Timothy Walker (botanist)|Timothy Walker]].

Sachs's later papers were almost exclusively published in the three volumes of the ''Arbeiten des botanischen Instituts in Würzburg'' (1871–88). Among these are his investigation of the periodicity of growth in length, in connection with which he devised the self-registering [[auxanometer]], by which he established the retarding influence of the highly refrangible rays of the [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]] on the rate of growth; his researches on [[heliotropism]] and [[geotropism]], in which he introduced the [[clinostat]]; his work on the structure and the arrangement of cells in growing-points; the elaborate experimental evidence upon which he based his "imbibition-theory" of the transpiration-current; his exhaustive study of the assimilatory activity of the green [[leaf]]; and other papers of interest.

Sachs' first published volume was the ''Handbuch der Experimentalphysiologie des Pflanzen'' (1865; French edition, 1868), which gives an admirable account of the state of knowledge in certain departments of the subject, and includes a great deal of original information. This was followed in 1868 by the first edition of his famous ''Lehrbuch der Botanik'', by far the best book of its kind. It is a comprehensive work, giving an able summary of the botanical science of the period, enriched with the results of many original investigations. The third edition was translated into French by [[Philippe Édouard Léon Van Tieghem]] in 1873, and into English by Alfred Bennett in 1875, and published by Oxford University Press. The fourth and last German edition was published in 1874, and also issued by Oxford in 1882.

The ''Lehrbuch'' was eventually superseded by the ''Vorlesungen uber Pflanzenphysiologie'' (1st ed., 1882; 2nd ed., 1887; Eng. ed., Oxford, 1887), a work more limited in scope, but yet covering more ground than its title would imply; though it is a remarkable book, it has not gained the general recognition accorded to the ''Lehrbuch''. Finally, there is the ''Geschichte der Botanik'' (1875); a brilliant and learned account of the development of the various branches of botanical science from the middle of the 16th century up to 1860, of which an English edition was published in 1890 by the Oxford Press. As a teacher Sachs exerted great influence, for his vigorous personality and his ready and lucid utterance enabled him not only to instruct, but to fire his students with something of his own enthusiasm.

A full account of Sachs' life and work was given by Professor Goebel, formerly his assistant, in ''Flora'' (1897), of which an English translation appeared in ''Science Progress'' for 1898. There is also an obituary notice of him in the ''Proc. Roy. Soc.'' vol. lxii.

In 1885 he became foreign member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&amp;aId=PE00002736 |title=J. von Sachs (1832 - 1897) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |date= |accessdate=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==

Sachs has been described as a "post-Darwinian botanist" who "integrated the evolutionary theory into his morphological writings."&lt;ref&gt;Farley, John. (1982). Gametes &amp; Spores: Ideas about Sexual Reproduction, 1750-1914. Johns Hopkins University Press. p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; He was originally supportive of [[Darwinism]] but in his late career became bitterly opposed to it, instead preferring [[non-Darwinian evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Dennert, Eberhard. (1904). [https://archive.org/stream/cu31924024754719#page/n41/mode/2up ''At the Deathbed of Darwinism: A Series of Papers'']. German Literary Board. p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Croizat, Léon. (1960). ''Principia Botanica: Or, Beginnings of Botany''. Weldon &amp; Wesley. p. 1680&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Many pupils of Sachs like [[Julius Oscar Brefeld]], [[Francis Darwin]], [[Karl Ritter von Goebel]], [[Georg Albrecht Klebs]], [[Spiridon Miliarakis]], [[Hermann Müller (Thurgau)|Hermann Müller-Thurgau]], [[Fritz Noll]], [[Wilhelm Pfeffer]], [[Karl Anton Eugen Prantl|Karl Prantl]], [[Christian Ernst Stahl]] and [[Hugo de Vries]] became later famous botanists.

The standard [[Binomial nomenclature#Authorship in scientific names|botanical author abbreviation]] '''Sachs''' is applied to [[species]] he described.

'''''Kangling''''' ({{Bo|t=རྐང་གླིང་། |w=rkang-gling}}), literally translated as "leg" (''kang'') "flute" (''ling''), is the [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] name for a [[trumpet]] or horn made out of a human [[femur]], used in [[Tibetan Buddhism]] for various [[chöd]] rituals as well as funerals performed by a chöpa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.damaruworks.com/bone/bone-kangling/ Bone Kangling | DamaruWorks&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;   The femur of a criminal or a person who died a violent death is preferred.&lt;ref name=Handa04&gt;{{cite book |author=O.C.

The kangling should only be used in chöd rituals performed outdoors with the chöd damaru and bell.&lt;ref name=Handa04 /&gt; In Tantric [[chöd]] practice, the practitioner, motivated by [[compassion]], plays the kangling as a gesture of fearlessness, to summon [[Preta|hungry spirits]] and demons so that she or he may satisfy their hunger and thereby relieve their sufferings. It is also played as a way of "cutting off of the ego."{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

A minor figure from [[Katok Monastery]], the First Chonyi Gyatso, Chopa Lugu (17th - mid-18th century), is remembered for his "nightly bellowing of bone-trumpet [kangling] and shouting of phet" on pilgrimage, much to the irritation of the business traveler who accompanied him. Chopa Lugu became renowned as "The Chod Yogi Who Split a Cliff in China (rgya nag brag bcad gcod pa)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia

'''Legal immunity''', or '''immunity from prosecution''', is a [[legal status]] wherein an individual or entity cannot be held liable for a violation of the law, in order to facilitate societal aims that outweigh the value of imposing liability in such cases. Such legal immunity may be from [[criminal prosecution]], or from [[civil liability]] (being subject of [[lawsuit]]), or both. The most notable forms of legal immunity are [[diplomatic immunity]], [[judicial immunity]], and [[witness immunity]]. One author has described legal immunity as "the obverse of a legal power:"&lt;ref name="Knowles"&gt;Dudley Knowles, ''Political Obligation: A Critical Introduction'' (2009), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|A party has an immunity with respect to some action, object or status, if some other relevant party – in this context, another state or international agency, or citizen or group of citizens – has no (power) right to alter the party's legal standing in point of rights or duties in the specified respect. There is a wide range of legal immunities that may be invoked in the name of the right to rule. In international law, immunities may be created when states assert powers of derogation, as is permitted, for example, from the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] 'in times of war or other public emergency'. Equally familiar examples include the immunities against prosecution granted to representatives (MPs or councillors) and government officials in pursuit of their duties. Such legal immunities may be suspect as potential violations of the rule of law, or regarded as quite proper, as necessary protections for the officers of the state in the rightful pursuit of their duties.}}

==Criticism==
Legal immunities may be subject to criticism because they institute a separate standard of conduct for those who receive them. For example, as one author notes:

{{quote|In the United Kingdom, some exercises of the royal prerogative, which seems to give the government of the day opportunities for massive and unaccountable discretion, rightly come under suspicion, whereas the immunity from libel proceedings of Members of Parliament speaking in the House, or of persons giving evidence in a court of law, is generally regarded as an acceptable protection against powerful (and wealthy) interests who would otherwise constrain public debate or the administration of justice.&lt;ref name="Knowles"/&gt;}}

==Types==
===Immunity of government officials===
Many forms of immunity are granted to government officials to enable them to carry out their functions without fear of being sued or charged with a crime for so doing: 
*[[Absolute immunity]], a type of immunity for government officials that confers total immunity when acting in the course of their duties
*[[Qualified immunity]], in the United States, immunity of individuals performing tasks as part of the government's actions
*[[Judicial immunity]], immunity of a judge or magistrate in the course of their official duties
*[[Parliamentary immunity]], immunity granted to elected officials during their tenure and in the course of their duties
*[[Speech and Debate Clause]], a provision in the [[United States Constitution]] that provides immunity to members of Congress for statements made in either house
*[[Sovereign immunity]], the prevention of lawsuits or prosecution against rulers or governments without their given consent
**[[Sovereign immunity in the United States]] bars suit against federal, state, and tribal governments, which cannot be sued without their consent.  Governmental consent to be sued is expressed through legislation as a limited waiver of sovereign immunity  

Grants of immunity are particularly important in intergovernmental relations, where traditions have arisen to prevent the diplomatic representatives of a country from being harassed by their host countries.
*[[Diplomatic immunity]], agreement between sovereign governments to exclude diplomats from local laws
*[[Immunity from prosecution (international law)]], exclusion of governments or their officials from prosecution under international law
*[[State immunity]], principle of international law that the government of a state is not amenable before the courts of another state

Such immunities may be granted by law (statutory or constitutional) or by [[treaty]].

===Immunity of citizens participating in the legal process===
*[[Amnesty law]], a law that provides immunity for past crimes
*[[Spousal privilege]], also called spousal immunity, protects a spouse from testifying against the defendant
*[[Witness immunity]], immunity granted to a [[witness]] in exchange for [[testimony]]
*[[Reporter's privilege]], a limited [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] right many jurisdictions by statutory law or judicial decision have by which journalists may not be prosecuted for protecting their confidential sources from [[discovery (law)|discovery]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexmedia.com.au/2010/10/journalist-shield-laws.html|title=LexMedia|work=lexmedia.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Charitable immunity]], immunity from liability granted to charities in many countries from the 19th century to the mid-20th century

Such immunities may be granted by law or, for witness immunity, by [[prosecutor]]s or other authorities on a case by case basis, commonly as an agreement with the witnesses.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8851">This '''list of ornithologists abbreviated names''' is based on information from the older books on birds. In particular, the books by [[George Robert Gray]] and [[Richard Bowdler Sharpe]]. When reading these older books, abbreviated names are used that sometimes make little or no sense. 
* In George Robert Gray's 1840 publication of List of the Genera of Birds, he uses abbreviated forms of the abbreviations, on occasion. Typically, this is done when he is repeating names within a species and genus set. Typically, but not always, the second (or the species abbreviation) has been further abbreviated. For example, in Family II, Subfamily I, Genus Daptrius is credited to '''Viell''' for [[Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot]], and then further down in the next indented line it describes the species of that genus, and D. ater is credited to '''V''' which again is Viellot.

'''Looting''', also referred to as  '''sacking''', '''ransacking''', '''plundering''', '''despoiling''', '''despoliation''', and '''pillaging''', is the indiscriminate taking of goods by force as part of a military or political victory, or during a catastrophe, such as [[war]],&lt;ref name="BBC_Baghdad_protests"&gt;{{cite news | title = Baghdad protests over looting | work = BBC News | publisher = BBC | date = 2003-04-12 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2941733.stm | accessdate = 2010-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[natural disaster]] (where law and civil enforcement are temporarily ineffective),&lt;ref name="BBC_Americas_looting"&gt;{{cite news | title = World: Americas Looting frenzy in quake city |publisher = BBC News| date = 1999-01-28 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/262848.stm | accessdate = 2010-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[rioting]].&lt;ref name="BBC_Argentine"&gt;{{cite news | title = Argentine president resigns |publisher = BBC News| date = 2001-12-21 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1722584.stm | accessdate = 2010-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also used in a broader sense to describe egregious instances of [[theft]] and [[embezzlement]], such as the "plundering" of private or public assets by governments.&lt;ref name="loot_def_dict"&gt;{{cite web | title = Definition of the word loot | work = Dictionary.com | publisher = Dictionary.com, LLC | year = 2010 | url = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/loot | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The proceeds of all these activities can be described as '''booty''', '''loot''',  '''plunder''', '''spoils''', or '''pillage'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/looting?s=t|title=the definition of looting|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/booty|title=Booty - Define Booty at Dictionary.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[armed conflict]], pillage is prohibited by [[international law]], and constitutes a [[war crime]].&lt;ref name="ICRC"&gt;[https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v1_rul_rule52 Rule 52. Pillage is prohibited.], ''Customary IHL Database'', [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC)/[[Cambridge University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Looting by type==

===In armed conflict===
[[File:Spaanse Furie - De plundering van Mechelen door de hertog van Alba in 1572 (Frans Hogenberg).jpg|thumb|The sacking and looting of [[Mechelen]] by the Spanish troops led by the [[Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|Duke of Alba]], 2 October 1572]]

Looting by a victorious army during war has been common practice throughout recorded history. For foot soldiers, it was viewed as a way to supplement their often meagre income&lt;ref name=hsc&gt;Hsi-sheng Chi, ''Warlord politics in China, 1916–1928'', Stanford University Press, 1976, {{ISBN|0-8047-0894-0}}, str. 93&lt;/ref&gt; and was part of the celebration of victory. On higher levels, the proud exhibition of loot was an integral part of the typical [[Roman triumph]], and [[Genghis Khan]] was not unusual in proclaiming that the greatest happiness was "to vanquish your enemies ... to rob them of their wealth".&lt;ref&gt;Henry Hoyle Howorth [https://books.google.com/books?id=e4PErdXlLhwC&amp;lpg=PA110&amp;pg=PA110#v=onepage&amp;f=false ''History of the Mongols from the 9th to the 19th Century: Part 1 the Mongols Proper and the Kalmyks''], Cosimo Inc. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In warfare in ancient times, the spoils of war included the defeated populations, which were often [[enslavement|enslaved]]. The women and children were often absorbed into the victorious country's population.&lt;ref&gt;John K. Thorton, ''African Background in American Colonization'', in ''The Cambridge economic history of the United States'', Stanley L. Engerman, Robert E. Gallman (ed.), Cambridge University Press, 1996, {{ISBN|0-521-39442-2}}, p. 87. "African states waged war to acquire slaves [...] raids that appear to have been more concerned with obtaining loot (including slaves) than other objectives."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sir John Bagot Glubb, ''The Empire of the Arabs'', Hodder and Stoughton, 1963, p.283. "...thousand Christian captives formed part of the loot and were subsequently sold as slaves in the markets of Syria".&lt;/ref&gt; In other pre-modern societies, objects made of precious metals were the preferred target of war looting, largely because of their easy portability. In many cases looting was an opportunity to obtain treasures that otherwise would not have been obtainable. Since the 18th century, [[looted art|works of art]] have increasingly become a popular target. In the 1930s and even more so during [[World War II]], [[Nazi Germany]] engaged in large scale and organized [[Nazi plunder|looting of art and property]].&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} J. R. Kudelski, ''Tajemnice nazistowskiej grabieży polskich zbiorów sztuki'', Warszawa 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/2291481.stm | work=BBC News | title=Nazi loot claim 'compelling' | date=October 2, 2002 | accessdate=May 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Looting, combined with poor [[military discipline]], has occasionally been an army's downfall.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} In other cases, for example the [[Wahhabi sack of Karbala]], loot has financed further victories.&lt;ref&gt;Wayne H. Bowen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=S6J2Q3TlJpMC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=z7xkfvrX_x&amp;sig=yg1NCeie86areM74Tp0N2ROwUf8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=f4cCTbnlLsL38AaO_dTrAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;f=false ''The History of Saudi Arabia''], Greenwood Publishing Group, 2008, p. 73. {{ISBN|0-313-34012-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all looters in wartime are conquerors; the looting of [[Vistula Land]] by its retreating defenders in 1915&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} Andrzej Garlicki, ''Z dziejów Drugiej Rzeczypospolitej'', Wydawnictwa Szkolne i Pedagogiczne, 1986, {{ISBN|83-02-02245-4}}, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; was among the factors sapping the loyalty of [[Poland in World War I]]. Local civilians can also take advantage of a breakdown of order to loot public and private property, such as took place at the [[National Museum of Iraq]] in the course of the [[Iraq War]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;STEVEN LEE MYERS, [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/24/world/middleeast/24museum.html Iraq Museum Reopens Six Years After Looting], New York Times, February 23, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]]'s novel ''[[War and Peace]]'' describes widespread looting by [[Moscow]]'s citizens before [[Napoleon]]'s troops enter the city, and by [[Grande Armée|French troops]] elsewhere.

====Prohibited under international law====
In [[armed conflict]], pillage is prohibited by both [[customary international law]] and by [[treaty]].&lt;ref name="ICRC"/&gt; The prohibition against pillage was recognized in the [[Lieber Code]], Brussels Declaration (1874), and Oxford Manual.&lt;ref name="ICRC"/&gt; The [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907]] ([[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict|modified in 1954]]) obliges military forces not only to avoid destruction of enemy property, but to provide protection to it.&lt;ref name=hague&gt;Barbara T. Hoffman, [https://books.google.com/books?id=yvXTcGC5CwQC&amp;pg=PA57 ''Art and Cultural Heritage: Law, Policy, and Practice''], Cambridge University Press, 2006, p. 57. {{ISBN|0-521-85764-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 8 of the [[Statute of the International Criminal Court]] provides that in international warfare, the "pillaging a town or place, even when taken by assault," is a [[war crime]].&lt;ref name="ICRC"/&gt; In the aftermath of [[World War II]], a number of war criminals were prosecuted for pillage. Several people have been prosecuted by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] for pillage.&lt;ref name="ICRC"/&gt;

The [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] of 1949 explicitly prohibits the looting of civilian property during wartime.&lt;ref name="ICRC"/&gt;&lt;ref name=gen&gt;E. Lauterpacht, C. J. Greenwood, Marc Weller, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5xVSkGtcT5YC&amp;pg=PA154 ''The Kuwait Crisis: Basic Documents''], Cambridge University Press, 1991, p. 154. {{ISBN|0-521-46308-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Theoretically, to prevent such looting, unclaimed property is moved to the custody of the [[Custodian of Enemy Property]], to be handled until being returned to its owner.

===Archaeological removals===
{{further information|Grave robbery}}
The term "looting" is also sometimes used to refer to [[antiquities]] being removed from countries by unauthorized people, either domestic people breaking the law seeking monetary gain, or by foreign nations, which are usually more interested in prestige or previously, "scientific discovery". An example of this might be the removal of the contents of Egyptian tombs which were transported to museums in Europe.&lt;ref name="pyramid"&gt;{{cite news
|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/10/061024-hawass.html
|publisher=National Geographic News
|title=Egypt's Antiquities Chief Combines Passion, Clout to Protect Artifacts
|date=October 24, 2006
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other examples include the obelisks of Pharaoh [[Amenhotep II]], in the (Oriental Museum, [[University of Durham]], United Kingdom), Pharaoh [[Ptolemy IX]], ([[Philae]] Obelisk, in Wimborne, Dorset, United Kingdom). Whether this constitutes "looting" is a debated point, with other parties pointing out that the Europeans were usually given permission of some sort, and that many of the treasures wouldn't have been discovered at all if the Europeans hadn't funded and organized the expeditions or digs that located them. Many of these antiquities have already been returned to their country of origin voluntarily.

===Looting of industry===
In the aftermath of the [[World War II|Second World War]], Soviet forces systematically plundered the [[Soviet occupation zone]] of Germany, including the [[Recovered Territories]] which were to be transferred to Poland. They sent valuable industrial equipment, infrastructure and whole factories to the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="IPN-MM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipn.gov.pl/biuletyn/13/biuletyn02_2.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050321165047/http://www.ipn.gov.pl/biuletyn/13/biuletyn02_2.html |title=MIĘDZY MODERNIZACJĄ A MARNOTRAWSTWEM |archivedate=2005-03-21 |publisher=[[Institute of National Remembrance]] |language=Polish }} See also [http://www.niniwa2.cba.pl/komunizm_gospodarka_prl_ipn.htm other copy online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070426011453/http://www.niniwa2.cba.pl/komunizm_gospodarka_prl_ipn.htm |date=2007-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IPN-Ś"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipn.gov.pl/biuletyn/4/biuletyn4_51.html|title=ARMIA CZERWONA NA DOLNYM ŚLĄSKU|publisher=[[Institute of National Remembrance]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050321233124/http://www.ipn.gov.pl/biuletyn/4/biuletyn4_51.html|archivedate=2005-03-21|language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measures against looting following disasters==
[[File:053 French Foreign Legion.JPG|thumb|[[Military of Côte d'Ivoire|FAFN]] soldier caught by French Foreign Legion troops.]]

During a disaster, police and military are sometimes unable to prevent looting when they are overwhelmed by humanitarian or combat concerns, or cannot be summoned due to damaged communications infrastructure. Especially during natural disasters, some people find themselves forced to take what is not theirs in order to survive. How to respond to this, and where the line between unnecessary "looting" and necessary "scavenging" lies, is often a dilemma for governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/136582.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Indonesian food minister tolerates looting | date=July 21, 1998 | accessdate=May 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, looting may be tolerated or even encouraged by governments for political or other reasons.

'''Massurrealism''' is a [[Portmanteau|portmanteau word]] coined in 1992 by American artist [[James Seehafer]],&lt;ref name="intute" /&gt; who described a trend among some [[postmodern art]]ists that mix the aesthetic styles and themes of [[surrealism]] and [[mass media]]&amp;mdash;including [[pop art]].&lt;ref name="intute"&gt;Adam. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110519201344/http://www.intute.ac.uk/cgi-bin/fullrecord.pl?handle=artifact1764 "massurrealism"], Intute:arts and humanities ([[University of Oxford]] and [[Manchester Metropolitan University]]), 17 October 2003.

==History==
[[Image:Seehafer-Untitled-1990.jpg|thumb|right|75px|SFX photography, digital collage]]
Massurrealism is a development of surrealism that emphasizes the effect of technology and mass media on contemporary surrealist imagery.&lt;ref name="intute" /&gt; James Seehafer who is credited with coining the term in 1992&lt;ref name="intute" /&gt; said that he was prompted to do so because there was no extant definition to accurately characterize the type of work he was doing, which combined elements of [[surrealism]] and [[mass media]], the latter consisting of [[technology]] and [[pop art]]&amp;mdash;"a form of technology art."&lt;ref name=lecture&gt;Seehafer, James. [http://www.spbu.ru/Structure/Culture/Museums/History/koi/art_diss.htm#20_06eng "Discussions: The Artist and Modern Society."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080608073616/http://www.spbu.ru/Structure/Culture/Museums/History/koi/art_diss.htm |date=2008-06-08 }}, lecture on Massurrealism at [[Saint Petersburg State University]], Saint Petersburg Russia, 20 June 2000. Retrieved 8 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He had begun his work by using a shopping cart, which "represented American mass-consumerism that fuels mass-media", and then incorporated collages of colour [[photocopy|photocopies]] and [[spray paint]]  with the artist's traditional medium of [[oil paint]].&lt;ref name=lecture/&gt;

In 1995, he assembled a small group show near [[New York City]] and found a local cyber-cafe, where he started to post material about massurrealism on internet arts news groups, inspiring some German art students to stage a massurrealist show.&lt;ref name=lecture/&gt; The next year he started his own web site, www.massurrealism.com and began to receive work from other artists, both mixed media and digitally-generated.&lt;ref name=lecture/&gt; He credits the World Wide Web with a major role in communicating massurrealism,&lt;ref name=lecture/&gt; which spread interest from artists in [[Los Angeles]], [[Mexico]]&lt;ref name=Itinerante&gt; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwo3VDEahCg "Conoce más sobre el MASSURREALISMO? - Mexico City"] Retrieved 21 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and then [[Europe]].&lt;ref name=Ketter&gt;[http://www.kettererkunst.de/lexikon/massurrealismus.php "Massurrealismus (Massurrealism)"], Ketterer Kunst Auction House, Munich Germany. Retrieved 21 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Seehafer has said:
{{cquote|I am not being credited with inventing a new technique, nor I don't think I should be credited with starting a new art movement, but rather simply coining a word to categorize the type of modern day surrealist art that had been lacking in definition. As a result, word "massurrealism" has received a lot of enthusiasm from artists. Though there are some who feel that defining something essentially limits it, the human condition has always had the need to categorize and classify everything in life.&lt;ref name=lecture/&gt;}} 

The differentiating factor, according to Seehafer, between surrealism and massurrealism is the foundation of the former in the early 20th century in Europe before the spread of electronic mass media.&lt;ref name=lecture/&gt; It is difficult to define the visual style of massurrealism, though a general characteristic is the use of modern technology to fuse surrealism's traditional access to the unconscious with pop art's ironic contradictions.&lt;ref name=amazon&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dfine-art&amp;field-keywords=Massurrealism&amp;rh=i%3Afine-art%2Ck%3AMassurrealism/ "Other Art and related items"], Retrieved 21 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Media manipulation''' is a series of related techniques in which partisans create an image or argument that favours their particular interests.&lt;ref name="Human Manipulation"&gt;{{cite book |last=Coxall |first=Malcolm |editor-last=Caswell |editor-first=Guy |date=2 Mar 2013 |title=Human Manipulation - A Handbook |url= |location= |publisher=Cornelio Books |page= |isbn=978-8-4940-8532-1 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such tactics may include the use of [[fallacy|logical fallacies]], [[Psychological manipulation|psychological manipulations]], outright deception, rhetorical and [[propaganda]] techniques, and often involve the [[information suppression|suppression of information]] or points of view by crowding them out, by inducing other people or groups of people to stop listening to certain arguments, or by simply diverting [[attention]] elsewhere. In ''[[Propaganda: The Formation of Men's Attitudes]]'', [[Jacques Ellul]] writes that [[public opinion]] can only express itself through channels which are provided by the [[mass media]] of communication – without which there could be no propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;Ellul, Jacques (1973). ''Propaganda: The Formation of Men's Attitudes'', Ch. 2.Trans. Konrad Kellen &amp; Jean Lerner. Vintage Books, New York. {{ISBN|978-0-394-71874-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
It is used within [[public relations]], propaganda, [[marketing]], etc. While the objective for each context is quite different, the broad techniques are often similar.

As illustrated below, many of the more modern mass media manipulation methods are types of [[distraction]], on the assumption that the public has a limited [[attention span]].

== Contexts ==

=== Activism ===
{{main|Activism}}
Activism is the practice or doctrine that has an emphasis on direct vigorous action especially supporting or opposing one side of a controversial matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/activism|title=Definition of Activism|last=|first=|date=2015|website=Merriam-Webster|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is quite simply starting a movement to effect or change social views. It is frequently started by influential individuals but is done collectively through [[social movement]]s with large masses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.permanentculturenow.com/what-is-activism/|title=What is Activism|last=|first=|date=2016|website=Permanent Culture Now|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These social movements can be done through public [[Demonstration (protest)|rallies]], [[strike action|strike]]s, street marches and even rants on [[social media]].

A large social movement that has changed public opinion through time would be the 'Civil Rights March on Washington', where [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] performed his 'I Have a Dream' speech attempting to change social views on Non-White Americans in the United States of Americ, 28 August 1963. Most of King's movements were done through non-violent rallies and public speeches to show the white American population that they were peaceful but also wanted change in their community. In 1964, the '[[Civil Rights Acts]]' commenced giving Non-White Americans equality with all races.

=== Advertising ===
[[File:Commercial-LBJ1964ElectionAdDaisyGirl.ogv|thumb|350px|thumbtime=3|"[[Daisy (advertisement)|Daisy]]", a TV commercial for the re-election of U.S. President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. It aired only once, in September 1964, and is considered both one of the most controversial and one of the most effective political ads in U.S. history.]]
{{main|Advertising}}
Advertising is the action of attracting public attention to something, especially through paid announcements for products and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://study.com/academy/lesson/what-is-advertising-definition-lesson-examples.html#transcriptHeader|title=What is Advertising|last=|first=|date=2016|website=Study.com|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tends to be done by businesses who wish to sell their product by paying media outlets to show their products or services on [[commercial break|television break]]s, [[web banner|banners on websites]] and [[mobile application]]s.

These advertisements are not only done by businesses but can also be done by certain groups. Non-commercial advertisers are those who spend money on advertising in a hope to raise awareness for a cause or promote specific ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/non-commercial-advertising.html|title=Non-commercial Advertising|last=|first=|date=2015|website=Business Dictionary|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include groups such as interest groups, political parties, government organizations and religious movements. Most of these organizations intend to spread a message or sway public opinion instead of trying to sell products or services. Advertising can not only be found on social media, it is also evident on billboards, newspapers, magazines and even word of mouth.

=== Hoaxing ===
{{main|Hoax}}
A hoax is something intended to deceive or defraud. When a newspaper or the news reports a fake story, it is known as a hoax. Misleading public stunts, [[scientific fraud]]s, false [[bomb threat]]s and business [[scam]]s as hoaxes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hoaxes.org/Hoaxipedia/What_is_a_hoax|title=What is a Hoax|last=|first=|date=2016|website=Hoaxipedia|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A common aspect that hoaxes have is that they are all meant to deceive or lie. For something to become a hoax, the lie must have something more to offer. It must be outrageous, dramatic but also has to be believable and ingenious. Above all, it must be able to attract attention from the public. Once it has done that then a hoax is in full effect.

The word hoax became popular in the middle to late eighteenth century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is thought to have come from the saying 'hocus pocus'. Hocus pocus means meaningless talk which is typically designed to trick others or conceal the truth about a situation. It is thought to be derived from a conjuror in the time of King James who called himself 'The Kings Majesties most excellent Hocus Pocus', where he would perform a trick and call out a phrase beginning with "hocus pocus".

The key word in something becoming a hoax is "public". A lie or a deception only becomes a hoax when it is acknowledged by the public. A popular hoax that is evident in today's times would be the 'Microwave your spoon' hoax. This hoax originated from a video which shows a metallic spoon being heated inside a microwave oven. It then further on suggests that it is easier to eat ice cream when the spoon is first microwaved. This hoax has fooled many people on social media into believing that the spoon could be microwaved, only to find that their microwave was damaged. The point of this hoax was to show how [[gullible]] people can be on social media and to prove that not everything you read or see on the internet is true.

An example of a hoax was a fake viral video is one that happened in 2012.&amp;nbsp;[[Greenpeace]]&amp;nbsp;paid to have a&amp;nbsp;[[video]]&amp;nbsp;made by&amp;nbsp;[[The Yes Men|Yes Men]]&amp;nbsp;and that&amp;nbsp;[[Occupy Seattle]]&amp;nbsp;posted on their&amp;nbsp;[[website]]. The video then took off and a lot of&amp;nbsp;[[Business|companies]]&amp;nbsp;and people shared it. The video was of a drink fountain that looked like an&amp;nbsp;[[oil platform]]&amp;nbsp;at a party for&amp;nbsp;[[Shell Oil Company|Shell]]&amp;nbsp;malfunctioning, and getting all over the party. The video then shows the a&amp;nbsp;[[man]]&amp;nbsp;telling the person holding the phone&amp;nbsp;[[camera]]&amp;nbsp;to stop filming while they are rushed out the door. There were also fake legal messages sent out to make it look like Shell was threatening the people reporting the story. It was very widespread and believed by many.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanholiday/2012/06/15/how-greenpeace-manipulated-the-media-like-a-pro-analyzing-the-shell-oil-hoax/#5f7cf740f779|title=How Greenpeace Manipulated the Media Like a Pro: Analyzing the Shell Oil Hoax|website=www.forbes.com|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Propagandising ===
{{main|Propaganda}}
Propagandising is a form of communication that is aimed at [[social influence|influencing]] the attitude of a community toward some cause or position by presenting only one side of an argument. Propaganda is commonly created by governments, but some forms of [[mass communication]] created by other powerful organisations can be considered propaganda as well. As opposed to [[Objectivity (journalism)|impartially]] providing information, propaganda, in its most basic sense, presents information primarily to influence an audience. Propaganda is usually repeated and dispersed over a wide variety of media in order to create the chosen result in audience attitudes. While the term propaganda has justifiably acquired a strongly negative connotation by association with its most manipulative and [[jingoistic]] examples (e.g. Nazi propaganda used to justify the Holocaust), propaganda in its original sense was neutral, and could refer to uses that were generally benign or innocuous, such as public health recommendations, signs encouraging citizens to participate in a census or election, or messages encouraging persons to report crimes to the police, among others.

Propaganda uses societal norms and myths that people hear and believe. Because people respond to, understand and remember more simple ideas this is what is used to influence people's beliefs, attitudes and values.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.stanford.edu/class/e297c/war_peace/media/hpropaganda.html|title=Media's Use of Propaganda to Persuade People's Attitude, Beliefs and Behaviors|website=web.stanford.edu|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychological warfare ===
{{main|Psychological warfare}}
Psychological warfare is sometimes considered synonymous with propaganda. The principal distinction being that propaganda normally occurs within a nation, whereas psychological warfare normally takes place between nations, often during war or [[Cold war (general term)|cold war]]. Various techniques are used to influence a target's [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]], [[belief]]s, [[emotion]]s, [[Base motive|motives]], [[reasoning]], or [[behavior]]. Target audiences can be [[government]]s, [[organization]]s, [[Group (sociology)|groups]], and [[individual]]s.

This tactic has been used in multiple [[war]]s throughout history. During [[World War II]], the [[Allies of World War II|western Allies]], expect for the [[Soviet Union]] would drop leaflets on the [[United States|US]] and [[England]]. During the [[Conflict (process)|conflict]] with [[Iraq]], American and England dropped leaflets on them, many of the leaflets telling the people how to surrender. In the [[Korean War]] both sides would use [[Loudspeaker|loud speakers]] from the front lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/psychological-warfare|title=psychological warfare|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-12-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 people in [[Israel]] in the [[Gaza War (2008–09)|Gaza war]] received text messages on their [[Mobile phone|cell phones]] threatening them with [[rocket]] attacks. The [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] people were getting [[Telephone|phone]] calls and leaflets warning them that they were going to drop rockets on them. These phone calls and leaflets were not always accurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/03/israelandthepalestinians-middleeast|title=Text messages and phone calls add psychological aspect to warfare in Gaza|last=Jerusalem|first=Hazem Balousha Toni O'Loughlin in|date=2009-01-03|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-12-03|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public relations ===
{{main|Public relations}}
Public relations (PR) is the management of the flow of [[information]] between an individual or an [[organization]] and the [[General public|public]]. Public relations may include an organization or [[individual]] gaining [[publicity|exposure]] to their audiences using topics of public interest and news items that do not require direct payment. PR is generally created by specialised individuals or firms at the behest of already public individuals or organizations, as a way of managing their public profile.

== Techniques ==
===Internet manipulation===
{{main|internet manipulation}}
==== Astroturfing ====
{{Main article|Astroturfing}}

Astroturfing is when there is an intent and attempt to create the illusion of support for a particular cause, person, or stance. While this is mainly connected to and seen on the internet, it has also happened in newspapers during times of political elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/feb/08/what-is-astroturfing|title=Astroturfing: what is it and why does it matter? {{!}} Adam Bienkov|last=Bienkov|first=Adam|date=2012-02-08|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-12-03|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;Corporations and political parties try to imitate&amp;nbsp;[[grassroots]]&amp;nbsp;movements in order to sway the public to believing something that isn't true.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/astroturfing-grassroots-movements-2011-9|title=10 Fake Grassroots Movements Started By Corporations To Sway Your Opinion|work=Business Insider|access-date=2017-12-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Clickbait ====
{{Main article|Clickbait}}

Clickbait refers to headlines of online news articles that are [[Sensationalism|sensationalized]] or sometimes completely [[fake news|fake]]. It uses people's natural curiosity to get people to click. In some cases clickbait is simply used to generate income, more clicks means more money made with advertisers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-34213693|title=Is clickbait changing journalism?|last=Frampton|first=Ben|date=2015-09-14|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-12-03|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; But these headlines and articles can also be used to influence a group of people on [[social media]]. They are constructed to appeal to the interest group's [[Confirmation bias|pre-existing biases]] and thus to be shared within [[filter bubble]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/11/18/this-is-how-the-internets-fake-news-writers-make-money/|title=Analysis {{!}} This is how Facebook’s fake-news writers make money|last=https://www.facebook.com/aohlheiser|website=Washington Post|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Search engine marketing ====
{{main|Search engine marketing}}
In search engine marketing [[websites]] use [[market research]], from past searches and other sources, to increase their visibility in [[search engine results page]]s. This allows them to guide search results along the lines they desire, and thereby influence searchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is Search Engine Optimization / SEO|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF515-0Tduk|website=Youtube: Search Engine Land|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ratliff|first1=James|last2=Rubinfeld|first2=Daniel|title=Is There a Market for Organic Search Engine Results and Can Their Manipulation Give Rise to Antitrust Liability?|journal=Journal of Competition Law and Economics|date=May 2014|pages=1–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Business have many tactics to lure customers into their websites and to generate revenue such as banner ads, [[search engine optimization]] and [[pay-per-click]] marketing tools. They all serve a different purpose and use different tools that appeal to multiple types of users. Banner ads appear on sites that then redirect to other sites that are similar. Search engine optimization is changing a page to seem more reliable or applicable than other similar pages. Pay-per-click involves certain words being highlighted because they were bought by advertisers to then redirect to a page containing information or selling whatever that word pertained to. By using the internet, users are susceptible to these type of advertisements without a clear advertising campaign being viewed.

=== Distraction ===

==== Distraction by major events ====
Commonly known as "smoke screen", this technique consists of making the public focus its attention on a topic that is more convenient for the propagandist. This particular type of media manipulation has been referenced many times in popular culture. Some examples are:

*The movie ''[[Wag the Dog]]'' (1997), which illustrates the public being deceitfully distracted from an important topic by presenting another that whose only quality is that of being more attractive.
*In the U.S. TV series ''[[House of Cards (U.S. TV series)|House of Cards]]'', when protagonist [[Frank Underwood (House of Cards)|Frank Underwood]] finds himself trapped in a media rampage, he addresses the viewer and says: "From the lion's den or a pack of wolves. When you're fresh meat, kill and throw them something fresher".
Politicians distract the public by showing them "shiny object" issues through the use of TV and other media. Sometimes they can be as simple as a politician with a reality show, like [[Sarah Palin]] had for a short time back in 2009, which aired on [[TLC (TV network)|TLC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/06/magazine/the-politics-of-distraction.html|title=The Politics of Distraction|last=Leibovich|first=Mark|date=2015-09-01|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-12-03|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==== Distracting the public ====
This a mere variation of the traditional arguments known, in [[logic]], as [[ad hominem]] and [[ad populum]] but applied to countries instead of individuals. This technique consists on refuting arguments by appealing to nationalism or by inspiring fear and hate towards a foreign country or to all the foreigners. It has the potential of being important since it gives the propagandists the power to discredit any information coming from other countries. 

Some examples are: 

Q: "What do you think about Khokara's politic on X matter?" A: "I think they've been wrong about everything for the last 20 years or so..." 

Q: "Your idea is quite similar to the one proposed in Falala." A: "Are you suggesting Falala is a better country than ours?"

==== Straw man fallacy ====
{{main|Straw man}}
An informal fallacy. The "straw man" consists on appearing to refute the opponent's argument while actually attacking another topic. For it to work properly the topic that was actually refuted and the one that should have been refuted need to be similar.

==== Distraction by scapegoat ==== 
{{main|Scapegoat}}
This is a combination of the straw man fallacy and the ad hominem argument. It is often used to incriminate someone in order to  argument the innocence of someone else. 

This is a very important tactic for governments and politicians, and it even made its way to the famous book ''[[The 48 Laws of Power]]'' by [[Robert Greene (American author)|Robert Greene]], in the Law #26 titled: "Keep you hands clean".

=== Photo manipulation ===
{{Main article|Photo manipulation}}

Visual media can be [[Image editing|transformed]] through photo manipulation, commonly called "photoshopping." This can make a product, person, or idea seem more appealing. This is done by highlighting certain features on the product and using certain editing tools to enlarge the photo, to attract and persuade the public.

===Video manipulation===
{{main|video manipulation}}


== Compliance professionals ==
A compliance professional is an expert that utilizes and perfects means of gaining media influence.  Though the means of gaining influence are common, their aims vary from political, economic, to personal.  Thus the label of compliance professional applies to diverse groups of people, including [[propagandists]], [[marketers]], [[pollsters]], [[salespeople]] and [[political advocates]].

=== Techniques ===
Means of influence include, but are not limited to, the methods outlined in ''[[Influence: Science and Practice]]'':
* [[Norm of reciprocity|Reciprocation]]
* [[Consistency (negotiation)|Commitment and consistency]]
* [[Social proof]]
* [[Superficial charm|Liking]]
* [[Authority]]
* [[Scarcity value|Scarcity]]
Additionally, techniques like [[Framing (social sciences)|framing]] and less formal means of effective obfuscation, such as the use of [[logical fallacies]], are used to gain compliance.

In '''philosophy''', '''moral conversion''' is an [[Existential humanism|existential]] [[Existential crisis|change]] in the person, who is perceived as the moral agent adopting new moral standards (or [[mores]]) in a process of internal transformation. Moral conversion is a relatively rare event in a person's normal development. It involves a decision that is both conscious and existentialist (i.e. based on critical questioning).{{sfn|Mac Laughlin|2008|p=194}} Moral conversion is based on the [[internalist]] view of [[morality]].{{sfn|Mac Laughlin|2008|p=7}}

==As an existential event==
The process of moral conversion was described by [[Lawrence Kohlberg]] of the [[University of Chicago]], who developed the so-called [[Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development]]. Six classes of moral conversion were identified, based on progressively higher and higher levels of moral reasoning, beginning with the ''preconventional'' level of a child, and concluding with the ''postconventional'' (or autonomous) level of an adult aware of ethical principles guiding universally moral behaviour.{{sfn|Mac Laughlin|2008|p=203}}

Notably, the notion of moral conversion has been distinguished from the theory of moral development ''per se'', by [[Walter E. Conn]] (of [[Villanova University]]) and [[John C. Gibbs]] (of the [[Ohio State University]]).{{sfn|Mac Laughlin|2008|p=205}} Moral conversion, according to Conn and Gibbs, involves critical questioning and therefore differs from any spontaneous moral development (Kohlberg). It results in the setting forth of the "self-chosen values" (Conn), which bring the existential dimension to the transforming process.{{sfn|Mac Laughlin|2008|p=219&amp;ndash;224}}

[[Alfredo J. Mac Laughlin]] of St. Ambrose University defines moral conversion by the frequent occurrence of the "{{nobreak|sharp-turn}} conversions" resulting from the presence of [[free will]], which differ from the natural/spontaneous development taking place in incremental stages (Kohlberg).{{sfn|Mac Laughlin|2008|p=234}} The most significant aspect of moral conversion is the withdrawal from the moral convictions of the past, which is based on "critical self-appropriation" or the ''critical'' discovery of oneself.{{sfn|Mac Laughlin|2008|p=250}} It depends on the sense of authenticity beyond the possibility of predictions.{{sfn|Mac Laughlin|2008|p=253}}

==As self-transcendence==
[[Bernard Lonergan]] explains that moral conversion is not moral perfection. It is the "withdrawal from self-enclosure" or the shift from personal satisfaction criterion to values that transcend oneself (or one's own group interests). Moral conversion, according to Lonergan, is one of three different types of conversion along with the ''intellectual'' and the [[Religious conversion|''religious'' conversion]].{{sfn|Conn|1982}} From a causal point of view, it is the difference between varying levels of consciousness leading to a higher sense of responsibility for the world.{{sfn|Doran|2011|p=13&amp;ndash;18}}

The '''People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs''' ({{lang|ru|Народный комиссариат внутренних дел}}, ''Narodnyy Komissariat Vnutrennikh Del''), abbreviated '''NKVD''' ({{lang|ru|НКВД}} {{Audio|ru-NKVD.ogg|listen}}), was the [[interior ministry]] of the [[Soviet Union]].

Established in 1917 as NKVD of Russian SFSR,&lt;ref name="semukhina74"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Semukhina|first1=Olga B.|last2=Reynolds|first2=Kenneth Michael|title=Understanding the Modern Russian Police|date=2013|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781482218879|page=74|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=idInAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT74|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; the agency was originally tasked with conducting regular police work and overseeing the country's prisons and labor camps.&lt;ref name="huskey"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huskey|first1=Eugene|title=Russian Lawyers and the Soviet State: The Origins and Development of the Soviet Bar, 1917-1939|date=2014|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9781400854516|page=230|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B7n_AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA230|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was disbanded in 1930, with its functions being dispersed among other agencies, only to be reinstated as an [[all-union ministry]] in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Semukhina|first1=Olga B.|last2=Reynolds|first2=Kenneth Michael|title=Understanding the Modern Russian Police|date=2013|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781439803493|page=58|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jAnMBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA58|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The functions of the [[OGPU]] (the [[secret police]] organization) were transferred to the NKVD in 1934, giving it a monopoly over law enforcement activities that lasted until the end of World War II.&lt;ref name="huskey"/&gt; During this period, the NKVD included both ordinary public order activities, as well as secret police activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Khlevniuk|first1=Oleg V.|title=Stalin: New Biography of a Dictator|date=2015|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300166941|page=125|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dy7CCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA125|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NKVD is known for its role in [[Soviet political repressions|political repression]] and for carrying out the [[Great Purge]] under [[Joseph Stalin]]. Mobile [[gas van]]s were used to execute people without trial during the Great Purge.&lt;ref&gt;Yevgenia Albats, KGB: The State Within a State. 1995, page 101&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Gellately.

The NKVD undertook mass [[extrajudicial execution]]s of untold numbers of citizens, and conceived, populated and administered the [[Gulag]] system of [[forced labour]] camps. Their agents were responsible for the repression of the wealthier peasantry, as well as the mass deportations of [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|entire nationalities]]  to uninhabited regions of the country. They oversaw the [[Soviet Border Troops|protection of Soviet borders]] and espionage (which included [[political assassination]]s), and enforced [[Marxism-Leninism|Soviet policy]] in communist movements and puppet governments in other countries, most notably the repression and massacres in [[Polish Operation of the NKVD|Poland]].

In March 1946 all People's Commissariats were renamed to Ministries, and the NKVD became the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Soviet Union)|Ministry of Internal Affairs]] (MVD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Statiev|first1=Alexander|title=The Soviet Counterinsurgency in the Western Borderlands|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521768337|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YIRSwRDVqu4C&amp;pg=PR15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and structure ==
{{main|Cheka|Chronology of Soviet secret police agencies}}
[[File:1924 yagoda menshinsky dsershinsky.jpg|thumb|Early NKVD leaders [[Genrikh Yagoda]], [[Vyacheslav Menzhinsky]] and [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]], 1924]]

After the Russian [[February Revolution]] of 1917, the [[Provisional Government]] dissolved the [[Tsar]]ist police and set up the ''People's [[Militsiya]]''. The subsequent Russian [[October Revolution]] of 1917 saw a seizure of state power led by [[Lenin]] and the [[Bolshevik]]s, who established a new [[Bolshevik]] regime, the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] (RSFSR). The Provisional Government's [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Russia)|Ministry of Internal Affairs]] (MVD), formerly under [[Georgy Lvov]] (from March 1917) and then under [[Nikolai Avksentiev]] (from {{OldStyleDate|6 August|1917|24 July}}) and Alexei Nikitin (from {{OldStyleDate|8 October|1917|25 September}}), turned into NKVD (People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs) under a People's Commissar. However, the NKVD apparatus was overwhelmed by duties inherited from MVD, such as the supervision of the local governments and firefighting, and the ''Workers' and Peasants' Militsiya'' staffed by proletarians was largely inexperienced and unqualified. Realizing that it was left with no capable security force, the [[Council of People's Commissars]] of the RSFSR established ({{OldStyleDate|20 December|1917|7 December}}) a secret political police, the ''[[Cheka]]'', led by [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]]. It gained the right to undertake quick non-judicial trials and executions, if that was deemed necessary in order to "protect the Russian Socialist-[[Communist]] revolution".

The ''Cheka'' was reorganized in 1922 as the [[State Political Directorate]], or GPU, of the NKVD of the RSFSR.&lt;ref name="Malcher0"&gt;Blank Pages by G.C.Malcher {{ISBN|1-897984-00-6}} Page 7&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922 the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] formed, with the RSFSR as its largest member. The GPU became the [[OGPU]] (Joint State Political Directorate), under the [[Council of People's Commissars]] of the USSR. The NKVD of the RSFSR retained control of the ''militsiya'', and various other responsibilities.

In 1934 the NKVD of the RSFSR was transformed into an all-union security force, the NKVD (which the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] leaders soon came to call "the leading detachment of our party"), and the OGPU was incorporated into the NKVD as the [[Main Directorate for State Security (USSR)|Main Directorate for State Security]] (GUGB); the separate NKVD of the RSFSR was not resurrected until 1946 (as the MVD of the RSFSR). As a result, the NKVD also took over control of all detention facilities (including the forced labor camps, known as the [[GULag]]) as well as the regular police. At various times, the NKVD had the following Chief Directorates, abbreviated as "ГУ"– {{lang|ru|Главное управление}}, {{lang|ru-Latn|Glavnoye upravleniye}}.
:ГУГБ – государственной безопасности, of State Security ([[GUGB]], {{lang|ru-Latn|Glavnoye upravleniye gosudarstvennoi bezopasnosti}})
:ГУРКМ– рабоче-крестьянской милиции, of Workers and Peasants ''[[Militsiya]]'' ([[GURKM]], {{lang|ru-Latn|Glavnoye upravleniye raboče-krest'yanskoi militsyi}})
:ГУПВО– пограничной и внутренней охраны, of Border and Internal Guards ([[GUPVO]], {{lang|ru-Latn|GU pograničnoi i vnytrennei okhrany}})
:ГУПО– пожарной охраны, of Firefighting Services ([[GUPO]], {{lang|ru-Latn|GU požarnoi okhrany}})
:ГУШосДор– шоссейных дорог, of Highways([[GUŠD]], {{lang|ru-Latn|GU šosseynykh dorog}})
:ГУЖД– железных дорог, of Railways ([[GUŽD]], {{lang|ru-Latn|GU železnykh dorog}})
:ГУЛаг– Главное управление исправительно-трудовых лагерей и колоний, ([[GULag]], {{lang|ru-Latn|Glavnoye upravleniye ispravitelno-trudovykh lagerey i kolonii}})
:ГЭУ  – экономическое, of Economics (GEU, {{lang|ru-Latn|Glavnoye ekonomičeskoie upravleniye}})
:ГТУ  – транспортное, of Transport (GTU, {{lang|ru-Latn|Glavnoye transportnoie upravleniye}})
:ГУВПИ – военнопленных и интернированных, of [[POW]]s and interned persons ([[GUVPI]], {{lang|ru-Latn|Glavnoye upravleniye voyennoplennikh i internirovannikh}})

===Yezhov era===
[[File:Ezhov.PNG|upright|thumb|[[Nikolai Yezhov]], head of the NKVD from 1936–1939]]

Until the reorganization begun by [[Nikolai Yezhov]] with a purge of the regional political police in the autumn of 1936 and formalized by a May 1939 directive of the All-Union NKVD by which all appointments to the local political police were controlled from the center, there was frequent tension between centralized control of local units and the collusion of those units with local and regional party elements, frequently resulting in the thwarting of Moscow's plans.&lt;ref&gt;
James Harris, "[http://www.cairn.info/article.php?ID_ARTICLE=CMR_422_0423 Dual subordination ? The political police and the party in the Urals region, 1918–1953]", ''Cahiers du monde russe'' 22 (2001):423–446.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Following its establishment in 1934, the NKVD underwent many organizational changes; between 1938 and 1939 alone, the NKVD's structure and leadership changed three times.{{fact|date=December 2017}}

During Yezhov's time in office,  the [[Great Purge]] reached its height from the years 1937 and 1938 alone, at least 1.3 million were arrested and 681,692 were executed for 'crimes against the state'. The Gulag population swelled by 685,201 under Yezhov, nearly tripling in size in just two years, with at least 140,000 of these prisoners (and likely many more) dying of malnutrition, exhaustion and the elements in the camps (or during transport to them).&lt;ref&gt;Figes, Orlando (2007) ''The Whisperers: Private Life in Stalin's Russia'' {{ISBN|0-8050-7461-9}}, page 234.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 February 1941, the 4th Department (Special Section, OO) of GUGB NKVD security service responsible for the Soviet Armed Forces military counter-intelligence,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.documentstalk.com/wp/gugb GUGB NKVD.] DocumentsTalk.com, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; consisting of 12 Sections and one Investigation Unit, was separated from GUGB NKVD USSR.&lt;br&gt; The official liquidation of OO GUGB within NKVD was announced on 12 February by a joint order № 00151/003 of NKVD and NKGB USSR. The rest of GUGB was abolished and staff was moved to newly created [[People's Commissariat for State Security]] (NKGB). Departments of former GUGB were renamed Directorates. For example, foreign intelligence unit known as Foreign Department (shortcut- INO) became Foreign Directorate (INU); GUGB political police unit represented by Secret Political Department (SPO) became Secret Political Directorate (SPU), and so on. The former GUGB 4th Department (OO) was split into three sections. One section, which handled military counter-intelligence in NKVD troops (former 11th Section of GUGB 4th Department OO) become 3rd NKVD Department or OKR (Otdel KontrRazvedki), the chief of OKR NKVD was Aleksander Belyanov.&lt;br&gt; 
After the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion]] of the Soviet Union (June 1941),the NKGB USSR was abolished  and on July 20, 1941 the units that formed NKGB becomes  part of NKVD USSR. The military CI was also upgraded from department to directorate and pot in NKVD organization as (Directorate of Special Departments or UOO NKVD USSR). The only section  did not return to UOO NKVD till 11 of January 1942 was one responsible for counterintelligence in NKVMF (Navy). It returned to NKVD control in January 11 1942 as UOO 9th Department controlled by P. Gladkov. . In April 1943 Directorate of Special Departments was transformed in to SMERSH and transferred to People's Defense and Commissariates.  
The same time, the NKVD was reduced in size and duties  again by creating  NKGB as independent State 
Security  Commissariate.  
In 1946, all Soviet Commissariats were renamed "ministries". Accordingly, the Peoples Commissariat of Internal Affairs (NKVD) of the USSR became the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Soviet Union)|Ministry of Internal Affairs]] (MVD), while the NKGB was renamed as the [[Ministry for State Security (Soviet Union)|Ministry of State Security]] (MGB). In 1953, after the arrest of [[Lavrenty Beria]], the MGB merged back into the MVD. The police and security services finally split in 1954 to become:

* The USSR Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), responsible for the criminal militia and [[prison|correctional facilities]].
* The USSR Committee for State Security ([[KGB]]), responsible for the [[political police]], intelligence, counter-intelligence, personal protection (of the leadership) and confidential communications.

===Main Directorates (Departments)===
* [[Main Directorate of State Security|State Security]]
* Workers-Peasants Militsiya
* Border and Internal Security
* Firefighting security
* [[Gulag|Correction and Labor camps]]
* ''Other smaller departments''
** Department of Civil registration
** Financial (FINO)
** Administration
** Human resources
** Secretariat
** Special assignment

== NKVD activities ==
The main function of the NKVD was to protect the [[state security]] of the Soviet Union. This role was accomplished through massive [[political repression]], including authorised murders of many thousands of politicians and citizens, as well as kidnappings, assassinations and mass deportations.

===Domestic repressions===
[[File:Yagoda kanal Moskva Volga.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|NKVD chief [[Genrikh Yagoda]] (middle) inspecting the construction of the [[Moscow Canal|Moscow-Volga canal]], 1935]]
{{see also|Political repression in the Soviet Union}}

In implementing Soviet internal policy towards perceived enemies of the Soviet state ("[[enemies of the people]]"), untold multitudes of people were sent to GULAG camps and hundreds of thousands were executed by the NKVD. Formally, most of these people were convicted by [[NKVD troika]]s ("triplets")– special [[court martial|courts martial]]. Evidential standards were very low: a tip-off by an anonymous informer was considered sufficient grounds for arrest. Use of "physical means of persuasion" (torture) was sanctioned by a special decree of the state, which opened the door to numerous abuses, documented in recollections of victims and members of the NKVD itself. Hundreds of [[Mass graves in the Soviet Union|mass graves]] resulting from such operations were later discovered throughout the country. Documented evidence exists that the NKVD committed mass extrajudicial executions, guided by secret "plans". Those plans established the number and proportion of victims (officially "public enemies") in a given region (e.g. the quotas for clergy, former [[nobility|nobles]] etc., regardless of identity). The families of the repressed, including children, were also automatically repressed according to [[Order about Family Members of Traitors of the Motherland|NKVD Order no. 00486]].

The purges were organized in a number of waves according to the decisions of the [[Politburo]] of the Communist Party.  Some examples are the campaigns among engineers ([[Shakhty Trial]]), party and military elite plots ([[Great Purge]] with [[NKVD Order No. 00447|Order 00447]]), and medical staff ("[[Doctors' Plot]]").

A number of [[mass operations of the NKVD]] were related to the prosecution of whole ethnic categories. For example, the [[Polish Operation of the NKVD (1937–38)|Polish Operation]] of the NKVD in 1937–1938 resulted in the execution of 111,091 Poles.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Wendy Z. (2011). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=D0_HYK8R-8IC&amp;pg=PA217 Inventing the Enemy: Denunciation and Terror in Stalin's Russia.]'' New York: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-19196-8}}. p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt;  Whole populations of certain ethnicities [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|were forcibly resettled]]. Foreigners living in the Soviet Union were given particular attention. When disillusioned American citizens living in the Soviet Union thronged the gates of the U.S. embassy in Moscow to plead for new U.S. passports to leave USSR (their original U.S. passports had been taken for 'registration' purposes years before), none were issued. Instead, the NKVD promptly arrested all of the Americans, who were taken to [[Lubyanka Prison]] and later shot.&lt;ref&gt;Tzouliadis, Tim, ''The Forsaken: An American Tragedy in Stalin's Russia'' Penguin Press (2008), {{ISBN|1-59420-168-4}}: Many of the Americans desiring to return home were communists who had voluntarily moved to the Soviet Union, while others moved to Soviet Union as skilled auto workers to help produce cars at the recently constructed GAZ automobile factory built by the [[Ford Motor Company]]. All were U.S. citizens.&lt;/ref&gt; American factory workers at the Soviet Ford [[GAZ]] plant, suspected by Stalin of being 'poisoned' by Western influences, were dragged off with the others to Lubyanka by the NKVD in the very same Ford [[Ford Model A (1927-1931)|Model A]] cars they had helped build, where they were tortured; nearly all were executed or died in labor camps. Many of the slain Americans were dumped in the mass grave at [[Yuzhnoye Butovo District]] near Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;Tzouliadis, Tim, ''The Forsaken: An American Tragedy in Stalin's Russia'' Penguin Press (2008), {{ISBN|1-59420-168-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, the people of the [[Soviet Republics]] still formed the majority of NKVD victims[*17][*18].

The NKVD also served as arm of the Russian Soviet communist government for the lethal mass persecution and destruction of ethnic minorities and religious beliefs, such as the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church]], the [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Greek Catholics]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]] and other religious organizations, an operation headed by [[Yevgeny Tuchkov]].

===International operations===
[[File:Lavrenti Beria Stalins family.jpg|thumb|[[Lavrentiy Beria]] with [[Stalin]] (in background) and Stalin's daughter Svetlana]]
During the 1930s, the NKVD was responsible for political murders of those Stalin believed to oppose him. Espionage networks headed by experienced multilingual NKVD officers such as [[Pavel Sudoplatov]] and [[Iskhak Akhmerov]] were established in nearly every major Western country, including the United States. The NKVD recruited agents for its espionage efforts from all walks of life, from unemployed intellectuals such as [[Mark Zborowski]] to aristocrats such as [[Martha Dodd]]. Besides the gathering of intelligence, these networks provided organizational assistance for so-called ''wet business'',&lt;ref&gt;Barmine, Alexander, ''One Who Survived'', New York: G.P. Putnam (1945), p. 18: NKVD expression for a political murder&lt;/ref&gt; where enemies of the USSR either disappeared or were openly liquidated.&lt;ref&gt;John Earl Haynes and Harvey Klehr, ''Venona: Decoding Soviet Espionage in America'', (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

The NKVD's [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] and ''[[special operations]]'' (''Inostranny Otdel'') unit organized overseas assassinations of political enemies of the USSR, such as leaders of nationalist movements, former Tsarist officials, and personal rivals of [[Joseph Stalin]]. Among the officially confirmed victims of such plots were:

* [[Leon Trotsky]], a personal political enemy of Stalin and his most bitter international critic, killed in Mexico City in 1940;
* [[Yevhen Konovalets]], prominent [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] patriot leader who was attempting to create a separatist movement in Soviet Ukraine; assassinated in [[Rotterdam]], Netherlands
*[[Yevgeny Miller]], former General of the Tsarist (Imperial Russian) Army; in the 1930s, he was responsible for funding anti-communist movements inside the USSR with the support of European governments. Kidnapped in Paris and brought to Moscow, where he was interrogated and executed
* [[Noe Ramishvili]], Prime Minister of independent [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], fled to France after the Bolshevik takeover; responsible for funding and coordinating Georgian nationalist organizations and the [[August uprising]], he was assassinated in Paris
* [[Boris Savinkov]], Russian revolutionary and anti-Bolshevik terrorist (lured back into Russia and killed in 1924 by the [[Trust Operation]] of the [[State Political Directorate|GPU]]);
* [[Sidney Reilly]], British agent of the [[MI6]] who deliberately entered Russia in 1925 trying to expose the [[Trust Operation]] to avenge Savinkov's death;
* [[Alexander Kutepov]], former General of the Tsarist (Imperial Russian) Army, who was active in organizing anti-communist groups with the support of French and British governments

Prominent political dissidents were also found dead under highly suspicious circumstances, including [[Walter Krivitsky]], [[Lev Sedov]], [[Ignace Reiss]] and former German Communist Party (KPD) member [[Willi Münzenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;Barmine, Alexander, ''One Who Survived'', New York: G.P.

The pro-Soviet leader [[Sheng Shicai]] in Xinjiang received NKVD assistance in conducting a purge to coincide with Stalin's [[Great Purge]] in 1937. Sheng and the Soviets alleged a massive Trotskyist conspiracy and a "Fascist Trotskyite plot" to destroy the Soviet Union. The Soviet Consul General Garegin Apresoff, General [[Ma Hushan]], [[Ma Shaowu]], Mahmud Sijan, the official leader of the Xinjiang province Huang Han-chang and [[Hoja-Niyaz]] were among the 435 alleged conspirators in the plot. Xinjiang came under virtual Soviet control. Stalin opposed the Chinese Communist Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IAs9AAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=warlords+and+muslims#v=snippet&amp;q=fascist%20trotskyite%20plotters&amp;f=false|title=Warlords and Muslims in Chinese Central Asia: a political history of Republican Sinkiang 1911–1949|author=Andrew D.

===Spanish Civil War===

During the [[Spanish Civil War]], NKVD agents, acting in conjunction with the [[Communist Party of Spain]], exercised substantial control over the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican]] government, using Soviet military aid to help further Soviet influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert W. Pringle|title=Historical Dictionary of Russian and Soviet Intelligence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J9RQCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA288|year=2015|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |pages=288–89|isbn=9781442253186}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NKVD established numerous secret prisons around the capital [[Madrid]], which were used to detain, torture, and kill hundreds of the NKVD's enemies, at first focusing on [[Francoist Spain|Spanish Nationalists]] and [[Red Terror (Spain)|Spanish Catholics]], while from late 1938 increasingly anarchists and [[Leon Trotsky|Trotskyists]] were the objects of persecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Andrew|title=The Sword and the Shield: The Mitrokhin Archive and the Secret History of the KGB|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9TWUAQ7Xof8C&amp;pg=PA73|year=2000|publisher=Basic Books|page=73|isbn=9780465003129}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937 [[Andrés Nin]], the secretary of the [[Workers' Party of Marxist Unification|Trotskyist POUM]] and his colleagues were tortured and killed in an NKVD prison in Barcelona.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Clay Large|title=Between Two Fires: Europe's Path in the 1930s|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_t-7jUEjQi8C&amp;pg=PA308|year=1991|publisher=W.W. Norton|page=308|isbn=9780393307573}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II operations===
[[File:Victims of Soviet NKVD in Lvov, June 1941.jpg|thumb|The corpses of victims of the NKVD murdered in last days of June 1941, in one of the [[NKVD prisoner massacres]] just after outbreak of the German-Soviet War.]]

Prior to the German invasion, in order to accomplish its own goals, the NKVD was prepared to cooperate even with such organizations as the German [[Gestapo]]. In March 1940 representatives of the NKVD and the Gestapo met for one week in [[Zakopane]], to coordinate the pacification of Poland; ''see [[Gestapo-NKVD Conferences|Gestapo–NKVD Conferences]]''. For its part, the Soviet Union delivered hundreds of German and Austrian Communists to the Gestapo, as unwanted foreigners, together with their documents. However, many NKVD units were later to fight the Wehrmacht, for example the [[10th Rifle Division NKVD]], which fought at the [[Battle of Stalingrad]].

After the German invasion the NKVD [[NKVD prisoner massacres|evacuated and killed prisoners]].

During World War II, NKVD [[Internal Troops]] units were used for rear area security, including preventing the retreat of Soviet Union army divisions. Though mainly intended for internal security, NKVD divisions were sometimes used at the front to stem the occurrence of [[desertion]] through Stalin's [[Order No. 270]] and [[Order No. 227]] decrees in 1941 and 1942, which aimed to raise troop morale via brutality and coercion. At the beginning of the war the NKVD formed 15 rifle divisions, which had expanded by 1945 to 53 divisions and 28 brigades.&lt;ref name=zaloga&gt;Zaloga, Steven J. ''The Red Army of the Great Patriotic War, 1941–45'', Osprey Publishing, (1989), pp. 21–22&lt;/ref&gt;  A list of identified NKVD Internal Troops divisions can be seen at [[List of Soviet Union divisions]]. Though mainly intended for internal security, NKVD divisions were sometimes used in the front-lines, for example during the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] and the [[Crimean Offensive (1944)|Crimean Offensive of 1944]].&lt;ref name=zaloga/&gt; Unlike the [[Waffen-SS]], the NKVD did not field any armored or mechanized units.&lt;ref name=zaloga/&gt;

In the enemy-held territories, the NKVD carried out numerous missions of sabotage. After fall of [[Kiev]], NKVD agents set fire to the Nazi headquarters and various other targets, eventually burning down much of the city center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Birstein|first1=Vadim|title=Smersh: Stalin's Secret Weapon|date=2013|publisher=Biteback Publishing|isbn=978-1849546898|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kg2uAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT589&amp;dq=NKVD+sabotage+kiev#v=onepage&amp;q=NKVD%20sabotage%20kiev&amp;f=false|accessdate=4 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar actions took place across the occupied Byelorussia and Ukraine.

The NKVD (later [[KGB]]) carried out mass arrests, deportations, and executions. The targets included both collaborators with Germany and non-Communist [[resistance movement]]s such as the Polish [[Armia Krajowa]] and the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]] aiming to separate from the Soviet Union, among others. The NKVD also executed tens of thousands of [[NKVD massacres of prisoners|Polish political prisoners]] in 1939–1941, including the [[Katyń massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.sovietstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/soviet-story-press-kit-march-2010.pdf |title=History Documentary film: The Soviet Story |author=Edvins Snore |year=2008 |publisher=SIA Labvakar |location=Riga, Latvia |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140824074927/http://www.sovietstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/soviet-story-press-kit-march-2010.pdf |archivedate=August 24, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://thepeoplescube.com/peoples-blog/the-soviet-story-a-must-see-for-all-students-of-history-t13314.html|title=History Documentary – A Must See For All Students of History|author=Red Square|year=2014|publisher=The Peoples Cube|accessdate=2014-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; NKVD units were also used to repress the prolonged partisan war in [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army|Ukraine]] and the [[Forest Brothers|Baltics]], which lasted until the early 1950s.

===Postwar operations===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}
After the death of Stalin in 1953, the new Soviet leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]] halted the NKVD purges. From the 1950s to the 1980s, thousands of victims were legally "rehabilitated" (i.e., acquitted and had their rights restored). Many of the victims and their relatives refused to apply for rehabilitation out of fear or lack of documents. The rehabilitation was not complete: in most cases the formulation was "due to lack of evidence of the case of crime". Only a limited number of persons were rehabilitated with the formulation "cleared of all charges".

Very few NKVD agents were ever officially convicted of the particular violation of anyone's rights. Legally, those agents executed in the 1930s were also "purged" without legitimate criminal investigations and court decisions. In the 1990s and 2000s (decade) a small number of ex-NKVD agents living in the [[Baltic states]] were convicted of crimes against the local population.

===Intelligence activities===
These included:

* Establishment of a widespread spy network through the [[Comintern]].
* Operations of [[Richard Sorge]], the "[[Red Orchestra (spy)|Red Orchestra]]", [[Willi Lehmann]], and other agents who provided valuable intelligence during World War II.
* Recruitment of important UK officials as agents in the 1940s.
* Penetration of British intelligence ([[MI6]]) and counter-intelligence ([[MI5]]) services.
* Collection of detailed nuclear weapons design information from the U.S. and Britain.
* Disruption of several confirmed plots to assassinate Stalin.
* Establishment of the [[People's Republic of Poland]] and earlier its communist party along with training activists, during World War II. The first President of Poland after the war was [[Bolesław Bierut]], an NKVD agent.

=== Soviet economy ===
[[File:Korolev posle aresta 1938.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sergei Korolev]] shortly after his arrest, 1938]]
The extensive system of labor exploitation in the [[Gulag]] made a notable contribution to the Soviet economy and the development of remote areas. Colonization of Siberia, the North and Far East was among the explicitly stated goals in the very first laws concerning Soviet [[labor camp]]s. Mining, construction works (roads, railways, canals, dams, and factories), logging, and other functions of the labor camps were part of the Soviet [[planned economy]], and the NKVD had its own production plans.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

The most unusual part of the NKVD's achievements was its role in Soviet science and arms development. Many scientists and engineers arrested for political crimes were placed in special prisons, much more comfortable than the Gulag, colloquially known as ''[[sharashka]]s''. These prisoners continued their work in these prisons. When later released, some of them became world leaders in science and technology. Among such ''sharashka'' members were [[Sergey Korolev]], the head designer of the Soviet rocket program and first human space flight mission in 1961, and [[Andrei Tupolev]], the famous airplane designer. [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] was also imprisoned in a sharashka, and based his novel ''[[The First Circle]]'' on his experiences there.

After World War II, the NKVD coordinated work on Soviet nuclear weaponry, under the direction of General [[Pavel Sudoplatov]]. The scientists were not prisoners, but the project was supervised by the NKVD because of its great importance and the corresponding requirement for absolute security and secrecy. Also, the project used information obtained by the NKVD from the United States.

==People's Commissars==
The agency was headed by a people's commissar (minister). His first deputy was the director of State Security Service (GUGB).
* 1934–1936 [[Genrikh Yagoda]], both people's commissar of Interior and director of State Security
* 1936–1938 [[Nikolai Yezhov]], people's commissar of Interior
** 1936–1937 [[Yakov Agranov]], director of State Security (as the first deputy)
** 1937–1938 [[Mikhail Frinovsky]], director of State Security (as the first deputy)
** 1938 [[Lavrentiy Beria]], director of State Security (as the first deputy)
* 1938–1945 [[Lavrentiy Beria]], people's commissar of Interior
** 1938–1941 [[Vsevolod Merkulov]], director of State Security (as the first deputy)
** 1941–1943 [[Vsevolod Merkulov]], director of State Security (as the first deputy)
* 1945–1946 [[Sergei Kruglov (politician)|Sergei Kruglov]], people's commissar of Interior
''Note: In the first half of 1941 Vsevolod Merkulov transformed his agency into separate commissariat (ministry), but it was merged back to the people's commissariat of Interior soon after the [[Operation Barbarossa|Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union]]. In 1943 Merkulov once again split his [[Ministry of State Security (Soviet Union)|agency]] this time for good.''

==Officers==
Andrei Zhukov has singlehandedly identified every single NKVD officer involved in 1930s arrests and killings by researching a Moscow archive. There are just over 40,000 names on the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/06/stalin-secret-police-killings-crimes-russia-terror-nkvd|title=Stalin's secret police finally named but killings still not seen as crimes|last=Walker|first=Shaun|date=6 February 2017|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ideal feedback model.svg|thumb | right | A simple negative feedback system descriptive, for example, of some electronic amplifiers. The feedback is negative if the [[loop gain]] AB is negative.]]

'''Negative feedback''' (or balancing feedback) occurs when some [[function (Mathematics)|function]] of the output of a system, process, or mechanism is [[feedback|fed back]] in a manner that tends to reduce the fluctuations in the output, whether caused by changes in the input or by other disturbances.

Whereas [[positive feedback]] tends to lead to instability via [[exponential growth]], [[oscillation]] or [[chaos theory|chaotic behavior]], negative feedback generally promotes stability. Negative feedback tends to promote a settling to [[List of types of equilibrium|equilibrium]], and reduces the effects of perturbations. Negative [[feedback loop]]s in which just the right amount of correction is applied with optimum timing can be very stable, accurate, and responsive.

Negative feedback is widely used in mechanical and electronic engineering, and also within living organisms,&lt;ref name=Ashby&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and can be seen in many other fields from chemistry and economics to physical systems such as the climate. General negative feedback systems are studied in [[Control engineering|control systems engineering]].

== Examples ==
* [[Thermostat#History|Mercury thermostats]] (circa 1600) using expansion and contraction of columns of mercury in response to temperature changes were used in negative feedback systems to control vents in furnaces, maintaining a steady internal temperature.
* In the [[Invisible hand|invisible hand of the market]] metaphor of economic theory (1776), reactions to price movements provide a feedback mechanism to match [[supply (economics)|supply]] and [[demand]].
* In [[centrifugal governor]]s (1788), negative feedback is used to maintain a near-constant speed of an engine, irrespective of the load or fuel-supply conditions.
* In a [[steering engine]] (1866), power assistance is applied to the rudder with a feedback loop, to maintain the direction set by the steersman.
* In [[servomechanisms]], the [[speed]] or position of an output, as determined by a [[sensor]], is compared to a set value, and any error is reduced by negative feedback to the input.
* In [[Sound|audio]] [[amplifiers]], negative feedback reduces [[distortion]], minimises the effect of manufacturing variations in component parameters, and compensates for changes in characteristics due to temperature change.
* In [[analog computing]] feedback around [[operational amplifiers]] is used to generate [[mathematical functions]] such as [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[Integral|integration]], [[Derivative|differentiation]], [[logarithm]], and [[antilog]] functions.
* In a [[phase locked loop]] (1932) feedback is used to maintain a generated alternating waveform in a constant phase to a reference signal. In many implementations the generated waveform is the output, but when used as a [[demodulator]] in an [[FM broadcasting|FM]] radio receiver, the error feedback voltage serves as the demodulated output signal. If there is a [[frequency divider]] between the generated waveform and the phase comparator, the device acts as a [[frequency multiplier]].
* In [[organisms]], feedback enables various measures (e.g. body temperature, or [[blood sugar]] level) to be maintained within a desired range by [[homeostatic]] processes.

== History ==
Negative feedback as a control technique may be seen in the refinements of the [[water clock]] introduced by [[Ctesibius|Ktesibios]] of Alexandria in the 3rd century BCE. Self-regulating mechanisms have existed since antiquity, and were used to maintain a constant level in the reservoirs of water clocks as early as 200 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Breedveld | first1 = Peter C | year = 2004 | title = Port-based modeling of mechatronic systems | url = | journal = Mathematics and Computers in Simulation | volume = 66 | issue = 2| pages = 99–128 | doi=10.1016/j.matcom.2003.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Centrifugal governor.png|thumb|The [[Centrifugal governor|fly-ball governor]] is an early example of negative feedback.]]
Negative feedback was implemented in the 17th Century. [[Cornelius Drebbel]] had built [[Thermostat#History|thermostatically-controlled]] incubators and ovens in the early 1600s,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.drebbel.net/Tierie.pdf|title=Tierie, Gerrit. Cornelis Drebbel. Amsterdam: HJ Paris, 1932.|accessdate=2013-05-03}}

and [[centrifugal governor]]s were used to regulate the distance and pressure between [[millstone]]s in [[windmill]]s.&lt;ref&gt;
{{citation|last=Hills|first=Richard L|title=Power From the Wind|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1996}}
&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Watt]] patented a form of governor in 1788 to control the speed of his [[steam engine]], and [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in 1868 described "component motions" associated with these governors that lead to a decrease in a disturbance or the amplitude of an oscillation.&lt;ref name=maxwell&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "[[feedback]]" was well established by the 1920s, in reference to a means of [[Regenerative circuit|boosting the gain]] of an electronic amplifier.&lt;ref name=mindell&gt;

Nyquist and Bode built on Black’s work to develop a theory of amplifier stability.&lt;ref name=BennettS/&gt;

Early researchers in the area of [[cybernetics]] subsequently generalized the idea of negative feedback to cover any goal-seeking or purposeful behavior.&lt;ref name=Rosenblueth&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|text=All purposeful behavior may be considered to require negative feed-back. If a goal is to be attained, some signals from the goal are necessary at some time to direct the behavior.}}
Cybernetics pioneer [[Norbert Wiener]] helped to formalize the concepts of feedback control, defining feedback in general as "the chain of the transmission and return of information",&lt;ref name=wiener&gt;
Norbert Wiener ''[[Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine]]''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: The Technology Press; New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; and negative feedback as the case when:
{{quote|text=The information fed back to the control center tends to oppose the departure of the controlled from the controlling quantity...{{rp|page=97}}}}
While the view of feedback as any "circularity of action" helped to keep the theory simple and consistent, [[William Ross Ashby|Ashby]] pointed out that, while it may clash with definitions that require a "materially evident" connection, "the exact definition of feedback is nowhere important".&lt;ref name=Ashby/&gt; Ashby pointed out the limitations of the concept of "feedback":
{{quote|text=The concept of 'feedback', so simple and natural in certain elementary cases, becomes artificial and of little use when the interconnections between the parts become more complex...Such complex systems cannot be treated as an interlaced set of more or less independent feedback circuits, but only as a whole. For understanding the general principles of dynamic systems, therefore, the concept of feedback is inadequate in itself. What is important is that complex systems, richly cross-connected internally, have complex behaviors, and that these behaviors can be goal-seeking in complex patterns. {{rp|page=54}} }}

== Overview ==
[[Image:105 Negative Feedback Loops.jpg|thumb|right|Feedback loops in the human body]]

In many physical and biological systems, qualitatively different influences can oppose each other. For example, in biochemistry, one set of chemicals drives the system in a given direction, whereas another set of chemicals drives it in an opposing direction. If one or both of these opposing influences are non-linear, equilibrium point(s) result.

In [[biology]], this process (in general, [[biochemistry|biochemical]]) is often referred to as [[homeostasis]]; whereas in [[mechanics]], the more common term is [[Mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]].

In [[engineering]], [[mathematics]] and the physical, and biological sciences, common terms for the points around which the system gravitates include: attractors, [[stability theory|stable]] states, eigenstates/eigenfunctions, equilibrium points, and [[setpoint (control system)|setpoint]]s.

In [[control theory]], ''negative'' refers to the sign of the multiplier in mathematical models for feedback. In delta notation, −Δoutput is added to or mixed into the input. In multivariate systems, vectors help to illustrate how several influences can both partially complement and partially oppose each other.&lt;ref name=mindell/&gt;

Some authors, in particular with respect to modelling [[System dynamics|business systems]], use ''negative'' to refer to the reduction in difference between the desired and actual behavior of a system.&lt;ref name="Ramaprasad"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Arkalgud Ramaprasad |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bs.3830280103/abstract |title=On The Definition of Feedback |journal=Behavioral Science |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=4–13 |year=1983 |doi=10.1002/bs.3830280103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sterman&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In a psychology context, on the other hand, ''negative'' refers to the [[Valence (psychology)|valence]] of the feedback – attractive versus aversive, or praise versus criticism.&lt;ref name=herold1977&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Herold | first1 = David M. | last2 = Greller | first2 = Martin M. | year = 1977 | title = Research Notes.

In contrast, [[positive feedback]] is feedback in which the system responds so as to increase the magnitude of any particular perturbation, resulting in amplification of the original signal instead of stabilization. Any system in which there is positive feedback together with a gain greater than one will result in a runaway situation. Both positive and negative feedback require a feedback loop to operate.

However, negative feedback systems can still be subject to oscillations. This is caused by the slight delays around any loop. Due to these delays the feedback signal of some frequencies can arrive one half cycle later which will have a similar effect to positive feedback and these frequencies can reinforce themselves and grow over time. This problem is often dealt with by attenuating or changing the phase of the problematic frequencies. Unless the system naturally has sufficient damping, many negative feedback systems have [[low pass filter]]s or [[dashpot|dampers]] fitted.

== Some specific implementations ==
There are a large number of different examples of negative feedback and some are discussed below.

===Error-controlled regulation===
{{See also|Control engineering|Homeostasis|Allostasis}}
[[File:Regulator with feedback.png|thumb|200px|A regulator ''R'' adjusts the input to a system ''T'' so the monitored essential variables ''E'' are held to set-point values ''S'' that result in the desired system output despite disturbances ''D''.&lt;ref name=Ashby/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bhagade&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;]]
One use of feedback is to make a system (say ''T'') [[Homeostasis|self-regulating]] to minimize the effect of a disturbance (say ''D''). Using a negative feedback loop, a measurement of some variable (for example, a  [[process variable]], say ''E'') is [[Subtraction|subtracted]] from a required value (the [[Setpoint (control system)|'set point']]) to estimate an operational error in system status, which is then used by a [[Regulator (automatic control)|regulator]] (say ''R'') to reduce the gap between the measurement and the required value.&lt;ref name=Wilts&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Singh&gt;
{{cite book |title=Process Control: Concepts Dynamics And Applications |author=SK Singh |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CRQr3HvzN40C&amp;pg=PA222#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=9788120336780 |year=2010 |publisher=PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd |page=222}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The regulator modifies the input to the system ''T'' according to its interpretation of the error in the status of the system.  This error may be introduced by a variety of possible disturbances or 'upsets', some slow and some rapid.&lt;ref name= Svrcek&gt;
For example, input and load disturbances. See {{cite book |title=A Real-Time Approach to Process Control |author1=William Y. Svrcek |author2=Donald P. Mahoney |author3=Brent R. Young |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WnFPAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA57 |page=57 |isbn=9781118684733 |year=2013 |edition=3rd |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Controller (control theory)|regulation]] in such systems can range from a simple 'on-off' control to a more complex processing of the error signal.&lt;ref name=Exeter&gt;
{{cite web |title= Types of feedback control |url=http://newton.ex.ac.uk/teaching/cdhw/Feedback/ControlTypes.html |publisher=University of Exeter: Physics and astronomy |work=Feedback and temperature control |author=Charles D H Williams|accessdate=2014-06-08}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

It may be noted that the physical form of the signals in the system may change from point to point. So, for example, a change in weather may cause a disturbance to the ''heat'' input to a house (as an example of the system ''T'') that is monitored by a thermometer as a change in ''temperature'' (as an example of an 'essential variable' ''E''), converted by the thermostat (a 'comparator') into an ''electrical'' error in status compared to the 'set point' ''S'', and subsequently used by the regulator (containing a 'controller' that commands ''gas'' control valves and an ignitor) ultimately to change the ''heat'' provided by a furnace (an 'effector') to counter the initial weather-related disturbance in heat input to the house.

Error controlled regulation is typically carried out using a Proportional-Integral-Derivative Controller ([[PID controller]]). The regulator signal is derived from a weighted sum of the error signal, integral of the error signal, and derivative of the error signal. The weights of the respective components depend on the application.&lt;ref name=Bechhoefer&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bechhoefer | first = John | title = Feedback for Physicists: A Tutorial Essay On Control | journal = Reviews of Modern Physics | volume = 77 | issue = 3 | pages = 783–835 | publisher = APS Physics | url = http://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.77.783 | doi=10.1103/revmodphys.77.783| citeseerx = 10.1.1.124.7043 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematically, the regulator signal is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{MV(t)}=K_p\left(\,{e(t)} + \frac{1}{T_i}\int_{0}^{t}{e(\tau)}\,{d\tau} + T_d\frac{d}{dt}e(t)\right)&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;T_i&lt;/math&gt;  is the ''integral time''

The negative feedback amplifier was invented by [[Harold Stephen Black]] at [[Bell Laboratories]] in 1927, and granted a patent in 1937 ([http://www.sos.siena.edu/~aweatherwax/electronics/black_patent.pdf US Patent 2,102,671] "a continuation of application Serial No. 298,155, filed August 8, 1928 ...").&lt;ref name=Brittain&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  In design, the type of feedback and amount of feedback are carefully selected to weigh and optimize these various benefits.

Though negative feedback has many advantages, amplifiers with feedback can [[oscillate]]. See the article on [[Step response#Step response of feedback amplifiers|step response]]. They may even exhibit [[instability]]. [[Harry Nyquist]] of [[Bell Laboratories]] proposed the [[Nyquist stability criterion]] and the [[Nyquist plot]] that identify stable feedback systems, including amplifiers and control systems.

&lt;/ref&gt; The feedback is negative if &amp;beta;''A''&amp;thinsp;&gt;0.]]
The figure shows a simplified block diagram of a [[negative feedback amplifier]].

The feedback sets the overall (closed-loop) amplifier gain at a value:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{O}{I} =\frac {A}  { 1+\beta A }  \approx \frac {1}{\beta} \ ,&lt;/math&gt;

where the approximate value assumes &amp;beta;''A '' &gt;&gt; 1. This expression shows that a gain greater than one requires &amp;beta; &lt; 1. Because the approximate gain 1/&amp;beta; is independent of the open-loop gain ''A'', the feedback is said to 'desensitize' the closed-loop gain to variations in ''A '' (for example, due to manufacturing variations between units, or temperature effects upon components), provided only that the gain ''A'' is sufficiently large.&lt;ref name=Kal3&gt;

If the disturbance ''D'' is included, the amplifier output becomes:
:&lt;math&gt;O =\frac {AI}  { 1+\beta A }  +\frac {D}{1+ \beta A} \ , &lt;/math&gt;

which shows that the feedback reduces the effect of the disturbance by the 'improvement factor' (1+&amp;beta; ''A''). The disturbance ''D'' might arise from fluctuations in the amplifier output due to noise and nonlinearity (distortion) within this amplifier, or from other noise sources such as power supplies.&lt;ref name=Kal4&gt;

The difference signal ''I''–&amp;beta;''O'' at the amplifier input is sometimes called the "error signal".&lt;ref name=Rashid&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; According to the diagram, the error signal is:
:&lt;math&gt; \text{Error signal} = I - \beta O = I \left ( 1-\beta \frac{O}{I} \right ) =\frac {I} {1 + \beta A} - \frac { \beta D} {1+\beta A} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

From this expression, it can be seen that a large 'improvement factor' (or a large [[loop gain]] &amp;beta;''A'') tends to keep this error signal small.

Although the diagram illustrates the principles of the negative feedback amplifier, modeling a real amplifier as a [[Amplifier#Unilateral or bilateral|unilateral forward amplification block]] and a unilateral feedback block has significant limitations.&lt;ref name=Chen&gt;

===Operational amplifier circuits===
{{main article|Operational amplifier applications}}

[[File:Feedback op-amp voltage amplifier.png|thumb|200px|A feedback voltage amplifier using an op amp with finite gain but infinite input impedances and zero output impedance.&lt;ref name=Franco&gt;See, for example, Figure 1.4, p. 7 ''Ideal op amp model'' in {{cite book |title=Design with operational amplifiers and analog integrated circuits |edition=3rd |author=Sergio Franco |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=em1BnAEACAAJ |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=2002 |isbn=978-0078028168}} or {{cite book |title=Fundamentals of Circuits and Filters |editor=Wai-Kai Chen |author1=David G Nair |author2=Sergio B Franco |chapter=Figure 16.2: ''The four possible op-amp configurations'' |pages=16–2 |isbn=9781420058888 |year=2009 |publisher=CRC Press |edition=The Circuits and Filters Handbook, 3rd |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_UVb4cxL0c0C&amp;pg=SA16-PA2}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The operational amplifier was originally developed as a building block for the construction of [[analog computers]], but is now used almost universally in all kinds of applications including [[audio signal|audio]] equipment and [[control systems]].

Operational amplifier circuits typically employ negative feedback to get a predictable transfer function. Since the open-loop gain of an op-amp is extremely large, a small differential input signal would drive the output of the amplifier to one rail or the other in the absence of negative feedback. A simple example of the use of feedback is the op-amp voltage amplifier shown in the figure.

The idealized model of an operational amplifier assumes that the gain is infinite, the input impedance is infinite, output resistance is zero, and input offset currents and voltages are zero. Such an ideal amplifier draws no current from the resistor divider.&lt;ref name=Schitter&gt;
{{cite book |title=The Design of High Performance Mechatronics |author1=G. Schitter |author2=A. Rankers |page=499 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3WvnAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA499 |chapter=§6.3.4 Linear amplifiers with operational amplifiers |isbn=9781614993681 |year=2014 |publisher=IOS Press}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  
Ignoring dynamics (transient effects and [[propagation delay]]), the infinite gain of the ideal op-amp means this feedback circuit drives the voltage difference between the two op-amp inputs to zero.&lt;ref name=Schitter/&gt; Consequently, the voltage gain of the circuit in the diagram, assuming an ideal op amp, is the reciprocal of feedback [[Voltage divider|voltage division]] ratio &amp;beta;:

:&lt;math&gt;V_{\text{out}} = \frac{ R_{\text{1}} + R_{\text{2}} }{ R_{\text{1}} } V_{\text{in}}\!  = \frac{1}{\beta} V_{\text{in}} \,&lt;/math&gt;.

A real op-amp has a high but finite gain ''A'' at low frequencies, decreasing gradually at higher frequencies. In addition, it exhibits a finite input impedance and a non-zero output impedance. Although practical op-amps are not ideal, the model of an ideal op-amp often suffices to understand circuit operation at low enough frequencies. 
As discussed in the previous section, the feedback circuit stabilizes the closed-loop gain and desensitizes the output to fluctuations generated inside the amplifier itself.&lt;ref name= Jung&gt;

=== Mechanical engineering ===
{{See also|Control systems|Control engineering}}
[[File:Ballcock.svg|thumb|The [[ballcock]] or float valve uses negative feedback to control the water level in a cistern.]]
An example of the use of negative feedback control is the [[ballcock]] control of water level (see diagram). In modern engineering, negative feedback loops are found in [[fuel injection]] systems and [[carburettor]]s. Similar control mechanisms are used in heating and cooling systems, such as those involving [[air conditioners]], [[refrigerators]], or [[freezers]].

=== Biology and chemistry ===

[[Image:ACTH Negative Feedback.svg|thumb|250pc|Control of endocrine hormones by negative feedback.]]

Some biological systems exhibit negative feedback such as the [[baroreflex]] in [[blood pressure]] regulation and [[erythropoiesis]]. Many biological process (e.g., in the [[human anatomy]]) use negative feedback. Examples of this are numerous, from the regulating of body temperature, to the regulating of blood [[glucose]] levels. The disruption of feedback loops can lead to undesirable results: in the case of blood glucose levels, if negative feedback fails, the glucose levels in the blood may begin to rise dramatically, thus resulting in [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]].

For hormone secretion regulated by the negative feedback loop: when gland X releases hormone X, this stimulates target cells to release hormone Y. When there is an excess of hormone Y, gland X "senses" this and inhibits its release of hormone X. As shown in the figure, most [[endocrine]] [[hormone]]s are controlled by a [[physiology|physiologic]] negative feedback inhibition loop, such as the [[glucocorticoid]]s secreted by the [[adrenal cortex]].  The [[hypothalamus]] secretes [[Corticotropin-releasing hormone|corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)]], which directs the [[pituitary gland|anterior pituitary gland]] to secrete [[ACTH|adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)]].  In turn, ACTH directs the adrenal cortex to secrete glucocorticoids, such as [[cortisol]].  Glucocorticoids not only perform their respective functions throughout the body but also negatively affect the release of further stimulating secretions of both the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland, effectively reducing the output of glucocorticoids once a sufficient amount has been released.&lt;ref&gt;Raven, PH; Johnson, GB. ''Biology'', Fifth Edition, Boston: Hill Companies, Inc. 1999. page 1058.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-organization===
{{main article|Self-organization|Emergence}}
Self-organization is the capability of certain systems "of organizing their own behavior or structure".&lt;ref name=Uttal&gt;
{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vil6AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA95 |author= William R. Uttal |title=Psychomythics: Sources of Artifacts and Misconceptions in Scientific Psychology |isbn=9781135623722 |publisher=Psychology Press |year=2014 |pages=95 ''ff''}}
&lt;/ref&gt; There are many possible factors contributing to this capacity, and most often [[positive feedback]] is identified as a possible contributor. However, negative feedback also can play a role.&lt;ref name=Camazine&gt;
{{cite book |title=Self-organization in biological systems |author1=Scott Camazine |author2=Jean-Louis Deneubourg |author3=Nigel R Franks |author4=James Sneyd |author5=Guy Theraulaz |author6=Eric Bonabeau |chapter=Chapter 2: How self-organization works |pages=15 ''ff'' |isbn= 9780691116242 |year=2003 |publisher=Princeton University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zMgyNN6Ufj0C&amp;pg=PA15}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economics ===

In economics, [[automatic stabiliser]]s are government programs that are intended to work as negative feedback to dampen fluctuations in [[real GDP]].

[[Mainstream economics]] asserts that the market pricing mechanism operates to match [[supply and demand]], because mismatches between them feed back into the decision-making of suppliers and demanders of goods, altering prices and thereby reducing any discrepancy. However [[Norbert Wiener]] wrote in 1948:
	
:''"There is a belief current in many countries and elevated to the rank of an official article of faith in the United States that free competition is itself a homeostatic process... Unfortunately the evidence, such as it is, is against this simple-minded theory."''&lt;ref&gt;[[Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine]] p.158&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of economic equilibrium being maintained in this fashion by market forces has also been questioned by numerous [[heterodox economics|heterodox]] economists such as [[financier]] [[George Soros]]&lt;ref&gt;Goeroge Soros, ''The Alchemy of Finance''&lt;/ref&gt; and leading [[Ecological economics|ecological economist]] and [[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state theorist]]  [[Herman Daly]], who was with the [[World Bank]] in 1988-1994.&lt;ref&gt;Herman Daly, ''Steady State Economics''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''Ninjō'''|[[wikt:人情|人情]]|"human emotion or compassion"}} in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], is human feeling that complements and opposes the value of [[giri (Japanese)|giri]], or social obligation, within the Japanese worldview.  Broadly speaking, ''ninjō'' is said to be the human feeling that inescapably springs up ''in conflict'' with social obligation.  As ''ninjō'' is a culture-specific term, the validity or importance of this concept is subject to a wide range of viewpoints, inextricably tied into one's perspective on [[nihonjinron]] as a whole.

The classic example of ''ninjō'' is that of a [[samurai]] who falls in love with an unacceptable partner (perhaps somebody of low social class or somebody of an enemy clan).  As a loyal member of his clan, he then becomes torn between the obligation to his feudal lord and his personal feelings, with the only possible resolution being ''[[shinjū]]'' or double love-suicide.  The correspondence to [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' or the [[Aeneid]] would be made by Japanese and non-Japanese alike.  The question of whether modern Japanese still feel a greater sense of giri than their Western counterparts, and thus remain in some ineffable way psychologically closer to this sort of giri-ninjo conflict is precisely where nihonjinron divides into the Japan-centric and Japan-skeptic camps.

It is a precursor molecule to the [[neurotransmitter]] [[Acetylcholine]] which serves a wide range of functions including motor control and memory.  Choline itself has also been shown to have additional health benefits in relation to memory and choline deficiencies may be related to some liver and [[neurological disorder]]s.&lt;ref name="Zeisel SH, da Costa KA"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1753-4887.2009.00246.x |title=Choline: An essential nutrient for public health |year=2009 |last1=Zeisel |first1=Steven H |last2=Da Costa |first2=Kerry-Ann |journal=Nutrition Reviews |volume=67 |issue=11 |pages=615–23 |pmid=19906248 |pmc=2782876}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its role in cellular synthesis, choline is an important nutrient during the prenatal and early postnatal development of offspring as it contributes heavily to the development of the brain. Despite the wide range of foods that choline is found in, studies have shown that the mean choline intake of men, women and children are below the [[Adequate Intake]] levels.&lt;ref name="Zeisel SH, da Costa KA"/&gt; Women, especially pregnant or lactating women, older people, and infants, are especially at risk for choline deficiency.&lt;ref name="Zeisel SH, da Costa KA"/&gt;

Pellagra is classically characterized by four 4 "D's": diarrhea, [[dermatitis]], dementia, and death. Neuropsychiatric manifestations of pellagra include headache, irritability, poor concentration, anxiety, hallucinations, stupor, apathy, psychomotor unrest, photophobia, tremor, ataxia, spastic paresis, fatigue, and depression. Symptoms of fatigue and insomnia may progress to encephalophathy characterized by confusion, memory loss, and psychosis.

Oral nicotinamide has been promoted as an over-the-counter drug for the treatment of [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer's dementia]]. Conversely, no clinically significant effect has been found for the drug, as nicotinamide administration has not been found to promote memory functions in patients with mild to moderate dementia of either Alzheimers', vascular, or fronto-temporal types.

===Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; (folic acid)===
Folate and vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; play a vital role in the synthesis of [[S-Adenosyl methionine|S-adenosylmethionine]], which is of key importance in the maintenance and repair of all cells, including neurons.&lt;ref name= oscar&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=1865312 |year=1991 |last1=Hauck |first1=MR |title=Cognitive abilities of preschool children: Implications for nurses working with young children |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=230–5 |journal=Journal of Pediatric Nursing}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, folate has been linked to the maintenance of adequate brain levels of cofactors necessary for chemicals reactions that lead to the synthesis of serotonin and catecholamine neurotransmitters.&lt;ref name= november&gt;{{cite book |title=Dietary Reference Intakes for Thiamin, Riboflavin, Niacin, Vitamin B6, Folate, Vitamin B12, Pantothenic Acid, Biotin, and Choline |year=1998 |publisher=National Academy Press |location=Washington, DC |isbn=978-0-309-06554-2 |url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/DRI/DRI_Thiamin/196-305_150.pdf}}{{page needed|was "|page=196 |pages=1–541". which is it?|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concentrations of blood plasma folate and [[homocysteine]] concentrations are inversely related, such that an increase in dietary folate decreases homocysteine concentration.

The link between levels of folate and altered mental function is not large, but is sufficient enough to suggest a causal association.&lt;ref name="november"/&gt; Deficiency in folate can cause an elevation of homocysteine within the blood,&lt;ref name="quebec"/&gt; as the clearance of homocysteine requires enzymatic action dependent on folate, and to a lesser extent, vitamins B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;.

Differences lie in the presentation of megaloblastic anemia induced by either folate or B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency. Megaloblastic anemia related to deficiency in B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; generally results in peripheral neuropathy, whereas folate-related anemia often results in affective, or mood disorders.&lt;ref name="romeo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.281.6247.1036 |title=The neuropsychiatry of megaloblastic anaemia |year=1980 |last1=Shorvon |first1=S D |last2=Carney |first2=M W |last3=Chanarin |first3=I |last4=Reynolds |first4=E H |journal=BMJ |volume=281 |issue=6247 |pages=1036–8 |pmid=6253016 |pmc=1714413}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neurological effects are not often associated with folate-related megaloblastic anemia, although demyelinating disorders may eventually present.&lt;ref name="romeo"/&gt; In one study, mood disturbances were recorded for the majority of patients presenting with megaloblastic anemia in the absence of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency.&lt;ref name="november"/&gt; In addition, folate concentrations within blood plasma have been found to be lower in patients with both unipolar and bipolar depressive disorders when compared with control groups. In addition, depressive groups with low folate concentrations responded less well to standard [[Antidepressant|antidepressant therapy]] than did those with normal levels within plasma.&lt;ref name="november"/&gt; However, replication of these findings are less robust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12042457 |year=2002 |last1=Bryan |first1=J |last2=Calvaresi |first2=E |last3=Hughes |first3=D |title=Short-term folate, vitamin B-12 or vitamin B-6 supplementation slightly affects memory performance but not mood in women of various ages |volume=132 |issue=6 |pages=1345–56 |journal=The Journal of Nutrition|doi=10.1093/jn/132.6.1345 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intake of the vitamin has been linked to deficits in [[learning]] and memory, particularly within the elderly population.&lt;ref name="november"/&gt; Elderly people deficient in folate may present with deficits in free recall and recognition, which suggests that levels of folate may be related to efficacy of episodic memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0882-7974.11.3.487 |title=Effects of serum vitamin B-sub-1-sub-2 and folate status on episodic memory performance in very old age: A population-based study |year=1996 |last1=Wahlin |first1=Åke |last2=Hill |first2=Robert D. |last3=Winblad |first3=Bengt |last4=Bäckman |first4=Lars |journal=Psychology and Aging |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=487–96 |pmid=8893317}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of adequate folate may produce a form of dementia considered to be reversible with administration of the vitamin. Indeed, there is a degree of improvement in memory associated with folate treatment. In a 3-year longitudinal study of men and women aged 50–70 years with elevated homocysteine plasma concentration, researchers found that a daily oral folic acid supplementation of 800μg resulted in an increase in folate levels and a decrease in homocysteine levels within blood plasma. In addition to these results, improvements of memory, and information-processing speed, as well as slight improvements of [[Sensory-motor coupling|sensorimotor]] speed were observed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60109-3 |title=Effect of 3-year folic acid supplementation on cognitive function in older adults in the FACIT trial: A randomised, double blind, controlled trial |year=2007 |last1=Durga |first1=Jane |last2=Van Boxtel |first2=Martin PJ |last3=Schouten |first3=Evert G |last4=Kok |first4=Frans J |last5=Jolles |first5=Jelle |last6=Katan |first6=Martijn B |last7=Verhoef |first7=Petra |journal=The Lancet |volume=369 |issue=9557 |pages=208–216 |pmid=17240287|url=https://cris.maastrichtuniversity.nl/portal/en/publications/effect-of-3year-folic-acid-supplementation-on-cognitive-function-in-older-adults-in-the-facit-trial-a-randomised-double-blind-controlled-trial(35d288c0-c91e-417c-b2b7-a35a0fbc8361).html |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; which suggests there is a link between homocysteine and cognitive performance. However, while the amount of cognitive improvement after treatment with folate is correlated with the severity of folate deficiency, the severity of cognitive decline is independent of the severity of folate deficiency. This suggests that the dementia observed may not be entirely related to levels folate, as there could be additional factors that were not accounted for which might have an effect.&lt;ref name= "Fioravanti"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=18653121 |year=1998 |last1=Fioravanti |first1=M |last2=Ferrario |first2=E |last3=Massaia |first3=M |last4=Cappa |first4=G |last5=Rivolta |first5=G |last6=Grossi |first6=E |last7=Buckley |first7=AE |title=Low folate levels in the cognitive decline of elderly patients and the efficacy of folate as a treatment for improving memory deficits |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=1–13 |journal=Archives of Gerontology and Geriatrics |doi=10.1016/s0167-4943(97)00028-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because neurulation may be completed before pregnancy is recognized, it is recommended that women capable of becoming pregnant take about 400μg of folic acid from fortified foods, supplements, or a combination of the two in order to reduce the risk of neural tube defects.&lt;ref name="november"/&gt; These major anomalies in the nervous system can be reduced by 85% with systematic folate supplementation occurring before the onset of pregnancy.&lt;ref name= papa&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=11475447 |year=2001 |last1=Moyers |first1=S |last2=Bailey |first2=LB |title=Fetal malformations and folate metabolism: Review of recent evidence |volume=59 |issue=7 |pages=215–24 |journal=Nutrition Reviews |doi=10.1111/j.1753-4887.2001.tb07013.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incidence of Alzheimer's and other cognitive diseases has been loosely connected to deficiencies in folate. It is recommended for the elderly to consume folate through food, fortified or not, and supplements in order to reduce risk of developing the disease.&lt;ref name="oscar"/&gt;

===Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; (cobalamin)===
Also known as cobalamin, B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; is important for the maintenance of neurological function and psychiatric health.&lt;ref name= sierra&gt;{{cite book |title=Dietary Reference Intakes for Thiamin, Riboflavin, Niacin, Vitamin B6, Folate, Vitamin B12, Pantothenic Acid, Biotin, and Choline |year=1998 |publisher=National Academy Press |location=Washington, DC |isbn=978-0-309-06554-2 |url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/DRI/DRI_Thiamin/306-356_150.pdf }}{{page needed|was "|page=306 |pages=1–541". which is it?|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency, also known as [[hypocobalaminemia]], often results from complications involving absorption into the body.&lt;ref name= victor&gt;{{Cite journal |pmid=17043022 |year=2006 |last1=Hvas |first1=AM |last2=Nexo |first2=E |title=Diagnosis and treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency--an update |volume=91 |issue=11 |pages=1506–12 |journal=Haematologica}}&lt;/ref&gt; An assortment of neurological effects can be observed in 75–90% of individuals of any age with clinically observable B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency.

These abnormalities involve a progressive degeneration of [[myelin]],&lt;ref name= yankee&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.2.5006.1394 |title=Cerebral Manifestations of Vitamin-B12 Deficiency |year=1956 |last1=Holmes |first1=J.

Combined myelopathy and neuropathy are prevalent within a large percentage of cases. Cognitive changes may range from loss of concentration to memory loss, disorientation, and dementia. All of these symptoms may present with or without additional mood changes. Mental symptoms are extremely variable, and include mild disorders of mood, mental slowness, and memory defect. Memory defect encompasses symptoms of [[Mental confusion|confusion]], severe agitation and depression, [[delusions]] and paranoid behavior, visual and auditory [[hallucinations]], dysphasia, violent maniacal behavior and epilepsy. It has been suggested that mental symptoms could be related to a decrease in cerebral metabolism, as caused by the state of deficiency.&lt;ref name="yankee"/&gt;

Mild to moderate cases of pernicious anemia may show poor [[Attentional control|concentration]]. In severe cases of pernicious anemia, individuals may present with various cognitive problems such as dementia, and memory loss. It is not always easy to determine whether B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency is present, especially within older adults.&lt;ref name="victor"/&gt; Patients may present with violent behavior or more subtle personality changes. They may also present with vague complaints, such as fatigue or memory loss, that may be attributed to normative aging processes. Cognitive symptoms may mimic behavior in Alzheimer's and other dementias as well.

Patients deficient in B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; despite normal absorption functionality may be treated through oral administration of at least 6&amp;nbsp;µg/day of the vitamin in pill form. Patients who suffer from irreversible causes of deficiency, such as pernicious anemia or old age, will need lifelong treatment with pharmacological doses of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;. Strategy for treatment is dependent on the patient's level of deficiency as well as their level of cognitive functioning.&lt;ref name="victor"/&gt; Treatment for those with severe deficiency involves 1000&amp;nbsp;µg of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; administered [[Intramuscular injection|intramuscularly]] daily for one week, weekly for one month, then monthly for the rest of the patients life. The progression of neurological manifestations of cobalamin deficiency is generally gradual. As a result, early diagnosis is important or else irreversible damage may occur.&lt;ref name="sierra"/&gt; Patients who become demented usually show little to no cognitive improvement with the administration of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;. There is risk that folic acid administered to those with B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency may mask anemic symptoms without solving the issue at hand. In this case, patients would still be at risk for neurological deficits associated with B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency-related anemia, which are not associated with anemia related to folate deficiency.&lt;ref name= zulu&gt;{{cite book|last1=Malouf|first1=R|title=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=4|pages=CD004514|authorlink2=John Grimley Evans|last2=Grimley Evans|first2=J|last3=Areosa Sastre|first3=A|last4=Malouf|first4=Reem|year=2003|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004514|pmid=14584018|chapter=Folic acid with or without vitamin B12 for cognition and dementia}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|reason=Updated version https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18843658|date = November 2018}}

==Vitamin A deficiency and impaired memory==
[[Vitamin A]] is an essential [[nutrient]] for mammals which takes form in either [[retinol]] or the [[provitamin]] [[beta-Carotene]]. It helps regulation of cell division, cell function, genetic regulation, helps enhance the immune system, and is required for brain function, chemical balance, growth and development of the [[central nervous system]] and vision.&lt;ref name="Edem D.O"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3923/ajcn.2009.65.82 |title=Vitamin A: A Review |year=2009 |last1=Edem |first1=D.O. |journal=Asian Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume=1 |pages=65–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aging and cognitive disease==
Foods that are rich in omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to decrease risk of getting Alzheimer's disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1159/000310330 |title=Phosphatidylserine Containing ω–3 Fatty Acids May Improve Memory Abilities in Non-Demented Elderly with Memory Complaints: A Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trial |year=2010 |last1=Vakhapova |first1=Veronika |last2=Cohen |first2=Tzafra |last3=Richter |first3=Yael |last4=Herzog |first4=Yael |last5=Korczyn |first5=Amos D. |journal=Dementia and Geriatric Cognitive Disorders |volume=29 |issue=5 |pages=467–74 |pmid=20523044}}&lt;/ref&gt; Omega-3 fatty acids, primarily [[docosahexaenoic acid]] (DHA), which is the most prevalent omega-3 fatty acid found in neurons, have been studied extensively for use in possible prevention and therapy of Alzheimer's disease. Some studies (cross-sectional) suggest that reduced intake or low brain levels of DHA are associated with earlier development of cognitive deficits or development of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease. Several clinical trials suggest that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation does not have significant effects in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease—which in turn may suggest that the protective benefits of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation could depend on the scope of the disease and other confounding factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jicha|first=GA|author2=Markesbery, WR |title=Omega-3 fatty acids: potential role in the management of early Alzheimer's disease.|journal=Clinical Interventions in Aging|date=Apr 7, 2010|volume=5|pages=45–61|pmid=20396634|pmc=2854051|doi=10.2147/cia.s5231}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A diet that is rich in antioxidants will also help get rid of free radicals in the body, which could be a cause for Alzheimer's. The buildup of Beta Amyloid plaques, a marker highly associated with Alzheimer's disease, generates cell damaging free radicals. Therefore, the role of antioxidants as protectants against Alzheimer's disease has become a hot topic of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Miranda S, Opazo C, Larrondo LF, Muñoz FJ, Ruiz F, Leighton F, Inestrosa NC  | year =2000| title =The role of oxidative stress in the toxicity induced by amyloid ß-peptide in Alzheimer's disease| journal = Progress in Neurobiology | volume =62|issue =6|pages =633–648 | doi =10.1016/S0301-0082(00)00015-0|pmid =  10880853 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Simple dietary modification, towards fewer highly processed carbohydrates and relatively more fats ad cholesterol, is likely a protective measure against Alzheimer's disease.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Additionally, [[folic acid]] has also been found to improve the memory of older people.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2998">'''Political Obligation''' refers to a moral requirement to obey the laws of one’s country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199756223/obo-9780199756223-0121.xml|title=Political Obligation - Political Science - Oxford Bibliographies - obo|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origins of the political obligation are somewhat unclear, however it can be traced back to the Ancient Greeks. The idea of political obligation is also a philosophical one, that focuses on the morality of laws, rather than if a law is just or not as well as the obvious self-interests.

=== History ===
The idea of political obligation was first founded by [[Thomas Hill Green]] around the late 1800's. For Green, he discussed this idea as "obedience to the law."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Dagger|first=Richard|title=Political Obligation|date=2014|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2014/entries/political-obligation/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2014|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-10-04|last2=Lefkowitz|first2=David}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Green's explanation for what is Political Obligation only scratches the surface, and a more detailed look at the term can be traced to the thoughts of [[Socrates]] and [[Plato]]. [[Dudley Knowles]] also looks at this through his book ''Political Obligation: A Critical Introduction'', and finds a more detailed look at the relationship the person and the state have towards each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/kentstate/reader.action?docID=452103&amp;query=|title=Kent State University -- CAS – Central Authentication Service|website=ebookcentral.proquest.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Socrates ====
The earliest understanding of political obligation can be traced back to the teachings of Socrates. One account recalls Socrates being jailed and sentenced to death for "corrupting the morals of the youth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2014/entries/political-obligation/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first1=Richard|last1=Dagger|first2=David|last2=Lefkowitz|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=5 November 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Socrates was set to escape, a design set up by his friends, however he chose to stay and accept his punishment, as he found it morally wrong not to do so. In Crito, Socrates describes the struggle man has with the rule of law and the connection it has with humans political obligation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1408204|title=Citizenship and Socrates in Plato's "Crito"|first=Michael J.|last=Rosano|date=5 November 2018|publisher=|journal=The Review of Politics|volume=62|issue=3|pages=451–477|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Political violence in Turkey''' became a challenging problem in late 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Zürcher| first = Erik J.| title = Turkey A Modern History, Revised Edition| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qaC24BFy4JQC&amp;pg=PA263| year = 2004| publisher = I.B.Tauris| isbn = 978-1-85043-399-6| page = 263 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The violence was even described as a "low-level war".&lt;ref name=Gil/&gt; The death squads of Turkish right-wing ultra-nationalist groups against left-wing opposition inflicted some 5,000 casualties. The wave of violence dimmed after the [[1980 Turkish coup d'état]].

==History==

===Background===
In 1975 [[Süleyman Demirel]], president of the conservative [[Justice Party (Turkey)|Justice Party]] ({{lang-tr|Adalet Partisi}}, AP) succeeded [[Bülent Ecevit]], president of the social-democratic [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|Republican People's Party]] ({{lang-tr|Cumhuriyet Halk Partisi}}, CHP) as Prime Minister. He formed a coalition called "the Nationalist Front ({{lang-tr|Milliyetçi Cephe}})" with [[Necmettin Erbakan]]'s Islamist [[National Salvation Party]] ({{lang-tr|Millî Selamet Partisi}}, MSP), and [[Alparslan Türkeş]]' far right [[Nationalist Movement Party]] ({{lang-tr|Milliyetçi Hareket Partisi}}, MHP). The MHP used the opportunity to infiltrate state security services, seriously aggravating the low-intensity war that was waging between rival factions.&lt;ref name="Gil"&gt;Gil, Ata. "La Turquie à marche forcée," ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'', February 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Turkish general election, 1977|elections of 1977]] had no winner. First, Demirel continued the coalition with the Nationalist Front, but in 1978, Ecevit was able to get to power again with the help of some deputies who had shifted from one party to another. In 1979, Demirel once again became Prime Minister. At the end of the 1970s, Turkey was in an unstable situation with unsolved economic and social problems facing strike actions and partial paralysis of politics (the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey]] was unable to elect a President during the six months preceding the coup). Since 1968–69, a [[proportional representation]] system had made it difficult to find any parliamentary majority. The interests of the industrial [[bourgeoisie]], which held the largest holdings of the country, were opposed by other [[social class]]es such as smaller industrialists, traders, rural notables, and landlords, whose interests did not always coincide among themselves. Numerous agricultural and industrial reforms requested by parts of the middle upper classes were blocked by others.&lt;ref name=Gil/&gt; Henceforth, the politicians seemed unable to combat the growing violence in the country.

===Sequence of events===
Unprecedented political violence had erupted in Turkey in the late 1970s. The overall death toll of the 1970s is estimated at 5,000, with nearly ten assassinations per day.&lt;ref name=Gil/&gt; Most were members of left-wing and right-wing political organizations, then engaged in bitter fighting. The ultra-nationalist [[Grey Wolves (organization)|Grey Wolves]], youth organisation of the [[Nationalist Movement Party|MHP]], claimed they were supporting the security forces.&lt;ref name="AI"&gt;{{cite book| title = Turkey| year = 1988| publisher = Amnesty International| isbn = 978-0-86210-156-5| page = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the British ''[[Searchlight (magazine)|Searchlight magazine]]'', in 1978 there were 3,319 [[fascist]] attacks, in which 831 were killed and 3,121 wounded.&lt;ref name="searchlight"&gt;''[[Searchlight (magazine)]]'', No.47 (May 1979), pg. 6. Quoted by {{Harvard citation|Herman|Brodhead|1986|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the central trial against the left-wing organization [[Devrimci Yol]] (Revolutionary Path) at Ankara Military Court the defendants listed 5,388 political killings before the military coup. Among the victims were 1,296 right-wingers and 2,109 left-wingers. The others could not clearly be related.&lt;ref&gt;Devrimci Yol Savunması (Defense of the Revolutionary Path). Ankara, January 1989, p. 118-119.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1978 [[Bahçelievler Massacre]], the 1977 [[Taksim Square massacre]] with 35 victims and the 1978 [[Maraş massacre]] with over 100 victims are some notable incidents. Martial law was announced following the [[Kahramanmaraş Massacre]] in 14 of (then) 67 provinces in December 1978. At the time of the [[1980 Turkish coup d'état|coup]] martial law had been extended to 20 provinces.

Ecevit was warned about the coming coup in June 1979 by [[Nuri Gündeş]] of the [[National Intelligence Organization (Turkey)|National Intelligence Organization]] (MİT). Ecevit then told his interior minister, [[İrfan Özaydınlı]], who then told [[Sedat Celasun]]—one of the five generals who would lead the coup. The deputy undersecretary of the MİT, Nihat Yıldız, was demoted to the London consulate and replaced by a lieutenant general as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sabah.com.tr/2007/07/18/haber,F2F7DAEDBD12405DA139F5C7B988FEF6.html |accessdate=2008-12-18 |title=Çalınan silahlar falcıya soruldu |date=2007-07-17 |first=Ferhat |last=Ünlü |work=Sabah |language=Turkish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080830082751/http://www.sabah.com.tr/2007/07/18/haber,F2F7DAEDBD12405DA139F5C7B988FEF6.html |archivedate=30 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kurdish separatism==
{{POV-section|date=November 2014}}
The right-wing groups were opposed towards Kurdish separatism. Disproportionate numbers of Kurds were part of the left-wing groups. Most of the left was also Turkish nationalist and opposed towards separatism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Romano| first = David| title = The Kurdish Nationalist Movement Opportunity, Mobilization and Identity| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ohSNu6bidEQC&amp;pg=PA46| year = 2006| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-68426-2| page = 46 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the coup of 1980 only a minority of the violence was committed by separatists, after that it increased.

'''Powered by the Apocalypse''' (PbtA) is a [[role-playing game system]] developed for the 2010 game ''[[Apocalypse World]]'' and also used for ''[[Dungeon World]]'', ''[[Monsterhearts]]'' and numerous other RPGs.  ''Apocalypse World'' won the 2010 Indie RPG Awards for ''Most Innovative Game''&lt;ref name="Innovation Award"&gt;[http://www.rpg-awards.com/2010/most_innovate.shtml Most Innovative] – 2010 Indie RPG Awards&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dungeon World]] won the 2013 [[ENnie award]] for ''Best Rules''.&lt;ref name="2013 ENnies"&gt;[http://www.ennie-awards.com/blog/about-us/2013-noms-and-winners-2/ 2013 ENnie Awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

==System==

Powered by the Apocalypse games are centered around resolving what characters do as Moves. Characters have access to a default selection of moves based on the expectations of the game setting. In the fantasy game, ''Dungeon World'', characters have access to a [[hack and slash]] move, as combat is central to the dungeoneering experience. Alternatively, ''Apocalypse World'' has a "seize by force" move, as the game assumes a setting where collecting scarce resources is part of the game-play experience. ''Apocalypse World'', ''Dungeon World'', and most other PbtA games are [[character class|class based]]. Character classes have access to a number of class-specific moves.

Moves are resolved by rolling two six-sided dice and adding the relevant modifier, should modifiers be a mechanic in the game. Success levels fall on a scale of total success, partial success, or failure - referred to as a "miss" in the system.

==Published games using the Powered by the Apocalypse system==
Because of the simplicity and the flexibility of the Powered by the Apocalypse engine, and [[Vincent Baker]]'s encouragement of publishing hacks,&lt;ref name="forum"&gt;[http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=29.0 Forum statement] – [[Vincent Baker]], 11 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; there are at least four dozen fan-made hacks that have reached the point of public playtesting.&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nPfff5dSHsk__rFHGQfLaAmb3ns680s_Fc0CSNlhfFA/edit?pli=1# Big List of Apocalypse World hacks]&lt;/ref&gt;  This list only covers the ones actually published.

In the [[history of biology]], '''preformationism''' (or '''preformism''') is a formerly-popular theory that organisms develop from miniature versions of themselves. Instead of assembly from parts, preformationists believed that the [[platonic forms|form]] of living things exist, in real terms, prior to their [[ontogeny|development]].&lt;ref name=SEP&gt;Maienschein, Jane, "[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/epigenesis/ Epigenesis and Preformationism]", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2008 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.).&lt;/ref&gt; It suggests that all [[organism]]s were created at the same time, and that succeeding generations grow from [[Homunculus|homunculi]], or [[animalcule]]s, that have existed since the beginning of creation.

[[Epigenesis (biology)|Epigenesis]]&lt;ref name=OED1&gt;According to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]]: {{quote | The word is used by W. Harvey, ''Exercitationes'' 1651, p. 148, and in the ''English Anatomical Exercitations'' 1653, p. 272. It is explained to mean 'partium super-exorientium additamentum', 'the additament of parts budding one out of another'.}}  It is also worth quoting this adumbration of the definition given there (viz., "The formation of an organic germ as a new product"): {{quote | '''theory of epigenesis''': the theory that the germ is brought into existence (by successive accretions), and not merely developed, in the process of reproduction. ... The opposite theory was formerly known as the 'theory of evolution'; to avoid the ambiguity of this name, it is now spoken of chiefly as the 'theory of preformation', sometimes as that of 'encasement' or 'emboîtement'.}}
&lt;/ref&gt; (or neoformism),&lt;ref&gt;Callebaut, Marc, 2008: [http://www.naturalsciences.be/institute/associations/rbzs_website/bjz/back/pdf/BJZ%20138(1)/138_1_20_35html/Volume%20138(1),%20pp.%2020-35.html Historical evolution of preformistic versus neoformistic epigenetic thinking in embryology]. Belgian Journal of Zoology 138(1): 20-35.&lt;/ref&gt; then, in this context, is the denial of preformationism: the idea that, in some sense, the form of living things comes into existence.  As opposed to "strict" preformationism, it is the notion that "each embryo or organism is gradually produced from an undifferentiated mass by a series of steps and stages during which new parts are added" (Magner 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;154).&lt;ref name=Magner&gt;Magner, Lois. ''A History of the Life Sciences''. New York: Marcel Dekker, Inc, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; This word is still used, on the other hand, in a more modern sense, to refer to those aspects of the generation of form during ontogeny that are not strictly genetic, or, in other words, ''[[epigenetics|epigenetic]]''.

Furthermore, apart from those distinctions (preformationism-epigenesis and genetic-epigenetic), the terms preformistic development, epigenetic development and [[somatic embryogenesis]] are also used in another context, in relation to the [[Cellular differentiation|differentiation]] of a distinct [[germ cell]] line. In preformistic development, the germ line is present since early development. In epigenetic development, the germ line is present, but it appears late. In somatic embryogenesis, a distinct germ line is lacking.&lt;ref&gt;Buss, L.W. (1987). ''The Evolution of Individuality''. Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ, p. 20 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Mfj_AwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=inauthor%3A%22Leo%20W.%20Buss%22&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;pg=PA20#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false].&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors call [[Weismann barrier|Weismannist]] development (either preformistic or epigenetic) that in which there is a distinct germ line.&lt;ref&gt;Ridley M (2004) Evolution, 3rd edition. Blackwell Publishing, p. 295-297.&lt;/ref&gt;

The historical ideas of preformationism and epigenesis, and the rivalry between them, are obviated by our [[genetics|contemporary understanding]] of the [[genetic code]] and its [[nucleic acid|molecular basis]] together with [[developmental biology]] and [[epigenetics]].

==Philosophical development==
[[Pythagoras]] is one of the earliest thinkers credited with ideas about the origin of form in the biological production of offspring. It is said&lt;ref name=johnston&gt;e.g. by Ian Johnston, Malaspina University-College, Nanaimo, BC, in "...And Still We Evolve:
A Handbook on the History of Modern Science", [http://records.viu.ca/~johnstoi/darwin/sect5.htm Section Five: Heredity and Modern Genetics], May 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; that he originated "spermism", the doctrine that fathers contribute the essential characteristics of their offspring while mothers contribute only a material substrate. [[Aristotle]] accepted and elaborated this idea, and his writings are the vector that transmitted it to later Europeans. Aristotle purported to analyse ontogeny in terms of the material, formal, efficient, and teleological causes (as they are usually named by later anglophone philosophy) &amp;ndash; a view that, though more complex than some subsequent ones, is essentially more epigenetic than preformationist. Later, European physicians such as [[Galen]], [[Realdo Colombo]] and [[Girolamo Fabrici]] would build upon Aristotle's theories, which were prevalent well into the 17th century.&lt;ref name=Magner/&gt;

In 1651, [[William Harvey]] published ''On the Generation of Animals'' (''[[William Harvey|Exercitationes de Generatione Animalium]]''), a seminal work on [[embryology]] that contradicted many of Aristotle's fundamental ideas on the matter. Harvey famously asserted, for example, that ''ex ovo omnia''—all animals come from eggs. Because of this assertion in particular, Harvey is often credited with being the father of ovist preformationism. However, Harvey's ideas about the process of development were fundamentally epigenesist.&lt;ref name=Pinto-Correia&gt;Clara Pinto Correia, ''The Ovary of Eve: Egg and Sperm Preformation'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1997. {{ISBN|0-226-66952-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[gametes]] (male sperm and female ova) were too small to be seen under the best magnification at the time, Harvey's account of fertilization was theoretical rather than descriptive.  Although he once postulated a "spiritous substance" that exerted its effect on the female body, he later rejected it as superfluous and thus unscientific. He guessed instead that fertilization occurred through a mysterious transference by contact, or contagion.&lt;ref name=Magner/&gt;

Harvey's epigenesis, more mechanistic and less vitalist than the Aristotelian version, was, thus, more compatible with the [[natural philosophy]] of the time.&lt;ref name="Pinto-Correia"/&gt; Still, the idea that unorganized matter could ultimately self-organize into life challenged the [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic]] framework of [[Cartesianism]], which had become dominant in the [[Scientific Revolution]]. Because of technological limitations, there was no available mechanical explanation for epigenesis.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S. J. (1974) [https://books.google.com/books?id=_VCnI02FwHAC&amp;pg=PA202 "On Heroes and Fools in Science."] ''Natural History'' 83 (7): 30-32.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was simpler and more convenient to postulate preformed miniature organisms that expanded in accordance with mechanical laws. So convincing was this explanation that some naturalists claimed to actually see miniature preformed animals ([[animalcule]]s) in eggs and miniature plants in seeds.&lt;ref name=Magner/&gt; In the case of humans, the term [[homunculus]] was used.

== Elaboration ==

After the discovery of [[Spermatozoon|spermatozoa]] in 1677 by Dutch microscopist [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]], the epigenist theory proved more difficult to defend: How could complex organisms such as human beings develop from such simple organisms? Thereafter, Joseph de Aromatari and then [[Marcello Malpighi]] and [[Jan Swammerdam]] made observations using microscopes in the late 17th century, and interpreted their findings to develop the preformationist theory. For two centuries, until the development of [[cell theory]], preformationists would oppose epigenicists, and, inside the preformationist camp, spermists (who claimed the homunculus must come from the man) to ovists, who located the homunculus in the ova.

Dutch microscopist [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] was one of the first to observe spermatozoa. He described the spermatozoa of about 30 species, and thought he saw in semen "all manner of great and small vessels, so various and so numerous that I do not doubt that they be nerves, arteries and veins...And when I saw them, I felt convinced that, in no full grown body, are there any vessels which may not be found likewise in semen." (Friedman 76-7)&lt;ref name=Friedman&gt;Friedman, David M. [[A Mind of Its Own: A Cultural History of the Penis]]. New York: The Free Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Leeuwenhoek discovered that the origin of semen was the testicles and was a committed preformationist and spermist. He reasoned that the movement of spermatozoa was evidence of animal life, which presumed a complex structure and, for human sperm, a soul. (Friedman 79)&lt;ref name=Friedman/&gt;

In 1694, [[Nicolaas Hartsoeker]], in his ''Essai de Dioptrique'' concerning things large and small that could be seen with optical lenses, produced an image of a tiny human form curled up inside the sperm, which he referred to in the French as ''petit l'infant'' and ''le petit animal''. This image, depicting what historians now refer to as the [[homunculus]], has become iconic of the theory of preformationism, and appears in almost every textbook concerning the history of embryological science.&lt;ref name="Pinto-Correia" /&gt;

Philosopher [[Nicolas Malebranche]] was the first to advance the hypothesis that each embryo could contain even smaller embryos [[ad infinitum]], like a [[Matryoshka doll]]. According to Malebranche, "an infinite series of plants and animals were contained within the seed or the egg, but only naturalists with sufficient skill and experience could detect their presence." (Magner 158-9)&lt;ref name=Magner/&gt; In fact, Malebranche only alleged this, observing that if microscopes enabled us to see very little animals and plants, maybe even smaller creatures could exist. He claimed that it was not unreasonable to believe that "they are infinite trees in only one seed," as he stated that we could already see chickens in eggs, tulips in bulbs, frogs in eggs. From this, he hypothesized that "all the bodies of humans and animals," already born and yet to be born, "were perhaps produced as soon as the [[Creation myth|creation of the world]]." &lt;ref&gt;[[Nicolas Malebranche]], ''De la recherche de la vérité'' (The Search After Truth), book I, chapter VI, first section (1674-1675)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ovum|Ova]] were known in some non-mammalian species, and [[semen]] was thought to spur the development of the preformed organism contained therein. The theory that located the homonculus in the egg was called [[ovism]]. But, when spermatozoa were discovered, a rival camp of [[spermism|spermists]] sprang up, claiming that the homunculus must come from the male. In fact, the term "spermatozoon," coined by [[Karl Ernst von Baer]], means "seed animals."&lt;ref name=Magner/&gt;

With the discovery of sperm and the concept of spermism came a religious quandary. Why would so many little animals be wasted with each ejaculation of semen? [[Pierre Lyonet]] said the wastage proved that sperm could not be the seeds of life. [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] supported a theory called [[panspermism]] that the wasted sperm might actually be scattered (for example, by the wind) and generate life wherever they found a suitable host.

Leibniz also believed that “death is only a transformation enveloped through diminution,” meaning that not only have organisms always existed in their living form, but that they will always exist, body united to soul, even past apparent death.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Justin Erik. “Leibniz’s Preformationism: Between Metaphysics and Biology.”Analecta Husserliana, the Yearbook of Phenomenological Research. Volume LXXVII. (2002) 161-192.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, some animalculists thought that an animal's sperm behaved like the adult animal, and recorded such observations. Some, but not all, preformationists at this time claimed to see miniature organisms inside the sex cells. But, about this time, spermists began to use more abstract arguments to support their theories.

[[Jean Astruc]], noting that parents of both sexes seemed to influence the characteristics of their offspring, suggested that the animalcule came from the sperm and was then shaped as it passed into the egg. [[Georges Louis Leclerc|Buffon]] and [[Pierre Louis Moreau]] also advocated theories to explain this phenomenon.&lt;ref name=Magner/&gt;

Preformationism, especially ovism, was the dominant theory of generation during the 18th century. It competed with [[spontaneous generation]] and [[Epigenesis (biology)|epigenesis]], but those two theories were often rejected on the grounds that inert matter could not produce life without God's intervention.
      
Some animals' [[regeneration (biology)|regenerative]] capabilities challenged preformationism, and [[Abraham Trembley]]'s studies of the [[hydra (genus)|hydra]] convinced various authorities to reject their former views.
             
[[Lazaro Spallanzani]], Trembley's nephew, experimented with regeneration and semen, but failed to discern the importance of spermatozoa, dismissing them as parasitic worms and concluding instead that it was the liquid portion of semen that caused the preformed organism in the [[ovum]] to develop.

== Criticisms and cell theory ==

[[Caspar Friedrich Wolff]], an epigenicist, was an 18th-century exception who argued for objectivity and freedom from religious influence on scientific questions.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

Despite careful observation of developing embryos, epigenesis suffered from a lack of a theoretical mechanism of generation. Wolff proposed an "essential force" as the agent of change, and [[Immanuel Kant]] with [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]] proposed a "developing drive" or ''[[:de:Bildungstrieb|Bildungstrieb]]'', a concept related to [[self-organization]].

Naturalists of the late 18th century and the 19th century embraced Wolff's philosophy, but primarily because they rejected the application of mechanistic development, as seen in the expansion of miniature organisms. It was not until the late 19th century that preformationism was discarded in the face of [[cell theory]]. Now, scientists "realized that they need not treat living organisms as machines, nor give up all hope of ever explaining the mechanisms that govern living beings." (Magner 173)&lt;ref name=Magner/&gt;

When [[John Dalton]]'s [[atomic theory]] of matter [[scientific revolutions|superseded]] Descartes' philosophy of [[infinite divisibility]] at the beginning of the 19th century, preformationism was struck a further blow. There was not enough space at the bottom of the spectrum to accommodate infinitely stacked animalcules, without bumping into the constituent parts of matter. (Gee 43)&lt;ref name=Gee&gt;[[Henry Gee|Gee, Henry]]. ''Jacob's Ladder: The History of the Human Genome''. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

== Roux and Driesch ==
Near the end of the 19th century, the most prominent advocates of preformationatism and epigenesis were [[Wilhelm Roux]] and [[Hans Driesch]]. Driesch's experiments on the development of the embryos of [[sea urchin]]s are considered as deciding the case in favor of epigenesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11693">A '''problem statement''' is a concise description of an issue to be addressed or a condition to be improved upon. It identifies the gap between the current (problem) state and desired (goal) state of a process or product. Focusing on the facts, the problem statement should be designed to address [[Five_Ws|the 5 W’s]] – who, what, where, when, and why. The first condition of solving a problem is understanding the problem, which can be done by way of a problem statement.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kush|first=Max|date=June 2015|title=The Statement Problem|url=|journal=Quality Progress|volume=48|issue=6|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Problem statements are widely used by businesses and organizations to execute process [[improvement]] projects. A simple and well-defined problem statement will be used by the project team to understand the problem and work toward developing a solution. It will also provide management with specific insights into the problem so that they can make appropriate project-approving decisions. As such, it is crucial for the problem statement to be clear and unambiguous.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Annamalai|first=Nagappan|last2=Kamaruddin|first2=Shahrul|last3=Azid|first3=Ishak Abdul|last4=Yeoh|first4=TS|date=September 2013|title=Importance of Problem Statement in Solving Industry Problems|url=|journal=Applied Mechanics and Materials|location=Zurich|volume=421|pages=|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
The main purpose of the problem statement is to identify and explain the problem. This includes describing the existing environment, where the problem occurs, and what impacts it has on users, finances, and ancillary activities.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Six sigma for dummies|last=Gygi|first=Craig|last2=DeCarlo|first2=Neil|last3=Williams|first3=Bruce|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2015|isbn=|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=76-78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the problem statement is used to explain what the expected environment looks like. Defining the desired condition provides an overall vision for the process or product. It makes clear the purpose for initiating the improvement project and the goals that it is meant to accomplish.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ceptara.com/blog/how-to-write-problem-statement|title=How To Write A Problem Statement|last=Lindstrom|first=Chris|date=2011-04-24|website=www.ceptara.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important function of the problem statement is to be used as a communication device. It helps with obtaining buy-in from those involved in the project.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Before the project begins, the [[Stakeholder_(corporate)|stakeholders]] verify the problem and goals are accurately described in the problem statement. Once this approval is received, the project team reviews it to ensure everyone understands the issue at hand and what they are trying to accomplish. This also helps define the [[Scope_(project_management)|project scope]], which keeps the project concentrated on the overall goal.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Commercializing Great Products with Design for [[Six Sigma]]|last=Perry|first=Randy|last2=Bacon|first2=David|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem statement is referenced throughout the project to establish focus within the project team and verify they stay on track. At the end of the project, it is revisited to confirm the implemented solution indeed solves the problem. A well-defined problem statement can also aid in performing [[Root_cause_analysis|root-cause analysis]] to understand why the problem occurred and ensure measures can be taken to prevent it from happening in the future.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

It is important to note that the problem statement does ''not'' define the solution or methods of reaching the solution. The problem statement simply recognizes the gap between the problem and goal states. It can be said that, “a problem well stated is half solved.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However, there are often multiple, viable solutions to a problem. Only after the problem statement is written and agreed upon should the solution(s) be discussed and the resulting course of action determined.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.proprojectmanager.com/problem-statement/|title=How to Write a Problem Statement|last=Shaffer|first=Deb|date=2017-07-12|work=ProProject Manager|access-date=2018-04-10|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Defining the problem ==
Before the problem statement can be crafted, the problem must be defined. It is human nature to want to begin working on a solution as soon as possible and neglecting the definition of the true problem to be solved. However, a poorly defined problem increases the risk of implementing a solution that does not fully meet the expected results. A problem cannot be solved if it is not completely understood.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.batimes.com/articles/cooking-up-business-analysis-success.html|title=Cooking Up Business Analysis Success|last=Shaffer|first=David|date=2015-12-21|website=BA Times|language=en-gb|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of defining the problem is often a group effort. It starts with meeting with the stakeholders, customers, and/or users affected by the issue (if possible) and learning about their pain points.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2018/04/02/take-these-steps-to-define-your-uiux-problem-and-avoid-haphazard-changes/#22f21cda7c6c|title=Take These Steps To Define Your UI/UX Problem And Avoid Haphazard Changes|last=Widen|first=Steven|date=2018-04-02|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-04-10|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since people often struggle with effectively communicating their issues, particularly to someone outside of the process, it is helpful to ask a series of “why” questions until the underlying reasoning is identified. This method, known as the “5 Why’s”, helps drill down to the core problem as many of the experienced frustrations could be mere symptoms of the actual problem.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Asking these additional questions as well as paraphrasing what the stakeholder had said demonstrates a degree of empathy and understanding of the problem.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The information collected from these initial interviews is only one part of problem analysis. Many times the problem extends to multiple areas or functions to which the stakeholders, customers, and users are unaware. They may also be familiar with what is happening on the surface but not necessarily the underlying cause. Therefore, it is just as essential to gather knowledge, information, and insights from project team members and subject matter experts concerning the problem.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Additional research materials, including work instructions, user manuals, product specifications, workflow charts, and previous project plans may also need to be consulted. Like most other stages in the process improvement project, defining the problem is often iterative as several rounds of discussions may be needed to get the full picture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Once the problem is understood and the circumstances driving the project initiation are clear, it is time to write the problem statement.

== Writing the problem statement ==
The problem statement will be used to gain project support and approval from stakeholders. As such, it must be action-oriented.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; More importantly, the problem statement must be written clearly and accurately in order to deliver successful results. A poorly crafted or incorrect problem statement will lead to a faulty solution, as well as wasted time, money, and resources.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There are several basic elements that can be built into every problem statement to decrease the risk of project failure. First, the problem statement must focus on the [[end user]]. A common mistake is focusing on “how” a problem will be solved rather than the current gap. Second, the problem statement shouldn’t be too broad. A benefit of using the “5 Why’s” approach is that it avoids over-simplicity by providing the details needed for understanding the problem and developing an appropriate solution. Finally, the problem statement shouldn’t be too narrow. Solution-bias stifles the creativity that arises while [[brainstorming]] a solution, which may result in a less-than-optimal experience for the user.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

It is useful to design and follow a specific format when writing a problem statement. While there are several options for doing this, the following is a simple and straightforward template often used in Business Analysis to maintain focus on defining the problem.

# '''IDEAL:''' This section is used to describe the desired or “to be” state of the process or product. It identifies the goals of the stakeholders and customers as well as assists in defining scope. At large, this section should illustrate what the expected environment would look like once the solution is implemented.
# '''REALITY:''' This section is used to describe the current or “as is” state of the process or product. It explains the pain points expressed by the stakeholders and customers. It should also include the insights and expertise of the project team and subject matter experts provided during problem analysis.
# '''CONSEQUENCES:''' This section is used to describe the impacts on the business if the problem is not fixed or improved upon. This includes costs associated with loss of money, time, productivity, competitive advantage, and so forth. The magnitude of these effects will also help determine the priority of the project.
# '''PROPOSAL:''' This section is used to describe potential solutions. Once the ideal, reality, and consequences sections have been completed, understood, and approved, the project team can start offering options for solving the problem. It can also include suggestions by the stakeholders and customers, although further discussions and research will be needed before a specific course of action can be determined.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 

Following this format will result in a workable document that can be used by all parties to understand the problem and elicit requirements that will lead to a winning solution.

== Example ==
Problem statements can vary in length, depending on the complexity of the problem. The following is an example of a simple problem statement for the creation of a Single Sign On capability:

'''IDEAL'''

Ideally our users would be able sign into their laptops and then automatically have access to all of the applications they need to use.

'''REALITY'''

In reality we use at least three applications every day to accomplish our work. Each application is protected by a password with different requirements for username &amp; password length. Passwords also expire at different times.

'''CONSEQUENCES'''

* Users waste approximately 2 minutes per day logging into multiple applications (500 users * 2 minutes per day = 1000 minutes in lost productivity; 1000 minutes = 16.67 hrs per day * $75/hr = $1250 per day).
* Helpdesk resolves approximately 6000 calls per year to reset forgotten passwords &amp; unlock accounts.
* Security risk as users will continue to write usernames &amp; passwords on sticky notes at their desks.

'''PROPOSAL'''

Have S/W Dev, Network Administration and business stakeholders collaborate to evaluate potential solutions for a Single Sign On capability.

A '''repair kit''' or '''service kit''' is a set of items used to repair a device, commonly comprising both tools and spare parts. Many kits are designed for vehicles, such as cars, boats, airplanes, motorbikes, and bicycles, and may be kept with the vehicle in order to make on-the-spot repairs. Some are considered essential safety equipment, and may be included [[survival kit]]s. In the military, personnel crossing large water bodies in aircraft may be equipped with a raft and raft repair kit. Other kits, such as those for watch repair or specific engine components, are used by professionals. Depending on the type, a repair kits may be included when buying a product, or may be purchased separately.

==Examples==

Road vehicles often include basic tools and spare parts which commonly fail. A bicycle repair kit, for example, normally contains tools as well as patches and glue to repair a punctured tire. Other kits that include patches and glue are used to fix holes in fabric items such as inflatable boats and tents.

Watercraft normally contain both safety equipment and repair kits as part of their emergency equipment.

Some automobiles, such as the [[Mitsubishi i-MiEV]], have an optional repair kit available. The [[Mercedes-Benz OM604 engine]] has an optional repair kit to help replace seals. The 1905 [[Western Tool Works (automobile company)|Gale Model A]] came with a repair kit.

In aerospace, kits have been developed for repairing the thermal protection tiles on the [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system#Early tile repair plans|Space Shuttle]] and to fix space suits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/22144-russian-progress-launch-spacesuit-repair.html|title=Russian Cargo Ship Launches Spacesuit Repair Kit to Space Station|work=Space.com|accessdate=26 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professionals who repair and maintain electronic equipment may have a kit containing a soldering iron, wire, and components such as transistors and resistors.

In medicine, a repair kit consisting of a plug and plastic mesh may be used during [[inguinal hernia surgery]].

A particular trade may use a repair kit as part of normal work, such as in watch repair and at automobile repair shops.

A '''"self-made man"''' (later expanded to include "self-made women") is a classic phrase first coined on February 2, 1832 by United States senator [[Henry Clay]] who referred to the self-made man in the United States senate, to describe individuals in the manufacturing sector whose success lay within the individuals themselves, not with outside conditions. [[Benjamin Franklin]], one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]], has been described as the greatest exemplar of the self-made man. Inspired by Franklin's autobiography, [[Frederick Douglass]] developed the concept of the self-made man in a [[Self-Made Men|series of lectures]] that spanned decades starting in 1859. Originally, the term referred to an individual who arises from a poor or otherwise [[disadvantaged]] background to eminence in financial, political or other areas by nurturing qualities, such as perseverance and hard work, as opposed to achieving these goals through [[Inheritance|inherited fortune]], family connections, or other privileges. By the mid-1950s, success in the United States generally implied "business success".

According to the 2017 "World Ultra Wealth Report" by research company [[Wealth-X]], self-made individuals, mainly men, have "largely driven" global "wealth creation" from 1997 through 2017. The report noted that while there are an increasing number of women who are designated as high net worth, most inherited their wealth and only a small percentage sourced their wealth as self-made.

In the intellectual and [[cultural history of the United States]], the idea of the self-made man as an archetype or cultural ideal has been criticized by some as being a [[myth]] or a [[cult]].

==Origins==
[[File:Benjamin Franklin by Joseph Duplessis 1778.jpg|left|thumb|Benjamin Franklin. c. 1785. Oil by Duplessis]]Benjamin Franklin, one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]], has been described as "undoubtedly the original self-made man."&lt;ref name="Slate_2014"&gt;{{cite news|last=Swansburg|first=John|title=The Self-Made Man: The story of America’s most pliable, pernicious, irrepressible myth |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/history/2014/09/the_self_made_man_history_of_a_myth_from_ben_franklin_to_andrew_carnegie.html|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=September 29, 2014 |access-date=November 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the greatest exemplar of the "self-made man".&lt;ref name="Pine_1916_BFB_HR_GP"/&gt; Both the [[American Dream]] and the self-made man concepts are inextricably linked and are rooted in American history. Franklin's autobiography was described by the editor of the 1916 edition, as the "most remarkable of all the remarkable histories of our self-made men".&lt;ref name="Pine_1916_BFB_HR_GP"/&gt; His autobiography, which was dedicated to his son [[William Franklin]], with the first chapter based on a 1771 letter to William,&lt;ref name="Franklin_HarvardClassics"&gt;{{Citation| title = Benjamin Franklin, his autobiography| last = Franklin | first = Benjamin| publisher = P.F.

Franklin's introduced the archetypal self-made man through his own life story in which in spite of all odds he overcame his low and humble origins and inherited social position—his father was candle-maker—to re-invent himself through self-improvement based on a set of strong moral values such as "industry, economy, and perseverance"&lt;ref name="Pine_1916_BFB_HR_GP"/&gt;{{rp|143}} thereby attaining "eminence" in the classic rags to riches narrative. Franklin's maxims as published in his ''Autobiography'' provide others, specifically his own son, with strategies for attaining status in the United States, described as a "land of unequaled opportunity" in the last quarter of the 18th century.&lt;ref name="Franklin_HarvardClassics"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pine_1916_BFB_HR_GP"/&gt;{{rp|143}}

In his 1954 book entitled ''The Self-Made Man in America: The Myth of Rags to Riches'', Irvin G. Wyllie described how on February 2, 1832 [[Henry Clay]] had "coined the phrase 'self-made men'" during his speech to the United States Senate.&lt;ref name="1955_review_Wyllie"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Review of "The Self-Made Man in America: The Myth of Rags to Riches" (1954) |first=John William |last=Ward |journal=Journal of American History  |volume=42 |number=2 |date=September 1, 1955 |doi= 10.2307/1897672 |url=https://academic.oup.com/jah/article-abstract/42/2/344/695032?redirectedFrom=fulltext |quote="Clay used the classic phrase to describe the autonomy of our manufacturers ... in behalf of a paternalistic tariff and the irony has persisted throughout the history of the idea of self-help.

If it were true, would gentlemen prefer ·supporting foreign accumulations of wealth, by that description of industry, rather than their own country? But is it correct? The joint stock companies of the North, as I understand them, are nothing more than associations, sometimes of hundreds, by means of which the small earnings of many are brought into a common stock; and the associates, obtaining corporate privileges, are enabled to prosecute, under one superintending head, their business to better advantage. Nothing can be more essentially democratic, or better devised to counterpoise the influence of individual wealth. In Kentucky, almost every manufactory known to me is in the hands of enterprising self-made men, who have acquired whatever wealth they possess by patient and diligent labor. Comparisons are odious, and, but in defence, would not be made by me. But is there more tendency to aristocracy in a manufactory, supporting hundreds of freemen, or in a cotton plantation, with its not less numerous slaves, sustaining, perhaps, only two white families-that of the master and the overseer?}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|100}}

The essential doctrine behind the self-made man is that success lies within the person himself and not with outside conditions. Wyllie investigated intellectual history, "not the history of a great abstraction but the saga of an idea that had power among the people." To Wyllie, success in the United States by the mid-1950s, generally implied "business success."&lt;ref name="Wylie_selfmademan_1954"/&gt;&lt;ref name="1955_review_Wyllie"/&gt;

Franklin and Frederick Douglass,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Frederick |last=Douglass |title=[[Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave]] |year=1845}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Frederick |last=Douglass |title=[[My Bondage and My Freedom]] |year=1855}}&lt;/ref&gt; describe the "self-made man in similar language: "Being possessionless and unencumbered by authority is the necessary beginning state for the potential self-made man. One cannot be “made” by the help of a father, teacher, mentor, etc.…, but must rise by one’s own grit, determination, discipline, and opportunism. The irony is that they have made themselves free from bounds and possessions, in a sense impoverished, so that they can then begin to acquire power and wealth on their own. The key is to acquire those possessions and power without help. The goal, then, is not to become famous or wealthy in the literal sense, but to participate in something precise and mythical."&lt;ref name="Dixon_thesis_2011"/&gt;

[[File:Frederick Douglass, head-and-shoulders portrait, facing right, ca 1850-1860 edit.jpg|left|thumb|Frederick Douglass, photographed between 1850 and 1860.]]Frederick Douglass developed the concepts in a series of lectures "[[Self-Made Men]]" from 1859 onward, for example 1895,&lt;ref name="Douglass_1895_selfmademen"&gt;{{cite web |series=The Frederick Douglass Papers at the Library of Congress: Speech, Article, and Book File |title=Self-Made Men: Address before the Students of the Indian Industrial School |quote="Self-made men […] are the men who owe little or nothing to birth, relationship, friendly surroundings; to wealth inherited or to early approved means of education; who are what they are, without the aid of any of the favoring conditions by which other men usually rise in the world and achieve great results."|location=Carlisle, Pennsylvania |agency=Library of Congress |year=1895}}Folder 1 of 16 (Series: Speech, Article, and Book File—B: Frederick Douglass, Undated)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|549–50}} which were published and archived in "The Frederick Douglass Papers at the Library of Congress".

That term implies an individual independence of the past and present which can never exist...Our best and most valued acquisitions have been obtained either from our contemporaries or from those who have preceded us in the field of thought and discovery. We have all either begged, borrowed or stolen.

Pine wrote in his introduction of the 1916 publication of ''The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin'', that Franklin's biography provided the "most remarkable of all the remarkable histories of our self-made men" with Franklin as the greatest exemplar of the "self-made man".&lt;ref name="Pine_1916_BFB_HR_GP"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.gutenberg.org/files/20203/20203-h/20203-h.htm |publisher=Henry Holt and Company via Gutenberg Press |year=1916 |editor-first=Frank Woodworth |editor-last=Pine |number=20203|title=Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin |others=Illustrated by E.

The idea of '''sexual script''' brings a new metaphor and imagery for understanding [[human sexual activity]] as social and learned interactions. The concept was introduced by sociologists [[John H. Gagnon]] and [[William Simon (sociologist)|William Simon]] in their 1973 book ''Sexual Conduct''. The idea highlights three levels of scripting: cultural/historical, social/interactive and personal/[[intrapsychic]]. It draws from a range of theories including [[symbolic interactionism]], discourse theory and [[feminism]].&lt;!-- It is the foundation of the new Critical Sexualities Studies and the reshaping of the field of sexualities studies in the late twentieth and early twenty-first century.--&gt; The theory of sexual scripting brings sociological, cultural, anthropological, historical and social psychological tools to the study of human sexualities. Whereas human sexuality is usually seen as the province of the biologist and the clinician, scripting helps research and analysis to understand sexualities as less biological and more cultural, historical and social.

== Sexual script ==
Sexual scripting suggests the importance of meanings and symbols in human sexuality. According to Gagnon and Simon, scripts can be layered through three dimensions: 'cultural scenarios', 'interpersonal scenarios', and 'intrapsychic scenarios'. Sexual feeling does not simply happen from within the body, but needs meanings and symbols which provide cues and clues to enable sexualities to develop. Cultural scenarios are linked to different historical periods and social change; scripts can be shown to change with the arrival of [[HIV/AIDS]] in the 1980s, for example (Epstein, Lauman ...). Interpersonal scenarios are linked to encounters and interactions (for example in rape, as illustrated in the early work of [[Stevi Jackson]]). And intra-psychic scenarios indicate the ways in which personal sexual 'turn ons' and imageries grow.&lt;!-- (cf [[William Simon (sociologist)|William Simon]]'s)--&gt; Sexual scripts can be seen as providing guidelines for appropriate sexual behaviour and sexual encounters, as sexual behaviour and encounters are learned through culture and others in interactions. It can be linked to theories of [[sexual desire]] but is critical of the tendency to stress the purely biological aspects of desire.

== Developments==
Drawing upon [[conversational analysis]],&lt;!--Frith and Kitzinger,--&gt; sexual encounters are considered to be scripted if the parties involved use any of these five linguistic devices:&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Frith, Celia Kitzinger, Reformulating Sexual Script Theory. Theory and Psychology, 11 (2). pp.&amp;nbsp;209–232. Sass, November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on sexual scripts and sexual script theory have concluded that sexual scripts are organised through gender, class, ethnicity and other social vectors.

Sexual script theory and its application in clinical practice are founded on the undeniable reality that the subjective understandings of each person about his or her sexuality (and called a sexual script) substantively determine that person's choice of sexual actions and the subsequent qualitative experiencing of those sexual acts. Scripts refer to social functions. They dictate what one should be doing at a particular time and in a particular place if one is to play the role characteristically associated with that script. There may be several people involved in the same situation, but they may differ in the roles that they have been given or have chosen to enact. Script theory is a form of social scripting theory which has been defined clearly by Michael W. Wiederman who says, "Social scripting theory points to the fact that much of sexual behavior seems to follow a script. Similar to scripts that stage actors use to guide their behavior, social scripts instruct members of a society as to appropriate behavior and the meanings to attach to certain behaviors."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Michael Wiederman, The Gendered Nature of Sexual Scripts. The Family Journal, Vol. 13, No. 4, 496-502. Sage Publications, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Social scripting theory directly relates to sexual scripts as it is just a specified example regarding sexual encounters and sexual behavior in social context. [[Social theory]] is also a useful resource in determining the construction of social scripts.

== Social constructionism ==
The theory is linked to the wider development of [[social constructionism]] on the socially created nature of social life.&lt;!-- See the social construction of sexuality.--&gt; Social construction is important to sexual script because sexual scripts can come from how a child is raised through the beliefs of social construction.&lt;ref&gt;Social Construction of Gender. http://employees.oneonta.edu/farberas/ARTH/ARTH200/gender.html&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, women are to be subjected to [[male gaze]] in order to be a part of the social construction system and maintain social norms of a long living society.

== Sexuality ==
Sexuality is the behavior of human beings with regard to the activities that causes or is associated with sexual arousal. It is influenced by the genetically inherited sexual response patterns, societal attitudes toward sex, and each individual's upbringing. "Physiology sets only very broad limits on human sexuality; most of the enormous variation found among humans results from learning and conditioning. What is deviant in one society may be normal in another. Sexuality covers gender identity, sexual orientation, and actual practices, as well as one's acceptance of these aspects of one's personality, which may be more important than their specifics."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/reproductive-health]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sexual norms ==
A [[sexual norm]] can be an individual or a social norm, which is a rule that is socially enforced. Norms affect a wide variety of human behavior.
Social norms regarding sexuality are present in most cultures. For example, the norm in most cultures consists of heterosexual acts between married individuals. Sexual norms are constantly changing and normal sexual behavior is a spectrum and cannot be rigidly defined. 
Deviance from normal sexual behavior is common and can be classified in several ways. If non-restrictive sexual norms are regarded positively they may be called "sexual freedom", "sexual liberation", or "free love". If regarded negatively they may be called "sexual license" or "licentiousness". Restrictive behavior when judged negatively is called "sexual oppression"; if judged positively they are called "chastity", "sexual restraint", The Maritial Effect, or "sexual decency".{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}
In the West, sexual normality can be defined as any sexual practice which does not involve sexual perversions. There has been a liberalization in attitudes which has resulted in the legalization of homosexuality in many countries. There is a tendency in Western countries toward serial monogamy as a normal heterosexual lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton L. Jones, Heather R. Hostler, Sexual Script Theory: An Integrative Exploration of the Possibilities and Limits of Sexual Self-Definition. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologists believe that emotion emerges in relation to dominant sexual scripts and [[sexual identity]]. Sexual script is also believed to have different scripts for males and females in relation to sexual activity. In sexual script's link to sexual activity; sexuality, sexual norms, social construction and gender roles all play a part in what makes sexual script differ between males and females.

== Gender script ==
{{Main|Gender Script}}
[[Gender schema theory]] also plays a part in sexual script because studies show that males and females interact in different ways, even from a young age. In 1991, Martha Boston and Gary Levy found that through their research observations, children, primarily boys, were better with being able to sequence own-sex rather than other-sex scripts.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Levy, Martha Boston, Preschoolers' Recall of Own-Sex and Other-Sex Gender Scripts. The Journal of Genetic Psychology, 155(3). pp.&amp;nbsp;369–371. 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; "As well as acquiring knowledge about the sex-role stereotypes of their culture, young children also develop sex-typed attitudes, preferences, and behaviors that pervade many aspects of their lives."&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Serbin, Kimberly Powlishta, Judith Gulko, The Development of Sex Typing in Middle Childhood. Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development, Volume 58, No. 2. 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

From an early age men are often raised to embrace their sexuality while women are usually brought up to suppress it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fahs|first=Breanne|date=2010|title=Daddy's Little Girls: On the Perils of Chastity Clubs, Purity Balls, and Ritualized Abstinence|url=|journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies|volume=31 |issue=3|pages=116|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anatomically, boys have the benefit (or curse) of genitals that are more easily viewed and handled by their owners. The young boy is taught to hold onto his penis to urinate and to handle it for purposes of washing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Conversely, the young girl is not taught to touch her clitoris. She is taught to wipe care- fully after urination so as not to contract an infection by transferring bacteria from her rectum to her vagina. The end result? Boys and girls are given two subtly different sets of messages regarding their own genitals. Boys readily discover that their genitals feel good when handled and are not necessarily any “dirtier” than other parts of their body that they can see.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Girls readily learn that their genitals are difficult, if not impossible, for them to see and that there are “dirty” aspects that require appropriate precautionary measures.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Similarly, gender roles may encourage sexual exploration more for boys than for girls.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A double standard exists in the traditional heterosexual sexual script. It endorses different sexual behavior for women and men, whereby women are expected to confine sexual behavior to the context of a committed relationship and men are expected to engage in sexual behavior in all kinds of relationships.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Young adult men who have not realized that their female peers hold a different set of sexual scripts are often perplexed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At a time when young adults have finally gained a marked increase in privacy from family (such as going away to college or getting married), it often seems obvious to young men that sexual activity should “naturally” occur now that a major barrier has been overcome.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Females who take such a view run the risk of being labeled deviant. To be too sexually interested or aggressive, especially outside the context of an intimate relationship, implies masculinity, or desperation, or some other flaw.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Ellen van Oost uses the concept of gender script "to illustrate the ways that the design of technological artifacts are affected by the gender assumptions held about their 'envisioned users.'" Drawing from Akrich's argument that, "like a film script, technical objects define a framework of action together with the actors and the space in which they are supposed to act,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Akrich |first=Madeleine |year=1992 |chapter=The de-scription of technical objects |editor1-last=Bijker |editor1-first=Wiebe E. |editor2-last=Law |editor2-first=John |title=Shaping technology/building society: Studies in sociotechnical change |publisher=The MIT Press |page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; van Oost extends the script approach to include the gender aspects of technological innovation.&lt;!-- Oudshoorn and Pinch describe van Oost's approach as "[adopting] the views that technological innovation[, which] requires a renegotiation of gender relations and an articulation of performance of gender identities" (10).--&gt; van Oost looks at the ways electric shavers are gendered for men and women starting in the late 1920s, including the "cigar" model for men and the "lipstick model for women." van Oost also argues that the development of the electric razor systematically constructs a gender script of technological incompetence as feminine, and "inhibits the ability of women to see themselves as interested in technology and as technologically competent, whereas the genderscript of [electric razors "for men"] invites men to see themselves that way. In other words: [electric razors] not only [produce] razors but also gender."&lt;ref name=vanoost&gt;van Oost, Ellen.

[[File:Ephesus37.jpg|thumb|[[Anthropomorphism|Personification]] of [[Wisdom]] ({{lang-grc-koi|Σοφία}}, {{transl|el|Sophía}}) at the [[Library of Celsus]] in [[Ephesus]] (second century).]]
'''Sophia''' ({{lang-grc-koi|[[wikt:σοφία|σοφία]]}} ''sophía'' "[[wisdom]]") is a central idea in [[Hellenistic philosophy]] and [[Hellenistic religion|religion]], [[Platonism]], [[Sophia (Gnosticism)|Gnosticism]], and [[Christian theology]]. Originally carrying a meaning of "cleverness, skill", the later meaning of the term, close to the meaning of ''[[Phronesis]]'' ("wisdom, intelligence"), was significantly shaped by the term ''[[philosophy]]'' ("love of ''sophia''") as used by [[Plato]].

In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] churches, [[Holy Wisdom]] ({{lang|grc|Αγία Σοφία}} ''Hagía Sophía'') is an expression for [[God the Son]] ([[Jesus]]) in the [[Trinity]] (as in the dedication of the church of [[Hagia Sophia]] in [[Constantinople]]) and, rarely, for the [[Holy Spirit]].

References to ''Sophia'' in [[Koine Greek]] translations of the [[Hebrew Bible]] translate to the [[Biblical Hebrew|Hebrew]] term ''[[Chokhmah]]''.

==Greek and Hellenistic tradition==
{{Further|Logos|Phronesis|Seven Sages of Greece|Gnosis}}
The [[Ancient Greek]] word ''sophia'' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:σοφία|σοφία]]}}, {{transl|grc|sophía}}) is the [[abstract noun]] of {{lang|grc|[[wikt:σοφός|σοφός]]}} ({{transl|grc|sophós}}), which variously translates to "clever, skillful, intelligent, wise". These words share the same [[Proto-Indo-European root]] as the [[Latin]] verb {{lang|la|[[wikt:sapere|sapere]]}} ({{Literal translation|"to taste; discern"|lk=on}}), whence {{lang|la|[[wikt:sapientia|sapientia]]}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pokorny (1959)]] [[s.v.]] [https://lrc.la.utexas.edu/lex/master/1652  sap-, sab- "to taste, savvy, perceive"].&lt;/ref&gt; The noun {{lang|grc|σοφία}} as "skill in handicraft and art" is [[Homeric Greek|Homeric]] and in [[Pindar]] is used to describe both [[Hephaestos]] and [[Athena]].

Before [[Plato]], the term for "sound judgement, intelligence, practical wisdom" and so on, such qualities as are ascribed to the [[Seven Sages of Greece]], was ''[[phronesis]]'' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:φρόνησις|φρόνησις]]}}, {{transl|grc|phrónēsis}}), from ''[[phren]]'' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:φρήν|φρήν]]}}, {{transl|grc|phrēn}}, {{Literal translation|"mind"}}), while ''sophia'' referred to technical skill. 

The term ''[[Philosophy|philosophia]]'' ({{lang|grc|φῐλοσοφῐ́ᾱ}}, {{transl|grc|philosophíā}}, {{Literal translation|"love of wisdom"}}) was primarily used after the time of [[Plato]], following his teacher [[Socrates]], though it has been said that [[Pythagoras]] was the first to call himself a philosopher. This understanding of ''philosophia'' permeates Plato's dialogues, especially the ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''. In that work, the leaders of the proposed [[utopia]] are to be [[philosopher king]]s: rulers who are lovers of wisdom. According to Plato in ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]'', Socrates himself was dubbed "the wisest [{{lang|grc|σοφώτατός}}, {{transl|grc|sophṓtatós}}] man of Greece" by the [[Pythia|Pythian Oracle]]. Socrates defends this verdict in ''Apology'' to the effect that he, at least, [[I know that I know nothing|knows that he knows nothing]]. Socratic [[skepticism]] is contrasted with the approach of the [[sophist]]s, who are attacked in ''[[Gorgias (dialogue)|Gorgias]]'' for relying merely on [[eloquence]]. [[Cicero]] in {{lang|la|De Oratore}} later criticized Plato for his separation of wisdom from eloquence.&lt;ref&gt;Herrick, James (2005). ''The History and Theory of Rhetoric: An Introduction''. Boston: Allyn and Bacon. p. 103. {{ISBN|0-205-41492-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sophia'' is named as one of the four [[cardinal virtues]] (in place of ''phronesis'') in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]''.

[[Philo]], a [[Hellenistic Judaism|Hellenized Jew]] writing in [[Alexandria]], attempted to harmonize Platonic philosophy and Jewish scripture. Also influenced by [[Stoicism|Stoic philosophical concepts]], he used the Koine term ''[[logos]]'' ({{lang|grc|λόγος}}, {{transl|grc|lógos}}) for the role and function of Wisdom, a concept later adapted by the author of the [[Gospel of John]] in the opening verses and applied to Jesus as the Word ([[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]]) of [[God the Father]].&lt;ref name="Harris John"&gt;[[Stephen L Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]], ''Understanding the Bible''. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985. "John". pp. 302–310&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Gnosticism]], Sophia is a feminine figure, analogous to the [[soul]], but also simultaneously one of the [[emanation]]s of the [[Monad (Gnosticism)|Monad]]. Gnostics held that she was the [[aeon (Gnosticism)|syzygy]] of Jesus (i.e. the [[Bride of Christ]]) and was the [[Holy Spirit]] of the [[Trinity]]. She is occasionally referred to by the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] equivalent of {{transl|grc|Achamṓth}} ({{lang|grc|Ἀχαμώθ}}; {{lang-he-n|[[wikt:חוכמה#Hebrew|חוכמה]]}}, {{transl|he|[[Chokhmah|ḥokhmāh]]}}) and as {{transl|grc|Proúnikos}} ({{lang|grc|Προύνικος}}).

[[Christian theology]] received the Old Testament personification of Divine Wisdom ([[Septuagint]] ''Sophia'', [[Vulgate]] ''Sapientia''). The connection of Divine Wisdom to the concept of the Logos resulted in the interpretation of "Holy Wisdom" (''Hagia Sophia'') as an aspect of Christ the Logos.&lt;ref name="GOC"&gt;[[Gerald O'Collins]], ''[[Christology: A Biblical, Historical, and Systematic Study of Jesus]]''.

The expression {{lang|grc|Ἁγία Σοφία}} itself is not found in the [[New Testament]], even though passages in the [[Pauline epistles]] equate Christ with the "wisdom of God" ({{lang|grc|θεοῦ σοφία}}).&lt;ref&gt;[[First Epistle to the Corinthians]] 1:24b {{lang|grc|Χριστὸν θεοῦ δύναμιν καὶ θεοῦ σοφίαν}} "Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God", 1:30 {{lang|grc| ἐξ αὐτοῦ δὲ ὑμεῖς ἐστε ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ ὃς ἐγενήθη ἡμῖν σοφία ἀπὸ θεοῦ δικαιοσύνη τε καὶ ἁγιασμὸς καὶ ἀπολύτρωσις}} "But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption"&lt;/ref&gt; The clearest form of the identification of Divine Wisdom with Christ comes in 1 Corinthians 1:17-2:13. In 1 Cor. 2:7, Paul speaks of the Wisdom of God as a [[Sacred mysteries|mystery]] which was "ordained before the world unto our glory". 

===Christology===
Following 1 Corinthians, the [[Church Fathers]] named Christ as "Wisdom of God".&lt;ref&gt;"Following St. Paul's reference to 'Christ who is the wisdom of God and the power of God', all the rest of the Church Fathers identified Sophia-Wisdom with Christ, the Second Person of the Holy Trinity"  Dennis O'Neill, ''Passionate Holiness: Marginalized Christian Devotions for Distinctive Peoples'' (2010), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=qjl1H9GcetMC&amp;pg=PA6  p. 6].&lt;/ref&gt;
Therefore, when rebutting claims about Christ's ignorance, [[Gregory of Nazianzus]] insisted that, inasmuch as he was divine, Christ knew everything: "How can he be ignorant of anything that is, when he is Wisdom, the maker of the worlds, who brings all things to fulfilment and recreates all things, who is the end of all that has come into being?" (''Orationes'', 30.15). [[Irenaeus]] represents another, minor patristic tradition which identified the Spirit of God, and not Christ himself, as "Wisdom" (''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Adversus haereses]]'', 4.20.1–3; cf. 3.24.2; 4.7.3; 4.20.3). He could appeal to Paul's teaching about wisdom being one of the gifts of the [[Holy Spirit]] (1 Cor. 12:8). However, the majority applied to Christ the title/name of "Wisdom". 

[[File:Hagia-Sophia-Laengsschnitt.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of the [[Hagia Sophia]] basilica (section)]]
[[Constantine the Great]] set a pattern for Eastern Christians by dedicating a church to Christ as the personification of Divine Wisdom.&lt;ref name="GOC"/&gt; In [[Constantinople]], under [[Justinian I]], the Hagia Sophia ("Holy Wisdom") was rebuilt, consecrated in 538, and became a model for many other Byzantine churches. 
In the Latin Church, however, "the Word" or ''Logos'' came through more clearly than "the Wisdom" of God as a central, [[Names and titles of Jesus in the New Testament|high title of Christ]].  

In the theology of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], Holy Wisdom is understood as the Divine Logos who became [[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnate]] as Jesus;&lt;ref name="PMP"/&gt; this belief being sometimes also expressed in some Eastern Orthodox icons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocafs.oca.org/FeastSaintsViewer.asp?FSID=108957 |title=OCA - Feasts and Saints |publisher=Ocafs.oca.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-30}}

There is a hagiographical tradition, dating to the late sixth century,&lt;ref name=Saxer&gt;V. Saxer, "Sophia v. Rom" in: ''Lexikon für Theologie und Kirche'' vol. 9 (1993), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=3n7YAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA733#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 733f.]&lt;/ref&gt; of a Saint Sophia and her three daughters, [[Saints Faith, Hope and Charity]]. This has been taken as the [[veneration]] of [[allegory|allegorical figures]] from an early time, and the group of saints has become popular in Russian Orthodox iconography as such (the names of the daughters rendered as {{lang|cu|Вѣра, Надежда, Любовь}}). The veneration of the three saints named for the three [[theological virtues]] probably arose in the 6th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{BBKL|f/fides_spes|band=17|autor= Ekkart Sauser|year=2000|artikel= Fides, Spes und Charitas: hl. Märtyrerinnen|spalte=381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iconography===
{{See|Holy Wisdom (iconography)}}
[[File:Holy Wisdom created home.jpg|thumb|"Wisdom hath builded her house" ([[:ru:Премудрость созда Себе дом|Премудрость созда Себе дом]], Novgorod, 16th century).]]
The Christological identification of Christ the Logos with Divine Wisdom (''Hagia Sophia'') is strongly represented in the iconographic tradition of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. A type of icon of the [[Theotokos]] is "Wisdom hath builded Her house" ([[:ru:Премудрость созда Себе дом|Премудрость созда Себе дом]]), a quote from Proverbs 9:1 ("Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars") interpreted as prefiguring the incarnation, with the Theotokos being the "house" chosen by the "[[Hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|hypostatic]] Wisdom" (i.e. "Wisdom" as a person of the [[Trinity]]).

===Christian mysticism===
{{see|Sophiology}}
In [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox mysticism]], ''Sophia'' became increasingly indistinguishable from the person of the ''Theotokos'' (rather than Christ), to the point of the implication of the ''Theotokos'' as a "fourth person of the Trinity".

Such interpretations became popular in the late nineteenth to early twentienth century, forwarded by authors such as  [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]], [[Pavel Florensky]], [[Nikolai Berdyaev]], and [[Sergei Bulgakov]].
Bulgakov's theology, known as "[[Sophiology|Sophianism]]", presented Divine Wisdom as "consubstantiality of the Holy Trinity", operating as the aspect of consubstantiality (ousia or physis, substantia or natura) or "hypostaticity" of the Trinity of the three hypostases, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, "which safeguards the unity of the Holy Trinity". &lt;ref&gt;[[Sergei Bulgakov]], "Sophia. The Wisdom of God" (1937/1993), p. 23-25; see also: [[Sergei Bulgakov]], "Hypostasis and hypostaticity: scholia to the unfading light" In: St Vladimir's Theological Quarterly 49(1-2)(2005), 5-46.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the topic of a highly political controversy in the early 1930s and was condemned as heretical 
in 1935.&lt;ref name="PMP"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pomazansky|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Pomazansky|title=Orthodox Dogmatic Theology: A Concise Exposition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7n6DoAEACAAJ|year=1994|publisher=Saint Herman of Alaska Brotherhood|isbn=978-0-938635-69-7 | pages=357 ff}}; online at {{cite web |title=Orthodox dogmatic theology: text - IntraText CT |url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0824/_P2O.HTM |website=Intratext}}&lt;/ref&gt;online [ Intratext.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orthodoxwiki.org/Sophianism |title=Orthodoxwiki states this also as heresy |publisher=Orthodoxwiki.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] tradition in England, [[Jane Leade]], seventeenth-century [[Christian mysticism|Christian mystic]], [[Christian universalism|Universalist]], and founder of the [[Philadelphians|Philadelphian Society]], wrote copious descriptions of her visions and dialogues with the "Virgin Sophia" who, she said, revealed to her the spiritual workings of the Universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hirst|first=Julie|authorlink=Julie Hirst|title=Jane Leade: Biography of a Seventeenth-century Mystic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m_afNy02glYC&amp;pg=PA72|year=2005|publisher=Ashgate Pub.|isbn=978-0-7546-5127-7|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Leade was hugely influenced by the [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|theosophical]] writings of sixteenth century [[Germany|German]] Christian mystic [[Jakob Böhme]], who also speaks of the Sophia in works such as ''The Way to Christ'' (1624).&lt;ref&gt;[[Jakob Böhme]], ''The Way to Christ'' (1622) [http://www.passtheword.org/DIALOGS-FROM-THE-PAST/waychrst.htm Passtheword.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Jakob Böhme was very influential to a number of [[Christian mysticism|Christian mystics]] and religious leaders, including [[George Rapp]] and the [[Harmony Society]].&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Versluis,  "Western Esotericism and The Harmony Society", ''Esoterica I'' (1999) pp. 20-47 [http://www.esoteric.msu.edu/Versluis.html MSU.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personification==
''Sophia'' is not a "goddess" in classical Greek tradition; Greek goddesses associated with wisdom are [[Metis (mythology)|Metis]] and [[Athena]] (Latin [[Minerva]]). By the [[Roman Empire]], it became common to depict the [[cardinal virtues]] and other abstract ideals, as female [[allegory|allegories]]. Thus, in the Library of Celsus in [[Ephesus]], built in the 2nd century, there are four statues of female allegories, depicting wisdom (Sophia), knowledge ([[Episteme]]), intelligence ([[Ennoia]]) and valour ([[Arete]]). In the same period, ''Sophia'' assumes aspects of a goddess or angelic power in [[Gnosticism]].

In [[Christian iconography]], Holy Wisdom or ''Hagia Sophia'' was depicted as a female allegory from the medieval period. In Western (Latin) tradition, she appears as a crowned virgin; in [[Holy Wisdom (iconography)|Russian Orthodox tradition]], she has a more supernatural aspect of a crowned woman with wings in a glowing red colour.
The virgin martyrs [[Saints Faith, Hope and Charity|Faith Hope and Charity with their mother Sophia]] are depicted as three small girls standing in front of their mother in widow's dress.

''[[Allegory of Wisdom and Strength]]'' is a painting by [[Paolo Veronese]], created circa 1565 in [[Venice]]. It is a large-scale allegorical painting depicting Divine Wisdom personified on the left and [[Hercules]], representing Strength and earthly concerns, on the right.

==Modern reception==
[[File:Statue_of_Sveta_Sofia.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Sophia in Sofia, Bulgaria]] 
A goddess ''Sophia'' was introduced into [[Anthroposophy]] by its founder, [[Rudolf Steiner]], in his book ''The Goddess: From Natura to Divine Sophia''&lt;ref name="Steiner "&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=o7XNn_THKKAC&amp;vq=Sophia&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s | title=The Goddess: From Natura to the Divine Sophia : Selections from the Work of Rudolf Steiner | publisher=Sophia Books, Rudolf Steiner Press | author=Steiner, Rudolf | authorlink=Rudolf Steiner | year=2001 | page=96 | isbn=1855840944}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a later compilation of his writings titled ''Isis Mary Sophia.'' Sophia also figures prominently in [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], a spiritual movement which Anthroposophy was closely related to. [[Helena Blavatsky]], the founder of Theosophy, described it in her essay ''What is Theosophy?'' as an esoteric wisdom doctrine, and said that the "Wisdom" referred to was "an emanation of the Divine principle" typified by "...some goddesses—Metis, Neitha, Athena, the Gnostic Sophia..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.age-of-the-sage.org/theosophy/what_is_theosophy.html |title=What is Theosophy? |publisher=Age-of-the-sage.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1970s, Sophia has also been invoked as a goddess in [[Dianic Wicca]] and related currents of feminist spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;Books relating to the contemporary pagan worship of the goddess Sophia include: ''Sophia, Goddess of Wisdom'', by Caitlin Matthews, ''The Cosmic Shekinah'' by Sorita d'Este and David Rankine (which includes Sophia as one of the major aspects of the goddess of wisdom), and ''Inner Gold: Understanding Psychological Projection'' by Robert A. Johnson.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1979 installation artwork ''[[The Dinner Party]]'' features a place setting for Sophia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/dinner_party/place_settings "Place Settings"]. Brooklyn Museum. Retrieved on 2015-08-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a [[Statue of Sveta Sofia|monumental sculpture]] of Holy Wisdom depicted as a "goddess" in [[Sofia]], the capital of Bulgaria (the city itself is named after [[Saint Sofia Church, Sofia|Saint Sofia Church]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bgtraveller.com/en/sofia/sights/stsophia.html|title=The Church of St Sophia, Sofia, Bulgaria|website=www.bgtraveller.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpture was erected in 2000 to replace a statue of [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]].

{{corporal punishment}}

'''Spanking''' is a common form of [[corporal punishment]] involving the act of striking the [[buttocks]] of another person to cause physical pain, generally with an open hand. More severe forms of spanking, such as switching, [[Paddling (punishment)|paddling]], [[Belting (beating)|belting]], [[caning]], [[Flagellation|whipping]], and [[birching]], involve the use of an object instead of a hand.

Parents commonly spank [[child]]ren or [[adolescent]]s in response to undesired behavior.&lt;ref name="Zolotor2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zolotor|first1=AJ|title=Corporal punishment|journal=Pediatric Clinics of North America|date=October 2014|volume=61|issue=5|pages=971–8|doi=10.1016/j.pcl.2014.06.003|pmid=25242709|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boys are more frequently spanked than girls, both at home and in school.&lt;ref name=Primordial/&gt; Some countries have [[Child_corporal_punishment_laws|outlawed the spanking of children]] in every setting, including homes, schools, and [[penal institution]]s,&lt;ref name="States which"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.endcorporalpunishment.org/progress/prohibiting-states/ |title=States which have prohibited all corporal punishment |publisher=Global Initiative to End All Corporal Punishment of Children}}&lt;/ref&gt; but most allow it when done by a parent or guardian.

==Terminology==
In [[North America]], the word "spanking" has often been used as a synonym for an official paddling in school,&lt;ref&gt;E.g. "Corporal punishment — spanking or paddling the student — may be used as a discipline management technique .... The instrument to be used in administering corporal punishment shall be approved by the principal or designee".[http://www.mwpisd.esc18.net/mhs/student_handbook/07_08/stu_handbook07_08.htm Texas Association of School Boards&amp;nbsp;– Standard Code of Conduct wording.] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070625124440/http://www.mwpisd.esc18.net/mhs/student_handbook/07_08/stu_handbook07_08.htm |date=25 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes even as a euphemism for the formal corporal punishment of adults in an institution.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. [http://www.corpun.com/cajur3.htm Evidence of Colonel G. Headly Basher, Deputy Minister for Reform Institutions, Ontario], Joint Committee of the Senate and House of Commons on Capital and Corporal Punishment and Lotteries, Canada, 1953–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[British English]], most dictionaries define "spanking" as being given only with the open hand.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary: "Spank: To slap or smack (a person, esp. a child) with the open hand." Collins English Dictionary: "Spank: To slap or smack with the open hand, esp. on the buttocks."&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[American English]], dictionaries define spanking as being administered with either the open hand or an implement such as a [[paddle (spanking)|paddle]].&lt;ref&gt;American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: "Spank: To slap on the buttocks with a flat object or with the open hand, as for punishment."&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the standard form of corporal punishment in US schools (use of a paddle) is often referred to as a ''spanking''.

In the [[United Kingdom]], Ireland, Australia and New Zealand, the word "smacking" is generally used in preference to "spanking" when describing striking with an open hand, rather than with an implement. Whereas a spanking is invariably administered to the bottom, a "smacking" is less specific and may refer to slapping the child's hands, arms or legs as well as its bottom.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary: "Smack: To strike (a person, part of the body, etc.) with the open hand or with something having a flat surface; to slap. Also spec. to chastise (a child) in this manner and fig."&lt;/ref&gt;

Parents commonly spank their children as a form of [[corporal punishment]] in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Zolotor2014"/&gt; It is normally done with one or more [[Slapping (strike)|slaps]] on the child's [[buttocks]] with a bare hand, although, not uncommonly, various objects are used to spank children.&lt;ref name="Zolotor2014"/&gt; Historically, boys have been spanked more than girls.&lt;ref name=Primordial&gt;{{cite book |author1=Straus, Murray A. |author2=Douglas, Emily M. |author3=Madeiros, Rose Ann |title=The Primordial Violence: Spanking Children, Psychological Development, Violence, and Crime |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |date=2013 |isbn=1848729537 |pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Elder"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Family Structure and Child Rearing Patterns: The Effect of Family Size and Sex Composition|jstor=2090309 |journal=[[American Sociological Review]] |year=1963 |first=G.H. |last=Elder|author2=Bowerman, C.

Corporal Punishment Begins With Infants, Is Highest For Toddlers, And Continues Into The Teen Years For Many Children}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main reasons parents give for spanking children are to make children more [[compliance (psychology)|compliant]] and to promote better behavior, especially to put a stop to children's [[aggression|aggressive]] behaviors.

However, research has indicated that spanking (or any other form of corporal punishment), tends to have the opposite effect.&lt;ref name="Zolotor2014"/&gt; Children who are physically punished more often tend to obey parents less with time, and to develop more aggressive behaviors, including toward other children.&lt;ref name="Zolotor2014"/&gt; This increase in aggressive behavior is thought to reflect the [[Social learning theory|child's perception]] that hitting is the way to deal with anger and frustration.&lt;ref name="Zolotor2014"/&gt; There are also a number of documented adverse physical, mental, and emotional effects of spanking and other forms of corporal punishment, including various physical [[injury|injuries]], increased [[anxiety]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], and antisocial behavior.&lt;ref name="Zolotor2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Development&gt;{{cite journal |last= Gershoff |first=Elizabeth T. |date= September 2013 |title= Spanking and Child Development: We Know Enough Now to Stop Hitting Our Children |journal= Child Development Perspectives |publisher= The Society for Research in Child Development |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=133–137 |doi=10.1111/cdep.12038 |pmid=24039629 |pmc=3768154}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children who were spanked during childhood are more likely to abuse their own children and spouse.&lt;ref name="Zolotor2014"/&gt;

The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] (AAP) states no child under the age of two should be spanked.&lt;ref name="Zolotor2014"/&gt; Additionally, the AAP recommends that [[primary care provider]]s (e.g., [[pediatrician]]s and [[family medicine]] [[physician]]s) begin to discuss parents' discipline methods no later than 9 months of age and consider initiating such discussions by age 3–4 months.&lt;ref name="Zolotor2014"/&gt; By 8 months of age, 5% of parents report spanking and 5% report starting to spank by age 3 months.&lt;ref name="Zolotor2014"/&gt; Primary care providers may recommend that a parent never spank their child; however, since spanking is a highly prevalent form of child discipline, this approach may lead parents to disregard a health care professional's advice and interfere with educational efforts to discuss alternative forms of discipline.&lt;ref name="Zolotor2014"/&gt;

Although parents and other advocates of spanking often claim that spanking is necessary to promote [[child discipline]], studies have shown that parents tend to apply physical punishment inconsistently and tend to spank more often when they are angry or under [[stress (psychology)|stress]].&lt;ref name=Guidance&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Committee on Psychosocial Aspects of Child and Family Health |title=Guidance for effective discipline |journal=Pediatrics |volume=101 |issue=4 Pt 1 |pages=723–8 |publisher=American Academy of Pediatrics |date=April 1998 |pmid=9521967 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/101/4/723}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of corporal punishment by parents increases the likelihood that children will suffer [[physical abuse]],&lt;ref name="Zolotor2014"/&gt; and most documented cases of physical abuse in Canada and the United States begin as disciplinary spankings.&lt;ref name=Gershoff2010&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gershoff, Elizabeth T. |date=Spring 2010 |title=More Harm Than Good: A Summary of Scientific Research on the Intended and Unintended Effects of Corporal Punishment on Children |url=http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/lcp/vol73/iss2/3/ |journal=Law &amp; Contemporary Problems |publisher=Duke University School of Law |volume=73 |issue=2 |pages=31–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a child is frequently spanked, this form of corporal punishment tends to become less effective at modifying behavior over time (also known as extinction).&lt;ref name="Zolotor2014"/&gt; In response to decreased effectiveness of spanking, some parents increase the frequency or severity of spanking or use an object.&lt;ref name="Zolotor2014"/&gt;

There are many effective alternatives to spanking and other forms of corporal punishment. For example, such techniques include time-ins (increasing attention, praise, and special time to promote desired behaviors), [[Time-out (parenting)|time outs]] (taking a break from escalating misbehavior), [[positive reinforcement]] (rewarding desirable behavior (e.g., with a star, sticker, or treat)), non-physical [[negative reinforcement]] (an unpleasant consequence follows misbehavior (e.g., replying with a sharp "no" expressing disapproval for a specific action or taking away a privilege)), passive inattention (ignoring low-level misbehaviors and prioritizing attention for more significant forms of misbehavior appropriate for a child's developmental level), and avoidance (avoid the opportunity for the misbehavior to occur and thus the need for corrective discipline).&lt;ref name="Zolotor2014"/&gt;

==In schools==

{{Main article|School corporal punishment}}
Corporal punishment, usually delivered with an implement (such as a paddle or [[caning|cane]]) rather than with the open hand, used to be a common form of school discipline in many countries, but it is now banned in most of the Western World.

Corporal punishment, such as caning, remains a common form of discipline in schools in several Asian and African countries, even in countries in which this practice has been deemed illegal such as [[India]] and [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Pak |first1=Jennifer |title=Malaysia's love for the cane is questioned |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26883902 |publisher=BBC News |date=5 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Corporal punishment 'widespread' in Indian schools |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-11617206 |accessdate=20 June 2018 |publisher=BBC News |date=25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Seale |first1=Lebogang |title=Severe corporal punishment still carried out at many SA schools |url=https://www.iol.co.za/news/opinion/severe-corporal-punishment-still-carried-out-at-many-sa-schools-11514666 |accessdate=20 June 2018 |publisher=IOL |date=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cultures it is referred to as "caning" and not "spanking."

The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in 1977 held that the paddling of school students was not ''per se'' unlawful.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ingraham v. Wright]], 97, S.Ct. 1401 (1977).&lt;/ref&gt; However, 31 states have now banned paddling in public schools. It is still common in some schools in the South, and more than 167,000 students were paddled in the 2011-2012 school year in American public schools.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/12/corporal-punishment/420420/|title=The States Where Teachers Can Still Spank Students|last=Anderson|first=Melinda D.|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students can be physically punished from kindergarten to the end of high school, meaning that even [[adult]]s who have reached the [[age of majority]] are sometimes spanked by school officials.&lt;ref name="corpun"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.corpun.com/counuss.htm |title= Corporal punishment in US schools |author= C.

Men spanking their wives and girlfriends was often seen as an acceptable form of domestic discipline in the early 20th century as a way to correct behavior, maintain male dominance, and enforce gender norms.

{{Example farm|section|date=February 2018}}

There are some rituals or traditions which involve spanking. For example, on the first day of the lunar Chinese new year holidays, a week-long 'Spring Festival', the most important festival for Chinese people all over the world, thousands of Chinese visit the Taoist ''Dong Lung Gong'' temple in Tungkang to go through the century-old ritual to get rid of bad luck. Men traditionally receive spankings and women get whipped, with the number of strokes to be administered (always lightly) by the temple staff being decided in either case by the god Wang Ye and by burning incense and tossing two pieces of wood, after which all go home happily, believing their luck will improve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Ring in the new year with a spanking for luck |url=http://www.corpun.com/twi00401.htm |work=Independent Online (South Africa) |date=26 January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Local campaigns==
===Canada===
Stop Murder Music (Canada) is an independent branch of the organization in [[Canada]], founded by Akim Adé Larcher, after learning at a local [[West Indian]] store about a Canadian Tour by Elephant Man.  Larcher, a Canadian/Saint Lucian, brought together over 20 organizations from the African and Caribbean communities in Canada to form the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mygsa.ca/SMMC |title=Stop Murder Music (Canada) (SMMC) &amp;#124; Egale Canada's |publisher=Mygsa.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Despite not causing any artists to be denied entry visas, the campaign was able to get concert venues cancelled&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Krishna Rau / Toronto / Thursday, October 11, 2007 |url=http://www.xtra.ca/public/viewstory.aspx?AFF_TYPE=3&amp;STORY_ID=3703&amp;PUB_TEMPLATE_ID=1 |title=Koolhaus cancels concerts amid queer outrage |publisher=Xtra.ca |date=2007-10-11 |accessdate=2012-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also get iTunes to remove some tracks by Buju Banton, Elephant Man and TOK that they deemed contrary to their standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=(Jenna Wakani photo) |url=http://www.xtra.ca/public/viewstory.aspx?STORY_ID=4593&amp;PUB_TEMPLATE_ID=2 |title=iTunes Canada pulls anti-gay dancehall songs |publisher=Xtra.ca |date=2008-04-07 |accessdate=2012-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
The [[Green Party of England and Wales]] and [[OutRage!]] campaigned on behalf of the stop murder music campaign, including petitioning the [[United Kingdom]] [[Home Secretary]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Reggae star barred from Britain. |url=http://www.petertatchell.net/pop_music/sizzla.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104071246/http://petertatchell.net/pop_music/sizzla.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-01-04 |title=Sizzla Denied Visa |publisher=Peter Tatchell |date= |accessdate=2012-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments for and against==
Tatchell has called for laws against homophobic music and the Campaign participated in protests outside concerts. The Campaign has especially objected to lyrics which they allege to support violence, including allegedly murder, towards gay men. Dennis Carney, chair of the Black Gay Men's Advisory Group, argued in 2004 that the [[MOBO Awards]] had a responsibility to exclude anti-gay artists because, "homophobic lyrics in music normalise hatred towards black gay men."&lt;ref&gt;Graver, Mark (2004). [http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/13190.php "Why homophobic lyrics in reggae music are a health issue for black gay men"], ''MedicalNewsToday.com''. Article Date: 10 Sep 2004 - 9:00 PDT.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The UK International Development Minister [[Gareth Thomas (English politician)|Gareth Thomas]] argued in a speech that, "A number of artists [such as Sizzla and Buju Banton] are effectively contributing to the spread of HIV by producing reggae and rap songs actually encouraging discrimination against those who have AIDS and encouraging violence against minority groups such as men who have sex with men...Yes, we believe in free speech, but nobody in a democracy should be able to incite violence against minorities."&lt;ref&gt;(22 November 2004).

[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2004/nov/22/health.aids "Reggae stars 'fuel spread of HIV'"], ''Guardian.co.uk''.&lt;/ref&gt; He cited John King and the [[Mighty Gabby]] as examples of musicians who are positive role models against violence and discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;Gareth Thomas.

=== Criticism ===
Tatchell and the Stop Murder Music campaign have been criticized by The Black Music Council, a British organisation formed in 2004 in response to the campaign by the president of Blacker Dread Records, [[Blacker Dread]], in order, "to protect the rights of the eight artistes placed on the OutRage! hit list".&lt;ref name="Roache"&gt;Alicia Roache, Staff Reporter.

[[File:Tameshigiri.jpg|thumb|''Tameshigiri'' using a ''goza'' target on a stand (2006)]]
'''''Tameshigiri''''' (試し斬り, 試し切り, 試斬, 試切) is the Japanese art of target '''test cutting'''.  The [[kanji]] literally mean "[[:wiktionary:試|test]] [[:wiktionary:切|cut]]" ([[kun'yomi]]: ためし ぎり ''tameshi giri''). This practice was popularized in the [[Edo period]] (17th century) for testing the quality of [[Japanese sword]]s.&lt;ref name="Kapp1987-41"&gt;Kapp (1987), p.41&lt;/ref&gt; It continues to the present day, but has evolved into a martial art which focuses on demonstrating the practitioner's skill with a sword.

== Origins ==
[[File:Ikidou.JPG|thumb|''Tameshigiri'' on a convicted criminal]]
During the [[Edo]] period, only the most skilled swordsmen were chosen to test swords, so that the swordsman's skill was not a variable in determining how well the sword cut. The materials used to test swords varied greatly. Some substances were ''wara'' (rice straw), ''goza'' (the top layer of [[tatami]] mats), [[bamboo]], and thin steel sheets.

In addition, there were a wide variety of cuts used on [[cadaver]]s and occasionally convicted criminals,&lt;ref name="Sesko2011"&gt;Sesko (2011), p.148&lt;/ref&gt; from ''tabi-gata'' (ankle cut) to ''O-kesa'' (diagonal cut from shoulder to opposite hip). The names of the types of cuts on cadavers show exactly where on the body the cut was made. Older swords can still be found today that have inscriptions on their ''nakago'' ([[tang (tools)|tang]]) that say things such as, "5 bodies with ''Ryu Guruma'' (hip cut)". Such an inscription, known as a ''tameshi-mei'' or ''saidan-mei'' (cutting signature) would add greatly to a sword's value,&lt;ref name="Man2011" /&gt; compensating the owner somewhat for the large sums of money typically charged for the test.&lt;ref&gt;Sesko (2011), p.149&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from specific cuts made on cadavers, there were the normal cuts of Japanese swordsmanship, i.e. downward diagonal (''Kesa-giri''), upward diagonal (''Kiri-age'' or ''Gyaku-kesa''), horizontal (''Yoko'' or ''Tsuihei''), and straight downward (''Jodan-giri'', ''Happonme'', ''Makko-giri'', ''Shinchoku-giri'' or ''Dottan-giri'').

There is an apocryphal story of a condemned criminal who, after being told he was to be executed by a sword tester using a ''Kesa-giri'' cut, calmly joked that if he had known that was going to happen, he would have swallowed large stones to damage the blade.&lt;ref name="Man2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Man|first=John|title=Samurai|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yRdqWcmZcH4C&amp;pg=PA55|date=10 February 2011|publisher=Transworld|isbn=978-1-4090-1105-7|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Today ==
[[File:Tameshigiri-pattern-tsubamegaeshi.png|thumb|upright=0.6|Diagram of the ''Tsubamegaeshi''  cutting pattern on a ''goza'' target]]
In modern times, the practice of ''tameshigiri'' has come to focus on testing the swordsman's abilities, rather than the sword's. Indeed, the swords used are typically inexpensive ones.&lt;ref name="Kapp1987-42"&gt;Kapp (1987), p.42&lt;/ref&gt;

Practitioners of ''tameshigiri'' sometimes use the terms ''Shito'' (試刀, sword testing) and ''Shizan'' (試斬, test cutting, an alternate pronunciation of the characters for ''tameshigiri'') to distinguish between the historical practice of testing swords and the contemporary practice of testing one's cutting ability. The target most often used is the [[tatami]] "omote" rush mat. To be able to cut consecutive times on one target, or to cut multiple targets while moving, requires that one be a very skilled swordsman.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Targets today are typically made from ''goza'', or rolled [[tatami]] omote, the top layer of the traditional Japanese floor covering, either bundled or rolled into a cylindrical shape. They may be soaked in water to add density to the material. This density is to approximate that of flesh. Green bamboo is used to approximate bone.

Once the ''goza'' target is in this cylindrical shape, it has a vertical grain pattern when stood vertically on a target stand, or horizontally when placed on a horizontal target stand (''dotton'' or ''dodan''). This direction of the grain affects the difficulty of the cut.

The difficulty of cuts is a combination of the target material hardness, the direction of the grain of the target (if any), the quality of the sword, the angle of the blade (''hasuji'') on impact, and the angle of the swing of the sword (''tachisuji'').

When cutting a straw target that is standing vertically, the easiest cut is the downward diagonal. This is due to a combination of the angle of impact of the cut against the grain (approximately 30-50 degrees from the surface), the downward diagonal angle of the swing, and the ability to use many of the major muscle groups and rotation of the body to aid in the cut.

Next in difficulty is the upward diagonal cut which has the same angle, but works against gravity and uses slightly different muscles and rotation. The third in difficulty is the straight downward cut, not in terms of the grain but in terms of the group of muscles involved. The most difficult cut of these four basic cuts is the horizontal direction (against a vertical target) which is directly perpendicular to the grain of the target.

There are a number of swordsmen who have recently set records in the field of ''tameshigiri''. Mitsuhiro Saruta, founder of Ryuseiken, set the initial [[Guinness World Record]] for completing 1000 cuts (senbongiri) in 1 hour 36 minutes on September 20, 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eonet.ne.jp/~ryuseiken/english/main.htm ''International Batto-do Shizan Association'']&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=January 2013}} In 2000, Russell McCartney of ''Ishiyama-ryū'' completed 1181 consecutive cuts without a missed attempt in 1 hour 25 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Brad|last=Wong |title=Seattle samurai marksman holds world record |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/Seattle-samurai-marksman-holds-world-record-1242980.php |location = Seattle |work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |date=6 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Saruta and McCartney performed ''senbongiri'' using a ''kata''-based approach as one of the criteria for their challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Russell|last=McCartney |title=Senbongiri |url=http://ishiyamaryu.net/resources/articles/senbongiri.htm |location = Seattle, WA |year=2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Isao Machii]] of Shūshinryū currently has the record for the fastest ''senbongiri'' performance of 36 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/11000/fastest-1000-martial-arts-sword-cuts ''Guinness World Records Website'': Fastest Time to Complete 1,000 Cuts]&lt;/ref&gt; Machii also holds records for the most cuts in three minutes (252), and the most cuts to a single free-standing target (7).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-10000/most-sword-cuts-to-straw-mats-in-three-minutes/ ''Guinness World Records Website'': Most Cuts In 3 Minutes]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-12000/most-martial-arts-sword-cuts-to-one-mat-(suegiri)/ ''Guinness World Records Website'': Most Cuts to One Mat]&lt;/ref&gt; The record for most cuts in one minute (83) is held by ''[[Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu]]'' practitioner Iaso Machii of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-9000/most-martial-arts-sword-cuts-in-one-minute// ''Guinness World Records Website'': Most Cuts In One Minute]&lt;/ref&gt; Toshishiro Obata holds the record for ''Kabuto Wari'', or helmet cutting, for his cut on a steel ''Kabuto'' (helmet).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shinkendo.com/kabuto.html ''Kabuto Wari'' Record]&lt;/ref&gt; Obata also holds the ''Ioriken Battojutsu'' speed cutting record for 10 cuts on 10 targets over three rounds.  His times are 6.4, 6.4, and 6.7 seconds respectively. Brandt Noel of San Yama Ryu Bujutsu holds the record of 19 mats with ''Katana'' using ''Kesa-giri''.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

[[Historical European Martial Arts]] reconstructors, under the term "test cutting", engage in similar exercises with various [[European sword]]s. While tatami ''omote'', green bamboo (though rarely), and especially meat are the preferred cutting targets, other substances are commonly used due to being cheaper, and much easier to obtain: [[pool noodle]]s, various gourds (pumpkins, squash, etc.), water-filled plastic bottles, soaked newspaper rolls, synthetic targets or wet clay.

==Target configurations==
[[File:Tameshigiri-pattern-yokonarabi.png|thumb|upright=0.6|Diagram of the ''Kihon toho'' ''tameshigiri'' cutting pattern performed on three targets]]
The targets can be placed in different configurations:
# Most frequently, there is a single stand on which a single target is placed vertically.
# A second configuration involves multiple targets in place vertically on a long stand (a ''yoko-narabi'').
# A third configuration involves multiple targets placed horizontally on a different type of stand called a ''dodan'' or ''dotton''.
# A fourth configuration involves single (#1) or multiple targets (#2), each on separate stands.
# A fifth configuration(particular to rolled ''goza'') involves multiple targets rolled together to create a thicker and denser target. This can be used in the previous configurations (#1, #2, #3)

"'''The captain goes down with the ship'''" is an [[idiom]] and maritime tradition that a [[sea captain]] holds ultimate responsibility for both his ship and everyone embarked on it, and that in an emergency, he will either save them or die trying. Although often connected to the [[Sinking of the RMS Titanic|sinking of the RMS ''Titanic'']] in 1912 and its captain, [[Edward Smith (sea captain)|Edward J. Smith]], the phrase precedes ''Titanic'' by at least 11 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=John |first=Alix |title=The Night-hawk: A Romance of the '60s|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DrUXAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22captain%20goes%20down%20with%20his%20ship%22&amp;pg=PA249#v=onepage&amp;q=%22captain%20goes%20down%20with%20his%20ship%22&amp;f=false |date=1901 |publisher=Frederick A. Stokes |location=New York |pages=249 |quote=...for, if anything goes wrong a woman may be saved where a captain goes down with his ship.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most instances, the captain of the ship forgoes his own rapid departure of a ship in distress, and concentrates instead on saving other people. It often results in either the death or belated rescue of the captain as the last person on board.

==History==
The concept is closely related to another protocol from the nineteenth century, "[[women and children first]]." Both reflect the Victorian ideal of [[chivalry]] in which the upper classes were expected to emulate a morality tied to sacred honour, service, and respect for the disadvantaged. The actions of the captain and men during the sinking of {{HMS|Birkenhead|1845|6}} in 1852 prompted praise from many due to the sacrifice of the men who saved the women and children by evacuating them first. [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s poem "Soldier an' Sailor Too" and [[Samuel Smiles]]' ''[[Self-Help (book)|Self-Help]]'' both highlighted the valour of the men who stood at attention and played in the band as their ship was sinking.

==Social and legal responsibility==
The idiom literally means that a captain will be the last person to leave a ship alive before its sinking or utter destruction, and if unable to evacuate the crew and passengers, the captain will not save himself even if he can.&lt;ref name=bbc2012&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-16611371 |title=Must a captain be the  one off a sinking ship? |work=[[BBC News]] |date=18 January 2012 |accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a social context, especially as a [[mariner]], the captain will feel compelled to take this responsibility as a type of [[Norm (social)|social norm]]. Shirking this responsibility in a crisis would go against societal [[mores]] because of the offender's lack of [[ethics]].

In [[maritime law]], the ship's master's responsibility for his vessel is paramount no matter what its condition, so abandoning a ship has legal consequences, including the nature of [[salvage rights]]. So even if a captain abandons his ship in distress, he is generally responsible for it in his absence and would be compelled to return to the ship until danger to the vessel has relented. If a naval captain evacuates a vessel in wartime, it may be considered a [[capital offence]] similar to desertion unless he subsequently returns to the ship at his first opportunity to prevent its capture and rescue the crew.

Abandoning a ship in distress may be considered a crime that can lead to imprisonment.&lt;ref name=bbc2012 /&gt; Captain [[Francesco Schettino]], who left his ship in the midst of the [[Costa Concordia disaster|''Costa Concordia'' disaster]], was not only widely reviled for his actions, but lost his final appeal against his 16-year Italian prison sentence including one year for abandoning his passengers, five years for causing the shipwreck, and ten years for manslaughter of its victims. Abandoning ship is a maritime crime that has been on the books for centuries in Spain, Greece and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://edition.cnn.com/2012/01/17/travel/cruise-ship-passenger-safety/index.html?_s=PM:TRAVEL |title=In a cruise ship crisis, what should happen? |first=Katia |last=Hetter |work=CNN |date=19 January 2012 |accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Korean law may also require the captain to rescue himself last.&lt;ref name=drewmouawad&gt;{{cite news |title=Breaking Proud Tradition, Captains Flee and Let Others Go Down With Ship |first1=Christopher |last1=Drew |first2=Jad |last2=Mouawad |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 19, 2014 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/20/world/asia/in-sad-twist-on-proud-tradition-captains-let-others-go-down-with-ship.html?_r=0 |accessdate=April 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Finland the Maritime Law (''Merilaki'') states that the captain must do everything in his power to save everyone on board the ship in distress and that unless his life is in immediate danger, he shall not leave the vessel as long as there is reasonable hope that it can be saved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1994/19940674 |title=Merilaki 6 Luku 12 §. 15.7.1994/674 - Ajantasainen lainsäädäntö |work=FINLEX, database of Finnish Acts and Decrees |year=2015 |accessdate=6 June 2015 |language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, abandoning the ship is not explicitly illegal, but the captain could be charged with other crimes, such as [[manslaughter]], which encompass [[common law]] precedent passed down through centuries.

*May 30, 1918: When the Italian [[Steamship|steamer]] ''Pietro Maroncelli'' was torpedoed by the German submarine [[SM UB-49|''UB 49'']] and started to sink, Italian Rear Admiral Giovanni Viglione, who was on board as the convoy commodore, ordered all the survivors into the lifeboats, then chose to stay aboard and to go down with the ship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uboat.net/wwi/ships_hit/4800.html Steamer Pietro Maroncelli - Uboat.net]&lt;/ref&gt;
*November 1, 1918: In the last days of [[Adriatic Campaign of World War I|World War I]], [[Croat]]ian [[Rear admiral]] [[Janko Vuković]], the first day he was appointed fleet commander, chose to go down with his [[flagship]] {{SMS|Viribus Unitis}} in [[Pula]] harbor as [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]] frogmen sank it with two 200-kg mines.
*November 23, 1939. [[HMS Rawalpindi|HMS ''Rawalpindi'']], a British armed merchant cruiser (a converted passenger ship) encountered  the German battleships ''[[German battleship Scharnhorst|Scharnhorst]]'' and ''[[German battleship Gneisenau|Gneisenau]]'' north of the [[Faroe Islands]]. Her captain, [[Edward Coverley Kennedy]], despite being hopelessly outgunned, ordered an attack. He went down with his ship.
*June 27, 1940. When [[Italian submarine Console Generale Liuzzi|Italian submarine ''Console Generale Liuzzi'']] was forced to surface by British destroyers in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], her commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander Lorenzo Bezzi, ordered his crew to abandon ship and then scuttled the submarine, going down with it.
*October 21, 1940. During the [[Attack on convoy BN 7|Battle of Harmil Island]], Italian destroyer ''Francesco Nullo'' was fatally damaged by [[HMS Kimberley (F50)|HMS ''Kimberley'']]. Her commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander [[Costantino Borsini]], chose to go down with his ship; seaman Vincenzo Ciaravolo, his attendant, chose to follow him.
*November 5, 1940. German pocket battleship ''[[German cruiser Admiral Scheer|Admiral Scheer]]'' encountered Allied [[Convoy HX 84]] in the North Atlantic. The convoy consisted of 38 merchant ships escorted by [[HMS Jervis Bay|HMS ''Jervis Bay'']], an ocean liner newly armed with guns of 1890s design. Her captain, [[Edward Fegen]] [[Victoria Cross|VC]], signalled the convoy to scatter, and attacked the enemy. ''Jervis Bay'' was hopelessly outranged and outgunned, and was sunk; her captain and many of her crew went down with her. The sacrifice bought enough time for 31 of the convoy to make it to safety.
*May 24, 1941: During the [[Battle of the Denmark Strait]], [[HMS Hood|HMS ''Hood'']] suffered a direct hit and magazine explosion, which sank the ship in three minutes. Only three people survived the disaster. One of the survivors, [[Ted Briggs]], said in interviews after the sinking that [[Lancelot Holland|Admiral Holland]] was last seen sitting in his chair, making no attempt to escape from the sinking ship. 
*May 27, 1941: Captain [[Ernst Lindemann]] of the [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']] was said to be with his combat messenger, a leading seaman, and apparently trying to persuade his messenger to save himself. In this account, his messenger took Lindemann's hand and the two walked to the forward flagmast. As the ship turned over, the two stood briefly to attention, then Lindemann and his messenger saluted. As the ship rolled to port, the messenger fell into the water. Lindemann continued his salute while clinging to the flagmast, going down with the ship.&lt;ref&gt;Grützner 2010, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGowen 1999, pp. 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt;
*December 10, 1941: Admiral Sir [[Tom Phillips (Royal Navy officer)|Tom Phillips]] and Captain [[John Leach (Royal Navy officer)|John Leach]] both went down with the [[HMS Prince of Wales (53)|Prince of Wales]] during [[sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|its sinking along with the Repulse]] by Japanese warplanes off the coast of [[Pahang]], [[British Malaya]].
*February 28, 1942: [[Schout-bij-nacht|Rear Admiral]] [[Karel Doorman]] was killed in action when his flagship {{HNLMS|De Ruyter|1935|6}} was torpedoed in the [[Battle of the Java Sea]]. Part of the crew was rescued before the sinking, but the Dutch admiral chose to go down with the ship. Captain Lieutenant [[Eugène Lacomblé]] also died in the sinking.
*June 5, 1942: Rear Admiral [[Tamon Yamaguchi]], on board the aircraft carrier [[Japanese aircraft carrier Hiryu|''Hiryu'']], insisted on staying with the stricken ship during the [[Battle of Midway]]. The ship's commander, Captain Kaku, followed his example.  In addition, Captain [[Ryusaku Yanagimoto]] chose to remain with his ship [[Japanese aircraft carrier Sōryū|''Sōryū'']] when it was scuttled after being destroyed in the same battle.
*February 7, 1943: Commander [[Howard W. Gilmore]], captain of the American submarine {{USS|Growler|SS-215|6}}, gave the order to "clear the bridge," as his crew was being attacked by a Japanese gunboat. Two men had been shot dead; Gilmore and two others were wounded. After all others had entered the sub and Gilmore found that time was critically short, he gave his [[last words|last order]]: "Take her down." The executive officer, hearing his order, closed the hatch and submerged the crippled boat, saving the rest of the crew from the attack of the Japanese convoy escort. Commander Gilmore, who was never seen again, received the [[Medal of Honor]] posthumously for his "distinguished gallantry," making him the second submariner to receive this award.
*November 19,1943: Captain [[John P. Cromwell]] went down on the sinking sub [[USS Sculpin (SS-191)|USS ''Sculpin'']].
*October 24, 1944: Admiral Inoguchi Toshihira&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ww2db.com/person_bio.php?person_id=308 |title=Toshihira Inoguchi |work=World War II Database |year=2015 |accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; chose to go down with the [[Japanese battleship Musashi|Japanese battleship ''Musashi'']], during the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]], even though he could have escaped.  Over half of the ship's crew, 1376 of 2399, were rescued.
*April 7, 1945: Admiral [[Seiichi Ito]], the fleet admiral, and Captain [[Kosaku Aruga]] went down with the [[Japanese battleship Yamato|Japanese battleship ''Yamato'']] during [[Operation Ten-Go]].
* December 30, 1950: [[Luis González de Ubieta]] (born 1899), [[exile]]d Admiral of the [[Spanish Republican Navy]], went down with his ship. He refused to be rescued when the ''Chiriqui'', a merchant vessel under his command, sank in the [[Caribbean Sea]] not far from [[Barranquilla]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Javier  (coord.) |last=García Fernández |title=25 militares de la República; "El Ejército Popular de la República y sus mandos profesionales |publisher=Ministerio de Defensa |location=Madrid |year=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*December 9, 1971: [[Mahendra Nath Mulla]] [[Maha Vir Chakra|MVC]] the captain of the Indian frigate {{INS|Khukri|1958|6}}, went down with the ship after it was attacked by a submarine in the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]]. At least 194 members of the crew died in the sinking, which reportedly took two minutes.
*October 29, 2012: Captain Robin Walbridge of the ''[[Bounty (1960 ship)|Bounty]]'', a replica of {{HMS|Bounty}}, stayed on the ship until it [[capsized]] during [[Hurricane Sandy]]. Fourteen crew members who made it to liferafts survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://thechronicleherald.ca/novascotia/696424-witness-recounts-claudene-christian%E2%80%99s-last-minutes-on-bounty |title=Witness recounts Claudene Christian’s last minutes on ''Bounty'' |first=Beverley |last=Ware |work=[[The Chronicle Herald]] |location=[[Halifax, Nova Scotia]] |date=15 February 2013 |accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*October 2, 2015:  Captain Michael Davidson, master of the cargo ship [[SS El Faro|El Faro]] was recorded on the Voyage Data Recorder encouraging the ship's helmsman, frozen by fear and exhaustion, to join him in abandoning the vessel, before the recording ended with both still on the bridge of the sinking ship.

==Counter-examples==
In some cases the captain may choose to [[Scuttling|scuttle]] the ship and escape danger rather than die as it sinks. This choice is usually only available if the damage does not immediately imperil a vast portion of the ship's company and occupants. If a [[distress call]] was successful and the crew and occupants, the ship's cargo, and other items of interest are rescued, then the vessel may not be worth anything as [[marine salvage]] and allowed to sink. In other cases a military organization or [[navy]] might wish to destroy a ship to prevent it being taken as a [[prize (law)|prize]] or captured for [[espionage]], such as occurred in the {{USS|Pueblo|AGER-2|6}} incident. Commodities and war [[material]] carried as [[cargo]] might also need to be destroyed to prevent capture by the opposing side.

In other cases a captain may decide to save himself to the detriment of his crew, the vessel, or its mission. A decision that shirks the responsibilities of the command of a vessel will usually bring upon the captain a legal, criminal, or social penalty, with military commanders often facing dishonor.

*July 17, 1880: The captain and crew of the {{SS|Jeddah}} abandoned the ship and their passengers in a storm expecting it would sink, but the ship was found with all passengers alive two weeks later. A key part of [[Joseph Conrad]]'s 1899-1900 novel ''[[Lord Jim]]'' is based on this incident; Conrad had been a captain in the merchant marine before turning to writing.
*August 4, 1906: Captain Giuseppe Piccone abandoned the {{SS|Sirio}} at the first opportunity. Between 150 and 400 people died when the ship sank.
*July 30 1945: The {{USS|Indianapolis|CA-35|6}} was torpedoed and sunk by a Japanese submarine. Captain [[Charles B. McVay III]] managed to survive in shark-infested waters for three days before the survivors were discovered, and later became the only captain in the history of the U.S. Navy to face court-martial for his ship being sunk by enemy action. He committed suicide on November 6, 1968, and was cleared of wrongdoing by the Secretary of the Navy in 2001.
*November 12, 1965: When a fire broke out aboard the {{SS|Yarmouth Castle}}, Captain Byron Voustinas was on the first lifeboat, which had only crew and no passengers aboard. 90 people died.
*April 7, 1990: Having been erroneously informed the ship was evacuated, Captain Hugo Larsen abandoned the {{MS|Scandinavian Star}} after arson caused the ship to burn. 158 people died.
*August 3–4, 1991: Captain [[Yiannis Avranas]] of the cruise ship [[MTS Oceanos|MTS ''Oceanos'']] abandoned ship without informing passengers that the ship was sinking. All passengers survived. A Greek board of inquiry found Avranas and four officers negligent in their handling of the disaster.
*January 13, 2012: Captain [[Francesco Schettino]] abandoned ship during the [[Costa Concordia disaster|''Costa Concordia'' disaster]]. 32 people died in the accident. Schettino was sentenced to 16 years in prison for his role in the disaster. 
*April 16, 2014: Captain Lee Joon-seok abandoned the South Korean ferry [[Sinking of the MV Sewol|MV ''Sewol'']]. The captain and much of the crew were saved, while hundreds of students from [[Danwon High School]] embarked for their trip remained in their cabins, according to instructions provided by the crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=참사 2주째 승무원도 제대로 파악 안돼 |trans-title=Exact Number of Crew still not known 2 weeks after the ferry disaster |url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/society/society_general/634984.html |accessdate=3 May 2014 |newspaper=[[The Hankyoreh]] |date=20 April 2014 |language=Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=drewmouawad/&gt; Many passengers apparently remained on the sinking vessel and died. Following this incident, the captain was arrested and put on trial beginning in early June 2014, when video footage filmed by some survivors and news broadcasters showed him being rescued by a coast guard vessel. Orders to abandon ship never came, and the vessel sank with all [[life raft]]s still in their stowage position. The captain was subsequently sentenced to 36 years in prison for his role in the deaths of the passengers, and was also given a life sentence, after being found guilty of murder of the 304 passengers that did not survive.
*June 1, 2015: The Chinese captain of the river cruise ship ''[[Dong Fang Zhi Xing]]'' left the ship before most passengers were rescued. On June 13, 442 deaths were confirmed with 12 rescued among 454 on board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Yangtze River Ship Captain Faces Questions on Sinking |publisher=The Wall Street Journal |date=June 2, 2015 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/yangtze-river-ferry-captain-faces-questions-on-sinking-1433237962}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the deadliest peacetime maritime disaster in China's history.{{Cn|date=May 2018}}

==Extended or metaphorical use==
When used metaphorically, the "captain" may be simply the leader of a group of people, "the ship" may refer to some other place that is threatened by catastrophe, and "going down" with it may refer to a situation that implies a severe penalty or death. It is common for references to be made in the case of the military and when leadership during the situation is clear. So when a raging fire threatens to destroy a mine, the mine's supervisor, the "captain," may perish in the fire trying to rescue his workers trapped inside, and acquaintances might say that he went down with his ship or that he "died trying."

===In aviation===
[[Image:561016PanAmDitches-5.jpg|thumb|right|Pan Am Flight 6 successfully ditches in the Pacific Ocean with Captain Ogg on the second of two life rafts. The airplane sank a few minutes after this photo was taken.]]
The concept has been explicitly extended in law to the [[pilot in command]] of an aircraft, in the form of laws stating that he "[has] final authority and responsibility for the operation and safety of the flight."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?rgn=div8&amp;node=14:1.0.1.1.1.0.1.1 |title=Title 14  Chapter I  Subchapter A  Part 1  §1.1 |work=[[Code of Federal Regulations]] |year=2015 |accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jurisprudence]] has explicitly interpreted this by analogy with the captain of a sea vessel.

This is particularly relevant when an aircraft is forced to ditch in the ocean and becomes a floating vessel that will almost certainly sink. For example, following the crash of [[US Airways Flight 1549]] into the [[Hudson River]], pilot [[Chesley Sullenberger]] was the last person to exit the partially-submerged aircraft, and performed a final check for any others on board before doing so.

Similarly, on October 16, 1956, [[Pan Am Flight 6]] was a [[Boeing 377 Stratocruiser]] en route from Honolulu to San Francisco that was forced to ditch in the Pacific Ocean due to multiple engine failures. The airliner broke apart when one of its wings collided with a wave swell. Airline Captain Richard N. Ogg was the last to exit the airplane during the successful mid-ocean ditching and rescue of all 31 on board by the US Coast Guard Cutter [[USCGC Pontchartrain (WHEC-70)|USCGC ''Pontchartrain'']]. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thisdayinaviation.com/16-october-1956/ This Day in Aviation, 16 October 1956], 2016, Bryan R. Swopes&lt;/ref&gt; The airplane fuselage sank with no one on board a few minutes later.

===In academia===
After a major scandal at [[Baylor University]], the university fired President [[Kenneth Starr]] and appointed him chancellor. A week later, Starr resigned as chancellor and "willingly accepted responsibility" for the actions of Baylor that "clearly fell short." He stated that his resignation for the scandal was "a matter of conscience," and said, "The captain goes down with the ship."&lt;ref name=espn&gt;http://espn.go.com/college-sports/story/_/id/15875833/kenneth-starr-resign-chancellor-baylor-continue-teach&lt;/ref&gt; He indicated that his resignation was necessary even though he "didn't know what was happening."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7176">'''Tolerance tax''' (Toleranzgebührer) was a [[tax]] that was levied against [[Jews]] of [[Hungary]], then part of the [[Austrian Empire]], between 1747 and 1797.&lt;ref name="jg"&gt;JewishGen. Hungary: Assorted Census Records, 1781-1850 [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: The Generations Network, Inc., 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tax was based on the German statute that a Jew was obliged to pay a certain tax to be "tolerated".&lt;ref&gt;Wine and thorns in Tokay Valley: Jewish life in Hungary : the history of Abaújszántó, by Zahava Szász Stessel, Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 1995, p. 50-51&lt;/ref&gt;

==Under Maria Theresa (1740–1780)==

In 1747, during the reign of Empress [[Maria Theresa]], the Jews of Hungary were taxed for the privilege of remaining in the empire, and were threatened with expulsion if they did not pay.&lt;ref name="jg"/&gt; 

On September 1, 1749, the delegates of the Hungarian Jews, except those from [[Szatmár]] County, assembled at Pressburg and met a royal commission, which informed them that they would be expelled from the country if they did not pay this tax. The frightened Jews at once agreed to do so; and the commission then demanded a yearly tax of 50,000 [[Austro-Hungarian gulden|gulden]]. This sum being excessive, the delegates protested; and although the queen had fixed 30,000 gulden as the minimum tax, they were finally able to compromise on the payment of 20,000 gulden a year for a period of eight years. The delegates were to apportion this amount among the districts; the districts, their respective sums among the communities; and the communities, theirs among the individual members.

The queen confirmed this agreement of the commission, except the eight-year clause, changing the period to three years, which she subsequently made five. The agreement, thus ratified by the queen, was brought on November 26 before the courts, which were powerless to relieve the Jews from the payment of this ''Malkegeld'' (queen's money), as they called it.

The Jews, thus burdened by new taxes, thought the time ripe for taking steps to remove their oppressive [[Disabilities (Jewish)|disabilities]]. While still at Presburg the delegates had brought their grievances before the mixed commission that was called ''delegata in puncto tolerantialis taxae et gravaminum Judeorum commissio mixta''. These complaints pictured the distress of the Jews of that time. They were not allowed to live in [[Croatia]] and [[Slavonia]], in [[Baranya (county)|Baranya]] and [[Heves County (former)|Heves]] Counties, or in several free royal towns and localities; nor might they visit the markets there. At Stuhlweissenburg ([[Székesfehérvár]]) they had to pay a poll-tax of 1 gulden, 30 [[kreuzer]] if they entered the city during the day, if only for an hour. In many places they might not even stay overnight. They therefore begged permission to settle, or at least to visit the fairs, in Croatia and Slavonia and in those places from which they had been driven in consequence of the jealousy of the [[Greeks]] and the merchants.

The Jews also had to pay heavier bridge-and ferry-tolls than the Christians; at Nagyszombat ([[Trnava]]) they had to pay three times the ordinary sum, namely, for the driver, for the vehicle, and for the animal drawing the same; and in three villages belonging to the same district they had to pay [[Toll road|toll]], although there was no toll-gate. Jews living on the estates of the nobles had to give their wives and children as [[Security interest#Pledge|pledge]]s for [[arrears]] of taxes. In Upper Hungary they asked for the revocation of the Tolerance tax imposed by the chamber of Zips County ([[Szepes]], [[Spiš]]), on the ground that otherwise the Jews living there would have to pay two such taxes; and they asked also to be relieved from a similar tax paid to the Diet. Finally, they requested that Jewish [[artisan]]s might be allowed to follow their trades in their homes undisturbed.

The commission laid these complaints before the Queen, indicating the manner in which they could be relieved; and their suggestions were subsequently willed by the queen and made into law.

The queen relieved the Jews from the Tolerance tax in Upper Hungary only. In regard to the other complaints she ordered that the Jews should specify them in detail, and that the government should remedy them insofar as they came under its jurisdiction.

The Tolerance tax had hardly been instituted when [[Michael Hirsch]] petitioned the government to be appointed primate of the Hungarian Jews in order to be able to settle difficulties that might arise among them, and to collect the tax. The government did not recommend Hirsch, but decided that in case the Jews should refuse to pay, it might be advisable to appoint a primate to adjust the matter.

Before the end of the period of five years the delegates of the Jews again met the commission at Pressburg ([[Bratislava]]) and offered to increase the amount of their tax to 25,000 gulden a year if the queen would promise that it should remain at that sum for the next ten years. The queen had other plans, however; not only did she dismiss the renewed ''gravamina'' of the Jews, but rather imposed stiffer regulations upon them. Their tax of 20,000 gulden was increased to 30,000 gulden in 1760; to 50,000 in 1772; to 80,000 in 1778; and to 160,000 in 1813.

The method of calculating the Tolerance tax varied over time and location, according to the size of household, occupation, and income-producing assets.&lt;ref name="jg"/&gt;

==Under Joseph II==

In 1783, Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], the son of Maria Theresa, allowed Jews to settle in [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]], while enacting a tolerance tax, which the Jews had to pay to the town.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Budapest.html The Virtual Jewish History Tour Budapest, By Rebecca Weiner]&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1789, the Jews paid a tolerance tax of 4 guilder per family, a [[Kosher tax|tax on kosher meat]], a marriage tax, a tax on the synagogues and cemeteries of 100 guilder per year, and a quota tax of 50 guilder per year.&lt;ref name="jg2"/&gt;

In 1797, after the death of Joseph II, the tolerance tax and the taxes on homes and properties were replaced by a candle tax on Jewish religious candles.&lt;ref name="jg2"&gt;[http://www.jewishgen.org/Yizkor/rzeszow/rze047.html JewishGen, The History of the Jews of Rzeszow, Chapter 7, p. 47]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Croatia, Slavonia, and Dalmatia, further rights were granted to Jews in 1840, but the "tolerance tax" remained in force. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.porges.net/JewishHistoryOfYugoslavia.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Universal Space Interface Standard''' ('''USIS''') is a physical interface between medium to large manned or unmanned spacecraft such as satellites, [[space station]]s and service tugs.&lt;ref name= USISA/&gt; It is designed to be suitable for adoption as an [[technical standard|industry standard]]. Development is currently being undertaken by [[Mark Hempsell]] at Hempsell Astronautics Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hempsellastro.com/about/|title= Hempsell Astronautics Company Information|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale for the creation of an industry standard for spacecraft interfaces is that the number of applications for space vehicles is likely to increase greatly in the future ([[space tourism]] being a recent example). If each craft is utilising a common interface many new applications become feasible. This is somewhat analogous to the benefits which have been gained by widespread adoption of the [[USB]] connector in computing or even the standardisation of [[AC power plugs and sockets]] across some parts of the world.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:USIS Designs.jpeg|thumbnail|right|Three designs for USIS proposed by [[Reaction Engines]], [[Qinetiq]] and Hempsell Astronautics.]] --&gt;
The fundamental purpose of USIS has been stated to "be a standard connection that maximises the interconnectivity between independent systems in both the open space (orbital) and celestial body surface environments".&lt;ref name= USISSpec&gt;{{Cite report |author= USIS Association|authorlink= |coauthors= |date= 28 April 2014|title= Requirement Specification for a universal space interface standard DRAFT|url= http://www.usisassociation.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/USIS-Requirement-Specification-Draft-Fb.pdf|publisher= |page= |docket= |accessdate= 28 September 2014|quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; To achieve this USIS must be suitable for a range of connection types, from ground made connections to hard docking between orbiting spacecraft. It must also be highly interconnectable (for example being fully androgynous, any two USISs being compatible), capable of bearing expected loads, capable of soft capture, and be able to sever the connection in a controlled manner. USIS also needs to be able to facilitate data, power and resource transfer when connected, and allow easy passage of personnel who are not necessarily trained astronauts in anticipation of the [[Space Tourism]] industry.&lt;ref name= USISSpec/&gt;

'''Vegetarianism''' {{IPAc-en|v|ɛ|dʒ|ɪ|ˈ|t|ɛər|i|ə|n|ɪ|z|əm}} is the practice of abstaining from the consumption of  [[meat]] ([[red meat]], [[poultry]], [[seafood]], and the [[flesh]] of any other [[animal]]),&lt;!--NOTE: Specifying what is meant by "meat" is necessary because some people don't consider poultry or seafood to be "real meat", and may think of eating either as still being vegetarian, as has been extensively discussed on the talk page. The specifics regarding this are mentioned lower in the lead and body of the article.--&gt; and may also include abstention from [[by-product]]s of [[animal slaughter]].&lt;!--NOTE: See the sources and past talk page discussions for the addition of by-products of animal slaughter. As many vegetarians are unaware of certain animal-derived products hidden in their foods or do not care if they consume them, and others are vegetarians not for ethical reasons, it was decided that "may also abstain," or some variation of that, is neutral and more accurate wording for this information.--&gt;&lt;ref name="vegsoc.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vegsoc.org/page.aspx?pid=508|title=What is a vegetarian?|publisher=[[Vegetarian Society]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180318164124/https://www.vegsoc.org/page.aspx?pid=508|archive-date=March 18, 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=March 18, 2018|quote={{pb}}A vegetarian is someone who lives on a diet of grains, pulses, legumes, nuts, seeds, vegetables, fruits, fungi, algae, yeast and/or some other non-animal-based foods (e.g. salt) with, or without, dairy products, honey and/or eggs.

Some of these people may be unaware that these hidden animal ingredients even exist.

Vegetarianism may be adopted for various reasons.  Many people [[ethics of eating meat|object to eating meat]] out of respect for [[sentient]] life. Such ethical motivations have been codified [[vegetarianism and religion|under various religious beliefs]], as well as [[animal rights]] advocacy. Other motivations for vegetarianism are health-related, political, [[Environmental vegetarianism|environmental]], cultural, [[aesthetic]], [[Economic vegetarianism|economic]], or personal preference. There are variations of the diet as well: an [[ovo-lacto vegetarian]] diet includes both eggs and dairy products, an [[ovo-vegetarian]] diet includes eggs but not dairy products, and a [[lacto-vegetarian]] diet includes dairy products but not eggs. A [[vegan]] diet excludes all [[animal product]]s, including eggs and dairy. Some vegans also avoid other animal products such as [[beeswax]], leather or silk clothing, and goose-fat shoe polish.

Packaged and processed foods, such as cakes, cookies, candies, chocolate, yogurt, and [[marshmallow]]s, often contain unfamiliar animal ingredients, so may be a special concern for vegetarians due to the likelihood of such additions.&lt;ref name="navs-online.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vegsoc.org2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vegsoc.org/page.aspx?pid=729|title=Fact Sheets: Things to look out for if you are a vegetarian/vegan|date=September 2015|publisher=Vegetarian Society|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180318175347/https://www.vegsoc.org/page.aspx?pid=729|archive-date=March 18, 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=March 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, prior to purchase or consumption, vegetarians will scrutinize products for animal-derived ingredients.&lt;ref name="vegsoc.org2"/&gt; Vegetarians' feelings vary with regard to these ingredients.

==Etymology==
The first discovered written use of the term "vegetarian" dates to 1839 and refers to what was previously described as a vegetable regimen or diet, for example in print in 1811.&lt;ref&gt;Rod Preece, ''Sins of the Flesh: A History of Ethical Vegetarian Thought'', Vancouver: University of British Columbia Press, 2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=uMnubkF5HjAC&amp;pg=PA12 12].&lt;/ref&gt; Modern dictionaries based on scientific linguistic principles have always explained its origin as an irregular compound of ''[[vegetable]]'' (in the adjectival sense of any plant still common today)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vegetable ]&lt;/ref&gt; and the suffix ''[[wikt:-arian|-arian]]'' (in the sense of "supporter, believer" as in ''[[wikt:humanitarian|humanitarian]]''), but there were amateur attempts, even by a Latin scholar not trained in linguistics, to find other origins of the word.&lt;ref name="VegetusMyth"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vegsource.com/john-davis/the-vegetus-myth.html|title=The Vegetus Myth|last=Davis|first=John|date=June 1, 2011|website=VegSource|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180318213259/https://www.vegsource.com/john-davis/the-vegetus-myth.html|archive-date=March 18, 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=March 18, 2018|quote=Vegetarian can equally be seen as derived from the late Latin '{{lang|la|vegetabile}}' – meaning plant – as in {{lang|la|Regnum Vegetabile}} / Plant Kingdom. Hence vegetable, vegetation – and vegetarian. Though others suggest that 'vegetable' itself is derived from 'vegetus'. But it's very unlikely that the originators went through all that either – they really did just join 'vegetable+arian', as the dictionaries have said all along.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The term was popularized with the foundation of the [[Vegetarian Society]] in [[Manchester]] in 1847,&lt;ref name=OED&gt;''OED'' vol. 19, second edition (1989), p. 476; ''Webster’s Third New International Dictionary'' p. 2537; ''The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology'', ''Oxford'', 1966, p. 972; ''The Barnhart Dictionary of Etymology'' (1988), p. 1196; Colin Spencer, ''The Heretic's Feast. A History of Vegetarianism'', London 1993, p. 252. The ''OED'' writes that the word came into general use after the formation of the Vegetarian Society at Ramsgate in 1847, though it offers two examples of usage from 1839 and 1842: 
* 1839: "If I had had to be my own cook, I should inevitably become a vegetarian." (F. A. Kemble, ''Jrnl. Residence on Georgian Plantation'' (1863) 251)
* 1842: "To tell a healthy vegetarian that his diet is very uncongenial with the wants of his nature." (''Healthian'', Apr. 34)  The 1839 occurrence remains under discussion; the Oxford English Dictionary's 1839 source is in fact an 1863 publication: [[Fanny Kemble]], ''Journal of a Residence on a Georgian Plantation 1838–1839''.

Vegetarianism was also practiced about six centuries later in another instance (30&amp;nbsp;BCE–50&amp;nbsp;CE) in the northern [[Thracian]] region by the [[Moesi]] tribe (who inhabited present-day [[Serbia]] and [[Bulgaria]]), feeding themselves on honey, milk, and cheese.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of religion|edition=13|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cjUOAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=the+moesi+vegetarian&amp;dq=the+moesi+vegetarian|isbn=9780028659824|last=Jones|first=Lindsay|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of vegetarian diets that exclude or include various foods:

* [[Buddhist vegetarianism]]. Different Buddhist traditions have differing teachings on diet, which may also vary for ordained monks and nuns compared to others. Many interpret the [[Five Precepts|precept]] "not to kill" to require abstinence from meat, but not all. In Taiwan, ''su'' vegetarianism excludes not only all animal products but also vegetables in the [[allium]] family (which have the characteristic aroma of onion and garlic): onion, garlic, scallions, leeks, chives, or shallots.
* [[Fruitarianism]] and [[Jain vegetarianism]] permit only fruit, nuts, seeds, and other plant matter that can be gathered without harming the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.andjrnl.org/article/S0002-8223(09)00700-7/fulltext|title=Position of the American Dietetic Association: Vegetarian Diets|journal=Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics|volume=109|issue=7|pages=1266–1282|doi=10.1016/j.jada.2009.05.027|date=July 2009|accessdate=January 6, 2016|pmid=19562864|vauthors=Craig WJ, Mangels AR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jain vegetarianism also includes dairy.
* [[Macrobiotic diet]]s consist mostly of [[whole grain]]s and [[bean]]s.
* [[Lacto vegetarianism]] includes dairy products but not eggs.
* [[Ovo vegetarianism]] includes eggs but not dairy products.
* [[Ovo-lacto vegetarianism]] (or lacto-ovo vegetarianism) includes animal products such as eggs, milk, and honey.
* [[Sattvic diet]] (also known as yogic diet), a [[plant-based diet]] which may also include dairy and honey, but excludes eggs, [[Lentil|red lentils]], [[durian]], mushrooms, [[allium]]s, [[blue cheese]]s, fermented foods or sauces, and alcoholic drinks. Coffee, [[Tea|black or green tea]], [[chocolate]], [[nutmeg]], and any other type of stimulant (including excessively [[pungent]] spices) are sometimes excluded, as well.
* [[Veganism]] excludes all animal flesh and by-products, such as milk, honey (not always),&lt;ref name="Slate"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.slate.com/articles/life/food/2008/07/the_great_vegan_honey_debate.html|title=The Great Vegan Honey Debate: Is honey the dairy of the insect world?|last=Engber|first=Daniel|date=July 30, 2008|website=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180309213633/https://www.slate.com/articles/life/food/2008/07/the_great_vegan_honey_debate.html|archive-date=March 9, 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=March 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eggs, as well as items refined or manufactured through any such product, such as animal-tested [[baking soda]] or white sugar refined with [[bone char]].
** [[Raw veganism]] includes only fresh and uncooked fruit, nuts, seeds, and vegetables. Food must not be heated above {{Convert|118|F}} to be considered "raw". Usually, raw vegan food is only ever "cooked" with a [[food dehydrator]] at low temperatures.
Within the "[[wikt:ovo-|ovo-]]" groups, there are many who refuse to consume fertilized [[Egg (biology)|eggs]] (with [[Balut (food)|balut]] being an extreme example); however, such distinction is typically not specifically addressed.

Some vegetarians also avoid products that may use animal ingredients not included in their labels or which use animal products in their manufacturing. For example, sugars that are whitened with [[bone char]], cheeses that use animal [[rennet]] ([[enzyme]]s from animal stomach lining), gelatin (derived from the [[collagen]] inside animals' skin, bones, and [[connective tissue]]), some [[Sugarcane|cane sugar]] (but not [[Sugar beet|beet sugar]]) and beverages (such as apple juice and alcohol) clarified with gelatin or crushed shellfish and [[sturgeon]], while other vegetarians are unaware of, or do not mind, such ingredients.&lt;ref name="navs-online.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Forrest"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vegsoc.org2"/&gt;&lt;ref name=vrg.org/&gt;

These diets may be followed by those who reduce animal flesh consumed as a way of transitioning to a complete vegetarian diet or for health, ethical, environmental, or other reasons. Semi-vegetarian diets include:
* Macrobiotic diet consisting mostly of whole grains and beans, but may sometimes include fish.
* [[Pescetarianism]], which includes fish and possibly other forms of seafood.
* [[wikt:pollo|Pollo]]-pescetarianism, which includes poultry and fish, or "white meat" only.
* Pollotarianism, which includes chicken and possibly other poultry.

Semi-vegetarianism is contested by vegetarian groups, such as the [[Vegetarian Society]], which states that vegetarianism excludes all animal flesh.&lt;ref name="Vegsoc.org, fish"/&gt;

|quote = On average, vegetarians consume a lower proportion of calories from fat (particularly saturated fatty acids), fewer overall calories, more fiber, potassium, and vitamin C, than do non-vegetarians. Vegetarians generally have a lower body mass index.

A vegetarian diet which is poorly planned can lead to [[hyperhomocysteinemia]] and [[platelet]] disorders; this risk may be offset by ensuring sufficient consumption of [[vitamin B 12]] and [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]]s.&lt;ref name=noncom/&gt;

The [[Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics]] and [[Dietitians of Canada]] have stated that at all stages of life, a properly planned vegetarian diet is "healthful, nutritionally adequate, and provides health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.eatright.org/about/content.aspx?id=8357| title=Position of the American Dietetic Association: Vegetarian diets| date=July 2009| accessdate=November 18, 2012| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113234055/http://www.eatright.org/About/Content.aspx?id=8357| archivedate=November 13, 2012| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large-scale studies have shown that mortality from [[ischemic heart disease]] was 30% lower among vegetarian men and 20% lower among vegetarian women than in non-vegetarians.&lt;ref name="Key"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Key TJ, Fraser GE, Thorogood M, Appleby PN, Beral V, Reeves G, Burr ML, Chang-Claude J, Frentzel-Beyme R, Kuzma JW, Mann J, McPherson K | title = Mortality in vegetarians and nonvegetarians: detailed findings from a collaborative analysis of 5 prospective studies | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 70 | issue = 3 Suppl | pages = 516S–524S | year = 1999 | pmid = 10479225 | doi = 10.1079/phn19980006| url = http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/full/70/3/516S#T7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4801570.stm |title= Rejecting meat 'keeps weight low' |work=BBC News|date=March 14, 2006 |accessdate=March 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vegetarian diets offer lower levels of [[saturated fat]], [[cholesterol]] and animal protein, and higher levels of carbohydrates, [[Fiber|fibre]], [[magnesium]], [[potassium]], [[folate]], and [[antioxidant]]s such as [[vitamin]]s C and E and [[phytochemical]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2003 | title = Position of the American Dietetic Association and Dietitians of Canada: Vegetarian diets | url = http://www.vrg.org/nutrition/2003_ADA_position_paper.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of the American Dietetic Association | volume = 103 | issue = 6| pages = 748–65 | doi = 10.1053/jada.2003.50142 | pmid = 12778049 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19321569"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fraser GE | title = Vegetarian diets: what do we know of their effects on common chronic diseases? | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 89 | issue = 5 | pages = 1607S–1612S | year = 2009 | pmid = 19321569 | pmc = 2677008 | doi = 10.3945/ajcn.2009.26736K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Vegetarian diets can meet guidelines for the treatment of diabetes and some research suggests  that diets that are more plant-based reduce risk of type-2 diabetes. Rates of self-reported Seventh-day Adventists (SDA) were less than half of those of the general population, and, among SDA, vegetarians had lower rates of diabetes than non-vegetarians. Among possible explanations for a protective effect of vegetarian diet are the Lower BMI of vegetarians and higher fiber intake, both of which improve insulin sensitivity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/218406489?accountid=14541|title = Position of the American Dietetic Association and Dietitians of Canada: Vegetarian diets|date = 2003|journal = Journal of the American Dietetic Association |volume=103 |issue=6 |pages=748–65|accessdate = October 27, 2014|doi = 10.1053/jada.2003.50142|pmid = 12778049}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A vegetarian diet may help reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease, as the most important dietary link to Alzheimer's disease appears to be meat consumption, with eggs and high-fat dairy also contributing.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grant|first1=WB|title=Using Multicountry Ecological and Observational Studies to Determine Dietary Risk Factors for Alzheimer's Disease|journal=Journal of the American College of Nutrition|date=July 2016|volume=35|issue=5|pages=476–89|pmid=27454859|doi=10.1080/07315724.2016.1161566}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nutrition===
{{Main|Vegetarian nutrition|vegan nutrition}}
Western vegetarian diets are typically high in [[carotenoid]]s, but relatively low in [[omega-3 fatty acid]]s and [[vitamin B12|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref name=Key2006&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Key TJ, Appleby PN, Rosell MS | title = Health effects of vegetarian and vegan diets | journal = Proceedings of the Nutrition Society | volume = 65 | issue = 1 | pages = 35–41 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16441942 | doi = 10.1079/PNS2005481 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vegans can have particularly low intake of [[vitamin B]] and [[calcium]] if they do not eat enough items such as [[collard greens]], [[Leaf vegetable|leafy greens]], [[tempeh]] and [[tofu]] (soy).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Craig|first=W.

====Protein====
Protein intake in vegetarian diets is lower than in meat diets but can meet the daily requirements for most people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Peter Emery| first = Tom Sanders| title = Molecular Basis of Human Nutrition| publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd|year=2002| page = 32| isbn = 978-0-7484-0753-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies at [[Harvard University]] as well as other studies conducted in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, [[New Zealand]] and various European countries,
confirmed vegetarian diets provide sufficient protein intake as long as a variety of plant sources are available and consumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Brenda Davis| first = Vesanto Melina| title = The New Becoming Vegetarian| publisher = Book Publishing Company|year=2003| pages = 57–58| isbn = 978-1-57067-144-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pumpkin seeds, peanut butter, hemp seed, almonds, pistachio nuts, flaxseed, tofu, oats, soybeans, walnuts, are great sources of protein for vegetarians.   Proteins are composed of [[amino acid]]s, and a common concern with protein acquired from vegetable sources is an adequate intake of the [[essential amino acid]]s, which cannot be synthesised by the human body. While dairy and egg products provide complete sources for [[Ovo-lacto vegetarianism|ovo-lacto vegetarian]], several vegetable sources have significant amounts of all eight types of essential amino acids, including [[lupin bean]]s, [[Soybean|soy]],&lt;ref name="SND-soybeans"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/legumes-and-legume-products/4375/2 | title = Soybeans, mature seeds, raw | publisher = NutritionData.com | accessdate =August 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[hemp]]seed, [[Salvia hispanica|chia seed]],&lt;ref name="SND-chia"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/nut-and-seed-products/3061/2 | title = Seeds, chia seeds, dried | publisher = NutritionData.com | accessdate =August 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[amaranth grain|amaranth]],&lt;ref name="SND-amaranth"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/cereal-grains-and-pasta/5676/2 | title = Amaranth, uncooked | publisher = NutritionData.com | accessdate =August 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[buckwheat]],&lt;ref name="SND-buckwheat"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/cereal-grains-and-pasta/5681/2 | title = Buckwheat | publisher = NutritionData.com | accessdate =August 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[pumpkin seeds]]&lt;ref name="SND-pumpkin"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/nut-and-seed-products/3066/2 | title = Pumpkin Seeds | publisher = NutritionData.com | accessdate =October 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[spirulina (dietary supplement)|spirulina]],&lt;ref name="SND-spirulina"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/vegetables-and-vegetable-products/2765/2 | title = Spirulina | publisher = NutritionData.com | accessdate =October 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[pistachios]],&lt;ref name="SND-pistachio"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/nut-and-seed-products/3135/2| title = Pistachio | publisher = NutritionData.com | accessdate =October 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[quinoa]].&lt;ref name="SND-quinoa"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/cereal-grains-and-pasta/10352/2 | title = Quinoa, cooked | publisher = NutritionData.com | accessdate =August 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the essential amino acids can also be obtained by eating a variety of complementary plant sources that, in combination, provide all eight essential amino acids (e.g. [[brown rice]] and [[bean]]s, or [[hummus]] and [[pita]], though [[protein combining]] in the same meal is not necessary{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}).

====Iron====
Vegetarian diets typically contain similar levels of iron to non-vegetarian diets, but this has lower bioavailability than iron from meat sources, and its absorption can sometimes be inhibited by other dietary constituents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vegsoc.org/page.aspx?pid=782 |title=Vegetarian Society - Factsheet - Iron |publisher=Vegsoc.org |date=September 22, 2014 |accessdate=March 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Vegetarian Resource Group, consuming food that contains vitamin C, such as citrus fruit or juices, tomatoes, or broccoli, is a good way to increase the amount of iron absorbed at a meal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vrg.org/nutshell/nutshell.htm#iron |title=Vegetarianism in a Nutshell |publisher=Vrg.org |date= |accessdate=March 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vegetarian foods rich in iron include [[black turtle bean|black beans]], [[cashew]]s, [[hempseed]], [[kidney bean]]s, [[broccoli]], [[lentil]]s, [[oatmeal]], [[raisin]]s,  [[spinach]], [[cabbage]], lettuce, [[black-eyed pea]]s, [[soybean]]s, many [[breakfast cereal]]s, [[sunflower seed]]s, [[chickpea]]s, [[tomato juice]], [[tempeh]], [[molasses]], [[thyme]], and [[whole-wheat bread]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goveg.com/essential_nutrients.asp#iron |title=// Health Issues // Optimal Vegan Nutrition |publisher=Goveg.com |accessdate=August 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The related vegan diets can often be higher in iron than vegetarian diets, because dairy products are low in iron.&lt;ref name=Davey/&gt; Iron stores often tend to be lower in vegetarians than non-vegetarians, and a few small studies report very high rates of iron deficiency (up to 40%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Waldmann A, Koschizke JW, Leitzmann C, Hahn A | title = Dietary Iron Intake and Iron Status of German Female Vegans: Results of the German Vegan Study | journal = Ann Nutr Metab | volume = 48 | issue = 2 | pages = 103–108 | year = 2004 | pmid = 14988640 | doi = 10.1159/000077045 | url = http://www.repo.uni-hannover.de/handle/123456789/2754 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 58%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Krajcovicová-Kudlácková M, Simoncic R, Béderová A, Grancicová E, Magálová T | title = Influence of vegetarian and mixed nutrition on selected haematological and biochemical parameters in children | journal = Nahrung | volume = 41 | issue = 5 | pages = 311–14 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9399258 | doi = 10.1002/food.19970410513 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the respective vegetarian or vegan groups).

====Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;====

The recommended dietary allowance of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; in the United States is, per day, 0.4 mcg (0–6 months), rising to 1.8 mcg (9–13 years), 2.4 mcg (14+ years), and 2.8 mcg (lactating female).&lt;ref name="ODS_B12"/&gt; While the body's daily requirement for vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; is very small, deficiency of the vitamin is very serious leading to anemia and irreversible nerve damage.&lt;ref name="moz"&gt;{{Cite news| last= Mozafar| first= A.|year= 1997| title= Is there vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; in plants or not?

====Fatty acids====
Plant-based, or vegetarian, sources of [[Omega 3]] fatty acids include [[soy]], [[walnut]]s, pumpkin seeds, [[canola oil]], [[kiwifruit]], [[hempseed]], [[algae]], [[chia seed]], [[flaxseed]], echium seed and [[Leaf vegetable|leafy vegetables]] such as lettuce, [[spinach]], [[cabbage]] and [[portulaca oleracea|purslane]]. Purslane contains more Omega 3 than any other known leafy green. [[Olive]]s (and [[olive oil]]) are another important plant source of unsaturated fatty acids. Plant foods can provide [[alpha-linolenic acid]] which the human body uses to synthesize the long-chain n-3 fatty acids [[Eicosapentaenoic acid|EPA]] and [[Docosahexaenoic acid|DHA]]. EPA and DHA can be obtained directly in high amounts from oily fish or fish oils. Vegetarians, and particularly vegans, have lower levels of EPA and DHA than meat-eaters. While the health effects of low levels of EPA and DHA are unknown, it is unlikely that supplementation with alpha-linolenic acid will significantly increase levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rosell MS, Lloyd-Wright Z, Appleby PN, Sanders TA, Allen NE, Key TJ | title = Long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in plasma in British meat-eating, vegetarian, and vegan men | journal = Am J Clin Nutr | volume = 82 | issue = 2 | pages = 327–34 | year = 2003 | pmid = 16087975 | doi = 10.1093/ajcn.82.2.327 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=May 2011}} Recently, some companies have begun to market vegetarian DHA supplements containing seaweed extracts. Whole seaweeds are not suitable for supplementation because their high iodine content limits the amount that may be safely consumed. However, certain [[algae]] such as [[spirulina (dietary supplement)|spirulina]] are good sources of [[gamma-linolenic acid]] (GLA), [[alpha-linolenic acid]] (ALA), [[linoleic acid]] (LA), [[stearidonic acid]] (SDA), [[eicosapentaenoic acid]] (EPA), [[docosahexaenoic acid]] (DHA), and [[arachidonic acid]] (AA).&lt;ref name="uzbek"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Babadzhanov A |author2=Abdusamatova N |author3=Yusupova F |author4=Faizullaeva N |author5=Mezhlumyan LG |author6=Malikova MKh | title = Chemical Composition of Spirulina platensis Cultivated in Uzbekistan | journal = Chemistry of Natural Compounds | volume = 40 | issue = 3 | pages = 276–279 | year = 2004 | doi = 10.1023/B:CONC.0000039141.98247.e8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="biomass"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tokuşoglu Ö, Uunal MK | title = Biomass Nutrient Profiles of Three Microalgae: Spirulina platensis, Chlorella vulgaris, and Isochrisis galena | journal=Journal of Food Science | volume = 68 | issue = 4 | pages = 1144–1148 | year = 2003 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2621.2003.tb09615.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Calcium====
[[Calcium]] intake in vegetarians and vegans can be similar to non-vegetarians, as long as the diet is properly planned.&lt;ref name="Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics"&gt;{{cite web|title=Meeting Calcium Recommendations  on a Vegan Diet|url=http://vegetariannutrition.net/docs/Calcium-Vegetarian-Nutrition.pdf|publisher=Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics|accessdate=April 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lacto-ovo vegetarians that include dairy products can still obtain calcium from dairy sources like milk, yogurt, and cheese.&lt;ref name="Calcium Fact Sheet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Calcium Fact Sheet|url=http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Calcium-HealthProfessional|accessdate=April 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-dairy milks that are fortified with calcium, such as soymilk and almond milk can also contribute a significant amount of calcium in the diet.&lt;ref name="Mangels"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mangels|first=Reed|title=Calcium in the Vegan Diet|url=http://www.vrg.org/nutrition/calcium.php|accessdate=April 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The calcium found in [[broccoli]], [[Chinese cabbage|bok choy]], and [[kale]] have also been found to have calcium that is well absorbed in the body.&lt;ref name="Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Calcium Fact Sheet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Overview of Calcium"&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[National Institutes of Health|NIH]]|title=Overview of Calcium|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK56060/?report=reader|accessdate=April 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though the calcium content per serving is lower in these vegetables than a glass of milk, the absorption of the calcium into the body is higher.&lt;ref name="Calcium Fact Sheet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Overview of Calcium"/&gt;  Other  foods that contain calcium include calcium-set tofu, blackstrap molasses, [[Turnip|turnip greens]], mustard greens, soybeans, tempeh, almonds, okra, dried figs, and [[tahini]].&lt;ref name="Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mangels"/&gt; Though calcium can be found in [[Spinach]], [[swiss chard]], [[bean]]s and [[Beet|beet greens]], they are generally not considered to be a good source since the calcium binds to oxalic acid and is poorly absorbed into the body.&lt;ref name="Calcium Fact Sheet"/&gt;  Phytic acid found in nuts, seeds, and beans may also impact calcium absorption rates.&lt;ref name="Calcium Fact Sheet"/&gt;  See the National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements for calcium needs for various ages,&lt;ref name="Calcium Fact Sheet"/&gt; the Vegetarian Resource Group&lt;ref name="Mangels"/&gt; and the Vegetarian Nutrition Calcium Fact Sheet from the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics&lt;ref name="Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics"/&gt;  for more specifics on how to obtain adequate calcium intake on a vegetarian or vegan diet.

===Longevity===
There have been many [[comparative studies|comparative]] and [[statistics|statistical studies]] of the relationship between diet and longevity, including vegetarianism and [[longevity]].

A 1999 [[Meta-analysis|metastudy]] combined data from five studies from western countries.&lt;ref name="AJCN metastudy"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Key TJ, Fraser GE, Thorogood M, Appleby PN, Beral V, Reeves G, Burr ML, Chang-Claude J, Frentzel-Beyme R, Kuzma JW, Mann J, McPherson K | title = Mortality in vegetarians and non-vegetarians: detailed findings from a collaborative analysis of 5 prospective studies | journal = American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 70 | issue = 3 | pages = 516S–524S | date = September 1999 | pmid = 10479225 | url = http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/full/70/3/516S | accessdate = October 30, 2009 | doi=10.1079/phn19980006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The metastudy reported [[mortality ratio]]s, where lower numbers indicated fewer deaths, for fish eaters to be 0.82, vegetarians to be 0.84, occasional meat eaters (eat meat less than once per week) to be 0.84. Regular meat eaters had the base mortality rate of 1.0, while the number for [[veganism|vegans]] was very uncertain (anywhere between 0.7 and 1.44) due to too few data points. The study reported the numbers of deaths in each category, and expected error ranges for each ratio, and adjustments made to the data. However, the "lower mortality was due largely to the relatively low prevalence of smoking in these [vegetarian] cohorts". Out of the major causes of death studied, only one difference in mortality rate was attributed to the difference in diet, as the conclusion states: "...vegetarians had a 24% lower mortality from [[ischaemic heart disease]] than non-vegetarians, but no associations of a vegetarian diet with other major causes of death were established".&lt;ref name="AJCN metastudy"/&gt;

In ''Mortality in British vegetarians'',&lt;ref name="AJCN British study"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Key TJ, Appleby PN, Davey GK, Allen NE, Spencer EA, Travis RC | title = Mortality in British vegetarians: review and preliminary results from EPIC-Oxford | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 78 | issue = 3 Suppl | pages = 533S–538S | year = 2003 | pmid = 12936946 | doi = 10.1093/ajcn/78.3.533S }}&lt;/ref&gt; a similar conclusion is drawn:

&lt;blockquote&gt;British vegetarians have low mortality compared with the general population. Their death rates are similar to those of comparable non-vegetarians, suggesting that much of this benefit may be attributed to non-dietary lifestyle factors such as a low prevalence of smoking and a generally high socio-economic status, or to aspects of the diet other than the avoidance of meat and fish."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Appleby PN, Key TJ, Thorogood M, Burr ML, Mann J | title = Mortality in British vegetarians | journal = Public Health Nutrition | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 29–36 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12001975 | doi = 10.1079/PHN2001248 | url = http://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/16989/1/mortal.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Adventist Health Studies]] is ongoing research that documents the [[life expectancy]] in [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]]. This is the only study among others with similar methodology which had favourable indication for vegetarianism. The researchers found that a combination of different lifestyle choices could influence life expectancy by as much as 10 years. Among the lifestyle choices investigated, a vegetarian diet was estimated to confer an extra 1–1/2 to 2 years of life. The researchers concluded that "the life expectancies of California Adventist men and women are higher than those of any other well-described natural population" at 78.5 years for men and 82.3 years for women. The life expectancy of California Adventists surviving to age 30 was 83.3 years for men and 85.7 years for women.&lt;ref&gt;Loma Linda University Adventist Health Sciences Center, ''[http://www.llu.edu/pages/news/today/july2601/llu.html New Adventist Health Study research noted in Archives of Internal Medicine]'', Loma Linda University, July 26, 2001. Retrieved January 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Adventist health study is again incorporated into a metastudy titled "Does low meat consumption increase life expectancy in humans?" published in ''American Journal of Clinical Nutrition'', which concluded that low meat eating (less than once per week) and other lifestyle choices significantly increase life expectancy, relative to a group with high meat intake. The study concluded that "The findings from one cohort of healthy adults raises the possibility that long-term (≥ 2 decades) adherence to a vegetarian diet can further produce a significant 3.6-y increase in life expectancy." However, the study also concluded that "Some of the variation in the survival advantage in vegetarians may have been due to marked differences between studies in adjustment for confounders, the definition of vegetarian, measurement error, age distribution, the healthy volunteer effect, and intake of specific plant foods by the vegetarians." It further states that "This raises the possibility that a low-meat, high plant-food dietary pattern may be the true causal protective factor rather than simply elimination of meat from the diet." In a recent review of studies relating low-meat diet patterns to all-cause mortality, Singh noted that "5 out of 5 studies indicated that adults who followed a low meat, high plant-food diet pattern experienced significant or marginally significant decreases in mortality risk relative to other patterns of intake."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Singh PN, Sabaté J, Fraser GE | title = Does low meat consumption increase life expectancy in humans | journal = Am J Clin Nutr | volume = 78 | issue = 3 | pages = 526S–532S | year = 2003 | pmid = 12936945 | url = http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/78/3/526S.long | accessdate = September 28, 2012 | doi = 10.1093/ajcn/78.3.526S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics and diet==

===General===
{{Main|Ethics of eating meat}}
Various ethical reasons have been suggested for choosing vegetarianism, usually predicated on the interests of non-human animals. In many societies, controversy and debate have arisen over the ethics of eating animals. Some people, while not vegetarians, refuse to eat the flesh of certain animals due to cultural [[taboo]], such as cats, dogs, horses or rabbits. Others support meat eating for scientific, nutritional and cultural reasons, including religious ones. Some meat eaters abstain from the meat of animals reared in particular ways, such as [[factory farms]], or avoid certain meats, such as [[veal]] or [[foie gras]]. Some people follow vegetarian or [[Veganism|vegan]] diets not because of moral concerns involving the raising or consumption of animals in general, but because of concerns about the specific treatment and practises involved in the raising and slaughter of animals, i.e. [[factory farming]] and the industrialisation of [[animal slaughter]]. Others still avoid meat because meat production is claimed to place a greater burden on the environment than production of an equivalent amount of plant [[protein]].

Ethical objections based on consideration for animals are generally divided into opposition to the act of killing in general, and opposition to certain [[Intensive farming|agricultural practices]] surrounding the [[animal husbandry|production]] of meat.

=== Ethics of killing for food ===
{{POV section|2018|date=April 2018}}
{{Main|Bioethics}}
[[Princeton University]] professor and [[Animal rights movement|animal rights]] activist [[Peter Singer]] believes that if alternative means of survival exist, one ought to choose the option that does not cause unnecessary harm to animals. Most ethical vegetarians argue that the same reasons exist against killing animals in the flesh to eat as against killing humans to eat, especially humans with cognitive abilities equal or lesser than the animals in question. Singer, in his book ''[[Animal Liberation (book)|Animal Liberation]],'' listed possible qualities of sentience in non-human creatures that gave such creatures the scope to be considered under [[utilitarianism|utilitarian ethics]], and this has been widely referenced by animal rights campaigners and vegetarians. Ethical vegetarians also believe that killing an animal, like killing a human, especially one who has equal or lesser cognitive abilities than the animals in question, can only be justified in extreme circumstances and that consuming a living creature for its enjoyable taste, convenience, or [[nutrition]] value is not a sufficient cause. Another common view is that humans are morally conscious of their behavior in a way other animals are not, and therefore subject to higher standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Why the Naive Argument against Moral Vegetarianism Really is Naive|journal=Environmental Values|year=2001|pages=103–112|volume=10|issue=1|doi=10.3197/096327101129340769|author=David Benatar}}&lt;/ref&gt; One author proposes that denying the right to life and humane treatment to animals with equal or greater cognitive abilities than mentally disabled humans is an arbitrary and discriminatory practice based on habit instead of logic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McMahan|first1=Jeff|title=The Ethics of Killing|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of ethical vegetarianism argue that animals are not [[Moral equivalence|moral equals]] to humans and so consider the comparison of eating livestock with killing people to be fallacious. This view does not excuse cruelty, but maintains that animals do not possess the rights a human has.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/anim-eth/#SH2b |title=Animals and Ethics [Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy&amp;#93; |publisher=Iep.utm.edu |date=January 13, 2010 |accessdate=September 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dairy and eggs ===
One of the main differences between a [[vegan]] and a [[Ovo-lacto vegetarianism|typical vegetarian diet]] is the avoidance of both eggs and [[dairy product]]s such as milk, cheese, butter and yogurt. [[Veganism#Ethical veganism|Ethical vegans]] do not consume dairy or eggs because they state that their production causes the animal suffering or a premature death.&lt;ref name=marcus&gt;{{cite book|title=Vegan: The New Ethics of Eating|author=Erik Marcus|year=2000|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3hHjqs43t8oC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=9781590133446}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Treatment of animals ===
{{main|Animal rights}}
[[Ethical vegetarianism]] has become popular in developed countries particularly because of the spread of [[factory farming]], faster communications, and environmental consciousness. Some believe that the current mass demand for meat cannot be satisfied without a mass-production system that disregards the welfare of animals, while others believe that practices like well-managed free-ranging and consumption of game, particularly from species whose natural predators have been significantly eliminated, could substantially alleviate the demand for mass-produced meat.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

===Classical Greek and Roman philosophy===
[[File:Pythagoras advocating vegetarianism (1618-20); Peter Paul Rubens.jpg|thumb|Pythagoras advocating vegetarianism, painting by [[Rubens]]]]

Ancient Greek philosophy has a long tradition of vegetarianism. [[Pythagoras]] was reportedly vegetarian (and studied at Mt. Carmel, where some historians say there was a vegetarian community), as his followers were expected to be.

Roman writer [[Ovid]] concluded his magnum opus [[Metamorphoses]], in part, with the impassioned argument (uttered by the character of Pythagoras) that in order for humanity to change, or [[metamorphosis|metamorphose]], into a better, more harmonious species, it must strive towards more humane tendencies. He cited vegetarianism as the crucial decision in this metamorphosis, explaining his belief that human life and animal life are so entwined that to kill an animal is virtually the same as killing a fellow human.

{{quote|Everything changes; nothing dies; the soul roams to and fro, now here, now there, and takes what frame it will, passing from beast to man, from our own form to beast and never dies...Therefore lest appetite and greed destroy the bonds of love and duty, heed my message! Abstain! Never by slaughter dispossess souls that are kin and nourish blood with blood!&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]],'' [[Metamorphoses]]'', Book XV, translated by A.D. Melville, Oxford University Press, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Bahá'í Faith===
While there are no dietary restrictions in the [[Bahá'í Faith]], [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], the son of the religion's founder, noted that a vegetarian diet consisting of fruits and grains was desirable, except for people with a weak constitution or those that are sick.&lt;ref name="PSmith"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= Diet |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 978-1-85168-184-6 |pages= 121–122}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that there are no requirements that Bahá'ís become vegetarian, but that a future society should gradually become vegetarian.&lt;ref name="PSmith"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Esslemont, J.E. |authorlink = John Esslemont |year = 1980 |title = Bahá'u'lláh and the New Era |edition = 5th |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn = 978-0-87743-160-2 |url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/o/BNE/bne-83.html.iso8859-1?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = `Abdu'l-Bahá |editor = MacNutt |author-link = `Abdu'l-Bahá |year = 1912 |publication-date = 1982 |title = The Promulgation of Universal Peace |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, Illinois, US |isbn = 978-0-87743-172-5 |url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/PUP/pup-60.html.iso8859-1?}}&lt;/ref&gt; `Abdu'l-Bahá also stated that killing animals was contrary to compassion.{{r|PSmith}} While [[Shoghi Effendi]], the head of the Bahá'í Faith in the first half of the 20th century, stated that a purely vegetarian diet would be preferable since it avoided killing animals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Writings Concerning Health, Healing, and Nutrition|url = http://bahai-library.com/compilation_health_healing_nutrition#III|accessdate =May 25, 2009|author = Research Department, Universal House of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt; both he and the [[Universal House of Justice]], the governing body of the Bahá'ís have stated that these teachings do not constitute a Bahá'í practice and that Bahá'ís can choose to eat whatever they wish but should be respectful of others' beliefs.{{r|PSmith}}

===Buddhism===
{{Main|Buddhist vegetarianism}}

Theravadins in general eat meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/dharmadata/fdd21.htm |title=Buddhist Studies: Vegetarianism |publisher=Buddhanet.net |date= |accessdate=March 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; If Buddhist monks "see, hear or know" a living animal was killed specifically for them to eat, they must refuse it or else incur an offense.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buddhanet.net/budsas/ebud/ebdha069.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007043230/http://www.buddhanet.net/budsas/ebud/ebdha069.htm|date=October 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this does not include eating meat which was given as alms or commercially purchased. In the Theravada canon, Buddha did not make any comment discouraging them from eating meat (except specific types, such as human, [[elephant meat]], horse, dog, snake, lion, tiger, leopard, bear, and hyena flesh&lt;ref&gt;Mahavagga Pali – Bhesajjakkhandhaka – Vinaya Pitaka&lt;/ref&gt;) but he specifically refused to institute vegetarianism in his monastic code when a suggestion had been made.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buddhanet.net/budsas/ebud/ebdha069.htm#note4 "Buddhism and Vegetarianism, The Rationale for the Buddha's Views on the Consumption of Meat"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007043230/http://www.buddhanet.net/budsas/ebud/ebdha069.htm |date=October 7, 2013 }} by Dr V.

===Christianity===
{{Main|Christian vegetarianism}}

Christians have always been free to make their own decisions about what to eat; however, there are groups within Christianity that practice specific dietary restrictions for various reasons.&lt;ref name=Vatican&gt;{{cite web|title=Code of Canon Law|publisher=vatican.va|accessdate=July 28, 2013|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_P4O.HTM#37}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early sect known as the [[Ebionites]] are considered to have practiced vegetarianism. Surviving fragments from their [[Gospel of the Ebionites#Vegetarianism|Gospel]] indicate their belief that – as Christ is the Passover sacrifice and eating the Passover lamb is no longer required – a vegetarian diet may (or should) be observed. However, orthodox Christianity does not accept their teaching as authentic. Indeed, their specific injunction to strict vegetarianism was cited as one of the Ebionites' "errors".&lt;ref&gt;Epiphanius, ''Panarion'', 30.22.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Isidore of Seville, ''Etymologies'', VIII.v.36&lt;/ref&gt;

At a much later time, the [[Bible Christian Church (vegetarian)|Bible Christian Church]] founded by Reverend [[William Cowherd]] in 1809 followed a vegetarian diet.&lt;ref name=desc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ivu.org/history/thesis/bible-christian.html|title=The Bible Christian Church|publisher=International Vegetarian Union}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cowherd was one of the philosophical forerunners of the [[Vegetarian Society]].&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vegsoc.org/page.aspx?pid=827|title=History of Vegetarianism – Early Ideas|publisher=The Vegetarian Society|accessdate=July 8, 2008}}; Gregory, James (2007) ''Of Victorians and Vegetarians''. London: I. B. Tauris pp.&amp;nbsp;30–35.&lt;/ref&gt; Cowherd encouraged members to abstain from eating of meat as a form of [[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]].&lt;ref name=oxford&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/index/101006496/|title=William Cowherd (brief information)|publisher=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|accessdate=July 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]] are encouraged to engage in healthy eating practices, and ova-lacto-vegetarian diets are recommended by the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists Nutrition Council (GCNC). They have also sponsored and participated in many scientific studies exploring the impact of dietary decisions upon health outcomes.&lt;ref name=sdada1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sdada.org/position.htm |title=Position Statement on Vegetarian Diet |publisher=Sdada.org |accessdate=September 12, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529062331/http://sdada.org/position.htm |archivedate=May 29, 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The GCNC has in addition adapted the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]]'s [[Food guide pyramid#USDA food pyramid|food pyramid]] for a vegetarian dietary approach.&lt;ref name=sdada1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sdada.org/Pyramid-Vegetarian-01.jpg] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513033958/http://www.sdada.org/Pyramid-Vegetarian-01.jpg|date=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the only kinds of meat specifically frowned upon by the SDA health message are [[unclean animals|unclean meats]], or those forbidden in scripture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sdada.org/sdahealth.htm |title=The Seventh-day Adventist Health Message |publisher=Sdada.org |accessdate=November 28, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513031730/http://www.sdada.org/sdahealth.htm |archivedate=May 13, 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, some [[monastic orders]] follow a vegetarian diet, and members of the [[Orthodox Church]] follow a vegan diet during fasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/praxis/pr_fasting.aspx |title=Living an Orthodox Life: Fasting |publisher=Orthodoxinfo.com |date=May 27, 1997 |accessdate=February 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a strong association between the [[Quakers]] and vegetarianism dating back at least to the 18th century. The association grew in prominence during the 19th century, coupled with growing Quaker concerns in connection with alcohol consumption, anti-vivisection and social purity. The association between the Quaker tradition and vegetarianism, however, becomes most significant with the founding of the Friends' Vegetarian Society in 1902 "to spread a kindlier way of living amongst the Society of Friends."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ivu.org/history/thesis/quakers.html |title=The Great War and the Interwar Period |publisher=ivu.org |accessdate=August 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Canon law#Catholic Church|Canon Law]], [[Roman Catholics]] are required to abstain from meat (defined as all animal flesh excluding water animals) on [[Ash Wednesday]] and all Fridays of [[Lent]] including [[Good Friday]]. Canon Law also obliges Catholics to abstain from meat on the Fridays of the year outside of Lent (excluding certain holy days) unless, with the permission of the local conference of bishops, another penitential act is substituted. The restrictions on eating meat on these days is solely as an act of penance and not because of a religious objection to eating meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ewtn.com/expert/answers/fast_and_abstinence.htm|title=Fast and Abstinence|publisher=EWTN|accessdate=November 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the formation of the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] in the 1860s when the church began, wholeness and health have been an emphasis of the Adventist church, and has been known as the "health message" belief of the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adventists are well known for presenting a health message that recommends [[Christian vegetarianism|vegetarianism]] and expects adherence to the [[Kashrut|kosher]] laws in Leviticus 11. Obedience to these laws means abstinence from pork, shellfish, and other animals proscribed as "[[unclean animals|unclean]]". The church discourages its members from consuming [[alcoholic beverage]]s, [[tobacco]] or illegal drugs (compare [[Christianity and alcohol]]). In addition, some Adventists avoid [[coffee]], [[tea]], [[cola]], and other beverages containing [[caffeine]].

The pioneers of the Adventist Church had much to do with the common acceptance of [[breakfast cereal]]s into the Western diet, and the "modern commercial concept of cereal food" originated among Adventists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/78499/breakfast-cereal Britannica.com]&lt;!-- need to replace this with a secondary (not tertiary) source, and remove the quotation--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Harvey Kellogg]] was one of the early founders of Adventist health work. His development of breakfast cereals as a health food led to the founding of [[Kellogg Company|Kellogg's]] by his brother [[William K. Kellogg|William]]. In both [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], the church-owned [[Sanitarium Health and Wellbeing Company]] is a leading manufacturer of health and vegetarian-related products, most prominently [[Weet-Bix]].

Research funded by the U.S. [[National Institutes of Health]] has shown that the average Adventist in [[California]] lives 4 to 10 years longer than the average Californian. [[Adventist Health Studies|The research]], as cited by the cover story of the November 2005 issue of ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'', asserts that Adventists live longer because they do not smoke or drink alcohol, have a day of rest every week, and maintain a healthy, low-fat [[vegetarian]] diet that is rich in nuts and beans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Since [[Dan Buettner]]'s 2005 ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' story about Adventist longevity, his book, ''The Blue Zones: Lessons for Living Longer From the People Who've Lived the Longest'', named [[Loma Linda, California]] a "[[Blue Zone|blue zone]]" because of the large concentration of Seventh-day Adventists.

Though there is no strict rule on what to consume and what not to, paths of [[Hinduism]] hold vegetarianism as an ideal. Some reasons are: the principle of nonviolence ([[ahimsa]]) applied to animals;&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen, Unto: ''Ahimsa. Non-Violence in Indian Tradition'', London 1976, p. 107–109.&lt;/ref&gt; the intention to offer only "pure" (vegetarian) food to a deity and then to receive it back as [[prasad]]; and the conviction that a [[sattvic diet]] is beneficial for a healthy body and mind and that non-vegetarian food is not recommended for a better mind and for spiritual development.

However, the food habits of Hindus vary according to their community, location, custom and  varying traditions. Historically and currently, those [[Hindus]] who eat meat prescribe [[Jhatka]] meat,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/seta/2004/10/21/stories/2004102100111600.htm |title=The Hindu : Sci Tech / Speaking Of Science : Changes in the Indian menu over the ages |publisher=Hinduonnet.com |date=October 21, 2004 |accessdate=February 3, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100826122930/http://www.hinduonnet.com/seta/2004/10/21/stories/2004102100111600.htm |archive-date=August 26, 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; while some Hindus believe that the cow is a holy animal whose [[Cattle slaughter in India|slaughter]] for meat is forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The states where cow slaughter is legal in India|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-no-beef-nation/|work=The Indian Express|date=October 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
{{See also|animals in Islam|Islamic dietary laws}}
Some followers of Islam, or Muslims, chose to be vegetarian for health, ethical, or personal reasons.  However, the choice to become vegetarian for non-medical reasons can sometimes be controversial due to conflicting [[fatwas]] and differing interpretations of the [[Quran]]. Though some more traditional Muslims may keep quiet about their vegetarian diet, the number of vegetarian Muslims is increasing.&lt;ref name="huffpostca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/anila-muhammad/vegetarian-msulim_b_3124110.html|title=Vegetarian Muslim: Turning Away From a Meat-Based Diet|publisher=[[Huffington Post]]|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Muslims can’t be vegetarian"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipaki.com/content/html/28/1203.html |title=Muslims can't be Vegetarian? : Islam : Dietery Law |publisher=Ipaki.com |date= |accessdate=March 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vegetarianism has been practiced by some influential Muslims including the Iraqi theologian, female mystic and poet [[Rabia of Basra]], who died in the year 801, and the Sri Lankan Sufi master [[Bawa Muhaiyaddeen]], who established The Bawa Muhaiyaddeen Fellowship of North America in Philadelphia. The former [[President of India|Indian president]] Dr. [[A. P. J. Abdul Kalam]] was also famously a vegetarian.&lt;ref name="kalam"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lokpriya.com/personalities/scientists/kalam.html |title=lokpriya! |publisher=Lokpriya.com |date= |accessdate=March 31, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321042322/http://www.lokpriya.com/personalities/scientists/kalam.html |archive-date=March 21, 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1996, The International Vegetarian Union announced the formation of the Muslim Vegetarian/Vegan Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ivu.org/news/1-96/muslim.html |title=IVU News – Islam and Vegetarianism |publisher=Ivu.org |accessdate=August 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many non-vegetarian Muslims will select vegetarian (or seafood) options when dining in non-[[halal]] restaurants. However, this is a matter of not having the right kind of meat rather than preferring not to eat meat on the whole.&lt;ref name="Muslims can’t be vegetarian"/&gt;

===Jainism===
{{Main|Jain vegetarianism}}
[[File:Jain Vegetarianism Illustration.jpg|thumb|The food choices of Jains are based on the value of [[Ahimsa|Ahimsa (non-violence)]].]]
Followers of [[Jainism]] believe that all living organisms whether they are micro-organism are living and have a soul, and have one or more senses out of five senses and they go to great lengths to minimise any harm to any living organism. Most Jains are lacto-vegetarians but more devout Jains do not eat root vegetables because they believe that root vegetables contain a lot more micro-organisms as compared to other vegetables, and that, by eating them, violence of these micro-organisms is inevitable. So they focus on eating beans and fruits, whose cultivation do not involve killing of a lot of micro-organisms. No products obtained from dead animals are allowed, because when a living beings dies, a lot of micro-organisms (called as decomposers) will reproduce in the body which decomposes the body, and in eating the dead bodies, violence of decomposers is inevitable. Jain monks usually do a lot of fasting, and when they knew through spiritual powers that their life is very little, they start fasting until death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jainstudy.org/JSC6.02-Vegetarianism.htm "Vegetarianism Good For The Self And Good For The Environment"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101203447/http://www.jainstudy.org/JSC6.02-Vegetarianism.htm |date=January 1, 2016 }} at The Jain Study Circle&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vsc.org/spiritual.htm "Spiritual Traditions and Vegetarianism"] at the Vegetarian Society of Colorado website. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301215408/http://www.vsc.org/spiritual.htm |date=March 1, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some particularly dedicated individuals are [[fruitarianism|fruitarians]].&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, Warren: ''World Religions'', 4th edition, Belmont: [[Thomson/Wadsworth]] 2005, p. 180. {{ISBN|0-534-52762-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Honey is forbidden, because honey is the regurgitation of nectar by bees &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vegetus.org/honey/honey.htm|title=Why honey is not vegan|author=Noah Lewis|date=|website=vegetus.org|accessdate=December 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may also contain eggs, excreta and dead bees. Some Jains do not consume plant parts that grow underground such as roots and bulbs, because the plants themselves and tiny animals may be killed when the plants are pulled up.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jainuniversity.org/jainism.aspx] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002010300/http://www.jainuniversity.org/jainism.aspx|date=October 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While classical Jewish law neither requires nor prohibits the consumption of meat, Jewish vegetarians often cite Jewish principles regarding [[Jewish ethics#Treatment of animals|animal welfare]], [[Jewish ethics#Environmental ethics|environmental ethics]], moral character, and [[Jewish ethics#Health and self-respect|health]] as reasons for adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hazon.org/jewish-food-movement/food-choices/animal-welfare/|title=Animal Welfare - Hazon|work=Hazon|access-date=March 26, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mary L. Zamore, ed. The Sacred Table: Creating a Jewish Food Ethic (New York, NY: CCAR Press, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of medieval [[rabbi]]s (e.g., [[Joseph Albo]] and [[Isaac Arama]]) regard vegetarianism as a moral ideal because the slaughter of animals might cause the individual who performs such acts to develop negative character traits.  Many modern rabbis, by contrast, advocate vegetarianism or veganism primarily because of concerns about animal welfare, especially in light of the traditional prohibition on causing unnecessary "pain to living creatures" ([[Tza'ar ba'alei chayim|tza'ar ba'alei hayyim]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rabbis and Vegetarianism: An Evolving Tradition|last=Kalechofsky|first=Roberta|publisher=Micah Publications|year=1995|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], consumption of meat was prohibited to human beings (1:29-30) though Noah was given permission to consume meat after the Great Flood.  Some advocates of Jewish vegetarianism, such as Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], describe vegetarianism as an [[Jewish eschatology|eschatological]] ideal to which all human beings must eventually return.&lt;ref name="kook"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kook|first=Avraham Yitzhak|authorlink=Avraham Yitzhak Kook|year=1961|title=A Vision of Vegetarianism and Peace|trans-title=|journal=|volume=|series=|issue=|page=|pages=|at=|chapter=|location=|publisher=|editor1-first=David|editor1-last=Cohen|editor1-link=David Cohen (rabbi)|language=|id=|isbn=|issn=|oclc=|pmid=|pmc=|bibcode=|doi=|accessdate=|url=http://jewishveg.com/AVisionofVegetarianismandPeace.pdf|laysource=|laysummary=|laydate=|quote=|ref=|separator=|postscript=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015020644/http://jewishveg.com/AVisionofVegetarianismandPeace.pdf|archive-date=October 15, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of Jewish vegetarian groups and activists promote such ideas and believe that the [[halakha|halakhic]] permission to eat meat is a temporary leniency for those who are not ready yet to accept the vegetarian diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishveg.com/torah.html |title=Judaism &amp; Vegetarianism |publisher=Jewishveg.com |accessdate=August 9, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902154013/http://www.jewishveg.com/torah.html |archive-date=September 2, 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; For some commentators, such as Rabbi [[Shlomo Ephraim Luntschitz]], the complexity of the laws of sacrifice and slaughter ([[shechita]]) was intended to discourage the consumption of meat and make it less painful for the animals.&lt;ref&gt;"The Vision of Eden: Animal Welfare and Vegetarianism" in "Jewish Law and Mysticism", Orot 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Jewish vegetarianism and veganism have become especially popular among Israeli Jews. In 2016, Israel was described as "the most vegan country on Earth", as five percent of its population eschewed all animal products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thetower.org/article/how-israel-became-the-global-center-of-veganism/|title=How Israel Became the Global Center of Veganism|work=The Tower|access-date=May 23, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Interest in veganism has grown among both non-Orthodox and Orthodox Jews in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-life-and-religion/197361/life-after-brisket|title=The Rise of Israel's Orthodox Vegan Movement – Tablet Magazine|website=www.tabletmag.com|language=en|access-date=May 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rastafari===
Within the Afro-Caribbean community, a minority are [[Rastafari movement|Rastafari]] and follow the dietary regulations with varying degrees of strictness. The most orthodox eat only "[[Ital]]" or natural foods, in which the matching of herbs or spices with vegetables is the result of long tradition originating from the African ancestry and cultural heritage of Rastafari.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, L (1980), ''The Rasta Cookbook'', 3rd ed. Mac Donald, London.&lt;/ref&gt; "Ital", which is derived from the word vital, means essential to human existence. Ital cooking in its strictest form prohibits the use of salt, meat (especially pork), preservatives, colorings, flavorings and anything artificial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ital Cooking|url=http://eatjamaican.com/ital-recipes/rastafarian-cooking.html|publisher=Eat Jamaican|accessdate=March 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Rastafari are vegetarian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kebede, A., &amp; Knotternus, D. | title = Beyond the pales of babylon: the ideational components and social psychological foundations of rastafari | journal = Sociological Perspectives | volume = 41 | issue = 3 | pages = 499–517 | year = 1998 | doi = 10.2307/1389561 | jstor = 1389561 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is understood to have been for the political reason of maintaining independence from the then-new Muslim hegemony, as Muslims largely adhere to the ritualistic [[halal]] diet.{{r|SHP|fool}}

"Amritdharis" that belong to some Sikh sects (e.g. [[Akhand Kirtani Jatha]], [[Damdami Taksal]], [[Namdhari]]&lt;ref&gt;Jane Srivastava, "[http://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=1541 Vegetarianism and Meat-Eating in 8 Religions]", ''[[Hinduism Today]]'', Spring 2007.

Who can define what is meat and what is not meat? Who knows where the sin lies, being a vegetarian or a non-vegetarian?"&lt;ref name="fool"/&gt; The Sikh [[Langar (Sikhism)|langar]], or free temple meal, is largely lacto-vegetarian, though this is understood to be a result of efforts to present a meal that is respectful of the diets of any person who would wish to dine, rather than out of dogma.{{r|hsp|fool}}

==Environment and diet==
{{Main|Environmental vegetarianism}}
Environmental vegetarianism is based on the concern that the production of meat and animal products for mass consumption, especially through [[factory farming]], is [[environmentalism|environmentally]] [[sustainable development|unsustainable]]. According to a 2006 United Nations initiative, the livestock industry is one of the largest contributors to environmental degradation worldwide, and modern practices of raising animals for food contribute on a "massive scale" to air and water pollution, [[land degradation]], climate change, and [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]]. The initiative concluded that "the livestock sector emerges as one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/a0701e/a0701e00.HTM |title=Livestock's Long Shadow – Environmental issues and options |publisher=Fao.org |accessdate=August 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, animal agriculture is a large source of greenhouse gases. According to a 2006 report it is responsible for 18% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions as estimated in 100-year CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalents.  Livestock sources (including enteric fermentation and manure) account for about 3.1 percent of US anthropogenic GHG emissions expressed as carbon dioxide equivalents.&lt;ref&gt;EPA.  2011.  Inventory of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and sinks:  1990–2009.  United States Environmental Protection Agency.  EPA 430-R-11-005.  459 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;  This EPA estimate is based on methodologies agreed to by the Conference of Parties of the UNFCCC, with 100-year global warming potentials from the IPCC Second Assessment Report used in estimating GHG emissions as carbon dioxide equivalents.

Meat produced in a laboratory (called [[in vitro meat]]) may be more environmentally sustainable than regularly produced meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19926635.600-comment-growing-m |title=Comment: Lab-grown meat could ease food shortage |last=Olsson |first=Anna |periodical= New Scientist |publication-date=July 8, 2008 |accessdate=November 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reactions of vegetarians vary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17113214 |title=Could vegetarians eat a 'test tube' burger? - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=March 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rearing a relatively small number of grazing animals can be beneficial, as the Food Climate Research Network at Surrey University reports: "A little bit of livestock production is probably a good thing for the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/nov/11/food.climatechange |title=Why eating less meat could cut global warming &amp;#124; Environment |publisher=Guardian.co.uk |date=November 10, 2007 |accessdate=March 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009, [[Ghent]], Belgium, was reported to be "the first [city] in the world to go vegetarian at least once a week" for environmental reasons, when local authorities decided to implement a "weekly meatless day". Civil servants would eat vegetarian meals one day per week, in recognition of the United Nations' report. Posters were put up by local authorities to encourage the population to take part on vegetarian days, and "veggie street maps" were printed to highlight vegetarian restaurants. In September 2009, schools in Ghent are due to have a weekly ''veggiedag'' ("vegetarian day") too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mason |first=Chris |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8046970.stm |title=Europe &amp;#124; Belgian city plans 'veggie' days |publisher=News.bbc.co.uk |date=May 12, 2009 |accessdate=March 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Labor conditions and diet==
Some groups, such as [[PETA]], promote vegetarianism as a way to offset poor treatment and working conditions of workers in the contemporary [[meat industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.goveg.com/workerrights.asp|title=Killing for a Living: How the Meat Industry Exploits Workers|accessdate=July 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; These groups cite studies showing the psychological damage caused by working in the meat industry, especially in factory and industrialised settings, and argue that the meat industry violates its labourers' human rights by assigning difficult and distressing tasks without adequate counselling, training and debriefing.&lt;ref name="labor"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2005/usa0105/4.htm |title=Worker Health and Safety in the Meat and Poultry Industry |publisher=Hrw.org |accessdate=August 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="labor2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncrlc.com/academic-SR-webpages/food_safety.html |title=Food Safety, the Slaughterhouse, and Rights |publisher=Ncrlc.com |date=March 30, 2004 |accessdate=August 9, 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071223175929/http://www.ncrlc.com/academic-SR-webpages/food_safety.html |archivedate = December 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="labor3"&gt;[http://www.safework.sa.gov.au/contentPages/docs/meatCultureLiteratureReviewV81.pdf Positive Safety Culture.

==Economics and diet==
Similar to environmental vegetarianism is the concept of [[economic vegetarianism]]. An economic vegetarian is someone who practices vegetarianism from either the philosophical viewpoint concerning issues such as public health and curbing world starvation, the belief that the consumption of meat is economically unsound, part of a conscious [[simple living]] strategy or just out of necessity. According to the [[Worldwatch Institute]], "Massive reductions in meat consumption in industrial nations will ease their health care burden while improving public health; declining livestock herds will take pressure off rangelands and grainlands, allowing the agricultural resource base to rejuvenate. As populations grow, lowering meat consumption worldwide will allow more efficient use of declining per capita land and water resources, while at the same time making grain more affordable to the world's chronically hungry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.worldwatch.org/press/news/1998/07/02 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 6, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517050751/http://www.worldwatch.org/press/news/1998/07/02/ |archivedate=May 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
Prejudice researcher Gordon Hodson observes that vegetarians and vegans frequently face [[discrimination]] where eating meat is held as a cultural norm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prejudice Against "Group X" (Asexuals)|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/without-prejudice/201209/prejudice-against-group-x-asexuals|publisher=[[Psychology Today]]|last=Hodson|first=Gordon|date=September 1, 2012|accessdate=December 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender===
A 1992 market research study conducted by the Yankelovich research organisation concluded that "of the 12.4 million people [in the US] who call themselves vegetarian, 68% are female, while only 32% are male".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Joanne McAllister Smart|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iggAAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA74#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The gender gap: if you're a vegetarian, odds are you're a woman. Why? |page=74|issue=210|issn=0164-8497|date=February 1995 |journal=Vegetarian Times|accessdate=January 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least one study indicates that vegetarian women are more likely to have female babies. A study of 6,000 pregnant women in 1998 "found that while the national average in Britain is 106 boys born to every 100 girls, for vegetarian mothers the ratio was just 85 boys to 100 girls".&lt;ref name="Babies"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/869696.stm |title='More girl babies' for vegetarians |publisher=BBC News |date=August 7, 2000 |accessdate=August 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catherine Collins of the [[British Dietetic Association]] has dismissed this as a "statistical fluke" given that it is actually the male's [[XY sex-determination system|genetic contribution]] which determines the sex of a baby.{{r|Babies}}
