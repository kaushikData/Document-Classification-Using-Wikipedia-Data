'''Adolf Thiel''' (February 12, 1915&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/astros/thiadolf|title=Encyclopedia Astronautica: Thiel, Adolf|accessdate=2016-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; – June 2, 2001 Los Angeles) was an [[Austria]]n-born [[Nazi Germany|German]] expert in [[guided missile]]s during [[World War II]], and later worked for the United States [[United States Army|Army]] and [[TRW Inc.|TRW]].&lt;ref name="latimes2001"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jul/12/local/me-21435 |title=Adolf Thiel; Oversaw Early Space Programs | work= Los Angeles Times |author=ELAINE WOO |date=2001-07-12 |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thiel had been an associate professor of engineering at the [[Darmstadt University of Technology|Institute of Technology]] in [[Darmstadt]] before joining [[Wernher von Braun]]'s team at the Army Research Center [[Peenemünde]], where he was involved in developing the [[V-2 rocket]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=K. Thiel |url=http://www.walter-thiel.de/17.html |title=Adolf Thiel - Walter Thiel - Raketeningenieur |publisher=Walter-thiel.de |date=2010-06-20 |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the war, he was transferred to the United States by the US Army  (see [[Operation Paperclip]] and [[German rocket scientists in the US]]) where he resumed his work with von Braun's group in [[Fort Bliss, Texas]]. During the nine years Thiel worked for the U.S. Army, he held positions at [[White Sands Missile Range]] in [[New Mexico]] and at [[Huntsville, Alabama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centennialofflight.net/essay/SPACEFLIGHT/delta/SP9.htm |title=Spaceflight :Thor, Agena, and Delta |publisher=centennialofflight.net |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He primarily supervised preliminary design of the [[Redstone (rocket)|Redstone]] missile and other short- and intermediate-range ballistic missile systems.

Thiel left the Army in 1955 to join Space Technology Laboratories, which later became TRW. During the late 1950s, he was program manager for the [[PGM-17 Thor|Thor]] ballistic missile, which became a first-stage launch for the [[Explorer program|Explorer]] spacecraft. He was director of space projects for TRW when it developed Explorer VI and Pioneer V, two of the earliest US craft to explore interplanetary space. He oversaw all of TRW's space programs during the 1970s.

After his retirement in 1980 as a senior vice president, Thiel served as an executive consultant to TRW and on [[NASA]] planning groups. He was named a fellow of the [[American Astronautical Society]] in 1968.&lt;ref name="latimes2001"/&gt;

==Family==
He married Frances Thiel; they had a son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsmr-history.org/V2Ladies.htm |title=White Sands Missile Range Museum Needs Help |publisher=Wsmr-history.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713124821/http://www.wsmr-history.org/V2Ladies.htm |archivedate=2010-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="360">An '''adparticle''' is an [[atom]], [[molecule]], or cluster of atoms or molecules that lies on a crystal surface.  The term is used in [[surface chemistry]].  The word is a contraction of "[[adsorption|adsorbed]] particle".  An adparticle that is a single atom may be referred to as an "[[adatom]]".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8798">'''Airy points''' (after [[George Biddell Airy]]&lt;ref name=Airy1845/&gt;) are used for precision measurement ([[metrology]]) to support a length standard in such a way as to minimise [[bending]] or [[wiktionary:Droop|droop]] of a horizontally supported [[Beam (structure)|beam]].

== Choice of support points ==
[[File:Bessel balken.png|thumb|A uniform beam deflects based on where it is supported.  (Vertical sag greatly exaggerated.)]]
A [[Kinematic coupling|kinematic support]] for a one-dimensional beam requires exactly two support points.  Three or more support points will not share the load evenly (unless they are hinged in a non-rigid [[whiffle tree]] or similar).  The position of those points can be chosen to minimize various forms of gravity deflection.

A beam supported at the ends will sag in the middle, resulting in the ends moving closer together and tilting upward.  A beam supported only in the middle will sag at the ends, making a similar shape but upside down.

== Airy points ==
[[File:Beam_supported_at_airy_points.png|thumb|A [[Beam (structure)|beam]] supported at its Airy points has parallel ends.]]
[[File:Airy_supportcoefficient_0,2113_s.jpg|thumb|Vertical and angular deflection of a beam supported at its Airy points.]]

Supporting a uniform beam at the Airy points produces zero angular deflection of the ends.&lt;ref name=Mitutoyo&gt;{{cite techreport |title=Quick Guide to Precision Measuring Instruments |url=http://www.mitutoyo.co.jp/eng/products/menu/quick_guide.pdf |publisher=[[Mitutoyo]] |id=No. E11003 (2) |date=October 2012 |page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Verdirame&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mechanicsandmachines.com/?p=330 |title=Airy Points, Bessel Points, Minimum Gravity Sag, and Vibration Nodal Points of Uniform Beams |date=10 February 2016 |first=Justin |last=Verdirame |accessdate=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Airy points are symmetrically arranged around the centre of the length standard and are separated by a distance equal to  
:&lt;math&gt;
1/\sqrt{3}=0.57735...
&lt;/math&gt;
of the length of the rod.

"End standards", that is standards whose length is defined as the distance between their flat ends such as long [[gauge block]]s or the {{lang|fr|[[History of the metre#Mètre des Archives|mètre des Archives]]}}, must be supported at the Airy points so that their length is well-defined; if the ends are not parallel, the [[measurement uncertainty]] is increased because the length depends on which part of the end is measured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/jres/117/jres.117.013.pdf |volume=117 |pages=216–230 |date=2012 |doi=10.6028/jres.117.013 |journal=Journal of Research of the National Institute of Standards and Technology |title=A Model for Geometry-Dependent Errors in Length Artifacts |first1=Daniel |last1=Sawyer |first2=Brian |last2=Parry |first3=Steven |last3=Phillips |first4=Chris |last4=Blackburn |first5=Bala |last5=Muralikrishnan }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|218}}  For this reason, the Airy points are commonly identified by inscribed marks or lines. For example, a 1000&amp;nbsp;mm [[length gauge]] would have an Airy point separation of 577.4&amp;nbsp;mm.  A line or pair of lines would be marked onto the gauge 211.3&amp;nbsp;mm in from each end. Supporting the artifact at these points ensures that the [[calibrate]]d length is preserved.

Airy's 1845 paper&lt;ref name=Airy1845&gt;{{cite journal |title=On the Flexure of a uniform Bar supported by a number of equal Pressures at equidistant points, and on the Positions proper for the Applications of these Pressures, in order to prevent any sensible Alteration of the Length of the Bar by small Flexure |first=G. B. |last=Airy |authorlink=George Biddell Airy |journal=[[MNRAS]] |date=10 January 1845 |volume=6 |issue=12 |pages=143–146 |doi=10.1093/mnras/6.12.143 |url=http://mnras.oxfordjournals.org/content/6/12/143 |type=pdf|bibcode=1845MNRAS...6..143A }}&lt;/ref&gt; derives the equation for {{mvar|n}} equally spaced support points.  In this case, the distance between each support is the fraction
:&lt;math&gt;c = 1/\sqrt{n^2-1}&lt;/math&gt;
the length of the rod.  He also derives the formula for a rod which extends beyond the reference marks.

== Bessel points ==
[[File:Beam_supported_at_Bessel_points.png|thumb|A beam supported at its Bessel points has maximum length.]]
[[File:US National Length Meter.JPG|thumb|One end of a prototype metre bar, an example of a line standard.  A fine line marked on the polished section of the central rib marks one end.]]
"Line standards" are measured between lines marked on their surfaces.  They are much less convenient to use than end standards&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/bulletin/01/nbsbulletinv1n1p5_A2b.pdf |title=Recomparison of the United States prototype meter |first=Louis A. |last=Fischer |journal=Bulletin of the Bureau of Standards |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=5–19 |date=November 1904 |doi=10.6028/bulletin.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite techreport |url=http://digicoll.manoa.hawaii.edu/techreports/PDF/NBS15.pdf |title=Calibration of Line Standards of Length and Measuring Tapes at the National Bureau of Standards |first=Lewis V. |last=Judson |date=20 May 1960 |id=NBS Monograph 15 |publisher=[[National Bureau of Standards]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; but, when the marks are placed on the [[neutral plane]] of the beam, allow greater accuracy.

To support a line standard, one wishes to minimise the ''linear'', rather than angular, motion of the ends.  The '''Bessel points''' (after [[Friedrich Bessel]]) are the points at which the length of the beam is maximized.  Because this is a [[maximum]], the effect of a small positioning error is proportional to the square of the error, an even smaller amount.&lt;!-- Any better way to explain this without calculus? --&gt;

The Bessel points are located 0.5594 of the length of the rod apart, slightly closer than the Airy points.&lt;ref name=Mitutoyo/&gt;&lt;ref name=Verdirame/&gt;{{dubious|Location of Bessel points not clear|date=November 2016|reason=Different sources give difference values.}}

Because line standards invariably extend beyond the lines marked on them, the optimal support points depend on both the overall length and the length to be measured.  The latter is the quantity to be maximized, requiring a more complex calculation.  For example, the 1927–1960 definition of the [[metre]] specified that the [[International Prototype Metre]] bar was to be measured while "supported on two cylinders of at least one centimetre diameter, symmetrically placed in the same horizontal plane at a distance of 571&amp;nbsp;mm from each other."&lt;ref&gt;{{SIbrochure8th|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Those would be the Bessel points of a beam 1020&amp;nbsp;mm long.

== Other support points of interest ==
Other sets of support points, even closer than the Bessel points, which may be wanted in some applications are:&lt;ref name=Verdirame/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis |type=Ph.D. thesis |first=Gert-Jan |last=Nijsse |title=Linear Motion Systems.

* The points for minimum sag, 0.5536 times the length.  Minimum sag occurs when the centre of the rod sags the same amount as the end points, which is not quite the same thing as minimum ''horizontal'' motion of the ends.
* The [[Node (physics)|node]]s of free vibration, 0.5516 times the length.
* The points for zero central sag (any closer and the beam rises between the support points): 0.5228 times the length.

'''Armadillo''' is a [[linear algebra]] software library for the [[C++|C++ programming language]].  It aims to provide efficient and streamlined base calculations, while at the same time having a straightforward and easy-to-use interface.  Its intended target users are scientists and engineers.

It supports integer, floating point ([[single precision|single]] and [[double precision floating-point format|double]] precision), [[complex number]]s, and a subset of [[Trigonometric functions|trigonometric]] and [[statistics]] functions. Various [[matrix decomposition]]s are provided through optional integration with Linear Algebra PACKage ([[LAPACK]]) and [[Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software]] (ATLAS) libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Armadillo: a template-based C++ library for linear algebra |author=Conrad Sanderson and Ryan Curtin|journal=Journal of Open Source Software |volume=1 |pages=26 |year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://jmlr.org/papers/v14/curtin13a.html |title=MLPACK: A Scalable C++ Machine Learning Library |author=Ryan Curtin |journal=Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR) |volume=14 |issue=Mar |pages= 801–805 |year=2013 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; High-performance BLAS/LAPACK replacement libraries such as [[OpenBLAS]] and [[Math Kernel Library|Intel MKL]] can also be used.

The library employs a [[Lazy evaluation|delayed-evaluation]] approach (during [[compile time]]) to combine several operations into one and reduce (or eliminate) the need for temporaries. Where applicable, the order of operations is optimised. Delayed evaluation and optimisation are achieved through [[template metaprogramming]].

Armadillo is related to the [[Boost (C++ libraries)|Boost]] Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (uBLAS) library, which also uses [[template metaprogramming]]. However, Armadillo builds upon [[Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software|ATLAS]] and [[LAPACK]] libraries, thereby providing machine-dependent optimisations and functions not present in uBLAS.

It is [[open-source software]] distributed under the permissive [[Apache License]], making it applicable for the [[Software development|development]] of both [[Open-source software|open source]] and [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] software. The project is supported by the [[NICTA]] research centre in Australia.

==Example in C++ 11==
Here is a trivial example demonstrating Armadillo functionality:

&lt;source lang="cpp"&gt;
// Compile with:
// $ g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp -o file_name -O2 -larmadillo

#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;armadillo&gt;

int main()
{
                                                //    ^
  // Position of a particle                     //    |
  arma::vec Pos = {{0},                         //    | (0,1)
                   {1}};                        //    +---x--&gt;

  // Rotation matrix 
  double phi = -3.1416/2; 
  arma::mat RotM = {{+cos(phi), -sin(phi)},
                    {+sin(phi), +cos(phi)}};

  Pos.print("Current position of the particle:");
  std::cout &lt;&lt; "Rotating the point " &lt;&lt; phi*180/3.1416 &lt;&lt; " deg" &lt;&lt; std::endl;

  Pos = RotM*Pos;

  Pos.print("New position of the particle:");   //    ^
                                                //    x (1,0)
                                                //    | 
                                                //    +------&gt;

  return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==Example in C++ 98==
Here is an other trivial example in C++ 98:

&lt;source lang="cpp"&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;armadillo&gt;

int main()
{
  arma::vec b;
  b &lt;&lt; 2.0 &lt;&lt; 5.0 &lt;&lt; 2.0;

  // arma::endr represents the end of a row in a matrix
  arma::mat A;
  A &lt;&lt; 1.0 &lt;&lt; 2.0 &lt;&lt; arma::endr
    &lt;&lt; 2.0 &lt;&lt; 3.0 &lt;&lt; arma::endr
    &lt;&lt; 1.0 &lt;&lt; 3.0 &lt;&lt; arma::endr;

  std::cout &lt;&lt; "Least squares solution:\n";
  std::cout &lt;&lt; solve(A,b) &lt;&lt; '\n';

  return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Background noise''' or '''ambient noise''' is any [[sound]] other than the sound being monitored (primary sound). Background [[noise]] is a form of [[noise pollution]] or [[Interference (communication)|interference]]. Background noise is an important concept in setting noise levels affect your background in formations. See [[noise criteria]] for cinema/home cinema applications.

Examples of background noises are [[Noise (environmental)|environmental noises]] such as [[water waves|waves]], [[traffic]] noise, [[alarms]], people talking, [[bioacoustics|bioacoustic noise]] from animals or birds and mechanical noise from devices such as [[refrigerator]]s or [[air conditioning]], [[power supplies]] or [[electric motor|motors]].

The prevention or reduction of background noise is important in the field of [[active noise control]]. It is an important consideration with the use of [[ultrasound]] (e.g. for medical diagnosis or imaging), [[sonar]], and [[sound reproduction]].

==Other uses==
In [[astronomy]], background noise or [[cosmic background radiation]] is [[electromagnetic radiation]] from the sky with no discernible source.

In [[information architecture]], irrelevant, duplicate or incorrect information may be called background noise.

In [[physics]] and [[telecommunication]], background [[signal noise]] can be detrimental or in some cases beneficial. The study of avoiding, reducing or using signal noise is [[information theory]].

In [[telephony]], artificial [[comfort noise]] is used as a substitute for natural background noise, to fill in artificial silence created by [[discontinuous transmission]] systems using [[voice activity detection]].
Background noise can also affect concentration.

==Biography==
Chilisa was born and raised in the small village of Nshakazhogwe in [[Botswana]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Chilisa, Bagele. (2012). ''Indigenous research methodologies.'' Los Angeles, CA: Sage. {{ISBN|9781412958820}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|xx}} Her parents, Motlalepul and Zwambele Kenosi, were [[Subsistence agriculture|subsistence farmers]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;{{Rp|xxi}} Her parents, and her grandmother, Ponya Kenosi, passed [[oral literature]] to her as a child,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;{{Rp|xxiii}} stimulating her lifelong interest in indigenous knowledge systems. In her book, ''Indigenous Research Methodologies'' (2012), Chilisa states:&lt;blockquote&gt;I belong to the Bantu people of Africa, who live a communal life based on a connectedness that stretches from birth to death, continues beyond death, and extends to the living and the nonliving. I am known and communicate in relational terms that connect me to all my relations, living and the nonliving. It is common for people to refer to each other using totems as well as relational terms such as ''uncle, aunt, brother,'' and so on. For instance, my totem is a crocodile, and depending on who is talking to me and on what occasion, I can be referred to using my totem.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;{{Rp|3}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Education===
Chilisa credits her father with teaching her the alphabet before she began attending school. Because her family lived near a village [[granary]], she also learned to count before she began formal schooling.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;{{Rp|xix}} She attended primary and secondary school in Botswana. From the [[University of Pittsburgh]], Chilisa earned her Master of Arts degree in Research Methodology, and her PhD in Policy, Planning, and Evaluation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Career===
Chilisa is a full professor at the University of Botswana, housed in the Post Graduate Research and Evaluation Programme. She teaches courses in research methods and evaluation, and policy design. She teaches both graduate and undergraduate students at the University of Botswana.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;[[File:University of Botswana, Gaborone.jpg|alt=aerial photograph of University of Botswana|thumb|Aerial view of the University of Botswana, where Bagele Chilisa works.]]

Chilisa is a renowned scholar of indigenous research methods,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; having published books and journal articles on the topic&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and spoken at national and international conferences.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;{{Rp|xxii-xxiii}} Her research focuses on communities in Botswana and other regions in southern Africa,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/lsereviewofbooks/2013/02/11/book-review-indigenous-research-methodologies/|title=Book Review: Indigenous Research Methodologies by Bagele Chilisa|last=de Goede|first=Meike|date=2013|work=LSE Review of Books|access-date=2018-08-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; but application of her ideas about indigenous research methods are worldwide.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She is hailed as an "African thought leader driving the concept of African-rooted evaluation."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the preface to her important text,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; ''Indigenous Research Methodologies'', Chilisa credits her father with instilling within her the "ways in which indigenous practices and values on connectedness and relational ways of knowing of the [[Colony|colonized]] Other could be valorized in research."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;{{Rp|xx}}

At the University of Botswana, Chilisa has an extensive record of service. She was a member of the board for the University of Botswana Centre for Scientific Research and Indigenous Knowledge and Innovations, as well as serving on the board of the University of Botswana Research Ethics Committee.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

Chilisa has served [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs) as an evaluator for international projects including [[UNESCO]], [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP), the [[World Bank]], the [[International Labour Organization|International Labour Organisation]], and the [[UNICEF|United Nations Children's Fund]]. Chilisa has received multiple grants from international organizations to do research, including grants from the World Bank, the [[National Institutes of Health|National Institute of Health]] (USA), and [[UNICEF]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;{{Rp|xxii}} In 2018, Chilisa was appointed to serve on the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Evaluation Advisory Panel (EAP).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

She co-founded the Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland and Namibia Research Association, was the president of the Botswana Educational Research Association, and edited the ''Botswana Educational Research Journal.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9160">In the [[psychology]] of [[motivation]], '''balance theory''' is a theory of [[attitude change]], proposed by [[Fritz Heider]].&lt;ref&gt;Heider, Fritz (1958). ''The Psychology of Interpersonal Relations''. John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; It conceptualizes the [[cognitive consistency]] motive as a drive toward psychological balance. The consistency motive is the urge to maintain one's values and beliefs over time.  Heider proposed that "sentiment" or liking relationships are balanced if the [[affect (psychology)|affect]] [[valence (psychology)|valence]] in a system multiplies out to a positive result.

In [[social network analysis]], balance theory is the extension proposed by [[Frank Harary]] and Dorwin Cartwright.  It was the framework for the discussion at a [[Dartmouth College]] symposium in September 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Paul W. Holland &amp; Samuel Leinhardt (editors) (1979) ''Perspectives on Social Network Research'', [[Academic Press]] {{ISBN|9780123525505}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==P-O-X model==
[[File:Pox.jpg|thumb|Heider's P-O-X model]]
For example: a Person (&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;) who likes (&lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt;) an Other (&lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt;) person will be balanced by the same valence attitude on behalf of the other.  Symbolically, &lt;math&gt;P (+) &gt; O&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P &lt; (+) O&lt;/math&gt; results in psychological balance.

This can be extended to things or objects (&lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;) as well, thus introducing [[triadic relation]]ships.  If a person &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; likes object &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; but dislikes other person &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt;, what does &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; feel upon learning that person &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; created the object &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;?  This is symbolized as such:
*&lt;math&gt; P (+) &gt; X &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; P (-) &gt; O &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; O (+) &gt; X &lt;/math&gt;

Cognitive balance is achieved when there are three positive links or two negatives with one positive. Two positive links and one negative like the example above creates imbalance or [[Cognitive dissonance]].

Multiplying the signs shows that the person will perceive imbalance (a negative multiplicative product) in this relationship, and will be motivated to correct the imbalance somehow.  The Person can either:
* Decide that &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; isn't so bad after all,
* Decide that &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; isn't as great as originally thought, or
* Conclude that &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; couldn't really have made &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

Any of these will result in psychological balance, thus resolving the dilemma and satisfying the drive.  (Person &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; could also avoid object &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and other person &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; entirely, lessening the stress created by psychological imbalance.)

To predict the outcome of a situation using Heider's balance theory, one must weigh the effects of all the potential results, and the one requiring the least amount of effort will be the likely outcome.


Determining if the triad is balanced is simple math:

&lt;math&gt; + + + = + &lt;/math&gt;; Balanced.

&lt;math&gt; - + - = + &lt;/math&gt;; Balanced.

&lt;math&gt; - + + = - &lt;/math&gt;; Unbalanced.

==Examples==
Balance theory is also useful in examining how [[Testimonial|celebrity endorsement]] affects consumers' [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] toward products.&lt;ref&gt;John C. Mowen and Stephen W. Brown (1981) ,"On Explaining and Predicting the Effectiveness of Celebrity Endorsers", in Advances in Consumer Research Volume 08, eds. Kent B. Monroe, Advances in Consumer Research Volume 08 : Association for Consumer Research, Pages: 437-441.&lt;/ref&gt; If a person likes a celebrity and perceives (due to the endorsement) that said celebrity likes a product, said person will tend to like the product more, in order to achieve psychological balance.

However, if the person already had a dislike for the product being endorsed by the celebrity, they may begin disliking the celebrity, again to achieve psychological balance.

Heider's balance theory can explain why holding the same negative attitudes of others promotes closeness (see [[The enemy of my enemy is my friend]]).

==Signed graphs and social networks==
[[Frank Harary]] and Dorwin Cartwright looked at Heider's triads as 3-cycles in a [[signed graph]]. The sign of a [[path (graph theory)|path]] in a [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] is the product of the signs of its edges. They considered [[cycle (graph theory)|cycle]]s in a signed graph representing a social network.
: A balanced signed graph has only cycles of positive sign.
Harary proved that a balanced graph is polarized, that is, it decomposes into two positive subgraphs that are joined by negative edges.

In the interest of realism, a weaker property was suggested by Davis:&lt;ref&gt;[[James A. Davis]] (May 1967) "Clustering and structural balance in graphs", [[Human Relations]] 20:181–7&lt;/ref&gt;
:No cycle has exactly one negative edge.
Graphs with this property may decompose into more than two positive subgraphs called '''clusters'''. The property has been called the ''clusterability axiom''.&lt;ref&gt;Claude Flament (1979) "Independent generalizations of balance", in ''Perspectives on Social Network Research''&lt;/ref&gt; Then balanced graphs are recovered by assuming the 
: Parsimony axiom: The subgraph of positive edges has at most two [[component (graph theory)|component]]s.

The significance of balance theory for [[social dynamics]] was expressed by [[Anatol Rapoport]]:
:The hypothesis implies roughly that attitudes of the group members will tend to change in such a way that one's [[friend of a friend|friends' friends]] will tend to become one's friends and one's enemies' enemies also one's friends, and one's enemies' friends and one's friends' enemies will tend to become one's enemies, and moreover, that these changes tend to operate even across several removes (one's friends' friends' enemies' enemies tend to become friends by an iterative process).&lt;ref&gt;[[Anatol Rapoport]] (1963) "Mathematical models of social interaction", in [https://archive.org/details/handbookofmathem017893mbp ''Handbook of Mathematical Psychology'', v. 2], pp 493 to 580, especially 541, editors: R.A. Galanter, R.R. Lace, E. Bush, [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]&lt;/ref&gt;
Note that a triangle of three mutual enemies makes a clusterable graph but ''not'' a balanced one. Therefore, in a clusterable network one ''cannot'' conclude that [[the enemy of my enemy is my friend]], although this aphorism is a fact in a balanced network.
===Criticism===
Claude Flament&lt;ref&gt;Claude Flament (1963) ''Application of Graph Theory to Group Structure'', translators Maurice Pinard, Raymond Breton, Fernand Fontaine, chapter 3: Balancing Processes, page 92, [[Prentice-Hall]]&lt;/ref&gt; expressed a limit to balance theory imposed by reconciling [[weak ties]] with relationships of stronger force such as [[human bonding|family bonds]]:
:One might think that a [[graph (abstract data type)|valued algebraic graph]] is necessary to represent psycho-social reality, if it is to take into account the degree of intensity of interpersonal relationships. But in fact it then seems hardly possible to define the balance of a graph, not for mathematical but for psychological reasons. If the relationship ''AB'' is +3, the relationship ''BC'' is –4, what should the ''AC'' relationship be in order that the triangle be balanced? The psychological hypotheses are wanting, or rather they are numerous and little justified.

At the 1975 Dartmouth College colloquium on balance theory, Bo Anderson struck at the heart of the notion:&lt;ref&gt;Bo Anderson (1979) "Cognitive Balance Theory and Social Network Analysis: Remarks on some fundamental theoretical matters", pages 453 to 69 in ''Perspectives on Social Network Research'', see page 462.&lt;/ref&gt;
:In graph theory there exists a ''formal'' balance theory that contains theorems that are ''analytically'' true. The statement that Heider's ''psychological'' balance can be represented, in its essential aspects, by a suitable interpretation of that ''formal balance theory'' should, however, be regarded as problematical. We cannot routinely identify the positive and negative lines in the formal theory with the positive and negative "sentiment relations", and identify the formal balance notion with the ''psychological'' idea of balance or structural tension. .. It is puzzling that the fine structure of the relationships between formal and psychological balance has been given scant attention by balance theorists.

[[File:Aconitum napellus 230705.jpg|thumb|''[[Aconitum napellus]]'', a member of the flowering genus ''Aconitum'', sometimes called ''Wolfsbane'']]
The term '''bane''' (from {{lang-ang|bana}}, meaning "thing causing death, poison"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bane|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/bane?q=bane|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[botany]], is an archaic element in the [[common name]]s of [[plant]]s known to be [[toxic]] or [[poison]]ous.

In the [[Middle Ages]], several poisonous plants of the genus [[Aconitum]] were thought to have or [[prophylactic]] qualities, repelling and protecting against that which they were ''banes'' to (e.g. ''[[Henbane]]'', ''Wolfsbane'').

==Variants==
There is no single [[species]], [[genus]], or [[family (biology)|family]] of poisonous plant exclusively referred to as ''banes''. Several unrelated plants bear the name.

;Austrian Leopard's Bane
:''[[Doronicum austriacum]]'', it grows between approximately 60 and 90 centimetres high with a spacing of 45 to 60 cm. It prefers full sun exposure to partial shade, requires little water, blooms in late spring to early summer, and has a bloom colour of bright yellow. The propagation for this plant would be division of [[rhizomes]], [[tubers]], corns, or the [[bulb]]s including the off position of the seeds.

;Common Dogbane
:''[[Apocynum androsaemifolium]]'', a perennial [[herbaceous]] small shrub, growing up to one metre high, of the [[Apocynaceae]] family.

;Dog Bane
:''[[Plectranthus ornatus]]'' a perennial in the [[Lamiaceae]] family, said to repel dogs from gardens. Grows to a height of about 24-36 in. The plant prefers full sun exposure and not to be over watered. ''P. ornatus'' has a bloom time of late summer, early fall to mid-fall and a bloom color of light blue, violet, or lavender.

;[[Leopard's Bane]]
:''[[Doronicum orientale]]'', also known as ''Little Leo''. It grows between 40 and 46 cm high with a spacing of about 23 to 30 cm. All parts of the plant are poisonous if ingested. This plant is sensitive to the sun and over watering.

==In culture==
In [[medieval Europe]], the toxic [[entheogen]] [[Aconitine]] was believed to prevent [[werewolves]] from undergoing their dire transformations.

In the [[Southeastern United States]], sheep and cattle straying into woodland and grazing ''[[Kalmia latifolia]]'' have been known to suffer from its toxic effects.

The '''blunt-eared bat''' or '''Peruvian crevice-dwelling bat''' (''Tomopeas ravus'') is a [[species]] of [[bat]] in the family [[Molossidae]]. It is [[monotypic]] within the [[genus]] ''Tomopeas'' and subfamily Tomopeatinae. It is [[Endemism|endemic]] to [[Peru]], where it is considered critically endangered.  It is threatened by [[habitat loss]].&lt;ref name="iucn 2016"/&gt;

==Taxonomy and etymology==
The classification of the blunt-eared bat has historically been problematic. When it was first described by [[Gerrit Smith Miller]] in 1900, it was placed in [[Vespertilionidae]].&lt;ref name="Sudman 1994"/&gt; 
In 1970, it was proposed that it should be in its own family, due to its intermediate qualities between Vespertilionidae and Molossidae.&lt;ref name="Davis 1970"/&gt;
Taxonomists continued to place it in the vesper bat family&lt;ref name="Gregorin 2003"&gt;Gregorin, R. (2003). Comparative morphology of the tongue in free-tailed bats (Chiroptera, Molossidae). Iheringia. Série Zoologia, 93(2), 213-221.&lt;/ref&gt; until a 1994 study of their mitochondrial DNA showed that they were better placed in [[Molossidae]].&lt;ref name="Sudman 1994"&gt;Sudman, P. D., Barkley, L. J., &amp; Hafner, M. S. (1994). Familial affinity of Tomopeas ravus (Chiroptera) based on protein electrophoretic and cytochrome b sequence data. Journal of Mammalogy, 75(2), 365-377.&lt;/ref&gt;
It is now widely recognized as the only member of subfamily Tomopeatinae of family Molossidae.&lt;ref name="Simmons 2005"&gt;Wilson, D. E., &amp; Reeder, D. M. (Eds.). (2005). Mammal species of the world: a taxonomic and geographic reference. JHU Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
There is evidence that it is [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] to all other [[genus|genera]] of the Molossidae.&lt;ref name="Sudman 1994"/&gt;

Its genus name ''Tomopeas'' is possibly a reference to the [[Malay language|Malay]] word "mops", meaning "bat";&lt;ref&gt;Best, T. L., Kiser, W. M., &amp; Freeman, P. W. (1996). Eumops perotis.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller used "mops" in other genera he described, including [[Eumops]] and [[Nyctinomops]].&lt;ref name="Miller 1902"&gt;Miller, G. S. (1902). Twenty new American bats. Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, 389-412.&lt;/ref&gt;
''Ravus'' is [[Latin]] for [[tawny (color)|tawny]].&lt;ref name="Bostock 2013"&gt;Bostock, P. D. (2013). A Primer of Botanical Latin with Vocabulary.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Their fur is pale yellowish-gray in color, while their flight membranes are dark.&lt;ref name="Davis 1970"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller 1900"/&gt;
Their face and ears are also dark in color.
Their ventral fur is lighter than their dorsal fur, and is a creamy [[Buff (colour)|buff]] color.
The fur is soft and dense, with individual hairs approximately {{convert|8|mm|in|abbr=on}} long.
The [[interfemoral membrane|uropatagium]] is sparsely furred on both its dorsal and ventral sides.&lt;ref name="Miller 1900"/&gt;
Like other free-tailed bats, the blunt-eared bat has a blunt [[tragus (ear)#other animals|tragus]], a small but defined [[antitragus]], tubular nostrils, and fusion of the [[vertebral column#vertebrae|seventh cervical and first thoracic vertebrae]].&lt;ref name="Sudman 1994"/&gt;
They are extremely small in size, weighing only {{convert|2-3.5|g|oz|abbr=on}}.
From nose to tail, they are {{convert|73-85|mm|in|abbr=on}} long.
Their forearms are {{convert|31.2-34.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} long.
Males and females are similar in size.
Unlike other free-tailed bats, the projection of the tail from the [[interfemoral membrane|uropatagium]] is very short, with only the last two caudal vertebrae extending past the membrane, measuring {{convert|5-6|mm|in|abbr=on}} long.&lt;ref name="Davis 1970"/&gt;
Their [[dentition#dental formula|dental formula]] is {{DentalFormula|upper=1.1.1.3|lower=2.1.2.3}}, for a total of 28 teeth.&lt;ref name="Miller 1900"&gt;Miller Jr, G. S. (1900). LXXIV.—A new bat from Peru. Journal of Natural History, 6(36), 570-574.&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[calcar]] forms a small but distinct lobe, and its keel is narrow and inconspicuous.&lt;ref name="Miller 1900"/&gt;

==Biology==
As they are relatively uncommon, not much is known about their biology. Juveniles, lactating females, and lactating females have all been encountered in July and August, suggesting that this is a time of high reproductive activity.&lt;ref name="Davis 1970"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barkley 2008"&gt;Barkley, L.J. 2008. Subfamily Tomopeatinae Miller, 1907. In: Gardner, A.L. (ed.), Mammals of South America. Volume 1. Marsupials, xenarthrans, shrews, and bats, pp. 439-440. The University of Chicago Press, Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt;
They are insectivorous.
They have been found to be infected with the [[protozoa]]n endoparasite ''[[Eimeria]]''.
A new species of ''Eimeria'' was [[species description|described]] from the blunt-eared bat; it was named ''Eimeria tomopea'' in reference to this fact.&lt;ref name="Duszynski 1985"&gt;Duszynski, D. W., &amp; Barkley, L. J. (1985). Eimeria from bats of the world: A new species in Tomopeas ravus from Peru. The Journal of parasitology, 204-208.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Range and habitat==
It is endemic to Peru.
Its range is restricted to the arid and semiarid regions of Peru's coastal region.&lt;ref name="iucn 2016"/&gt;
They are found from {{convert|0-2300|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level.
During the day, it roosts in the crevices of granite boulders and outcroppings.
The crevices they use are small, at only {{convert|0.5-1|in|cm|abbr=on}}.
They possibly prefer crevices that face the west or southwest.&lt;ref name="Davis 1970"&gt;Davis, W. B. (1970). Tomopeas ravus Miller (Chiroptera). Journal of Mammalogy, 51(2), 244-247.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2010, a blunt-eared bat was discovered {{convert|230|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of the previous estimated range. This capture was the first time the blunt-eared bat was observed in over thirty years.&lt;ref name="Zamora 2014"&gt;Zamora, H., Medina, C., Escobar, A., Arteaga, Y., Cadenillas, R., &amp; Velazco, P. M. (2014). New distributional record of the rare endemic Peruvian Tomopeas ravus Miller, 1900 (Chiroptera, Molossidae, Tomopeatinae).&lt;/ref&gt;
A 2013 study suggested that their range might extend into southwest [[Ecuador]], as the habitat would be similar to where they are found in Peru. So far, there is no evidence to confirm this.&lt;ref name="Velazco 2013"/&gt;

==Conservation==
It has only been encountered in twelve localities, four of which are less than {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}} apart. Its area of occupancy is estimated at less than {{convert|100|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}.
In Peru, it is considered critically endangered.
The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] assessed it as [[vulnerable species|vulnerable]] in 1996 and 2008, but revised its classification to [[endangered species|endangered]] in 2016.
They identify [[habitat destruction]] as the primary threat to this species; its habitat is being lost to agricultural conversion and urbanization.
This species is possibly under threat by efforts to control [[vampire bat]]s. Sometimes, entire caves are fumigated, which kills all the bats inside.&lt;ref name="iucn 2016"/&gt;
In 2013, bat researchers reported capturing two individuals with "relatively little sampling effort," causing them to question if the species is actually rare or if it is not encountered due to inappropriate sampling methods.&lt;ref name="Velazco 2013"&gt;Velazco, P. M., Cadenillas, R., Centty, O., Huamaní, L., &amp; Zamora, H. (2013). New records of Platalina genovensium (Chiroptera, Phyllostomidae) and Tomopeas ravus (Chiroptera, Molossidae).

'''''Calyptra''''' (from [[wikt:καλύπτρα#Ancient Greek|καλύπτρα]] (''kalúptra'') "veil") is a scientific term used in [[botany]]. It describes a feature in [[plant morphology]].
[[Image:Tortula muralis kalyptra.jpeg|thumb|300px|Calyptra of tortula moss ''Tortula muralis'']]
[[Image:Physcomitrella Sporophyt.JPG|thumb|300px|Calyptra on top of the brown spore capsule (sporophyte) of the moss ''[[Physcomitrella patens]]''. The brownish archegonial venter is still visible.]]

==Bryophytes==
In [[bryophytes]], the '''calyptra''' (''plural'' calyptrae) is an enlarged [[Archegonium|archegonial]] venter that protects the capsule containing the embryonic [[sporophyte]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ralf Reski]] (1998): Development, genetics and molecular biology of mosses. In: Botanica Acta. 111, 1-15.&lt;/ref&gt; The calyptra is usually lost before the spores are released from the capsule. The shape of the calyptra can be used for identification purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last=Malcolm; Malcolm| first= Bill; Nancy| title= Mosses and other Bryophytes, an Illustrated Glossary| year=2006| publisher=Micro-Optics Press| page=65| isbn=0-9582224-7-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flowering plants==
In [[flowering plant]]s, the calyptra is a covering tissue for [[stamen]]s and [[carpel]]s.  The name is also used for the capping tissue of [[root]]s, the [[root cap]].

'''Charles Elmer Resser''' (1889-1943), was an American paleontologist, born in East Berlin, Pennsylvania. He was educated at Pennsylvania State Teachers College (graduation in 1912), Franklin and Marshall College (B.A., 1913), Princeton University (M.A., 1915) and  George Washington University (Ph.D., 1917). Resser developed an interest in Cambrian fossils when he was a student of H. Justin Roddy at Franklin and Marshall College.

==Career==
In 1914 Resser came to the United States National Museum as an assistant to [[Charles Doolittle Walcott|Walcott]]. He was appointed Assistant Curator in the Division of Paleontology in 1915. Further positions were Assistant Curator, Division of Stratigraphic Paleontology (1923), Associate Curator, Division of Stratigraphic Paleontology (1924-1928), Curator, Division of Stratigraphic Paleontology (1929-1940); and Curator, Division of Invertebrate Paleontology and Paleobotany (1941-1943). Resser was a part-time faculty member at George Washington University from 1915 to 1932. At the University of Maryland Resser taught geology for a number of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= SIA RU007232, Resser, Charles Elmer 1889-1943, Charles Elmer Resser Papers, 1912-1942 and undated|website= Smithsonian Institution Archives|access-date= 2015-01-13|url= http://siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris_arc_217389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2612">'''Housing co-partnership''' was a [[social movement]] that developed alongside the [[garden city movement]] in Britain between 1900 and 1914 and which financed and built most of the suburbs and villages associated with that movement. It was also a unique form of tenure combining features of a tenant co-operative and a limited dividend company.

The idea of [[Housing cooperative#United Kingdom|co-operative housing]] can be traced back to early 19th Century figures, notably [[Robert Owen]] and [[Charles Fourier]].  Providing housing was one of the key objectives of the [[Rochdale Pioneers]], an early British co-op whose principles were associated with the rapid growth of the [[History of the cooperative movement|co-operative movement]] in the second half of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.cottontimes.co.uk/co-op03.htm|title=SOCIAL STRIFE: The birth of the Co-op|pages=3|author=Doug Peacock|work=Cotton Times: understanding the industrial revolution}} &lt;!-- This citation only confirms the Rochdale Pioneers role as an inspiration for 19th century co-operatives.  It doesn't mention its housing ambitions. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it was not until 1901 that the first successful wave of co-partnerships was set up at [[Brentham Garden Suburb|Brentham]] in [[Ealing]] in west London. Its leading figure was [[Henry Harvey Vivian]].

The connections between the garden city and co-operative movements go back to the 1870s and 1880s when [[Ebenezer Howard]] was moving in radical circles which included utopian community builders and land reformers. But the practical link came in 1901 when London lawyer and chairman of the Labour Association, Ralph Neville, was persuaded by Howard to become chair of the Garden City Association (GCA). Neville introduced Howard to a group of wealthy and influential people who had already invested in the Ealing project. By 1903, this group was ready to invest in the [[Letchworth]] project. Two years later the link was sealed when Vivian brought in GCA architects Unwin and Parker to work on the Ealing project.

[[File:Solar eclipse 1999 4 NR.jpg|thumb|right|During a total [[solar eclipse]], the Sun's corona and [[solar prominence|prominences]] are visible to the [[naked eye]].]]

A '''corona''' (Latin, '[[crown (headgear)|crown]]') is an aura of [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] that surrounds the [[Sun]] and other [[star]]s. The Sun's corona extends millions of kilometres into outer space and is most easily seen during a total [[solar eclipse]], but it is also observable with a [[coronagraph]]. The word ''corona'' is a [[Latin language|Latin]] word meaning "crown", from the [[Ancient Greek]] κορώνη (korōnè, “garland, wreath”).

[[Spectroscopy]] measurements indicate strong [[ionization]] and plasma temperature in excess of 1,000,000 [[kelvin]]s,&lt;ref name="Aschwanden"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; much hotter than the surface of the Sun.

Light from the corona comes from three primary sources, from the same volume of space. The K-corona (K&amp;nbsp;for ''kontinuierlich'', "continuous" in German) is created by sunlight [[Thomson scattering|scattering]] off free [[electron]]s; [[Doppler broadening]] of the reflected photospheric [[absorption line]]s spreads them so greatly as to completely obscure them, giving the spectral appearance of a continuum with no absorption lines. The F-corona (F&amp;nbsp;for [[Joseph von Fraunhofer|Fraunhofer]]) is created by sunlight bouncing off dust particles, and is observable because its light contains the Fraunhofer absorption lines that are seen in raw sunlight; the F-corona extends to very high [[elongation (astronomy)|elongation]] angles from the Sun, where it is called the [[zodiacal light]]. The E-corona (E for emission) is due to spectral emission lines produced by ions that are present in the coronal plasma; it may be observed in broad or [[forbidden line|forbidden]] or hot [[spectral line|spectral emission lines]] and is the main source of information about the corona's composition.&lt;ref name="Corfield"&gt;{{cite book

== History ==
[[File:Solar eclipse 1806Jun16-Corona-Ferrer.png|thumb|Corona sketched by [[José Joaquín de Ferrer]] during the [[solar eclipse of June 16, 1806]] in [[Kinderhook (town), New York|Kinderhook, New York]].]]
In 1724, French-Italian astronomer [[Giacomo F. Maraldi]] recognized that the aura visible during a [[solar eclipse]] belongs to the [[Sun]] not to the [[Moon]]. In 1809, Spanish astronomer [[José Joaquín de Ferrer]] coined the term 'corona'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Ferrer|first=José Joaquín|date=1809|title=Observations of the eclipse of the sun June 16th 1806 made at Kinderhook in the State of New York|url=https://books.google.com/?id=DbkAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA264#v=onepage&amp;q=corona&amp;f=false|journal=Transactions of the American Philosophical Society|volume=6|pages=264|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based in his own observations of the 1806 solar eclipse at Kinderhook (New York), de Ferrer also proposed that the corona was part of the Sun and not of the Moon. English astronomer [[Norman Lockyer]] identified the first element unknown on Earth in the Sun's chromosphere, which was called [[helium]]. French astronomer [[Pierre Janssen|Jules Jenssen]] noted that the size and shape of the corona changes with the [[Solar cycle|sunspot cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mreclipse.com/Totality2/TotalityApH.html|title=Chronology of Discoveries about the Sun|last=Espenak|first=Fred|date=|website=Mr. Eclipse|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, [[Bernard Lyot]] invented the [[Coronagraph|coronograph]], which allows to see the corona without a total eclipse. In 1952, American astronomer [[Eugene Parker]] proposed that the solar corona might be heated by myriad tiny 'nanoflares', miniature brightenings resembling [[solar flares]] that would occur all over the surface of the Sun.

=== Historical theories ===
The high temperature of the Sun's corona gives it unusual [[spectroscopy|spectral]] features, which led some in the 19th century to suggest that it contained a previously unknown element, "[[coronium]]". Instead, these spectral features have since been explained by [[highly charged ion|highly ionized]] [[iron]] (Fe-XIV, or Fe&lt;sup&gt;13+&lt;/sup&gt;).  [[Bengt Edlén]], following the work of Grotrian (1939), first identified the coronal spectral lines in 1940 (observed since 1869) as transitions from low-lying [[metastable]] levels of the ground configuration of highly ionised metals (the green Fe-XIV line from Fe&lt;sup&gt;13+&lt;/sup&gt; at 5303&amp;nbsp;[[Ångström|Å]], but also the red Fe-X line from Fe&lt;sup&gt;9+&lt;/sup&gt; at 6374&amp;nbsp;Å).&lt;ref name="Aschwanden" /&gt;

== Physical features ==
[[File:Twistedflux.png|thumb|A drawing demonstrating the configuration of solar magnetic flux during the solar cycle]]

The sun's corona is much hotter (by a factor from 150 to 450) than the visible surface of the Sun: the [[photosphere]]'s average [[temperature]] is 5800 [[kelvin]]s compared to the corona's one to three million kelvins. The corona is 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; times as dense as the photosphere, and so produces about one-millionth as much visible light. The corona is separated from the photosphere by the relatively shallow [[chromosphere]]. The exact mechanism by which the corona is heated is still the subject of some debate, but likely possibilities include induction by the Sun's [[magnetic field]] and [[Magnetohydrodynamics|magnetohydrodynamic waves]] from below. The outer edges of the Sun's corona are constantly being transported away due to open magnetic flux and hence generating the [[solar wind]].

The corona is not always evenly distributed across the surface of the sun. During periods of quiet, the corona is more or less confined to the [[equator]]ial regions, with [[coronal hole]]s covering the [[Geographical pole|polar]] regions. However, during the Sun's active periods, the corona is evenly distributed over the equatorial and polar regions, though it is most prominent in areas with [[sunspot]] activity. The [[solar cycle]] spans approximately 11 years, from [[solar minimum]] to the following minimum. Since the solar magnetic field is continually wound up due to the faster rotation of mass at the sun's equator ([[differential rotation]]), sunspot activity will be more pronounced at [[solar maximum]] where the [[magnetic field]] is more twisted. Associated with sunspots are [[coronal loop]]s, loops of [[magnetic flux]], upwelling from the solar interior. The magnetic flux pushes the hotter [[photosphere]] aside, exposing the cooler plasma below, thus creating the relatively dark sun spots.

Since the corona has been photographed at high resolution in the X-ray range of the spectrum by the satellite [[Skylab]] in 1973, and then later by [[Yohkoh]] and the other following space instruments, it has been seen that the structure of the corona is quite varied and complex: different zones have been immediately classified on the coronal disc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1007/BF00152731|last1 = Vaiana|first1 = G.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; as described below.

===Active regions===
'''Active regions''' are ensembles of loop structures connecting points of opposite magnetic polarity in the photosphere, the so-called [[coronal loops]].
They generally distribute in two zones of activity, which are parallel to the solar equator. The average temperature is between two and four million kelvins, while the density goes from 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; particle per cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

[[File:Prominence (PSF).png|thumb|Illustration depicting [[solar prominences]] and [[sunspot]]s]]
Active regions involve all the phenomena directly linked to the magnetic field, which occur at different heights above the Sun's surface:&lt;ref name="Gibson"/&gt; [[sunspot]]s and [[facula]]e, occur in the photosphere, [[spicule (solar physics)|spicules]], [[Hα]] [[Solar prominence|filaments]] and [[plage (astronomy)|plages]] in the chromosphere, [[solar prominences|prominences]] in the chromosphere and transition region, and [[Solar flare|flares]] and [[coronal mass ejection]]s happen in the corona and chromosphere. If flares are very violent, they can also perturb the photosphere and generate a [[Moreton wave]]. On the contrary, quiescent prominences are large, cool dense structures which are observed as dark, "snake-like" Hα ribbons (appearing like filaments) on the solar disc. Their temperature is about 5000–8000&amp;nbsp;K, and so they are usually considered as chromospheric features.

In 2013, images from the [[High Resolution Coronal Imager]] revealed never-before-seen "magnetic braids" of plasma within the outer layers of these active regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/19400-sun-corona-secrets-suborbital-telescope.html|title=How NASA Revealed Sun's Hottest Secret in 5-Minute Spaceflight|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124115740/http://www.space.com/19400-sun-corona-secrets-suborbital-telescope.html|archivedate=2013-01-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Coronal loops====
{{main|Coronal loop}}
[[File:Traceimage.jpg|left|thumb|TRACE 171Å coronal loops]]
[[Coronal loop]]s are the basic structures of the magnetic solar corona. These loops are the closed-magnetic flux cousins of the open-magnetic flux that can be found in [[coronal hole]] (polar) regions and the [[solar wind]]. Loops of magnetic flux well-up from the solar body and fill with hot solar plasma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1086/427488|last1 = Katsukawa|first1 = Yukio|last2 = Tsuneta|first2 = Saku | title = Magnetic Properties at Footpoints of Hot and Cool Loops | journal = The Astrophysical Journal | volume = 621 |issue = 1| pages = 498–511 | year = 2005 | bibcode=2005ApJ...621..498K}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the heightened magnetic activity in these coronal loop regions, coronal loops can often be the precursor to [[solar flares]] and [[coronal mass ejection]]s (CMEs).

The Solar plasma that feed these structures is heated from under 6000 K to well over 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;K from the photosphere, through the transition region, and into the corona. Often, the solar plasma will fill these loops from one point and drain to another, called foot points ([[siphon]] flow due to a pressure difference,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1023/A:1005182503751|last1 = Betta |first1 = Rita|last2 = Orlando|first2 = Salvatore|last3 = Peres|first3 = Giovanni|last4 = Serio|first4 = Salvatore | title = On the Stability of Siphon Flows in Coronal Loops
  | journal = Space Science Reviews | volume = 87 | pages = 133–136| year = 1999|bibcode = 1999SSRv...87..133B }}&lt;/ref&gt; or asymmetric flow due to some other driver).

When the plasma rises from the foot points towards the loop top, as always occurs during the initial phase of a compact flare, it is defined as chromospheric [[evaporation]]. When the plasma rapidly cools and falls toward the photosphere, it is called chromospheric [[condensation]]. There may also be [[symmetric]] flow from both loop foot points, causing a build-up of mass in the loop structure. The plasma may cool rapidly in this region (for a thermal instability), its dark [[Solar prominence|filaments]] obvious against the solar disk or [[solar prominence|prominences]] off the [[limb darkening|Sun's limb]].

Coronal loops may have lifetimes in the order of seconds (in the case of flare events), minutes, hours or days. Where there is a balance in loop energy sources and sinks, coronal loops can last for long periods of time and are known as ''[[steady state]]'' or ''[[wikt:quiescent|quiescent]]'' coronal loops.  ([[:File:Energyfig.png|example]]).

Coronal loops are very important to our understanding of the current ''coronal heating problem''. Coronal loops are highly radiating sources of plasma and are therefore easy to observe by instruments such as ''[[TRACE]]''. An explanation of the coronal heating problem remains as these structures are being observed remotely, where many ambiguities are present (i.e. radiation contributions along the [[Line-of-sight propagation|LOS]]). ''[[In-situ]]'' measurements are required before a definitive answer can be had, but due to the high plasma temperatures in the corona, ''in-situ'' measurements are, at present, impossible. The next mission of the NASA, the [[Parker Solar Probe]] will approach the Sun very closely allowing more direct observations.

[[File:Coronal Hole Magnetic Field Lines.svg|thumb|Coronal arches connecting regions of opposite magnetic polarity (A) and the unipolar magnetic field in the coronal hole (B)]]

====Large-scale structures====
'''Large-scale structures''' are very long arcs which can cover over a quarter of the solar disk but contain plasma less dense than in the coronal loops of the active regions.

They were first detected in the June 8, 1968 flare observation during a rocket flight.&lt;ref name = Giacconi&gt;{{cite book |last = Giacconi| first = Riccardo| title = G.S. Vaiana memorial lecture in ''Proceedinds of Physics of Solar and Stellar Coronae: G.S. Vaiana Memorial Symposium''|editor=J. F. Linsky and S.Serio| pages = 3–19 | year = 1992 | publisher = Kluwer Academic Publishers-Printed in the Netherlands | isbn = 978-0-7923-2346-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The large-scale structure of the corona changes over the 11-year [[solar cycle]] and becomes particularly simple during the minimum period, when the magnetic field of the Sun is almost similar to a dipolar configuration (plus a quadrupolar component).

====Interconnections of active regions====
The '''interconnections of active regions''' are arcs connecting zones of opposite magnetic field, of different active regions. Significant variations of these structures are often seen after a flare.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Some other features of this kind are [[helmet streamer]]s—large cap-like coronal structures with long pointed peaks that usually overlie sunspots and active regions. Coronal streamers are considered to be sources of the slow [[solar wind]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi= 10.1029/2000GL000097| last= Ofman | first= Leon | title= Source regions of the slow solar wind in coronal streamers | journal= Geophysical Research Letters | volume = 27 | issue= 18 | pages= 2885–2888 |year=2000 | bibcode=2000GeoRL..27.2885O}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Filament cavities====
[[File:Crackling with Solar Flares.jpg|thumb|left|Image taken by the [[Solar Dynamics Observatory]] on Oct 16 2010. A very long filament cavity is visible across the Sun's southern hemisphere.]]

'''Filament cavities''' are zones which look dark in the X-rays and are above the regions where [[Hα]] filaments are observed in the chromosphere. They were first observed in the two 1970 rocket flights which also detected ''coronal holes''.&lt;ref name=Giacconi /&gt;

Filament cavities are cooler clouds of gases (plasma) suspended above the Sun's surface by magnetic forces. The regions of intense magnetic field look dark in images because they are empty of hot plasma. In fact, the sum of the [[magnetic pressure]] and plasma pressure must be constant everywhere on the heliosphere in order to have an equilibrium configuration: where the magnetic field is higher, the plasma must be cooler or less dense. The plasma pressure &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated by the [[state equation]] of a perfect gas  &lt;math&gt; p = n K_B T&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the [[particle number density]], &lt;math&gt;K_B&lt;/math&gt; the [[Boltzmann constant]] and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; the plasma temperature. It is evident from the equation that the plasma pressure lowers when the plasma temperature decreases with respect to the surrounding regions or when the zone of intense magnetic field empties. The same physical effect renders [[sunspot]]s apparently dark in the [[photosphere]].

====Bright points====
'''Bright points''' are small active regions found on the solar disk. X-ray bright points were first detected on April 8, 1969 during a rocket flight.&lt;ref name=Giacconi /&gt;

The fraction of the solar surface covered by bright points varies with the [[solar cycle]]. They are associated with small bipolar regions of the magnetic field. Their average temperature ranges from 1.1x10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; K to 3.4x10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; K. The variations in temperature are often correlated with changes in the X-ray emission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kariyappa, R. |author2=Deluca, E. E. |author3=Saar, S. H. |author4=Golub, L. |author5=Damé, L. |author6=Pevtsov, A. A. |author7=Varghese, B.

===Coronal holes===
{{main|Coronal hole}}

'''[[Coronal hole]]s''' are the Polar Regions which look dark in the X-rays since they do not emit much radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1088/0004-637X/719/1/131|last1 = Ito |first1 = Hiroaki|last2 = Tsuneta|first2 = Saku|last3 = Shiota|first3 = Daikou|last4 = Tokumaru|first4 = Munetoshi|last5 = Fujiki|first5 = Ken'Ichi | title = Is the Polar Region Different from the Quiet Region of the Sun?| journal = The Astrophysical Journal | volume = 719 |issue = 1 | pages = 131–142| year = 2010 | bibcode=2010ApJ...719..131I|arxiv = 1005.3667 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These are wide zones of the Sun where the magnetic field is unipolar and opens towards the interplanetary space. The high speed [[solar wind]] arises mainly from these regions.

In the UV images of the coronal holes, some small structures, similar to elongated bubbles, are often seen as they were suspended in the solar wind. These are the coronal '''plumes'''. More exactly, they are long thin streamers that project outward from the Sun's north and south poles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi=10.1051/0004-6361:20021628| last1=Del Zanna | first1=G.| last2=Bromage| first2=B.

The solar regions which are not part of active regions and coronal holes are commonly identified as the '''quiet Sun'''.

The equatorial region has a faster rotation speed than the polar zones. The result of the Sun's differential rotation is that the active regions always arise in two bands parallel to the equator and their extension increases during the periods of maximum of the [[solar cycle]], while they almost disappear during each minimum. Therefore, the quiet Sun always coincides with the equatorial zone and its surface is less active during the maximum of the solar cycle. Approaching the minimum of the solar cycle (also named butterfly cycle), the extension of the quiet Sun increases until it covers the whole disk surface excluding some bright points on the hemisphere and the poles, where there are coronal holes.

==Variability of the corona==
A portrait as diversified as the one already pointed out for the coronal features is emphasized by the analysis of the dynamics of the main structures of the corona,  which evolve in times very different among them. Studying the coronal variability in its complexity is not easy because the times of evolution of the different structures can vary considerably: from seconds to several months. The typical sizes of the regions where coronal events take place vary in the same way, as it is shown in the following table.

===Flares===
{{main|Solar flares}}
[[File:Magnificent CME Erupts on the Sun - August 31.jpg|thumb|On August 31, 2012 a long filament of solar material that had been hovering in the Sun's outer atmosphere, the corona, erupted at 4:36 p.m. EDT]]

Flares take place in active regions and are characterized by a sudden increase of the radiative flux emitted from small regions of the corona. They are very complex phenomena, visible at different wavelengths; they involve several zones of the solar atmosphere and many physical effects, thermal and not thermal, and sometimes wide reconnections of the magnetic field lines with material expulsion.

Flares are impulsive phenomena, of average duration of 15 minutes, and the most energetic events can last several hours. Flares produce a high and rapid increase of the density and temperature.

An emission in white light is only seldom observed: usually, flares are only seen at extreme UV wavelengths and into the X-rays, typical of the chromospheric and coronal emission.

In the corona, the morphology of flares, is described by observations in the UV, soft and hard X-rays, and in [[Hα]] wavelengths, and is very complex. However, two kinds of basic structures can be distinguished:
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1086/155452|last1 = Pallavicini |first1 = R.|last2 = Serio|first2 = S.|last3 = Vaiana|first3 = G. S.|title = A survey of soft X-ray limb flare images – The relation between their structure in the corona and other physical parameters
  | journal = The Astrophysical Journal  | volume = 216| page = 108| year = 1977 | bibcode=1977ApJ...216..108P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Compact flares''', when each of the two arches where the event is happening maintains its morphology: only an increase of the emission is observed without significant structural variations. The emitted energy is of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;– 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; J.
* '''Flares of long duration''', associated with eruptions of [[Solar prominence|prominence]]s, transients in white light and ''two-ribbon flares'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1038/344842a0|last1 = Golub |first1 = L.|last2 = Herant|first2 = M.|last3 = Kalata|first3 = K.|last4 = Lovas|first4 = I.|last5 = Nystrom|first5 = G.|last6 = Pardo|first6 = F.|last7 = Spiller|first7 = E.|last8 = Wilczynski|first8 = J. | title = Sub-arcsecond observations of the solar X-ray corona | journal = Nature | volume = 344 | pages = 842–844| year = 1990|bibcode = 1990Natur.344..842G | issue=6269}}&lt;/ref&gt; in this case the magnetic loops change their configuration during the event. The energies emitted during these flares are of such great proportion they can reach 10&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; J.

[[File:Solar-filament.gif|thumb|Filament erupting during a solar flare, seen at EUV wavelengths ([[TRACE]])]]

As for temporal dynamics, three different phases are generally distinguished, whose duration are not comparable. The durations of those periods depend on the range of wavelengths used to observe the event:
*'''An initial impulsive phase''', whose duration is on the order of minutes, strong emissions of energy are often observed even in the microwaves, EUV wavelengths and in the hard X-ray frequencies.
*'''A maximum phase'''
*'''A decay phase''', which can last several hours.
Sometimes also a phase preceding the flare can be observed, usually called as "pre-flare" phase.

===Transients===
{{main|Coronal mass ejection}}

Accompanying [[solar flare]]s or large [[solar prominence]]s, '''"coronal transients"''' (also called [[coronal mass ejection]]s) are sometimes released. These are enormous loops of coronal material that travel outward from the Sun at over a million kilometers per hour, containing roughly 10 times the energy of the solar flare or prominence that accompanies them. Some larger ejections can propel hundreds of millions of tons of material into [[space]] at roughly 1.5 million kilometers an hour.

==Stellar coronae==
Coronal stars are ubiquitous among the [[star]]s in the cool half of the [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram]].&lt;ref name=Gudel&gt;{{cite journal |author=Güdel M |title=X-ray astronomy of stellar coronae |journal=The Astronomy and Astrophysics Review |year=2004 |volume=12 |issue=2–3 |pages=71–237 |doi=10.1007/s00159-004-0023-2 |url=http://astronomy.sci.ege.edu.tr/~rpekunlu/GBDG/papers/XRayfromStellarCoronae.pdf |arxiv=astro-ph/0406661 |bibcode=2004A&amp;ARv..12...71G |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811230835/http://astronomy.sci.ege.edu.tr/~rpekunlu/GBDG/papers/XRayfromStellarCoronae.pdf |archivedate=2011-08-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These coronae can be detected using [[X-ray telescope]]s. Some stellar coronae, particularly in young stars, are much more luminous than the Sun's. For example, [[FK Comae Berenices]] is the prototype for the [[Variable star|FK Com]] class of [[variable star]]. These are giants of spectral types G and K with an unusually rapid rotation and signs of extreme activity. Their X-ray coronae are among the most luminous (''L''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ 10&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; erg·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; or 10&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;W) and the hottest known with dominant temperatures up to 40 MK.&lt;ref name=Gudel/&gt;

The astronomical observations planned with the [[Einstein Observatory]] by Giuseppe Vaiana and his group&lt;ref name=Vaianaetal81&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1086/158797 |author= Vaiana, G.S. |title= Results from an extensive Einstein stellar survey |journal= The Astrophysical Journal|year=1981 |volume=245 |page=163 |bibcode=1981ApJ...245..163V|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that F-, G-, K- and M-stars have chromospheres and often coronae much like our Sun.
The ''O-B stars'', which do not have surface convection zones, have a strong X-ray emission. However these stars do not have coronae, but the outer stellar envelopes emit this radiation during shocks due to thermal instabilities in rapidly moving gas blobs.
Also A-stars do not have convection zones but they do not emit at the UV and X-ray wavelengths. Thus they appear to have neither chromospheres nor coronae.

==Physics of the corona==
[[File:171879main LimbFlareJan12 lg.jpg|thumb|left|This image, taken by [[Hinode]] on 12 January 2007, reveals the filamentary nature of the corona.]]

The matter in the external part of the solar atmosphere is in the state of [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], at very high temperature (a few million kelvins) and at very low density (of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; particles/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).
According to the definition of plasma, it is a quasi-neutral ensemble of particles which exhibits a collective behaviour.

The composition is similar to that in the Sun's interior, mainly hydrogen, but with much greater ionization than that found in the photosphere. Heavier metals, such as iron, are partially ionized and have lost most of the external electrons. The ionization state of a chemical element depends strictly on the temperature and is regulated by the [[Saha equation]] in the lowest atmosphere, but by collisional equilibrium in the optically-thin corona. Historically, the presence of the spectral lines emitted from highly ionized states of iron allowed determination of the high temperature of the coronal plasma, revealing that the corona is much hotter than the internal layers of the chromosphere.

The corona behaves like a gas which is very hot but very light at the same time: the pressure in the corona is usually only 0.1 to 0.6 Pa in active regions, while on the Earth the atmospheric pressure is about 100 kPa, approximately a million times higher than on the solar surface. However it is not properly a gas, because it is made of charged particles, basically protons and electrons, moving at different velocities. Supposing that they have the same kinetic energy on average
(for the [[equipartition theorem]]), electrons have a mass roughly 1800 times smaller than protons, therefore they acquire more velocity. Metal ions are always slower. This fact has relevant physical consequences either on radiative processes (that are very different from the photospheric radiative processes), or on thermal conduction.
Furthermore, the presence of electric charges induces the generation of electric currents and high magnetic fields.
Magnetohydrodynamic waves (MHD waves) can also propagate in this plasma,&lt;ref name="Jeffrey"&gt;{{cite book
|last = Jeffrey
|first = Alan
|year =1969
|title = Magneto-hydrodynamics
|publisher = UNIVERSITY MATHEMATICAL TEXTS
}}&lt;/ref&gt; even if it is not still clear how they can be transmitted or generated in the corona.

===Radiation===
{{Main|Coronal radiative losses}}

The corona emits radiation mainly in the X-rays, observable only from space.

The plasma is transparent to its own radiation and to that one coming from below, therefore we say that it is  '''optically-thin'''. The gas, in fact, is very rarefied and the photon mean free-path overcomes by far all the other length-scales, including the typical sizes of the coronal features.

Different processes of radiation take place in the emission, due to binary collisions between plasma particles, while the interactions with the photons, coming from below; are very rare.
Because the emission is due to collisions between ions and electrons, the energy emitted from a unit volume in the time unit is proportional to the squared number of particles in a unit volume, or more exactly, to the product of the electron density and proton density.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1007/BF00873539| last = Mewe | first = R.| title = X-ray spectroscopy of stellar coronae| journal = The Astronomy and Astrophysics Review | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | page = 127 | year = 1991 | bibcode=1991A&amp;ARv...3..127M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thermal conduction===
[[File:STEREO-A first images.jpg|thumb|A mosaic of the extreme ultraviolet images taken from [[STEREO]] on December 4, 2006. These false color images show the Sun's atmospheres at a range of different temperatures. Clockwise from top left: 1 million degrees C (171 Å—blue), 1.5 million °C (195 Å—green), 60,000–80,000 °C (304 Å—red), and 2.5 million °C (286 Å—yellow).]]
[[File:STEREO-A first images slow anim.gif|thumb|[[STEREO]]&amp;nbsp;– First images as a slow animation]]

In the corona [[thermal conduction]] occurs from the external hotter atmosphere towards the inner cooler layers. Responsible for the diffusion process of the heat are the electrons, which are much lighter than ions and move faster, as explained above.

When there is a magnetic field the [[thermal conductivity]] of the plasma becomes higher in the direction which is parallel to the field lines rather than in the perpendicular direction.&lt;ref name="Spitzer"&gt;{{cite book
|last=Spitzer
|first= L.
|year=1962
|title= Physics of fully ionized gas
|publisher= Interscience tracts of physics and astronomy
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A charged particle moving in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field line is subject to the [[Lorentz force]] which is normal to the plane individuated by the velocity and the magnetic field. This force bends the path of the particle. In general, since particles also have a velocity component along the magnetic field line, the [[Lorentz force]] constrains them to bend and move along spirals around the field lines at the [[cyclotron]] frequency.

If collisions between the particles are very frequent, they are scattered in every direction. This happens in the photosphere, where the plasma carries the magnetic field in its motion. In the corona, on the contrary, the mean free-path of the electrons is of the order of kilometres and even more, so each electron can do a helicoidal motion long before being scattered after a collision. Therefore, the heat transfer is enhanced along the magnetic field lines and inhibited in the perpendicular direction.

In the direction longitudinal to the magnetic field, the [[thermal conductivity]] of the corona is&lt;ref name="Spitzer" /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
k = 20 \left(\frac{2}{\pi}\right)^{3/2}\frac{\left(k_B T \right)^{5/2}k_B}{m_e^{1/2} e^4 \ln \Lambda} \approx 1.8~10^{-10}~\frac{T^{5/2}}{\ln \Lambda}~ W m^{-1}K^{-1}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k_B&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]],
&lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature in kelvins,
&lt;math&gt;m_e&lt;/math&gt; the electron mass,
&lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; the electric charge of the electron,

&lt;math&gt; \ln \Lambda = \ln \left(12\pi n \lambda_D^3 \right) &lt;/math&gt;

the Coulomb logarithm, and

&lt;math&gt;\lambda_D = \sqrt{\frac{k_B T }{4 \pi n e^2 }}&lt;/math&gt;

the [[Debye length]] of the plasma with particle density  &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.
The Coulomb logarithm &lt;math&gt; \ln \Lambda &lt;/math&gt; is roughly 20 in the corona, with a mean temperature of 1 MK and a density of 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; particles/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and about 10 in the chromosphere, where the temperature is approximately 10kK and the particle density is of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; particles/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and in practice it can be assumed constant.

Thence, if we indicate with &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; the heat for a volume unit, expressed in J m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;, the Fourier equation of heat transfer, to be computed only along the direction &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; of the field line, becomes

&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial q}{\partial t}= 0.9~10^{-11}~ \frac{\partial^2  T^{7/2}}{\partial x ^2 }&lt;/math&gt;.

Numerical calculations have shown that the thermal conductivity of the corona is comparable to that of copper.

===Coronal seismology===
{{main|Coronal seismology}}
'''Coronal seismology''' is a new way of studying the [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] of the solar corona with the use of [[magnetohydrodynamics|magnetohydrodynamic]] (MHD) waves. Magnetohydrodynamics studies the [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] of [[electrical conduction|electrically conducting]] [[fluid]]s—in this case the fluid is the coronal plasma. Philosophically, coronal seismology is similar to the Earth's [[seismology]], the Sun's [[helioseismology]], and MHD spectroscopy of laboratory plasma devices. In all these approaches, waves of various kinds are used to probe a medium. The potential of coronal seismology in the estimation of the coronal magnetic field, density [[scale height]], [[fine structure]] and heating has been demonstrated by different research groups.

==Coronal heating problem==
{{unsolved|physics|Why is the Sun's corona so much hotter than the Sun's surface?}}
[[File:Van Gogh Sun.ogv|thumb|A new visualisation technique can provide clues to the coronal heating problem.]]

The coronal heating problem in [[solar physics]] relates to the question of why the temperature of the Sun's corona is millions of kelvins higher than that of the surface. The high temperatures require energy to be carried from the solar interior to the corona by non-thermal processes, because the [[second law of thermodynamics]] prevents heat from flowing directly from the solar photosphere (surface), which is at about 5800 K, to the much hotter corona at about 1 to 3 [[SI prefix|MK]] (parts of the corona can even reach 10 MK).

Between the photosphere and the corona, is the thin region through which the temperature increases known as the [[solar transition region|transition region]]. It ranges from only tens to hundreds of kilometers thick. Energy cannot be transferred from the cooler photosphere to the corona by conventional heat transfer as this would violate the [[second law of thermodynamics]]. An analogy of this would be a light bulb raising the temperature of the air surrounding it to something greater than its glass surface.  Hence, some other manner of energy transfer must be involved in the heating of the corona.

The amount of power required to heat the solar corona can easily be calculated as the difference between [[coronal radiative losses]] and heating by thermal conduction toward the [[chromosphere]] through the transition region. It is about 1 kilowatt for every square meter of surface area on the Sun's chromosphere, or 1/40000 of the amount of light energy that escapes the Sun.

Many coronal heating theories have been proposed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Ulmshneider |first= Peter |title = Heating of Chromospheres and Coronae in ''Space Solar Physics'', Proceedings, Orsay, France |editor = J.C. Vial |editor2 = K. Bocchialini |editor3 = P. Boumier| publisher = Springer | pages = 77–106| year = 1997| isbn= 978-3-540-64307-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; but two theories have remained as the most likely candidates: wave heating and [[magnetic reconnection]] (or [[nanoflares]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Malara, F. |author2=Velli, M. |title = Observations and Models of Coronal Heating in ''Recent Insights into the Physics of the Sun and Heliosphere: Highlights from SOHO and Other Space Missions'', Proceedings of IAU Symposium 203 |editor = Pål Brekke |editor2 = Bernhard Fleck |editor3 = Joseph B. Gurman| publisher = Astronomical Society of the Pacific | pages = 456–466| year = 2001| isbn= 978-1-58381-069-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through most of the past 50 years, neither theory has been able to account for the extreme coronal temperatures.

In 2012, high resolution (&lt;0.2″) [[soft X-ray]] imaging with the [[High Resolution Coronal Imager]] aboard a [[sounding rocket]] revealed tightly wound braids in the corona. It is hypothesized that the reconnection and unravelling of braids can act as primary sources of heating of the active solar corona to temperatures of up to 4 million kelvins. The main heat source in the quiescent corona (about 1.5 million kelvins) is assumed to originate from [[Magnetohydrodynamics|MHD waves]].&lt;ref name=Cirtain2013&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cirtain | first1 = J.

The [[NASA]] mission [[Parker Solar Probe]] is intended to approach the Sun to a distance of approximately 9.5 solar radii to investigate coronal heating and the origin of the solar wind.

===Wave heating theory===
The wave heating theory, proposed in 1949 by [[Evry Schatzman]], proposes that waves carry energy from the solar interior to the solar chromosphere and corona. The Sun is made of [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] rather than ordinary gas, so it supports several types of waves analogous to [[sound waves]] in air. The most important types of wave are [[magneto-acoustic wave]]s and [[Alfvén wave]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
  | last = Alfvén
  | first = Hannes
  | title = Magneto hydrodynamic waves, and the heating of the solar corona

  | pages = 211–219
  | year = 1947
  |bibcode = 1947MNRAS.107..211A
  | doi=10.1093/mnras/107.2.211}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magneto-acoustic waves are sound waves that have been modified by the presence of a magnetic field, and Alfvén waves are similar to [[ultra low frequency]] [[radio waves]] that have been modified by interaction with [[matter]] in the plasma. Both types of waves can be launched by the turbulence of [[Granule (solar physics)|granulation]] and [[super granulation]] at the solar photosphere, and both types of waves can carry energy for some distance through the solar atmosphere before turning into [[shock waves]] that dissipate their energy as heat.

One problem with wave heating is delivery of the heat to the appropriate place. Magneto-acoustic waves cannot carry sufficient energy upward through the chromosphere to the corona, both because of the low pressure present in the chromosphere and because they tend to be [[reflection (physics)|reflected]] back to the photosphere. Alfvén waves can carry enough energy, but do not dissipate that energy rapidly enough once they enter the corona. Waves in plasmas are notoriously difficult to understand and describe analytically, but computer simulations, carried out by Thomas Bogdan and colleagues in 2003, seem to show that Alfvén waves can transmute into other wave modes at the base of the corona, providing a pathway that can carry large amounts of energy from the photosphere through the chromosphere and transition region and finally into the corona where it dissipates it as heat.

Another problem with wave heating has been the complete absence, until the late 1990s, of any direct evidence of waves propagating through the solar corona. The first direct observation of waves propagating into and through the solar corona was made in 1997 with the [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory]] space-borne solar observatory, the first platform capable of observing the Sun in the [[extreme ultraviolet]] (EUV) for long periods of time with stable [[Photometry (astronomy)|photometry]]. Those were magneto-acoustic waves with a frequency of about 1 [[hertz|millihertz]] (mHz, corresponding to a 1,000 second wave period), that carry only about 10% of the energy required to heat the corona. Many observations exist of localized wave phenomena, such as Alfvén waves launched by solar flares, but those events are transient and cannot explain the uniform coronal heat.

It is not yet known exactly how much wave energy is available to heat the corona. Results published in 2004 using data from the [[TRACE]] spacecraft seem to indicate that there are waves in the solar atmosphere at frequencies as high as 100 mHz (10 second period). Measurements of the temperature of different [[ions]] in the solar wind with the UVCS instrument aboard [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]] give strong indirect evidence that there are waves at frequencies as high as 200&amp;nbsp;Hz, well into the range of human hearing. These waves are very difficult to detect under normal circumstances, but evidence collected during solar eclipses by teams from [[Williams College]] suggest the presences of such waves in the 1–10&amp;nbsp;Hz range.

Recently, Alfvénic motions have been found in the lower solar atmosphere &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.science20.com/news_releases/alfven_waves_our_sun_doing_magnetic_twist |title=Alfven Waves – Our Sun Is Doing The Magnetic Twist |publisher=read on Jan 6 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723053337/http://www.science20.com/news_releases/alfven_waves_our_sun_doing_magnetic_twist |archivedate=2011-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[magnetic reconnection]] theory relies on the solar magnetic field to induce electric currents in the solar corona.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The currents then collapse suddenly, releasing energy as heat and wave energy in the corona. This process is called "reconnection" because of the peculiar way that magnetic fields behave in plasma (or any electrically conductive fluid such as [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] or [[seawater]]). In a plasma, [[magnetic field lines]] are normally tied to individual pieces of matter, so that the [[topology]] of the magnetic field remains the same: if a particular north and south [[Poles of astronomical bodies#Magnetic poles|magnetic pole]] are connected by a single field line, then even if the plasma is stirred or if the magnets are moved around, that field line will continue to connect those particular poles. The connection is maintained by electric currents that are induced in the plasma. Under certain conditions, the electric currents can collapse, allowing the magnetic field to "reconnect" to other magnetic poles and release heat and wave energy in the process.

[[Magnetic reconnection]] is hypothesized to be the mechanism behind solar flares, the largest explosions in our solar system. Furthermore, the surface of the Sun is covered with millions of small magnetized regions 50–1,000&amp;nbsp;km across. These small magnetic poles are buffeted and churned by the constant granulation. The magnetic field in the solar corona must undergo nearly constant reconnection to match the motion of this "magnetic carpet", so the energy released by the reconnection is a natural candidate for the coronal heat, perhaps as a series of "microflares" that individually provide very little energy but together account for the required energy.

The idea that [[nanoflares]] might heat the corona was proposed by [[Eugene Parker]] in the 1980s but is still controversial. In particular, [[ultraviolet]] telescopes such as [[TRACE]] and [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]]/EIT can observe individual micro-flares as small brightenings in extreme ultraviolet light,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there seem to be too few of these small events to account for the energy released into the corona. The additional energy not accounted for could be made up by wave energy, or by gradual magnetic reconnection that releases energy more smoothly than micro-flares and therefore doesn't appear well in the [[TRACE]] data. Variations on the micro-flare hypothesis use other mechanisms to stress the magnetic field or to release the energy, and are a subject of active research in 2005.

===Spicules (type II)===
For decades, researchers believed [[spicule (solar physics)|spicules]] could send heat into the corona. However, following observational research in the 1980s, it was found that spicule plasma did not reach coronal temperatures, and so the theory was discounted.

As per studies performed in 2010 at the ''National Center for Atmospheric Research'' in [[Colorado]], in collaboration with the ''Lockheed Martin's Solar and Astrophysics Laboratory'' (LMSAL) and the ''Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics'' of the [[University of Oslo]], a new class of spicules (TYPE II) discovered in 2007, which travel faster (up to 100&amp;nbsp;km/s) and have shorter lifespans, can account for the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rediff.com/news/slide-show/slide-show-1-mystery-of-suns-hot-outer-atmosphere-solved/20110107.htm |title=Mystery of Sun's hot outer atmosphere 'solved' – Rediff.com News |publisher=Rediff.com |date=2011-01-07 |accessdate=2012-05-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415111049/http://www.rediff.com/news/slide-show/slide-show-1-mystery-of-suns-hot-outer-atmosphere-solved/20110107.htm |archivedate=2012-04-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These jets insert heated plasma into the Sun's outer atmosphere.

Thus, a much greater understanding of the Corona and improvement in the knowledge of the Sun's subtle influence on the Earth's upper atmosphere can be expected henceforth. The Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on NASA's recently launched Solar Dynamics Observatory and NASA's Focal Plane Package for the Solar Optical Telescope on the Japanese Hinode satellite which was used to test this hypothesis. The high spatial and temporal resolutions of the newer instruments reveal this coronal mass supply.

These observations reveal a one-to-one connection between plasma that is heated to millions of degrees and the spicules that insert this plasma into the corona.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1197738 | last1 = De Pontieu | first1 = B | last2 = McIntosh | first2 = SW | last3 = Carlsson | first3 = M | last4 = Hansteen | first4 = VH | last5 = Tarbell | first5 = TD | last6 = Boerner | first6 = P | last7 = Martinez-Sykora | first7 = J | last8 = Schrijver | first8 = CJ | last9 = Title | first9 = AM | title = The Origins of Hot Plasma in the Solar Corona | journal = Science | volume = 331| issue =  6013  | pages = 55–58| year = 2011 | pmid = 21212351|bibcode = 2011Sci...331...55D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1251">In fluid measurement, the fluid's '''flow conditions''' (or '''flowing conditions''') refer to quantities like temperature and static pressure of the metered substance.  The flowing conditions are required data in order to calculate the [[density]] of the fluid at flowing conditions.  The flowing density is in turn required in order to compensate the measured volume to quantity at [[base conditions]].

== Gas density ==

The density of a gas is calculated using the [[ideal gas law]] and an [[equations of state|equation of state]] calculation such as the one described in [[AGA Report No. 8]].

== Liquid density ==

There are broad general methodologies used to calculate the density of a liquid at specific conditions.  In order to discuss a specific methodology, one must choose a liquid that holds sufficient interest to warrant a calculation specific to it.  EOS 87.3 is a density calculation for seawater; [[American Petroleum Institute|API]] [[API Chapter 11|chapter 11]]&lt;!--chapter 11 of what?--&gt; specifies calculations pertaining to oil, fuels and natural gas liquids.

When first formulated, the hypothesis stated that [[frustration]] always precedes aggression, and aggression is the sure consequence of frustration.&lt;ref name="Dollard1939" /&gt; Two years later, however, Miller&lt;ref name="Miller1941" /&gt; and Sears&lt;ref name="Sears1941"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Non-aggressive reactions to frustration|journal=Psychological Review|volume=48|issue=4|pages=343–346|year=1941|last1=Sears|first1=Robert R.|url=http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/FrustAgg/sears.htm|doi=10.1037/h0059717}} [http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/rev/48/4/ APA]&lt;/ref&gt; re-formulated the hypothesis to suggest that while frustration creates a need to respond, some form of aggression is one possible outcome. Therefore, the re-formulated hypothesis stated that while frustration prompts a behavior that may or may not be aggressive, any aggressive behavior is the result of frustration, making frustration not sufficient, but a necessary condition for aggression.&lt;ref name="Zillmann"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zillmann|first1=Dolf|title=Hostility and Aggression|date=1979|pages=126–133|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Hillsdale, N. J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hypothesis attempts to explain why people [[scapegoating|scapegoat]].&lt;ref name="WK"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Whitley|first1=Bernard E.|last2=Kite|first2=Mary E.|title=The psychology of prejudice and discrimination|date=2009|publisher=Wadsworth|location=Belmont, CA, USA|isbn=978-0495811282|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; It attempts to give an explanation as to the cause of violence.&lt;ref name="robertnielsen21.wordpress.com"&gt;http://robertnielsen21.wordpress.com/2012/05/21/cause-of-violence/&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dollard and colleagues, frustration is the "condition which exists when a goal-response suffers interference," while aggression is defined as "an act whose goal-response is injury to an organism (or an organism surrogate)." The theory says that frustration causes aggression, but when the source of the frustration cannot be challenged, the aggression gets displaced onto an innocent target. For example, if a man is disrespected and [[humiliated]] at his work, but cannot respond to this for fear of losing his job, he may go home and take his [[anger]] and [[frustration]] out on his family. This theory is also used to explain riots and revolutions, which both are believed to be caused by poorer and more deprived sections of society who may express their bottled up frustration and anger through violence.&lt;ref name="robertnielsen21.wordpress.com" /&gt;

While some researchers criticized the hypothesis and proposed moderating factors between frustration and aggression,&lt;ref name="Pastore1952" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohen1955" /&gt; several empirical studies were able to confirm it as is.&lt;ref name="Buss"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Physical aggression in relation to different frustrations|journal=The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|last1=Buss|first1=Arnold|date=1963|volume=67|issue=1|pages=1–7|doi=10.1037/h0040505|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1964-00237-001}} [http://psycnet.apa.org/PsycARTICLES/journal/abn/67/1 APA]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kregarman&amp;Worchel"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Arbitrariness of frustration and aggression|journal=The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|last1=Kregarman|first1=John J.|last2=Worchel|first2=Philip|date=1961|volume=63|issue=1|pages=183–187|doi=10.1037/h0044667|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1962-06540-001}} [http://psycnet.apa.org/PsycARTICLES/journal/abn/63/1 APA]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, Berkowitz expanded on the hypothesis by suggesting that negative affect and personal attributions play a major role in whether frustration instigates aggressive behavior.&lt;ref name="Berkowitz1989"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Frustration-aggression hypothesis: Examination and reformulation|journal=Psychological Bulletin|last1=Berkowitz|first1=Leonard|date=1989|volume=106|issue=1|pages=59–73|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.106.1.59|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1989-36458-001}} [http://psycnet.apa.org/PsycARTICLES/journal/bul/106/1 APA]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The frustration-aggression hypothesis emerged in 1939 through the form of a monograph published by the Yale University Institute of Human Relations. The Yale psychologists behind the monograph were John Dollard, Leonard Doob, Neal Miller, O. H Mowrer, and Robert Sears.&lt;ref name="Dollard1939" /&gt; The book is based on many studies conducted by the group that touched a variety of disciplines including [[psychology]], [[anthropology]] and [[sociology]]. [[Marxism]], psychoanalysis and [[behaviorism]] were used by the Yale group throughout their research. Their work, ''Frustration and Aggression (1939)'', was soon having repercussions on the explanation of aggressive behavior theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jost|first=John|date=2017|title=Frustration-Aggression Hypothesis|url=|journal=Encyclopedia Britanica|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their theory applied to human beings, but also to animals. The book created controversy on the subject which led to more than 7 articles critiquing the new theory. The ''Psychological Review'' and the ''Reading in Social Psychology'' are two of the papers that published articles on the subject. Many social scientists disclaimed the rather strict definition of frustration reactions as well as how the frustration concept is defined in itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Archer|first=John|date=1988|title=The Behavioral Biology of Aggression|url=|journal=Great Britain: Cambridge University Press|volume=|pages=11|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1941, the Yale group modified their theory following the multiple critics and studies published by other psychologists. From there, many pioneers in the social science world modified and brought their knowledge to the original theory.&lt;ref name="Dollard1939" /&gt;

In 1989 Berkowitz published an article, ''Frustration-Aggression Hypothesis: Examination and Reformulation'', which addressed the inconsistency of empirical studies aiming to test the hypothesis, as well as its criticism. He proposed a modification to the hypothesis that would take into an account negative affect and individual attributions.&lt;ref name="Berkowitz1989" /&gt; More recently, Breuer and Elson published a comprehensive overview of the ''Frustration-Aggression Theory''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://doi.org/10.1002/9781119057574.whbva040|title=The Wiley Handbook of Violence and Aggression|last=Breuer|first=Johannes|last2=Elson|first2=Malte|publisher=American Cancer Society|pages=1–12|language=en|doi=10.1002/9781119057574.whbva040}}&lt;/ref&gt;''.'' The authors stated that despite an ample amount of empirical research that examines the link between frustration and aggressive behaviors, there is a decline in the number of studies that specifically refers to the frustration-aggression hypothesis.  Breuer and Elson propose that there is utility in using the frustration-aggression hypothesis as a theoretical foundation for aggression literature and that this theory may have novel applications for other areas such as media psychology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Reformulation and additions to the hypothesis ==
In 1941, the Yale group clarified their original statement which was “that the occurrence of aggressive behavior always presuppose the existence of frustration and, contrariwise, that the existence of frustration always lead to some form of aggression”.&lt;ref name="Dollard1939" /&gt; As it was, the second part of this hypothesis lead readers to think that frustration could only have aggression as a consequence, and it did not allow the possibility that other responses could arise and override the aggression response. The Yale group thus reformulated the hypothesis as following: “frustration produces instigation to a number of different types of response, one of which is aggression”.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=N. E.|title=I. The frustration-aggression hypothesis.|url=http://content.apa.org/journals/rev/48/4/337|journal=Psychological Review|language=en|volume=48|issue=4|pages=337–342|doi=10.1037/h0055861}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this new formulation, the researchers left more place for the idea that aggressive impulses are not the only kinds that can emerge when an individual feels frustration. Other impulses, such as fear of punishment, can outweigh or even attenuate aggression instigations until it disappears, which would explain situations where frustration does not lead to outright aggression.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In his article published in 1941, [[Gregory Bateson]] observed the frustration-aggression hypothesis under a cultural angle. According to him, culture was implicitly involved in the hypothesis itself, as it was dealing with human behaviour, which is always formed and influenced by the environment, be it social or cultural.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bateson|first=Gregory|title=IV. The frustration-aggression hypothesis and culture.|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/h0055948|journal=Psychological Review|volume=48|issue=4|pages=350–355|doi=10.1037/h0055948}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that it is easier to fit the hypothesis in people whose culture portray life as series of neutral or frustrating events that lead to satisfying ends. This would be the case for European culture and for [[Iatmul people|Iatmul]] culture. However, it is harder to apply the hypothesis to the [[Balinese people|Balinese]] culture. Indeed, Balinese children are taught to take pleasure, satisfaction, in the steps that lead to their goals, without waiting for satisfaction climaxes by completion of such goals.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Following the same line of thoughts, Arthur R. Cohen considered social norms to be an important factor in whether or not aggression will be following frustration.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Arthur R.|title=Social norms, arbitrariness of frustration, and status of the agent of frustration in the frustration-aggression hypothesis.|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/h0039947|journal=The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|language=en|volume=51|issue=2|pages=222–226|doi=10.1037/h0039947}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, he published results of a study he conducted, which included 60 female students, that showed that people were less likely to demonstrate aggression when social standards were stressed.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Moreover, he built on what Doob and Sears' study previously claimed, which is that demonstration of aggressive behavior will depend on the anticipation of punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doob|first=Leonard W.|last2=Sears|first2=Robert R.|title=Factors determining substitute behavior and the overt expression of aggression.|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/h0059513|journal=The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|language=en|volume=34|issue=3|pages=293–313|doi=10.1037/h0059513}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Cohen's result showed that people were less likely to demonstrate aggression towards the frustration agent if the latter was an authoritative figure.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He also investigated Nicholas Pastore's statement that aggression was more likely to follow in a context of a arbitrary context when compared to an non-arbitrary one, and reached the same conclusions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Justification factor ===
The frustration–aggression theory has been studied since 1939, and there have been modifications. Dill and [[Craig A. Anderson|Anderson]] conducted a study investigating whether hostile aggression differs in justified vs. unjustified frustration conditions&amp;mdash;compared to the control condition which would not induce frustration.&lt;ref name="DA"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Effects of frustration justification on hostile aggression|journal=Aggressive Behavior|last1=Dill|first1=Jody C.|last2=Anderson|first2=Craig A.|date=1995|volume=21|issue=5|pages=359–369|doi=10.1002/1098-2337(1995)21:5&lt;359::AID-AB2480210505&gt;3.0.CO;2-6|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1996-34001-001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The study task required participants to learn and make an [[origami]] bird. The experimental procedure comprised an instruction phase and a folding phase. During the instruction phase, a participant paired with a confederate was shown how to fold a bird only one time. The folding phase was timed and each subject was required to make the bird alone as quickly and as accurately as possible. In all conditions, the experimenter started presenting the instructions in a deliberately fast manner. The conditions differed on how the experimenter responded to the confederate's request to slow down. In the non-frustration control condition, the experimenter apologized and slowed down. In the unjustified frustration condition, the experimenter revealed his desire to leave as quickly as possible due to personal reasons. In the justified frustration condition, the experimenter revealed a need to clear the room as fast as possible due to the supervisor demand. The subjects were then given questionnaires on their levels of aggression as well as questionnaires about the competence of the research staff. They were told that these questionnaires would determine whether the research staff would receive financial aid, or verbal reprimands and a reduction in financial awards. The questions presented on the questionnaire were designed to reflect the research staff's competence and likability. Dill and Anderson found that participants in the unjustified frustration condition rated the research staff as less able and less likable, knowing this would affect their financial situation as graduate students. The justified frustration group rated the staff as less likable and less competent than the control group, but higher on both rating scales than the unjustified condition participants. The authors concluded that unjustified frustration leads to greater level of aggression, compared to justified frustration, which, in turn, results in higher levels of aggression compared to the non-frustration situations.&lt;ref name="DA" /&gt;

=== Reformulation by Leonard Berkowitz ===
In 1964, Leonard Berkowitz stated that it is necessary to have an aggression stimulus to make aggression take place. Then in 1974 and 1993, he remodified the frustration/aggression hypothesis into a theory that removed the importance of aggressive cues to the aggressive behavior. Which is to say, extremely angry subject will show aggression even if the aggression cue is absent. The most provocative theory introduced by Berkowitz is “aggressive cues” hypothesis, stating that for young children, previous exposure to any objects or events such as military weapon toys showing destruction effects will work as aggressive cues to increase the chances of aggression behaviors. The modification of frustration/aggression hypothesis by Berkowitz discussed that the aggressive behavior originates from internal forces such as anger, aggressive habits and external stimuli.These theories help explain the reasons why aggression is evoked but didn’t explain well the procedure of aggressive habits developments into aggressive stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social and Personality Development|last=Shaffer|first=David R|publisher=Wadsworth|year=2009|isbn=978-0-495-60038-1|location=United States|pages=290, 291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his article published in 1980, Leonard Berkowitz further discussed the relationship between the frustration and the level of aggression by adding the differentiation between the internal and external reaction to the frustration. In his first part of experiment, he found that for both of the types of frustration (legitimate and illegitimate), compared to the control group which finished the task successfully, the internal reaction measured by heart rate and rating of three 21-step bipolar scales shows great level. Nevertheless, there is no significant difference of internal reaction between legitimate and illegitimate groups. For the 2nd part of the experiment, when previous 2 groups experiencing legitimate and illegitimate frustration, encounter an innocent partner in order to perform an unrelated task, the group with previous illegitimate frustration shows greater external reaction which is openly punitive actions towards the innocent partner than the group experiencing previous legitimate frustration does.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berkowitz|first=Leonard|title=On the difference between internal and external reactions to legitimate and illegitimate frustrations: A demonstration|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/1098-2337(1981)7:2%3C83::AID-AB2480070202%3E3.0.CO;2-H|journal=Aggressive Behavior|language=en|volume=7|issue=2|doi=10.1002/1098-2337(1981)7:2%3C83::aid-ab2480070202%3E3.0.co;2-h|issn=1098-2337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neurobiological factors ==
Some studies have shown that frustrating and equally threatening events may generate feelings of aggression. This is based on the account that one of our neural systems is responsible for executing the basic responses to threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leonard|first=Berkowitz|date=1974|title=Some determinants of impulsive aggression: Role of mediated associations with reinforcemens fro aggression.|url=|journal=Psychological Review|volume=81|pages=165–176}}&lt;/ref&gt; It so happens that one of these basic responses from this system is that of aggression. The system is made up of and follows from the amygdala to the hypothalamus and finally to the periaqueductal gray matter (PAG)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blair|first=R.J|date=2010|title=Psychopathy, frustration, and reactive aggression: The role of ventromedial prefrontal cortex.|url=|journal=British Journal of Psychology|volume=101|pages=383–399|via=Wiley Online Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; In greater detail, research suggests that when one is threatened or frustrated by some stimuli, parts of our frontal cortex, that is our orbital, medial and ventrolateral frontal cortex, is activated which works in tandem with our threat response system, the amygdala-hypothalamus-PAG.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gregg|first=T.R.|date=2001|title=Britain structures and neurotransmitters regulating aggression in cats: Implications for human aggression.|url=|journal=Progress in Neuro-psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry|volume=25|pages=91–140|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; More simply put, threatening events generate more action potentials in the frontal cortex regions which then relay onto the amygdala-hypothalamus-PAG. It is in this basic threat response system where the decision on which response should take hold based on the information received from the frontal cortex regions. As mentioned, there are varying degrees and responses that could take hold within an animal in the presence of a frustrating event. This has not shown to interfere with the basic circuitry at the neuronal level and simply implies that certain stimuli generate more action potentials than others, and thus stronger responses than others respectively. In the face of this, animals portray a response hierarchy at the onset of a frustrating event. For example, when low levels of danger are perceived, the threat response system induces freezing in the animal; closer subjects of threat generate the act of fleeing from their surroundings and finally, where the source of the threat is so close that escape is no longer an option, the threat circuitry system will induce reactive aggression in the animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blanchard, R.J; Blanchard, D.C; Takahashi,L.K|first=|date=1977|title=Attack and defensive behaviour in the albino rat.|url=|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=25|pages=197–224|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; What this means is that the closer a frustrating stimulus is presented to us, the greater the chances our basic response systems will be activated and thus will give rise to certain behaviors accordingly. Furthermore, some research has shown that "individuals with elevated susceptibility for frustration [showed] greater activity within these regions [amygdala-hypothalarmus-PAG] in response to frustrating events relative to those with less susceptibility".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Siegrist, J; Menrath, I; Stocker, T; Klein, M; Kellermann, T; Shah, N.J, et al.|first=|date=2005|title=Differential brain activation according to social reward frustration|url=|journal=NeuroReport|volume=16|pages=1899–1903|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; What this research suggests is that people who get frustrated more easily than others show greater activity in the frontal cortex in connection with the amygdala-hypothalamus-PAG, the system that makes us act, given a strong enough stimulus, aggressively with reference to the studies at hand.

== Empirical studies ==
One study by Williams&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Kevin|date=2009|title=The Effects of Frustration, Violence, and Trait Hostility After Playing a Video Game|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15205430802461087|journal=Mass Communication and Society|volume=12|pages=291–310|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; examined the impact of violent content and frustration with game-play and assessed how these factors are related to aggressive personality (i.e., trait hostility).&amp;nbsp; His study collected data from 150 male college undergraduates. The study consisted of two phases. The first phase lasted 45 minutes and was in a large group setting.  During this phase participants were asked to complete a series of questionnaires that assessed their video game playing habits and aggression.  The second phase was a one-on-one session with each participant. During this phase participants played video games and were assigned to one of four conditions: 1) video game with violent content in low/nonfrustrating mode, 2) video game with violent content in frustrating mode, 3) video game with nonviolent content in low/nonfrustrating mode, and 4) video game with nonviolent content in frustration mode.  As part of the frustrating conditions, participants were informed that their scores would be compared to other participants and that higher performance would be rewarded with a $100 gift card.  Afterwards, participants completed a questionnaire similar to phase one. Ultimately, this study found that exposure to violent content influenced participants’ aggressive responses when playing video games.&amp;nbsp; He also found that frustration with gameplay was just as impactful, if not greater, on participants’ aggressive responses.&amp;nbsp; Participants who were exposed to violent content and presented frustration with game-play reported the highest scores in trait hostility.

Another study by Shackman and Pollak&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shackman|first=Jessica E.|last2=Pollak|first2=Seth D.|date=2014|title=Impact of physical maltreatment on the regulation of negative affect and aggression|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/development-and-psychopathology/article/impact-of-physical-maltreatment-on-the-regulation-of-negative-affect-and-aggression/360FA4CEFA2207FE9444264C55CDDD61|journal=Development and Psychopathology|language=en|volume=26|issue=4pt1|pages=1021–1033|doi=10.1017/s0954579414000546|issn=0954-5794|via=|pmc=4608022}}&lt;/ref&gt; tested the impact of physical maltreatment of children on their reactive aggression.  The authors tested the relationships between individual differences in social information processing, history of physical maltreatment, and child negative affect and their aggressive behaviors.  The study collected data from 50 boys through the Madison, Wisconsin Public Schools. Within this sample, 17 children had a history of physical maltreatment. Families attended two separate sessions in the laboratory.  The first session involved the children completing an emotional oddball task while having their neural responses recorded via [[event-related potential]]s (ERPs).  After this task, parents and children participated in a semistructured dyadic interaction, which involved the researchers assessment of child-directed parental hostility during a 10 minute interaction.  Families then returned to the laboratory between 2 to 20 days for the second session of the experiment.  The second session asked children to participate in a provocation task, which was designed to evoke a reactive aggression response. All families were paid $50 for their participation and were debriefed. The authors reported that physically maltreated children displayed greater negative affect and aggressive behavior compared to children that were not physically maltreated. This relationship was mediated by the children's attention to angry faces, as measured by the ERP.  Ultimately, these findings suggest that physical maltreatment of children leads to child dysregulation of their negative affect and aggression.

==Criticism==
The publication of ''Frustration and Aggression'' gave rise to criticism from several scientists, including animal [[Behaviorism|behaviorists]], psychologists, and [[Psychiatry|psychiatrists]].&lt;ref name="Berkowitz1962"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berkowitz|first1=Leonard|title=Aggression: A social psychological analysis|date=1962|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York, NY, US}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Seward, who studied rat behavior, suggested that aggression can also be caused by dominance struggles, which for him were different from frustration.&lt;ref name="Seward1945"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seward|first1=J. P.|title=Aggressive behavior in the rat. III. The role of frustration.|journal=Journal of Comparative Psychology|date=1945|volume=38|issue=4|pages=225–238|doi=10.1037/h0054548|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1946-00518-001}} [http://psycnet.apa.org/PsycARTICLES/journal/com/38/4 APA]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Evan Durbin|Durbin]] and [[John Bowlby|Bowlby]], by observing apes and children, placed reasons for breaking of a fight into three different categories. While one of the categories was frustration, the other two were classified as possession disputes and resentment of a stranger intrusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Durbin|first1=E. F. M.|last2=Bowlby|first2=J.|title=Personal aggressiveness and war.|date=1939|publisher=Columbia|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Addressing this criticism, Berkowitz suggested that the controversy around the frustration-aggression hypothesis has its roots in the lack of a common definition for frustration. He advocated that if frustration is defined as a reaction to a blocking of a [[Drive theory|drive]] or an interruption of some internal response sequence, those various reasons for aggression actually fall under the frustration umbrella.&lt;ref name="Berkowitz1962" /&gt;

Later research was focused more on refining the hypothesis, rather than on denying its correctness. In one of the earlier studies, following the publication of Dollard et al.'s book, Pastore argued&lt;ref name="Pastore1952"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pastore|first1=Nicholas|title=The role of arbitrariness in the frustration-aggression hypothesis|journal=The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|date=1952|volume=47|issue=3|pages=728–731|doi=10.1037/h0060884|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1953-03349-001}} [http://psycnet.apa.org/PsycARTICLES/journal/abn/47/3 APA]&lt;/ref&gt; that the hypothesis should distinguish between arbitrary and non-arbitrary situations, as non-arbitrary situations decrease the aggressiveness of response. In this study, participants from a sample of 131 college students were presented with the verbal description of two types of situations, arbitrary and non-arbitrary. One of the  arbitrary situation examples was being intentionally passed by the bus driver, while waiting at the correct bus stops.  A non-arbitrary situation was described in one of the examples as being passed by the bus, while it was specifically marked as heading for a garage.  The study results suggested that arbitrariness of the situation is an important factor in eliciting aggressive behavior in frustrating situations, with arbitrary situations inducing more aggression.

Building on Pastore's work, in his 1955 empirical study, Cohen confirmed&lt;ref name="Cohen1955"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=Arthur R.|title=Social norms, arbitrariness of frustration, and status of the agent of frustration in the frustration-aggression hypothesis|journal=The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|date=1955|volume=51|issue=2|pages=222–226|doi=10.1037/h0039947|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1956-04182-001}} [http://psycnet.apa.org/PsycARTICLES/journal/abn/51/2 APA]&lt;/ref&gt; that the arbitrariness of a situation affects the level of aggressiveness. However, the study also supported his hypothesis that two more factors need to be accounted for in the frustration-aggression hypothesis.  Those factors are social norms and the relationship with the frustrating agent. In his study, 60 volunteer participants were rating 14 statements on the levels of predicted aggressiveness.  Cohen found that people tend to respond less aggressively if the frustrating agent is an authority figure, rather than a friend and that people respond to frustration with less aggression if the socially accepted norms require to do so. Berkowitz addressed this criticism in his 1989 article and proposed that frustration, and ultimately aggression, is induced when individuals think they have been deliberately and wrongly kept from their goal.&lt;ref name="Berkowitz1989" /&gt;

Some sources suggest that there is little empirical support for it, even though researchers have studied it for more than sixty years.&lt;ref name="WK" /&gt; Also, this theory suggests frustrated, prejudiced individuals should act more aggressively towards out-groups they are prejudiced against, but studies have shown that they are more aggressive towards everyone.&lt;ref name="WK" /&gt;

The frustration-aggression hypothesis implies that aggression is followed or triggered by a feeling of frustration as proposed by the Yale group. Yet, other studies support contradictory claims. Certain subjects in some studies have shown to not respond aggressively to frustration given their personal, moral and educational backgrounds. For instance, the Indian culture uses the [[Satyagraha]], which means “non-violent resistance” to a trigger. [[Mahatma Gandhi]] exemplified this technique that essentially denounces the principles of the frustration-aggression theory in that he restrained himself from feeling these innate desires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vaikkam satyagraha and Gandhi.|last=Ravindran, T. K.|first=|publisher=Trichur: Sri Narayana Institute of Social and Cultural Development.|year=1975|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, the hypothesis does not take into consideration the individuality of human beings. According to Dixon and Johnson, two people can respond differently to the same frustration stimuli. For instance, some could respond aggressively while driving on the highway after being cut off by another car, whereas others with a different temperament could not react to it. However, the theory assumes that if two different people receive the same frustration stimuli, they will react similarly or equally aggressively&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The roots of individuality: A survey of human behavior genetics.|last=Dixon, L. K., &amp; Johnson, R.R.C.|first=|publisher=Brooks/Cole Pub|year=1980|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yale group’s hypothesis does not explain why aggressive behavior could be manifested in different social environments without previous provocation or feeling of frustration. However, according to Gross and Osterman, people may lose their sense of uniqueness in mass societal contexts because it tends to deindividuate them.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; For instance, individuals may behave aggressively when they are with their friends or in a big crowd (e.g. while watching a hockey game), but might not behave aggressively when they are by themselves (e.g. watching the game alone at home). When individuals are in a crowd, they are more likely to become desensitised of their own actions and less likely to take responsibility. This phenomenon is known as [[deindividuation]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4684-3659-4_10|title=Uniqueness|last=Snyder|first=C.

[[File:Bacteria Bidirectional DNA Replication.png|thumb|There is a richness of G over T in the leading strand. There is a change in GC skew sign at the origin and terminus.]]

'''GC skew''' is when the nucleotides [[Guanine]] and [[Cytosine]] are over- or under-abundant in a particular region of [[DNA]] or [[RNA]]. In equilibrium conditions (without mutational or selective pressure and with nucleotides randomly distributed within the genome) there is an equal frequency of the four DNA bases ([[Adenine]], [[Guanine]], [[Thymine]], and [[Cytosine]]) on both single strands of a DNA molecule.&lt;ref name="refname1"/&gt; However, in most [[prokaryotes]] (e.g. ''[[E. coli]]'') and some [[archaea]] (e.g. ''[[Sulfolobus]] solfataricus''), [[nucleotide]] compositions are asymmetric between the leading strand and the lagging strand: the leading strand contains more Guanine (G) and Thymine (T), whereas the lagging strand contains more Adenine (A) and Cytosine (C).&lt;ref name="refname1"/&gt; This phenomenon is referred to as '''GC''' and '''AT skew'''. It is represented mathematically as follows:&lt;ref name="refname6"/&gt;

GC skew = (G - C)/(G + C) 
 
AT skew = (A - T)/(A + T)

==Asymmetric nucleotide composition==
[[Erwin Chargaff|Erwin Chargaff's]] work in 1950 demonstrated that, in DNA, the bases guanine and cytosine were found in equal abundance, and the bases adenine and thymine were found in equal abundance. However, there was no equality between the amount of one pair versus the other.&lt;ref name="refname2"/&gt; Chargaff’s finding is referred to as Chargaff's rule or [[Chargaff|parity rule 1]].&lt;ref name="refname2"/&gt;  Three years later Watson and Crick used this fact during their derivation the structure of DNA, their [[Nucleic acid double helix|double helix model]].

A natural result of parity rule 1, at the state of equilibrium, in which there is no mutation and/or selection biases in any of the two DNA strands, is that when there is an equal substitution rate, the complementary nucleotides on each strand have equal amounts of a given base and its complement.&lt;ref name="refname3"/&gt; In other words, in each DNA strand the frequency of occurrence of T is equal to A and the frequency of occurrence of G is equal to C because the substitution rate is presumably equal. This phenomenon is referred to as [[Chargaff|parity rule 2]]. Hence, the second parity rule only exists, when there is no mutation or substitution.

Any deviation from parity rule 2 will result in asymmetric base composition that discriminates the leading from the lagging strand. This asymmetry is referred to as GC or AT skew.&lt;ref name="refname1"/&gt;

There is a richness of guanine over cytosine and thymine over adenine in the leading strand and vice versa for the lagging strand. The nucleotide composition skew spectra ranges from -1, which corresponds to G = 0 or A = 0, to +1, which corresponds to T= 0 or C = 0.&lt;ref name="refname1"/&gt; Therefore, positive GC skew represents richness of G over C and the negative GC skew represents richness of C over G. As a result, one expects to see a positive GC skew and negative AT skew in the leading strand, and a negative GC skew and a positive AT skew in the lagging strand.&lt;ref name="refname4"/&gt; GC or AT skew changes sign at the boundaries of the two [[replichore]]s, which correspond to DNA replication origin or terminus.&lt;ref name="refname1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="refname3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="refname4"/&gt; Originally, this asymmetric nucleotide composition was explained as a different mechanism used in [[DNA replication]] between the leading strand and lagging strand. DNA replication is semi-conservative and an asymmetric process itself.&lt;ref name="refname5"/&gt; This asymmetry is due the formation of the replication fork and its division into nascent leading and lagging strands. The leading strand is synthesized continuously and in juxtapose to the leading strand; the lagging strand is replicated through short fragments of polynucleotide ([[Okazaki fragments]]) in a 5' to 3' direction.&lt;ref name="refname5"/&gt;

==Calculation and GC skew plots==
There are three major approaches to calculate and graphically demonstrate GC skew and its properties.

===GC Asymmetry===
The first approach is GC and AT Asymmetry.&lt;ref name="refname1"/&gt; Jean R. Lobry was the first to illustrate the nucleotide composition asymmetry throughout the genome of three bacterium: ''[[E. coli]]'', ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'', and ''[[haemophilus influenzae]]'' by using GC and AT bias. This is the most common and traditional way to quantitatively evaluate base composition asymmetry. The original formulas at the time were not named skew, but rather deviation from [A] = [T] or [C] = [G]:

deviation from [A] = [T] as (A - T)/(A + T)

deviation from [C] = [G] as (C - G)/(C + G)

where A, T, G, and C represent the frequency of occurrence of the equivalent base in a particular sequence in a defined length. A window sliding strategy is used to calculate deviation from C through the genome. In these plots, a positive deviation from C corresponds to lagging strand and negative deviation from C corresponds to leading strand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.g-language.org/GenomeProjector/wiki/circular_genome_map_view#gc_content_and_gc_skew "Explanation of Lobry 1996 article"]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the site where the deviation sign switches corresponds to origin or terminal. The x-axis represents the chromosome locations plotted 5' to 3' and y-axis represents the deviation value. The major weakness of this method is its window-size dependent property. Therefore, choosing an adequate window size greatly affects the outcome of the plot. Other techniques should be combined with deviation in order to identify and locate the origin of the DNA replication with greater accuracy.

===CGC Skew===
The second approach is referred to as cumulative GC skew (CGC skew).&lt;ref name="refname6"/&gt; This method still uses the sliding window strategy but it takes advantage of the sum of the adjacent windows from an arbitrary start. In this scheme, the entire genome is usually plotted 5' to 3' using an arbitrary start and arbitrary strand. In the cumulative GC skew plot, the peaks corresponds to the switch points (terminus or origin).

In contrast to Lobry's earlier paper, recent implementations of GC skew flips the original definition, redefining it to be:

GC skew = (G - C)/(G + C).

With the flipped definition of GC skew, the maximum value of the cumulative skew corresponds to the terminal, and the minimum value corresponds to the origin of replication.

===Z-curve===
The final approach is the [[Z curve]].&lt;ref name="refname7"/&gt; Unlike the previous methods, this method do not uses the sliding window strategy and is thought to perform better as to finding the origin of replication.&lt;ref name="refname7"/&gt; In this method each base’s cumulative frequency with respect to the base at the beginning of the sequence is investigated. Z curve uses a three-dimensional representation with the following parameters:

Xn = (An + Gn) – (Cn + Tn)

Yn = (An + Cn) – (Gn + Tn)

Zn = (An + Tn) – (Cn + Gn)

Where n = 0, 1, 2, …, N, Xn represents the excess of purine over pyrimidine, Yn denotes excess of keto over amino, and Zn shows the relationship between the weak and strong hydrogen bonds. X and Y components can alone detect the replication origin and asymmetric composition of the strands.
A combination of these methods should be used for prediction of replication origin and terminal, in order to compensate for their weakness.

==Mechanism of GC and AT skew==
There is lack of consensus in scientific community with regard to the mechanism underlining the bias in nucleotide composition within each DNA strand. There are two major schools of thought that explain the mechanism behind the strand specific nucleotide composition in bacteria.&lt;ref name="refname3"/&gt;

The first one describes a bias and an asymmetric mutational pressure on each DNA strand during replication and transcription.&lt;ref name="refname3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="refname8"/&gt; Due to the asymmetric nature of the replication process, an unequal mutational frequency and DNA repair efficiency during the replication process can introduce more mutations in one strand as compared to the other.&lt;ref name="refname4"/&gt; Furthermore, the time used for replication between the two strands varies and may lead to asymmetric mutational pressure between leading and lagging strand.&lt;ref name="refname9"/&gt; In addition to mutations during DNA replication, transcriptional mutations can create strand specific nucleotide composition skew.&lt;ref name="refname4"/&gt; Deamination of cytosine and ultimately mutation of cytosine to thymine in one DNA strand can increase the relative number of guanine and thymine to cytosine and adenine.&lt;ref name="refname4"/&gt; In most bacteria majority of the genes are encoded in the leading strand.&lt;ref name="refname3"/&gt; For instance, the leading strand in ''Bacillus'' ''subtilis'' encodes 75% of the genes.&lt;ref name="refname4"/&gt; In addition an excess of deamination and conversion of cytosine to thymine in the coding strand compared to the non-coding strand has been reported.&lt;ref name="refname3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="refname4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="refname10"/&gt; One possible explanation is that the non-transcribed strand (coding strand) is single stranded during the transcription process; therefore, it is more vulnerable to deamination compared to the transcribed strand (non-coding strand).&lt;ref name="refname4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="refname11"/&gt; Another explanation is that the deamination repair activity during transcription does not occur on the coding strand.&lt;ref name="refname4"/&gt; Only the transcribed strand benefits from these deamination repair events.

The second school of thought describes the mechanism of GC and AT skew as resulting from differential selective pressure between the leading and lagging strands.&lt;ref name="refname3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="refname4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="refname11"/&gt; Examination of the prokaryotic genome shows a preference in third codon position for G over C and T over A.&lt;ref name="refname4"/&gt; This discrimination creates an asymmetric nucleotide composition, if the coding strand is unequally distributed between the leading and lagging strands, as in the case for bacteria. In addition, the highly transcribed genes, such as ribosomal proteins, have been shown to be located mostly on the leading strand in bacteria.&lt;ref name="refname4"/&gt; Therefore, a bias in the third-position codon choice of G over C can lead to GC skew.  Additionally, some signal sequences are rich in guanine and thymine, such as [[chi site|chi sequences]], and these sequences might have a higher frequency of occurrence in one strand compared to the other.&lt;ref name="refname3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="refname4"/&gt;

Both mutational and selective pressure can independently introduce asymmetry in DNA strands. However the combination and cumulative effect of both mechanisms is the most plausible explanation for GC and AT skew.&lt;ref name="refname3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="refname11"/&gt;

===Firmicutes===
In the majority of prokaryotes there is a richness of G over C and T over A in the leading strand and vice versa for the lagging strand. However, it has been reported that there is positive AT skew in the leading strand in some prokaryotes, such as the phylum [[Firmicutes]].&lt;ref name="refname11"/&gt; Firmicutes demonstrate an atypical AT skew. This unique nucleotide composition is thought to be due to selection pressure of adenine over thymine in the coding region.&lt;ref name="refname11"/&gt; This biased selection avoids the formation of stop codons and use of metabolically expensive amino acids.&lt;ref name="refname11"/&gt; The coding regions are mostly distributed on the leading strand;&lt;ref name="refname4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="refname8"/&gt; therefore, A over T richness is observed in Firmicutes.&lt;ref name="refname11"/&gt;

==The application of GC skew==
The GC skew is proven to be useful as the indicator of the DNA leading strand, lagging strand, replication origin, and replication terminal.&lt;ref name="refname1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="refname3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="refname4"/&gt; Most prokaryotes and archaea contain only one DNA replication origin.&lt;ref name="refname1"/&gt; The GC skew is positive and negative in the leading strand and in the lagging strand respectively; therefore, it is expected to see a switch in GC skew sign just at the point of DNA replication origin and terminus.&lt;ref name="refname3"/&gt; GC skew can also be used to study the strand biases and mechanism related to them by calculating the excess of one base over its complementary base in different milieus.&lt;ref name="refname3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="refname4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="refname11"/&gt; Method such as GC skew, CGC skew, and Z-curve are tools that can provide opportunity to better investigate the mechanism of DNA replication in different organisms.

[[File:Icexii-ru.jpg|thumb|250px|The crystal structure of ice XII]]
'''Ice XII''' is a [[metastable]], [[density|dense]], [[crystalline]] [[phase (matter)|phase]] of [[solid]] [[water]], a type of [[ice]]. Ice XII was first reported in 1996 by C. Lobban, J.L. Finney and W.F. Kuhs and, after initial caution, was properly identified in 1998.

It was first obtained by cooling [[liquid]] water to {{convert|260|K|°C °F|lk=in}} at a pressure of {{convert|0.55|GPa|lk=in|atm}}. Ice XII was discovered existing within the phase stability region of [[ice V]]. Later research showed that ice XII could be created outside that range. Pure ice XII can be created from [[ice Ih|ice I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;]] at {{convert|77|K}} by rapid compression (0.81-1.00 GPa/min) or by warming [[high density amorphous ice]] at pressures between {{convert|0.8|to|1.6|GPa|atm}}. The proton-ordered form of ice XII is [[ice XIV]].

While it is similar in density (1.29 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:87%;"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; at {{convert|127|K}}) to [[ice IV]] (also found in the [[ice V]] space) it exists as a [[tetragonal]] [[crystal]]. [[Topology|Topologically]] it is a mix of seven- and eight-membered rings, a 4-connected net (4-coordinate [[sphere]] packing)—the densest possible arrangement without [[hydrogen bond interpenetration]].

Ordinary water ice is known as [[ice Ih|ice I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;]], (in the [[Percy Williams Bridgman|Bridgman]] nomenclature). Different types of ice, from [[ice II]] to [[ice XVI]], have been created in the laboratory at different temperatures and pressures.

}} Reprinted from the "IAU Style Manual" by G.A. Wilkinson, Comm. 5, in IAU Transactions XXB (1987).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harold Rabinowitz and Suzanne Vogel, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YZCqJzffR20C&amp;pg=PA369 ''The manual of scientific style''] (Burlington, MA: Academic Press, 2009) 369.&lt;/ref&gt; The length of the Julian year is the average length of the [[year]] in the [[Julian calendar]] that was used in Western societies [[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar|until some centuries ago]], and from which the unit is named.  Nevertheless, because astronomical Julian years are measuring duration rather than designating dates, this Julian year does not correspond to years in the Julian calendar or any other calendar. Nor does it correspond to the many other ways of defining a year.

== Usage ==
The Julian year is not a unit of measurement in the [[International System of Units]] (SI), but it is recognized by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) as a non-SI unit for use in astronomy.&lt;ref name=IAU/&gt; Before 1984, both the Julian year and the mean [[tropical year]] were used by astronomers. In 1898, [[Simon Newcomb]] used both in his ''[[Newcomb's Tables of the Sun|Tables of the Sun]]'' in the form of the Julian century (36,525&amp;nbsp;days) and the "solar century" ({{val|36524.22}}&amp;nbsp;days), a rounded form of 100 mean [[tropical year]]s of {{val|365.24219879|u=days}} each according to Newcomb.&lt;ref name=Newcomb&gt;Simon Newcomb, [https://archive.org/details/06AstronomicalPapersPreparedForTheUse ''Tables of the Four Inner Planets''], vol.&amp;nbsp;6 of ''Astronomical Papers Prepared for the Use of the American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac'' (Washington, DC: 1898), pp.&amp;nbsp;10&amp;ndash;11.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the mean tropical year is not suitable as a unit of measurement because it varies from year to year by a small amount, {{val|6.14|e=-8}}&amp;nbsp;days according to Newcomb.&lt;ref name=Newcomb/&gt; In contrast, the Julian year is defined in terms of SI units so is as accurate as those units and is constant. It approximates both the [[sidereal year]] and the tropical year to about ±0.008&amp;nbsp;days.
The Julian year is the basis of the definition of the [[light-year]] as a unit of measurement of distance.&lt;ref name=units/&gt;

==Epochs==
{{Main|Epoch (astronomy)}}

In astronomy, an ''epoch'' specifies a precise moment in time.  The positions of celestial objects and events, as measured from [[Earth]], change over time, so when measuring or predicting celestial positions, the epoch to which they pertain must be specified.  A new standard epoch is chosen about every 50 years.

The standard epoch in use today is ''Julian epoch J2000.0''. It is exactly 12:00 [[Terrestrial Time|TT]] (close to but not exactly [[Greenwich Mean Time|Greenwich mean]] noon) on {{nowrap|January 1, 2000}} in the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] (''not'' Julian) calendar. ''Julian'' within its name indicates that other Julian epochs can be a number of Julian years of 365.25&amp;nbsp;days each before or after J2000.0. For example, the future epoch J2100.0 will be exactly 36,525 days (one Julian century) from J2000.0 at 12:00 TT on {{nowrap|January 1, 2100}} (the dates will still agree because the Gregorian century 2000–2100 will have the same number of days as a Julian century).

Because Julian years are not exactly the same length as years on the Gregorian calendar, astronomical epochs will diverge noticeably from the Gregorian calendar in a few hundred years. For example, in the next 1000 years, seven days will be dropped from the Gregorian calendar but not from 1000 Julian years, so J3000.0 will be {{nowrap|January 8, 3000 12:00 TT}}.

== Julian calendar distinguished ==
{{Main|Julian calendar}}

The ''Julian year'', being a uniform measure of duration, should not be confused with the variable length historical years in the Julian calendar. An astronomical Julian year is never individually numbered. Astronomers follow the same calendar conventions that are accepted in the world community: They use the [[Gregorian calendar]] for events since its introduction on {{nowrap|October 15, 1582}} (or later, depending on country), and the Julian calendar for events before that date.

== Julian day distinguished ==
{{Main|Julian day}}

A ''Julian year'' should not be confused with the ''Julian day'' (also ''Julian day number'' or ''JDN''), which is also used in astronomy.  Despite the similarity of names, there is little connection between the two. It is a way of expressing a [[calendar date|date]] as the integer number of days that have elapsed since a reference date or [[#Epochs|initial epoch]]. The Julian day uniquely specifies a date without reference to its day, month, or year in any particular calendar. A specific time within a day is specified via a decimal fraction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3426">'''Kepler de Souza Oliveira Filho''' (born 16 February 1956), also known as '''S. O. Kepler''', is a [[Brazil]]ian [[Astronomy|astronomer]] primarily known for his work on [[white dwarf]]s, [[variable star]]s, and [[magnetar]]s. A member of the [[Brazilian Academy of Sciences]], he is currently a professor at [[Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul]] (UFRGS).&lt;ref name="abc"&gt;[http://www.abc.org.br/resultado.php3?codigo=KLEPER Kepler de Souza Oliveira Filho].

==Biography==
Born in [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador, Bahia, Brazil]], Kepler obtained his Ph.D. from the [[University of Texas at Austin]] in 1984.  In January 2006, Oliveira and researchers at the University of Texas identified a pulsating white dwarf star, [[G117-B15A]], as the most stable known optical clock, more stable than an [[atomic clock]]. The team's findings were published in ''[[The Astrophysical Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press release: Astronomers find most stable optical clock in the heavens  {{!}} McDonald Observatory|url=http://mcdonaldobservatory.org/news/releases/2005/1201.html|publisher=Mcdonald Observatory|language=en|date=1 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was president of the ''Sociedade Brasileira de Astronomia'' from 2002 to 2004, and is its current vice-president (2014-2016).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sab-astro.org.br/diretoria Diretoria: Biênio 2014/2016] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208064847/http://www.sab-astro.org.br/diretoria |date=2015-12-08 }} (in Portuguese). Sociedade Brasileira de Astronomia. Retrieved 2 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; He served on the [[Southern Astrophysical Research Telescope|SOAR]] and Gemini Board for the [[Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy]], which is responsible for managing the [[Gemini Observatory]].&lt;ref name=AURA&gt;{{cite web|title=AURA Directory|url=http://www.aura-astronomy.org/about/directory.asp?directory=40#bm|publisher=[[Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy]]|accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with Antonio Nemmer Kanaan Neto and other researchers, he is the co-discoverer of [[BPM37093]], the "Diamond Star", a crystallized carbon-oxygen core pulsating white dwarf. With Detlev Koester and Gustavo Ourique, he discovered [[SDSSJ1240+6710]], an oxygen white dwarf, "Dox".&lt;ref name="Dox"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kepler|first1=S.

{{further|Edsger W. Dijkstra Prize in Distributed Computing}}
This is a list of '''important publications''' in [[Concurrent computing|concurrent]], [[Parallel computing|parallel]], and [[distributed computing]], organized by field.

Some reasons why a particular publication might be regarded as important:
*'''Topic creator''' &amp;ndash; A publication that created a new topic
*'''Breakthrough''' &amp;ndash; A publication that changed scientific knowledge significantly
*'''Influence''' &amp;ndash; A publication which has significantly influenced the world or has had a massive impact on the teaching of concurrent, parallel, or distributed computing.&lt;!-- The text of this lead section was substituted into this page from [[Template:List of publications intro]]. --&gt;&lt;!--An entry in this list should include citations for statements about the importance of the publication. Otherwise it may be challenged and removed.--&gt; 

{{TOClimit|limit=2}}

==Consensus, synchronization, and mutual exclusion==

Synchronizing concurrent processes. Achieving [[Consensus (computer science)|consensus]] in a distributed system in the presence of faulty nodes, or in a wait-free manner. [[Mutual exclusion]] in concurrent systems.

'''Dijkstra: “Solution of a problem in concurrent programming control”'''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9512">This '''list of pest-repelling plants''' includes plants believed for their ability to repel [[insect]]s, [[nematode]]s, and other [[pest (organism)|pests]]. They have been used in [[companion planting]] for [[pest control]] in [[agriculture|agricultural]] and [[garden]] situations, and in households, although most '''research indicates that there are no plants that actually deter pests'''.&lt;ref name = "Maia_2011"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maia MF, Moore SJ | title = Plant-based insect repellents: a review of their efficacy, development and testing | journal = Malaria Journal | volume = 10 Suppl 1 | issue = Suppl 1 | pages = S11 | date = March 2011 | pmid = 21411012 | pmc = 3059459 | doi = 10.1186/1475-2875-10-S1-S11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[essential oil]]s of many plants are also well known for their pest-repellent properties. Oils from the families [[Lamiaceae]] (mints), [[Poaceae]] (true grasses), and [[Pinaceae]] (pines) are common insect repellents worldwide.&lt;ref name = "Maia_2011" /&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''Mitutoyo Corporation'''|株式会社ミツトヨ|[[Kabushiki Kaisha]] Mits&lt;!--See http://web.archive.org/web/20080116182939/http://www.cic.sfu.ca/tqj/GettingRight/romajiconundrum.html--&gt;utoyo}} is a [[Japan]]ese [[multinational corporation]] specializing in measuring instruments and [[Metrology|metrological]] technology, headquartered at [[Takatsu-ku, Kawasaki|Takatsu-ku]], [[Kawasaki, Kanagawa|Kawasaki]], [[Kanagawa]].&lt;ref name=CompProf&gt;"[http://www.mitutoyo.co.jp/eng/corporate/outline/index.html Company Profile]." Mitutoyo. Retrieved on May 13, 2013. "20-1, Sakado 1-Chome, Takatsu-ku, Kawasaki-shi, Kanagawa 213-8533, Japan"&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mitutoyo''', established on October 22, 1934 was founded by Yehan Numata ([[:ja:沼田恵範|沼田 恵範]] ''Numata Ehan'') with one product, the [[micrometer]]. Mitutoyo's philosophy at that time was to make high-quality micrometers, but also to produce them in quantities that made them affordable and available to all of manufacturing. This philosophy was expanded in the next several decades to include a wider product offering focused on mechanical, dimensional gaging products, such as [[caliper]]s, [[dial indicator]]s, and other measuring tools.

As electronic technology became more widespread in the 1970s, Mitutoyo applied electronics to its line of dimensional gaging equipment to include electronic, or digital, measuring tools. During this time it also began to offer larger, more complex and more sensitive measuring instruments, including [[optical comparator]]s, form measuring equipment, and [[coordinate measuring machine]]s (CMMs). As [[statistical process control]] (SPC) was introduced, Mitutoyo led the world in the development of output gages, interfaces, data collectors and analysis software to take advantage of this new metrological science.

When the computer made its way into the field of metrology, Mitutoyo again shifted its focus to include this technology into its product offering and push measuring accuracies into the sub-micrometre range. Today, Mitutoyo presents its 6,000+ products as integrated, computer-based metrology systems, where they can be interconnected to form closed-loop-measuring networks.

Mitutoyo America Corporation was formed in 1963 and is headquartered in [[Aurora, Illinois]] (just outside [[Chicago]]). Mitutoyo America offers the full product line of precision measuring tools, instruments and equipment with a distribution network, training and education classes, software development, and service support to provide a comprehensive metrology organization.

Dr. Yehan Numata is also the founder of Bukkyo Dendo Kyokai (BDK), the Society for the Promotion of Buddhism, which sponsors the Buddhist Canon Translation Project.

The company name is usually spelled in the [[Kunrei-shiki]]/[[Nihon-shiki]] manner "Mitutoyo". Because most publications for foreigners as of 2000 require the usage of [[Hepburn romanization]], as of 2000 in the Tokyo Anglophone yellow pages the company name is rendered in the Hepburn style "Mitsutoyo".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Andrew |last=Horvat |title=Japanese Beyond Words: How to Walk and Talk Like a Native Speaker |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L8UPAAAAYAAJ |year=2000 |publisher=[[Stone Bridge Press]] |quote=Then there is the Japanese precision measuring device maker, "Mitutoyo" which also uses Nipponshiki but which when listed in the English-language Tokyo Yellow Pages ends up as Mitsutoyo because most publications written for foreigners require names to be printed in Hepburn. |isbn=978-1-880656-42-6 |page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conviction for illegal activities==
{{undue weight|date=March 2014}}
On 14 September 2006, the Tokyo District Public Prosecutor’s Office indicted four former executives of the Mitutoyo Corporation.  The company was penalized for violating the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Law prohibiting the company from exporting any products for 6 months and from exporting measuring devices for an additional 2½ years (2007–mid 2010). In addition, the Japanese court gave the former executives multi-year jail sentences (suspended) and fined Mitutoyo ¥45 million (approx. 350,000 USD). It was found that Mitutoyo created software for their products that would falsify the accuracy of the measurements taken in order to circumvent customs inspections.

There is evidence that a portion of Mitutoyo’s illegal exports helped in nuclear-weapon programs in Libya, Iran, and North Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nti.org/e_research/e3_90.html |title=The Mitutoyo Case: Will Japan Learn from its Mistakes or Repeat Them? |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331165655/http://nti.org/e_research/e3_90.html |archivedate=March 31, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wmdinsights.com/I9/I9_EA1_EvadingExport.htm |title=EVADING EXPORT CONTROLS: MITUTOYO CORPORATION AS A CASE STUDY IN DETERMINED PROLIFERATION}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, several Mitutoyo coordinate-measuring machines were allegedly sold to [[Scomi]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/25/world/asia/25iht-japan.2596170.html NY Times 25 August 2006].&lt;/ref&gt; Precision Engineering in Malaysia.

The '''Montenegrin Sports Academy''' (MSA) is a sport scientific society founded in 2003 in [[Podgorica]], Montenegro, dedicated to the collection, generation and dissemination of scientific knowledge in the multidisciplinary area of sports sciences. The spirit of this non-profit organization is to promote [[sports science]] worldwide and share the knowledge among sport scientists.

==Objective &amp; Purpose==
The MSA is the leading association of sport scientists at the Montenegrin level and practices extensive co operations with corresponding non-Montenegrin associations.
The purpose of the Academy is the promotion of [[science]] and [[research]], with special attention to [[sport science]] across Montenegro and beyond. 
Its topics include the [[motivation]], attitudes, values and responses, adaptation, performance and [[health]] aspects of people engaged in [[physical activity]] and the relation of physical activity and lifestyle to health, [[Preventive medicine|prevention]] and [[aging]]. These topics are dealt with on an interdisciplinary basis.

==Function==
The MSA is a non-profit organization. It supports Montenegrin institutions, such as the Ministry of Education and Sports and the Council of Youth and Sports, by offering scientific advice and assistance for coordinated Montenegrin, European and worldwide research projects defined by these bodies. 
Additionally it serves as the most important Montenegrin network of sport scientists from all relevant sub disciplines.

==Membership==
The MSA offers individual membership to sport and related scientists. The objective is to create a scientific Montenegrin, European and worldwide network for scientific exchange and interaction. This is strengthened by the annual Congresses and other membership benefits such as the Montenegrin Journal of Sports Science and Medicine (MJSS), Email Newsletters, etc.
The qualification for the MSA membership students is a university level degree (master’s or doctor’s degree, university examination) in the field of sport science, or an equivalent university degree in other related areas.
Members comprise scientists from all areas of sport science such as [[Physiology]], [[Sports Medicine]], [[Psychology]], Molecular Biology, [[Sociology]], [[Biochemistry]], [[Motor Control]], [[Biomechanics]], Training Science and many more.

==Congresses==
Annual Congresses have been organized since the inauguration of the MSA in 2003. The MSA Congresses are attended by sport scientists worldwide with an academic career. On average over 70% of the participants have at least a PhD or an equivalent in the field of sport science or a related discipline.
Future MSA Congresses include 2014 [[Podgorica]], comprises a range and selection of invited lecturers, as well as serious of various debates through oral and poster presentation.

In [[zoology]] and [[botany]], a '''paratype''' is a specimen of an organism that helps define what the [[scientific name]] of a [[species]] and other [[taxon]] actually represents, but it is not the [[holotype]] (and in botany is also neither an [[isotype (biology)|isotype]] nor a [[syntype]]). Often there is more than one paratype. Paratypes are usually held in museum research collections.

The exact meaning of the term ''paratype'' when it is used in zoology is not the same as the meaning when it is used in botany. In both cases however, this term is used in conjunction with ''holotype''.

== Zoology ==
In [[zoological nomenclature]], a '''paratype''' is officially defined as "Each specimen of a type series other than the [[holotype]]."&lt;ref name=zoo&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/index.jsp |title=Glossary of the ''International Code of Zoological Nomenclature''}}, ''[[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In turn, this definition relies on the definition of a "type series." A type series is the material (specimens of organisms) that was cited in the original publication of the new species or subspecies, and was not excluded from being type material by the author (this exclusion can be implicit, e.g., if an author mentions "paratypes" and then subsequently mentions "other material examined", the latter are not included in the type series), nor referred to as a variant, or only dubiously included in the taxon (e.g., a statement such as "I have before me a specimen which agrees in most respects with the remainder of the type series, though it may yet prove to be distinct" would exclude this specimen from the type series).

Thus, in a type series of five specimens, if one is the [[holotype]], the other four will be paratypes.

A paratype may originate from a different locality than the holotype. A paratype cannot become a [[lectotype]], though it is eligible (and often desirable) for designation as a [[neotype]].

The [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] (ICZN) has not always required a type specimen, but any species or subspecies newly described after the end of 1999 must have a designated holotype or [[syntype]]s.

A related term is '''allotype''', a term that indicates a specimen that exemplifies the opposite sex of the holotype,&lt;ref name=zoo/&gt; and is almost without exception designated in the original description, and, accordingly, part of the type series, and thus a paratype; in such cases, it is functionally no different from any other paratype. It has no nomenclatural standing whatsoever, and although the practice of designating an allotype is recognized by the Code, it is not a "[[name-bearing type]]" and there are no formal rules controlling how one is designated. Apart from species exhibiting strong [[sexual dimorphism]], relatively few authors take the trouble to designate such a specimen. It is not uncommon for an allotype to be a member of an entirely different species from the holotype, because of an incorrect association by the original author.

== Botany ==
In botanical nomenclature, a paratype is a specimen cited in the original description that may not have been said to be a type. It is not the holotype nor an [[isotype (biology)|isotype]] (duplicate of the holotype).

*If no types were specified, then all specimens cited are syntypes.
*If more than one specimen was cited as the type, then they are all syntypes, but specimens cited but not listed as types are paratypes.&lt;ref name=McNeill&gt;{{cite book |author1=McNeill, J. |author2=Barrie, F.R. |author3=Buck, W.R. |author4=Demoulin, V. |author5=Greuter, W. |author6=Hawksworth, D.L. |author7=Herendeen, P.S. |author8=Knapp, S. |author9=Marhold, K. |author10=Prado, J. |author11=Prud'homme Van Reine, W.F. |author12=Smith, G.F. |author13=Wiersema, J.H. |author14=Turland, N.J. |year=2012 |volume=Regnum Vegetabile 154 |title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011 |publisher=A.R.G.

Like other types, a paratype may be specified for taxa at the rank of [[family (biology)|family]] or below (Article 7).&lt;ref name=McNeill/&gt;

A paratype may be designated as a lectotype if no holotype, isotype, syntype, or isosyntype (duplicate of a syntype) is extant (Article 9.12).&lt;ref name=McNeill/&gt;

'''Physics beyond the Standard Model''' ('''BSM''') refers to the theoretical developments needed to explain the deficiencies of the [[Standard Model]], such as the [[origin of mass]], the [[strong CP problem]], [[neutrino oscillation]]s, [[baryon asymmetry|matter–antimatter asymmetry]], and the nature of [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]].&lt;ref name=sym-v2-feb-05&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another problem lies within the [[Quantum field theory|mathematical framework]] of the Standard Model itself: the Standard Model is inconsistent with that of [[general relativity]], to the point where one or both theories break down under certain conditions (for example within known [[spacetime]] [[Gravitational singularity|singularities]] like the [[Big Bang]] and [[black hole]] [[event horizons]]).

Theories that lie beyond the Standard Model include various extensions of the standard model through [[supersymmetry]], such as the [[Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model]] (MSSM) and [[Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model]] (NMSSM), and entirely novel explanations, such as [[string theory]], [[M-theory]], and [[extra dimensions]]. As these theories tend to reproduce the entirety of current phenomena, the question of which theory is the right one, or at least the "best step" towards a [[Theory of Everything]], can only be settled via experiments, and is one of the most active areas of research in both [[theoretical physics|theoretical]] and [[experimental physics]].

==Problems with the Standard Model==
Despite being the most successful theory of particle physics to date, the Standard Model is not perfect.&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A large share of the published output of theoretical physicists consists of proposals for various forms of "Beyond the Standard Model" new physics proposals that would modify the Standard Model in ways subtle enough to be consistent with existing data, yet address its imperfections materially enough to predict non-Standard Model outcomes of new experiments that can be proposed.

===Phenomena not explained===
The Standard Model is inherently an incomplete theory.  There are fundamental physical phenomena in nature that the Standard Model does not adequately explain:
* ''[[Gravity]]''. The standard model does not explain gravity. The approach of simply adding a [[graviton]] to the Standard Model does not recreate what is observed experimentally without other modifications, as yet undiscovered, to the Standard Model. Moreover, instead, the Standard Model is widely considered to be incompatible with the most successful theory of gravity to date, [[general relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 |quote=One can find thousands of statements in the literature to the effect that “general relativity and quantum mechanics are incompatible”. These are completely outdated and no longer relevant. Effective field theory shows that general relativity and quantum mechanics work together perfectly normally over a range of scales and curvatures, including those relevant for the world that we see around us. However, effective field theories are only valid over some range of scales. General relativity certainly does have problematic issues at extreme scales. There are important problems which the effective field theory does not solve because they are beyond its range of validity. However, this means that the issue of quantum gravity is not what we thought it to be. Rather than a fundamental incompatibility of quantum mechanics and gravity, we are in the more familiar situation of needing a more complete theory beyond the range of their combined applicability. The usual marriage of general relativity and quantum mechanics is fine at ordinary energies, but we now seek to uncover the modifications that must be present in more extreme conditions. This is the modern view of the problem of quantum gravity, and it represents progress over the outdated view of the past."
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Dark matter]]''. Cosmological observations tell us the standard model explains about 5% of the energy present in the universe. About 26% should be dark matter,{{cn|date=September 2018}} which would behave just like other matter, but which only interacts weakly (if at all) with the Standard Model fields. Yet, the Standard Model does not supply any fundamental particles that are good dark matter candidates.
* ''[[Dark energy]]''. The remaining 69% of universe's energy should be so called dark energy, a constant energy density for the vacuum. Attempts to explain dark energy in terms of [[vacuum energy]] of the standard model lead to a mismatch of 120 orders of magnitude.&lt;ref&gt;Krauss, L. (2009). [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ImvlS8PLIo ''A Universe from Nothing'']. AAI Conference.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Neutrino]] masses''. According to the standard model, neutrinos are massless particles. However, [[neutrino oscillation]] experiments have shown that neutrinos do have mass. Mass terms for the neutrinos can be added to the standard model by hand, but these lead to new theoretical problems. For example, the mass terms need to be extraordinarily small and it is not clear if the neutrino masses would arise in the same way that the masses of other fundamental particles do in the Standard Model.
* ''[[Baryon asymmetry|Matter–antimatter asymmetry]]''. The universe is made out of mostly matter. However, the standard model predicts that matter and antimatter should have been created in (almost) equal amounts if the initial conditions of the universe did not involve disproportionate matter relative to antimatter. Yet, no mechanism sufficient to explain this asymmetry exists in the Standard Model.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

==== Experimental results not explained ====
No experimental result is accepted as definitively contradicting the Standard Model at the five [[standard deviation|sigma]] level, widely considered to be the threshold of a discovery in particle physics. But because every experiment contains some degree of statistical and systemic uncertainty, and the theoretical predictions themselves are also almost never calculated exactly and are subject to uncertainties in measurements of the fundamental constants of the Standard Model (some of which are tiny and others of which are substantial), it is mathematically expected that some of the hundreds of experimental tests of the Standard Model will deviate to some extent from it, even if there were no new physics to be discovered.

At any given time there are a number of experimental results that are significantly different from the Standard Model expectation, although many of these have been found to be statistical flukes or experimental errors as more data has been collected. On the other hand, any physics beyond the Standard Model would necessarily first manifest experimentally as a statistically significant difference between an experiment and the theoretical prediction.

In each case, physicists seek to determine if a result is a mere statistical fluke or experimental error on the one hand, or a sign of new physics on the other. More statistically significant results cannot be mere statistical flukes but can still result from experimental error or inaccurate estimates of experimental precision. Frequently, experiments are tailored to be more sensitive to experimental results that would distinguish the Standard Model from theoretical alternatives.

Some of the most notable examples include the following:

* ''[[Proton radius puzzle]]'' – the Standard Model makes precise theoretical predictions regarding the atomic radius size of ordinary hydrogen (a proton-electron system) and that of muonic hydrogen (a proton-muon system in which a [[muon]] is behaving as a heavy variant of an electron). However, the measured atomic radius of muonic hydrogen differs significantly from that of the radius predicted by the Standard Model using existing physical constant measurements by what appears to be as many as seven standard deviations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Randolf Pohl |author2=Ronald Gilman |author3=Gerald A. Miller |author4=Krzysztof Pachucki |year=2013 |title=Muonic hydrogen and the proton radius puzzle |arxiv=1301.0905 |journal=[[Annu. Rev. Nucl. Part.

The latter is composed from the electronic hydrogenate atom value of 0.8758(77) fm and from a similar value with larger uncertainties determined by electron scattering.|bibcode = 2013ARNPS..63..175P |pages=175–204}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Doubts about the accuracy of the error estimates in earlier experiments, which are still within 4% of each other in measuring a truly tiny distance, and a lack of a well motivated theory that could explain the discrepancy, have caused physicists to be hesitant to describe these results as contradicting the Standard Model despite the apparent statistical significance of the result and a lack of any clearly identified possible source of experimental error in the results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Proton Radius Puzzle |arxiv=1502.05314 |bibcode=2015PrPNP..82...59C |doi= 10.1016/j.ppnp.2015.01.002 |volume=82 |first=Carl E. |last=Carlson |date=May 2015 |journal=Progress in Particle and Nuclear Physics |pages=59–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Anomalous magnetic dipole moment]] of muon'' – the experimentally measured value of muon's anomalous magnetic dipole moment (muon "g&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2") is significantly different from the Standard Model prediction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|arxiv=1311.2198|title=The Muon (g&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;2) Theory Value: Present and Future

* ''B meson decay etc.'' – results from a BaBar experiment may suggest a surplus over Standard Model predictions of a type of particle decay ({{nowrap|{{overline|B}} → D&lt;sup&gt;(*)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt;τ&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt;{{overline|ν}}&lt;sub&gt;τ&lt;/sub&gt;}}). In this, an electron and positron collide, resulting in a [[B meson]] and an antimatter {{overline|B}} meson, which then decays into a [[D meson]] and a [[tau lepton]] as well as a [[tau antineutrino]]. While the level of certainty of the excess (3.4&amp;nbsp;sigma in statistical language) is not enough to claim a break from the Standard Model, the results are a potential sign of something amiss and are likely to affect existing theories, including those attempting to deduce the properties of Higgs bosons.&lt;ref name="BaBar Data Suggests Possible Flaws in the Standard Model June 18 19, 2012"&gt;

===Theoretical predictions not observed===
Observation at [[particle collider]]s of all of the fundamental particles predicted by the Standard Model has been confirmed.  The [[Higgs boson]] is predicted by the Standard Model's explanation of the [[Higgs mechanism]], which describes how the weak SU(2) gauge symmetry is broken and how fundamental particles obtain mass; it was the last particle predicted by the Standard Model to be observed. On July 4, 2012, [[CERN]] scientists using the [[Large Hadron Collider]] announced the discovery of a particle consistent with the Higgs boson, with a mass of about {{val|126|ul=GeV/c2}}. A Higgs boson was confirmed to exist on March 14, 2013, although efforts to confirm that it has all of the properties predicted by the Standard Model are ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;

A few [[hadron]]s (i.e. composite particles made of [[quark]]s) whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model, which can be produced only at very high energies in very low frequencies have not yet been definitively observed, and "[[glueball]]s"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Marco Frasca |title=What is a Glueball? |date=March 31, 2009 |url=http://marcofrasca.wordpress.com/2009/03/31/what-is-a-glueball-2/ |website=The Gauge Connection}}&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e. composite particles made of [[gluon]]s) have also not yet been definitively observed. Some very low frequency particle decays predicted by the Standard Model have also not yet been definitively observed because insufficient data is available to make a statistically significant observation.

===Theoretical problems===
Some features of the standard model are added in an [[ad hoc]] way. These are not problems per se (i.e. the theory works fine with these ad hoc features), but they imply a lack of understanding.{{cn|date=September 2018}} These ad hoc features have motivated theorists to look for more fundamental theories with fewer parameters. Some of the ad hoc features are:
* ''[[Hierarchy problem]]''&amp;nbsp;– the standard model introduces particle masses through a process known as [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]] caused by the [[Higgs mechanism|Higgs]] field. Within the standard model, the mass of the Higgs gets some very large quantum corrections due to the presence of [[virtual particle]]s (mostly virtual [[top quark]]s). These corrections are much larger than the actual mass of the Higgs. This means that the [[bare mass]] parameter of the Higgs in the standard model must be [[fine-tuning|fine tuned]] in such a way that almost completely cancels the quantum corrections.&lt;ref name="Hierarchy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/ |title=The Hierarchy Problem |website=Of Particular Significance |date=August 14, 2011 |accessdate=2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This level of fine-tuning is deemed [[naturalness (physics)|unnatural]] by many theorists.{{who?|date=September 2018}}
* ''Number of parameters''&amp;nbsp;– the standard model depends on 19 numerical parameters. Their values are known from experiment, but the origin of the values is unknown. Some theorists{{who?|date=September 2018}} have tried to find relations between different parameters, for example, between the masses of particles in different [[generation (physics)|generations]].or calculating particle masses, such as in [[Physics_applications_of_asymptotically_safe_gravity#The_mass_of_the_Higgs_boson | asymptotic safety]] scenarios. {{cn|date=September 2018}}
* ''[[Quantum triviality]]''&amp;nbsp;– suggests that it may not be possible to create a consistent quantum field theory involving elementary scalar Higgs particles.  This is sometimes called the [[Landau pole]] problem.&lt;ref name="TrivPurs"&gt;{{cite journal| authorlink=David J E Callaway | first=D. J.

* ''[[Strong CP problem]]''&amp;nbsp;– theoretically it can be argued that the standard model should contain a term that breaks [[CP symmetry]]—relating matter to [[antimatter]]—in the [[strong interaction]] sector. Experimentally, however, no such violation has been found, implying that the coefficient of this term is very close to zero.&lt;ref name= "Strong CP problem"&gt;{{cite conference | first = Thomas | last = Mannel | authorlink = | title = Theory and Phenomenology of CP Violation | booktitle = Nuclear Physics B, vol. 167 | volume = 167 | pages = 170–174 | publisher = Elsevier | conference = The 7th International Conference on Hyperons, Charm And Beauty Hadrons (BEACH 2006) | date = 2–8 July 2006 | location = Lancaster | url = https://indico.cern.ch/event/427023/session/6/contribution/43/attachments/912026/1288208/Lancester-Mannel-Proc.pdf

==Grand unified theories==
{{Main|Grand Unified Theory}}
The standard model has three [[gauge symmetry|gauge symmetries]]; the [[color charge|colour]] [[SU(3)]], the [[weak isospin]] [[SU(2)]], and the [[weak hypercharge]] [[U(1)]] symmetry, corresponding to the three fundamental forces. Due to [[renormalization]] the coupling constants of each of these symmetries vary with the energy at which they are measured. Around {{val|e=16|u=GeV}} these couplings become approximately equal. This has led to speculation that above this energy the three gauge symmetries of the standard model are unified in one single gauge symmetry with a [[simple group]] gauge group, and just one coupling constant. Below this energy the symmetry is [[spontaneous symmetry breaking|spontaneously broken]] to the standard model symmetries.&lt;ref&gt;

Theories that unify the standard model symmetries in this way are called [[Grand Unified Theories]] (or GUTs), and the energy scale at which the unified symmetry is broken is called the GUT scale. Generically, grand unified theories predict the creation of [[magnetic monopole]]s in the early universe,&lt;ref&gt;

==Supersymmetry==
{{Main|Supersymmetry}}

Supersymmetry extends the Standard Model by adding another class of symmetries to the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]]. These symmetries exchange [[fermion]]ic particles with [[boson]]ic ones. Such a symmetry predicts the existence of ''supersymmetric particles'', abbreviated as ''[[superpartner|sparticle]]s'', which include the [[slepton]]s, [[squark]]s, [[neutralino]]s and [[chargino]]s. Each particle in the Standard Model would have a superpartner whose [[spin (physics)|spin]] differs by 1/2 from the ordinary particle. Due to the [[supersymmetry breaking|breaking of supersymmetry]], the sparticles are much heavier than their ordinary counterparts; they are so heavy that existing [[particle collider]]s may not be powerful enough to produce them.

==Neutrinos==
In the standard model, [[neutrino]]s have exactly zero mass. This is a consequence of the standard model containing only [[chirality (physics)|left-handed]] neutrinos. With no suitable right-handed partner, it is impossible to add a renormalizable mass term to the standard model.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Measurements however indicated that neutrinos [[neutrino oscillations|spontaneously change flavour]], which implies that neutrinos have a mass. These measurements only give the mass differences between the different flavours. The best constraint on the absolute mass of the neutrinos comes from precision measurements of [[tritium]] decay, providing an upper limit 2&amp;nbsp;eV, which makes them at least five orders of magnitude lighter than the other particles in the standard model.&lt;ref&gt;

One approach to add masses to the neutrinos, the so-called [[seesaw mechanism]], is to add right-handed neutrinos and have these couple to left-handed neutrinos with a [[Dirac mass]] term. The right-handed neutrinos have to be [[sterile neutrino|sterile]], meaning that they do not participate in any of the standard model interactions. Because they have no charges, the right-handed neutrinos can act as their own anti-particles, and have a [[Majorana mass]] term. Like the other Dirac masses in the standard model, the neutrino Dirac mass is expected to be generated through the Higgs mechanism, and is therefore unpredictable. The standard model fermion masses differ by many orders of magnitude; the Dirac neutrino mass has at least the same uncertainty. On the other hand, the Majorana mass for the right-handed neutrinos does not arise from the Higgs mechanism, and is therefore expected to be tied to some energy scale of new physics beyond the standard model, for example the Planck scale.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, any process involving right-handed neutrinos will be suppressed at low energies. The correction due to these suppressed processes effectively gives the left-handed neutrinos a mass that is inversely proportional to the right-handed Majorana mass, a mechanism known as the see-saw.&lt;ref name="TASI"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of heavy right-handed neutrinos thereby explains both the small mass of the left-handed neutrinos and the absence of the right-handed neutrinos in observations.
However, due to the uncertainty in the Dirac neutrino masses, the right-handed neutrino masses can lie anywhere. For example, they could be as light as keV and be [[dark matter]],&lt;ref&gt;

The mass terms mix neutrinos of different generations. This mixing is parameterized by the [[PMNS matrix]], which is the neutrino analogue of the [[CKM matrix|CKM quark mixing matrix]]. Unlike the quark mixing, which is almost minimal, the mixing of the neutrinos appears to be almost maximal. This has led to various speculations of symmetries between the various generations that could explain the mixing patterns.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mixing matrix could also contain several complex phases that break CP invariance, although there has been no experimental probe of these. These phases could potentially create a surplus of leptons over anti-leptons in the early universe, a process known as [[leptogenesis (physics)|leptogenesis]]. This asymmetry could then at a later stage be converted in an excess of baryons over anti-baryons, and explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe.&lt;ref name="Buchmller" /&gt;

The light neutrinos are disfavored as an explanation for the observation of dark matter, due to considerations of large-scale structure formation in the early universe. Simulations of [[structure formation]] show that they are too hot—i.e. their kinetic energy is large compared to their mass—while formation of structures similar to the galaxies in our universe requires [[cold dark matter]]. The simulations show that neutrinos can at best explain a few percent of the missing dark matter. However, the heavy sterile right-handed neutrinos ''are'' a possible candidate for a dark matter [[weakly interacting massive particle|WIMP]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Preon models==

Several [[preon]] models have been proposed to address the unsolved problem concerning the fact that there are three generations of quarks and leptons. Preon models generally postulate some additional new particles which are further postulated to be able to combine to form the quarks and leptons of the standard model. One of the earliest preon models was the [[Rishon model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harari |first=H. |year=1979 |title=A Schematic Model of Quarks and Leptons |journal=[[Physics Letters B]] |volume=86 |issue=1 |pages=83–86|bibcode = 1979PhLB...86...83H |doi = 10.1016/0370-2693(79)90626-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shupe |first=M.

To date, no preon model is widely accepted or fully verified.

==Theories of everything==

===Theory of everything===
{{Main|Theory of everything}}
Theoretical physics continues to strive toward a theory of everything, a theory that fully explains and links together all known physical phenomena, and predicts the outcome of any experiment that could be carried out in principle.  In practical terms the immediate goal in this regard is to develop a theory which would unify the Standard Model with [[General Relativity]] in a theory of [[quantum gravity]].  Additional features, such as overcoming conceptual flaws in either theory or accurate prediction of particle masses, would be desired.
The challenges in putting together such a theory are not just conceptual - they include the experimental aspects of the very high energies needed to probe exotic realms.

Several notable attempts in this direction are [[supersymmetry]], string theory, and [[loop quantum gravity]].

===String theory===
{{Main|String theory}}
Extensions, revisions, replacements, and reorganizations of the Standard Model exist in attempt to correct for these and other issues. [[String theory]] is one such reinvention, and many theoretical physicists think that such theories are the next theoretical step toward a true [[Theory of Everything]]. Theories of [[quantum gravity]] such as [[loop quantum gravity]] and others are thought by some to be promising candidates to the mathematical unification of quantum field theory and general relativity, requiring less drastic changes to existing theories.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the numerous variants of string theory, [[M-theory]], whose mathematical existence was first proposed at a String Conference in 1995, is believed by many to be a proper [[Theory of Everything|"ToE"]] candidate, notably by physicists [[Brian Greene]] and [[Stephen Hawking]]. Though a full mathematical description is not yet known, solutions to the theory exist for specific cases.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Planet Earth 1986 book cover.jpg|200px|right|thumb|The cover of ''Planet Earth'', the companion book to the series by [[Jonathan Weiner]] published in 1986.]]
'''''Planet Earth''''' is a seven-episode 1986 [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] television documentary series focusing on the [[Earth]], narrated by [[Richard Kiley]].

''Planet Earth'' explores [[geoscience]] and how discoveries of the early and mid-1980s were revolutionizing mankind's understanding of the Earth's past, present, and future. It also highlights scientific discoveries not yet fully understood and still under study in the mid-1980s. The series explores the Earth's origins, history, and structure; the forces that operate continually to alter its surface; its oceans; its climate; its [[natural resources]]; its [[biosphere]] and the effects of life on the physical world; its relationship to the [[Sun]] and other bodies in the [[solar system]]; and its possible future in the face of pressures the growing human population places on the natural world.&lt;ref name="margulies01221986"&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1986-01-22/entertainment/ca-31688_1_planet-earth Margulies, Lee, "TV Review : PBS 'Earth' Series Off To An Earthshaking Start," ''Los Angeles Times'', January 22, 1986.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[BBC]] used the same title for its [[Planet Earth (2006 TV series)|2006 series]], but the two series are completely unrelated and quite different in focus and content.

==Production==
Produced by [[WQED (TV)|WQED]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], in association with the [[National Academy of Sciences]] as the centerpiece for a college-credit telecourse,&lt;ref name="margulies01221986"/&gt; ''Planet Earth'' was filmed over a period of four years on all seven continents and from the ocean bottom to earth orbit.&lt;ref name="margulies01221986"/&gt; The [[Annenberg Foundation|Annenberg/CPB Project]] and [[International Business Machines|IBM]] funded production of the series.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1640066/companycredits?ref_=ttrel_sa_4 imdb.com Planet Earth (1886) Company Credits]&lt;/ref&gt; It enjoyed success in its original run, airing weekly on Thursday evenings on PBS from January 22 to March 5, 1986.&lt;ref name="tvguideoverview"&gt;[http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/planet-earth/episodes/203794 tvguide.com ''Planet Earth'' Episode List]&lt;/ref&gt;

A companion book to the series written by [[Jonathan Weiner]], also entitled ''Planet Earth'', was published in 1986 by [[Bantam Books]]. Both the series and the companion book sometimes are marketed as ''Our Planet Earth'' in an attempt to avoid confusion with the 2006 [[BBC]] series ''[[Planet Earth (2006 TV series)|Planet Earth]]''.

Some footage shot for ''Planet Earth'' later also was used in the 1992 PBS series ''[[Earth Revealed]]''.

==Critical reception and awards==
In January 1986, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' critic Lee Margulies praised ''Planet Earth'' as "serious, but not dry" and credited it for its vivid filming of natural scenery, use of computer graphics, and achievement of depicting ongoing scientific research of the early and mid-1980s as "challenging, interesting, and worthwhile."&lt;ref name="margulies01221986"/&gt;

''Planet Earth'' was the co-winner of the 1985-1986 [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Informational Series or Special, sharing it with ''Laurence Olivier - A Life'', a multi-part biography of [[Laurence Olivier]] that aired on the PBS series ''[[Great Performances]]'' that season.&lt;ref name="tvguideoverview"/&gt;

==Episode list==
#'''"The Living Machine"''' (aired '''January 22, 1986''') &amp;ndash; The episode discusses [[plate tectonics]] and [[geologic time]], highlighting the work of [[James Hutton]], [[Alfred Wegener]], [[Harry Hammond Hess|Harry Hess]], [[Allan V. Cox]], [[Brent Dalrymple]], [[Frederick Vine]], and [[Drummond Matthews]], and discussing how [[Geology|geologists]] study layers of rock to read billions of years of the Earth's history. Topics covered include [[radiometric dating]], [[seafloor spreading]], [[Geomagnetic reversal|magnetic field reversals]], [[earthquake]]s, [[volcanism]], [[subduction]], and [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspot]]s, how [[continent]]s grow through [[Accretion (geology)|accretion]], how [[Geophysics|geophysicists]] study the interior of the Earth and what they have discovered, the theory of "microplate tectonics," how computer simulations have recreated the effects of [[continental drift]] on the world's [[geography]] over time from the prehistoric supercontinent [[Pangaea]] to the world of today, and how plate tectonics may have shaped the [[Animal migration|migratory behaviors]] of some animals.

The '''Regional Science Association International''' ('''RSAI''') is a cluster of scholarly societies whose members engage in [[regional science]].

==Origins==
In the late 1940s and the early 1950s, the economist [[Walter Isard]] worked to draw together a group of academics interested in analyzing regional (i.e., sub-national) development. These academics were drawn from a number of disciplines: economics, geography, city planning, political science and rural sociology. Naming their new approach ''regional science'', they envisioned it as an interdisciplinary effort, one that would require unique theoretical concepts, methodological tools, and data. Because their effort was interdisciplinary, no existing academic organization brought the participants together; they therefore created their own organization, the ''Regional Science Association'', which first met in December 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Boyce 2003: 32-34&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1961, the RSA had 960 members, and its first local "section", which organized conferences for regional scientists located in the western United States. The next section to form (in 1963) was in Japan, followed by sections throughout Europe, as well as in India, Argentina, and Brazil. In 1969, the Western section and the Japan section began to cooperate in holding a biennial ''Pacific Rim'' international conference.&lt;ref&gt;Boyce 2003: 35&lt;/ref&gt;

Gradually issues of coordination among the various sections were worked out, resulting in much the present structure by 1990. The ''Regional Science Association International'' (RSAI) now functions as the umbrella organization for three other organizations: the ''Pacific Regional Science Conference Organization'', the ''North American Regional Science Council'', and the ''European Regional Science Association''. Each of these serve as the umbrella organization for a number of other organizations, as seen in the next section.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9766">{{Hatnote|This article is about the UK registered charity and should not be confused with [[UK Research Councils]]}}
The '''Research Council for Complementary Medicine (RCCM)''' is a [[charitable organisation]] (UK Registered Charity Number 1146724) founded in 1983 to develop and promote good quality [[research]] into [[alternative and complementary medicine]] ('''CAM''') and enhance [[evidence-based medicine]] in this area.

The RCCM works with the complementary therapy professions and CAM researchers to promote safe and effective integrative and personalised medicine, and to promote the development of high quality research and evidence in the UK into complementary and alternative medicine.

As the burden of complex chronic disease increases more people are turning to alternative and complementary medicine (CAM) and need guidance in making their healthcare choices. CAM is used by at least a quarter of the population of the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop FL, Lewith GT. Who Uses CAM? A Narrative Review of Demographic Characteristics and Health Factors Associated with CAM Use.  Evid Based Complement Alternat Med. 2008 Mar 13. downloads.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2010/102626.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas K, Coleman P. Use of complementary or alternative medicine in a general population in Great Britain. Results from the National Omnibus survey. J Public Health (Oxf). 2004 Jun;26(2):152-7.&lt;/ref&gt; The research evidence base is limited at present. The ever increasing cost of chronic disease will require government and society to make decisions on the cost-effectiveness of the available health care options.  Such decisions are best informed by evidence and currently accepted standards of care.

A greater evidence base for CAM should facilitate wider availability of access to safe and effective complementary therapies within the [[National Health Service]] and across the UK, in order to help in preventing [[disease]] and improving[[health]].

The House of Lords Science and Technology Select Committee in 2000 published a report on CAM which emphasised the need for improved regulation and increased research into CAM therapies.&lt;ref&gt;House of Lords Science and Technology Select Committee. Sixth Report: Complementary and Alternative Medicine, The Stationery Office, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; While regulation of the main CAM professions has made considerable progress, a paucity of funding has limited the development of CAM research.

==History==
The RCCM was co-founded in 1983 by a medical doctor Dr Richard Tonkins MD FRCP and a lay businessman, Mr Harold Wicks. During the 1980s, the focus of RCCM activity was on encouraging and publishing research projects, and on the exploration of appropriate research methodologies. A scientific journal was established, Complementary Medical Research ({{ISSN|0268-4055}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/complementary-medical-research/oclc/20818218 |title=Complementary medical research. (Journal, magazine, 1986) |website=WorldCat.org |date=2016-05-10 |accessdate=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;). A University Fellowship to explore CAM was established in partnership with the Medical Research Council and the University of Glasgow.&lt;ref&gt;Reilly D, Taylor MA, Beattie NG, Campbell JH, McSharry C, Aitchison TC, Carter R, Stevenson RD. Is evidence for homoeopathy reproducible? [[The Lancet|Lancet]]. 1994 Dec10;344(8937):1601-6&lt;/ref&gt; A series of annual conferences on research methodology were organised.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

During the 1990s, the RCCM focus was on undergraduate medical education and the inclusion of a CAM module as a part of the curricula for medical education; Dr Catherine Zollman became Director of the RCCM’s Medical Education Service and established a register of GPs with an interest in CAM. An RCCM research project was undertaken on the use of CAM by women with breast cancer, commissioned by South Thames Regional Health Authority&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rees | first1 = RW | last2 = Feigel | first2 = I | last3 = Vickers | first3 = A | last4 = Zollman | first4 = C | last5 = McGurk | first5 = R | last6 = Smith | first6 = C | date = Jul 2000 | title = Prevalence of complementary therapy use by women with breast cancer.

After 2000, the RCCM was commissioned to undertake and completed some very large projects in partnership with universities, including the CAMEOL project for the Department of Health to assess CAM interventions in NHS priority areas by detailed review and critical appraisal of published research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pilkington | first1 = K | last2 = Rampes | first2 = H | last3 = Richardson | first3 = J | date = Nov 2006 | title = Complementary medicine for depression | url = | journal = Expert Rev Neurother | volume = 6 | issue = 11| pages = 1741–51 | doi=10.1586/14737175.6.11.1741}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pilkington | first1 = K | last2 = Kirkwood | first2 = G | last3 = Rampes | first3 = H | last4 = Fisher | first4 = P | last5 = Richardson | first5 = J | date = Jul 2006 | title = Homeopathy for anxiety and anxiety disorders: a systematic review of the research | url = | journal = Homeopathy | volume = 95 | issue = 3| pages = 151–62 | doi=10.1016/j.homp.2006.05.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pilkington | first1 = K | last2 = Kirkwood | first2 = G | last3 = Rampes | first3 = H | last4 = Cummings | first4 = M | last5 = Richardson | first5 = J | date = Jun 2007 | title = Acupuncture for anxiety and anxiety disorders--a systematic literature review | url = | journal = [[Acupuncture in Medicine|Acupunct Med]] | volume = 25 | issue = 1–2| pages = 1–10 | doi=10.1136/aim.25.1-2.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current activity==
The current activities of RCCM are directed towards supporting the CAM professions in research and evidence-based practice, through increasing engagement between the professional bodies, the regulators, and the research community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robinson | first1 = N | year = 2009 | title = Bridging the gap between evidence and practice. The Research Council for Complementary Medicine launches a new strategy | url = | journal = Complementary Therapies in Medicine | volume = 17 | issue = | page = 328 | doi=10.1016/j.ctim.2009.08.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CAM professions in the UK are evolving and maturating. Regulation is well developed, with statutory regulation of [[osteopathy]] and [[chiropractic]] in place, and [[herbal medicine]], [[acupuncture]] and [[traditional Chinese medicine]] moving towards statutory regulation. Other therapies such as [[massage]] and [[naturopathy]] have established voluntary regulation under the Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council ([[CNHC]]) and others are moving towards this goal.

Funding from the government for research to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of CAM, similar to that in the USA where a research funding council [[NCCAM]] provides substantial research funding specifically for CAM research, would enable the evidence base for CAM to develop in the UK.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7240">'''Reticular theory''' is an [[obsolete scientific theory]] in [[neurobiology]] that stated that everything in the [[nervous system]], such as [[brain]], is a single continuous network. The concept was postulated by a German anatomist [[Joseph von Gerlach]] in 1871, and was most popularised by the Nobel laureate Italian physician [[Camillo Golgi]].

However, the theory was refuted by later observations of a Spanish pathologist [[Santiago Ramón y Cajal]], using a [[Golgi's method|staining technique]] discovered by Golgi, which showed that nervous tissue, like other tissues, is made of discrete cells.  This [[neuron doctrine]] turned out to be the correct description of the nervous system, whereas the reticular theory was discredited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hellman|first1=Hal|title=Great Feuds in Medicine : Ten of the Liveliest Disputes Ever|date=2001|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=New York|isbn=9780471347576|pages=93–97|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s2sV_Tn1itcC&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proponents of the two contrasting theories, Golgi and Ramón y Cajal were jointly awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1906, "in recognition of their work on the structure of the nervous system".&lt;ref name=chu&gt;{{cite journal |author= Chu NS |title= Centennial of the nobel prize for Golgi and Ramón y Cajal--founding of modern neuroscience and irony of discovery |url= |journal= Acta Neurol Taiwan |volume=15 |issue= 3 | pages= 217–222 |year= 2006 |pmid= 16995603|doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

In 1863 a German anatomist [[Otto Friedrich Karl Deiters]] described the existence of an unbranched tubular process (the [[axon]]) extending from some cells in the [[central nervous system]], specifically from the [[lateral vestibular nucleus]]. In 1871 Gerlach proposed that the brain is composed of "protoplasmic network", hence the basis of reticular theory. According to Gerlach, the nervous system simply consisted of a single continuous network called the reticulum. In 1873 Golgi invented a revolutionary method for microscopic research based on a specific technique for [[Cell staining|staining]] nerve cells, which he called "''la reazione nera''" (the "[[black reaction]]"). He was able to provide an intricate description of nerve cells in various regions of the cerebro-spinal axis, clearly distinguishing the axon from the [[dendrites]]. He drew up a new classification of cells on the basis of the structure of their nervous prolongation, and he criticized Gerlach's theory of the "protoplasmic network". Golgi claimed to observe in the [[gray matter]] an extremely dense and intricate network, composed of a web of intertwined branches of axons coming from different cell layers ("diffuse nervous network"). This structure, which emerges from the axons and is therefore essentially different from that hypothesized by Gerlach, appeared in his view to be the main organ of the nervous system, the organ that connected different cerebral areas both anatomically and functionally by means of the [[Action potential|transmission of an electric nervous impulse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Marina Bentivoglio |title=Life and Discoveries of Camillo Golgi |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1906/golgi-article.html |work=Nobelprize.org |publisher= Nobel Media |date=20 April 1998 |accessdate=23 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cimi&gt;{{cite journal |author= Cimino G |title= Reticular theory versus neuron theory in the work of Camillo Golgi |url= |journal= Physis Riv Int Stor Sci |volume= 36|issue= 2 | pages= 431–472 |year= 1999 |pmid= 11640243 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Golgi's earlier works between 1873 and 1885 clearly depicted the axonal connections of [[cerebellar cortex]] and [[olfactory bulb]] as independent of one another, his later works including the Nobel Lecture showed the entire granular layer of the cerebellar cortex occupied by a network of branching and [[Anastomosis|anastomosing]] nerve processes. This was due to his strong conviction in the reticular theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Raviola E, Mazzarello P|title=The diffuse nervous network of Camillo Golgi: facts and fiction |url= |journal=Brain Res Rev |volume=66 |issue=1–2 | pages=75–82 |year=2011 |pmid=20840856 |doi= 10.1016/j.brainresrev.2010.09.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1877 an English physiologist [[Edward Albert Sharpey-Schafer|Edward Schäfer]] described the absence of connections between the nerve elements in the mantles of the [[jellyfish]]. The Norwegian zoologist [[Fridtjof Nansen]] also reported in 1887 that he found no connections between the processes of the [[ganglion|ganglion cells]] of aquatic animals in his doctoral research (''The Structure and Combination of Histological Elements of the Central Nervous System'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bock O |title= Cajal, Golgi, Nansen, Schäfer and the Neuron Doctrine|url= |journal=Endeavour |volume= 37|issue= 4| pages= 228–34|year= 2013|pmid= 23870749 |doi= 10.1016/j.endeavour.2013.06.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1880s, serious opposition to the reticular theory began to emerge. Wilhelm His in [[Leipzig]] studied the embryological development of the central nervous system and concluded that his observations were consistent with the classic [[cell theory]] (that nerve cells were individual cells), and not the reticular theory. In 1891, another German anatomist [[Wilhelm Waldeyer]] also supported the theory by stating that the nervous system, as other tissues, was composed of cells, which he named "[[neurons]]." Using the very same Golgi's technique, Ramón y Cajal confirmed that discrete neurons did exist, thereby strengthening the concept of the growing neuron doctrine. Golgi, however, never accepted these new findings, and a controversy and rivalry between the two scientists lasted even after they were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in 1906.&lt;ref name=cimi/&gt; The Nobel award is even dubbed as creating the "storm center of histological controversy". Ramón y Cajal even commented that: "What a cruel irony of fate of pair, like [[Siamese twins]] united by the shoulders, scientific adversaries of such contrasting character!".&lt;ref name=chu/&gt;

In the 1950s [[electron microscopy]] finally confirmed the existence of individual neurons in the central nervous system, and the existence of gaps in between neurons called [[synapse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Renato M.E. Sabbatini |title= Neurons and Synapses: The History of Its Discovery|url=http://www.cerebromente.org.br/n17/history/neurons5_i.htm |work= Brain &amp; Mind Magazine|publisher= |date= April–July 2003|accessdate=23 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reticular theory was finally put to rest.

'''''Road to Survival''''' is a 1948 book by [[William Vogt]].  It was a major inspiration for the modern [[environmentalist]] movement.

==Summary==

''Road to Survival'' is a summary of the ecological status of the world.  Vogt attacks capitalism, and describes [[United States]] history as a "march of destruction".&lt;ref name="Mann"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mann|first1=Charles|title=The Wizard and the Prophet: Two Remarkable Scientists and Their Dueling Visions to Shape Tomorrow's World|date=2018|publisher=Knopf|isbn=0307961699}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is filled with scientific data, and its world-wide scope was unusual at the time.&lt;ref name="Antioch"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hunt|first1=Kenneth|title=Road to Survival|journal=The Antioch Review|date=1948|volume=8|issue=4|pages=505-507|doi=10.2307/4609306}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ultimately, the book advocates population control as the only way to prevent environmental disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ROAD TO SURVIVAL by William Vogt {{!}} Kirkus Reviews|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/william-vogt/road-to-survival/|website=Kirkus Reviews|accessdate=25 February 2018|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Human population could not exceed the planet's [[carrying capacity]] without disaster.&lt;ref name="Mann" /&gt;

==Reception==
The book was commercially successful.  A condensed version was published in ''[[Reader's Digest]]'', and many universities used the book as a textbook.  However, his message was attacked by ideologues of all varieties, by [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]] for opposing [[capitalism]] and supporting [[birth control]], and by [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberals]] as proof of "science's bankruptcy in the face of pressing modern problems".&lt;ref name="Mann" /&gt;

Later on, the book would inspire the modern [[environmentalism|environmental movement]], with both [[Rachel Carson]] and [[Paul R. Ehrlich|Paul Ehrlich]] being inspired by it.&lt;ref name="Mann" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2735">'''SMART''': SCOTLAND is a high profile innovation support grant scheme in Scotland aimed at small and medium-sized firms. It supports commercially viable projects which represent a significant technological advance for the UK sector or industry concerned.

The SMART grant supports technology development through:

* Technical and Commercial [[Feasibility Study|Feasibility Studies]]. These should involve early stage [[R&amp;D]], the outcome of which will enable informed decisions on the technical and commercial feasibility of a new [[Product (business)|product]] or [[Business process|process]].
* Research and Development Projects that aim to develop a pre-production prototype of a new product or process.

==Criteria==
Applicants must be based in [[Scotland]] or planning to set up in Scotland and must meet the [[European Community]] definition of a small and medium-sized enterprise which in summary means they must:

* have less than 250 employees (full-time equivalent world-wide, including partners and executive directors) and have either
* an annual [[Revenue|turnover]] not exceeding EUR 50 million  and/or
* an annual balance sheet total not exceeding EUR 43 million.

Awards are judged according to technological, intellectual property, financial and commercial aspects of the application as well as the management expertise available to the business. In addition other aspects such as the project's implications on society such as environmental impact, [[sustainability]] and [[health and safety]] may be taken into account.

==History==

The grant was launched in Scotland as SMART in 1999 and by April 2007 grants had been given to almost 400 businesses across Scotland amounting to some £14.7 million funding.[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2006/01/26121910] In April 2007 SMART was relaunched [http://www.ettc.co.uk/news/detail.asp?newsid=4354] as  the "SMART:SCOTLAND" Programme .

'''Soyuz 7K-OK No.1''' was an unmanned spacecraft of the [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz program]], originally intended to perform a rendezvous maneouver with [[Kosmos 133]] (Soyuz 7K-OK No.2). After the Kosmos 133 mission failed, the rocket was moved to the launch pad on December 12, 1966 and scheduled to launch on December 14, 1966, 4 PM local time.&lt;ref name="Star Wars"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Первушин|first1=Антон Иванович|last2=Pervushin|first2=Anton Ivanovich|title=Звездные войны. СССР против США|language=Russian|trans-title=Star Wars: USSR versus the USA)|date=2014|isbn=978-5-367-03181-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At ignition, one of the strap-on boosters failed to start and so an automatic command shut down the core stage and remaining strap-ons. Launch personnel began safeing the booster in preparation to take it down from the pad for examination. About 27 minutes after the aborted launch, the launch escape system suddenly activated. The Soyuz descent module was blasted free of the stack and touched down a quarter mile from the pad. Meanwhile, the exhaust from the LES caught the third stage of the booster on fire. Flames began curling down the side of the booster as launch personnel ran for cover. After a few minutes, the core stage and strap-ons exploded, completely destroying the entire launch vehicle and causing major damage to LC-31. One person on the ground was killed and the pad was not used again for seven months following the disaster.&lt;ref name="Star Wars"/&gt;

Since tracking cameras around LC-31 had been turned off when the launch aborted, there was no film footage of the fire or explosion for analysis, but telemetry data found that the igniter in the Blok D strap-on had failed to activate. This was a minor problem and could have been easily fixed by simply installing a new igniter. The bigger question was why the LES activated. Initially, it was suspected that the booster had been bumped when the gantry tower was put back in place following the abort and that this somehow managed to trigger the LES, but a more thorough investigation found a different cause. During the attempted launch, the booster switched from external to internal power as it normally would do, which then activated the abort sensing system. The Earth's rotation caused the rate gyros to register an approximately 8° tilt 27 minutes after the aborted liftoff, which the abort sensing system then interpreted as meaning that the booster had deviated from its flight path, and thus it activated the LES. The abort sensing system in the Soyuz was thus redesigned to prevent a recurrence of this unanticipated design flaw. On the other hand, the LES had also worked flawlessly and demonstrated its ability to safely pull cosmonauts from the booster should an emergency arise as it did years later in the [[Soyuz T-10-1]] abort.

One more mystery remained, which was why the LES had ignited the third stage on fire, something it was not supposed to do. The conclusion was that when the Soyuz descent module separated from the service module during the abort, it had inadvertently severed coolant lines in the service module, which then leaked out their highly flammable contents and started a fire when they were contacted by the LES exhaust.

'''''The Canon: A Whirligig Tour of the Beautiful Basics of Science''''' is a book written by American science author [[Natalie Angier]].

==Overview==

''The Canon'' presents a summary of some of the different areas of science, as well as extensive descriptions of, and interviews with, contemporary scientists who work in these fields.  Angier’s tenet is that an understanding of the basics of major areas of science can assist with providing a means by which to understand current scientific issues, and that this process should be fun.  In her Introduction, Angier writes:

{{quote|Of course you should know about science, for the same reason Dr. Seuss counsels his readers to sing with a Ying or play Ring the Gack: These things are fun, and fun is good.}}

Angier included quotes from the scientists she interviewed throughout her descriptions of different scientific topics in an attempt to show how scientists experience and think about their work, and why they do it.

==Scientists interviewed==
To obtain material for ''The Canon'', Angier interviewed a number of scientists, professors, and other science professionals, and incorporated their stories and quotes into her work.  She asked them questions such as, "What does it mean to think scientifically?" and "What should nonspecialist nonchildren know about science, and how should they know it, and what is this thing called fun?"  Most of these scientists are presently active in their field of research.  In addition, many of these scientists have extensive bodies of work listed in detail elsewhere.  The below list links the science professionals who Angier interviewed for ''The Canon'' with additional details relating to their work:

==Production==
In 2014, the series was first announced by [[Netflix]] and Scholastic Media, and was entitled ''The Magic School Bus 360°''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/tvnews.php?id=119412|title=Scholastic is Bringing The Magic School Bus 360 degrees to Netflix|publisher=''Coming Soon''|date=June 11, 2014|accessdate=June 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new iteration of the franchise features a modernized "Ms. Frizzle" (replacing Valerie with her younger sister Fiona) and a high-tech bus that stresses modern inventions such as robotics, wearables and camera technology. The hope is to captivate children's imaginations and motivate their interest in the sciences.&lt;ref name=cartoon&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blog.bcdb.com/animated-series-reboots-7699/|title=Three New Animated Series, Reboots All|first=Dave|last=Koch|publisher=Big Cartoon News|date=June 18, 2014|accessdate=June 18, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140620233051/http://blog.bcdb.com/animated-series-reboots-7699/|archivedate=June 20, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was produced by [[9 Story Media Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://miscrave.com/articles/magic-school-bus-360-delayed/|title=The Magic School Bus 360 delayed to 2017|publisher=''Coming Soon''|date=December 3, 2016|accessdate=December 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Producer [[Stuart Stone]], who voiced Ralphie in the original series, stated that ''The Magic School Bus 360°'' will feature some of the original voice actors in different roles.
