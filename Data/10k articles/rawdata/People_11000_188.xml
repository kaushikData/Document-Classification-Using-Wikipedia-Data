'''Abigail Loraine''' '''Hensel''' and '''Brittany Lee Hensel''' (born March 7, 1990) are American [[dicephalic parapagus twins]]; also known as [[conjoined twins]]. 

They are highly [[symmetric]] for conjoined twins, giving the appearance of having a single body without marked variation from normal proportions. Each has a separate [[heart]], [[stomach]], [[vertebral column|spine]], pair of lungs, and [[spinal cord]].

Each twin controls one arm and one leg. As infants, learning to crawl, walk and clap required them to cooperate. 

They can eat and write separately and simultaneously. Activities such as running, swimming, hair brushing and driving a car require coordinated action.

The twins' progress has been covered in the popular media, including [[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] magazine and on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]''. They were interviewed on [[The Learning Channel]] in December 2006, discussing their daily lives and future plans. They starred in their own reality series, ''[[Abby &amp; Brittany]]'', on [[TLC (TV channel)|TLC]] in 2012.&lt;ref name=YahooTV&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tv.yahoo.com/news/conjoined-twins--abby---brittany--get-their-own-reality-show--video-.html |title=Conjoined twins 'Abby &amp; Brittany' get their own reality show|publisher=Yahoo!TV |date= |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120809224609/http://tv.yahoo.com/news/conjoined-twins--abby---brittany--get-their-own-reality-show--video-.html |archivedate=2012-08-09 |accessdate=2012-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/11/conjoined-twins-abby-and-brittany-hensel_n_1760552.html |title= Abby Hensel, Brittany Hensel Reality Show: Conjoined Twins Star In TLC's 'Abby And Brittany'| date= August 11, 2012| work= [[Huffington Post]]| publisher= | access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The twins were born in [[Carver County, Minnesota]], to Patty, a [[registered nurse]], and Mike Hensel, a [[carpenter]] and [[landscaper]]. They have a younger brother and sister. They were raised in [[New Germany, Minnesota]], attended Mayer Lutheran High School in [[Mayer, Minnesota|Mayer]], and graduated from [[Bethel University (Minnesota)|Bethel University]] in [[Arden Hills, Minnesota|St. Paul]] in 2012.

==Physiology==
The twins have a single body with separate heads and necks, a chest that is wider than normal, two arms, and two legs. At birth, they had a rudimentary arm between the bases of their necks attached to a shoulder blade at the back, being combined parts of Abby's left arm and Brittany's right arm. It was removed, leaving the shoulder blade.

Abby's head tilts laterally outward about 5 degrees to the right, while Brittany's tilts laterally at about 15 degrees to the left, causing her to appear shorter even when seated. Brittany's leg is in fact nearly two inches shorter than Abby's and Brittany tends to stand and walk on tip-toe which has made her calf muscle significantly larger than Abby's.&lt;ref name= Ep3&gt;''[[Abby &amp; Brittany]]'', Episode 3&lt;/ref&gt; The continued growth of Abby's spine was surgically halted after Brittany prematurely stopped growing.&lt;ref name= Ep3 /&gt; At age 12, they underwent surgery at Gillette Children's Specialty Healthcare to correct [[scoliosis]] and to expand their chest cavity to prevent future difficulties with breathing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mymultiplesclerosis.co.uk/misc/shared-body.html |title=The Twins Who Share a Body |website=mymultiplesclerosis.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-12-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111145003/http://www.mymultiplesclerosis.co.uk/misc/shared-body.html |archive-date=2013-11-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each twin manages one side of their conjoined body. The sense of touch of each is restricted to her body half; this shades off at the [[midsagittal plane]] such that there is a small amount of overlap at the midline. Stomach aches, however, are felt by only the twin on the opposite side.&lt;ref name= Ep3 /&gt; 

They are effective in cooperatively using their limbs when both hands or both legs are required. By coordinating their efforts, they are able to walk, run, swim, and ride a bicycle normally&amp;mdash;all tasks that they learned at a normal speed. Together, they can type on a computer keyboard at a normal speed and drive a car. However, their disparate heights (Abby, {{height|ft=5|in=2}}, is taller and longer of leg than Brittany, {{height|ft=4|in=10}})&lt;ref&gt;Wallis, Lucy. [https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-22181528 "Living a conjoined life"], BBC News, 24 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; led to difficulty in balancing a [[Segway PT|Segway]], as shown in their 2012 reality series.&lt;ref name= Ep3 /&gt;

===Organ distribution===
The twins have individual organs in the upper part of their body, while most located at or below the level of the navel are shared, the exception being the spinal cord.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-425736/Abigail-Brittany-Hensel-extraordinary-bond.html |title=Abigail and Brittany Hensel: an extraordinary bond &amp;#124; Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date= 2006-12-31|accessdate=2011-12-23 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*2 [[human head|head]]s
*2 [[vertebral column|spines]] merging at the [[coccyx]] and joined at the [[human thorax|thorax]] by sections of ribs. Surgery was employed to correct [[scoliosis]].
*2 completely separate [[spinal cord]]s
*2 [[arm]]s (originally 3, but rudimentary central arm was surgically removed, leaving central shoulder blade in place)
*1 broad [[human ribcage|ribcage]] with 2 highly fused [[Human sternum|sternum]]s and traces of bridging ribs. Surgery was employed to expand the [[pleural cavity|pleural cavities]].
*2 [[breast]]s
*2 [[heart]]s in a shared [[circulatory system]] (nutrition, respiration, medicine taken by either affects both)
*4 [[human lung|lung]]s with the [[Human Anatomical Terms#Anatomical directions|medial]] lungs moderately fused, not involving Brittany's upper right lobe; three pleural cavities
*1 [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] with well-coordinated involuntary breathing, slight central defect
*2 [[stomach]]s
*2 [[gallbladder]]s
*1 [[liver]], enlarged and elongated right lobe
*Y-shaped [[small intestine]], which experiences a slightly spastic double [[peristalsis]] at the juncture
*1 [[large intestine]] (one [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]])
*3 [[kidney]]s: 2 left, 1 right
*1 [[urinary bladder|bladder]]
*1 set of [[Female reproductive system (human)|reproductive organs]]
*2 separate half-[[sacrum]]s, which converge distally
*1 slightly broad [[human pelvis|pelvis]]
*2 [[human leg|leg]]s

===Separation===
Upon their birth, the twins' parents decided not to attempt surgical separation after hearing from doctors that it was not likely that both would survive the operation. As they grew and learned to walk and develop other skills, their parents confirmed their decision against separation, arguing that the [[quality of life]] for the surviving twin or twins living separately would be less than their quality of life as conjoined people.&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite news |last=Wallis |first=Claudia |url=http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,984307,00.html |title=The Most Intimate Bond |publisher=TIME |date=1996-03-25 |accessdate=2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adulthood==
The twins both passed their [[driver's license]] exams, both the written and driving tests. They had to take the tests twice, once for each twin. Abby controls the devices on the right of the driver's seat; Brittany, those on the left. Together they control the [[steering wheel]].

They both graduated from high school in 2008. They began college at [[Bethel University (Minnesota)|Bethel University]] in [[Arden Hills, Minnesota]], majoring in education. They had considered pursuing different concentrations within that major, but the volume of extra coursework was prohibitive.&lt;ref name= Ep4&gt;''Abby &amp; Brittany'', Episode 4&lt;/ref&gt; They graduated with Bachelor of Arts degrees in 2012.&lt;ref name= Ep4 /&gt;

In conversation, the twins are clearly distinct persons, with distinct likes and dislikes. Their preferences in food, clothing color, etc., differ. Some of their clothes are altered by their [[seamstress]] so that they have two separate necklines in order to emphasize their individuality. They usually have separate meals, but sometimes share a single meal for the sake of convenience (e.g., each taking a bite of the same hamburger). Abby is better at [[mathematics]], and Brittany at [[creative writing|writing]]. 

For tasks such as responding to email, they type and respond as one, anticipating each other's feelings with little verbal communication between them. In such cases as the latter, their choice of [[grammatical person]] is to use "I" when they agree, but use their names when their responses do differ.

There is some concern about the twins' continued good health, because only four known sets of conjoined twins who share an undivided torso and two legs have ever survived into adulthood, and most have congenital heart defects or other organ anomalies. None has shown up in their case. 

They intensely dislike being stared at or photographed by strangers while going about their private lives.&lt;ref name=CP&gt;{{cite web|last=Hoffman |first=Kevin |url=http://blogs.citypages.com/blotter/2008/02/minnesotas_abby.php |title= Minnesota's Abby and Brittany Hensel, conjoined twins, make Newsweek | work= citypages.com |date=2008-02-28 |accessdate= 2011-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120103004716/http://blogs.citypages.com/blotter/2008/02/minnesotas_abby.php |archivedate= 2012-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In interviews for the [[Discovery Channel]] in 2006, they, then 16, said that they hoped to date, get married, and have children. They also stated that they hoped that by providing some information about themselves, they would be able to lead otherwise fairly typical social lives.&lt;ref name=CP/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Susanna| last= Schrobsdorff |url=http://www.newsweek.com/realitys-believe-it-or-not-93725 |title=Reality’s Believe It or Not|website= [[Newsweek]].com |date=2008-02-23 |accessdate=May 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media appearances==
The twins appeared on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' on April 8 and April 29, 1996. During the same month, they were featured on the cover of [[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] under the caption "One Body, Two Souls", and their daily lifestyle was described in the article, "The Hensels' Summer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Joined for life - co-joined six-year-old Hensel twins share many body parts: includes a related article on a set of sextuplets |work= Science World |publisher=Find Articles |date= 1996-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Life'' followed up with another story in September 1998. In 2002, they appeared in ''Joined for Life'', a TV documentary by Advanced Medical Productions, distributed on the [[Discovery Health Channel]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.advancedmedical.tv/shows/jfl.htm#synapsis "Joined For Life"], Advanced Medical Productions, 2002, accessed November 11, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and a 2003 follow-up, ''Joined at Birth''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.advancedmedical.tv/shows/jab.htm ''Joined at Birth''], Advanced Medical Productions, 2003, accessed November 11, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2003, an updated story of them at age 11 (filmed in 2001) was published in [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] and again in [[Life (magazine)|''Life'']]. ABC TV also did a documentary called "Joined For Life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/documentaries/stories/s814409.htm |title=ABC TV Documentaries: Joined For Life |website= abc.net.au |date=2003-03-27 |accessdate=2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medhunters.com/articles/sharedLives.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20040825150554/http://www.medhunters.com/articles/sharedLives.html |title= Article: Shared Lives: From the types of joining to separation surgeries, the issues around [sic] conjoined twins are varied and complex| website= Medhunters.com |date=August 22, 2004 |accessdate=2011-12-23 |archivedate=August 25, 2004 |first=Cynthia M. |last= Piccolo}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A UK television special in 2005 as part of the series ''[[Extraordinary People (2005 TV series)|Extraordinary People]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| publisher= [[Five (channel)|Channel 5]] |place= UK| title= Abby &amp; Brittany Hensel | format= television series|work= [[Extraordinary People (2005 TV series)|Extraordinary People]]| date= 21 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Advanced Medical made another documentary, ''Joined for Life: Abby &amp; Brittany turn 16'',&lt;ref&gt;Hutchison, Rob. [http://www.advancedmedical.tv/content/shows/jfl16.htm ''Joined for Life: Abby &amp; Brittany turn 16''], Advanced Medical Productions, 2006, accessed November 11, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; that discusses their adolescence, school, social life, and activities such as getting their [[driver's license]]s.&lt;ref name=time/&gt; 

The twins starred in the reality TV show ''[[Abby &amp; Brittany]]'' that started in August 2012.&lt;ref name=YahooTV/&gt; ''Abby and Brittany: Joined for Life'' was shown by the [[BBC]] in the UK in May 2013, and covers the period from their finishing college to starting a part-time teaching job.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01s5b2d/episodes/guide ''Abby and Brittany: Joined for Life''], BBC, accessed 21 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abd Shams ibn Abd Manaf''' ({{lang-ar|عبد شمس بن عبد مناف}}) was a prominent member of the [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraish]] [[tribe]] of [[Mecca]] in modern-day [[Saudi Arabia]]. The [[Banu Abd Shams]] sub-clan of the Quraish tribe and their descendants take its name from him.

==Lineage==
Abd Shams was the oldest son of [[Abd Manaf ibn Qusai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=bYtmAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA802&amp;lpg=PA802&amp;dq=Abd+Shams+ibn+Abd+Manaf+encyclopedia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yv16EU5Lh1&amp;sig=ZbwABJxL42G5IsQODGuCNFgCSOw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjuxOCR6OXZAhXJjJQKHRhMC00Q6AEIhQEwCQ|title=Encyclopaedia of Islam|first=Ian Richard|last=Netton|date=19 December 2013|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; His younger brothers were [[Muttalib ibn Abd Manaf|Muttalib]], [[Nawfal ibn Abd Manaf|Nawfal]] and [[Hashim ibn Abd Manaf|Hashim]], after whom the [[Banu Hashim]] tribe was named.&lt;ref name="Razvi"&gt;{{cite book |last=Razvi|first=Haafiz Mohammed Idrees|title=Manifestations of the Moon Of Prophethood|url=http://www.fikreraza.org/books/books/manifestations-of-the-moon-of-prophethood%5B1%5D.pdf|year=2009|publisher=Imam Mustafa Raza Research Centre Overport|page=18|isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andrew Ivan Bell''' (born 25 April 1964) is the lead singer of the English [[synth-pop]] [[duet (music)|duo]] [[Erasure]]. His solo career includes the albums ''[[Non-Stop (Andy Bell album)|Non-Stop]]'', ''[[Electric Blue (album)|Electric Blue]]'', and ''iPop''.

==Early life==
Bell grew up in the [[Dogsthorpe, Peterborough|Dogsthorpe]]{{cn|date=October 2016}} area of [[Peterborough]]. His family still resides in the city and surrounding areas such as [[Market Deeping]].{{cn|date=October 2016}} Bell was educated at the [[The King's (The Cathedral) School|King's School]] in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lamy|first1=Joel|title=School 'owes debt' to inspirational teacher|url=http://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/news/education/school-owes-debt-to-inspirational-teacher-1-7490882|accessdate=9 October 2016|work=Peterborough Telegraph|publisher=Peterborough Today|date=2016-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CLAIM: Anger over 'scary city' jibe by star|url=http://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/news/environment/claim-anger-over-scary-city-jibe-by-star-1-144774|accessdate=9 October 2016|work=Peterborough Telegraph|publisher=Peterborough Today|date=2003-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1985, while selling women's shoes and performing in a band called the Void, he responded to a newspaper advert that was looking for a singer. [[Vince Clarke]] had been Bell's "hero"; Bell was successful in his audition and together they formed the group [[Erasure]]. The pair have sold over 25 million albums worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Simpson |first=Dave |date=30 July 2014 |title=Andy Bell: 'I'd had enough of being bullied' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/jul/30/andy-bell-erasure-hiv-cocaine-interview |publisher=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bell has also donated time and made [[sound recording and reproduction|recordings]] for charities. These included Ferry Aid's [[cover version|cover]] of "[[Let It Be (Ferry Aid song)|Let It Be]]" (1987); a cover of [[Cole Porter]]'s "[[Too Darn Hot]]", that was included in 1990s ''Red Hot + Blue'' album to raise funds for AIDS and HIV research; re-making [[Lene Lovich]]'s "Rage" alongside her to be included in ''[[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]]'''s album (1991) in favour of a wildlife campaign; and performing twice on Big Spender's Red Hot and Dance events to support various AIDS projects (in both December 1994 and November 2004). Bell also performed on the [[True Colors (concert tour)|True Colours Tour 2008]].

Bell sang the role of Montresor in the opera ''[[The Fall of the House of Usher (Hammill opera)|The Fall of the House of Usher]]'' by [[Peter Hammill]] and [[Judge Smith]], released in 1991 and reissued with a new recording in 1999.

Bell's first solo album was announced in July 2005. He signed a worldwide solo [[recording contract]] with [[Sanctuary Records]], and announced details of his debut album, which was released on 3 October 2005 and entitled ''[[Electric Blue (album)|Electric Blue]]''. The album featured fourteen tracks, including three [[duet (music)|duets]], with [[Claudia Brücken]] of [[Propaganda (band)|Propaganda]] and [[Jake Shears]] of [[Scissor Sisters]].

The first single, "Crazy", released on 26 September 2005, included club [[remix]]es from his Erasure partner [[Vince Clarke]], plus [[Cicada (band)|Cicada]], MHC and King Roc. ''Electric Blue'' was co-written and recorded throughout 2004 and 2005 with [[Manhattan Clique]] (Philip Larsen and Chris Smith) who have worked with Erasure, [[Moby]], [[The B-52's|the B-52s]], [[Stereophonics]] and [[Goldfrapp]].

Bell released his second solo album, ''[[Non-Stop (Andy Bell album)|Non-Stop]]'', on 7 June 2010.&lt;ref name="andybell"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andybell.com/index.html |title=Andy Bell Official Website |publisher=Andy Bell |accessdate=15 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726095033/http://www.andybell.com/index.html |archivedate=26 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was co-written and co-produced by Bell and [[Pascal Gabriel]], who previously remixed "[[It Doesn't Have to Be]]" for Erasure. It also features a collaboration with [[Perry Farrell]].

Using the pseudonym '''Mimó''', Bell released two Pascal Gabriel-produced singles on [[Mute Records]]: "Running Out" (2009)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mute.com/releases/viewRelease.jsp?id=9051648 |title=MiMó – Running Out |publisher=Mute.com |accessdate=15 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Will You Be There?"

In June 2011, he appeared on the [[Popstar to Operastar (series 2)|second season]] of [[ITV Network|ITV]] series ''[[Popstar to Operastar]]'' and finished in fifth place.

==Personal life==
Bell is [[openly gay]], and had a longtime partner in Paul M. Hickey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/829225051.html?dids=829225051:829225051&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Apr+29%2C+2005&amp;author=Richard+Harrington&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post&amp;desc=Erasure%27s+Edge%3A+Still+Sharp&amp;pqatl=google |date=29 April 2005|title=Erasure's Edge: Still Sharp |work=The Washington Post |first=Richard |last=Harrington|accessdate=15 December 2010 |quote=One of the first openly gay pop stars, Bell used to cover Tammy Wynette's "Stand by Your Man" sporting bell-bottom cowboy chaps with the backsides cut out, long before Prince or Christina Aguilera struck that ex-pose... Spain (where Bell lives with his partner of 20 years, Paul Hickey)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bell told ''[[Melody Maker]]'' in 1986, "I don't want to go out of my way to talk about it but I'm not going to pretend I'm not [gay]. I won't portray a heterosexual in videos and we're consciously doing lyrics that could apply to either sex".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/erasure-3 www.answers.com Erasure (accessed 27/07/2014)]&lt;/ref&gt;  He told Barry Walters of ''[[Seventeen (American magazine)|Seventeen]]'', "I want to be known as a good performer but it's important to me to take a stance. If you're doing music, you should use it for something and have substance. Being gay and open about it is my substance".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/erasure-3 www.answers.com Erasure (accessed 1/29/2013)]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 December 2004, Bell publicly announced that he has been [[HIV positive people|HIV-positive]] since 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vineyard |first=Jennifer |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1494872/20041214/erasure.jhtml |title=Erasure Singer Andy Bell Says He's HIV-Positive |publisher=MTV |date=14 December 2004 |accessdate=15 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2007 interview, he remarked that there is a complacency among gay men about [[HIV]]:
{{quote|There are definitely HIV-positive people who meet other HIV-positive men, and like still having unprotected sex. I think it must be quite hard for young gay men because there is so much for them now to do–there are so many saunas and stuff like that for them to go to, and it's so easy to get it."&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/jul/26/popandrock.hiv | location=London |work=The Guardian  | first=Hannah | last=Pool | title=Question time: Erasure singer Andy Bell | date=26 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bell suffers from [[avascular necrosis]]. He has had both hips replaced, which keeps him from "[[pogoing]] around" in more recent performances.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;

'''Anne Cobden-Sanderson''' or '''Julia Sarah Anne Cobden''' (26 March 1853 – 2 November 1926) was a British socialist and suffragette.

== Life ==
Cobden was born in [[London]] in 1853 to Catherine Anne and the radical politician [[Richard Cobden]]. After her father died, she was educated at schools in Britain and Germany. She lived for a time at the home of [[George MacDonald]] and later at the home of [[William Morris]]. In 1882 she married the out-of-work barrister [[T. J. Cobden-Sanderson|T. J. Sanderson]], and they both took the surname Cobden-Sanderson.&lt;ref name=anne&gt;A. C. Howe, (Julia Sarah) 'Anne Cobden-Sanderson (1853–1926)', ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/56224, accessed 28 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

Anne was concerned that her husband was thinking rather than doing, and she suggested that he take up book-binding. They were already in the social circle of [[William Morris]] and [[Jane Burdon]], and it was her husband who first coined the term "Arts and Crafts". Morris had already established the [[Kelmscott Press]] when Anne's husband and a photographer named [[Emery Walker]] agreed to found a press. The press was named the [[Doves Press]] and the profits were to be shared, but it was Anne who put up the capital of £1600 to start the business. Crucially, it was agreed that should the partnership end, Walker would be entitled to a copy of the font that they proposed to create. The Doves Type was created and Anne's single-minded husband used strict "[[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]]" principles to create the Doves Bible, which was sold at a £500 profit. By 1906 the partners had fallen out over Walker's lack of interest and her husband's obsessive interest. Despite the agreement, Anne's husband did not deliver a copy of the font and instead arranged for every copy of the design to be dropped into the [[River Thames]].&lt;ref name=dec21&gt;{{cite news|title=The Fight Over the Doves|url=https://www.economist.com/news/christmas-specials/21591793-legendary-typeface-gets-second-life-fight-over-doves|accessdate=28 July 2015|work=The Economist|date=21 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cobden-Sanderson at No10.jpg|thumb|left|Cobden-Sanderson at 10 Downing Street shortly before her 1909 arrest.]]

Cobden-Sanderson worked for the [[Independent Labour Party]] and was arrested as a suffragette in October 1906 (along with [[Minnie Baldock]] and [[Nellie Martel]]). [[George Bernard Shaw]] wrote a letter of protest in September and she was released the following month.&lt;ref name=anne /&gt; She was a founding member of the [[Women's Freedom League]].&lt;ref name=bryn /&gt; She also helped form the [[Women's Tax Resistance League]] in 1909.

In 1907 she was invited to speak in the United States by [[Harriet Stanton Blatch]] to tell American suffragettes about the protest methods used in Britain.

'''Bradley J. "Brad" Wilk''' (born September 5, 1968) is an American musician, actor, and activist. He is best known as the drummer of the rock bands [[Rage Against the Machine]] (1991–2000; 2007–2011), [[Audioslave]] (2001–2007; 2017), and [[Prophets of Rage]] (2016–present).

Wilk started his career as a drummer for [[Greta (band)|Greta]] in 1990, and helped co-found Rage with [[Tom Morello]] and [[Zack de la Rocha]] in August 1991. Following that band's breakup in October 2000 Wilk, Morello, Rage Against the Machine bassist [[Tim Commerford]], and [[Soundgarden]] front man [[Chris Cornell]] formed the [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[Audioslave]], which broke up in 2007. As of 2016, he is playing in the band [[Prophets of Rage]], with Commerford, Morello, [[Chuck D]], [[B-Real]] and [[DJ Lord]].

Wilk has also performed drums on English [[heavy metal music|metal]] band [[Black Sabbath]]'s final album ''[[13 (Black Sabbath album)|13]]''. The album was released in June 2013. Wilk briefly played with [[Pearl Jam]] shortly after the release of their debut album ''[[Ten (Pearl Jam album)|Ten]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Childers |first1=Chad |title=TOM MORELLO: 'IT'S A MIRACLE' RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE MADE FOUR ALBUMS |url=http://loudwire.com/tom-morello-miracle-rage-against-the-machine-made-four-albums/ |website=[[Loudwire]] |accessdate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Bradley J. Wilk was born on September 5, 1968, in [[Portland, Oregon]] and raised in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. His family later settled in [[Southern California]]. He started to play the drums when he was thirteen years old. He has cited [[John Bonham]], [[Keith Moon]], and [[Elvin Jones]] as his greatest influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drummersrepublic.com/drummers/ratm-drummer-brad-wilk-biography|title=Profile|publisher=Drummersrepublic.com|date=September 10, 2013|accessdate=2014-02-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129030420/http://www.drummersrepublic.com/drummers/ratm-drummer-brad-wilk-biography/|archivedate=November 29, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilk was a fan of [[Van Halen]] in his youth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brad Wilk on Prophets of Rage, Sabbath and Alex Van Halen's swing|url=http://www.musicradar.com/news/drums/brad-wilk-on-prophets-of-rage-sabbath-and-alex-van-halens-swing-646125|website=MusicRadar|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; having seen the band live when he was thirteen.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} He is of [[Jewish]]-[[Poles|Polish]] descent.

==Career==
===Rage Against the Machine===
Wilk's success as the drummer of [[Rage Against the Machine]] came from the failure of a different band; he once auditioned for a band called [[Lock Up (US band)|Lock Up]], who released one album (titled ''[[Something Bitchin' This Way Comes]]'') through Geffen records in 1989 and broke up when the album received little media attention upon release. Former Lock Up guitarist [[Tom Morello]] was looking to pick up where Lock Up left off and start a new band, and contacted Wilk, who was playing with the band [[Greta (band)|Greta]], to see if he was interested in playing the drums. A short while after, the duo met [[Zack de la Rocha]] while he was rapping freestyle in a club, and through him, bassist [[Tim Commerford]] (a childhood friend of de la Rocha). The band played two shows in 1991, and spent 1992 frequenting the L. A. club circuit, during which they signed a record deal with [[Epic Records]], and released their [[Rage Against the Machine (album)|self-titled debut album]] that November. They quickly achieved commercial success and would go on to release three more studio albums–''[[Evil Empire (album)|Evil Empire]]'' in 1996, ''[[The Battle of Los Angeles]]'' in 1999, and ''[[Renegades (Rage Against the Machine album)|Renegades]]'' in 2000– before disbanding in October 2000.

====Rage Against the Machine reunion====
Rage Against The Machine reunited to play at the [[Coachella Music Festival]] in [[Indio, California|Coachella]], California on January 22, 2007. On April 29, 2007, Rage Against The Machine reunited at the Coachella Music Festival (see [[Rage Against the Machine reunion tour]]). The band played in front of an EZLN backdrop to the largest crowds of the festival.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Initially thought to be a one-time event, the band played seven more shows that year in the United States (including their first non-festival concert in seven years at the [[Alpine Valley Music Theater]] in [[East Troy, Wisconsin|East Troy]], Wisconsin), and in January 2008, they played their first shows outside of the U.S. as part of the Big Day Out Festival in Australia and New Zealand.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} The band has since continued to tour around the world, headlining many large festivals in Europe and the United States, including Lollapalooza in Chicago. After a brief South America tour in 2010, they created their own festival, the L. A. Rising, which they headlined on July 30, 2011. This is their most recent show to date. In November 2012, they released an [[Rage Against the Machine (album)#XX 20th Anniversary Edition|XX anniversary boxset]] of their first album.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===Audioslave===

[[File:Brad Wilk Montreux Jazz Festival 2005.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Wilk performing with [[Audioslave]] at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] in 2005]]
The remaining members formed [[Audioslave]] with former [[Soundgarden]] frontman [[Chris Cornell]]. The band released their [[Audioslave (album)|self-titled debut album]] in 2002, which was followed by ''[[Out of Exile]]'' in 2005, and ''[[Revelations (Audioslave album)|Revelations]]'' in 2006. Audioslave formally disbanded in February 2007 when Cornell left to focus on his solo career.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===Prophets of Rage (2016-present)===
In 2016, Brad Wilk reunited with Tom Morello and Tim Commerford, and was joined by [[Chuck D]], [[B-Real]] and [[DJ Lord]] to form supergroup [[Prophets of Rage]]. They play covers from their [[Rage Against The Machine]], [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]] and [[Cypress Hill]] material, and new material as well. They're touring the United States under the statement "Make America Rage Again" to protest against [[Donald Trump]] policies and the [[2016 American presidential election]].

===Other projects===
Wilk and bandmate [[Tom Morello]] joined with [[Maynard James Keenan]] of [[Tool (band)|Tool]] and [[Billy Gould]] of [[Faith No More]]–in a lineup that was billed as Shandi's Addiction–to record the song "[[Calling Dr. Love]]" for the 1994 Kiss tribute album [[Kiss My Ass: Classic Kiss Regrooved]]. Wilk and bandmate Tim Commerford contributed in Keenan's side project [[Puscifer]] and his album ''[["V" Is for Vagina]]'' on the track "Momma Sed". Wilk also contributed drums to rap group [[Cypress Hill]]'s album ''[[Skull and Bones (album)|Skull and Bones]]''. In addition, Wilk composed the song "Snoop Bounce (Roc N Roll Remix)" for [[Snoop Dogg]]'s ''[[Death Row: Snoop Doggy Dogg at His Best|Death Row's Greatest Hits]]'' CD.

In 2005, Wilk played the lead role in the independent short movie [[Sleeping Dogs Lie (2005 film)|Sleeping Dogs Lie]] by writer Chumahan Bowen and director Stuart Lessner. The film also features [[Tool (band)|Tool]] lead singer [[Maynard James Keenan]] as Deputy Lance. Wilk played drums on [[Josh Homme]]'s tracks on the soundtrack to [[The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys (soundtrack)|Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys]]. Wilk performed live with Tom Morello's side project, [[Street Sweeper Social Club]], at the 2010 Coachella music and arts festival. In 2013, Wilk and Commerford contributed drums and bass, respectively, for [[Dave Grohl]]'s ''[[Sound City (film)|Sound City]]'' soundtrack, on the song "Time Slowing Down". Wilk played several shows with the [[Sound City Players]].

Having established himself as a session musician, Wilk has also contributed drums on the [[Black Sabbath]] album ''[[13 (Black Sabbath album)|13]]'', which was released on June 11, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=184790|title=Black Sabbath: New Album Title Announced; Recording Drummer Revealed|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|date=January 12, 2012|accessdate=2012-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2013, Wilk joined the band [[The Last Internationale]] and recently recorded their debut album called ''We Will Reign'' with producer Brendan O'Brien. The record was released on August 19, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-GYMAFITbY|title=The Last Internationale - Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Indian Blood - YouTube|work=YouTube|accessdate=September 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To the end of 2014 until June 2015, Brad Wilk was playing drums on tour with the [[Smashing Pumpkins]] along with [[Billy Corgan]], [[Jeff Schroeder]] and also [[Mark Stoermer]] on bass. On 26 February 2015, while touring Australia with the band, he joined the [[Foo Fighters]] on stage at Sydney's Olympic (ANZ) stadium playing drums for a [[Van Halen]] cover [[Ain't Talkin' 'bout Love]]. On August 3, 2015, Wilk sat-in with The 8G Band on ''[[Late Night with Seth Meyers]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hoffman|first1=Michael|title=This Week's 'Late Night with Seth Meyers' Guests: Miles Teller; Craig Robinson; Jason Segel|url=http://tvimpulse.com/this-weeks-late-night-with-seth-meyers-guests-miles-teller-craig-robinson-jason-segel=44058|website=tvimpluse.com|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He's also been drumming for [[Juliette Lewis]] on various tours and shows.

==Personal life==
Wilk has noted a personal affinity with the number three throughout his life, and has positioned small decal stickers of the number "3" all over his drum kit, and as well as in the liner notes for [[Rage Against the Machine]]'s third album, ''[[The Battle of Los Angeles (album)|The Battle of Los Angeles]]''. In an interview with [[Modern Drummer]] Wilk said "Ever since I was eight or nine I've gravitated to the number three. It's something that has always been a really heavy number for me. It's tattooed on my arm, and I count in threes. Everyone in school was taught two, four, six, eight, ten- I'd count in threes in the way I'd walk, even in the decisions I'd make. It was all based on threes", and also incorporates 3 into his playing.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Wilk was diagnosed with [[type 1 diabetes]] in 1997, and is active in raising money for diabetes awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sistrunk|first=Jeff|url=http://forecast.diabetes.org/magazine/features/rock-drummer-brad-wilk-type-1-and-touring|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120709200845/http://forecast.diabetes.org/magazine/features/rock-drummer-brad-wilk-type-1-and-touring|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-07-09|title=Rock Drummer Brad Wilk on Type 1 and Touring &amp;#124; Diabetes Forecast Magazine|publisher=Forecast.diabetes.org|accessdate=2011-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has donated about $12,000 to the Orange County chapter of the [[Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation]] (JDRF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dlife.com/diabetes/famous_people/musicians/brad-wilk-biography|title=Brad Wilk Biography|publisher=dLife|date=November 28, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306111236/http://www.dlife.com/diabetes/famous_people/musicians/brad-wilk-biography|archivedate=March 6, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unable to find an all natural, sugar-free lemonade that would fit with his diet management and exercise plan, Wilk began formulating his own lemonade in his kitchen, using [[stevia]] in the place of sugar. After receiving positive feedback from friends and family, Wilk launched ''Olade''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artsupplywarehouse.com/finelineDisplay.php?id=383170 |title=ASW – Olade Juice Beverages |publisher=Artsupplywarehouse.com |date=April 17, 2008 |accessdate=2014-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since December 2009, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] has approved Olade to be put into the market as a non-dietary supplement, meaning anyone with or without diabetes can consume it.

'''Britannia's Gold Ltd''' is a British company engaged in the salvage of [[precious metal]]s from deep-water shipwrecks.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{citeweb|title=Salvage firm hopes to net gold worth £125bn sunk by German U-boats|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/01/salvage-firm-hopes-to-net-gold-worth-125bn-sunk-by-german-u-boats|website=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company claims that £323 billion of gold and silver was shipped by the British government between 1914 and 1945. A number of these merchant vessels were sunk by German U-boats during the first and second world wars. The company's aim is to locate these sunken vessels and retrieve their cargoes.&lt;ref name="DM"&gt;{{citeweb|title=How a crack team of marine experts spent 20 years breaking secret wartime codes and scouring archives to finally trace the £4.5BILLION of British gold sunk by the Nazis|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4325822/The-4-5BILLION-British-gold-sunk-Nazis.html|website=[[Daily Mail]]|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The company claims to have spent 25 years researching lost war-time vessels. Via this research on war-risk insurance payouts and cross-referencing the vessels with insurance records they have identified some 700 vessels that contain bullion. The bullion was being transported to The United States and members of the British Commonwealth to pay for war materials.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{citeweb|title=Treasure hunt to recover £4.5billion worth of British gold trapped in merchant ships torpedoed by Nazis|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/03/18/treasure-hunt-recover-45billion-worth-british-gold-trapped-merchant/|website=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company estimates that some 2000 tons of precious metals (mainly gold and silver bullion) was sunk from ships that mainly left from Glasgow and Liverpool.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;

==Retrieval==
The company has not revealed details of which port they are based for security reasons. The first exploration they intend to survey is a group of two first world war and a single second world war British merchant ships sunk by a German U-boat whilst en-route to Canada.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;

The company has built a special vessel that allows the crew to remain directly over the sunken vessels. From this ship the crew will lower submersibles (to depths of 5,500m) to investigate the ships and prepare for the next stage of retrieving the precious metals. The cost of the first expedition is estimated at £15 million.&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt;

As the bullion remains in the ownership of the British Government the company will need to negotiate how the retrieved bullion is brough back to the UK.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; Since 1914 all British warships sunk are classified as both war graves and sovereign territory, merchant vessel wrecks however do not have the same legal protection.&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt;

==Financial backing==
Britannia's Gold Ltd is backed by private investment but it is also crowd-sourcing an initial £8 million to conduct the first surveys.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=Team of salvage experts hoping to recover billions of pounds worth of gold from deep-sea shipwrecks are looking for investors|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/markets/article-4527842/Investors-join-salvage-hunt-4-5bn-gold.html|website=[[This is Money]]|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charlie Savage''', (?&amp;ndash; September 6, 1813) was a sailor (most likely of [[Swedish people|Swedish]] descent) and [[beachcombing|beachcomber]] known for his exploits on the islands of [[Fiji]] between 1808 and 1813.

==Arrival at Fiji==

Most accounts place Savage as a sailor aboard a ship registered in [[Port Jackson]] ([[Sydney]]), [[Australia]], from which he was left in [[Tonga]] around 1807.  From Tonga he was taken to Fiji by the [[Eliza (1808)|''Eliza'']] which was wrecked near [[Nairai]] Island.&lt;ref name="refname1"/&gt;

==Exploits with the Bau==

Given his fluency of the Tongan and Fijian languages and proclivity for violence, Savage easily insinuated himself in the company of the  [[Bau Island]] chieftain [[Turaga na Rasau#The reign of Naulivou|Naulivou]]. From the wreckage of the ''Eliza'', Savage was able to salvage a number of [[musket]]s which he then demonstrated to the Bauan leaders.  This combination of circumstance, personality, and technology allowed Savage to participate in the Fijian wars, allegedly the first time firearms were ever used in Fiji.&lt;ref name="refname4"/&gt;

Savage led a small group of beachcombers as mercenaries in the service of Naulivou and quickly showed their worth in fights with his enemies.&lt;ref name="refname3"/&gt;  Lacking certain cultural inhibitions of Fijians (such as targeting opposing chieftains at the outset of battle) and leveraging their individual skill with muskets proved Savage and company as a violent and capable force in Fijian internecine warfare.

Savage is credited with using an arrow-proof structure built outside his enemies' fortifications so that he could fire at them with impunity.  Other accounts of his lethality depict that his “victims were so numerous that the townspeople piled up the bodies and sheltered behind them; and the stream beside the village ran red.”&lt;ref name="refname4"/&gt;

For his services, Savage was accorded a certain amount of prestige and rewards from Naulivou, although the scope and magnitude of the more sensational details, to include numerous wives, influence on local politics, and becoming a cannibal chief in his own right, appear to be exaggerated accounts mixed with European yarns of “white savages.”&lt;ref name="refname5"/&gt;

==The events of Dillon's Rock==

In 1813 the ''Hunter'' reached Fiji to ply in the [[sandalwood]] trade and subsequently employed a number of local European beachcombers including Savage.  As recounted by third mate [[Peter Dillon]], Savage met his fate in a skirmish with Wailea Fijians on September 6, 1813.  Ashore as a member of a party to destroy Wailean canoes, Savage and the other scattered members of the party found themselves the victims of an ambush.  They attempted to flee back to the anchored ''Hunter'', but found “it impossible to get to the boat through the crowds of natives that intercepted the pathway.”&lt;ref name="refname6"/&gt;  At this point Dillon directed the men to climb a flat-topped hill of a rock (which later became Dillon's Rock) and organized a defense.  Because of its steep and narrow ascent, the rock could only be climbed by a few persons at a time, allowing the defenders to maximize their volleys.
  
After some intense and sporadic exchanges, the Wailea fell back to a siege of sorts comprised (by Dillon’s accounting) of several thousand natives. At this point Savage suggested that they break and run, but this was outrightly dismissed by Dillon, who, to further accentuate his resolve, threatened to shoot the first man who attempted to run.  Using the lull in fighting to attempt to parlay, Dillon reminded the Wailea that eight of their own, including a priest’s brother were held hostage on board the ''Hunter''.  Dillon proposed sending a man down to go to the ship to secure their release in exchange for the defenders.  The Wailea agreed and so an injured defender was sent down to facilitate the transaction.  During this ceasefire, several chiefs climbed the hill to implore the remaining defenders to accept offers of friendship and peace.  Savage, confident in his knowledge of the language and customs was convinced that he could go down safely and secure some sort of resolution.  Dillon disagreed and refused to leave the rock before the prisoner exchange, and allowed Savage to go only if he left his musket and ammunition behind.

Savage then descended the rock and spoke with the Wailea for some time who continued to try to convince Dillon to join them but to no avail.  Finally, exasperated by Dillon’s refusal to come down and triggered by another defender attempting to escape, the Wailea attacked the unarmed Savage and quickly overpowered him, eventually drowning him in a well.  Dillon goes on to describe [[cannibal]]istic practices and rituals involved with Savage’s and the others’ bodies, but those details have been disputed by others.&lt;ref name="refname7"/&gt;

==Results of Savage's exploits==

The life of an archetypal beachcomber with few documented exploits has served as the legend-making clay of numerous writers and historians in the time since. Savage's influence (and by association muskets) on Fiji's history has been debated.  Scholarly books and articles have examined Savage's legacy in terms of his aid in the rise of the Bau (and thus their subsequent dominance of Fiji), his introduction of firearms, and his role as an agent of social change with varying degrees of support and reproof.

'''Cheng Qian''' ({{zh|t=程潛 |s=程潜|p=Chéng Qián |w='''''Ch'eng Ch'ien'''''}}; 31 March 1882 – 5 April 1968) was a Chinese military general and revolutionary.  He occupied a number of significant military and political posts in the [[Kuomintang]] and in [[Sun Yat-Sen]]'s government from the late 1910s through the 1940s. By the late 1940s he was one of the most powerful members of the Kuomintang, and in 1948, he was a successful candidate for the vice-presidency of the KMT [[Nationalist government]]. He was also Governor of [[Hunan]], his native province and in whose political affairs he had been active all his life. In August 1949, he peacefully surrendered to the [[Chinese Communist Party|Communists]], who were rapidly advancing on [[Guangzhou]], then the seat of the KMT government, hastening the collapse of the defense of the KMT [[National Revolutionary Army]].  After 1949, Cheng held several important political positions in the [[China|People's Republic of China]] until his death in 1968.

==Xinhai Revolution==
After having studied at a private school and having passed examination in 1889, Cheng joined the [[Yuelu Academy]] in [[Changsha]]. Here he began to understand the current political situation and decided to give up [[imperial exams]] and a civil career in favor of the military. In 1903, when he was 21, he was admitted first to the [[Hunan Military Academy]], and was sent the following year to study in [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] at the [[Tokyo Shimbu Gakko]], a military preparatory academy. While in Tokyo, he met [[Huang Xing]], [[Li Liejun]], and [[Song Jiaoren]], future nationalist leaders, who fascinated him with their ideas. [[File:Magnifying glass Cheng Qian used during the Northern Expedition.jpg|thumb|120px|left|Magnifying glass Cheng Qian used during the Northern Expedition]]In 1905 Cheng joined [[Sun Yat-sen]]'s ''[[Tongmenghui]]'' a secret revolutionary society, committed to overthrow the [[Qing Dynasty]] and modernize China. After serving as a cadet for one year in an artillery battalion in [[Himeji, Hyogo|Himeji]], he was admitted to the artillery school of the 6th class of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] in 1907. One of his classmates was [[Tang Jiyao]].

After graduation in 1908, Cheng returned in China, where he was put in charge of training a [[New Army]] in [[Sichuan]] Province under [[Zhu Qinglan]]. After the outbreak of the [[Xinhai Revolution]], Cheng took part in the [[Wuchang Uprising]] and immediately after he participated in the [[Battle of Changsha (1911)|Battle of Changsha]].

With the establishment of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]], Cheng was appointed military commander of [[Hunan]]. However, as [[Yuan Shikai]] staged his coup to control the Republic, Cheng tried to revolt, but his failure prompted him to flee to Japan, where he joined the [[Kuomintang]] and entered the [[Waseda University]].

Shortly after, Yuan Shikai tried to proclaim himself [[Emperor of China|Emperor]], causing the [[National Protection War]]. Cheng returned to Hunan to enlist rebel soldiers in [[Cai E]]'s army. During the [[Constitutional Protection Movement]] he was first appointed military commander of Changsha, then Vice Minister of War in Sun Yat-sen's [[Guangzhou]] Government. He was put in charge of training troops in Guangzhou, and then took part in the [[Northern Expedition]]. From 1925 to 1927 he was the General commanding 6th Army, and briefly served as Chairman of the Government of the [[Hunan Province]] in 1928. In 1926 he was elected a member of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang.

==Under Chiang Kai-shek==
In the following years, Cheng served in several capacities, including chief of General Staff from 1935 to 1937. When the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] began, Cheng Qian was made [[Commander in Chief]] of the 1st War Area in July 1937, and concurrently Chairman of the Government of [[Henan Province]] from 1937 to 1939. Cheng Qian was recalled from 1st War area in 1938 to serve as director of the [[Chiang Kai-shek|Generalissimo's]] Headquarters from until 1940. From 1940 to 1944 he was Deputy Chief of Staff of the National Military Council, and from 1944 to 1945 he was acting [[Chief of staff (military)|Chief of Staff]] of the National Military Council. He was also vice-chairman of the [[Central Military Commission (Kuomintang)|Central Military Commission]].

After the war ended, Cheng sided with the conciliatory faction in the Kuomintang. In 1947 he was elected in the [[Legislative Yuan]] (in the first election after 14 years) and contested the [[Vice President of the Republic of China|vice-presidency of the Republic of China]] in March 1948, barely losing it to [[Li Zongren]], supported by [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. Afterwards, he was appointed governor of Hunan once again.

==People's Republic of China==
As the [[Communist Party of China]] forces gained ground, Chiang Kai-shek stepped down in January 1949; after the collapse of peace talks in April, the communists crossed the [[Yangtze River]]. Cheng Qian in early August decided to surrender, and so Changsha was peacefully taken by the [[People's Liberation Army]].

Although the Kuomintang government issued an arrest warrant for Cheng, he was able to reach [[Beijing]] to attend the First Session of the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]]. The [[Central People's Government]] that ruled the [[People's Republic of China]] until 1954 appointed him vice-chairman of the [[Central Military Commission (People's Republic of China)|People's Revolutionary Military Council]] and vice-chairman of the Central-South Military and Government Administration Council, working to prevent river floods. He was also a vice-chairman of the [[Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang]].

In the following years, he was elected non-communist governor of Hunan in 1952, and a vice-chairman of the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] from 1954 till his death.

During the [[Cultural Revolution]], Cheng Qian was among the non-communists that [[Mao Zedong]] and [[Zhou Enlai]] prevented from being attacked, but he lost his leadership position in Hunan after a [[Revolutionary Committee (PRC)|revolutionary committee]] under [[Li Yuan (PRC general)|Li Yuan]]'s chairmanship was formed there. He died in [[Beijing]] on 15 April 1968 aged 86.

'''Chloe Lane''' is a fictional character from the American [[NBC]] soap opera ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'', portrayed by actress and singer [[Nadia Bjorlin]]. She was first introduced in November 1999, created by then-head writer [[Tom Langan]].&lt;ref name="soapoperadigest1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soapoperadigest.com/actors/nadiabjorlin/|title=Nadia Bjorlin Bio|publisher=SoapOperDigest.com|date=2010-02-26 |accessdate=2010-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bjorlin played Chloe nearly continuously from 1999 through 2005, and from 2007 until 2011, when she decided not to renew her contract with the soap.&lt;ref name="soapoperadigest1"/&gt; In 2012, Bjorlin announced during an interview with ''[[TV Guide]]'' that she would return to ''Days of our Lives'' once again,&lt;ref name="TV Guide"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Nadia-Bjorlin-Days-of-our-Lives-1052133.aspx |title=Exclusive: Nadia Bjorlin Returns to Days of Our Lives |publisher=tvguide.com |accessdate=August 21, 2012 |date=2012-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; makingher return on January 7, 2013 and remaining through April 16, 2013. Bjorlin returned to the role, in a two-episode stint in celebration of the soap's fiftieth anniversary celebration on August 3, 2015. She returned for another visit in January 2016 and returned full-term in June 2016.

Chloe arrived in [[Salem (Days of our Lives)|Salem]] in the year 1999, having lived in an orphanage for fifteen years. She reunited with her birth mother, [[Nancy Wesley]] and they faced issues in their mother-daughter relationship. Chloe's social life was also bad as she was bullied at school for her personality and appearance, leading to her being popularly called "[[Ghoul]] girl" by her peers.&lt;ref name="G"/&gt; In spite of this, she managed to form a relationship with [[Philip Kiriakis]]. Chloe, who is also an [[opera singer]], has diverted away from her early dark image over the years. She has been married three times, two of which have ended in divorce with one being annulled. She also shares a child with her late ex-husband [[Daniel Jonas]], Parker.

==Casting and creation==
The role of Chloe Lane was introduced by head writer [[Tom Langan]] in November 1999. She has been portrayed by [[Nadia Bjorlin]] since the beginning.&lt;ref name="soapoperadigest1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="who"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.soapcentral.com/days/whoswho/chloe.php |title=Who's Who – Chloe Lane |accessdate=12 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character was born on August 20, 1984. Her birth-date was originally 1985, as she appeared to be 16 years old in 2001.&lt;ref name="who"/&gt; Bjorlin's contract on ''Days of our Lives'' lasted until June 13, 2003 and she departed the series. She briefly returned from December 24, 2003 to January 12, 2004.&lt;ref name="who"/&gt; She had another stint from August 13 to September 2004. She returned on a recurring status from December 2004 to September 16, 2005, when she left ''Days of our Lives'' to pursue a role in the [[UPN]] series ''[[Sex, Love &amp; Secrets]]''.&lt;ref name="who"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Buddy"/&gt;

She returned on November 29, 2007 after an absence. Discussing her return, the actress said: "I love working with the people I used to and [who] I know, but it's also fun to work with new people, because you don't know what they're going to do in a scene".&lt;ref name="Buddy"/&gt; While absent, she had landed roles in [[primetime]] series, as well as working in films.&lt;ref name="Buddy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/days-of-our-lives/nadia-bjorlin-discusses-her-re-14652.aspx |title=Nadia Bjorlin Discusses her Return to 'Days of our Lives' |publisher=Buddytv.com |date=2007-12-12 |accessdate=2012-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; She departed again in September 2011, and made her return on January 4, 2013, but departed the role a couple months later on April 16, 2013.

At the school dance in June 2000, she wore a bright red dress and had changed her appearance, stunning everybody.&lt;ref name="G"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wormholeriders.net/Drama/?p=481 |title=Chloe Lane: From Ghoul Girl to Darling Diva &amp;#124; WHR |publisher=Wormholeriders.net |date=2010-08-07 |accessdate=2012-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beauty"&gt;{{cite web|last=Spokane|first=Wash|title=Blackmail Highlights 'Days of our Lives'|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BDozAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=P_IDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6959,5564809&amp;dq=days+of+our+lives+chloe+ghoul+girl&amp;hl=en|work=[[The Spokesman-Review]]|publisher=([[Cowles Publishing Company]])|accessdate=2012-11-11|format=[[Newspaper]]|date=2000-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; A writer of ''[[The Spokesman-Review]]'' newspaper called her a "stunning beauty".&lt;ref name="Beauty"/&gt; [[Michael Logan (journalist)|Michael Logan]] of ''TV Guide'' noted twelve years later in 2012 that: "She's had the craziest trajectory from Ghoul Girl."&lt;ref name="TV Guide"/&gt; In recent times, however, Chloe has diverted far away from her early image and her storylines focus more on her relationships, especially her habit of cheating. In 2010, Bjorlin said: "You know what? Chloe is not a naughty girl! She just makes bad decisions. She is always the one that gets stuck paying the ultimate consequences for her actions. She does not think things through realistically".&lt;ref name="B2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://michaelfairmansoaps.com/days-of-our-lives/the-shawn-christian-and-nadia-bjorlin-interview-days-of-our-lives/2010/10/15/ |title=The Shawn Christian and Nadia Bjorlin Interview – ''Days of Our Lives'' |work=[[Michael Fairman On-Air On-Soaps]] |date=2010-10-15 |accessdate=2012-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soap opera journalist Michael Fairman noted that Chloe tends to befriend women who have done her wrong, such as [[Nicole Walker]] ([[Arianne Zucker]]) and [[Carly Manning]] ([[Crystal Chappell]]), to which Bjorlin responded: "At least Carly was horrible within reason, but Nicole I don’t understand.  It sort of adds to the fact that Chloe in her last few years, was being written like such a push-over and naïve. I am trying to see that she tries to see the best in all people and everyone makes mistakes."&lt;ref name="B2"/&gt; When asked in 2009 who she would like to see Chloe possibly paired with, Bjorlin said [[E.J. DiMera]] ([[James Scott (actor)|James Scott]]), stating: "I've had a lot of fun with the whole Chloe and Philip and Chloe and Brady thing, but you know I think it would be kind of fun to create some controversy and stir things up. Maybe a Chloe and EJ thing".&lt;ref name="M9"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soaps.sheknows.com/daysofourlives/news/id/1842/Days_of_our_Lives_Nadia_Bjorlin_Soap_Cruise_2009_I/ |title=Days of our Lives' Nadia Bjorlin Soap Cruise 2009 Interview! - Days of Our Lives News - Soaps.com |publisher=Soaps.sheknows.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brady Black and Philip Kiriakis===
Despite her being hated at school, she developed a romance with Philip. After their first kiss, she was appalled to find out that he only invited her to the dance because he lost a bet.&lt;ref name="G"/&gt; During this time, she found herself falling in love with [[Brady Black]] ([[Kyle Lowder]]), though still dating Philip.&lt;ref name="G"/&gt; She suspected that Philip's father, [[Victor Kiriakis]] ([[John Aniston]]) was using Brady to break up her romance with Philip; Philip also too suspected this and warned Brady to stay away from Chloe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cooper|first=Mary Ann|title=Chloe Suspects That Victor Is Using Brady to Break Her and Philip Up|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=oxFOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=if0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6650,6132052&amp;dq=days+of+our+lives+chloe+and+brady+married&amp;hl=en|work=[[The Ledger]]|publisher=([[Halifax Media Group]])|accessdate=2012-11-11|date=2001-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; After her relationship with Philip ended she eventually became involved with Brady. They married in 2005; however, shortly after their marriage was destroyed because of Brady's drug addiction. When she returned in 2007, many thought it might have been her fault. In 2008, they divorced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soapcentral.com/days/whoswho/brady.php |title=About DAYS: Who's Who in Salem &amp;#124; Brady Black &amp;#124; Days of our Lives @ |publisher=[[SoapCentral]] |date= |accessdate=2012-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of this storyline, Bjorlin said: "I personally was kind of glad that they didn’t take it in the approach that Chloe had done something, that it was Chloe’s fault or that Chloe killed him or had been unfaithful or whatever it may have been. I’m sort of glad that in the best manner they could, they didn’t really taint the relationship in that sense and they left the characters with integrity."&lt;ref name="M9" /&gt; In 2003, Philip was re-cast with [[Kyle Brandt]], who remained in the role in 2006. Upon Bjorlin's own return to the series in 2007, Johnson had returned to the role. Of this, Bjorlin stated that it was easy for her to fall right back into place as far as Philip and Chloe's relationship goes: "It's sort of undeniable. Jay and I have always had a really great time working together. We sometimes can't keep it together and be serious, especially now that Philip is so serious.  He's a man now, so angry and stern. We'll start cracking up and we can't stop laughing."&lt;ref name="Buddy"/&gt; She again said in 2009: "I think there’s such a camaraderie and trust and respect between both of us that’s been built for years that we truly enjoy working with each other".&lt;ref name="M9"/&gt;

===Daniel Jonas and infidelity ===
[[File:ShawnChristianMay09.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Shawn Christian (''pictured'') plays Daniel Jonas.]]
Chloe began romancing [[Lucas Roberts]] ([[Bryan Dattilo]]) after the demise of his relationship with [[Sami Brady]] ([[Alison Sweeney]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Fodder Network |url=http://www.tvfodder.com/days/archives/2008/07/days_of_our_lives_chloe_blames.shtml |title=Days of Our Lives: Chloe Blames Herself for Lucas Going Back to Jail |publisher=Tvfodder.com |date=2008-07-11 |accessdate=2012-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[New Year's Eve]] of 2008, they became engaged. She cheated on Lucas with [[Daniel Jonas|Dr. Daniel Jonas]] ([[Shawn Christian]]) and soon went into a coma after being poisoned by [[Kate Roberts (Days of our Lives)|Kate Roberts]] ([[Lauren Koslow]]), Lucas' mother. Her relationship with Daniel was popular with viewers, labeled as "Danloe".&lt;ref name="B2"/&gt; She awakened and her brief marriage to Lucas ended. She became involved with Daniel, but ended up cheating on him too. Chloe—after being duped by Vivian Alamain into thinking Daniel and Carly were having an affair—had a [[one-night stand]] with Philip while they were drunk and she ended up pregnant. Of this, Bjorlin stated: "She probably did not deal with her grief in the most appropriate way possible. Chloe does crazy things".&lt;ref name="B2"/&gt; Carly, feeling guilty because Chloe's being duped into thinking her and Daniel were having an affair as a cruel attempt on VIvian's part to get Chloe to kill Carly, agreed to help Chloe secretly obtain a [[DNA]] test. Chloe came to form a friendship with Carly. Bjorlin said of their friendship: "I was feeling slightly juvenile for awhile {{sic}} just spewing venom on her. It is nice that we formed this friendship."&lt;ref name="B2"/&gt;

Michael Fairman of ''On-Air On-Soaps'' said during his interview with Bjorlin and Christian "Dr. Daniel is becoming a dim-wit!  Can’t he figure something is going on behind his back?". Bjorlin said: "It is kind of hysterical that everybody in Salem knows about this cheating incident except Daniel, at this point."&lt;ref name="B2"/&gt; Because the DNA test had supposedly been switched, Chloe believed herself that Daniel could very well be the baby's father. She said: "[Chloe] got the relief of a lifetime when she found out the baby was Daniel’s.  So she thought, “Now I am going to have my wedding.  Nothing can go wrong."&lt;ref name="B2"/&gt; Chloe gave birth to a son, who she named [[Parker Kiriakis|Parker Jonas]] initially. However, the supposed truth came out at Parker's [[baptism]] in front of family and friends that Philip was Parker's father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=morecoach |url=http://sn.soapnet.go.com/news/article/days-of-our-lives-sneak-peek-week-of-122710 |title=Days of our Lives Sneak Peek: Week of 12/27/10 &amp;#124; SOAPnet |publisher=Sn.soapnet.go.com |date=2010-12-27 |accessdate=2012-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the end of the marriage. Having lost Daniel, Chloe sank into a state of [[post partum depression]] and tried to commit [[suicide]].&lt;ref name="who"/&gt;  Upon returning to Salem in January 2013, she's attempting to reestablish her relationship with Daniel, since it turns out that Parker really is his son.

===2011 departure ===
After four years on June 7, 2011, [[TV Line]] among other sources confirmed that she was to depart once again. Her last air date was September 28, 2011.&lt;ref name="who"/&gt; Bjorlin said of her decision not to renew her contract: "It’s a bittersweet moment for me, but fortunately I have been at these crossroads before, and I’ve always rose to the challenge in everything I pursued {{sic}} I will miss the cast and crew dearly, and they — including [[executive producer]] [[Ken Corday]] — will always be considered family to me. At the same time, I am excited for where this next chapter in my life takes me".&lt;ref name="TVL"&gt;{{cite web|author=Matt Webb Mitovich |url=http://tvline.com/2011/06/07/soaps-scoop-nadia-bjorlins-days-are-over/# |title=Days of Our Lives Loses Another: Nadia Bjorlin |publisher=TVLine |date=2011-06-07 |accessdate=2012-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; While away, Bjorlin worked on the series [[Venice: The Series]] with fellow ''Days'' co-star [[Crystal Chappell]] and also appeared on the [[reality television]] show ''[[Dirty Soap]]'', a series which followed the real lives of soap stars.&lt;ref name="TV Guide"/&gt; She also starred in the film ''Divorce Invitation''. ''Dirty Soap'' provided viewers with insight about her decision to leave the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soapoperadigest.com/content/first-look-dirty-soap|title=First Look at DIRTY SOAP|publisher=SoapOperaDiegst.com |date=August 27, 2011|accessdate=August 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2013 return ===
[[File:Patrika Darbo.jpg|160px|thumb|left|Patrika Darbo ''(pictured)'' plays Chloe's mother [[Nancy Wesley]]. She returned with Chloe in 2013.]]
Bjorlin announced during an interview with ''[[TV Guide]]'' on August 21, 2012, that she would return to the role of Chloe, with her first airdate being January 4, 2013. She began filming in September.&lt;ref name="TV Guide"/&gt; Speaking out about all of the rumors that had circulated, Bjorlin stated: "I find out a lot about myself through reading magazines {{sic}} There was a little bit of talk throughout the year. "Would you ever be interested in returning?" That sort of thing. But never anything concrete {{sic}} Now the timing is right. It's been a year since we've seen Chloe. Hopefully, the audience has forgotten what she was up to."&lt;ref name="TV Guide" /&gt; Speaking of her exit storyline the previous year, Bjorlin said that she herself would have written the character out: "Chloe is so near and dear to my heart and even I would have written her off after that storyline. She was spiraling out of control and the fans had stopped being able to recognize the character. I couldn't recognize her, either! A lot of what made Chloe so lovable — her integrity, her fun, her wit — was gone and I don't blame anyone for dropping her from the show."&lt;ref name="TV Guide"/&gt; She teased the character's return, hinting that she would return as "herself", and will have good self-esteem with a stronger and more confident mentality.&lt;ref name="TV Guide"/&gt;

In addition to Chloe's return to Salem, [[Patrika Darbo]] returned as Nancy, after an eight-year absence. Darbo said that Nancy is "going to be supporting her daughter; whether she’s right or whether she’s gone. Family takes care of family."&lt;ref name="BACK" /&gt; Of working with Bjorlin again, Darbo said they "just fell right back into it."&lt;ref name="BACK"&gt;{{cite web|last=Di Lauro|first=Janet|title=Patrika Darbo from 'Days' to 'Desperate Housewives' and Back|url=http://daysofourlives.about.com/od/ActorInterviews/a/PatrikaDarboInterview.htm|work=[[About.com]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|accessdate=December 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also noted that in the past seven years, "some of the things that happened to Chloe would have happened, if Nancy had been there" and said "However, she’s back now, and she might start taking care of those people who hurt her daughter."&lt;ref name="BACK" /&gt;

==Storylines==
===1999–2005===
Chloe lived in an orphanage for the first fifteen years of her life. [[Nancy Wesley]] ([[Patrika Darbo]]) offered her the chance to move in with her, and Chloe accepted, later learning Nancy is actually her biological mother.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc.com/days-of-our-lives/bios/nadia-bjorlin/ |title=Days of our Lives – Bios – Nadia Bjorlin as Chloe Lane |publisher=Nbc.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally introduced as a brainy "nerd" character with few friends, Chloe hides her incredible beauty behind frumpy clothes and horn-rimmed glasses making her an outsider at Salem High where she is picked on and often referred to as "Ghoul Girl." She becomes friends with [[Shawn-Douglas Brady]] ([[Jason Cook (actor)|Jason Cook]]), and Belle Black. Chloe goes to a dance with the wealthy Philip Kiriakis, at which time she unveils her true appearance, and Philip immediately falls for her. They date until Chloe learns the first date was all because Philip lost a bet with Shawn.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Philip wanting Chloe back, does everything possible to win her back. The two fall in love again, but it is short-lived when Brady Black comes to town. Chloe immediately bonded with Brady over their shared love of the opera. Chloe, still dating Philip, assures him that nothing is going on between them. Brady, and Chloe's relationship begins to grow closer, causing more tension in Philip and Chloe's relationship. Philip attempts to sabotage Brady to make it look like he is a thief, Chloe ends her relationship with him and pursues one with Brady.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Meanwhile, Chloe is diagnosed with [[leukemia]], and with the help of Brady searches for her birth father to provide her with bone marrow. It is ultimately revealed that Nancy's husband Dr. Craig Wesley ([[Kevin Spirtas]]) is Chloe's father, Nancy having given Chloe up for adoption without telling Craig. Chloe survives when her sister, Joy, is born and proves to be a match.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Shortly after, Chloe leaves town to pursue her dream of being an opera singer in June 2003. Her relationship with Brady suffers from it. Brady is about to confront Chloe about ending their relationship, when Chloe is in a horrible car accident, her face was disfigured. Disgusted with her scars, she makes Brady believe she is dead. She does so for many months, until Brady finds out she is alive.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Chloe gets several reconstructive surgeries, restoring her face to its original beauty. Chloe reveals her new face to Brady, at their wedding.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; After they are married, Chloe and Brady move to Vienna so Chloe can once again pursue her passion for opera singing.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

===2007–11===
Chloe returns in 2007, without Brady. She begins to rekindle her friendship with Belle, Shawn, and Philip. Brady comes back to town, revealing that he has a drug addiction, and that is why he and Chloe broke up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://daysofourlives.about.com/od/september2009daysrecaps/a/September142009Recap.htm |title=Monday, September 14 Days of Our Lives Recap - Episode Recap for Soap Opera Days of Our Lives Monday, September 14, 2009 - About.com |publisher=Daysofourlives.about.com |date=2009-09-14 |accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chloe pursues a relationship with Lucas Horton, but it ends when she cheats on him with Daniel Jonas.&lt;ref&gt;SOW: Dr. Dan &amp; Chloe Article 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Chloe eventually began a relationship with Daniel. Daniel and Chloe were engaged, but their relationship was complicated when Daniel's friend, Carly Manning, came to town, and they discovered that Daniel had fathered Carly's daughter, [[Melanie Jonas]] ([[Molly Burnett]]).

The situation was only complicated when Chloe had a hysterical pregnancy and was told that she would probably never have a child. One night, having been tricked by [[Vivian Alamain]] ([[Louise Sorel]]) to think that Carly and Daniel were having an affair, Chloe turned to Philip. The two slept together and when Chloe later learned she was pregnant, she did not know if the father was Daniel or Philip. Test results confirmed Daniel as the baby's father so Chloe didn't tell Daniel about the affair. Chloe married Daniel and gave birth to a son [[Parker Kiriakis|Parker]]. On the day of Parker's baptism, Caroline revealed that she had switched the test results, and that Philip was Parker's father. Daniel was heartbroken and left Chloe. Unable to deal with the pain of losing Daniel, Chloe slipped deep into depression and tried to commit suicide. Social services gave Philip full custody but Philip moved Chloe into the Kiriakis mansion with Parker so they could raise him together.

Chloe's mental health was still fragile and during a drunken rant to Kate, Chloe threatened to take Parker and no one would ever see him again. Fearful that she would make good on her threats, Philip took Parker and moved to Chicago. Chloe tried to get herself together by giving voice lessons to students in Salem and petitioning the court for supervised visits with Parker. Then Chloe met a handsome stranger named [[Quinn Hudson]] (Bren Foster), whom she hooked up with, later finding out that he had taped the encounter and used it to blackmail her into prostitution. Quinn (later revealed to be Vivian’s estranged son) had been hired by Kate Roberts to ruin Chloe's life and keep her away from Parker. However her call girl days end when she was viciously attacked by Gus, Vivian’s manservant-turned-vigilante who was assaulting hookers, putting her into a second coma (although it was shorter this time). When she awoke from the coma she identified Gus and received a sizable reward which gave her the means to move to Chicago, to pursue a more lucrative singing career and work towards regaining custody of her son, Parker.

===2013–===
On January 7, 2013, Chloe returned to Salem and revealed to Daniel that he is actually Parker's father, hoping they could be a family again. When Chloe learned Daniel had moved on with Jennifer she set about trying to break them up. Chloe blackmailed Jennifer into rejecting Daniel, by threatening to keep Daniel from seeing Parker, going so far as to have her mother Nancy take Parker to Brazil, but not telling Daniel, so Jennifer felt she had to publicly reject Daniel and leave the hospital, to protect Daniel from losing access to his son Parker, while never revealing her true feelings. After seeing a passport at Chloe's mother Nancy's place, Daniel figured out Chloe's scheme, with help from Rafe, and reconciled with Jennifer, who also got her job back at the hospital. After that Chloe decided to go back to Chicago, leaving Parker with Daniel.

On August 3, 2015, Chloe returned to Salem when she learned Daniel and Nicole were engaged and she objected to Nicole becoming Parker's stepmother. She ultimately accepted after a talk with Daniel.

In January 2016, Chloe came back to Salem to comfort Nicole after Daniel died in a car accident on New Years Day.

==Career==

===Political career and views===
When Matthews first arrived in Washington, D.C., he worked as an officer with the [[United States Capitol Police]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3080601/|title=American attitude – Hardball with Chris Matthews|work=[[MSNBC]]|first=Chris|last=Matthews|accessdate=2008-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Matthews served on the staffs of four [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic]] Members of Congress, including Senators [[Frank Moss (politician)|Frank Moss]] and [[Edmund Muskie]]. In 1974, Matthews mounted an unsuccessful campaign for  [[Pennsylvania's 4th congressional district]] seat in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] in which he received about 24% of the vote in the primary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=284778|title=PA District 04 – D Primary|work=OurCampaigns.com|date=1974-03-21|accessdate=2008-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matthews was a presidential speechwriter during the [[Carter Administration]], and later worked for six years as Chief of Staff to longtime [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House of Representatives]] [[Tip O'Neill]], playing a direct role in many key political battles with the [[Reagan Administration]].

Matthews has said, "I'm more conservative than people think I am.... I voted for [[George W. Bush|George W.]] in [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000]]."&lt;ref&gt;October 3, 2003, and February 23, 2004, editions of Hardball&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Salon.com]]'' has called him the "most conservative voice" on [[MSNBC]]'s primetime lineup.&lt;ref&gt;Kornacki, Steve (2011-01-21) [http://www.salon.com/news/politics/war_room/2011/01/21/countdown_rip/index.html Is Olbermann the victim of his own success?], ''[[Salon.com]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Matthews has been accused by [[Media Matters for America]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mediamatters.org/items/200505310005|title=Matthews's statements defy conservatives' claims that he is a "liberal Democrat"|first=A|last=S|work=[[Media Matters for America]]|date=2005-05-31|accessdate=2008-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; of having panels of guests that skew to [[political right|the right]] and of supporting [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] in his own questions and comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.prospect.org/web/page.ww?section=root&amp;name=ViewWeb&amp;articleId=11345|title=The Harder He Blows|first=Todd|last=Gitlen|work=[[The American Prospect]]|date=2006-03-23|accessdate=2008-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mediamatters.org/items/200601070003|title=Matthews trumpeted comparatively small Abramoff client donations to Sen.

On the April 14, 2008, edition of ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', Matthews alluded to a possible run for the [[United States Senate]] from [[United States Senate election in Pennsylvania, 2010|Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/04/15/chris-matthews-tells-colb_n_96714.html | title=Chris Matthews Tells Colbert: "I Want To Be A Senator" | publisher=''[[Huffington Post]]'' | date=2008-04-23 | accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On November 28, 2008, Matthews contacted senior staffers of [[Barack Obama]]'s campaign about a possible Senate run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/11/chris-matthews-running-for-pennsylvania.html|title=Chris Matthews Staffing Up for Probable Senate Run in 2010|last=Quinn|first=Sean|work=[[Fivethirtyeight.com]]|date=2008-11-28|accessdate=2008-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/12/04/politics/politico/main4647022.shtml|title=Chris Matthews Inches Toward Senate Run|publisher=[[CBS News]]|work=[[The Politico]]|last=Kraushaar|first=Josh|author2=Michael Calderone|date=2008-12-04|accessdate=2008-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 7, 2009, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that Matthews told his staffers that he would not run for the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/08/business/media/08mathews.html?ref=media|title=Host of 'Hardball' Decides Against Senate Race|last=Carter|first=Bill|date=2009-01-07|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2009-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While discussing proposed [[Health care reform in the United States|healthcare reform]] on the December 17, 2009, edition of ''Hardball'', Matthews stated, "The Republicans will know they have lost.... Let them keep score and it's easy. It's complicated when liberals get to keep score. We're always arguing. Well, I'm a liberal, too."&lt;ref&gt;No Kidding: Chris Matthews Admits, 'I'm a Liberal' {{cite web |url=http://www.thefoxnation.com/chris-matthews/2009/12/18/chris-matthews-im-liberal |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091221065111/http://www.thefoxnation.com/chris-matthews/2009/12/18/chris-matthews-im-liberal |archivedate=2009-12-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title ='Hardball with Chris Matthews' for Thursday, December 17th, 2009| publisher =MSNBC| date =2009-12-18| url =http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/34483277/ns/msnbc_tv-hardball_with_chris_matthews/| accessdate =2009-12-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, at the Democratic National Convention, Matthews predicted that he had "just seen the first black president".&lt;ref name="mrc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.mrc.org/campaign/04/dem_convention.asp|title=Democratic National Convention Coverage – Tell the Truth! 2004 – Media Research Center|website=Archive.mrc.org|date=2004-07-27|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Huffington Post]]'' reported on Matthews' emotional expressions of support for Barack Obama during the 2008 Presidential election, quoting him as saying "I have to tell you, you know, it's part of reporting this case, this election, the feeling most people get when they hear Barack Obama's speech. My, I felt this thrill going up my leg. I mean, I don't have that too often." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/02/13/chris-matthews-i-felt-thi_n_86449.html |title=Chris Matthews: "I Felt This Thrill Going Up My Leg" As Obama Spoke |last=Shea |first=Danny |date=2008-03-28 |website=Huffington Post |language=en-US |access-date=2018-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2011 study, Matthews has a history of making misogynistic comments in his political coverage.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2011|title=What’s in a Name? Coverage of Senator Hillary Clinton during the 2008 Democratic Primary|url=|journal=Political Research Quarterly|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1177/1065912910382302|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that Matthews treated Hillary Clinton worse in the 2008 Democratic primary than any other newsperson.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During the primaries, Matthews depicted her with horns on her head, said that the only reason she was a frontrunner in the primary was because "her husband messed around", said "she didn't win there on merit" and referred to her as a "she-devil".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In March 2012, Chris Matthews described himself as a [[centrist]] during an episode of his [[MSNBC]] talk show ''[[Hardball with Chris Matthews|Hardball]]''. That statement was questioned by ''[[Mediaite]]'''s Josh Feldman directly afterward, based on Matthews' frequent condemnation of right-wing political figures and his emotional expression of support for [[Barack Obama]]'s presidential campaign. Feldman observed that Matthews has criticized liberals such as Hillary Clinton and occasionally even Barack Obama, and that this could explain Matthews' description of himself as a "centrist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaite.com/tv/msnbcs-chris-matthews-says-hes-a-centrist-no-seriously/|title=MSNBC's Chris Matthews Says He's A Centrist. No, Seriously.|website=www.mediaite.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Author and talk show host===
Matthews worked in print media for 15&amp;nbsp;years, spending 13&amp;nbsp;years as Washington, D.C. bureau chief for the ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]'' (1987–2000) and two years as a nationally syndicated columnist for the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''. Matthews covered the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]], the first all-races election in South Africa, and the [[Good Friday Peace Agreement|Good Friday Peace Talks]] in [[Northern Ireland]]. In 1997 and 1998, his research in the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] produced a series of exclusives on the Nixon presidential tapes. Matthews has covered American presidential election campaigns since 1988.

In 1997, Matthews began his own weeknight talk show, ''[[Hardball with Chris Matthews]]'', which originally aired on [[America's Talking]] but is currently on [[MSNBC]]. ''Hardball'' features [[pundit (politics)|pundits]] and elected officials as guests.

''[[The Chris Matthews Show]]'' aired in syndication from 2002 until 2013. The show was formatted as a political roundtable consisting of four journalists and Matthews, who served as the moderator. He is estimated to earn more than $5&amp;nbsp;million a year. He is the author of eight best-selling books:

* ''Bobby Kennedy: A Raging Spirit'' (2017)
* ''Tip and the Gipper: When Politics Worked'' (2013)
* ''Jack Kennedy: Elusive Hero'' (2011)
* ''Life's a Campaign: What Politics Has Taught Me About Friendship, Rivalry, Reputation, and Success'' (2007)
* ''American: Beyond our Grandest Notions'' (2002)
* ''Now, Let Me Tell You What I Really Think'' (2001)
* ''Kennedy &amp; Nixon: The Rivalry that Shaped Postwar America'' (1996)
* ''Hardball: How Politics is Played, Told by One Who Knows the Game'' (1988)

''Elusive Hero'' spent 12&amp;nbsp;weeks on ''[[The New York Times]]''' bestseller list.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2011-11-20/combined-print-and-e-book-nonfiction/list.html|title=Best Sellers – The New York Times|website=Nytimes.com|accessdate=14 January 2014|first=Gregory|last=Cowles}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was lauded by critics. "Matthews excels in capturing the tribalism of the Irish Catholic culture and experience Kennedy both absorbed and overcame as he made his way...[and] is at his best in describing political dynamics," ''[[The Washington Post]]'' said.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2011-11-07/entertainment/35417691_1_matthews-dugard-heroic-tales|title=Book reviews: &amp;lsquo;Killing Lincoln&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Jack Kennedy&amp;rsquo; – The Washington Post|website=Articles.washingtonpost.com|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Matthews proves a compelling storyteller," said ''[[The Boston Globe]]''.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Jack Kennedy: Elusive Hero|author=Matthews, C.|year=2012|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=9781451635096|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kLspqSlNjfYC}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Matthews has produced a valuable addition to the literature about the life and career of our 35th president," said ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]''.&lt;ref name="csmonitor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Books/Book-Reviews/2011/1031/Jack-Kennedy-Elusive-Hero/(page)/2|title=Jack Kennedy: Elusive Hero - CSMonitor.com|website=Csmonitor.com|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Matthews's stirring biography reveals Kennedy as a 'fighting prince never free from pain, never far from trouble, and never accepting the world he found,'" said ''[[Publishers Weekly]]''.&lt;ref name="publishersweekly"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-4516-3508-9|title=Nonfiction Book Review: Jack Kennedy: Elusive Hero  by Chris Matthews|website=Publishersweekly.com|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Matthews announced that he had signed a long-term contract extension with MSNBC but that he would no longer host The Chris Matthews Show in order to focus his efforts on Hardball, writing books, and producing documentaries. The final episode of The Chris Matthews Show aired on July 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Weprin |first=Alex |title=Chris Matthews Inks Long-Term Deal With MSNBC, But Ends 'The Chris Matthews Show'|date=2013-04-30|website=Mediabistro.com |url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/chris-matthews-inks-long-term-deal-with-msnbc-but-ends-the-chris-matthews-show_b177542|accessdate=2013-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual harassment accusation==
In December 2017, several news outlets reported that in 1999, Matthews was accused by a female assistant producer on his program for making inappropriate jokes and comments. He was formally reprimanded by his employer [[CNBC]] and his accuser was awarded a $40,000 separation package settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MSNBC’s Chris Matthews was reprimanded over comments about woman in 1999: report|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/msnbc-s-chris-matthews-was-reprimanded-over-comments-about-woman-n830471|publisher=NBC News|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

His brother [[Jim Matthews (politician)|Jim Matthews]], a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], is a former county commissioner in [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania]].

In 2002, Matthews was hospitalized with [[malaria]], which he evidently contracted on one of his visits that year to Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Petrozzello|first=Donna|title=Matthews Hospitalized With Malaria|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2002-07-24/entertainment/18213200_1_malaria-tropics-and-subtropics-hardball|accessdate=October 23, 2012|location=New York|newspaper=Daily News|date=24 July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He has also had other health problems, including [[diabetes]] (which he acknowledged having on the ''Hardball'' broadcast of December 7, 2009) and [[pneumonia]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Hardball with Chris Matthews]]'', [[MSNBC]], August 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Matthews is a lifelong [[Philadelphia Phillies]] fan, which he claims as "part of his soul".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tampabay.com/features/popculture/know-your-phamous-phillies-phans/864985|date=October 21, 2008|first=Jay|last=Cridlin|newspaper=[[Tampa Bay Times]]|accessdate=February 26, 2017|title="I think I'm just a Phillies fan in my soul," he told the Washington Post.

'''David Walsh''' (11 August 1945 – 4 June 1998) was a Canadian businessman in the oil and gas and mining industries.

==Biography==
Walsh was founder and CEO of the [[Canada|Canadian]] [[mining]] company [[Bre-X]], which was involved in one of the largest [[stock market]] scandals in Canadian history. Although Walsh had been oblivious to or dismissive of warning signs before the outbreak of the scandal, he called in RCMP investigators once the fraud was identified, and assisted the RCMP in their criminal investigation.  Before the Bre-X fraud, Walsh had run several successful oil and gas companies with properties throughout the United States and Canada and been a stock broker, trust company officer, and portfolio manager.  In 1998 he died of an apparent [[aneurysm]] suffered at his home in the [[Bahamas]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Reuters]] (5 June 1998).

==In popular culture==
*The Bre-X scandal inspired the 2016 film ''[[Gold (2016 film)|Gold]]'', in which [[Matthew McConaughey]] plays Kenny Wells, who is based on Walsh.

The '''Dogras''' are an [[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]] ethno-linguistic group in [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] consisting of the [[Dogri]] language speakers. [[Dogra Rajput]]s ruled Jammu from the 19th century, when Gulab Singh was made a hereditary Raja of Jammu by the Sikh Emperor Maharaja Ranjit Singh, till Oct 1947. Through the [[Treaty of Amritsar (1846)]], they acquired Kashmir as well. They live predominantly in the Jammu region of [[Jammu and Kashmir]], and in adjoining areas of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], and northeastern Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webindia123.com/jammu/People/Peoplejammu.htm |title=People of Jammu-Dogras of Jammu |publisher=Webindia123.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Brahmin Dogras are predominantly [[Saraswat Brahmin]]s, genetically of common origin with Saraswat Brahmins of Kashmir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=6bQGPv0AAAAJ&amp;cstart=20&amp;citation_for_view=6bQGPv0AAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C|title=Genetic polymorphisms for 17 Y-chromosomal STR haplotypes in Jammu and Kashmir Saraswat Brahmin population.

The [[Dogra Regiment]] and the [[Punjab Regiment (India)|Punjab Regiment]] of the [[Indian Army]] primarily consists of Dogras and [[Sikhs]].&lt;ref name="globalsecurity1"&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/india/rgt-punjab.htm |title=Punjab Regiment |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term Dogra is thought to derive from ''Durgara'', the name of a kingdom mentioned in an eleventh century copper-plate inscription in [[Chamba State|Chamba]]. The inscription mentions the Raja of Chamba facing an attack by Kiras aided by the Lord of Durgara (''durgāreśwara''). In medieval times the term ''Durgar'' is believed to have turned into ''Dugar'', eventually transforming to "Dogra". Kalhana's ''[[Rajatarangini]]'' makes no mention of a kingdom by any of these names, but the kingdoms could have been referred to by their capital cities (such as ''Vallapura'', modern [[Billawar]], or ''Babbapura'', modern Babor). In modern times, the term Dogra turned into an ethnic identity, claimed by all those people that speak the [[Dogri language]], irrespective of their religion.{{sfn|Handa, Textiles, Costumes, and Ornaments of the Western Himalaya|1998|pp=178–179}}

==History==
Scholar Omachanda Handa believes that the Durgara people were originally migrants from Rajasthan to the [[Terai]] belt, similar to the [[Gurjaras]] (or "Gujjars"). The allusion to ''durg'' (fort) in their name indicates that they may have remained a warrior people, eventually founding powerful kingdoms between [[Chenab River|Chenab]] and [[Ravi River|Ravi]], and possibly dominating up to the [[Sutlej River|Sutluj]] river.{{sfn|Handa, Textiles, Costumes, and Ornaments of the Western Himalaya|1998|pp=178–180}}

According to [[M. A. Stein]], there were some eleven Dogra states in the region, all of which were eventually absorbed into the [[Jammu]] state, which emerged as the most powerful among them.{{sfn|Stein, Kalhana's Rajatarangini|1900|p=432}} Prior to the rise of Jammu, Babbapura (Babor) is expected to have been the chief state of Dogras. Lying 45 km east of Jammu, Babor contains the ruins of six magnificent temples representing a "thriving artistic activity".&lt;ref name="Saraf1987"&gt;{{citation |last=Saraf |first=D. N. |title=Arts and Crafts, Jammu and Kashmir: Land, People, Culture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vQShV9jNzIUC&amp;pg=PA198 |year=1987 |publisher=Abhinav Publications |ISBN=978-81-7017-204-8 |pages=198–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://jammutourism.gov.in/MonumentHeritage-Babor-Temple.html Babor Temple], Directorate of Tourism, Jammu, retrieved 25 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rajatarangini]] mentions the Raja Vajradhara of Babbapura, vowing allegiance to Bhikshachara of Kashmir in 1120 AD, along with the chiefs of neighbouring kingdoms.{{sfn|Charak &amp; Billwaria, Pahāṛi Styles of Indian Murals|1998|pp=6–7}}

==The Jammu region==
The Jammu region, one of the three regions of Jammu and Kashmir state (the others being the [[Kashmir Valley]] and [[Ladakh]]), is bound on the north by the [[Pir Panjal]] Range of the middle [[Himalayas]], in the south by Punjab, to the east by Ladakh, and close to the west by Pakistan. The lower Himalayan ranges begin behind the town of Jammu, which rests on a slope over {{convert|1300|ft}} above sea level, overlooking and commanding the plain watered by the [[Chenab]], [[Ravi River|Ravi]], [[Tawi River|Tawi]] and [[Ujh River|Ujh]] rivers. The Jammu region consists of ten districts: [[Jammu]], [[Kathua]], [[Udhampur]], [[Doda]], [[Poonch]], [[Kishtwar]], [[Reasi]], [[Samba, Jammu|Samba]], [[Ramban district|Ramban]] and [[Rajouri]]. The city of Jammu is the winter capital of the state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]].

The Jammu Dogras traditionally inhabited the area between the slopes of the [[Sivalik Hills|Shivalik range]] of mountains, the sacred lakes of Saroien sar and Mannsar but later spread over whole of Jammu region. They generally speak Dogri and other dialects similar to Dogri. The majority of the Dogra are followers of [[Hindu]]ism, but a large number in Jammu and Kashmir believe in other religions. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, some Dogras embraced [[Islam]]. These factors, together with the effects of immigration into the region, have resulted in the Dogra population of Jammu and Kashmir including members of all three religions. 

The [[Dogra dynasty|Dogra Raj]] emerged as a regional power, particularly after Maharaja [[Gulab Singh]] emerged as a warrior and his subjects received special martial recognition from the [[British Raj]]. The rule of Gulab Singh's Raj extended over the whole of the Jammu Region, a large part of the Ladakh region as early as March 1846, and a large part of the Indian Punjab (now [[Himachal Pradesh]]). The [[Kashmir Valley]] was handed over to Gulab Singh by the British government, for assisting the British during the Anglo-Sikh wars, as part of the territories ceded to the British government by Lahore State according to the provisions of Article IV of the [[Treaty of Lahore]] dated 9{{nbsp}}March 1846. Under the [[Treaty of Amritsar, 1846|Treaty of Amritsar]] in the same year, the Dogra king of Jammu and the state was thereafter known as the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir State (Raj), also thereafter referred as Kashmir State. The term Dogra hence is more akin to the subjects of Himachal Pradesh, some areas of Punjab and the whole region of Jammu that was ruled by Raja Gulab Singh as part of the Dogra Raj irrespective of the religion of the inhabitants.

==The Royal House of Jammu and Kashmir (Dogra dynasty)==
{{main|The Royal House of Jammu and Kashmir}}
[[Dogra dynasty]] was a dynasty of [[Hindu]] [[Rajputs]] who ruled [[Jammu &amp; Kashmir]] from 1846 to 1947. They traced their ancestry to the [[Ikshvaku dynasty|Ikshvaku]] (Solar) Dynasty of [[Northern India]] (the same clan in which [[Lord Rama]] was born; he, therefore, is the 'kuldevta' (family deity) of the Dogras). 
[[File:Gulabsingh1840.jpg|thumb|[[Gulab Singh]], the first Maharaja of [[Dogra dynasty|Dogra Rajput dynasty]] which ruled [[Jammu &amp; Kashmir]].]]
[[File:Sir Hari Singh Bahadur, Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir, 1944.jpg|thumb|[[Maharaja Hari Singh]], the last monarch of [[Dogra dynasty|Dogra Rajput dynasty]] which ruled [[Jammu &amp; Kashmir]].]]

Among the enlightened rulers of Jammu was Raja Ranjit Dev (1728–1780) who introduced certain social reforms such as a ban on '[[Sati (practice)|Sati]]' (immolation of the wife on the funeral pyre of the husband) and female infanticide. Later, under [[Ranjit Singh|Maharaja Ranjit Singh]], the state became part of the [[Sikh Empire]] of the [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] after it was captured from its Afghan rulers. Ranjit Singh rendered this state to his general, [[Maharaja Gulab Singh Jamwal]], who belonged to the Jamwal Rajput clan that ruled Jammu. He extended the boundaries of Jammu to western Tibet with the help of General Zorawar Singh. 

The Sikh Empire rule extended beyond the Jammu Region and the [[Kashmir Valley]] to the Tibetan Buddhist Kingdom of [[Ladakh]] and the Emirates of [[State of Hunza|Hunza]], [[Gilgit Agency|Gilgit]] and [[State of Nagar|Nagar]]. After the [[First Anglo-Sikh War]] in 1846, the British gave Kashmir and the title of 'Maharaja' to [[Gulab Singh]] — the chief minister —  as a reward for aligning with them against the [[Sikhs]].&lt;ref&gt;Nalwa, V., 2009.

==Culture==

===Dogra cuisine===

[[Wheat]], [[maize]] and [[Pearl millet|bajra]] are staple food besides rice, cereals and a tangier preparation made out of mango or tamarind popularly known as ''maani''. The whole dish is called ''dal puth maani'' and is savoured as a combination. ''Mitha madra'' is a favourite and is cooked from milk, dry fruits, and semolina. Preparations of ''rajmash'' (a special variety of red kidney beans); ''auria'' a dish of curd fermented by rye; ''ambal'' made from pumpkin, jaggery and tamarind are favourites, especially during ceremonial cooking. The expert cooks are called ''Siyans'', usually [[Brahmins]]. ''Kalari'' is a milk preserved by cogulation of proteins and then fried in a pan to make it delicious.&lt;ref&gt;angurana&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-vegetarian food was limited to Rajputs and Vaish (Mahajans). 'Khatta meat' is mutton cooked with sour pomegranate seeds (Anardana) or lime juice and flavoured with fumes of a burning charcoal soaked in mustard oil. Keur is one of the well known foods of Dogras. It is prepared by flour and butter and served with sugar and curd. Mostly, it is served to bridegroom at the time of marriage by the in-laws. Kalaari is a favourite food of Dogras in the rainy season. It is prepared by flour mix, cottage cheese and milk cream (malai) with water with help of a small cup shaped pot. Kalari is served with milk. [[Kalari cheese]] is popular in the Jammu region and in Jammu and Kashmir state more generally. Babbru/pathoru are prepared with flour and fried in mustard oil. Babbru is served with maani/potato/kheer/curd.

[[Kheer]] is a dish prepared from milk by adding some rice and dry fruit in it. It is served at all the special occasions and festivals. Another popular exotic dish is ''guchiyyan'' (dried black [[morel]]), usually added as an ingredient in pulao. As it grows naturally in forests and cannot be cultivated, it is a priced commodity (approx 500 Rs. per 100&amp;nbsp;g) and makes an excelled dish with mountain potatoes (pahadi aloo). [[Saffron]] or kesar is extensively used to flavour sweet dishes and for its anti-oxidant benefits.&lt;ref name="dt"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.duggartimes.com |title=Index of / |publisher=Duggartimes.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117181654/http://www.duggartimes.com/ |archivedate=17 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military history===

The [[Dogra Regiment]] was among the regiments of the [[British Indian Army]], which made significant contributions in both the world wars on all fronts from [[East Asia]] to [[Europe]] and [[North Africa]]. At Independence, it became an infantry regiment of the [[Indian Army]] composed largely but not exclusively of the Dogra people. The [[Jammu and Kashmir Rifles]], another regiment of the Indian Army, consisting of mainly Dogras was formed out of the former army of the Kingdom of Jammu &amp; Kashmir after it was absorbed into the Indian Army.&lt;ref name="dt"/&gt;

'''Dorothy, Lady Pakington''' (1623 – 10 May 1679) was an [[England|English]] friend and supporter of learned clergymen, and a writer of religious works. She was for many years reputed to be the author of ''[[The Whole Duty of Man]]''. She enjoyed the esteem and friendship of the most eminent divines of her time. Dr. [[Henry Hammond]] resided at her home for several years.{{sfn|Williams (called Ysgafell.)|1861|p=116-17}}

==Early years== 
Dorothy Coventry was born in or near [[London]] about the middle of the reign of [[James I]].{{sfn|Craik|1847|p=68}} She was the daughter of [[Thomas Coventry, 1st Baron Coventry|Sir Thomas Coventry]], the [[Lord Keeper of the Great Seal|Lord Keeper]],{{sfn|Williams (called Ysgafell.)|1861|p=116-17}} and his second wife, Elizabeth (1583–1653), daughter of John Aldersey of Spurstow, Cheshire, and widow of William Pitchford. 

==Career==
She married [[Sir John Pakington, 2nd Baronet]] (1621–1680), of Westwood, Worcestershire. The couple had at least three surviving children: one son and two daughters.{{sfn|Virtue and Company|1875|p=270}}

A fervent royalist, Dorothy Pakington wrote manuscript prayers, and shared in the circulation of religious and philosophical manuscripts in the group of clergymen around the king's chaplain, [[Henry Hammond]]. The extent of her reputation is shown by the fact that contemporaries believed her the author of ''[[The Whole Duty of Man]]''. Although [[George Ballard (biographer)|George Ballard]] defended this attribution, modern scholars instead follow two nineteenth-century writers — [[Richard Harris Barham|Richard Barham]] and [[C. E. Doble]] — who attributed the work to Hammond's friend [[Richard Allestree]]. She led a retired life, and devoted herself to learning, piety, and good works. She was the author of several religious books: ''The Gentleman’s Calling'', ''The Lady’s Calling'', ''The Government of the Tongue'', ''The Christian’s Birthright'', and ''The Causes of the Decay of Christian Piety''.{{sfn|Williams (called Ysgafell.)|1861|p=116-17}}

Pakington died 10 May 1679.{{sfn|Williams (called Ysgafell.)|1861|p=116-17}}

'''Edward Oxford''' (19 April 1822 &amp;ndash; 23 April 1900) was the first of seven&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/eight-assassination-attempts-queen-victoria-just-made-her-more-powerful-180963428/| title=The Eight Assassination Attempts on Queen Victoria Just Made Her More Powerful| author= Kat Eschner|  publisher=Smithsonian| accessdate=2018-06-22}} (Note: there were eight attempts because one man, [[John Francis (assassin)|John Francis]], tried twice.)&lt;/ref&gt; people who tried to assassinate [[Queen Victoria]]. After Oxford was arrested and charged with [[treason]], a jury found that Oxford was [[Insanity defense|not guilty by reason of insanity]] and he was detained at Her Majesty's pleasure in the [[Bethlem Royal Hospital|State Criminal Lunatic Asylum]] and later, in [[Broadmoor Hospital]]. Eventually given conditional release for [[Penal transportation|transportation]] to a British colony, he lived out the remainder of his life in [[Australia]].

==Early life==

Edward was born in [[Birmingham]] in 1822, the third of Hannah Marklew and George Oxford's seven children. His father, a [[Repoussé and chasing|gold chaser]], died when he was seven. His mother was able to find work and support the family, which meant Edward was able to attend school both in Birmingham and the [[Lambeth]] area of [[London]], where the family moved when he was about 10. When Oxford left school, he first took bar work with his aunt in [[Hounslow]], then in other [[public house]]s as a pot boy, or waiter.&lt;ref name="Stevens"&gt;{{cite book |author=Stevens, Mark |title=Broadmoor Revealed: Some patient stories |publisher=Berkshire Record Office |year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.1}}  At the time of the attack he was barely eighteen years old, unemployed and living with his mother and sister in lodgings in [[Camberwell]], having recently quit his job at the Hog-in-the-Pound in [[Oxford Street]]. Since his mother had returned to Birmingham on a regular trip to see family over a month before, Oxford was, in effect, living alone at the time of the event.&lt;ref name="Stevens"/&gt;

==The assassination attempt==

On 4 May 1840, he bought a pair of pistols for £2, as well as a [[Powder flask|gunpowder flask]], and began practising in various [[shooting range|shooting galleries]] in [[Leicester Square]], the [[Strand, London|Strand]] and the [[West End of London|West End]]. A week before the attack, he went into a Lambeth shop owned by a former schoolmate named Gray and bought fifty copper [[percussion cap]]s, and enquired where he could buy some bullets and three-pennies' worth of gunpowder.&lt;ref name="Wilton"&gt;{{cite web|last=Milton|first=Giles|title=Killing Queen Victoria: How (Not) To Shoot A Monarch|url=http://surviving-history.blogspot.com.au/2013/06/killing-queen-victoria-how-not-to-shoot.html|work=surviving-history.blogspot.com.au|accessdate=6 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gray sold him the powder, and told him where he could find the ammunition. On the evening of 9 June he showed several witnesses what appeared to be a loaded pistol; when he was asked what he planned to do with it, he refused to say, other than stating that he had been firing at a target.&lt;ref name="The Newgate Calendar"&gt;[http://www.exclassics.com/newgate/ng630.htm The Newgate Calendar]&lt;/ref&gt;

At about 4:00 PM on 10 June 1840, Oxford took up a position on a footpath at [[Constitution Hill, London|Constitution Hill]], near [[Buckingham Palace]]. The Queen, who was four months pregnant with her [[Victoria, Princess Royal|first child]], was accustomed to riding out in a [[Phaeton (carriage)|phaeton]], or low, open horse-drawn carriage, with her husband, [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] in the late afternoon or early evening, with no other escort than two outriders.&lt;ref name="The Newgate Calendar"/&gt;  When the royal couple appeared some two hours later and drew level with him, he fired both pistols in succession, missing both times. He was immediately seized by onlookers and disarmed. Oxford made no attempt to hide his actions, openly declaring: "It was I, it was me that did it."&lt;ref name="Stevens"/&gt;{{rp|p.2}}

He was immediately arrested and charged with [[treason]] for attempting to assassinate the [[monarch|sovereign]]. When he was taken into custody at the police station he asked if the Queen was hurt; he was informed she was unharmed. When he was asked if the pistols had been loaded, he said they were. After his arrest, his lodgings were searched and a locked box was found containing a sword and scabbard, two pistol-bags, powder, a [[cast bullet|bullet-mould]], five lead balls, some of the percussion caps bought from Gray,&lt;ref name="Wilton" /&gt; and the intricate rules and proceedings of an imaginary military society called "Young England" (not to be confused with the later conservative [[Young England|political group]] of the same name), complete with a list of made-up officers and correspondence.&lt;ref name="The Newgate Calendar"/&gt;  Members were to be armed with a brace of pistols, a sword, a rifle and a dagger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jsp?id=t18400706-1877&amp;div=t18400706-1877 The Proceedings of the Old Bailey]&lt;/ref&gt;

Oxford's trial at the [[Old Bailey]] was postponed until 9 July, after a thorough investigation was made of both his background and his possible motives. In spite of his earlier admissions, no bullets could be found at the scene, so that the Crown could not prove that the pistols were, in fact, armed and that he could have harmed anyone. Oxford later claimed that the guns contained only gunpowder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Charles, Barrie |title=Kill the Queen! The Eight Assassination Attempts on Queen Victoria |publisher=Amberley Publishing |year=2012 |isbn=978-1-4456-0457-2 |page=23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oxford appeared to be oblivious for most of the proceedings. The prosecution presented much eyewitness evidence, while the defence case consisted of various family members and friends who testified that Oxford had always seemed of unsound mind, and that both his grandfather and father were alcoholics who had exhibited signs of mental illness. This carried a great deal of weight, as it was thought during this time that both drink and hereditary influence were strong causal factors for insanity. Oxford's mother testified her late husband had been violent and intimidating, and that her son was not only prone to fits of hysterical laughter and emitting strange noises, he had been obsessed with firearms since he was a child. Various eminent pathologists and physicians testified that due to "brain disease" or other factors, such as the shape of his head, Oxford was either a mental imbecile or simply incapable of controlling himself.&lt;ref name="Stevens"/&gt;{{rp|p.4}}

==Commitment==
[[File:Edward Oxford c 1856.jpg|thumb|Edward Oxford, photographed by Henry Hering c. 1856]]
The following day, the jury acquitted Oxford, declaring him to be "[[not guilty by reason of insanity]]". Like all such prisoners, he was sentenced to be detained "until Her Majesty's pleasure be known". In effect, this was an indefinite sentence, and the source of the asylum term "pleasure men". Oxford was sent to the [[Bethlem Royal Hospital|State Criminal Lunatic Asylum]] in Bethlem, [[Southwark]], where he remained as a model patient for the next twenty-four years. During that time he occupied himself by drawing, reading and learning to play the violin; the Bethlem doctors reported that he could play [[draughts]] and chess better than any other patient,&lt;ref name="Stevens"/&gt;{{rp|p.5}} He also learnt French, German and Italian to a degree of fluency, acquired some knowledge of Spanish, Greek and Latin, and was employed as a painter and decorator within the confines of the hospital. When he was transferred to [[Broadmoor Hospital]] in 1864,&lt;ref&gt;Broadmoor Hospital case file: Berkshire Record Office D/H14/D2/2/1/96&lt;/ref&gt; the notes taken on his arrival describe him as "apparently sane". He still claimed the pistols he fired at the Queen were not loaded with anything other than powder, and that his attack was fuelled not by a desire to injure her, but purely by a desire for notoriety.&lt;ref name="Stevens"/&gt;{{rp|p.6}}

Oxford continued to be orderly and well-behaved at Broadmoor, working as a wood grainer and painter. While it was clear to the hospital's governors that Oxford was of sound mind and no longer a threat to society, George Grey, the current [[Home Secretary]], ignored the request to order his release. It is possible that since he had been the Judge Advocate General at the time of Oxford's trial, he could have been reluctant to discharge a prisoner he once had such a vested interest in incarcerating.  It was not until three years later that a new Home Secretary offered to discharge Oxford, on the condition that he leave for one of the Empire's overseas colonies, and, if he returned to the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], he would be incarcerated for life.&lt;ref name="Stevens"/&gt;{{rp|p.7}}

==Later life==

Oxford lived out the rest of his life in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]. Oxford landed in Melbourne with a new alias, John Freeman. Setting out to reform himself and become a respectable citizen, Freeman became a house painter and joined the West Melbourne Mutual Improvement Society. In 1881 he married a widow with two children, and became a church warden at [[St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne|St Paul's Cathedral]]. Under the pseudonym "Liber" he wrote articles for ''[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]]'' about the city's slums, markets and racetracks, and these became the basis for an 1888 book, ''Lights and Shadows of Melbourne Life.'' Freeman died in 1900.

His patient record at Broadmoor includes a letter sent in 1883 by George Haydon, a Steward at Bethlem, to Dr. David Nicolson. It includes an article from ''[[The Age]]'', a Melbourne newspaper, which reports that on 4 May 1880, a "John" Oxford, identified as the man who shot at the Queen many years ago, and who had subsequently been a patient in an asylum before he was discharged to Australia, had recently been convicted of stealing a shirt and spent a week in jail. Upon his release, the prison governor requested the police to keep an eye on him, "in consequence of the old man’s eccentric conduct". The police subsequently arrested Oxford for vagrancy, and he was reportedly remanded for further medical examination. There were no further updates to the record.&lt;ref name="Stevens"/&gt;{{rp|p.8}} It is not certain that this person was Edward Oxford.

The connection between Oxford and "John Freeman" was established by F. B. Smith's 1987 article "Lights and Shadows in the Life of John Freeman".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Smith, F. B. |title=Lights and Shadows in the Life of John Freeman |journal=Victorian Studies |volume=30 |number=4, Summer |date=1987 |pages=459–473 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Freeman wrote several letters to Haydon, beginning in 1888 and apparently ceasing on Haydon's death in 1889. Freeman's wife and stepchildren appear to have been totally ignorant that he might be anyone other than John Freeman. Additionally, a photograph of John Freeman taken for the 1888 Centennial Exhibition in Melbourne &lt;ref&gt;Victorian archives, VPRO 840 P0000/2&lt;/ref&gt; matches a portrait of Oxford held in the archives of the Bethlem aslyum.&lt;ref&gt;Bethlem Royal Hospital Archives&lt;/ref&gt; Freeman's correspondence to Haydon was donated to the National Library in the 1950s by the family. Stevens points out that the former Steward contributed nothing more to Oxford's Broadmoor record about his progress beyond the troubling report published in the newspaper, and never confirmed that Oxford was the author of Freeman's book. This may have been because Haydon was departing Bethlem at the time he began receiving the letters.

==Aftermath==

Despite the historical precedent of the insanity defence, Queen Victoria represented popular opinion when she remained morally convinced that Oxford and other malefactors who came after him were perfectly cognisant of their actions. She was furious when [[Daniel M'Naghten]], who attempted to assassinate Prime Minister [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel]] and instead killed his private secretary, was acquitted in 1843. When [[Roderick McLean]] attempted to shoot her on the [[Windsor &amp; Eton Central railway station|Windsor railway platform]] forty years later and was sent to Broadmoor, her response was to demand of Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]] that the law be changed to "guilty but insane", to better accommodate her unwavering belief that if Oxford had only been hanged at the outset, his death would have acted as a deterrent to other potential regicides:
{{quote|Punishment deters not only sane men but also eccentric men, whose supposed involuntary acts are really produced by a diseased brain capable of being acted upon by external influence. A knowledge that they would be protected by an acquittal on the grounds of insanity will encourage these men to commit desperate acts, while on the other hand certainty that they will not escape punishment will terrify them into a peaceful attitude towards others.| 
''Unpublished correspondence of HM Victoria to Prime Minister Gladstone, 23 April 1882''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Walker, N. |title=Crime and insanity in England, Volume I: The historical perspective |location=Edinburgh |publisher=University of Edinburgh Press |year=1978 |page=189 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A contemporary reference to Oxford appears in [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[The Old Curiosity Shop]]'', the novel that Dickens was writing during the months before and after the attempted regicide. Although Dickens took a strong interest in the case, Oxford appears not in Dickens's text, which was serialised in his weekly publication, ''[[Master Humphrey's Clock]]'', but in one of the novel's accompanying illustrations, rendered by [[Hablot Knight Browne|Hablot K. Browne]], popularly known as "Phiz".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Murphy, Paul |title=Shooting Victoria |publisher=Pegasus Books |year=2012 |isbn=978-1-6059-8354-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an illustration for Chapter 28, Mrs. Jarley, the proprietress of a waxworks, is shown training the heroine, Little Nell, to be a guide. Although the novel is set some fifteen years before 1840, Browne was no doubt inspired by [[Madame Tussauds]]' London waxworks, where the exhibit of Edward Oxford was a star attraction for that year, to create a contemporary reference. His caricature of the would-be assassin as a wide-eyed, imbecilically grinning youth, clutching a flintlock pistol in his right hand and a pot of beer in his left, with a sheet of paper labelled “Young England” spilling out of his pocket, was easily identifiable by anyone at the time. In the direct line of fire behind him sits a calmly serene Queen Victoria, dressed in her 1838 coronation robes and holding the orb and sceptre. While Oxford's pistol may be pointing in her direction, "Phiz" reassuringly depicts the sovereign as literally far above her attacker, serenely and majestically removed from the lunatic's threat.

Oxford is a major character in [[Mark Hodder]]'s 2010 novel, ''[[The Strange Affair of Spring-Heeled Jack]]'', in which one of his descendants also named Edward Oxford from the year 2202 travels back in time to stop his ancestor from even attempting the act.

[[Samuel Warren (British lawyer)|Samuel Warren]] is believed to have used Oxford as a model for his portrait of the shallow, dissolute youth Titbat Tittlemouse in his popular novel 'Ten Thousand a Year'.

Edward Oxford, "Young England" and the assassination attempt are plot elements in David Morrell's 2015 novel, "Inspector of the Dead", which takes place 15 years after the attempt.  In the novel, the second in his [[Thomas de Quincy]] series, his detective Inspector Ryan is identified as having been one of the constables on the scene at the time of the attempt.

==In other media==

In 2009 an inaccurate version of the assassination attempt was portrayed in ''[[The Young Victoria]]''. While Oxford (played by Josef Altin) is shown firing twice on the royal couple, Prince Albert ([[Rupert Friend]]) throws himself in front of Victoria ([[Emily Blunt]]) and is wounded by Oxford's second bullet (contradicting the historic record that no bullets were found). A scene in which the police search his lodgings and find newspaper illustrations of the royal pair papering the glass skylight was not included in the theatrical release.

Oxford's assassination attempt is also depicted in the first series finale of the 2016 TV series ''[[Victoria (UK TV series)|Victoria]]'', in which Oxford is played by [[Harry McEntire]]. Within the show, suggestions are raised that Oxford was acting under the orders of [[Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover]], who would have acceded to the throne if both Victoria and her unborn child were to die; however, it is ultimately concluded that Oxford is delusional and has been writing letters from Hanover to himself.

'''Eugene William Pallette''' (July 8, 1889 – September 3, 1954) was an American actor. He appeared in over 240 [[silent film|silent era]] and [[sound film|sound era]] [[film|motion pictures]] between 1913 and 1946.

After an early career as a slender [[leading man]], Pallette became a stout character actor. He had a deep voice, which some critics have likened to the sound of a croaking frog,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Terry|last=Rowan|title=Character-Based Film Series Part 1|publisher=lulu.com|date=2016|ISBN=9781365021282|page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Ed|last=Sikov|title=Screwball: Hollywood's Madcap Romantic Comedies|publisher=[[Crown Publishing Group|Crown Publishers]]|location=New York City|date=1989|ISBN=0517573024| page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is probably best-remembered for comic [[character actor|character roles]] such as Alexander Bullock, [[Carole Lombard]]'s character's father, in ''[[My Man Godfrey]]'' (1936), as [[Friar Tuck]] in ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood]]'' (1938) starring [[Errol Flynn]], and his similar role as Fray Felipe in ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1940 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' (1940) starring [[Tyrone Power]].

==Early life and career==
He was born in [[Winfield, Kansas]], the son of William Baird Pallette (1858–?) and Elnora "Ella" Jackson (1860–1906). His sister was Beulah L. Pallette (1880–1968).

Pallette attended [[Culver Academies|Culver Military Academy]] in [[Culver, Indiana]]. He then began his [[acting]] career on the [[theatre|stage]] in [[repertory|stock company]] roles, appearing for a period of six years.

==Silent pictures==
[[File:The Three Musketeers (1921) 2.jpg|thumb|right|260px|[[Léon Bary]], Eugene Pallette, [[Douglas Fairbanks]] and [[George Siegmann]] in ''[[The Three Musketeers (1921 film)|The Three Musketeers]]'' (1921)]] 
Pallette began his [[silent film]] career as an [[extra (actor)|extra]] in about 1911. His first [[credit (creative arts)|credited]] appearance was in the one-[[reel#Motion picture terminology|reel]] [[short film|short]] [[western (genre)|western]]/[[drama film|drama]] ''The Fugitive'' (1913) which was directed by [[Wallace Reid]] for [[American Film Manufacturing Company|Flying "A" Studios]] at [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]].

Quickly advancing to featured status, Pallette appeared in many westerns.  He worked with [[D. W. Griffith]] on such films as ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' (1915) and ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]'' (1916).  At this time, he had a slim, athletic figure, a far cry from his portly build later in his career.  He starred as the slender sword-fighting swashbuckler [[Aramis]] in [[Douglas Fairbanks]]' 1921 version of ''[[The Three Musketeers (1921 film)|The Three Musketeers]]'', one of the great smash hits of the silent era.

After gaining a great deal of weight, he became one of the screen's most recognizable [[character actor]]s. In 1927, he signed as a regular for [[Hal Roach#Hal Roach Studios|Hal Roach Studios]] and was a reliable comic foil in several early [[Laurel and Hardy]] movies. In later years, Pallette's weight may have topped out at more than 300 pounds (136&amp;nbsp;kg).

==Sound pictures==
The advent of the [[sound film|talkies]] proved to be the second major career boost for Pallette. His inimitable rasping gravel voice (described as "half an octave below anyone else in the cast") made him one of [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]]'s most sought-after character actors in the 1930s and 1940s.

The typical Pallette role was the comically exasperated head of the family (''[[My Man Godfrey]]'', ''[[The Lady Eve]]''), the cynical backroom sharpy (''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]''), or the gruff detective (''[[The Kennel Murder Case (film)|The Kennel Murder Case]]''). Pallette's best-known role may be as [[Friar Tuck]] in ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood (film)|The Adventures of Robin Hood]]'', and his similar appearance in ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1940 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]''.

[[BBC]] commentator [[Dana Gioia]] described Pallette's onscreen appeal:

[[File:Clip from My Man Godfrey.ogg|thumb|left|thumbtime=3:49|upright=1.2|[[:File:Clip from My Man Godfrey.ogg|Clip]] from ''[[My Man Godfrey]]'' (1936), with Eugene Pallette (left) and [[William Powell]]]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;The mature Pallette character is a creature of provocative contradictions—tough-minded but indulgent, earthy but epicurean, relaxed but excitable. His grit and gravel voice sounds simultaneously tough and comic. ... Pallette uses his girth to create a common touch. Stuffed into a tuxedo that seems perpetually near bursting, he seems more down-to-earth than the stylish high society types who surround him.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Pallette was cast as the father of lead actress [[Jeanne Crain]] for the film ''[[In the Meantime, Darling]]'' (1944). Director [[Otto Preminger]] clashed with Pallette and claimed he was "an admirer of [[Hitler]] and convinced that Germany would win [[World War II|the war]]". Pallette refused to sit at the same table with black actor [[Clarence Muse]] in a scene set in a kitchen. "You're out of your mind, I won't sit next to a nigger", Pallette hissed at Preminger. Preminger furiously informed Fox studio head [[Darryl F. Zanuck]], who fired Pallette. Although Pallette remains in scenes he already had filmed, the remainder of his role not yet shot was eliminated from the script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Chris|last=Fujiwara|title=The World and Its Double: The Life and Work of Otto Preminger|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]]|location=New York City|date=2009|ISBN=0-86547-995-X|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In increasingly ill health by his late 50s, Pallette made fewer and fewer movies, and for lesser studios. His final movie, ''[[Suspense (1946 film)|Suspense]]'', was released in 1946.

==Later life==
In 1946, convinced that there was going to be a "world blow-up" by [[atomic bomb]]s, the hawkish Pallette received considerable publicity when he set up a "mountain fortress" on a {{convert|3500|acre|km2|adj=on}} ranch near [[Imnaha, Oregon]], as a hideaway from universal catastrophe. The "fortress" reportedly was stocked with a sizable herd of prize cattle, enormous supplies of food, and had its own canning plant and lumber mill.

When the "blow-up" he anticipated failed to materialize after two years, he began disposing of the Oregon ranch and returned to [[Los Angeles]] and his movie colony friends. He never appeared in another movie, however. 

Eugene Pallette died at age 65 in 1954 from [[throat cancer]] at his apartment, 10835 Wilshire Boulevard, in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;California Death Index, Name: Eugene William Pallette, Birth Date: 07-08-1889, Mother's Maiden Name: Jackson, Father's Last: Pallette, Sex: Male, Birth Place: Kansas, Death Place: Los Angeles (19), Death Date: 09-03-1954, Age: 65 yrs.&lt;/ref&gt; His wife, Marjorie, and his sister, Beulah Phelps, were at his side. Private funeral services were conducted on Saturday, September 4, 1954, at the Armstrong Family Mortuary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pioneer Film Actor Eugene Pallette Dies|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tronc]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=September 4, 1954|page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; His cremated remains are interred in an [[unmarked grave]] behind the monument of his parents at Green Lawn Cemetery in [[Grenola, Kansas]]. 

He has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6702 [[Hollywood Boulevard]] for his contribution to motion pictures.

==Resignation of Information Minister Mohammed al-Sanoussi==
On December 17, 2006, Information Minister Mohammed al-Sanoussi resigned, a day before he was scheduled to be questioned in parliament over allegations that he tried to restrict satellite TV stations during this year's legislative elections.

Al-Sanoussi denied he curbed the private TV channels, saying that he only asked them to apply for licenses. In Kuwait, all publications and broadcasting media have to be licensed. Several privately owned satellite stations, operated from abroad, appeared in Kuwait before the June elections, broadcasting interviews with opposition figures and covering the campaign. Most subsequently went off the air.

Al-Muslim led the campaign against Al-Sanoussi, claiming that al-Sanoussi wrote to the Interior Ministry, asking it to find out who owned the new TV stations so that this "sensitive and dangerous" situation could be dealt with.  In the written request to question Al-Sanoussi, Al-Muslim said, "What the information minister did was against the principles of freedom, and against the constitution that guarantees freedom of speech, expression and publication."  Al-Muslim also accused the minister of failing to suppress publications that were anti-Islamic and promoting vice.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/17/AR2006121701279_pf.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grilling of Health Minister Ahmed Abdullah Al Ahmed Al Sabah==
On February 19, 2007, [[Waleed Al-Tabtabaie]] submitted a motion to [[Kuwait National Assembly No-Confidence Votes|formally question]] Health Minister Sheik Ahmed Abdullah Al Ahmed Al Sabah about allegations of favoritism, deteriorating health services offered by state hospitals, and wasting public money by sending people for treatment abroad at the country's expense when they could be treated at home.  The motion was signed and supported by Al-Otaibi, [[Ali Al-Omair]], [[Duaij Al-Shimmari]], [[Hussein Muzyed]], [[Abdullah Okash]], [[Abdullah Al-Azemi]], [[Saad Al-Azemi]], [[Dhaifallah Buramia]], [[Marzouq Al-Hubaini]] and [[Mohammad Al-Mutair]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kuwaittimes.net/read_news.php?newsid=MjI0NjM=]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resignation of Health Minister Maasouma Al-Mubarak==
On August 25, 2007, Al-Otaibi and Islamist MP [[Waleed AlـTabtabaie]] submitted to Speaker [[Jassem Al-Kharafi]] a [[Kuwait National Assembly No-Confidence Votes|motion to grill]] Health Minister Maasouma Al-Mubarak following the August 23rd Jahra Hospital fire which led to the death of two elderly patients. The first angle of the grilling accused Dr Maasouma of committing violations in the Foreign Medical Treatment Department and toying with ministerial law 2007/25 issued by the minister after assuming office.  Indicating according to the law only those patients suffering from diseases for which treatment is not available in Kuwait can be sent for treatment abroad according to the recommendation of a specialized panel of doctors and the physicians in charge of the patient, the MPs said in their grilling motion "as per the law the Health Minister and undersecretaries of health cannot interfere in the decision. However, this law was never implemented and was repeatedly violated under the minister's supervision."&lt;ref&gt;[http://cm3.zawya.com/story.cfm?id=ZAWYA20070826063651&amp;page=emailstory&amp;section=main]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L25686840.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Against Cross-Dressing==
On December 10, 2007, the parliament passed a bill, supported by Al-Otaib and [[Ali Al-Omair]], which amended the penal code so that anyone "imitating the appearance of a member of the opposite sex" could be jailed for up to a year or fined up to 1,000 dinars.  Al-Otaib, who heads a parliamentary committee monitoring "practices alien to Kuwaiti society", said: "The law criminalising people who imitate the appearance of the opposite sex must be implemented and respected ... Kuwait should ignore any international criticism." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jan/23/boysmustbeboys]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George Coe''' (1856–1941&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=43604695]", George Washington Coe at Findagrave&lt;/ref&gt;) was an [[Old West]] [[cowboy]] and for a time [[gunfighter|gunman]] alongside [[Billy the Kid]] during the [[Lincoln County War]].

==Early years==

George Washington Coe was born in Brighton, [[Iowa]], and ventured to [[New Mexico Territory]] in his youth, around 1871, alongside his cousin, [[Frank Coe (Lincoln County War)|Frank Coe]], to work on a ranch near [[Fort Stanton]] belonging to a cousin, and for a time during this period they lived near [[Raton, New Mexico]]. The two often rode in pursuit of [[cattle rustling|cattle rustlers]] and horse thieves, dealing with them harshly. On July 18, 1876, he and Frank Coe, accompanied by [[Doc Scurlock]], [[Charlie Bowdre]] and [[Ab Saunders]] forced their way into the weak Lincoln jail and freed horse thief Jesus Largo from [[Sheriff]] Saturnino Baca. After leaving Lincoln with Largo, they [[Lynching|lynch]]ed him. By 1878 he had leased his own land to begin a ranch, during which time he and his cousin continued to find themselves battling rustlers, but now in defense of their own land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coe|first1=George|title=Frontier Fighter|date=1934|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company|edition=Hardcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lincoln County War==

George Coe was dragged into the Lincoln County War by way of his own unjust arrest by county [[Sheriff]] [[William J. Brady]]. Coe and his cousin joined the [[Lincoln County Regulators]], riding with [[Billy the Kid]], and facing off against the "[[Lawrence Murphy|Murphy-Dolan]] Faction" and their supporters, to include members of the [[Jesse Evans Gang]] and the [[John Kinney Gang]]. Coe figured prominently into the events of the final [[Battle of Lincoln, New Mexico|Battle of Lincoln]] between the two factions, and was eventually arrested for the [[murder]] of [[Buckshot Roberts]], a shootout known as the [[Gunfight of Blazer's Mills]], and in which he lost a finger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bell|first1=Bob Boze|title=Shootout at Blazer's Mill|url=https://truewestmagazine.com/shootout-at-blazers-mill/|website=True West Magazine|publisher=True West Magazine|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coe shot and wounded [[Seven Rivers Warriors]] gang member "Dutch Charlie" Kruling in Lincoln on the morning of April 30, 1878, a day after Seven Rivers members had shot and killed the new Regulator leader [[Frank McNab]], along with wounding Regulator [[Ab Saunders]] and capturing Coe's cousin Frank Coe. Frank escaped shortly thereafter. Coe eventually obtained [[amnesty]] from [[Governor]] [[Lew Wallace]], and moved to both [[Nebraska]] and [[Colorado]] before returning to Lincoln County in 1884, where he started the "Golden Glow Ranch", and became a prosperous and respected member of the community. He later wrote his [[autobiography]], titled ''Frontier Fighter'', detailing his association with the Regulators and giving details of certain members' traits and personalities.&lt;ref name="CoeHarrison1934"&gt;{{cite book|author1=George Washington Coe|author2=Nannie Hillary Harrison|title=Frontier fighter: the autobiography of George W.

The '''Golden Hill Paugussett''' is a [[State recognized tribes|state-recognized]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribe in [[Connecticut]]. Granted reservations in a number of towns in the 17th century, their land base was whittled away until they were forced to reacquire a small amount of territory in the 19th century. Today they retain a state-recognized reservation in the town of [[Trumbull, Connecticut|Trumbull]], and have an additional reservation acquired in 1978 and 1980 in [[Colchester, Connecticut]].

They descend from the historic [[Paugussett]], an Algonguian-speaking nation who historically occupied much of western [[Connecticut]] prior to the arrival of European colonists.&lt;ref name=staterec&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cga.ct.gov/2002/olrdata/jud/rpt/2002-R-0118.htm |title=Effect of State Recognition of an Indian Tribe |author=Christopher Reinhart |pages= |date=2002-02-07 |accessdate=2010-08-06 |quote=Connecticut statutes recognize five tribes: (1) Golden Hill Paugussett, (2) [[Mashantucket Pequot]], (3) [[Mohegan]], (4) Eastern Pequot, and (5) [[Schaghticoke tribe]]. |publisher=State of Connecticut }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Brilvitch|2007|pp=11--12}} They are among the five tribes recognized by the state.&lt;ref name=staterec/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cga.ct.gov/current/pub/chap_824.htm#sec_47-59a |title=CGS § 47-59a Connecticut Indians; citizenship, civil rights, land rights. |author= |accessdate=2015-07-02 |quote= |publisher=State of Connecticut}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were denied [[Native American recognition in the United States|federal recognition]] in 2004.&lt;ref name=fedreg/&gt;

==Present day==
The 100-member tribe lives primarily in urban areas of Southwestern Connecticut due to the miniscule size of its {{convert|1/4|acre|km2|sing=on}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eisner|first=Will|authorlink=Will Eisner|title=Odd Facts|publisher=Tempo Star|year=1975|page=94|chapter=Politics|isbn=978-0-448-13506-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; reserve in the [[Nichols, Connecticut|Nichols]] section of [[Trumbull, Connecticut]].

==History==
[[Image:Falls Mountain on the Housatonic River 1886.jpg|right|thumb|Falls Mountain gorge on the Housatonic River, site of a seventeenth-century Paugussett fishing village/site.{{Sfn|Orcutt, v1|1886|pp=26--27}}]]
While the history of the Paugusset people began long before the European encounter, the early written records are European accounts. They are one of the numerous [[Eastern Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]-speaking nations who emerged in the coastal areas of the Atlantic. Historically, they occupied a region from present-day [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] to [[West Haven, Connecticut|West Haven]], and from Long Island Sound inland for as far as they could navigate by canoe on the [[Housatonic River|Housatonic]] and [[Naugatuck River|Naugatuck]] rivers.

The tribe was made up of four primary sub-groups, the Paugussett Proper in what is present-day [[Milford, Connecticut|Milford]], [[Derby, Connecticut|Derby]] and [[Shelton, Connecticut|Shelton]]; the Pequonnock, along the coast; the [[Pootatuck]] in [[Newtown, Connecticut|Newtown]], [[Woodbury, Connecticut|Woodbury]] and [[Southbury, Connecticut|Southbury]]; and the [[Weantinock]] in [[New Milford, Connecticut|New Milford]]. They had a [[farming]] and [[fishing]] culture. The women cultivated varieties of staple crops: [[corn]], [[beans]], and [[Squash (plant)|squash]], and [[tobacco]], which was used for ritual purposes. The men fished in both fresh and salt water. The size of midden [[shell heaps]] along the coast and the amount of cleared land attested to both a long period of occupation and a high degree of social organization among the people.{{Sfn|Brilvitch|2007|pp=13--14}}

===Encroachment by settlers===
While the Paugusset did not have early direct contact with Europeans, they came in contact with other Native Americans who did, and were exposed to the [[smallpox]] [[epidemic]] in 1633—35, which caused many deaths. They learned of the English and allies' [[Pequot War|war against the Pequot]] in 1637, with the defeat of that nation. English settlers first arrived in Paugussett lands in 1638—39, establishing settlements in New Haven, Guilford, Milford, Stratford and Fairfield.{{Sfn|Brilvitch|2007|pp=16--17}}

===Golden Hill and Turkey Hill===
Within a few years, the Paugussett had been divested by the colonists of the vast majority of their lands. A reservation was set aside in 1639 at Golden Hill, site of a spring sacred to the tribe, in present-day [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]].  Another reservation was established at Turkey Hill in present-day [[Derby, Connecticut|Derby]]. In 1802, the state-appointed tribal overseer sold Golden Hill. A replacement reservation was created at Turkey Meadows in Trumbull in 1841, but it was sold off in 1854. The last of Turkey Hill was also sold by the state in 1826 for the people's "own benefit".{{Sfn|Brilvitch|2007|pp=19--22}}

===Ethiope or Liberia===
According to Bridgeport City Historian [[Charles Brilvitch]]'s history of the Golden Hill tribe, beginning in the 1820s a number of Paugussett, under the leadership of Joel Freeman, a Turkey Hill Indian from Derby, relocated to Bridgeport.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Brilvitch, ''A History of the Golden Hill Paugussett Tribe'', The History Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; They settled in the city's South End. The area became known as [[Liberia|Ethiope]] or Liberia. While this community consisted substantially of residents who identified as Paugussett, it included Natives from the Mahican, Shinnecock, Nehantic, and Munsee-Delaware nations as well.  Freeman was followed by two of his sisters, Mary and Eliza, who built houses in 1848 that are still standing. They have been listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Brilvitch, ''A History of the Golden Hill Paugussett Tribe'', The History Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the antebellum period, the Paugussett and other Native Americans achieved a substantial degree of economic success. Many of the men worked on whaling ships and West Indies trading vessels, while many women residents worked as cooks and waitstaff on the steamboats plying Long Island Sound and the Hudson River. Two churches, a Masonic lodge, resort hotel, school and other community institutions were built in the village. 

Only one individual named "Joel Freeman" was recorded in Census and vital records of the state of Connecticut during this period.  Nevertheless, the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] disputed whether the man who led the Ethiope-Liberia community was the same individual listed as a signatory on Turkey Hill Indian deeds. Because the National Register of Historic Places nomination for the [[Mary and Eliza Freeman Houses]] identified the builders as African Americans, the BIA disputed whether the sisters and Joel Freeman could be considered members of the Paugusset community.{{Sfn|Brilvitch|2007|pp=11--12, 27--36}}&lt;ref name=fedreg/&gt; However, Charles Brilvitch, who ironically had authored the 1998 nomination, maintains that his African American identification was merely a mistaken attempt to interpret the term "colored" used in documents of the period&lt;ref&gt;Charles W. Brilvitch (2007). A History of Connecticut's Golden Hill Paugussett Tribe. The History Press. {{ISBN|978-1-59629-296-3}}. page 12&lt;/ref&gt; 

The confusion about cultural identification as Native Americans has affected other communities that have worked to demonstrate cultural continuity. Native American nations were used to absorbing people of other ethnicities and intermarried with neighbors. There has been disagreement among groups over an interpretation of the term "mulatto," which has a primary association of African-European mixed race but has frequently been applied to other people of color. {{Sfn|Brilvitch|2007|pp=11--12, 27--36}}&lt;ref name=fedreg/&gt;

===Restoration of the land base===
Around 1857 William Sherman (1825-1886), a whaler by trade withdrew from the Liberia community and settled in the village of Nichols Farms in the Town of [[Trumbull, Connecticut]], the site of the 1841-54 Turkey Meadows reservation.  In 1875, he purchased a quarter-acre plot of land that contained a Paugussett burial ground; he used funds from the Golden Hill Tribal Fund to construct a house on it. He is referred to in local histories of the 1880s as the chief of the tribe. Prior to his death in 1886, Sherman turned the property over to the state overseer in trust for the Golden Hill tribe. The land was accepted by the State of Connecticut in that year as an official reservation.

Subsequently, his son George Sherman (b. 1871) took over the leadership of the Golden Hill people; he lived on the reservation and led the people until his death in 1938.  He was succeeded by his son Edward (1896-1974), who was known as "Chief Black Hawk."  Meanwhile, Edward's sister, Ethel (1893-1993), was installed in 1933 as "Chieftess Rising Star".  Ethel was active in the Pan-Indian movement and was a staunch advocate of Indian rights, fighting many battles in the courts of law and public opinion. She named her son Aurelius H. Piper (1916-2008) as "Chief Big Eagle" in 1959. Following the death of Chief Black Hawk in 1974, Piper (Chief Big Eagle) assumed full leadership of the tribe and took up residency on the Trumbull reservation.  He obtained grants to purchase land in [[Colchester, Connecticut]] for the community in 1978 and 1980. This land was granted formal reservation status by the state legislature in 1981.

===Present Leadership===

On May 1, 1991, due to advancing age, Chief Big Eagle named his son, Aurelius H. Piper, Jr. (b. 1945), as Chief of Chiefs and Hereditary Chief of the Golden Hill Tribe.  Known as Chief Quiet Hawk, Piper is an ex-Marine and former social worker who was then serving as executive director of American Indians for Development, Inc.  Immediately upon assuming leadership he launched the Golden Hill Indian Development Corporation, with the purpose of economic development of the reservation properties for the benefit of the tribal membership.

In September, 1992, Quiet Hawk filed a lawsuit to reclaim lands taken from the tribe in violation of the federal [[Nonintercourse Act]].  The tribe at first sought to reclaim the 12-acre Nimrod Lot and the 8-acre Rocky Hill Lot in the city of Bridgeport, both sold off by the State of Connecticut in 1802 without the stipulated approval of both houses of Congress.  In November, 1992, he advanced the claim to include the 19 3/4-acre Turkey Meadows Reservation in Trumbull.  Concurrently, the tribe sued for the remainder of the 80-acre Golden Hill Reservation in Bridgeport. Within a few short weeks historic reservation lands in the towns of Milford, Orange, Woodbridge, Stratford, and Shelton were added; intent was made known to press claims in 24 state municipalities, comprising $44 billion worth of property and 640,000 defendants.

An overriding priority of Chief Quiet Hawk's administration has been the quest for federal recognition.  A grant for this purpose was obtained from the Department of Housing and Urban Development in 1992.  Another priority has been to utilize modern technology to facilitate interaction among tribal members and to strengthen community bonds and spiritual focus.

===Challenge over cigarette sales===
In 1993 the tribe made national headlines when it opened a tax-free cigarette shop on the Colchester reservation, asserting its sovereignty in selling the product without taking taxes. An armed standoff with state police ensued that ended without violence when Chief Moon Face Bear (Kenneth Piper) agreed to close the shop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nativenet.uthscsa.edu/archive/nl/9308/0108.html|title=Stand-off at Golden Hill Paugussett smoke shop|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060919210606/http://nativenet.uthscsa.edu/archive/nl/9308/0108.html|archivedate=September 19, 2006|date=12 Aug 1993|author=Margaret Pearce|work=Native-L}} in {{cite news|last=Hayden|first=Lisa|title=PAUGUSSETTS CLOSE SMOKE SHOP|newspaper=Norwich Bulletin|date=August 12, 1993|location=Colchester}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the resulting state court case, the court ruled in ''State v. Piper,'' No. CR21-57349 (May 3, 1996), that the tribe did not have exemption from the state requirement to collect taxes on sales of cigarettes as it was not federally recognized.&lt;ref name="staterec"/&gt;

==Quest for federal recognition==
Chief Big Eagle first submitted a request to the BIA in 1982 seeking federal recognition of the Golden Hill Paugussett tribe. That request was not acted on or further pursued by the BIA. Early in 1990 Chief Big Eagle appointed Chief Quiet Hawk to pursue the quest for federal recognition and also to pursue the land claims in the state of Connecticut.

In a final determination in 1996, the Bureau of Indian Affairs denied recognition to the Golden Hill Paugussett. The tribe appealed under BIA provisions and submitted additional historic and genealogical documentation.&lt;ref name=fedreg/&gt;&lt;ref name="libby1999"&gt;{{cite news |author=Sam Libby |coauthors= |title=Another Chance for Golden Hill Paugussett |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/12/nyregion/another-chance-for-golden-hill-paugussett.html |quote= |pages= |work=New York Times |location= |date=1999-12-12 |accessdate=2010-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were denied [[Native American recognition in the United States|federal recognition]] in 2004.&lt;ref name=fedreg&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2004/04-13871.htm |title=Final Determination Against Federal Acknowledgement of the Golden Hill Paugussett Tribe |author=Bureau of Indian Affairs |pages=34388–34393 |date=2004-06-21 |accessdate=2010-08-06 |quote= |publisher=United States |work=Federal Register }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="denial2004"/&gt; Since the legislative changes that have enabled federally recognized tribes to establish gambling [[casino]]s on their lands, some tribes have gained significant revenue for welfare, education, and development from gambling revenues, including two in Connecticut.&lt;ref name="denial2004"&gt;{{cite news |author=Raymond Hernandez |coauthors= |title=Connecticut Indians Denied Tribal Status, Dimming 3rd Casino's Chances |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/15/nyregion/connecticut-indians-denied-tribal-status-dimming-3rd-casino-s-chances.html |quote= |pages= |work=New York Times |location= |date=2004-06-15 |accessdate=2010-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the Bureau of Indian Affairs revised the acknowledgment criteria, requiring petitioners to prove continuity only back to 1900 (rather than to the time of first contact) and accepting State recognition and the existence of tribal reservations as evidence of a continuing government-to-government relationship.  Seeing that this would virtually guarantee recognition of the Paugussett and other state tribes, the Connecticut congressional delegation insisted on the insertion of a clause stipulating that tribes which have previously been denied federal recognition could not re-petition.&lt;ref name="WNPR_2015"&gt;{{cite news |author=Harriet Jones |title=Federal Recognition Changes Leave Connecticut Tribes Out in the Cold  |url=http://wnpr.org/post/federal-recognition-changes-leave-connecticut-tribes-out-cold |quote= |pages= |work=WNPR |location= |date=June 29, 2015  |accessdate=2015-07-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BIA_2015"&gt;{{cite web |author= |title=Revisions to Regulations on Federal Acknowledgment of Indian Tribes (25 CFR 83 or "Part 83")|url=http://www.bia.gov/WhoWeAre/AS-IA/ORM/83revise/index.htm |publisher=US Department of Interior |date=June 29, 2015  |accessdate=2015-07-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==State opposition to federal recognition==
While the state has gained considerable revenues from its share of income generated by the two major established casino resorts, Connecticut officials have been opposed to recognition of additional tribes and addition of gambling sites in the state. State officials lobbied the BIA in opposition to recognition of the Golden Hill Paugussett.&lt;ref name="libby1999"/&gt;

The governor, Congressional delegation, and private property owners later mounted challenges and conducted lobbying to reverse the federal recognition granted to the [[Eastern Pequot Nation]] in 2002, and the [[Schaghticoke Tribal Nation]] in 2004. They succeeded in gaining a BIA review of both cases; after a change in political administrations, recognition of both tribes was revoked in 2005, actions without precedent.&lt;ref name="judgestatus"&gt;[http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/article/schaghticoke-tribal-nation-seeks-to-regain-rightful-status-35230 Gale Courey Toensing, "Schaghticoke Tribal Nation Seeks to Regain Rightful Status"], ''Indian Country'', 31 May 2011, accessed 17 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Land rights claims==
Together with providing documentation and working to regain tribal status, the Paugusset filed land rights claims against the state, saying the state did not have the authority to manage or sell land on their behalf and had cost them the loss of substantial lands since colonial times. Lack of federal recognition has deprived them of automatic standing in such suits.

Initiated by Chief Big Eagle, the Paugussett originally had claimed legal rights to {{convert|700000|acre|km2}} of land running from [[Orange, Connecticut|Orange/Woodbridge]] in [[New Haven County, Connecticut|New Haven County]] though [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]] to [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] and extending North into [[Litchfield County, Connecticut|Eastern Litchfield County]] up to the [[Massachusetts]] border. The Paugusset have since dropped these large claims.&lt;ref name=globe/&gt;&lt;ref name=landclaims&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.wtic.com/pages/2727647.php? |title=Chief Of Golden Hill Paugussett Tribe Dies |publisher=WTIC News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925202214/http://www.wtic.com/pages/2727647.php |archivedate=September 25, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Chief Quiet Hawk filed a lawsuit claiming 80 acres in Bridgeport, the site of Golden Hill, which the state had sold in 1802, as well as land in Trumbull and Orange. In 1993, the federal District Court judge Peter Dorsey concluded that Connecticut had violated the 1790 Non-Intercourse Act by selling Indian lands without the approval of the federal government. But he dismissed the case, pending resolution of the BIA's review of the Paugusset petition for federal recognition. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the dismissal. Citing other cases, it noted that criteria for an Indian group's pursuit of land claims were not necessarily the same as for federal recognition.&lt;ref name="libby1999"/&gt;

In 2006, a federal district court judge dismissed the Golden Hill Paugussett's 14-year-old lawsuit claiming lands in Orange, Trumbull and Bridgeport, based on the federal [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]]' rejection of the tribe's petition for federal recognition.&lt;ref name=orangebulletin&gt;{{cite news |author=Gregory B. Hladky |coauthors= |title=Federal judge tosses Paugussett land suit |url=http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?BRD=1661&amp;dept_id=9538&amp;newsid=17556107&amp;PAG=461&amp;rfi=9 |quote= |pages= |work=Orange Bulletin |location= |date=2006-12-06 |accessdate=2010-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091225102439/http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?brd=1661 |archivedate=2009-12-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Golden Hill Paugusset had contended that, since they were a Native American nation, the state did not have the authority to deal with them on land sales or dispose of their land. Since the United States was formed, the federal government had reserved to itself authority over dealings with Native American nations and required approval by the Senate of any sale of Indian lands.

==Notable Golden Hill Paugusett people==

Piper, Sr.]] (1916 - 2008), Chief Big Eagle - hereditary chief, died at age 92 in Trumbull.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|coauthors=|title=Paugussett tribal chief, 92, dies|url=http://www.norwichbulletin.com/news/x78526648/Paugussett-tribal-chief-92-dies|quote=|pages=|work=Norwich Bulletin|location=|date=2008-08-05|accessdate=2010-08-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120907085938/http://www.norwichbulletin.com/news/x78526648/Paugussett-tribal-chief-92-dies|archivedate=2012-09-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the late 20th century, he encouraged revival of the Paugusset language.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7771">'''Jayakatwang''' (died 1293) was the king of short lived second [[Kingdom of Kediri]] (also known as Gelang-gelang Kingdom) of [[Java]], after his overthrow of [[Kertanegara]], the last king of [[Singhasari]]. He was eventually defeated by [[Raden Wijaya]], Kertanegara's son-in-law using the troops of the Mongol [[Yuan dynasty]] that were [[Mongol invasion of Java|invading Java]]. Raden Wijaya would later turn against the [[Mongols]] and found [[Majapahit]], the greatest empire in Java.

His name is derived from [[Sanskrit]] ''[[wikt:jaya|Jaya]]'' (''victory'') and [[Javanese language|Javanese]] ''ketawang'', (''rising, or appearing'').

Kediri is located in fertile [[rice]]-producing area in [[Brantas River]] banks, approximately 80&amp;nbsp;km to the west of Singhasari, but separated from it by the [[Arjuno-Welirang]] volcanoes and [[Mount Kawi]].

== Rebellion against Singhasari ==
[[Kertanegara]], the fifth ruler of [[Singhasari]], was an ambitious man. In 1289, Mongol emissary came to Java to demand his submission to the [[Great Khan]] of the [[Yuan dynasty]]. Kertanegara rejected, cut their ears and sent them back to China. Anticipating Mongolian revenge, he prepared to thwart the forthcoming invasion by conquering important ports and kingdoms in [[Maritime Southeast Asia]]. His most important expedition was the [[Pamalayu expedition]] to [[Sumatra]] in 1292, where he sent the Javanese army to conquer Sumatra from various successor states of [[Srivijaya]].

With the bulk of the Javanese army overseas, Jayakatwang seized his chance and launched a coup against Singhasari.&lt;ref name=kublai /&gt;  He launched a diversionary attack to the northern Java, where his troops drew the remaining Singhasari troops left in the island. With Singhasari defenseless he attacked the capital city.&lt;ref name=Introduction&gt;{{Cite book

Kertanegara was killed in his palace. Jayakatwang then declared himself ruler of Java and king of the restored Kediri.&lt;ref name=Indianized /&gt;{{rp|199}}

Jayakatwang gave Wijaya land in the Tarik forest in Brantas delta, to build a village that was later called [[Majapahit]], named from the sour beal tree that grow in the area.

Raden Wijaya seeing this event as opportunity to revenge Kertanegara's death and claim the throne of Java. He soon offered submission and allied himself with the Mongol, who wasn't aware on the recent political change in Java.

The Mongolian expedition consisted of  20.000 army with 1.000 boats and a year of grain provision. The expedition consisted mostly of southern Chinese conscript.&lt;ref name=kublai&gt;{{Cite book

With Wijaya as guide, Mongol troop declared war against Jayakatwang. Wijaya's and his Mongol allies defeated captured Jayakatwang's navy in [[Surabaya]] at delta of Brantas river. Following the victory they easily  marched along Brantas to Kediri in Java's interior.&lt;ref name=Introduction /&gt; After heavy fight, they [[siege|besieged]] and conquered Kediri. Jayakatwang was captured and then executed, in March 1293.&lt;ref name=survey /&gt;&lt;ref name=Indianized /&gt;{{rp|201}}

Thus the troops sent to Java that with the intention to punish the king who insulted the Mongols (Kertanegara), ended up revenging his death and killing his usurper (Jayakatwang).

== Legacy ==
Jayakatwang's restoration of Kediri was short-lived, but the event that happened during his reign played important part in the history of Java and [[Indonesia]], especially in the rise of Majapahit under Raden Wijaya.

In disguise of returning to his domain in Majapahit to prepare tribute for the Mongol, Raden Wijaya would go on to betray his Mongol allies, who were exhausted after the war with Jayakatwang.&lt;ref name=kublai /&gt;&lt;ref name=chengho /&gt;  He would drive them from Java and establishing [[Majapahit]] as the one of the greatest empire that rise from modern territory of Indonesia.

'''Joachim Ernst Adolphe Felix Wach''' ({{IPA-de|vaχ|lang}}; January 25, 1898&amp;nbsp;– August 27, 1955) was a [[Germany|German]] religious scholar from [[Chemnitz]], who emphasised a distinction between the history of [[religion]] (Religionswissenschaft) and the philosophy of religion.

Wach was descended on both sides from the famous [[Mendelssohn family]], both the philosopher [[Moses Mendelssohn]] and the composer [[Felix Mendelssohn|Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy]]. He shared the latter's love of music and was said to have inherited some important papers and relics of his ancestor. After schooling in Dresden, he enlisted in the German army in 1916, where he served as a cavalry officer. After World War I, he studied at the Universities of Munich, Berlin, Freiburg, and Leipzig, where he received his Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1922. He taught at Leipzig University. His ''Habilitationsschrift'', entitled ''Religionswissenschaft'', is widely considered a landmark document in the field of the History of Religions.

Though Wach's family had long since converted from Judaism to Christianity, he was nonetheless driven out of his teaching post by the Nazis in the early 1930s. He was able to emigrate to the United States, where he took up a post at Brown University, first as Visiting Professor of Biblical Literature (1935–1939) and then as Associate Professor (1939–1946). Raised as a Lutheran, he became an Episcopalian shortly after coming to the United States. He was granted United States citizenship in 1946.

Wach taught at the [[University of Chicago Divinity School]] from 1945 to 1955, becoming the chair of the History of Religions area, which had just been moved to the Divinity School from its earlier home in the Division of the Humanities. In his lectures and his writings, he emphasized a comprehensive study of religion, focusing on a) religious experience, b) religious praxis, and c) religious communities.

According to the University of Chicago Archives, Wach used the methods of the social sciences to better understand religious thought. Developing the field known as the Sociology of Religion, he maintained that the founder of a new religion experienced a revelation illuminating the way the world worked. He then began to acquire disciples who became a closely knit circle directed towards the founder with whom they each had intimate contact. The solidarity of this relationship bound the disciples together and differentiated them from other forms of social organization. Membership in the group required a break with past life and its everyday pursuits in order to focus on the new knowledge to the extent that ties of family and kinship would be relaxed or severed.

Wach died unexpectedly of a heart attack (though he had had a history of heart trouble) on August 27, 1955, in Locarno, Switzerland.

Soon after their introduction in 1840 [[postage stamp]]s started to be forged.

The first book about the topic was written in 1862 by [[Jean-Baptiste Moens]] from Belgium ''De la falsifications des timbres-poste''. Shortly afterwards [[Edward Loines Pemberton]] published ''Forged Stamps: How to detect them'' and subsequently [[Robert Brisco Earée]] produced his legendary ''Album Weeds''. Today there is an extensive literature on the forgers and their work, and examples from the most accomplished forgers sometimes sell for more than the original stamp.

Notorious and famous stamp forgers include:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6083">'''Nevil Martin Schoenmakers''' is an [[Australia]]n-born [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] breeder known for founding the first [[cannabis]] [[seedbank]], which was called "The Seed Bank of Holland", in the early 1980s in the [[Netherlands]]. This was also the first seed company to advertise directly to the public in ''[[High Times]]'' magazine.

==Biography==
Born in 1957 in Perth, Western Australia to Dutch parents, Schoenmakers moved to the Netherlands in 1976. There he started growing cannabis for personal use. He soon discovered that the commercially available Thai, Colombian and African strains did not perform well in the Netherlands's northern European climate, nor indoors under artificial lighting. Realizing that the solution to the problem was better genetics, he decided that the best way to obtain good genetics was to start a seed bank, and in 1984 Schoenmakers established "The Seedbank." From then on, Schoenmakers collected many potent cannabis strains and crossed them to create his own strains. In the process he was able to cross equatorial sativas with Afghani indicas to create strains that were more suited to the temperate climates and indoor growing mediums of his European and U.S. customers. By 1986, Schoenmakers's cannabis seed company had become a runaway success with sales to more than 15,000 different growers in the United States alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.strainhunters.com/topic/3067-inside-cannabis-castle-the-incredible-story-of-the-man-who-would-be-king-of-cannabis/.html|title=Inside Cannabis Castle!!! The incredible story of the man who would be King of Cannabis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990 Schoenmakers became a target of the [[DEA]] [[Operation Green Merchant]] and an indictment had been lodged in [[New Orleans]], charging him with the sale of marijuana seeds to undercover agents and indoor growers in the New Orleans area. On July 24, 1990, he was arrested by the Australian authorities at the request of the U.S. government while visiting family in [[Perth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cannabiscupwinners.com/extras/kings-and-queens.html|title=The story of the man who would be King of Cannabis'}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schoenmakers was incarcerated in Fremantle jail for almost a year without bail while awaiting his extradition hearing. On June 21, 1991, just weeks before the date of his Federal Court hearing, he was finally granted bail {{why?|date=December 2017}} and subsequently disappeared from Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zoominfo.com/p/Nevil-Schoenmakers/595237808|title=Nevil Schoenmakers}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some time after Schoenmakers's return to the Netherlands, he was on the FBI's most wanted list, but because his activities were legal under Dutch law his extradition was refused and the charges were ultimately dropped. In 1991 Schoenmakers sold The Seed Bank to Sensi Seeds where he worked for a short time as their head breeder, before founding the Greenhouse Seed company with [[Arjan Roskam]]. By 1998, and widely regarded as the most successful modern cannabis breeder with multiple High Times Cannabis Cup wins, Schoenmakers sold his share of Greenhouse Seeds and left the limelight to focus on other interests.

In recent years, Schoenmakers has become involved in the movement to legalise medicinal cannabis in Australia. He recently coauthored a submission to a [[NSW]] government inquiry into the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/committee.nsf/0/435f253125d4849aca257b27000cda8a/$FILE/0064_Mr_Mark_Heinrich_&amp;_Mr_Nevil_Schoenmakers%5B1%5D.pdf|title=Inquiry into the use of cannabis for medical purposes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Schoenmakers was described by ''[[High Times]]'' magazine in 1985 as the "King of Cannabis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cannabiscupwinners.com/extras/kings-and-queens.html|title=The Man who would be King of Cannabis}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was the first cannabis breeder to export cannabis seeds from the Netherlands to the rest of the world, and is credited with creating many of the most popular award winning strains, such as Nevil's Haze,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nevilleshaze.com|title=The Cannabis strain 'Nevil's Haze'}}&lt;/ref&gt; Northern Lights Haze, Super Silver Haze, Nevil's Skunk, Super Skunk, Silver Pearl, Silver Haze and many others. His breeding with Northern Lights, a mostly [[Cannabis Indica|Indica]] strain originally developed in the [[Pacific Northwest]] of the [[United States]], became an inspiration for indoor Indicas, and the Northern Lights genetics are found in the pedigrees of nearly all of the best modern Indica lines. He is best remembered for the [[F1 hybrid]] Northern Lights 5 X Haze. This hybrid and its daughters have dominated the [[Cannabis Cup]] from the 1980s to the present day. The original Northern Lights 5 X Haze plant of Nevil's has been living on through clones {{source needed|date=December 2017}} and still wins championship awards. It is this cross that led to many of the modern medicinal strains that are popular today.

'''Rachel Tzvia Back''' is an English-language Israeli poet, translator and literary researcher.

==Biography==

Born in 1960, in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[New York (state)|New York]], Back was raised in the US and Israel. The seventh generation of her family in Israel, Back returned there for good in 1980.&lt;ref name="thedrunkenboat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedrunkenboat.com/back.html |title=The Drunken Boat |work=The Drunken Boat |date= |accessdate=2012-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; She currently resides in the [[Galilee]], in the north of the country. Back studied at [[Yale University]], [[Temple University]], and received her PhD from the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]].

Currently a senior lecturer of English literature at [[Oranim Academic College]], Israel, Back was appointed Brownstone Visiting Associate Professor at [[Dartmouth College]] in the US in 2009. Back has taught also at the Hebrew University, [[Bar-Ilan University]] and [[Tel-Aviv University]], and has been guest writer at numerous US universities, including [[Columbia University|Columbia]], [[Barnard College|Barnard]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Rutgers University|Rutgers]], [[NYU]], [[Wesleyan University|Wesleyan]], Williams and others. From 1995-2000, Back was the Israeli Academic and Administrative Director of the Wesleyan and Brown Universities Overseas Program in Israeli and Palestinian Studies, based in Jerusalem.

==Literary career==

Back's most recent poetry collection, ''A Messenger Comes'' (2012), is described by the poet [[Irena Klepfisz]] as "poetry that, without apology, centers on grief and its faithful companion, memory"; according to poet [[Hank Lazer]], this collection is "a harrowing &amp; inspiring book of poems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://singinghorsepress.com/titles/a-messenger-comes/ |title=A Messenger Comes |publisher=Singing Horse Press |date=2012-06-22 |accessdate=2012-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among her previous poetry collections is ''Litany'' (1995), ''Azimuth'' (2001), ''The Buffalo Poems'' (2003), and ''On Ruins &amp; Return: Poems 1999-2005'' (2005).

In 1996, Back was awarded the Israeli Absorption Minister's Prize for Immigrant Writers for her poetry collection ''Azimuth'', which was then translated into Hebrew by Israeli poet [[Aharon Shabtai]] (published by Kibbutz HaMeuchad, 2000). Poet [[Peter Cole]] noted of ''Azimuth'' that "with grace and gravity, with a gentle, quiet tenacity, Rachel Tzvia Back brings the poetics of indeterminacy to bear on Israel's over-determined landscape. Her verse hurts as the land itself has been hurt: its rippling music is delicate and achieved, its evocation of intimacy stunning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upne.com/1878818953.html |title=Azimuth: Rachel Tzvia Back |publisher=UPNE |date=2012-06-20 |accessdate=2012-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Back's subsequent poetry collections ''The Buffalo Poems'' and ''On Ruins &amp; Return'' track the cycle of violence marking the lives of Palestinians and Israelis. Poet Andrew Mossin noted that "with its passionate interrogation and representation of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, [Back's] work has its basis in personal, observed experience of a conflict that appears to be without end." Mossin also observed that Back's ''On Ruins &amp; Return'' "continues the journey of her earlier volume, ''Azimuth'', to inscribe in a poetry of psalmic intensity and astringent care the geographic, political and po-ethical realities of present-day Israel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jacketmagazine.com/35/r-back-rb-mossin.shtml |title=Jacket 35 - Early 2008 - Rachel Tzvia Back: ''On Ruins and Return'' reviewed by Andrew Mossin |work =Jacket Magazine |date= |accessdate=2012-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Back's poetry has appeared in numerous literary journals including ''[[The American Poetry Review]]'', [[Sulfur (magazine)|''Sulfur'']], ''Bridges'', [[Tikkun (magazine)|''Tikkun'']] and ''Modern Poetry in Translation'', and in several anthologies including the [[SUNY Press]] anthology ''Dreaming the Actual: Contemporary Fiction and Poetry by Israeli Women Writers''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.festivaldepoesiademedellin.org/pub.php/en/Revista/ultimas_ediciones/81_82/tzvia.html |title=Rachel Tzvia Back |publisher=Festivaldepoesiademedellin.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also participated in a reading series in America, entitled ''Poetry of a Punished Land: 5 Israeli Poets'', which was co-sponsored by the Israeli Ministry of Culture and Wesleyan University.

In 2002, Back's critical monograph ''Led by Language: the Poetry and Poetics of Susan Howe'', was published by [[University of Alabama Press]].

In 2005, Back's translations of preeminent Hebrew poet [[Lea Goldberg]] in ''Lea Goldberg: Selected Poetry and Drama'' were awarded a [[PEN Translation Fund Grants|PEN Translation Grant]]. This collection of poetry is the most extensive edition of Goldberg's work in English to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shearsman.com/pages/books/authors/backA.html |title=Rachel Tzvia Back – Author Page |publisher=Shearsman Books |date= |accessdate=2012-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Back was also the editor and primary translator of the English edition of the groundbreaking anthology ''With an Iron Pen: Twenty Years of Hebrew Protest Poetry'', which American poet [[Adrienne Rich]] referred to as "a historic collection."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunypress.edu/p-4813-with-an-iron-pen.aspx |title=With an Iron Pen |publisher=SUNY Press, Excelsior Editions |date= |accessdate=2012-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional books of translation include ''Night, Morning: Selected Poems of Hamutal Bar Yosef'' and work collected in ''The Defiant Muse: Hebrew Feminist Poetry from Antiquity to the Present'' ([[The Feminist Press]], 1999) and ''Hebrew Writers on Writing'' ([[Trinity University (Texas)#Trinity University Press|Trinity University Press]], 2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exchanges.uiowa.edu/rachel-tzvia-back/ |title=Rachel Tzvia Back - eXchanges Journal of Literary Translation - The University of Iowa |work=eXchanges |date= |accessdate=2012-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her longitudinal pursuit to bring under-recognized fine Hebrew poets to the awareness of English readers, Back is currently working on a volume of the selected poems of Hebrew poet [[Tuvya Ruebner|Tuvia Ruebner]].

In 2015, Back was a finalist for National Literary Translation Award in Poetry and the National Jewish Book Award in Poetry for the collection ''In the Illuminated Dark: Selected Poems of Tuvia Ruebner''.

==Biography==

Randall was born in [[Los Angeles]] in 1953 and attended [[University of California, Santa Cruz|UC Santa Cruz]] where he was "a permanent Liberal Arts major."&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grahm|first1=Randall|title=Biography|website=Bonny Doon Vineyard|url=https://www.bonnydoonvineyard.com/randall-grahm/biography/}}&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually began working at the Wine Merchant in Beverly Hills sweeping floors. There he had the opportunity to taste great French wines and the experience turned him into "a complete and insufferable wine fanatic.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; He returned to the [[University of California, Davis|University of California at Davis]] to complete a degree in [[Plant Sciences]] in 1979, where he developed a "single-minded obsession with [[Pinot Noir]]"&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

With his family’s assistance, Grahm purchased property in [[Bonny Doon, California|Bonny Doon]], in the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]] where he was intent on producing "The Great American Pinot Noir." Although he initially had trouble with Pinot, he was encouraged by experimental batches of [[Rhône wine|Rhône varieties]], and he has been a tireless champion of Rhône grapes since the inaugural vintage of Le Cigare Volant in 1986. In 1989 Randall appeared on the cover of the [[Wine Spectator]], clad in blue polyester, as "The [[Rhone Rangers|Rhône Ranger]]," a moniker that has followed him ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gibb|first1=Rebecca|title=Randall Grahm to Receive Lifetime Achievement Award|url=http://www.wine-searcher.com/m/2013/03/randall-grahm-to-receive-lifetime-achievement-award|website=wine-searcher.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991 Randall was added to the Who's Who of Cooking in America by Cook's Magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Forster|first1=Laurie|title=Randall Grahm - Bonny Doon Vineyard|url=http://thewinecoach.com/randall-grahm-bonny-doon-vineyard/|website=The Wine Coach}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the same year [[Edward L. G. Bowell|Ted Bowell]] of the Lowell Observatory in northern Arizona named the "[[4934 Rhôneranger]]" asteroid in his honor. He was proclaimed Wine and Spirits Professional of the Year by the [[James Beard Foundation]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zraly|first1=Kevin|title=Windows on the World Complete Wine Course 25th Anniv. Edition|date=September 29, 2009|publisher=Sterling|pages=315}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Randall lectures frequently to wine societies and technical groups, and occasionally contributes "quixotically sincere" articles to wine journals.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; His newsletters and articles were collected and published as the award-winning book, "''Been Doon So Long: A Randall Grahm Vinthology''" in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grahm|first1=Randall|title=Been Doon So Long: A Randall Grahm Vinthology|url=http://www.beendoonsolong.com/book/|website=Been Doon So Long}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 [[The Culinary Institute of America]] inducted him into the Vintner’s Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vintners Hall of Fame Inductees|url=http://www.ciaprochef.com/winestudies/events/vhf_inductees.html|website=The Culinary Institute of America|accessdate=1 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006102721/http://www.ciaprochef.com/winestudies/events/vhf_inductees.html|archivedate=6 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He currently lives in [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]] with his partner Chinshu and their daughter, Amélie.

'''Rashad Khalifa''' ({{lang-ar|رشاد خليفة}}; November 19, 1935 – January 30, 1990) was an [[Egyptian American|Egyptian-American]] [[biochemist]], closely associated with the '''United Submitters International (USI)''', an offshoot reform Islamic group. His teachings, some of which depended on numerological analysis of the Quran, were opposed by [[Traditionalist Muslims]]. He was assassinated on January 31, 1990. 

==Life==

Khalifa was born in Egypt on November 19, 1935. He obtained an honors degree from [[Ain Shams University]], Egypt, before he emigrated to the United States in 1959. He later earned a [[Master's Degree]] in [[biochemistry]] from [[Arizona State University]] and a Ph.D. from [[University of California]].&lt;ref name="RK.life"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.masjidtucson.org/submission/faq/rashad_khalifa_summary.html|title=Submission (Islam): Rashad Khalifa (Messenger of the Covenant), summary and facts|website=www.masjidtucson.org|access-date=2016-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a [[Naturalization|naturalized]] U.S. citizen and lived in [[Tucson, Arizona]].&lt;ref name="RK.life"/&gt; He was married to an American woman and they had a son and a daughter together.

Khalifa worked as a science adviser for the Libyan government for about one year, after which he worked as a chemist for the [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]]. He next worked as a senior chemist in Arizona's State Office of Chemistry in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/RashadKhalifa|title=Rashad Khalifa|last=Federal Bureau of Investigation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was central to the founding of the USI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Doctrine==
Khalifa said that he was a [[Prophets and messengers in Islam|messenger of God]] but not a prophet, and that the archangel [[Gabriel]] "most assertively" told him that chapter 36, verse 3, of the Quran, "specifically" referred to him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masjidtucson.org/quran/appendices/appendix2.html Appendix 2], Authorized English Version of the Quran, Rashad Khalifa, Ph.D.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.masjidtucson.org/quran/appendices/appendix2.html|title=Appendix 2, God's Messenger of the Covenant|website=www.masjidtucson.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He coined the phrase "Final Testament" in reference to the Quran,&lt;ref&gt;''Quaranic Sciences'' - Page 277, Abbas Jaffer - 2009&lt;/ref&gt; with his followers referring to him as "God's Messenger of the Covenant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://submission.org/messenger/|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ZmxTU8Vt?url=http://submission.org/messenger/|archivedate=2008-08-03|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2008-08-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Muslims objected to his interpretations, based on his claim that parts of the Quran were fabricated; precluding him from being a strict [[Quranism|Quranist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://submission.org/two_false_verses_deeper_look.html|title=Two False verses; A Deeper Look {{!}} Submission.org - Your best source for Submission (Islam)|website=submission.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/42736348|title=Quran : the final testament|last=|first=|date=2000|publisher=Universal Unity|others=Khalifa, Rashad.|year=|isbn=1881893030|edition=Rev. ed. 2|location=Fremont, CA.|pages=Appendix 24|oclc=42736348}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In his works, Khalifa claimed that the [[Quran]] contains a mathematical structure based on the number 19. Starting in 1968, Khalifa used computers to analyze the frequency of letters and words in the Quran, with his first book on the topic appearing in 1973.

Khalifa's research did not receive much attention in the [[Western world|West]]. In 1980, [[Martin Gardner]] mentioned it in ''[[Scientific American]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, Martin (1980), Mathematical Games, ''Scientific American'', September 1980, pp16–20.&lt;/ref&gt; Gardner later wrote a more extensive and critical review of Khalifa and his work.&lt;ref&gt;"The numerology of Dr. Rashad Khalifa" - scientist, Martin Gardner, ''Skeptical Inquirer'', Sept-Oct, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Khalifa's first published report in the [[Arab world]] appeared in the Egyptian magazine ''Akher Sa'a'', in January 1973.&lt;ref&gt;''Akher Sa'a magazine'', Egypt, January 24, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; Updates of his research were subsequently published by the same magazine later that year and again in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;''Akher Sa'a magazine'', Egypt, November 28, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Akher Sa'a magazine'', Egypt, December 31, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal charges==
In October 1979, Khalifa was accused in Tucson of sexual assault, sexual abuse, and sexual contact with a minor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The accuser, a 16-year-old-girl, testified at a hearing that Khalifa sexually molested her while supposedly recruiting her for a "United Nations" research project on the human aura.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There was no physical evidence of intercourse found when the girl was examined at a local hospital, although Khalifa admitted to police that he had manipulated the girl's breast during his research.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Justice of the Peace James P. West ruled there was probable cause to hold Khalifa for trial on the charges, due to his admission and "the circumstances under which Khalifa obtained the office".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news

On January 31, 1990, Khalifa was found stabbed to death inside the Masjid (Mosque) of [[Tucson]] Arizona, his place of employment.&lt;ref name=pipes&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pipes|first1=Daniel|title=Finding Rashad Khalifa's Killer|url=http://www.danielpipes.org/blog/2009/04/finding-rashad-khalifas-killer|publisher=Daniel Pipes|accessdate=16 July 2014|date=Apr 28, 2009; updated Dec 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was stabbed multiple times. 

Nineteen years after the murder, on  April 28, 2009, the Calgary Police Services of Canada arrested Glen Cusford Francis, a 52-year-old citizen of [[Trinidad and Tobago]], on suspicion of killing Rashad Khalifa.&lt;ref name="Calgary police nab suspect"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nationalpost.com/related/topics/story.html?id=1547368|title=Calgary police nab suspect in imam killing|last=Massinon|first=Stephane |date=April 30, 2009|work=National Post|publisher=The National Post Company|accessdate=2009-05-23}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigators in Tucson learned that Francis, who was going by the name Benjamin Phillips, had begun his studies under Khalifa in January 1990. Phillips disappeared shortly after the slaying,&lt;ref name="Calgary police nab suspect" /&gt; and was said to have left the country. An investigation revealed Phillips and Francis were the same man when the police analyzed fingerprints found in Phillips' apartment. A specialty unit of the Tucson Police Department progressed in its investigation in 2006 and in December 2008, and was able to use [[DNA testing]] on forensic evidence from the crime scene to tie Francis to the assassination.&lt;ref name="Fugitive denied bail"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://vancouversun.com/Life/Fugitive+held+slaying+American+imam+denied+bail/1621967/story.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090614091749/http://www.vancouversun.com/Life/Fugitive+held+slaying+American+imam+denied+bail/1621967/story.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=June 14, 2009|title=Fugitive held in slaying of American imam denied bail|last=Slade|first=Daryl|date=May 22, 2009|work=The Vancouver Sun|publisher=Canwest Publishing Inc.|accessdate=2009-05-23|df=}} &lt;/ref&gt; In October 2009, a Canadian judge ordered Francis's extradition to the United States to face trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Crime/2009/10/17/11434296-sun.html|title=Calgary suspect closer to trial for U.S. murder|work=The Calgary Sun|last=Martin|first=Kevin|publisher=Sun Media|accessdate=2010-03-18|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120707211142/http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Crime/2009/10/17/11434296-sun.html|archive-date=2012-07-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The trial for the murder began on December 11, 2012. On December 19, the jury, after a three-hour deliberation, found Glen Francis guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced him to life in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://calgaryherald.com/news/Calgarian+faces+life+sentence+1990+murder+controversial/7743101/story.html |title=Calgarian faces life sentence for 1990 murder of controversial U.S. imam |work=Calgary Herald |last=Komarnicki |first=Jamie |publisher=Postmedia Network |accessdate=2012-12-28 |archivedate=2012-12-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228235110/http://www.calgaryherald.com/news/Calgarian+faces+life+sentence+1990+murder+controversial/7743101/story.html |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the Francis trial, James Williams, an alleged member of the [[Jamaat ul-Fuqra]] organization, was convicted of [[Conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy]] in the slaying.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Anderson, "Slain Islamic leader was outspoken; Khalifa's teachings from Tucson angered Muslims worldwide", ''Denver Post'', 21 October 1993, p21.&lt;/ref&gt; Williams disappeared on the day of his sentencing and could not be found.&lt;ref&gt;Dick Foster, "Extremist is 'not to be found'; Little hope held of finding Al-Fuqra fugitive", ''Rocky Mountain News'', 25 February 1994, p8.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 Williams was apprehended attempting to re-enter the United States. and sentenced to serve 69 years in prison. His convictions were upheld on appeal by the [[Colorado Court of Appeals]] except for one count of [[forgery]].&lt;ref&gt;''People v. James D. Williams'', (Colo.

==Life==

Hanbury-Tenison grew up on an [[Anglo-Irish]] estate in [[County Monaghan]] in Ireland, the youngest of five children. In 1959, he married [[Marika Hanbury-Tenison|Marika Hopkinson]]. She became well known for her cookery books.&lt;ref name=Marika1972&gt;Hanbury Tenison, M. ''Deep-Freeze Cookery''. 2nd edition. London. Pan Books, 1972, p. i.&lt;/ref&gt; They had two children, Lucy (b. 1960) and Rupert (b. 1970).&lt;ref name=CV&gt;[http://www.cabilla.co.uk/robinsbooks/documents/26.html Robin Hanbury-Tenison Curriculum Vitae]&lt;/ref&gt; Marika died in 1982.

Hanbury-Tenison and his second wife Louella (née Williams) own a 14th century farmhouse, Cabilla Manor, on [[Bodmin Moor]], which is both their home and a bed and breakfast business. They have a son, Merlin (b. 1985).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.burkespeerage.com/distinguishedFamilies_Sudeley.php|title=Robin Hanbury-Tenison|last=|first=|date=|publisher=Burke's Peerage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957 Hanbury-Tenison was the first person to travel overland by jeep from London to Sri Lanka (Ceylon).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wonderlancer.com/socialogue/robin-hanbury-tenison-survival-international/|title= – Feature|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=WonderLancer}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1958 he and Richard Mason became the first to cross South America overland at its widest point.&lt;ref name="Geographical"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.geographical.co.uk/Magazine/People/Robin_Hanbury-Tenison_-_November_2006.html | title=Robin Hanbury-Tenison | publisher=Geographical | date=November 2006 | author=Smith, Nick}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1964–65 he made the first river crossing of S America from north to south from the Orinoco to Buenos Aires (at first with Sebastian Snow).
In 1968 he took part in the [[Geographical (magazine)|Geographical Magazine]] Amazonas Expedition by Hovercraft from Manaus to Trinidad. Discussions with the [[ethnobotany|ethnobotanist]] [[Conrad Gorinsky]] led to the foundation of the charity [[Survival International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Worlds Apart: An Explorer's Life | publisher=Arrow Books | author=Hanbury-Tenison, Robin | year=1991 | pages = 115–128}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.businessdestinations.com/bd-portrait/robin-hanbury-tenison-the-tale-of-the-explorer-and-philanthropist/|title=Survival|last=|first=|date=|website=Business Destinations}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1971, as Chairman of Survival (and with Marika), he visited 33 Indian tribes in Brazil at the invitation of the Brazilian government and reported on their condition.
In 1977–78 he led the [[Royal Geographical Society]]'s [[Gunung Mulu National Park|Gunung Mulu]] expedition to [[Sarawak]], the Society's largest expedition at that time, taking 115 scientists into the [[rainforest]] for 15 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rgs.org/NR/rdonlyres/B53CB457-9FB6-4F12-B37D-CEFE69519B20/0/MuluBibliography.pdf|title=Mulu Park Expedition|last=|first=|date=|publisher=[[Royal Geographical Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1960 Hanbury-Tenison has farmed over 2000 acres of hill farm on Bodmin Moor in Cornwall with sheep and cattle, diversified with [[Angora goat]]s, [[red deer]] and [[wild boar]] from Russia, and later farming energy from wind, solar, water and biomass.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

In 1982 and 1983 he organised Capital Radio's Venture Days in Battersea Park. 
From 1995 to 1998 he was CEO of the [[British Field Sports Society]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/wildlife-chief-quits-1587029.html|title=BFSS|last=|first=|date=|publisher=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; now the [[Countryside Alliance]]. He organised the Countryside Rally, which brought 130,000 people to Hyde Park in July 1997, and the Countryside March when 300,000 marched through London in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1998/mar/03/listening-to-the-countryside|title=Countryside March Reference |last=|first=|date=|publisher=Hansard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "'''Kobe-Shaq feud'''" (or "'''Shaq-Kobe feud'''") was the conflict between [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) players [[Shaquille O'Neal]] and [[Kobe Bryant]], who played together on the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] team from 1996 to 2004.

The two were able to win three consecutive  [[NBA Championships]] ([[2000 NBA Finals|2000]], [[2001 NBA Finals|2001]], [[2002 NBA Finals|2002]]) and make an NBA Finals appearance in [[2004 NBA Finals|2004]]. O'Neal was the [[NBA Finals MVP]] in each of their victories. Personal differences and arguments over their respective roles on the Lakers were followed by a trade that sent O'Neal to the [[Miami Heat]] while Bryant was re-signed as a free agent by the Lakers. Lakers head coach [[Phil Jackson]] would later write a book entitled ''[[The Last Season: A Team in Search of Its Soul]]'', reflecting on the troubles Bryant and O'Neal had during their last season together.

==Origins: 1996–1999==
===1996–1997===
[[File:Jerry West LA.jpg|thumb|160px|right|General manager [[Jerry West]] brought O'Neal and Bryant to the Lakers in 1996.]]
In 1996, the Los Angeles Lakers acquired the draft rights to high school player [[Kobe Bryant]] from the [[Charlotte Hornets (1988–2002)|Charlotte Hornets]] by trading established center [[Vlade Divac]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

O'Neal told the Lakers when Bryant arrived, "I'm not gonna be babysitting."&lt;ref&gt;[[#lazenby2006|Lazenby 2006]], p.323&lt;/ref&gt; Bryant had extreme confidence in his ability, which was unusual for an 18-year-old. Some teammates interpreted Bryant's confidence as arrogance.&lt;ref&gt;[[#lazenby2006|Lazenby 2006]], p.324&lt;/ref&gt; O'Neal was wary of Bryant, as a rookie, boasting that he would lead the Lakers in scoring and be the best player in the league.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=O'Neal |first1=Shaquille |last2=MacMullan |first2=Jackie |title=Shaq Uncut: My Story |pages=123–124 |year=2011 |publisher=Grand Central Publishing |isbn=978-1-4555-0441-1|ref=oneal2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lakers general manager [[Jerry West]] criticized O'Neal's leadership for [[hazing]] Bryant that season.&lt;ref&gt;[[#oneal2011|O'Neal, MacMullan 2011]], p.131&lt;/ref&gt; While O'Neal's personality was good-humored, Bryant's demeanor was all-business and was interpreted by some teammates as selfishness.&lt;ref&gt;[[#lazenby2006|Lazenby 2006]], p.325&lt;/ref&gt; O'Neal began calling Bryant ''showboat'' because of his flashy offensive moves.&lt;ref&gt;[[#lazenby2006|Lazenby 2006]], p.328&lt;/ref&gt; In an overtime playoff loss to the [[Utah Jazz]] that eliminated the Lakers, O'Neal fouled out with two minutes remaining in regulation. Lakers coach [[Del Harris]] had designed the Laker offense around the rookie Bryant, who went on to shoot four [[air ball]]s. Harris explained that Bryant's one-on-one skills made him the best choice.&lt;ref&gt;[[#lazenby2006|Lazenby 2006]], p.332&lt;/ref&gt; After the game, O'Neal put his arm around Bryant and told him there would be other opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;[[#lazenby2006|Lazenby 2006]], pp.336–7&lt;/ref&gt; West said the team's shortcoming made O'Neal angry since he was going to be judged by the team's success.&lt;ref&gt;[[#lazenby2006|Lazenby 2006]], p.335&lt;/ref&gt;

===1997–1998===
Bryant was assigned by the Lakers to play in the 1997 [[NBA Summer League]] to improve as a team player and learn where to send the ball when he drew [[double team]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#lazenby2006|Lazenby 2006]], p.337&lt;/ref&gt; The following season, Bryant was voted as a starter in the [[1998 NBA All-Star Game|1998 All-Star Game]] though he was a reserve on the Lakers. The Lakers struggled after the All-Star break, losing seven of their first 12 games, and Bryant had a stretch where he made only 30 of 100 shots. O'Neal wanted a championship immediately, and he did not want to wait for Bryant to mature as a player. Harris thought the NBA and its television broadcaster, [[National Broadcasting Company]] (NBC), were overexposing Bryant and that he became more of a one-on-one player after the break.&lt;ref&gt;[[#lazenby2006|Lazenby 2006]], pp.339–342&lt;/ref&gt; Bryant's playing time became reduced. The Lakers were eliminated in the [[1998 NBA Playoffs|1998 playoffs]] in the conference finals after they were swept by the Jazz, 4–0.&lt;ref&gt;[[#lazenby2006|Lazenby 2006]], pp.345–7&lt;/ref&gt;

===1998–1999===
The team's lockout-shortened 50-game [[1998–99 NBA season|1998–99 season]] included a brief stint as a player by [[Dennis Rodman]], the firing of head coach Harris, and the interim head coaching stint of former Laker player [[Kurt Rambis]].&lt;ref name=lakers_history/&gt; During the lockout, O'Neal, Bryant, [[Derek Fisher]], and [[Corie Blount]] played a two-on-two basketball game. Bryant was always a physical player during practice. Other players, though, disliked Bryant's approach to practice. Fisher said, "That was really the way we all should have been playing. With Kobe's spirit." During the game, O'Neal slapped Bryant. Fisher said neither O'Neal nor Bryant really started it, as they were both being physical.&lt;ref&gt;[[#lazenby2006|Lazenby 2006]], p.349&lt;/ref&gt; During the season, the team would blame their problems on what they felt was Bryant's selfish play. At one point, O'Neal pointed at Bryant and told reporters in the locker room, "There's the problem."&lt;ref&gt;[[#lazenby2006|Lazenby 2006]], pp.350–1&lt;/ref&gt; Bryant's jerseys were outselling O'Neal's in [[Southern California]] sporting goods stores, and rumors started that O'Neal was jealous, as he was with [[Penny Hardaway]] when they played together in [[Orlando Magic|Orlando]]. "That's far from the truth", said Fisher. "All Shaq wants to do is win."&lt;ref name=lazenby2006_p351&gt;[[#lazenby2006|Lazenby 2006]], p.351&lt;/ref&gt; Asked if he helped Bryant through his growing pains, O'Neal said "I try not to help guys out too much. Experience is the best teacher ... Kobe's a great player ... He's a new, up-and-coming kid."&lt;ref name=lazenby2006_p351/&gt; O'Neal thought Rambis favored Bryant.&lt;ref&gt;[[#oneal2011|O'Neal, MacMullan 2011]], p.132&lt;/ref&gt; Rambis asked O'Neal, the veteran team leader, to heal the rift and reach out to Bryant. Rambis said O'Neal gave him a "blank, cold stare."&lt;ref&gt;[[#lazenby2006|Lazenby 2006]], p.361&lt;/ref&gt; The rift between O'Neal and Bryant continued into the playoffs.

===1999–2000===
[[File:Phil Jackson 3 cropped.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Coach [[Phil Jackson]]'s arrival led to three consecutive NBA championships for the duo.]]
During the 1999 offseason, West and Lakers owner [[Jerry Buss]] agreed to sign the then six-time NBA champion [[Phil Jackson]] to a high-priced, 5-year $30 million contract to be the team's new head coach entering the [[1999–2000 NBA season|1999–2000 season]].&lt;ref name=tribune_061499/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#lazenby2006|Lazenby 2006]], pp.363–6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wharton_03032013&gt;{{cite news |last=Wharton |first=David |title=Lakers owner Jerry Buss brought 'Showtime' success to L.A. |date=March 3, 2013 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/basketball/nba/lakers/la-me-jerry-buss-20130303,0,7605695,full.story |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ErX80vEX?url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/basketball/nba/lakers/la-me-jerry-buss-20130303,0,7605695,full.story |archivedate=March 4, 2013 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Buss was previously a believer in spending conservatively on coaches,&lt;ref name=wharton_03032013/&gt; but O'Neal and Bryant had both encouraged West to hire Jackson.&lt;ref&gt;[[#lazenby2006|Lazenby 2006]], p.366&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson decided that the offense would revolve around O'Neal, who would be given responsibility to distribute the ball.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[#lazenby2006|Lazenby 2006]], p.378&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson also wanted better leadership, physical conditioning, and defense from O'Neal.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[[#lazenby2006|Lazenby 2006]], p.380&lt;/ref&gt; The coach chose to develop a close relationship with O'Neal and not Bryant.

O'Neal led the league in scoring, averaging 29.7&amp;nbsp;points per game, and he won his first [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; During the playoffs, the Lakers fought off the eighth-seeded [[Sacramento Kings]] in five games, and then defeated the [[Phoenix Suns]] in the second round, four games to one.

It was in the 2000 Western Conference Finals that a defining moment of O'Neal's and Bryant's on-court success together occurred. The Lakers had led the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] three games to one, before dropping Game 5 at home and Game 6 in Portland. The Blazers were leading the decisive Game 7, putting the Lakers on the brink of elimination.  Portland led by 15 points early in the fourth quarter, before the Lakers mounted a 25–4 rally to take the lead. The comeback run culminated as Bryant drove the lane and threw an [[Alley-oop (basketball)|alley-oop]] pass to O'Neal for a one-handed [[slam dunk]] after which O'Neal ran upcourt with his mouth agape and both index fingers waving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Lakers won the game 89–84, and the 13 point comeback after three quarters was the most ever in a Game 7 in the NBA playoffs.  O'Neal had 18 points and 9 rebounds, and Bryant had 25 points, 11 rebounds, 7 assists and 4 blocked shots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The Lakers lost Game 3, which Bryant missed with an ankle injury. After O'Neal fouled out in overtime of Game 4, Jackson spread the floor and had Bryant take over the offense and lead the team to victory. Leading 110–109 with 1:32 remaining in Game 6, Jackson again spread the offense—even with O'Neal on the floor—and again allowed Bryant to take over; the Lakers won the game, 116–111, and won the championship.&lt;ref&gt;[[#lazenby2006|Lazenby 2006]], p.389–91&lt;/ref&gt; In the ensuing celebration, Bryant was the first person to embrace O'Neal.&lt;ref&gt;[[#oneal2011|O'Neal, MacMullan 2011]], p.135&lt;/ref&gt;

"There was a lot of hatred in [O'Neal's] heart ... Kobe just took it and kept going." O'Neal regularly expressed to management that he did not believe the team could win a championship with Bryant. Winter observed that O'Neal influenced the entire team against Bryant.&lt;ref&gt;[[#lazenby2006|Lazenby 2006]], pp.378–9&lt;/ref&gt; Winter thought that Bryant made it a point to get the ball to O'Neal that year, but O'Neal did not appreciate what Bryant was doing to help him.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; During [[2000 NBA All-Star Game|that season's All-Star Game]], Bryant did not participate in the [[Slam Dunk Contest]] and a matchup against [[Vince Carter]], following Jackson's request to pass on individual accomplishments to keep the focus on the team. During All-Star warm-ups, O'Neal mimicked Bryant's [[crossover dribble]] but threw the ball into the stands to accentuate Bryant's turnovers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#lazenby2006|Lazenby 2006]], p.383&lt;/ref&gt; O'Neal said it was an [[inside joke]] between Kobe and him.&lt;ref&gt;[[#oneal2011|O'Neal, MacMullan 2011]], p.146&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson and Winter relied on the [[triangle offense]] to heal the relationship between O'Neal and Bryant. The coaches believed that the offense was so structured that the relationship between the two players would be smoother on the court. The coaches would also tell the team they did not see the selfishness in Bryant that the players saw. Winter even put together a video for O'Neal to show that Bryant was playing his role correctly.&lt;ref&gt;[[#lazenby2006|Lazenby 2006]], pp.379–80&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Derek Fisher.jpg|right|thumb|160px|Losing [[Derek Fisher]] to injury affected the chemistry between O'Neal and Bryant in 2000–01.]]
In 2001, the Lakers won the title again; however, O'Neal and Bryant began feuding during the season. O'Neal came into training camp out of shape, which disappointed Jackson and also Bryant, who worked hard over the offseason to improve his game. Bryant was leading the league in scoring as 2001 began, and Jackson said Bryant was playing the best ball of his career. O'Neal was shooting below 50 percent during stretches, and his free throw shooting was in the 20 percent range.&lt;ref&gt;[[#lazenby2006|Lazenby 2006]], pp.398–9&lt;/ref&gt; O'Neal said of the Lakers in January, "When it was clear that everything went through me, the outcome of it was (a record of) 67–15, playing with enthusiasm, the city jumping up and down and a parade.

In a subsequent interview with [[Jim Gray (sportscaster)|Jim Gray]] of [[ESPN]], Bryant questioned O'Neal's claims of team leadership.  Bryant claimed that O'Neal came into training camp "fat and out of shape", that O'Neal blamed others for the team's defeats, and that O'Neal previously exaggerated the degree to which injuries had affected his game as a cover for simply being out of condition.  Bryant criticized O'Neal's public lobbying for a contract extension when "we have two future Hall of Famers (Malone and Payton) playing here pretty much for free". He also criticized O'Neal for only taking responsibility when the team won.  He accused O'Neal of threatening not to put forth his best effort if he was not passed the ball more often.

[[File:Brian Shaw.jpg|left|thumb|240px|Former teammate [[Brian Shaw]] mediated a feud during 2003.]]
The following day, Lakers scout and former teammate [[Brian Shaw]] mediated between a furious O'Neal and Bryant.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the All-Star break, Buss suspended contract negotiations with Jackson, who was seeking to double his salary from $6 million to $12 million on his expiring contract. Jackson had a contract offer outstanding from the Lakers, but he had not acted on it.  The Lakers also suspended talks with O'Neal, who wanted an extension with a pay raise on his remaining three years for $30 million. The Lakers had hoped O'Neal would take less money due to his age, physical conditioning, and games missed due to injuries. The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote that both of the Lakers moves were a concession to Bryant.&lt;ref&gt;[[#lazenby2006|Lazenby 2006]], pp.421, 423&lt;/ref&gt; The Lakers slid towards mediocrity during the spring. Injuries hampered Los Angeles, keeping them as the fourth seed in the Western Conference midway through the season. The team never came together defensively. Winter said, "Even though Shaq was a big presence, he was not a great shot blocker. And he didn't like to play the screen and roll, so he put his teammates in jeopardy. He didn't like to help [on defense]."&lt;ref&gt;[[#lazenby2006|Lazenby 2006]], p. 426&lt;/ref&gt; In March, after Bryant received internal criticism about his shot selection, he scored just one point while taking three shots in the first half against Orlando which the Lakers trailed by 11. He scored 37 in the second half and tied a team record with 24 in the fourth quarter as the Lakers won in overtime. Against Sacramento in April, Bryant took just one shot in the first half against tight defense. He finished the game with eight points. An anonymous teammate told the ''Los Angeles Times'', "I don't know how we can forgive him." Afterward, Jackson urged Bryant to be more aggressive offensively.&lt;ref&gt;[[#lazenby2006|Lazenby 2006]], pp.425–6&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lakers ultimately entered the playoffs as the second seed, thanks to an overtime victory versus the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] on the final night of the season, courtesy of a pair of buzzer beaters from Bryant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

After the loss, the division between O'Neal and Bryant came to a head. At the news conference after the final game, O'Neal addressed the uncertainty around Coach Phil Jackson's now-expired contract, and Bryant's impending free agency, which meant either or both might not return to the Lakers the next season.  With regard to the issue of people possibly leaving the team, O'Neal commented that he understood that everyone would need to do what was best for themselves, then adding "including me".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

A day after O'Neal was traded, Bryant re-signed with the Lakers for seven years and $136 million. Bryant said he enjoyed playing with both Jackson and O'Neal, and he said he did not influence the Lakers' decisions regarding the two. Regardless, newspapers the next day criticized Bryant for his alleged manipulation of the team.&lt;ref&gt;[[#lazenby2006|Lazenby 2006]], pp.429–30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Winter said, "[O'Neal] left because he couldn't get what he wanted—a huge pay raise. There was no way ownership could give him what he wanted. Shaq's demands held the franchise hostage, and the way he went about it didn't please the owner too much."&lt;ref&gt;[[#lazenby2006|Lazenby 2006]], p.434&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, news came out that Bryant had referred to O'Neal while being questioned by police in 2003. According to reports, Bryant stated that he should have paid off his women so that they wouldn't say anything, like O'Neal. Bryant also stated that O'Neal would pay women up to US$1 million to stay quiet about their rendezvous. It also was reported that investigators had told O'Neal of Bryant's supposed statements shortly after the investigation had begun. O'Neal denied these claims, stating that Bryant had no idea about O'Neal's personal business since the two of them rarely spent any time together. O'Neal went as far as to say that he "[wasn't] the one buying love, [Bryant was] the one buying love", a reference to Bryant's  purchase of a multi-million dollar diamond ring for his wife in the aftermath of the revelation that Bryant had been unfaithful to her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In August 2004, the NBA scheduled the Lakers and the Heat to play on [[National Basketball Association Christmas games|Christmas Day]]. The game registered the NBA's highest regular season [[National Basketball Association Nielsen ratings|television ratings]] since 1998 and would hold its spot until a 2008 Christmas Day meeting between the [[Celtics–Lakers rivalry|Lakers and the Boston Celtics]]. In the lead-up to the game, O'Neal referred to Bryant as a "[[Chevrolet Corvette|Corvette]]" and himself as a "brick wall" in an interview with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC's]] [[Al Michaels]] during halftime of ''[[Monday Night Football]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Before the opening tip, Bryant and O'Neal did not talk, but did greet each other by bumping forearms. During the game, Bryant was fouled by O'Neal several times but the contacts were not excessive. O'Neal fouled out late in the fourth quarter but the Heat still won the game in overtime, led by up-and-coming star, [[Dwyane Wade]]. Bryant missed a potentially game-winning shot as time expired. When asked about the brick wall comment, Bryant said, "I knew there was a lot of talk about the brick wall and all that. But I think that was kind of just to hype the game. Hopefully, this is all behind us now." O'Neal shared a similar tone, saying "I'm over it. It's old news to me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Shaq, Heat get best of Bryant | author = DuPree, David | newspaper = USA Today | date = December 27, 2004 |page=C.14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bryant and O'Neal met on the court twice more during the season, once during the [[NBA All-Star Game]] and once more when the Lakers played the Heat on March 17, 2005.

===2005–2006===
[[File:Shaq gives ball to Bush 2007.jpg|thumb|left|O'Neal with President [[George W.

However, hard feelings were apparently still present when they refused to refer to each other by name while talking to the media. The Lakers and the Heat faced off again on Christmas Day in 2005, with the Heat winning the second time. Unlike last year, Bryant and O'Neal did not shake hands nor make eye contact with each other before and after the game.

In 2015, O'Neal would launch ''The Big Podcast'' with Bryant as his first guest. O'Neal would introduce Bryant as "the greatest Laker ever" as the two reflected on their feud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Listen to Shaquille O'Neal's revealing podcast with Kobe Bryant|url=http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/08/listen-shaquille-oneal-kobe-bryant-podcast|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=May 5, 2017|date=August 31, 2015|last=Schwartz|first=Nick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bryant retired following the [[2015–16 NBA season]], playing his final game on April 13, 2016. Leading the Lakers to a come-from-behind 101–96 victory against the [[Utah Jazz]] with 60 points, Bryant outscored the entire Jazz team 23–21 in the fourth quarter. He was then taken off the floor with 4.1 second remaining, to an uproarious Staples Center crowd. O'Neal, who was in attendance, was the first person that Bryant embraced upon returning to the bench.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Acosta-Delacruz|first=Angelo|title=Kobe finishes his two-decade-long career in a fashionable way as Lakers eliminate Jazz, 101-96|publisher=Powcast Sports Hub|date=April 13, 2016|website=powcast.net|url=http://www.powcast.net/2016/04/kobe-finishes-his-two-decade-long.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/15202045/nba-kobe-bryant-fitting-farewell|title=Mamba out: Kobe Bryant's shocking farewell|publisher=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked about Kobe's legacy during a segment on TNT, Shaq repeated his praise of Bryant as "the greatest Laker ever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aol.com/article/2016/04/13/shaquille-oneal-says-kobe-bryant-is-the-best-laker-ever/21343659/|title=Shaquille O'Neal says Kobe Bryant is the best Laker ever|publisher=AOL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One year later, O'Neal was honored by the Lakers with a statue of his likeness outside [[Staples Center]]. Bryant was in attendance of the statue's unveiling and spoke at the event, which O'Neal said "meant a lot" to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocregister.com/2017/03/24/shaquille-oneal-it-means-a-lot-kobe-bryant-spoke-at-his-statue-unveiling/|title=Shaquille O’Neal: ‘It means a lot’ Kobe Bryant spoke at his statue unveiling|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Addressing Kobe during the ceremony, O'Neal said, "Next time we're out here for a statue, it'll probably be your statue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYq4Et1Tg0E|title=Shaq's Statue Unveiled Outside Of Staples Center (Includes Shaq's Speech!)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, both players recorded a 'Players Only' special for NBATV where they spoke about their history together, the mutual respect and appreciation, and explanations and regrets over the tensions and feud.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2018/02/17/i-owe-you-an-apology-shaquille-oneal-explains-why-he-loves-kobe-bryant-years-after-feud/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plato#Dialogues|Plato's dialogues]] are among the most comprehensive accounts of Socrates to survive from antiquity, though it is unclear the degree to which Socrates himself is "hidden behind his 'best disciple{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kofman |first=Sarah |title=Socrates: Fictions of a Philosopher |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-8014-3551-5 |page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through his portrayal in Plato's dialogues, Socrates has become renowned for his contribution to the fields of [[ethics]] and [[epistemology]]. It is this '''{{visible anchor|Platonic Socrates}}''' who lends his name to the concepts of [[Irony#Socratic irony|Socratic irony]] and the [[Socratic method]], or ''[[wikt:elenchus|elenchus]].''

Socrates exerted a strong influence on philosophers in later [[Ancient philosophy|antiquity]] and in the [[Modern philosophy|modern era]]. Depictions of Socrates in art, literature and popular culture have made him one of the most widely known figures in the [[Western philosophy|Western philosophical tradition]].{{TOC limit|4}}

[[Plato|Plat]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;o and [[Xenophon|Xenophon's]] dialogues provide the main source of information on Socrates' life and thought.&lt;ref&gt;

Retrieved 2015-3-26.&lt;/ref&gt; These writings are the ''Sokratikoi logoi'', or [[Socratic dialogues]], which consist of reports of conversations apparently involving Socrates.&lt;ref&gt;Kahn, CH', [https://books.google.com/books?id=vSXkTBniJZAC&amp;dq=logoi+sokratikoi&amp;q=%22%28sokratikoi+logoi%7D.+These%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22(sokratikoi%20logoi%7D.%20These%22&amp;f=false ''Plato and the Socratic Dialogue: The Philosophical Use of a Literary Form''], Cambridge University Press, 1998, p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Many other writers added to the fashion of Socratic dialogues (called ''Sokratikoi logoi'') at the time. In addition to Plato and [[Xenophon]], each of the following is credited by some source as having added to the genre: [[Aeschines of Sphettus]], [[Antisthenes]], [[Aristippus]], Bryson, Cebes, [[Crito]], [[Euclid of Megara]], and Phaedo. It is unlikely Plato was the first in this field (Vlastos, p. 52).&lt;/ref&gt;

As for discovering the real-life Socrates, the difficulty is that ancient sources are mostly philosophical or dramatic texts, apart from Xenophon. There are no straightforward histories, contemporary with Socrates, that dealt with his own time and place. A corollary of this is that sources that do mention Socrates do not necessarily claim to be historically accurate, and are often partisan. For instance, those who prosecuted and convicted Socrates have left no testament. Historians therefore face the challenge of reconciling the various evidence from the extant texts in order to attempt an accurate and consistent account of Socrates's life and work. The result of such an effort is not necessarily realistic, even if consistent.

Two factors emerge from all sources pertaining to the character of Socrates: that he was ugly, and had a brilliant intellect.&lt;ref name="D.R.

===Socrates as a figure===
The character of Socrates as exhibited in ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]'', ''[[Crito]]'', ''[[Phaedo]]'' and ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'' concurs with other sources to an extent to which it seems possible to rely on the Platonic Socrates, as demonstrated in the dialogues, as a representation of the actual Socrates as he lived in history.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100625043006/https://philosophy.sas.upenn.edu/faculty/kahn CH Kahn], [https://books.google.com/books?id=vSXkTBniJZAC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=historical+works+dealing+with+Socrates&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dbEvVdHgBIzlaKDdgIgP&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=historical%20works%20dealing%20with%20Socrates&amp;f=false Plato and the Socratic Dialogue: The Philosophical Use of a Literary Form (p. 75)], Cambridge University Press, 1998, {{ISBN|0521648300}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, however, many scholars believe that in some works, Plato, being a literary artist, pushed his avowedly brightened-up version of "Socrates" far beyond anything the historical Socrates was likely to have done or said. Also, Xenophon, being an historian, is a more reliable witness to the historical Socrates. It is a matter of much debate over which Socrates it is whom Plato is describing at any given point—the historical figure, or Plato's fictionalization. As British philosopher [[Martin Cohen (philosopher)|Martin Cohen]] has put it, "Plato, the idealist, offers an idol, a master figure, for philosophy. A Saint, a prophet of 'the Sun-God', a teacher condemned for his teachings as a heretic."&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, M., [https://books.google.com/books?id=yhUg7xHDggIC&amp;dq=Martin+Cohen%2C+Philosophical+Tales&amp;q=an+idol#v=snippet&amp;q=an%20idol&amp;f=false ''Philosophical Tales: Being an Alternative History Revealing the Characters, the Plots, and the Hidden Scenes That Make Up the True Story of Philosophy''], John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008, p. 5, {{ISBN|1-4051-4037-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also clear from other writings and historical artefacts, that Socrates was not simply a character, nor an invention, of Plato. The testimony of Xenophon and [[Aristotle]], alongside some of Aristophanes's work (especially ''[[The Clouds]]''), is useful in fleshing out a perception of Socrates beyond Plato's work.

=== Socrates as a philosopher ===

The problem with discerning Socrates's philosophical views stems from the perception of contradictions in statements made by the ''Socrates'' in the different dialogues of Plato; and in later dialogues Plato used the character Socrates to give voice to views that were his own. These contradictions produce doubt as to the actual philosophical doctrines of Socrates, within his milieu and as recorded by other individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophy.msu.edu/people/faculty/debra-nails/ D Nails] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150327182338/http://www.philosophy.msu.edu/people/faculty/debra-nails/ |date=2015-03-27 }}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=fWzD1JxPLn4C&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=Socrates+problem+philosophical+Socrates&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=O7svVfHAIM-Waqj5gcgJ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Socrates%20problem%20philosophical%20Socrates&amp;f=false Agora, Academy, and the Conduct of Philosophy (p. 9)], Springer, 1995, {{ISBN|0792335430}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle, in his ''Magna Moralia'', refers to Socrates in words which make it patent that the doctrine ''virtue is knowledge'' was held by Socrates. Within the ''Metaphysics'', he states Socrates was occupied with the search for moral virtues, being the "first to search for universal definitions for them".&lt;ref&gt;Ahbel-Rappe, S., [https://books.google.com/books?id=GKewlVwJ9rgC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=the+%E2%80%9Creal%E2%80%9D+Socrates&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0v0vVc6KGsjtaJGEgLgP&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20%E2%80%9Creal%E2%80%9D%20Socrates&amp;f=false Socrates: A Guide for the Perplexed (p. 2 and footnote 10 on pp. 157–8)], A&amp;C Black, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem of understanding Socrates as a philosopher is shown in the following: In Xenophon's ''[[Symposium (Xenophon)|Symposium]]'', Socrates is reported as saying he devotes himself only to what he regards as the most important art or occupation, that of discussing philosophy. However, in ''The Clouds'', Aristophanes portrays Socrates as accepting payment for teaching and running a [[Sophist]] school with [[Chaerephon]]. Also, in Plato's ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]'' and ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'', as well as in Xenophon's accounts, Socrates explicitly denies accepting payment for teaching. More specifically, in the ''Apology'', Socrates cites his poverty as proof that he is not a teacher.

Socrates first worked as a stonemason, and there was a tradition in antiquity, not credited by modern scholarship, that Socrates crafted the statues of the [[Charites]], which stood near the Acropolis until the 2nd century AD.&lt;ref&gt;The ancient tradition is attested in [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Paus.+1.22.1 1.22.8]; for a modern denial, see ''Kleine Pauly'', "Sokrates" '''7'''; the tradition is a confusion with the sculptor, [[Socrates of Thebes]], mentioned in Pausanias [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Paus.+9.25.1 9.25.3], a contemporary of [[Pindar]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Xenophon reports that because youths were not allowed to enter the [[Agora]], they used to gather in workshops surrounding it.&lt;ref&gt;Xen. ''Mem.'' 4.2.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Socrates frequented these shops in order to converse with the merchants. Most notable among them was [[Simon the Shoemaker]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Sellars, (2003), Simon the Shoemaker and the Problem of Socrates. Classical Philology 98, 207–216.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Military service ===
For a time, Socrates fulfilled the role of [[hoplite]], participating in the [[Peloponnesian War]]—a conflict which stretched intermittently over a period spanning 431 to 404&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name="JA. Colaiaco - Ph.D. in intellectual history from Columbia, and taught Great Books at New York University in the General Studies Program at NYU.

In the monologue of the ''Apology'', Socrates states he was active for Athens in the battles of [[Battle of Amphipolis|Amphipolis]], [[Battle of Delium|Delium]], and [[Battle of Potidaea|Potidaea]].&lt;ref&gt;Monoson, S.S., Meineck, P., Konstan, D., [https://books.google.com/books?id=y3SoBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR12&amp;dq=Combat+Trauma+and+the+Ancient+Greeks&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Zm4xVd2cJYO5Pd_HgYAF&amp;ved=0CCIQ6wEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Combat%20Trauma%20and%20the%20Ancient%20Greeks&amp;f=false Combat Trauma and the Ancient Greeks (p. 136)], Palgrave Macmillan, 2014, {{ISBN|1137398868}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Symposium'', [[Alcibiades]] describes Socrates's valour in the battles of Potidaea and Delium, recounting how Socrates saved his life in the former battle (219e–221b). Socrates's exceptional service at Delium is also mentioned in the ''[[Laches (dialogue)|Laches]]'' by the General after whom the dialogue is named (181b). In the ''Apology,'' Socrates compares his military service to his courtroom troubles, and says anyone on the jury who thinks he ought to retreat from philosophy must also think soldiers should retreat when it seems likely that they will be killed in battle.&lt;ref&gt;[[Iain King]] details Socrates's military service, including how it may have affected his ideas, in [http://www.military-history.org/articles/thinkers-at-war-socrates.htm Socrates at War (article)], accessed 2014-03-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arrest of Leon ===

=== Trial and death ===
====Causes of the trial====
Socrates lived during the time of the transition from the height of the Athenian [[hegemony]] to its decline with the defeat by [[Sparta]] and its allies in the [[Peloponnesian War]]. At a time when Athens sought to stabilize and recover from its defeat, the Athenian public may have been entertaining doubts about [[democracy]] as an efficient form of government. Socrates appears to have been a critic of democracy,&lt;ref&gt;

{{cite book |last=Wilson |first=Emily R. |title=The Death of Socrates |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2007 |page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:David - The Death of Socrates.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|''[[The Death of Socrates]]'', by [[Jacques-Louis David]] (1787)]]
Claiming loyalty to his city, Socrates clashed with the current course of Athenian politics and society.&lt;ref&gt;Here it is telling to refer to [[Thucydides]] ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Thuc.+3.82.8 3.82.8]): "Reckless audacity came to be considered the courage of a loyal ally; prudent hesitation, specious cowardice; moderation was held to be a cloak for unmanliness; ability to see all sides of a question inaptness to act on any. Frantic violence, became the attribute of manliness; cautious plotting, a justifiable means of self-defense. The advocate of extreme measures was always trustworthy; his opponent a man to be suspected."&lt;/ref&gt; He praised Sparta, archrival to Athens, directly and indirectly in various dialogues. One of Socrates's purported offenses to the city was his position as a social and moral critic. Rather than upholding a status quo and accepting the development of what he perceived as immorality within his region, Socrates questioned the collective notion of "might makes right" that he felt was common in Greece during this period. Plato refers to Socrates as the "[[Social gadfly|gadfly]]" of the state (as the gadfly stings the horse into action, so Socrates stung various Athenians), insofar as he irritated some people with considerations of justice and the pursuit of goodness.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book |last=Waterfield |first=Robin |title=Why Socrates Died: Dispelling the Myths |location=New York |publisher=W.W. Norton and Company |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His attempts to improve the Athenians' sense of justice may have been the cause of his execution.

According to Plato's ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]'', Socrates's life as the "gadfly" of Athens began when his friend Chaerephon asked the [[Pythia|oracle at Delphi]] if anyone were wiser than Socrates; the [[Oracle]] responded that no-one was wiser. Socrates believed the Oracle's response was not correct, because he believed he possessed no wisdom whatsoever. He proceeded to test the riddle by approaching men considered wise by the people of Athens—statesmen, poets, and artisans—in order to refute the Oracle's pronouncement. Questioning them, however, Socrates concluded: while each man thought he knew a great deal and was wise, in fact they knew very little and were not wise at all. Socrates realized the Oracle was correct; while so-called wise men thought themselves wise and yet were not, he himself knew he was not wise at all, which, paradoxically, made him the wiser one since he was the only person aware of his own ignorance. Socrates's paradoxical wisdom made the prominent Athenians he publicly questioned look foolish, turning them against him and leading to accusations of wrongdoing. Socrates defended his role as a gadfly until the end: at his trial, when Socrates was asked to propose his own punishment, he suggested a wage paid by the government and free dinners for the rest of his life instead, to finance the time he spent as Athens' benefactor.&lt;ref&gt;Brun (1978).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robin Waterfield]] suggests that Socrates was a voluntary scapegoat; his death was the purifying remedy for Athens' misfortunes. In this view, the token of appreciation for Asclepius (the Greek god for curing illness) would represent a cure for Athens' ailments.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

====Death of Socrates====
Socrates's death is described at the end of Plato's ''[[Phaedo]]'', although Plato was not himself present at the execution. As to the veracity of Plato's account it seems possible he made choice of a number of certain factors perhaps omitting others in the description of the death, as the Phaedo description does not describe progress of the [[Conium maculatum#Uses and effects|action of the poison]] (Gill 1973) in concurrence with modern descriptions.&lt;ref&gt;C. Gill (1973), [https://learning.hccs.edu/faculty/nathan.poage/phil1301/secondary-sources-on-plato/gill-article/view "The Death of Socrates"] [[Cambridge University Press]]: ''[[The Classical Quarterly]]'' &amp; Houston Community College, Accessed November 23rd, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Phaedo states, after drinking the poison, he was instructed to walk around until his legs felt numb. After he lay down, the man who administered the poison pinched his foot; Socrates could no longer feel his legs. The numbness slowly crept up his body until it reached his heart.

Socrates chose to cover his face during the execution (118 a6 Phaedo).&lt;ref&gt;C. Gill (1973), [https://learning.hccs.edu/faculty/nathan.poage/phil1301/secondary-sources-on-plato/gill-article/view The Death of Socrates] [[Cambridge University Press]]: ''[[The Classical Quarterly]]''  Accessed November 23rd, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Phaedo'' (61c–69e),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/phaedo/section3.rhtml&lt;/ref&gt; Socrates states that "[a]ll of philosophy is training for death".&lt;ref&gt;Laurel A. Madison (2002), [http://archive.wilsonquarterly.com/in-essence/socrates-last-words “Have We Been Careless with Socrates’ Last Words?

=====Last words=====
Socrates' last words are thought to be [[ironic]] (C. Gill 1973),&lt;ref name="The Death of Socrates p.27"/&gt;  or sincere (J. Crooks 1998).&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;J. Crooks, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/639756 Socrates' Last Words: Another Look at an Ancient Riddle]  Cambridge University Press on behalf of The Classical Association, The Classical Quarterly Vol. 48, No. 1 (1998), pp. 117–125 Accessed November 23rd, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  Socrates speaks his last words to Crito; there are several different translations:

A Rereading of the Phaedo"], [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars|Wilson Quarterly Archives]], Accessed November 23rd, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Refusal to escape=====
Socrates turned down Crito's pleas to attempt an escape from prison. Xenophon and Plato agree that Socrates had an opportunity to escape, as his followers were able to bribe the prison guards. There have been several suggestions offered as reasons why he chose to stay:
#He believed such a flight would indicate a fear of death, which he believed no true philosopher has.
#If he fled Athens his teaching would fare no better in another country, as he would continue questioning all he met and undoubtedly incur their displeasure.
#Having knowingly agreed to live under the city's laws, he implicitly subjected himself to the possibility of being accused of crimes by its citizens and judged guilty by its jury. To do otherwise would have caused him to break his "[[social contract]]" with the state, and so harm the state, an unprincipled act.
#If he escaped at the instigation of his friends, then his friends would become liable in law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Allen |first=R.E. |title=Socrates and Legal Obligation |publisher=U of Minnesota Press |year=1981 |pages=65–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The full reasoning behind his refusal to flee is the main subject of the ''[[Crito]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Weiss |first=R. |title=Socrates Dissatisfied: An Analysis of Plato's Crito |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1998 |page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Enid Bloch, [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318118930_Hemlock_poisoning_and_the_death_of_Socrates_did_Plato_tell_the_truth Hemlock poisoning and the death of Socrates: did Plato tell the truth?]  January 2001 Accessed November 23rd, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In as much as Socrates drank hemlock willingly without complaint (having decided against fleeing),  [[R.G.

== Philosophy ==
{{Platonism}}

=== Socratic method ===
{{Main|Socratic method}}
Perhaps his most important contribution to [[Western culture|Western]] thought is his [[dialectic]] method of inquiry, known as the Socratic method or method of "elenchus", which he largely applied to the examination of key moral concepts such as the Good and [[Justice]]. It was first described by Plato in the ''Socratic Dialogues''. To solve a problem, it would be broken down into a series of questions, the answers to which gradually distill the answer a person would seek. The development and practice of this method is one of Socrates's most enduring contributions, and is a key factor in earning his mantle as the father of [[political philosophy]], [[ethics]] or moral philosophy, and as a figurehead of all the central themes in [[Western philosophy]]. The [[Socratic method]] has often been considered as a defining element of American legal education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/nebklr78&amp;div=12&amp;id=&amp;page=|title=The Decline of the Socratic Method at Harvard 78 Nebraska Law Review 1999|website=heinonline.org|access-date=2016-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To illustrate the use of the Socratic method, a series of [[question]]s are posed to help a person or group to determine their underlying [[belief]]s and the extent of their knowledge. The Socratic method is a ''negative'' method of [[hypothesis]] elimination, in that better hypotheses are found by steadily identifying and eliminating those that lead to [[contradiction]]s. It was designed to force one to examine one's own beliefs and the validity of such beliefs.

An alternative interpretation of the dialectic is that it is a method for direct perception of the Form of the Good. Philosopher [[Karl Popper]] describes the dialectic as "the art of intellectual intuition, of visualising the divine originals, the Forms or Ideas, of unveiling the Great Mystery behind the common man's everyday world of appearances."&lt;ref&gt;Popper, K. (1962) The Open Society and its Enemies, Volume 1 Plato, London, Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, p133.&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar vein, French philosopher [[Pierre Hadot]] suggests that the dialogues are a type of spiritual exercise. Hadot writes that "in Plato's view, every dialectical exercise, precisely because it is an exercise of pure thought, subject to the demands of the [[Logos]], turns the soul away from the sensible world, and allows it to convert itself towards the Good."&lt;ref&gt;Hadot, P. (1995) Philosophy as a Way of Life, Oxford, Blackwells, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Philosophical beliefs ===
The beliefs of Socrates, as distinct from those of Plato, are difficult to discern. Little in the way of concrete evidence exists to demarcate the two. The lengthy presentation of ideas given in most of the dialogues may be the ideas of Socrates himself, but which have been subsequently deformed or changed by Plato, and some scholars think Plato so adapted the Socratic style as to make the literary character and the philosopher himself impossible to distinguish. Others argue that he did have his own theories and beliefs.&lt;ref name="Cohn2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cohn |first1=Dorrit |title=Does Socrates Speak for Plato? Reflections on an Open Question |journal=New Literary History |volume=32 |issue=3 |year=2001 |pages=485–500 |issn=1080-661X |doi=10.1353/nlh.2001.0030}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a degree of controversy inherent in the identifying of what these might have been, owing to the difficulty of separating Socrates from Plato and the difficulty of interpreting even the dramatic writings concerning Socrates. Consequently, distinguishing the philosophical beliefs of Socrates from those of Plato and Xenophon has not proven easy, so it must be remembered that what is attributed to Socrates might actually be more the specific concerns of these two thinkers instead.

The matter is complicated because the historical Socrates seems to have been notorious for asking questions but not answering, claiming to lack wisdom concerning the subjects about which he questioned others.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Republic'' 336c and 337a, ''Theaetetus'' 150c, ''Apology'' 23a; Xenophon, ''Memorabilia'' 4.4.9; Aristotle, ''Sophistical Refutations'' 183b7.&lt;/ref&gt;

If anything in general can be said about the philosophical beliefs of Socrates, it is that he was morally, intellectually, and politically at odds with many of his fellow Athenians. When he is on trial for heresy and corrupting the minds of the youth of Athens, he uses his method of ''elenchos'' to demonstrate to the jurors that their moral values are wrong-headed. He tells them they are concerned with their families, careers, and political responsibilities when they ought to be worried about the "welfare of their souls". Socrates's assertion that the gods had singled him out as a divine emissary seemed to provoke irritation, if not outright ridicule. Socrates also questioned the Sophistic doctrine that arete (virtue) can be taught. He liked to observe that successful fathers (such as the prominent military general [[Pericles]]) did not produce sons of their own quality. Socrates argued that moral excellence was more a matter of divine bequest than parental nurture. This belief may have contributed to his lack of anxiety about the future of his own sons.

Also, according to A. A. Long, "There should be no doubt that, despite his claim to know only that he knew nothing, Socrates had strong beliefs about the divine", and, citing Xenophon's ''Memorabilia'', 1.4, 4.3,:
&lt;blockquote&gt; According to Xenophon, he was a [[Teleology|teleologist]] who held that god arranges everything for the best.&lt;ref&gt;Long, AA., in {{cite book |last=Ahbel-Rappe |first=S. |last2=Kamtekar |first2=R. |title=A Companion to Socrates |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2009 |page=59 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=WwpZVuylPgYC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;lpg=PA59&amp;dq=companion+socrates+teleologist#v=onepage&amp;q=companion%20socrates%20teleologist&amp;f=false|isbn=9781405192606 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Socrates frequently says his ideas are not his own, but his teachers'. He mentions several influences: [[Prodicus]] the [[rhetor]] and [[Anaxagoras]] the philosopher. Perhaps surprisingly, Socrates claims to have been deeply influenced by two women besides his mother: he says that [[Diotima of Mantinea|Diotima]] (cf. Plato's ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]''), a witch and priestess from [[Mantinea]], taught him all he knows about ''[[eros (love)|eros]]'', or [[love]]; and that [[Aspasia]], the mistress of [[Pericles]], taught him the art of rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Menexenus 235e''&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Burnet (classicist)|John Burnet]] argued that his principal teacher was the Anaxagorean [[Archelaus (philosopher)|Archelaus]] but his ideas were as Plato described them; [[Eric A. Havelock]], on the other hand, did not accept the view that Socrates's view was identical with that of Archelaus, in large part due to the reason of such anomalies ''and'' contradictions that have surfaced and "post-dated his death."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essays in Ancient Greek Philosophy Volume Two|last=Anton|first=John P.|publisher=SUNY Press|year=1983|isbn=978-0-87395-623-9|location=Albany, New York USA|pages=147–173|chapter="The Socratic Problem: Some Second Thoughts" by Eric A. Havelock}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Socratic paradoxes ===&lt;!--Linked from 'I know that I know nothing'--&gt;
Many of the beliefs traditionally attributed to the historical Socrates have been characterized as "paradoxical" because they seem to conflict with common sense. The following are among the so-called Socratic paradoxes:&lt;ref&gt;p. 14, [[Terence Irwin]], ''The Development of Ethics'', vol. 1, Oxford University Press 2007; p. 147, Gerasimos Santas, "The Socratic Paradoxes", ''Philosophical Review'' 73 (1964), pp. 147–64.&lt;/ref&gt;
* No one desires evil.
* No one errs or does wrong willingly or knowingly.
* Virtue—all virtue—is knowledge.
* Virtue is sufficient for happiness.

The term, "[[Socratic paradox]]" can also refer to a self-referential [[paradox]], originating in Socrates's utterance, "what I do not know I do not think I know",&lt;ref&gt;[[Apology (Plato)|''Apology of Socrates'']] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0170%3Atext%3DApol.%3Asection%3D21d 21d].&lt;/ref&gt; often paraphrased as "[[I know that I know nothing]]."

=== Knowledge ===
The statement "[[I know that I know nothing]]" is often attributed to Socrates, based on a statement in Plato's ''Apology''.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Apology'' 21d; A. Andrea, J Overfield, [https://books.google.com/books?id=x5-aBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA116&amp;dq=Socrates+%22what+I+do+not+know+I+do+not+think+I+know%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2ew2VbORD9HfaKrqgLAP&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Socrates%20%22what%20I%20do%20not%20know%20I%20do%20not%20think%20I%20know%22&amp;f=false The Human Record: Sources of Global History, Volume I: To 1500 (p. 116)], Cengage Learning, 2015, {{ISBN|1305537467}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The conventional interpretation of this is that Socrates's wisdom was limited to an awareness of his own ignorance. Socrates considered virtuousness to require or consist of ''[[Phronesis#Early thought|phronēsis]]'', "thought, sense, judgement, practical wisdom, [and] prudence."&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', Etymology for ''phronesis''. "ϕρόνησις thought, sense, judgement, practical wisdom, prudence".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T Engberg-Pedersen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=oj83D7aBgKMC&amp;pg=PA236&amp;dq=phronesis+Socrates&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xCY4VZOCOdKxaci6gWA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=phronesis%20Socrates&amp;f=false Aristotle's Theory of Moral Insight (p. 236)], Oxford University Press, 1983, {{ISBN|0198246676}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, he believed that wrongdoing and behaviour that was not virtuous resulted from ignorance, and that those who did wrong knew no better.&lt;ref&gt;Amélie Rorty, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QHYKYZGKTgwC&amp;pg=PA268&amp;dq=Socrates+believed+wrongdoing+was+a+consequence+of+ignorance+and+those+who+did+wrong+knew+no+better&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CyY4VcGECoXhaOWCgJAM&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Socrates%20believed%20wrongdoing%20was%20a%20consequence%20of%20ignorance%20and%20those%20who%20did%20wrong%20knew%20no%20better&amp;f=false Essays on Aristotle's Ethics (p. 267)], University of California Press, 1980, {{ISBN|0520040414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The one thing Socrates claimed to have knowledge of was "the art of love" (''ta erôtikê''). This assertion seems to be associated with the word ''erôtan'', which means to ask questions. Therefore, Socrates is claiming to know about the art of love, insofar as he knows how to ask questions.&lt;ref&gt;Reeve, C. D. C., [https://books.google.com/books?id=E1lQNf2EfEUC&amp;pg=PR19&amp;dq=Socrates+-+the+art+of+love&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FAA5VcG1AoPmat2cgcgF&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Socrates%20-%20the%20art%20of%20love&amp;f=false ''Plato on Love''], Hackett Publishing, 2006, pp. xix–xx, {{ISBN|1603844066}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G Rudebusch, [https://books.google.com/books?id=JT12W8PTyQkC&amp;pg=PT104&amp;dq=love+of+wisdom+Socrates&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RF85Vf6ODs3xatXvgNAE&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=love%20of%20wisdom%20Socrates&amp;f=false ''Socrates''], John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2011, {{ISBN|1444358707}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The only time he actually claimed to be wise was within ''Apology'', in which he says he is wise "in the limited sense of having human wisdom".&lt;ref&gt;D P Verene, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mdkods1_jN0C&amp;pg=PA19&amp;dq=He+never+actually+claimed+to+be+wise&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UWg5VcuoKZHLaKOSgLAI&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=He%20never%20actually%20claimed%20to%20be%20wise&amp;f=false Speculative Philosophy (p. 19)], Lexington Books, 2009, {{ISBN|0739136615}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is debatable whether Socrates believed humans (as opposed to gods like [[Apollo]]) could actually become wise. On the one hand, he drew a clear line between human ignorance and ideal knowledge; on the other, Plato's ''Symposium'' (Diotima's Speech) and ''Republic'' (Allegory of the Cave) describe a method for ascending to wisdom.

In Plato's ''Theaetetus'' (150a), Socrates compares his treatment of the young people who come to him for philosophical advice to the way midwives treat their patients, and the way matrimonial matchmakers act. He says that he himself is a true matchmaker (προμνηστικός ''promnestikós'') in that he matches the young man to the best philosopher for his particular mind. However, he carefully distinguishes himself from a [[panderer]] (προᾰγωγός ''proagogos'') or procurer. This distinction is echoed in Xenophon's ''Symposium'' (3.20), when Socrates jokes about his certainty of being able to make a fortune, if he chose to practice the art of pandering. For his part as a philosophical interlocutor, he leads his respondent to a clearer conception of wisdom, although he claims he is not himself a teacher (''Apology''). His role, he claims, is more properly to be understood as analogous to a ''[[midwife]]'' (μαῖα ''maia'').&lt;ref&gt;Boys-Stones, G., Rowe, C., [https://books.google.com/books?id=ec9NAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA173&amp;dq=Theaetetus+Socrates+matchmaker&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7KY8VbqiBMbbate_gAg&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Theaetetus%20Socrates%20matchmaker&amp;f=false The Circle of Socrates: Readings in the First-Generation Socratics], Hackett Publishing, 2013, pp. 173-175.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vander Waerdt, PA., [https://books.google.com/books?id=Etrz2pkeZvwC&amp;pg=PA201&amp;dq=Theaetetus+Socrates+matchmaker&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7KY8VbqiBMbbate_gAg&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Theaetetus%20Socrates%20matchmaker&amp;f=false The Socratic Movement], Cornell University Press, 1994, pp. 200-202.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Theaetetus'', Socrates explains that he is himself barren of theories, but knows how to bring the theories of others to birth and determine whether they are worthy or mere "[[cock egg|wind eggs]]" (ἀνεμιαῖον ''anemiaion''). Perhaps significantly, he points out that midwives are barren due to age, and women who have never given birth are unable to become midwives; they would have no experience or knowledge of birth and would be unable to separate the worthy infants from those that should be left on the hillside to be exposed. To judge this, the midwife must have experience and knowledge of what she is judging.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, [https://books.google.com/books?id=g74pOFTqwcYC&amp;dq=Theaetetus+Socrates+wind+egg&amp;q=%22barren+midwife%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22barren%20midwife%22&amp;f=false ''Theaetetus''].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie, WKC., [https://books.google.com/books?id=a-h35nyFR7IC&amp;dq=socrates+midwives&amp;q=%22other+midwives%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22wind-egg%22&amp;f=false Socrates], Cambridge University Press, 1971, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Virtue ===
[[File:Palermsoc.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.7|Bust of Socrates in the Palermo Archaeological Museum]]
Socrates believed the best way for people to live was to focus on the pursuit of virtue rather than the pursuit, for instance, of material wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brickhouse |first=TC. |last2=Smith |first2=N.D. |title=Socrates on Trial |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1990 |page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; He always invited others to try to concentrate more on friendships and a sense of true community, for Socrates felt this was the best way for people to grow together as a populace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nichols |first=M.P. |title=Socrates and the Political Community: An Ancient Debate |publisher=SUNY Press |year=1987 |page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; His actions lived up to this standard: in the end, Socrates accepted his death sentence when most thought he would simply leave Athens, as he felt he could not run away from or go against the will of his community; as mentioned above, his reputation for valor on the battlefield was without reproach.

The idea that there are certain virtues formed a common thread in Socrates's teachings. These virtues represented the most important qualities for a person to have, foremost of which were the philosophical or intellectual virtues. Socrates stressed that "[[the unexamined life is not worth living]] [and] ethical virtue is the only thing that matters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Duignan |first=B. |title=The 100 Most Influential Philosophers of All Time |publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group |year=2009 |page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Politics ===
It is argued that Socrates believed "ideals belong in a world only the wise man can understand",&lt;ref&gt;Attributed to "Solomon" in {{cite book| title = 100 Most Influential People of All Times for Smartphones and Mobile Devices | publisher = Mobile Reference| year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; making the philosopher the only type of person suitable to govern others. In Plato's dialogue the ''Republic'', Socrates openly objected to the [[democracy]] that ran Athens during his adult life. It was not only Athenian democracy: Socrates found short of ideal any government that did not conform to his presentation of a perfect regime led by philosophers, and Athenian government was far from that. It is, however, possible that the Socrates of Plato's ''Republic'' is colored by Plato's own views. During the last years of Socrates's life, Athens was in continual flux due to political upheaval. Democracy was at last overthrown by a [[Military dictatorship|junta]] known as the [[Thirty Tyrants]], led by Plato's relative, [[Critias]], who had once been a student and friend of Socrates. The Tyrants ruled for about a year before the Athenian democracy was reinstated, at which point it declared an [[amnesty]] for all recent events.

Socrates's opposition to democracy is often denied, and the question is one of the biggest philosophical debates when trying to determine exactly what Socrates believed. The strongest argument of those who claim Socrates did not actually believe in the idea of philosopher kings is that the view is expressed no earlier than Plato's ''Republic'', which is widely considered one of Plato's "Middle" dialogues and not representative of the historical Socrates's views. Furthermore, according to Plato's ''Apology of Socrates'', an "early" dialogue, Socrates refused to pursue conventional politics; he often stated he could not look into other's matters or tell people how to live their lives when he did not yet understand how to live his own. He believed he was a philosopher engaged in the pursuit of Truth, and did not claim to know it fully. Socrates's acceptance of his death sentence after his conviction can also be seen to support this view. It is often claimed much of the anti-democratic leanings are from Plato, who was never able to overcome his disgust at what was done to his teacher. In any case, it is clear Socrates thought the rule of the Thirty Tyrants was also objectionable; when called before them to assist in the arrest of a fellow Athenian, Socrates refused and narrowly escaped death before the Tyrants were overthrown. He did, however, fulfill his duty to serve as ''[[Prytanis]]'' when a trial of a group of Generals who presided over a disastrous naval campaign were judged; even then, he maintained an uncompromising attitude, being one of those who refused to proceed in a manner not supported by the laws, despite intense pressure.&lt;ref&gt;Kagen (1978).&lt;/ref&gt; Judging by his actions, he considered the rule of the Thirty Tyrants less legitimate than the Democratic Senate that sentenced him to death.

Socrates's apparent respect for democracy is one of the themes emphasized in the 2008 play ''[[Socrates on Trial (play)|Socrates on Trial]]'' by [[Andrew David Irvine]]. Irvine argues that it was because of his loyalty to Athenian democracy that Socrates was willing to accept the verdict of his fellow citizens. As Irvine puts it, "During a time of war and great social and intellectual upheaval, Socrates felt compelled to express his views openly, regardless of the consequences. As a result, he is remembered today, not only for his sharp wit and high ethical standards, but also for his loyalty to the view that in a democracy the best way for a man to serve himself, his friends, and his city—even during times of war—is by being loyal to, and by speaking publicly about, the truth."&lt;ref&gt;Irvine, Andrew D. "Introduction," ''Socrates on Trial,'' Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2008, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Covertness ===
In the Dialogues of Plato, though Socrates sometimes seems to support a [[mystical]] side, discussing [[reincarnation]] and the [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery religions]], this is generally attributed to Plato.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McPherran |first=M.L. |title=The Religion of Socrates |publisher=Penn State Press |year=1998 |page=268}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, this view of Socrates cannot be dismissed out of hand, as we cannot be sure of the differences between the views of Plato and Socrates; in addition, there seem to be some corollaries in the works of Xenophon. In the culmination of the philosophic path as discussed in Plato's ''Symposium'', one comes to the [[Sea of Beauty]] or to the sight of "the beautiful itself" (211C); only then can one become wise. (In the ''Symposium'', Socrates credits his speech on the philosophic path to his teacher, the priestess [[Diotima of Mantinea|Diotima]], who is not even sure if Socrates is capable of reaching the highest mysteries.) In the ''Meno'', he refers to the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]], telling Meno he would understand Socrates's answers better if only he could stay for the initiations next week. Further confusions result from the nature of these sources, insofar as the Platonic Dialogues are arguably the work of an artist-philosopher, whose meaning does not volunteer itself to the passive reader nor again the lifelong scholar. According to [[Olympiodorus the Younger]] in his ''Life of Plato'',&lt;ref&gt;Olympiodorus the Younger, ''Life of Plato'', in ''The Works of Plato: A New and Literal Version Chiefly from the Text of Stallbaum'', p. 234, Bohm, 1854.&lt;/ref&gt; Plato himself "received instruction from the writers of tragedy" before taking up the study of philosophy. His works are, indeed, dialogues; Plato's choice of this, the medium of Sophocles, Euripides, and the fictions of theatre, may reflect the ever-interpretable nature of his writings, as he has been called a "dramatist of reason". What is more, the first word of nearly all Plato's works is a significant term for that respective dialogue, and is used with its many connotations in mind. Finally, the ''Phaedrus'' and the ''Symposium'' each allude to Socrates's coy delivery of philosophic truths in conversation; the Socrates of the ''Phaedrus'' goes so far as to demand such dissembling and mystery in all writing. The covertness we often find in Plato, appearing here and there couched in some enigmatic use of symbol and/or irony, may be at odds with the mysticism Plato's Socrates expounds in some other dialogues. These indirect methods may fail to satisfy some readers.

Perhaps the most interesting facet of this is Socrates's reliance on what the Greeks called his "[[Daemon (classical mythology)#Socrates|daimōnic]] sign", an averting (ἀποτρεπτικός ''apotreptikos'') inner voice Socrates heard only when he was about to make a mistake. It was this ''sign'' that prevented Socrates from entering into politics. In the ''Phaedrus'', we are told Socrates considered this to be a form of "divine madness", the sort of [[insanity]] that is a gift from the gods and gives us [[poetry]], [[mysticism]], [[love]], and even [[philosophy]] itself. Alternately, the ''sign'' is often taken to be what we would call "intuition"; however, Socrates's characterization of the phenomenon as ''daimōnic'' may suggest that its origin is divine, mysterious, and independent of his own thoughts. Today, such a voice would be classified under the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' as a [[Hallucinations#Command hallucinations|command hallucination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Leudar |first=I. |last2=Thomas |first2=P. |title=Voices of Reason, Voices of Insanity: Studies of Verbal Hallucinations |publisher=Routledge |year=2013 |chapter=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Socrates practiced and advocated [[Greek divination|divination]].&lt;ref name="J. Mikalson"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VsSDBu3pG4gC&amp;pg=PP123 |author=J. Mikalson |title=Greek Popular Religion in Greek Philosophy |publisher=OUP Oxford |date=June 2010 |page=123 |isbn= 978-0191614675 |accessdate=2015-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Xenophon was thought skilled at foretelling from sacrifices, and attributed many of his knowledges to Socrates within his writing "The Cavalry Commander".&lt;ref name="J. Mikalson"/&gt;

== Satirical playwrights ==

He was prominently lampooned in [[Aristophanes]]'s [[comedy]] ''[[The Clouds]]'', produced when Socrates was in his mid-forties; he said at his trial (according to Plato) that the laughter of the [[theater]] was a harder task to answer than the arguments of his accusers. [[Søren Kierkegaard]] believed this play was a more accurate representation of Socrates than those of his students. In the play, Socrates is ridiculed for his dirtiness, which is associated with the [[Laconophile|Laconizing]] fad; also in plays by [[Callias (Comic Poet)|Callias]], [[Eupolis]], and [[Telecleides]]. Other comic poets who lampooned Socrates include [[Mnesimachus]] and [[Ameipsias]]. In all of these, Socrates and the [[Sophist]]s were criticized for "the moral dangers inherent in contemporary thought and literature".

== Prose sources ==
Plato, Xenophon, and Aristotle are the main sources for the historical Socrates; however, Xenophon and Plato were students of Socrates, and they may idealize him; however, they wrote the only extended descriptions of Socrates that have come down to us in their complete form. Aristotle refers frequently, but in passing, to Socrates in his writings. Almost all of Plato's works center on Socrates. However, Plato's later works appear to be more his own philosophy put into the mouth of his mentor.

=== The Socratic dialogues ===
{{Main|Socratic dialogue}}
[[File:Socrates Botanic Gardens 1.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of Socrates in the [[Irish National Botanic Gardens]]]]
The ''Socratic Dialogues'' are a series of [[dialogue]]s written by Plato and Xenophon in the form of discussions between Socrates and other persons of his time, or as discussions between Socrates's followers over his concepts. Plato's ''[[Phaedo]]'' is an example of this latter category. Although his ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]'' is a monologue delivered by Socrates, it is usually grouped with the Dialogues.

The ''Apology'' professes to be a record of the actual speech Socrates delivered in his own defense at the trial. In the Athenian jury system, an "apology" is composed of three parts: a speech, followed by a counter-assessment, then some final words. "Apology" is an anglicized [[transliteration]], not a [[translation]], of the Greek ''apologia'', meaning "defense"; in this sense it is not apologetic according to our contemporary use of the term.

Plato generally does not place his own ideas in the mouth of a specific speaker; he lets ideas emerge via the [[Socratic Method]], under the guidance of Socrates. Most of the dialogues present Socrates applying this method to some extent, but nowhere as completely as in the ''[[Euthyphro]]''. In this dialogue, Socrates and [[Euthyphro (prophet)|Euthyphro]] go through several iterations of refining the answer to Socrates's question, "...What is the pious, and what the impious?"

In Plato's Dialogues, learning appears as a process of remembering. The [[soul]], before its incarnation in the body, was in the realm of [[Idea]]s (very similar to the Platonic "Forms"). There, it saw things the way they truly are, rather than the pale shadows or copies we experience on earth. By a process of questioning, the soul can be brought to remember the ideas in their pure form, thus bringing [[wisdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Khan |first=C.H. |title=Plato and the Socratic Dialogue: The Philosophical Use of a Literary Form |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Especially for Plato's writings referring to Socrates, it is not always clear which ideas brought forward by Socrates (or his friends) actually belonged to Socrates and which of these may have been new additions or elaborations by Plato—this is known as the [[Socratic Problem]]. Generally, the early works of Plato are considered to be close to the spirit of Socrates, whereas the later works—including ''[[Phaedo]]'' and ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''—are considered to be possibly products of Plato's elaborations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Morrison |first=D.R. |title=The Cambridge Companion to Socrates |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2011 |chapter=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
=== Immediate influence ===

{{See also|Cyrenaics}}
Immediately, the students of Socrates set to work both on exercising their perceptions of his teachings in politics and also on developing many new philosophical schools of thought. Some of Athens' controversial and anti-democratic [[tyrant]]s were contemporary or posthumous students of Socrates including [[Alcibiades]] and [[Critias]]. Critias's cousin Plato would go on to found the [[Academy]] in 385&amp;nbsp;BC, which gained so much renown that "Academy" became the standard word for educational institutions in later European languages such as [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], and [[Italian language|Italian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ahbel-Rappe |first=S. |last2=Kamtekar |first2=R. |title=A Companion to Socrates |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2009 |pages=306–309}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plato's [[protégé]], another important figure of the Classical era, [[Aristotle]] went on to tutor [[Alexander the Great]] and also to found his own school in 335&amp;nbsp;BC—the [[Lyceum]]—whose name also now means an educational institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Magee |first=B |title=The Great Philosophers: An Introduction to Western Philosophy |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2000 |page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While "Socrates dealt with moral matters and took no notice at all of nature in general",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carruccio |first=E. |title=Mathematics And Logic in History And in Contemporary Thought |publisher=Transaction Publishers |year=2006 |page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; in his Dialogues, Plato would emphasize mathematics with metaphysical overtones mirroring that of [[Pythagoras]]—the former who would dominate Western thought well into the [[Renaissance]]. Aristotle himself was as much of a philosopher as he was a scientist with extensive work in the fields of [[biology]] and [[physics]].

Socratic thought which challenged conventions, especially in stressing a simplistic way of living, became divorced from Plato's more detached and philosophical pursuits. This idea was inherited by one of Socrates's older students, [[Antisthenes]], who became the originator of another philosophy in the years after Socrates's death: [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynicism]].

The idea of [[asceticism]] being hand in hand with an ethical life or one with piety, ignored by Plato and Aristotle and somewhat dealt with by the Cynics, formed the core of another philosophy in 281&amp;nbsp;BC—[[Stoicism]] when [[Zeno of Citium]] would discover Socrates's works and then learn from [[Crates of Thebes|Crates]], a Cynic philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Long |first=A.A. |title=Stoic Studies |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1996 |pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Later historical influence ===
[[File:Sughrat.jpg|right|thumb|Depiction of Socrates by 13th century [[Sultanate of Rum|Seljuk]] illustrator ]]

While some of the later contributions of Socrates to [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic Era]] culture and philosophy as well as the [[Roman Era]] have been lost to time, his teachings began a resurgence in both [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]] and the [[Muslim history#Early Caliphate|Islamic Middle East]] alongside those of Aristotle and Stoicism. Socrates is mentioned in the dialogue [[Kuzari]] by Jewish philosopher and rabbi [[Yehuda Halevi]] in which a Jew instructs the [[Khazar]] king about Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hughes |first=Bettany |authorlink=Bettany Hughes |title=The Hemlock Cup: Socrates, Athens and the Search for the Good Life |publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group |year=2011|title-link=The Hemlock Cup: Socrates, Athens and the Search for the Good Life }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al-Kindi]], a well-known Arabic philosopher, introduced and tried to reconcile Socrates and Hellenistic philosophy to an Islamic audience,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |last=von Dehsen |first=C. |title=Philosophers and Religious Leaders |publisher=Routledge |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; referring to him by the name 'Suqrat'.

Socrates influence grew in Western Europe during the fourteenth century as Plato's dialogues were made available in Latin by [[Marsilio Ficino]] and Xenophon's Socratic writings were translated by [[Basilios Bessarion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ahbel-Rappe |first=S. |last2=Kamtekar |first2=R. |title=A Companion to Socrates |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2009 |pages=xix–xx}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Voltaire]] even went so far as to write a [[Voltaire's Socrates (play)|satirical play]] about the [[trial of Socrates]]. There were a number of paintings about his life including ''Socrates Tears Alcibiades from the Embrace of Sensual Pleasure'' by [[Jean-Baptiste Regnault]] and ''The Death of Socrates'' by [[Jacques-Louis David]] in the later 18th century.

To this day, different versions of the [[Socratic method]] are still used in classroom and law school discourse to expose underlying issues in both subject and the speaker. He has been recognized with accolades ranging from frequent mentions in pop culture (such as the movie ''[[Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure]]'' and a Greek rock band called [[Socrates Drank the Conium]]) to numerous busts in academic institutions in recognition of his contribution to education.

Over the past century, numerous plays about Socrates have also focused on Socrates's life and influence. One of the most recent has been ''[[Socrates on Trial]]'', a play based on Aristophanes's ''Clouds'' and Plato's ''Apology'', ''Crito'', and ''Phaedo'', all adapted for modern performance.

=== Criticism ===
Evaluation of and reaction to Socrates has been undertaken by both historians and philosophers from the time of his death to the present day with a multitude of conclusions and perspectives. Although he was not directly prosecuted for his connection to Critias, leader of the Spartan-backed [[Thirty Tyrants]], and "showed considerable personal courage in refusing to submit to [them]", he was seen by some as a figure who mentored oligarchs who became abusive tyrants, and undermined Athenian democracy. The Sophistic movement that he railed at in life survived him, but by the 3rd century BC, was rapidly overtaken by the many philosophical schools of thought that Socrates influenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilson |first=E.R. |title=The Death of Socrates: Hero, Villain, Chatterbox, Saint |publisher=Profile Books |year=2007 |pages=61–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Socrates's death is considered iconic and his status as a martyr of philosophy overshadows most contemporary and posthumous criticism. However, Xenophon mentions Socrates's "arrogance" and that he was "an expert in the art of primping" or "self-presentation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Danzig |first=G. |title=Apologizing for Socrates: How Plato and Xenophon Created Our Socrates |publisher=Lexington Books |year=2010 |pages=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Direct criticism of Socrates the man almost disappears after this time, but there is a noticeable preference for Plato or Aristotle over the elements of Socratic philosophy distinct from those of his students, even into the Middle Ages.

Some modern scholarship holds that, with so much of his own thought obscured and possibly altered by Plato, it is impossible to gain a clear picture of Socrates amid all the contradictory evidence. That both [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynicism]] and [[Stoicism]], which carried heavy influence from Socratic thought, were unlike or even contrary to [[Platonism]] further illustrates this. The ambiguity and lack of reliability serves as the modern basis of criticism—that it is nearly impossible to know the real Socrates. Some controversy also exists about Socrates's attitude towards [[homosexuality]]&lt;ref&gt;[[W. K. C. Guthrie]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=a-h35nyFR7IC&amp;dq= ''Socrates''], Cambridge University Press, 1971, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; and as to whether or not he believed in the [[Olympian gods]], was monotheistic, or held some other religious viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;A. A. Long "How Does Socrates' Divine Sign Communicate with Him?", Chapter 5 in: [https://books.google.com/books?id=WwpZVuylPgYC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''A Companion to Socrates''], John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2009, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is still commonly taught and held with little exception that Socrates is the progenitor of subsequent Western philosophy, to the point that philosophers before him are referred to as [[pre-Socratic]].

'''Sung Jae-gi''' ({{korean|성재기|hanja=成在基}} {{IPA-ko|səːŋ dʑɛgi|}}; September 11, 1967&amp;nbsp;– July 26, 2013) was a [[South Korea]]n [[Men's rights movement|men's rights activist]] and [[anti-feminist]]. Sung founded and was the first chairman of [[Man of Korea]], a men's rights group advocating the abolition of the [[Ministry of Gender Equality and Family]]—whose Korean name (여성부; 女性部) translates as "Ministry of Women"—and demanded compensation for the South Korean military-service requirement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mt.co.kr/view/mtview.php?type=1&amp;no=2013072617191497229 '마포대교 투신' 남성연대 성재기 대표 누구?] 머니투데이 2013.07.26 {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also argued for free love and [[sexual liberation|sexual]] and male liberation.

During the early 21st century, Sung led the South Korean anti-feminist movement opposing female-preferential policies. In early adulthood he was a businessman, and in October 1999 he participated in the movement opposing the abolition of preferential treatment for discharged soldiers. Sung also opposed the abolition of the [[Hoju]] system, and later participated in men's-rights activities. In 2006 he founded the Association of Anti-Feminism and Male Liberation, and in 2007 he founded the Association for the Abolition of the Ministry of Women. The following year, Sung founded [[Man of Korea]] and was its chairman from 2008 until his death in 2013. His business activities included a nightclub and a consulting and [[executive search]] company.

From 1999 until his death Sung argued for the restoration of the [[Korean Army bonus points system]], and during the early 2010s he was an activist for the abolition of women-only facilities.&lt;ref name="weojeon"&gt;[http://news.donga.com/3/all/20130404/54183701/1 여성전용 흡연구역?… “남성 역차별 아니냐” 시끌] 동아일보 2013.04.04 {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, he began offering assistance and counseling to battered husbands, househusbands, teenage runaways and male and child victims of violent crime. Sung opened a shelter for homeless persons, male victims of violent crime, teenage runaways and gay and transgender people. From 1999 to 2013, Sung was part of the [[gender liberation]] and [[Liberalism in South Korea|liberal]] movements and the movement to abolish the women's special-benefits policy.

Near the end of his life Sung was reportedly up to ₩200 million in debt, and on July 25, 2013 he posted on the Man of Korea website his intention to commit suicide.&lt;ref name="lineros"&gt;[http://english.donga.com/srv/service.php3?biid=2013072913348 Suicide performance and journalist ethics] News Dongah&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, in what was thought a publicity stunt to benefit the Men's Alliance (his group), Sung jumped from the [[Mapo Bridge]] in Seoul. His body was found four days later.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/culture/2014/03/141_154369.html 'Avengers' add to Mapo Bridge's strange history] Koreatimes 2014.03.30&lt;/ref&gt;

Sung wrote under the pen names Blue Wolf ({{lang-ko|푸른늑대}}), Tongbalbass ({{lang-ko|똥발바쓰}}) and Tongbal ({{lang-ko|똥발}}), and his nickname was Shimheon (심헌 審軒 or 심헌 心軒). His family is part of the [[Changnyeong Sung clan]] (창녕성씨 昌寧成氏).

== {{anchor|Life|Childhood|Youth}}Early life ==
Sung was born in [[Daegu]] on September 11, 1967. His father was wealthy, and his one uncle was a police officer in Daegu. During his youth, he developed [[masculinity]] and [[machismo]].&lt;ref name="ddangggist"&gt;[http://www.ddanzi.com/ddanziNews/1351628 &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;전문공개&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; 남성연대 성재기를 만나다] The Ddanjinews&lt;/ref&gt; Sung became hostile, and was repulsed by traditional masculine behavior. In adolescence he became convinced of the need for men's liberation: "I was so grown, but nowadays teenage and 20, 30s young men are not like that. They tell another if it hurts, 'I am sick', tell another if they're tired, 'I am tired'.&lt;ref name="ddangggist"/&gt;

At that time Sung became conscious of authority, developed a loathing for the [[patriarchal]] system and complained that South Korean society treated males cruelly. After graduating from [[Daegu High School]], he began studying economics at [[Yeungnam University]] in 1985&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.donga.com/fbin/dfsrchview?n=D010900043166196 여성가족부 상대 ‘가족’ 명칭 사용금지 가처분신청…남성연대 성재기 대표] The Dongah 2012.01.09 {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; and graduated in February 1993.

== {{anchor|Adolescence}}Young adulthood ==
In 1987, Sung joined the South Korean Army and served with the 3rd Infantry Division (육군 제3보병사단 陸軍第三步兵師團) in [[Cheolwon]] ([[Gangwon Province (South Korea)|Gangwon Province]])&lt;ref name="ddangggist"&gt;[http://www.ddanzi.com/ddanziNews/1351628 &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;전문공개&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; 남성연대 성재기를 만나다] The Ddanjinews&lt;/ref&gt; until 1990. He spent his early twenties as an insurance salesman, briefly managing his own business.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.donga.com/3/all/20120109/43173068/1 “남성-가장 위한 정책은 없는데 가족部라뇨”] 동아일보 2012.01.09 {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, he operated a night club in Daegu.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/society/society_general/598136.html 그는 제2의 ‘미시마 유키오’가 되고자 했나] The Hankyeorye 2013.08.02 {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; From August 26 to November 30 of that year, Sung worked for the Thomas McFly Consulting and Headhunting Company (토마스 맥플라이 컨설팅 &amp; 헤드헌팅사) in the [[Dong District, Daegu|Eastern District of Daegu]] before resigning to continue his human-rights campaigns.

During the early 2000s, Sung joined the South Korean men's rights movement and campaigned for a variety of causes. On November 26, 2006 he founded the Association of Anti-Feminism for the Liberation of Men ({{lang-ko|반페미니즘남성해방연대}}), and on January 4, 2007 he founded the Association for the Abolition of the Ministry of Women ({{lang-ko|여성부폐지운동본부}}, 女性部廢止運動本部). In 2013, both groups had several thousand members.&lt;ref name="koreansexism"&gt;[http://www.etoday.co.kr/news/section/newsview.php?idxno=769434 &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;예고 투신&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; 성재기 남성연대 대표, 그는 누구?] etoday 2013.07.29 {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sung campaigned for the abolition of the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family in the [[South Korean presidential election, 2002|2002]] and [[South Korean presidential election, 2007|2007]] presidential elections, questioning its justification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nspna.com/news/?mode=view&amp;newsid=55855 TVN ‘쿨까당’으로 본 여성가족부 존치 논란] NSP통신 {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the 2000s Sung emphasized personal values, individual rights and the right to privacy in his speeches, saying that personal values are God-given rights. He later led a campaign to abolish the Ministry of Gender Equality.&lt;ref name="cosss"&gt;[https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2013/07/116_140056.html Activist missing for 3rd day] koreatimes 2013.07.28&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1994 Sung married Park Eun-kyong, an [[internist]] and professor at the College of Medicine of [[Chung-ang University]]. They had two daughters.

=== {{anchor|Criticism of rigorism and policy}}Criticisms, including pornography control ===
In 1999 Sung opposed abolishing the South Korean military's bonus-points system (군 가산점;軍 加算點)&lt;ref&gt;[http://news1.kr/articles/1224960 성재기, 강용석 NLL 발언에 "욕 좀 하겠다"] Newsone, July 5, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and military veterans' compensation, and supported the abolition of the South Korean female quota (여성 할당제;女性割當制) and female employment quota systems (여성고용할당제;女性雇傭割當制). From 2004 to January 2005, he unsuccessfully opposed the abolition of the [[Hoju]] system (호주제 戶主制). Sung advocated the resurrection of the South Korean military bonus-points system and the abolition of female quotas until his death.

Railing against what he saw as [[female chauvinism]] and Korean [[totalitarianism]], he argued against reverse discrimination, said "Men are humans", objected to unilateral obligations and responsibilities imposed on Korean men and advocated men's liberation. According to Sung, "The oppressive measures on pornography by the Korean government are totally insane ... It is actually seen that it oppresses [[masculinity]] and that it distorts the essentials. It is all done by the Ministry of Gender Equality and women’s organizations led by Korean feminists."&lt;ref name="fevian"&gt;[http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=104&amp;oid=044&amp;aid=0000127216 &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;Voice&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Should pornography be censored?] Koreaharald 2012.12.17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; He argued that the totalitarianism of a few female chauvinists excessively suppressed male sexuality, the arts, pop culture and freedom of expression and thought.

Comparing South Korean government policies to [[prohibition in the United States]], Sung said that restricting [[pornography]] had undesirable side effects and labeled normal men as sex offenders. He encouraged self-examination to overcome sexual [[Puritanism]]: "You will understand easily if you know a bit about men’s sexual mechanism. Pornography itself can ease and satisfy men’s sexual impulses."&lt;ref name="fevian"/&gt; Long criticized for his beliefs, Sung called South Korean policy excessively moralistic and overprotective of women and some South Korean politicians unrealistic and incompetent.

=== Movement to protect military bonus points system ===
From August 1999 to 2001, Sung advocated the protection of the South Korean military's bonus-points system and had a small number of sympathizers. In October 2001 the system was found unconstitutional and repealed, with Sung advocating its reconstruction: "What is my duty? Do you know why Man of Korea started? Because in 1999 military bonus points were abolished! Because of the excuse of gender equality for threatening national security."&lt;ref&gt;[http://sbscnbc.sbs.co.kr/read.jsp?pmArticleId=10000576430 성재기, 강용석 NLL 발언에 욕설…'급 사과'] SBS 2013.07.05 {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sung long argued for the "resuscitation of military bonus points",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajunews.com/kor/view.jsp?newsId=20130729000627 부채 떠안고 한강서 투신한 성재기, 그는 누구?] 아주경제 2013.07.29 {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; reviving a reconstruction movement for the Korean military bonus-points system in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.donga.com/3/all/20130729/56731909/1 ‘한강 투신’ 성재기는 누구? “여가부 폐지·군 가산점 부활” 운동] The Dongah 2013.07.29 {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; He participated in civil-rights and [[Masculism|masculist]] activities,&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.chosun.com/news/ntype.htm?id=201307060100049160003278&amp;servicedate=20130705 성재기, 강용석 NLL 발언에 "XX놈아" 욕설 비난 '파장'] The Chosun 2013.07.05 {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading a male-liberation movement. Sung requested compensation for his mandatory South Korean military service until his death.

=== Men's rights movements ===
==== Fathers' rights movement ====
From 2004 to January 2005 Sung supported the [[Hoju]] system, reasoning that the system supported the last rights of fathers. Feeling that the system had symbolic meaning for fathers and families, he argued with South Korean [[radical feminist]]s on the Internet. The Hoju system was abolished in January 2005, and Sung advocated its revival until his death.

He long criticized the Ministry of Gender Equality. On December 12, 2012, Sung told presidential candidate Park Geun-hye that to "recover lost fathers' rights is the way for my family's happiness".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=110&amp;oid=038&amp;aid=0002331334 &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;위클리 트윗&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; 12월 7일 ~ 12월 13일] 한국일보 2012.12.13 {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== {{anchor|Protection of weak, neglected male}}Male protection ====
From 2008 until his death, Sung was protective of weak men and disadvantaged, [[gay]] and transgender people and advocated for the protection of male and young victims of domestic violence. He opened male-protection facilities,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etoday.co.kr/news/section/newsview.php?idxno=769427 &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;예고 투신&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; 성재기 활동했던 ‘남성연대’는 어떤 단체?] etoday 2013.07.29 {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first on January 26, 2008 in Samsung-dong, [[Gangnam-gu]].

Sung supported refuges in Samseong-dong in Gangnam-gu, Seokcheon-dong in [[Songpa-gu]] and Yeongdeungpo-dong in [[Yeongdeungpo-gu]], Seoul. He opposed racism and discrimination against minorities, male victims of crime, the weak and sexual minorities. Sung encouraged the recognition of [[homophobia]], emphasizing that sexuality is personal,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressbyple.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=24664 남성연대 "故 성재기 뜻 여성혐오 아냐…무분별한 비하 자제하자"] pressbyple 2013.08.02 {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; and provided accommodations and job placement for homeless, unemployed young male runaways and gay and transgender people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/society/society_general/598136.html 그는 제2의 ‘미시마 유키오’가 되고자 했나] Hangyeorye 2013.08.02 {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; He opened the Man of Korea headquarters as a shelter on May 1, 2012.

==== {{anchor|Men's rights protection}}Men's rights ====
{{Main|Sex and the law}}
On January 24, 2011, Sung opened a free facility in Samseong-dong, [[Gangnam-gu]], Seoul for runaway husbands, young deported men, runaway teenage boys and [[homeless]] men. After a slow start, the facility took in an increasing number of people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ddanzi.com/ddanziNews/964670 &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;더딴지&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;남성연대 성재기를 만나다]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== {{anchor|Demand permit of obscene material|International marriage and dating projects|Explanation of obscene material}}Pornography advocacy ====
Sung opposed crackdowns on pornography&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mt.co.kr/view/mtview.php?type=1&amp;no=2012120512023434430&amp;outlink=1 성재기, '대통령시 정상회담 때 비키니' 낸시랭과 화해] Moneytoday 2012.12.05 {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; until his death, arguing that it reduced the number of sex crimes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anewsa.com/detail.php?number=427040 아청법 논란, 성재기 대표 "나도 야동 본다"] Asianews 2012.12.14 {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a conference, he said that if women's attire does not cause sex crimes, neither does pornography.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wikitree.co.kr/main/news_view.php?id=93638 남성연대 대표 "모든 남자가 바바리맨이냐?"] wikitree 2012.11.15 {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Sung, pornography was necessary for economically- and physically-unattractive men. At a November 12, 2011 debate entitled "How Should We Regulate Child Pornography?" hosted by [[Choi Min-hee]] of the Democratic United Party at the National Assembly building in [[Yeouido]], Seoul,&lt;ref name="savetoobsmater" /&gt; Sung said: "Who are those crazy beings who oppose the protection of children and teens against sex crimes? ... The problem is the Burberry men [exhibitionists]. We should catch them, and not just make them not wear Burberry trench coats."&lt;ref name="savetoobsmater" /&gt; Sung became an overnight hero to male [[netizen]]s for defending online pornography and masturbation as benign.&lt;ref name="savetoobsmater"&gt;[http://www.koreabang.com/2012/videos/activist-says-porn-helps-men-and-is-unrelated-to-sex-crimes.html Activist Says Porn Helps Men And is Unrelated to Crimes] koreabang November 19, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

During a public hearing of the National Assembly that day, Sung criticized the Ministry of Gender Equality: "For those people who don't even understand the mechanisms of the male sex, what Youth Sex Protection Law do you want? What law do you want to be made? ... Who are those crazy beings who oppose the protection of children and teens against sex crimes? Of course our priority is to protect kids and teens against sexual offenses. Have any of you watched porn before? Have you watched porn to masturbate? Yes or no? But let me ask you one thing: is your goal to protect children and teenager from sexual offences? or is it to suppress every man’s sexual desire and control his guilt?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Female exposure is not the cause of one’s sex drive, and is not the cause of sex offenses, and yet animated porn becomes the cause of a man’s sex crimes? Please stop making such bullshit claims! I don’t know about other men, but isn’t this nonsense? I too watch porn! And you know why?"&lt;ref name="savetoobsmater"/&gt; He said that pornography was "a means for a man to ease his sex drive, relieve himself, and excrete his load. So because porn amplifies a man’s sex drive, this makes him go outside, find a new victim and commit a new sex crime? Please stop romanticizing the whole thing!"&lt;ref name="savetoobsmater"/&gt; According to Sung, "Just 20 years ago, women would go to the pharmacy and hide their sanitary pads in newspaper and buy them as if they were drugs. But 20 years later, Korean women’s sanitary pads are in your face, and they even have a menstruation festival ... Had men not acknowledged and understood femininity, do you think this would have been possible?"&lt;ref name="savetoobsmater"/&gt;

Why are you making such a fuss about menstruating when the nation’s birthrate is the lowest in the world?"&lt;ref name="titosor"/&gt;

==== White Stockings Campaign ====
Sung mocked the White Tie Campaign organized by the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family, saying that the campaign supported prostitution (although he was said to have supported prostitution).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mt.co.kr/view/mtview.php?type=1&amp;no=2011122915358212265 '성매매 안하면 현금 41만원 입금' 내막 들여다보니...] The Moneytoday 2011.11.29 {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 28–29, 2011, Man of Korea launched their "White Stockings Campaign" in an email to members.

The email claimed that the campaign was supported by the ministry,&lt;ref name="pigliets"&gt;[http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=104&amp;oid=040&amp;aid=0000115439 Anti-sex buying campaign causes stir] Korea times 2011.12.30&lt;/ref&gt; but the campaign lampooned the ministry’s support program for former prostitutes. Man of Korea claimed that under the ministry plan, former prostitutes would receive job training at support centers and the ministry would give them [[South Korean won|₩]]410,000 per month and legal and medical services for up to three years.&lt;ref name="pigliets"/&gt; Sung was criticized for his support of prostitution and said on November 30, "We wanted to show that the ministry’s support program for former prostitutes is not effective. The ministry spends about 11-12 billion won per year on the program. But such support is given to any women who claim they were prostitutes, and the ministry is unable to verify whether they were really engaged in the sex trade or not".
His view that prostitutes were not victims contrasted with that of South Korean feminists,  and he opposed treating female prostitution as a crime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mt.co.kr/view/mtview.php?type=1&amp;no=2013011011472628764 성재기 "자발적 성매매 여성 처벌 위헌 제청은…"] The Moneytoday 2013.01.10 {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sung repeated his intention to survive the jump, saying that the [[bulgogi]] party scheduled for 7 pm in his office that day was still on. "That’s why I said I’ll jump BEFORE 7 o’clock. Let’s eat bulgogi", he said. Before Sung jumped off the bridge, he wrote "I'm confident that I can survive". He checked the depth of the water before he jumped, and arranged for a lifeguard to watch the jump. However, he acknowledged the risk: "If something goes wrong with me, the Secretary General will succeed me as the representative of the association. Please remember me even if my lame attempt fails."&lt;ref name="lineros"/&gt; He left a note:

&lt;poem&gt;{{quote|Dear citizens, ever since the mid-1980s when gender-equality issues came into public awareness, our country has been focusing on overhauling laws, policies and social systems to improve women’s rights and status. We have our first female president. More women pass major government service exams than men. Female ROTCs command conscripted male soldiers. Women surpassed men in university entrance rates and youth employment rates years ago. Despite this, men are still seen as superior while women are seen are "socially weak".

Dear citizens, While everyone else was speaking on behalf of women, Man of Korea started to speak for men. We began our group online in January 2008, and launched a formal civic group in March 2011. We have been treading a thorny path filled with mockery and ridicule. When we said excessive privileges for women should be distributed to men too, we were called male chauvinists. When we said men and women should share equal expenses and we should create an environment where men can also be house husbands, we were called losers. In this country, where discussing male rights is considered to be cheap gossip for losers and you have to discuss national politics to be taken seriously, Man of Korea has been marginalized.

We would like to say that men can also be weak. We wanted to point out that if the gender you were born with determines your rights, privileges and duties, we will never achieve equality. We wanted to say that it is important to create a society where men and women stand on an equal footing and can understand and respect each other. We wanted to talk about the equality of every human beyond gender equality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koreabang.com/2013/stories/male-rights-activist-commits-suicide-on-han-river-bridge.html Male Rights Activist Dies in Publicity Stunt on Han River Bridge] Koreabang August 1, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;/poem&gt;

On July 26, 2013, Sung took a taxi from [[Yeongdeungpo]] to [[Mapo District]] with [[Han Seung-oh]], Lee Ji-hun and five other people. Although he was accompanied by two lifeguards, it had rained heavily that day and the day before.

"'''The Man with the Twisted Lip'''", one of the 56 short [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories written by British author Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], is the sixth of the twelve stories in ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]''. The story was first published in the ''[[Strand Magazine]]'' in December 1891. Doyle ranked "The Man with the Twisted Lip&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; sixteenth in a list of his nineteen favourite Sherlock Holmes stories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trivia-library.com/b/sir-arthur-conan-doyle-favorite-sherlock-holmes-stories.htm Trivia on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Favorite Sherlock Holmes Stories | Trivia Library] &lt;!--Not a great reference, but someone can probably track down the real source...--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
Late at night, Kate Whitney, a friend of [[Dr. Watson]]'s wife, calls on them. Her husband, Isa, has been absent for several days. Frantic with worry, she begs Dr. Watson to fetch him home from the [[opium den]] where he goes. Watson does this; but he also finds his friend Sherlock Holmes in the den, disguised as an old man, seeking for clues among the habitués of the place.

The case involves Mr. Neville St. Clair, a prosperous, respectable, punctual man, who is missing. His family's home is in the country, but he visits London every day on business. One day when Mr. St. Clair was in London, Mrs. St. Clair also went to London separately. She happened to pass down Upper Swandam Lane, a "vile alley" near the London docks, where the opium den is. Glancing up, she saw her husband at a second-floor window of the opium den. He vanished from the window immediately, and Mrs. St. Clair was sure that there was something wrong.

She tried to enter the building; but her way was blocked by the opium den's owner, a [[lascar]]. She fetched the police, but they did not find Mr. St. Clair. The room behind the window was the lair of a dirty, disfigured beggar, known to the police as Hugh Boone. The police were about to put her story down as a mistake of some kind when Mrs. St. Clair noticed a box of wooden toy bricks that her husband said he would buy for their son. A further search turned up some of St. Clair's clothes. Later, his coat, with the pockets stuffed with hundreds of [[History of the English penny|pennies]] and [[History of the halfpenny|halfpennies]], was found on the bank of [[River Thames|Thames]], just below the building's back window.

Hugh Boone was arrested at once, but would say nothing, except to deny any knowledge of St. Clair. He also resisted any attempt to make him wash. Holmes was initially quite convinced that St. Clair had been murdered, and that Boone was involved. Thus his investigation of the den in disguise. He and Watson return to St. Clair's home, to a surprise. It is several days after the disappearance; but that day Mrs. St. Clair had received a letter from her husband in his own handwriting, with his wedding ring enclosed, telling her not to worry. This forces Holmes to reconsider his conclusions, leading him eventually to an extraordinary solution.

Holmes and Watson go the police station where Hugh Boone is held; Holmes brings a bath [[Sponge (tool)|sponge]] in a [[Gladstone bag]]. Finding Boone asleep, Holmes washes the sleeping Boone's dirty face—revealing Neville St. Clair.

Mr. St. Clair has been leading a double life, as a respectable businessman, and as a professional beggar. In his youth, he had been an actor before becoming a newspaper reporter. In order to research an article, he had disguised himself as a beggar for a short time, and collected a surprising amount of money. Later, he was saddled with a large debt, and returned to the street to beg for several days to pay it off. His newspaper salary was meagre and, tempted by the much larger returns of begging, he eventually became a professional beggar. His takings were large enough that he was able to establish himself as a country gentleman, marry well, and begin a respectable family. His wife and children never knew what he did for a living, and when arrested, he feared exposure more than prison or the gallows. But there is no murder, so he is released, and Holmes and the police agree to keep Mr. St. Clair's secret as long as no more is heard of Hugh Boone.

==Points of interest==
The selling of opium or other drugs was in and of itself no crime in the London of 1889. Although the opium den was an environment connected with crime and underworld, it operated openly and legally.

A contention is that many Sherlockian mysteries have solutions based on seemingly unlikely events. The ability of St. Clair to earn a good living begging is considered by some to be such a plot point, but others disagree.&lt;ref name="straight dope"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2255/how-much-money-do-beggars-make|title=How much money do beggars make?|accessdate=2009-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in [[Toronto]] a woman known as the "shaky bag lady" did this very thing, surpassing the efforts of common beggars by presenting herself as more pathetic than legitimate beggars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribemagazine.com/board/tribe-main-forum/5148-shaky-lady.html "Shaky Lady"] TRIBE MAGAZINE Main Forum&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Mumbai]] (formerly Bombay), India, several beggars are reportedly [[Rupee]] millionaires.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mumbaimirror.com/printarticle.aspx?action=add&amp;contentid=20070403022505921474673ed "Millionaire beggars"] ''Mumbai Mirror'' {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130411103321/http://www.mumbaimirror.com/printarticle.aspx?action=add&amp;contentid=20070403022505921474673ed |date=11 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A Putney beggar reportedly earned £300 per day,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2336145/Beggar-sat-outside-Natwest-bank-hungry-homeless-sign-earned-300-A-DAY-living-300-000-flat.html#ixzz2VOlwM0Rp 'Beggar' who sat outside Natwest bank with a 'hungry and homeless' sign raked in £300 A DAY while living in a £300,000 flat], [[Daily Mail]], 5 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; a sum roughly equivalent to the 99th percentile of UK earnings.&lt;ref&gt;[[Income in the United Kingdom#Post tax household income]]&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Grand Central Terminal]] [[panhandler]] claimed to be "raking up" $200 an hour.&lt;ref&gt; Kevin Fasick, Sarah Trefethen, &amp; Kate Sheehy.

In one in-universe point of interest, Watson's wife [[Mary Morstan|Mary]] calls him by the name "James" despite his established first name being "John". This has led [[Sherlockian game|fans to suggest]] that Watson's middle name, which is only alluded to as "H.", could be "Hamish", a variant of the name James. Doyle never addressed the possibility during his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], "Dr. Watson's Christian Name," in ''Unpopular Opinions'' (London: Victor Gollancz, 1946), 148–151.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==
A silent version of "The Man with the Twisted Lip" was [[The Man with the Twisted Lip (film)|filmed in 1921]],&lt;ref name="1921 Version"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.silentera.com/PSFL/data/M/ManwiththeTwistedLip1921.html |title=SilentEra: PSFL:  The Man with the Twisted Lip (1921) |accessdate=2007-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705161532/http://www.silentera.com/PSFL/data/M/ManwiththeTwistedLip1921.html |archivedate=5 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; directed by Maurice Elvey.&lt;ref name="Maurice Elvey"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002061/|title=Maurice Elvey|publisher=[[IMDb]]|accessdate=2007-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, [[Rudolph Cartier]] produced&lt;ref name="credits"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/1181098/credits.html|title=Cartier, Rudolph (1904&amp;ndash;94) &amp;mdash; Film &amp; TV credits|publisher=[[Screenonline]]|accessdate=2007-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; an adaptation entitled ''The Man Who Disappeared''. This adaptation was a pilot for a proposed television series starring [[John Longden]] as Holmes and [[Campbell Singer]] as Watson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/SherlockHolmes-TheManWhoDisappearedfailedPilot |title=The Man Who Disappeared (Failed Pilot) (1951) |accessdate=2012-02-05 |publisher=[[Internet Archive]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, the story was adapted into an episode of the BBC series ''[[Sherlock Holmes (1965 TV series)|Sherlock Holmes]]'' starring [[Douglas Wilmer]] and [[Nigel Stock (actor)|Nigel Stock]], with [[Peter Madden (actor)|Peter Madden]] as Inspector Lestrade and [[Anton Rodgers]] as Neville St Clair. The adaptation developed St Clair's attributed ability at repartee by showing him quoting from the classics, including Shakespeare.

[[Granada Television]] also produced a version in 1986, adapted by [[Alan Plater]] as part of their ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (TV series)|The Return of Sherlock Holmes]]'' television series.&lt;ref name="plater"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/473028/credits.html|title=Plater, Alan (1935&amp;ndash;) &amp;mdash; Film &amp; TV credits|publisher=[[Screenonline]]|accessdate=2007-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Man with the Twisted Lip" was dramatised for [[BBC Radio 4]] in 1990 as part of [[Bert Coules]]' complete radio adaptation of the canon, starring [[Clive Merrison]] as Holmes and [[Michael Williams (actor)|Michael Williams]] as Watson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The 2014 ''[[Sherlock (TV series)|Sherlock]]'' episode "[[His Last Vow]]" begins with Sherlock being found in a drug den by John, reminiscent of the scene in the opium den from this story.

A record number of 290 people joined the list for the first time, of whom 25% hail from China, which produced a world-leading 71 newcomers. The United States came in second, with 57, followed by India, with 28, and Germany, with 23.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alexander|first1=Dan|title=Record 290 Newcomers Join Forbes Billionaires List, Including Michael Jordan|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/danalexander/2015/03/02/record-290-newcomers-join-forbes-billionaires-list-including-michael-jordan/|website=Forbes.com|date=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Zuckerberg]], the social media magnate and founder of [[Facebook]], was placed at number 16 with $33.4 billion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4154">'''Turpal-Ali Atgeriyev''' (1969 &amp;ndash; August 18, 2002) was a [[Deputy Prime Minister]] and [[National Security]] Minister of [[Chechnya]]. Also spelled Turpal, Atgeriev.

== Biography ==

Atgeriev was a former Soviet [[traffic]] [[police]] officer and a veteran of the [[Georgian-Abkhazian War]].  During the [[First Chechen War]] he coordinated all units during the battles of [[Grozny]] and served as a field commander of the [[Shelkovsky District]] of Chechnya, including taking part in the 1996 [[Kizlyar-Pervomayskoye hostage crisis]] in [[Dagestan]].  Later, he became a Deputy Prime Minister in the government of the Chechen [[President]] [[Aslan Maskhadov]].

In July 1999, while trying to engage in talks with the Russian side, Atgeriev was briefly arrested at Moscow's [[Vnukovo]] [[airport]] together with Chechen Deputy [[Prosecutor]]-[[General]] [[Adam Torkhashev]] and two [[officials]] from the Moscow office of the Chechen [[Interior Ministry]]. He has twice told Russian media that he alerted the then [[Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation]] (FSB) Director [[Vladimir Putin]] in the summer of 1999 to the imminent [[Dagestan War|incursion into Dagestan]].&lt;ref name="confirmed"&gt;[http://www.hri.org/news/balkans/rferl/2002/02-08-23.rferl.html CHECHEN DEPUTY PREMIER'S DEATH IN PRISON CONFIRMED] RFE/RL, 02-08-23&lt;/ref&gt; Atgeriev did not take active part in the [[Second Chechen War]] (at this time, he had no armed men under his command besides his personal [[bodyguard]]s). Nevertheless, he was falsely implicated in the scandalous prisoner swap of [[Andrey Babitsky]], a Russian journalist kidnapped by the Russian military.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=7&amp;issue_id=439&amp;article_id=3772  MAKHACHKALA DISTRICT COURT LEAVES BABITSKY CASE UNRESOLVED] The Jamestown Foundation, November 28, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E07EED81739F934A15751C0A9669C8B63 Journalist, Rearrested After Release by Chechens, Assails Russia] ''The New York Times'', February 27, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Atgeriev, whom ''[[Nezavisimaya Gazeta]]'' termed "the last remaining member of the Chechen leadership who is unequivocally loyal to President Aslan Maskhadov," was captured in October 2000 and sentenced to 15 years in prison. On August 18, 2002, while serving the sentence in [[Yekaterinburg]] prison, Atgeriev mysteriously died from "internal bleeding" that was attributed to [[leukemia]], although prior to his conviction he had enjoyed perfect health.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cacianalyst.org/view_article.php?articleid=715 IMPRISONED CHECHEN FIELD COMMANDER DIES MYSTERIOUSLY] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206130045/http://www.cacianalyst.org/view_article.php?articleid=715 |date=2012-02-06 }} CA-CI, December 16, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The Chechen Deputy Premier [[Akhmed Zakayev]] accused the Russian authorities of murdering Atgeriev.&lt;ref name="confirmed"/&gt; His relatives claimed he was [[torture]]d to death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/features/2002/12/16122002174057.asp Russia: Relatives, Chechen Leaders Question Official Version Of Raduev's Death] Radio Free Europe, 16 December 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The case was highlighted in the [[open letter]] by [[Memorial (society)|Memorial]] to Putin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamestown.org/terrorism/news/article.php?articleid=2370843 OPEN LETTER ISSUES WARNING.] The Jamestown Foundation, November 11, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/VV-Shenoy-is-no-more/articleshow/46515896.cms "V.V.Shenoy is no more"], ''[[Times Of India]]'', Belgaum, 10 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

'''V. V. Shenoy''' was born on 15 Feb 1940 in Borkatte, Karkala Taluk, Karnataka. He did his initial schooling in a small village elementary school in [[Borkatte]]. Due to the poor financial conditions at home he got out at the very young age of 14 and ventured out in search of work. He then pursued his high school education at S.V.T. Higher Elementary School, St. Thomas High School, [[Honnavar]] and then [[Janata Vidyalaya, Dandeli]] , part by part, with the help of the finances he managed to earn through the chores he did at various places. He then came to [[Belgaum]] around the year 1963 to pursue his higher education and did his '''Bachelor of Science''' at ''R.L.S. College'', Belgaum. He was known for his commanding and leadership qualities and always had a soft corner for all his fellow students and other people. Be it Academics, extracurricular activities, [[National Cadet Corps (India)]], representing the college or various other organizations and other social activities, he's known to excel in all. During his B.Sc education days, he had to support his family back in his hometown as well as look after his basic needs in Belgaum. This is when he saw and realized the amount of difficulties students faced at their peak age of career decision making and education attaining phase. He then pursued and successfully completed his '''Bachelor of Education''' in Belgaum as he believed that it would help him in understanding the students’ issues and the situation of the educational system. In the year 1968 he started (invented) a unique organization called [[Students' Information &amp; Guidance Bureau]] .

==Students' Information &amp; Guidance Bureau==

[[File:Mr. V.V. Shenoy at SIGB.jpg|thumb|Mr. V.V. Shenoy at SIGB]]

''[[Students' Information &amp; Guidance Bureau]]'' or '''SIGB''' was founded by Vasudev V Shenoy in the year 1968. He was approx 28 years old when he started the institution. Located at Shanivar Khoot, Kakatives in Belgaum City, this Institution provides guidance, detailed information of various courses available at various universities, apprenticeship available at private industrial sectors, scholarships provided by various institutions, government job opportunities, detailed information of banking, LIC and other such examinations, competitive exams, engineering and medical education facilities, job opportunities available for the youth and many other such information in and around Belgaum city and North Karnataka. The institution also had a branch office at Tilakwadi, Belgaum for over 30 years which was later closed in 2006 as he preferred concentrating and personally attending to and devoting his time at one place at the head office. This Institution is not a Government run office, Employment Exchange, University Branch office/Agency or any other Institute but a private run Institution for the well-being of the students.
SIGB has further sub sections of functioning i.e. ''STUDENTS’ HELPLINE'' through which candidates pursue their U.G and P.G correspondence courses for a couple of Universities in Karnataka and ''STUDENTS’ BOOK BUREAU'' where the latest and current Job Opportunities in various sectors are managed for the candidates.

A separate division was started for providing special guidance to the youth and the underprivileged in 1981.
The then Education Minister ''G.B.Shankar Rao'' inaugurated this division and officially became the first member on that day.

''V.V. Shenoy'' personally attended to and guided most of the students to attain information and achieve education in their particular preferred field of interest. A lot of poor or underprivileged students seeking help guidance or information, have gained much so that they could complete their education.  He had a wide range of sources from where he collected all the knowledge and information which he imparted onto the candidates. Important information/ news / ads reported in the various newspapers in various languages are compiled and made available on the notice board for the candidates’ perusal on a daily basis. Job opportunities list is made available to all the candidates on the notice board.

Guides, Books, Old/model question papers thousands of reference books and important education, commerce, science, current affairs etc. related documents, collected from over the last 30 years are made available for the candidates’ reference. This institution has helped and has had above 60 lakh members over the time.

Several personalities and notable persons have visited over the time and commended Shenoy’s unique venture and his desire to work for the society and students in particular. Few of them namely ''G.B. Shankar Rao'', [[S. R. Nayak]], &lt;small&gt;Chairman of Law Commission of Karnataka&lt;/small&gt;, ''OmPrakash'', &lt;small&gt;D.G. &amp; I.G.P, Karnataka State&lt;/small&gt;, ''P J Nayak'', &lt;small&gt;Deputy Commissioner&lt;/small&gt;, ''PS Ramanujan'', ''S.

==Panchavati Terrace Garden/ Horticulture Department==

[[File:Mr. Shenoy addressing the audience at the Horticulture Show, Hume Park, Belgaum.jpg|thumb|Mr. Shenoy addressing the audience at the Horticulture Show, Hume Park, Belgaum.]] 
An interesting "laboratory" for students of the schools around, a pleasant spot for visitors to the house to chat in, a cool tension free retreat for the family to spend an evening in – this is what V.V. Shenoy has created on his modest terrace. In his own words, his garden is a combination of Duty and Beauty. When this duty is undertaken with an eye for beauty, the effort takes a marvelous shape, with vegetable and fruit trees, flowering plants, Crotons and herbs swaying happily in perfect harmony. The variety of plants and trees blending perfectly into a harmony of colors and shapes is bewilderingly wide that it needs the owner to introduce to some of the rare ones. In this garden the mighty Banyan tree stands side by side with the humble shoe flower plant, the common Tulsi, Neem, Bluebells, Jasmines and Roses.
The spicy Clove, Cardamom, Pepper, Jaiphal and Coffee, rub shoulders (or rather branches) with the fragrant Champa, Dreamy Rajnigandha, colourful Mayflower and prosaic Rubber and Coconut trees. All are planted in pots 22" and less in height! Even the spaces below the bigger trees like Jamun, Seedless Mangoes, Chickoo, Mosambi, Pomegranate, Areca nut, Lemon and Guavas are lined with useful herbs like Ajwain, Pudina, Coriander, Lemongrass, Brahmi and Betel Leaves. One can see fruits growing in the most unbelievable conditions like a Mango of the size of a complete human palm, growing on a tree/plant just 3 feet tall, pineapples growing in the pot, large sized pomegranates, lemons, button oranges, sugar lemons, and even 15" long ladies finger on a long slender plant. The garden also boasts of exotic plants like Strawberries, Annapurna (a long leafy plant which put in the cooker while making rice gives an aroma of Basmati rice), AloeVera, Wild Berries, White Jamun or the Jaam, Starfruit, Chayote, Stevia (a plant very famous for diabetes controlling and eradicating powers), Brahmakamal and many more &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/Their-rooftop-is-a-garden-cum-forest/articleshow/9141315.cms |title=Their rooftop is a garden-cum-forest - The Times of India |publisher=Timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date=2011-07-07 |accessdate=2015-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The little green empire on the roof, making a mockery of the usual rough and rugged concrete terrace also mocks at the main misconception connected with gardening – that gardening is the monopoly of the aristocratic with sprawling acres, plenty of money to spend on manure, saplings and gardeners.
This garden is looked after by the family themselves without any professional gardener on duty which is a matter of pride and pleasure for them.  This also leads to another fascinating hobby of ornithology, because of the innumerable birds coming in, thanks to the flowers and fruits.

Natural manure consisting of household waste, dried leaves and flowers from the garden etc. is used in place of chemical and artificial manures. This does away with the problem of garbage disposal and also ill effects of chemical fertilizers are avoided. V. V. Shenoy followed the phrase ''“kasa dinda rasa”'' (best out of waste) very practically. It is not the availability of the water alone that is important but correct management. All the waste water from the kitchen etc. is diverted to the garden for the plants.
This terrace garden also serves as a natural air conditioner for the house controlling the temperature inside it. The natural conditions created within the pots are perhaps excellent guards against extremes of temperatures. Thus even seasonal fruits and vegetables are reaped almost throughout the year.

The accolades of distinguished visitors like the then Union Agriculture Minister [[Balram Jakhar]], Mr. [[Suresh Angadi]], &lt;small&gt; M.P, Bharatiya Janata Party &lt;/small&gt;. Dr. [[Vittal Rai]], Vice-Chancellor of the Agriculture University, Dharwad, Dr. Beer Singh Chowdary, &lt;small&gt; President of the Bharat Krishika Samaj &lt;/small&gt;, U.T. Alwa, &lt;small&gt; Special Secretary to the Government of Karnataka, Forest Department Environment and Ecology &lt;/small&gt; have added to the enthusiasm of the garden lover. 
The Shenoy family believes that if everybody follows this practice, of having at least a small group of plants, will keep the cities cool, green and above all healthy.

V.V. Shenoy has also worked as one of the '''Directors of the Horticulture Department, Belgaum'''. Flower and Fruit shows and exhibitions and competitions have been organized every year in Hume Park, Club Road, Belgaum, under the able guidance and active participation of V. V. Shenoy. He organized, conducted and managed to dedicatedly work for the research and development of plants even amidst his busy schedule involving his activities of his office.

== Personal life ==
V.V. Shenoy married ''Aruna'', daughter of ''Smt. Rukmini'' &amp; ''Shri. Laxman Prabhu'', &lt;small&gt; Headmaster S.V.T.

The '''Vili people''' are Central African ethnic group, established in southwestern [[Gabon]], the [[Republic of the Congo|Republic of Congo]], [[Angola]] and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Democratic Republic of Congo]]. It's a subgroup of [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] and [[Kongo people|Kongo]] peoples. The Vili culture is rich in a secular history, a society that is certainly misogynistic but in which the [[Matriarchy]] is the foundation. of a [[Vili language|Vili]] language full of nuances where proverbs have a prominent place. of an original measurement system,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/afr/mind/mind06.htm|title=At the Back of the Black Man's Mind: Chapter 6.

Nkici-ism|website=www.sacred-texts.com|access-date=2017-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nkisi Konde or [[Nail fetishism|nail fetishes]] are the famous physical representation.

With the [[Yombe people|Yombe]], the Lumbu, the Vungu, the [[Punu people|Punu]] and the Kugni, they lived harmoniously within the former [[Kingdom of Loango]]. They have even developed with the Kugni, the ''Bundiku'', a good neighborly relationship in order to avoid conflicts.

The Vili have very early maintained relations of equal to equal with the Westerners, especially in trade. But this contact with the West will soon turn into his disfavor. [[Triangular trade]] had certainly enriched a tiny minority of indigenous brokers, but it had above all unbalanced the societal structure of the Vili country. The epidemics of [[African trypanosomiasis|trypanosomiasis]], [[smallpox]], the carriage on the back of men had drastically decreased the population of this people.

But it is mainly [[French colonial empire|French colonization]] that will accelerate its [[acculturation]], especially when some Vili will want to mime the colonizer and take themselves for whites.

Not having family griots, ignorant of the conquest, the distant past and the stories that accompany it, the Vili culture is doomed to disappear if nothing is done to save what can still be.

== Name ==
Depending on the source and context, there are several forms: Bavili, Bavilis, Fiote, Ivili, Loango, Vilis. The term fiote ("black"), used by Portuguese settlers, is now considered pejorative. The term of Vili also refers to their cultures, and traditions.

== Language ==
They speak the [[Vili language|Vili]], a Bantu language whose number of speakers was estimated at 50 000 in 2010. Approximately 45 000 were counted in the Republic of Congo and 5 000 in Gabon. The other known names and dialect names are : Civili, Civili ci Loango, Civili ci Moongo, Civili ci Waanda, Civili ci Yombe, Fiot, Fiote, Tshivili, Tsivili. The close ethnic group are: Kotchi, Lindji, Ciyoombe, Woyo, Yombe, Yoombe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.language-archives.org/language/vif|title=OLAC resources in and about the Vili language|website=www.language-archives.org|access-date=2017-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vili, as well as the Yombe (ethnically closest cultural and geographically to Vili people),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Les fondements spirituels du pouvoir au Royaume de Loango|last=Hagenbucher-Sacripanti|first=Frank|publisher=Office de la Recherche Scientifique et Technique Outre-Mer (ORSTOM)|year=1973|isbn=|location=Paris|page=|pages=10–12|language=Fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Lumbu, the Vungu, the [[Punu people|Punu]] and the Kugni, formed the ethnic components of the ancient [[kingdom of Loango]]. There were also intermingling with [[Pygmy peoples|pygmy]] populations of the Babenzi, the Binga or Baka.

In the sixteenth century, the Bawoyo dynasty, which belongs to the mighty Brotherhood of Blacksmiths of the Buvandji, led by Njimbe, and based on an army of warriors, is imposed on the local people on the coast of Loango. According to several sources, such as the English explorer [[Andrew Battel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/strangeadventure00battrich|title=The Strange Adventure of Andrew Battell of Leigh|last=Battel|first=Andrew|publisher=E.G.

E. Dennett|R.E. Dennett]], Njimbe would be the founder of the Kingdom of Loango and his first sovereign with a Reign that would have lasted about sixty years. &lt;gallery mode="slideshow"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;Initially, the province of the [[Kingdom of Kongo]] (Kongo Dia Nthotila - ''Kongo of the King''), the Kingdom of Loango, in the company of the two provinces of [[Ngoyo]] and [[Kakongo]], was freed in the sixteenth century and occupied a vast territory ranging from the region of [[Sette Cama|Setté Cama]] to [[Gabon]], to the current [[Cabinda Province|Cabinda]] to the south, from the Massif of [[Mayombe]] to the east to the confines of the [[Anziku Kingdom]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the west, where the capital Bwali was located. A proverb clearly illustrates the original community of the three secessionist provinces, as well as the religious role of the king of Ngoyo. This is: ''"Makongo Nuni, Mangoyo Nthomi, Maloangu nkasi"'' which literally means ''"the Makongo is the husband, the Mangoyo the priest'' (keeper and officiating of the Tchibila Shrine of the god Bunzi) and the Malwangu the woman".

The ruling family was derived from the Vili ethnic group, specifically the Kondi and Nkata clans. This state had a social and political organization with a king, a government and governors of its seven provinces. The strong political prioritization allowed some chroniclers to establish an analogy with the feudal societies of [[medieval Europe]]. At the time Loango was already prevalent an elective mechanism, particularly in the designation of the future sovereign.

In the history of the Kingdom of Loango, there is no visible trace. However, he soon made exchanges with the Europeans, mostly Portuguese, escaped from the bagnes or former ebony traffickers. Germans, Englishmen, Dutch, had opened Factoreries in the vicinity of the larger villages.

===== The decay of the Kingdom of Loango =====

This incident marked the birth of [[Libreville]], the political capital of [[Gabon]], like [[Freetown]] in [[Sierra Leone]].

The end of the nineteenth century marked the beginning of the decadence of the [[Kingdom of Loango]]. The latter suffered the collateral damage of the rivalry of Europeans in Central Africa, notably between the ship Ensign [[Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza]] and the explorer [[Henry Morton Stanley]]. In order to ensure the unilateral control of the sea front of the Congo and Gabon, [[France]] imposes treaties on the traditional authorities.

The Ma Loango '''Manimakosso-Tchinkosso''', which reigned from 1879 to 1885, weakened by the blockade of the coast established by the Sagittaire ship, preventing any contact between the villages, was forced to capitulate. On 12 March 1883, he signed with ship Lieutenant Robert Cordier, a treaty of sovereignty, trade and disposal of the Territory, in the presence of the Portuguese traders Manuel Saboga and French Ferdinand Pichot. Moreover, the central power of the Ma Loango fades to the benefit of local potentates. Some of them, among them '''André Moe-Loemba''' (indigenous raised by the Portuguese missions, founder of the village of Tchimbamba), '''Mamboma Makosso''', '''Mvumvo Lucieno''' and '''Matchimbamba''' initialled, on 21 June 1883, the Treaty of Punta-Negra, with the same ship Lieutenant Cordier, allowing France to take possession of this territory,
At the same time, in the Portuguese-speaking perimeter, two years later, on 25 February 1885, the princes and notables of the kingdoms of [[Kakongo]], [[Kingdom of Loango|Loango]] and [[Ngoyo]] signed with Guillerme Auguste de Brito Capello, commander of the Corvette ''Rainha of Portugal'', the [[Treaty of Simulambuco]] that puts them under the protection of the [[Kingdom of Portugal]],

The [[Kingdom of Belgium]] signed no less than 289 treaties between 1883 and 1884 in the conquest of the valley of [[Kouilou-Niari River|Kouilou-Niari]], territory ceded to France at the [[Berlin Conference|Berlin conference]] in 1885. It ratifies all these treaties making France the absolute ruler of the part of [[Central Africa]] from the right bank of the [[Congo River]] to the confines of Gabon, thus completing the sharing of Africa between the colonial powers. The control of coastal bases also allowed the departure of numerous expeditions which took place to [[Chad]] and even [[Sudan]] ([[Fashoda Incident|Fashoda incident]]).
Loango, the capital, then houses the Government and the official institutions, managing the internal and external trade. This is the only outlet for the caravan trails to the ocean. At [[Pointe-Noire]], the current economic capital, there are a number of fishing villages such as '''Bou Mvou-Mvou''' (Novotel hotel's location on [[Charles de Gaulle]] Avenue); - literally '''Mvoumvou''' would mean ''what lasts, what is eternal and by extension'' ''M;Bou Mvoumvou'' ''It is the beach, the eternal Sea''-, '''M'Boukou''' (current [[Mouyondzi District]]).

The current peripheral areas of Pointe-Noire at this time are only villages: [[Loandjili district|Loandjili]], Siafoumou, Tchimbamba, Mpita, Tchimani ...
In 1888, the Vili of Gabon occupied [[Mayumba, Gabon|Mayumba]] and exchanged with the Lumbu located along the Banio Lagoon. These two peoples of the [[Kongo people|Kongo]] group understand each other without an interpreter.

King '''Lumbu Mayombe Ignondrou''', the oldest in the region, commanded the [[Mayombe]], [[Mayumba, Gabon|Mayumba]] and part of [[Sette Cama|Setté Cama]]. He settles the discussions between the clan leaders Vili and Lumbu.
The Vili of Mayumba are commissioned by '''Goufila''', and have emancipated themselves from the Ma Loango. The Vili traders of [[Kingdom of Loango|Loango]] who went to [[Sette Cama|Setté Cama]] by the coast, are also often stripped of their bundles of cloths.

===== Decline of the city of Loango and emergence of Pointe-Noire =====
In 1897, the completion of the [[Matadi–Kinshasa Railway|Matadi-Leopoldville]] railway, but especially the foundation of [[Pointe-Noire]] in 1922, in view of the construction of a deep-water port and a railway line, will precipitate the decline of the Capital Loango. Indeed, its bay with its low draught does not allow the landing of ships for the traffic of persons and goods. Loango then only welcomes the burials of the nobles Vili and the settlers.
Moreover, the shipyards of the port and the [[Congo–Ocean Railway|Congo Ocean Railway]] will push the men in the force of the age to emigrate to Pointe-Noire. Except for the small fishing village of Ndjindji, it is the workers of these two shipyards which will constitute the bulk of the indigenous Pointe-Noire population. The city also sees the arrival of people attracted by the induced jobs. These include traders from [[Gabon]], [[Dahomey]], [[Togo]] and [[Ghana]].

The French colonizers, anxious to avoid conflicts with the natives, reserve the areas of swamps, unfit for agriculture and empty of population. They also recognize customary law: the non-fertile land belongs to the whole community. But this rule is not always respected.
Thus, in 1910, the village Koùmbi Bouilika was removed from the map. Its inhabitants, headed by the chief Louissi Sakala, said the elder son of the patriarch Nfouk'-Lassy, were expelled and expropriated from this land by the will of the settlers in the yardstick of the development of Pointe-Noire. The latter, having not found any suitable sites other than this plateau to build a runway that could accommodate aircraft, have therefore unfortunately relocated to this village which was on the current location of the [[Pointe Noire Airport|Agostinho Neto airport of Pointe-Noire]]. It stretched between the current air base and the Tchinouka River, and was adjacent to the villages of Ntié-Tié, Mboukou, Mpaka, Mpolo, Tchimani, Ngoyo, Tchibambouka, Mpita, Tchinouka, Malala and Tchimbamba.

In 1924, Hervé Mapako-Gnali, father of [[Mambou Aimée Gnali]] and [[Jean-Félix Tchicaya]] became the first teachers of the [[Middle Congo]] to get out of the [[William Ponty school|William Ponty School]] on the [[island of Gorée]] in [[Senegal]].
The need for manpower causes the massive influx of people from the interior (which the natives call '''Bilanda Lail''', "rail followers"); Their housing needs contribute to the development of the city. The Vilis, which were hitherto the majority inhabitants of the region, must now share the land and work with the allochthonous populations. They see their habitat area diminishing according to the atomization of the kingdom.

The Kouilou, in addition to being a land of immigration, is also a land of emigration and expatriation during colonization. The creation of coffee and cocoa plantations in [[Fernando Po (Bioko)|Fernando Po]] and [[São Tomé and Príncipe|Sao Tomé]], Portage, schooling and the prospect of receiving a salary cause a significant departure from the local labour force towards [[Brazzaville]], [[Gabon]] and [[Ubangi-Shari]].
Moreover, the Vili, as opposed to the [[Yombe people|Yombe]] people, are less attached to the land because of their commercial vocation and their positioning as intermediaries between the populations of the hinterland and the European traffickers. All these migratory flows will provoke an important rural exodus, accentuating the ageing and gender imbalance. The continuous depopulation of '''Bwali''', the capital of the former [[Kingdom of Loango]] is illustrated.

The combination of epidemics of [[smallpox]] and [[trypanosomiasis]], as well as the use of the test poison (ordeal) to designate the culprits, in particular of suspicious death, also contribute to the decrease in the population of the descendants of the Kingdom of Loango.

==== From 1945 to 1960 - Decolonization ====
{{main|Moyen-Congo Representative Council election, 1946–1947}}
France came out bled of the Second World War. Through a constituent assembly, it sets up new institutions to revive the country's political activity. The representativeness of France is then extended to the Overseas territories such as the AEF, whose indigenous people have the opportunity to elect representatives. While the old colonies like the West Indies elect their deputies by universal suffrage, the AEF. and AOF have two separate electoral colleges: the first reserved for metropolitan citizens and the second for indigenous, non-citizens. Gabon and the Middle Congo, because of their low population, constitute a single constituency for the election of a Member of Parliament for this second college.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.persee.fr/author/persee_258685|title=Goma-Thethet, Joachim - Persée|website=www.persee.fr|language=fr-FR|access-date=2017-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 December 1945, after a second round, Jean-Félix Tchicaya was elected member of the Assembly, before [[Jean-Hilaire Aubame]], [[Jacques Opangault]], Issembé and François-Moussa Simon respectively. Being born in Libreville, the place of emigration of his father, the tailor Makosso Tchicaya allowed the winner to take over his competitors including the Gabonese candidates. In addition to the fact that he worked in Gabon and developed strong friendships, he received the votes of the [[Kongo language|Vili]] and [[Lumbu language|Lumbu]] of the Ngounie, and of the [[Ogooué-Maritime Province|Ogooué-Maritime]]. However, the rivalry between the [[French Congo|Middle Congo]] and [[Gabon]], as well as between the Vili and the [[Mpongwe people|Mpongwe]], the first two ethnicities of the two countries to have been in contact with Western civilization will lead to separation into two separate constituencies.

In 1946, Jean-Félix Tchicaya, grand slayer of Colonialism at the French National Assembly, where he sits throughout the fourth Republic, founded his party the PPC. ([[Congolese Progressive Party]]), close to the French Communist Party, in the company of young executives such as Joseph Pouabou or Robert Stéphane Tchitchelle. The latter, right arm of the founder, will be the main animator of the party in [[Pointe-Noire]] and [[Kouilou Department|Kouilou]]. He rallies around him, all the railwaymen of the [[Congo–Ocean Railway|Congo-Ocean Railway]]. In 1956, he scrambled with his mentor and joined Abbé [[Fulbert Youlou|Youlou]] to found the UDDIA (Democratic Union for the Defence of African interests). The latter party, by politically mobilizing the Laris (inhabitants of Pool district and [[Brazzaville]]), takes political leadership on the PPC and allows Stéphane Tchitchelle to become the first indigenous mayor of Pointe-Noire. He later held several ministerial positions.

The Congo-Brazzaville, in these years of decolonization, is considered one of the frontlines of the anti-communist struggle in French speaking Africa area. Paris wants at all costs that the future independent Congo not be held by the "Reds", but by a friend political leader. Paris had also initially hoped to make Brazzaville the pivot of French action in Central Africa in the direction of Congo-Kinshasa, because all the plots that were aimed at the former Belgian Congo were passed through Brazzaville.

France also anxious to master the aspirations emancipatory in its colonies, uses secret agents such as the Dahomean Antoine Hazoume,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rfi.fr/hebdo/20161118-fonds-hazoume-visage-intime-agent-grande-collecte-afrique-histoire-espion|title=Fonds Hazoumé, le visage intime de l’agent|date=2016-11-18|work=RFI|access-date=2017-09-30|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jeuneafrique.com/230650/politique/jean-pierre-bat-houphou-t-boigny-tait-la-t-te-de-pont-du-syst-me-de-la-fran-afrique/|title=Jean-Pierre Bat : " Houphouët-Boigny était la tête de pont du système " de la Françafrique – JeuneAfrique.com|date=2015-04-30|work=JeuneAfrique.com|access-date=2017-09-30|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; masterpiece of the PPC. Then passed to the UDDIA, or the French Secret Service, to approach the Congolese politicians. Hazoume is a French intelligence officer who was treated by Maurice Robert [the chief Africa of the French Secret Service], and he had joined the political team of Jean Mauricheau-Beaupré [chargé de Mission at the General Secretariat for African Affairs]. African heads of state such as [[Fulbert Youlou]], [[Félix Houphouët-Boigny]] or [[François Tombalbaye|Ngarta Tombalbaye]] made him confiance. It is indeed through its intermediary that France will favour starting from 1956, the victory of Youlou (action on the scale of Congolese territory), to put it on the same footing of equality as its two main rivals [[Jean-Félix Tchicaya]] and [[Jacques Opangault]]. Then France obtained the accession of Youlou and that of its party in the RDA [[Rassemblement Démocratique Africain|African Democratic Rally]] (Rassemblement Démocratique Africain). (Action at the African level) at the beginning of the year 1958; Thus directly competing with Tchicaya, who then withdrew from the RDA. Finally, France opens to Youlou the gates of a universe normally reserved only for African MPs (action at the French level) in this case at Tchicaya.

The African Socialist Movement (MSA) by Jacques Opangault, a local offshoot of the French international and working-class Section (SFIO) of [[Guy Mollet]], won the elections of the Territorial Assembly of 1957. This majority does not survive the defection of Georges Yambot, Member of Parliament for the Grand [[Niari Department|Niari]], thereby tipping the leadership of the MSA. To the UDDIA within the Territorial Assembly in November 1958. Bloody riots and vandalism erupted in Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire, mainly between nationals of the Lari and Mbochi ethnic groups. This troubled period will coincide with the transfer of the capital of the middle Congo from Pointe-Noire to Brazzaville.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://congo-liberty.com/?p=12712|title=UN BRIN D’HISTOIRE : les pères fondateurs du Congo-Brazzaville.

{{main|Moyen-Congo municipal elections, 1956}}

=== Post political Independence ===
The Post independence destiny of the Vili people is closely linked to the geo-political and economic evolution of the republics of [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]], Democratic Congo, [[Gabon]] and [[Angola]].

==== Angola ====
[[File:Cabinda map-fr.svg|left|thumb|240px|Cabinda province map (Angola).]]
[[Cabinda Province|Cabinda]] was incorporated into the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese colonial Empire]], separately from its large neighbour of southern Angola. Indeed, already at that time the two territories were separated by the [[Congo River]].

The second article of the [[Treaty of Simulambuco]], signed in 1885, is often used as an argument by Cabindis separatists. It states that Portugal must ensure the integrity of the Territories under its protection. The Cabindis celebrated in 2005, the 120th anniversary of this Treaty, to the dismay of the Angolan authorities who consider this treaty to be contrary to the state of fact, making Cabinda an Angolan enclave. This differentiated reading of the Treaty is also at the origin of the age-old conflict between the two Parties.

==== Gabon ====

===== Mayumba =====
The Vili of Gabon are mainly located in Mayumba. This locality, which has about 5000 souls, is the last Gabonese city before accessing the neighbouring Congo border.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://voyage-albert-londres.com/2011/06/premiere-gorgee-de-brousse/|title=Première gorgée de brousse {{!}} Albert et nous, un voyage sur les traces d'Albert Londres|last=|first=|date=|website=voyage-albert-londres.com|language=Fr|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The region of Mayumba is known for its still unspoiled wilderness, its immense beaches that stretch out of sight, beaten by violent waves and violent currents.This wild side is highlighted by the [[Mayumba National Park]], which covers about 870 square kilometers. It is the protected sanctuary where a wide spectrum of animal and plant species flourishes. They include crocodiles, chimpanzees, gorillas, various monkeys, leopards, elephants, antelopes, buffaloes. It is also a great place to observe different species of birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mayumbanationalpark.com/planning-gabon-trip-itinerary-see-mayumba-national-park/|title=Explore Gabon’s Natural Wonders - Mayumba National Park Travel Information|date=2017-04-08|work=Mayumba National Park|access-date=2017-10-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The aquatic species are not left with sharks, humpback whales, dolphins and leatherback turtles that come to lay on the beaches. The equatorial forest and the mangroves are home to abundant species of precious trees and plants.
The once prosperous city became ghostly. In fact, there is no viable economic sector. The exploitation of wood, which was the pride of Mayumba, was struck by the economic crisis and by the ban on the export of precious wood and logs.

For export business, only the fishing village of Beninese and Togolese origin serves as a port. Yet the laying of the first stone for the construction of a deep water port dates from 1975, under the chairmanship of Omar Bongo. Until today this work is still not out of the ground and the inhabitants are still waiting, because its viability is not obvious.

===== Libreville =====
The Vili are established long time in the districts of [[Libreville]]: Montagne Sainte, Avenue-de-Cointet, Nombakélé, Petit-Paris, Mont-Boni, Campagne, Glass, Toulon, plein-Niger, Louis.In the 1940s, three of the six great neighborhood leaders, respected, sharing the place of Libreville were Vili: Lamou for Petit-Paris, Loembe for Nombakélé and Loueyi for Toulon-Glass
During the war of 1962, triggered for a goal denied during a match between the national football teams of Gabon (Azingo National) and Congo (Diables rouges), all Gabonese nationals of Congo and vice versa all Congolese of Gabon had been expelled from the two host countries. The Vilis of Libreville, which were few and well identified in the indigenous and Gabonese ethnic strains, were, however, were not disturbed.

The name of the district ', whose semantics can vary according to the intonation, means:

Ah U Kèbè! Dangerous! Attention!
or: Kéba! Attention, sorry
or: Kèbe, keep one thing

==== Congo-Brazzaville ====
In Congo-Brazzaville, abbé [[Fulbert Youlou]] led the country to independence which was initialled on 15 August 1960. Stéphane Tchitchellé was a member of the Congolese delegation on 28 July 1960, which signed the agreements, ensuring the transfer of powers from the French authorities to the Congolese authorities. He also became vice President of the Republic. This short-lived euphoria makes way for the takeover of Power by the revolutionary MNR (National Revolution Movement) during the days of 13, 14 and 15 August 1963, which establish the courts of exception and the witch hunt. Personalities like Stéphane Tchitchellé or Victor-Justin Sathoud,for instance were put in prison. The first President of the Supreme Court of the Congo Joseph Pouabou, the director of the Congolese Information agency Abbé Anselme Massouémé, both Vili and native of the Pointe-Noire region and the first Prosecutor of the Republic Lazare Matsocota, originally from the Pool, are abducted and murdered on the night of 14–15 February 1965. Above the horror, the body of Joseph Pouabou was never found. The perpetrators of these crimes have never been identified to date.
In 1968, the militarization of the Congolese political landscape began. Progressive soldiers with their heads, Lieutenant [[Marien Ngouabi]] and other officers such as [[Alfred Raoul]] and [[Louis Sylvain Goma]], all three Saint-Cyriens (Saint-Cyr is a French Military Academy), made their entry into the political scene in favour of a coup. A revolutionary Court of Justice is established. Ngouoniba Nsari and Christophe Moukouéké are the president and vice President respectively.

The group of "Mpita" consisting of three Vili originating in the region of the [[Kouilou Department|Kouilou]] that are, the police officer André Tchicya, the two financial administrators Paul Bouanga and Georges Goma is accused by this Court of Justice of flirting with capitalists and therefore to work against the development and interests of the Congo. They will be acquitted by the same court on 26 September 1969.

Stanislas Batchi, former headmaster of the Lycée Chaminade (Drapeau Rouge), was president of the popular court and was dubbed the ''"red Prosecutor"''. In this capacity, he was instructed to investigate cases involving his friends or accused who claimed the same ethnic identity as him. Thus, by asking Stéphane Tchitchéllé to stand up, the latter, astonished to see him play this role as hangman, reminded him in the Vili language, all the services he had rendered to the Prosecutor and all the times, where he had received him for dinner. [[Stanislas Batchi]] replied that he was not in the process of settling a family dispute, but a highly important matter related to the security of the state.This example from the "Mpita Group" case shows how to violating the rules of mutual assistance, by using cynicism towards his own, by getting their hands dirty, allegiance to the new political order and safeguarding his Position in the leading core. It is also an illustration of the propensity of Vili to focus on individual success at the expense of the community. This is the exact opposite, with a few exceptions, of the functioning of the Lari and the Kongo peoples of the south part of the Republic of Congo, of the citizens of the [[Niari Valley]], or of the [[Mbochi people|Mbochis]] of the [[Cuvette Department|Cuvette department]] for whom solidarity is a sacred value.

During the Seventies decade, the young country that became the People's Republic of the Congo asked all young foreign-trained executives to return to the fold to accompany its development. Women once confined to the role of reproductive and domestic work, are emancipated and also take part in the development of the country. Thus, politically, Josephine Bouanga was elected president of the revolutionary Union of women of the Congo (URFC) at the end of the 2nd Extraordinary Congress of this Organization held on November 15, 1969. She replaces this function, Céline Claudette Eckomband Yandza.

In civil society, in the precinct of the Brazzaville courthouse, [[Agathe Pembellot|Agathe Pembellot Mambou]], sworn on 11 March 1973. She became the first female magistrate of the Republic of Congo.

== Demography and Territory ==

=== Demographics ===
The Kouilou department covers the maritime façade of the Republic of Congo. This territory is occupied mainly on the coastal plain to the West, by the Vili, and in the Mayombe Forest Massif in the east by the Yombe. The Vili and te Yombe languages are mutually intelligible.

The North is occupied by the [[Limbu people|Lumbu]] minorities (bantu Échira) and [[Pygmy peoples|Pygmy]] [[Bongo people (Gabon)|Babongo]].

The Vili are mainly distributed in a triangle formed by the Atlantic coast as a base, going from [[Madingo-Kayes]] to the [[Cabinda Province|Cabinda]] border and the locality of Tchikanou on the road to [[Tchitondi]] (formerly Holle) as the summit. In addition to those mentioned above, they are found in the villages of Tchilunga, Longo-Bondi, Ntandu Yumbi, Tchissanga, Ntupu, Lendji, Bueti, Hinda, [[Makola]], Bambala, Nanga, Tchivula, Nkumbi, Tangu Mbata, [[Diosso]], Mabindu, Lubu, Mpili and Tchissekeni.

Their residential area has been gradually reduced due to the atomization of the Kingdom of Loango, for more than one hundred and fifty years, corresponding roughly to the Treaty of Tchimbamba signed on June 21, 1883, allowing France to take possession of the territory. indeed, the French penetration and the brewing of the induced populations, promote the spread of serious epidemics of [[smallpox]] and [[trypanosomiasis]] (sickness of sleep). The requisition of all men in the force of the age to carry on the back of men, the goods landed at Loango, as well as the use of the test poison to designate the culprits, in particular of suspicious death, will contribute to the decrease of the population of the descendants of the Kingdom of Loango. Drought-induced shortages will push the Vili to move to the [[Mayombe]] or to emigrate. They have since kept this soul of travelers.

The construction of the [[Congo–Ocean Railway|Congo-Océan railway]] will decimate the local populations via [[Streptococcus pneumoniae|pneumococcal]] and [[dysentery]], so that [[Sara people|Sara]] brought back from [[Chad]] and [[Banda people|Banda]] from the [[Ubangi-Shari]] will be able to complete this voracious project in human lives.

Between 1925 and 1949, the birth and rise of Pointe-Noire will depopulate the villages of the Hinterland. Schooling and the attraction for the urban lifestyle will accentuate rural loss. From 1962, the number of Vili established in Pointe-Noire exceeds that of those in rural areas. In 1965, the Vili ethnic group was absorbed to almost 60% by the implantation of the city of Pointe-Noire on these lands. More than the others, it has suffered the full brunt of the consequences of urbanization and the distentions of traditional tenure.

In 1957, the anthropologist Maurice Chabeuf estimated at 36 000, the number of Vili nationals and wondered how this people had not yet disappeared despite all these endured scourges.

Nowadays, most of the villages are located along the routes of communication (roads, CFCO).

Outside Pointe-Noire, the economic capital, the population density of the Kouilou is generally very low. From 1.7 hab./km2 to 1984, it rose to 6.8 hab./km2 in 2017. however, there are areas of tension for access to natural resources (hunting and fisheries) and land control, such as the [[Conkouati-Douli National Park|Conkouati]] Lagoon.

Although spared during the civil wars of 1993 and 1997, Pointe-Noire and its hinterland will see a mass flock of migrants from the [[Pool Department|Pool department]] and the countries of the [[Niari Valley|Niari]]. The unsuitable infrastructure still does not allow to this day to absorb this overflow of population. which accentuates land pressure.

=== Territory ===

==== Si / Tsi ====
[[File:Rain forest close to Diosso - Pointe-Noire (Republic of Congo).jpg|thumb|Rain forest close to [[Diosso]]- Pointe-Noire (Republic of Congo)]]
Si in Vili language or Tsi in Yombe language refers to inclusive land and its resources, the territory, the country. Members of the matriclan (''likanda'') have in community land, goods and interests visible and invisible. Clan territory (''Si likanda'') limits are set by the geniuses, force spirits of the ancestors of the clan (''nkisi'' in singular and ''bakisi'' if plural) and not by men. These limits may be rivers, hills, edges of forests...

The ministering spirits prefer quiet places and migrate to more peaceful places, when they are disturbed, thus causing the migration of the clan. The places of residence of the geniuses (''tchibila'') or sanctuaries are sources, rivers, mountains (Mount Bamba in the Mayombe), circuses (Diosso Gorge), the gorges of Sunda, isolated trees or groves.

==== Control of land ====

===== The State =====
[[File:Eucalyptus Plantations in Diosso area close to Pointe-Noire (Republic of Congo).jpg|thumb|Eucalyptus Plantations in [[Diosso]] area close to Pointe-Noire (Republic of Congo)]]
The State grants operating permits to the oil companies (Total, ENI)... and other industrial companies like EFC (Eucalyptus fiber Congo) formerly UAIC (Unit of industrial afforestation of the Congo). Thus, concessions were granted to plant 10,000 ha of eucalyptus around Pointe-Noire, Hinda, Loango Bay and North Bas-Kouilou .

The State also guarantees every Congolese citizen the possibility to settle anywhere. The motto of the [[Congolese Party of Labour|Congolese Party of Labor]]  (PCT), the former single party "''everything for the people and for the people''" served to bail from populations of other regions to settle in the Kouilou. However, authoritarianism and the predominance of the populations of the North to power was favored them in this land game at the expense of the people of the South (Vili and Yombe in mind).

===== Aboriginal people =====
With the sovereign national conference of 1991, the restoration of the kingdoms of Loango and [[Anziku Kingdom|Anziku]] (Teke) was followed by a claim of the restoration of the "ancestral custom". The holding of this line was none other than François-Xavier Tchitembo, better known under his title of ''Ma Mboma Si Loango'' (Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Loango), Mayor of Bwali (Diosso) even ''Chief Tchitembo''. This last undertook a restoration of the lineal power campaign, including the meeting of July 6, 1994 at Matombi (fishing village). He said that the return to the clan land tenure is a way to regulate the scarcity of game, the decline in the fishery and agricultural resources.

In order to weigh against the State developer and industrial operators, some people that are part of the regional elite are organized around the regional Association of the earthlings of the Kouilou (ARTK) established in 1992. This institution has allowed clans owners of the land on which the UAIC (plant of industrial afforestation of the Congo) had planted eucalyptus trees, to conduct illicit cut of wood, to get their land back and highlight. Indeed, without consultation with the heads of land, nor farmers who worked there, the administrative authorities have conceded these lands at the UAIC, considering them as unoccupied, while they were left fallow for 5 or 6 years.

With rampant expansion of the city of Pointe-Noire, the landowners, failing to highlight the territory in a concerted way, just sometimes practice that real estate speculation by selling plots of land to the highest bidder. So on the periphery of the economic capital, the satisfaction of immediate and individual needs takes precedence over the preservation of the heritage of the future and the collective interest.

===== Migrants =====
The natural resources of the Congolese coastal plain and the outlet is Pointe-Noire, the economic capital, attract immigrants from the four corners of Congolese territory, including the inhabitants of other areas of the Kouloiu.

Thus, in the absence of a job employee at Pointe-Noire, migrants engaged in the areas of fishing, agriculture or hunting. Thus, since the sixties, Teke from [[Ewo]] and [[Okoyo District|Okoyo district]] in the Congolese basin (the basin of the [[Alima]]), settled in the marshes of the Ntombo and on the shores of lakes and lagoons crossed by the Loeme river to process fishing.

Moreover, the Teke and the Mbamba (Group [[Kota people (Gabon)|Kota]]) from the Massif of the North, in the [[Lékoumou Department]], engaged in hunting in the Massif of the Mayombe where they settled and in the park of Conkouati-Douli. Finally, around and near the pontenegrine settlement, some people from Pool department practice agricultural activities in rural areas.

In the Kouilou region, who do not have the attributes of sovereignty in the village where he was welcomed, is simply a resident and is called in vili language ''Nthundji''.

==== Habitat ====
One can be surprised that a civilization as rich as vili culture cannot leave monuments or ruins, testimony of the events of the distant past. This is to forget that in Loango country, you do not build homes or other sustainable buildings using materials. The traditional cabins were made in panels of [[Cyperus papyrus|Papyrus]] or [[Aframomum]].

[[File:Congo Français - Famille noire à Loango.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Typical rural and traditional cabin, circa 1910]]
[[File:Un village congolais des environs de Loango.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Congolese village around Loango, circa 1910]]

===== The villages =====
The typology of the villages is indicative of traditional rural life in its historical, socio-cultural and environmental development.

General speaking, the villages are linear and so-called "villages-routes", because of their location along the roads. Habitat within the village is more often split or subdivided in the middle of savannah. However, the habitat becomes more consolidated near sites of the rivers, forests and roads.

At the end of the nineteenth century, [[R. E. Dennett|Richard Edward Dennett]], an English merchant who lived and traded in Vili country note "Fiote, once they have buried a parent, either destroy completely the house of the deceased, or dismantle it to sell the materials to another family ". " The cassava plants or other fruit trees like orange, lemon and mango are planted instead to avoid anyone to settle there. However, things have changed today. Indeed, the death of a loved one always causes abandonment of the home plot. However, it is only rarely destroyed. This allows the family of the deceased to continue to operate, at least temporarily, the food-producting cultures and fruits that are still there, however without to maintain them.

According to beliefs, anyone building a hut with long life materials, is irremediably condemned (death, misfortune, bad spells, fires, diseases...). These beliefs and the fetish so accentuate the fragmentation of the Vili rural landscape, the plots inhabited being continually on the move.

The dispersion and the movement of Vili rural habitat tell us about the individualistic or independent behaviour of Vili people.

The tremendous mango trees and groves across the savannas are the witnesses of this permanent transhumance of villages. Their size (height) give an indication of the age of the village.

This traditional custom may explain why the Vili are so badly housed, fearing by supertition, to be accused of witchcraft in compensation for the construction of a lavish home. This also explains the propensity of the Vili, unlike their neighbors, Yombe, to not be attached to their land.

In addition to the housing cabins (shelters for the night) and the kitchen huts (places of women), the "Moandza" or palaver hut, is the privileged place of meetings, exchanges, rest and craft activities of the masculine.  Indeed, this place in which men spend most of their time, is an excellent observation post thanks to its close positioning to the road.

At the same time, the modest home of Moe Poaty III (crowned Maloango March 18, 1931 until his death on May 3, 1975), built in 1952 by the colonial administration and which he used as his residential Palace, was abandoned for six years. Indeed, none of these successors wanted to settle there.

Under pressure from the Government, the Royal residence then turned museum that opened, on April 10, 1982, [[Jean-Baptiste Tati Loutard]], Minister of High education and, Minister of culture and arts.

In Pointe-Noire, the second area said illegal out of the ground in the 1950s after the ward "4 Km" is called also "Quartier planches" ("Plank ward"). The Catholic Church of St. Christopher of Mvoumvou, nearby was originally entirely built in white wooden planks. Which sometimes causes the laughingstock of newcomers on Pointe-Noire to the Vili, because they are not aware of this aspect of their culture.

{{main|List of mayors of Pointe-Noire (Republic of the Congo)}}
The town of Pointe-Noire or the Department of Kouilou, the Vili people's settlements still does not have a university, nor other public educational institutions such as high schools, colleges and elementary school. Only private initiatives such as the creation of structures such as ''École supérieure de technologie du littoral (EST-L)'', ''École supérieure de commerce et de gestion'', and ''Université de Loango-Institut supérieur de technologie (UL–IUT)'', mitigate somewhat this situation.

The Pointe-Noire Grand Market area, the district Number 1 Lumumba and the district Number 2 Mvoumvou, once predominantly inhabited by Vili nationals, have become a preempted sector by Muslim populations, who have come from [[West Africa]], increasingly pushing the Vili to the peripheral districts of the district number 4 [[Loandjili district|Loandjili]] or 5 Mongo-Poukou. Indeed, impoverishment pushes families to sell their properties in order to survive.
[[File:Antoinette Sassou-Nguesso.jpg|thumb|right|240px|First Lady Antoinette Sassou-Nguesso of the Republic of the Congo, 2011]]
So far there has been tacit approval between the central government and [[Pointe-Noire]] and the [[Kouilou Department|Department of Kouilou]]: Most of the mayors of the coastal city have since independence been most often nationals of this region. For example, Stéphane Tchitchéllé, Dr. Jacques Bouiti, Marcel Tchionvo, [[Jean-Pierre Thystère Tchicaya|Jean-Pierre Thysthère Tchicaya]], François-Luc Makosso, [[Roland Bouiti-Viaudo]] and the current director-Mayor Jean-François Kando (elected since 28 August 2017), are noted. 
The fact that the first Lady Antoinette Sassou-Nguesso born Tchibota originates from Pointe-Noire, militates for this status quo. But how long will this agreement last, which the Vili consider their prerogative as descendants of this fief? Indeed, the economic lung of the Congo, as the gateway to and exiting the flow of goods, arouses increasingly heightened lust.

In September 1988, the site of Diosso gorges or the "Little Colorado" of Congo as presented by the tourist guides, one of the most beautiful natural sites to visit the country, was planned to receive toxic waste from Europe. The first shipment from Rotterdam, of the million tonnes of contract valued at US $74 million, fortunately never left the Dutch port.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/25/world/african-nations-barring-foreign-toxic-waste.html|title=African Nations Barring Foreign Toxic Waste|last=Brooke|first=James|date=1988-09-25|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-17|last2=Times|first2=Special to the New York|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/92a7d7eaf0714a260170fa72fdb978ad/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=1820943|title=The Deadly Trade: Toxic Waste Dumping in Africa - ProQuest|last=Schissel|first=Howard|date=1988-09-01|website=search.proquest.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This scandal revealed by the "Green Zorros of Ecology", and relayed by [[Radio France Internationale]] broke out publicly four months ago and involves the businessman Luciano Spada and several personalities at the top of the state of the time: Gilbert Bembet, Minister of Information, [[Ange Édouard Poungui|Ange Edouard Poungui]], Prime Minister, [[Alphonse Poaty-Souchlaty]], Minister of Trade and SMEs, Christophe Mbouramoué, Minister of Scientific Research and environment. are also involved in this montage between Bauwerk A. G, a [[Liechtenstein]] company, and the Congolese State of civil society personalities such as Vincent Gomez, business lawyer, Jean Passi, adviser to the Prime Minister, and Dieudonné Nganga, Ngamissamy Issanga, Abel Tschicou, administrative authorities.

The scandal aroused incessant rumors and terror among the people of the Kouilou where the waste had to be stored. To calm the situation, the Government committed itself to establishing the responsibilities. The two ministers instigating this fraudulent contract, Christian Gilbert Bembet and Christophe Mbouramoué were dismissed, although having already pocketed the bribes even before the execution of the contract. In addition, lawyer Vincent Gomez was disbarred from the Lawyers bar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://dmcarc.com/1988-le-scandale-des-dechets-toxiques/|title=1988 – Le scandale des déchets toxiques|work=DMCARC|access-date=2017-10-17|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, after feasibility studies in [[Singapore]], the [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]] and [[China]] have endorsed the construction of a special Economic Zone (SEZ) in the Pointe-Noire region, and more specifically to Loango; This is part of the $60 billion financing plan, granted by [[Beijing]] to support the industrialization of African countries. If at first it is excellent news for the Congo to have been chosen as a "pilot" country, particularly in terms of potential jobs, what will it be for the Kouilou and its nationals? Already expropriation operations began in order to build the future deep-water port in the region of Loango.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://adiac-congo.com/content/pointe-noire-la-realisation-de-la-zone-economique-speciale-se-concretise-60530|title=Pointe-Noire : la réalisation de la Zone économique spéciale se concrétise  {{!}} adiac-congo.com : toute l'actualité du Bassin du Congo|last=|first=|date=|website=adiac-congo.com|language=fr|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of China also adversely affects the natural environment through its industrial fisheries off the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic coast]]. Indeed, these trawlers destroy the nets of artisan Vili fishermen, residing in the villages located between the district of Tchiamba-Nzassi and the Gabonese border. These fishermen are forced to abandon their activity in order to fall back on the rural work. As a result, migratory flows to the interior of the land entailing pressure on the forest areas (agricultural activities, wood cutting for coal ...).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Etude de la spatialisation et de la pondération des causes de déforestation et de dégradation forestière.|last=Ministère de l'Economie forestière et du développement durable|first=République du Congo|publisher=BRL Ingenierie - C4 EcoSolutions|year=2014|isbn=|location=|page=|pages=162|language=Fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The immense industrial plantations of eucalyptus (originally intended to supply a hypothetical [[pulp mill]]) produce wood for export.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/ARTICLE/WFC/XII/0172-B1.HTM|title=Eucalyptus du Congo s.a. : Plantation Industrielle et Développement Durable.|last=|first=|date=|website=www.fao.org|language=Fr|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This indigenous species of the Australian continent hinders the diversification of the undergrowth of the Kouilou region, whose soil is already sandy and poor. It follows a decrease in land reserved for agricultural activities. Active or disadvantaged local populations are forced to abandon artisanal activities and to look for salaried jobs in mining companies. The production of charcoal for cooking, agriculture, hunting and gathering to feed these populations that are urbanizing and whose relationship with their original natural environment fades, are not made to reassure the future of the biodiversity of the region.

==== Oil: The curse of the Vili people ====
The eruption of the [[Kingdom of Loango]] at the end of the nineteenth century fragmented the oil regions between the [[Cabinda Province|Cabinda]] enclave in [[Angola]], [[Gabon]], [[Republic of the Congo|Congo-Brazzaville]] and [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|D.R. Congo]]. The first oil research began in [[Gabon]], in 1928, at the instigation of Governor General Raphaël Antonetti. In 1931, the oil exploration Mission of AEF (MPPAEF) was created, of which Jacques-Olivier Haas took the direction in 1932. The MPPAEF is replaced in 1934 by the Union of Petroleum Studies and Research (SERP), which becomes, in 1949, the oil Company of AEF (SPAEF), which will eventually merge into the [[Total S.A.|ELF]] group. The ELF company whose prospections began in the 1960 years, discovers the first offshore oil deposits off Pointe-Noire.

Dr. Jean-Baptiste Tchicaya, a geologist, is one of several of these expeditions. It is at its initiative that almost all oil fields, barges or drilling rigs still in operation or not off Pointe-Noire, bear the names Vili. These are names reminiscent of fish or seafood from the Atlantic Ocean of the Tropics:
* ''Foukanda''
* ''Kitina''
* ''Kombi:'' Red Captain fish
* ''Kouakouala''
* ''Kundji''
* ''Mengo''
* ''Moho Bilondo'': littéraly "The belly filled up with Bilondo" (local sea fish)
* ''Nkossa'': [[Shrimp]]
* ''Lianzi''
* ''Likala''
* ''Likouala'': (''Singular likwal''' or ''mukwal'' ou ''musundi'' for plural). It's the [[herring]]
* ''Litchendili''
* ''Likouf'': [[Butterfish]]
* ''Mboundi''
* ''Mwafi'': Sea Carp
* ''Sendji'': [[Sardine]]
* ''Tchendo:'' African [[Bagridae|Bagrid]]
* ''Tchibeli Litanzi''
* ''Tchibouela'' ou ''tchipakoulou pangou'': [[Stingray]]
* ''Yanga''
* ''Zatchi''

As soon as it was created in 1967, the French company Elf, which became [[Total S.A.|Total]] thereafter, is immediately above the law and depends on the right line of the [[Élysée Palace|''Élysée'' Palace]]. To compensate for the loss of [[Algeria]], which provided before its independence a quarter of its energy needs, France [[Gaullism|Gaullist]] considers as vital and strategic to explore and exploit oil fields in [[Sub-Saharan Africa|Sub-Saharian Africa]]. All means are good to achieve this goal.

Former officers of the [[Service de Documentation Extérieure et de Contre-Espionnage|SDECE]] (French Secret Services Agency) will be a cohort of private [[Espionage|secret Service agents]], in order to effectively ensure the safety of oil installations and men. Colossal financial means (occult commissions, corruption, opaque circuits, etc.) are put into play to finance the operating costs of governments, to intervene in the appointment of senior officials or in the distribution of under the counter payment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Médard|first=Jean-François|date=2002-10-30|title=" La politique est au bout du réseau ".

In the western unconscious, Congo remains the quintessential playground for "spooks". After financing the presidential campaign of [[Pascal Lissouba]] in 1992, Elf refuses to advance the funds to pay the most immediate public officials and expenditure. Lissouba then turns to the American oil tanker [[Occidental Petroleum]]. The relations between the President and Elf will then deteriorate, with the civil Wars of 1993 and 1997 as a climax. Elf prefers to deal with President [[Denis Sassou Nguesso]], a political and pragmatic end, first as soon as he ascended to power on February 5, 1979, then at the end of his coup de force in the Civil War of 1997, thus ending the parenthesis six years after the 1991 national conference.

Thus, Elf did not hesitate to finance and arm the two camps in presence in order to safeguard its interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.leparisien.fr/faits-divers/les-operations-africaines-d-elf-sous-l-ere-jaffre-22-04-2003-2004019595.php|title=Les " opérations " africaines d'Elf sous l'ère Jaffré|last=Valdigué|first=Laurent|date=2003-04-22|work=leparisien.fr|access-date=2017-10-07|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pointe-Noire]], the economic capital of the Congo, sees hundreds of thousands of refugees coming from the [[Pool Department|Pool]] area and the [[Niari Valley]]. Successive waves are sometimes anarchy settled by ethnic groups with an obvious risk of igniting on a tribal basis. So far, Pointe-Noire has always been preserved from the political turmoil of which the Congo is the prerogative. Colonel Louis Georges Loembé, Head of Pointe-Noire military zone N°1, and François Auguste Tchichellé Tchivéla, son of Stéphane Tchitchéllé, senior officer and pediatrician, Minister of Tourism and Environment from 1992 to 1995, under Pascal Lissouba rule, prefect of [[Kouilou Department|Kouilou department]] during the Civil war that broke out in 1997, because they were Military, originating in the region, will ensure that the conflict does not affect the ocean City.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jeuneafrique.com/141614/societe/pointe-noire-fran-ois-tchichell-tchiv-la-l-me-vilie-de-la-ville/|title=Pointe-Noire : François Tchichellé Tchivéla, l’âme vilie de la ville – JeuneAfrique.com|date=2012-05-11|work=JeuneAfrique.com|access-date=2017-10-07|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Congo has important oil reserves but remains one of the poorest countries and one of the most indebted countries in the world per capita, despite the cancellation by international institutions of half of its debt, benefiting in 2010 of the HIPC regime ([[heavily indebted poor countries]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.mediapart.fr/jecmaus/blog/080516/congo-brazzaville-un-etat-en-faillite|title=Congo Brazzaville : un Etat en faillite|last=Jecmaus|first=Edo Nganga|date=2016-05-08|work=Club de Mediapart|access-date=2017-10-07|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the oil windfall extracted from Pointe-Noire does not benefit this one. The infrastructure does not follow the rapid evolution of the population of the coastal city. Investment work (access to drinking water, energy, sanitation, management of industrial and domestic waste ...) and maintenance (collection and treatment of waste, pollution, noise and visual nuisances, non-existent ...) are made sparingly. The few subsidies allocated disappear into the meanders of the obscure networks.

===== The oil sands operation =====
Since the years 1970, the beginning of the oil sands operation in the vicinity of the localities of Mboukou, Tchikanou, Loango first by the oil company SPAEF became later ELF, then by [[Maurel &amp; Prom|Maurel and Prom]], and finally by [[Eni|ENI]] (formerly AGIP research), it could have been expected that the living conditions of the populations improved. It is rather the disillusionment, because no road, nor sanitary and school infrastructure worthy of the name has emerged. These populations whose main activities are fishing, harvesting and agriculture have seen their area of activity polluted by the different boreholes, making their living conditions unbearable. In addition to the decline in agricultural yields ([[cassava]], yams, [[Cooking banana|plantains]]) that allow [[Pointe-Noire]] to be supplied, water points have also been polluted making water unfit for food use. ENI's only solution is to supply water by tanker trucks whose vats are not always curated. Even this distribution is done at the head of the customer by favoring those who have relationships or money.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lejour.info/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1891:departement-du-kouilou-des-paysans-indemnises-selon-un-bareme-de-1986-&amp;catid=2:economie&amp;Itemid=3|title=Département du Kouilou: Des paysans indemnisés selon un barème de… 1986|last=Yacine|website=lejour.info|language=fr-fr|access-date=2017-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to carry out this extraction work, peasants have seen their fields destroyed and compensated by ENI in 2009 with a scale dating from 1986. For example, a field of 10 hectares was compensated at a level of 150 000 CFA francs (or approximately EUR 230), a cassava cutting was offset at 37 CFA francs (0.05 euro), one foot of mango tree at 60 000 CFA francs (about 90 euros).

There are also the torchieres of oil sites like that of M'Boundji that produce greenhouse gases and heavy trucks that by transporting equipment (pipelines) raise dust on their way causing diseases Lung.

It all happens as if you want to kill softly local people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=PERRIN Christian|title=DIOSSO, DANS LE KOUILOU, UNE CITE PETROLIERE ABANDONNEE|date=2015-02-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-4qDFtMaI|accessdate=2017-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pierre Stève Loemba, peasant and spokesperson for the communities of Mboukou explains: After many arguments without results, we have entrusted our problem to human rights associations to help us to conquer our right to "A decent life, a healthy environment and fairness."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stiftung|first=Heinrich Böll|date=November 2009|title=Energy Futures: ENI's investments in tar sands and palm oil in the Congo basin|url=https://www.boell.de/sites/default/files/091109_Energy_Futures_Congo_Oil.pdf|journal=Boel.de,|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brice Makosso, president of the Justice and Peace Commission, believes that "instead of brandishing the decree of 1986, all these companies should instead refer to international standards that are superior to local standards." In Chad or Cameroon, the scales have been revised.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===== Local content =====
The global oil sector has been in crisis and in full mutation since the oil barrel stagnated around US $50 and the demand for black gold is declining sharply.
This affects the Congolese economy, which is largely dependent on its oil exports. All the oil majors operating in the country and all their major sub-contractors reduced the sail by returning their cohort of expatriates to the house. Employees with local status have a less-than-shiny spell. Some were thanked overnight without any compensation. Other majors want to reduce the benefits that have been acquired by nationals; What makes the teeth cringe or even causes strikes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20170715-congo-brazzaville-mouvement-social-total-pointe-noire-negociations|title=Grève au Congo-B: Total annonce la reprise de la production sur ses sites - RFI|last=|first=|date=2017-07-15|work=RFI Afrique|access-date=2017-10-14|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jeuneafrique.com/458235/economie/greves-employes-groupe-total-mauritanie-congo/|title=Total paralysé par des grèves en Mauritanie et au Congo – JeuneAfrique.com|date=2017-07-18|work=JeuneAfrique.com|access-date=2017-10-14|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Paul Boateng]], a British politician, stresses, "a crisis presents both problems and opportunities." The opportunity is to be part of the solution: This industry can create well-paid jobs, benefiting both the shareholders and the companies in which it intervenes. To do this, we need to develop [[local purchasing]] policies and local content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jeuneafrique.com/14277/economie/contenu-local-une-priorit-pour-les-p-troliers/|title=Contenu local : une priorité pour les pétroliers ? – JeuneAfrique.com|date=2013-12-03|work=JeuneAfrique.com|access-date=2017-10-14|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local content or national preference is to "ensure a rebalancing of wealth by inviting States to capitalize on their natural resources".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jeuneafrique.com/18198/economie/pr-f-rence-nationale-au-tour-des-africains/|title=Préférence nationale : au tour des Africains ! – JeuneAfrique.com|date=2013-07-22|work=JeuneAfrique.com|access-date=2017-10-14|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the taxes and income received by the host States, it is an excellent instrument for the use of local industrial fabric and local competences, not only in the extractive economy sector (hydrocarbons, mines, forest industry), But also in the service and construction sector. So it is a direct impact on the national economy.

The tools available to the public authorities are as follows: imposing the use of local employment; Job creation and transfer of skills; Oblige foreign companies to open their shareholdings to national actors; Demand that they be provided locally in goods and services, in order to densify the [[Small and medium-sized enterprises]] network...

At the scale of the village communities that live in the sites operated by these oil majors, they would have to organize themselves into structures capable of serving as interlocutors with the public authorities and the oil companies, for example Train young people to work on these sites or offshore areas, design and implement sustainable development projects to preserve the natural environment and produce (agriculture, fish farming, livestock farming ...) to supply the large [[Pointe-Noire]] agglomeration.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Féviliyé|first=Ines|date=2016-12-06|title=Le contenu local au Congo et l’expérience de l’Equateur|url=|journal=CNUCED - UNCTAD|language=Fr|location=N'Djaména, Chad|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nigeria|Niigeria]] inspired by the [[Norway|Norwegian]] and [[Brazil]]ian models is the sub-saharan country to have pushed the concept of local content further through the promulgation of the Nigerian content Act in April 2010. This concept is relatively new in Congo with the publication of the new hydrocarbons code in October 2016. As long as it benefits a little to the local communities. One can be doubtfully, since these laws on the local content, have never been followed by a support system so that national staff or national enterprises can confront themselves with their foreign competitors with equal arms.

But as Ines Féviliyé&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; says, the crisis is the opportunity to implement the rules of local content, in information, awareness, dialogue. Indeed, all stakeholders are gaining, by reducing costs for private companies, new markets for local suppliers, transferring technology to develop the domestic industry, jobs, reducing unemployment and of poverty.

The task is certainly not easy, but it is no longer a question of shirking it, given the current situation.

== Societal Structure ==
[[File:CPA-CONGO-FRANCAIS-LE-TAILLEUR-CHICAIA-ET-SA-FAMILLE.jpg|right|thumb|French Congo - Tailor Tchicaya and his family - circa 1900]]

The Vili traditional society as well as all the ethnic groups of the Kongo group, is characterized by a main structure called '''''Likanda'''''. This is the clan whose members possess in community and in common the goods and interests visible and invisible. Within this matrilineal society, the territory of the clan ('''''si likanda''''') as well as its limits are managed by the elder of the maternal uncles ('''''ma Nkashi''''' or '''''Fumu si'''''). The word '''SI''' in expressions '''''si likanda''''' or '''''Fumu si''''' designates both the land on which the clan is established, but also all the resources therein.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Compétition pour les ressources au Kouilou (Congo) - Du bon usage des ressources renouvelables|last=Katz|first=Esther|last2=Nguiguiri|first2=Jean-Claude|publisher=ORSTOM|year=2000|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=191–192|language=Fr|issn=1278-348X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms and phrases used to distinguish kinship links are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Proverbes et dictons du Loango en Afrique centrale: langue, culture et société|last=Mavoungou Pambou|first=René|publisher=Bajag-Meri|year=2000|isbn=2-911147-08-1|editor-link=https://livre.fnac.com/a1151810/Rene-Mavoungou-Pambou-Proverbes-et-dictons-du-Loango-en-Afrique|volume=II|location=Jouy-le-Moutier|pages=196|language=Fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The maternal clan is called '''''Tchifumba''''', while the paternal clan is called '''''Tchisya'''''.
* Maternal and paternal grandparents are the '''''Nkaaka''''' and grandchildren of the latter are the '''''Ntekulu'''''. Conversely, these call their grandparents by '''''Yaaya'''''.
* The great grandsons are '''''sidandu si Butekulu''''' (literally child following the grandson).
* The nuclear family that can be compared to the Western family is called '''''Liziku''''', a term literally meaning hearth. This nucleus is composed of '''''bibusi''''' (parent progenitors); Namely '''''Lisya''''' (the Father) and '''''Nguli''''' (the mother), not forgetting '''''baana''''' (children or '''''mwaana''''' in the singular). They are addressed to their parents by calling them respectively by '''''Taata''''' (Daddy) and '''''Maama''''' (Mummy).
* Within the '''''Liziku''''', the boy is called '''''Mwaana''''' '''''libakala''''' (literally child man), while the girl is '''''Mwaana ntchetu''''' (literally child woman).
* In order to apply the birthright within the '''''Liziku''''', the eldest of the children is called '''''Tchibutu''''', while the elder is called '''''Nkoomba'''''.
* The children call their maternal uncle (the brother of their mother) '''''Ma Nkashi''''' and the wife of their uncle by '''''Cinkaaka'''''. However, they call their maternal aunt '''''Nguli''''' or '''''Maama''''', term also used to call their mother.
* The nephews are called '''''Bana bu nkashi''''' (literally child of the uncle). The child is placed under the authority of his maternal uncle; which has the right of life or death over its fate. The children of his uncle are called '''''Baana Ba Kwelissi''''' (literally child of the Allied clan or child by covenant) and belong to the clan of the wife of the uncle.
* The paternal uncle ranked  '''''Lisya''''' is called '''''Taata''''' in the same way as the parent father. The paternal aunt is called '''''Taata''''' '''''Ntchietu''''' (literally a woman's father). The husband of the latter was called '''''Nkashi''''' (the uncle).

== Surnames ==
When an elder meets a younger stranger, after the greetings, the first asks the second on the name of his clan, then on that of his parents, saying:  "''Ndjé mwan ' na?'' " (literally  "From whom are you the child? " which can be translated as  " What are your origins?  "). It's a way to know a little more about who we're dealing with. The youngest describes then more or less succinctly his family tree.

Traditionally and prior to western penetration, members of '''''Liziku''''', the nuclear family, did not have the same name. For instance, a child could bear the name of a grandparent ('''''N'Luku''''') or another family member. This becomes the godfather or godmother ('''''N'dusi''''')&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Parlons vili : Langue et culture Loango|last=Loembe|first=Gervais|publisher=L'Harmattan|year=2005|isbn=2-7475-8180-2|location=Paris|pages=141–147|language=Fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the child. One can also give the surname of a grandparent leaning on the father's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Coutumes traditions et proverbes vilis|last=Tchiamas|first=Joseph|publisher=Books on Demand|year=2015|isbn=9782322015245|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name is said '''''Li Zina''''' ('''''Me zina''''' in the plural), while the first name or pseudonym is said to be '''''Nkumbu''''' ('''''Si Nkumbu''''' in plural).

=== Nobility ===
Members of the royal or princely clans are easily identifiable by the presence of the '''''Mwé''''' or '''''Moé''''' honorary particle in front of the surname. This title of nobility can be translated by Lord or my lord.

The Ma Loango (king), his brothers and sisters are ''Moé''. His nephews and nieces ('''''Bana bu nkashi''''') from her uterine sisters are also.

On the contrary, the King's Wife ('''''Kame Fumu''''' or by contraction '''''Ka fu''''') is not ''Moé''. Ditto for the Children of the King ('''''Bane Fumu''''', '''''Mwane fumu''''' in the singular or by contraction '''''Mwa fu''''').

Can claim or accede to the throne only the holders of the title of Moé, because of the matrilineal succession (power derived from the royal Blood).

'''William Clark Styron Jr.''' (June 11, 1925 – November 1, 2006) was an American [[novelist]] and [[essayist]] who won major literary awards for his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/02/books/02styron.html| title=William Styron, Novelist, Dies at 81| work=The New York Times| author= Christopher Lehmann-Haupt| date= November 2, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Styron was best known for his novels, including:
* ''[[Lie Down in Darkness (novel)|Lie Down in Darkness]]'' (1951), his acclaimed first work, published when he was 26;
* ''[[The Confessions of Nat Turner (1967)|The Confessions of Nat Turner]]'' (1967), narrated by [[Nat Turner]], the leader of an 1831 [[Virginia]]n [[slavery|slave]] revolt;
* ''[[Sophie's Choice (novel)|Sophie's Choice]]'' (1979), a story "told through the eyes of a young aspiring writer from the South, about a Polish Catholic survivor of [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] and her brilliant but psychotic Jewish lover in postwar [[Brooklyn]]".&lt;ref name="NYT-Maw"/&gt;

In 1985, he suffered from his first serious bout with [[depression (mood)|depression]]. Once he recovered from his illness, Styron was able to write the memoir ''[[Darkness Visible (memoir)|Darkness Visible]]''&amp;nbsp;(1990), the work he became best known for during the last two decades of his life.

==Early years==
Styron was born in the [[Hilton Village]] historic district&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/VA-news/VA-Pilot/issues/1997/vp971102/11020135.htm The Return of a Village Histon'S Boosters See Potential In Its Quaint Wwi Structures]&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Newport News, Virginia]], the son of Pauline Margaret (Abraham) and William Clark Styron.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/02/books/02styron.html&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in the South and was steeped in its history. His birthplace was less than a hundred miles from the site of [[Nat Turner|Nat Turner’s]] [[Nat Turner's slave rebellion|slave rebellion]], later the source for Styron's most famous and controversial novel.

Styron's [[Northern United States|Northern]] mother and [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[Southern United States|Southern]] father gave him a broad perspective on race relations. Styron’s childhood was a difficult one. His father, a shipyard engineer, suffered from [[clinical depression]], which Styron himself would later experience. His mother died from [[breast cancer]] in 1939 when Styron was still a boy, following her decade-long battle with the disease.

Styron attended public school in Warwick County, first at [[Hilton Elementary School (Newport News, Virginia)|Hilton School]] and then at Morrison High School (now known as [[Warwick High School (Newport News)|Warwick High School]]) for two years, until his father sent him to [[Christchurch School]], an [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal]] [[college-preparatory school]] in the [[Tidewater region of Virginia]]. Styron once said, "But of all the schools I attended...only Christchurch ever commanded something more than mere respect—which is to say, my true and abiding affection."&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.dailypress.com/1990-07-01/news/9006280277_1_classmate-teachers-principal&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon graduation, Styron enrolled in [[Davidson College]]&lt;ref name="Eric Homberger"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/nov/03/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries|title=Obituary: William Styron|author=Eric Homberger|work=the Guardian|accessdate=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and joined [[Phi Delta Theta]]. By the age of eighteen he was reading the writers who would have a lasting influence on his vocation as a novelist and writer, especially [[Thomas Wolfe]].&lt;ref name="Eric Homberger"/&gt; Styron transferred to [[Duke University]] in 1943 as a part of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps V-12 program aimed at fast-tracking officer candidates by enrolling them simultaneously in basic training and bachelor's degree programs. There he published his first fiction, a short story heavily influenced by [[William Faulkner]], in an anthology of student work {{citation needed|date=October 2012}}. Styron published several short stories in the University literary magazine, ''The Archive'', between 1944 and 1946.&lt;ref name=StyronPapers /&gt; Though Styron was made a [[lieutenant]] in the [[U.S. Marine Corps]], the Japanese surrendered before his ship left [[San Francisco]]. After the war, he returned to full-time studies at Duke and completed his Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in [[English studies|English]] in 1947.&lt;ref name=StyronPapers&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.duke.edu/rubenstein/findingaids/styronwilliam/ |title=William Styron Papers, 1855-2007 and undated |publisher=Rubenstein Library, Duke University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After graduation, Styron took an editing position with [[McGraw-Hill]] in [[New York City]]. Styron later recalled the misery of this work in an autobiographical passage of  ''Sophie’s Choice''. After provoking his employers into firing him, he set about writing his first novel in earnest. Three years later, he published the novel, ''[[Lie Down in Darkness (novel)|Lie Down in Darkness]]''&amp;nbsp;(1951), the story of a dysfunctional Virginia family.  The novel received overwhelming critical acclaim.  For this novel, Styron received the prestigious [[Rome Prize]], awarded by the [[American Academy in Rome]] and the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]].

===Military service===
His recall into the military due to the [[Korean War]] prevented him from immediately accepting the Rome Prize. Styron joined the Marine Corps, but was discharged in 1952 for eye problems. However, he was to transform his experience at [[Camp Lejeune]], North Carolina into his short novel, ''[[The Long March (novel)|The Long March]]'', published serially the following year. This was adapted for the [[Playhouse&amp;nbsp;90]] episode ''The Long March'' in 1958.

===Travels in Europe===
Styron spent an extended period in Europe. In [[Paris]], he became friends with writers [[Romain Gary]], [[George Plimpton]], [[Peter Matthiessen]], [[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]], [[James Jones (author)|James Jones]] and [[Irwin Shaw]], among others. In 1953, the group founded the magazine ''[[Paris Review]]'', which became a celebrated literary journal.&lt;ref name="Eric Homberger"/&gt;

The year 1953 was eventful for Styron in another way. Finally able to take advantage of his Rome Prize, he traveled to Italy, where he became friends with [[Truman Capote]]. At the American Academy, he renewed an acquaintance with a young [[Baltimore]] poet, Rose Burgunder, to whom he had been introduced the previous fall at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. They were married in Rome in the spring of 1953.

Some of Styron’s experiences during this period inspired his third published book ''[[Set This House on Fire]]''&amp;nbsp;(1960), a novel about intellectual American [[expatriate]]s on the Amalfi coast of Italy. The novel received mixed reviews in the United States, although its publisher considered it successful in terms of sales. In Europe its translation into French achieved best-seller status, far outselling the American edition.

==Nat Turner controversy==
Styron's next two novels, published between 1967 and 1979, sparked much controversy. Feeling wounded by his first truly harsh reviews  {{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}, for ''Set This House on Fire'', Styron spent the years after its publication researching and writing his next novel, the fictitious memoirs of the historical [[Nat Turner|Nathaniel "Nat" Turner]], a slave who led a slave rebellion in 1831.

During the 1960s, Styron became an eyewitness to another time of rebellion in the United States, living and writing at the heart of that turbulent decade, a time highlighted by the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture revolution]] with its political struggle, civil unrest, and racial tension. The public response to this social upheaval was furious and intense: battle lines were being drawn. In 1968, Styron signed the "[[Writers and Editors War Tax Protest]]" pledge, a vow refusing to pay taxes as a protest against the Vietnam War.&lt;ref&gt;"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest" January 30, 1968 ''New York Post''&lt;/ref&gt;

In this atmosphere of dissent, many{{who|date=July 2012}} had criticized Styron's friend James Baldwin for his novel ''[[Another Country (novel)|Another Country]]'', published in 1962. Among the criticisms was outrage over a black author choosing a white woman as the [[protagonist]] in a story that tells of her involvement with a black man. Baldwin was Styron's house guest for several months following the critical storm generated by ''Another Country''. During that time, he read early drafts of Styron's new novel, and predicted that Styron's book would face even harsher scrutiny than ''Another Country''. "Bill's going to catch it from both sides," he told an interviewer immediately following the 1967 publication of ''The Confessions of Nat Turner''.

Baldwin's prediction was correct, and despite public defenses of Styron by leading artists of the time, including Baldwin and [[Ralph Ellison]], numerous other black critics reviled Styron's portrayal of Turner as racist stereotyping. The historian and critic [[John Henrik Clarke]] edited and contributed to a polemical anthology, ''William Styron's Nat Turner: Ten Black Writers Respond'', published in 1968 by Beacon Press. Particularly controversial was a passage in which Turner fantasizes about [[rape|raping]] a white woman. Styron also writes of a situation where Turner and another slave boy have a homosexual encounter while alone in the woods. Several critics pointed to this as a dangerous perpetuation of a traditional Southern justification for [[lynching]]. Despite the controversy, the novel was a runaway critical and financial success, and won both the 1968 [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Confessions-Nat-Turner-Vintage-Classic/dp/0099285568 ''Confessions of Nat Turner''], Amazon.com&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[William Dean Howells Medal]] in 1970.

==''Sophie's Choice''==
Styron's next novel, ''[[Sophie's Choice (novel)|Sophie's Choice]]'' (1979),
also generated significant controversy, in part due to Styron's decision to portray a non-[[Jew]]ish victim of the [[Holocaust]] and in part due to its explicit sexuality and profanity. It was banned in South Africa, censored in the Soviet Union, and banned in Poland for "its unflinching portrait of Polish anti-Semitism"&lt;ref&gt;Sirlin, Rhoda and West III, James L. W.  ''Sophie's Choice: A Contemporary Casebook''. Newcastle UK: Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2007. p. ix. http://www.cambridgescholars.com/download/sample/60485. Accessed January 5, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been banned in some high schools in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Helfand, Duke. [http://articles.latimes.com/2001/dec/22/local/me-17211 "Students Fight for 'Sophie's Choice"] Los Angeles Times. December 22, 2001. Accessed January 5, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The novel tells the story of Sophie (a Polish [[Roman Catholic]] who survived [[Auschwitz]]), Nathan (her brilliant Jewish lover who suffered from paranoid schizophrenia), and Stingo (a Southern transplant in post-World War&amp;nbsp;II-[[Brooklyn]] who was in love with Sophie). It won the 1980 [[National Book Award]]&lt;ref name=nba1980&gt;[https://www.nationalbook.org/awards-prizes/national-book-awards-1980 "National Book Awards – 1980"]. National Book Foundation. Retrieved 2012-03-15. &lt;br/&gt;(With essay by Robert Weil from the Awards 60-year anniversary blog.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=lower-alpha name=paperback&gt;This was the 1980 [[National Book Award for Fiction#1980 to 1989|award for hardcover general Fiction]]. &lt;br/&gt;From 1980 to 1983 in [[National Book Awards#History|National Book Awards history]] there were dual hardcover and paperback awards in most categories, and [[List of winners of the National Book Award#Miscellaneous 1980 to 1985|multiple fiction categories, especially in 1980]]. Most of the paperback award-winners were reprints, including the 1980 general Fiction.&lt;/ref&gt;
and was a nationwide bestseller.  A 1982 [[Sophie's Choice (film)|film version]] was nominated for five [[Academy Awards]], with [[Meryl Streep]] winning the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for her portrayal of Sophie. [[Kevin Kline]] and [[Peter MacNicol]] played Nathan and Stingo, respectively.

==''Darkness Visible''==
Styron's readership expanded with the publication of [[Darkness Visible (memoir)|''Darkness Visible'']] in 1990. This memoir, which began as a magazine article, chronicles the author's descent into [[major depression|depression]] and his near-fatal night of "despair beyond despair".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/03/books/03styr.html?_r=2&amp;oref=slogin| title=Styron Visible: Naming the Evils That Humans Do| work=The New York Times| author=Michiko Kakutani| date= November 3, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a first-hand account of a major depressive episode and challenged the modern taboo on acknowledging such issues. The memoir's goals included increasing knowledge and decreasing stigmatization of major depressive disorders and suicide. It explored the [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenology]] of the disease among sufferers, their loved ones, and the general public as well. Earlier, in December 1989, Styron had written an op-ed for ''[[The New York Times]]'' responding to the disappointment and mystification among scholars about the apparent suicide of [[Primo Levi]], the remarkable Italian writer who survived the [[Nazi death camps]], but apparently fell victim to depression in his final years. Reportedly, it was the public's unsympathetic response to Levi's death that impelled Styron to take a more active role as an advocate for educating the public about the nature of depression, about which he was a dilettante,  and the role it allegedly played in mental health and suicide.&lt;ref name="Eric Homberger"/&gt; Styron noted in an article for ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' that "the pain of severe depression is quite unimaginable to those who have not suffered it, and it kills in many instances because its anguish can no longer be borne. The prevention of many suicides will continue to be hindered until there is a general awareness of the nature of this pain. Through the healing process of time—and through medical intervention or hospitalization in many cases—most people survive depression, which may be its only blessing; but to the tragic legion who are compelled to destroy themselves there should be no more reproof attached than to the victims of terminal cancer."&lt;ref name="Vanity Fair Darkness visible"&gt;{{cite news|last=Styron|first=William|title=Darkness Visible|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/archive/1989/12/styron198912|accessdate=April 11, 2013|newspaper=Vanity Fair|date=December 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later work and acclaim==
Styron was awarded the [[St. Louis Literary Award]] from the [[Saint Louis University]] Library Associates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slu.edu/libraries/associates/award.html Website of St. Louis Literary Award]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lib.slu.edu/about/associates/literary-award |title=Recipients of the Saint Louis Literary Award |work= |author=Saint Louis University Library Associates |date= |accessdate=July 25, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160731082313/http://lib.slu.edu/about/associates/literary-award |archive-date=July 31, 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Styron was awarded the [[Prix mondial Cino Del Duca]] in 1985.

His short story "Shadrach" was filmed in 1998, under the [[Shadrach (film)|same title]]. It was co-directed by his daughter Susanna Styron.

Other works published during his lifetime include the play ''In the Clap Shack''&amp;nbsp;(1973), and a collection of his nonfiction, ''This Quiet Dust''&amp;nbsp;(1982).

French President [[François Mitterrand]] invited Styron to his first Presidential inauguration, and later made him a Commander of the [[Legion of Honor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shophiltonvillage.com/WilliamStyron.htm|title=William Styron, Pulitzer Prize-Winning Author|last1=|first1=|date=|work=|publisher=ShopHiltonVillage.com|accessdate=December 20, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150602015138/http://www.shophiltonvillage.com/WilliamStyron.htm|archive-date=June 2, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, Styron was awarded the [[National Medal of Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nea.gov/honors/medals/medalists_year.html#93 |title=Lifetime Honors - National Medal of Arts |publisher=Nea.gov |date= |accessdate=June 18, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721054307/http://www.nea.gov/honors/medals/medalists_year.html#93 |archivedate=July 21, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 an opera by [[Nicholas Maw]] based on ''Sophie's Choice'' premièred at the [[Royal Opera House]] in [[Covent Garden]], [[London]]. Maw wrote the [[libretto]] and composed the music. He had approached Styron about writing the libretto, but Styron declined. Later the opera received a new production by stage director Markus Bothe at the [[Deutsche Oper Berlin]] and the [[Volksoper Wien]], and had its North American premiere at the [[Washington National Opera]] in October 2006.&lt;ref name="NYT-Maw"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/20/arts/music/20maw.htm?_r=1|title=Nicholas Maw, British Composer, Is Dead at 73 |work=[[The New York Times]]|first=Allan |last=Kozinn | authorlink=Allan Kozinn|date=May 19, 2009| accessdate=December 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A collection of Styron's papers and records is housed at the Rubenstein Library, Duke University.&lt;ref name=StyronPapers /&gt;

In 1996 William Styron received the 1st Fitzgerald Award on the centenary of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s birth. The F. Scott Fitzgerald Award for Achievement in American Literature award is given annually in Rockville Maryland, the city where Fitzgerald, his wife, and his daughter are buried, as part of the F. Scott [http://fscottfestival.org/ Fitzgerald Literary Festival].

===Port Warwick street names===
The [[Port Warwick]] neighborhood of Newport News, Virginia, was named after the fictional city in Styron's ''Lie Down in Darkness''. The neighborhood describes itself as a "mixed-use [[new urbanism]] development." The most prominent feature of Port Warwick is William Styron Square along with its two main [[boulevard]]s, Loftis Boulevard and Nat Turner Boulevard, named after characters in Styron's novels. Styron himself was appointed to design a naming system for Port Warwick, deciding to "honor great American writers", resulting in [[Philip Roth]] Street, [[Thomas Wolfe]] Street, [[Flannery O'Connor]] Street, [[Herman Melville]] Avenue and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portwarwick.com/william-styron/ |title=William Styron |publisher=Portwarwick.com |date= |accessdate=January 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Styron died from [[pneumonia]] on November 1, 2006, at age 81 in [[Martha's Vineyard]].

==Personal life==
While doing a fellowship at the [[American Academy in Rome]], Styron renewed a passing acquaintance with young [[Baltimore]] poet Rose Burgunder. They married in Rome in the spring of 1953. Together, they had four children: daughter Susanna Styron is a film director; daughter Paola is an internationally acclaimed modern dancer; daughter [[Alexandra Styron|Alexandra]] is a writer, known for the 2001 novel ''All The Finest Girls'' and 2011 memoir ''Reading My Father: A Memoir''; son Thomas is a professor of [[clinical psychology]] at [[Yale University]].
