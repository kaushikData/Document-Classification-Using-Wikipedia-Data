'''''A Moveable Feast''''' is a [[memoir]] by American author [[Ernest Hemingway]] about his years as a struggling young migrant journalist and writer in [[Paris]] in the 1920s. The book, first published in 1964, describes the author's apprenticeship as a young writer while he was married to his first wife, [[Hadley Richardson]].

The memoir consists of various personal accounts, observations, and stories by Hemingway. He provides specific addresses of apartments, bars, cafes, and hotels — many of which can still be found in Paris today. Among other notable persons, people featured in the book include: [[Sylvia Beach]], [[Hilaire Belloc]], [[Aleister Crowley]], [[John Dos Passos]], [[F. Scott Fitzgerald|F. Scott]] and [[Zelda Fitzgerald]], [[Ford Madox Ford]], [[James Joyce]], [[Wyndham Lewis]], [[Pascin]], [[Ezra Pound]], Evan Shipman, [[Gertrude Stein]], [[Alice B. Toklas]] and [[Hermann von Wedderkop]].

The memoir was published [[wikt:posthumously|posthumously]] based on Hemingway's manuscripts and notes by his fourth wife and widow, [[Mary Hemingway]], in 1964, three years after Hemingway's death. An edition altered and revised by his grandson, Seán Hemingway, was published in 2009.

==Background==
In November 1956, Hemingway recovered two small steamer trunks that he had stored in March 1928 in the basement of the [[Hôtel Ritz Paris]]. The trunks contained notebooks he had filled during the 1920s.&lt;ref name="Hotchner"/&gt; Hemingway's friend and biographer [[A. E. Hotchner]], who was with him in Paris in 1956, later recounted the occasion of Hemingway's recovery of the trunks and notebooks:&lt;ref name="Hotchner"/&gt;

{{Quote box
 |quote  = '''"''In 1956, Ernest and I were having lunch at the [[Hôtel Ritz Paris|Ritz in Paris]] with [[Charles Ritz]], the hotel’s chairman, when Charley asked if Ernest was aware that a trunk of his was in the basement storage room, left there in 1930. Ernest did not remember storing the trunk but he did recall that in the 1920s [[Louis Vuitton]] had made a special trunk for him. Ernest had wondered what had become of it. Charley had the trunk brought up to his office, and after lunch Ernest opened it. It was filled with a ragtag collection of clothes, menus, receipts, memos, hunting and fishing paraphernalia, skiing equipment, racing forms, correspondence and, on the bottom, something that elicited a joyful reaction from Ernest: 'The notebooks! So that’s where they were! Enfin!' There were two stacks of lined notebooks like the ones used by schoolchildren in Paris when he lived there in the ’20s. Ernest had filled them with his careful handwriting while sitting in his favorite café, nursing a [[Café au lait|café crème]]. The notebooks described the places, the people, the events of his [[penurious]] life.''"'''

Having recovered his trunks, Hemingway had the notebooks transcribed, and then began working them up into the memoir that would eventually become ''A Moveable Feast''.&lt;ref name=HowItWas/&gt; After Hemingway's death in 1961, his widow Mary Hemingway, in her capacity as his literary executor, made final copy-edits to the manuscript prior to its publication in 1964.&lt;ref name="Hotchner"/&gt;&lt;ref name=HowItWas/&gt; In a "Note" with which she prefaced the posthumously published 1964 edition of the work, she wrote:

{{Quote box
 |quote  = '''"''Ernest started writing this book in Cuba in the autumn of 1957, worked on it in Ketchum, Idaho, in the winter of 1958-59, took it with him to Spain ... in April, 1959, and brought it back with him to Cuba and then to Ketchum late that fall. He finished the book in the spring of 1960 in Cuba.... He made some revisions ... in the fall of 1960 in Ketchum. It concerns the years 1921 to 1926 in Paris''." - M.H.'''

Gerry Brenner, a literary scholar at the [[University of Montana]], and other researchers have examined Hemingway's notes and the initial drafts of ''A Moveable Feast'', which are in the collection of Ernest Hemingway's personal papers opened to the public in 1979, following the completion of the [[John F. Kennedy Library]], where they are held in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]. In a paper titled "Are We Going to Hemingway's Feast?" (1982), Brenner undertook to document Mary Hemingway's editing process and questioned its validity. He concluded that some of her changes were misguided, and others derived from questionable motives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Brenner, Gerry|title=Are We Going To Hemingway's Feast?|journal=American Literature|volume= 54|number=4|date=December 1982|page= 528}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also suggested that the changes appeared to contradict Mary's stated policy for her role as executor, which had been to maintain a "hands off" approach.&lt;ref name=HowItWas&gt;{{cite book|author=Hemingway, Mary|title=How It Was|location= New York|publisher= Ballantine|date= 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brenner states that Mary changed the order of the chapters in Hemingway's final draft, apparently to "preserve chronology". This change interrupted the series of juxtaposed character sketches of such individuals as [[Sylvia Beach]], owner of the bookstore [[Shakespeare and Company (bookstore)|Shakespeare &amp; Company]], and [[Gertrude Stein]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} The chapter titled "Birth of a New School", which Hemingway had dropped from his draft, was reinserted by Mary.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} Brenner alleges the most serious change was the deletion of Hemingway's lengthy apology to his first wife, [[Hadley Richardson|Hadley]]. This apology appeared in various forms in every draft of the book.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} Brenner suggests that Mary deleted it because it impugned her own role as his wife.

In contrast, Hotchner has said that he received a near final draft of ''A Moveable Feast'' in 1959, and that the version Mary Hemingway published is essentially the draft he had read then. In his view, the original 1964 publication is the version that Hemingway intended, and Mary Hemingway did not revise or add chapters on her own initiative, but simply carried out Ernest's intentions.&lt;ref name="Hotchner"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/20/opinion/20hotchner.html | work=The New York Times | title=Don't Touch 'A Moveable Feast' | first=A. E. | last=Hotchner | date=2009-07-19 | accessdate=2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hotchner describes Hemingway's memoir as "a serious work", that Hemingway "certainly intended it for publication", and contends: "Because Mary was busy with matters relating to Ernest’s estate, she had little involvement with the book.... What I read on the plane coming back from Cuba [in 1959] was essentially what was published. There was no extra chapter created by Mary.&lt;ref name="Hotchner"/&gt;

==Source of title==

{{Quote box
 |quote  = '''"''If you are lucky enough to have lived in Paris as a young man, then wherever you go for the rest of your life, it stays with you, for Paris is a movable feast''." - Ernest Hemingway, ''to a friend'', 1950'''

}}

The title of ''A Moveable Feast'' (a play on words for the term used for a [[moveable feast|holy day for which the date is not fixed]]) was suggested by Hemingway's friend and biographer A. E. Hotchner, who remembered Hemingway using the term in 1950.&lt;ref name=PapaHem/&gt; Hotchner's recollection of what Hemingway had said became the source of the [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] on the [[title page]] for the posthumously published work in 1964.&lt;ref name=PapaHem&gt;{{cite book|author=Hotchner, A.E.|title=Papa Hemingway|location=  New York|publisher= Random House|date= 1966|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term had also been used earlier out of its traditional religious context by [[Albert Camus]] in his novel, ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]'' (1942): "Masson remarked that we'd had a very early lunch, but really lunch was a movable feast, one had it when one felt like it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/ost-english-camusalbert-thestranger/CamusAlbert-TheStranger_djvu.txt|title=The Stranger|author=Camus, Albert|date=1942}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=The original in French does not (and cannot) contain this pun.|date=January 2017}}

==Chapters==

==Publishing history==

The first published edition was edited from Hemingway's manuscripts and notes by his fourth wife and widow, [[Mary Hemingway]], and published [[wikt:posthumously|posthumously]] in 1964, three years after Hemingway's death.&lt;ref name="Hotchner"/&gt;&lt;ref name=HowItWas/&gt;

In 2009 a new edition, titled the "Restored Edition", was published by [[Seán Hemingway]], assistant curator at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] and grandson of Hemingway and [[Pauline Pfeiffer]]. He made numerous changes:
* The previous introductory letter by Hemingway, pieced together from various fragments by Mary Hemingway,{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} was removed.
* The chapter called "Birth of a New School" and large sections of "Ezra Pound and the Measuring Worm" and "There is Never Any End to Paris" (which has been renamed as "Winter in Schruns" and moved to chapter 16) had sections previously left out that have been re-added. The unpublished "The Pilot Fish and the Rich" has been added.
* Chapter 7 ("Shakespeare and Company") has been moved to be chapter 3, and chapter 16 ("Nada y Pues Nada") has been moved to the end of the book as an "Additional Paris Sketch".
* Hemingway's use of the second person has been restored in many places, a change which Seán asserts "brings the reader into the story".&lt;ref name="restoredp4"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hemingway, Ernest|author2=Hemingway, Seán|editor=Hemingway, Seán |title=A Moveable Feast: The Restored Edition|publisher= Scribner's|location= New York|date= 2009|page= 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the new foreword by [[Patrick Hemingway]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[H]ere is the last bit of professional writing by my father, the true foreword to ''A Moveable Feast'': 'This book contains material from the ''remises'' of my memory and of my heart.  Even if the one has been tampered with and the other does not exist'."&lt;ref name="restoredpxiv"&gt;Hemingway, Seán (ed.) (2009), p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A.E. Hotchner alleged, among his other criticisms of the 2009 edition, that Seán Hemingway had edited it, in part, to exclude references to his grandmother (Hemingway's second wife Pauline Pfeiffer) that he found less than flattering.&lt;ref name="Hotchner"/&gt; As Hotchner's over-all assessment of the 2009 edition, he wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Ernest was very protective of the words he wrote, words that gave the literary world a new style of writing. Surely he has the right to have these words protected against frivolous incursion, like this reworked volume that should be called “A Moveable Book”.&lt;ref name="Hotchner"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other critics also have found fault with some of Seán Hemingway's editorial changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Massie, Allan |date=August 5, 2009 |url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/books/5244378/life-and-letters.thtml |title=Rewrites and Wrongs |work=The Spectator |accessdate=February 16, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329053638/http://www.spectator.co.uk/books/5244378/life-and-letters.thtml |archive-date=March 29, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Irene Gammel writes about the new edition: "Ethically and pragmatically, restoring an author's original intent is a slippery slope when the published text has stood the test of time and when edits have been approved by authors or their legal representatives." Pointing to the complexity of authorship, she concludes: “Mary's version should be considered the definitive one, while the 'restored' version provides access to important unpublished contextual sources that illuminate the evolution of the 1964 edition.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Gammel, Irene |date= August 21, 2009|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/books/a-changeable-feast/article1259835/ |title=A Changeable Feast|work=The Globe and Mail|accessdate= February 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film and television adaptations==

== Revival in wake of 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris==

In the context of the attacks, the book's French-language title, ''Paris est une fête'', was a potent symbol of defiance and celebration.

'''African Wax Prints''' also known as '''Ankara''' and '''Dutch wax prints''' are omnipresent and common materials for clothing in [[Africa]], especially [[West Africa]]. They are industrially produced, colorful cotton cloths with [[batik]]-inspired printing.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriele Gerlich: [http://www.ifeas.uni-mainz.de/workingpapers/AP54nurtext.pdf ''Waxprints im soziokulturellen Kontext Ghanas ''] (PDF, 2,1 MB). Online Institut für Ethnologie und Afrikastudien, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt; One feature of these materials is the lack of difference in the color intensity of front and back side. The wax fabric can be sorted into categories of quality due to the processes of manufacturing.

Normally, the fabrics are sold in 12 yards as "full piece" or 6 yards as "half piece". The colors comply with the local preferences of the customers. Mainly clothing for celebrations is made out of these.

The wax prints are part of a nonverbal way of communication among African women, and hereby they carry their message out into the world. Some wax prints can be named after personalities, cities, building, sayings or occasions. The producer, name of the product and registration number of the design is printed on the selvage, protecting the design and allowing reading the quality of the fabric. The wax fabrics constitute capital goods for the African women. Therefore, they are collected depending on the financial possibilities.

The design of the wax print fabrics already has an influence on the international world of fashion and lifestyle. They are an inspirational source for designers and companies.
In Sub-Sahara Africa the African Print textiles belong to the most popular textiles with an annual sales volume of 2.1 billion yards, with an average production cost of $2.6 billion and retail value of $4 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://guardian.ng/features/youthspeak/in-textile-industry-a-hidden-goldmine/|title=In textile industry, a hidden goldmine|website=In textile industry, a hidden goldmine|access-date=2018-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ghana has an annual consumption of textiles about 130 million yards. The three largest local manufacturers ATL, GTP and Printex produce 30 million yards. 100 million yard come from cheap, and smuggled Asian imports.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.myjoyonline.com/business/2017/september-19th/textile-industry-needs-attention-to-boost-local-manufacturing.php/|title=Textile industry needs attention to boost local manufacturing |website=Textile industry needs attention to boost local manufacturing|access-date=2018-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vlisco]] Group with its brands Vlisco, Uniwax, Woodin and GTP produced 58.8 million yards (53.8 million meters), of fabric in 2011. The net sales were €225 million, or $291.65 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/15/fashion/15iht-ffabric15.html/|title=Africa's Fabric Is Dutch|website=Africa's Fabric Is Dutch|access-date=2018-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 all of its 70 million yards of fabric (about 64 million meters) are produced in the Netherlands. In 2014 Vlisco made a turnover of 300 million euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://yen.com.gh/86744-wax-prints-vlisco-making-african.html#86744/|title=Wax prints, like Vlisco, are still making believe that they are African|website=Wax prints, like Vlisco, are still making believe that they are African|access-date=2018-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The process to make wax print is originally influenced by [[batik]], an [[Indonesia|Indonesian]] ([[Java|Javanese]]) method of dyeing cloth by using wax-resist techniques. For batik, wax is melted and then patterned across the blank cloth. From there, the cloth is soaked in dye, which is prevented from covering the entire cloth by the wax. If additional colors are required, the wax-and-soak process is repeated with new patterns.

During the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonization of Indonesia]], Dutch merchants and administrators became familiar with the batik technique.  Thanks to this contact, the owners of textile factories in the Netherlands, such as [[Jean Baptiste Theodore Prévinaire]]&lt;ref name="kroese"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The origin of the Wax Block Prints on the Coast of West Africa.|last=Kroese|first=W.T.|publisher=Smit|year=1976|isbn=9062895018|location=Hengelo}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|16}} and Pieter [[Fentener van Vlissingen]]&lt;ref name="vlisco"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vlisco.com/heritage/the-founding-of-vlisco/|title=The Founding of Vlisco - Vlisco|work=Vlisco|access-date=2017-09-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, received examples of batik textiles by the 1850s if not before, and started developing machine printing processes which could imitate batik.  They hoped that these much cheaper machine-made imitations could outcompete the original batiks in the Indonesian market, effecting the look of batik without all the labor-intensive work required to make the real thing. 

Prévinaire's attempt, part of a broader movement of [[Haarlem#Cotton_mills|industrial textile innovation in Haarlem]], was the most successful. By 1854&lt;ref name="kroese" /&gt;{{rp|16-17}} he had modified a [[Perrotine printing|Perrotine]], the mechanical block-printing machine invented in 1834 by Louis-Jérôme Perrot, to instead apply a resin to both sides of the cloth.&lt;ref name="lagamma"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Essential Art of African Textiles: Design Without End.|last=LaGamma|first=Alisa|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|year=2009|isbn=|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|20}} This mechanically applied resin took the place of the wax in the batik process.

Another method, used by several factories including Prévinaire's&lt;ref name="kroese" /&gt;{{rp|18,20}} and van Vlissingen's,&lt;ref name="vlisco" /&gt; used the [[Roller printing on textiles|roller printing]] technology invented in Scotland in the 1780s.

Unfortunately for the Dutch, these imitation wax-resist fabrics did not successfully penetrate the batik market.  Among other obstacles, the imitations lacked the distinctive wax smell of the batik fabric.&lt;ref name="kroese" /&gt;{{rp|17-18}}

Starting in the 1880s,&lt;ref name="vlisco" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kroese" /&gt;{{rp|47,50}} they did, however, experience a strong reception in West Africa when Dutch and Scottish trading vessels began introducing the fabrics in those ports.  Initial demand may have been driven by the taste for batik developed by the [[Belanda Hitam]], West Africans recruited between 1831 and 1872 from the [[Dutch Gold Coast]] to serve in the [[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army|Dutch colonializing army in Indonesia]].  Many members of the Belanda Hitam retired to [[Elmina]], in modern [[Ghana]], where they may have provided an early market for Dutch imitation batik.&lt;ref name="kroese" /&gt;{{rp|41-46}}

The success of the trade in West Africa prompted other manufacturers, including Scottish, English, and Swiss manufacturers, to enter the market.

The Dutch wax prints quickly integrated themselves into African apparel, sometimes under names such as “Veritable Dutch Hollandais,” and “Wax Hollandais”. Women used the fabrics as a method of communication and expression, with certain patterns being used as a shared language, with widely understood meanings. Many patterns began receiving catchy names. Over time, the prints became more African-inspired, and African-owned by the mid-twentieth century. They also began to be used as formal wear by leaders, diplomats, and the wealthy population.

== Wax Print Cloth Production ==

Prévinaire's method for the production of imitation batik cloth proceeds as follows.  A block-printing machine applies resin to both sides of the fabric.  It is then submerged into the dye, in order to allow the dye to repel the resin covered parts of the fabric. This process is repeated, to build up a coloured design on the fabric. Multiple wooden stamp blocks would be needed for each colour within the design. The cloth is then boiled to remove the resin and is usually reused.&lt;ref name="gillow"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Printed and Dyed textiles from Africa|last=Gillow|first=John|publisher=The British Museum Press|year=2009|isbn=|location=London|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the resin on the cloth can be crinkled in order to form cracks or lines that are known as ‘crackles’. The English- and Dutch-produced fabrics tended to have more cracking in the resin than those produced in Switzerland.&lt;ref name="gillow"/&gt;
Due to the lengthy stages of its production, wax prints are more expensive to make than other commercial printed fabrics but their finished designs are clear on both sides and have distinct colour combinations.&lt;ref name="lagamma"/&gt;{{rp|15}}

== Wax Print Manufacturers ==

After a merger in 1875, the company founded by Prévinaire became Haarlemsche Katoenmaatschappij (Haarlem Cotton Company).  The Haarlemsche Katoenmaatschappij went bankrupt during the First World War, and its copper roller printing cylinders were bought by van Vlissingen's company.&lt;ref name="kroese" /&gt;{{rp|20-21,59}}

In 1927, van Vlissingen's company rebranded as [[Vlisco]]. 

Before the 1960s most of the African wax fabric sold in West and Central Africa was manufactured in Europe. Today, Africa is home to the production of high quality wax prints.&lt;ref name="magie" /&gt; Manufacturers across Africa include ABC Wax, Woodin, Uniwax, Akosombo Textiles Limited (ATL), and GTP (Ghana Textiles Printing Company); the latter three being part a part of the Vlisco Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gtpfashion.com/about-gtp/|title=About GTP - GTP Fashion|work=GTP Fashion|access-date=2017-09-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; These companies have helped reduce the prices of African wax prints in the continent when compared to European imports.

== African Fancy Print ==
The costly produced wax fabrics are increasingly imitated by alternative ways of manufacturing. The so-called "fancy fabrics" are produced in a printing procedure. Costly designs are printed digitally.

Fancy fabrics in general are cheap, industrially produced imitations of the wax prints and are based on industry print. Fancy fabrics are also called imiwax, Java print, roller print, le fancy or le légos. These fabrics are produced for mass consumption and stand for ephemerality and caducity. Fancy Fabrics are more intense and rich in colors than wax prints and are printed on only one side.

As for wax prints, producer, product name and registration number of the design are printed on the selvage. Even the fancy fabrics vary with a certain fashion. The fabrics are limited to amount and design and are sometimes exclusively sold in own shops.

At first the Fancy Prints were made with engraved metal rollers but more recently they are produced using rotary screen-printing process.&lt;ref name="magie"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/751824945|title=African wax print : a textile journey|last=Magie.|first=Relph,|date=2010|publisher=Published by Words and Pixels for the African Fabric Shop|others=Irwin, Robert, 1952-|year=|isbn=9780956698209|location=Meltham|pages=32|oclc=751824945}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The production of these imitation wax print fabrics, allow those who cannot afford the European imported wax prints to be able to purchase these. The fancy print designs often mimic or copy the designs of existing wax print designs but as they are cheaper to make, manufacturers tend to take risks and experiment with new designs.&lt;ref name="magie" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3845">'''Amadhia Albee''' (previously under the stage-/pen-names, '''Timothy Albee''' and then '''Amadhi Albee''') is the creator of ''[[Kaze, Ghost Warrior]]'', which she made when she was credited as Timothy Albee. Amadhia needed six months to complete the 22 minute short film, using two computers. She also published a book on the process she used.

== Biography ==

=== Timothy Albee ===
Amadhia Albee was born in [[Michigan]] and raised in a very small farming community. She bought her first computer when she was 10 years old (Tandy [[TRS-80 Color Computer]]) from saving a year's worth of can/bottle refunds. She started college at a state university, and then went to [[College for Creative Studies]] (CCS) in [[Detroit]], but left shortly thereafter due to her disappointment with the faculty's inability to teach her what she wanted to learn. She apprenticed to a flute-master in [[Virginia]] for a while, learning to make [[bamboo]] flutes, then traveled the Renaissance Faire circuit where she worked as a bard, juggler, [[sleight-of-hand]] artist, "martial-arts juggler," swordswoman and various and sundry other very odd jobs.

Living in [[California]] in 1991, she worked as a professional musician focusing mainly on folk and classical harp. She was hired to do sound production for a small music label where she was first exposed to the [[Video Toaster]]. After a few years in California, she took a sabbatical, returning to Michigan to finish her degree.

She started working for a company to which [[Disney Interactive]] was outsourcing its Animated Storybooks and got back into animation. Then she went back to California to be lead animator on [[Activision]]'s ''[[Apocalypse]]''. She then went on to work on the science fiction television series ''[[Babylon 5]],'' and then to [[Walt Disney Feature Animation]] to work on the feature film [[Dinosaur (film)|''Dinosaur'']]. After WDFA, she formed Exile Films, which was rolled into Studio Mythos when offshore investors took over, leading the studio in a completely contrary direction. Securing the company a gig to fulfill her obligations, she left everything associated with Mythos and drove north. She started working on the next episode in the ''Kaze, Ghost Warrior'' series and was hired on to animate the Cylon Centurions for the third season of the ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' television series.

=== Amadhia Albee ===
On November 27, 2012, Timothy Albee, who had already worked under the name, Amadhi Albee and announced herself as [[genderqueer]] in [[gender identity|identity]], had revealed that, since at least 
2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.furaffinity.net/journal/727409/ Dreamsong journal entry: May 4, 2009, referenced as the earliest known of Amadhia Albee's journals]&lt;/ref&gt; she was a woman named Amadhia Albee, and describing Timothy as her "spiritual twin brother" and a persona she had "created" long ago.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.furaffinity.net/journal/4070703/ Timothy Albee journal entry: November 27, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;  She announced that she was continuing work on the ''Kaze, Ghost Warrior'' storyline, which had been for years delayed.

The '''Barack Obama "Hope" poster''' is an image of [[Barack Obama]] designed by artist [[Shepard Fairey]], which was widely described as iconic and came to represent his [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008|2008 presidential campaign]].&lt;ref name="Pasick"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.reuters.com/photo/2009/01/15/iconic-obama-poster-based-on-reuters-photo/|title=Iconic Obama poster based on Reuters photo|last=Pasick|first=Adam|date=January 15, 2009|agency=Reuters|accessdate=January 20, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090120032224/http://blogs.reuters.com/photo/2009/01/15/iconic-obama-poster-based-on-reuters-photo/|archivedate=January 20, 2009|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7872253.stm Copyright battle over Obama image]", BBC News, February 5, 2009. Retrieved February 22, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of a stylized [[stencil]] portrait of Obama in solid red, beige and (light and dark) blue, with the word "progress", "hope" or "change" below (and other  words in some versions).

The design was created in one day and printed first as a poster. Fairey sold 290 of the posters on the street immediately after printing them. It was then more widely distributed&amp;mdash;both as a digital image and other paraphernalia&amp;mdash;during the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 election season]], initially independently but with the approval of the official Obama campaign.  The image became one of the most widely recognized symbols of Obama's campaign message, spawning many variations and imitations, including some commissioned by the Obama campaign. This led ''[[The Guardian]]'s'' [[Laura Barton]] to proclaim that the image "acquired the kind of instant recognition of [[Che Guevara (photo)#Jim Fitzpatrick|Jim Fitzpatrick's Che Guevara poster]], and is surely set to grace T-shirts, coffee mugs and the walls of student bedrooms in the years to come."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/nov/10/barackobama-usa Hope - the Image that is Already an American Classic] by Laura Barton, ''The Guardian'', November 10, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, after Obama had won the election, Fairey's [[mixed-media]] stenciled portrait version of the image was acquired by the [[Smithsonian Institution]] for its [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]].  Later in January 2009, the photograph on which Fairey based the poster was revealed: a June 2006 shot by former [[Associated Press]] freelance photographer [[Mannie Garcia]].  In response to claims by the [[Associated Press]] for compensation, Fairey sued for a [[declaratory judgment]] that his poster was a [[fair use]] of the original photograph. The parties settled out of court in January 2011, with details of the settlement remaining confidential.

On February 29, 2012, Fairey pleaded guilty in a New York federal court to destroying and fabricating documents during his legal battle with the Associated Press. Fairey had sued the news service in 2008 after it claimed that the famous poster was based on one of its photos. Fairey claimed that he used a different photograph for the poster. But he admitted that, in fact, he was wrong and tried to hide the error by destroying documents and manufacturing others, which is the source of the one count of criminal contempt to which he pleaded guilty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/creator-of-popular-obama-hope-poster-pleads-to-criminal-contempt-charge-in-nyc/2012/02/24/gIQAoEH3XR_story.html|title=- The Washington Post|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=March 22, 2018|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September, Fairey was sentenced to two years of [[probation]], 300 hours of [[community service]], and a fine of $25,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-shepard-fairey-20120908,0,6021274.story|title=Shepard Fairey sentenced to probation, fine in Obama 'Hope' case|author=David Ng|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=September 8, 2012|accessdate=September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 Fairey's Obama portrait was featured in the book ''[[Art For Obama: Designing Manifest Hope and the Campaign for Change]]'' which Fairey also edited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/2008-09-11/columns/yosi-sergant-and-the-art-of-change-the-publicist-behind-shepard-fairey-39-s-obama-hope-posters/|title=Yosi Sergant and the Art of Change: The Publicist Behind Shepard Fairey's Obama Hope Posters|first=Seven|last=Mcdonald|date=September 10, 2008|website=laweekly.com|accessdate=March 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.obeygiant.com/headlines/art-for-obama-book Obeythegiant.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' in 2015 Fairey said that Obama had not lived up, "not even close," to his expectations. He continued, "Obama has had a really tough time, but there have been a lot of things that he's compromised on that I never would have expected. I mean, drones and domestic spying are the last things I would have thought [he'd support]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/interviews/a35288/shepard-fairey-street-art-obama-hope-poster/|title=Fairey: Obama Didn't Live Up to My 'Hope' Poster|author=|date=May 28, 2015|website=esquire.com|accessdate=March 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concept and design ==
[[Shepard Fairey]], who had created earlier political [[street art]] critical of government and of [[George W. Bush]], discussed the nascent Obama campaign with publicist [[Yosi Sergant]] in late October 2007.  Sergant suggested Fairey create some art in support of Obama.  Sergant contacted the Obama campaign to seek its permission for Fairey to design an Obama poster, which was granted a few weeks before [[Super Tuesday]]. Fairey has said that his decision to create a portrait of Obama stemmed from Fairey's feeling that Obama's "power and sincerity as a speaker would create a positive association with his likeness."&lt;ref name=JOLT /&gt; Fairey found a photograph of Obama using [[Google Image Search]] (eventually revealed to be an April 2006 photo by freelancer [[Mannie Garcia]] for The [[Associated Press]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mac.com/manniegarcia/iWeb/mannie%20garcia/Hope.html Mannie Garcia] website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gralish2"/&gt; and created the original poster design in a single day.  The original image had the word "{{smallcaps|progress}}" and featured Fairey's signature {{smallcaps|obey}} star&amp;mdash;a symbol associated with his ''[[Andre the Giant Has a Posse]]'' street art campaign&amp;mdash;embedded in the Obama campaign's [[Obama logo|sunrise logo]].&lt;ref name="Interview"&gt;Ben Arnon, "[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ben-arnon/how-the-obama-hope-poster_b_133874.html How the Obama "Hope" Poster Reached a Tipping Point and Became a Cultural Phenomenon: An Interview With the Artist Shepard Fairey]", ''[[Huffington Post]]'', October 13, 2009. Retrieved January 17, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the Obama campaign's concerns about the troublesome connotations of the original wording, Fairey changed the slogan printed under Obama's image from "{{smallcaps|progress}}" to "{{smallcaps|hope}}."&lt;ref name=JOLT&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fisher III|first=William W. |author2=Frank Cost |author3=Shepard Fairey |author4=Meir Feder |author5=Edwin Fountain |author6=Geoffrey Stewart |author7=Marita Sturken|title=Reflections on the Hope Poster Case|journal=Harvard Journal of Law and Technology|date=Spring 2012|volume=25|issue=2|url=http://jolt.law.harvard.edu/articles/pdf/v25/25HarvJLTech243.pdf|accessdate=January 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to design writer [[Steven Heller (graphic design)|Steven Heller]], the poster was inspired by [[Social Realism]] and, while widely praised as original and unique, can be seen as part of a long tradition of contemporary artists drawing inspiration from political candidates and producing "posters that break the mold not only in terms of color and style but also in message and tone."&lt;ref&gt;Steven Heller, "[http://campaignstops.blogs.nytimes.com/tag/shepard-fairey/ Beyond Red, White and Blue]", ''Campaign Stops Blog'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', February 15, 2008. Retrieved February 21, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Fairey has said, "My historical inspiration was the well-known JFK portrait where he is posed in a three-quarters view looking slightly upward and out into the distance. The image of Lincoln on the five-dollar bill has a similar feel."&lt;ref name=JOLT /&gt;

==Distribution during the 2008 campaign==
Fairey began [[screen-printing]] posters soon after completing the design and showing it to Yosi Sergant. Initially, he sold 350 and put 350 more up in public. Beginning with that sale and continuing throughout the campaign, Fairey used proceeds from selling the image to produce more of it; after first printing, he made 4,000 more that were distributed at Obama rallies before [[Super Tuesday, 2008|Super Tuesday]]. He also put a printable digital version on his website. As Fairey explained in an October 2008 interview, the image quickly [[Viral phenomenon|went viral]], spreading spontaneously through [[social media]] and [[word of mouth]].&lt;ref name="Interview"/&gt;

After the initial 700 posters, the Obama campaign conveyed through Sergant that they wanted to promote the theme of ''hope'', and most of the posters sold by Fairey subsequently had the word "{{smallcaps|hope}}" and later "{{smallcaps|change}}" instead of "{{smallcaps|progress}}"; the {{smallcaps|obey}} star was also absent from later versions. By October 2008, Fairey and Sergant claimed to have printed 300,000 posters (with less than 2,000 sold and the rest given away or displayed) and 1,000,000 stickers, as well as clothing and other items with the image sold through Fairey's website, in addition to copies printed by others.&lt;ref name="Interview"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Booth, "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/artsandliving/style/features/2008/obama-poster-051808/graphic.html Street Artist Fairey Gives Obama a Line of Cred], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', May 18, 2008. Retrieved January 17, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Fairey and Sergant, proceeds from sales of the image were used to produce more posters and other merchandise in support of the Obama campaign, rather than direct profit for Fairey.&lt;ref name="Interview"/&gt;

==Parodies and imitations==
As the campaign progressed, many [[parody|parodies]] and imitations of Fairey's design appeared.  For example, one anti-Obama version replaced the word "{{smallcaps|hope}}" with "{{smallcaps|hype}}", while parody posters featuring opponents [[Sarah Palin]] and [[John McCain]] had the word "{{smallcaps|nope}}".&lt;ref&gt;Kate Linthicum, "[http://articles.latimes.com/2008/oct/09/nation/na-trailfairey9 Artist’s Obama poster spawns wave of parodies]", ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', October 8, 2008. Retrieved February 21, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 2009 ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' magazine launched a site allowing users to create their own versions of the poster.  More than 10,000 images were uploaded to the site in its first two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.thestar.com/printArticle/573737 |title=How you, too, can look and talk like Obama |work=The Star| location=Toronto | deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023010407/http://www.thestar.com/printArticle/573737 |archive-date=2012-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foliomag.com/2009/paste-s-obama-site-surpasses-magazine-s-online-traffic-less-week|title=Paste’s Obama Site Surpasses Magazine’s Online Traffic in Less Than a Week - Folio:|author=|date=January 19, 2009|website=foliomag.com|accessdate=March 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2009/01/make-your-own-o.html|title=ABC News|author=|date=|website=abcnews.com|accessdate=March 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine parodied the "{{smallcaps|hope}}" poster with an "[[Alfred E. Neuman]] for President!" poster. Alfred was on the poster, and the word "{{smallcaps|hope}}" was replaced with "{{smallcaps|hopeless}}". Anti-Gaddafi protesters in Chicago, in solidarity with the [[2011 Libyan civil war]], have co-opted the image.
[[Dynamite Comics]] released a four-part crossover with Obama and [[Ash Williams]] of their ''[[Army of Darkness (comics)|Army of Darkness]]'' comics and the ''[[Evil Dead]]'' films. One of the issues covers had a picture of Ash Williams (played by [[Bruce Campbell]] in the films) in the style of the "Hope" poster with the bottom text reading "Hope?"

Fairey was also commissioned to create a number of works in the same style. He produced two other versions, based on different photographs, officially on behalf of the Obama campaign,&lt;ref&gt;Nicole Powers, "[http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/Shepard+Fairey%3A+Purveyor+of+Hope/ Shepard Fairey: Purveyor of Hope]", ''[[SuicideGirls]]'', December 12, 2008. Retrieved February 22, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and another to serve as the cover of the ''[[Time Person of the Year|Person of the Year]]'' issue of [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']].&lt;ref&gt;Brian Stelter, "[http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/12/22/business/22time.php Time cover sure looks a lot like a campaign image]", ''International Herald Tribune'', December 22, 2008. Retrieved February 22, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also created a portrait of comedian [[Stephen Colbert]] in the same style, which appeared in an issue of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' honoring Colbert's television show ''[[The Colbert Report]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Colbert, "[http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/215976/january-15-2009/shepard-fairey Shepard Fairey]", ''The Colbert Report'', January 15, 2009. Retrieved February 22, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Firas Alkhateeb, the student who designed the controversial [[Barack Obama "Joker" poster|Obama "Joker" image]], cited Fairey as being his greatest influence.&lt;ref name=thenational&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thenational.ae/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090901/LIFE/708319970/1239 | title=The joke’s on who? | last=Good | first=Oliver | date=September 1, 2009 | work=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]] |location=Abu Dhabi | accessdate=September 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alkhateeb described the "Joker" image as a corrective to Fairey's glowing portrayal of Obama.&lt;ref name=thenational/&gt;&lt;ref name=chicagotribune&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/features/chi-0819-obama-jokeraug19,0,4266819.story | title=Talking to the Chicago college student who may be behind Obama-as-Joker poster | last=Borrelli | first=Christopher | date=August 19, 2009 | work=[[Chicago Tribune]] | accessdate=September 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fairey has both criticized and praised the "Joker" poster, stating "The artwork is great in that it gets a point across really quickly", but "I don't agree with the political content of the poster".&lt;ref name=chicagotribune/&gt;&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite news | url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2009/08/obama-joker-shepard-fairey.html | title=Shepard Fairey has 'doubts' about intelligence of Obama Joker artist | last=Milian | first=Mark | date=August 10, 2009 | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | accessdate=September 25, 2009 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090812204954/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2009/08/obama-joker-shepard-fairey.html| archivedate= August 12, 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservative satire site The People's Cube made visual and verbal punning images, such as "Chaos" with an image of [[Rush Limbaugh]] ("Operation Chaos"), "Shrugged" with an image of [[Ayn Rand]] (for her novel ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'') and "Marxism" with an image of [[Groucho Marx]].

The September 2009 issue of ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'', America's oldest-continuing [[LGBT]] publication, featured a cover image similar to Fairey's design.  The blue and red coloring was replaced with pink and purple, but instead of "{{smallcaps|hope}}", the caption was "{{smallcaps|nope?}}".&lt;ref name=advocate&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8297500.stm | title=Obama: Letting down gay supporters? | last=Mirchandani | first=Rajesh | authorlink=Rajesh Mirchandani | date=October 10, 2009 | publisher=[[BBC News]] | accessdate=October 10, 2009 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091013081840/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8297500.stm| archivedate= October 13, 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jon Barrett, the magazine's [[editor-in-chief]], said the cover expressed the frustration among some [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] members of the [[Gay community|LGBT community]].&lt;ref name=advocate/&gt;

The poster has also been parodied in popular culture. In the [[Futurama]] episode "[[Proposition Infinity]]," a similar poster of President [[Richard Nixon]] can be seen, with the slogan "DESPAIR". In the 2010 movie ''[[Megamind]]'', a version of the poster can be seen using Megamind's visage and the caption "NO YOU CAN'T", parodying Obama's campaign slogan "[[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008#Slogan|Yes we can]]". [[Disney]]'s animated series ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]'' has two episodes, "Nerds of a Feather" and "She's the Mayor", both with Obama's poster parodied with [[Candace Flynn|Candace's]] face. American heavy metal band [[Five Finger Death Punch]] has released a version with their mascot and the words "WAR", referring to their album ''[[War Is The Answer]]''.  In ''[[Iron Man 2]],'' [[Tony Stark]] receives a similar poster of the [[Iron Man]] armor and hangs it in his Malibu garage, much to the displeasure of his assistant and love interest [[Pepper Potts]]. The 4th season of ''[[BoJack Horseman]]'' features Mr. Peanutbutter's version of the poster as he's running for governor.

===Honest Gil Fulbright===
[[Shepard Fairey]] created an adaptation of the Obama HOPE poster for satirical Kentucky politician Honest Gil Fulbright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2014/08/11/why-the-artist-behind-obamas-hope-poster-is-helping-a-fake-candidate/|title=Why the artist behind Obama’s ‘Hope’ poster is helping a fake candidate|first=Sean|last=Sullivan|date=August 11, 2014|website=washingtonpost.com|accessdate=March 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poster for Honest Gil Fulbright features a portrait of [[Frank L.

[[Home Box Office (HBO)]] created a parody of the poster to promote the fifth season of their satire comedy ''[[Veep (TV series)|Veep]]''. The poster was placed on roadside billboards,&lt;ref&gt;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0ScGC7IOTMg/VxJ_uNk8r5I/AAAAAAACSrM/4cuJyXpIX9UXKZvarC5Qs6g5F_ocjXSsACLcB/s800/Veep%2BMaybe%2Bseason%2B5%2Bbillboard.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; and other public places to help promote the return.

===Fairey's adaptation for the Occupy movement===
[[File:Shepard Fairey Occupy Poster.jpg|left|thumb|Fairey's 2011 adaptation for the [[occupy movement]]]]
Sympathizing with the [[Occupy movement]], in November 2011 [[Shepard Fairey]] introduced a variation of his "Hope" poster. In the new poster, he featured a [[Guy Fawkes mask]], and the message "Mister President, we HOPE you're on our side", with the word "HOPE" in large font and the rest of the sentence in small font. The Obama campaign logo on the right was replaced by a similar logo with the inscription "[[We are the 99%]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/blogpost/post/shepard-fairey-asks-obama-to-support-occupy/2011/11/18/gIQAvzcQZN_blog.html|title=Shepard Fairey asks Obama to support Occupy|last=Bell|first=Melissa|date=November 20, 2011|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=November 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acquisition by Smithsonian==
On January 7, 2009, the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]] announced it had acquired Fairey's hand-finished [[collage]] ([[stencil]] and [[acrylic paint|acrylic]] on paper) version of the image (with the word "{{smallcaps|hope}}"), which the gallery said would go on display shortly before [[Barack Obama 2009 presidential inauguration|Obama's inauguration]] on January 20, 2009.  The work was commissioned and later donated by art collectors Heather and Tony Podesta (Tony is the brother of Obama's transition co-chairman [[John Podesta]]). It is an unusual acquisition, in that the National Portrait Gallery normally collects official portraits as presidents are leaving office rather than before they take office.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://face2face.si.edu/my_weblog/2009/01/npg-acquires-shepard-faireys-portrait-of-barack-obama.html NPG Acquires Shepard Fairey’s Portrait of Barack Obama]," National Portrait Gallery, January 7, 2009.

Falzone was quoted in the press release: "We believe fair use protects Shepard's right to do what he did here."&lt;ref name=usatoday/&gt; Fairey subsequently filed a federal lawsuit against the Associated Press, seeking a [[declaratory judgment]] that his use of the AP photograph was protected by the [[fair use]] doctrine and so did not infringe their copyright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/09/shepard-fairey-sues-associated-press-over-obama-poster/|title=Shepard Fairey Sues Associated Press Over Obama Poster|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 9, 2009|accessdate=February 9, 2009 | first=Dave | last=Itzkoff| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090211080158/http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/09/shepard-fairey-sues-associated-press-over-obama-poster/| archivedate= February 11, 2009 | deadurl= no}} The case is ''Shepard Fairey; Obey Giant Art Inc. v. The Associated Press'', No. 09-CV-1123, [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|S.D.N.Y.]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Fairey subsequently admitted that he had based the poster on the AP photograph and had fabricated and destroyed evidence to hide the fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/18/arts/design/18fairey.html|title=Artist Admits Using Other Photo for ‘Hope’ Poster|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 17, 2009|accessdate=November 5, 2009 | first=Liz | last=Robbins| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121114054518/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/18/arts/design/18fairey.html| archivedate=November 14, 2012| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fairey's admission came after one of his employees told him that he had discovered relevant documents on an old hard drive. Realizing that these documents would reveal his cover-up, Fairey told the truth to his attorney.&lt;ref name=JOLT /&gt;

Photographer Mannie Garcia contended that he retained copyright to the photo according to his AP contract. He said that he was "so proud of the photograph and that Fairey did what he did artistically with it, and the effect it had," but that he did not "condone people taking things, just because they can, off the Internet."&lt;ref name="Kennedy NTY"/&gt; Fairey countered that his conduct did not constitute "improper appropriation" because he had not taken any protected expression from Garcia's original photo. In addition, he claimed his behavior would qualify as a [[fair use]]. At trial AP would have to address both arguments.&lt;ref name=JOLT /&gt;

A judge urged a settlement, stating that AP would win the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Itzkoff |first=Dave |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/29/arts/design/29arts-JUDGEURGESRE_BRF.html |date=May 29, 2010 |title=Judge Urges Resolution in Use of Obama Photo |newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AP and Shepard Fairey settled out of court in January 2011. In a press release, the AP announced that the AP and Fairey "agreed to work together going forward with the Hope image and share the rights to make the posters and merchandise bearing the Hope image and to collaborate on a series of images that Fairey will create based on AP photographs. The parties have agreed to additional financial terms that will remain confidential."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ap.org/pages/about/pressreleases/pr_01122011a.html|title=AP and Shepard Fairey announce agreement in Obama poster case|date=January 12, 2011|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a separate criminal action, federal prosecutors suggested that Fairey should face prison time for the destruction of evidence in the case, with the government sentencing request stating that "[a] sentence without any term of imprisonment sends a terrible message to those who might commit the same sort of criminal conduct. Encouraging parties to game the civil litigation system [...] creates terrible incentives and subverts the truth-finding function of civil litigation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/shepard-fairey-sentencing-report-683412 |title=Feds Seek Prison Time For Obama "Hope" Artist |publisher=The Smoking Gun |date=September 5, 2012 |accessdate=December 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his sentence was ultimately limited to 300 hours of community service and a $30,000 fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/buster/shepard-fairey-dodges-prison-683412 |title=No Prison Time For Obama "Hope" Artist In Federal Contempt Case, Judge Rules |publisher=The Smoking Gun |date=September 7, 2012 |accessdate=December 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association''''', 564 U.S. 786 (2011), is a [[landmark case]] by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] that struck down a 2005 [[California]] law banning the sale of certain violent [[video game]]s to children without parental supervision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mediacoalition.org/VSDA-v.-Schwarzenegger- |title=Schwarzenegger v.

The ruling was seen as a significant victory for the [[video game industry]]. Several of the Court's justices suggested that the issue might need to be re-examined in the future, considering the changing nature of video games and their continuously improving technology.

== Background ==
{{Main|Video game controversy#Crime and violence|l1=Connection between video games and crime and violence}}
Many video games, as early as 1976's ''[[Death Race (1976 game)|Death Race]]'',&lt;ref name="wired history"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2007/10/how-protests-ag/ | title = How Protests Against Games Cause Them To Sell More Copies | first = Chris | last = Kohler | date = 2007-10-30 | accessdate = 2011-06-28 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110605001253/http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2007/10/how-protests-ag/ | archivedate = 2011-06-05 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; incorporate some aspect of violence into the gameplay mechanic, such as killing an enemy with a weapon, using explosives to destroy a structure, or engaging in dangerous vehicle races.  With modern technology, representations of such violence have become more realistic.  This has led to concerns that minors who play such video games will be influenced by the violence, altering their real-life behavior. Academic studies have attempted to find a connection between violent video games and the rate of violence and crimes from those that play them; some have stated a connection exists,&lt;ref name="Effects on aggressive behaviour"&gt;Anderson, C.

Foti]]'' case that would have attempted to ban sales of violent video games from minors.

[[File:ESRBrating.PNG|thumb|left|A typical ESRB rating label will identify the appropriate age group and specific content descriptors for each rated game.]]
To counteract these increasing complaints and attempts at legislation, the video game industry in the United States created the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]] (ESRB) in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.usatoday.com/tech/gaming/2011-06-28-video-game-ratings_n.htm | title = Game industry put focus on ratings years ago | first = Mike | last = Snider | date = 2011-06-28 | accessdate = 2011-06-28 | work = [[USA Today]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110702035618/http://www.usatoday.com/tech/gaming/2011-06-28-video-game-ratings_n.htm | archivedate = 2011-07-02 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was prompted by a 1993 congressional hearing over the violence in the video game ''[[Mortal Kombat]]'' and lack of consistent content ratings between publishers, with Congress threatening to pass legislation that would mandate a ratings system if the industry did not take its own steps. The industry reacted by forming the Interactive Digital Software Association, which would become the ESA, and establishing the ESRB. The ESRB, like the [[Motion Picture Association of America]]'s rating system, is a voluntary and self-regulated body that examines the content of video games as provided by the publisher before distribution, and given a rating describing the content within, generally classified from being all ages-appropriate to adult audiences only. Video game distributors are similarly bound by voluntary compliance to check the age of the purchaser against the rating of the game to prevent the sale of mature titles to younger players. Most stores prevent the sale of unrated games, so virtually every video game sold at retail in the United States is rated by the ESRB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.esrb.org/ratings/faq.jsp#1 | title = ESRB Frequently Asked Questions | publisher = [[ESRB]] | accessdate = 2011-06-28 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110624103954/http://www.esrb.org/ratings/faq.jsp#1 | archivedate = 2011-06-24 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts have been made to mandate the ratings system; the [[Family Entertainment Protection Act]], a 2005 bill introduced into the U.S. Congress by Senators [[Hillary Clinton]], [[Joseph Lieberman]], and [[Evan Bayh]], would have made ESRB participation mandatory with oversight by the Federal Trade Commission, and introduced fines for selling Mature or Adult-Only content to minors. The bill, however, did not clear the Senate. Though the ESRB met criticism in 2000–2005 for the ease of access of mature-rated games to minors, the Board has improved its efforts to enforce the ratings system at retailers. A 2011 report issued by the [[Federal Trade Commission]] found that the voluntary controls by the ESRB had the highest success rate of any media industry, preventing sales of mature titles to minors 87% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2011/04/violentkidsent.shtm | title = FTC Undercover Shopper Survey on Enforcement of Entertainment Ratings Finds Compliance Worst for Retailers of Music CDs and the Highest Among Video Game Sellers | date = 2011-04-20 | accessdate = 2011-06-28 | publisher = [[Federal Trade Commission]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110817072723/http://ftc.gov/opa/2011/04/violentkidsent.shtm | archivedate = 2011-08-17 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar content rating systems exist in other countries, including the [[British Board of Film Classification]], the [[Australian Classification Board]], and Japan's [[Computer Entertainment Rating Organization]].

== The California law ==
[[File:Leland Yee.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Former-California Senator [[Leland Yee]] introduced CA Law AB 1179, the law debated in the case.]]
In 2005, the [[California State Legislature]] passed AB 1179, sponsored by then-[[California State Senator]] [[Leland Yee]], which banned the sale of violent video games to anyone under age 18 and required clear labeling beyond the existing ESRB rating system.  The law would have a maximum $1000 fine for each infraction. The definition of "violent video game" used a variation of the [[Miller test]], a three-pronged test used previously by the [[United States Supreme Court]] to define when [[obscene]] speech is not protected under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].&lt;ref name="gamasutra analysis"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/6191/video_game_regulation_and_the_.php | title = Video Game Regulation and the Supreme Court: Schwarzenegger v.

The law was a second attempt by Senator Yee to enact restrictions for video game sales to minors. Yee's background as a [[child psychologist]] led him to assert there was a connection between video games and violence and believed that the government had strong interest in restricting video game sales to minors as was already done for pornographic works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://articles.latimes.com/2010/apr/29/business/la-fi-ct-facetime-20100429 | title = Lawmaker defends law banning sale of violent video games to minors | date = 2010-04-10 | accessdate = 2010-11-02 | first = Ben | last = Fritz | work = Los Angeles Times | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101031194737/http://articles.latimes.com/2010/apr/29/business/la-fi-ct-facetime-20100429 | archivedate = 2010-10-31 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Yee had drafted a law that would have required mature-rated video games to be stocked separately from other titles. Though the bill ultimately passed as CA Law AB 1793, the bill's language was diluted at its passage, only requiring stores to display the ESRB ratings system and provide information to parents about it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=4324 | title = Schwarzenegger Signs California Video Games Bill | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] | date = 2004-09-22 | accessdate = 2010-11-02 | first = David | last = Jenkins | first2 = Simon | last2 = Carless | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101109172729/http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=4324 | archivedate = 2010-11-09 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal challenges ==

=== The District Court opinion ===
Before the California bill was signed into law, the ESA and the Video Software Dealers Association (VSDA), now known as the [[Entertainment Merchants Association]] (EMA), were preparing a lawsuit to overturn the law, fearing that the "violent video game" definition would affect many titles that the ESRB has otherwise labeled appropriate for younger players, and threaten to harm the video game industry.&lt;ref name="gamespot signed" /&gt; The VSDA filed suit in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California]] and was later joined by the ESA. The two groups succeeded in obtaining a preliminary injunction in December 2005 to block enforcement of the law during the case; U.S. District Judge [[Ronald M. Whyte]] cited in his preliminary decision: "The plaintiffs have shown at least that serious questions are raised concerning the States' ability to restrict minors' First Amendment rights in connection with exposure to violent video games, including the question of whether there is a causal connection between access to such games and psychological or other harm to children."&lt;ref name="arstech injunction"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/old/content/2005/12/5825.ars | title = California game law blocked | first = Ken | last = Fisher | date = 2005-12-22 | accessdate = 2010-11-01 | publisher = [[Ars Technica]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100812143845/http://arstechnica.com/old/content/2005/12/5825.ars | archivedate = 2010-08-12 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2007, Whyte ultimately ruled for the plaintiffs, holding that the law violated the First Amendment, and that there was an insufficient showing of proof that either video games differed from other media or that there was established causality between violent video games and violent behavior.&lt;ref name="NDCalifDecision"&gt;{{Cite court|litigants=Video Software Dealers Ass'n, et al. v.

=== The Ninth Circuit appeal ===
[[File:Arnold Schwarzenegger 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Then-Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] led the appeal of the lower courts' decisions.]] California Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] appealed the ruling in September 2007, stating that he would "vigorously defend this law" and that he and the people of California have "a responsibility to our kids and our communities to protect against the effects of games that depict ultra-violent actions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=15064 | title = Schwarzenegger To Appeal California Game Law Ruling | first = James | last = Dobson | date = 2007-08-10 | accessdate = 2010-11-01 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101111025315/http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=15064 | archivedate = 2010-11-11 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] affirmed Whyte's decision in 2009.&lt;ref name="9thCirDecision"&gt;{{Cite court|litigants=Video Software Dealers Ass'n, et al. v. Schwarzenegger, et al. |vol=556 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=950 |pinpoint= |court=9th Cir. |date=2008 |url= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ninth Circuit considered the constitutionality of the law; given the timeframe of the law's passing relative to litigation, it was referred to as the "Act" in the court's opinion. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court's Summary Judgment for the VSDA by holding:
#The Act is a presumptively invalid content-based restriction on speech, so it is subject to strict scrutiny and not the "variable obscenity" standard from ''Ginsberg v. New York''.&lt;ref name="Ginsberg"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Ginsberg v. New York |vol=390 |reporter=U.S. |opinion=629 |pinpoint= |court= |date=1968 |url=http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/US/390/390.US.629.47.html |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#The Act violates rights protected by the First Amendment because the state has not demonstrated a compelling interest, has not tailored the restriction to its alleged compelling interest, and there exists a less-restrictive means that would further the State's expressed interest.&lt;ref name="Schwarzenegger Ninth"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Video Software Dealers Ass'n v. Schwarzenegger |vol=556 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=950 |pinpoint= |court=9th Cir. |date=2009 |url=http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2009/02/20/0716620.pdf |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#The Act's labeling requirement is unconstitutionally compelled speech under the First Amendment because it does not require the disclosure of purely factual information, but compels the carrying of the State's controversial Opinion.&lt;ref name="Schwarzenegger Ninth" /&gt;

The court first addressed the VSDA's argument that the entire Act should be invalidated based on the defendant's concession on appeal that the definition of "violent video game" in the Act is unconstitutionally broad. However, the statute had a [[severability clause]]&lt;ref name="California Civil Code §&amp;nbsp;1746.5"&gt;California Civil Code §&amp;nbsp;1746.5.&lt;/ref&gt; so the court went through the severability test set forth in ''Hotel Employees &amp; Rest. Employees Int'l Union v. Davis''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Hotel Employees &amp; Rest. Employees Int'l Union v. Superior Court |vol=35 |reporter=Cal. 4th |opinion=935 |pinpoint= |court= |date=2005 |url= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court held that the definition for "violent video game" is grammatically and functionally separable because, as an alternative definition of "violent video game," it can be removed from the Act without affecting the wording or function of the Act's other provisions.&lt;ref name="Schwarzenegger Ninth" /&gt; Further, the definitions are volitionally separable because those sections were not of critical importance to the passage of the Act and the legislative body would have adopted the Act had it foreseen the partial invalidation of the statute.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Sonoma County Org.  of Pub. Employees v. County of Sonoma |vol=23 |reporter=Cal. 3d |opinion=296 |pinpoint= |court= |date=1979 |url= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These definition sections were only included to avoid the possibility that a court would rule the terms unconstitutionally vague; the court found that the legislature would still have enacted the statute without this definition section.&lt;ref name="Schwarzenegger Ninth" /&gt;

The court next went on to determine what level of scrutiny should be applied in reviewing the Act's prohibitions. The defendants insisted that the "variable obscenity" standard from ''Ginsberg v. New York'' should be used.&lt;ref name="Ginsberg" /&gt; However, the court held that the "variable obscenity" standard does not apply to violence. The Court in ''Ginsberg'' was careful to place substantive limits on its holding, and concern in ''Ginsberg'' regarded only "sex material," not violence. The court declined to extend the application of the "variable obscenity" standard to violence, so strict scrutiny was applied instead.&lt;ref name="Schwarzenegger Ninth" /&gt;

In applying the strict scrutiny standard, the court recognized that "content-based regulations are presumptively invalid,"&lt;ref name="bulk.resource.org"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, Minnesota |vol=505 |reporter=U.S. |opinion=377 |pinpoint=382 |court= |date=1992 |url=http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/US/505/505.US.377.90-7675.html |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to survive invalidation, the Act had to fulfill two qualifications:
#Restrictions "must be narrowly tailored to promote a compelling Government interest."
#"If a less restrictive alternative would serve the Government's purpose, the legislature must use that alternative."&lt;ref name="http"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=United States v. Playboy Entm't Group, Inc. |vol=529 |reporter=U.S. |opinion=803 |pinpoint=813 |court= |date=2000 |url=http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/US/529/529.US.803.html |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The court invalidated the statute on both accounts. First, the court said that in considering its decision, the court limited the purpose of the Act to the actual harm to the brain of a child playing a violent video game. As a result, the state was required to show that "the recited harms are real, not merely conjectural, and that the regulation will in fact alleviate these harms in a direct and material way."&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Turner Broad.

Second, the court held that the defendants did not demonstrate the absence of less restrictive alternative means. In fact, video games already comply with a [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|voluntary rating system]] that rates video games based on their topics and age appropriateness. This is a clear example of a less restrictive means. The court noted that the least restrictive means is not the same as the most effective means.&lt;ref name="Schwarzenegger Ninth" /&gt;

The court also evaluated the constitutionality of the Act's labeling provision, which requires that a label be affixed to the front of every package the state deems to be a "violent video game." Generally, "freedom of speech prohibits the government from telling people what they must say."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc. |vol=547 |reporter=U.S. |opinion=47 |pinpoint= |court= |date=2006 |url= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the court has upheld compelled commercial speech where it is the inclusion of "purely factual and uncontroversial information" in advertising.&lt;ref name="Zaruder v 2166"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Zaruder v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel |vol=471 |reporter=U.S. |opinion=626 |pinpoint= |court= |date=2985 |url=http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/US/471/471.US.626.83-2166.html |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the labeling requirement of "violent video game" is not factual information. The Act has not clearly and legally provided a way to determine if a video game is violent so the sticker does not convey factual information. Consequently, the court found that the Act is unconstitutional.&lt;ref name="Schwarzenegger Ninth" /&gt;

=== Supreme Court appeal ===
[[File:Hansel-and-gretel-rackham.jpg|thumb|upright|Justice Antonin Scalia, along with those supporting the ESA side of the case, questioned whether violent video games should be treated differently from other media with similar violence regularly exposed to minors, such as the fairy tale of [[Hansel and Gretel]].]]
Gov. Schwarzenegger again appealed to the Supreme Court, looking to overturn the Ninth Circuit's ruling, filing a writ of ''[[certiorari]]'' to the Court in May 2009. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case, at this point filed as ''Schwarzenegger v.

== Opinion ==
[[File:Antonin Scalia, SCOTUS photo portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] wrote the majority opinion in the case.]]
On June 27, 2011, the Supreme Court issued a 7–2 opinion striking down the California law as unconstitutional on the basis of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The majority opinion was authored by Justice Antonin Scalia and joined by Justices Ginsburg, Kennedy, Sotomayor, and Kagan.  It first held that "video games qualify for First Amendment protection": 

{{quote|Like the protected books, plays, and movies that preceded them, video games communicate ideas—and even social messages—through many familiar literary devices (such as characters, dialogue, plot, and music) and through features distinctive to the medium (such as the player's interaction with the virtual world).  That suffices to confer First Amendment protection.}}

Justice Scalia then affirmed that, while states may pass laws to block obscene material from minors as previously decided in the 1968 ''[[Ginsberg v. New York]]'' case, "speech about violence is not obscene," and California's statute was unlawful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/06/violent-video-games-scotus/ | title = States May Not Ban Sale, Rental of Violent Videogames to Minors | first = David | last = Kravits | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate = 2011-06-27 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110629093204/http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/06/violent-video-games-scotus/ | archivedate = 2011-06-29 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision pointed to fairy tales like those of the [[Brothers Grimm]], which are regularly given to children to read, "contain no shortage of gore" that are also present in video games.&lt;ref name="forbes decision" /&gt; The decision further compared video games to classical works like ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'', stating that "Even if we can see in them nothing of any possible value to society..., they are as much entitled to the protection of free speech as the best of literature."&lt;ref name="time decision"&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://techland.time.com/2011/06/27/supreme-court-video-games-qualify-for-first-amendment-protection/ | title = Supreme Court: 'Video Games Qualify for First Amendment Protection' | first = Evan | last = Narcisse | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate = 2011-06-27 | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110629183606/http://techland.time.com/2011/06/27/supreme-court-video-games-qualify-for-first-amendment-protection/ | archivedate = 2011-06-29 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scalia's decision also stated that the current self-moderated industry standards like the ESRB are operated effectively to regulate the sale of more mature games to minors, and that "filling the remaining modest gap in concerned-parents' control can hardly be a compelling state interest" requiring a law to enforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ingame.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/06/27/6957472-1st-amendment-beats-ban-in-video-game-battle | title = 1st Amendment beats ban in video game battle | first = Stephen | last = Tolito | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate = 2011-06-27 | publisher = [[MSNBC]] | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120118153215/http://ingame.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/06/27/6957472-1st-amendment-beats-ban-in-video-game-battle | archivedate=2012-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Court's decision also determined that from the evidence, there was no "compelling" link between violent video games and its effects on children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gazJYGtwgygMOKo0UkFFbt2IQ41g?docId=CNG.8685d6a6040541cc62b1b2322b148bc7.681 | title = Top US court zaps violent videogame sales ban | work = [[Agence France-Presse]] | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate = 2011-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision cited one medical report that asserted that cartoons like ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' generate the same effects in children as in games like ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' or imagery of guns.&lt;ref name="forbes decision" /&gt;

=== Alito's concurrence ===
Justice [[Samuel Alito]] wrote a separate [[concurring opinion|concurrence]] supporting the majority decision, and was joined by Chief Justice [[John Roberts]]. Though Alito agreed with the constitutional application to the California law, believing that its "threshold requirement" that guides what material would be covered by the law was too broad, he questioned the potential [[double standard]] that existed between violence and sexual content in regards to this threshold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2011/06/puritans-and-lady-godiva-why-two-justices-voted-to-uphold-californias-video-game-law.ars | title = Puritans and Lady Godiva: why two justices voted to uphold California's video game law | first = Nate | last = Anderson | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate = 2011-06-27 | publisher = [[Ars Technica]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110628215548/http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2011/06/puritans-and-lady-godiva-why-two-justices-voted-to-uphold-californias-video-game-law.ars | archivedate = 2011-06-28 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alito wrote that he was unsure that there was no connection between violent video games and effects on children, stating that "There are reasons to suspect that the experience of playing violent video games just might be very different from reading a book, listening to the radio, or watching a movie or a television show," referencing the book '' Infinite Reality '' which highlights the psychological effects of virtual reality, and argued that the decision "would not squelch legislative efforts to deal with what is perceived by some to be a significant and developing social problem."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/35463/Supreme_Court_Decision_Alito_Expresses_Uncertainty_About_Violent_Games_Effects.php | title = Supreme Court Decision: Alito Expresses Uncertainty About Violent Games' Effects | first = Kris | last = Graft | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate = 2011-06-27 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110702003152/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/35463/Supreme_Court_Decision_Alito_Expresses_Uncertainty_About_Violent_Games_Effects.php | archivedate = 2011-07-02 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dissents ===
Justices [[Clarence Thomas]] and [[Stephen Breyer]] dissented, each authoring a separate dissent. Justice Thomas, in his dissent, considered that historically, the Founding Fathers "believed parents to have complete authority over their minor children and expected parents to direct the development of those children," and that the intent of the First Amendment "does not include a right to speak to minors (or a right of minors to access speech) without going through the minors' parents or guardians."&lt;ref name="gamasutra dissent"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/35471/Supreme_Court_Decision_The_Dissenters_Side.php | title = Supreme Court Decision: The Dissenters' Side | first = Kris | last = Graft | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate = 2011-06-27 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110629115001/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/35471/Supreme_Court_Decision_The_Dissenters_Side.php | archivedate = 2011-06-29 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnet decision" /&gt;

Breyer wrote separately, concerned that the majority's decision conflicts with previous rulings from ''Ginsberg'' and ''Miller''. He contrasted the previous findings regulating sales of publications containing nudity to those of violent video games: "But what sense does it make to forbid selling to a 13-year-old boy a magazine with an image of a nude woman, while protecting a sale to that 13 year-old of an interactive video game in which he actively, but virtually, binds and gags the woman, then tortures and kills her?"&lt;ref name="gamasutra dissent" /&gt; Breyer further argued that "This case is ultimately less about censorship than it is about education," believing that the Government has a vested interest in allowing parents to make decisions for their child as to "raise future generations committed cooperatively to making our system of government work," and that "California's law imposes no more than a modest restriction on expression."&lt;ref name="gamasutra dissent" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cnet decision"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.cnet.com/8301-31921_3-20074680-281/u.s-supreme-court-strikes-down-violent-video-game-law/ | title = U.S. Supreme Court strikes down violent video game law | first =Declan | last = McCullagh | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate = 2011-06-27 | publisher = [[CNet]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Breyer also expressed concern that the self-regulation of the industry still allowed for 20% of minors to purchase mature video games on a national average, and as high as 50% in the case of one nationwide chain, based on the aforementioned 2011 [[Federal Trade Commission]] study.&lt;ref name="gamasutra dissent" /&gt;

== Reactions ==
The ruling was praised by the video game industry, which had expected the law to be ruled unconstitutional, but sought affirmation by the Court. ESA's CEO, Michael Gallagher, responded that "The Court declared forcefully that content-based restrictions on games are unconstitutional; and that parents, not government bureaucrats, have the right to decide what is appropriate for their children."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/35461/Video_Game_Industry_Celebrates_Supreme_Court_Victory.php | title = Video Game Industry Celebrates Supreme Court Victory | first = Frank | last = Cifaldi | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate = 2011-06-27 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110630223419/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/35461/Video_Game_Industry_Celebrates_Supreme_Court_Victory.php | archivedate = 2011-06-30 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bo Anderson of the EMA stated that "there now can be no argument whether video games are entitled to the same protection as books, movies, music, and other expressive entertainment," while Electronic Arts' (former) CEO [[John Riccitiello]] asserted that the decision "affirmed the constitutional rights of game developers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2011/06/27/business-technology-hardware-amp-equipment-us-video-games-sector-snap_8537172.html | title = Sector Snap: Game cos. cheer Supreme Court ruling | work = [[Associated Press]] | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate  =2011-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other entertainment industries, such as the Motion Picture Association of America, also showed support for the Court's decision.  Former U.S. Senator and current head of the Association [[Chris Dodd]] recognized that the motion picture industry has seen similar attempts to limit its freedom of expression, and that "We applaud the Supreme Court for recognizing the far-reaching First-Amendment implications posed by the California law."&lt;ref name="ew reactions"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://popwatch.ew.com/2011/06/27/supreme-court-video-game-violence/ | title = Supreme Court rules against law restricting video game violence | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | first = Jeff | last = Labrecque | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate = 2011-06-27 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110630082722/http://popwatch.ew.com/2011/06/27/supreme-court-video-game-violence/ | archivedate = 2011-06-30 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Groups that supported the California law were critical of the decision. California State Senator Leland Yee was very critical of the decision, claiming that "It is simply wrong that the video game industry can be allowed to put their profit margins over the rights of parents and the well-being of children."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://content.usatoday.com/communities/gamehunters/post/2011/06/author-of-violent-video-games-law-blasts-supreme-court-decision/1 | title = Author of violent video games law blasts Supreme Court decision | first = Brett | last = Molina | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate = 2011-06-27 | work = [[USA Today]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yee stated he would review the opinions and attempt to reintroduce a new bill within the constitutionality of the decision, and claimed it was "disappointing the court didn't understand just how violent these games are."&lt;ref name="forbes decision"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2011/06/27/entertainment-us-supreme-court-violent-video-games_8537064.html | title = Court overturns ban on video game sales to kids | first = Jesse | last = Holland | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate =2011-06-27 | work = [[Forbes]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; James Steyer of [[Common Sense Media]] also criticized the decision, citing that "If parents decide a violent game is okay for their kid, that's one thing, but millions of kids are not able to judge the impact of ultra-violence on their own."&lt;ref name="gamasutra decision analysis"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/35473/Analysis_Despite_Ruling_Threats_Remain_For_The_Games_Industry.php | title = Analysis: Despite Ruling, Threats Remain For The Games Industry | first = Chris | last = Morris | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate = 2011-06-27 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110629094614/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/35473/Analysis_Despite_Ruling_Threats_Remain_For_The_Games_Industry.php | archivedate = 2011-06-29 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Schlafly|Andy Schlafly]], who had submitted a brief to the court on behalf of the Eagle Forum and Legal Defense Fund, heavily criticized the majority opinion, believing that "the court's latest disregard of parental rights is on a crash course with technological advances."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2011-06-27-Violent-videos-warp-young-minds_n.htm | title = Opposing view: Violent videos warp young minds | first = Andy | last = Schlafly | work = [[USA Today]] | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate = 2011-06-27 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110701113428/http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2011-06-27-Violent-videos-warp-young-minds_n.htm | archivedate = 2011-07-01 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tim Winter of the [[Parents Television Council]] asserted that the Court's decision "replaces the authority of parents with the economic interests of the video game industry."&lt;ref name="ew reactions" /&gt; The ''[[Washington Post]]'' opined that the California law "did nothing to infringe on the rights of adults" while dealing with "reasonable limitations on minors' access to extremely violent games that even the video game industry acknowledges are inappropriate," and that with the high bar for any future legislation, the onus is on the video game industry to maintain its self-policing of video game sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-high-courts-misguided-decision-on-violent-video-games/2011/06/27/AGilYDoH_story.html | title = The high court's misguided decision on violent video games | work = [[Washington Post]] | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate = 2011-06-27 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140327221239/http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-high-courts-misguided-decision-on-violent-video-games/2011/06/27/AGilYDoH_story.html | archivedate = 2014-03-27 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysts believed that while this was a major victory for the video game industry, the challenge is not yet over. Dan Offner, a partner for the video game industry analysis firm Loeb &amp; Loeb believed that similar laws and regulations will be sought by State and Federal governments, as "the regulation of mature content with respect to minors as a hot button issue for the Federal Trade Commission and the various state governments."&lt;ref name="gamasutra decision analysis" /&gt; Other analysts cited that as more game content becomes available online as opposed to retail channels, the focus may shift more towards "privacy and security" of children and preventing children from amassing large fees from pay-to-use gaming services, pointing to a $3 million settlement that [[Playdom]] had to pay for violating privacy of its younger users.&lt;ref name="gamasutra decision analysis" /&gt; Sean Bersell of the EMA noted that future debates over violent video games may involve public opinion in addition to new legislation, noting that "Retailers along with publishers and parents all have a role in keeping kids away from these games."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pcworld.com/article/231288/violent_video_game_debate_where_do_we_go_from_here.html | title = Violent Video Game Debate: Where Do We Go From Here? | first = David | last = Daw | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate = 2011-06-27 | work = [[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110628215655/http://www.pcworld.com/article/231288/violent_video_game_debate_where_do_we_go_from_here.html | archivedate = 2011-06-28 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Seth Schiesel of the ''[[New York Times]]'' proposed that the Court's decision should be a challenge to the industry to show that they can mature on the decision that [[video games as an art form|video games are a form of art]], questioning the industry "Will you use it as cover to pump out schlock or will you rise to the opportunity and respectability that has been afforded you?"&lt;ref name="nytimes schiesel"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/29/arts/video-games/what-supreme-court-ruling-on-video-games-means.html | title = Supreme Court Has Ruled; Now Games Have a Duty | work = [[New York Times]] | first = Seth | last = Schiesel | date = 2011-06-28 | accessdate = 2011-06-28 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110701202527/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/29/arts/video-games/what-supreme-court-ruling-on-video-games-means.html | archivedate = 2011-07-01 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Schiesel also considered that even if games with increased interactivity and reality may make the games more dangerous, this could also make the player more aware of the potential consequences of his or her actions, even when such an action is made with the purpose to gain points/level or to kill a "dangerous enemy" in that game.&lt;ref name="nytimes schiesel" /&gt;

In January 2012, the state of California agreed to pay the ESA $950,000 for reimbursing the ESA's legal fees during the Supreme Court trial, atop approximately $350,000 in fees from the previous trials at lower courts.  The ESA stated that it will use an unspecified portion of this money to help create after-school programs in "underserved" communities in the Oakland and Sacramento areas to help teach students job skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/california-paying-950000-for-failed-supreme-court-fight-6349243 |title=California paying $950,000 for failed Supreme Court fight |date=2012-01-26 |accessdate=2012-01-26 |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |first=Eddie |last=Makuch |first2=Brendan |last2=Sinclair |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206095142/http://www.gamespot.com/news/california-paying-950000-for-failed-supreme-court-fight-6349243 |archivedate=2012-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The total cost of defending the case is estimated around $1.8 million, including the State's own legal costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sacbee.com/2012/02/19/4274796/failed-legal-fight-over-video.html |title=Failed legal fight over video games costs California nearly $2 million |first=Jim |last=Sanders |date=2012-02-22 |accessdate=2012-02-22 |work=[[Sacramento Bee]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222015544/http://www.sacbee.com/2012/02/19/4274796/failed-legal-fight-over-video.html |archivedate=2012-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, Kenneth Doroshow and Paul M. Smith, the lawyers for the EMA who argued the case, were presented with the Ambassador Award by the [[International Game Developers Association]] [[Game Developers Choice Awards]]. The Ambassador Award "honors an individual or individuals who have helped the game industry advance to a better place, either through facilitating a better game community from within, or by reaching outside the industry to be an advocate for video games".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last =  | first =  | title = Game Developers Choice Online Awards – Ambassador Award Archive | url = http://www.gamechoiceawards.com/archive/ambassador.html | publisher = UBM Tech | date = March 2012 | accessdate = November 16, 2012 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130202090125/http://www.gamechoiceawards.com/archive/ambassador.html | archivedate = February 2, 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a seminar given in November 2014, Justice [[Elena Kagan]] expressed her thoughts on the decision in this case, noting that for herself, she faced a difficult decision between what she felt was right – allowing parents to decide what their children should watch and play – and what the state of the law was, and in hindsight, was still not sure if they made the right decision. She noted that she along with four others on the  court effectively added language to the decision that would preempt any future laws that attempted to restrict game sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/01/supreme-court-justice-second-guesses-decisive-vote-in-gaming-free-speech-case/ | title = Supreme Court justice second-guesses decisive vote in gaming free speech case | first = Kyle | last = Orland | date = 2015-01-08 | accessdate = 2015-01-08 | publisher = [[Ars Technica]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150108044005/http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/01/supreme-court-justice-second-guesses-decisive-vote-in-gaming-free-speech-case/ | archivedate = 2015-01-08 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mike Gallagher, CEO of the ESA, observed in 2017 that the same [[moral panic]] that led to concerns over video games and resulting in this case were starting to appear for newer video game systems that can further blur lines between the virtual and real world, such as [[virtual reality]], [[augmented reality]], and [[mixed reality]], and anticipates that there will be further tests of the applicability of First Amendment protection these new forms of media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://venturebeat.com/2017/05/02/gaming-beat-the-supreme-court-now-its-time-to-defend-ar-and-vr/ | title = Gaming beat the Supreme Court — now it's time to defend AR and VR | first = Jeff | last = Grubb | date = May 2, 2017 | accessdate = May 2, 2017 | work = [[Venture Beat]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170503002612/https://venturebeat.com/2017/05/02/gaming-beat-the-supreme-court-now-its-time-to-defend-ar-and-vr/ | archivedate = May 3, 2017 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public opinion ===
A national telephone poll conducted in the second quarter of 2011 by [[Fairleigh Dickinson University]]'s [[Fairleigh Dickinson University#PublicMind|PublicMind]] showed that a majority of American voters (57%) agreed that states should have the "right to regulate the sale of video games [that are violent] in order to protect minors; the same way states regulate tobacco, alcohol and pornography." On the other hand, 39% of voters agreed with the Court's majority that "parents should make the decision" about what video games they purchase for their children, and what constitutes "too violent." These voters agreed with the statement "states do not have the right to decide that some video games are too violent for [minors], any more than they have the right to decide what literature or fairy tales are too violent." The poll was conducted before the Court released its decision on June 27, 2011.&lt;ref name="publicmind.fdu.edu"&gt;Fairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind, (June 6, 2011).

===Viscri===
Viscri's population is of [[Roma in Romania|Roma]] majority, with a few [[Romanians]], and about 20 Germans. It lies northwest of [[Rupea]] and can be reached through [[Jibert|Dacia]] on a 7&amp;nbsp;km unpaved road. The village is best known for the highly fortified [[Viscri fortified church]], originally built around 1100. It is part of the [[Saxon villages with fortified churches in Transylvania|villages with fortified churches in Transylvania]], designated in 1993 as a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]]. The first documentation of Viscri is a record of church taxes dated around 1400, in which the village is referred to as being part of the Rupea parish. Its inhabitants consisted of 51 farmers, 1 school master, 3 shepherds and 2 paupers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mihaieminescutrust.org/content/nd_village.asp?n=102# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-02-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081018211031/http://www.mihaieminescutrust.org/content/nd_village.asp?n=102# |archive-date=2008-10-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of the fortified church date from 1100 when the [[Székelys]] built a small church with a single hall and semicircular [[apse]]. Around 1185 the church was taken over by Saxon colonists, and the Székelys were forced to settle further north. In the 14th century the eastern part of the church was rebuilt and in 1525, the first fortifications with towers were added. In the 18th century the church was surrounded by a second defense wall. After 1743 a covered corridor for the storage of corn was built.  A century later, two chambers in the defense corridor of the bastion were turned into school rooms. The classic 19th-century altar has as centerpiece "the Blessing of the Children" by the painter J. Paukratz from Rupea. The font was made from a capital of the 13th-century church. To this day, the church is surrounded by a cemetery with gravestones dating back to the "[[Bijelo Brdo culture]]".

In 2006, The [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]] bought and restored two 18th century Saxon houses in the Transylvanian villages of [[Mălâncrav]] and Viscri to help protect the unique way of life that has existed for hundreds of years and promote sustainable tourism. The buildings have been sensitively restored and converted into guesthouses for tourists. They remain in keeping with the surrounding architecture and feature a number of Transylvanian antiques but with modern facilities where possible. The renovation of these buildings has helped provide a sustainable future for the people of rural Transylvania while also enabling residents to maintain their traditional way of life.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/newsandgallery/focus/the_prince_of_wales_s_properties_in_romania_1484339285.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cathedral of Saint Domnius''' ({{lang-hr|Katedrala Svetog Duje}}), known locally as the ''Sveti Dujam'' or colloquially ''Sveti Duje'', is the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[cathedral]] in  [[Split, Croatia|Split]], [[Croatia]].  The cathedral is the seat of the [[Archdiocese of Split-Makarska]], headed by [[Archbishop]] Marin Barišić.  The Cathedral of St. Domnius is a complex of a church, formed from an Imperial Roman [[mausoleum]], with a [[bell tower]]; strictly the church is dedicated to the [[Virgin Mary]], and the bell tower to [[Saint Domnius]]. Together they form the Cathedral of St. Domnius.

The Cathedral of [[Saint Domnius]], consecrated at the turn of the 7th century AD, is regarded as the oldest Catholic cathedral in the world that remains in use in its original structure, without near-complete renovation at a later date (though the bell tower dates from the 12th century). The structure itself, built in AD 305 as the Mausoleum of [[Diocletian]], is the second oldest structure used by any Christian Cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glas-koncila.hr/index.php?option=com_php&amp;Itemid=144&amp;news_ID=3629 Papa u Splitu i Solinu – kolijevci hrvatskog kršćanstva i državnosti] {{Hr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slobodnadalmacija.hr/Split/tabid/72/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/79265/Default.aspx Najstarija katedrala na svijetu] {{Hr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- {{location map|Croatia|label=Cathedral of St. Domnius|float=left|lat=43.5081|long=16.4403}}--&gt;

==Name==
The cathedral was named after [[Saint Domnius]]{{citation needed|reason=Oficcial name of cathedral is Cathedral of Ascension of the Blessed Virgin Mary|date=January 2017}} (''Saint Dujam'', or ''Saint Domnius'') [[patron saint]] of Split, who was a 3rd-century [[Bishop of Salona]]. [[Salona]] was a large [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] city serving as capital of the [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Province of Dalmatia]]. Today it is located near the city of [[Solin, Croatia|Solin]] in [[Croatia]]. Saint Domnius was martyred with seven other [[Christians]] in the persecutions of the Emperor [[Diocletian]]. He was born in [[Antioch]], in modern-day [[Turkey]], and beheaded in 304 at Salona.

==Architecture==
[[File:SPLIT-Mausoleum 1912.jpg|230px|thumb|left|Cathedral section.]]
[[Diocletian's Palace]] ({{lang-hr|Dioklecijanova palača}}) is a building in the centre of Split, built for the Emperor Diocletian (a native of Dalmatia) at the turn of the 4th century. On the intersection of two main roads, [[cardo]] and [[Decumanus Maximus|decumanus]], there is a monumental court [[Peristyle]], from which the only access to Cathedral of St. Domnius is to the east. 

The Cathedral of St. Domnius is composed of three different sections of different ages. The main part is [[Diocletian's Palace|Emperor Diocletian's mausoleum]], which dates from the end of the 3rd century. The mausoleum was built like the rest of the [[palace]] with white local [[limestone]] and [[marble]] of high quality, most of which was from marble quarries on the island of [[Brač]], with [[tuff]] taken from the nearby river [[Jadro]] beds, and with brick made in [[Salona|Salonitan]] and other factories. 

Later, in the 17th century a [[choir (architecture)|choir]] was added to the eastern side of the mausoleum. For that purpose the eastern wall of the mausoleum was torn down in order to unify the two chambers.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Williams, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9il6P3TPj-AC&amp;pg=PA200&amp;dq=%22+St.+Duje+%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6TGJTNa0JsnZ4wa54_XRBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22%20St.%20Duje%20%22&amp;f=false ''Diocletian and the Roman recovery''], pg. 200, Taylor &amp; Francis, Inc. (1996), {{ISBN|0-415-91827-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Bell tower|Bell Tower]] was constructed in the year 1100 AD, in the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style. Extensive rebuilding in 1908 radically changed the Bell Tower, and many of the original [[Romanesque sculpture]]s were removed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gripe.hr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=183&amp;Itemid=132 Kampanel St. Domnius] {{hr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the best examples of [[Romanesque sculpture]] in Croatia, are the wooden doors on Cathedral of St. Domnius. They were made by the [[medieval]] [[Croatia]]n sculptor and painter [[Andrija Buvina]] around 1220. Two wings of the Buvina wooden door contains 14 scenes from the life of [[Jesus Christ]], separated by rich ornaments in wood.

==Treasury==
On the first floor of the sacristy is the [[cathedral treasury]], which contains relics of Saint Domnius, which were brought to cathedral after his death.

Other treasures include [[Sacred|sacral]] art works, like the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] ''The Madonna and Child'' [[panel painting]] from the 13th century,&lt;ref&gt;Naklada Naprijed, ''The Croatian Adriatic Tourist Guide'', pg. 237, Zagreb (1999), {{ISBN|953-178-097-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; objects like chalices and reliquaries by [[goldsmith]]s from the 13th to the 19th century, and mass vestments from the 14th till 19th century. It also contains famous books like the ''Book of gospels'' (''Splitski Evandelistar'') from the 6th century, the ''[[Supetar cartulary]]'' (''Kartularium'' from Sumpetar)  from the 11th century, and the ''Historia Salonitana'' (The History of the people of Salona) by [[Thomas the Archdeacon]] from Split in the 13th century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3323">'''Chicano/Latino Film Forum''' was an association of Latino filmmakers, students, academics, and audience members that was active in the [[Austin, Texas]] area from 1993 to 1999.

The original co-founders of the ''Chicano/Latino Film Forum'' were Alex Avila [http://alexavila.wikispaces.com/], Cristina Ibarra [https://web.archive.org/web/20110112063128/http://www.undocumentedfilms.com/producer.html], and Rene Renteria [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1972794/]. The original purpose of the organization was to promote Latino filmmaking and to bring filmmakers and audiences together on a regular basis to view media projects largely unavailable to an audience hungry for such programming.&lt;ref&gt;Austin American-Statesman (02/05/1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

Seldom were films programmed for audience screening without the presence of at least one of the principal filmmakers. Over the course of the life of the project, the ''Chicano/Latino Film Forum'' presented the works of such film personalities as Carlos Avila, [[Jesse Borrego]], Hector Galan, Nancy de los Santos, Efraim Gutierrez, and many others.  

In 1996, co-founder Cristina Ibarra left the group and named Sandra Guardado [https://web.archive.org/web/20110713235549/http://www.luchadoraproductions.com/] as her replacement as a co-director with Avila and Renteria.

The ''Chicano/Latino Film Forum'' was active at a time when Austin was emerging as a viable independent, regional film scene thanks to the success of such Austin-based filmmakers as [[Richard Linklater]] ("Slacker" and "Dazed and Confused") and [[Robert Rodriguez]] ("El Mariachi").&lt;ref name="Wilis"&gt;Daily Variety, July 30, 1999 (Holly Willis)&lt;/ref&gt; Other Austin-based film organizations that emerged at the time include the [[Austin Film Society]], Reel Women, Austin Filmworks, and the Austin Cinemaker Co-Op.&lt;ref name="Wilis"/&gt; From its inception, the directors reached out to other filmmaking communities and Latino festivals. The ''Chicano/Latino Film Forum'' provided judges for the first ever [[South by Southwest|South By Southwest]] Film Festival.  And group members helped to program some aspects of other Latino film festivals such as CineFestival in San Antonio [https://web.archive.org/web/20080727003351/http://www.guadalupeculturalarts.org/mediaarts.htm], CineSol in the South Texas Valley [http://www.cinesol.com/], and Cine Las Americas [http://www.cinelasamericas.org/] in Austin.&lt;ref&gt;Austin American-Statesman (Texas)April 24, 1998, p. E1&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1999, the emergence of viable web video, and the growth of [http://cinelasamericas.org/ Cine Las Americas], a locally based Latin American Film Festival, (mostly Latin American imports) made the need for the Chicano/Latino Film Festival less imperative and the volunteer directors quietly dissolved the group.

==Plot==
Zamindar Koteswara Rao (Tyagaraju) and his wife Janaki Devi (Savitri) belong to the royal family but do not have the heir. Zamindar's brother-in-law Bhaskar Rao (Rao Gopal Rao), a cruel person, looks after the estate affairs and waits for an opportunity to grab the property. Happiness arises to all when Janaki Devi becomes pregnant, but Bhaskara Rao becomes jittery. He arranges for his men to kill the baby immediately after birth to remove his hindrance. The baby is protected by circus elephants and circus owner Chalapathi Rao (Allu Ramalingaiah) rears him by the name Ramu. But Janaki Devi delivers twins and the second child is named Raja. After some time, Bhaskar Rao's wife Tayaramma (Jhansi) gives birth to a baby girl Jaya and Bhaskar Rao plots a plan to make Raja's marriage with Jaya to fulfill his ambition. Years roll by, Raja (N. T. Rama Rao) becomes young and energetic, Jaya (Jaya Prada) also grows up along with him; both are good friends. Everyone wants them to marriy, but they do not have such an intention. Yugandhar (Prabhakar Reddy), personal lawyer to Zamindar, is a most efficient and loyal person who keeps check on Bhaskar Rao. Raja has good qualities, except he is habituated to alcohol due to the bad guidance of Bhaskar Rao. Once in a drunken state, he causes an accident and a person dies. Moving forward, he hits a tree and he gets injured and collapses. A woman, Ankamma (Sujatha) protects him, after recovery he sees the person whom he killed is Ankamma's father. Jaya scolds him and he gives up all his bad habits. Now Raja is burning out of contrition and wants to make penance for his sin. He goes to Ankamma, reveals the truth, asks her to punish him, but she forgives him. He starts loving her and decides to marry her. Zamindar does not agree to this match, so, he marries Ankamma in the temple in the presence of people of her village. Knowing this, Bhaskara Rao causes an accident to Raja, by which he loses his memory and becomes mad. Bhaskar Rao gives false information to Zamindar that Raja is dead and he dies of a heart attack. Bhaskar Rao hides Raja in a secret place and says that he has sent him to the USA for treatment.

[[File:Body measures SVG.svg|lang=english|thumb|right|Some examples of body measurements used for sizing of clothes.]]
In [[clothing]], '''clothing size''' refers to the label sizes used for garments sold [[Ready-to-wear|off-the-shelf]]. There are a  large number of standard sizing systems around the world for various garments, such as [[Dress (garment)|dresses]], tops, [[skirt]]s, and [[trousers]]. Made-to-order garments require measurements to be taken, but these do not need to be converted into national standard form.

There are three approaches for size-labelling of clothes:
* '''Body dimensions''': The label states the range of body measurements for which the product was designed. (For example: bike helmet label stating "head girth: 56–60 cm")
* '''Product dimensions''': The label states characteristic dimensions of the product. (For example: jeans label stating inner leg length of the jeans in centimetres or inches (not inner leg measurement of the intended wearer))
* '''Ad hoc sizes''': The label states a size number or code with no obvious relationship to any measurement. (For example: Size 12, XL)

Traditionally, clothes have been labelled using many different ad hoc size systems, which has resulted in varying sizing methods between different manufacturers made for different countries due to changing demographics and increasing rates of obesity, a phenomenon known as [[vanity sizing]]. This results in country-specific and vendor-specific labels incurring additional costs, and can make internet or mail order difficult. Some new standards for clothing sizes being developed are therefore based on body-dimensions, such as the [[EN 13402]] "Size designation of clothes".

== History of standard clothing sizes ==
Before the invention of clothing sizes in the early 1800s, all clothing was made to fit individuals by either tailors 
or makers of clothing in their homes. Then garment makers noticed that the range of human body dimensions was relatively small. Therefore, sizes were invented to
* '''Horizontal torso measurements''' include the neck circumference, the shoulder width, the [[bustline|bustline measurements]] – over-bust circumference, the full bust circumference, the bust-point separation, and the under-bust (rib-cage) circumference – the natural [[waistline (clothing)|waist circumference]], the upper hip circumference and the lower hip circumference. 
* '''Vertical torso measurements''' include the back (neck-waist) length, the shoulder-waist length (not the same as the back length, due to the slope of the shoulder), the bust-shoulder length, the bust-waist length, and the two hip-waist lengths.
*  '''Sleeve measurements''' include the under-arm and over-arm lengths, the fore-arm length, the wrist circumference and the biceps circumference.

However, because of the [[drape]] and ease of the fabric, not all measurements are required to obtain a well-fitting apparel in most styles.

== Standards ==

There are several [[ISO standard]]s for ''size designation of clothes'', but most have them are being revised and replaced by one of the parts of ISO 8559 which closely resembles European Standard [[EN 13402]]:

* EN 13402-2: Primary and secondary dimensions
* EN 13402-3: Size designation of clothes. Body measurements and interng national standards of the 33 member states.  It is currently in common use for children's clothing, but not yet for adults. The third standard [[EN 13402]]-3 seeks to address the problem of irregular or [[Vanity sizing]] through offering a [[International System of Units|SI unit]] based labelling system, which will ALSO pictographically describe the dimensions a garment is designed to fit, per the ISO 3635 standard.

* BS 6185:1982 Specification for size designation of men's wear
BS 3666:1982, the standard for women's clothing, is rarely followed by manufacturers as it defines sizes in terms of hip and bust measurements only within a limited range. This has resulted in variations between manufacturers and a tendency towards [[vanity sizing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Clifford| first = Stephanie| title = One Size Fits Nobody: Seeking a Steady 4 or a 10| accessdate = 2017-06-14| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/25/business/25sizing.html?nytmobile=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Former Yugoslavia ====
Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia and Serbia still use the JUS (F.G0.001 1979, F.G0.002 1979, F.G0.003 1979) standards developed in the former [[Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ujevi|first1=Darko|last2=Szirovicza|first2=Lajos|last3=Karabegovi|first3=Isak|title=Anthropometry and the Comparison of Garment Size Systems in Some European Countries|date=2005|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to typical girth measurements clothing is also marked to identify which of 5 height bands: X-Short, Short, Medium, Tall, X-Tall, and body types: Slim, Normal, or Full, it is designed to fit.

There is no mandatory clothing size or labeling standard in the U.S, though a series of voluntary standards have been in place since the 1930s. The U.S. government, however, did attempt to establish a system for women's clothing in 1958 when the National Bureau of Standards published "Body Measurements for the Sizing of Women's Patterns and Apparel." The guidelines of the book was made a commercial standard and was even updated in 1970. But the guide was eventually degraded to a voluntary standard until it was abolished altogether in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/08/11/the-absurdity-of-womens-clothing-sizes-in-one-chart/|title=The absurdity of women’s clothing sizes, in one chart|last=Ingraham|first=Christopher|date=2015-08-11|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Private organization [[ASTM International]] started to release its own recommended size carts in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/3532014/women-clothing-sizes-history/|title=When — And Why — We Started Measuring Women's Clothing|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, the common US misses sizes have not had stable dimensions.  Clothing brands and manufacturers size their products according to their preferences.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, the dimensions of two size 10 dresses from different companies, or even from the ''same'' company, may have grossly different dimensions; and both are almost certainly larger than the size 10 dimensions described in the [[US standard clothing size|US standard]].  [[Vanity sizing]] may be partly responsible for this deviation (which began in earnest in the 1980s).

e.g.  a dress marked '''13-Y-PP''' or '''13-Y-P''' would be designed for someone with an 89&amp;nbsp;cm bust and 89&amp;nbsp;cm hips, while a dress marked '''13-B-T''' would be targeted at a taller individual with 105&amp;nbsp;cm hips, but the same 89&amp;nbsp;cm bust. The B fitting adds 12&amp;nbsp;cm and the T height modifier 4&amp;nbsp;cm to the base hip measurement 89 + 16 = 105&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Japanese Size Charts|url=http://web.ita.doc.gov/tacgi/overseasnew.nsf/annexview/Japanese+Size+Charts|website=International Trade Administration|publisher=JIS|accessdate=2014-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally there are a set of age based waist adjustments, such that a dress marketed at someone in their 60s may allow for a waist 9&amp;nbsp;cm larger than a dress, of the same size, marketed at someone in their 20s. The age based adjustments allow for up to a 3&amp;nbsp;cm increase in girth, per decade of life.

=== Italian sizes (ITA) ===
Dress sizes are calculated as follows: 
* Standard dress size = (Bust Circumference cm / 2)

=== French sizes (FRA/BEL) ===
Dress sizes are calculated as follows: 
* Standard dress size = (Bust Circumference cm / 2) - 4

=== Germanic sizes (DE/AT/NL/SE/DK) ===
Dress sizes are calculated as follows: 
* Standard dress size (Height 164–170&amp;nbsp;cm) = (Bust Circumference cm / 2 ) - 6
* Short dress sizes (Height &lt;164&amp;nbsp;cm) = Standard dress size / 2
* Tall dress sizes (Height &gt;170&amp;nbsp;cm) = Standard dress size * 2

== Size dividers ==
Size dividers are used by clothing stores to help customers find the right size.  Like [[index card]]s, they are found on racks between sizes.  There are three basic types: the rectangular, round and the king size. Among the stores that use them are [[Marshalls]] and [[TJ Maxx]].

The '''Dabous Giraffes''' are a [[neolithic]] [[petroglyph]] by an unknown artist. Completed between 9000 BC and 5000 BC, the giraffe carvings were first documented by David Coulson in 1997 while on a photographic expedition at a site in [[Niger]], [[Africa]].

The carving is 20 feet in height and consists of two giraffes carved into the ''Dabous Rock'' with a great amount of detail. Dabous Rock is located on the sloping slope of a small rocky outcropping of sandstone in the first foothills of the Air Mountains. One of the giraffes is male, while the other, smaller, is female.

In the surroundings 828 images have been found engraved on the rocks, of which 704 are animals (bovidae, giraffes, ostriches, antelopes, lions, rincerontes and camels), 61 are human and 159 are indeterminate.

The Bradshaw Foundation is an organization dedicated to the protection and preservation of this petroglyph.

{{French art history}}
&lt;!-- For practical purposes, the history of French art has been divided into a series of separate articles accessible through the template to the right. The template also gives direct access to French art category indexes, such as alphabetical lists of painters or sculptors. To locate artists from a particular period or art movement, the relatively comprehensive manual list of painters and artistic movements in chronological order is recommended. In addition to a brief historic overview, some supplementary or general material is included on this page, including art vocabulary and general French art references.--&gt;

'''French art''' consists of the [[visual arts|visual]] and [[plastic arts]] (including architecture, woodwork, textiles, and ceramics) originating from the geographical area of [[France]]. Modern France was the main centre for the European [[art of the Upper Paleolithic]], then left many [[megalith]]ic monuments, and in the [[Iron Age]] many of the most impressive finds of early [[Celtic art]]. The [[Gallo-Roman]] period left a distinctive provincial style of sculpture, and the region around the modern Franco-German border led the empire in the mass production of finely decorated [[Ancient Roman pottery]], which was exported to Italy and elsewhere on a large scale.  With [[Merovingian art]] the story of French styles as a distinct and influential element in the wider development of the art of Christian Europe begins.  

France can fairly be said to have been a leader in the development of [[Romanesque art]] and [[Gothic art]], before the [[Italian Renaissance|Renaissance]] led to Italy becoming the main source of stylistic developments until France matched Italy's influence during the [[Rococo]] and [[Neoclassicism]] periods and then regained the leading role in the Arts from the 19th to the mid-20th century.

==Historic overview==

===Prehistory===

Currently, the earliest known European art is from the [[Upper Palaeolithic]] period of between 40,000 and 10,000 years ago and France has a large selection of extant [[pre-historic art]] from the [[Châtelperronian]], [[Aurignacian]], [[Solutrean]], [[Gravettian]], and [[Magdalenian]] cultures. This art includes [[cave painting]]s, such as the famous paintings at [[Pech Merle]] in the [[Lot (département)|Lot]] in [[Languedoc]] which date back to 16,000 BC, [[Lascaux]], located near the village of [[Montignac, Dordogne|Montignac]], in the [[Dordogne]], dating back to between 13,000 and 15,000 BC, or perhaps, as far back as 25,000 BC, the [[Cosquer Cave]], the [[Chauvet Cave]] dating back to 29,000 BC, and the [[Trois-Frères|Trois-Frères cave]]; and [[portable art]], such as animal carvings and great goddess statuettes called [[Venus figurines]], such as the "[https://web.archive.org/web/20060904222320/http://www.musee-antiquitesnationales.fr/pages/page_id18159_u1l2.htm Venus of Brassempouy]" of 21,000 BC, discovered in the [[Landes (department)|Landes]], now in the museum at the [[Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye]] or the [[Venus of Lespugue]] at the [[Musée de l'Homme]]. Ornamental beads, bone pins, carvings, as well as flint and stone [[arrowhead]]s also are among the prehistoric objects from the area of France.

Speculations exist that only [[Homo sapiens]] are capable of artistic expression, however, a recent find, [[the Mask of La Roche-Cotard]]—a [[Mousterian]] or [[Neanderthal]] artifact, found in 2002 in a cave near the banks of the [[Loire River]], dating back to about [[Paleolithic|33,000 B.C.]]—now suggests that Neanderthal humans may have developed a sophisticated and complex artistic tradition.

[[File:Carnac megalith alignment 1.jpg|right|thumb|200px|''The Menec alignments'', the most well-known megalithic site among the Carnac stones]]

In the [[Neolithic]] period (''see'' [[Neolithic Europe]]), [[megalith]]ic (large stone) monuments, such as the [[dolmen]]s and [[menhir]]s at [[Carnac stones|Carnac]], [[Saint-Sulpice-de-Faleyrens]] and elsewhere in France begin to appear; this appearance is thought to start in the fifth millennium BC, although some authors speculate about [[Mesolithic]] roots. In France there are some 5,000 megalithics monuments, mainly in Brittany, where there is the largest concentration of these monuments. In this area there is wide variety of these monuments that have been well preserved, like menhirs, dolmen, cromlechs and cairns. The [[Gavrinis|Cairn of Gavrinis]] in southern Brittany is an outstanding example of megalithic art : its 14 meters inner corridor is nearly completely adorned with ornamental carvings. The [[Broken Menhir of Er Grah|great broken menhir of Er-Grah]], now in four pieces was more than 20 meters high originally, making it the largest menhir ever erected. France has also numerous painted stones, polished stone axes, and inscribed menhirs from this period. The Grand-Pressigny area was known for its precious silex blades and they were extensively exported during the Neolithic.

In France from the Neolithic to the [[Bronze Age]], one finds a variety of archaeological cultures, including the [[Rössen culture]] of c. 4500–4000 BC, [[Beaker culture]] of c. 2800–1900 BC, [[Tumulus culture]] of c. 1600–1200 BC, [[Urnfield culture]] of c. 1300–800 BC, and, in a transition to the [[Iron Age]], [[Hallstatt culture]] of c. 1200–500 BC.

===Celtic and Roman periods===
[[File:Parade helmet.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Agris Helmet]]]]
From the [[Proto-Celtic]] Urnfield and Hallstat cultures, a continental [[Iron age]] [[Celtic art]] developed; mainly associated with [[La Tène culture]], which flourished during the late Iron Age from 450 BC to the Roman conquest in the first century BC. This art drew on native, classical and perhaps, the [[Mediterranean]], oriental sources. The Celts of [[Gaul]] are known through numerous tombs and burial mounds found throughout France.

Celtic art is very ornamental, avoiding straight lines and only occasionally using symmetry, without the imitation of nature nor ideal of beauty central to the [[Classicism|classical]] tradition, but apparently, often involves complex symbolism. This artwork includes a variety of styles and often incorporates subtly modified elements from other cultures, an example being the characteristic over-and-under interlacing which arrived in France only in the sixth century, although it was already used by [[Germany|Germanic]] artists. The Celtic [[Vix Grave|Vix grave]] in present-day Burgundy revealed the largest bronze crater of the Antiquity, that was probably imported by Celtic aristocrats from Greece.

[[File:Orange roman theatre.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Théâtre antique d'Orange]]]]
The region of Gaul ({{lang-la|Gallia}}) came under the rule of the [[Roman Empire]] from the first century BC to the fifth century AD. Southern France, and especially Provence and Languedoc, is known for its many intact Gallo-Roman monuments. [[Lugdunum]], modern Lyon, was at the time of the Roman Empire the largest city outside Italy and gave birth to two Roman Emperors. The city still boasts some Roman remains including a Theater. Monumental works from this period include the [[Théâtre antique d'Orange|amphitheater]] in [[Orange, Vaucluse]], the "[[Maison Carrée]]" at [[Nîmes]] which is one of the best preserved Roman temples in Europe, the city of [[Vienne, Isère|Vienne]] near Lyon, which features an exceptionally well preserved temple (the temple of Augustus and Livia), a circus as well as other remains, the [[Pont du Gard]] [[aqueduct (water supply)|aqueduct]] which is also in an exceptional state of preservation, the Roman cities of [[Glanum]] and [[Vaison-la-Romaine]], two intact Gallo-Roman arenas in [[Arena of Nîmes|Nîmes]] and [[Arles Amphitheatre|Arles]], and the [[Thermes de Cluny|Roman baths]], and the [[Arènes de Lutèce|arena]] of [[Paris]].

===Medieval period===

====Merovingian art====
{{Main|Merovingian art}}
Merovingian art is the art and architecture of the [[Merovingian]] dynasty of the [[Franks]], which lasted from the fifth century to the eighth century in present-day France and [[Germany]]. The advent of the Merovingian dynasty in [[Gaul]] during the fifth century led to important changes in the arts. In architecture, there was no longer the desire to build robust and harmonious buildings. Sculpture regressed to being little more than a simple technique for the ornamentation of [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]], [[altars]], and ecclesiastical furniture. On the other hand, the rise of [[goldsmith|gold work]] and [[Illuminated manuscript|manuscript illumination]] brought about a resurgence of [[Celt]]ic decoration, which, with [[Christian]] and other contributions, constitutes the basis of Merovingian art. The unification of the [[Franks|Frankish]] kingdom under [[Clovis I]] (465–511) and his successors, corresponded with the need to build churches. The plans for them probably were copied from [[Roman architecture|Roman]] [[basilica]]s. Unfortunately, these timber structures have not survived because of destruction by fire, whether accidental or caused by the [[Normans]] at the time of their incursions.

====Carolingian art====
{{Main|Carolingian art}}
[[File:Karolingischer Buchmaler um 820 001.jpg|thumb|Aachen Gospels, c. 820, an example of Carolingian [[Illuminated manuscript|illumination]]]]
Carolingian art is the approximate 120-year period from 750 to 900—during the reign of [[Charles Martel]], [[Pippin the Younger]], [[Charlemagne]], and his immediate heirs—popularly known as the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]. The Carolingian era is the first period of the Medieval art movement known as '''[[Pre-Romanesque art|Pre-Romanesque]]'''. For the first time, Northern European kings patronized classical Mediterranean Roman art forms, blending classical forms with Germanic ones, creating entirely new innovations in figurine line drawing, and setting the stage for the rise of [[Romanesque art]] and, eventually, [[Gothic art]] in the West.

Illuminated manuscripts, metalwork, small-scale sculpture, mosaics, and frescos survive from the period. The Carolingians also undertook major architectural building campaigns at numerous churches in France. These include, those of [[Metz]], [[Lyon]], [[Vienne]], [[Le Mans]], [[Reims]], [[Beauvais]], [[Verdun]], [[Saint-Germain in Auxerre]], Saint-Pierre in [[Flavigny Abbey|Flavigny]], and [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]], as well as the town center of [[Chartres]]. The [[Centula Abbey]] of [[Saint-Riquier]] ([[Somme (department)|Somme]]), completed in 788, was a major achievement in monastic architecture. Another important building (mostly lost today) was "Theodulf's Villa" in [[Germigny-des-Prés]].

With the end of Carolingian rule around 900, artistic production halted for almost three generations. After the demise of the Carolingian Empire, France split into a number of feuding provinces, lacking any organized patronage. French art of the tenth and eleventh centuries was produced by local monasteries to promote literacy and piety, however, the primitive styles produced were not so highly skilled as the techniques of the earlier Carolingian period.

Multiple regional styles developed based on the chance availability of Carolingian manuscripts as models to copy, and the availability of itinerant artists. The monastery of Saint Bertin became an important center under its abbot Odbert (986–1007), who created a new style based on Anglo-Saxon and Carolingian forms. The nearby [[St. Vaast's Abbey|abbey of St. Vaast]] (Pas-de-Calais) also created a number of important works. In southwestern France a number of manuscripts were produced c. 1000, at the monastery of [[Saint Martial]] in [[Limoges]], as well as at [[Albi]], [[Figeac]], and [[Saint-Sever-de-Rustan]] in [[Gascony]]. In Paris a unique style developed at the [[abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés]]. In [[Normandy]] a new style arose in 975. By the later tenth century with the [[Cluny]] reform movement and a revived spirit for the concept of Empire, art production resumed.

[[File:Basilique de Vézelay Narthex Tympan central 220608.jpg|thumb|right|Central tympanum of the narthex of the [[Vézelay Abbey]] in [[Vézelay]], 1140–1150]]

====Romanesque art====
{{Main|Romanesque art}}
[[Romanesque art]] refers to the art of Western Europe during a period of one hundred and fifty years, from approximately 1000 AD to the rise of the [[Gothic Art|Gothic style]], which arose in the middle of the twelfth century in France. "Romanesque Art" was marked by a renewed interest in Roman construction techniques. For example, the twelfth-century capitals on the cloister of [[Saint-Guilhem-le-Désert]], adopt an [[acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]]-leaf [[Motif (art)|motif]] and the decorative use of drill holes, which were commonly found on Roman monuments. Other important Romanesque buildings in France include the abbey of [[Saint-Benoît-sur-Loire]] in [[Loiret]], the churches of [[Abbey Church of Saint Foy|Saint-Foy]] in [[Conques]] of [[Aveyron]], Saint-Martin in [[Tours]], Saint-Philibert in [[Tournus]] of [[Saône-et-Loire]], [[Abbey of Saint-Remi|Saint-Remi]] in [[Reims]], and [[Saint-Sernin Basilica|Saint-Sernin]] in [[Toulouse]]. In particular, [[Normandy]] experienced a large building campaign in the churches of [[Bernay, Eure|Bernay]], [[Mont-Saint-Michel]], [[Coutances Cathedral]], and [[Bayeux]].

[[File:Sainte Chapelle - Upper level 1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Interior of the Chapelle Haute, [[Sainte Chapelle]], Paris]]
Most Romanesque sculpture was integrated into church architecture, not only for aesthetic, but also for structural purposes. Small-scale sculpture during the pre-Romanesque period was influenced by [[Byzantine]] and [[Early Christian]] sculpture. Other elements were adopted from various local styles of Middle Eastern countries. Motifs were derived from the arts of the "barbarian," such as grotesque figures, beasts, and geometric patterns, which were all important additions, particularly in the regions north of the Alps. Among the important sculptural works of the period are the ivory carvings at the monastery of [[Abbey of St. Gall|Saint Gall]]. Monumental sculpture was rarely practised separately from architecture in the Pre-Romanesque period. For the first time after the fall of the Roman empire, monumental sculpture emerged as a significant art form. Covered church [[façades]], doorways, and [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] all increased and expanded in size and importance, as in the [[Last Judgment]] [[tympanum (architecture)|Tympanum]], [[Beaulieu-sur-Dordogne]], and the Standing Prophet at [[Moissac]]. Monumental doors, baptismal fonts, and candle holders, frequently decorated with scenes from biblical history, were cast in bronze, attesting to the skills of the contemporary metalworkers. Frescoes were applied to the vaults and walls of churches. Rich textiles and precious objects in gold and silver, such as chalices and reliquaries, were produced in increasing numbers to meet the needs of the liturgy, and to serve the cult of the saints. In the twelfth century, large-scale stone sculpture spread throughout Europe. In the French Romanesque churches of [[Provence]], [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], and [[Aquitaine]], sculptures adorned the façades and statues were incorporated into the capitals.

====Gothic====
{{Main|Gothic art|Gothic architecture}}
Gothic art and architecture were products of a Medieval art movement that lasted about three hundred years. It began in France, developing from the Romanesque period in the mid-twelfth century. By the late fourteenth century, it had evolved toward a more secular and natural style known as, [[International Gothic]], which continued until the late fifteenth century, when it evolved further, into [[Renaissance art]]. The primary Gothic art media were [[sculpture]], [[panel painting]], [[stained glass]], [[fresco]], and [[illuminated manuscript]].

[[File:Cenral tympanum Chartres.jpg|thumb|right|The Western (Royal) Portal at Chartres Cathedral, ''c.'' 1145, these architectural statues are the earliest Gothic sculptures, a revolution in style and the models for a generation of sculptors]]
Gothic architecture was born in the middle of the twelfth century in [[Île-de-France]], when [[Abbot Suger]] built the abbey at [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|St. Denis]], ''c.'' 1140, considered the first Gothic building, and soon afterward, the [[Chartres Cathedral]], ''c.'' 1145. Prior to this, there had been no sculpture tradition in Île-de-France—so sculptors were brought in from [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], who created the revolutionary figures acting as columns in the Western (Royal) Portal of Chartres Cathedral (''see image'') —it was an entirely new invention in French art, and would provide the model for a generation of sculptors. Other notable Gothic churches in France include [[Cathédrale Saint-Étienne de Bourges|Bourges Cathedral]], [[Amiens Cathedral]], [[Notre-Dame of Laon|Notre-Dame de Laon]], [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]] in [[Paris]], [[Reims Cathedral]], the [[Sainte-Chapelle]] in [[Paris]], [[Strasbourg Cathedral]].

The designations of styles in French Gothic architecture are as follows: Early Gothic, High Gothic, Rayonnant, and Late Gothic or "Flamboyant". Division into these divisions is effective, but debatable. Because Gothic cathedrals were built over several successive periods, and the artisans of each period not necessarily following the wishes of previous periods, the dominant architectural style often changed during the building of a particular building. Consequently, it is difficult to declare one building as belonging to certain era of Gothic architecture. It is more useful to use the terms as descriptors for specific elements within a structure, rather than applying it to the building as a whole.

The French ideas spread. Gothic sculpture evolved from the early stiff and elongated style, still partly Romanesque, into a spatial and naturalistic treatment in the late twelfth and early thirteenth century. Influences from surviving ancient Greek and Roman sculptures were incorporated into the treatment of drapery, facial expression, and pose of the Dutch-Burgundian sculptor, [[Claus Sluter]], and the taste for naturalism first signaled the end of Gothic sculpture, evolving into the classicistic Renaissance style by the end of the fifteenth century.

[[File:Enguerrand Quarton, Le Couronnement de la Vierge (1454).jpg|thumb|left|260px|[[Enguerrand Quarton]], ''The Coronation of the Virgin'', 1452–53]]
Painting in a style that may be called, "Gothic," did not appear until about 1200, nearly fifty years after the start of Gothic architecture and sculpture. The transition from Romanesque to Gothic is very imprecise and by no means clearly delineated, but one may see the beginning of a style that is more somber, dark, and emotional than the previous period. This transition occurs first in England and France around 1200, in Germany around 1220, and in Italy around 1300. Painting, the representation of images on a surface, was practiced during the Gothic period in four primary crafts, [[fresco]]s, [[panel painting]]s, [[manuscript illumination]], and [[stained glass]]. Frescoes continued to be used as the main pictorial narrative craft on church walls in southern Europe as a continuation of early Christian and Romanesque traditions. In the north, stained glass remained the dominant art form until the fifteenth century. At the end of the 14th century and during the 15th century French princely courts like those of the dukes of Burgundy, the duke of Anjou or the duke of Berry as well as the pope and the cardinals in Avignon employed renowned painters, like the [[Limbourg Brothers]], [[Barthélemy d'Eyck]], [[Enguerrand Quarton]] or [[Jean Fouquet]], who developed the so-called [[International Gothic]] style that spread through Europe and incorporated the new Flemish influence as well as the innovations of the Italian early Renaissance artists.

===Early Modern period===
[[File:Meister der Schule von Fontainebleau 001.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Diana the Huntress'' - School of Fontainebleau, 1550–60]]
{{Main|French Renaissance}}
In the late fifteenth century, the French [[Italian Wars|invasion of Italy]] and the proximity of the vibrant [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] court, with its Flemish connections, brought the French into contact with the goods, paintings, and the creative spirit of the [[Northern Renaissance|Northern]] and [[Italian Renaissance]]. Initial artistic changes at that time in France were executed by Italian and Flemish artists, such as [[Jean Clouet]] and his son [[François Clouet]], along with the Italians, [[Rosso Fiorentino]], [[Francesco Primaticcio]], and [[Niccolò dell'Abbate]] of what is often called the first [[School of Fontainebleau]] from 1531. [[Leonardo da Vinci]] also was invited to France by François I, but other than the paintings which he brought with him, he produced little for the French king.

The art of the period from François I through Henri IV often is heavily inspired by late Italian pictorial and sculptural developments commonly referred to as [[Mannerism]], which is associated with the later works of [[Michelangelo]] as well as [[Parmigianino]], among others. It is characterized by figures which are elongated and graceful that rely upon visual [[rhetoric]], including the elaborate use of [[allegory]] and [[mythology]]. Perhaps the greatest accomplishment of the French Renaissance was the construction of the [[Châteaux of the Loire Valley]]. No longer conceived of as fortresses, such pleasure palaces took advantage of the richness of the rivers and lands of the Loire region and they show remarkable architectural skill.

====Baroque and Classicism====
{{main|French Baroque and Classicism}}
[[File:Nicolas Poussin - Et in Arcadia ego (deuxième version).jpg|thumb|left|250px|''[[Les Bergers d’Arcadie]]'' by Nicolas Poussin]]

The seventeenth century marked a golden age for French art in all fields.
In the early part of the seventeenth century, late [[Mannerism|mannerist]] and early [[Baroque]] tendencies continued to flourish in the court of [[Marie de Medici]] and [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]].
Art from this period shows influences from both the north of Europe, namely the Dutch and Flemish schools, and from Roman painters of the [[Counter-Reformation]]. Artists in France frequently debated the contrasting merits of [[Peter Paul Rubens]] with his Flemish baroque, voluptuous lines and colors to [[Nicolas Poussin]] with his rational control, proportion, Roman classicist baroque style. Another proponent of classicism working in Rome was [[Claude Gellée]], known as Le Lorrain, who defined the form of classical landscape.

Many young French painters of the beginning of the century went to Rome to train themselves and soon assimilated [[Caravaggio]]'s influence like [[Valentin de Boulogne]] and [[Simon Vouet]]. The later is credited with bringing the baroque in France and at his return in Paris in 1627 he was named first painter of the king. But French painting soon departed from the extravagance and naturalism of the Italian baroque and painters like [[Eustache Le Sueur]] and [[Laurent de La Hyre]], following Poussin example developed a classicist way known as "Parisian atticism", inspired by Antiquity, and focusing on proportion, harmony and the importance of drawing. Even Vouet, after his return from Italy, changed his manner to a more measured but still highly decorative and elegant style.
 
[[File:Georges de La Tour 009.jpg|thumb|190px|[[Georges de La Tour]], ''The Penitent Magdalene'', c. 1640.]]

But at the same time there was still a strong ''[[Caravaggisti]]'' Baroque school represented in the period by the amazing candle-lit paintings of [[Georges de La Tour]]. The wretched and the poor were featured in a [[Utrecht Caravaggisti|quasi-Dutch manner]] in the paintings by the three [[Le Nain]] brothers. In the paintings of [[Philippe de Champaigne]] there are both propagandistic portraits of [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]]' s minister [[Cardinal Richelieu]] and other more contemplative portraits of people in the Catholic [[Jansenist]] sect.

In architecture, architects like [[Salomon de Brosse]], [[François Mansart]] and [[Jacques Lemercier]] helped define the French form of the baroque, developing the formula of the urban [[hôtel particulier]] that was to influence all of Europe and strongly departed from the Italian equivalent, the [[palazzo]]. Many aristocratic castles were rebuilt in the new classic-baroque style, some of the most famous being [[château de Maisons|Maisons]] and [[château de Cheverny|Cheverny]], characterized by high roofs ''"à la française"'' and a form that retained the medieval model of the castle adorned with prominent towers.

From the mid to late seventeenth century, French art is more often referred to by the term "Classicism" which implies an adherence to certain rules of proportion and sobriety uncharacteristic of the Baroque, as it was practiced in most of the rest of Europe during the same period. Under [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], the Baroque as it was practiced in Italy, was not in French taste, for instance, as [[Bernini]]'s famous proposal for redesigning the Louvre was rejected by Louis XIV.[[File:Le chateau de Vaux le Vicomte.jpg|left|thumb|260px|[[Château de Vaux-le-Vicomte]] by [[Louis Le Vau]].]] Through [[propaganda]], wars, and great architectural works, [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] launched a vast program designed for the glorification of France and his name. The [[Palace of Versailles]], initially a tiny hunting lodge built by his father, was transformed by Louis XIV into a marvelous palace for fêtes and parties, under the direction of architects [[Louis Le Vau]] (who had also built the [[château de Vaux-le-Vicomte]]) and [[Jules Hardouin Mansart]] (who built the [[Les Invalides|church of the Invalides]] in Paris), painter and designer [[Charles Le Brun]], and the landscape architect [[André Le Nôtre]] who perfected the rational form of the [[French garden]] that from Versailles spread in all of Europe.

For sculpture Louis XIV's reign also proved an important moment thanks to the King's protection of artists like [[Pierre Puget]], [[François Girardon]] and [[Charles-Antoine Coysevox]]. In Rome, [[Pierre Legros]], working in a more baroque manner, was one of the most influential sculptors of the end of the century.

====Rococo and Neoclassicism====
[[File:Salon de la princesse hotel de soubise.jpg|thumb|Boiseries of the ''Salon de la princesse'' by [[Germain Boffrand]], [[hôtel de Soubise]], Paris]]

{{Main|French Rococo and Neoclassicism}}

[[Rococo]] and [[Neoclassicism]] are terms used to describe the visual and plastic arts and architecture in Europe from the early eighteenth century to the end of the eighteenth century. In France, the death of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] in 1715 lead to a period of freedom commonly called the [[Régence]]. Versailles was abandoned from 1715 to 1722, the young king Louis XV and the government led by the [[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|duke of Orléans]] residing in Paris. There a new style emerged in the decorative arts, known as ''rocaille'' : the asymmetry and dynamism of the baroque was kept but renewed in a style that is less rhetoric and with less pompous effects, a deeper research of artificiality and use of motifs inspired by nature. This manner used to decorate rooms and furniture also existed in painting. Rocaillle painting turned toward lighters subjects, like the "fêtes galantes", theater settings, pleasant mythological narratives and the female nude. Most of the times the moralising sides of myths or history paintings are omitted and the accent is put on the decorative and pleasant aspect of the scenes depicted. Paintings from the period show an emphasis more on color than drawing, with apparent brush strokes and very colorful scenes. Important French painters from this period include [[Antoine Watteau]], considered the inventor of the ''fête galante'', [[Nicolas Lancret]] and [[François Boucher]]. 
[[File:Jean-Honoré Fragonard - Inspiration.jpg|thumb|left|''Inspiration'' by [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard]]]]

The [[Louis XV style]] of decoration, although already apparent at the end of the last reign, was lighter with pastel colors, wood panels, smaller rooms, less gilding, and fewer brocades; shells, garlands, and occasional Chinese subjects predominated. The [[Chantilly porcelain|Chantilly]], [[Vincennes porcelain|Vincennes]] and then [[Sèvres porcelain|Sèvres manufactures]] produced some of the finest porcelain of the time. The highly skilled ''[[ébéniste]]s'', cabinet-makers mostly based in Paris, created elaborate pieces of furniture with precious wood and bronze ornaments that were to be highly praised and imitated in all of Europe. The most famous are [[Jean-François Oeben]], who created the work desk of king Louis XV in Versailles, and [[Bernard II van Risamburgh]]. Rooms in ''châteaux'' and ''hôtels particuliers'' were more intimate than during the reign of Louis XIV and were decorated with rocaille style [[boiseries]] (carved wood pannels covering the walls of a room) conceived by architects like [[Germain Boffrand]] or ''ornemanistes'' (designers of decorative objects) like [[Juste-Aurèle Meissonnier]]. [[File:Place de la bourse.jpg|thumb|right|270px|[[Place de la Bourse]] in Bordeaux by [[Ange-Jacques Gabriel]]]]
The most prominent architects of the first half of the century were, apart Boffrand, [[Robert de Cotte]] and [[Ange-Jacques Gabriel]], who designed public squares like the [[place de la Concorde]] in Paris and the [[place de la Bourse]] in [[Bordeaux]] in a style consciously inspired by that of the era of Louis XIV. During the first half of the century, France replaced Italy as the artistic centre and main artistic influence in Europe and many French artists worked in other courts across the continent.

The latter half of the eighteenth century continued to see French preeminence in Europe, particularly through the arts and sciences, and the speaking the [[French language]] was expected for members of the European courts. The French academic system continued to produce artists, but some, such as [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard]] and [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin]], explored new and increasingly impressionist styles of painting with thick brushwork. Although the hierarchy of genres continued to be respected officially, [[Genre works|genre painting]], [[Landscape art|landscape]], [[portrait]], and [[still life]] were extremely fashionable. Chardin and [[Jean-Baptiste Oudry]] were hailed for their still lives although this was officially considered the lowest of all genres in the hierarchy of painting subjects.
[[File:Prometheus Adam Louvre MR1745.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Prometheus'' by [[Nicolas-Sébastien Adam]]]]

One also finds in this period a ''Pre-romanticist'' aspect. [[Hubert Robert]]'s images of ruins, inspired by Italian cappricio paintings, are typical in this respect as well as the image of storms and moonlight marines by [[Claude Joseph Vernet]]. So too the change from the rational and geometrical ''French garden'' of [[André Le Nôtre]] to the ''English garden'', which emphasized artificially wild and irrational nature. One also finds in some of these gardens—curious ruins of temples—called "follies".

The last half of the eighteenth century saw a turn to [[Neoclassicism]] in France, that is to say a conscious use of Greek and Roman forms and [[iconography]]. This movement was promoted by intellectuals like Diderot, in reaction to the artificiality and the decorative essence of the ''rocaille'' style. In painting, the greatest representative of this style is [[Jacques-Louis David]], who, mirroring the profiles of Greek vases, emphasized the use of the profile. His subject matter often involved classical history such as the death of Socrates and Brutus. The dignity and subject matter of his paintings were greatly inspired by the works of [[Nicolas Poussin]] from the seventeenth century. Poussin and David were in turn major influences on [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres]]. Other important neoclassical painters of the period are [[Jean-Baptiste Greuze]] and [[Joseph-Marie Vien]]. Neoclassicism also penetrated decorative arts and architecture.
[[File:Jacques-Louis David - Oath of the Horatii - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Jacques-Louis David]], ''[[Oath of the Horatii]]'' (1786)]]
Architects like [[Claude-Nicolas Ledoux|Ledoux]] and [[Étienne-Louis Boullée|Boullée]] developed a radical style of neoclassical architecture based on simple and pure geometrical forms with a research of simetry and harmony, elaborating visionary projects like the complex of the [[Royal Saltworks at Arc-et-Senans|Saltworks of Arc-et-Senans]] by Ledoux, a model of an ideal factory developed from the rational concepts of the [[Enlightment philosophers|Enlightment]] thinkers.

===Modern period===

====19th century====
{{main|French art of the 19th century}}
The [[French Revolution]] and the [[Napoleonic wars]] brought great changes to the arts in France. The program of exaltation and myth making attendant to the Emperor [[Napoleon I of France]] was closely coordinated in the paintings of David, Gros and Guérin. [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]] was the main figure of neoclassicism until the 1850s and a prominent teacher, giving priority to drawing over color. Meanwhile, [[Orientalism]], Egyptian motifs, the tragic [[anti-hero]], the wild landscape, the [[historical novel]], and scenes from the Middle Ages and the Renaissance—all these elements of [[Romanticism]]—created a vibrant period that defies easy classification. The most important romantic painter of the period was Eugène Delacroix, who had a successful public career and was the main opponent of Ingres. Before him, [[Théodore Géricault]] opened the path to romanticism with his monumental ''[[Raft of the Medusa]]'' exposed at the 1819 Salon. [[Camille Corot]] tried to escape the conventional and idealized form of landscape painting influenced by classicism to be more realist and sensible to atmospheric variations at the same time.

[[File:Eugène Delacroix - Le Massacre de Scio.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''[[The Massacre at Chios]]'' - Eugène Delacroix]]

Romantic tendencies continued throughout the century, both idealized landscape painting and [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] have their seeds in Romanticism. The work of [[Gustave Courbet]] and the [[Barbizon school]] are logical developments from it, as is the late nineteenth century [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] of such painters as [[Gustave Moreau]], the professor of [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Georges Rouault]], as well as [[Odilon Redon]].

[[Academic painting]] developed at the [[École des Beaux-Arts de Paris|Ecole des Beaux-Arts]] was the most successful with the public and the State : highly trained painters like [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]], [[William Bouguereau]] and [[Alexandre Cabanel]] painted historical scenes inspired by the antique, following the footsteps of Ingres and the neoclassics. Though criticized for their conventionalism by the young avant-garde painters and critics, the most talented of the Academic painters renewed the historical genre, drawing inspiration from multiple cultures and techniques, like the Orient and the new framings made possible by the invention of photography

For many critics [[Édouard Manet]] wrote of the nineteenth century and the modern period (much as [[Charles Baudelaire]] does in poetry). His rediscovery of Spanish painting from the golden age, his willingness to show the unpainted canvas, his exploration of the forthright nude, and his radical brush strokes are the first steps toward Impressionism. [[Impressionism]] would take the [[Barbizon school]] one step farther, rejecting once and for all a belabored style and the use of mixed colors and black, for fragile transitive effects of light as captured outdoors in changing light (partly inspired by the paintings of [[J. M. W. Turner]] and [[Eugène Boudin]]). It led to [[Claude Monet]] with his cathedrals and haystacks, [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] with both his early outdoor festivals and his later feathery style of ruddy nudes, [[Edgar Degas]] with his dancers and bathers. Other important impressionists were [[Alfred Sisley]], [[Camille Pissarro]] and [[Gustave Caillebotte]].

After that threshold was crossed, the next thirty years became a litany of amazing experiments. [[Vincent van Gogh]], Dutch born, but living in France, opened the road to [[expressionism]]. [[Georges-Pierre Seurat|Georges Seurat]], influenced by color theory, devised a [[pointillism|pointillist]] technique that governed the Impressionist experiment and was followed by [[Paul Signac]]. [[Paul Cézanne]], a painter's painter, attempted a geometrical exploration of the world, that left many of his peers indifferent. [[Paul Gauguin]], a banker, found symbolism in [[Brittany]]  along [[Émile Bernard (painter)|Emile Bernard]] and then exoticism and primitivism in [[French Polynesia]]. These painters were referred to as [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionists]].  [[Les Nabis]], a movement of the 1890s, regrouping painters such as [[Paul Sérusier]], [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Édouard Vuillard]] and [[Maurice Denis]], was influenced by Gauguin's example in Brittany: they explored a decorative art in flat plains with the graphic approach of a Japanese print. They preached that a work of art is the end product and the visual expression of an artist's synthesis of nature in personal aesthetic metaphors and symbols. 
[[Henri Rousseau]], the self-taught dabbling postmaster, became the model for the naïve revolution.

====20th century====
{{Main|French art of the 20th century}}
[[File:Claude Monet - Rouen Cathedral, Facade (Sunset).JPG|thumb|175px|left|[[Claude Monet]], ''Rouen Cathedral, Facade (Sunset)'']]
The early years of the twentieth century were dominated by experiments in colour and content that [[Impressionism]] and [[Post-Impressionism]] had unleashed. The products of the far east also brought new influences.  At roughly the same time, [[Fauvism|Les Fauves]] ([[Henri Matisse]], [[André Derain]], [[Maurice de Vlaminck]], [[Albert Marquet]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Othon Friesz]], [[Charles Camoin]], [[Henri Manguin]]) exploded into color, much like German [[Expressionism]].

The discovery of African tribal masks by [[Pablo Picasso]], a Spaniard living in Paris, lead him to create his ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' of 1907. Working independently, Picasso and [[Georges Braque]] returned to and refined Cézanne's way of rationally comprehension of objects in a flat medium, their experiments in [[cubism]] also would lead them to integrate all aspects and objects of day-to-day life, [[collage]] of newspapers, musical instruments, cigarettes, wine, and other objects into their works. [[Cubism]] in all its phases would dominate paintings of Europe and America for the next ten years. (See the article on [[Cubism]] for a complete discussion.)

[[World War I]] did not stop the dynamic creation of art in France. In 1916 a group of discontents met in a bar in Zurich, the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zürich)|Cabaret Voltaire]], and created the most radical gesture possible, the anti-art of [[Dada]]. At the same time, [[Francis Picabia]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]] were exploring similar notions. At a 1917 art show in [[New York City|New York]], Duchamp presented a white porcelain urinal (''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'') signed ''R. Mutt'' as work of art, becoming the father of the ''[[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymade]]''.

When [[Dada]] reached Paris, it was avidly embraced by a group of young artists and writers who were fascinated with the writings of [[Sigmund Freud]], particularly by his notion of the [[unconscious mind]]. The provocative spirit of Dada became linked to the exploration of the unconscious mind through the use of [[automatic writing]], chance operations, and, in some cases, altered states. The [[surrealism|surrealists]] quickly turned to painting and sculpture. The shock of unexpected elements, the use of [[Frottage (surrealist technique)|Frottage]], [[collage]], and [[decalcomania]], the rendering of mysterious landscapes and dreamed images were to become the key techniques through the rest of the 1930s.
[[File:Violin and Candlestick.jpg|175px|thumb|[[Georges Braque]], ''Violin and Candlestick'', 1910]]

Immediately after this war the French art scene diverged roughly in two directions. There were those who continued in the artistic experiments from before the war, especially surrealism, and others who adopted the new [[Abstract Expressionism]] and [[action painting]] from New York, executing them in a French manner using [[Tachism]] or [[L'art informel]]. Parallel to both of these tendencies, [[Jean Dubuffet]] dominated the early post-war years while exploring childlike drawings, graffiti, and cartoons in a variety of media.

The late 1950s and early 1960s in France saw art forms that might be considered ''[[Pop Art]]''. [[Yves Klein]] had attractive nude women roll around in blue paint and throw themselves at canvases. [[Victor Vasarely]] invented [[Op-Art]] by designing sophisticated optical patterns. Artists of the [[Fluxus]] movement such as [[Ben Vautier]] incorporated [[graffiti]] and found objects into their work. [[Niki de Saint-Phalle]] created bloated and vibrant plastic figures. [[Arman]] gathered together found objects in boxed or resin-coated assemblages, and [[César Baldaccini]] produced a series of large compressed object-sculptures. In May 1968, the radical youth movement, through their ''atelier populaire'', produced a great deal of poster-art protesting the moribund policies of president [[Charles de Gaulle]].

Many contemporary artists continue to be haunted by the horrors of the Second World War and the specter of the Holocaust. [[Christian Boltanski]]'s harrowing installations of the lost and the anonymous are particularly powerful.

A glossary of terms used in [[glass art]]

*'''Annealing''',&lt;ref name="Whitehouse1993" /&gt; The process of slowly cooling a blown or cast object to prevent the stresses of rapid cooling from cracking or damaging the object.
* '''Cane''', '''rods''' of glass with color, either single or multiple (see also zanfirico/twisted cane)
* '''Casting''',&lt;ref name="Whitehouse1993"&gt;{{cite book | editor-last = Whitehouse| editor-first = David| title = Glass: A Pocket Dictionary of Terms Commonly Used to Describe Glass and Glassmaking| publisher = Corning Museum of Glass| date = 1993| location = Corning, New York| isbn = 0-87290-132-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Glass Today" /&gt; Any of several methods of forming glass in a mold, including the pouring of molten glass into a sand mold (''sand casting'') and the melting of glass cullet in a mold placed in a [[kiln]] (''kiln casting'').  
*'''Cullet''', broken chunks of glass or waste glass suitable for melting or remelting.
* '''[[Flameworking]]''', alternate name '''lampworking''',&lt;ref name=Whitehouse1993 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Glass Today" /&gt; the technique of forming glass, from rods and tubes, using a bench top or handheld heat source, formerly lamps, more often today a bench-mounted oxy/propane torch, to shape and form the glass by glassblowing and with the use of tongs, forceps, knives and other small tools. [[Borosilicate glass]] is the most common form of glass to be manipulated using this technique.
* '''[[Frit]]''', crushed glass often melted onto other glass to produce patterns and color
* '''Incalmo''', the grafting or joining together, while still hot, of two separately blown glass [bubbles] to produce a single [bubble].&lt;ref name=Gable2004&gt;{{cite book | last = Gable| first = Carl I.| title = Murano Magic: Complete Guide to Venetian Glass, its History and Artists| publisher = Schiffer Publishing, Ltd.| date = 2004| location = Atglen, Pennsylvania| isbn = 0-7643-1946-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Glass art#Knitted Glass|Knitted glass]]''', incorporates the techniques of [[knitting]], [[lost-wax casting]], [[Molding (process)|mold-making]], and [[Glass casting#Kiln casting|kiln-casting]].
* '''Latticino''', Italian decorative [[glassblowing]] technique.  Latticino refers to any glass piece created using colored glass canes.
* '''Latticello''' A decorative [[glassblowing]] technique. A ''latticello'' is a complicated design where the glass artist uses a ''latticino'' to create a ''reticello'' like pattern. Although the ''latticino" and the ''reticello'' are both classic Italian techniques, the ''latticello'' is a modern-day twist on classic design.
* '''[[Lehr (glassmaking)|Lehr]]''', a specialized, temperature-controlled kiln for annealing glass.&lt;ref name = Collins1921&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Collins|first1= E.F.|date= 1921|title= Electrically heated glass annealing Lehr|journal= Journal of the American Ceramic Society|volume= 4 |issue= 5|pages= 335–349|doi=10.1111/j.1151-2916.1921.tb18664.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Mandrel''', metal rod used to construct a [[glass bead]] around.  When cooled and removed,  the space occupied by the mandrel creates the hole through the bead.
* '''Marver''', a tool used in [[glassblowing]]  A marver is a large flat table.  The glass piece is rolled across is surface.  It is used to not only shape the glass, but to remove heat as well.  The rapid absorption of heat by the marver creates a stronger skin (surface tension) than the use of a wooden tool.  Marver is derived from the word "marble."  Marble was originally used in the construction of this specialized table.  Modern marvers are made of steel, typically stainless steel.  Lampworkers use small graphite marvers mounted on or near their torches.
* '''Millefiori''',&lt;ref name="Glass Today"&gt;{{cite book| last = Fairbanks

* '''[[Murrine]]''', Italian term for patterns or images made in a glass cane (long rods of glass) that are revealed when cut or chopped in cross-sections.
* '''Pate de verre''',&lt;ref name="Glass Today" /&gt; a paste of ground or crushed glass, and the technique of casting this material into a mold; also applied to a more general range of cast-glass objects.
* '''[[Prunt]]''', a small blob of glass fused to a piece of glass, often impressed with a pattern or stamp
*'''[[Punty]]''', occasionally '''pontil''', a solid metal rod, around 5 feet long, used to hold an object being blown or hot-worked after it is removed from the blowpipe.

* '''Reticello''', Italian decorative [[glassblowing]] technique.  This involves the merging of two cane bubbles (one inside the other) in which the straight canes were twisted in opposite directions.  Once merged, the opposingly twisted canes cross each other creating a net like pattern.  If done the traditional way,  small air bubbles will be trapped in a grid pattern between the crossing canes.
* '''Rod''', a [[rod (geometry)|rod]] of glass used as a raw material in forming and fusing glass
* '''Twisty cane''', a '''cane''' formed out of different coloured glass twisted together - also known as zanfirico cane
* '''[[Vitreography (art form)]]''', a style of contained 3-dimensional scenes displayed in a shadow box frame. 
* '''[[Vitreography|Vitreography (printing technique)]]''', use of a 3⁄8-inch-thick (9.5&amp;nbsp;mm) float glass matrix instead of the traditional matrices of metal, wood or stone.

* '''[[Vitrigraph Pulling]]''',   pulling molten glass strings from a wall mounted kiln—called a vitrigraph kiln—  usually into shapes such as spirals.

* '''Zanfirico''', Italian decorative [[glassblowing]] technique involving intricate patterns of colored glass canes arranged and twisted to comprise a pattern within a new single glass cane.  These new patterned canes are then used to create a glass work.

The description in Latin reads: ''"Herrat hohenburgensis abbatissa post Rilindam ordinata ac monitis et exemplis eius instituta"''. These are the initial words of the description from the last [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature]] (fol.322-323) of the ''Hortus deliciarum''.]]

'''Herrad of Landsberg''' ({{lang-la|Herrada Landsbergensis}}; {{circa|lk=no}} 1130 – July 25, 1195) was a 12th-century [[Alsace|Alsatian]] nun and abbess of [[Hohenburg Abbey]] in the [[Vosges mountains]]. She was known as the author of the pictorial encyclopedia ''[[Hortus deliciarum]]'' (''The Garden of Delights'').

==Life at Abbey==
[[File:MontStOdile 073.JPG|thumb|left|[[Wall painting]] depicting nuns of Hohenburg Abbey. The Latin inscription reads: ''"Mons Hohenburc dellifer ''(sic)'' id est sublimus"''.&lt;ref&gt;Most likely ''dellifer'' is an erroneous spelling of ''bellifer''.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Born about 1130 at the castle of [[Château du Landsberg|Landsberg]], the seat of a noble Alsatian family, she entered [[Hohenburg Abbey]] in the Vosges mountains, about fifteen miles from [[Strasbourg]], at an early age. Hohenburg Abbey, also known as Mont St Odile, was run by [[Relindis of Hohenburg|Abbess Relinda]], a nun sent from the [[Benedictine]] monastery of [[Bergen, Neuburg|Bergen]] in Bavaria. Due to her support from the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] the abbey was extremely successful and powerful, as well as a source for reform. At the abbey Herrad received the most comprehensive education available to women during the 12th century. As she grew older she rose to a high position in office at the abbey, and was soon put in charge of governing and educating her fellow nuns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McGuire|first1=Thérèse|title=Monastic Artists and Educators in the Middle Ages|journal=Woman's Art Journal|date=1988–89|volume=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Relinda’s death, Herrad was elected abbess in 1167.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Storey|first1=Ann|title=A Theophany of the Feminine: Hildegard of Bingen, Elsabeth of Schönau and Herrad of Landsberg|journal=Woman's Art Journal|date=1998|volume=19.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1159 Herrad had begun within the [[cloister]] walls the work for which she is best known, the ''Hortus Deliciarum'', a compendium of all the sciences studied at that time. It was written for the women in Herrad's convent, in order to further the teaching of biblical, moral, and theological material, and was completed in 1185.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Herrad von Landsberg|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T037828?q=herrad+landsberg&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=2&amp;_start=1#firsthit|website=Oxford Art Online|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, Herrad delves into the battle of Virtue and Vice with vivid visual imagery preceding the text&lt;!--and obviously lots of alliteration - cheers--&gt;.

The original manuscript consisted of 648 pages on 324 parchment sheets.&lt;ref&gt;Engelhardt, Christian Moritz. [http://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/diglit/engelhardt1818bd1/0001/scroll?sid=cbdaec14c07664d206debb912d89a416 ''Herrad von Landsperg, Aebtissin zu Hohenburg oder St. Odilien, im Elsaß, im zwölften Jahrhundert; und ihre Werk: Hortus deliciarum: ein Beytrag zur Geschichte der Wissenschaften, Literatur, Kunst, Kleidung, Waffen und Sitten des Mittelalters''], digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de, p.21&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the work is written in Latin, with approximately 1250 glosses in German.&lt;ref&gt;Herrad (of Landsberg, Abbess of Hohenburg). [https://books.google.es/books/about/Hortus_deliciarum.html?hl=en&amp;id=xLITAQAAMAAJ ''Hortus deliciarum], Part 1 Volume 36 of Studies of the Warburg Institute, Warburg Institute, University of London, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; The work shows a wide range of reading. Its chief claim to distinction is the 336 illustrations which adorn the text. Many of these are symbolical representations of theological, philosophical, and literary themes; some are historical, some represent scenes from the actual experience of the artist, and one is a collection of portraits of her sisters in religion. The technique has been very much admired and in almost every instance they show an artistic imagination which is rare in Herrad's contemporaries.

While other artists and writers contributed to the ''Hortus Deliciarum'', it was largely compiled, written, and edited by Herrad. Many of the poems and hymns were written by Herrad, and it is speculated that much of the art was created under the direction of Herrad as well.

After having been preserved for centuries at Hohenburg Abbey, the manuscript of ''Hortus Deliciarum'' passed into the municipal library of Strasbourg about the time of the [[French Revolution]]. There the miniatures were copied by Christian Moritz Engelhardt and published by [[Johann Friedrich Cotta|Cotta]] in Stuttgart in 1818.&lt;ref&gt;A digital copy of Christian Moritz Engelhardt's book is available at the library of [[Heidelberg University]]: Engelhardt, Christian Moritz [http://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/diglit/engelhardt1818bd1/0001 ''Herrad von Landsperg, Aebtissin zu Hohenburg oder St. Odilien, im Elsaß, im zwölften Jahrhundert; und ihre Werk: Hortus deliciarum: ein Beytrag zur Geschichte der Wissenschaften, Literatur, Kunst, Kleidung, Waffen und Sitten des Mittelalters''] (Text) — 1818&lt;/ref&gt; The text was copied and published by Straub and Keller between 1879 and 1899 including some coloured copies from Herrad's illustrations made by Wilhelm Stengel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040324011227/http://www.artnet.com/library/03/0390/T039007.ASP Hortus deliciarum], artnet.com&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, although the original perished in the burning of the libraries of the Protestant seminary and the city of Strasbourg&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bnu.fr/de/node/533 Organisation], bnu.fr&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bnu.fr/node/631 Creation of the BNU], bnu.fr&lt;/ref&gt; during the siege of 1870 in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], we can still form an estimate of the artistic and literary value of Herrad's work.

'''Hunseby Church''' is located in the village of [[Hunseby]] some 3 km north of [[Maribo]] on the [[Denmark|Danish]] island of [[Lolland]]. Built in the middle of the 12th century, the church has a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] [[chancel]] and [[nave]] and a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] tower.&lt;ref name=ha&gt;[http://historiskatlas.dk/Hunseby_kirke_(5923) "Hunseby Church"], ''Historisk Atlas''. {{da icon}} Retrieved 3 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The church was originally dedicated to [[Andrew the Apostle|St Andrew]] as can be seen from the inscription on the oldest bell from 1465. From Romanesque inscriptions in the stonework supporting an old portal, it appears the church must have existed in the middle of the 12th century. Little is known of its early ownership apart from the fact that the Crown had appointment rights shortly before the [[Danish Reformation|Reformation]]. It remained the property of the Crown until 1565 when it was transferred to Axel Urne til Aarsmarke. One of the later owners was Eggert Christopher Knuth who was married to Sister Lerche. It came under the authority of [[Knuthenborg]] when the county was established by Sister Lerche in 1714. In April 1964, it gained its independence.&lt;ref name=natmus&gt;[http://www.natmus.dk/uploads/tx_tcchurchsearch/Maribo_0905-0922_01.pdf Kirsten Weber-Andersen, Otto Norn, Aage Roussell, Gertrud Købke Knudsen, "Hunsby Kirke"], ''Danmarks kirker: Maribo amt, Volume 8'', 1951, Nationalmuseet, pages 905-922. {{da icon}} Retrieved 11 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visitlolland-falster.com/ln-int/danmark/bicycle-route---maribobandholm-gdk616569 "Bicycle route - Maribo/Bandholm"], Visit Lolland-Falster. Retrieved 11 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
Built of fine granite stonework, the Romanesque church is unusually large. The outer walls are plastered and whitewashed while the roof is of red tile. The chancel has retained its Romanesque windows. Compared to the chancel, the nave is higher and wider. A sculpted head on the south wall is said to be King Huns's head, in line with the legend behind the name of the village. The Gothic tower is in red brick with some granite stonework and stepped gables. The [[Knuthenborg]] burial chapel was added on the south side of the church in 1851 and completely rebuilt in 1880.&lt;ref name=natmus/&gt;

==Interior==
The round chancel arch has rope-shaped corbels while the chancel ceiling was vaulted in the Gothic period. The [[Auricular style|Auricular Baroque]] [[altarpiece]] is from c. 1700 with a painting of the Last Supper and the arms of Eggert Christopher Knuth and Sister Lerche. The [[pulpit]], in the [[Renaissance|High Renaissance]] style, is from 1617 and bears the arms of Knud Urne and Merete Grubbe.&lt;ref name=natmus/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nordenskirker.dk/Tidligere/Hunseby_kirke/Hunseby_kirke.htm "Hunseby kirke"], ''Nordens kirker''. {{da icon}} Retrieved 11 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In the burial chapel, there is an epitaph for Eggert Christopher Knuth (died 1697) and Sister Lerche (died 1723).&lt;ref name=ha/&gt;

The '''Ingeborg Psalter'''  is a late 12th century [[illuminated manuscript|illuminated]] [[psalter]] now housed in the  [[Musée Condé]] of [[Chantilly, Oise|Chantilly]], [[France]].

It was created about 1195 in northern [[France]] for [[Ingeborg of Denmark, Queen of France|Ingeborg of Denmark]], wife of King [[Philip II of France]]. It is unknown who commissioned the Psalter for Ingeborg, but it may have been commissioned by either [[Stephen of Tournai]] or [[Eleanor, Countess of Vermandois]]. It is one of the most significant surviving examples of early [[Gothic painting]].

The [[manuscript]] was prayerbook for private devotionals and contains a calendar, the 150 [[Psalms]] in [[Latin]] plus other liturgical texts. There are 200 extent folios. The text is written in an early [[Gothic minuscule]].

'''Jean Béraud''' ({{IPA-fr|beʁo|lang}}; January 12, 1848&lt;ref&gt;http://www.musee-orsay.fr/fr/espace-professionnels/professionnels/chercheurs/rech-rec-art-home/notice-artiste.html?no_cache=1&amp;nnumid=6396&amp;retouroeuvre=%252Ffr%252Fcollections%252Fcatalogue-des-oeuvres%252Fnotice.html%253Fno_cache%253D1%2526nnumid%253D25602&lt;/ref&gt;  – October 4, 1935) was a [[France|French]] [[Painting|painter]] renowned for his numerous paintings depicting the life of Paris, and the nightlife of Paris society.  Pictures of the [[Champs Elysees]], cafés, [[Montmartre]] and the banks of the [[Seine]] are precisely detailed illustrations of everyday Parisian life during the "[[Belle Époque]]". He also painted religious subjects in a contemporary setting.

==Biography==
[[File:Jean Béraud Symphony in Red and Gold.jpg|thumb|300px|left| Symphony in Red and Gold]]

Béraud was born in [[Saint Petersburg]]. His father (also called Jean) was a sculptor and was likely working on the site of [[Saint Isaac's Cathedral|St. Isaac's Cathedral]] at the time of his son's birth. Béraud's mother was one Geneviève Eugénie Jacquin; following the death of Béraud's father, the family moved to [[Paris]]. Béraud was in the process of being educated as a [[lawyer]] until the occupation of Paris during the [[Franco-Prussian war]] in 1870.

Béraud became a student of [[Léon Bonnat]], and exhibited his paintings at the [[Paris Salon|Salon]] for the first time in 1872. However, he did not gain recognition until 1876, with his ''On the Way Back from the Funeral''. He exhibited with the [[Society of French Watercolorists]] at the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|1889 World's Fair]] in Paris. 
[[File:Jean Béraud A Windy Day on the Pont des Arts.jpg|thumbnail|A Windy Day on the Pont des Arts]]
[[File:Bérard Gloppe.jpg|thumb| ''Café Gloppe '']]

He painted many scenes of Parisian daily life during the [[Belle Époque]] in a style that stands somewhere between the academic art of the Salon and that of the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]]. He received the [[Légion d'honneur]] in 1894.

Béraud's paintings often included truth-based humour and mockery of late 19th-century [[Paris]]ian life, along with frequent appearances of [[Bible|biblical]] characters in then contemporary situations. Paintings such as ''Mary Magdalene in the House of the Pharisees'' aroused controversy when exhibited, because of these themes.

Towards the end of the 19th century, Béraud dedicated less time to his own painting but worked on numerous exhibition committees, including the ''Salon de la Société Nationale''. Béraud never married and had no children. He died in Paris on October 4, 1935, and is buried in [[Montparnasse Cemetery]] beside his mother.

==Style==
In France, Béraud was popular, in particular,  liked by Guy de Maupassant who called him "adorable's adversaries" (''Le plus charmant des fantaisistes'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noma.org/aqissues/JanFebMar07.pdf |title=Cooke, Victoria; Femme, femme, femme: Paintings of Women in French Society from Daumier to Picasso from the Museums of France |publisher=www.noma.org |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127033558/http://noma.org/aqissues/JanFebMar07.pdf |archivedate=2010-11-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, his work is completely ignored by art historians of the period. After the Revolution, Russian artists received Béraud's work with irony, seeing them as the embodiment of the Western commercial consumption, indulging in their opinion, in the rich middle-class tastes.
Painting style gradually shifted from academic towards impressionism. However, while the major Impressionists fled the chaotic Paris and painted landscapes of the surrounding areas, Béraud - like his friend Édouard Manet (1832-1883), and in some of their paintings, Edgar Degas (1834-1917), depicted the urban life. Artistic techniques used by Béraud, in particular, when drawing the so-called ''À la salle Graffard'', later became a classic. The upper part of the picture is hidden in a light haze, the musicians and spectators are depicted in the foreground,  while performers stand out against a darker background.&lt;ref name="Foster"&gt;{{cite web | last=Foster | first=Carter E. | title=French Master Drawings: From the Collection of Muriel Butkin | publisher=Hudson Hills Press | year=2002 | pages=182 | isbn=0940717670}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.recordnet.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100525/A_LIFE1201/5250319/-1/A_LIFE | title=Forum shows difficulties faced by young artists | last=Gilbert | first=Lori. | date=2010 | publisher=Recordnet.com | accessdate=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Le ruisseau noir (The Black Stream)''''' (also known in [[English language|En.]] as ''Stream in a Ravine'') is an oil-on-canvas landscape painted by [[French painters|French]] artist, [[Gustave Courbet]], in 1865. It is currently held and exhibited at the [[Musée d'Orsay]] in [[Paris]].

==History==
This picture was included in the [[Exposition Universelle (1867)|Exposition Universelle of 1867]], and was bought from the artist in the same year by the [[Émilien de Nieuwerkerke|Comte de  Nieuwerkerque]], Director of Museums, for [[Napoleon III]], at the price of 2000 [[French francs]]. It was part of the Emperor's personal property, and was allotted to the [[Louvre]] by the [[Tribunal]] de la [[Seine]], along with other paintings, on 12 February 1879. In 1881, it was exhibited in the [[Luxembourg]], with the title ''Le puits noir (The Black Ravine)'', which is really the name of another work painted in 1869.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.art-prints-on-demand.com/a/gustave-courbet/le-puits-noir.html ''Le puits noir'', 1869].&lt;/ref&gt; 

The landscape is currently housed and exhibited at the [[Musée d'Orsay]] in [[Paris]], and represents a gorge, a ravine through which runs a winding stream, its bed littered with rocks, between steep walls covered with wild vegetation. The stream depicted is the [[Loue]], a  capricious creek flowing through the village of [[Ornans]], where Courbet was born. The artist seems to have returned to this spot several times: it can be recognised in a number of his paintings&lt;ref&gt;Acquired by the [[Louvre]] in 1950 and now at the [[Musée des Beaux-Arts et d'archéologie de Besançon]]. Another of these landscape works, somewhat smaller than the present painting, exactly resembles it as far as the details of execution are concerned. It is dated 1866 and is in the Museum of [[Montpellier]] and is entitled ''Solitude''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of this landscape, Courbet wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;It is perhaps the best I have ever painted; it shows the Loue walled up between vast boulders of mossy rock, with thick sunlit foliage in the background.&lt;ref&gt;G. Courbet, ''Letters of Gustave Courbet'', University of Chicago Press (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Courbet loved to seek out some unspoilt corner in these lonely gorges, where the damp atmosphere conveys the impression of a strange world from which the primordial waters have only just receded. In this work, in which one senses the enthusiasm of the artist, Courbet's technique is at its peak of perfection. He has only used the brush in the background shadows; elsewhere the painting has been done with the [[palette knife]]. Courbet crushes his pigments and spreads them diagonally with his knife, thus letting underlying wads of paint show through: this creates the effect of transparency and depth as rich as those obtained by means of glazes in the work of earlier artists. His splendid greens evoke the luxuriance of a semi-aquatic world where vegetation runs riot.&lt;ref&gt;See J. Lindsay, ''Gustave Courbet his life and art'', Jupiter Books (1977); F. Masanès, ''Gustave Courbet: Unsentimental Realism'', Taschen (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7826">[[Image:Manzoni-linee.jpg|thumb|"Linea 5m 70" and "Linea 10m 99".]]
'''''Linee''''' (lines) is an [[artist's book]] by the Italian artist [[Piero Manzoni]], created in 1959. Each work consists of a cardboard tube, a scroll of paper with a black line drawn down it, and a simple printed and autographed label. This label contains a brief description of the work, the work’s length, the artist’s name and the date it was created. Most of the lines were made between September and December 1959. 68 are known to have been made,&lt;ref&gt;''Piero Manzoni Catalog Generale'', vol 1, Celant&lt;/ref&gt; each with different length strips inside.

==First public exhibition==

The first public exhibition of the ''Linee'' was at Galleria Pozzetto Chiuso in Albissola Marina, between 18 and 24 August, occasion in which Lucio Fontana Buy the Linea m 9,48.&lt;ref&gt;Pola, Francesca. Una visione internazionale. Piero Manzoni e Albisola. Electa, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The second public presentation of the lines was at the inaugural exhibition of the Galleria Azimut, Milan, a space run by Enrico Castellani and Manzoni himself, between 4 and 24 December 1959. 11 lines were exhibited unopened on wooden plinths, whilst a twelfth strip was unrolled and attached directly to the entire length of one wall. The tubes were sold for between 25 and 80 thousand lire,&lt;ref&gt;''Corriere della Sera'', Milan, 1959-12-16, quoted in ''Piero Manzoni, Catalog Raisoné'', Battino &amp; Palazzoli, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; depending on their length, which ranged from 4m 89 to 33m 63. Manzoni seems to have changed his mind about the unveiling of the twelfth strip, as he wrote in May 1960 that the tubes ‘must not be opened.’&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Shozu Yamazaki, quoted in ''Piero Manzoni Catalogue Raisoné'', Battino &amp; Palazzoli, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the strips are still occasionally unrolled when exhibited.

Originally the lines, when bought, would become a personal act of unveiling by the buyer, not dissimilar to an individual reading a book. There are documentary photos by Manzoni recording one such opening. Uliano Lucas, a friend and occasional collaborator of Manzoni is shown unravelling one such line, to discover the text '15 Capo Linea' (Head Line) at the end.&lt;ref&gt;''Piero Manzoni, Catalog Raisoné'', Battino &amp; Palazzoli, p61&lt;/ref&gt; 
Once the practice of demanding that the work remained hidden had been established, however, the tubes became objects that record an unseen artistic event, at a specific moment in time; what Duchamp called ‘a kind of rendezvous’.

The artistic act of drawing the lines becomes totally obscured, replaced by an imaginary idea of what they might look like, born witness by the labels on the tube, but not revealed.
The works elevate the external text whilst diminishing the art object, implying that only the visualisation of the work in the mind’s eye is valid. This idea was to be taken further with his ''[[Artist’s Shit]]'', where the contents are unknowable without destroying the container, and reached its logical conclusion with the ''Lines of Infinite Length'', where the line only exists as a metaphysical speculation.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Although the Lines are hidden from view, their labels identify them as events that occurred at a particular time; they are like pieces of evidence bearing witness to the artist's activity. The object of our gaze is therefore not a finished product, but rather the remnant of an act that has transpired.&lt;ref&gt;''Piero Manzoni'', Suzanne Cotter, Serpentine Gallery, 1998, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Lines of Exceptional Length'' (''Linee dalla lunghezza eccezionale'', 1960-1961)===

There were three extra works that followed the original multiple; All were lines equal to or in excess of a kilometre long, and were contained in metal cylinders.
The first, a 7,200&amp;nbsp;m line made in the presence of witnesses, was drawn on a rotary press at the Printing press for the newspaper ''Herning Avis'', Denmark, on July 4, 1959.&lt;ref&gt;''Piero Manzoni Catalogue Raisoné'', Battino &amp; Palazzoli, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; The work was made with a bottle filled with ink with a stopper at the top. The continuous sheet was then placed inside a zinc cylinder covered in lead sheets. Two more ''Lines of Exceptional Length'' were made on 24 July 1961, one 1,000&amp;nbsp;m long, the other 1,140 metres.

These were then placed in steel containers, and marked the beginnings of a series of cylinders Manzoni planned to leave in the principal cities of the world, which, when the lines were joined together, would be equal to the circumference of the world.&lt;ref&gt;''Piero Manzoni Catalogue Raisoné'', Battino &amp; Palazzoli, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; This work would remain unfinished at his death, 20 months later.

== Other related works==

Another  related work on this theme are the ''Linee di Lunghezza Infinita'' of 1960 (''Lines of Infinite Length''), made of a carved piece of wood, closely resembling the original ''Linee'', and similarly labelled, but citing the length of the strip contained inside as Infinite. Since the wood is solid, it cannot contain a strip inside, any more than if there were, it couldn’t be infinitely long. The piece takes ideas Manzoni had about works existing only in the viewers imagination to their logical conclusion; the work, in effect, is impossible, containing an impossible line, and therefore can only exist in the viewer’s mind.

Six were made before Manzoni’s death, although he printed and signed more labels, which have been used to complete the edition since his death.

The ‘disappearance of the artwork as literal object’, and the elevation of the text as central to the works meaning clearly anticipates the conceptual art movement of the late 1960s.

Manzoni also prepared a mock-up of three booklets, intended to be published as part of the avant-garde magazine ''Gorgona'', Zagreb. One of these, ''Table of Assessment #3'', was a booklet featuring a continuous line running the length of the booklet. The work was never realised due to lack of funds.&lt;ref&gt;''Piero Manzoni Catalog Generale'', vol 1, Celant pp. 286-287&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==

[[Rauschenberg]]’s ''Automobile Tire Print'', 1951 is an obvious precedent, being a scroll containing a continuous (tyre) print, which can only be seen in sections. The work is also contemporaneous with [[Tinguely]]'s ''Cyclomatic'', a big machine made of a roll of paper 1&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; km long, bicycle parts and an inkpad. When ridden by two cyclists, the work would scatter continuous bicycle tyre prints into the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=P.|last=Hulten|title=Una magia più forte della morte|publisher= Bompiani |pages=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work of [[Marcel Duchamp]] also provides a number of reference points, being concerned with the removal of the artist’s hand from the artwork, and attempting to negate any aesthetic decisions.

The sale of different ''Lines'' at different prices recalls [[Yves Klein]]’s "Proposition: Monochrome" exhibition in Milan, 1957, which Manzoni is known to have seen and been deeply affected by.&lt;ref&gt;''Manzoni'', Clemant, Electa 2007. p 61&lt;/ref&gt; The lines of exceptional lengths are recalled in Martin Kippenberger's "Metro-Net", a series of subway entrances intended to be built into the ground of every major city in the world, metaphysically joining them. Like Manzoni, Kippenberger would die before more than a handful were completed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newmediastudies.com/art/mk.htm New Media Studies]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Monument of Sari Ashig''' – was a monument and grave of famous [[bayati]] master, Sari Ashig, located in the village of Lachin region.&lt;ref name="gomap"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gomap.az/Info/Description.aspx?idlo=32&amp;lvo=4&amp;pID=1502170|title=Sar&amp;#x131; A&amp;#x15F;&amp;#x131;&amp;#x11F;&amp;#x131;n abid&amp;#x259;si - Abid&amp;#x259; v&amp;#x259; heyk&amp;#x259;ll&amp;#x259;r &amp;#124; Kataloq GoMap.Az|website=gomap.az|accessdate=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The birth and death dates of Sari Ahiq from the 17th century Azerbaijani ashugs are unknown. He was born in Garadaghli village in the XVII-XIX centuries on the right bank of the river [[Hakari (river)|Hakari]] and lived here and was buried in the village of Gulabird near Garadaghli village.

His imaginary appearance is engraved on the headstone of the grave. In 1927, archeologists conducted investigations in the Gulabird graveyard and the tomb, where the tomb of Sari Ashig was located, and concluded that the tombs belonged to the XVII century. "A good and the Ashig" epic was created among the people about the life of Sari Ashig. He is known mainly for his [[bayati]]s. He preferred this genre against those who said "bayati is women's business". He was also the author of many love poems, often used [[proverb]]s and saying them in his poems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Sarı Aşıq Xatirə Muzeyi |url= http://1905.az/sari-asiq-xatir%C9%99-muzeyi/|website= 1905.az|accessdate=1 February 2018|language=Azerbaijani}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The grave of Sari Ahig was completely destroyed in 1993 by [[Armenians]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2807">'''Neo-minimalism''' is an amorphous art movement of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. It has alternatively been called "neo-geometric" or "neo-geo" art.  Other terms include: [[Neo-conceptual art|Neo-Conceptualism]], [[Neo-Futurism]], Neo-Op, Neo-Pop, New Abstraction, Poptometry, Post-Abstractionism, Simulationism, and Smart Art.&lt;ref&gt;John Albert Walker, ''Glossary of Art, Architecture, and Design Since 1945'', Third edition, New York, G. K. Hall, 1992; p. 443.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art==
The aspects of "postmodern art" that have been described as neo-minimalism (and related terms) involve a general "reevaluation of earlier art forms."&lt;ref&gt;Fred S. Kleiner and Christin J. Mamiya, ''Gardner's Art Through the Ages: The Western Perspective'', Twelfth edition, Thomson / Wadsworth, 2005; Vol. 2, p. 844.&lt;/ref&gt;  As its various titles indicate, the movement draws on earlier mid-to-late-20th century developments in [[Minimalist art]], [[Abstract Expressionism]] and its [[Post-painterly Abstraction|offshoots]], plus [[Pop Art]], [[Op Art]], and other threads of artistic development.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.museumstuff.com/learn/topics/Neo-minimalism&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary artists who have been linked to the term, or who have been included in shows employing it, include [[Peter Halley]], [[Philip Taaffe]], [[Lorenzo Belenguer]], [[Ashley Bickerton]], David Burdeny, Paul Kuhn, Eve Leader, [[Peter Schuyff]], [[Christopher Willard]] and [[Tim Zuck]]. The steel sculptures of [[Richard Serra]] have been described as "austere neo-Minimalism...."&lt;ref&gt;Casey Nelson Blake, "An Atmosphere of Effrontery," in: ''The Power of Culture: Critical Essays in American History'', Richard Wightman Fox and [[T. J. Jackson Lears]], eds., Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1993; p. 259 n. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and music==
Beyond painting, sculpture and other "museum art," the term has been applied to architecture, design, and music.&lt;ref&gt;''Cadence: The American Review of Jazz and Blues'', Vol. 14 (1988), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; In architecture, indeed, neo-minimalism has been identified as a part of "the new orthodoxy...."&lt;ref&gt;Brooke Hodge, ed., ''Not Architecture But Evidence That It Exists'', Princeton, NJ, Princeton University Press, 1999; p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

"After the bacchanal of [[Postmodernism|post-modernism]], the time has again come for neo-minimalism, neo-ascetism, neo-denial and sublime poverty."&lt;ref&gt;Juhani Pallasmaa, ''Architecture in Miniature'', Museum of Finnish Architecture, 1991; p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''New Directions for Women''''' was an important early [[feminism|feminist]] newspaper.  It began as a [[mimeograph]]ed newsletter in 1972 in [[New Jersey]], but soon expanded into a tabloid-sized quarterly newspaper. Edited by Paula Kassell of Dover, a member of the Morristown chapter of [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW), the paper offered news reports from a feminist perspective as well as book reviews, [[women's history]] articles, and editorials, and was the first national feminist newspaper in the United States. After years of struggling to attain financial stability, the newspaper discontinued publishing in 1993.&lt;ref name="shs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shs.umsystem.edu/manuscripts/invent/4031.pdf|title=Records of New Directions for Women|publisher=[[State Historical Society of Missouri]]|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Townsend, Cara.

{{for|a later Park Theatre in Manhattan (aka Herald Square Theatre)|New Park Theatre}}

The '''Park Theatre''', originally known as the '''New Theatre''', was a [[Theater (structure)|playhouse]] in New York City, located at 21, 23, and 25 [[Park Row (Manhattan)|Park Row]], about {{convert|200|ft|m}} east of Ann Street and backing [[Theatre Alley]]. The location, at the north end of the city, overlooked the park that would soon house [[New York City Hall|City Hall]]. French architect [[Marc Isambard Brunel]] collaborated with fellow émigré [[Joseph-François Mangin]] and his brother Charles on the design of the building in the 1790s. Construction costs mounted to precipitous levels, and changes were made in the design; the resulting theatre had a rather plain exterior. The doors opened in January 1798.

In its early years, the Park enjoyed little to no competition in New York City. Nevertheless, it rarely made a profit for its owners or managers, prompting them to sell it in 1805. Under the management of [[Stephen Price (theatre manager)|Stephen Price]] and [[Edmund Simpson]] in the 1810s and 1820s, the Park enjoyed its most successful period. Price and Simpson initiated a [[star system (film)|star system]] by importing English talent and providing the theatre a veneer of [[upper class|upper-class]] respectability. Rivals such as the [[Chatham Garden Theatre|Chatham Garden]] and [[Bowery Theatre|Bowery]] theatres appeared in the 1820s, and the Park had to adapt to survive. [[Blackface]] acts and [[melodrama]] squeezed [[Italian opera]] and English drama out of their preferential positions. Nevertheless, the theatre maintained its upscale image until it burned down in 1848.

==Construction==
[[Image:Park Theatre concept design.jpg|thumb|right|Architectural rendering of the Park Theatre. The design had to be abandoned during construction due to budget constraints.]]
In the late 18th century, New York's only playhouse was the decaying and increasingly low-brow [[John Street Theatre (Manhattan)|John Street Theatre]]. Tired of attending such an establishment, a group of wealthy New Yorkers began planning the construction of a new playhouse in 1795.&lt;ref&gt;Barnham:839&lt;/ref&gt; Investors bought 113 shares at $375 each to cover the estimated $42,375 cost. To plan the structure, the owners hired celebrated architect [[Marc Isambard Brunel]], a Frenchman who had fled to New York to avoid the [[Reign of Terror]] and was then the city's engineer. Part way through construction, however, the project ran out of money. The owners sold more shares for what would eventually mount to a construction cost of more than $130,000.&lt;ref&gt;Nagler:522-4&lt;/ref&gt; 
As a cost-saving measure, Brunel's exterior design for the building was not implemented. The resulting three-story structure measured {{convert|80|ft|m}} wide by {{convert|165|ft|m}} deep and was made of plain dressed stone. The overall effect was an air of austerity.&lt;ref&gt;Nagler:522-4&lt;/ref&gt; The interiors, on the other hand, were quite lavish. The building followed the traditional European style of placing a [[auditorium|gallery]] over three tiers of [[box (theatre)|boxes]], which overlooked the U-shaped pit.&lt;ref&gt;Barnham:839&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early management==
The section of Manhattan where the theatre stood was not stylish: the New Theatre, as it was called, was neighbor to [[Bridewell (New York City jail)|Bridewell Prison]], a [[tent city]]'s worth of squatters, and the local [[poorhouse]].&lt;ref&gt;Henderson:49-52&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lewis Hallam, Jr.]], and [[John Hodgkinson (actor, born 1766)|John Hodgkinson]], both members of the John Street Theatre company, obtained the building's lease. They hired remnants of the Colonial [[Old American Company]] to form the nucleus of the theatre's in-house troupe and thus give the establishment the sheen of tradition and American culture.&lt;ref&gt;Bank:115&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the men quarreled, and construction continued languorously. The theatre finally held its first performance on January 29, 1798, despite still being under construction. The gross was an impressive $1,232, and, according to theatre historian [[T. Allston Brown]], hundreds of potential patrons had to be turned away.&lt;ref&gt;Brown:12&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Park Theatre interior.jpg|thumb|right|Interior of the Park Theatre]]
New York newspapers generally praised the New Theatre:

&lt;blockquote&gt;On Monday evening last, the New Theatre was opened to the most overflowing house that was ever witnessed in this city. Though the Commissioners have been constrained to open it in an unfinished state, it still gave high satisfaction.
{{br|2}}
The essential requisites of hearing and seeing have been happily attained. We do not remember to have been in any Theatre where the view of the stage is so complete from all parts of the house, or where the actors are heard with such distinctness. The house is made to contain about 2,000 persons. The audience part, though wanting in those brilliant decorations which the artists have designed for it, yet exhibited a neatness and simplicity which were highly agreeable. The stage was everything that could be wished. The scenery was executed in a most masterly style. The extensiveness of the scale upon which the scenes are executed, the correctness of the designs, and the elegance of the painting, presented the  most beautiful views which the imagination can conceive. The scenery was of itself worth a visit to the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;''The Daily Advertiser and the Commercial Advertiser'', 31 Jan 1798, quoted in Nagler:423&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The theatre offered performances on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. [[William Dunlap]] eventually joined the management team. Hallam parted mid-season, and Hodgkinson waited for season's end before doing the same. Dunlap remained as sole proprietor; his expenses were so great that he had to make at least $1,200 per week to break even.&lt;ref&gt;Nagler:524&lt;/ref&gt; He left in 1805 after declaring bankruptcy. After a few more failed managers, the owners sold the theatre to [[John Jacob Astor]] and John Beekman in 1805. These men kept it until its demolition in 1848.&lt;ref&gt;Nagler:522&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Park as high culture==
Over three months in 1807, English-born architect John Joseph Holland remodeled the theatre's interior. He added [[gas lighting]], coffee rooms, roomier boxes, and a repainted ceiling.

After acquiring a controlling interest in the theatre, [[Stephen Price (theatre manager)|Stephen Price]] became manager in 1808. He instituted a [[star system (film)|star system]], whereby he paid English actors and actresses to play [[English drama]]s there. Price spent much time in England, including four years (1826–1830) as manager of the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]], where he recruited successful actors for the Park and for a circuit of theatres in other American cities. During this period, Price left much of the operating management of the theatre to [[Edmund Simpson]]. The Park at this point was already known for high-class entertainments, but Price and Simpson's policies helped to reinforce this as they booked English drama, [[Italian opera]], and other [[upper class|upper-class]] bills, such as actress [[Clara Fisher]]. Price and Simpson also fostered the careers of many American performers, including [[Edwin Forrest]] and [[Charlotte Cushman]].

The Park burned down in May 1820, and was entirely destroyed except for its exterior walls. The owners rebuilt the following year, and reopened in September 1821.

[[Image:Park Theatre exterior.jpg|thumb|right|The Park Theatre c. late 1820s. The theatre had been rebuilt after burning down in 1820. Neighboring buildings include the City Coffee House, Sweeney's Porter House, the Theatre Hotel, and other commercial establishments.]]
In the early 1820s, the New Theatre was New York's only theatre, and the lack of competition allowed the theatre to enjoy its most profitable period.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson:51&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chatham Garden Theatre]] was built in 1823 and provided the first real challenge to the Park's primacy; the [[Bowery Theatre]] followed in 1826. The New Theatre, having lost its newness, became known as the Park Theatre around this time. At first, each of the rivals aimed for the same upper-class audience. However, by the late 1820s and early 1830s, the Bowery and Chatham Garden had begun to cater to a more [[working class|working-class]] clientele. In comparison, the Park became the theatre of choice for ''bon ton''.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson:49&lt;/ref&gt; This was helped by the evolution of its neighborhood. New York home owners had steadily moved northward from [[Bowling Green (New York City)|Bowling Green]] so that by this point, the Park stood in an upper-class residential area and fronted City Hall and a large park.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson:50&lt;/ref&gt; Coffeehouses and hotels soon followed.

Despite its upper-class luster, however, some commentators found due cause to criticize the Park. In her landmark book, ''[[Domestic Manners of the Americans]]'', the British writer [[Frances Trollope]] gave a mixed review:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The piece was extremely well got up, and on this occasion we saw the Park Theatre to advantage, for it was filled with well-dressed company; but still we saw many 'yet unrazored lips' polluted with the grim tinge of hateful tobacco, and heard, without ceasing, the spitting, which of course is its consequence. If their theaters had the orchestra of the Feydeau, and a choir of angels to boot, I could find but little pleasure, so long as they were followed by this running accompaniment of ''thorough base''.&lt;ref&gt;Trollope:263-4; emphasis in original&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Final years==
[[File:Park Row and Park Theatre (Manhattan) - desaturated version.jpg|thumb|right|Another view, ca. 1831.]]

By the late 1830s, [[blackface]] acts and Bowery-style [[melodrama]] had come to eclipse traditional drama in popularity for New York audiences. Simpson adapted, booking more novelty acts and entertainments that emphasized [[spectacle]] over high culture.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson:51&lt;/ref&gt; The patronage changed, as well, as the ''[[New York Herald]]'' noted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;On Friday night the Park Theatre contained 83 of the most profligate and abandoned women that ever disgraced humanity; they entered in the same door, and for a time mixed indiscriminately with 63 virtuous and respectable ladies.... Men of New York, take not your wives and daughters to the Park Theatre, until Mr. Simpson pays some respect to them by constructing a separate entrance for the abandoned of the sex.&lt;ref&gt;"Morning Herald: …"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nevertheless, the theatre's traditional patronage continued to support it, and the Park largely maintained its high-class reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson:52&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edgar Allan Poe]] wrote a more critical editorial in the ''[[Broadway Journal]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;The well-trained company of rats at the Park Theatre understand, it is said, their cue perfectly. It is worth the price of admission to see their performance. By long training they know precisely the time when the curtain rises, and the exact degree in which the audience is spellbound by what is going on. At the sound of the bell [signaling the start of the show] they sally out; scouring the pit for chance peanuts and orange-peel. When, by the rhyming couplets, they are made aware that the curtain is about to fall, they disappear—through the intensity of the performers. A profitable engagement might be made, we think, with "the celebrated Dog Bill [part of [[William Washington Cole|William Cole]]'s act in [[P. T. Barnum]]'s American Museum].&lt;ref&gt;Poe's ''Broadway Journal'', 1 November 1845, quoted in Poe:454&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Park Theatre was finally destroyed by fire on December 16, 1848. The [[Astor family]] opted not to rebuild it, the more fashionable clientele having moved north to [[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]] and [[Fifth Avenue]]; instead they had stores constructed on the site.

'''''Partonopeus de Blois''''' is a long poem in the [[chivalric romance]] genre written in [[Old French]] in the 1170s or 1180s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/partonopeus/generalintroduction.htm Introduction to ''Partonopeus de Blois''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505003452/http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/partonopeus/generalintroduction.htm |date=2015-05-05 }} at Humanities Research Institute at University of Sheffield (website also has the full text of the poem). Concerning the dating of the poem: "One view is that it was first written around 1170, while another is that it dates from the mid 1180s. This question of dating is bound up with another, namely whether ''Partonopeus'' influenced the work of the most famous writer of Old French romance, Chrétien de Troyes, or the other way around." In either case, it is widely accepted nowadays that the poem was completed at or before 1188.&lt;/ref&gt; Its author is unknown (possibly [[Denis Pyramus]] was the author).

==Plot==

Partenopeus is represented as having lived in the days of [[Clovis I|Clovis, king of France]]. He is seized while hunting in the [[Ardennes]], and carried off to a mysterious castle with invisible inhabitants. Melior, empress of [[Constantinople]], comes to him at night, stipulating that he must not attempt to see her for two and a half years. After successfully fighting against the Saracens, led by Sornegur, king of Denmark, he returns to the castle, armed with an enchanted lantern that breaks the spell. The consequent misfortunes have a happy ending.

The tale had a continuation giving the adventures of Fursin or Anselet, the nephew of Sornegur.

==Analogues==
The tale is in essence a variant of the legend of [[Cupid and Psyche]]. The name Partonopeus (or Partonopex) is generally assumed to be a corruption of [[Parthenopaeus]], one of the [[Seven against Thebes]], but it has been suggested that the word might be linked to Partenay, due to the points of similarity between this story and the legend of [[Melusine]] (see [[Jean d'Arras]]) attached to the house of [[Lusignan]], as the lords of these two places were connected. The story has also been compared with the [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] story of ''[[Le Bel Inconnu]]''.

The romance, or a subsequent version of it, was translated into Old Norse as ''[[Chivalric sagas|Partalópa saga]]''.

[[File:Peep Show by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|Exterior of a [[sex shop]] in [[New York City]] that also provides a peep show]]

A '''peep show''' or '''peepshow''' is an exhibition of pictures, objects or people viewed through a small hole or [[magnifying glass]]. Though historically a peep show was a form of entertainment provided by wandering showmen, nowadays it more commonly refers to a presentation of a [[sex show]] or [[pornographic film]] which is viewed through a viewing slot. Historically the peep hole was intended to control the point of view to allow an illusion of [[depth perception]], while showmen would later use it to charge for access to the view. For sex shows it also became a means to view material that would be objected to if freely displayed.

==History==
[[File:Adolph Glasbrenner Guckkästner.jpg|thumb|left|175px|A boy looks into a peep show device (illustration by [[Theodor Hosemann]], 1835)]]
Peep shows,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Weynants, [http://www.visual-media.eu/vue-optique.html "From the Rarekiek, 17th. &amp; 18th. Century optical entertainment, to the birth of Television"]
&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''peep box''' or '''raree show''' ("rarity show") can be traced back to the [[early modern period]] (15th century in Europe) and are known in various cultures. 
Around 1437 Italian humanist author, artist, architect, poet, priest, linguist, philosopher and cryptographer [[Leon Battista Alberti]] is thought to have created the earliest impressive peep show boxes with painted pictures to be viewed through a small hole. He had two kinds: night scenes with the moon and stars, and day scenes. It is thought these pictures may have been transparent and lit from behind, possibly changing from day to night by changing the lighting. It has also been suggested that it may have been a predecessor of the [[magic lantern]] that could project images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theodora.com/encyclopedia/c/camera_obscura.html|title=Camera Obscura - Encyclopedia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/peep-show-childrens-toy|title=Peep show - children’s toy|author=|date=|website=britannica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 17th and 18th century peep shows were exhibited on streets and fairs across Europe by itinerant showmen, competing with other entertainment like dancing bears, jugglers, conjurers, et cetera.&lt;ref name=balzer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dickbalzer.com/Peepshows.202.0.html|title=Dick Balzer's Website: Peepshows|first=Richard|last=Balzer|date=|website=www.dickbalzer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their wooden cabinets could have several viewing holes and contain sets of pictures to be set into a viewing position by pulling a corresponding string. The show was accompanied by spoken [[recitation]] that explained or dramatized what was happening inside. The boxes were often decorated inside to resemble theatrical scenes.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} 

Peep shows were most popular in the 17th century in Holland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100313907|title=Peep-show box - Oxford Reference|author=|date=|website=oxfordreference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some artists from the 17th-century [[Dutch Golden Age painting]], like [[Pieter Janssens Elinga]] and [[Samuel Dirksz van Hoogstraten]] created a type of peep shows with an illusion of depth perception by manipulating the perspective of the view seen inside, usually the interior of a room.
From around 1700 many of these "perspective boxes" or "optica" had a bi-convex lens with a large diameter and small dioptre for an exaggerated perspective, giving a stronger illusion of depth. Most pictures showed architectural and topographical subjects with linear perspectives.&lt;ref name=visualmedia&gt;{{cite web|title=Peepshow|url=http://www.visual-media.eu/vue-optique.html|website=visual-media.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dutch Perspectives|last1=Wagenaar|last2=Duller|last3=Wagenaar-Fischer}}&lt;/ref&gt; From around 1745 similar perspective view prints became very popular for the [[zograscope]], which used the same principle with the lens on a stand rather than in a box.   
Peep shows were further developed with translucent painting techniques, perforations and cut-out shapes that provided special effects when lit from behind by candles. Changing the light from the front to the back of the picture could change the scene from day to night, much like the [[dissolving views]] that would later become a popular type of magic lantern show.&lt;ref name=visualmedia/&gt;

In the early 18th century the perspective boxes were very appreciated in Japan, where they were referred to as ''Holland machines''.&lt;ref name=balzer/&gt; They may have been imported from China earlier than from The Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/TowardAStudentBasedApproachToTranslationTeaching/toward+a+student-based+approach+to+translation+teaching_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "Toward A Student Based Approach To Translation Teaching"|author=|date=|website=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

19th-century Chinese peep shows were known by many names including ''la yang p'ien'' ({{zh|c=拉洋片|p=lā yáng piān|l=pulling foreign picture cards}}). Sometimes the showman would perform for a crowd with [[puppet]]s or [[cantastoria|pictures]] outside the box and then charge people extra to look through the holes.
In [[Ottoman Syria]] a form of peep show called ''sanduk al-ajayib'' ("wonder box") existed, which the storyteller carried on his back. The box had six holes through which people could see scenes backlit by a central candle. ''Sanduk al-ajayib'' stories were about contemporary figures and events, or showed scenes of heaven and hell.&lt;ref&gt;* Mair, Victor H. ''Painting and Performance: Chinese Picture Recitation and its Indian Genesis.'' Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other common subjects in peep shows throughout the world have been exotic views and animals, scenes of classical drama or [[masque]]s, [[Noble court|court]] ceremonies, surprise transformations (e.g., of an angel into a devil) and of course, lewd pictures.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}
[[File:DonaldsonvillePeepShow1938.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A man peers into the viewer of a peepshow at a State Fair in 1938]]

Raree shows were precursors of [[toy theatre]]s, with movable scenes and paper figurines, popular in the 19th century. They can also be seen as predecessors to [[optical toys]] like [[Chinese fireworks]], the [[diorama]], the [[stereoscope]] and the [[magic lantern]].&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

Some peep shows offer the only accurate representation of the stage design and scenery of the [[masque]]s and pageants of their time.&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

==Pornographic shows==
Peep shows have been used for erotic and pornographic pictures, such as ''[[What the Butler Saw (mutoscope)|What the Butler Saw]]'', since before the turn of the twentieth century. 

In contemporary use, a peep show is a piecewise presentation of [[pornographic film]]s or a live [[sex show]] which is viewed through a viewing slot, which shuts after the time paid for has expired. The viewing slots can be operated by a money box device, or paid for at a counter. 
[[File:Peep show Iran.JPG|thumbnail|Peep show in [[Golestan Palace]], [[Tehran]]]]
For live peep shows, booths can surround a stage upon which usually a female performer performs a [[striptease]] and sexually explicit poses. In [[Barcelona]] female performers at times also perform sexual intercourse with male performers on stage. In some cases, booths include [[paper towel dispenser]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Jon Griffin Donlon, "Peep Shows," ''St. James Encyclopedia of Pop Culture''. According to Dr. Elliot Chiu, "At first, small booths with a seat, a lock, and a roll of paper towels were made available for individual viewing of 8 or 16 mm stag loops or for access to a usually circular 'stage' with living performers."&lt;/ref&gt; for customers who engage in masturbation. A customer and performer can mutually agree on a fee for a "private dance", which can take place in a peep show booth with a clear window and seating space for only one spectator.

Research on peep show establishments in California&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Linz, Bryant Paul, and Mike Z. Yao, "Peep show establishments, police activity, public place, and time: A study of secondary effects in San Diego, California", ''The Journal of Sex Research'', May 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; examined the hypothesis that neighborhoods surrounding [[sex business]]es such as peep show establishments and [[X-rated]] movie stores have higher rates of crime. The researchers compared 911 calls in peep show and control neighborhoods in San Diego.  Although peep show neighborhoods had approximately 16 percent more calls, the researchers concluded that the difference was not statistically significant.  Other researchers reanalyzed the data and concluded that the difference was significant.&lt;ref&gt;Richard McCleary and James W. Meeker, "Do peep shows 'cause' crime?", ''The Journal of Sex Research'', May 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Regal Show World====
Regal Show World was an [[adult entertainment]] business on lower [[Market Street (San Francisco)|Market Street]] in [[San Francisco, California]].&lt;ref name="EDA"/&gt; The company's [[slogan]] was "Where you are king".&lt;ref name="LNG"/&gt; The business had a peep show and an [[adult video arcade]].&lt;ref name="EDA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Davidson 2012 p. 159"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alta-glamour.com"/&gt; The peep show had performers working in an enclosed round room with viewing booths surrounding it and sometimes had a "double in the bubble" show in which two performers worked simultaneously.&lt;ref name="LNG"/&gt; During the winter of 1997 to 1998, the business had thirty-five performers.&lt;ref name="EDA"/&gt; At this time, over 80% of performers there attempted to [[unionize]] and "signed union authorization cards for representation by the [[Service Employees International Union]] (SEIU), Local 790".&lt;ref name="EDA"/&gt;

The business was owned by Bijou Group, Inc., a [[privately held company]] in San Francisco that was founded in 1990.&lt;ref name="Manta"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Find"/&gt; Bijou Group owned similar businesses in San Francisco such as New Century Theater, [[Market Street Cinema]], and the Campus Theater.&lt;ref name="EDA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nearby Café 1995"/&gt; Bijou Group, Inc. filed for [[Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] reorganization circa 1994.&lt;ref name="Nearby Café 1995"/&gt; In November 1998, management of Regal Show World announced that the peep show would be closed on November 30th of that month due to "economic reasons".&lt;ref name="EDA"/&gt; At the time, some performers in the industry stated that closure of the peep show was done as a retaliative measure against attempts for performers to unionize.&lt;ref name="EDA"/&gt; The company declared bankruptcy after performers made a second attempt at unionization, whereby the performers "signed cards calling for a union election", and the theater was closed.&lt;ref name="TPOS"/&gt;

===Washington===
The former [[Lusty Lady]] peep show in San Francisco, California, entered the news in 1997, when it became the first U.S. sex business to be [[unionized]]. In 2003 it was bought by the employees and became a [[worker cooperative]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

[[File:RIBA SIlver Medal.jpg|thumb|The RIBA SIlver Medal is awarded annually by the Royal Institute of British Architects to a student or recent graduate of Architecture.]]

==History==
The [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (RIBA) has been awarding the President's Medals annually since 1836, the year when George Godwin was awarded the Honorary Silver Medal for his essay 'Nature and Properties of Concrete, and its Application to Construction up to the Current Period'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The History|url=http://www.presidentsmedals.com/history.aspx|accessdate=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medals are awarded in three categories: the Bronze Medal for best design project at RIBA Part 1 or equivalent; the Silver Medal for best design project at RIBA Part 2 or equivalent, and the Dissertation Medal (written during either Part 1 or Part 2).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidentsmedals.com/prizes.aspx|title=Prizes 2012|accessdate=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judges also award up to three commendations in each category, and the Serjeant Awards for Excellence in Drawing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A glimpse of the future|url=http://www.worldarchitecturenews.com/index.php?fuseaction=wanappln.projectview&amp;upload_id=18781|accessdate=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the RIBA’s oldest awards (preceding the [[Royal Gold Medal]], which was formally established in 1848), the [http://www.presidentsmedals.com/ RIBA President’s Medals] continue to this day to embody the Institute’s commitment to architecture and the education of individuals into understanding architecture's wider social benefits.

The '''River North Gallery District'''  or simply '''River North''', in [[Chicago]], is in the [[Near North Side, Chicago]].  It hosts the largest concentration of [[Contemporary art gallery|art galleries]] in the [[United States]] outside of [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.chicagomarathon.com/CMS400Min/Chicago_Marathon/runner_information/index.aspx?id=486 | title = 2007 LaSalle Bank Chicago Marathon Runner Information | work = www.chicagomarathon.com | publisher = LaSalle Bank | year = 2007 | accessdate = 2007-08-12 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111012212715/http://www.chicagomarathon.com/CMS400Min/Chicago_Marathon/runner_information/index.aspx?id=486 | archivedate = 2011-10-12 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
River North has experienced vast changes in the years 1990 - 2012 including the development of vast highrise buildings, nightclubs and restaurants.   River North has become one of Chicago's top neighborhoods for nightlife especially on and around Hubbard Street.

A common definition puts the River North neighborhood in the area north of the Chicago River and the [[Merchandise Mart]], south of [[Division Street (Chicago)|Division Street]], east of the Chicago River and west of Wabash Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rivernorthassociation.com|title=River North Business Association - RNBA - Home|website=www.rivernorthassociation.com|access-date=2016-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with hundreds of art galleries, the area holds many bars, dance clubs, popular restaurants and entertainment venues. Subsections of River North include:

* The Gallery District, the district designated by the City, primarily along Chicago, Superior and Huron streets between Lasalle and Orleans.  As it has grown and the area has gentrified, galleries can also now be found west of Orleans and east of LaSalle, though the core area still contains the highest concentration of galleries.
* The Contemporaine Building - 2005 AIA Honor Awards For Architecture site: [http://www.signaturestpete.com/uploads/NYT_102404_Contemporaine.pdf], site: [http://www.aia.org/SiteObjects/files/Fact-Contemporaine.pdf]
* A design district, with shops and showrooms selling commercial and luxury interior furnishings, in the blocks north of the Merchandise Mart.
* Kingsbury Park, an area of newly built residential high-rises surrounding Erie Park, at Erie Street and the Chicago River.

==History==

===Smokey Hollow===

River North was named Smokey Hollow around the turn of the 20th century due to the many factories and forges in the area. The smoke was often so thick that sunlight was blocked. At the time Smokey Hollow was a major transportation hub with railroad tracks linking the ports along the Chicago River with the surrounding areas. The Merchandise Mart still has railroad tracks underneath the building.  Massive [[coal bin]]s were throughout the neighborhood both bringing coal into the area from ships and storage for the multitude of factories and forges in River North. The Merchandise Mart was a major storage warehouse for goods. The Merchandise Mart was later purchased by the Kennedy family. Former retailer Montgomery Ward also had a major transportation and storage facility in River North.

===Little Sicily===

Little Sicily in Chicago was also located in River North.  The city's first Italian Roman Catholic Church in Chicago was Assumption Parish on Illinois Street, with a mandate to be the Parish for all Italians living between Lake Michigan and the Mississippi River.  Later Sicilians began to move northward from the immediate vicinity of Assumption and began to form their own parishes. Italians whose family roots were from other parts of Italy tended to move west along Grand Street and formed Parishes west of Assumption.

===Prohibition===

In 1921, Dean O'Banion married Viola Kaniff and bought an interest in William Schofield's River North flower shop, near the corner of West Chicago Avenue and North State Street.  O'Banion needed a legitimate front for his bootlegging operation. In addition, he was fond of flowers and was an excellent arranger.

Schofield's became the florist of choice for many funerals.

The shop happened to be directly across the street from Holy Name Cathedral, where O'Banion and Weiss attended Mass. The rooms above Schofield's were used as the headquarters for the North Side Gang which controlled the bootlegging operations in what would later be called River North and the Gold Coast area of Chicago.

On the morning of November 10, 1924, O'Banion was clipping chrysanthemums in Schofield's back room. Frankie Yale entered the shop with Torrio and Capone gunmen John Scalise and Albert Anselmi. When O'Banion attempted to greet Yale with a handshake, Yale clasped O'Banion's hand in a death grip.    At the same time, Scalise and Anselmi fired two bullets into O'Banion's chest, two in his cheeks, and two in his throat and Dean O'Banion died instantly.

===Punk rock history===

One of the biggest punk rock clubs of the 1970s was located in River North - called O'Banion's after the infamous hit on Dean O'Banion.

The River North neighborhood fell on difficult times starting in the 1960s with many families moving into the suburbs to escape urban blight.  Many buildings were torn down and became parking lots. Crime was a dangerous part of daily life.

Assumption Church on Illinois Street during this time reported that many of its Parishioners had moved to the suburbs and that few people remained living within its Parish boundaries as established by the Archdiocese of Chicago. Assumption Parish survived during this time on Parishioners who traveled from the suburbs to attend Mass in the old neighborhood every Sunday.

===Development of the River North neighborhood===

[[Image:20090518 Trump International Hotel and Tower, Chicago.jpg|thumb|310px|[[Trump International Hotel and Tower (Chicago)|Trump International Hotel and Tower]] as viewed from the [[Chicago River]]]]

The River North neighborhood got its name from Chicago real estate developer Albert Friedman (chief executive of Friedman Properties Ltd.), who in 1974 started to buy, restore and build commercial property in the southeast sector.&lt;ref name=tribune11&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.chicagotribune.com/classified/realestate/communities/chi-river-north_chomes_0711jul11,0,1786787.story | title = River North: From gritty roots to urban chic | work = www.chicagotribune.com | publisher = Chicago Tribune | year = 2008 | accessdate = 2008-07-11 | first=Susan | last=Diesenhouse}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of the area was a [[skid row]] at the time, so in an effort to attract tenants Friedman started calling the area "River North".&lt;ref name=tribune11/&gt; Within a few years, Friedman found photographers, ad agencies and art galleries willing to rent the low cost space and coalesce into what is now the River North Gallery District,&lt;ref name=tribune11/&gt; which has the largest concentration of art galleries in the United States outside of Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.chicagomarathon.com/CMS400Min/Chicago_Marathon/runner_information/index.aspx?id=486 | title = 2007 LaSalle Bank Chicago Marathon Runner Information | work = www.chicagomarathon.com | publisher = LaSalle Bank | year = 2007 | accessdate = 2007-08-12 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111012212715/http://www.chicagomarathon.com/CMS400Min/Chicago_Marathon/runner_information/index.aspx?id=486 | archivedate = 2011-10-12 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent developments===
River North from 1990 to 2012 became one of Chicago's top neighborhoods for nightlife especially along Franklin Street and Hubbard Street. It is a top destination for restaurants, nightclubs and living for people who move to Chicago.  During this time numerous highrises have been developed, dramatically increasing the population of River North.

The '''Royal Gold Cup''' or '''Saint Agnes Cup''' is a solid [[gold]] covered cup lavishly decorated with [[vitreous enamel|enamel]] and [[pearl]]s. It was made for the [[John II of France#Family and children|French royal family]] at the end of the 14th century, and later belonged to several English monarchs before spending nearly 300 years in Spain. It has been in the [[British Museum]] since 1892, where it is normally on display in Room 40, and is generally agreed to be the outstanding surviving example of late medieval French plate. It has been described as "the one surviving royal magnificence of the [[International Gothic]] age";&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 78&lt;/ref&gt; and according to [[Thomas Hoving]], former director of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York, "of all the princely jewels and gold that have come down to us, this is the most spectacular—and that includes the great royal treasures."&lt;ref&gt;Hoving, 61, calling it the "Saint Agnes Cup"; in French it is always the ''Coupe de Saint Agnes'', as in Neil Stratford.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cup is made of solid gold, stands 23.6&amp;nbsp;cm (9.25&amp;nbsp;inches) high with a diameter of 17.8&amp;nbsp;cm (6.94&amp;nbsp;inches) at its widest point,&lt;ref&gt;"British Museum collection database"&lt;/ref&gt; and weighs 1.935&amp;nbsp;kg (4.26&amp;nbsp;lb).&lt;ref&gt;Dalton, 1; Steane, 135&lt;/ref&gt; It has a cover that lifts off, but the triangular stand on which it once stood is now lost. The stem of the cup has twice been extended by the addition of cylindrical bands, so that it was originally much shorter,&lt;ref&gt;There are illustrations of the original shape in Dalton's Figure 1 (drawing), and Cherry, p. 24 (edited photo, also in Henderson, 138). However, Neil Stratford, 263, raises the possibility that there was originally a longer stem.&lt;/ref&gt; giving the overall shape "a typically robust and stocky elegance."&lt;ref name="Lightbown, 81"&gt;Lightbown, 81&lt;/ref&gt; The original decorated knop or finial on the cover has been lost, and a moulding decorated with 36 pearls has been removed from the outer edge of the cover; a strip of gold with jagged edges can be seen where it was attached. Presumably it matched the one still in place round the foot of the cup.&lt;ref&gt;Dalton, 1, and Lightbown, 81–82. Neil Stratford, 263, adds that the hexagonal top of the cover is modern. See [[Royal Gold Cup#Provenance|Provenance]] section for the missing parts.&lt;/ref&gt;

The gold surfaces are decorated with scenes in ''[[basse-taille]]'' enamel with translucent colours that reflect light from the gold beneath; many areas of gold both underneath the enamel and in the background have [[engraving|engraved]] and ''[[pointillé]]'' decoration worked in the gold. In particular the decoration features large areas of translucent red, which have survived in excellent condition. This colour, known as ''rouge clair'', was the most difficult to achieve technically, and highly prized for this and the brilliance of the colour when it was done successfully.&lt;ref&gt;"British Museum Investigation"&lt;/ref&gt; Scenes from the life of [[Saint Agnes]] run round the top of the cover and the sloping underside of the main body. The [[Four Evangelists|symbols of the Four Evangelists]] run round the foot of the cup, and there are enamel medallions at the centre of the inside of both the cup and the cover. The lower of the two added bands contains enamel [[Tudor rose]]s on a [[Diapering|diapered]] pointillé background; this was apparently added under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry&amp;nbsp;VIII]]. The upper band has an engraved inscription filled in with black enamel, with a barrier of [[Bay Laurel|laurel]] branches in green to mark off the end of the inscription from its beginning.&lt;ref&gt;Dalton, 1–4; "British Museum collection database"&lt;/ref&gt;

The cup came to the British Museum with a custom-made [[hexagonal]] case of leather on a wood frame, with iron lock, handles and mounts. This was either made at the same time or soon after the cup, and has incised and stamped foliate decoration and a [[blackletter]] inscription: ''YHE.SUS.O.MARYA.O.MARYA YHE SUS''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=48782&amp;partid=1 Wood and leather case] British Museum collection database, accessed June 16, 2010.

There is no firm evidence as to the date and circumstances of the creation of the cup. It is first clearly documented in an inventory from 1391 of the valuables belonging to [[Charles&amp;nbsp;VI of France]] (reigned 1380–1422), surviving in two copies in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]].&lt;ref&gt;Dalton, 8–9. The inventories are BnF Mss Fr 21445 (f.1b) and 21446 (f.45b)&lt;/ref&gt; This lists:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A [[hanaper|hanap]] of gold, all its cover well and richly enamelled on the outside with the life of Madame St Agnes; and the cresting of the foot is garnished with 26 pearls, and the crown around the cover with 36 pearls; and the finial of the said cover (is) garnished with four sapphires, three [[Spinel|balas rubies]] and fifteen pearls. And it weighs 9 [[Mark (mass)|marcs]] 3 ounces of gold. and the said hanap rests on a stand of gold in the form of a tripod, and in the middle of the tripod is represented [[Virgin Mary|Our Lady]] in a sun on a ground of clear red, and the three feet of the tripod are formed by three winged dragons. The said hanap and cover were given to the king by monseigneur the duc de Berry on his journey into [[Touraine]] in the year 91.&lt;ref&gt;Translation from Dalton, 8–9. Crucially, the number of pearls around the foot agrees with the current number. A "marc" is approximately 249 [[gram]]s, so allowing for the changes to the cup, the weight given is consistent. The stand weighed 3 marcs and 5{{frac|1|2}} ounces. See also Jenny Stratford, 320&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:John, Duke of Bedford (detail) - British Library Add MS 18850 f256v.jpg|thumb|left|210px|[[John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford]], kneeling, was the first English owner of the cup. Detail from a miniature by the [[Bedford Master]]]]
[[John, Duke of Berry]] (1340–1416) was Charles VI's uncle and a powerful figure in the kingdom, as well as the most famous and extravagant collector and commissioner of art of his day. He is still best known for commissioning the ''[[Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]]'', the famous International Gothic [[illuminated manuscript]], and also commissioned the [[Holy Thorn Reliquary]], now in the British Museum.&lt;ref&gt;Cherry, 39–43&lt;/ref&gt; The young king Charles had been forced to remove his uncle from governorships after the latter's rapacious conduct had led to unrest, and the meeting in 1391 marked their reconciliation after a period of bad relations.&lt;ref&gt;Dalton, 9&lt;/ref&gt; Lavish gifts among the [[House of Valois|Valois]] court circle were routine,&lt;ref&gt;The subject of Buettner's article; Cherry, 47, gives alarming statistics&lt;/ref&gt; and on this occasion Berry had special reason to be generous.

The cup appears in another inventory of Charles&amp;nbsp;VI in 1400,&lt;ref name="Jenny Stratford, 320"&gt;Jenny Stratford, 320&lt;/ref&gt; and then is not recorded until it appears as the property of another royal uncle, and collector, [[John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford]] (1389–1435), son of [[Henry IV of England|Henry&amp;nbsp;IV]], who was briefly Regent of both France and England for his infant nephew [[Henry VI of England|Henry&amp;nbsp;VI]]. How he acquired the cup is not known, but he would have received many gifts from Charles&amp;nbsp;VI, and had both lent the king money and bought from him things such as the library of the [[Louvre Palace|Palais du Louvre]],&lt;ref&gt;Dalton, 10; Jenny Stratford 60–61, on the cup between 1400 and entering Bedford's possession, and generally on Bedford's property.&lt;/ref&gt; in the uneasy period when Charles had made peace with the English and made [[Henry V of England|Henry&amp;nbsp;V]] his heir. After the death of his brother Henry&amp;nbsp;V, Bedford [[Hundred Years' War (1415–1429)|struggled to stem]] the resurgent French resistance, which was energised by [[Joan of Arc]]. He died in [[Normandy]] in 1435, leaving Henry&amp;nbsp;VI as his heir.&lt;ref&gt;Jenny Stratford's book is on Bedford's inventories, and includes a brief biography (Chapter 1) and chapter 5 on him as a "Patron and Collector"; Dalton, 10&lt;/ref&gt;

The cup is more briefly described as the first item in a list of valuables received from Bedford's estate prepared for Henry VI's minister Cardinal [[Henry Beaufort]], but the tripod is not mentioned, some of the jewels are missing, and the subject is misidentified as the life of Saint Suzanna not Saint Agnes. For some reason it does not appear in a royal inventory of 1441;&lt;ref&gt;Jenny Stratford, 319–325; Dalton, 8. It is the only surviving piece of metalwork from the list (J. Stratford, 319)&lt;/ref&gt; Jenny Stratford suggests that this was because Beaufort still had it at this point.&lt;ref&gt;Jenny Stratford, 48&lt;/ref&gt;  Another possibility is that it had been pawned, as it was in 1449 and again in 1451, on both occasions to finance England's [[Hundred Years' War#French victory: 1429–1453|increasingly unsuccessful efforts]] to hold on to French territory;&lt;ref name="D8"&gt;Dalton, 8&lt;/ref&gt;

The cup first appears in the records of the new [[Tudor dynasty]] under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry&amp;nbsp;VIII]] in 1521. By now the cover had lost the finial "garnished with four sapphires, three balas rubies and fifteen pearls" described in Charles VI's inventory and had a new one of gold in the form of a closed, or "imperial" crown. This matches a propaganda drive at this time by Henry to assert England as an "empire", a contemporary sense meaning a state recognising no superior, though the [[Great Seal of England]] had already used a closed crown since 1471.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Stratford, 261&lt;/ref&gt; Other uses had probably been found for the jewels of the old finial; it is assumed that the lower band with the Tudor roses was added in Henry's reign,&lt;ref&gt;Dalton, 1, 8&lt;/ref&gt; as part of a programme of adding Tudor badges to possessions inherited from earlier dynasties, which covered [[tapestries]], [[illuminated manuscripts]] and buildings such as [[King's College Chapel]] in [[Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;Anglo, 198-199&lt;/ref&gt;  The cup is described in inventories in 1532 and [[Inventory of Henry VIII of England|after Henry's death in 1547]], and then under [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth&amp;nbsp;I]] it was inventoried in 1574 and 1596.&lt;ref&gt;Dalton 8, Jenny Stratford, 324, 320; the cup appears in all known Tudor inventories of the royal plate.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The Somerset House Conference, 1604 from NPG.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Somerset House Conference]] representatives in August 1604; Spanish on the left, English on the right. [[Juan Fernández de Velasco, 5th Duke of Frías|The Constable of Castile]] is nearest the window on the left.]]

When [[James I of England|James&amp;nbsp;I]] succeeded to the English throne in 1603, one of his first priorities was to end the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585)|Anglo-Spanish War]], which had been dragging on since 1585. A Spanish delegation arrived for the [[Treaty of London (1604)|Somerset House Conference]], which concluded with a treaty signed in 1604. The leader of the [[Habsburg]] diplomats was [[Juan Fernández de Velasco, 5th Duke of Frías]] and [[Constable of Castile]]. The upper extension to the stem of the cup has a Latin inscription that translates as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;This cup of solid gold, a relic of the sacred treasure of England and a memorial to the peace made between the kings, the Constable Juan de Velasco, returning thence after successfully accomplishing his mission, presented as an offering to Christ the Peacemaker.&lt;ref&gt;Translation "British Museum collection database". Dalton has the reading "sacred (royal) treasure", p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The gift of "some 70 items of silver and gold plate" by James to the Constable, of which the cup was the most notable item, is documented on both the English and Spanish sides;&lt;ref&gt;Ungerer, quoted here, has details and references&lt;/ref&gt; the Constable wrote an account of his mission on his return, which mentions the gift from James. The Constable had previously presented both James and the queen with elaborate cups, among other valuable gifts.&lt;ref&gt;Dalton, 6. Ungerer describes several surviving [[bills of exchange]]; most of the Spanish gifts were bought in the [[Spanish Netherlands]].&lt;/ref&gt; According to Pauline Croft, "With his usual over-generosity the king gave the departing envoys around half the large gold vessels from the royal possessions he had inherited from Elizabeth. The Constable himself received a stupendous gift of plate, including possibly the most venerable item in the collection, known as "the Royal Gold Cup of the Kings of France and England."&lt;ref&gt;Croft&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1610 the Constable gave the cup to a convent in [[Medina de Pomar]], near [[Burgos]], as the inscription describes.&lt;ref&gt;Jenny Stratford, 325, has an extract from the list of gifts.&lt;/ref&gt; His deed of gift survives, and records that the gift was on condition that the cup was never alienated by the convent. A marginal note on the deed, in the Constable's own handwriting, records that he had obtained the permission of the [[Archbishop of Toledo]], [[Bernardo de Sandoval y Rojas]], for the cup to be used as a [[Ciborium (container)|ciborium]], or container for consecrated [[Sacramental bread|hosts]]. By this period a rule of the church normally forbade the use of vessels decorated on their inner surface as ciboria.&lt;ref name="D6"&gt;Dalton, 6&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:British Museum RGC base crop.jpg|thumb|left|The foot of the cup]]

The cup stayed in the convent until 1882 when the nuns were short of funds and wanted to sell it. It was at some point during this period that the pearl border to the cover and the Tudor finial were removed.&lt;ref name="Jenny Stratford, 320"/&gt; The nuns decided they would get a better price in Paris than in Spain, and the cup was entrusted to Simon Campo, a priest, who took it to Paris and approached several leading dealers and collectors. There had been a spate of forgeries of medieval objects, and the Parisians were suspicious, until one, Baron [[Jérôme Pichon]], researched the second added cylinder and was sufficiently convinced that this was the cup documented in 1604 to make a rather low offer, which was accepted. In the course of his researches the baron had contacted the current [[Duke of Frías]], who had supplied useful information, and then initially congratulated the buyer on his purchase. However, on looking further into the matter the duke realized that the sale was contrary to the 1610 deed of gift he had discovered in the family archives, and sued in the French courts to recover the cup.&lt;ref&gt;Dalton 6, Jenny Stratford 320&lt;/ref&gt;

The duke eventually lost his case in 1891,&lt;ref&gt;So Dalton, 6; both Jenny Stratford and Neil Stratford (p. 263) mention a judgment of 1885, but there were perhaps appeals.&lt;/ref&gt; enabling a further sale that had been set up by Baron Pichon to proceed. This was to the leading firm of Messrs. Wertheimer of [[Bond Street]] in London,&lt;ref name="D6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also [http://jssgallery.org/Essay/Wertheimer_Family/JM_Intro.htm The Wertheimer Family], from the [[Jewish Museum (New York)]].&lt;/ref&gt; where the cup was seen by [[Augustus Wollaston Franks]], who had been Keeper of British and Mediaeval Antiquities and Ethnography at the British Museum since 1866, and was president of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]]. Samson Wertheimer agreed "with much public spirit" to sell the cup to the British Museum for the £8,000 (£&amp;nbsp;{{formatnum:{{inflation|UK|8000|1891|r=-4}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}) it had cost the firm.&lt;ref name="D6" /&gt; Franks was worried by the new American collectors such as [[J. P. Morgan]], and in 1891 wrote to Sir [[Henry Tate]], of [[Tate Gallery]] fame: "A very wonderful gold cup has appeared returned to this country after an absence of 287 years, and I am anxious to see it placed in the National Museum and not removed to America."&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 175&lt;/ref&gt;

Franks tried to get wealthy individuals to subscribe £500 (£&amp;nbsp;{{formatnum:{{inflation|UK|500|1891|r=-3}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}) each, but even with a grant of £2,000 from [[HM Treasury]] could not raise the price. He was forced to put up £5,000 of his own money temporarily while he continued to try to get smaller amounts from others, and succeeded in 1892 when the Treasury agreed to contribute the final £830; "to Franks this was his greatest acquisition, and the one of which he was most proud."&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 175–176 (quotation, 176).&lt;/ref&gt;  Apart from the Treasury, the £500 contributors were Franks and Wertheimer, the [[Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths]], [[Fortnum &amp; Mason|Charles Drury Edward Fortnum]], the [[Algernon Percy, 6th Duke of Northumberland|Duke of Northumberland]], [[John Savile, 1st Baron Savile of Rufford|Lord Savile]], [[Edward Cecil Guinness, 1st Earl of Iveagh|Lord Iveagh]] and the [[James Ludovic Lindsay, 26th Earl of Crawford|Earl of Crawford]].&lt;ref&gt;Dalton, 6; he lists some donors of smaller amounts. See also Wilson, 175–176 for more detail on the timing. Samson Wertheimer died in 1892, and the sale was actually concluded by his son Asher and other heirs, and the donation by them was in his memory.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1901 Morgan succeeded in buying the [[Lindau Gospels]] in London, which the museum had also wanted.&lt;ref&gt;Needham, 24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation, context and survival==
[[File:Les Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry Janvier.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Berry at a feast for New Year, when gifts were exchanged among his court. To the left there is a ''buffet'' displaying plate, and two courtiers beside it seem to be comparing gifts. January from the calendar of ''[[Les Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry]]'', by the [[Limbourg Brothers]].]]
Much the most prominent decoration on the cup is the cycle of scenes from the life of [[Saint Agnes]], which is rarely depicted in such detail in art. However, there was one outstanding devotee of the saint in the period: King [[Charles&amp;nbsp;V of France]], Berry's older brother and Charles VI's father. Charles&amp;nbsp;V was born in 1338 on Saint Agnes' [[feast day]], January 21, and is recorded as owning at least 13 works of art featuring her, including a different gold cup enamelled with scenes from her life (both are recorded in the 1391 inventory).&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 82; Dalton, 10&lt;/ref&gt; Until recent decades the generally accepted hypothesis was that Berry ordered the cup as a present for his brother in 1380, to be ready for his birthday in January 1381. When the king died in September 1380, Berry had retained it for a decade before presenting it to Charles&amp;nbsp;VI.&lt;ref&gt;Dalton, 10; Cherry, 25&lt;/ref&gt;
:;
However, in 1978 Ronald Lightbown, Keeper of Metalwork at the [[V&amp;A Museum]], rejected this theory on stylistic grounds, considering that the cup must have been created only shortly before it appeared in Charles VI's inventory in 1391.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 82, in 1978. The old view is presented in Dalton, 10&lt;/ref&gt; He says that "in 1380 figure-style was a softly undulating, flowing style, with slender elongated figures and much use of serpentine or curving folds in the drapery, and with trailing dresses ending in sinuous Gothic hem-lines"&lt;ref name="Lightbown, 82"&gt;Lightbown, 82&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;—a style that can be seen in the miniature of the coronation of Charles&amp;nbsp;VI in 1380 illustrated above. In contrast, Lightbown says "the figures on the cup are broad, some might even be called stocky, with soft drapery of cylindrical form, or of smooth, tight outlines. The folds are tubular and the hems of the robes are straight with no waving, trailing outlines. The style in fact is the 'Italianate' manner which developed in France as a result of contact with '[[trecento]]' art, and not the purely Northern Gothic International manner."&lt;ref name="Lightbown, 82"/&gt; This view was rejected in 1981 by Neil Stratford, former Keeper of Medieval and Later Antiquities at the British Museum, who pointed to a number of manuscript illuminations in a similar style that date from earlier than 1390.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Stratford, 263–265&lt;/ref&gt; John Cherry, another former Keeper of the medieval collections at the British Museum, still presents the older dating in a work of 2010,&lt;ref&gt;Cherry, 25, and biography on rear cover.&lt;/ref&gt; and the British Museum website dates the cup to "about 1370–1380".&lt;ref&gt;Both  British Museum Highlights" and "British Museum collection database" pages&lt;/ref&gt;

Another traditional assumption, based on the language of the inventories and shared by almost all writers, was that the cup was a piece of secular plate, for use at table, or display on a ''buffet'' beside it.&lt;ref&gt;Sir Charles Hercules Read (see further reading), in 1904, quoted in Dalton, 1; Steane,135; Neil Stratford, 265; Jenny Stratford, 320; Buettner and others.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''buffet'' of the period was more like a modern [[Welsh dresser]] or shop display unit, with receding shelves for displaying on important occasions all the plate of the household that was not in use.&lt;ref&gt;Steane, 135&lt;/ref&gt;  Neil Stratford suggests that the cup was only used to drink from on special occasions, including St Agnes' feast day,&lt;ref name="Neil Stratford, 265"&gt;Neil Stratford, 265&lt;/ref&gt; while Lightbown remarks that at over four pounds in weight the cup is much too heavy to drink from conveniently.&lt;ref name="Lightbown, 81"/&gt;  However John Cherry, noting the exclusively religious subjects depicted (including that on the lost tripod stand) considers that the cup may have been intended as a ciborium from the start.&lt;ref&gt;Cherry, 25&lt;/ref&gt; It might have been used either to accompany in its carrying case the duke on his tours of his many castles and palaces, or perhaps for his foundation of the ''Saint Chapelle'' at his capital of [[Bourges]], intended to rival the king's ''[[Sainte-Chapelle]]'' in Paris and his brother's foundation at [[Champmol]] in [[Dijon]].&lt;ref&gt;Cherry, 41 on Berry's castles, and 43–44 on the Bourges ''Saint Chapelle''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The four sons of King [[John II of France]]—Charles V, [[Louis&amp;nbsp;I, Duke of Anjou]] (1339–1384), Berry and [[Philip the Bold]], [[Duke of Burgundy]] (1342–1404)—all spent huge sums on works in gold and silver, as well as on other works of art. Although it is Berry who is especially remembered as a patron, partly because he specialized in illuminated manuscripts which have little value in their materials, it was his brother Louis of Anjou who was the "most passionately interested in the goldsmith's art";&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 89 (quoted), and throughout his later chapters.&lt;/ref&gt; he had over 3,000 pieces of plate at one point. These included wholly secular pieces with sculptures in enamel that can only be imagined by comparison: in terms of technique to the handful of [[reliquaries]], like the British Museum's [[Holy Thorn Reliquary]], that have survived from the period, and in terms of subject matter to tapestries and illuminations.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, 134–139; Snyder, 16–17, and chapter 3 on the patronage of the brothers&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1381 Anjou melted down almost all his plate to finance a war to pursue his claim to the [[Kingdom of Naples]]. According to the sculptor and goldsmith [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]], writing seventy years later, one of Anjou's goldsmiths, called Gusmin and "a most skillful sculptor, of great talent", was so affected by the destruction of his life's work that he joined an [[Hermit|eremetic monastic order]] and lived out his days in silence.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, 136; Lightbown, 89; Buettner. Ghiberti does not make it entirely clear which Duke of Anjou Gusmin worked for; it might also have been Duke Louis I's son, [[Louis&amp;nbsp;II of Naples]] or grandson [[Louis&amp;nbsp;III of Naples]], who all pursued their claims to Naples, with Louis&amp;nbsp;I and III dying in Italy.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Royal Gold Cup was "probably not exceptional as to size or decoration" in this milieu; once "but one member of a class, it now stands alone". An inventory of Charles&amp;nbsp;V records 25 gold cups weighing between five and fifteen ''marcs''; this is slightly over nine without its stand.&lt;ref&gt;Dalton, 11&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller gold cups are recorded in sets of a dozen, of which Charles&amp;nbsp;V had three. The largest items were the great table ornaments, in the shape of ships, called [[Nef (metalwork)|nefs]], of which Charles&amp;nbsp;V had five, the heaviest weighing over 53&amp;nbsp;''marcs''.&lt;ref&gt;Dalton, 11. The duc de Berry has a nef on his table in the illustration above, and two of Charles V's can be seen on the table [[:File:Grandes Chroniques-entremet.jpg|here]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Berry died in 1416 with no male heir, and deeply in debt. Those of his works in precious metal and jewels that had not already gone to his creditors were mostly seized by the English when they took Paris in July 1417.&lt;ref&gt;Cherry, 47–48&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first of a number of periods that saw the large-scale destruction of goldsmiths' work that the cup escaped, but thousands of other pieces did not, a survival that Brigitte Buettner finds "almost miraculous".&lt;ref&gt;Buettner&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the move to Spain in 1604 enabled it to avoid the dispersal and destruction of the [[English Crown Jewels]] and royal collection of plate under the [[Commonwealth of England|English Commonwealth]].&lt;ref name="D6" /&gt;
[[File:Mérode Cup.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The [[silver-gilt]] [[Mérode Cup]], about 1400 ([[Victoria and Albert museum|V&amp;A Museum]])]]

As a secular piece the cup would be an almost unique survival at this level of quality, "the one representative left to us of medieval secular plate in its most sumptuous development".&lt;ref&gt;Sir Charles Hercules Read (see further reading), in 1904, quoted, Dalton, 1&lt;/ref&gt; Although French plate in silver and gold was made in great quantities, and at a high level of quality, "French silver made prior to the early 19th century is probably scarcer than that of any other European country."&lt;ref&gt;Osbourne, 726&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of even very skilled labour was low compared to that of the materials, and in the absence of any reliable way of either depositing or investing money, it was turned into lavish objects, in the knowledge that it might well need to be sold or melted down to finance some future project.

There are only four other known survivals, secular or religious, of ''basse taille'' enamel on gold, one the small [[George Salting|Salting]] [[Reliquary]], also in the British Museum, and none as fine as the cup.&lt;ref&gt;Dalton, 11.

See Campbell (1987), 435–436, with good photo and full catalogue entry; Osbourne, 333.

It was perhaps made in [[Cologne]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
[[File:Royal Gold Cup lid.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The first scene on the cover; Procopius offers Agnes a casket of jewels. Parts of the next scene can be seen at right, and her martyrdom at left.]]

The cycle of scenes from the life of Saint Agnes, and that of her foster-sister [[Saint Emerentiana]], follows the traditional story of ''[[Golden Legend]]'' of [[Jacobus de Voragine]]; the most popular compilation of [[hagiographies]] of the age, whose wording corresponds to some of the inscriptions in [[banderole (speech scroll)|banderole]]s or scrolls that explain the scenes. Other texts are quotations from the Latin [[Vulgate]] Bible, mostly derived from the [[liturgy]] for St Agnes' feast day,&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 78; Neil Stratford, 265; Jenny Stratford, 320. See Caxton reference for an online English translation of the ''Golden Legend''.&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been suggested that the two rings of pearls also reflect the language of the chants for these services.&lt;ref name="Neil Stratford, 265"/&gt;  It seems likely that [[clergy|clerical]] advice was taken, at least over the texts used in the inscriptions.&lt;ref name="Lightbown, 81"/&gt; It is tempting to relate the depiction of the story, with its "distinct and vivid tableaux, well suited to adaptation for performance" to [[medieval drama]], often a source for [[iconography]], but the fragmentary records mention no dramas on the life of St Agnes that are close in time or place to the origin of the cup.&lt;ref&gt;Quotation from Cowling, 27. On plays specifically about St Agnes, see Cowling, 19, 24, 27–28. On links between religious art and drama more generally, see Lane, especially 47–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Agnes and her sister were virgins of Rome in the time of the Emperor [[Constantine I|Constantine]], though all figures are shown in contemporary 14th-century dress.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 82; "British Museum collection database" has good images allowing all scenes to be seen, but they have no stable links.&lt;/ref&gt; The story begins on the inside of the bowl, which has a round medallion showing St Agnes kneeling before a bearded figure, representing her teacher, wearing a [[chaperon (headgear)|chaperon]]. She holds a book inscribed ''Miserere mei Deus sancte'' ("Have pity on me, Holy God"), while a banderole says ''In corde meo abscondi eloquia tua ut non peccem tibi'' ("Thy words have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against thee". {{bibleverse||Psalms|119:11|KJV}}).&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 81; the scene is not visible to visitors, but there is a photo on the "British Museum collection database", and in Lightbown (Plate LXVIIa), and Dalton's Figure 3 has a drawing. All biblical quotations are given in Latin and English per Lightbown (pp. 79 and 81; English version unknown), while the links are to the [[Authorized Version]] (aka "KJV"). The Vulgate text can be accessed via the link by changing the version at the top of the page.&lt;/ref&gt;  The top of the cover continues the story up to Agnes' [[martyrdom]] in five scenes, shown with a continuous groundline from which small rocks rise up to demarcate the scenes; on the base trees perform this function. Sunrays radiate from the centre of the cover above all the scenes; the red enamel which once filled these is nearly all lost.
[[File:Royal Gold Cup with flash.JPG|thumb|left|300px|On the cover, the second scene with Agnes outside the brothel and Procopius lying dead. Below, the pagans stone [[Emerentiana]], and on the foot the winged [[ox]], symbol of [[Saint Luke]].]]

In the first scene the two girls are returning from school, Agnes accompanied by her punning [[emblem|attribute]],&lt;ref&gt;The ''Golden Legend'' explains, in Caxton's version, "Agnes is said of agna a lamb, for she was humble and debonair as a lamb, or of agnos in Greek, which is to say debonair and piteous, for she was debonair and merciful. Or Agnes of agnoscendo, for she knew the way of truth, and after this [[Saint Augustine|St. Austin]] saith, truth is opposed against vanity, falseness, and doubleness, for these three things were taken from her for the truth that she had."&lt;/ref&gt; a [[domestic sheep|lamb]] with a cruciform [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]], and carrying a martyr's [[Arecaceae|palm]]. They are accosted by Procopius, the young son of the [[Prefect of Rome]], who has fallen in love with Agnes and shows her an open casket of jewels to persuade her to marry him. The inside of the casket is white, the only colour of opaque enamel in the original work, used only for a few highlights like the tiny area of the host held by Christ on the inside of the cover.&lt;ref&gt;Cherry, 26; there is also a belt in the lower scenes.&lt;/ref&gt; Agnes  rejects him, with the words ''Illi sum desponsata cui angeli serviunt'' ("I am betrothed to him who the angels serve") in a banderole above. In the Caxton her rejection is unequivocal and not polite, and she points out that her heavenly fiancé has promised her much better jewels.&lt;ref name="Caxton"&gt;Caxton&lt;/ref&gt;  The Prefect stands behind his son, and in the next scene has sentenced her to serve in a [[brothel]] for being a Christian who refuses to sacrifice to the goddess [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]]. Caxton's ''Legend'' fills in the intervening action: &lt;blockquote&gt;Then made she of the bordel her oratory, ... All they that entered made honour and reverence to the great clearness that they saw about St. Agnes, and came out more devout and more clean than they entered. At last came the son of the provost with a great company for to accomplish his foul desires and lusts. And when he saw his fellows come out and issue all abashed, he mocked them and called them cowards. And then he, all araged, entered for to accomplish his evil will. And when he came to the clearness, he advanced him for to take the virgin, and anon the devil took him by the throat and strangled him that he fell down dead.&lt;ref name="Caxton"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; In the next scene on the cup, Agnes stands outside the sentry box-like brothel, looking down at the Prefect's son who has been strangled to death by the devil crouched over him; a banderole reads ''Quo modo cecidisti qui mane oriebaris'' ("How has thou fallen that risest in the morning", {{bibleverse||Isaiah|14:12|KJV}}), and the Prefect looks on sadly.&lt;ref name="Lightbown, 79"&gt;Lightbown, 79&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following scene Agnes has been moved by the Prefect's grief, and prayed for the son to be restored to life, which an angel has done. The repentant Procopius kneels before her, while she leans down to tell him ''Vade amplius noli peccare'' ("Go forth and sin no more"; from {{bibleverse||John|8:11|KJV}}). However the result of the miracle was that (in [[William Caxton]]'s translation) "the bishops of the idols made a great discord among the people, so that all they cried: Take away this sorceress and witch that turned men's minds and alieneth their wits". The Prefect is now sympathetic to Agnes but fears he will lose his position if he does nothing, so leaves the matter in the hands of another official; the two are seen talking together, with words from {{bibleverse||Luke|23:4|KJV}} ''Nihil invenio cause in eam'' ("I find no cause against her") above. The last scene shows her martyrdom; she was sentenced to be burned but the flames part away from her so that finally the magistrate orders her killed by a spear.&lt;ref&gt;In fact a sword in the ''Golden Legend'', Lightbown, 79&lt;/ref&gt; Her last words, from {{bibleverse||Luke|23:46|KJV}}, are ''In manus tuas domine commendo animam meam'' ("Into your hands, O Lord, I commend my spirit").
[[File:British Museum Royal Gold Cup Detail.jpg|thumb|350px|The first scene underneath the bowl, in which Agnes is buried]]

The scenes continue on the underside of the bowl, starting with Agnes' burial. A [[pall (funeral)|pall]] is being laid over her [[sarcophagus]], whose red enamel has significant losses, which reveal clearly the engraved lines beneath. A [[tonsure]]d priest with an [[Aspergillum|aspergil]] for sprinkling [[holy water]] and an [[acolyte]] with a cross attend, with Emerentiana with halo to the left, and Agnes' mother to the right. The banderole above says ''Ecce quod concupivi iam teneo'' ("Behold what I have desired I now possess"). In the next scene pagans have arrived to disrupt the burial, and only Emerentiana has stayed, kneeling in prayer as she is pelted with rocks. The inscription reads ''Veni soror mea mecum in gloria'' ("Come with me my sister into glory"). She dies, and the following scene shows the two martyrs, accompanied by two other unnamed female martyrs (in the source "a great multitude of virgins clad in vestments of gold and silver"),&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 79; Caxton&lt;/ref&gt; as they appear in a vision to Agnes' friends eight days after her death, as they gather round her sarcophagus, into which Emerentiana's body has also been placed.

The next scene shows the sarcophagus with [[Constantina]], the daughter of the Emperor Constantine, asleep on top of it, wearing a crown.&lt;ref&gt;Constantina developed a medieval legend, and was venerated as a saint, Saint Constance in English. See Kleinhenz, Christopher, ed.; [https://books.google.com/books?id=1piMMqjAf1MC&amp;pg=PA251&amp;dq=Vita+%22Saint+Agnes%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=u4IiTL0iw4g4tcbhiwU&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Vita%20%22Saint%20Agnes%22&amp;f=false ''Medieval Italy: an encyclopedia, Volume 1]'', Routledge, 2004. {{ISBN|0-415-93930-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has been afflicted with [[leprosy]], and heard of the vision at Agnes' tomb, and come to pray there. The presence at left of a young man on crutches, not in the source, suggests that others are doing the same. The sleeping woman beside the tomb is either another such, or an attendant on the princess. As Constantina sleeps, Agnes, holding her lamb, appears to her, saying ''Si in xpm (Christum) credideris sanaberis'' ("If you believe in Christ you will be healed", an adaptation of the text in the source).&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 79; he gives the Latin from the source.&lt;/ref&gt; In the final scene, the cured, and baptized, Constantina tells her crowned father the story, with the inscription ''Hec est virgo sapiens una de numero prudencium'' ("This is a wise virgin, one of the number of the prudent").&lt;ref name="Lightbown, 79"/&gt;

The inside of the cover has a circular enamel medallion with worked gold borders, showing a half-length Christ making a blessing gesture and holding a [[chalice]] with a host inside. Around him is a sun-like [[aureole]] in red. Below the two added cylinders on the stem, the four traditional [[Evangelist's symbol|symbols of the Evangelists]] run round the sloping foot of the cup, in pairs facing each other, above a green ground area. Lightbown notes this as "another sign of care for naturalistic effect".&lt;ref name="Lightbown, 81"/&gt;

==Construction and techniques==
[[File:Medallion bull St Luke MNMA Cl14719.jpg|thumb|left|280px|A 14th-century silver plaque in ''[[basse-taille]]'' with translucent enamels, with considerable losses, showing the prepared metal surfaces beneath, and the tinting with different colours]]

Each of the cover, main body, and foot of the cup is made of an inner and outer plate, and the enamelled medallions inside the cover and bowl were made separately before attachment. The enamel areas may have been designed by the goldsmith, or an artist more used to painting on panels or in manuscripts may have produced drawings. A number of names of goldsmiths appear in records of the period, but in contrast to many contemporary manuscripts, the few surviving goldsmith's pieces are not signed or marked and cannot be matched to any names. Not a single maker's name is recorded for the more than 3,000 items in precious metal in the inventory mentioned above of the possessions of Berry's brother Anjou.&lt;ref&gt;Nash, 44&lt;/ref&gt; High quality courtly work like the cup is conventionally assigned to Paris in the absence of other stylistic evidence; this is where other documentary sources locate the main concentration of goldsmiths.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 89 and throughout; Cherry, 25; Osbourne, 726&lt;/ref&gt;

The process for creating the ''[[basse-taille]]'' enamel areas began by marking the outline of the design and the main internal outlines on the gold with a tool called a "tracer". Then the interior area was worked with [[Repoussé and chasing|chasing tools]], hammering and punching rather than cutting, to form a shallow recess to hold the enamel. The more important parts of the design were modelled by varying the depth of the surface to produce different intensities of colour when the translucent enamel was added; the gold under folds of drapery often rises near the surface to create a paler highlight. In many of the recessed areas decoration was added by either engraving or punching which would show through the translucent enamel, or to facet the background so the reflections change as the viewing angle changes slightly. In these last-mentioned areas cutting tools were used. Most of the background outside the enamelled areas was decorated in the same way. After the enamel was added and fired the surfaces were cleaned up, made good and polished, including removing by scraping any bumps showing through on the reverse of the metal.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 78; Maryon (1951)&amp;nbsp;– see further reading&amp;nbsp;– and his colleagues established the method for making the recesses, which Read and Dalton had thought were all cut out with [[chisel]]s. For other objects with translucent enamels, see Campbell (1987), 458–461.&lt;/ref&gt;

The enamel lies flush with the gold surfaces; it was a preparation of finely ground glass paste applied with great care to the prepared recessed areas, and then fired. Different colours of enamel meet each other with a neat boundary, which was achieved by firing one colour with a retaining border of [[gum tragacanth]] before adding the next. The difficulty was increased by the application of tints of a different colour to a base shade of enamel before firing, so that the added colour blends gradually into the background colour around the edges of the tinted area. This is especially used on "flux", or colourless enamel, as in the ground areas, rocks and trees. Flux was also used for flesh areas as on a gold background it darkens slightly when fired to a suitable colour for skin. The ''rouge clair'' or "ruby glass" red, used so effectively here, was made by adding tiny particles of [[copper]], silver and gold to the glass; here scientific tests have shown that copper was used. After firing the enamel was polished flush with the surrounding metal. The technique had been known to the Ancient Romans (see the [[Lycurgus Cup]], also in the British Museum), but was lost at the end of the Middle Ages until the 17th&amp;nbsp;century. The added cylinders use opaque enamel,&lt;ref&gt;"British Museum Investigation"; Maryon (1971), 188; Osbourne, 333&lt;/ref&gt; except for the red on the Tudor roses, which is translucent ''rouge clair'', of a similar composition to the original reds.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (2001), 129&lt;/ref&gt; Translucent enamel is more fragile than opaque, and medieval survivals in good condition are very rare.&lt;ref&gt;Osbourne, 333&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rogier van der Weyden - The Altar of St. John.jpg|thumb|620px|[[Rogier van der Weyden]]'s ''St John Altarpiece''. Oil on oak panel, each frame 77 x 48cm. [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin]]]]

The '''''St John Altarpiece''''' (German - ''Johannesaltar'', ''Johannestafel'' or ''Johannesretabel'') is a c. 1455 oil-on-oak wood [[panel painting|panel]] [[altarpiece]] by the [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] painter [[Rogier van der Weyden]], now in the [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin]]. The triptych is linked to the artist's earlier ''[[Miraflores Altarpiece]]'' in its symbolic motifs, format and intention.&lt;ref name="A"&gt;Acres, 422-51&lt;/ref&gt;

The panels show – from left to right – the birth of [[John the Apostle|Saint John]], the baptism of Christ by John in [[Jordan]], and the [[beheading of St. John the Baptist|beheading of John]], with the rather attractive [[Salome]] receiving the disembodied head on a plate. Each panel is set within painted [[archivolt]]s, which contain painted reliefs depicting statuettes of the apostles,&lt;ref name="r1"&gt;Reed, 1&lt;/ref&gt; and scenes from the lives of both Christ and John, with the overall theme of salvation. The faux sculptural reliefs are painted in [[grisaille]], and give the impression that the scenes are set within a church.&lt;ref name="j92"&gt;Jacobs, 92&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two extant versions of the altarpiece, almost equal in size, leading to complexities in establishing attribution and authenticity. The version in Berlin is considered the original, that in Frankfurt a near contemporary copy.

==Description==
The three panels describe the major events in John's life: his birth, baptism of Christ, and his decapitation at the hands of Salome. The reliefs in the archivolts detail secondary events from his life. The overall theme is of the [[sacrament]]s, each panel can be associated with a specific [[liturgical]] ceremony.&lt;ref name="l655"&gt;Lane, 655&lt;/ref&gt; Of the six archivolt scenes, four detail scenes of Mary's life, including the "Marriage of the Virgin", the "Annunciation" and the "Birth of Christ".&lt;ref name="r4"&gt;Reed, 4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Birth of John===

The archivolts of this panel show the angel appearing to John's father [[Zechariah (priest)|Zacharias]], in the temple. According to Luke 1:12–17, an angel of the Lord had earlier appeared and announced to Zechariah that his wife would give birth to a son, whom he was to name John, and that this son would be the forerunner of the Lord. Citing their advanced age, Zechariah asked with disbelief for a sign so he would know the truth of this prophecy. In reply, the angel identified himself as Gabriel, sent by God, and stated that because of Zechariah's doubt he would be struck dumb and "not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed". This punishment of muteness is referred to in the archivolt reliefs.&lt;ref name="l659"&gt;Lane, 659&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Birth and Naming of Saint John the Baptist Petites Heures du Duc de Berry.jpg|thumb|left|280px|''Birth and Naming of Saint John the Baptist'', before 1388, [[Petites Heures de Jean de Berry]], Folio 207r]]
Zacharias appears in the main panel sitting in the foreground with a pen and scroll. To his right, [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] presents his son to him. By including the Virgin, Rogier strays from the Gospel account of the scene, referring instead to the apocryphal version popularised by the ''[[Golden Legend]]'' and the ''[[Meditations on the Life of Christ]]'', both of which have Mary presenting the child John. [[Erwin Panofsky]] suggests that Rogier might have been influenced by [[Andrea Pisano]]'s relief ''The Naming of the Baptist'' at the [[Florence Baptistery]], which shows a similar scene of Mary presenting to Zechariah, who sits holding a pen and scroll.&lt;ref name="l659" /&gt;

===Baptism of Christ===
In the central panel John can be identified by his red robe.&lt;ref&gt;Soudavar, 66&lt;/ref&gt; This panel shows the apparition of God in the sky above painted in red hues, from which emanates a curved Latin script, above a dove. The panels are typical of the harmony and unity characteristic of Rogier; especially in the manner in which the figures echo each other. This is most evident in the figure of the woman in the birth panel, who occupies the same space and resembles Salome to the far right.

[[File:Rogier van der Weyden - The Altar of St. John - Google Art Project 1.jpg|400px|thumb|Detail of the central panel showing the head of God]]
Christ stands fully frontal to the viewer, positioned in a stream with water rising to just below his knees. To his right John blesses him, with his hand raised over Christ's head. [[God the Father]] is shown ascending from the clouds. He sends down a dove to bless the occasion.  The dove is accompanied by, in art historian Barbara Lane's words, a "gracefully curving inscription" taken from Matthew 17:5, which reads "This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him."&lt;ref name="l656"&gt;Lane, 656&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, the baptism is where Jesus is first presented as the son of God, his divinity first revealed to the world, here symbolised by the ascendance of the dove and God's words.&lt;ref&gt;Blum, 36&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death of John===
[[File:Rogier van der Weyden - The Altar of St. John - Google Art Project 2.jpg|thumb|400px|Detail; Salome receives John's severed head on a platter]]
The right hand panel is unusually dramatic and also deviates from the Gospel account. Instead of a prison setting, the scene is shown in a domestic interior.&lt;ref name="l662"&gt;Lane, 662&lt;/ref&gt; In most depictions, Salome holds an empty charger; here the head has been placed on the charger.&lt;ref name="l663"&gt;Lane, 663&lt;/ref&gt; John's limp body lies at the foot of the stairs, blood pumping from the neck, as the executioner, still holding his sword, hands the head to Salome on a golden [[Horses in warfare|charger]]. Salome, according to Lane, "demurely averts her glance", as does the executioner, who turns right to look out of a large window. In the background, she is shown presenting the head to her mother, the Judaean princess [[Herodias]], at what appears to be the [[Beheading of St. John the Baptist|Feast of Herod]].&lt;ref name="l662" /&gt;

[[File:Salome with the Head of John the Baptist.jpg|thumb|220px|left|[[Limbourg brothers]], ''Salome Presents the Head of John the Baptist at the Banquet of Herod'', 1405–1408-09. [[Belles Heures of Jean de France, Duc de Berry]], fol. 212v]]

Salome is painted to the late Gothic ideal, with narrow shoulders, thin frame and generic idealised face. She wears a headdress, and blue dress, with white lining and green under-sleeves.

In the panel, Rogier makes reference to the [[Communion (Christian)|Communion]], in that John's head "signifies the body of Christ which feeds us on the
holy altar". Lane writes that "Salome's charger&amp;nbsp;... apparently corresponds to the golden paten on which the Host is placed during the sacrifice of the Mass."&lt;ref name="l663" /&gt; Art historian Victoria Reed agrees with this analysis, noting that John's head has become a eucharistic symbol, and that "by receiving it, Salome takes the part of the Christian communicant." She observes that the charger resembles a [[paten]], while the sleeves of Salome's dress are "reminiscent of a liturgical cloth with which to bear the sacrament."&lt;ref name="r7"&gt;Reed, 7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
The work was commissioned by Battista Agnelli, a merchant from [[Pisa]], for Saint James's Church, [[Bruges]]. It is smaller than van der Weyden's other altarpieces, and probably intended as a side altarpiece or private devotional object. The frames are mounted together and cannot fold inwards. Therefore, it is not a triptych, but a purpose designed [[altarpiece]]. It is thought to have been commissioned by a Spanish donor; there is compelling evidence that it is the same work described in a Carthusian monastery of [[Monastery of Santa Maria de las Cuevas|Santa Maria de las Cuevas]], in [[Seville]]. José Martín Rincón, in 1744 wrote of a "portable oratory" showing the Baptism of Christ, flanked by scenes of John's birth, and beheading, though he attributed [[Albrecht Dürer]]. In 1778 the Spanish historian [[Antonio Ponz]]  mentioned the same altarpiece, noting that "each one of the scenes is included within two pilasters and an arch".&lt;ref name="r2"&gt;Reed, 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attribution==
Panofsky dates the altarpiece to after 1450, based on the similarity of the left hand panel to Andrea Pisano's relief; Rogier may have seen it during his visit to Italy that year.&lt;ref name="l659" /&gt; Dendrochronological examination dates the wood as ready for use as a panel painting at about 1454.&lt;ref name="r2" /&gt; Most art historians see the altarpiece as inextricably linked with the ''[[Miraflores Altarpiece]]'', thus associating it with van der Weyden. Panofsky described them as "almost indistinguishable" in style and quality.&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky, 259&lt;/ref&gt; Later Shirley Blum wrote that "the two altarpieces are as alike formally as they are in devotional character&amp;nbsp;... one should examine more closely the possibility that they originally came from the same place". Victoria Reed believes the similarities so pronounced that it is highly probable that the two were intended to hang together at the Miraflores monastery.&lt;ref name="r9"&gt;Reed, 9&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Thomism}}
The '''''Summa Theologiae''''' (written 1265–1274 and also known as the '''''Summa Theologica''''' or simply the '''''Summa''''') is the best-known work of [[Thomas Aquinas]] (c. 1225–1274). Although unfinished, the ''Summa'' is "one of the classics of the history of philosophy and one of the most influential works of Western literature".&lt;ref&gt;Ross, James F., "Thomas Aquinas, ''Summa theologiae'' (ca. 1273), Christian Wisdom Explained Philosophically", in ''The Classics of Western Philosophy: A Reader's Guide'', (eds.) Jorge J. E. Gracia, Gregory M. Reichberg, Bernard N. Schumacher (Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, 2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=6jAcwGItzssC&amp;pg=PA165 p. 165.]&lt;/ref&gt; It is intended as an instructional guide for theology students, including seminarians and the literate laity. It is a compendium of all of the main [[theology|theological]] teachings of the [[Catholic Church]]. It presents the reasoning for almost all points of Christian theology in the West. The ''Summa''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s topics follow a cycle: [[God]]; Creation, Man; [[teleology|Man's purpose]]; [[Christ]]; the [[Sacraments]]; and back to God.

The ''Summa'' is Aquinas' "most perfect work, the fruit of his mature years, in which the thought of his whole life is condensed".&lt;ref&gt;Perrier, Joseph Louis, Ph.D., "The Revival of Scholastic Philosophy in the Nineteenth Century" (New York: The Columbia University Press, 1909), pg. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; Among non-scholars, the ''Summa'' is perhaps most famous for its five arguments for the existence of God, which are known as the "five ways" ({{lang-la|[[quinque viae]]}}). The five ways, however, occupy only one of the ''Summa'''s 3,125 articles.

Throughout the ''Summa'', Aquinas cites [[Christian]], [[Islam|Muslim]], [[Judaism|Hebrew]], and [[Paganism|Pagan]] sources including but not limited to [[Catholic Bible|Christian Sacred Scripture]], [[Aristotle]], [[Augustine of Hippo]], [[Avicenna]], [[Averroes]], [[Al-Ghazali]], [[Boethius]], [[John of Damascus]], [[Paul the Apostle]], [[Dionysius the Areopagite]], [[Maimonides]], [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]], [[Plato]], [[Cicero]], and [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena|Eriugena]].

The ''Summa'' is a more structured and expanded version of Aquinas's earlier ''[[Summa contra Gentiles]]''. These works were written for different purposes, the ''Summa Theologiae'' to explain the Christian faith to beginning theology students, and the ''Summa contra Gentiles'' to explain the Christian faith and defend it in hostile situations, with arguments adapted to the intended circumstances of its use, each article refuting a certain belief or a specific [[heresy]].&lt;ref name="GilsonC"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gilson|first=Etienne|title=The Christian Philosophy of Saint Thomas Aquinas|year=1994|publisher=University of Notre Dame Press|location=Notre Dame, IN|isbn=978-0-268-00801-7|pages=502}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aquinas conceived the ''Summa'' specifically as a work suited to beginning students: "Because a doctor of catholic truth ought not only to teach the proficient, but to him pertains also to instruct beginners. As the Apostle says in 1 Corinthians 3: 1–2, ''as to infants in Christ, I gave you milk to drink, not meat'', our proposed intention in this work is to convey those things that pertain to the Christian religion, in a way that is fitting to the instruction of beginners."&lt;ref&gt;''Summa theologiae, I, 1, prooemium:"Quia Catholicae veritatis doctor non solum provectos debet instruere, sed ad eum pertinet etiam incipientes erudire, secundum illud apostoli I ad Corinth. III, tanquam parvulis in Christo, lac vobis potum dedi, non escam; propositum nostrae intentionis in hoc opere est, ea quae ad Christianam religionem pertinent, eo modo tradere, secundum quod congruit ad eruditionem incipientium."&lt;/ref&gt;

It was while teaching at the [[Santa Sabina]] ''studium provinciale'', the forerunner of the [[Santa Maria sopra Minerva]] ''[[studium generale]]'' and College of Saint Thomas, which in the 20th century would become the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']], that Aquinas began to compose the ''Summa''. He completed the ''Prima Pars'' (first part) in its entirety and circulated it in Italy before departing to take up his second regency as professor at the University of Paris (1269–1272).&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Torrell, O.P. ''Saint Thomas Aquinas'', vol 1, The Person and His Work, trans. Robert Royal, Catholic University, 1996, 146 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only has the ''Summa Theologiae'' been one of the main intellectual inspirations for [[Thomism|Thomistic philosophy]], but it also had such a great influence on [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]],'' that Dante's epic poem has been called "the ''Summa'' in verse."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-AQTAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22the+Summa+in+verse%22&amp;dq=%22the+Summa+in+verse%22&amp;cd=10 ''The Fordham Monthly''] Fordham University, Vol. XL, Oct. 1921 – June 1922, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;
Even today, both in Western and Eastern Catholic Churches, Orthodoxy, and the mainstream original Protestant denominations (Anglicanism and Episcopalianism, Lutheranism, Methodism, and Presbyterianism), it is very common for the Summa Theologiae to be required or strongly urged reading, in whole or in part, for all those seeking ordination to the diaconate or priesthood, or to professed male or female religious life, or for laypersons studying philosophy and theology at the collegiate level.

== Structure ==

[[Image:Tommaso - Summa theologica, 1596 - 4593718.tif|thumb|''Summa theologica'', 1596]]

The ''Summa'' is structured into three '''Parts''' which are subdivided into 614 '''Questions''' or "QQ".  Questions, in turn, are subdivided into 3,125 '''Articles'''.  "Questions" are specific topics of discussion, while their articles are even more specific questions, facets of the parent question.  For example, Part I, Question 2, "The Existence of God" is divided into three articles: "Whether the existence of God is self-evident?", "Whether it can be demonstrated that God exists?", and "Whether God exists?"  Additionally, questions on a broader theme are grouped into '''Treatises''', though the category of treatise is reported differently, depending on the source.

The ''Summa's'' three parts have a few other major subdivisions.

* '''First Part''' (119 QQ, 584 Art.): in Latin, ''Prima Pars''.  God's existence and nature; the creation of the world; [[angel]]s; the nature of man.
* '''Second Part''' (303 QQ, 1536 Art.), subdivided into two sub-parts:
:* '''First part of the Second Part''' (114 QQ, 619 Art.): ''Prima Secundae'', or Part I-II.  General principles of morality (including a theory of [[law]]).
:* '''Second part of the Second Part''' (189 QQ, 917 Art.): ''Secunda Secundae'', or Part II-II.  Morality in particular, including individual virtues and vices.
* '''Third Part''' (90 QQ, 549 Art.): ''Tertia Pars''.  The person and work of Christ, who is the way of man to God; the [[sacrament]]s. Aquinas left this part unfinished.&lt;ref&gt;McInerny, Ralph, ''A First Glance at St. Thomas Aquinas'', Notre Dame Press:Indiana, (1990), p.197, {{ISBN|0-268-00975-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:* '''Supplement''' (99 QQ, 446 Art.). The third part proper is attended by a posthumous supplement which concludes the third part and the ''Summa'', treating of Christian [[eschatology]], or "the last things".
* '''Appendix I and II''' (2 QQ, 8 Art; 1 Q, 2 Art.). Additionally, there are two very small appendices which discuss the subject of [[purgatory]].

The ''Summa'' has a standard format for each article, which can be explained by taking another article (Pt. III, Q. 40, Art. 3) as an example: "Whether [[Christ]] should have led a life of poverty in this world?",&lt;ref name=ST3_40_3&gt;''[http://www.ccel.org/a/aquinas/summa/TP/TP040.html#TPQ40A3THEP1 Summa Theologica]'', Third Part, Question 40, Article 3. Retrieved 11 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; a facet of the larger question "Of Christ's Manner of Life."&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.ccel.org/a/aquinas/summa/TP/TP040.html Summa Theologica]'', Third Part, Question 40.  Retrieved 11 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; 

* A series of objections to the (yet to be stated) conclusion are given; one such objection, for example, is that "Christ should have embraced the most eligible form of life...which is a mean between riches and poverty."&lt;ref name=ST3_40_3/&gt; Note that this said conclusion can mostly (but not without exception) be extracted by setting the introduction to the first objection into the negative, thus, St. Thomas begins here "It would seem that Christ should not have led a life of poverty in this world", and his thesis in the end is "Christ should have led a life of poverty in this world" (or to be more precise in today's language, "That Christ lived, as he actually did, a life of poverty in this world was fittingly done so").
* A short counter-statement, beginning with the phrase ''sed contra'' ("on the contrary"), is then given; this statement almost always references authoritative literature, such as the [[Bible]], [[Aristotle]], or the [[Church Fathers]].&lt;ref&gt;Kreeft, Peter. ''Summa of the Summa,'' Ignatius Press (1990), pp. 17–18.  {{ISBN|0-89870-300-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* The actual argument is then made; this is generally a clarification of the issue. For example, Aquinas states that "it was fitting for Christ to lead a life of poverty in this world" for four distinct reasons, each of which is expounded in some detail.&lt;ref name=ST3_40_3/&gt;
* Individual replies to the preceding objections are then given, if necessary. These replies range from one sentence to several paragraphs in length. Aquinas's reply to the above objection is that "those who wish to live virtuously need to avoid abundance of riches and beggary, ... but voluntary poverty is not open to this danger: and such was the poverty chosen by Christ."&lt;ref name=ST3_40_3/&gt;

This method of exposition is derived from [[Averroes]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02150c.htm Turner, William. "Averroes."] ''The Catholic Encyclopedia''. Vol. 2. New York: Robert Appleton Company (1907). "St. Thomas Aquinas used the "Grand Commentary" of Averroes as his model, being, apparently, the first Scholastic to adopt that style of exposition..." Retrieved 2009-11-06.&lt;/ref&gt; to whom Aquinas refers respectfully as "the Commentator".

== References within the ''Summa'' ==
[[File:Summa Theologica.JPG|thumb]]
The ''Summa'' makes many references to certain thinkers held in great respect in Aquinas's time. The arguments from authority, or ''sed contra'' arguments, are almost entirely based on citations from these authors. Some were called by special names:
* '''The Apostle:''' [[Paul the Apostle]]. He wrote the majority of the [[New Testament]] canon after his conversion, earning him the title of The Apostle in Aquinas's ''Summa'' even though Paul wasn't among the original twelve followers of Jesus.
* '''The Philosopher:''' [[Aristotle]]. He was considered the most astute philosopher – the one who had expressed the most truth up to that time. The main aim of the [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] theologians was to use his precise technical terms and [[logical system]] to investigate theology.
* '''The Commentator:''' [[Averroes]] (Ibn Rushd). He was among the foremost commentators on Aristotle's works in Arabic, and his commentaries were often translated into Latin (along with Aristotle's text).
* '''The Master:''' [[Peter Lombard]]. Writer of the dominant theological text for the time: ''The [[Sentences]]'' (commentaries on the writings of the [[Doctors of the Church]])
* '''The Theologian:''' [[Augustine of Hippo]]. Considered the greatest theologian who had ever lived up to that time; Augustine's works are frequently quoted by Aquinas.
* '''The Jurist''' or '''The Legal Expert''' (''iurisperitus'')''':''' [[Ulpian]] (a [[Roman law|Roman jurist]]), the most-quoted contributor to the [[Pandects]].
* '''Tully:''' [[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]], famed Roman statesman and orator who was also responsible for bringing significant swathes of Greek philosophy to Latin-speaking audiences, though generally through summation and commentary in his own work rather than by translation.
* '''Dionysius:''' [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]]. Aquinas refers to the works of Dionysius, whom scholars of the time thought to be the person mentioned in Acts 17:34 (a disciple of [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]]). However, they were most likely written in Syria during the 6th century by a writer who attributed his book to Dionysius (hence the addition of the prefix "pseudo-" to the name "Dionysius" in most modern references to these works).
* '''Avicenna:''' Aquinas frequently cites this Persian polymath, the Aristotelian/[[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]]/[[Early Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosopher]] Ibn Sina ([[Avicenna]]).
* '''Algazel:''' Aquinas also cites the [[Kalam|Islamic theologian]] [[al-Ghazali]] (Algazel).
* '''Rabbi Moses:''' Rabbi Moses [[Maimonides]] was a [[Jew]]ish [[rabbi]]nical scholar, a near-contemporary of Aquinas (died 1204, before Aquinas). The scholastics derived many insights from his work, as he also employed the [[scholastic method]].

== Notable points made by the ''Summa'' ==
* Theology is the most certain of all sciences because its source is divine knowledge (which cannot be deceived) and because of the greater worth of its subject matter, the sublimity of which transcends human reason.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.ccel.org/a/aquinas/summa/FP/FP001.html#FPQ1A5THEP1 ST]'', First Part, Question 1, Article 5.  Retrieved 11 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
* When a man knows an effect and knows that it has a cause, the natural desire of the intellect or mind is to understand the essence of that thing – natural, because this understanding results from the perfection of the operation of the intellect or mind.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2003.htm#8 ST]'', First Part of Second Part, Q. 3, art. 8, [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2003.htm#7 ibid], art. 6-7/&lt;/ref&gt;
* The existence of something and its essence are distinct. That is, its being and the conception of being man has or can imagine of it (for example, a mountain of solid gold would have essence – since it can be imagined – but not existence, as it is not in the world) are separate in all things – except for God, who is [[divine simplicity|simple]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.ccel.org/a/aquinas/summa/FP/FP003.html#FPQ3A4THEP1 ST]'', First Part, Question 3, Article 4. Aquinas develops this line of thought more fully in a shorter work, ''De ente et essentia''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[existence of God]], [[divine simplicity|his total simplicity]] or lack of composition, his [[eternity|eternal]] nature (''eternal'', in this case, means that he is altogether outside of time; that is, time is held to be a part of God's created universe), his knowledge, the way his will operates, and his power can all be proved by human reasoning alone. However, although St. Thomas felt that it can be proved by human reason alone that God created the universe, reason alone could not determine whether the universe actually began at some point in time or was eternal, but only divine revelation from the Book of Genesis proves that.&lt;ref&gt;Rom. 1:19–20; ''[http://www.ccel.org/a/aquinas/summa/FP/FP002.html#FPQ2A2THEP1 ST]'', First Part, Question 2, Article 2. See also I, Q. 1, art. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview of the entire ''Summa'' ==
[[File:Aquinas summa cycle.svg|300px|thumb|Graphical depiction of the cyclic structure of the work.]]
The structure of the ''Summa Theologiae'' is meant to reflect the [[cyclic history|cyclic]] nature of the cosmos, in the sense of the emission and return of the Many from and to [[the One (Neoplatonism)|the One]] in [[Platonism]], cast in terms of Christian theology: The procession of the material universe from [[Ousia|divine essence]], the culmination of creation in [[Creation of Man|man]], and the motion of man [[Salvation in Christianity|back towards God]] by way of [[Christ]] and the [[Sacraments]].&lt;ref&gt;
Thomas Franklin O'Meara, ''Summa Theologiae: Volume 40, Superstition and Irreverence'', Cambridge University Press, (2006), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=EL59l6bgk0MC&amp;pg=PR19  p. xix].&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure of the work reflects this cyclic arrangement.  It begins with God and his existence in Question 2. The entire first part of the ''Summa'' deals with God and his creation, which reaches its zenith in man. The First Part, therefore, ends with the treatise on man.

The second part of the ''Summa'' deals with man's purpose (the meaning of life), which is happiness. The ethics detailed in this part are a summary of the ethics (Aristotelian in nature) that man must follow to reach his intended destiny.

Since no man on his own can truly live the perfect ethical life (and therefore reach God), it was necessary that a perfect man bridge the gap between God and man. Thus God became man. The third part of the ''Summa'', therefore, deals with the life of Christ.

In order to follow the way prescribed by this perfect man, in order to live with God's grace (which is necessary for man's salvation), the Sacraments have been provided; the final part of the ''Summa'' considers the Sacraments.

=== The Summa, Part I: Theology ===
St. Thomas's greatest work was the ''Summa'', and it is the fullest presentation of his views. He worked on it from the time of [[Pope Clement IV|Clement IV]] (after 1265) until the end of his life. When he died, he had reached Question 90 of Part III (on the subject of [[penance]]). What was lacking was added afterwards from the fourth book of his commentary on the ''Sentences'' of Peter Lombard as a ''supplementum'', which is not found in manuscripts of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. The ''Summa'' was translated into Greek (apparently by [[Maximus Planudes]] around 1327), Armenian, many European languages, and Chinese.

It consists of three parts. Part I treats of God, who is the "[[first cause]], himself uncaused" (''[[primum movens]] immobile'') and as such existent only in act (''actu'') – that is, pure actuality without potentiality, and therefore without corporeality. His essence is ''[[Actus Purus|actus purus et perfectus]]''. This [[Logical consequence|follows from]] the fivefold proof for the existence of God; namely, there must be a first mover, unmoved, a first cause in the chain of causes, an absolutely necessary being, an absolutely perfect being, and a rational designer. In this connection the thoughts of the unity, [[infinity]], unchangeability, and goodness of the highest being are deduced.

As God rules in the world, the "plan of the order of things" preexists in him; in other words, his [[Divine providence|providence]] and the exercise of it in his government are what condition as cause everything which comes to pass in the world. Hence follows [[predestination]]: from eternity some are destined to eternal life, while as concerns others "he permits some to fall short of that end". [[Reprobation]], however, is more than mere foreknowledge; it is the "will of permitting anyone to fall into sin and incur the penalty of condemnation for sin".  

The effect of predestination is grace. Since God is the first cause of everything, he is the cause of even the free acts of men through predestination. Determinism is deeply grounded in the system of St. Thomas; things (with their source of becoming in God) are ordered from eternity as means for the realization of his end in himself.  

On moral grounds, St. Thomas advocates freedom energetically; but, with his premises, he can have in mind only the psychological form of self-motivation. Nothing in the world is accidental or free, although it may appear so in reference to the proximate cause. From this point of view, miracles become necessary in themselves and are to be considered merely as inexplicable to man. From the point of view of the first cause, all is unchangeable, although from the limited point of view of the secondary cause, miracles may be spoken of.

In his doctrine of the [[Trinity]], Aquinas starts from the Augustinian system. Since God has only the functions of thinking and willing, only two ''processiones'' can be asserted from the Father; but these establish definite relations of the persons of the Trinity, one to another. The relations must be conceived as real and not as merely ideal; for, as with creatures relations arise through certain accidents, since in God there is no accident but all is substance, it follows that "the relation really existing in God is the same as the essence according to the thing". From another side, however, the relations as real must be really distinguished one from another. Therefore, three persons are to be affirmed in God.

Man stands opposite to God; he consists of [[soul]] and body. The "intellectual soul" consists of [[nous|intellect]] and [[Will (philosophy)|will]]. Furthermore, the soul is the absolutely indivisible form of man; it is immaterial substance, but not one and the same in all men (as the [[Averroism|Averroists]] assumed). The soul's power of knowing has two sides: a passive (the ''[[passive intellect|intellectus possibilis]]'') and an active (the ''intellectus agens'').  

It is the capacity to form concepts and to abstract the mind's images (''species'') from the objects perceived by sense; but since what the intellect abstracts from individual things is universal, the mind knows the universal primarily and directly and knows the singular only indirectly by virtue of a certain ''reflexio'' (compare [[Scholasticism]]). As certain principles are immanent in the mind for its speculative activity, so also a "special disposition of works" – or the ''[[synderesis]]'' (rudiment of conscience) – is inborn in the "practical reason", affording the idea of the moral law of nature so important in medieval ethics.

=== The Summa, Part II: Ethics ===

==== Structure ====
Part II of the ''Summa'' is divided into two parts. The first part comprises 114 ''quaestiones'', and the second part comprises 189. The two parts of the second part are usually presented as containing several "treatises". The contents are as follows:
* '''First part of Part II''':
** Treatise on the last end (qq. 1 to 5)
** Treatise on human acts: Acts peculiar to humans (qq. 6 to 21)
** Treatise on the passions (qq. 22 to 48)
** Treatise on habits (qq. 49 to 54)
** Treatise on habits in particular (qq. 55 to 89): Good habits, i.e., virtues (qq. 55 to 70)
** Treatise on [[law]] (qq. 90 to 108)
** Treatise on [[Divine grace|grace]] (qq. 109 to 114)
* '''Second part of Part II''':
** Treatise on the [[theological virtues]] (qq. 1 to 46)
** Treatise on the [[cardinal virtues]] (qq. 47 to 170)
*** Treatise on [[prudence]] (qq. 47 to 56)
*** Treatise on [[justice]] (qq. 57 to 122)
*** Treatise on [[Courage|fortitude]] and [[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]] (qq. 123 to 170)
** Treatise on gratuitous graces (qq. 171 to 182)
** Treatise on the states of life (qq. 183 to 189)

==== Content in general ====
The first part of the ''Summa'' is summed up in the premise that [[God]] governs the world as the "universal [[first cause]]". God sways the intellect; he gives the power to know and impresses the ''species intelligibiles'' on the mind, and he sways the will in that he holds the good before it as aim, creating the ''virtus volendi''. "To will is nothing else than a certain inclination toward the object of the volition which is the universal good." God works all in all, but so that things also themselves exert their proper efficiency. Here the Areopagitic ideas of the graduated effects of created things play their part in St. Thomas's thought. The second part of the ''Summa'' (two parts, ''Prima Secundae'' and ''Secunda Secundae'') follows this complex of ideas. Its theme is man's striving for the highest end, which is the blessedness of the ''visio beata''. Here, St. Thomas develops his system of ethics, which has its root in [[Aristotle]].

In a chain of acts of will, man strives for the highest end. They are free acts, insofar as man has in himself the knowledge of their end (and therein the principle of action). In that the will wills the end, it wills also the appropriate means, chooses freely and completes the ''consensus''. Whether the act is good or evil depends on the end. The "human reason" pronounces judgment concerning the character of the end; it is, therefore, the law for action. Human acts, however, are meritorious insofar as they promote the purpose of God and his honor.

By repeating a good action, man acquires a moral habit or a quality that enables him to do the good gladly and easily. This is true, however, only of the intellectual and moral virtues (which St. Thomas treats after the manner of [[Aristotle]]); the theological virtues are imparted by God to man as a "disposition", from which the acts here proceed; while they strengthen, they do not form it. The "disposition" of evil is the opposite alternative. An act becomes evil through deviation from the reason and from divine moral law. Therefore, sin involves two factors: its substance (or matter) is lust; in form, however, it is deviation from the divine law.

[[Sin]] has its origin in the will, which decides (against reason) for a "changeable good". Since, however, the will also moves the other powers of man, sin has its seat in these too. By choosing such a lower good as its end, the will is misled by self-love, so that this works as cause in every sin. God is not the cause of sin since, on the contrary, he draws all things to himself; but from another side, God is the cause of all things, so he is efficacious also in sin as ''actio'' but not as ''ens.'' The devil is not directly the cause of sin, but he incites the imagination and the sensuous impulse of man (as men or things may also do).

Sin is [[original sin]]. Adam's first sin passes through himself to all the succeeding race; because he is the head of the human race and "by virtue of procreation human nature is transmitted and along with nature its infection." The powers of generation are, therefore, designated especially as "infected". The thought is involved here by the fact that St. Thomas, like other scholastics, believed in creationism; he therefore taught that souls are created by God.  

Two things, according to St. Thomas, constituted man's righteousness in paradise – the ''justitia originalis'', or the harmony of all man's powers before they were blighted by desire, and the possession of the ''gratis gratum faciens'' (the continuous, indwelling power of good). Both are lost through original sin, which, in form, is the "loss of original righteousness." The consequence of this loss is the disorder and maiming of man's nature, which shows itself in "ignorance; malice, moral weakness, and especially in ''concupiscentia, ''which is the material principle of original sin."  

The course of thought here is as follows: when the first man transgressed the order of his nature appointed by nature and grace, he (and with him the human race) lost this order. This negative state is the essence of original sin. From it follow an impairment and perversion of human nature in which thenceforth lower aims rule, contrary to nature, and release the lower element in man.

Since sin is contrary to the divine order, it is guilt and subject to punishment. Guilt and punishment correspond to each other; and since the "apostasy from the invariable good which is infinite," fulfilled by man, is unending, it merits everlasting punishment.

God works even in sinners to draw them to the end by "instructing through the law and aiding by grace." The law is the "precept of the practical reason." As the moral law of nature, it is the participation of the reason in the all-determining "eternal reason"; but since man falls short in his appropriation of this law of reason, there is need of a "divine law"; and since the law applies to many complicated relations, the ''practicae dispositiones'' of the human law must be laid down.

The divine law consists of an old and a new. Insofar as the old divine law contains the moral law of nature, it is universally valid; what there is in it, however, beyond this is valid only for the Jews. The new law is "primarily grace itself" and so a "law given within"; "a gift superadded to nature by grace," but not a "written law." In this sense, as sacramental grace, the new law justifies. It contains, however, an "ordering" of external and internal conduct and so regarded is, as a matter of course, identical with both the old law and the law of nature. The ''consilia ''show how one may attain the end "better and more expediently" by full renunciation of worldly goods.

Since man is sinner and creature, he needs grace to reach the final end. The "first cause" alone is able to reclaim him to the "final end." This is true after the fall, although it was needful before. Grace is, on one side, "the free act of God", and, on the other side, the effect of this act, the ''gratia infusa'' or ''gratia creata,'' a ''[[Habitus (medieval philosophy)|habitus]] infusus'' that is instilled into the "essence of the soul," "a certain gift of disposition, something supernatural proceeding from God into man." Grace is a supernatural ethical character created in man by God, which comprises in itself all good, both faith and love.

[[Justification (theology)|Justification]] by [[Divine grace|grace]] comprises four elements: "the infusion of grace, the influencing of free will toward God through faith, the influencing of free will respecting sin, and the remission of sins." It is a "transmutation of the human soul," and takes place "instantaneously". A creative act of God enters, which, however, executes itself as a spiritual motive in a psychological form corresponding to the nature of man. Semipelagian tendencies are far removed from St. Thomas. In that man is created anew, he believes and loves, and now, sin is forgiven. Then begins good conduct; grace is the "beginning of meritorious works." Aquinas conceives of merit in the Augustinian sense: God gives the reward for that toward which he himself gives the power. Man can never of himself deserve the ''prima gratis''," nor ''meritum de congruo'' (by natural ability; cf. R. Seeberg, ''Lehrbuch der Dogmengeschichte'', ii. 105–106, Leipsic, 1898).

After thus stating the principles of morality, in the ''Secunda Secundae,'' St. Thomas comes to a minute exposition of his ethics according to the scheme of the virtues. The conceptions of faith and love are of much significance in the complete system of St. Thomas. Man strives toward the [[highest good]] with the will or through love; but since the end must first be "apprehended in the intellect," knowledge of the end to be loved must precede love; "because the will can not strive after God in perfect love unless the intellect have true faith toward him."  

Inasmuch as this truth that is to be known is practical, it first incites the will, which then brings the reason to "assent"; but since, furthermore, the good in question is transcendent and inaccessible to man by himself, it requires the infusion of a supernatural "capacity" or "disposition" to make man capable of faith as well as love.  

Accordingly, the object of both faith and love is God, involving also the entire complex of truths and commandments that God reveals, insofar as they in fact relate to God and lead to him. Thus, faith becomes recognition of the teachings and precepts of the Scriptures and the Church ("the first subjection of man to God is by faith"). The object of faith, however, is, by its nature, object of love; therefore, faith comes to completion only in love ("by love is the act of faith accomplished and formed").

==== Treatise on Law ====
{{main article|Treatise on Law}}
According to Question 90, Article Four of the Second Part of the ''Summa'', [[law]] "is nothing else than an ordinance of reason for the common good, made by him who has care of the community, and promulgated." All law comes from the eternal law of Divine Reason that governs the universe, which is understood and participated in by rational beings (such as men and [[angels]]) as the [[natural law]]. The natural law, when codified and promulgated, is the [[lex humana|human law]].  

In addition to the human law, dictated by reason, man also has the divine law, which, according to Question 91, is dictated through revelation, that man may be "directed how to perform his proper acts in view of his last end," "that man may know without any doubt what he ought to do and what he ought to avoid," because "human law could not sufficiently curb and direct interior acts," and since "human law cannot punish or forbid all evil deeds: since while aiming at doing away with all evils, it would do away with many good things, and would hinder the advance of the common good, which is necessary for human intercourse." Human law is not all-powerful; it cannot govern a man's [[conscience]], nor prohibit all vices, nor can it force all men to act according to its letter, rather than its spirit.  

Furthermore, it is possible that an edict can be issued without any basis in law as defined in Question 90; in this case, men are under no compulsion to act, save as it helps the common good. This separation between law and acts of force also allows men to depose [[tyrant]]s, or those who flout the [[natural law]]; while removing an agent of the law is contrary to the common good and the eternal law of God, which orders the powers that be, removing a tyrant is lawful as he has ceded his claim to being a lawful authority by acting contrary to law.

=== The Summa, Part III: Christ ===
The way which leads to God is [[Christ]], the theme of Part III. It can be asserted that the [[incarnation (Christianity)|incarnation]] was absolutely necessary. The ''Unio'' between the [[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]] and the human nature is a "relation" between the divine and the human nature, which comes about by both natures being brought together in the one person of the Logos. An incarnation can be spoken of only in the sense that the human nature began to be in the eternal hypostasis of the divine nature. So Christ is ''unum'' since his human nature lacks the hypostasis.  

The person of the Logos, accordingly, has assumed the impersonal human nature, and in such way that the assumption of the soul became the means for the assumption of the body. This union with the human soul is the ''gratia unionis'', which leads to the impartation of the ''gratia habitualis'' from the Logos to the human nature. Thereby, all human potentialities are made perfect in Jesus. Besides the perfections given by the vision of God, which Jesus enjoyed from the beginning, he receives all others by the ''gratia habitualis''. Insofar, however, as it is the limited human nature which receives these perfections, they are finite. This holds both of the knowledge and the will of Christ.  

The Logos impresses the ''species intelligibiles'' of all created things on the soul, but the ''[[active intellect|intellectus agens]]'' transforms them gradually into the impressions of sense. On another side, the soul of Christ works miracles only as instrument of the Logos, since omnipotence in no way appertains to this human soul in itself. Concerning redemption, St. Thomas teaches that Christ is to be regarded as redeemer after his human nature but in such way that the human nature produces divine effects as organ of divinity.  

The one side of the work of redemption consists herein, that Christ as head of humanity imparts ''ordo'', ''perfectio'', and ''virtus'' to his members. He is the teacher and example of humanity; his whole life and suffering as well as his work after he is exalted serve this end. The love wrought hereby in men effects, according to Luke vii. 47, the forgiveness of sins.

This is the first course of thought. Then follows a second complex of thoughts, which has the idea of satisfaction as its center. To be sure, God as the highest being could forgive sins without satisfaction; but because his justice and mercy could be best revealed through satisfaction, he chose this way. As little, however, as satisfaction is necessary in itself, so little does it offer an equivalent, in a correct sense, for guilt; it is rather a "superabundant satisfaction", since on account of the divine subject in Christ in a certain sense his suffering and activity are infinite.  

With this thought, the strict logical deduction of [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm's]] theory is given up. Christ's suffering bore personal character in that it proceeded "out of love and obedience". It was an offering brought to God, which as a personal act had the character of merit. Thereby, Christ "merited" salvation for men. As Christ, exalted, still influences men, so does he still work on their behalf continually in heaven through the intercession (''interpellatio''). 

In this way, Christ as head of humanity effects the forgiveness of their sins, their reconciliation with God, their immunity from punishment, deliverance from the devil, and the opening of heaven's gate; but inasmuch as all these benefits are already offered through the inner operation of the love of Christ, Aquinas has combined the theories of Anselm and [[Peter Abelard|Abelard]] by joining the one to the other.

=== The sacraments ===
The doctrine of the [[sacrament]]s follows the Christology; the sacraments "have efficacy from the incarnate Word himself". They are not only signs of sanctification, but also bring it about. It is inevitable that they bring spiritual gifts in sensuous form, because of the sensuous nature of man. The ''res sensibiles'' are the matter, the words of institution the form of the sacraments. Contrary to the Franciscan view that the sacraments are mere symbols whose efficacy God accompanies with a directly following creative act in the soul, St. Thomas holds it not unfit to agree with [[Hugo of St. Victor]] that "a sacrament contains grace", or to teach that they "cause grace".

St. Thomas attempts to remove the difficulty of a sensuous thing.... producing a creative effect, by distinguishing between the ''causa principalis et instrumentalis''. God, as the principal cause, works through the sensuous thing as the means ordained by him for his end. "Just as instrumental power is acquired by the instrument from this, that it is moved by the principal agent, so also the sacrament obtains spiritual power from the benediction of Christ and the application of the minister to the use of the sacrament.  

There is spiritual power in the sacraments in so far as they have been ordained by God for a spiritual effect." This spiritual power remains in the sensuous thing until it has attained its purpose. At the same time, St. Thomas distinguished the ''gratia sacramentalis'' from the ''gratia virtutum et donorum'', in that the former perfects the general essence and the powers of the soul, whilst the latter in particular brings to pass necessary spiritual effects for the Christian life. Later, this distinction was ignored.

In a single statement, the effect of the [[sacrament]]s is to infuse justifying grace into men. That which Christ effects is achieved through the sacraments. Christ's humanity was the instrument for the operation of his divinity; the sacraments are the instruments through which this operation of Christ's humanity passes over to men. Christ's humanity served his divinity as ''instrumentum conjunctum'', like the hand; the sacraments are ''instrumenta separata'', like a staff; the former can use the latter, as the hand can use a staff. For a more detailed exposition, cf. Seeberg, ''ut sup.'', ii. 112 sqq.

=== Eschatology ===
Of St. Thomas's eschatology, according to the commentary on the ''Sentences'', this is only a brief account. Everlasting blessedness consists in the vision of God - this vision consists not in an abstraction or in a mental image supernaturally produced, but the divine substance itself is beheld, and in such manner that God himself becomes immediately the form of the beholding intellect. God is the object of the vision and, at the same time, causes the vision.  

The perfection of the blessed also demands that the body be restored to the soul as something to be made perfect by it. Since blessedness consists in ''operatio, ''it is made more perfect in that the soul has a definite ''operatio'' with the body, although the peculiar act of blessedness (in other words, the vision of God) has nothing to do with the body.

[[File:Tape art by Max Zorn.jpg|thumb|A work in brown packing tape on acrylic glass by Max Zorn, illuminated from behind]]

'''Tape art''' is an artwork created with [[adhesive tape]] such as [[duct tape]] or [[packing tape]]. It developed from urban art in the 1960s, as an alternative to the widely spread use of [[spray can]]s in the urban art scene. Tape can be used to produce a "[[stained glass]]" effect when applied to glass or plastic which is lit from behind. It can be attached to a wall to form the outline or an image, or can be shaped into three-dimensional sculptures.

Tape artists such as [[Max Zorn (artist)|Max Zorn]] show their work at art fairs including [[Art Basel Miami Beach|Art Basel Miami]].

== Characteristics ==

Tape art can be installed quickly and almost silently, making it suitable for small or temporary urban art projects. No masking or covering is necessary. Tape is relatively easy to handle, and can be applied to various surfaces, such as stone, asphalt, wood, [[aluminum]], [[sandwich panel]]s or glass. Interior installations work just as well as exterior ones.{{dubious|date=March 2016}} Unlike [[spray paint art]], tape art can be removed easily without leaving a permanent mark.

Materials for tape art vary depending on which tape is being used. Tape art can use duct tape, packing tape, [[masking tape]] or other products. Unlike traditional paintings and sculptures, tape art can be applied anywhere, including the doors, ceilings and floors of galleries. Duct tape can be used to construct [[three-dimensional]] sculptures.&lt;ref name="About tape art"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ostap about tape art|url=http://ostap-art.com/tape-artist-slava-ostap}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Doge's Palace Seen from San Giorgio Maggiore''''' is a 1908 painting by [[Claude Monet]]. It is currently in the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref name="MMA"&gt; {{Cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/437129|title=The Doge's Palace Seen from San Giorgio Maggiore|publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|accessdate=3 October 2017}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history and creation==
Monet created this work during his visit to Venice in late 1908. He returned to his home in France with many paintings incomplete, and he took a few years to prepare twenty-nine works for exhibition. In 1912 he held a successful show ''Claude Monet Venise'' at the gallery [[Bernheim-Jeune]] in Paris.&lt;ref name="MMA"/&gt;

Six of these paintings were created in order to capture the different light effects created throughout the day. Monet often made multiple copies of the same work of art; this process is better known as series painting. His series paintings originated in his early career when he and other impressionists became interested in ''[[en plein air]]'' and were inspired by the effects of changing light.

''The Doge's Palace'' was done later in his career after he had already established his artistic style, however this work is considered less successful because of the little time he spent in Venice and that he had to finish the series by memory later in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Douglas|date=1970|title=The Monets in the Metropolitan Museum|url=|journal=Metropolitan Museum Journal|volume=3|pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description and interpretation==
''The Doge's Palace'' is made with oil on canvas and its dimensions are 25 3/4 x 36 1/2 inches. 

This work depicts the [[Doge's Palace]], an iconic landmark of Venice and the historic seat of government of the [[Republic of Venice]], along with buildings of the [[Riva degli Schiavoni]] waterfront. The scene is viewed from the island of [[San Giorgio Maggiore]].

==Later history and influence==
Despite spending little time in Venice, works by Monet that were started in Venice, such as ''The Doge's Palace'', are some of his most highly-regarded artworks. These paintings capture his signature style and influence from the effervescent Venetian sunset. After this painting was exhibited in Paris in 1912 it went on to travel the world, and has now made a permanent home at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, NY.

'''The Landscape Agency''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] landscape architecture company that was founded in 1998 by Patrick James.  The company specializes in [[landscape design]], [[landscape planning]] and landscape management with a focus on the conservation of historic landscapes.

The company is based in York and is run by Managing Director Alex Robinson.

== History ==
After studying agriculture at the [[University of London]] and spending three years with Country Life, Patrick James spent four years working at the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]].&lt;ref name="AJ" /&gt;  It was there that James gained architectural experience and decided to start his own company.  Teaming up with two associates, Tom Stuart-Smith and Todd Longstaffe-Gowan, James founded The Landscape Agency in October 1998.&lt;ref name="AJ" /&gt;

After two years, James decided to seek additional start-up capital to grow the business.  The funding was successful and the company began to grow rapidly.  As the company grew, the range of the projects also widened, although efforts remained focused on historic landscape projects across England and [[Ireland]].

Early commissions for the Landscape Agency included preparing landscape management plans for [[Yorkshire Sculpture Park]], [[Bramham Park]], the [[London Zoo]]&lt;ref name="AJ" /&gt; and  Broadlands - a ‘Capability’ Brown park in [[Hampshire]].

In 2003, The Landscape Agency was awarded the London Squares garden award for its work on the north central garden in [[Eaton Square]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-24859112_ITM&lt;/ref&gt;  The company had spent the previous four years redesigning and replanting the once dilapidated gardens.

In 2007, the firm was commissioned by the [[Royal Horticultural Society]] to masterplan the Society's gardens at [[Wisley Garden|Wisley]], [[Hyde Hall]], [[Rosemoor Garden|Rosemoor]] and [[Harlow Carr]]. Then Creative Director Alistair Baldwin led the project, bringing about major change at all four sites.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/gardening/Pupils-reap-benefits-of-gardening.3511322.jp&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent projects include the rejuvenation of the {{convert|120|acre|km2|adj=on}} gardens at [[Lowther Castle]] in [[Cumbria]], the rejuvenation of [[Belgrave Square|Belgrave]], and Hackfall - a Grade I landscape near [[Ripon]] which had been neglected for almost a century.  The Hackfall project was awarded a £1 million grant by the Heritage Lottery Fund and, in 2008, the project won the [[RIBA]]/[[Landscape Institute]] White Rose Award.

The plot follows a Roman Catholic priest and a nun in her [[novitiate]] as they uncover an unholy secret in 1952 [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]].

Principal photography began in May 2017 in [[Bucharest]], [[Romania]], and during filming, the set was blessed by a Roman Catholic clergyman.&lt;ref name="Pacatte2018"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncronline.org/news/media/one-nuns-take-horror-film-nun|title=One nun's take on horror film 'The Nun'|last=Pacatte|first=Rose|date=September 6, 2018|work=[[National Catholic Reporter]]|accessdate=September 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Nun'' was released in the United States on September 7, 2018, by [[Warner Bros.

==Plot==
&lt;!--- per Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Film#Plot, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words - an overview of the film's main events, not detailed nor scene-by-scene breakdowns ---&gt;
In 1952 Romania, two Roman Catholic nuns living at the Saint Cartha's monastery are attacked by an unseen force when they enter a tunnel to retrieve an ancient [[Relics associated with Jesus|Christian relic]]. The surviving nun, Sister Victoria, flees from the attacker, a demon appearing as a nun, and hangs herself. Her body is discovered by Frenchie, a villager who transports supplies to the nuns.

The Vatican learns of the incident and summons Father Burke to Rome, where they ask him to travel with Sister Irene, a nun in her [[novitiate]], to Romania in order to investigate the situation. While Sr. Irene is teaching children the [[Relationship between religion and science#Christianity|relationship between religion and science]] in a school, her Mother Superior interrupts her and informs her that Burke has arrived in order to request Irene's accompaniment in his trip to Romania.

The pair travel to Romania and meet with Frenchie, who leads them to the abbey. They discover Victoria's body and remove a key from her corpse. Inside, they encounter the [[Abbess]], who informs them that the nuns observe a period of silence during the night and offers them lodging at the attached convent if they wish to return the next day. Frenchie is attacked by a demon as he returns to the village, but escapes. Burke tells Irene that a boy he exorcised, Daniel, was fatally injured during the [[Exorcism in Christianity|exorcism]], and Burke has carried the burden of the boy's death with him ever since. Irene reveals that as a girl, she had visions particularly of a nun, causing the Church to take an interest in her. Burke is rescued by Irene after being buried alive in the graveyard by the demonic entity.

The next day, Irene and Burke return to the abbey, but only Irene can enter as it is [[Enclosed religious orders|cloistered]]. She meets some of the other nuns and learns that they are praying constantly, swapping in shifts, to keep the entity at bay. Sister Oana reveals the abbey's history: it was built in the Middle Ages as a castle by a duke who was obsessed with the occult. The duke summoned the demonic entity through a rift in the catacombs but was killed by Christian knights, who sealed the rift with an artifact containing the [[Blood of Christ|blood of Jesus Christ]]. The bombings during the Second World War caused the rift to reopen, unleashing the entity. Burke identifies the entity as [[Valac|Valak]] and discovers the Abbess has been dead all along.

Frenchie heads back to the abbey to help Irene and Burke. Irene is attacked by Valak and joins the nuns in desperate prayer to fend off the demon. When the group reunites, Irene discovers that none of the nuns she had seen and talked to were real and she had been praying alone, later realizing that Victoria had been the last nun in the abbey and had sacrificed herself to stop Valak from [[Demonic possession|possessing]] her body and unleashing evil.

Theorizing that Valak can only be stopped if they seal the rift with the blood of Christ contained in the reliquary, the trio retrieves the vial with the key Victoria had. Irene then informs Burke that God has called her to make her solemn vows as a nun and asks Burke to elevate her to the status of a professed nun, which he does in the abbey's chapel.

After the trio unlocks the tunnel door, Irene is lured into a pentagram and possessed by Valak. Frenchie smears some of the blood of Christ on her face, casting out the demon. Burke is wounded by Daniel's ghost as Valak starts to drown Irene in a flooded chamber. Irene expels the blood of Christ in the demon's face, banishing it as the blood of Christ seals the rift. After Frenchie resuscitates Irene, he reveals his real name is Maurice. Unbeknownst to the others, Maurice has been possessed by Valak, as evidenced by an inverted cross on his neck.

Twenty years later at a university seminar, Carolyn Perron watches as [[Ed and Lorraine Warren]] present footage of their attempt to exorcise a possessed Maurice. In the footage, Maurice grabs Lorraine, giving her visions of Ed dying, which initiate [[The Conjuring|the Warrens' investigation of the Perron household haunting]], as well as [[The Conjuring 2|their encounter with Valak itself]].

==Production==

===Development===
On June 15, 2016, [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Pictures]] and [[New Line Cinema]] announced ''The Nun'', a spin-off film to ''[[The Conjuring 2]]'', which had opened five days earlier. [[Peter Safran]] and [[James Wan]] produced.

===Critical response===
On [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 27% based on 162 reviews, and an [[Weighted arithmetic mean|average rating]] of 4.4/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "''The Nun'' boasts strong performances, spooky atmospherics, and a couple decent set-pieces, but its sins include inconsistent logic, and narrative slackness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_nun_2018 |title=The Nun (2018) |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=October 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 46 out of 100, based on 32 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-nun-2018 |title=The Nun reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=September 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "C" on an A+ to F scale, the lowest of the series.&lt;ref name=opening/&gt;

The ''[[Plugged In]]'' review for the film summarized the spirituality evident in the film: "Evil is real, the movie tells us, but so is God. Spiritual trappings are everywhere. And when in doubt or danger, you can't go wrong with a little prayer."&lt;ref name="Asay2018"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pluggedin.com/movie-reviews/nun-2018 |title=The Nun Movie Review |last=Asay |first=Paul |date=September 7, 2018 |website=[[Plugged In]] |accessdate=September 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her review of the film published in the ''[[National Catholic Reporter]]'', Sr. Rose Pacatte, a [[nun]] belonging to the [[Daughters of St. Paul]], stated "that there are two Catholic theological aspects of this film that are accurate: one is that the devil exists, and the other is that Mary, the Mother of Jesus, will show us the way."&lt;ref name="Pacatte2018"/&gt; Another religious sister, Nicole Reich, stated in her review of the film published on [[Syfy|Syfy Wire]] that if Valak was a real demon, he would never be able to reveal himself while the "sisters were in perpetual adoration...because the Lord was present".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/real-nuns-review-the-nun |title=Nuns review The Nun |last=Busch |first=Caitlin |date=September 12, 2018 |website=[[Syfy#Syfy Wire|Syfy Wire]] |accessdate=September 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==
On August 12, 2017, Wan discussed a possibility for a ''Nun'' sequel and what its storyline may cover: "I do know where potentially, if ''The Nun'' works out, where ''The Nun 2'' could lead to and how that ties back to Lorraine's story that we've set up with the first two ''Conjuring''s and make it all come full circle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://screenrant.com/the-nun-movie-conjuring-connections-sequel-plans/ |title=James Wan Teases The Nun And How A Sequel Would Connect To The Conjuring |website=[[Screen Rant]] |first=Timothy |last=Lammers |date=August 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Overloaded Ark''''', first published in 1953, is the debut book by British naturalist [[Gerald Durrell]]. It is the chronicle of a six months collecting trip to the West African colony of [[British Cameroon]] - now [[Cameroon]] - (Dec 1947 - Aug 1948) - that Durrell made with the highly regarded aviculturist and ornithologist [[John Yealland]].

Their reasons for going on the trip were twofold: "to collect and bring back alive some of the fascinating animals, birds, and reptiles that inhabit the region," and secondly, for both men to realise a long cherished dream to see Africa. 

Its combination of comic exaggeration and environmental accuracy, portrayed in Durrell's light, clever prose, made it a great success. It launched Durrell's career as a writer of both non-fiction and fiction, which in turn financed his work as a zookeeper and conservationist.

''[[The Bafut Beagles]]'' and ''[[A Zoo in My Luggage]]'' are sequels of sorts, telling of his later returns to the region.

== History ==

Durrell had married Jacqueline Sonia Wolfenden ([[Jacquie Durrell]]), 21, a music student, on 26 February 1951. She knew that he could  keep a company spellbound with his talk, and wondered why he couldn't present stories of his animal collecting to a wider audience. Durrell, having criticized a BBC radio talk about life in West Africa, sent in a fifteen-minute radio script about his trials attempting to catch a hairy frog in the Cameroons. It was his first piece of professional writing. 

The BBC accepted the script, which he read, live, on the [[BBC Home Service]] the morning of Sunday 9 December 1951. The Overloaded Ark appeared in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;'Gerald Durrell: a biography' Douglas Botting chapter eleven 'writing man'1951-1953&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1016">{{Orphan|date=December 2017}}'''Theater shadowing''' is a technique used in stage acting in order to allow [[deaf]] viewers to understand. A [[sign language]] interpreter stands near the actor they are interpreting as their "shadow". Often it only takes two interpreters to shadow an entire performance by switching back and forth between different actors and groups of actors. They are also sometimes required to dance, dress in costume to blend in with the actors, and interact with the actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://terptheatre.com/technical.html |title=Sign Language Interpreting for the Theatre |publisher=TerpTheatre |date= |accessdate=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theater productions at the [[National Technical Institute for the Deaf]] often reverse this by having hearing actors shadow deaf actors and voice the signed parts.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

'''Trim''' or '''trimming''' in [[clothing]] and [[home decorating]] is applied ornament, such as [[Gimp (thread)|gimp]], [[passementerie]], [[ribbon]], [[ruffle]]s, or, as a [[verb]], to apply such ornament.

Before the [[industrial revolution]], all trim was made and applied by hand, thus making heavily trimmed furnishings and garments expensive and high-status.  Machine-woven trims and [[sewing machine]]s put these dense trimmings within the reach of even modest [[dressmaker]]s and home sewers, and an abundance of trimming is a characteristic of mid-[[Victorian fashion]].&lt;ref&gt;Tozer, Jane and Sarah Levitt, ''Fabric of Society: A Century of People and their Clothes 1770-1870'', Laura Ashley Press, {{ISBN|0-9508913-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a predictable reaction, high [[fashion]] came to emphasize exquisiteness of [[cut (clothing)|cut]] and construction over denseness of trimming, and applied trim became a signifier of [[mass-produced]] clothing by the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Hawes, Elizabeth ''Fashion is Spinach'', [[Random House]], 1938&lt;/ref&gt; The iconic braid and gold [[Button (clothing)|button]] trim of the [[Chanel suit]] are a notable survival of trim in high fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avto-ua.biz/ |title=Sewing Standards Reference |accessdate=10 April 2014}} &lt;/ref&gt;

In [[home decorating]], the 1980s and 1990s saw a fashion for dense, elaborately layered trimmings on [[upholstered furniture]] and [[drapery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jandofabrics.com/trims-tassels-cording.html|title=Trims, Tassels &amp; Cording {{!}} J&amp;O Fabrics|website=www.jandofabrics.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, most trimmings are commercially manufactured.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} [[Scalamandré]] is known for elaborate trim for [[home furnishing]]s, and [[Wrights (textile manufacturers)|Wrights]] is a leading manufacturer of trim for home sewing and crafts.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}  [[Conso]] is another leading manufacturer.&lt;ref name=conso&gt;{{cite book|title=International Directory of Company Histories|volume=29|publisher=St. James|date=1999|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/conso-international-corporation-history/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Trims are used generally to enhance the beauty of the garments. It attracts buyers. Appropriate use of it creates more value of the product.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9565">The '''Valmadonna Trust Library''' was a collection of 13,000 printed books and manuscripts printed in [[Hebrew]] or in [[Hebrew script]]. It was sold by the Trustees in January 2017 to the [[National Library of Israel]].&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://worldisraelnews.com/national-library-gets-finest-collection-of-hebrew-prints-and-manuscripts/|title=National Library gets finest collection of Hebrew prints and manuscripts {{!}} World Israel News|date=2017-01-24|newspaper=World Israel News|access-date=2017-02-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is named after [[Valmadonna]], a small town near [[Alessandria]] in north-west [[Italy]] with longstanding connections to the Lunzer family.&lt;ref name="nyt2009"/&gt; The collection encompasses works from throughout the world, particularly [[Italy]], "the cradle of Hebrew printing",&lt;ref name="bnet"/&gt; and covers over a millennium; many items in the collection are rare or unique, and many date back to the earliest Hebrew printings.&lt;ref name="nyt2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bnet"/&gt; According to [[Arthur Kiron]], curator of [[Judaica]] collections at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], "I don't know any other collection quite like it in private hands. It even rivals some of the great institutional collections in the world." &lt;ref name="bnet"/&gt;

==Collection==
Notable items in the collection include the following:
*A well-preserved set of the [[Babylonian Talmud]] (1519–23) designed by a panel of scholars and codifying many aspects of how the Talmud is laid out, printed in [[Venice]] by [[Daniel Bomberg]]; Lunzer acquired this in 1980 from the collection of [[Westminster Abbey]] in exchange for a 900-year-old copy of the Abbey’s original Charter, and supporting endowments, fulfilling a 25-year dream.&lt;ref name="nyt2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bnet"&gt;"[http://blog.beliefnet.com/news/2009/02/rare-trove-of-hebrew-books-dis.php Rare Trove of Hebrew Books Displayed in NYC]", ''[[Beliefnet]] News'', February 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This item was sold in 2015, see below.&lt;ref name=tablet /&gt;
*A [[Hebrew Bible]] from [[England]] (known as the ''Codex Valmadonna I''), handwritten in 1189 and looted the next year during the destruction of the Jewish community of [[York]], which is the only known surviving Hebrew text from England dated prior to the expulsion of the [[Jews]] in 1290 under [[King Edward I]].,&lt;ref name="nyt2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bnet"/&gt;
*A Franco-German [[Pentateuch]], probably written in the 10th or 11th century

*An 1848 copy of the ''[[Communist Manifesto]]'' in [[German language|German]], one of eleven surviving copies of the first edition's February 1848 second printing in [[London]].&lt;ref name="NYT1986"&gt;"[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE4DD133CF933A05756C0A960948260&amp;scp=6&amp;sq=valmadonna&amp;st=cse 'Manifesto,' From 1848, Is Sold for $39,811]", ''[[New York Times]]'', May 30, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

*A 1666 Dutch newspaper with a front page headline and article describing [[Sabbatai Zevi]].
*A Venice Sukka decoration from 1783.

==Collection sale==
In early 2009, the collection, estimated to be worth in excess of US$40 million, was placed for sale by [[Sotheby's]], with the proviso that it be sold as a whole and not broken up,&lt;ref name="nyt2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bnet"/&gt; and remain accessible to scholars. The custodian [[Jack V. Lunzer]], who is not benefitting from the proceeds of the sale, has stated that "I would like our library to be acquired by the [[Library of Congress]]. That would be my great joy."&lt;ref name="bnet"/&gt;  After visiting the exhibition of the collection at Sotheby's, a scholar from the [[Drisha Institute]] wrote of Lunzer's achievement:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The morning of our visit, I studied the commentary of Rabbi [[David Kimhi]], who is known as the Radak, on Joseph's conflict with his brothers. Honestly, it felt like just another of the many rabbinic commentaries....  Then I went to the Valmadonna. Peering closely at one of the oldest manuscripts, I saw that it was a volume of Psalms with the Radak's commentary.  In that instant, time and space collapsed as I found myself bound to every other Jew who has studied Kimhi's work since it was penned in the late 12th and early 13th centuries. That moment made clear to me that I am not simply a modern Jew studying in a contemporary yeshiva near [[Lincoln Center]]. I am tied to every other Jew through 800 years of history. I envision Kimhi hunched over his work, and wonder if his soul knows that even still we are learning from him, that his elucidation remains as relevant to the study of biblical text as it was to his contemporaries. The books of the Valmadonna – the books of our people – bring history alive [and] keep our history alive even when the communities that produce them are long dead.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Debra Nussbaum. [http://www.forward.com/articles/105933/ "Receiving the Original Text Messages"]. ''The Jewish Daily Forward''.  May 13, 2009 (issue of May 22, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In May 2011, ''[[The Jewish Chronicle]]'' in London reported that the collection was still for sale, perhaps for around US$25 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejc.com/news/world-news/48829/valmadonna-goes-back-market Valmadonna goes back on the market], by Robyn Rosen, 11 May 2011, ''[[The Jewish Chronicle]]'', accessed 21 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, Sotheby's New York presided over the sale of the [[Daniel Bomberg]] ''Babylonian [[Talmud]]'' (1519-1523) from the Valmadonna Trust for $9.3 million, the copy that Lunzer obtained in trade from [[Westminster Abbey]] in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finebooksmagazine.com/press/2015/12/daniel-bombergs-16th-century-talmud-sells-for-93-million-at-sothebys-ny.phtml Fine Books Magazine], accessed 5 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tablet&gt;{{cite web|title=Tablet Magazine|url=http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/196121/new-york-businessman-leon-black-buy-bomberg-babylonian-talmud-for-9-3-million|accessdate=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, the collection was sold to the [[National Library of Israel]] in January 2017 through a private sale arranged by Sotheby's.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; David Blumberg, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the [[National Library of Israel]], said:&lt;blockquote&gt;“''The Valmadonna Trust Library represents an historic addition to our leading collection of Jewish manuscripts, prints and books, which reflect and embody the cultures of the Jewish people around the world and across the ages''”.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The Valmadonna Trust Library will be housed in the National Library of Israel's landmark new building in Jerusalem, due to open to the public in 2020.[https://worldisraelnews.com/national-library-gets-finest-collection-of-hebrew-prints-and-manuscripts/]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2041">The '''WGA script registration service''' is a service run by both the [[Writers Guild of America, East]] (WGAE) and the [[Writers Guild of America West]] (WGAW) to establish the date of creation of [[literary property]], typically a motion picture screenplay, useful in the often-contentious U.S. entertainment field. 

The service supports the [[WGA screenwriting credit system]] but is also available for non-members to use.  This is one of the distinctions that makes the WGAE and WGAw true [[guild]]s and not simply a [[trade union]] bargaining for existing members.

Registration with the Guilds has become important in [[lawsuit]]s for [[copyright infringement]] especially where the degree of copying is very loose or vague or conceptual:  invoking the Guilds itself as registrar indicates that the Guilds' standard concept of property rights in literary works were expected to be followed by at least the registrant.

Although registration is an important part of assisting in protecting a writer's rights to his or her work and determining compensation, registration is not the same as a US Copyright.  Although a registration may constitute evidence in a copyright dispute, registration is not proof of copyright registration or ownership. Additionally, an official Copyright registration with the U.S. Library of Congress is required to invoke the jurisdiction of U.S. Federal Courts, where most copyright infringement claims are adjudicated.

{{italic title}}
'''''Western Story Magazine''''' was a [[pulp magazine]] published by [[Street &amp; Smith]], which ran from 1919 to 1949.&lt;ref name="ah"&gt;Doug Ellis, John Locke, and John Gunnison, (editors),''The Adventure House Guide to the Pulps'', Adventure House, 2000. (pp. 311–12).{{ISBN|978-1886937451}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first of numerous pulp magazines devoted to [[Western (genre)|Western]] fiction. In its heyday, ''Western Story Magazine'' was one of the most successful pulp magazines; in 1921 the magazine was selling over half a million copies each issue.&lt;ref name="hulse"&gt;Ed Hulse, ''The Blood 'n' Thunder Guide to Collecting Pulps''. Murania Press, 2009. {{ISBN|0-9795955-0-9}} (pp. 137–141)&lt;/ref&gt; The headquarters was in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Street &amp; Smith Records|url=http://library.syr.edu/digital/guides/s/street_smith.htm|publisher=Syracuse University Library|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''Western Story Magazine'' began when Street &amp; Smith executive Henry Ralston decided to convert one of the company's [[Dime novel|nickel weeklies]], ''New Buffalo Bill Weekly'', into a pulp.&lt;ref name="ah" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jon Tuska, ''The Western Story: A Chronological Treasury'', University of Nebraska Press, 1999, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9439-4}} (p. xxiii).&lt;/ref&gt; Ralston installed Frank Blackwell as editor of the new magazine. The magazine attracted a number of famous Western authors, including [[Charles Alden Seltzer]], [[H. Bedford-Jones]], [[Stewart Edward White]], [[W. Ryerson Johnson]] and [[William MacLeod Raine]].&lt;ref name="hulse" /&gt; The November 25, 1920 issue was the first issue to carry the work of [[Max Brand]] (writing under the pseudonym George Owen Baxter). Brand's work would dominate the magazine in the next decade; he would write dozens of stories for ''Western Story Magazine'' both under his own name and several pseudonyms.&lt;ref&gt;[[William F. Nolan]], ''Max Brand, western giant: the life and times of Frederick Schiller Faust'', Popular Press, 1985 {{ISBN|978-0-87972-291-3}} (p. 67)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Western Story Magazine'' was also prominent in publishing material
by women writers, including [[B. M. Bower]] and Cherry Wilson.&lt;ref name="hulse" /&gt;

In the 1930s, the publication's roster of authors expanded to include [[Walt Coburn]], [[William Colt MacDonald]] and [[W. C. Tuttle]],&lt;ref name="hulse" /&gt; while noted pulp illustrator [[Walter M. Baumhofer]] contributed several covers.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Carr, ''The Western Pulp Hero'', Starmont House, 1989, {{ISBN|978-1-55742-032-9}} (pp. 119–120).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1930s, Blackwell was succeeded as editor by John Burr, who edited the magazine until it ceased publication in 1949.&lt;ref name="hulse" /&gt;
