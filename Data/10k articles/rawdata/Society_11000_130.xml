== House of King Saul ==
{{Further information|Theory of Pashtun descent from Israelites}}
[[File:Malak Afghana.jpg|thumb|Genealogy and family tree of Malak Afghana, grandson of King Saul]]
According to the [[Tanakh]], King [[Saul]] ([[Talut]]) was the son of [[Kish (Bible)|Kish]], a member of the [[tribe of Benjamin]], one of the twelve [[Tribes of Israel]] ({{bibleverse|1|Samuel|9:1-2|HE}}). Saul married [[Ahinoam]], daughter of [[Ahimaaz]] and had four sons and two daughters.  The sons were [[Jonathan (Samuel)|Jonathan]], [[Abinadab]], [[Malchishua]] and [[Ish-bosheth]]. Saul's daughters were named [[Merab]] and [[Michal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Samuel|14:51|HE}} lists three sons - Jonathan, and Ishvi, and Malchi-shua - and the two daughters. But see also {{bibleverse|2|Samuel|2:8|HE}} and {{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|8:33|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pashtun [[folklore]] and some historians{{who|date=August 2015}} suggest that King Saul had five sons instead of four, the fifth was named Irmia ([[Jeremiah]]).&lt;ref name="Pukhto, Pushto page 6"&gt;A grammar of the Pukhto, Pushto, or Language of the Afgháns, By [[Henry George Raverty]] - - 1860 - 204 pages - page 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Volume 13 of Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics - Editors: James Hastings, John Alexander Selbie, Louis Herbert Gray - Publisher C. Scribner's sons - Original from the University of Michigan.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jos J. L Page 164"&gt;The rise of the Indo-pakistan empire, c.1710-1780 By Jos J. L. Gommans - 1995 - 219 pages - Page 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Family Tree and Lineage of Kish Kysh Qais Abdur Rashid Al Pithon.jpg|thumb|Family tree and lineage]]

{{Further information|Afghan (ethnonym)}}
The legend describes Malak Afghana as the son of Irmia (Jeremiah) and grandson of King Saul (Talut).&lt;ref name="Pukhto, Pushto page 6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jos J. L Page 164"/&gt; This name is mentioned in the form of ''Abgan'' in the 3rd century CE by the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanians]]&lt;ref name="Britannica-Abgan"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/7798/pakistanistan/129450/History?anchor=ref261360|title=History of pakistanistan|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|accessdate=November 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as ''Avagana'' in the 6th century CE by Indian astronomer [[Varahamihira]].&lt;ref name="pakistan"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author=Ch.

It is mentioned that Afghana was orphaned at a young age, and brought up by King [[David]]. When [[Solomon]] became the king, Afghana was made commander-in-chief of the army. Malak Afghana is also credited with the building of the [[first temple]] in [[Jerusalem]], the '''[[Temple Mount]]''', known later in [[Arabic]] as the '''Haram al-Sharif''' ({{lang-ar|الحرم القدسي الشريف}}, ''al-haram al-qudsī ash-sharīf''):&lt;ref&gt;Pathan tribal patterns: an interim study of authoritarian family process and structure, Ruth Einsidler Newman, Foreign Studies Institute, 1965 - 111 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Among the wild tribes of the pakistan frontier, Theodore Leighton Pennell, Oxford University Press, 1975 - 323 pages - page 31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics. Edited by James Hastings, Volume 1, James Hastings, John Alexander Selbie - 2001 - 343 pages - Page 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Tadhkirat al-Muluk, Malak Afghana migrated to the place known as Takht-i-Sulaiman and generations later [[Qais Abdur Rashid]], a descendant of Malak Afghana, embraced [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;Journal of the Pakistan Historical Society , Volume 39, Pakistan Historical Society, Pakistan Historical Society, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tadhkirat al-Muluk: A Manual of Safavid Administration, Translated by V. Minorsky, Publisher: Gibb Memorial Trust; 2nd edition (December 1, 1980)  Language: English, {{ISBN|978-0-906094-12-9}}, Paperback: 360 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
{{Pashtuns}}
According to legend, after his death he was buried in what is now [[Zhob]] [[Sulaiman Mountains]] in [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Balochistan: land, history, people, Ihsan H. Nadiem, Sang-e-Meel Publications, 2007 - - 160 pages, Page 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Publisher 2003"&gt;Pakistan pictorial, Publisher: Pakistan Publications, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In other folklore however, Qais Abdur Rashid in his old age, when he felt his time was near, asked his sons to bury him in the vicinity of [[Zhob]] ([[Sulaiman Mountains]]) at the location where his ancestor Afghana was buried.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Publisher 2003"/&gt; The Sulaiman range runs north in [[Loya Paktia]] and meets the [[Spin Ghar]] range northeast of [[Gardez]] in [[Paktia province]]. To the east, the mountain range enters the districts of [[Dera Ghazi Khan District|Dera Ghazi Khan]] (in [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]]) and [[Dera Ismail Khan District|Dera Ismail Khan]] (in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]]), and approaches the [[Indus River]] near [[Mithankot]] in the [[Rajanpur District]] of Punjab. The eastern slopes drop very quickly to the Indus River, but towards west, the mountain range drops gradually to the [[Sistan Basin]]. [[File:Afghanistan physical en.png|thumb]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11507">The '''Baharna''' ({{lang-ar|'''بحراني ، بحارنة'''}}) are a Shia Muslim [[ethnoreligious group]] who mainly inhabit the historical region of [[Eastern Arabia]]. They are generally regarded by scholars to be the original inhabitants of the [[Bahrain]] [[archipelago]].&lt;ref name="orig"/&gt; Most Shi'i Bahraini citizens are ethnic Baharna. Regions with most of the population are in Eastern Arabia ([[Bahrain]], [[Qatif]], [[al-Hasa]]), with historical diaspora populations in [[Kuwait]], (see [[Baharna in Kuwait]]), [[Qatar]], [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Oman]], [[Iran]], and [[Iraq]]. Some Bahrainis are from other parts of the world too. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2011/07/2011725145048574888.html&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com.au/books?id=bJLjAKH7-rIC&amp;pg=PA135&amp;dq=&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The origin of Baharna is uncertain;&lt;ref name="orig"/&gt;  there are different theories regarding their origins. Several Western scholars believe the Baharna originate from Bahrain's pre-Islamic population which consisted of [[Arab Christians|partially-Christianized Arabs]],&lt;ref name="maj"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=_--lK2ZGp8gC&amp;pg=PA14&lt;/ref&gt; Persian [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]], [[Jews]]&lt;ref name="orig"/&gt; ([[History of the Jews in Bahrain|in Bahrain]]) and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]-speaking agriculturalists.&lt;ref name="maj"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bJLjAKH7-rIC&amp;pg=PR24&amp;dq|title=Dialect, Culture, and Society in Eastern Arabia: Glossary|work=Clive Holes|year=2001|pages=XXIV-XXVI|quote=Thus the elements in the pre-Islamic ethno-linguistic situation in eastern Arabia appear to have been a mixed tribal population of partially Christianised Arabs of diverse origins who probably spoke different old Arabian vernaculars; a mobile Persian-speaking population, possibly of traders and administrators, with strong links to Persia, which they maintained close contact; a sedentary, non-tribal community of Aramaic-speaking agriculturalists; a Persian clergy, who we know for certain, used Syriac as a language of liturgy and writing more generally, probably alongside Persian as a spoken language.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="om"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W8glrgh87kEC&amp;pg=PA305&amp;dq|title=Tradition and Modernity in Arabic Language And Literature|work=J R Smart, J.

Houtsma|page=98|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one historian, Arab settlements in Bahrain may have begun around 300 B.C. and control of the island was maintained by the Rabyah tribe, who converted to Islam in 630 A.D.&lt;ref&gt;[https://education.stateuniversity.com/pages/107/Bahrain-HISTORY-BACKGROUND.html Bahrain History/Background (Archived)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151011031811/https://education.stateuniversity.com/pages/107/Bahrain-HISTORY-BACKGROUND.html |date=October 11, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are many gaps and inconsistencies in the genealogies of those claiming descent from the [[Banu Abdul Qays]] in Bahrain, therefore Baharna are probably descendants of an ethnically-mixed population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2yROvV2N0QMC&amp;pg=PA107 |title=Constructing Al-Azd: Tribal Identity and Society in the Early Islamic Centuries|author=Brian John Ulrich|page=107|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahraini society has traditionally divided itself into three genealogical categories in order: ''ansab'' (clear genealogies), ''la ansab'' (unclear genealogies) and ''bani khudair'' (foreigner).&lt;ref name="ansab"/&gt; Baharna were "la ansab" because they have uncertain ancestry.&lt;ref name="ansab"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hsU798UPaeYC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq|title=Iranians in Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates|work=Eric Andrew McCoy|pages=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bahrani Arabic]] dialect exhibits [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] and [[Syriac language|Syriac]] features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_uhvUA428fcC&amp;pg=PA269&amp;dq|title=Non-Arabic Semitic elements in the Arabic dialects of Eastern Arabia|work=Clive Holes|pages=270–279|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="per"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bJLjAKH7-rIC&amp;pg=PR29&amp;dq|title=Dialect, Culture, and Society in Eastern Arabia: Glossary|work=Clive Holes|year=2001|pages=XXIX-XXX}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sedentary people of pre-Islamic Bahrain were Aramaic speakers and to some degree Persian speakers, while Syriac functioned as a [[liturgical language]].&lt;ref name="om"/&gt;  The Bahrani dialect might have borrowed the Akkadian, Aramaic and Syriac features from [[Mesopotamian Arabic]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bJLjAKH7-rIC&amp;pg=PR27 Dialect, Culture, and Society in Eastern Arabia: Glossary  By Clive Holes]. Page XXIX&lt;/ref&gt;

Since only little is known about their ancestry, Robert Hay referred to the Baharna as "Arabs without a [[pedigree chart|pedigree]]".&lt;ref name="orig"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/7942/1/7942_4940.PDF?+UkUDh:CyT|title=Social and political change in Bahrain since the First World War|pages=46–47|work=[[Durham University]]|year=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Robert Bertram Serjeant]], the Baharna may be the [[Arabized]] "descendants of converts from the original population of Christians (Aramaeans), [[Mizrahi Jews|Jews]] and [[Persian people|ancient Persians (Majus)]] inhabiting the island and cultivated coastal provinces of [[Eastern Arabia]] at the time of the [[Early Muslim conquests|Arab conquest]]".&lt;ref name="maj"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/614301?uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21103732479057|title=Fisher-folk and fish-traps in al-Bahrain|author=[[Robert Bertram Serjeant]]|publisher=[[SOAS]]|page=488|year=1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
{{See also|Ajam of Bahrain}}
The term ''Bahrani'' serves to distinguish the Bahrani people from other Shia in Bahrain, such as the [[Persian people|ethnic Persian]] Bahrainis who fall under the term ''[[Ajam]]'', as well as from the [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] [[Najd]]i immigrants in Bahrain who are known as ''Al Arab'' ("Arabs").&lt;ref&gt;Lorimer, John Gordon, ''Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, Oman and Central Arabia'', republished by Gregg International Publishers Limited Westemead. Farnborough, Hants., England and Irish University Press, Shannon, Irelend. Printed in Holland, 1970, Vol. II A, entries on "Bahrain" and "Baharna"&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Hasawis" of [[al-Hasa]] are ethnically distant from Bahranis.&lt;ref name="hasa"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hsU798UPaeYC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq|title=Iranians in Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates: Migration, minorities, and identities in the Persian Gulf Arab States|work=Himanshu Prabha Ray |year=2008|pages=68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a43C-4RKGcgC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq|title=Reaching for Power: The Shi'a in the Modern Arab World|work=Yitzhak Nakash |year=2006|pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Arab Emirates]], the term "Baharna" refers to Arabic-speaking Shia regardless of their origins.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hsU798UPaeYC&amp;pg=PA77 Iranians in Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates: Migration, Minorities, and Identities in the Persian Gulf Arab States] Google Books&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
In Arabic, ''bahrayn'' is the [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]] form of ''bahr'' ("sea"), so ''al-Bahrayn'' means "the Two Seas". However, which two seas were originally intended remains in dispute.&lt;ref name="EoI"/&gt; The term appears five times in the [[Quran|Qur'an]], but does not refer to the modern island{{mdash}}originally known to the Arabs as "Awal"{{mdash}}but rather to the oasis of [[Qatif]] and Hajar (modern [[al-Hasa]]).&lt;ref name="EoI"&gt;''Encyclopedia of Islam,'' Vol. I. "Bahrayn", p. 941. E.J. Brill (Leiden), 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear when the term began to refer exclusively to [[Awal]], but it was probably after the 15th century.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Today, Bahrain's "two seas" are instead generally taken to be the bay east and west of the island,&lt;ref&gt;Room, Adrian. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=M1JIPAN-eJ4C&amp;pg=PA45 Origins and Meanings of the Names for 6,600 Countries, Cities, Territories, Natural Features and Historic Sites]''. 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-7864-2248-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the seas north and south of the island,{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} or the salt and fresh water present above and below the ground.&lt;ref name="Faroughy"&gt;Faroughy, Abbas. ''The Bahrein Islands (750–1951): A Contribution to the Study of Power Politics in the Persian Gulf.'' Verry, Fisher &amp; Co. (New York), 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to wells, there are places in the sea north of Bahrain where fresh water bubbles up in the middle of the salt water, noted by visitors since antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;Rice, Michael. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=kWRfe7AdVaYC The Archaeology of the Arabian Gulf, c. 5000-323 BC]''. Routledge, 1994. {{ISBN|0415032687}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternate theory offered by al-Ahsa was that the two seas were the [[Persian Gulf]] and a peaceful lake on the mainland;{{which|date=September 2011}} still another provided by [[Ismail ibn Hammad al-Jawhari]] is that the more formal name ''Bahri'' (lit. "belonging to the sea") would have been misunderstood and so was opted against.&lt;ref name="Faroughy"/&gt;

==History==
{{main|Eastern Arabia#History}}
Local anecdotal evidence suggests that the Baharna's Arab ancestry is diverse as some word variants spoken in the dialects of the native people of the villages of Bani Jamra and A'ali are only used in places as far as Yemen and Oman.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_eqzAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA39 Language Variation And Change In A Modernising Arab State: The Case Of Bahrain] Google Books&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the [[Banu Abdul Qays]] in Eastern Arabia were mostly [[Nestorianism|Nestorian Christians]] before the seventh century.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hellyer. ''[http://www.adias-uae.com/publications/hellyer01b.pdf Nestorian Christianity in the Pre-Islamic UAE and Southeastern Arabia]'', Journal of Social Affairs, volume 18, number 72, winter 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Paravar are to be found all over Sri Lanka. Amongst [[Sri Lankan Tamils]] Paravar are still a fishing and trading caste although commonly confused with the [[Karaiyar]]. The Bharatas or Bharatakula identity is maintained by a relatively prosperous merchant group from India that settled amongst the Sinhalese in the Negombo area.&lt;ref name="thawfeeq"&gt;[http://www.nation.lk/2007/08/19/special9.htm imitri Mascarenhas and the Negombo connection] The Nation - August 19, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assimilation===
Along with [[Colombo Chetty]] and other relatively recent merchant groups from South India, there is rapid [[Sinhalisation]] or assimilation with the Sinhalese majority. But unlike the Colombo Chettys many still speak Tamil at home and even have marital relationships in India.

According to recent Sri Lankan census categories in July 2001, Bharatakula has been moved out of [[Sri Lankan Tamil]] category to simply as a separate ethnic group ''Bharatha.'' {{ref|1}}

==Areas of inhabitation==
They are primarily found in capital [[Colombo]] and in towns north of it, namely [[Negombo]] in the Western Province.

==Names==
Common last names adopted by Bharatkulas include Corera's, Croos, de Croos, Fernando, Ferdinandes, Paiva, Peeris, Miranda, Motha, Corera, Costa, Rayan, Rayen, Rodrigo, Leon, Vaz, and Rubeiro. Fernando is the commonest last name. The related Paldanos are descended from the Portuguese military officers (''[[Paladin|Paladinos]]'') who married into the community.

The '''British diaspora in Africa''' is a population group broadly defined as English-speaking [[White Africans of European ancestry|white Africans]] of mainly (but not only) [[British people|British]] descent who live in or come from [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. The majority live in [[South Africa]] and other [[Southern Africa]]n countries including [[Zimbabwe]] ([[Southern Rhodesia]]), [[Namibia]] ([[South West Africa]]), [[Botswana]] ([[Bechuanaland Protectorate]]), [[Zambia]] ([[Northern Rhodesia]]), [[Lesotho]] ([[Basutoland]]) and [[Swaziland]] (Formerly under British rule). There are also sizable numbers in [[Kenya]] ([[Kenya Colony]]), [[Nigeria]] ([[British Nigeria]]) and [[Ghana]] ([[Gold Coast Colony]]). Their [[first language]] is usually [[English language|English]]. The majority of white Africans who speak English as a first language are of British and [[Irish people|Irish]] descent.

&lt;!-- South African colonies --&gt;
Although there were earlier British settlements along the [[West Africa]]n coast to facilitate the British [[Atlantic slave trade]], British settlement in [[Africa]] only began in earnest at the end of the eighteenth century, at the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. British settlement in the Cape gained momentum following the second British occupation of the [[Dutch Cape Colony]] in 1806, and the subsequent encouragement of [[1820 Settlers|British settlers]] in [[Albany, South Africa|Albany]] ("Settler Country") in order to consolidate the [[British Cape Colony]]'s eastern frontier during the [[Xhosa Wars|Cape Frontier Wars]] against the [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kopstein|first=Jeffrey|title=Comparative Politics: Interests, Identities, and Institutions in a Changing Global Order|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521633567|page=434|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Comparative_Politics.html?id=Gh3PVi6II54C&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Colony of Natal|Natal]] in southeastern Africa was proclaimed a [[Crown colony|British colony]] in 1843. Following the defeat of the [[Boer]]s in the [[Second Boer War]] in 1902, Britain annexed the [[Boer Republics]] of the [[South African Republic|Transvaal Republic]] and the [[Orange Free State]].

&lt;!-- Missionaries/explorers --&gt;
[[Scottish people|Scottish]] medical [[missionary]] [[David Livingstone]] famously explored Africa, and it is believed he was the first [[Europe]]an to set eyes on [[Victoria Falls, Zambia|Victoria Falls]] in 1855. He is a key character in African history, being one of the first well-known Britons to believe his heart was in Africa.

&lt;!-- Mineral resources etc --&gt;
In the late nineteenth century, the discovery of [[gold]] in the [[Witwatersrand]] and [[diamond]]s in [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]] encouraged further settlement by the British, Australians, Americans and Canadians. The search for [[mineral]] [[resource]]s also drove expansion north. Mining magnate [[Cecil Rhodes]] dreamed of a British Africa linked from [[Cape Town]] to [[Cairo]], and the [[British South Africa Company]] he founded in 1889 [[Company rule in Rhodesia|controlled]] the territory named [[Rhodesia (name)|Rhodesia]] after him, which later became known as [[Southern Rhodesia|(Southern) Rhodesia]] (now [[Zimbabwe]]) and [[Northern Rhodesia]] (now [[Zambia]]). Simultaneously, British settlers began expansion into the fertile uplands (the "[[White Highlands]]") of [[East Africa Protectorate|British East Africa]] (now [[Kenya]]).

&lt;!-- Decolonisation --&gt;
As a result of the ideological rise of anti-[[colonialism]] throughout the [[British Empire]] and the post-[[World War II]] [[decolonization of Africa|decolonisation of Africa]], British colonies and [[protectorate]]s in Africa eventually became [[Self-governance|self-governing]], but not necessarily with [[majority rule]]. Often aided by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] expertise and weapons, [[Black nationalism|black nationalist]] [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] forces such as the [[Mau Mau Uprising|Mau Mau]] in Kenya, [[Zimbabwe African National Union|ZANU]] in [[Rhodesia]] and [[Umkhonto we Sizwe|MK]] in [[South Africa]] fought for majority rule, which normally meant "[[one man, one vote]]".

&lt;!-- before independence --&gt;
A [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|unilateral declaration of independence]] (UDI) occurred in 1965. [[Rhodesian Bush War|Civil war]] lasted until 1979.

{{see also|History of South Africa (1910–48)|Apartheid in South Africa}}
In 1910 four separate [[British colonies]] in Southern Africa united to form the [[Union of South Africa]], which was governed as a [[constitutional monarchy]] within the [[British Empire]] under [[Dominant minority|white minority rule]]. In 1931 the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] granted the Union full legislative independence from Britain, leading it to become an independent [[Commonwealth realm|realm]] within what would come to be known as the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]].&lt;ref name=CommonwealthSA/&gt; The majority of the British diaspora supported the [[United Party (South Africa)|United Party]], led by [[J.

The British diaspora population has declined since the early 1990s as a result of a low [[birth rate]] relative to that of other population groups and emigration. Reasons for emigration include [[Crime in South Africa|crime]], [[Corruption in South Africa|corruption]], poor service delivery and [[Affirmative action#South Africa|affirmative action]].&lt;ref name=Haynie/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wende/&gt; A crude estimate of the British diaspora population is the number of [[white South African]]s who speak English as a first language, representing 1.6 million people, 36% of the white population group and 3% of the total population in the [[South African National Census of 2011]]. This number is an overstatement as it includes people of other ancestral origins who have [[Cultural assimilation|assimilated]] into the white English-speaking population. The English-speaking population is largest in the [[KwaZulu-Natal]] province and in cities such as [[Johannesburg]] and [[Cape Town]].&lt;ref name=Census2011/&gt;

===Global presence===
{{see also|South African diaspora}}
A significant number of the British diaspora in Africa have emigrated to other [[Member states of the Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth states]] such as the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Canada]]. Others have settled in countries such as the [[United States]], the [[Republic of Ireland]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Spain]], [[Argentina]], [[Mexico]] and [[Brazil]]. A large number of young people are also taking advantage of [[working holiday visa]]s made available by the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth states.&lt;ref name=Wende/&gt;

==Culture==
{{See also|Culture of South Africa}}
White Africans, including the British diaspora, generally enjoy an outdoor lifestyle and sports. The ''[[Regional variations of barbecue#South Africa|braai]]'' is a popular way to gather with friends and family. Other popular pastimes include visiting game reserves, hiking, camping and recreational angling. There is a particular appreciation of country life and farming. Farmers themselves generally prefer holiday houses at the coast. In other ways, the culture of the British diaspora derives from their British ancestry. Afternoon tea – in fact, tea at any time of day – is still widespread as are pastimes such as gardening and reading. Families who live in the country are usually familiar with pastimes such as horseriding and shooting. White South African culture was encapsulated in the 1970s [[Chevrolet]] radio [[jingle]] "Braaivleis, rugby, sunny skies and Chevrolet" based on the United States version "Baseball, hot dogs, apple pie and Chevrolet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Braaivleis, rugby, sunny skies and Chevrolet|url=http://www.cbn.co.za/motoring.php?motor_id=26|accessdate=14 July 2013|newspaper=Cape Business News|date=February 2004|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622212242/http://www.cbn.co.za/motoring.php?motor_id=26|archivedate=22 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kimbrough|first=Bobby|title=Baseball, Hot Dogs, Apple Pie and Chevrolet – Worldwide Chevy Tunes|url=http://www.chevyhardcore.com/news/baseball-hot-dogs-apple-pie-and-chevrolet-worldwide-chevy-tunes/|accessdate=14 July 2013|publisher=Power Automedia|date=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although nationwide [[television in South Africa]] was introduced in 1976, many older South Africans of British descent had little exposure to British television and humour as a result of an [[Equity (trade union)|Equity union]] ban on British television programme sales to South Africa during apartheid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Macdonald|first=Marianne|title=Ban on sale of TV shows to South Africa lifted: Anti-apartheid blockade by actors' union dropped following reform of broadcasting, but opposition to touring remains|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/ban-on-sale-of-tv-shows-to-south-africa-lifted-antiapartheid-blockade-by-actors-union-dropped-following-reform-of-broadcasting-but-opposition-to-touring-remains-1503272.html|accessdate=14 July 2013|newspaper=The Independent|date=10 November 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Herbert Baker clocktower, Rhodes University, 2004.jpg|right|200px|thumb|heart of the [[Rhodes University|Rhodes]] campus]]
Many white Africans speak a unique dialect of English. [[South African English]] is influenced by [[Afrikaans]] and the [[Bantu languages]]. The considerable Afrikaans influence can be seen from words such as ''braai'', ''trek'', ''lekker'' and ''ja'' in common usage. Some [[Zulu language|Zulu]] and [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] words such as ''[[millipede|shongololo]]'', ''[[muti]]'', ''[[Ubuntu (philosophy)|ubuntu]]'' and ''fundi'' (meaning an "expert") are also commonly used. Although South African slang is used by many younger South Africans, it would be unusual to hear it used among older people. The common greeting "howzit!" comes from the Afrikaans ''hoezit!'' (or "how is it?") and can be likened to the US "howdy", the Australian "g'day", the Irish "howya?" or the recent British "all right?".

[[Rhodes University]] in [[Grahamstown]] houses the Dictionary Unit for South African English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DSAE|url=http://www.ru.ac.za/dsae/|publisher=Rhodes University|accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth edition of ''A Dictionary of South African English'' was published in 1991,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Branford|first=Jean and William|title=A Dictionary of South African English|year=1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Cape Town|isbn=9780195705959|edition=4th ed., 2.impr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the second edition of the ''Oxford South African Concise Dictionary'' was published in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford South African Concise Dictionary|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Cape Town|isbn=9780195982183|edition=2nd }}&lt;/ref&gt; The English Academy of Southern Africa founded in 1961 is dedicated to promoting the effective use of English as a dynamic language in Southern Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=English Academy of Southern Africa|url=http://www.englishacademy.co.za/|accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
The British diaspora in Africa has a long literary tradition, and has produced a number of notable [[novelist]]s and [[poet]]s, including [[Doris Lessing]], [[Olive Schreiner]], [[Guy Butler (poet)|Guy Butler]] and [[Roy Campbell (poet)|Roy Campbell]]. A traditional South African storybook is [[James Percy FitzPatrick|Percy FitzPatrick]]'s ''[[Jock of the Bushveld]]'', which describes his journey as a wagon driver with his dog Jock. Other significant African writers of British descent are [[Nadine Gordimer]], [[Alan Paton]], [[Peter Godwin (writer)|Peter Godwin]], [[Alexandra Fuller]] and [[Bryce Courtenay]].

===Arts===
The British diaspora has influenced modern African arts, and has often incorporated other African cultures. [[Athol Fugard]] is a significant playwright. Born of an Irish Catholic father and an Afrikaner mother, he has always described himself as an Afrikaner but he wrote in English to reach a larger audience. [[Sharlto Copley]] is a significant film actor, producer and director. He starred in the [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-nominated [[science fiction film]] ''[[District 9]]'', which was an international box office hit and received widespread critical acclaim. ''District 9'' drew heavily on metaphoric references to South Africa's apartheid history as well as including many other more direct references to South African and African culture. Although English-speaking, Copley plays an Afrikaner bureaucrat who experiences a similar oppression to that he once imposed on alien refugees. He also starred in the [[The A-Team (film)|film remake]] of the 1980s television show ''[[The A-Team]]''.

===Music===
Notable African musicians of British descent include [[Dave Matthews]], who emigrated to the United States, and [[Johnny Clegg]]. [[Wrex Tarr]] performed the distinctly [[Rhodesian]] comedy song "Cocky Robin" based on [[Fanagalo|Chilapalapa]]. [[John Edmond]] was a popular singer, songwriter, entertainer and storyteller during the [[Rhodesian]] [[Rhodesian Bush War|Bush War]]. [[Seether]] is a [[post-grunge]] band founded by South Africans, which now includes Americans.

===Education===
The British diaspora and their forebears have been extensively involved in the founding and development of numerous educational institutions across Africa.

====Universities====
There are four universities in South Africa that were established by the British diaspora, which admitted limited numbers of [[Black people|black]] students during apartheid. The [[South African College]] was founded in 1829 and later split into the [[University of Cape Town]] and the [[South African College Schools]]. The [[University of Natal]] merged with the [[University of Durban-Westville]] to form the [[University of KwaZulu-Natal]]. The [[University of the Witwatersrand]] was founded in [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]] in 1896 as the [[Old School of Mines, Kimberley|South African School of Mines]] and is now based in [[Johannesburg]]. Finally, [[Rhodes University]] was established in 1904 with an initial grant from the [[Rhodes House#The Rhodes Trust|Rhodes Trust]].

====Schools====
There are two categories of schools founded by the British diaspora or British missionaries, those originally intended for the education of the children of the British diaspora and those founded for the education of the indigenous population.

The first category includes both notable [[private school]]s such as [[St George's College, Harare|St. George's College]] in [[Harare]], [[Peterhouse Boys' School]] in [[Marondera]], the [[Diocesan College]] in [[Cape Town]], the [[The Wykeham Collegiate|Wykeham Collegiate]] in [[Pietermaritzburg]] and [[St John's College (Johannesburg, South Africa)|St John's College]] in Johannesburg and prestigious [[state school|government school]]s such as [[Maritzburg College]] in Pietermaritzburg, [[King Edward VII School (Johannesburg)|King Edward VII School]] in Johannesburg and [[Prince Edward School]] in [[Harare]].

The second category of schools includes South African institutions such as the [[Lovedale (South Africa)|Lovedale]] educational institution in the [[Eastern Cape]], which was responsible for the education of many notable Africans including [[Thabo Mbeki]], [[Chris Hani]] and [[Seretse Khama]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lovedale Public FET College|url=http://www.lovedalecollege.co.za/|accessdate=15 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editors=Nkomo, Mokubung O.; Swartz, Derrick; Maja, Botshabelo|title=Within the realm of possibility: From disadvantage to development at the University of Fort Hare and the University of the North|year=2006|publisher=HSRC Press|location=Pretoria|isbn=9780796921550|page=88|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Within_the_Realm_of_Possibility.html?id=_amwpUdS7P4C&amp;redir_esc=y|quote=The Scots Presybterian mission station of Lovedale was the centre of this process, with a reach that spread all over southern Africa, either by direct evangelisation, as in Malawi, or by the example of the quality and level of the education that could be obtained there.

Amongst many others, Seretse Khama of Botswana and Thabo Mbeki were pupils there.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tiger Kloof Educational Institute]] in the [[North West (South African province)|North West province]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tiger Kloof Educational Institution|url=http://www.tigerkloof.com/|accessdate=15 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and St Matthew's High School outside [[Keiskammahoek]] in the Eastern Cape. Many of these institutions were adversely impacted by the [[Bantu Education Act, 1953|Bantu Education Act of 1953]], and the Historic Schools Restoration Project championed by former [[Anglican Church of Southern Africa|Anglican]] [[Archbishop of Cape Town]] [[Njongonkulu Ndungane]] aims to transform under-resourced historically significant schools into sustainable centres of cultural and educational excellence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Historic Schools Project: South Africa|url=http://www.historicschools.org.za/|publisher=Historic Schools Restoration Project|accessdate=15 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Historic schools must be restored: Ndungane|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Historic-schools-must-be-restored-Ndungane-20120924|accessdate=15 July 2013|newspaper=News24|date=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sport===
[[File:Rorybyrne.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Rory Byrne]] with [[Michael Schumacher]]'s car for the [[2005 Formula One season]]]]
[[Cricket]], [[rugby union|rugby]], [[tennis]], [[golf]], and [[cycling]] are generally considered to be the most popular sports among the British diaspora.

[[Cricket]] in Africa and particularly Zimbabwe has been dominated by the British diaspora. Up until recent times, the majority of Zimbabwean players were from the British diaspora, including [[Andy Flower]], [[Heath Streak]], [[Brendan Taylor]] and [[Ray Price (cricketer)|Ray Price]]. Cricket in [[South Africa]] also traditionally features the British diaspora, including current national [[Test cricket|Test]] captain [[Graeme Smith]]. The [[England cricket team]] has often included members of the British diaspora in their ranks. The England cricket team of 2010 that retained the [[The Ashes|2010–11 Ashes series]] in Australia, for example, received significant contributions from South African captain [[Andrew Strauss]], wicketkeeper [[Matt Prior]], batsman [[Kevin Pietersen]], batsman [[Jonathan Trott]] and coach [[Andy Flower]].

A few examples of the notable contributions of the British diaspora to South African rugby are those made by [[Kitch Christie]], the coach who led the [[South Africa national rugby union team|Springboks]] to victory in the [[1995 Rugby World Cup]], [[Bobby Skinstad]] and [[Percy Montgomery]], the Springboks' all-time leader in [[cap (sport)|appearance]]s and points.

Members of the British diaspora have also had notable success in African [[rallying]], while former Rhodesia in particular produced several world champion [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing|motorcycle road racer]]s including [[Jim Redman]] and [[Kork Ballington]].

Two-time [[Tour de France]] winner [[Chris Froome]] was born in [[Kenya]], and grew up in [[South Africa]].

'''Carlota of Mexico''' (7 June 1840&amp;nbsp;– 19 January 1927) was a Belgian [[princess]] who became [[Empress of Mexico]] by marriage to Emperor [[Maximilian I of Mexico]].

==Princess of Belgium==
The only daughter of [[Leopold I of Belgium|Leopold I]], [[King of the Belgians]], by his second wife, [[Louise of Orléans]], Charlotte was born at the [[Royal Castle of Laeken]], Belgium. She was named after her father's first wife, [[Princess Charlotte of Wales]], who had died in childbirth in 1817.   Charlotte had three brothers: [[Louis-Philippe, Crown Prince of Belgium|Louis-Philippe]], who died in infancy, Leopold, who on the death of their father became [[Leopold II of Belgium]] and [[Prince Philippe, Count of Flanders|Philippe]], [[Count of Flanders]]. She was also a first cousin to both [[Queen Victoria]] and her husband, [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], as well as [[Ferdinand II of Portugal]]. She belonged to the [[House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]].

Her favorite grandparent [[Maria Amalia of the Two Sicilies]], Queen of France, was the consort of [[Louis-Philippe of France]], and a niece of [[Marie Antoinette]]. Maria Amalia was Charlotte's close confidante, and on her wedding day in 1857, she wore a bracelet with a miniature portrait of her. They regularly corresponded, especially later while Charlotte was in Mexico.

When Charlotte was ten years old, her mother, Louise-Marie, died of [[tuberculosis]] and Charlotte was entrusted to the Countess of Hulste, a close family friend. Although young, the princess had her own household; but for a few weeks out of the year, Charlotte stayed in [[Claremont (country house)|Claremont]] with Maria Amalia and the rest of her mother's family in exile.{{clear left}}

==Archduchess of Austria==
[[Image:Maximilian and Charlotte.jpg|upright|thumb|right|Photo of young Archduke Maximilian and Archduchess Charlotte]]
In her youth, Charlotte resembled her mother, and was noted to be a beauty, possessing delicate features. Combined with her status as the only daughter of King Leopold, she was a desirable bride. 
On 27 July 1857 in [[Brussels]], Charlotte married her second cousin [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Archduke Maximilian of Austria]], the idealistic younger brother of Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]]. Napoleon III gave Charlotte and her husband Maximilian a beautiful bisque bust of Charlotte as a wedding gift. In the Court of [[Wien|Vienna]] she was much prized by her mother-in-law, [[Princess Sophie of Bavaria|Princess Sophie]], who saw in her the perfect example of a wife to an Austrian Archduke. This contributed to the strained relationship between Charlotte and [[Elisabeth of Bavaria|Empress Elisabeth of Austria]], wife of Franz Joseph, whom Sophie treated rather cruelly. It is said that the Charlotte disliked the deep connection that existed between Elisabeth and Maximilian, who were confidantes and shared the same tastes for many things, especially because her sister-in-law was universally admired for her beauty and charms.

Charlotte spent several relatively happy years in Italy as Maximilian's wife while the archduke served as the governor of the Austrian provinces of [[Lombardy]] and [[Venetia (region)|Venetia]]. The position was purely nominal, as power rested in the hand of the Emperor and his officers.

==Empress of Mexico==
[[Image:Catedral de México.jpg|thumb|left|Maximilian and Carlota were crowned in 1864 at the [[Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral|Catedral Metropolitana]] in [[Mexico City]].]]
In the early 1860s, the ambitious [[Napoleon III]] initiated the [[French intervention in Mexico]]. France, eager to turn Mexico into a [[satellite state]], searched for a suitable [[figurehead]] to serve as the nominal emperor of Mexico. His choice was [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian]], who held no real power in Italy and was eager for a more challenging role. Against his brother's advice, Maximilian accepted the Mexican crown and the couple sailed for the New World.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalark.net/Mexico/mexico4.htm Royal Ark]&lt;/ref&gt; The imperial couple were crowned at the [[Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral|Catedral Metropolitana]] in 1864 and chose as their seat [[Mexico City]], making their home in the Neoclassical [[Chapultepec Castle]]. As Empress, she took the name of Carlota (Spanish for Charlotte). Carlota tried to take her imperial duties seriously and even undertook a tour of the remote [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatán]] frontier, visiting the ruins of [[Uxmal]].

Only months after the coronation, however, Napoleon III began signaling his abandonment of Maximilian, and the French began to withdraw their troops from Mexico. This strategic pullback was a potentially fatal blow to the infant Mexican monarchy. The situation was exacerbated by a United States blockade that prevented French reinforcements from landing. In a desperate attempt to save her husband's throne, Carlota returned to Europe, seeking assistance for her husband in Paris, [[Vienna]], and finally in Rome from [[Pope Pius IX]]. Her efforts failed; she manifested symptoms of [[paranoia]], suffered a profound cognitive and emotional collapse, and never returned to Mexico. Maximilian was captured and executed in 1867.

Carlota and Maximilian had no children, but in 1865 the imperial couple adopted [[Agustín de Iturbide y Green]] and [[Salvador de Iturbide y de Marzán]]—grandsons of [[Agustín de Iturbide|Agustín de Iturbide y Arámburu]], an earlier emperor of Mexico (r. 1822–23). They gave two-year-old Agustín the title of "His Highness, The Prince of Iturbide"—similar imperial titles were accorded to various members of the child's extended family—but never intended to give him the throne, because he was not of royal blood.&lt;ref name=rosas /&gt; Maximilian explained himself that it was all a charade to get his brother [[Archduke Karl Ludwig of Austria]] to give him one of his sons as heir.&lt;ref name=rosas&gt;{{cite book |title= Presidentes de México |first1= José Manuel |last1= Villalpando |first2= Alejandro |last2= Rosas |publisher= Grupo Planeta Spain |year= 2011 |isbn= 9786070707582 |at= n.p. |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=H2TbqVzLhOYC&amp;pg=PT326 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The explosive events of 1867 dashed any hopes of inheritance, and after he grew to adulthood, Agustín renounced all rights to the Mexican throne, served in the Mexican army, and eventually established himself as a professor at  [[Georgetown University]].

Rumors persist that, in 1866, Carlota was having an affair with Belgian officer Colonel {{ill|Alfred Van der Smissen|nl}} and that she gave birth to a son, [[Maxime Weygand]], in Brussels on 21 January 1867. Weygand refused to confirm or deny the persistent rumor and his parentage remains uncertain. Weygand was a French military commander in both World Wars I and [[World War II|II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author-link= Joan Haslip |last= Haslip |first= Joan |title= The Crown of Mexico |isbn= 0-03-086572-7}}{{full citation needed|date= November 2015}}{{page needed|date= November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Empress Dowager==

[[File:Carlota, Empress of Mexico.jpg|thumb|Empress Carlota in 1865]]
[[File:OrderofSanCarlos.jpg|thumb|Replica of the cross of the Order of Saint Charles]]

The empress was sent to Europe in 1866 to find help from family.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;De terugkeer van Charlotte Paperback. Juli 1867 – een delicate opdracht voor baron Adrien Goffinet, Université de Genève&lt;/ref&gt; She was received both by the French Emperor and later by the Pope in audience, without success. She was possessed by the idea that she would be killed by poison and refused to eat normal food. Her secretary Batti was horrified when she drank public water from the fountains in [[Rome]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; she even bought a cat to taste her food.
King Leopold was shocked and sent the [[Prince Philippe, Count of Flanders|count of Flanders]] to Italy to visit his sister. The Empress who was very depressed and unstable took her court to [[Miramare Castle|Miramare]], Maximilian's castle near Trieste, Italy, on advice of her brother the Count of Flanders.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Dr. Riedel, Director of the Lunatic Asylum of Vienna visited her, to report the Emperor.

===Miramare===
While the Empress was resting the Emperor of Austria and the King of Belgium sent delegations to [[Miramare Castle]]. The [[Bombelles|Count of Bombelles]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and Dr Von Jilek, a friend of the Emperor of Mexico, were sent to Miramare.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The King of Belgium sent baron [[Auguste Goffinet]] on mission to get his sister home. Emperor Maximilian was captured by Mexican Republican forces and executed on 19 June 1867. Now archduchess again, she was obedient to the Austrian court, and Count Karl of Bombelles tried to keep her in Miramare. Discussions between the imperial court and Brussels became more important, because of the heritage. The emperor placed Charlotte under custody of his brother Archduke Karl Ludwig of Austria. The king sent his wife to Vienna to visit her cousin Emperor Franz-Josef and take care of Charlotte.

There she was kept in observance by a team of medical and imperial guards. The king sent [[Jan Frans Bulckens]] (1813–1876)&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; psychiatrist of Belgium to his sister.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The medical team decided that the empress could not be told of the execution of her husband. With medical approval, [[Marie Henriette of Austria|Queen Marie Henriette]] gave her sister-in-law a faked telegram from her husband to come back to Brussels.

This worked and the empress-dowager left Miramare for the last time. Together with her sister-in law, Queen Marie Henriette and the Belgian delegation they left for Belgium. After she left Miramare was returned to the Imperial Court.

Historians think that after the death of the Emperor in Mexico, Charlotte only had the status of a rich dowager. For the Viennese court and imperial family it was of financial interest to keep her in Miramare. There her fortune was guarded under care of [[Eduard von Radonetz]], the prefect of {{ill|Miramare (Trieste)|it}}. When she was in Belgium the Viennese court would need to pay her dowry to Leopold in Belgium. This theory is confirmed by [[André Castelot]].&lt;ref&gt;Maximilien et Charlotte du Mexique : La tragédie de l'ambition&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Return to Belgium and Death===
At the end the Austrian delegation allowed the empress and her sister in law leave to Belgium where the king gifted her court at [[Bouchout Castle]] in [[Meise]], Belgium. During the final years of his life the king cared for his sister. The dowager wrote notes of profound gratitude of the care she received of her brother and nephews.&lt;ref&gt;G. FREDDY, Léopold II intime, Parijs, 1905&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War I, her Belgian estate was surrounded by the occupying German army, but the estate itself was sacrosanct because Austria-Hungary was one of Germany's chief allies and she was the widowed sister-in-law of the Austrian emperor.

As Carlota's illness progressed, her paranoia faded. She remained deeply in love with her husband. After his death, she cherished all of the surviving possessions they had enjoyed in common. The bias of the historiography of the time makes it difficult to assess to what extent she suffered from alleged mental conditions such as psychosis, paranoia and monomania.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Carlota died of [[pneumonia]] brought on by [[influenza]] at Bouchout Castle on 19 January 1927, and is buried in the Royal Crypt of the [[Church of Our Lady of Laeken]].{{clear left}} She was the last surviving child of Leopold I.

== Charity Watchdog ==
A charity watchdog is a type of [[nonprofit organization]] that provides ratings of [[charitable organization|charitable groups]] based on how an individual charity's money is spent, how it [[governance|govern]]s itself, and how the charity protects its [[Donor|donors]]' [[privacy]], among other criteria.&lt;ref name="Consumer Reports"&gt;[http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/2012/12/make-sure-your-donation-counts/index.htm "Understanding Charity Ratings".] ''Consumer Reports''. Retrieved November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Charity evaluation from these organizations has typically focused on measuring administrative and fundraising costs, salaries, and assessing how large of a proportion of a charity's budget is directly spent on impactful activities.

In 2000, [[Ministry Watch]], an [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] [[Christian]] organization that reviews Protestant ministries for financial accountability and transparency, was founded. [[Charity Navigator]] was launched in 2001 by John P. Dugan, a wealthy pharmaceutical executive and philanthropist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gunther|first=Marc|title=Why Charity Navigator needs an upgrade |url=http://nonprofitchronicles.com/2015/04/05/why-charity-navigator-needs-an-upgrade/|accessdate=6 July 2015|newspaper=Nonprofit Chronicles|date=5 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, Charity Navigator provided financial ratings for 1,100 charities, and has data on 8,000 as of mid-2016.&lt;ref name=nyt201605&gt;Ann Carrns. [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/28/your-money/charity-navigator-tweaks-its-rating-system.html Charity Navigator Tweaks Its Rating System]. ''New York Times''. 27 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''[[Toronto Star]]'' has reported on some of the difficulties and revelations of auditing charities as described by Charity Intelligence Canada (CIC). The authors call it "concerning", for example, that one in five of "Canada's top 100 charities" refused to release their full audited financial statements to CIC. Moreover, one quarter of the "top 100 charities" store at least 3 years worth of funding (that is, they have three times their annual budget in savings) and some store as much as 8 years worth. Of the "top 100 charities", 14% exceed the guidelines set by the Canada Revenue Agency by spending more than 35% of donations on fundraising – with some spending as much as 50% of donations on fundraising.&lt;ref name=TheStar&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/news/article/1087637--audit-of-charities-encounters-resistance "Audit of charities encounters resistance", in The Star, by Raveena Aulakh and Amy Dempsey, published Tuesday Nov 15 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the British government announced the creation of a new government-run watchdog to regulate large charities.&lt;ref name="Neville"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/a8c5c3e4-69bb-11e5-8171-ba1968cf791a.html#axzz45Djg4aZC | title=Fundraising watchdog to oversee how UK charities raise money | publisher=Financial Times | date=3 October 2015 | accessdate=8 April 2016 | author=Sarah Neville}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States of America has numerous of charity assessment websites such as [[GiveWell]] and the cited [[Charity Navigator]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Phillips Erb|first1=Kelly|title=IRS Makes it Easier to Research Charities|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2018/05/08/irs-makes-it-easier-to-research-charities/#8631bd54ccca|website=Forbes|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to monitor and update the public on the activities of a local and national nonprofit.

=== Impact-based evaluation ===
{{See also|Effective altruism}}

In 2006, [[hedge fund]] employees [[Holden Karnofsky]] and Elie Hassenfeld formed an informal group with colleagues to evaluate charities based on data and [[performance metric]]s similar to those they used at the fund. The group was surprised to find the data often didn't exist.&lt;ref name=huffpo /&gt; The next year, Karnofsky and Hassenfeld formed [[GiveWell]] as a nonprofit to provide [[financial analyst]] services to donors.&lt;ref name=huffpo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/26/elie-hassenfeld-givewell_n_6927320.html|title = That Time A Hedge Funder Quit His Job And Then Raised $60 Million For Charity|last = Pitney|first = Nico|date = March 26, 2015|accessdate = April 27, 2015|publisher = ''[[Huffington Post]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=npr /&gt;  They eventually decided to rate charities based on the metric of how much money it cost to save a life.&lt;ref name=illingworth&gt;Patricia Illingworth, Thomas Pogge, Leif Wenar. ''Giving Well: The Ethics of Philanthropy'', Oxford University Press US, 2011. [https://books.google.com/books?id=-GpuK9OsvN0C&amp;pg=PA124 p.&amp;nbsp;124]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Singer]]. ''The Life You Can Save: Acting Now To End World Poverty'', Random House, 2009. Ch. 6, [https://books.google.com/books?id=gGn4cdxEgvEC&amp;pg=PA81 pp.&amp;nbsp;81–104]&lt;/ref&gt; 

GiveWell has focused primarily on the [[cost-effectiveness]] of the organizations that it evaluates, rather than traditional metrics such as the percentage of the organization's budget that is spent on [[overhead (business)|overhead]].&lt;ref name=huffpo-elie&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/26/elie-hassenfeld-givewell_n_6927320.html|title = That Time A Hedge Funder Quit His Job And Then Raised $60 Million For Charity|last = Pitney|first = Nico|date = March 26, 2015|accessdate = April 27, 2015|publisher = ''[[Huffington Post]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About GiveWell|url=http://www.givewell.org/about|website=GiveWell|accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first year, Karnofsky and Hassenfeld advocated that charities should generally spend more money on overhead, so that they could pay for staff and record keeping to track how effective their efforts were. This ran counter to standard ways of evaluating charities based on the ratio of overhead to funds deployed for the charity work itself.&lt;ref name=npr&gt;{{cite web|title=Young Duo to 'Clear' the Way for Charitable Giving|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=17571316|work=National Public Radio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Giving What We Can]], founded in 2009 by [[Toby Ord]], also differed from other charity evaluators in terms of the importance given to metrics of charity performance, solely focusing on the cost-effectiveness of the charity's work.&lt;ref name="rosenberg nyt"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Tina|title=Putting Charities to the Test|url=https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/05/putting-charities-to-the-test/|accessdate=18 March 2017|work=Opinionator|publisher=The New York Times|date=December 5, 2012|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ethical Consumer"&gt;{{cite web|title=Charities in the ethical spotlight|url=http://www.ethicalconsumer.org/commentanalysis/factsvgreenwash/charitiesandtheirsocialandenvironmentalperformance.aspx|website=www.ethicalconsumer.org|publisher=Ethical Consumer|accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has argued that the variance in cost-effectiveness of charities arises largely due to the variance in the nature of the causes that the charities operate in, and therefore has made evaluations across broad areas of work such as health, education, and emergency aid before comparing specific organizations.&lt;ref name="gwwc-methodology"&gt;{{cite web|title=How We Assess Charities|url=https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/about-us/how-we-assess-charities|website=Giving What We Can|accessdate=18 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, it recommends a selected few charities in the area of [[global health]]. Its work is similar to that of GiveWell.&lt;ref name="Mathieson"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mathieson|first1=S. A.|title=How charity evaluators are changing the donations landscape|url=https://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2013/jun/11/charity-evaluators-assess-charities|accessdate=18 March 2017|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|date=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Charity Navigator]]'s CEO Ken Berger and consultant Robert M. Penna harshly criticized the idea of discriminating among cause areas for being moralistic and elitist "by weighing causes and beneficiaries against one another".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_elitist_philanthropy_of_so_called_effective_altruism|title=The Elitist Philanthropy of So-Called Effective Altruism|last1=Berger|first1=Ken|last2=Penna|first2=Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher and [[effective altruism]] advocate [[William MacAskill]] defended the concept by comparing the choice to donate to an art gallery with the choice of saving a painting rather than saving people from a burning building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ssir.org/articles/entry/what_charity_navigator_gets_wrong_about_effective_altruism|title=What Charity Navigator Gets Wrong About Effective Altruism|last1=MacAskill|first1=William}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 and 2014, [[GuideStar]], [[BBB Wise Giving Alliance]], and [[Charity Navigator]] wrote open letters urging nonprofits and donors to end the use of the overhead ratio as the sole or main indicator of a nonprofit's performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://overheadmyth.com/|title = The Overhead Myth : Moving Toward an Overhead Solution}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brandt|first1=Julie|title=Overhead Costs: The Obsession Must Stop|url=http://www.ssireview.org/blog/entry/overhead_costs_the_obsession_must_stop|website=Stanford Social Innovation Review|accessdate=July 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charity Navigator has also been working to expand its criteria to include results reporting.

'''Coco Palms Resort''' was a resort hotel in [[Wailua, Kauai County, Hawaii|Wailuā]], [[Kauai|Kauaʻi]], [[Hawaii|Hawaiʻi]] that was noted for its Hollywood connections, Hawaiian-themed weddings, torch-lightings, destruction by a hurricane and long-standing land disputes. The land is on or near some of the most important legends, historical events and culturally significant spots to [[Native Hawaiians]]. The land, where the Coco Palms Resort sits, is ancient Hawaiian royal property that has been in dispute since 1866, beginning with the petition of Junius Kaae along with Kapiolani, Kalakaua and others. Their petition, attempting to revoke the will of Kealiiahonui, filed in probate by Levi Haʻalelea in 1855 was eventually overturned by [[Sanford B. Dole]] almost immediately after the overthrow of the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]]. Dole was acting as a justice of the supreme court of the provincial government after stepping down from the bench and then being seated as President. Litigants were made to sign an agreement for this adjudication to be allowed by Dole.

The resort was originally leased by Lyle Guslander from the Territory of Hawaii in 1952, opening in early 1953. The hotel manager Grace Buscher took control of marketing the hotel as a Hawaiian-style [[get-away]] for tourists. A number of films have been shot on location at this location, including [[Elvis Presley]]'s film ''[[Blue Hawaii]]''. The hotel made a big business out of Hawaiian-style weddings for decades. Buscher started a tradition, still in use at hotels throughout the islands, known at the hotel as the torch-lighting ceremony. Buscher also initiated a tree-planting ceremony to replenish the old coconut grove and honor individuals of note.

Destroyed by [[Hurricane Iniki]], the derelict hotel is allegedly scheduled to be restored and reopened as a Hyatt resort some time in the future.

== Background and history ==
[[File:Hale pili in East Kauai, photograph by Henry Funk.jpg|250px|thumb|A home on the property of aliʻi Kekaihaakulou (Deborah Kapule) around 1900. Kapule lived near the Wailua River and was well known for taking in guests.{{sfn|Cozad|2008|page=2}}]]

According to the book "''The Story of the Coco Palms Hotel''" by David P Penhallow, the Coco Palms Resort is on an ancient site of Hawaiian royalty and hospitality situated at the mouth of the [[Wailua River]] on the eastern side of Kauai.{{sfn|Penhallow|2007|page=}} The area around the mouth of the Wailua River is well known to Hawaiians as a place of many legends and events of historical, cultural and religious significance. This is the landing place of the Kahiki voyagers, who came ashore here at Kauaʻi at about 500&amp;nbsp;AD,{{sfn|Hellmann|2006|page=258}}{{sfn|Historical Society|1913|page=14}} and the location of Hawaiian legends like the prophet [[Naula-a-Maihea]] and the origins of the [[Naha stone]].{{sfn|Historical Society|1913|page=14}} On January 18, 1778, [[Captain James Cook]] landed here.{{sfn|Hellmann|2006|page=258}}

=== Kaumualii and Kekaihaʻakūlou (Deborah Kapule) ===

In 1810 the monarch of Kauaʻi, [[Kaumualii]] (c. 1778–May 26, 1824) negotiated a peaceful agreement that allowed the island to become a part of [[Kamehameha I]]'s new [[Kingdom of Hawaii]], while still allowing Kaumualii to remain the ruler. The agreement established Kamehameha's son [[Kamehameha II|Liholiho]] as supreme monarch. After Kamehameha I's death, a council was held in July 1821 with Kaumualii and Liholiho, now styled as "Kamehameha II" along with the top chiefs and advisors. When Kamehameha II agreed to continue his father's agreement, Kaumualii asked the new monarch to take some Kauaʻi lands for his wives, to appease Liholiho's guardians. While Kamehameha II refused to do so, stating that his father had left no instructions about the land, only that he should be the supreme monarch, he did take Kaumualii's wife Kekaihaʻakūlou as one of his own wives and gave his wife [[Kekāuluohi]] to his most trusted advisor, [[Charles Kanaʻina]] as a way to please the chiefs. It is believed the council decision displeased the new [[Kuhina Nui]], [[Kaʻahumanu]]. A year later, she would take Kaumualii and later his son [[Kealiiahonui]] as her husbands, using the teachings of the missionaries on marriage, to make herself their heirs.{{sfn|Kupihea|2005|p=45-46}}

After Kaumualii was kidnapped, Kekaihaʻakūlou (now known as [[Deborah Kapule]]), owned a home on the banks of the river were travelers knew they were always welcome, long before any hotel on the island.{{sfn|Cozad|2008|page=2}} She had converted to Christianity and remarried Simeon Kaiu, who was to become an instructor for the missionaries. The couple had a son, Josiah Kaumualii and in 1837,{{sfn|Peterson|1984|page=108}} in order that they may be closer to their own estates, they moved an entire retinue of people to Wailuā. Shortly after relocating, Kaiu died from a stroke.{{sfn|Foreign Missions|1836|p=357}}{{sfn|Bingham|1848|page=477}} Historian James Jarvis traveled up the river with Kapule in a double-hulled canoe in 1837, climbing to the top of [[Wailua Falls]]. Jarvis wrote: ''"She lived in a beautiful spot....that looked more like park scenery than any work of nature."''{{sfn|Cozad|2008|page=2}} It was a large house that became open to visitors in 1823. It would become known as "Deborah's Inn" where Kapule would entertain for twenty years. In the 1840s Kapule played host to the Protestant missionaries and the first Catholic priest on the island.{{sfn|Tucker|1993|p=320}} By 1853, Deborah Kapule had moved to the other side of Kauaʻi and died, and the property began to rapidly deteriorate.{{sfn|Hibbard |2006|p=15}} George Washington Bates found the residence in complete disrepair, with the canoes, that had previously transported guests up the river, rotting in a shed. Several dilapidated buildings were left abandoned, including a small church. The villagers around the area continued to grow [[taro]] and care for the fishponds.{{sfn|Bates|1854|p=189}}

=== Kingdom Supreme Court probate decisions ===

[[Kealiiahonui]] was the son of Kaumualii who died on approximately June 23, 1849.{{sfn|Forbes|1998|p=556}} On January 25, 1855 [[Levi Haʻalelea]] petitioned the Hawaiian Supreme Court as a beneficial representative of the estate of Kekauʻōnohi, for whom he was the sole heir as her [[widower]]. Haʻalelea had possession of the will of Kealiiahonui stating that Kekauʻōnohi was the monarch's sole heir but had also died previous to the petition. He filed the will into probate on February 16 of that same year. On July 2, 1866, a petition was filed on behalf of [[Queen Kapiolani|Kapiolani]], her husband David [[Kalakaua]], [[Poomaikelani]] and her husband [[Hiram Kahanawai]], [[Victoria Kinoiki Kekaulike]] and her husband [[David Kahalepouli Piikoi]], Kaluaipihana and her husband F.W. Malaihi, as well as a minor named Kamehaokalani through F.W. Malaihi. That case, involving the future king and queen and associates, was dismissed on November 30, 1866.{{sfn|Bickerton|1893|page=93}}

In the case of the "ESTATE OF KEALIIAHONUI, Deceased. Appeal From Bickerton, J." of June 17, 1890, involving the amended petition of Junius Kaae, Haʻalelea's widow Amoe Ululani Kapukalakala Ena (1842–1904), represented by F. M. Hatch made a [[Peremptory plea|Plea in Bar]]: stating that the court had already delivered a judgement dismissing the case in 1866. The decision of Bickerton, J. was ; ''"After careful examination of this case, and of the authorities, I consider that the petitioner is estopped from what would amount to a re-hearing of the original petition..."'' ''"The plea in bar is sustained."''. The full decision of the court was; ''"We support the decision appealed from"''. ''"[T]he application of one desirous of suing as a next friend of a minor, was substantially complied with. The Judge's order for the issue of process, endorsed upon the petition, was a sufficient "sanction" or authority for the person desirous of acting as the next friend of the minor to act throughout the proceedings in such capacity. Moreover, the minor in question was joined with several adult plaintiffs, and all were represented by counsel, and the case heard upon its merits. There is no claim that the case was not fully and adequately presented and tried."''{{sfn|Bickerton|1893|page=93}}

=== Reversal by Dole acting as justice while president of provisional government ===

According to; "IN THE MATTER OF THE ESTATE OF KEALIIAHONUI, Deceased. PETITION FOR REVOGATION OF ORDER ADMITTING WILL TO PROBATE, AND APPOINTMENT or ADMINISTRATOR. APPEAL FROM DOLE, J. HEARING, FEBRUARY 23, 1893. DECISION, JUNE 2, 1893". The petition reads as follows; ''"An executor of a deceased wife's estate filed a petition to revoke an order admitting to probate the will of K., who it was claimed was the uncle of petitioner's executrix, and a plea in bar thereto was sustained. (8 Hawl 93.) The same person filed another petition with the same object, claiming to be a purchaser of the rights of another person alleged to be a niece and heir of the testator, K. A party in interest pleads the former proceedings in bar. The plea is overruled".'' Junius Kaae was the petitioner who had filed a similar petition in 1890 along with Kapiolani, Kalakaua and others that was given a judgment dismissing it, pleaded in bar and sustained upon appeal of the full court. Levi Haʻalelea's widow, A.A. Haʻalelea ([[Levi Haʻalelea#Chiefly status and marriages|Amoe Ululani Kapukalakala Ena]]), pleaded the last proceeding in bar to the present (at that time) proceedings as; ''"that in a proceeding heretofore had in this Court in which said J unius Kaae was a party, the identical matter now set up by said Kaae was litigated and a judgment rendered against him."'' The plea in Bar, this time, was overruled. When the decision was adjudicated, both [[litigants]] were required to sign an agreement allowing Justice/President of the Provisional Government of Hawaii, [[Sanford B. Dole]] to continue to adjudicate even though he was no longer seated on the high court but President of the [[Provisional Government of Hawaii]] after the [[Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii]]. The court wrote; ''"Now, therefore, it is hereby agreed that the said Honorable S. B. Dole may participate in, make, sign, file and enter a decision and judgment in this cause, upon said appeal, in like manner as though he were still in commission as a Justice of said Court."''{{sfn|Dole|1895|pages=1-8}}

=== Coconut grove ===
Although believed to have been a royal grove originally, the coconut grove was actually planted in 1896 by William Lindemann, a German immigrant,&lt;ref name="Ariyoshi2009"&gt;{{cite book |author=Rita Ariyoshi |title=Hawaii |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_T88rS0xKBkC&amp;pg=PA192 |year=2009 |publisher=National Geographic |isbn=978-1-4262-0388-6 |page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; to harvest their oil and copra (dried meat).&lt;ref name="DonohughDonohugh1988"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Donald L.

Today the vast coconut groves along the coastline are often referred to as the Coconut Coast with many of the trees outliving their expected lifespan but thinning out over time.{{sfn|Peterson|1984|page=108}}

== Former hotels ==

=== Early lodge ===
By the early 1950s, the site had a small businessmen's lodge owned and operated by an elderly widow named Veda Warner Hills. She had advertised for the sale of the site in 1952 which was answered by Lyle Lowell Guslander, known in the tourist industry as "Gus". Guslander had made a reputation for himself as "cantankerous", "ornery" and "brilliant".&lt;ref name="Allen2004" /&gt; Guslander was a former assistant manager of the [[Palace Hotel, San Francisco|Palace hotel]] in [[San Francisco, California]] and arrived in Hawaii in 1947 to manage the Niumalu Hotel ([[Hilton Hawaiian Village]]) but was fired by Walter Child who was known to be equally unpredictably. He then began working for the [[Moana Hotel]], beginning as assistant manager and eventually becoming general manager. Guslander asked his friend, Henry Buscher to investigate the property for him but as a liquor distributor, Buscher gave a negative report back because he could not purchase a drink there. Although Guslander did not have the funds to purchase the property outright, he managed to get a lease with the option to buy from the Territory of Hawaii.&lt;ref name="Allen2004"&gt;{{cite book |author=Robert C.

=== Island Holidays Ltd ===
On January 25, 1953, the Coco Palms lodge opened with 24 rooms, five employees and two guests. The lodge consisted of the main residence which had been converted into the former businessmen's lodge with eight rooms and an additional 16 rooms in a reconfigured army surplus barracks. The entire property was set in front of the beach and encompassed {{cvt|35|acre|ha}} with over two thousand coconut trees remaining from the former Lindemann coconut plantation. Guslander hired Grace Buscher to assist him with the management of the new lodge. Although she had no previous experience, Grace was creative and had a good understanding of buyer psychology. During this early period, the hotel still had a sugarcane train running past the front of the property.&lt;ref name="Allen2004" /&gt; The hotel was run by Island Holidays Ltd., which was owned and operated by Guslander as president. The group also included William Newport, [[William Mullahey]] and Grace Buscher, who became the general manager of the hotel. Mullahey was a regional director for Pan American Airlines. In an interview to The Garden Island newspaper, Mullahey announced the companies plans to expand and create a Hawaiian atmosphere. Development started immediately and by 1956 the lodge had converted into a cottage style hotel with 82 rooms. That same year, Guslander removed ten of the cottages to build a 24-room wing to the hotel, increasing capacity to 96 rooms.&lt;ref name="Hibbard Page 70"&gt;{{cite book |author=Don Hibbard |title=Designing Paradise: The Allure of the Hawaiian Resort |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=REJB-dhBLQsC&amp;pg=PA70 |year=2006 |publisher=Princeton Architectural Press |isbn=978-1-56898-574-9 |page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Torch lighting, Hollywood, weddings and tree plantings ===
[[File:Coco Palms Torch Lighting Postcard.jpg|thumb|left|Postcard depicting local Hawaiian residents enacting the torch lighting ceremony at the Coco Palms Resort]]

While the exact origins of any true Hawaiian torch-lighting ceremony is not known, it is known that the use of this dramatic incarnation of Hawaiian culture, done at many Hawaiian Hotels, began at the Coconut Palms Hotel with Grace Buscher making the first "call". The ceremony would become a big part of the Coco Palms story.&lt;ref name="Allen2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Association1979"&gt;{{cite book |author=American Bar Association |title=ABA Journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yKYHQx4KprsC&amp;pg=PA1520 |date=October 1979 |publisher=American Bar Association |page=1520 |issn=0002-7596}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hawaiians dressed in a traditional malo would blow A conch shell and beat a drum, as the call is answered by one man running across the coconut grove, lighting torches on his way until the entire lagoon was lit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Paradise of the Pacific |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w3kKAQAAIAAJ |page=38 |year=1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bostwick1988" /&gt; In the book ''Kauai: 100 Years in Postcards'', author Stormy Cozad states that while the torch-lighting ceremony was synonymous with the Coco Palms, it was not actually a true Hawaiian ceremony but a dramatic call to dinner for guests using bits of Hawaiian culture displayed as parts of Hawaiian history were narrated during the lighting. Post cards from the time depict a number of local Hawaiian residents performing the ceremony including: Sebastian Alalem blowing the conch shell, Willie Carrillo beating the drum and John Keleohi lighting the torch.&lt;ref name="Cozad2011"&gt;{{cite book |author=Stormy Cozad |title=Kauai: 100 Years in Postcards |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M0fNcnVAFbcC&amp;pg=PA98 |year=2011 |publisher=Arcadia Publishing |isbn=978-0-7385-7493-6 |pages=95–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event would be followed by an hour long Polynesian themed show in the dining room.&lt;ref name="Bostwick1988"&gt;{{cite book |author=Jeri Bostwick |title=Hawaii, 1988 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dWnxAAAAMAAJ |year=1988 |publisher=Fisher's World, Incorporated |page=79 |isbn=978-1-55707-011-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruscher had a firepit built for roasting a pig in full view of guest to entice them into the Lagoon Dining Room, one of three dining areas at the hotel, helping to distract guests away from the train passing by.&lt;ref name="Allen2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="YoungerClark1972"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Ronald M.

Almost immediately Hollywood took an active interest in the Coco Palms beginning in May 1953 with the filming of [[Miss Sadie Thompson|''Miss Sadie Thompson'']] starring [[Rita Hayworth]]. The Chapel in the Palm was built by the studio in the Coconut Grove specifically for this production.&lt;ref name="Cozad2011 32"&gt;{{cite book |author=Stormy Cozad |title=Kauai: 100 Years in Postcards |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M0fNcnVAFbcC&amp;pg=PA32 |year=2011 |publisher=Arcadia Publishing |isbn=978-0-7385-7493-6 |page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ronck1995"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ronn Ronck |title=Kaua'i, a many splendored island |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wz2juGjswkUC |year=1995 |publisher=Mutual Pub. |page=105 |isbn=978-0-935180-18-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was shot in [[Technicolor]] and [[3D film|3D]] on location in and around the Coco Palms property and the Wailua River.

King wrote the song ''"Ke Kali Nei Au"'' (Waiting There for Thee) for the musical production "The Prince of Hawaii". The song was originally recorded in 1928 by [[Helen Desha Beamer]] with its original [[Hawaiian language]] lyrics. It would then be recorded in 1951 by Bing Crosby with an English translation. In 1958 [[Al Hoffman]] and [[Dick Manning]] wrote additional English lyrics for [[Andy Williams]]. Now called "[[Hawaiian Wedding Song]]", it was featured prominently in the film [[Blue Hawaii|''Blue Hawaii'']], starring [[Elvis Presley]], whose character is married at the lagoon at the Coco Palms in the movie's finale.&lt;ref name="Simpson2013"&gt;{{cite book |author=Paul Simpson |title=Elvis Films FAQ: All That's Left to Know About the King of Rock 'n' Roll in Hollywood |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lcUIAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT385 |date=October 1, 2013 |publisher=Applause Theatre &amp; Cinema Books |isbn=978-1-4803-6689-3 |page=385}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CartierLew2005" /&gt; The hotel made a big business of selling "Blue Hawaii" weddings that recreated the floating wedding ceremony depicted in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=San Diego Magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BAwkAQAAIAAJ |date=March 1990 |page=121 |publisher=San Diego Magazine Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extras for this wedding package included two singers performing "Hawaiian Wedding Song" and a conch shell blower.&lt;ref name="Thomas1983"&gt;{{cite book |author=Leslie Thomas |title=A World of Islands |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FNpKAAAAYAAJ |date=January 1, 1983 |page=131 |publisher=M.

Another ceremony established by Grace Buscher was the Coco Palms tree planting ceremony. The idea was to help replenish the trees that had begun to die in the grove planted by Lindeman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Hawaii Magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eW7xAAAAMAAJ |year=2004 |page=21 |publisher=Fancy Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established on May 10, 1955, to honor notable people of Kauai, Hawaii and around the world.&lt;ref name="Cozad2011" /&gt; The first tree planting was for a local radio personality named Webley Edwards of the show "Hawaii Calls". The ceremonies continued until 1980 and ended with the 127th tree planting for architect John Gregg Allerton. Others who have had trees planted in their name include: [[Duke Kahanamoku]], [[Gene Autry]], [[Liberace]], [[James A.

=== 2009 native burials complaint ===
In 2009 Waldeen K. Palmeira and the Native Hawaiian Legal Corporation had attempted to seek a preliminary injunction and summary judgment against the Department of Transportation for a widening project that involved a portion of the Coco Palms property.&lt;ref name="urlJudge: Highway widening project may proceed – The Garden Island"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thegardenisland.com/2010/06/08/hawaii-news/judge-highway-widening-project-may-proceed/ |title=Judge: Highway widening project may proceed – The Garden Island |author= Paul C.

=== 2016 ejectment, possession case ===
Noa Mau-Espirito, a student of Kauaʻi immersion schools and 2009 graduate of [[Kapaa High School]] who has studied ʻōlelo Hawaiʻi since his childhood, began occupying a portion of the Coco Palms resort in early 2016 with a royal land patent from the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]]. After researching his genealogy and history of the local land, Mau-Espirito discovered a link to the area. With help from a few others, he began to plant taro and other traditional plants, care for burials and the nearby [[heiau]], and clear a roadway of overgrowth with the goal of "living self-sustainably" on the land. Noa Mau-Espirito and his cousin Kamuela Kapule O Kamehameha believe their royal patent, called a ''Palapala Sila Nui'', gives their family land rights in [[perpetuity]]. Mau-Espirita stated: ''"Because my bloodline goes straight to Kaumualii, because Kamu's bloodline goes straight to Kapule, we have vested rights and vested interests in this land that nobody can take away from us."'' and ''"Once a royal patent is made, it's in that family's name forever. All the kids in that bloodline will be able to come on this land."'' A number of other [[kanaka maoli]], some who were formerly houseless and also descendants of Kauaʻi royalty, joined in his efforts. The group has had encounters by police several times but Kapule believes this is a civil matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.thegardenisland.com/news/local/hawaiians-claim-ownership-of-property-at-iconic-hotel-site/article_37b7a7c2-be72-54a6-b9c5-7b2b42b84434.html |title= Hawaiians Claim Ownership of Property at Iconic Hotel Site |first=Aldrn |last=Alayvilla |publisher=Web Archive/The Garden Island News |date=March 30, 2017 |access-date= January 14, 2018 |deadurl= bot: unknown |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170330163815/http://www.thegardenisland.com/news/local/hawaiians-claim-ownership-of-property-at-iconic-hotel-site/article_37b7a7c2-be72-54a6-b9c5-7b2b42b84434.html |archivedate=March 30, 2017 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://eapono.blogspot.com/2017/04/kauai-report-wailua-and-wainiha.html |title= Kauaʻi Report: Wailua and Wainiha |publisher= Hoʻopae Pono Peace Project |date= April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of '''Colombians in Spain''' dates back to the 1980s.

==Numbers==
In 2015 in [[Spain]] there were 145,490 Colombian nationals in Spain and 203,675 Colombian-born naturalized Spanish citizens.&lt;ref name="INE"/&gt; The total Colombian-born population in Spain for that year was 356,475 people. The overall Colombian population decreased significantly due to emigration as the result of Spain´s protracted 2008-2016 economic crisis.

'''Conflict analysis''' or '''conflict assessment''' is an initial stage of [[conflict resolution]] in which parties seek to gain a deeper understanding of the dynamics in their relationship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/conflict_assessment/ Conflict Assessment], Beyond Intractability.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in Darfur, conflict analysis of the [[Fur-Arab War]] in 1987 noted that: &lt;blockquote&gt;from time immemorial, seasonal fluctuations in water and grazing land had led to conflict over natural resources in Darfur.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eyesondarfur.org/conflict.html Conflict Analysis]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Social Network Diagram (segment).svg|thumb|290x290px]]
When there is a disagreement in the methods used to achieve an end result, and there is a disparity between a unified vision and direction, opposing sides are subject to conflict. If these sides consistently misinterpret one another, a problematic situation can spiral out of control rapidly. Conflicts are not always linear in nature. Members of multiple organizational levels with varying statuses can all partake in conflict. When undergoing analysis, it is integral to understand the reasons that spark such disagreement to effectively reach its [[Conflict resolution|resolution]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of conflict analysis and resolution|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0203893166|edition=1st|location=London|page=339|last1=Pruitt|first1=edited by Dennis J.D. Sandole ... [et al.] ; foreword by Dean G.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many schools, such as [http://www.emu.edu/cjp Eastern Mennonite University's Center for Justice and Peacebuilding], [[George Mason University]], [[Nova Southeastern University]], [[University of the Rockies]], and [[Wayne State University]] have programs related to conflict analysis and resolution. There are also various subsets of conflict analysis such as environmental conflict analysis, which deal with specific types of disputes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/research/ceca/ Environmental Conflict Analysis]&lt;/ref&gt; In certain occasions a [[conflict atlas]] is used to show graphically the analysis of the conflict. The prefixes macro- and micro- are used in conjunctions with conflicts to denote the scale of the conflict, macro referring to a larger scale conflict and micro referring to a conflicting situation on a smaller scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schellenberg|first1=James A.|title=Conflict resolution : theory, research, and practice|date=1996|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany, NY|isbn=0791431029|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conflicts can arise at different levels, from intrapersonal to interpersonal issues as well as between two individuals or between two countries as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bercovitch|first1=Jacob|last2=Jackson|first2=Richard|title=International conflict : a chronological encyclopedia of conflicts and their management 1945-1995|date=1997|publisher=Congressional Quarterly|location=Washington, DC|isbn=156802195X|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outcome dictates how we refer to a given conflict. When a result is the change in the status quo, that conflict is now referred to as a revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kriesberg|first1=Louis|title=Constructive conflicts : from escalation to resolution|date=1998|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|location=Lanham, MD [u.a.]|isbn=9780847688913|pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Identity ==

Celia Cook-Hoffman defines 'Identity' as "how individuals and collectives see and understand themselves in a conflict."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pruitt|first1=edited by Dennis J.D. Sandole ... [et al.] ; foreword by Dean G.|title=Handbook of conflict analysis and resolution|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-203-89316-6|pages=19|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Identity plays a vital role in a conflicting situation. How the opponent perceives their competition dictates how they will move forward with the conflict. Conversely, the opponent is also aware of how they are perceived and understands they are obligated to maintain their reputation throughout the conflict. This can give rise to defensive tactics as well as to [[Revenge|retaliation]]. In this aspect, identity is not unlike reputation. Identities are a [[social construct]], and once cemented, are almost impossible to alter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pruitt|first1=edited by Dennis J.D. Sandole ... [et al.] ; foreword by Dean G.|title=Handbook of conflict analysis and resolution|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-203-89316-6|pages=19–28|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gender ==

Snyder writes that women are seen as "victims" of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pruitt|first1=edited by Dennis J.D. Sandole ... [et al.] ; foreword by Dean G.|title=Handbook of conflict analysis and resolution|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-203-89316-6|pages=45|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender proves to be significant in the analysis of conflicts. Women are likely to be perceived as individuals who have no control of a conflict. Snyder also notes that women are "considered legitimate targets and make up 90 percent of all casualties." &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The majority of refugees are also females. In conflicts such as war, widows are forced to become the new head of the household, assuming all the responsibilities that their husband would normally do so. Also, When contemplating a resolution of a conflict, the lack of inclusion of women from an issues inception to execution has an effect on post-conflict analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pruitt|first1=edited by Dennis J.D. Sandole ... [et al.] ; foreword by Dean G.|title=Handbook of conflict analysis and resolution|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-203-89316-6|pages=45–54|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causation ==

Rothbart notes that factors that spark international conflict are "struggles between beliefs, behaviors, and environmental conditions as they are as they should be" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pruitt|first1=edited by Dennis J.D. Sandole ... [et al.] ; foreword by Dean G.|title=Handbook of conflict analysis and resolution|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-203-89316-6|pages=59|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another motive that inspires conflict is the need for retribution. It is said that major conflicts can arise from underlying historical disagreements that bubble over periodically. It is also found that the aggressor's identity plays a role in causation of a conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pruitt|first1=edited by Dennis J.D. Sandole ... [et al.] ; foreword by Dean G.|title=Handbook of conflict analysis and resolution|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-203-89316-6|pages=59–67|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Victims ==

In times of war Korostelina writes that "non-combatants suffer most" &lt;ref name="Routledge"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pruitt|first1=edited by Dennis J.D. Sandole ... [et al.] ; foreword by Dean G.|title=Handbook of conflict analysis and resolution|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-203-89316-6|pages=85|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; because they are nothing but victims of any conflict. More innocent civilian blood is shed than any other conflict-related party. Korostelina also adds that civilians "are war's survivors or its collateral damage &lt;ref name="Routledge"/&gt; accentuating the fact that prisoners of war are likely to be the individuals who suffer most during any conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pruitt|first1=edited by Dennis J.D. Sandole ... [et al.] ; foreword by Dean G.|title=Handbook of conflict analysis and resolution|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-203-89316-6|pages=85–98|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mediation ==
Bercovitch notes that there are several methods to conflict mediation. Bercovitch lists these methods as "negotiation, inquiry, conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlements, and resorts to regional agencies and arrangements." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pruitt|first1=edited by Dennis J.D. Sandole ... [et al.] ; foreword by Dean G.|title=Handbook of conflict analysis and resolution|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-203-89316-6|pages=339|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Saint Stephen (Sigismund III of Poland depicted as rex sacerdos).PNG|thumb|upright|[[Sigismund III of Poland]] as rex sacerdos in coronation robe, (depicted as Saint [[Stephen I of Hungary]])]]
'''Coronations in Poland''' officially began in 1025 and continued until 1764, when the final king of an independent [[Poland]], [[Stanisław August Poniatowski]], was [[coronation|crowned]] at [[St. John's Cathedral, Warsaw|St. John's Cathedral]] in [[Warsaw]]. Most Polish coronations took place at the [[Wawel Cathedral]] in [[Kraków]], but crownings also occurred in [[Poznań]] and at [[Gniezno Cathedral]]. Whenever practical, Polish coronations were conducted as close as possible as to the date of the previous sovereign's funeral. This was explained by Joachim Bielski in the sixteenth century as ''osoba umiera, korona nie umiera'', or "the person dies, the crown dies not".&lt;ref&gt;M. Bielski, ''Kronika polska'', 1st ed. (1597, reprinted Sanok, 1856), 3:1207.&lt;/ref&gt;  With the emergence of an independent, republican Poland after [[World War I]], coronations in the Polish state have been rendered obsolete.

Though many of the [[Polish Crown Jewels]] were stolen and destroyed by King [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] in March 1809 after the [[Third Partition of Poland]], remaining pieces are exhibited at the [[National Museum in Warsaw]].&lt;ref name="crowns_angelfire"&gt;{{cite web  |author = Margaret Odrowaz-Sypniewska |url = http://www.angelfire.com/mi4/polcrt/Crowns.html |title = POLAND'S CROWNS |work = www.angelfire.com |publisher =  |pages =  |page =  |date = |accessdate = 2009-02-16|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |author =  |url = http://www.wawel.krakow.pl/en/index.php?op=8,1,5 |format= |title = Crown Treasury and Armoury |work = www.wawel.krakow.pl |publisher = |pages =  |page =  |date = |accessdate = 2009-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The ceremony ==
During the period when coronations were held in Kraków, the following order was observed: on the eve of his coronation, the new monarch fasted, gave [[alms]], and partook of the Catholic sacrament of [[Confession (religion)|confession]]. He then walked on foot from the royal [[Wawel Castle]] to the [[Wawel Cathedral|Basilica of St. Stanisław]], patron saint of Poland. Unlike the remainder of the service, the royal procession was opened to the Polish masses. On the morning of the ceremony, the king was met in his bedchamber by a procession consisting of the local [[Metropolitan Archbishop]] and other notables. Wearing Episcopal clothing, the monarch was blessed with holy water and incensed. Following this, king, metropolitan and the others made their way in procession to the cathedral.&lt;ref name="bak2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gieysztor|first=Aleksander|authorlink=Aleksander Gieysztor|title=Coronations: Medieval and Early Modern Monarchic Ritual|editor=Bak, János M|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|year=1990|chapter=Gesture in the Coronation Ceremonies of Medieval Poland|url=http://www.escholarship.org/editions/view?docId=ft367nb2f3&amp;brand=ucpress|accessdate=2008-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inside the church, the Polish regalia were laid on the high altar, while the king was seated on a low chair nearby. The royal oath was administered, and the new monarch then knelt before the altar. Two mitred abbots next entered from a side chapel, carrying a mixture of holy oils, with which the ruler was then anointed. Following this, the king was handed a sword, which he used to trace a cross in the air. Next he was crowned by the Archbishop, assisted by two other bishops, following which he received his orb and scepter. The high mass continued, with the newly crowned sovereign receiving Holy Communion, then kissing a [[crucifix]] and mounting his throne. Following this, the king created several new [[knight]]s, then attended a coronation feast and rode into the public square on horseback, where he received the homage of his subjects while seated in a large chair.&lt;ref name="bak2"/&gt;

In the 1980s and 1990s there were, in the [[Paris]] region ([[Île-de-France]]), multiple instances of alleged and proved [[political corruption]] cases, as well as cases of abuse of public money and resources. Almost all involved were members of the [[Conservatism|conservative]] [[Rally for the Republic]] (RPR) ruling party, which became the [[Union for a Popular Movement]] (UMP) in 2002.

==Central role of Jacques Chirac==
{{update|date=November 2010}}
[[Jacques Chirac]] was mayor of Paris from 1977 to 1995 and has been named in several cases of alleged corruption and abuse, some of which have already led to felony convictions.

Chirac, as [[president of France]] (until 16 May 2007), enjoyed virtual immunity from prosecution for acts preceding his tenure as president, following from decision 98-408 DC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/decision/1998/98408/index.htm |title=decision 98-408 DC |publisher=Conseil-constitutionnel.fr |date= |accessdate=2013-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]] on 22 January 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/dossier/quarante/notes/immpres.htm La responsabilité pénale du Chef de l'Etat] (A Legal Analysis of Presidential Immunity)&lt;/ref&gt; This decision itself was highly controversial: the council was consulted on the treaty establishing the [[International Criminal Court]], not about the status of the president with respect to the national criminal justice system. At the time, the president of the council was [[Roland Dumas]], who later had to retire from his functions because of his implication in the [[Elf Aquitaine]] scandal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lexpress.fr/Express/Info/France/Dossier/dumas/dossier.asp?ida=420342 L'Express] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040406101016/http://www.lexpress.fr/Express/Info/France/Dossier/dumas/dossier.asp?ida=420342 |date=6 April 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chirac refused to testify before [[investigating magistrate]] [[Éric Halphen]], arguing that this would be incompatible with his presidential functions.

On 10 October 2001, the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]] ruled that, while the president cannot be prosecuted by normal judicial means during his mandate, such an impossibility suspends the delays of [[Prescriptive period|prescription]] ([[statute of limitation]]). If Chirac does not run for office again in 2007 or is not re-elected, he may then be prosecuted on the several affairs he is involved in. This might explain why in 2003 some in the presidential entourage floated around the idea of Chirac running for a third term.

Chirac's foremost critic was [[French National Assembly|deputy]] [[Arnaud Montebourg]] of the [[French Socialist Party|Socialist Party]], who filed a motion to bring him in front of the High Court of Justice (a procedure similar to [[impeachment]], which has never been applied).

==Vote rigging in Paris==

In several districts of Paris, people were allegedly illegally registered on the [[electoral roll]]s in an attempt to modify the outcome of elections. In some egregious cases, significant numbers of people were registered at the address of a hotel or of a shop.

* In the [[3ème arrondissement, Paris|3rd arrondissement]],  859 (being 5% of the registered voters) were, according to enquiries, fraudulently registered on the electoral rolls between 1988 and 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Faux électeurs du troisième arrondissement de la capitale |publisher=L'Humanité |date=31 May 2000 |url=http://www.humanite.presse.fr/journal/2000-05-31/2000-05-31-226153 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070128203834/http://www.humanite.presse.fr/journal/2000-05-31/2000-05-31-226153 |archivedate=28 January 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the [[5ème arrondissement, Paris|5th arrondissement]], mayor [[Jean Tiberi]], his wife [[Xavière Tiberi]] and alleged accomplices were put under formal investigation. According to the ''[[Inquisitorial system|instruction]]'',  7,228 people were fraudulently registered in the 5th arrondissement in 1997 and 3,315 of them voted when Jean Tiberi was elected deputy with 2,725 votes more than his opponent. On 21 March 2005, Jean Tiberi was put under criminal investigation for his alleged role in the altered electoral rolls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Jean Tiberi a été mis en examen dans le dossier des "faux électeurs" | publisher=Le Monde | date=21 March 2005 | url=http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3224,36-629826@51-627526,0.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He denied having had anything to do with the action and pointed that he was re-elected by wide majorities, thus not needing fake voters.

==Manipulated biddings for public procurement==

===Paris public housing projects===

There was a shock when a videocassette of businessman {{Interlanguage link multi|Jean-Claude Méry|fr}} was disclosed after his death in 1999, with ''[[Le Monde]]'' publishing its full contents in September 2000. In the tape, Méry gave details of kickback schemes in the Paris region; in particular, he said that he delivered [[French Franc|FRF]] 5 million in cash to [[Michel Roussin]], chief of staff of then prime minister [[Jacques Chirac]], "in Chirac's presence". "We only work on Mr. Chirac's orders," Méry said in the video. It was on these grounds that investigating magistrate Éric Halphen summoned president Jacques Chirac in March 2001 as witness, declaring that there were sufficients "clues" to warrant a full investigation. In September 2001, the Paris Appeal Court cancelled part of the proceedings on procedural vices, and removing the affair from judge Halphen's hands. In February 2005, investigating magistrate Armand Riberolles, who succeeded Halphen, abandoned charges against [[Jean Tiberi]] (who succeeded Chirac as mayor of Paris), who as former president of the OPAC (''Office Public d'Aménagement et de Construction'') of Paris, was prosecuted for "complicity in corruption" (''complicité de traffic d'influence'').&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} "Le tribunal examine le scandale de corruption des HLM de Paris, naguère affaire d'Etat", ''Le Monde'', 25 January 2006."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lemonde1"&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3224,36-356627,0.html ]{{dead link|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of January 2006, several CEOs had been prosecuted in the trial, but not one politician. 49 businessmen, among them {{Interlanguage link multi|Francis Poullain|fr}}, CEO of {{Interlanguage link multi|Société d’application et de revêtement|fr}} company and close to Chirac, were prosecuted. According to ''Le Monde'', this trial was met with "relative indifference". The previous investigations had led to the resignation of magistrate Éric Halphen after several cases of intimidation and a tight struggle against the executive power. Personalities such as [[Michel Roussin]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Robert Pandraud|fr}} or Jean Tiberi, former mayor of Paris, had all been previously acquitted. Investigating magistrate Armand Riberolles, who succeeded Eric Halphen, wrote that the "instruction hadn't been able to formally establish the personal involvement of responsible members of the higher echelons of the RPR", while noting that "a large number of testimonies, cross-checked by various factual elements, show that Jean-Claude Méry had been commissioned to ensure the financing of the RPR's political activities by collecting funds, in particular through the firms working with the OPAC."&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} In "Le tribunal examine le scandale de corruption des HLM de Paris, naguère affaire d'Etat", in ''Le Monde'', Mercredi 25 janvier 2006."&lt;/ref&gt; All proceedings leading to president Chirac had been thrown out in September 2001 by the Paris [[Court of Appeal]], leading to the resignation of judge Halphen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Feu l'affaire des HLM de Paris | publisher=Le Monde | date=14 March 2006 | url=http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3226,36-750542,0.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===High-schools and other public works in the Île-de-France region===

About 40 are under investigation for the alleged corruption at the [[Île-de-France]] regional council.  Inquiries showed that 2% of the payments from the Île-de-France council to companies involved in building or repairs on the region's high schools were to be channeled as [[bribery|kickback]]s to political parties, either through legal contributions (permitted under the 15 January 1990 law then in force), or through cash deliveries of fictitious employment (i.e. staff of political parties or politicians being paid by the involved companies). According to the enquiry, 1.2% went to the RPR, 0.8% to the [[French Socialist Party]]. [[Michel Giraud]], then president of the Île-de-France region, was one of the prime suspects. The following companies admitted to such practices: {{Interlanguage link multi|Sicra|fr}}, {{Interlanguage link multi|Baudin Châteauneuf|fr}}, {{Interlanguage link multi|Grands Travaux de Marseille|fr}} (GTM), [[Bouygues]], CBC, [[Nord France]], [[Dumez]], [[Chagnaud]], [[Fougerolle]], SAEP,  SCGPM, {{Interlanguage link multi|Société parisienne pour l'industrie électrique|fr}} (SPIE).

In March 2005, the case went to trial before the Paris correctional court&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Marchés publics: pas de corrélation entre "dons" aux partis et marchés publics, selon un entrepreneur | agency=Associated Press | date=n.d. | url=http://permanent.nouvelobs.com/societe/20050330.FAP4601.html?1916}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Au procès des marchés publics d'Ile-de-France, les accusations sélectives de Claude-Annick Tissot | publisher=Le Monde | date=31 March 2005 | url=http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3224,36-633173@51-629717,0.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 2005, former president of the Île-de-France region Michel Giraud was condemned to four years of prison on probation and to pay an 80 000 euros fine; [[Michel Roussin]], former chief of staff of Jacques Chirac, was also condemned to four years of prison on probation and to a 50 000 euros fine. These sentences were accompanied by a 5 years suspension of civil and familial rights. Louise-Yvonne Cassetta and Guy Drut were also condemned on probation. Among the 47 persons prosecuted, only [[Gérard Longuet]], former president of the republican party, was acquitted. ''[[Libération]]'' could state that: "Only one - big - absence in this trial and judgment: Jacques Chirac, whose shadow has constantly towered this four months debate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Michel Giraud, Michel Roussin, Louise-Yvonne Casetta, Guy Drut...: jugés coupables | publisher=Libération | date=26 October 2005 | url=http://www.liberation.fr/page.php?Article=333857|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=

During the tenure of Jacques Chirac as mayor of Paris, some people paid by the city government actually worked (full-time) for the RPR party.

[[Alain Juppé]], former secretary-general of the RPR (1988–1995) and former deputy mayor in charge of finances of the City of Paris (1983–1995) was convicted along with accomplices {{Interlanguage link multi|Louise-Yvonne Casetta|fr}} and {{Interlanguage link multi|Patrick Stefanini|fr}} of abuse of public funds when he employed people on the city's payroll to perform tasks wholly for the benefit of his party. On 31 January 2004, Alain Juppé was sentenced by the correctional court of [[Nanterre]] to 18-month [[suspended sentence]], as well as the deprivation of the right to vote for five years and the right to run for national office for 10 years (reduced on appeal to one year). On 1 December 2004, the [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]] court of appeals reduced the sentence to a 14-month suspended sentence and a deprivation of the right to hold political office for one year. Juppé did not go to the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]] over this sentence, and had to resign from his position as mayor of [[Bordeaux]].

Another scandal erupted after the ruling when the judges of the Nanterre court alleged that their offices and computers had been searched. President Chirac ordered an administration inquiry commission, composed of high-level magistrates (the vice-president of the [[Council of State]], and the first presidents of the Court of Cassation and the [[Court of Auditors]]), to investigate the matter. This decision was criticized because there was no legal nor constitutional basis for it: normally, questions of judicial honesty are handled by the ''Conseil Supérieur de la Magistrature'' (CSM), which (politely) protested Chirac's action. The Nanterre judges refused to be heard by the commission, arguing they should see the CSM. The commission concluded that there had been security lapses at the Nanterre court, but did not conclude that there was any wrongdoing. A criminal investigation has also been opened.

On 3 December 2004, the Court of Cassation ruled that a [[court of appeal]]s had incorrectly ruled that some cases of employment by or payments received from the City of Paris (under the Chirac and Tiberi administrations) for fictitious work fell under [[Prescriptive period|prescription]] ([[statute of limitations]]). The court announced that the cases were now referred to the Versailles Court of Appeals. The current administration of the City of Paris, led by Socialist mayor [[Bertrand Delanoë]], had appealed the prescription ruling before the Court of Cassation. Among the suspects are the [[French National Assembly|deputy]] of Paris [[Jean de Gaulle]], former minister Robert Pandraud etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Rebondissements dans une affaire d'emplois fictifs | publisher=Agence France Presse | date=3 December 2004 | url=http://news.tf1.fr/news/france/0,,3188872,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Essonne===
[[Xavière Tiberi]], the spouse of mayor of Paris [[Jean Tiberi]], received [[French Franc|FRF]] 200,000 (approx. [[Euro|€]]30,000) for a report on [[francophonie]] for the general council of the [[Essonne]] ''[[département]]''. This 36-page report, possibly written after the payment as a justification, was extremely poorly written and contained numerous [[spelling]] and [[grammar|grammatical]] mistakes.&lt;ref name="lemonde1"/&gt;

==Illegal use of government services==

===Usage of City of Paris gardening services for private purposes===

In 2004, mayor [[Bertrand Delanoë]] filed a complaint for the past abuse of City of Paris gardening services for private purposes, estimating the public losses to at least €700,000. Individuals close to the RPR allegedly enjoyed free gardening services from City of Paris employees in their houses of the upscale areas of Paris and suburbs. City supplies were allegedly also taken for private usage.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Le Canard Enchaîné]]'', 31 March 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|Domestic violence in Guyana|other related topics|Outline of domestic violence}}

[[Domestic violence]] in [[Guyana]] is widespread and crosses racial and [[socioeconomic]] lines. The law prohibits domestic violence, gives women the right to seek prompt protection, and allows victims to seek protection, occupation, or [[tenancy]] orders from a [[magistrate]]. Penalties for violation of [[protection order]]s include fines up to {{USD}}54 (G$10,000) and 12 months' [[imprisonment]]; however, this legislation frequently is not enforced.&lt;ref name=report&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2006/78894.htm Report on Human Rights Practices 2006: Guyana]. [[United States]] [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]] (March 6, 2007). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

The government uses laws and policies against domestic violence with some measure of success; the problems lie with the failure of those responsible for implementation. Magistrates and magistrate court staff are often insensitive to the problem of [[domestic violence]] and to their roles in ensuring implementation of the law. In addition, not all [[police officer]]s fully understand provisions of the law.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

[[NGOs]] report a widespread perception that some police officers and magistrates could be [[bribed]] to make cases of domestic violence "go away." The government also does not [[prosecute]] cases in which the alleged victim or victim's family agreed to drop the case in exchange for a monetary payment [[Settlement (litigation)|out of court]]. NGOs assert the need for a specialized Family Court.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

Domestic violence is a problem in all [[Regions of Guyana|regions of the country]]. Enforcement of the domestic violence laws is especially weak in the interior, where police do not have as strong a presence and courts meet only once a quarter.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

Between January and September 2006, Help and Shelter handled 414 abuse cases, including [[child abuse|child]], spousal, nonspousal, and other domestic abuse; 297 of the cases involved spousal abuse directed against women. Help and Shelter, which received private donor and some government funding, ran a free shelter for victims of domestic violence and operated a [[Crisis_hotline|hotline]] to counsel victims.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

NGOs run [[public service announcement]]s and train police officers, teachers, nurses, agricultural workers, religious groups, and [[health clinic]]s to sensitize them to domestic violence. Domestic violence training is part of the curriculum of the Police Training College. There is a Task Force on Violence against Women whose membership includes representatives from NGOs, law enforcement, the health community, and youth. The Task Force has gathered data in preparation for drafting a national policy on domestic violence.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

In medicine, '''formication''' is the sensation that resembles that of small [[insect]]s crawling on (or under) the skin. It is one specific form of a set of sensations known as [[paresthesia]]s, which also include the more common prickling, tingling sensation known as "pins and needles". Formication is a well documented symptom, which has numerous possible causes. The word is derived from ''formica'', the Latin word for [[ant]].

Formication may sometimes be experienced as feelings of [[itchiness]], tingling, pins and needles, burning, or even pain. When formication is perceived as itchiness, it may trigger the [[scratch reflex]], and because of this, some people who experience the sensation are at risk of causing skin damage through excessive scratching.

In some instances, [[static electricity]] can attract [[particulates]] to the skin and can also cause body hair to move, giving a sensation like insects crawling over the skin.&lt;ref name=Static&gt;{{cite web|last=Potter|first=Mike|title=INVISIBLE ITCHES: Insect and Non-Insect Causes|url=http://www2.ca.uky.edu/entomology/entfacts/ent58.asp|work=ENTFACT-58|publisher=University of Kentucky|accessdate=2013-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in many cases no external trigger creates the sensation.

In rare cases, individuals become convinced that the sensation is due to the presence of real insects on or under the skin. In these cases, patients have what is known as [[delusional parasitosis]]. They believe that their skin is inhabited by, or under attack by, small insects or similar parasites, despite repeated reassurances from physicians, [[pest control]] experts, and [[entomologist]]s.&lt;ref name=Hinkle&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hinkle |first=Nancy C |title=Delusory Parasitosis |journal=American Entomologist |volume=46 |pages=17–25 |year=2000 |url=http://www.ent.uga.edu/pubs/delusory.pdf |format=PDF |issue=1 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021033308/http://www.ent.uga.edu/pubs/delusory.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Causes of formication include normal states such as onset of [[menopause]] (i.e. hormone withdrawal). Other causes are medical conditions such as [[pesticide|pesticide exposure]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=1964560|year=1990|author1=Vijverberg|first1=H.

==History==
Formication is etymologically derived from the [[Latin]] word ''formica'', meaning "[[ant]]", precisely because of this similarity in sensation to that of crawling insects. The term has been in use for several hundred years.  In the 1797 edition of the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], a description of the condition [[wikt:raphania|raphania]] includes the symptom:

{{quote|...a formication, or sensation as of ants or other small insects creeping on the parts.|&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fIJMAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA260&amp;dq=formication Encyclopædia Britannica], 1797, p. 260&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Described again in an instructional text from 1890:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A variety of itching, often encountered in the eczema of elderly people, is formication; this is described as exactly like the crawling of myriads of animals over the skin. It is probably due to the successive irritation of nerve fibrils in the skin. At times patients who suffer from it will scarcely be persuaded that it is not due to insects. Yielding to the temptation to scratch invariably makes the disease worse.&lt;ref&gt;Jamieson, William Allan (1894) [https://books.google.com/books?id=EeJnxmKxH0gC ''Diseases of the Skin: A Manual for Practitioners and Students'']. Pentland&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Packer was born in [[Jersey City, New Jersey]].  He earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in government and international relations in 1944 from [[Yale University]] and was admitted to [[Phi Beta Kappa Society|Phi Beta Kappa]].  He earned an [[Bachelor of Laws|LL.B.]] in 1949 from [[Yale Law School]] and was article editor of the ''[[Yale Law Journal]]''.

Packer was a [[law clerk]] for Judge [[Thomas Walter Swan]] from 1949 to 1950.   After working for the law firm of Cox, Langford, Stoddard &amp; Cutler, he became a law professor at [[Stanford Law School|Stanford]] in 1956.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  He married [[Nancy Packer]], author and daughter of U.S. Representative [[George Huddleston]], in 1958.  They are the parents of authors [[Ann Packer (author)|Ann Packer]] and [[George Packer]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  He was Vice Provost for Academic Planning and Programs at Stanford from 1967 to 1969.  He suffered a serious stroke in 1969 but returned to Stanford later that year.  He became the Jackson Eli Reynolds Professor of Law in 1971.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1969, Packer suffered a stroke that partially paralyzed him. Three years later, Packer committed suicide at the age of 46 in [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/magazine/article/Thicker-Than-Water-3282174.php|title=Thicker Than Water|last=Benson|first=Heidi|date=June 1, 2008|website=SFGate|access-date=2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not finish a planned biography of [[Learned Hand]].&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

His first book, ''Ex-Communist Witnesses: Four Studies in Fact Finding'' (1962), discussed the testimony of four individuals involved in legal investigations into Communism in the United States: [[Whittaker Chambers]], [[Elizabeth Bentley]], [[Louis F. Budenz|Louis Budenz]], and John Lautner.  ''The Limits of the Criminal Sanction'' was awarded the Coif Book Award in 1970 by the [[Order of the Coif]], an [[honor society]] for law school graduates.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.orderofthecoif.org/COIF-bookaward.htm|title=COIF-bookaward|website=www.orderofthecoif.org|access-date=2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article in ''[[The Nation]]'' called "A Measure of Achievement" (1964), Packer concluded that the [[Warren Commission]] did a "conscientious and at times brilliant job" compiling the Warren Report and concurred that it proved "beyond a [[reasonable doubt]]" that U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]] was [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassinated]] by [[Lee Harvey Oswald]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=A Law Professor Praises The Warren Commission Report | encyclopedia=The Kennedy Assassination: Interpreting Primary Documents | publisher=Greenhaven Press | editor=Carey Charles W.

'''Ilse Koch''' ({{IPA-de|kɔx|lang}}; [[née]] '''Margarete Ilse Köhler'''; 22 September 1906 – 1 September 1967, known as the '''Witch of Buchenwald''') was the wife of [[Karl-Otto Koch]], [[commandant]] of the [[Nazi concentration camp]]s [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]] (1937–1941) and [[Majdanek concentration camp|Majdanek]] (1941–1943). In 1947, she became one of the first prominent [[Nazi]]s tried by the [[U.S. military]].

After the trial received worldwide media attention, survivor accounts of her actions resulted in other authors describing her abuse of prisoners as sadistic, and the image of her as "the concentration camp murderess" was current in post-war [[Germany|German]] society.&lt;ref name="Przyrembel" /&gt; 

She was accused of taking souvenirs from the skin of murdered inmates with distinctive [[tattoo]]s, although those claims were rejected at both of her trials. She was known as "The Witch of Buchenwald" (''Die Hexe von Buchenwald'') by the inmates because of her cruelty and [[Wiktionary:lascivious#English|lasciviousness]] toward prisoners.

==Early life==
Koch was born in [[Dresden]], Germany, the daughter of a factory foreman. She was known as a polite and happy child in her elementary school. At the age of 15, she entered an [[accountancy]] school. Later, she went to work as a bookkeeping clerk. At the time the economy of Germany had not yet recovered from Germany's defeat in [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]]. In 1932, she became a member of the rising [[Nazi Party]]. Through some friends in the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] and [[Schutzstaffel|SS]], she met [[Karl-Otto Koch]] in 1934, marrying him two years later.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

In 1936, she began working as a guard and secretary at the [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] near [[Berlin]], which her fiancé commanded, and was married the same year. In 1937 she came to Buchenwald when her husband was made Commandant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.holocaustchronicle.org/StaticPages/117.html |title=The Holocaust Chronicle |work=1937: Quiet Before the Storm |page=117 |publisher=Holocaustchronicle.org |accessdate=7 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at Buchenwald, Koch allegedly engaged in a gruesome experiment, where it was claimed that she ordered selected tattooed prisoners to be murdered and skinned to retrieve the tattooed parts of their bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buchenwald.de/1132|title=Lampenschirme aus Menschenhaut? - Gedenkstätte Buchenwald|first=Stiftung Gedenkstätte Buchenwald und|last=Mittelbau-Dora|publisher=buchenwald.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was allegedly done to help a prison doctor, {{illm|Erich Wagner|de|Erich Wagner (Arzt)}}, in his dissertation on tattooing and criminality.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxlfeGrIRPc&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=795 "The most evil women in history"]. Discovery Channel, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, she built an indoor sports arena, which cost over 250,000 [[reichsmarks]] (approximately $62,500), most of which had been seized from the inmates. In 1941 Karl Otto Koch was transferred to [[Lublin]], where he helped establish the [[Majdanek concentration camp|Majdanek concentration and extermination camp]]. Ilse Koch remained at Buchenwald until 24 August 1943, when she and her husband were arrested on the orders of [[Josias von Waldeck-Pyrmont]], [[SS and Police Leader]] for [[Weimar]], who had supervisory authority over Buchenwald. The charges against the Kochs comprised private enrichment, [[embezzlement]], and the murder of prisoners to prevent them from giving testimony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Heinz Höhne |last=Höhne |first=Heinz |title=The Order of the Death's Head: A History of the SS |publisher=Penguin Books |year=2000 |isbn=9780141390123}} The author notes the irony that the SS prosecutor, [[Konrad Morgen]], investigated some cover-up murders of inmates in detail while being ignorant of, or willfully ignoring, the industrialized mass murder later alleged to have been going on in the camps further to the east.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ilse Koch was imprisoned until 1944 when she was acquitted for lack of evidence. Her husband was found guilty and [[capital punishment|sentenced to death]] by an [[Hauptamt SS-Gericht|SS court]] in [[Munich]], and was executed by firing squad on 5 April 1945 in the court of the camp he once commanded. She went to live with her surviving family in the town of [[Ludwigsburg]], where she was arrested by U.S. authorities on 30 June 1945.

==First trial==
[[File:DachauerProzess.JPG|thumb|Ilse Koch at the U.S. Military Tribunal in [[Dachau]], 1947]]

Koch and 30 other accused were arraigned before the American military court at Dachau (General Military Government Court for the Trial of War Criminals) in 1947. Prosecuting her was future [[United States Court of Claims]] [[United States federal judge|Judge]] [[Robert Lowe Kunzig|Robert L. Kunzig]]. She was charged with "participating in a criminal plan for aiding, abetting and participating in the murders at Buchenwald".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of the Third Reich |publisher=Macmillan |location=New York |year=1991 |page=43 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Koch announced in the courtroom that she was eight months pregnant but on 19 August 1947, she was sentenced to life imprisonment for "violation of the laws and customs of war".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Yearbook of the European Convention on Human Rights |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mzxf11yq8o8C&amp;pg=PP1 |volume=5 |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |year=1963 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Mzxf11yq8o8C&amp;pg=PA126 126–136] |isbn=978-90-247-0949-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reduction of sentence==
Gen. [[Lucius D. Clay]] was the interim military governor of the [[American Zone]] in Germany, and he reduced the judgment to four years' imprisonment on 8 June 1948, after she had served two years of her sentence, on the grounds that "there was no convincing evidence that she had selected inmates for extermination in order to secure tattooed skins, or that she possessed any articles made of human skin".&lt;ref name="Time_1950-12-25"&gt;{{cite journal |title=GERMANY: Very Special Present |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,859084,00.html#ixzz1JwxlL7xG |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=25 December 1950}} {{subscription required |date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; News of the reduced sentence did not become public until 16 September 1948, and Clay stood firm despite the ensuing uproar. [[Jean Edward Smith]] reported in his biography ''Lucius D. Clay: An American Life'' that the general maintained that the leather lamp shades were really made out of [[Goatskin (material)|goat skin]]. The book quotes a statement made by Clay years later:

{{quote|There was absolutely no evidence in the trial transcript, other than she was a rather loathsome creature, that would support the death sentence. I suppose I received more abuse for that than for anything else I did in Germany. Some reporter had called her the "Bitch of Buchenwald", had written that she had lamp shades made of human skin in her house. And that was introduced in court, where it was absolutely proven that the lampshades were made out of goatskin. In addition to that, her crimes were primarily against the German people; they were not war crimes against American or Allied prisoners ... Later she was tried by a German court for her crimes and sentenced to life imprisonment. But they had clear jurisdiction. We did not.}}

==Second trial==
Under the pressure of public opinion Koch was re-arrested in 1949 and tried before a [[West German]] court. The hearing opened on 27 November 1950 before the District Court at Augsburg and lasted seven weeks, during which 250 witnesses were heard, including 50 for the defense. Koch collapsed and had to be carried from the court in late December 1950,&lt;ref name="Time_1950-12-25" /&gt; and again on 11 January 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Woman decides against suicide Life demanded for Ilse Koch |work=[[The Spokesman-Review]] |date=12 January 1951 |page=2 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3DBWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=xuUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5602%2C3401594 |accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least four witnesses for the prosecution testified that they had seen Koch choose tattooed prisoners, who were then killed, or had seen or been involved in the process of making [[Lampshades made from human skin|human-skin lampshades]] from tattooed skin.&lt;ref name="Time_1950-12-25" /&gt; However, this charge was dropped by the prosecution when they could not prove lampshades or any other items were actually made from human skin.&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite news |title=Ilse Koch is given life term |work=[[Gettysburg Times]] |date=15 January 1951 |page=2 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0IElAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3fQFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4254%2C5369899 |accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 January 1951, the Court pronounced its verdict, in a 111-page-long decision, for which Koch was not present in court.&lt;ref name="google2"/&gt; It was concluded that the previous trials in 1944 and 1947 were not a bar to proceedings under the principle of ''[[ne bis in idem]]'', as at the 1944 trial Koch had only been charged with receiving, while in 1947 she had been accused of crimes against foreigners after 1 September 1939, and not with crimes against humanity of which Germans and Austrians had been defendants both before and after that date. She was convicted of charges of incitement to murder, incitement to attempted murder and incitement to the crime of committing grievous bodily harm, and on 15 January 1951 was sentenced to life imprisonment and permanent forfeiture of civil rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Arthur Lee |title=Die Hexe von Buchenwald: der Fall Ilse Koch |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Slkfbe9ZEHEC&amp;pg=PP1 |publisher=Böhlau Verlag |year=1994 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Slkfbe9ZEHEC&amp;pg=PA146 146] |language=German |isbn=978-3-412-10693-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Koch appealed to have the judgment quashed, but the appeal was dismissed on 22 April 1952 by the [[Federal Court of Justice of Germany|Federal Court of Justice]]. She later made several petitions for a pardon, all of which were rejected by the Bavarian Ministry of Justice. Koch protested her life sentence, to no avail, to the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights|International Human Rights Commission]].&lt;ref name="trial"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scrapbookpages.com/DachauScrapbook/DachauTrials/IlseKoch.html|title=Ilse Koch on trial at Dachau for making human lamp shades at Buchenwald|website=www.scrapbookpages.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
[[Karl-Otto Koch|Karl]] and Ilse Koch had two sons, one of whom committed suicide after the war "because he couldn't live with the shame of the crimes of his parents."&lt;ref name="trial"/&gt; Another son, Uwe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.funtrivia.com/en/subtopics/children-of-the-nazis-282184.html |title=Fun Trivia: N : Nazi Germany: Children of the Nazis |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=funtrivia.com |deadurl=no |accessdate=23 January 2016}}{{Unreliable source? |reason=this is a quiz site; no way to search for any of the info presented in this section|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; conceived in her prison cell at Dachau with a fellow German prisoner,&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite news |last=Binder |first=David |date=May 7, 1971 |title=Ilse Koch's Posthumous Rehabilitation Sought by Son |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/05/07/archives/ilse-kochs-posthumous-rehabilitation-sought-by-son.html?_r=0 |work=The New York Times |location=New York |access-date=2018-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was born in the Aichach prison near Dachau where Koch was sent to serve her life sentence and was immediately taken from her.

}}The '''''International Honor Quilt'' ('''also known as the '''''International Quilting Bee'')''' is a collective [[Feminism|feminist]] [[Art|art project]] initiated in 1980 by [[Judy Chicago]] as a companion piece to ''[[The Dinner Party]]''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/2016/01/15/feminist-quilt-displayed-u-l/78848054/|title=Feminist quilt to be displayed at U of L|website=The Courier-Journal|access-date=2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtontimes.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/feb/27/international-honor-quilt-given-to-u-of-l/|title=‘International Honor Quilt’ given to U of L|last=|first=|website=The Washingtion Times|access-date=2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The piece is a collection of 539 two-foot-long&amp;nbsp;quilted triangles that honor women from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xG_kD43EDP0C|title=The Dinner Party: Judy Chicago and the Power of Popular Feminism, 1970–2007|last=Gerhard|first=Jane F.|date=2013-06-01|publisher=University of Georgia Press|isbn=9780820336756|page=196|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the Flower, Chicago's not-for-profit organization,  gifted the collection to [[University of Louisville]] Hite Art Institute in 2013 to be available for research and to exhibit.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Background ==

=== Creation ===
In Judy Chicago's autobiography, ''Beyond the Flower'', she discusses initiating the International Quilting Bee, stating that "people would be invited to submit their triangular quilts. . .honoring women of their own determination. By doing this, I intended to provide an opportunity for community participation and also to counter another criticism that had emerged, this time about my choices of women."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beyond the Flower: The Autobiography of a Feminist Artist|last=Chicago|first=Judy|publisher=Penguin Group|year=1996|isbn=0-670-85295-3|location=New York|pages=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Community collaboration ===
Individual Quilt panels were often created by groups of women after viewing or hearing about Chicago's ''Dinner Party'' . For example, a group from the Chrysallis Center at [[Saginaw Valley State University]], Michigan, visited the Dinner Party exhibition in Chicago in 1981. Returning to Saginaw via bus that evening, they decided they needed to create a quilt panel and submit it to the project.  Under the leadership of Rosalie (Riegle) Troester,  an English instructor at the University, and Trish Nowicke, Campus Minister, a group of fourteen students created a multicolored butterfly wing ([http://digital.library.louisville.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/ihq/id/1178/rec/1 IQB-352]) representing the growth stage it symbolizes as well as the student career counseling and  support center of which they were members. They completed the project and forwarded their creation to Through the Flower for display in the next Dinner Party venue, [[Montreal]].&lt;ref name="washingtontimes.com"/&gt;

== Description ==
The ''International Honor Quilt'' is a collection of 539 panels of triangular quilts honoring women, women's organizations, and women's issues.&lt;ref&gt;"Extending the Spirit of The Dinner Party: The International Honor Quilt," University of Louisville, Hite Art Institute, 2015 (brochure)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Iraqi Australians''' are Australian citizens who identify themselves to be [[Iraqi people|Iraqi]] descent.
Since the 1991 [[Gulf War]], thousands of Iraqis have found refuge in Australia. The total of population is estimated to be as high as 80,000.&lt;ref name="smh.com.au"&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Fear-checks-turnout-for-Iraq-poll/2005/01/21/1106110948104.html http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Fear-checks-turnout-for-Iraq-poll/2005/01/21/1106110948104.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Australia's Iraqi-born population includes [[Iraqi Arabs|Arabs]], [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Chaldean Christians|Chaldeans]], [[Kurdish people|Kurds]], [[Armenians in Iraq|Armenians]], [[Mandeans]], [[Iraqi Turkmen|Turkmens]] and [[Iraqi Jews|Jews]].

The first year in which the Australian Census of Population and Housing recorded the Iraq-born separately was 1976, when the population was 2,273. By 1986, the population had risen to 4,516. By the end of the Gulf War in 1991, it numbered 5,186, mainly in [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].

Many recent arrivals have entered Australia under the Humanitarian programme. The [[Gulf War]] and the quelling of uprisings of the Shi'a and the Kurds in Iraq resulted in a large increase in the number of Iraqis coming to Australia after 1991. There were 24,760 Iraq-born people in Australia at the 2001 Census, making up 0.6 per cent of the overseas-born population.

==History==

Iraqi-born Victorians were first identified in the Victorian census in 1976, when 189 people were recorded. Within five years the community had almost tripled to 408, and by 1991 had increased to 603. Most Iraqis had escaped hardships caused by the eight-year [[Iran–Iraq War]], which ended in 1988.&lt;ref name=ImmigrationfromIraq&gt;{{cite web|url=http://immigration.museum.vic.gov.au/Origins/history.aspx?id=29 |title=Immigration from Iraq |accessdate=14 August 2007 |publisher=immigration.museum.vic.gov.au |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070831100007/http://immigration.museum.vic.gov.au/origins/history.aspx?id=29 |archivedate=31 August 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The outbreak of the Gulf War in 1991 led a large number of people to flee Iraq into the neighbouring countries. Some refugees lived in processing camps for up to five years before being accepted into Australia under the Special Humanitarian Program. During this period the visas of around 400 Iraqis living in Australia were extended until the end of the Gulf War.

Iraqi immigration to Australia peaked between 1992 and 1995, with the Iraq-born population in Victoria increasing to 3,492 by 1996.&lt;ref name=ImmigrationfromIraq /&gt; By 2001 this community had increased a further 74% to 6,091 people.&lt;ref name=ImmigrationfromIraq /&gt; Most recent Iraqi immigrants have arrived under the Family and Skilled Migration categories. Some Iraqis have sought refugee status after arrival in Australia, and have been detained pending processing.

Today the Iraq-born community in Australia is culturally diverse, with settlers from many ethnic and cultural backgrounds including [[Arabs]], [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Kurds]], [[Iraqi Turkmens|Turkomans]]. Although Islam is the dominant religion in Iraq, only 29% of the Iraq-born immigrants living in Victoria are Muslim; 68% are Christian.

Nearly half of the Iraqi community speaks Arabic at home; only 3% speaks English, reflecting the number of recent immigrants in the community. Over half of Iraq-born Victorians are aged under 35, and only 12% are aged over fifty. Of those in the workforce, both men and women are most commonly employed as labourers and related workers within the manufacturing industry, while nearly a quarter are employed in professional positions. The community is supported by organisations such as the Australian Iraqi Forum several religious or cultural associations.

==Early life==
Chelameswar was born in Peddamuttevi village of [[Movva mandal]], [[Krishna district]], [[Andhra Pradesh]], the son of Jasti Lakshminarayana, a lawyer who practised at the district court, and his wife Annapoornamma. After completing his schooling in [[Machilipatnam]], Chelameswar enrolled at [[Loyola College, Chennai]] and obtained a [[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor's degree in Science]] with [[Physics]] as his major subject. He then studied Law and obtained an [[LLB]] from [[Andhra University|Andhra University, Visakhapatnam]] in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.supremecourtofindia.nic.in/judges/sjud/chelameswar.htm|title=Supreme Court of India - CJI &amp; Sitting Judges|website=www.supremecourtofindia.nic.in|access-date=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Chelameswar served as an Additional Judge at the then [[High Court of Andhra Pradesh]]. Later, he became the Chief Justice of
Guwahati High Court in 2007. He was later transferred as the Chief Justice of the [[Kerala High Court]] and was elevated as a Judge, [[Supreme Court of India]] in October 2011.&lt;ref name ="SCI Chelameswar"&gt;{{cite web |title=Hon'ble Mr. Justice Jasti Chelameswar|url=http://supremecourtofindia.nic.in/judges/sjud/chelameswar.htm|accessdate=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an Op-Ed in [[The Economic Times]]: {{Quote|Chelameswar, once a government pleader, was appointed additional judge in the Andhra Pradesh High Court in 1997. He has been chief justice of both the Guwahati and Kerala high courts where he is perceived as having done exemplary work on the green benches there. He was made a Supreme Court judge in 2011 after an unexplained delay. This denied him the chance to be chief justice of India. He has delivered several landmark judgements while in the top court.&lt;ref name="ET 17 October 2015"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/meet-jasti-chelameswar-only-judge-who-ruled-in-favour-of-governments-njac/articleshow/49424524.cms |title=Meet Jasti Chelameswar, only judge who ruled in favour of government's NJAC|work=The Economic Times|date=17 October 2015|accessdate=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Notable Judgements==
===Freedom of Speech===
{{Main|Shreya Singhal v. Union of India}}
Chelameswar and [[Rohinton Fali Nariman]] formed the two judge [[Bench (law)|bench]] of the Supreme Court of India which struck down a controversial law which gave Indian police the power to arrest anyone accused of posting emails or other electronic messages which "causes annoyance or inconvenience". The judges held Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, which made such offenses punishable up to three years imprisonment, to be unconstitutional.&lt;ref name="BBC 24 March 2015"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-32029369 |title=Section 66A: India court strikes down 'Facebook' arrest law |work=BBC|date=24 March 2015|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian 24 March 2015"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/24/india-supreme-court-strikes-down-internet-censorship-law |title=India supreme court strikes down internet censorship law |work=The Guardian|date=24 March 2015|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoot 25 March 2015"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehoot.org/media-watch/law-and-policy/a-blow-for-free-speech-8195 |title=A blow for free speech |work=The Hoot|date=25 March 2015|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HT 25 March 2015"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/supreme-court-upholds-free-speech-on-internet-scraps-unconstitutional-section-66a-of-it-act/story-6eWmUdBFtnPBccmsV9LPtL.html |title=Supreme Court upholds free speech on internet, scraps 'unconstitutional' Section 66A of IT Act |work=Hindustan Times|date=25 March 2015|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hindu 24 March 2015"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/SC-strikes-down-‘draconian’-Section-66A/article10740659.ece |title=SC strikes down ‘draconian’ Section 66A |work=The Hindu|date=24 March 2015|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Chelameswar and Nariman, several terms in the law they were striking down were "open-ended, undefined and vague" which made them nebulous in nature. According to the judges: "What may be offensive to one may not be offensive to another. What may cause annoyance or inconvenience to one may not cause annoyance or inconvenience to another.”&lt;ref name="Hindu 24 March 2015"/&gt;

In their judgement the judges clarified that a distinction needs to be made between discussion, advocacy, and incitement. Any discussion, or advocacy of even an unpopular cause cannot be restricted, and it is only when such discussion or advocacy reaches the level of incitement whereby it causes public disorder or affects the security of the state can it be curbed.&lt;ref name="Hoot 25 March 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HT 25 March 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hindu 24 March 2015"/&gt;

The judgement has been welcomed for defending the Indian Constitution's ideals of tolerance and the Constitutional provisions of free speech.&lt;ref name="Hindu 26 March 2015"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/the-judgment-that-silenced-section-66a/article7032656.ece |title=The judgment that silenced Section 66A |work=The Hindu|date=26 March 2015|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NDTV 24 March 2015"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ndtv.com/opinion/our-politicians-loved-section-66-a-749141 |title=

===Aadhaar===
A three judge [[Bench (law)|bench]] of the Indian Supreme Court, comprising Chelameswar, [[Sharad Arvind Bobde]], and [[Chokkalingam Nagappan]], ratified an earlier order of the Supreme Court and clarified that no Indian citizen without an [[Aadhaar]] card can be deprived of basic services and government subsidies.&lt;ref name="Hindu 16 March 2015"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/aadhaar-not-mandatory-sc-reiterates/article6999924.ece |title=Don't insist on Aadhar, warns SC |work=The Hindu|date=16 March 2015|accessdate=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Judicial Appointments Commission(NJAC) verdict===
In his [[dissenting opinion]] in the [[National Judicial Appointments Commission|NJAC]] verdict(2015), Chelameswar had criticised the [[Three Judges Cases|collegium system]] of appointing judges, which he said has become “a euphemism for nepotism” where “mediocrity or even less” is promoted and a “constitutional disorder” does not look distant.&lt;ref name="ET 17 October 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The judge who dissented: ‘No accountability, mediocrity or even less promoted, reform overdue’|url = http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/the-judge-who-dissented-no-accountability-mediocrity-or-even-less-promoted-reform-overdue/|website = The Indian Express|date = 2015-10-17|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph Remiro''' (born 1947) is one of the founding members of the [[Symbionese Liberation Army]]. He used the pseudonym "Bo" while he was a member of the group. 

Remiro remains in [[San Quentin State Prison]] where he is serving a life sentence.&lt;ref name="sfgate.com" /&gt; He is the only member of the [[Symbionese Liberation Army]] still incarcerted, having been denied parole at least three times.

==Early life==

Remiro was born and raised in [[San Francisco]] in a lower-middle-class family,&lt;ref name="nytfranks"&gt;Franks, Lucinda, [http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1975/06/15/118452408.html?pageNumber=63 "This Soldier Still At War"], [[The New York Times]], June 15, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; where he attended [[Roman Catholic]] schools.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/image/74448701/?terms=joe%2Bremiro "The Revolt of SLA's Joe Remiro"], (book review of "This Soldier Still at War"), Daily Independent Journal, San Rafael, Calif. August 2, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

He attended [[City College of San Francisco|San Francisco City College]], dropping out in 1965 to join the [[US Army]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==Military service and Vietnam==
Remiro served as a [[Long-range reconnaissance patrol|LRRP]] and served two tours in Vietnam as a member of the [[101st Airborne Division]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Symbionese_Liberation_Army.html?id=d4XQAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y "The Symbionese Liberation Army: A Study"], United States Congress House Committee on Internal Security, US Govt Printing Office, p 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

He had training as an auto mechanic.&lt;ref name="people.com"/&gt; He participated in search and destroy missions in Vietnam and became addicted to drugs while there.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan, John, [https://www.amazon.com/This-Soldier-Still-at-War/dp/0151900604 "This Soldier Still at War"], Harcourt Bruce Javanovich, 1975, {{ISBN|0-15-190060-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return and VVAW==
When Remiro returned from service, he joined [[Vietnam Veterans Against the War]] and then the more radical [[Venceremos (political organization)|Venceremos]]. He then became involved with the [[Black Cultural Association]], an education program for convicts at the [[California Medical Facility|Vacaville psychiatric prison]] in California, and Peking House, a Maoist collective where he became best friends with fellow future SLA member [[Russ Little (SLA)|Russ Little]]. He also became friendly with [[Willie Wolfe]] at this time and [[Angela Atwood]].&lt;ref name="people.com"&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;page=1&amp;rh=n%3A283155%2Cp_27%3AVin%20McLellan McLellan, Vin], [http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20063998,00.html "The Man and the Mystery behind the Sla Terror"], People magazine, April 29, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; This was to be the beginnings of the [[Symbionese Liberation Army]].

==Symbionese Liberation Army==
Remiro joined the SLA and was considered a useful member due to his knowledge of weaponry from his time in Vietnam. He trained other members in target practice, as well as the use, maintenance and dismantling of weaponry.&lt;ref name="nytfranks"/&gt;

==Arrest==

On January 10, 1974, Remiro and Russell Little were apprehended by police, as they were driving suspiciously in a quiet neighborhood in [[Concord, California]] at 1.30am in a battered van. Little showed the officer a fake license and claimed he was looking for the "Devoto" home. However, Little had been staying there for several weeks with [[Nancy Ling Perry]], who had rented the house under the assumed name. When the officer then asked the passenger to identify himself, Remiro grabbed a holstered pistol. The officer took cover behind his car. When the officer peered out from cover, Remiro fired two rounds at the policeman, who fired two shots back at him. Remiro took cover and then emerged again, firing three more rounds at the officer, who again fired twice at Remiro. Although neither Remiro or the officer were hit, Little was wounded during the shootout. Remiro fled the scene as police arrested Little.

Four hours later, Remiro surrendered only a block from the SLA hideout. Officers found the [[Walther]] automatic pistol that had been used in the murder of Marcus Foster. Since Little had mentioned the name Devoto, it was presumed by the SLA that it was only a matter of time before police would discover their hideout. That evening the house was doused with gasoline and sprinkled with gunpowder. Nancy Perry was seen driving rapidly away.&lt;ref name="people.com"/&gt;

==Detention==
As soon as Remiro and Little were booked into Concord City Jail, an extra shift of guards was called in to surround the building. No one got in or out without being thoroughly checked. The two were transferred almost immediately to Contra Costa County Jail, where armed guards on the roof were joined by extra street patrols. New and more serious charges were filed against the pair, bringing their bail to almost 750,000 dollars each. Not wanting to allow any chance for escape or for an assisted breakout, it was decided that Remiro and Little would be transferred to California's most secure penitentiary, [[San Quentin State Prison|San Quentin prison]]. This move was unprecedented, as suspects are presumed innocent until proven guilty, and only the guilty are housed in penitentiaries.&lt;ref&gt;Burrough, Bryan, [https://www.amazon.com/Days-Rage-Underground-Forgotten-Revolutionary/dp/1594204292 "Days of Rage: America's Radical Underground, the FBI and the Forgotten Age of Revolutionary Violence"], Penguin, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

On Feb 17, 1974, Little and Remiro attempted to release a statement to the public with some of their grievances. This was seized by prison authorities but found its way to the media in March. Some grievances included that they were being held in isolation, "the hole" on Death Row, of being starved, and other claims of harassment, intimidation and violence. They claimed that this was under direction of the [[FBI]].&lt;ref&gt;http://freedomarchives.org/Documents/Finder/DOC514_scans/514.SLA.RussLittle.JoeRomero.Statement.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1974/03/07/93258333.pdf "Aid for Miss Hearst Hinted by Prisoners"], [[The New York Times]], March 7, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

In late February 1974, Little's father, O. Jack Little, made a statement to the media and to other SLA members. He offered to take Patty Hearst's place as a kidnap victim. Part of his statement read:
:If Russ Little and Joe Remiro are innocent in the Foster murder and are in fact victims of a police state, then how in heaven's name can the kidnaping and threatened execution of Patricia Hearst have any significance to Russ and Joe but to sustain their indictment? ... Seeing as Russ is the only son I have, at least you could have the satisfaction of knowing that you had been instrumental in the destruction of not only Russell but of his whole family. I beg you to think about it, and please agree to release that child unharmed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/image/61897838/ "Seven Sought in Hearst Kidnaping"], The Progress, (Clearfield, Pennsylvania), Feb 11, 1974, p7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sentencing==

In February 1975, the jury sent a note to the judge that it had been unable to reach a verdict in the case.&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com"&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1976/02/19/75213968.pdf "Jury Unable to Reach Verdict in SLA Case"], [[The New York Times]], Feb 19, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; A new jury was selected.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1975/04/15/76348230.pdf "Scrutiny of Trial Audience is Opposed by ACLU"] [[The New York Times]] April 15, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 27, 1975, Little and Remiro were sentenced to life imprisonment for murder and the attempted murder of Foster's assistant, Robert Blackburn. Although there were no positive eyewitness identifications of either man at the murder scene, considerable circumstantial evidence, including possession of the murder weapon, was relied upon. The pair was also sentenced for the shooting incident that occurred on their apprehension, as well as an assault that occurred on a prison officer in January 1974.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1975/06/28/78253713.pdf "2 in Symbionese Army Get Life In Oakland School Head's Death"] [[The New York Times]], June 28, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Remiro has one son, Joshua.&lt;ref name="sfgate.com"&gt;Bulwa, Dan, [http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/For-paralyzed-meth-addict-worst-is-over-3207580.php For paralyzed meth addict worst is over], San Francisco Gate, Dec 4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==

On February 18, 1976 [[Patty Hearst]] at her [[armed robbery]] trial testified that Little and Remiro were waiting in the car while Dr Foster was killed by other members, although Bill Harris claimed that they had not even been there.&lt;ref&gt;Turner Wallace, [http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1976/04/04/139798042.html?pageNumber=48 "4 Say wrong SLA members were convicted in killing"], [[The New York Times]], April 4, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; Little and Remiro also released a statement through their attorney that Hearst was "lying".&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com"/&gt;

Little has stated: "Who actually pulled the trigger that killed Foster was [[Mizmoon]]. [[Nancy Ling Perry|Nancy [Ling Perry]]] was supposed to shoot Blackburn, she kind of botched that and DeFreeze ended up shooting him with a shotgun."&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/guerrilla/filmmore/pt.html |title=American Experience &amp;#124; Guerrilla: The Taking of Patty Hearst &amp;#124; Transcript |publisher=PBS |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, [[Bill Harris (SLA)|Bill Harris]] stated that he maintained the innocence of [[Russ Little (SLA)|Russ Little]] and Remiro.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/image/68297061/ "Hearst kidnapping called inept caper"], ''Santa Cruz Sentinel'', October 17, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 5, 1981, Little's conviction was overturned by the California Court of Appeal, and he was later acquitted in a retrial in Monterey County.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9400EEDB1238F936A35755C0A967948260 ''Around the Nation: Russell Little is Acquitted of Slaying on Coast in 1973'']. ''[[The New York Times]].'' June 5, 1981. Retrieved April 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the reasons given in the unanimous decision by the three judges was that Superior Court judge Elvin Sheehy issued a "[[dynamite charge]]" to a deadlocked jury. This charge asks holdout jurors to reevaluate their decision and urges them to reach a conclusion. In 1977, the [[California Supreme Court]] ruled that this dynamite charge prejudiced the right to a fair jury trial. One of the Justices argued that Remiro's conviction should be overturned along with Little's.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1979/02/28/111009141.pdf "Murder Conviction of SLA 'Soldier' Overturned"] [[The New York Times]], Feb 28, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nancy Ling Perry]]'s former boss and friend, Rudy Henderson, also testified at the trial that Ling Perry had confessed to him prior to her death that she, [[Donald DeFreeze]], [[Willie Wolfe]] and two other members who were killed in the Los Angeles shootout had shot Foster.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1975/06/10/archives/two-found-guilty-in-coast-murder-they-could-get-life-terms-jury.html  "Two Found Guilty in Coast Murder"] [[The New York Times]] June 10, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

Remiro remains in [[San Quentin State Prison]] today where he is serving a life sentence.&lt;ref name="sfgate.com"/&gt; He is the only member of the SLA still in prison, having been denied parole at least three times.

{{Contains Khmer text}}
'''Kula''' ({{lang-th|กุลา}}; {{lang-km|កូឡា}}; also spelt '''Gula''' and '''Kola''') are [[Tai peoples]] who immigrated from [[Yunnan]], China and the [[Mon State|Mon]] and [[Shan State]]s in [[Myanmar]] to [[Isan]], Thailand during the last few decades of the 19th century. The Kula once lived mainly in [[Pailin Province]] as refugees during [[French Protectorate of Cambodia]], where many worked as gem traders. The immigration of the Kula led to economic developments and commercialization in the region. The Kula, still a minority ethnic group, are among the wealthiest ethnic groups in modern [[Cambodia]].{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

==Terminology==
In [[Burmese language|Burmese]], ''Kula'' ({{my|ကုလား}}, often transliterated ''Kala''), typically used to refer to [[Burmese Indians|Indians]], was historically used to describe both Indians and Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thatphanom.com/pe_008.php&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kula'' is also the [[Thai language|Thai]] word for ''star-shaped kite''.

The history of ''Toongsoo'' ({{my|တောင်သူ}} ''Taungthu'' in Burmese), another name for the Kula people, is unknown. Although Thai documents from the 1870s and '80s use the two words interchangeably, it is not clear if they refer to the same ethnic group. Wilson, for example, writes that ''Toongsoo'' (or ''Tongsú'') was used in the 19th century as a designation for (a) The [[Karen people|Karen]] tribe in general, (b) A [[Thai people|Thai]] trader tribe closely related to Shans known for dealing in elephant and horses and (c) The [[Shan people|Shan]] pronunciation of the Burmese word ''taungthu'' "hill man", referring to the [[Pa'O people|Pa'O]], an ethnic group within the [[Karen people]].

Reporting on the miners in the [[Chanthaburi]] and [[Cambodia]] peninsulas, Smyth said: "The Siamese often style the gem mining Shán Tongsu, but there are very few real Tongsu among them. Europeans usually called them Burmese, but beyond the fact that they come from the Burmese Shán states the term is not applicable to more than an extremely small percentage, and the application of the name to his face would be not considered flattering by the average Shán."

Kula also refers to miners in the Chanthaburi and Pailin, Cambodia regions who are believed to be of Burmese descent. At the end of the 19th century, it was discovered that the [[Mon people|Mon]] had also immigrated to the area, further muddying the definition. Cambodians sometimes refer to themselves as "the jungle people," as the jungle in the region originally stretched from [[Dawei]] to [[Mawlamyine]].

The Kula style of dress is similar to that of people in Pailin, including the traditional umbrella. Kula used to be referred to as "Burmese Cambodian" or "Khmer Shan" but are no longer called either of those.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huso.buu.ac.th/sociology/boondoem/kula/introduction.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
The Kula language is an amalgamation of words from [[Shan people|Shan]] and [[Dai people|Dai]], both of which were native Shan peoples. Kula has adapted to include words from other peoples in [[Northern Thailand]] and [[Lan Na]] like the [[Northern Thai language]], especially those languages spoken in the border communities between Burma and Thailand.

Other Kula who live between Pailin and [[Stung Treng]] speak [[Shan language]] rather than the Kula mixed tongue. Among them, the [[Lao language]] has become the language of business, especially to those living on the border with Laos. However, after the [[Khmer Rouge]], the Kula language has been almost lost, with the language becoming highly Thai-influenced.

==History==

===Journey in Thailand===
Kula merchants traded in Isan and along the banks of the [[Mekong]]. Their presence in Isan is recorded as early as the reign of King [[Rama IV]]. The first written record of Kula in the region comes from a dispute between a Kula merchant over the purchase of 577 cattle from the governors of [[Roi Et]], Sowannapoom and [[Khon Kaen]], who refused to hand over the cattle. The Kula were protected at that time by Britain, therefore [[Bangkok]] acted as mediator and returned the 2763.5 [[Thai baht|baht]] owed.

Kula merchants travelled in caravans, some of which consisted of 100 or more people who rode in ox carts and on horses and [[Asian elephant|elephant]]s. The merchants would buy and sell many types of items including elephants, [[ivory]], [[Horn (anatomy)|horns]], [[tusk]]s and [[antler]]s, [[silk]], [[water buffalo]], [[firearm]]s, and other assorted items. Smaller caravans would consist of only 5 to 50 members and would be heavily armed with knives and swords but also sacred magic charms for protection. The Kula distinguished themselves by being nomadic and staying in temples, or in the jungle, prairies and forests. [[Tung Kula Rong Hai]], or "The Plain of the Crying Kula" is so named in honor of the nomadic Kula, and is a vast grassy plain, with areas os swamp as well. 

Sparsely populated during the early 19th century, many caravans would become lost, never to find their way out. The communities within the plain erected large wooden poles and planted trees as route markers. There were five main routes through the plain: from Dong Paya Fai, [[Nakhon Ratchasima]] to Pak Priew, [[Saraburi]]; from Dong Paya Klang, Nakorn Ratchasima to Sanam Chang, [[Lopburi]]; from Thanko pass in [[Nakhon Ratchasima]] into Kabinburi, [[Prachinburi]] through the Panatnikom district in [[Saraburi]] to [[Phanom Sarakham District]], [[Chachoengsao]] to Nakhon Nayok in [[Eastern Thailand]]; from [[Mottama]], [[Mawlamyine]], Myanmar to [[Phetchabun Province]] to the Raharng district in [[Tak Province]]; and from the Jorn Pass in [[Surin Province]] to [[Sisophon]], Cambodia.

As travelling merchants, the Kula played a major role in providing communities in Isan with essential goods, skills and information. They aided the spread of skills such as [[ironwork]] and [[goldsmith]]ing in rural communities and spread information from town to town. As the regional economy advanced and began to prosper, the Kula faced competition from Chinese and Indian merchants as well as individual Thai. Paved roads and railways were built, linking Bangkok and [[Nakhon Ratchasima]], making goods more easily available to remote regions also contributed to the decline of Kula trading. When the [[Bowring Treaty]] ended, it finalized the demise of Kula merchant-caravans in Thailand. Small caravans of Kula still continued to travel to Thailand into 20th century and many Kula descendants living in [[Northern Thailand]] still practice their nomadic tradition of trading throughout Isan, though they sell pottery and artificial flowers now.

Kula would sometimes settle in a community once they married, while others returned to Cambodia once the trade era was over. Many Kula traditions and customs have disappeared over the generations through assimilation with local [[Thai people|Thai]] and [[Lao people|Lao]] communities.

===Journey in Cambodia===
[[File:Gula horseman Pailin.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Gula ([[Shan people|Shan]]) horseman in Pailin, Cambodia, an area famous for its sapphires. ''From Five Years in Siam by H''. Warington Smyth, 1898.]] During the 19th century, many Kula immigrated to [[Pailin]], Cambodia. According to R. Blandat, a group of Shan from [[Chanthaburi Province|Chanthaburi]] found a precious stone which they mined. They told the Kula, who, as traders, made money from the venture. Rumours of the gem attracted Chinese, Laos and Vietnamese to the area. The wealthier Kula in [[Bangkok]] and the Shan royalty also immigrated to Cambodia, due to economic reasons.

===Pailin===
Because of the large Kula population being centred in a small area, the residents sought to set up their own state. Another wave of migrants arrived from Burma in the late 19th century and early 20th century. On the Cambodian side of the Thai-Cambodia border Lung Musu discovered, in 1890, sapphire field in Pailin. Lung returned to [[Yangon]], Burma where he showed the sapphire to the local Shan community. The local merchants organized an expedition first to survey the land then to recruit Shan families from Laikha, Mok Mai and Meng Nai to settle the area. They constructed a Buddhist temple and a monastic order to take control of the mine. More Shan continued to flock to the area and built Wat Phnom Yat.

The Kula who lived in Pailin worked in the mines and also in the new business of heating. During French Colonial rule, a French gem merchant conducted experiments with the Pailin stones, which showed their efficacy in heat retention. The local French maintained a good relationship with the Kula, and as such many Kula traveled to France to study, returning to Cambodia afterward.

During that time, Pailin's economy grew and the livelihood of the Kula people grew with it. In the 1960s, Pailin became a tourist destination, jolting the Kula people into modern day, forcing their culture to change. For example, Kula traditionally kept their hair long and braided, and the men wore sarongs but with increased knowledge of the outside world, many Kula cut their hair cut and started wearing trousers.

===Khmer Rouge===
The [[Khmer Rouge]] rule struck the Kula people hard. Pailin became a Khmer Rouge stronghold for 30 years, while the Kula people were forced to become soldiers on the border of Lao. Some fled to Thailand while the rest were put to hard labor in the mines. This era is known is the time when the Kula culture was lost.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ben Kiernan]], ''The Pol Pot Regime: Race, Power and Genocide in Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge, 1975-1979''. Page 300&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
Many Kula traditions have roots in [[Burma]] and the [[Shan people|Shan]] culture.

===Clothing and cultural dress===
The majority of traveling merchants were male and dressed differently from the locals. Most of their attire was described as similar to the clothing of Burma, [[Mon people|Mon]], [[Dai people|Dai]] or [[Shan people|Shan]] while some dressed like [[Karieng]]. Kula pants are mostly made from cotton and dyed in dark colors. Pants were wide legged and ankle or knee-length, much like [[Culture of China|Chinese]] shorts, and were fastened with drawstrings. Men would also wear [[sarongs]], checkered and in dark colors. 

''Sue Taek Bung'' shirts are collared shirts, made from a single piece of cloth buttoned in the front. Most shirts were black, dark blue and white in color. The [[longyi]] or sarong, is an often sewn in a cylindrical shape, worn from the waist to the feet. It is secured with a knot. It is made from cotton or, occasionally, silk. Men almost always wear a white [[eingyi]] shirt with a Mandarin collar, sometimes with a [[taikpon]] jacket. Taikpon are usually white, grey, black or terracotta. Men also wear a [[gaung baung]] turban and velvet slippers. The Kula hairstyle includes long hair tied on top of the head under the turban.

Women wear a calf-length longyi in solid colors, flower prints or patterns. They are often red-based with stripes or small checks, similar to [[Mon people|Mon]] styles. Royal women wore a long dress called a thin-dai, which was decorated with many threads. Blouses were highly ornamented with silver and were colorful. Women tie a shawl over their shoulders and wear hair bands with flowers in them. Like the men, women carry umbrellas made from bamboo and wear slippers called [[hnyat-phanat]] made of velvet or leather. Women pierced their ears and wore kajorn, or earrings, made from silver. Kajorn were worn in pairs, while regular earrings were worn only on the left earlobe. All of these clothes were exchanged for bright colored clothing during celebrations. The clothing is very similar to what is worn by the Shan in Burma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.travelblog.org/Asia/Burma/blog-35587.html |title=Traditional Costume in Myanmar |year=2009 |publisher=Travel blog |accessdate=2009-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foods===
[[File:Mee Kola.jpg|thumb|300px|''Mee Kola'', a traditional kola dish which stilled involved in Cambodian cooking and themselves.]]
In Pailin, there are a few different kinds of foods. Kula food is distinct from [[Burmese cuisine]]. The most popular Burmese style dish is '''Mee Kola''' (មីកុឡា) which is a vegetarian noodle dish made from thin [[Rice vermicelli|rice stick]] noodles, steamed and cooked with soy sauce and garlic, sometimes mixed with meat and lobster. Other dishes include [[tom yum]] from [[Thai cuisine]] and Mon banana pudding from Myanmar. These have all spread to other parts of [[Thailand]] and [[Cambodia]], but normally in versions which are flavored more sweetly than the Pailin version, especially in [[Phnom Penh]].

Moreover, Kula merchants ate plain rice and would always carry kitchenware and utensils made from brass along with them on their travels. They mostly made and prepared their own meals and would eat among themselves because they had strict rules regarding proper food. Kula do not eat meat from cows, ox or water buffalo. Their restraint from these meat products was based upon the fact that the animal provided labor and were also the main part of their trade. They would only make meals from animals who were still fresh and died of known causes. 

They would also not eat frogs or fish that were found dead rather than killed for their meat. Vegetables were common in their diet, and were consumed in many varieties. The Kula were experts plant lore from their reliance on the natural resources that were available during their travels. Tea was often consumed in place of water and was a regular staple at their homes and during their travel. Alcohol consumption was forbidden because Kula merchants practiced magic to protect them on their journeys and alcohol was believed to prevent this.

===Architecture===
The houses in Pailin are built from wood panels, 8&amp;nbsp;cm to 1 m wide, and includes a wide door and, in the middle of house, there are shrines to [[Gautama Buddha]]. The Kula often plant roses in front of their homes.

[[File:Syr-Land-Bank-property-2016-09.jpg|thumb|300px|Syracuse Land Bank property, [[Syracuse, New York]]]]

'''Land banking''' is the practice of aggregating parcels of land for future sale or [[land development|development]].

While in many countries ''land banking'' may refer to various private [[real-estate]] [[investment]] schemes, in the United States it refers to the establishment of [[Government-owned corporation|quasi-governmental]] [[County (United States)|county]] or [[Municipality|municipal]] authorities purposed with managing an inventory of surplus land.

==Municipal land banks in the United States==
===Definition===
[[File:Urban Blight in Philadelphia.jpg|thumbnail|right|Blighted land in Philadelphia]]
Land banks are quasi-governmental entities created by counties or municipalities to effectively manage and repurpose an inventory of [[Urban decay|underused, abandoned, or foreclosed property]]. They are often chartered to have powers that enable them to accomplish these goals in ways that existing government agencies can not. While the land bank "model" has gained broad support and has been implemented in a number of cities, they are implemented differently so as to best address both municipal needs and the state and local legal context in which they were created.&lt;ref name="Frank S. Alexander"&gt;{{cite web|author=Frank S. Alexander |url=http://www.smartgrowthamerica.org/documents/ccp_land_banks.pdf |title=Land Banks and Land Banking |agency=Center for Community Progress |publisher=BusinessWeek |date=June 2011 |accessdate=2013-05-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606080059/http://www.smartgrowthamerica.org/documents/ccp_land_banks.pdf |archivedate=June  6, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
The period of [[deindustrialization]] in the United States coupled with increased [[suburbanization]] in the middle of the 20th century left many American cities with large amounts of [[Urban decay|vacant &amp; blighted industrial, residential, and commercial property]]. Beginning in the early 1970s municipalities began to seek solutions to manage decline or spur revitalization in once prosperous city neighborhoods. The first land bank was created in [[St. Louis]] in 1971.&lt;ref name="Frank S. Alexander"/&gt; While additional municipalities continued to adopt them at a trickle it wasn’t until the mid 2000s that land banks became viewed as a tested, reliable, and accepted model and experienced widespread implementation – particularly after the success of the [[Genesee County, Michigan|Genesee County Land Bank]]. In 2009 the [[Department of Housing and Urban Development]] issued a report embracing land banks as a best practices model for municipalities dealing with the effects of the real estate market collapse and the ensuing foreclosure crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sage Computing, Inc.|url=http://www.huduser.org/portal/publications/landbanks.pdf |title=Revitalizing Foreclosed Properties with Land Banks |publisher=U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development: Office of Policy Development and Research |date=August 2009 |accessdate=2013-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investment land banking by country==

===United Kingdom===
Land banking in the UK was previously the preserve of the landed gentry or [[real estate developer]]s. Many reputable listed commercial [[building companies]] engage successfully in land banking for future building projects. Companies also purchase land sites and easily divide them into smaller plots, then offer these plots for sale to individual investors. This relatively new practice in the UK does not fall under the control of the Financial Services Authority. Many people are wary of this form of investment as many plot based land banking companies have failed or been closed down. There are currently no audited successes recorded for UK plot based land banking despite the UK having gone through a major property boom in the period 2002 – Jul 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tony Levene |url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2009/nov/07/landbanking-investment-scheme |title=Land Banking – The Plot Thickens |publisher=Guardian |date=November 9, 2009 |accessdate=2010-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A landbanking scheme that is a [[Collective investment scheme]] is a "regulated activity"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.landregistry.gov.uk/public/guides/public-guide-21#guide-mark-6 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120621075802/http://www.landregistry.gov.uk/public/guides/public-guide-21 |archivedate=June 21, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; for the purposes of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and, according to section 19(1), may only be operated in the UK by a person who is either authorised or exempt. Section 26 provides that an agreement made by a person in contravention of this is unenforceable and any sums paid to him may be recovered together with compensation for any loss suffered. After recent FSA enforcement of this regulation many companies selling UK land plots have moved outside of the European Union and only offer land plots to non UK residents who are not protected by FSA regulations.

====Companies offering land banking plots in the UK====
Since the changes in the land registration act, a number of companies offering UK land plots as an investment have been formed. Typically this land is greenbelt, nature conservation, flood plain,  agricultural or protected land unsuitable for development. There are no recorded successful planning permission applications for plots sold under such collective investment schemes.

There have been considerable losses recorded by investors in UK land plot investment schemes. A large number of British companies offering UK land plots have failed or been shut down by the FSA or other authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mynewsdesk.com/uk/view/pressrelease/insolvency-service-pontoon-cib-winds-up-21-companies-in-a-day-373438 |title=9 Land Banking Companies Wound Up |publisher=Mynewsdesk.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/trends-events/investigations/12677184-1.html |title=Three companies are ordered into liquidation following a government investigation |publisher=Allbusiness.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mynewsdesk.com/uk/view/pressrelease/insolvency-service-national-high-court-orders-five-land-banking-companies-into-liquidation-391681 |title=5 Land Banking Companies Liquidated |publisher=Mynewsdesk.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some companies have now moved offshore after FSA investigation. Some companies now offer UK land plots from locations such as Dubai or Singapore where the local authorities do not regulate such activities, or are not aware of the high risk nature of the investment. In June 2010 the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) issued a warning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moneysense.gov.sg/publications/quick_tips/Consumer_Portal_Land_Banking.html |title=Land Banking – Look before you leap |publisher=Moneysense.gov.sg |date= |accessdate=2010-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; on land banking plots schemes warning they may be a scam with specific focus on companies offering land from the UK and Canada.

====Sales methods====
A company representative may contact an individual by telephone, in temporary shopping center booths, or at [http://www.kampcrystalresidency.com property] shows and offer a strategic land investment in the UK. Very often UK government or industry statistics, the proximity of the land to built up areas, or the recent history of UK house prices are quoted as a demonstration of why the land plot is a great investment. Verbal communication will often indicate that the land is fast tracked for building approval and has strong potential as [[building land]]. When pricing the land reference is typically made to approved building land prices at the market peak. Very often the land banking company will present detailed plans showing a housing development on the site. These plans are often referred to as "pre-approved", "concept" or "predevelopment". The sales person will focus on the potential future value of the land against the current selling price.

No reference is ever made to the value of green belt or agricultural land, or the issues involved with the long term maintenance, and collectively selling tiny plots of land. The sales price is typically uplifted 10–100 times over the current value of the land. Plans shown have no validity in UK planning law and cannot be considered as any indication of progress in the planning process. No written contractual promise is ever given for planning permission despite typically extreme optimism by the sales person. The sales person will typically never mention that the land is protected, or greenbelt land and cannot be developed under current planning regulations. There is typically no possibility of planning permission in any reasonable timeframe.

The investor may end up paying a considerable amount of money for a small area of low value land which has a very high risk of standing undeveloped. Once the general public becomes aware of the lack of viability of the proposed plot investment scheme, the re-sale value of the individual plots collapses. This is typically followed by the land plot company liquidating completely, or relocating to another legal jurisdiction.

For customers that show a willingness to purchase such schemes there may also be attempts to sell additional plot based land banking products at alternate locations, or other [[High-yield investment program|high yield investment programmes]]. Customers may also be added to [[sucker list|suckers lists]] which are then sold to other companies offering similar schemes. When the land banking plot company fails plot investors may also be offered investment recovery or planning services for a fee. Such services typically are fraudulent or fail and lead to a further loss of money for the investor.

====Controversies====
A ''[[You and Yours]]'' documentary, first aired on BBC Radio 4 in December 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Abbott |first=Melanie |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6177017.stm |title=CPRE wants 'land banking' regulation |publisher=BBC News |date=December 14, 2006 |accessdate=2010-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; criticized the services offered by many land banking companies in the United Kingdom, suggesting that they were scamming their customers. A land banking scam is based on the very low chance of any of the plots receiving planning permission and the very high profit margins taken on the land plots, with the seller using misleading marketing tactics to convince the buyers that they are making a sound investment.

A key strategy used for selling United Kingdom land plots is to imply that because a customer owns the land plot, they cannot lose their money. The land banking company typically suggests dramatic annual increases in the value of the land plots, and a very optimistic time frame for successful planning applications. These are never contractually committed. Typically the land banking company sells a land plot at a premium of 15 to 100 times the current market value of undeveloped land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learnmoney.co.uk/advice/advice-87.html |title=Land Banking Companies – Why the majority of them are (legal) scams |publisher=Learnmoney.co.uk |date=June 17, 2008 |accessdate=2010-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; A purchaser might pay £15,000 for a land plot that only has a current market value of £500. On this basis, most of the investment is not in land, and the small percentage annual increases in the value of the land plot are meaningless. The actual investment is in a proposed service to deliver valuable approved building land in the future. If that service is never delivered or is not successful, the remaining land asset is normally worthless. Should the selling company fail or disappear, the plot owner cannot economically sell the plot, as the administrative effort and cost of sale typically exceeds the value of the land plot.

Many land banking companies target victims outside of the United Kingdom, particularly Canada, Singapore, Thailand, Brunei and Malaysia. Residents of these countries may be naive of the UK property market and local planning regulations such as [[green belt]] zoning.

In 2008, the land banking firm UKLI was placed into administration&lt;ref name="thisismoney1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Philip Scott, This is Money4 June 2008, 12:00am |url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/news/article.html?in_article_id=442527&amp;in_page_id=2 |title=FSA shuts down UKLI 'land banking' firm: UK Land Investments |publisher=This is Money |date=June 4, 2008 |accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to insolvency, despite having taken £69 million from 4,500 people for land plots.

The [[HM Land Registry|UK Land Registry]] issued a press release&lt;ref name="landreg1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.landreg.gov.uk/about_us/pressoffice/notices/default.asp?article_id=19829 |title=Land Registry : Press notice |publisher=Landreg.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091101145935/http://www.landreg.gov.uk/about_us/pressoffice/notices/default.asp?article_id=19829 |archivedate=November  1, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; on January 15, 2009 advising consumers that the Land Registry has published a guide warning against land banking investment schemes. Land Registry Head of Corporate Legal Services Mike Westcott Rudd said that the public were being "misled about the prospects of obtaining planning permission", with well-known banks and developers being falsely cited as partners in the project, and that in some cases forged Land Registry paperwork was being presented to suggest that planning approval existed where it did not.

===United States===
====Government====
[[File:Syr-Land-Bank-sign.jpg|thumb|300px|Syracuse Land Bank sign, Syracuse, New York]]
In 2011 [[New York State]] passed a land bank statute authorizing the establishment of nonprofits in each county to take title to vacant abandoned homes so they can be rehabilitated, sold or demolished in an orderly fashion. Many counties upstate including [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]], [[Onondaga County, New York|Onondaga County]], [[Schenectady County]] and [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]] have abandoned homes as people moved to the suburbs. Some properties have been abandoned due to back taxes and the city has taken title. [http://esd.ny.gov/BusinessPrograms/Data/NYSLBP/LandBankAct_Article16NPCL.pdf] 

The recent [[robo-signing]] settlement gave Attorney General [[Eric Schneiderman]] the wherewithal to fund land banks in Schenectady and Albany. [http://wamc.org/post/schneiderman-announces-land-bank-funding]

The state of [[Michigan]] also has a land bank program [http://www.michigan.gov/landbank]. [[Ohio]] passed land bank legislation in 2009.

====Commercial====
Land banking as an investment is nothing new to America. Several self-made billionaires started by purchasing large tracts in California where the development opportunities had not yet arisen. People such as [[Bob Hope]] and [[Donald Trump]] have reaped tremendous reward from buying large areas and holding the property until the market commanded a considerable return when sold. There have however, also been many land scams in the US, such as the large areas of Florida swampland which were sold as being suitable for real estate.

Florida land scams have history as far back as the 1920s Florida Land Rush. Many Florida Counties have traces of these land scams today. Polk County Florida in particular has been devastated with land banking scams. Polk County, being the land that lies between the city of Tampa, in Hillsborough County Florida and the city of Orlando, in Orange County Florida has been a hot bed for speculative land development. North Polk County falls within the lower Green Swamp. The State of Florida has declared the Green Swamp "land of critical state concern". During the 1970s through the late 1980s the Green Swamp was sold as being suitable for real estate development. The development of Disney World and the attraction it received was the sales tool to persuade individuals to buy one acre lots at high speculative prices. These prices ranged from $2,000 to as high as $15,000 per acre. The Florida land banking scams continue today and are mostly operated outside of the United States. Unwary foreign customers are sold Florida land from outside the U.S. borders through contracts for deed arrangements.

===Australia===
In December 2008, at the depths of the Global Financial Crisis, the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) relaxed laws regarding foreign investment in Australian real estate. Under previous legislation temporary residents were only allowed to purchase a property for Principal Place of Residence purposes valued at up to $300,000. Under new laws active since February 2009, this monetary limit has been removed.

In March 2010, the Reserve Bank of Australia governor announced that it is monitoring the effect of the rule change on the housing market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-03-25/australia-s-stevens-monitors-foreign-home-buyers-as-prices-jump.html |title=Australia's Stevens Monitors Foreign Home Buyers as Prices Jump |publisher=BusinessWeek |date=March 25, 2010 |accessdate=2010-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329144746/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-03-25/australia-s-stevens-monitors-foreign-home-buyers-as-prices-jump.html |archivedate=March 29, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 24, 2010, Assistant Treasurer Senator Nick Sherry announced the tightening of foreign investment laws as a result of a public backlash to the changes made a year earlier. Whilst they are still entitled to purchase a property of any value, temporary Residents must now sell their residence upon leaving the country, and must report all purchases to the Foreign Investment Review Board, effectively eliminating this land banking loophole. However, foreign companies are allowed to purchase property to house local staff.

It is possible for foreign individuals to create a registered company for the sole purpose of purchasing property in Australia and actively bypass the loophole fix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assistant.treasurer.gov.au/DisplayDocs.aspx?doc=pressreleases/2010/074.htm&amp;pageID=003&amp;min=njsa&amp;Year=&amp;DocType= |title=Press Release – Government Tightens Foreign Investment Rules for Residential Housing [24/04/2010&amp;#93; |publisher=Assistant.treasurer.gov.au |date=April 24, 2010 |accessdate=2010-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706122544/http://assistant.treasurer.gov.au/DisplayDocs.aspx?doc=pressreleases%2F2010%2F074.htm&amp;pageID=003&amp;min=njsa&amp;Year=&amp;DocType= |archivedate=July  6, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of April 20, 2010, the COAG has agreed the Housing Supply and '''Affordability''' [http://www.adhikariawasyojana2.com/]Reform Working Party will extend the land audit work to examine ‘underused examine private holdings of large parcels of land by mid-2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coag.gov.au/coag_meeting_outcomes/2010-04-19/docs/Communique_20_April_2010.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009063639/http://www.coag.gov.au/coag_meeting_outcomes/2010-04-19/docs/communique_20_April_2010.pdf |archivedate=October  9, 2010 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agricultural land banking==
[[Image:ParaguayChaco_Clearings_for_cattle_grazing.jpg|thumb|Advancing agriculture in the [[Gran Chaco|Paraguay Chaco]].]]
While most land banking is based on the prospect of urban areas expanding at the expense of rural areas, in various parts of the world agricultural land is expanding at the expense of virgin land. The purchase of virgin land that has been identified as suitable for agriculture because of its climate, topography and soil properties, where the buyer has no intention to work the land himself or lease it out, would be agricultural land banking.

Such lands are often rather far away from existing infrastructure when purchased by the land banking investor, therefore prices being low. The investor anticipates that, because of the area's natural productive potential, an agricultural infrastructure (sufficient roads, specialised contractors, grain storages) will develop, with more land put under cultivation and land values multiplying.

Agricultural land banking is found where large tracts of fertile virgin land still exist, where valuations are low and where legislation allows large land holdings (free hold) by domestic and foreign investors.
Typical countries for such investments during recent years have been [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Uruguay]],
[[Paraguay]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

  | publisher = Peer Voss, a farm realtor
  | url = http://www.ventacamposparaguay.com/farmland.htm
  |accessdate=2008-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; where land prices appreciated accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Uruguay ranch-, farmland|url=http://www.agro.pvoss.de/|accessdate=2011-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the perception that the world's fertile land is a limited and valuable asset is by no means new, it received renewed public and media attention with the [[global food crisis]], when phrases like ''[[peak wheat]]'' or ''peak soil''&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2153">'''Landsforbundet for Kvinders Valgret''' or LKV (National Association for Women's Suffrage), was a Danish association for [[women's suffrage]], active from 1907 until 1915.&lt;ref name=dsd&gt;{{cite web|url=http://denstoredanske.dk/Samfund,_jura_og_politik/Samfund/Kvindesagen/Landsforbundet_for_Kvinders_Valgret|title=Landsforbundet for Kvinders Valgret|author=Posselt, Hanne Nørregaard |publisher=Gyldendal: ''Den Store Danske''|accessdate=11 October 2018 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The association originated from the local women's association ''Politisk Kvindeforening''. In 1906, ''Københavns Kvindevalgretsforening'' was founded, and in 1907, the name was changed to Landsforbundet for Kvinders Valgret. It was founded by [[Elna Munch]], [[Johanne Rambusch]] and [[Marie Hjelmer]]. From the start, [[Julie Arenholt]] was one of the most influential members.&lt;ref name=kvinfo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kvinfo.dk/side/597/bio/1062/|title=Julie Arenholt (1873 - 1952)|author=Ravn, Anna-Birte|publisher=kvonfo|accessdate=11 October 2018 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation was founded in response to the women's suffrage work of [[Dansk Kvindesamfund]], which was regarded too careful by the founders of the LKV. The LKV became a national wide organisation which united all the local branches of women suffrage organisations in Denmark and founded new ones. The organisation was dissolved when the goal was met in 1915.&lt;ref name=dsd/&gt;

The '''Lebu''' ('''Lebou''', ''Lébou'') are an ethnic group of [[Senegal]], [[West Africa]], living on the peninsula of [[Cap-Vert]].  The Lebu are primarily a fishing community, but they have a substantial business in construction supplies.&lt;ref name="keese"&gt;Keese, Alexander, "Ethnicity and the Colonial State: Finding and Representing Group Identifications in a Coastal West African and Global Perspective (1850–1960)", BRILL (2015), p. 94, {{ISBN|9789004307353}}[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-QPCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA94]&lt;/ref&gt; They speak [[Lebu Wolof]], which is closely related to Wolof proper but is not intelligible with it. Their political and spiritual capital is at Layene, situated in the [[Yoff]] neighborhood of northern [[Dakar]]. They have a religious sect and theocracy, the [[Layene]], headquartered there.&lt;ref name="keese"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Douglas H., "Sufism, Mahdism and Nationalism: Limamou Laye and the Layennes of Senegal", A&amp;C Black (2012), p. 57, {{ISBN|9781441169075}} [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-4MJ20vZm08C&amp;pg=PA57#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional date of the founding of Yoff is 1430. Although they were conquered by the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Jolof|Jolof (Diolof)]] and [[Cayor]], and later the [[France|French]] in the 19th century, and were incorporated into modern [[Senegal]], since 1815 they have had a special legal autonomy as a special kind of "theocratic republic".

Lebu society emphasizes piety and respect for elders. Lebu families include not only living people but also associated ancestral spirits.  The Lebu are noted for their public exorcism dances and rituals, often attended by tourists.

In addition to [[Yoff]], other Lebu centres are nearby [[Ouakam]], [[Cambérène]] and [[Ngor, Dakar|Ngor]].

}}This '''list of journalists killed during the Syrian Civil War''' includes the foreign war correspondents, Syrian professional journalists (including those who work for pro-government media outlets), and Syrian citizen journalists (including those who work for opposition forces) killed since the beginning of the [[Syrian civil war|civil war]] in 2011 and who have died as a result of their reporting. Also included in a separate form are those journalists whose whereabouts are unknown or whose disappearance is a result of their reporting and the period of their disappearance, including those cases where it is unknown as to whether or not they are casualties.

'''Martin Rhonheimer''' (born 1950 in [[Zurich]], [[Switzerland]]) is a Swiss [[political philosophy]] professor and priest of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[personal prelature]] [[Opus Dei]]. {{as of|July 2017}} he is teaching professor at the Opus Dei-affiliated [[Pontifical University of the Holy Cross]] in [[Rome]].

==Life==
Rhonheimer was born 1950 in [[Zurich]], [[Switzerland]] into a [[Swiss Jews|Swiss Jewish]] family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pusc.it/fil/p_rhonheimer/texts/EdithSteinDT.htm ''Die Tagespost'', 22 March 2003]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928130624/http://www.pusc.it/fil/p_rhonheimer/texts/EdithSteinDT.htm |date=28 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied philosophy, history, political science and theology in Zurich and Rome.

In 1974, he joined the [[personal prelature]] [[Opus Dei]] as a [[Types of membership of Opus Dei|numerary]] member.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}
In 1983, he was ordained a [[Types of membership of Opus Dei|priest]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

{{as of|July 2017}} he teaches at the Opus Dei-affiliated [[Pontifical University of the Holy Cross]] in [[Rome]]. His main interests are in [[political philosophy]], [[ethics]], the history of [[liberalism]].

==Opinions==
Rhonheimer´s regular editorials have been published by the German FAZ&lt;ref name=barm&gt;Martin Rhonheimer, [http://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/wirtschaftspolitik/martin-rhonheimer-ist-priester-und-neoliberal-14873611-p2.html?printPagedArticle=true#pageIndex_3 Barmherzigkeit schafft keinen Wohlstand], FAZ, 19 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kath.net/news/58674 'Barmherzigkeit schafft keinen Wohlstand'], kath.net, 28 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and Neue Zürcher Zeitung.

===Islam===
In 2014, Rhonheimer wrote in the [[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]], that the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]] was no heresy, but "a recurring pattern in the history of violent expansion. The model is Muhammad himself", and that Islamic State was legitimized in the Koran and the [[Sharia]], that "no arguments within Muslim theology that can be used to condemn Islamic State's behavior as un-Islamic" can be found.&lt;ref name=jihad&gt;[https://www.jihadwatch.org/2014/10/professor-at-pontifical-university-of-the-holy-cross-in-rome-islamic-state-not-un-islamic-model-is-muhammad-himself Professor at Pontifical University of the Holy Cross in Rome: Islamic State not un-Islamic, "model is Muhammad himself"], Jihadwatch.org, 6 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nzz&gt;Martin Rhonheimer [https://www.nzz.ch/feuilleton/toeten-im-namen-allahs-1.18378020 Töten im Namen Allahs], Neue Zürcher Zeitung, 6 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Rhonheimer claimed, that Islam is more than a religion, but a [[cult]] with political and social rules, uniting religion and political and social order in one, and that "it has always been violent." He wrote that "Islam’s central problem is the warlike, expansionist Islam from Medina, the legitimacy of killing for Allah's honor and a violent Muhammad."&lt;ref name=jihad/&gt;&lt;ref name=nzz/&gt;

===Separation of church and state===
In 2014, Rhonheimer wrote that a foundational element of Christianity was the separation of church and politics, which could be understood as synonymous to [[separation of church and state]].&lt;ref name=nzz/&gt;

===Economy===
In 2017, Rhonheimer criticized [[Pope Francis]]' view that "this economy kills". He supports [[neoliberal]] views of enterpreneurship, for which [[free market capitalism]] is "necessary". He says that "seeking profits is good per se and in a free and lawfully ordered market system it creates wellbeing for everyone". He criticizes [[Catholic social teaching]]s because there were "no exact formulations in the New Testament" and they "had always been a product of their time".&lt;ref name=barm/&gt;
"Inzwischen haben wir ein Sozialstaatskirchensystem bekommen, weil sich die Kirche in die Strukturen des umverteilenden Steuer- und Sozialstaates derart eingebunden hat, dass sie nicht mehr frei ist, ein System in Frage zu stellen, das zum Beispiel dem Subsidiaritätsprinzip eklatant widerspricht und ökonomisch falsche Anreize setzt."&lt;ref name=barm/&gt; ["''In the meantime, we have gotten a welfare-state church-system, because the church has become so integrated into the structures of the redistributive tax and welfare state that it is no longer free to question a system that, for example, blatantly contradicts the principle of subsidiarity and provides economically false incentives''."]

==Books==
Rhonheimer has published a dozen books on topics concerning the philosophy of moral action, virtue, [[natural law]], Aquinas, Aristotle, the ethics of [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[bioethics]].

'''Muslim Rajputs''' or '''Musulman Rajputs''', are [[patrilineal]] descendants of [[Rajputs]] of Northern regions of the [[Indian Subcontinent]] who are followers of [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/pdfid/4b6fe2403.pdf |title=UNHCR Refugee Review Tribunal. IND32856, 6 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Muslim Rajputs can be found in Northern [[India]], [[Azad Kashmir|Kashmir]], and in the Pakistani provinces of [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] and [[Sindh]].&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; They are further divided into different clans.

==History==
The term ''Rajput'' is traditionally applied to the original [[Suryavansha|Suryavanshi]], [[Chandravanshi]] and [[Agnivanshi]] clans, who claimed to be [[Kshatriya]] in the Hindu [[Varna (Hinduism)|varna]] system.

===Conversion to Islam and ethos===

===Medieval Muslim Rajput dynasties of the Indian subcontinent===
====Katara dynasty====
{{Main article|Katara Rajput}}
The Ismaili Rajputs replaced the Sunni Arab in Punjab in the 9th century. The dynasty lasted until the mid-11th century and had Multan as its capital. The Katara's are one the most persecuted people in Punjab especially during the [[Ghazni]] rule, after which they went into seclusion for self-preservation. They had converted to [[Ismaili Islam]] under the [[Da'i]] Halam b. Shayban, sent by [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatmid]] Caliph. In their rule [[Multan]] saw a period of peace, expansion of commerce and trade, and flourishing local culture.

====Soomra dynasty====
{{Main article|Soomra dynasty}}
The Rajput [[Soomra dynasty]] replaced the Arab [[Habbari dynasty]] in the 10th century. The dynasty lasted until the mid-13th century. The Soomras are one the longest running dynasties in the [[history of Sindh]], lasting 325 years. They had converted to Islam under the Arab rule. During their reign, Sindh saw a period of relative peace, expansion of commerce and trade, and flourishing local culture.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uok.edu.pk/faculties/sindhi/docs/soomroEng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

====Samma dynasty====
{{Main article|Samma dynasty}}
The Samma era saw the rise of [[Thatta]] as an important commercial and cultural centre. At the time the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese occupation]] of the trading centre of [[Hormuz Island|Hormuz]] in 1514 CE,{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} trade from the Sindh accounted for nearly 10% of their customs revenue, and they described Thatta as one of the richest cities in the world. Thatta's prosperity was based partly on its own high-quality cotton and silk textile industry, partly on export of goods from further inland in the Punjab and northern India.&lt;ref&gt;The Global World of Indian Merchants, 1750-1947: Traders of Sind from Bukhara to Panama by Claude Markovits, 2000 {{ISBN|0-521-62285-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-62285-1}}]&lt;/ref&gt;{{pn|date=January 2018}}

The Samma period contributed significantly to the evolution of the [[Indo-Islamic architecture|Indo-Islamic architectural]] style. Thatta is famous for its necropolis, which covers 10 square km on the [[Makli Hill]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archnet.org/library/places/one-place.jsp?place_id=2179&amp;order_by=year&amp;showdescription=1 Archnet.org: Thattah] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606120407/https://archnet.org/library/places/one-place.jsp?place_id=2179&amp;order_by=year&amp;showdescription=1 |date=6 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Muzaffarid dynasty====
{{Main article|Muzaffarid dynasty of Gujarat|Gujarat Sultanate}}
The Gujarat Sultanate was an independent [[Rajput]] kingdom established in the early 15th century by the [[Muzaffarids (Gujarat)|Muzaffarid dynasty]] in [[Gujarat]]. Under the dynasty, trade, culture, and [[Indo-Islamic architecture]] flourished. The city of [[Ahmedabad, Gujarat|Ahmedabad]] was founded by the dynasty.

===Notable people in medieval India===
*[[Hasan Khan Mewati|Raja Hasan Khan Mewati]], was the ruler of [[Mewat]] and built the [[Alwar fort]]
*[[Isa Khan]], was the Chief of the [[Baro Bhuiyans]] (twelve landlords) of 16th century [[Bengal]]. Throughout his reign he resisted the [[Mughal Empire]]

==Beliefs and customs==
Rajputs who accepted Islam often retain common social practices (such as [[purdah]] [seclusion of women], which is generally followed by Hindu, Sikh and Muslim Rajputs).&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/490157/Rajput|title=Rajput|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mutawakkilite Kingdom''' ({{lang-ar|المملكة المتوكلية}} ''{{transl|ar|al-Mamlakah al-Mutawakkilīyah}}''), also known as the '''Kingdom of Yemen''' or, retrospectively, as '''[[North Yemen]]''', was a state that existed between 1918 and 1962 in the northern part of what is now [[Yemen]]. Its capital was [[Sana'a]] until 1948, then [[Taiz]]. From 1962 to 1970, it maintained control over portions of Yemen until finally defeated in the [[North Yemen Civil War]]. Yemen was admitted to the [[United Nations]] on 30 September 1947.

== History ==
Religious leaders of the [[Zaiddiyah|Zaydi]]  expelled forces of the [[Ottoman Empire]] from what is now northern Yemen by the middle of the 17th century but, within a century, the unity of Yemen was fractured due to the difficulty of governing Yemen's mountainous [[topography|terrain]]. In 1849, the Ottoman Empire occupied the coastal [[Tihamah]] region to put pressure on the Zaiddiyah imam to sign a treaty recognizing Ottoman [[suzerainty]] and allowing for a small Ottoman force to be stationed in [[Sana'a]]. However, the Ottomans were slow to gain control over Yemen and never managed to eliminate all resistance from local Zaydis. In 1913, shortly before [[World War I]], the Ottoman Empire was forced to cede some power formally to [[Highland (geography)|highland]] Zaydis.
On 30 October 1918, following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, [[Yahya Muhammad Hamid ed-Din|Imam Yahya Muhammad]] of the [[Qasimids|al-Qasimi]] [[dynasty]] declared northern Yemen an independent [[sovereign state]]. In 1926, Yahya proclaimed the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen, becoming both a temporal king as well as a (Zaydi) [[spiritual leader]], and won [[diplomatic recognition|international recognition]] for his new state, such as with the [[Kingdom of Italy]], entering into the [[Italo-Yemeni Treaty]] in 1926.

In the 1920s, Yahya had expanded his power to the north into [[Tihamah]] and  [['Asir]], but he collided with the rising influence of the [[House of Saud|Saudi]] king of [[Kingdom of Nejd and Hejaz|Nejd and Hejaz]], [[Ibn Saud|Abdul Aziz ibn Sa'ud]]. In the early 1930s, Saudi forces retook much of these gains before withdrawing from some of the area, including the southern Tihamah city of [[Al Hudaydah]]. The present-day boundary with [[Saudi Arabia]] was established by the 20 May 1934 [[Treaty of Taif]], following the [[Saudi–Yemeni War (1934)|Saudi-Yemeni War]] in 1934. Yahya's non-recognition of his kingdom's southern boundary with the [[British Empire|British]] [[Aden Protectorate]] (later the [[People's Democratic Republic of Yemen]]) that had been negotiated by his Ottoman predecessors resulted in occasional clashes with the British.

In 1932, the governments of Yemen and the [[Kingdom of Iraq]] signed a treaty which led to the training of Yemeni Army officers in Iraq. Later, several of them would play a key role in the [[North Yemen Civil War#Coup_d.27.C3.A9tat|1962 coup d'état in North Yemen]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.de/books?id=tjXRfqBv_0UC&amp;pg=PA190#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Robert D. Burrowes: ''Historical Dictionary of Yemen'', Lanham, Maryland: Scarecrow Press 2000, p. 190.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kingdom of Yemen became a founding member of the [[Arab League]] in 1945 and joined the [[United Nations]] on 30 September 1947. It committed a small expeditionary force to the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]].&lt;ref name="Morris, 2008, p. 205"&gt;Morris, Benny (2008), [https://books.google.com/books?id=CC7381HrLqcC&amp;pg=PA332&amp;lpg=PA332 ''1948: The First Arab-Israeli War''], [[Yale University Press]], p.205, New Haven, {{ISBN|978-0-300-12696-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Imam Yahya was assassinated in an unsuccessful [[Yahia clan coup|coup d'état in 1948]], but was eventually succeeded by a firm heir - Yahya's son, Imam [[Ahmad bin Yahya]], who regained power several months later. His reign was marked by growing development, openness and renewed friction with the [[United Kingdom]] over the British presence in the south that stood in the way of his aspirations for the creation of [[Greater Yemen]]. He was slightly more forward-thinking than his father, and was more open to foreign contacts.  Nonetheless, his regime, like his father's, was autocratic and semi-medieval in character; even the most mundane measures required his personal approval.

In March 1955, a coup by a group of officers and two of Ahmad's brothers briefly deposed the king but was quickly suppressed. Ahmad faced growing pressures, supported by the [[Arab nationalism]] objectives of President of [[Egypt]], [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] and, in April 1956, he signed a mutual defense pact with Egypt. In 1958, Yemen joined the [[United Arab Republic]] (a federation of Egypt and [[Syria]]) in a [[confederation]] known as the [[United Arab States]], but this confederation was dissolved soon after Syria withdrew from the United Arab Republic and the United Arab States in September 1961, and relations between Egypt and Yemen subsequently deteriorated.

Imam Ahmad died in September 1962, and was succeeded by his son, the Crown Prince [[Muhammad al-Badr]], whose reign was brief. Egyptian-trained military officers inspired by Nasser and led by the commander of the royal guard, [[Abdullah as-Sallal]], deposed him the same year of his coronation, took control of Sana'a, and created the [[Yemen Arab Republic]] (YAR). This fighting sparked the [[North Yemen Civil War]], and created a new front in the [[Arab Cold War]], in which Egypt assisted the YAR with troops and supplies to combat forces loyal to the imamate, while the monarchies of [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Jordan]] supported Badr's royalist forces opposing the newly formed republic. Conflict continued periodically until 1967 when Egyptian troops were withdrawn. By 1968, following a final royalist siege of Sana'a, most of the opposing leaders reached a reconciliation, and Saudi Arabia recognized the republic in 1970.

Most are found in northern [[Republic of Dagestan|Dagestan]] and [[Stavropol Krai]], as well as in [[Karachay-Cherkessia]] and [[Astrakhan Oblast]]; some also live in [[Chechnya]]. They speak the [[Nogai language]] and are descendants of various [[Mongols|Mongolic]] and [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] tribes who formed the [[Nogai Horde]]. There are two main groups of Nogais:
* the [[Ak Nogai]] and;
* the [[Karagash]] or Qara-Nogai (also known as Kichi{{cn|date=October 2016}}).

== Geographic distribution ==
In the 1990s, 65,000 were still living in the Northern Caucasus, divided into Aq (White) Nogai and Qara (Black) Nogai tribal confederations.  Nogais live in the territories of [[Republic of Dagestan|Dagestan]], [[Chechnya]], [[Stavropol Krai|Stavropol district]]  and [[Astrakhan Oblast]]. From 1928 there was a [[Nogaysky District, Republic of Dagestan]] and from 2007 a [[Nogaysky District, Karachay-Cherkess Republic]].

A few thousand Nogais live in [[Dobruja]] (today in [[Romania]]), in the town of [[Mihail Kogălniceanu, Constanţa|Mihail Kogălniceanu]] (Karamurat) and villages of [[Lumina, Constanţa|Lumina]] (Kocali), [[Medgidia|Valea Dacilor]] (Hendekkarakuyusu), [[Cobadin]] (Kubadin).

An estimated 90,000 Nogais live in Turkey today, mainly settled in Ceyhan/Adana, Ankara and Eskisehir provinces. The Nogai language is still spoken in some of the villages of Central Anatolia - mainly around the Salt Lake, Eskişehir and Ceyhan. To this day, Nogais in Turkey have maintained their cuisine: ''Üken börek, kasık börek, tabak börek, şır börek, köbete'' and ''Nogay şay'' (Nogai tea - a drink prepared by boiling milk and tea together with butter, salt and pepper).

The ''[[Junior Juz]]'', or the ''Lesser Horde'' of the [[Kazakhs]], occupied the lands of the former Nogai Khanate in Western [[Kazakhstan]]. A part of Nogais joined Kazakhs in 17-18th centuries and formed separate clan or tribe called as Kazakh-Nogais. Their estimated number is about 50,000.

===Subgroups===
From the sixteenth century until their deportation in the mid-nineteenth century the Nogais living along the [[Black Sea]] northern coast were divided into the following sub-groups (west to east):
*[[Budjak|Bucak]] (Budjak) Nogais inhabited the area from [[Danube]] to [[Dniester]].
*[[Yedisan|Cedsan]] (Yedisan) Nogais inhabited the land from Dniester to [[Southern Bug]].
*Camboyluk  (Jamboyluk) Nogais inhabited in the lands from Bug to the beginning of [[Crimean Peninsula]].
*Cedişkul (Jedishkul) Nogais inhabited the north of Crimean peninsula.
*[[Kuban]] Nogais inhabited the north of Sea of Azov around [[Prymorsk]] (previously Nogaisk).

==History==
{{Main|Nogai Horde}}

The name ''Nogai'' derives from [[Nogai Khan]] (died 1299/1300, great-great-grandson of [[Genghis Khan]]), a general of the [[Golden Horde]] (also called the Kipchak Khanate).&lt;ref&gt;

The Mongol tribe called the Manghits ([[Manghut]]) constituted a core of the [[Nogai Horde]]. The Nogai Horde supported the [[Astrakhan Khanate]], and after the conquest of [[Astrakhan]] in 1556 by [[Tsardom of Russia | Russians]], they transferred their allegiance to the [[Crimean Khanate]]. The Nogais protected the northern borders of the Crimean khanate, and through organized raids to the [[Wild Fields]] inhibited Slavic settlement. Many Nogais migrated to the Crimean peninsula to serve as the Crimean khans' cavalry.  Settling there, they contributed to the formation of the [[Crimean Tatars]]. {{cn|reason= However, Nogais were not only soldiers, they also had agricultural skills. The Nogais mastered growing grain and irrigating on the dry steppes they inhabited. They cultivated spring wheat and drought-resistant millet.|date= January 2017}} They raised various herds and migrated seasonally in search of better pastures for their animals. Nogais were proud of their nomadic traditions and independence, which they considered superior to settled agricultural life.

The recorded history of the Nogais first commenced when {{when|date= October 2016}} representatives of the [[Ottoman Empire]] reached the [[Terek–Kuma Lowland]], where the Nogais were living as rogue clans and herders. There were two main chiefs: Yusuf [[Mirza]] and {{ill|Ismail Mirza|ru|Исмаил-бий}} ([[Bey]] of the Nogai Horde from 1555 to 1563). Yusuf Mirza supported joining the Ottomans. However, his brother Ismail Mirza, who was allied with the Russians, ambushed Yusuf and declared his chiefdom under Russian rule. After that, the supporters of Yusuf Mirza migrated to Crimea and [[Yedisan]], joining the Crimean Khanate. Supporters of Yusuf took the name ''Qara'', later named by Crimeans as ''Kichi'' ([[Lesser Nogai Horde|Small]] - founded in 1557 by {{ill|Mirza Kazy|ru|Казый (мурза}}). Those who remained in present-day West Kazakhstan and the North Caucasus (the {{ill|Great Nogay Horde|ru|Большая Ногайская Орда}}) took the name ''Uly'' (Strong).

About 500,000 Nogais migrated to present-day Turkey around the 16th century, after the fall of the Nogai Horde. They settled in the following cities: [[Şanlıurfa]], [[Gaziantep]], [[Kırşehir]], [[Eskişehir]], [[Adana]], [[Kahramanmaraş]], [[Afyon]], [[Bursa]]. These Nogais do not speak the Nogai language anymore and some of them are not aware of their ancestry; however their villages do have Nogai customs.

At the beginning of the 17th century, the ancestors of the [[Kalmyks]], the [[Oirats]], migrated from the steppes of southern Siberia on the banks of the [[Irtysh River]] to the Lower Volga region. Various theories attempt to explain this move, but the generally accepted view is that the Kalmyks sought abundant pastures for their herds.{{cn|date=November 2018}} They reached the Volga about 1630. That land, however, was not uncontested pasture, but rather the homeland of the Nogai Horde. The Kalmyks expelled the Nogais, who fled to the Northern Caucasian Plains and to the Crimean Khanate, areas under the control of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Some Nogai groups sought the protection of the Russian garrison at [[Astrakhan]]. The remaining nomadic Turkic tribes became vassals of the Kalmyk khan.

After the [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Empire |Russian annexation of Crimea]] in 1783, Slavic settlers occupied the Nogai pastoral land, since the Nogais did not have permanent residence. In the 1770s and 1780s [[Catherine the Great]] resettled approximately 120,000 Nogais from [[Bessarabia]] and areas northeast of the [[Sea of Azov]] to the Kuban and the Caucasus.&lt;ref&gt;B. B. Kochekaev, Nogaisko-Russkie Otnosheniia v XV-XVIII vv (Alma-Ata: Nauk, 1988), passim.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1790, during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1787–1792) |Russo-Turkish war]], Prince [[Grigory Potemkin]] ordered the resettlement of some Nogai families from the Caucasus (where, he feared, they might defect to the Ottomans) to the north shore of the Sea of Azov.&lt;ref&gt;P. S. Pallas, Travels through the Southern Provinces of the Russian Empire, in the Years 1793 and 1794, 2 vols. (London: S. Strahan, 1802), 1:533.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the 1792 [[Treaty of Jassy]] (Iaşi) the Russian frontier was extended to the [[Dniester]] River and the Russian takeover of Yedisan was complete. The 1812 [[Treaty of Bucharest, 1812|Treaty of Bucharest]] transferred [[Budjak]] to Russian control.

After confiscating the land previously belonged to Nogais, the Russian government forced Nogais to settle through various methods, such as burning their tents and limiting their freedom of movement. Russian general [[Alexander Suvorov]] slaughtered thousands of rebellious Kuban Nogais in 1783. Several Nogai tribes took [[refugee | refuge]] among the [[Circassians]] in this period. Several other Nogai clans began to migrate to the Ottoman Empire in great numbers. The Nogais followed two routes. An estimated 7,000 Nogais of the Bucak and Cedsan Hordes settled in [[Dobruja]] before 1860. Most of these Nogais later migrated to [[Anatolia]]. However, the great exodus of the Nogais took place in 1860. Many clans from Camboyluk and Kuban Hordes moved westwards to southern Ukraine, and wintered with their co-ethnics there in 1859. They emigrated either through the ports of [[Feodosia]] or [[Kerch]] or crossing via the Budjak steppes to Dobruja. 50,000 of the roughly 70,000 Nogais of the Kuban and adjacent [[Stavropol]] region left Russia for the Ottoman Empire during this period. They induced the Nogais of [[Crimea]] (who lived in the districts of [[Yevpatoria]], [[Perekop]] and in the north of [[Simferopol]]) to emigrate too. 300,000 Crimean Tatars (which included the Nogais) left Crimea in the year 1860. Similarly, 50,000 Nogais disappeared from southern Ukraine by 1861. [[Muhajir (Caucasus) |Other]] Nogai clans emigrated directly from the Caucasus to Anatolia, together with the Circassians. Nogais lived alongside German [[Mennonite]]s in the [[Molotschna | Molochna]] region of southern Ukraine from 1803, when the Mennonites first arrived there, until 1860, when the Nogais were deported.&lt;ref&gt;
Compare:
[https://www.goshen.edu/mqr/2000/06/april-2000-staples/ Mennonite-Nogai Economic Relations, 1825-1860]: "Mennonites lived alongside Nogais - semi-nomadic Tatar pastoralists - in the Molochna region of southern Ukraine from 1803, when Mennonites first arrived, until 1860, when the Nogais departed."

The alleged '''illicit activities of the North Korean state''' include [[Illegal drug trade|manufacture and sale of illegal drugs]], the manufacture and sale of counterfeit goods, [[human trafficking]], [[arms trafficking]], [[Wildlife trade|wildlife trafficking]], [[counterfeit money|counterfeiting currency]] (especially the [[United States dollar]] and [[Chinese yuan]]), [[terrorism]], and other areas.&lt;ref name="Nautilus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nautilus.org/publications/books/dprkbb/terrorism/dprk-briefing-book-curtailing-north-koreas-illicit-activities/|title=DPRK Briefing Book : Curtailing North Korea's Illicit Activities|author=Balbina Hwang|publisher=Heritage Foundation|date=August 25, 2003|accessdate=April 8, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6SLgVJkRm|archivedate=4 Sep 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTpg4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/23/magazine/23counterfeit.html?pagewanted=4&amp;_r=0|title=No Ordinary Counterfeit|author=Stephen Mihm |publisher=New York Times|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6SLgbhjs1|archivedate=4 Sep 2014|deadurl=no|date=July 23, 2006|accessdate=April 9, 2014|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/07/13/north-korean-diplomats-linked-to-lucrative-rhino-horn-trade-in-a/|title=North Korean diplomats linked to lucrative rhino horn trade in Africa|last=Ryall|first=Julian|date=2016-07-13|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is alleged many of these activities are undertaken at the direction and under the control of, the [[North Korean government]] and the ruling [[Workers' Party of Korea]], with their proceeds going towards advancing the country's [[North Korea and weapons of mass destruction|nuclear and conventional arms production]], funding the lifestyles of the country's elite, and propping up the [[Economy of North Korea|North Korean economy]].&lt;ref name=kan&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kan, Paul |author2=Bechton, Bruce |author3=Collins, Robert |title=Criminal Sovereignty: Understanding North Korea's Illicit International Activities|year=2010|publisher=Strategic Studies Institute |isbn=9781584874324}}{{rp|2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Unlike criminal syndicates, the extensive nature of these illegal endeavors, and the claim that they are directed and sanctioned by the highest levels of government,&lt;ref name=kan /&gt;{{rp|1}} has led to the nature of the North Korean state being defined as a form of "criminal sovereignty" by foreign policy experts such as [[Paul Rexton Kan]] and [[Bruce Bechtol]].&lt;ref name=kan /&gt;{{rp|3}}

However, there are questions remaining about the level of government involvement in each of the criminal enterprises. Many commentators agree that the North Korean state has been behind counterfeiting currency, human trafficking, the arms trade, etc., but the level to which it has been involved in the drug trade after the collapse of the [[Economy of North Korea#Food distribution system|Public Distribution System]] in the 1990s is not clear as semi-private and private black markets have arisen since then and some high-ranking officials may only be engaged in illicit trade for personal benefit.&lt;ref name=gret&gt;{{cite book|author=Greitens, Sheena|year=2014|title= Illicit: North Korea's Evolving Operations to Earn Hard Currency, Committee for Human Rights in North Korea|isbn=978-0-9856480-2-2|url=http://www.hrnk.org/uploads/pdfs/SCG-FINAL-FINAL.pdf|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6SLjbfuGJ|archivedate=4 Sep 2014|deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}}

===Critical assessment===
The British academic, Hazel Smith, has argued that the allegations have a weak foundation, being largely based on the claims of a few US officials and North Korean defectors. She has pointed out that there have been very few criminal convictions. She has queried the assumption that all the activities are directed by North Korea's government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/27/north-korea-cliches-debunked-hazel-smith|title=Dangerous, isolated and primed for war? North Korean clichés debunked|first=Hazel|last=Smith|publisher=The Guardian|date=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to North Korea scholar [[Andrei Lankov]], the country's illicit activities never developed into lucrative hard currency earners. Instead, these activities exposed the country to international condemnation in exchange for marginal gain. Lankov suggests that smuggling was never intended to earn currency for the regime, but was simply a means of survival for diplomats whose funding was cut.&lt;ref name="Lankov2016"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lankov|first=Andrei|title=The Real North Korea: Life and Politics in the Failed Stalinist Utopia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FHpYCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA23|year=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-939003-8|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drug trade==
 
It is alleged that North Korea's illegal drug trade dates back to the 1970s and includes the manufacturing, selling, and trafficking of illicit drugs, as well as counterfeit otherwise legal pharmaceuticals.&lt;ref name="Insider"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/north-korea-meth-2014-4|title=North Korea's Huge Role In Global Meth Trade Revealed In Insane Criminal Case|author=Keegan Hamilton|publisher=Business Insider|date=April 4, 2014|accessdate=April 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production began in the mountainous Hamkyung and Yangkang Provinces, particularly in the village of Yonsah, where [[Kim Il-sung]] sanctioned the creation of an [[opium]] farm.&lt;ref name=gret /&gt;{{rp|20}}

To provide a cover of legitimacy, the North Korean government uses [[front organization|front companies]], like the Ryugyong Corporation under the control of the [[Workers' Party of Korea|Korean Workers Party]]'s Foreign Relations Department, to conduct clandestine activities.&lt;ref name="NewFocus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newfocusintl.com/the-dprk-is-capitalist-when-it-wants-to-be-the-story-of-drugs-incorporated-parts-12/|title=The DPRK is capitalist when it wants to be: the story of Drugs Incorporated|author=Staff|publisher=New Focus International|date=August 18, 2012|accessdate=April 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company also holds large tracts of land within the country for the sole purpose of growing opium&lt;ref name="Nautilus"/&gt; and each year the company sent tens of thousands of dollars in hard currency to [[Kim Jong-il]] for his use. Unlike most companies, Ryugyong Corporation has no import or export quota restrictions.&lt;ref name="NewFocus"/&gt;

According to defector Yoon Yong Sol, during the [[North Korean famine|famine]] "[t]here were some complaints that during the famine we should be growing grain, not poppies, but the instruction from the central government was that if we grow poppies we can sell the product for 10 times as much to buy grain. ... The only way to earn hard currency is by drugs."&lt;ref name=gret /&gt;{{rp|22}}

Reports of [[methamphetamine]] (known as "ice drug" in North Korea) use in the country surfaced in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="ForeignPolicy"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/11/21/inside_north_koreas_crystal_meth_trade|title=Inside North Korea's Crystal Meth Trade|author=Issac Stone Fish|work=Foreign Policy|date=November 21, 2013|accessdate=September 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Isaac Stone Fish writing in ''[[Foreign Policy]]'', the production of methamphetamine in North Korea is done by chemists and other underemployed scientists.&lt;ref name="ForeignPolicy"/&gt; Methamphetamine is given as a medication within North Korea, which has helped to fuel its spread. As the production and sale of opium declined in the mid-2000s, methamphetamine became more pervasive.&lt;ref name="ForeignPolicy"/&gt; To bring in much-needed cash, the international methamphetamine trade began, spreading first to China, and with the drug being made in state-run laboratories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/08/21/how-north-korea-got-itself-hooked-on-meth/|title=How North Korea got itself hooked on meth|author=Max Fisher|work=Washington Post|date=August 21, 2013|accessdate=September 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Isaac Stone Fish admitted with regard to his report: "I have no idea what is actually happening inside North Korea".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Black Hole of North Korea|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/09/opinion/09iht-edfish09.html?_r=0|first=Isaac|last=Stone Fish|publisher=''New York Times''|date=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

China officially admitted to the drug problem stemming from North Korea in 2004, with [[Jilin Province]] being the most important transhipment point from North Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/articles/2010/12/03-china-drug-trafficking-zhang|title=Drug Trafficking from North Korea: Implications for Chinese Policy|author=Yong-an Zhang|publisher=Brookings Institution|date=December 3, 2010|accessdate=September 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production, storage, financing, and sale of the North Korea's methamphetamine trade reaches multiple countries from the Philippines, the United States, Hong Kong, Thailand, western Africa and others.&lt;ref name="Insider"/&gt; In 2010, five foreign nationals were prosecuted as part of a conspiracy involving North Korea to smuggle 40 pounds of methamphetamine into the United States and to sell it for $30,000 a pound.&lt;ref name="ForeignPolicy"/&gt;

In 2001, income from illegal drugs amounted to between $500 million and $1 billion.&lt;ref name="Nautilus"/&gt; In a 2013 ''[[Washington Post]]'' article, annual revenues from methamphetamine sales are estimated at $100 million to $200 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/03/22/report-north-korea-ordered-its-foreign-diplomats-to-become-drug-dealers/|title=Report: North Korea ordered its foreign diplomats to become drug dealers|author=Max Fisher|work=Washington Post|date=March 22, 2013|accessdate=September 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1977 and 2003, more than twenty North Korean diplomats, agents, and trade officials have been implicated, detained, or arrested in drug-smuggling operations in more than a dozen countries.&lt;ref name="Nautilus"/&gt; In 2004, two North Korean embassy employees were caught smuggling 150,000 tablets of [[clonazepam]] in Egypt, and in that same year, embassy employees from Bulgaria were arrested in Turkey in possession of over 500,000 tablets of [[Captagon]] (the brand name for the synthetic stimulant fenethylline, or phenethylline), with an estimated street value of $7 million.&lt;ref name=gret /&gt;{{rp|37}} The government of North Korea has only admitted that individuals undertook such acts, and not at the direction of the state.&lt;ref name=gret /&gt;{{rp|17}}

According to the [[Committee for Human Rights in North Korea]], since 2001 drug trafficking operations by diplomats had ceased, with the focus then becoming the production of drugs to be smuggled by other criminal organizations.&lt;ref name=gret /&gt;{{rp|18}}

In 2003, the North Korean owned [[Pong Su]] was intercepted importing heroin into Australia. While four men who had landed pleaded guilty, the ship's four officers were acquitted on all charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Drug ship officers set free |date=6 March 2006 |publisher=News.com.au |url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,10117,18360926-421,00.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215105940/http://www.news.com.au/story/0,10117,18360926-421,00.html |archivedate=15 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Counterfeiting==

===Currency===
{{See also|Superdollar}}
Counterfeiting currency is alleged to have begun in the 1970s under [[Kim Jong-il]]'s direction; however, the notes produced at the time were not of high quality.&lt;ref name="NYTpg4"/&gt; Since then, and within the jurisdiction of [[Room 39]], the North Korean government has counterfeited $50 and $100 United States banknotes using increasingly sophisticated techniques. In 1994, authorities in Hong Kong and Macao apprehended five North Korean diplomats and trade-mission members carrying around $430,000 in bills that turned out to be "[[superdollar]]" (also called "supernote") counterfeits.&lt;ref name="NYTpg5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/23/magazine/23counterfeit.html?pagewanted=5&amp;_r=0|title=No Ordinary Counterfeit|author=Stephen Mihm |publisher=New York Times|date=July 23, 2006|accessdate=April 9, 2014|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been two primary reasons for counterfeiting: the first is to wage economic warfare against the United States,&lt;ref name="NYTpg4"/&gt; and secondly, to help ease North Korea's domestic economic problems.&lt;ref name="NYTpg5"/&gt; According to a report by Dr. Balbina Hwang of [[American University]], North Korea circulated $100 million in counterfeit currency in 2001.&lt;ref name="Nautilus"/&gt; The revenues from this are estimated at between $15 million and $25 million annually.&lt;ref name="CSM"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/2013/1008/New-100-bill-why-North-Korea-won-t-be-very-happy-video|title=New $100 bill: why North Korea won't be very happy|journal=Christian Science Monitor|author=Mike Eckel|date=October 8, 2013|accessdate=April 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the United States released its newly redesigned [[United States one hundred-dollar bill|100 dollar bill]]. The primary purpose of the redesign was to fight against counterfeiting and prevent the recurrence of the "supernotes" which were produced by North Korea.&lt;ref name="CSM"/&gt;

The [[International Convention for the Suppression of Counterfeiting Currency]] is the primary treaty whereby states agree to criminalize acts of currency counterfeiting. North Korea is not a party to the treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://treaties.un.org/pages/LONViewDetails.aspx?src=LON&amp;id=551&amp;chapter=30&amp;lang=en|title=International Convention for the Suppression of Counterfeiting Currency|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=April 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analyst [[Andrei Lankov]] has described the evidence for the counterfeiting of superdollars as merely circumstantial.&lt;ref name="Lankov2016"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lankov|first=Andrei|title=The Real North Korea: Life and Politics in the Failed Stalinist Utopia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FHpYCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA23|year=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-939003-8|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory Elich of the Korea Policy Institute has argued that these allegations are unfounded. According to Elich, North Korea's [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] press from the 1970s would be incapable of printing the supernotes, and the paper and ink would be extremely difficult for North Korea to produce. Furthermore, he says that the amounts of supernotes produced are too small to be economical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=North Korea and the Supernote Enigma|url=http://www.globalresearch.ca/north-korea-and-the-supernote-enigma/8919|first=Gregory|last=Elich|publisher=Global Research|date=7 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Counterfeit legal pharmaceuticals===
There have been a few cases of North Korea being implicated in the production of counterfeit [[Viagra]]. These include: a 2004 arrest in [[Seoul, South Korea]] of a man with 4,000 counterfeit Viagra pills; and a 2005 report from Japan that North Korea was producing fake Viagra pills in factories in [[Chongjin]], which were then sold in Hong Kong to customers of other Southeast-Asian countries (including China), and the Middle East.&lt;ref name=gret /&gt;{{rp|38}} 

===Counterfeit cigarettes===
Counterfeit cigarettes have been a lucrative item for the country. The trade is believed to have begun in the 1990s and greatly increased in 2002 after Chinese authorities shut down many counterfeit operations in China, which then provided added incentive, knowledge, and capacity which could be relocated to North Korea.&lt;ref name=gret /&gt;{{rp|32}} During a 2006 Congressional hearing, Peter A. Prahar of the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]], quoted reports that mentioned the existence of "as many as 12" factories in the DPRK capable of producing "billions of packs of counterfeit cigarettes annually."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-109shrg28241/html/CHRG-109shrg28241.htm|title=- NORTH KOREA: ILLICIT ACTIVITY FUNDING THE REGIME|website=www.gpo.gov|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The factories appear to be owned and operated by the North Korean military.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The major factories for cigarette production were reportedly based in [[Rajin]], though defectors also mentioned a factory in [[Pyongyang]].&lt;ref name=gret /&gt;{{rp|33}}

In 1995, Taiwan stopped a ship and confiscated 20 containers of counterfeit cigarette packaging, which is enough to make 2 million cartons of popular Japanese and British brands.&lt;ref name=gret /&gt;{{rp|32}} In 2004, authorities in Vietnam, Taiwan, the Philippines, and Singapore also impounded containers filled with counterfeit cigarettes.&lt;ref name=gret /&gt;{{rp|33}} Official congressional testimony in 2006 revealed that North Korea-sourced [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro brand]] cigarettes had been identified in 1,300 incidents across the United States.&lt;ref name=gret /&gt;{{rp|35}} Revenues from counterfeit cigarettes are estimated at between $80 million and $160 million a year.&lt;ref name=gret /&gt;{{rp|36}}

==Human trafficking==
{{main|Human trafficking in North Korea}}

North Korea is a "Tier 3" country (those who do not comply with human trafficking laws) as listed by the U.S. Department of State and has retained this ranking since 2007.&lt;ref name="TraffickingReport"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/226847.pdf|title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2014: KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF|publisher=U.S. Department of State|year=2014|pages=231–232|accessdate=September 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The country is a source country of men, women, and children for sex trafficking and forced labor. Forced labor is used both [[Human rights in North Korea#Internment camps for political prisoners|internally]] and externally. Countries which have North Korean forced laborers include Russia, China, Mongolia, and other places in Central Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Middle East.&lt;ref name="TraffickingReport"/&gt;

While the North Korean government claims these are "contract workers", reports claim that they are actually subjected to forced labor, that their movements and communications are subjected to strict surveillance, and that workers sent overseas do not have a choice in the type of work they will be doing nor do they receive pay for their work.&lt;ref name="TraffickingReport"/&gt;

It is estimated that there are thousands of North Koreans working in logging, construction, and agriculture industries in Russia. These workers reportedly only receive two days of rest each year and face punishment if they fail to meet quotas.&lt;ref name="TraffickingReport"/&gt;

North Korea is not a party to the 2000 UN [[Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children|TIP Protocol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://treaties.un.org/pages/viewdetails.aspx?src=ind&amp;mtdsg_no=xviii-12-a&amp;chapter=18&amp;lang=en|title=Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children|publisher=United Nations|date=April 9, 2014|accessdate=September 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arms trade==
During the 1980s, North Korea emerged as a ''legal'' arms trader to primarily [[Third World]] countries, exporting relatively inexpensive, technically unsophisticated, but reliable weapons.&lt;ref name="DIAC3"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://fas.org/irp/dia/product/knfms/knfms_chp3a.html|title=North Korea: The Foundations for Military Strength |chapter= 3A|publisher=Defense Intelligence Agency|date= 1991|accessdate=September 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Iran–Iraq War]], some 90% of arms exports from North Korea went to Iran, and between 1981 and 1989, North Korea earned an estimated $4 billion from arms sales.&lt;ref name="DIAC3"/&gt;

North Korea has a known track record in proliferating nuclear and missile technology and in 2001, missile sales came to $560 million.&lt;ref name="Nautilus"/&gt; Following its [[2006 North Korean nuclear test|2006 nuclear test]], international sanctions have sought to limit or prevent North Korea from exporting various types of arms, materials, and technology.&lt;ref name="HuffPost"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/17/north-korea-weapons-trade_n_3610668.html|title=North Korea's Weapons Trade: A Look At A Global Business|author=Foster Klug|work=Huffington Post|date=July 17, 2013|accessdate=September 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to UN sanctions however, countries such as Japan and the United States took unilateral steps to curb such activities.&lt;ref name="Nautilus"/&gt;

UN sanctions now ban all arms, including small arms and light weapons.&lt;ref name="CRS1874"/&gt;{{rp|14}}
North Korea has developed an extensive and complicated arms trade network in an attempt to circumvent sanctions and uses front companies and embassies to traffic weapons.&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/11/us-korea-korea-un-idUSBREA2A08020140311|title=Front companies, embassies mask North Korean weapons trade |author=James Pearson|newspaper=Reuters|date=March 11, 2014|accessdate=September 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2014 UN report, [[Syria]], [[Myanmar]], [[Eritrea]], [[Tanzania]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Somalia]] and [[Iran]] were all suspected to have bought weapons from North Korea.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt;

===Incidents===
{{As of|2010}}, trade in banned small arms and ammunition was relatively insignificant, with reports include: imports totaling $45,500 by [[Brazil]] in 2007, of $3.1 million by the [[United Arab Emirates]] in 2006, and $364,400 by Ethiopia in 2005, and $121,400 by [[Mexico]] in 2005.&lt;ref name="CRS1874"/&gt;{{rp|14}}

In 2009, three vessels were intercepted which were carrying North Korean weapons. Western and Israeli intelligence officials believed the weapons were destined for [[Hezbollah]] and [[Hamas]].&lt;ref name="CRS1874"/&gt;{{rp|7}}

In December 2009, Thailand intercepted a charter jet from Pyongyang carrying 35 tons of conventional weapons, including [[surface-to-air missiles]].&lt;ref name="HuffPost"/&gt;

In 2012, the United Nations reported that 445 North Korean-made graphite cylinders (which can be used to produce ballistic missiles) were seized from a Chinese freighter at the South Korean port of [[Busan]] on their way to Syria.&lt;ref name="HuffPost"/&gt;

In 2013, a [[North Korean cargo ship seizure in Panama]] (carrying [[Cuba]]n weapons) took place.

In August 2016, US intelligence tracked a ship sailing under a [[Flag of convenience|convenience flag]] of [[Cambodia]], with a North Korean crew sailing from North Korea to [[Egypt]] was found with carrying 24,000 [[rocket-propelled grenades]] and components for another 6,000. It was ordered and paid by a private Egyptian business, but it is believed that it was for the [[Egyptian Army]]. The value of this order and others is estimated at $23 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Warrick|first1=Joby|title=A North Korean ship was seized off Egypt with a huge cache of weapons destined for a surprising buyer|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/a-north-korean-ship-was-seized-off-egypt-with-a-huge-cache-of-weapons-destined-for-a-surprising-buyer/2017/10/01/d9a4e06e-a46d-11e7-b14f-f41773cd5a14_story.html|publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]''|accessdate=25 November 2017|date=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/03/04/un-report-new-light-egypts-role-north-korean-weapons-sales/ | title=UN report to shed new light on Egypt's role in North Korean weapons sales| newspaper=The Telegraph| date=2018-03-04| last1=Ryall| first1=Julian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wildlife trade ==
Over the past three decades, at least 18 North Korean diplomats have been caught smuggling [[rhino horn]] and [[ivory]], though the real number is considered to be much higher.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://globalinitiative.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/TGIATOC-Diplomats-and-Deceipt-DPRK-Report-1868-web.pdf|title=Diplomats and Deceit: North Korea's Criminal Activities in Africa|last=Rademeyer|first=Julian|date=September 2017|website=Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; North Korean defectors have also reported smuggling of rhino horn and ivory from countries like [[Angola]], [[Ethiopia]], and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[South Africa]] and [[Mozambique]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Such illegal activity is considered low-risk but highly rewarding for the regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/5b1ec8a4-9ee1-11e7-9a86-4d5a475ba4c5|title=North Korea said to be revitalising African wildlife trafficking|last=|first=|date=|website=Financial Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Room 39==
{{main|Room 39}}
Room 39 (or Office 39) is the primary government organization that seeks ways to maintain the foreign currency slush fund of North Korea's leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=North Korea's Dollar Store|date=August 5, 2009 |author=David Rose|work=Vanity Fair|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2009/09/office-39-200909|accessdate=September 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Room 39 oversees many of the government's illegal activities (although the military also has its own illegal activity division) such as counterfeiting and drug production. In 2010, the department was reported to have had 17 overseas branches, 100 trading companies and banks under its control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailynk.com/english/read.php?cataId=nk00400&amp;num=6750|title=What Is the No.39 Department?|author=Kim Yong Hun |publisher=DailyNK|date=August 30, 2010|accessdate=September 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2009, the office allegedly had upwards of $5 billion in assets, much of which was spread in banks throughout [[Macau]], [[Hong Kong]], and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kim-jong-un-estimated-5-141825342.html|title=Kim Jong-un Estimated To Have Up To $5 Billion In Secret Overseas Accounts|author=Adam Taylor|publisher=Business Insider|date=March 13, 2013|accessdate=September 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, Yun Tae-hyong, a senior representative of North Korea's ''Korea Daesong Bank'', which is suspected of being under control of Room 39,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/tg962.aspx|title=Treasury Designates Key Nodes of the Illicit Financing Network of North Korea's Office 39|publisher=U.S. Department of the Treasury|date=November 18, 2010|accessdate=September 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; was reported to have defected to Russia taking $5 million with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/north-korean-leaders-money-manager-defects-russia-south-082332404.html|title=North Korean leader's money manager defects in Russia|authors=Ju-min Park and James Pearson|publisher=Reuters|date=August 29, 2014|accessdate=September 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the European Union placed the [[Korea National Insurance Corporation|Korean National Insurance Company]] (KNIC) under sanctions and added that the KNIC had links to Room 39.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/apr/23/uk-freezes-assets-of-north-korean-company-in-south-london-insurance-nuclear-weapons|title=UK freezes assets of North Korean company based in south London|last=Booth|first=Robert|date=2017-04-23|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-04-23|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; The KNIC (which had offices in Hamburg, Germany and London, United Kingdom) was reported to have had assets of UK£787 million in 2014 and had been involved in scamming insurance markets and making investments in property and foreign exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/kim-cooked-up-nuclear-cash-in-the-suburbs-north-korea-znp25pw5k|title=Kim cooked up ‘nuclear cash’ in the suburbs|last=Gadher|first=Dipesh|date=2017-04-23|work=The Sunday Times|access-date=2017-04-23|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|publication-date=|language=en|subscription=Y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/secrets-of-kims-little-house-in-the-suburbs-ksjz9tv65|title=Secrets of Kim’s little house in the suburbs|last=Gadher|first=Dispesh|date=2017-04-23|work=The Sunday Times|access-date=2017-04-23|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en|subscription=Y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politically motivated actions==
As well as illegal money-making ventures, North Korea has been condemned for politically motivated criminal acts related to the long-running [[Korean conflict]].

===Terrorism===
In 1988, North Korea was added to the [[State Sponsors of Terrorism]] list for supplying groups with weapons and for their role in the [[Rangoon bombing]] and the bombing of [[Korean Air Flight 858]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/state-sponsors-of-terrorism/state-sponsors-north-korea/p9364|title=State Sponsors: North Korea|author=Vikaas Sharma|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|date=June 28, 2008|accessdate=September 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 President [[George W. Bush]] agreed to remove North Korea from the list after North Korea met their obligations to provide access to their nuclear program and the resumption of disabling of their nuclear facilities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7665206.stm | work=BBC News | title=N Korea taken off US terror list | date=October 11, 2008 | accessdate=April 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but continued hostilities and the fear that North Korea could sell nuclear weapons to terrorist organizations have called for the nation to be relisted.

In 2017, North Korea was relisted as a terrorist state in response to the murder of [[Kim Jong-nam]], its role in the [[Syrian Civil War]], close relationships with [[Iran]], and it backing Islamic terrorist organizations, especially [[Hamas]].&lt;ref name=NKIL&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-thanks-n-korea-for-its-support-against-israeli-occupation/ | title=Hamas thanks N.

===International abductions===
Between 1977 and 1983, [[North Korean abductions of Japanese citizens|North Korea abducted several Japanese citizens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nettv.gov-online.go.jp/eng/prg/prg1786.html|title=Abduction – An Unforgivable Crime|publisher=Japanese Government Internet TV|date=January 23, 2009|accessdate=September 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; North Korea has admitted to abducting 13 Japanese citizens,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mdn.mainichi-msn.co.jp/international/asia/news/20060413p2g00m0in046000c.html|accessdate=2006-05-01|title=North Korea rejects DNA link to Megumi Yokota abduction case|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Japan lists 17 as having been abducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rachi.go.jp/en/ratimondai/jian.html|title=Individual Cases – 17 Abductees Identified by the Government of Japan|publisher=Japanese Government Headquarters for the Abduction Issue|date=May 2011|accessdate=September 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also testimonies which list nine Europeans as being abducted by North Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/international/2008/04/21/01003-20080421ARTFIG00614-les-captives-etrangeresde-la-coree-du-nord.php|title=Les captives étrangèresde la Corée du Nord|date=21 April 2008|publisher=|via=Le Figaro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Korean War]] North Korea abducted an estimated 82,959 South Koreans, and in the post-war period South Korea claims that a further 489 [[North Korean abductions of South Koreans|South Koreans have been abducted by North Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sukuukai.jp/narkn/|title=North Korean Abduction Victims Worldwide|publisher=National Association for the Rescue of Japanese Kidnapped by North Korea|date=December 2006|accessdate=September 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hacking===
According to cybersecurity experts, North Korea maintains an army of hackers trained to disrupt enemy computer networks and steal both money and sensitive data. In the previous decade, it was blamed for numerous [[cyber-attack]]s and other hacking attacks in South Korea and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/world/asia/north-korea-hack-war-plans.html|title=North Korean Hackers Stole U.S.-South Korean Military Plans, Lawmaker Says|first=Choe|last=Sang-hun|publisher=New York Times|date=10 October 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012061027/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/world/asia/north-korea-hack-war-plans.html|archivedate=12 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Sony Pictures hack]] in 2014, U.S. government officials stated that the North Korean government was "centrally involved" in the hacking.&lt;ref name=nyt-linkedtokorea&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. Links North Korea to Sony Hacking|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/18/world/asia/us-links-north-korea-to-sony-hacking.html?_r=0|accessdate=December 17, 2014|date=December 17, 2014| work = The New York Times | first1 = David E. | last1 = Sanger | first2 = Nicole | last2= Perlroth }}&lt;/ref&gt; White House officials treated the situation as a "serious national security matter",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url =http://news-briefs.ew.com/2014/12/18/white-house-sony-interview-north-korea/ | title =  White House is treating Sony hack as 'serious national security matter' | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = December 18, 2014 | accessdate = December 18, 2014 | first = Ariana | last = Bacle }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) formally stated that they had connected the North Korean government to the cyber-attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/update-on-sony-investigation | title =

On 8 October 2018, [[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]] reported a North Korean hacking group had tried to steal at least $1.1 billion in a series of attacks on global banks from 2014-2018, as uncovered by cybersecurity company [[FireEye]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Onaran|first=Yalman|date=8 October 2018|title=North Korea Hackers Tried to Take $1.1 Billion in Bank Attacks|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-08/north-korea-hackers-broke-into-banks-tried-to-take-1-1-billion |publisher=Bloomberg|access-date=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International responses==
The [[United Nations Security Council]] has passed multiple [[List of United Nations Security Council resolutions concerning North Korea|resolutions against North Korea]] and its weapons program including, [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 825|UNSC Resolution 825]] (May 1993), [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1695|UNSC Resolution 1695]] (July 2006), [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1874|UNSC 1874]] (June 2009), [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 2094|UNSC Resolution 2094]] (March 2013) and most recently,  [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 2371|UNSC Resolution 2371]] (August 2017). Were the international community to fully enforce UNSC 1874, it is estimated that North Korea would lose between $1.5 and $3.7 billion.&lt;ref name="CRS1874"/&gt;{{rp|4}}

Since 1950, the United States has maintained an [[North Korea–United States relations|embargo against North Korea]] for their role in starting the [[Korean War]]. The embargo and related sanctions have been extended to combat North Korea's various illicit activities and continued aggression.

In 2005, under the [[US Patriot Act]] section 311, $25 million of North Korea's cash was frozen at Macau-based [[Banco Delta Asia]], which the US Treasury said North Korea used for illicit activities.&lt;ref name="CRS1874"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/nuke/R40684.pdf|title=North Korea's Second Nuclear Test: Implications of U.N.

In 2010, US President [[Barack Obama]] signed [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] 13551, which "targets North Korea’s importation and exportation of arms, importation of luxury goods, and other illicit activities, including money laundering, the counterfeiting of goods and currency, bulk cash smuggling, and narcotics trafficking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/tg1146.aspx|title=Treasury Designates Financial Institution Involved in Facilitating North Korea's Illicit Activities|publisher=U.S. Department of the Treasury|date=April 19, 2011|accessdate=September 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Self-publishing''' is the publication of media by its [[author]] without the involvement of an established [[Publishing|publisher]]. In common parlance, the term usually refers to physical written media, such as [[Book|books]] and [[Magazine|magazines]], or digital media, such as [[E-book|e-books]] and [[Website|websites]]. It can also apply to [[Album|albums]], pamphlets, brochures, video content, [[Zine|zines]], or uploading images to a website.{{r|twsMiHer4949|twsNYT}} 

Unlike the traditional publishing model, in which control of the publication is shared with a publisher, the author controls the entire process, including design, price, distribution, marketing, and public relations. The author may perform these activities themselves or they may outsource these tasks. In traditional publishing, the publisher bears the costs, such as editing, marketing, and paying advances, and reaps a substantial share of the profits; by comparison, in self-publishing, the author bears all of these costs but earns a higher share of the profit. 

The $1 billion market of self-publishing has changed considerably in the past two decades with new technologies such as the Internet providing increasing alternatives to traditional publishing.{{r|twsFortune147}} Self-publishing is increasingly becoming the first choice for writers.{{r|twsNPR899}} Most self-published books sell very few copies,{{r|twsWP57575}} although there are approximately a dozen books that sell into the millions. The quality of self-published works varies considerably, with many low quality titles on the market.{{r|twsNYT9989}}

==History==
===Early examples===
[[File:George Cruikshank - Tristram Shandy, Plate VIII. The Smoking Batteries.jpg|thumb|right|The original ''[[Tristram Shandy]]'' was self-published by British author Laurence Sterne. Photo: an illustration from the original work by artist [[George Cruikshank]].]]
Self-publishing is not a new phenomenon; after the invention of the [[printing press]] by [[Johannes Gutenberg]] in 1440, numerous books have been self-published.{{R|twsBruno101}} In 1759, British satirist [[Laurence Sterne]]'s self-published the first two volumes of ''[[Tristram Shandy]]''.{{r|patterson}} While most novels were distributed by established publishers, there have been authors who chose to self-publish, or who chose to start their own presses, such as [[John Locke]]{{r|twsCSM2342}}, [[Jane Austen]], [[Emily Dickinson]], [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], [[Martin Luther]], [[Marcel Proust]], [[Derek Walcott]], and [[Walt Whitman]].{{r|patterson}} In 1908, [[Ezra Pound]] sold ''[[A Lume Spento]]'' for six pence each.{{r|patterson}}  [[Franklin Hiram King]]'s book ''Farmers of Forty Centuries'' was self-published in 1911, and was subsequently published commercially. In 1931 the author of ''[[The Joy of Cooking]]'' paid a local printing company to print 3000 copies; the Bobbs-Merrill Company acquired the rights, and since then the book has sold over 18 million copies.{{r|huffpost_books}} In 1941, writer [[Virginia Woolf]] chose to self-publish her final novel ''[[Between the Acts]]'' on her [[Hogarth Press]], in effect starting her own press.{{r|patterson}}

===Vanity presses and negative stigma===
{{Quote|Five years ago, self-publishing was a scar. Now it’s a tattoo.|Greg White, in ''[[Bloomberg News]]'', 2016{{r|twsBloomberg433}}}}
Up until two decades ago, self-publishing used to be described by the negative term [[vanity press|vanity press,]] with the connotation that the only reason that a book was being printed was to satisfy the author’s personal ego.{{R|twsNPR4432}} Authors were considered to have been insufficiently talented to have been published the "proper" way via an established publishing house.{{R|twsNPR4432}} Traditional publishers typically paid authors a percentage of the sales of their books, so publishers would select only those authors whose books they believed were likely to sell well. As a result, it was difficult for an unknown author to get a publishing contract under these circumstances. So-called vanity publishers offered an alternative: they would publish any book in exchange for an upfront payment by the author. With this arrangement, the author would not own the print run of finished books, and would not control how they were distributed. Critics of vanity publishers included [[James D. Macdonald]], who claimed that vanity publishing violated ''Yog’s Law'' which states that "Money should flow toward the author."{{r|twsYogsLaw}} Vanity publishing usually required a one-time payment of $5,000 to $10,000 to do a print run of 1000 books; these books usually ended up in boxes in a garage.{{r|twsNYT9989}}

Self-published books have had a negative stigma. To be sure, self-publishing is sometimes seen as a sign that an author believes in his or her work; for instance, photographer-turned-publisher Max Bondi said that "investing in a project shows that you believe in it".{{R|twsTime101}} Nevertheless, part of the reason for the negative stigma is that many self-published books, particularly in past decades, were of dubious quality. For example, in 1995, a retired TV repairman self-published his autobiography in which he described how he had been stepped on by a horse when he was a boy, how he had been almost murdered by his stepfather when he was a young man in Mexico, and how his ex-wife had clawed his face with her fingernails. The repairman spent $10,000 to have his 150-page masterpiece printed up, and, for promotion purposes, he sent copies to a local library, to the White House, and to everybody with the repairman’s same last name. These efforts did not lead anywhere; today, the book is largely forgotten.{{r|twsNYT4221}}

Even in the first decade of the 21st century, self-publishing was often seen as a "mark of failure",{{r|twsNPR2322}} although there are many indicators that this is changing. The image of self-publishing has been improving, since many well-known writers, who generate high quality content, have first started by self-publishing, or have switched from traditional publishing to self-publishing. According to some views, the stigma of self-publishing is gone entirely,{{r|twsMiHer4949}} while others feel that self-publishing still has a way to go to cultivate respectability.{{r|twsWashPost0909}} Book critic Ron Charles in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' complained in an opinion piece that "No, I don’t want to read your self-published book", citing concerns that there were too many published authors, and that self-published books lacked quality, and were published by authors with little understanding of the audience or the market.{{r|twsWashPost0909}} But the negative stigma has been receding with the advent of dozens of authors who have self-published their way to literary success. Breakaway bestsellers such as ''[[Fifty Shades of Grey]]'' {{r|huffpost_books}} and  ''[[The Martian (Weir novel)|The Martian]]'' were first self-published, helping to lend respectability to self-publishing in general.{{r|Martian22}} Further, with new avenues of self-publishing, there are more opportunities for authors to break through directly to audiences.{{r|twsNYT80009}}

{{Quote|For decades, the literary world dismissed self-published authors as amateurs and hacks who lacked the talent to land a book deal. But that attitude gradually began to change with the rise of e-books and the arrival of Kindle from Amazon, which gave authors direct access to millions of readers.|Alexandra Alter in the ''[[New York Times]]'', 2016{{r|twsNYT80009}}}}

Today what constitutes vanity publishing is not clearly defined. An author who simply uploads a manuscript to an online service like Kindle or Smashwords, and who then expects a bestseller without doing vital marketing and promotion efforts, might be described as doing vanity publishing.{{r|PBS8888}} Increasingly, vanity publishing is defined as a behavior rather than a definition of certain companies or individuals, although there remain a handful of companies that clearly qualify as vanity publishers. These companies offer the cachet of being published and make the majority of their income on fees for intangible services paid for by the author in advance of publication, rather than afterwards from sales revenue.

Accordingly, the line between vanity publishing and traditional publishing has become increasingly blurred in recent years. Currently there are several companies that offer digital and print publication with no upfront cost, although many of them offer fee-based services such as editing, marketing and cover design.

===Technological changes===
[[File:Traditional publishing route before self publishing.jpg|thumb|350px|In previous decades, publishing meant going through agents and publishers.]]
[[File:Chart showing how self publishing allows authors to bypass publishers and sell directly to the public.jpg|thumb|350px|Today, self publishing permits authors to bypass publishers and bookstores and sell directly to the public.]]
A huge impetus to self-publishing has been rapid advances in technology, particularly the exponential growth of the [[Internet]] and a general shift from [[Analogue electronics|analog]] to [[digital technology]].{{r|twsNYT9989}} The Internet has been described as a "great equalizer" in the publishing world, since it enables an author to put their books out there and "stand naked before the world."{{r|twsMiHer4949}} Costs for printing and distributing a book have fallen dramatically.{{r|twsNYT9989}}{{r|twsSFWA101}} Advances in [[E-reader|e-book readers]] and [[tablet computer]]s have improved readability; such devices allow readers to "carry" numerous books in a small portable device.{{r|twsNYT9989}} These technologies make it possible to have a book printed or digitally delivered after an order has been placed, so there are no costs for storing inventory. Print-On-Demand (or POD) technology, which became available in the mid-1990s,{{r|twsSFWA101}} can produce a high quality product equal to those produced by traditional publishers; in the past, one could easily identify a self-published title by its lack of quality.{{r|twsSFWA101}} Print-on-demand was easy, since an author could simply upload a manuscript, choose an interior file format and a cover, and the book could be printed as needed, avoiding warehousing costs, and reducing the risk of being stuck with a huge unsold inventory.{{r|twsSFWA101}} Further, the Internet provides access to global distribution channels via online retailers, so a self-published book can be instantly available to book buyers worldwide. A Canada-based firm named [[Wattpad]] offers streaming video productions based on the stories of self-published authors as of 2017.{{r|twsPW787}}

[[File:Espresso Book Machine at Village Books - Flickr - brewbooks.jpg|thumb|right|An Espresso Book Machine at a bookstore.]]
Internet transmission of digital books was combined with print-on-demand publishing with the invention of the [[Espresso Book Machine]] which was first demonstrated at the [[New York Public Library]] in 2007. This machine prints, collates, covers, and binds a single book. It is in libraries and bookstores throughout the world, and it can make copies of out-of-print editions. Small bookstores sometimes use it to compete with large bookstore chains. It works by taking two Internet-delivered [[Portable Document Format|pdf]] files, one for the text and one for the cover, and then prints an entire paperback book in a matter of minutes, which then drops down a chute.{{r|twsAP}}

Amazon's introduction of the ''Kindle'' and its self-publishing platform, ''Kindle Direct Publishing'' or KDP, in 2007 has been described as a tipping point in self-publishing, which "opened the floodgates".{{r|twsFortune147}} It was an "exclusively electronic self-publishing platform" which was e-book only, free for authors to upload their books, and gave authors control over how their books were priced as well as access to the same distribution channels as major publishers.{{r|twsSFWA101}}

===Self-publishing today===
In recent times the publishing industry as a whole is in a great deal of flux, in a sort of "Wild Wild West" state.{{r|twsNYT9989}} The online retailing giant, [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], has had a huge impact on the book-selling industry, driving many brick-and-mortar bookstores out of business and making inroads into publishing as well. Amazon has enticed readers away from bookstores and into an online environment, and its KDP and CreateSpace distribution channels have spawned a huge growth in self-publishing. As a result, the numbers of self-published authors are ever-increasing.{{r|twsUSAToday143}}

There is an anti-establishment aspect to self-publishing, in that it has been seen historically as a way to defy authority or resist oppression.{{R|twsBruno101}} The self-publishing movement can also be viewed as a part of the [[Do-it-yourself]] culture which "flourishes in environments of communitarian support."{{R|twsBruno101}} A writer who is rejected by the usual system can find solace in self-publishing.{{r|twsNYT9989}} Some struggling authors complained that the traditional publishing model was too "insular", keeping out different ideas about stories as well as ones with unusual characters or plotlines, or which dealt with minorities, and self-publishing was a way for these formerly outcast writers to connect with readers.{{r|twsNYT43432}} Libraries have also become involved with self-publishing; the ''[[Library Journal]]'' and Biblioboard worked together to create a self-publishing platform called Self-e in which authors submit books online which are made available to readers. These books are reviewed by ''Library Journal'', and the best ones are published nationwide; authors do not make money this way but it serves as a marketing tool.{{r|twsBauer}}

The dramatic changes have impacted the standard publishing industry as well, which is controlling a smaller share of the overall publishing market, forcing many traditional publishers to consolidate to reduce costs. The squeeze has been applied to such authors, some of whom have complained that traditional publishers have often asked for the author to contribute part of the start-up expenses personally, in effect deviating from the usual model of the publisher providing all upfront expenses.{{R|twsTime101}}

Self-publishing is still a "difficult and demanding way to go" but is increasingly becoming a respectable, if alternative, choice for a writing career.{{r|twsSFWA101}} Self-publishers who are savvy, motivated and hard-working, can build audiences and make money.{{r|twsSFWA101}}

===Controversies and problem areas===
[[File:Chart showing the traditional publishing process with filters screening out books.jpg|thumb|350px|A few decades ago, in order for a book to reach the public, it had to pass successfully through various filters or screens, such as agents and publishers and bookstores, and be approved.]]
[[File:Self publishing allows an author to bypass the 'filter' of established agents and publishers.jpg|thumb|350px|Today authors can bypass established agents and publishers (the filters) and bring their creations directly to book buyers.]]
In the traditional publishing model, editors and publishers act as a filter or screen, weeding out possibly radical or badly written or substandard content. In contrast, self-publishing enables authors to bypass this filter and sell their books directly to the public. The wide-open uncensored nature of self-publishing has caused problems and controversies with pornographic or abuse-themed content. Amazon has a policy against selling content relating to rape and incest and bestiality which states "We don't accept pornographic or offensive depictions of graphic sexual acts", but it is sometimes difficult for book distributors to distinguish what type of content is acceptable and what is not.{{r|twsCSM2342}} Some retailers have had to remove problematic content.{{r|twsCSM2342}} A survey found that self-published [[erotica]] was more extreme among self-published books than mainstream books. Erotica is about 1% of the mainstream market but 29% of the self-published market, according to one informal survey in 2013.{{r|twsLATimes42225}}

There have been some controversial self-published books, such as that of a man who posted a photo of his dead wife, whom he had murdered.{{r|twsLAT8332}} Celebrity [[Kim Kardashian]] self-published a 445-page book which consisted entirely of [[selfie]]s, a book described in ''[[Slate magazine]]'' as having "no literary ambitions at all – it barely has words."{{r|twsSlate898}}

While editors at a traditional publisher would often insist on fact-checking, and doing [[due diligence]] regarding claims made by an author, there are no requirements in the self-publishing model for this to happen. Self-publishing has attracted political provocateurs such as [[Milo Yiannopoulos]] who was able to publish his tome ''Dangerous'' on Amazon despite being dumped by traditional publisher [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] as well as [[Breitbart]] after a video surfaced of him condoning [[pedophilia]].{{r|twsSlatemag1}}

As a check on self-published content, and as part of its overall strategy of empowering consumers by giving more information, Amazon permits reviews of its products, including books that it sells. However, it is possible for self-published authors to ''game'' the Amazon review system to make their books appear better than they are, perhaps by encouraging large numbers of five-star reviews by paying anonymous reviewers to write fake laudatory comments.{{r|twsQuartz101}} According to one view, the system is at serious risk of fraud and deception.{{r|twsQuartz101}} Amazon has responded by emphasizing reviews in which the book purchase is verified, and it has fought back by, in some cases, suing people and service firms who sell fake reviews.{{r|twsQuartz101}}

A problem for some successful self-published authors is [[plagiarism]]. It is relatively easy for a manuscript to be copied and changed in superficial ways, but changed sufficiently so that it is hard for plagiarism-detecting software to catch the similarities between the real book and the plagiarized copy; then the copy can be uploaded online under a new title and different author name, which can earn royalties for the plagiarist.{{r|twsAtlanticPlag}} For example, author Rachel Ann Nunes, who wrote ''A Bid for Love'' in 1998, found that her manuscript had been plagiarized, with a nearly identical book entitled ''The Auction Deal''. Nunes hired a lawyer to track down the plagiarists.{{r|twsAtlanticPlag}} In the previous publisher-dominated system, a publisher would have been liable for selling a plagiarized book, but in the world of self-publishing, there are no liabilities involved if Amazon removes the plagiarized titles. It is often difficult to catch and prosecute the plagiarists, who can masquerade using false identities.{{r|twsAtlanticPlag}}

The publishing industry, including self-publishing, is changing so rapidly that it is hard to make accurate predictions about where it is headed. It is likely that self-publishing will continue to grow, and that authors will demand more and more data about their readers as well as how well their books are selling.{{r|twsPW787|twsWSJ438337}} Self-publishing is growing in marketing sophistication and ambition, according to one view.{{r|twsNYT80009}}

Regarding the e-book market, there are predictions that independent authors will be grabbing an increasing slice of this market. Traditional publishers are losing ground in the e-book market, according to several sources. E-books published by traditional publishers declined by 11% from 2015 to 2016.{{r|twsNYT80009}} The drop in e-book sales was really more of a phenomenon in which established publishers were raising the prices of their e-books, and saw a relative decline in sales compared to their print offerings.{{r|twsFortune484733}} In contrast, sales of self-published e-books have been increasing.{{r|twsFortune484733}} An increasing number of e-books are being read on tablets as opposed to dedicated E-book readers.{{r|twsChicTrib00303}} One forecast was that digital sales would continue to increase over time, and paper-based publishing would become a "niche market" like with newspapers and magazines.{{r|twsFortune484733}}

A report in 2017 suggested that Amazon was working on a system to transform foreign language fiction into English with its [[AmazonCrossing]] service.{{r|twsDFP121}} Amazon accounted for 10% of all translated foreign fiction books, according to one report.{{r|twsDFP121}}

==Main routes to self-publishing==
There are an increasing variety of resources for authors choosing the self-publishing route.{{R|twsNPR4432}}

===Basic pathways to publishing===
Publishing guru [[Jane Friedman]] breaks out the publishing routes for authors into basic categories:

* '''Traditional publishing'''. Authors don’t pay any publishing-related expenses.{{r|twsJFriedman787}} Large well-established publishing firms include the so-called ‘Big Five’: Penguin Random House, HarperCollins, Hachette, Simon &amp; Schuster, and Macmillan, including their dozens of imprints. These large publishers prefer authors with mainstream appeal, particularly celebrity or "brand-name" authors, and they bear most of the risk associated with publishing. They typically offer an advance payment, and sometimes authors can get a slice of the book profits. Publishers own the rights and control most aspects of publication, especially the design of the cover and the choice of a title.{{r|twsJFriedman787}} They can get books into brick-and-mortar bookstores and get reviews in mainstream media. Mid-size traditional publishers are smaller than the Big Five but usually offer the same arrangements. Small and indie presses are harder to categorize but can vary from well-established boutique presses to mom-and-pop start-ups with little experience, and they are more accepting of first-time authors and usually don’t require an agent to be approached. Authors probably won’t get an advance but may get a larger share of the profits instead. It is harder for smaller presses to get books into bookstores.{{r|twsJFriedman787}}
* '''Hybrid publishers'''. There are intermediate arrangements between traditional and self-publishing in which both author and publisher bear some of the costs of development, sometimes called "cooperative publishing".{{r|twsRMag1}} In some of these models, a hybrid publisher may offer selected services to help an author get a book published, such as story editing, copy editing, proofreading, and marketing and public relations such as promotion through [[social media]] and [[search engine optimization]] strategies.{{r|twsNYT9989}} Many such firms have their own online bookstores.{{r|twsNYT9989}} It is important for authors considering a hybrid approach to fully understand what services will be included, and at what cost, and to fully understand the terms of any contract. Some intermediary firms offer less-than-ideal contracts, which make it hard for an author to get out of the deal at a later time, and can take a disproportionate share of profits; one adviser suggests it’s "buyer beware" when hiring such firms.{{r|twsNYT9989}} With this model, the author funds the publication of the book, sometimes spending thousands of dollars, to get the know-how and editing skills of the publisher.{{r|twsJFriedman787}} Quality of services and the terms of contracts vary widely. Some professionals who used to work in the traditional publishing industry work in hybrid firms. Royalties are less than true self-publishing but more than traditional publishing. Books rarely get into bookstores. Authors should understand the terms fully and try to keep as many rights with as much flexibility as possible. Some firms are nothing more than funky assisted-publishing services which are overcharging.{{r|twsJFriedman787}}
* '''Assisted self-publishing'''. These firms charge fees for various publishing-related services such as formatting and cover design and copyediting, and make their money from these services alone, but authors earn all of the royalties and retain control over editing and cover design and title. Firms that offer help with publicity and marketing are generally not a good deal, and firms that have pushy sales tactics such as AuthorSolutions should be avoided.{{r|twsJFriedman787}} There are books such as Mark Levine’s ''The Fine Print of Self-Publishing'', which can guide would-be authors.{{r|twsNYT9989}} For authors who are serious about making money through self-publishing, it is vital to have quality artwork, particularly on the cover, as well as interior formatting, and professionals doing publicity work, so hiring competent freelancers is not really optional.{{r|twsSFWA101}}
* '''True self-publishing.''' The author controls the entire publishing process from start to finish, and can hire freelancers to help wherever it is needed, such as cover designers and copy editors and story editors. It is necessary for the author to think like an entrepreneur and take charge of all variables, and as much as possible, get the finished book to look like a quality product. All profits and rights stay with the author but it is nearly impossible to get the book into bookstores unless it becomes a breakout bestseller, which is highly unlikely. Authors can sell their e-books through Amazon’s KDP, Apple’s iBookstore, Kobo, and Nook Press, and can distribute them through e-book distributors such as Pronoun, Draft2Digital and Smashwords. Popular print-on-demand firms include Amazon’s CreateSpace and IngramSpark.{{r|twsJFriedman787}}

===Process of self-publishing: from concept to manuscript===

The author as a self-publisher also takes on many of the creative tasks to complete the finished works, which include creative writing as well as selecting the writing software, editing, marketing, and cover design. While self-publishing means that the author is in ''control'' of the entire process of production, from writing and editing, to layout to distribution, and to choosing publishing platforms and selecting marketing variables such as the price, many of these tasks can be outsourced to professionals. Professionals can be located through search engines, freelancing websites such as Reedsy,{{r|Reedsy43}} word of mouth, identifying and contacting creative assistants who have worked on already-published books, and searching relevant forums. Authors can spend up to $5000 for a variety of services to assist with publishing.{{r|twsNYT9989}}

There is strong agreement that self-published authors fare better if they are able to employ a skilled editor, preferably one with a financial interest in the success of the book, and who can bring a savvy understanding of the market as well as a strong sense of story development.{{r|twsUSAToday4435}} Self-published author James Altucher describes working with an editor:

{{Quote|Nils and I went back and forth on more than 15 different rewrites for my book. The difference between the original version and the final version is like the difference between chicken shit and chicken salad.|Self-published author James Altucher in 2013{{r|twsTechCrunch4221}}}}

A liability for self-published authors is that if they can find a skilled editor, he or she is still being ''paid'' by the author for upfront editing work, and may not care whether the book is successful or not. A big advantage for working with a traditional publishing arrangement is having an editor and publisher who have a financial interest in making the book a bestseller.

A self-published author is responsible for the technical aspects of self-publishing, which include formatting for printing and digital conversion.{{r|PBS11181}} Formatting can be complex and time-consuming but patient people can learn how to do it by themselves, but often hire this task out to experienced freelancers.{{r|twsNYT9989}}

Unless a book is to be sold directly from the author to the public, an International Standard Book Number or [[ISBN]] is required to uniquely identify the title. ISBN is a global standard used for all titles worldwide.{{r|ISBN494}} Most self-publishing companies either provide their own ISBN to a title or can provide direction about how to get one.{{r|ISBN494}} A separate ISBN number is needed for each edition of the book.{{r|PBS2322}} It may be in the best interest of the self-published author to retain ownership of the ISBN and copyright instead of using a number owned by a vanity press.

The direction of the marketing and promotion effort is the responsibility of the author. Self-published authors can negotiate to have [[audiobook]]s made.{{r|twsNYT80009}}

===Publishing platforms===
The dominant self-publishing platform is Amazon which controls the vast share of the market, but there are numerous competitors and platforms in which authors can upload and sell their books.

====Kindle Direct Publishing====
[[File:Amazon Kindle 3.JPG|thumb|right|An Amazon Kindle.]]
[[Kindle Direct Publishing]] or KDP is Amazon’s e-book publishing unit which was launched when the company began selling its [[Amazon Kindle]] book reading device in 2007.{{r|twsSFWA101}} Books can be published in numerous languages.{{r|twsMiamiHerald324}} Amazon’s KDP has hundreds of thousands of self-published titles.{{r|twsUSAToday143}} Amazon’s KDP program uses ASIN identifiers instead of ISBNs to identify e-books.{{r|twsPW4342}} Amazon does not release sales figures of its authors.{{r|twsNPR2322}} Many authors prefer Amazon for its global clout and reach.{{R|twsNPR4432}} One analysis suggested that Amazon earned $2.3 billion from e-book revenues in 2016, and 25% of these were from self-published e-books; and Amazon released 4 million e-book titles in 2016, and 40% of them were self-published.{{r|twsFortune147}} Another estimate was that Amazon controls 70% of the e-book market.{{r|twsJFriedman88}}

Amazon's ''Kindle Unlimited'' service lets readers read any books in its catalog, provided that the users pay a monthly fee. Amazon tracks which books are selected and read by subscribers. An author who wants to have their book included in this program enters into Amazon’s ''KDP Select'' program, and as part of the agreement, the author promises to make their book exclusive to Amazon. The author can opt out of the KDP program every ninety days. An estimate in 2017 was that of Amazon's Kindle Unlimited market, about 60% of the books read and borrowed were self-published.{{r|twsJFriedman88}} Amazon initially began the program by paying authors whenever their book was chosen, but then it switched to an arrangement in which it pays authors based on pages read. Each month, Amazon establishes a fund from which to pay authors, based on Amazon’s accounting of which pages are read. Amazon has been criticized for short-changing authors by paying them out of this monthly fund.{{r|twsQuartz101}} As a result of the program, many Amazon authors found that their income decreased substantially when the company switched to the pages-read basis.{{r|twsQuartz101}} The collective fund for KDP authors in August 2017 was $19.4 million which was the "largest ever" of the monthly funds, but overall authors received the lowest amount, which was $0.00419 per page for that month.{{r|twsQuartz101|twsGuardian494933}} Some authors tried to compensate for less income by slightly altering and republishing their work, to try to increase the total of pages read.{{r|twsQuartz101}} The change to the pages-read model was criticized as being a "huge pay cut" for authors.{{r|twsChicTrib101}} None of the big 5 publishers contributed books to Kindle Unlimited as of 2017.{{r|twsChicTrib101}}

====IngramSpark====

IngramSpark lets authors to publish digital and paperback editions of their books. It distributes books to most online bookstores. Brick-and-mortar stores can also order books from IngramSpark at wholesales prices for sale in their own venues. It is run by [[Ingram Content Group]].

====Apple====
[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] sells books via its [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] which is a digital distribution platform for its [[mobile app]]s on its [[iOS]] operating system. Apps can be downloaded to its devices such as the [[iPhone]], the [[iPod Touch]] handheld computer, and the [[iPad]]. Apple pays authors 70% of its proceeds at its Apple iBookstore where it sells [[iBooks]].{{r|twsNYT9989}}

====Smashwords====
[[Smashwords]] is a California-based company founded by Mark Coker which allows authors and independent publishers to upload their manuscripts electronically to the Smashwords service, which then converts them into multiple e-book formats which can be read on various devices. Authors control what price is set.{{r|twsMiamiHerald324}}

====Barnes &amp; Noble====
[[Barnes &amp; Noble]] pays 65% of the list price of e-books purchased through its online store called Pubit.{{r|twsNYT9989|twsMiamiHerald324}}

====Kobo====
[[Kobo Inc.|Kobo]] is a Canadian company which sells e-books, audiobooks, e-readers and tablet computers which originated as a cloud e-reading service.{{r|twsNYT9989}}

====Scribd====
[[Scribd]] is an open publishing platform which features a digital library, an e-book and audiobook subscription service.{{r|twsNYT9989}} It began as an online sharing site for books, and evolved into a store; books published there entitle an author to 80% of the sales price.{{r|twsNYT9989}}

====Lulu====
[[Lulu (company)|Lulu]] is an online print-on-demand, self-publishing and distribution platform.{{r|twsMiamiHerald324}}

===Print-on-Demand===
{{Main|Print-on-demand}}
Print-on-demand (or POD) publishing refers to the ability to print high-quality books as needed. This is usually the most economical option for self-publishers who expect sales to be sporadic over time. An alternative is to hire a printing press to do a print run in which a large number of books are printed at one time, such as a hundred or a thousand copies, which can result in a slightly lower per-book printing cost, but risks holding onto unsold inventory for an extended period of time. Print-on-demand means that a book is printed only after it is purchased, lessening the risk, which eliminates the need for expensive warehouse space.{{r|twsNYT9989}} Many companies, such as Amazon’s Createspace, [[Outskirts Press]], IngramSpark, [[Blurb, Inc.|Blurb]], [[Lulu (company)|Lulu]], [[Llumina Press]], and [[iUniverse]] allow single books to be printed at per-book costs which are not much higher than those paid by publishing companies for large print runs.{{r|NYT123454|twsSFWA101}} Ingram is the largest book distributor, and it can help self-published authors get access to 39,000 bookstores, according to one report.{{r|twsFortune147}} The physical quality of print-on-demand self-published books is generally the same as that from an established publisher, although quality can in some instances vary.{{r|twsSFWA101}}

===E-books===
[[File:Amazon Books at U Village, Seattle (22955160585).jpg|thumb|right|The online retailer [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] is transforming the publishing industry.]]
{{Main|E-book}}
Generally self-publishing works best with e-books because, unlike print-on-demand self-publishing, it solves the twin problems of price and distribution.{{r|twsSFWA101}} There are a variety of e-book formats and tools that can be used to create them. Because it is possible to create e-books with no up-front or per-book costs, this is a popular option for self-publishers.{{r|PBS00998}} E-book publishing platforms include [[Pronoun (publishing platform)|Pronoun]], [[Smashwords]], Blurb, Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing, CinnamonTeal Publishing, Papyrus Editor, Ebook Leap, Bookbaby, Pubit, [[Lulu (company)|Lulu]], [[Llumina Press]], and CreateSpace.{{r|PBS00998|twsNPR4432}} When a person buys an E-book, the buyer does not ''own'' the book, but owns a license only to read the book.{{r|twsChicTrib00303}} Formatting standards for e-books continue to evolve; at present, there have been compatibility problems with some digital e-book readers. For example, a recent [[EPUB]] 3.1 e-book format is not compatible with earlier e-book readers such as the Kindle.{{r|twsChicTrib00303}} E-book formats include EPUB, MOBI and PDF, among others. In 2017, there was a report in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' that e-books sales are continuing to increase.{{r|twsChicTrib00303}} Epublishing distributors allow an author to sell on multiple platforms, often providing conversion and formatting services, usually charge no fees upfront, and make money by taking a small percentage of each book sold.{{r|twsSFWA101}}

===Vanity press===
{{Main|Vanity press}}
Users pay to have their books published. While a commercial publisher’s market is the book-buying public at large, the vanity publisher’s market is the author himself or herself. Some authors buy substantial copies of their own book which are then used as giveaways or promotional tools. The term ''vanity press'' is considered pejorative since it suggests that a person who hires such a service is unqualified or unable to have their book succeed in the market, and that the author is printing the book only out of [[vanity]]. In this business model, there can be elements of fraud, such that some vanity presses masquerade as legitimate publishers, and pretend to be selective and choosy in their book selections, and prey upon a would-be author’s desire to be published. If a vanity press charges a higher amount to print a run of books than a regular [[Printer (publishing)|printer]], it can be an indication of deception and fraud.

===Specific firms===
There are numerous firms offering publishing assistance, and they include Aventine Press, Self Publishing Inc., Hillcrest Media, iUniverse, Xlibris, and AuthorHouse.{{r|twsNYT9989}} The parent company of AuthorHouse and iUniverse is [[Author Solutions]] based in Bloomington, Indiana.

==The self-publishing market==
* '''Overall publishing market is expanding.''' Since 2000, there has been an increase in the sales of digital titles, audiobooks, self-published paperbacks,{{r|twsBB484829}} including printed as well as e-books. The overall market for all books, including from traditional publishers, is growing as well.
* '''Explosive growth of new titles.''' The growth in new titles has been strong, particularly in the past decade. In 2002, there were a quarter million new titles, but since 2009, the number of new titles has topped 1.3 million each year.{{r|twsChicTrib101}} In 2010, according to a different analysis, there were 4.2 million new titles published.{{r|twsChicTrib101}} Much of the growth in new titles has been because of self-publishing. In 2011, self-published books made up 43% of all print titles, helping to increase overall growth of print production, according to Bowker market research.{{r|twsCSM48482}} In the middle of the second decade, the growth of print titles seemed to ebb somewhat, perhaps eclipsed by the growth of e-book titles. For instance, from 2014 to 2015, print titles grew by 34%; from 2015 to 2016, print titles grew but more slowly by 11%.{{r|twsRI1010}} That is the growth of new ''titles''; book sales increased as well, growing by 3% in 2016.{{r|twsBloomberg47471}} In 2017, there were reports that sales of physical books were increasing in the United States.{{r|twsBB484829}}
* '''Strong growth in self-publishing.''' There has been a "dizzying rise in self-publishing," according to one view.{{r|twsChicTrib101}} Self-published book titles in production tripled from 2006 to 2012.{{r|twsCSM48482}} 2008 was a watershed year; for the first time in history, more books were self-published than those published traditionally.{{r|twsForbes11121}} In 2009, 76% of all books released were self-published, while publishing houses reduced the number of books they produced.{{r|Jim Milliot}} Back in 2008, there were 85,468 self-published titles;{{r|twsBaltSun543}} in 2011, 247,210; by 2012, 459,000; by 2013, 458,564;{{r|twsBaltSun543|twsPW787}} by 2017, 786,935 self-published ISBNs.{{r|twsRI1010|twsChicTrib101|twsUSAToday143}} During a period of six years, growth of self-published titles was a remarkable 218%.{{r|twsRI1010|twsChicTrib101}} These numbers don’t count titles published by Amazon’s KDP which identifies books by ASIN numbers instead of ISBN numbers. These are worldwide figures, but the numbers are strong for particular markets as well; for example, in the United Kingdom, readers bought 18 million self-published books in 2013, a 79% increase from the year before.{{r|twsInsideHireEd}} The numbers are strong for particular platforms too; for instance, in 2012, of books sold by Amazon’s Kindle KDP service, a quarter of those sales were self-published.{{r|twsInsideHireEd}}

* '''A saturated market of mostly junky titles.''' The self-publishing ecosystem has become flooded with titles.{{r|twsNYT80009}} While self-publishing overall is booming, most new titles are poorly written or confused or otherwise lacking in appeal. There are a few dozen self-published books that are winning most of the sales, so for the others, even quality self-published books seeking to get attention, it is increasingly difficult to be noticed. Of profits paid to authors by Smashwords, the best-selling 1% of titles earn half of all sales money.{{r|twsUSAToday143}} Some authors earn modest profits from their work. For example, writer Wayne Hicks of Arkansas published five titles, spending $700 on editing and marketing services, and spent a thousand hours creating and promoting his books; he’s sold a thousand copies for a profit of $1,400.{{r|twsUSAToday143}} Kate Lippa of Maine made $1,600 selling her books.{{r|twsUSAToday143}}

{{Quote|The largest, by far, percentage of authors are making less than $500 a year self-publishing, because there’s a glut. There’s over 350,000 books being self-published every year and readers are not finding them. There’s just no way to expose people to all of these books.|Novelist M.J.

[[File:Share of e-book market in 2017 by major publishing platforms.jpg|thumb|Amazon.com owns about 70% of the e-book market, according to publishing guru [[Jane Friedman]], citing statistics from Michael Cader of Publishers Marketplace, in September 2017.{{r|twsJFriedman88}}]]
* '''E-books expanding.''' E-books are a relatively new technology, and growth in the number of e-book titles as well as sales have been strong since the middle of the first decade. In 2011 and 2012 the size of the market, in terms of trade publisher e-book revenues, was $2 billion, about 16% of the total trade industry.{{r|twsMiamiHerald324}} Monthly e-book sales increased 49% from 2011 to 2012.{{r|twsMiamiHerald324}} On another measure, based on statistics from Smashwords, the service had only 140 e-books published in 2008; by 2016, it had published 98,000 e-books. In another measure, from the six-year period from 2011 to 2017, e-book sales on Smashwords tripled.{{r|twsNPR899}} In the e-book market on Amazon, self-published titles were estimated at about 40% of unit sales, while e-books by traditional publishers captured about 80% of total dollars, because of higher prices.{{r|twsJFriedman88}} Several reports indicated that e-book readership and sales among major publishers had "hit a speed bump" around the middle of the second decade, from the years 2014 to 2016.{{r|twsChicTrib00303|twsBloomberg47471|twsBB484829}} A 2017 survey of 1200 publishing companies found that the market for e-books had declined from 22% to 18%, although the survey did not count self-published e-books or books published through a single retailer such as Amazon.{{r|twsChicTrib00303}} From 2015 to 2016, e-books declined in terms of title registrations by −3%.{{r|twsRI1010}} Most likely the decrease was the result of major publishing companies raising the prices of e-books on average from $6 to $10, which had the effect of dampening demand.{{r|twsChicTrib00303}} The "Big 5" traditional publishers include Hachette, HarperCollins, Macmillan, Simon &amp; Schuster, and Penguin Random House. These firms have 37% of the overall book market in 2017, but only 26% of the E-book market.{{r|twsChicTrib00303|twsWSJ438337}} Hachette CEO Michael Pietsch said that one of the reasons for an e-book slowdown was that readers continue to love the physical form of printed books, and that the physical book format is "hard to improve on".{{r|twsWSJ438337}} However e-books as a format offer numerous benefits, such as the ability to resize text, to click on a word to learn its definition, to scroll, to hunt for specific words, and so forth, that it is likely that e-books will continue to become more popular.

[[File:Harper-Collins Offices - geograph.org.uk - 57811.jpg|thumb|right|Offices of HarperCollins in the U.K.]]
* '''Traditional publishing is losing share.''' There are major shifts in the publishing market as a whole, with sales by "indie publishers", which includes self-publishers, surpassing the "big five" which includes Hachette, HarperCollins, Macmillan, Simon &amp; Schuster, and Penguin Random House.{{r|twsChicTrib00303}}
* '''More crossover activity'''. As self-publishing loses its stigma and its benefits via technology become more apparent, there are more instances  in which new authors choose self-publishing as their primary route,{{r|twsBaltSun543}} as well as established authors leaving traditional publishers and self-publishing their titles. There are greater instances of self-published authors selling their books in major retailers such as Barnes &amp; Noble, Target, and Walmart.{{r|twsNYT80009}}
* '''Rapid growth in all-you-can-read subscriptions.'''{{r|twsChicTrib101}}
* '''Proliferation of devices which can read e-books.''' These include smartphones and tablets and laptop computers. As a corollary, the number of people using single-purpose dedicated e-book reading devices, such as Amazon Kindles, declined from 30% of all adults in 2013 to 19% in 2015.{{r|twsChicTrib00303}}
* '''Prices being pushed down.''' Digital piracy, proliferation of titles, and lower-priced e-books means that there is downward pressure on prices affecting the entire publishing industry, although the market as a whole is growing.

* '''Changing patterns of readership.''' There are some people who don’t buy or read books, and a few studies suggest that the buying of books as well as readership are declining for some people. In 2010, according to one report, 9% of Americans didn’t read a book, and this increased to 16% for 2013.{{r|twsChicTrib101}} The same report chronicled a decline in the percentage of American book buyers, from 21% who didn’t buy a book in 2010, to 35% who didn’t buy one in 2013.{{r|twsChicTrib101|twsBloomberg47471}} In 2016, 72% had never read an e-book.{{r|twsBloomberg47471}} A study in 2017 found that students were better able to assimilate information when it was read from printed textbooks, rather than online, although reading online was usually faster than print, and students thought, mistakenly, that they learned better by reading online.{{r|twsBI888}}
* '''Self-publishing is dominated by Amazon.''' Amazon commanded 70% of the self-publishing market in 2014.{{r|twsMiHer4949|twsRI1010}} There are competitors such as Smashwords and others but the lion’s share of the market is owned by Amazon. An estimate in 2017 was that Amazon had four million books for sale in its Kindle store.{{r|twsNYT80009}} A report concluded that amazon is the big leader in the e-book and e-book reader market, owning 80% of the English-language market.{{r|twsChicTrib00303}} Amazon has not gotten along with traditional bookstores, many of whom refuse to stock Amazon titles.{{r|twsDFP121}}

[[File:Desire On Top by Adam Fenton - Raven Book RB707 1963.jpg|thumb|right|Self-publishing seems to have better chances of success with book genres such as romance, science-fiction, mysteries, thrillers, and erotica.]]
* '''Self-publishing seems better suited for certain genres.''' Genres that do well for self-publishing include romance, erotica, mysteries, thrillers, and science fiction, in the sense that self-published books in these genres tend to have a more favorable chance of finding success.{{r|twsWP57575|twsChicTrib101|twsMiHer4949|CNET111}} A survey in 2014 found that self-publishers made the most money in the genres of romance and science fiction/fantasy.{{r|twsSFWA101}} In the past, traditional publishers underestimated the market for [[erotica]] in which many self-publishers have focused.{{r|twsWSJ438337}} Alisha Rai’s erotic novel ''Serving Pleasures'', published through CreateSpace, appeared on the bestseller list of the ''[[Washington Post]]''.{{r|twsWP57575}} Genres which do not do well for self-publishers include cookbooks, nonfiction and academic publishing.{{r|twsChicTrib101}} Generally academics have steered clear of self-publishing, as the market is dominated by university presses and academic journals which publish slowly, don’t pay much, and subject content to strict [[peer review]]s.{{r|twsInsideHireEd}} There are reports that some scholars are frustrated with the state of academic publishing, and while most still choose the traditional publishing route, there are some who have chosen to start their own journals or independent presses, or who have expanded into blogging.{{r|twsInsideHireEd}}

==Promoting a self-published book==
[[File:Barnes &amp; Noble Interior.JPG|thumb|right|Getting a self-published book into bookstores like this Barnes &amp; Noble is difficult, although there are signs that this may be changing.]]
There is wide consensus that since the market is flooded with titles, the most difficult task facing self-published authors is attracting attention to their book.{{r|twsNYT9989}} Some authors have tried unconventional methods to cut through the clutter. For example, self-published author James Altucher offers to pay readers if they can prove they bought and read his book; he explained that people are more likely to value what they pay for, and this offer entices them to actually read his book.{{r|twsTechCrunch4221}} While he takes a small loss each time a reader accepts his offer, overall he feels it promotes sales.{{r|twsTechCrunch4221}} Experimentation helps. One strategist suggested that an author should have a creative marketing campaign and try one tactic each day, while studying those tactics undertaken by successful self-publishers.{{r|twsNYT9989}} One author spends roughly $70,000 annually creating and promoting her books, and hires a dozen freelancers for various parts of her operation.{{r|twsUSAToday143}} Another self-published author gave 80 books to friends, who told their friends, to generate positive publicity.{{r|twsMiHer4949}} A strategy that helps many self-published authors is to write a series, making the first installment free, and charging for subsequent versions.{{r|twsSFWA101}}

Authors have tried numerous approaches to promoting and marketing their books, including...

* '''Building a web presence'''{{r|PW11911}}
* '''Building a mailing list'''{{r|PW11911}}
* '''Promoting e-books through targeted giveaways'''{{r|PW11911}}
* '''Offering a limited edition print book'''{{r|twsTime101}}
* '''Promoting books through [[social media]]'''{{r|twsUSAToday143}}

* '''Donating paperback copies to libraries'''{{r|twsPW787}}
* '''Getting books into local bookstores'''{{r|twsPW787}}

Most book contests are open only to books published by established publishers, but there are a few contests open to self-published writers. One is the Illinois Library Association, in conjunction with BiblioBoards and with Reaching Across Illinois Library System, which sponsored a prize for best self-published novel; the contest is open to Illinois-based self-published writers.{{r|twsChicTribBerk1|twsChicTrib89667}} The British newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'', in conjunction with selected publishers, has a ''Self published book of the month'' award, which began in 2014; entries are submitted digitally and must be in the English language, and the contest is open only to residents of the [[United Kingdom]].{{r|twsGuardian46980}}

==Who is self-publishing?==
Many writers are self-publishing. One reason for the expansion of self-publishing is that with the ease of technology, and declining costs and rapid time frame to publication, new opportunities have opened up for people to publish. The motivations of self-published writers are many, and include building a career as a writer and satisfying an ambition, along with money, which isn’t usually the top reason.{{r|twsUSAToday143}} Advice for aspiring writers who are considering self-publishing includes understanding one’s own goals, make sure your book is 100% ready with no mistakes before releasing it, seeking help for parts of the development process where it is needed, having fun, and promoting books through [[social media]].{{r|twsUSAToday143}} Successful self-publishing requires an entrepreneurial mindset, and is a lot of hard work.{{r|twsSFWA101}}

Many retirees are self-publishing the story of their life, to leave as a legacy to their offspring after they’re gone.{{r|twsMercNews9393}} Sometimes adults help write and edit the book for their parent; for example, Arthur Chiang helped his mother describe her life as an immigrant, adding photos, and helping with the technical aspects of preparing the manuscript for publication.{{r|twsMercNews9393}} There have been instances in which parents, to give their teenaged children experience with writing and to involve them in fun projects, acted as "publishers" for their children, paying some of the costs to have their offspring self-published.{{r|twsNYT9897}} Eleven-year-old [[John Ruskin]] sold a book of poetry he self-published with his father.{{r|patterson}} Author Brooks Olsen chose Amazon after writing her self-published book, which was edited in part by her parents, with a cover design from her boyfriend, saying she liked having Amazon’s clout behind her.{{R|twsNPR4432}}

==Self-publishing success stories==
[[File:Shades of Grey - Geheimes Verlangen (E. L. James, 2012).jpg|thumb|right|The self-published book ''Fifty Shades of Grey'' became a bestseller and was picked up by a major publisher, and translated into many languages, including German.]]

==Traditional versus self-publishing==
Traditional publishers can offer editorial guidance, marketing muscle, and access to well-established channels of distribution, and have been the preferred choice for writers for the past century.{{r|twsNYT80009}} Still, there are increasing advantages for self-publishing, and there are increasing instances of writers moving between both the traditional and self-publishing models, for various reasons. Self-publishing is an increasingly likely choice for authors who are "midcareer, midlist, middle-aged, more or less middlebrow, and somewhat Internet savvy," writes journalist Neal Pollack, who extols the promise of being able to reach readers directly.{{r|twsNYT4221}} Elizabeth Prybylski, publisher of Insomnia, an indie press, describes the main difference between self-publishing and traditional publishing is "who puts up the overhead of production."

{{Quote|If the author doesn’t have the money, time, or inclination to do all of those things for their book and to pay the costs of production, a publisher’s experience and knowledge can make up for that gap.|Elizabeth Prybylski of Insomnia Press.}}

Analyses have been made suggesting that self-published authors’ earnings have been comparing favorably to earnings from established publishers,{{r|twsNPR2322}} and this may be a factor causing established authors to switch to the self-publishing approach. While a self-published author can typically keep 70% of the sales price, a typical contract with a publisher will be payment of an advance sum such as $5000 to $10,000, plus receiving 25% of digital sales and 7% to 12% of the list price for bound books, which the author will receive after the publisher recoups the money paid for the advance to the author.{{r|twsNYT16161}}

Authors being published the traditional way have seen their income from publishing decline in recent years. A survey from the Authors Guild found that authors with contracts with established publishers were making 30% less money in 2015 than they had been making in 2009.{{r|twsNPR1123}}  Talented writers in traditional publishing, who have won prizes and awards, are earning less, with some living at or near the poverty line.{{r|twsNPR1123}} Some books sell only 5,000 to 20,000 copies, some less than that.{{r|twsNPR1123}} Factors identified as dampening the income levels of such authors include the online piracy of digital material, major publishing houses consolidating to focus more on profits, and the rise of Amazon and self-publishing.{{r|twsNPR1123}}

[[File:David Jones Fashion Ambassador Miranda Kerr in store book signing in Sydney.jpg|thumb|right|Some writers have criticized mainstream publishers for emphasizing celebrity rather than quality writing. In photo: fashion model [[Miranda Kerr]] at a book signing.]]
Some writers have been dissatisfied with the marketing efforts of a traditional publisher. One writer got fed up when the publisher made basic mistakes with a book launch, and so he "decided to take his book back" and self-published it. He hired the firm Reedsy to redesign his book ''The Pink Marine'', and went on to form his own imprint.{{r|twsBloomberg433}} Novelist Louise Walters felt that traditional publishers were "debut-centric" and obsessed with celebrities.{{r|twsGuardian4474}} [[David Mamet]], whose book ''The Secret Knowledge: On the Dismantling of American Culture'' had been on the New York Times bestseller list, chose to release his novella by self-publishing.{{r|twsNYT16161}} He had been dissatisfied with the marketing efforts of his traditional publisher.{{r|twsNYT16161}} There was a report that suggested that traditional publishers have lessened their marketing efforts on behalf of authors.{{r|twsNYT16161}} Another example is romance novelist Courtney Milan who switched to self-publishing because she wanted to have "more agency over the background of her characters" and her stories.{{r|twsNYT43432}} Some photographers, who felt hemmed in by the traditional photo book publishing world, have started up their own imprints as a way to publish their own books.{{R|twsTime101}} Writer Sarah Grimm moved away from the traditional publishing approach to self-publishing because she wanted greater control over cover design, publication dates and the story content.{{r|twsUSAToday4435}}

{{Quote|My first book went through so many different changes that when it released, I no longer felt like it was the story I originally set out to tell.|Author Sarah Grimm on why she chose self-publishing.{{r|twsUSAToday4435}}}}

Novelist Louise Walters explained why she switched to the self-publishing mode, after her publisher rejected her second novel, describing self-publishing as an "exhilarating change":{{r|twsGuardian4474}}

{{Quote|Footing the bill to bring out the book means the responsibility is on my shoulders, but at the same time it’s incredibly freeing. I can market this book in any way I choose; I have real input into every decision regarding my work; I’ll even earn a fairer share of the proceeds from each sale … It’s only a book, after all, and self-publishing is a whole lot of fun.|Louise Walters in 2014{{r|twsGuardian4474}}}}

Still, it is likely that when a self-published author creates a bestseller, that he or she will accept an offer from a major publisher. Some traditional publishers troll the lists of bestselling self-published titles to look for new books to sell.{{r|twsNPR899}} Smashwords president Mark Coker predicted that it will become more difficult for traditional publishers to entice the best self-published authors, simply because traditional publishers don’t pay as much.{{r|twsNPR899}} Successful self-published authors have been courted by literary agents and publishers offering substantial sums of money.{{r|twsNYT80009}} It’s getting harder for established publishers to woo away successful self-published authors since the royalty structure they offer may not match the profits to be made from publishing on their own.{{r|twsNYT80009}}

===Advantages of self-publishing===
Benefits include:

* '''Speed.''' An author finds out right away whether a book is a hit with readers; there is not a six-month or longer delay typical with an established publisher since the usual back-and-forth steps with a publisher are bypassed. It is possible to release a book within a few weeks after it’s finished.{{r|twsUSAToday4435}} Further, it is possible to avoid the lengthy process of trying to find a literary agent to secure a publishing contract.{{r|twsBaltSun543}}
* '''No start-up costs.''' Manuscripts uploaded to KDP or Smashwords typically do not incur any fees.
* '''Freedom to begin the next book.''' An author can self-publish and then begin work on the next project, potentially being more prolific, although this presumes that the first book won’t need any marketing effort.
* '''A greater share of royalties.''' Self-published authors earn four to five times more per unit than if an author works with a traditional publisher,{{r|twsNPR899}} sometimes 70% of the sale price.
* '''Pitch books straight to the readers.''' There is no intermediary censoring what might be shown to the public. The route to readers is more direct.

{{Quote|Authors are no longer bound in their storytelling by what the traditional publishers think the market can bear ... Instead, because we can go straight to the reader now, we can write exactly the books that we want to write and exactly the books that our fans want to read. We don’t have to worry about whether an agent can sell the book, or if an editor and publisher want to buy the book, or if a retailer wants to stock the book. Personally, I think this new open market can — and does — make for much more interesting storytelling.|Novelist Bella Andre in the ''[[Washington Post]]'', 2015{{r|twsWP57575}}}}

* '''Creative freedom.'''{{r|twsBaltSun543}}

{{Quote|With self-publishing you don’t waste your time trying to get published, which can take years of query letters and agenting, and all this stuff. You go straight to the real gatekeepers, which are the readers. If they respond favorably and you have sales, you can leverage that into a writing career. If they don’t, you write the next thing. Either way you’re not spending your time trying to get published, you’re spending your time writing the next work.|[[Hugh Howey]], author of ''Wool''{{r|twsMiamiHerald324}}}}

===Disadvantages of self-publishing===
There are significant challenges to self-publishing as well.

* '''Most self-published books sell few copies.''' Some estimates are that they sell fewer than 100 to 150 copies;{{r|twsNYT9989}} another estimate is that most sell fewer than 250 copies.{{r|twsSFWA101}} However, it should be noted that the vast majority of books promoted by traditional publishers fail as well.{{r|twsChicTrib101}} Still, the overwhelming odds are that any self-published book will be ignored and end up in the "digital slush pile."{{r|twsNYT4221}}
* '''Authors must spend much time marketing their books.''' Authors must work hard to market their books, which is a task that many authors are not skilled at or willing to do.{{r|twsNYT80009}}
* '''Crowded landscape.''' There is much competition and it is difficult to get one’s book to be noticed in a glutted market.{{r|twsPW787}} Big publishers have much better prospects for getting attention for a book.{{r|twsWSJ438337}}
* '''Lack of prestige.''' A book from a traditional publisher still has a lot of cachet in that it has been vetted by editors, which gives it a "stamp of approval."{{r|twsBaltSun543|twsMiHer4949}}
* '''Hard to get into bookstores.''' Big bookstores rarely take self-published books, and if they do, they want 50% of the sales price.{{r|twsMiHer4949}} Publishers have established distribution channels to make this easy.
* '''Publishers offer editorial and marketing help.''' Plus they usually pay an advance to help the author with expenses at the early start of the publishing cycle, an advantage which self-published writers do not have.{{r|twsMiHer4949}}

{{Quote|You risk looking like an amateur ... Good writers need even better editors. They need brilliant cover designers. They need imaginative marketers and well-connected publicists. All these things are provided by a traditional publisher, and what’s more, it doesn’t cost you a penny. They pay you! If a self-published author wants to avoid looking like an amateur, they’d better be prepared to shell out some serious cash to get professional help in all the areas where they don’t excel. And I mean serious.|Ros Barber in 2016.{{r|twsGuardian8426}}}}

* '''Difficulty getting reviews in the mainstream press.''' It is difficult for self-published books to be reviewed in newspapers and magazines. The media favors books from traditional publishers before giving reviews.{{r|twsMiHer4949|twsGuardian8426}}
* '''Having to spend time marketing the book.''' One self-published author in Britain was working "14 hour days", spending months promoting her book ''Only the Innocent''; while she eventually made it to the UK Kindle bestseller chart, Rachel Abbott still has difficulty getting the publishing world to take her book seriously.{{r|twsGuardian4948}} Another writer, Ros Barber, thinks self-publishing is a "terrible idea for serious novelists" since the requirements of marketing and promoting a book will prevent one from writing, and he continues to recommend the traditional approach.{{r|twsGuardian8426}}

{{Quote|You have to forget writing for a living ... Self-publishing can make you behave like a fool ... The vast majority of indie authors have tweetstreams that are 90% adverts, perhaps a reflection of the fact that they must spend 90% of their time marketing ... Good writers become good because they undertake an apprenticeship.|Ros Barber on the benefits of the traditional approach, 2016.{{r|twsGuardian8426}}}}

* '''Self-published books usually ineligible for prizes.''' Books are not eligible for major prizes such as the Hay festival, the Booker, the Baileys, the Costa and the Man Booker, and literary novels need these prizes to become a bestseller.{{r|twsGuardian8426}} However, there are signs that this is changing as more books become self-published.

'''Shegetz '''(שייגעץ or in [[Hebrew]] שֵׁיְגֶּץ; alternative [[Romanization]]s incl. '''shaygetz''', '''sheigetz''', '''shaigetz''', '''sheygets'''; plural שקצים '''shkotzim''', '''shgatzim''') is a [[Yiddish]] word that has entered [[English language|English]] to refer to a non-[[Jew]]ish boy or young man. It is  used disparagingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/shegetz|title=the definition of shegetz|website=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word shegetz, like its feminine counterpart [[shiksa]], according to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', is derived from ''sheqeṣ'' ("a detested thing").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Shiksa |encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary |year=2009 |version=Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-956383-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In former times, it was common practice for [[Ashkenazi Jews]], that is, Jews in Eastern Europe who were harassed by youths to label their tormentors ''shkotzim''. Nacham Grossbard of [[Haifa]], writing in the ''Memorial Book for the Community of [[Ciechanów]]'' (1962), recounted these memories of his early years in [[Poland]]: "At the finish of the match, as soon as the whistle blows, we Jewish boys run as fast as we can, out of breath, all the way home in order not to have stones thrown at us or be hit by the shkotzim (non-Jewish boys)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishgen.org/yizkor/Ciechanow/cie197.html|title=Ciechanow, Poland (Pages 197-203)|website=www.jewishgen.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shimoyama Incident.JPG|thumb|Removal of Shimoyama's remains from the [[Jōban Line]]]]

The {{nihongo|'''Shimoyama incident'''|下山事件|Shimoyama jiken}} was an incident in Japan in 1949, which involved the disappearance and death of {{nihongo|Sadanori Shimoyama|下山 定則|Shimoyama Sadanori|born July 23, 1901}}, the first president of [[Japanese National Railways]]. He disappeared on his way to work, July 5, 1949, and his body was found the next day.&lt;ref name=Asahi&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://doraku.asahi.com/earth/showa/090519.html|script-title=ja:振り返る昭和 昭和24年 戦後最大の謎、下山事件|trans-title=Playback Showa 1949 - Shimoyama Incident, the biggest mystery after the war|language=Japanese|author=Shibata, Tetsutaka|date=May 19, 2009|accessdate=March 23, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323045444/http://doraku.asahi.com/earth/showa/090519.html|archivedate=March 23, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the discovery of his body, the media offered conflicting explanations involving suicide and murder, while the police did not publicly report the results of their investigation, which was then ended.&lt;ref name=Asahi/&gt; The [[Mitaka incident]], the [[Matsukawa derailment]], and the Shimoyama incident occurred within one month of one another, and together are known as JNR's Three Big Mysteries.

==Background==
Sadanori Shimoyama, bureaucrat of [[Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (Japan)|Ministry of Transport]] (former [[Ministry of Railways (Japan)|Ministry of Railways]]), was appointed the first president of JNR when it was established on June 1, 1949. Under the [[Dodge Line]] policy of the government, Shimoyama was responsible for drastic personnel cutbacks of JNR, as a part of which on July 4, 1949 he released a list of about 30,000 employees to be fired.&lt;ref name=Asahi/&gt;

[[File:Sadanori Shimoyama.jpg|thumb|left|Sadanori Shimoyama]]
On the morning of next day, July 5, Shimoyama left his home in [[Ōta, Tokyo]] around 8:20. On his way to work, he instructed the driver to stop at the [[Mitsukoshi]] Department Store in [[Nihonbashi]]. Having arrived at the store before its opening, they returned to a Chiyoda Bank office (now [[The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ]]) in front of [[Tokyo Station]]. They then followed a circuitous route back to the Mitsukoshi store. Around 9:37 AM, Shimoyama again got out of the official car, telling the driver to wait for five minutes.&lt;ref name=Asahi/&gt; He quickly entered the Mitsukoshi. This was the last he was heard from.

Normally, Shimoyama arrived at JNR headquarters before 9 AM and was greeted by his secretary. On the day of his disappearance, in the tense atmosphere of impending personnel cutbacks, there was an important meeting scheduled at 9 AM. His failure to arrive, after confirming from home that he would be there, caused a great stir at JNR headquarters, and the police were contacted. The investigation began as a missing persons case. On July 6, past 12:30 AM, Shimoyama's dismembered body was found on the [[Jōban Line]] between [[Kita-Senju Station]] and [[Ayase Station]]. He had been hit by a train.&lt;ref name=Asahi/&gt;

==After the disappearance==
After the disappearance, an individual fitting Shimoyama's description was reported seen first in the Mitsukoshi department store, then riding on a [[Tokyo Metro Ginza Line|Ginza Line]] subway train bound for [[Asakusa Station (Tokyo Metro, Toei, Tobu)|Asakusa]]. In the Mitsukoshi store, many people reported having seen him.

After 1:40 PM, the individual spoke with a station attendant at [[Tobu Railway]]'s [[Gotanno Station]], close to where the body was discovered. Following that, from 2 PM until some time past 5 PM, he stopped at Matsuhiro Ryokan, close to the station. There were many reports of a man with Shimoyama's height and clothing walking south along the [[Tōbu Isesaki Line]] from 6 PM until after 8 PM from Gotanno toward the spot in which the body was found.

==Pre- or postmortem dismemberment==
[[File:Investigation on D51-651.jpg|thumb|Inspection of locomotive D51 651, which hit Shimoyama]]
Found on the outbound track of the Jōban Line, it was determined that Shimoyama's body had been severed around 20 minutes after midnight by outbound freight train No. 869, pulled by locomotive [[JNR Class D51|D51 651]]. The official autopsy was led by Tokyo University professor of forensic medicine Tanemoto Furuhata. Based on the injuries to the body, it was determined that Shimoyama died prior to being hit by the train. The autopsy itself was performed by Furuhata's colleague Naoki Kuwashima.

Although a specific cause of death was not established, blood loss (at another location) was possible due to the lack of blood on the body and at the scene. Additionally, in some parts of the body life-threatening internal bleeding was found which could have been caused only by considerable force, such as kicking.

On the other hand, a Tokyo municipal coroner who had examined the body at the scene believed that Shimoyama's death was suicide. However, the internal bleeding observed in the remains of Shimoyama was also consistent with being hit by a train, and investigators would not have been able to observe blood at the scene because it was raining. As such, these as facts are not useful to support a murder theory.

[[Keio University]] professor Nakadate Kyūhei believed that Shimoyama was alive when hit by the train, although he never saw the body. These theories stand in opposition to one another. On August 30, 1949, Furuhata, Nakadate, and Kyōsuke Komiya of Nagoya Medical School were called to testify before the Committee on Judicial Affairs of the [[Diet of Japan|Diet]]'s [[House of Representatives of Japan|House of Representatives]], and in doing so brought the Diet and the world of forensic medicine into the controversy. In response to the committee's questions, Furuhata stated that "Kuwashima still cannot officially declare this a murder or suicide. He has stated only that the body was dismembered after death. The investigation is still underway, and those who know nothing of it but make deductions anyway are unscientific and taking liberties."

'''Tamil folk culture''' refers to [[Folk culture|folk arts and crafts]] of the [[Tamil people]].  Folk arts and crafts are an integral part of the [[Tamil culture]].  Tamil folk arts include music i.e. [[Naattupurapaattu]], dance styles, songs, games, crafts, herbal medicine, food, sculpture, costumes, stories, proverbs, and mythology.

Tamil folk art is characterized by its local, participatory, and open source character.  Tamil folk culture often expresses village sensibilities, where most Tamils historically lived.  It is often contrasted with [[Bharatanatyam]], and [[Carnatic music]].

}}'''The Fremantle Society''' is a community-based culture and heritage advocacy group in [[Fremantle, Western Australia]].  It was formed in 1972 to prevent demolition of historic buildings in Fremantle and to assist in their development.&lt;ref name="FfF"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Davidson |first1=Ron |first2=Dianne |last2=Davidson |title=Fighting for Fremantle: a history of The Fremantle Society |publisher=[[Fremantle Press]] |year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the significance of Fremantle's built heritage came to be more widely recognised and respected (by the [[City of Fremantle|City]], and property owners), the focus of the Fremantle Society has evolved to include more of the [[cultural heritage]] of the area.

Various projects over time have highlighted Fremantle heritage,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Gore, Stuart | author2=Reece, Rob | title=[Interview with Stuart Gore] | publication-date=1982 | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/159331779 | accessdate=14 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Fremantle Society | author2=Interiors Project, 1992 | title=Interiors Project, 1992.

When the City's precinct system was established in the 1990s to provide interaction between the City and groups of residents, the Society became the "umbrella" precinct of the other eleven precincts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fremantle.wa.gov.au/cityoffremantle/Community_engagement/Precincts |title=Precincts |author=City of Fremantle |accessdate=28 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has remained such, and is the only one not defined by geographical boundaries (the others are mostly representative of a suburb).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Precinct Map |author=City of Fremantle |url=http://www.fremantle.wa.gov.au/files/61955BCB-171E-4DD2-8DA1-9F9E00AF7389/precinct_map.pdf |accessdate=28 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work of precinct groups can be supported by financial assistance from the City of up to $850 per year (as long as this is not used to support government election campaigning).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Precinct Guidelines |author=City of Fremantle |date=August 2012 |url=http://www.fremantle.wa.gov.au/files/61955BCB-171E-4DD2-8DA1-9F9E00AF7389/precinct_map.pdf |accessdate=28 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The overall nature of the Society's work is ongoing due to the inherent pressures from developers and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Dawkins, Jeremy | author2=MacGill, Gerry | title=The politics of planning in Fremantle | journal=Urban Policy and Research | publication-date=June 1990 | volume=8 | issue=2 | pages=81–85 | issn=0811-1146 | doi=10.1080/08111149008551432| year=1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fighting for Fremantle'', a history of the Society by Ron and Dianne Davidson, was published by [[Fremantle Press]] in 2010.  It was launched by the Premier of [[Western Australia]], [[Colin Barnett]], in [[Victoria Hall (Fremantle)|Victoria Hall]].

== Campaigns ==
The Society has led campaigns to prevent the loss of many significant buildings in Fremantle; not all have been successful. Some examples include:
* The [[Oriana Cinema]], an [[art deco]] building on the corner of High and Queen Streets (demolished in 1972).
* [[Fremantle Markets]].
* The proposed widening of High Street and demolition of all buildings along the south side of the road.
* [[Fremantle Prison]].
* [[Victoria Quay, Fremantle|Victoria Quay]] development, which in 2014 is still under discussion.{{update after|2015|01|01}}

Other projects have also been undertaken, such as the 1978–80 photographic survey of almost every building in Fremantle, and the [[Freopedia]] wikitown project.{{update after|2015|01|01}}

The '''transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil''' occurred with the strategic retreat of Queen [[Maria I of Portugal]], [[John VI of Portugal|Prince Regent John]], also referred to as Dom João or Dom João VI, and the [[House of Braganza|Braganza royal family]] and its court of nearly 15,000 people from [[Lisbon]] on November 29, 1807. The Braganza royal family departed for the [[Colonial Brazil|Portuguese colony of Brazil]] just days before Napoleonic forces invaded Lisbon on December 1. The [[Portuguese crown]] remained in Brazil from 1808 until the [[Liberal Revolution of 1820]] led to the return of [[John VI of Portugal]] on April 26, 1821.&lt;ref name=gomes1808&gt;{{cite book|first=Laurentino|last=Gomes|authorlink=Laurentino Gomes|title=[[1808 (book)|1808: The Flight of the Emperor]]|year=2007|publisher=Planeta|isbn=978-85-7665-320-2|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|321}} For thirteen years, [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil, functioned as the capital of the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] in what some historians call a "metropolitan reversal", i.e., a colony exercising governance over the entirety of the (in this case Portuguese) empire. The period in which the court was located in Rio brought significant changes to the city and its residents, and can be interpreted through several perspectives. It had profound impacts on Brazilian society, economics, infrastructure, and politics. The transfer of the king and the royal court "represented the first step toward Brazilian independence, since the king immediately opened the ports of Brazil to foreign shipping and turned the colonial capital into the seat of government."&lt;ref name=dean&gt;Warren Dean, "Bazil: 1808–1889" in ''Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture'', vol. 1, p. 420. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and transformations ==
[[File:Antonio jose quinto - dom joão vi.jpg|thumb|Dom João VI]]
In 1807, at the outset of the [[Peninsular War]], Napoleonic forces [[Invasion of Portugal (1807)|invaded Portugal]] due to the Portuguese alliance with Great Britain. The [[prince regent]] of Portugal at the time, [[John VI of Portugal|John VI]], had formally governed the country on behalf of [[Maria I of Portugal]] since 1799. Anticipating the invasion of Napoleon's army, John VI ordered the transfer of the Portuguese royal court to Brazil before he could be deposed. Setting sail for Brazil on November 29, the royal party navigated under the protection of the [[Royal Navy|British Royal Navy]], and eight ships of the line, five frigates, and four smaller vessels of the [[Portuguese Navy]], under the command of Admiral [[William Sidney Smith|Sir Sidney Smith]]. On December 5, almost halfway between Lisbon and [[Madeira]], Sidney Smith, along with Britain's envoy to Lisbon, [[Percy Smythe, 6th Viscount Strangford|Lord Strangford]], returned to Europe with part of the British flotilla. [[Graham Moore (admiral)|Graham Moore]], a British sailor and career officer in the [[Royal Navy]], continued escorting the Portuguese royal family to Brazil with the ships [[HMS Marlborough (1807)|''Marlborough'']], [[HMS London (1766)|''London'']], [[HMS Bedford (1775)|''Bedford'']], and [[HMS Monarch (1765)|''Monarch'']].&lt;ref name=gomes1808 /&gt;{{rp|97}}

On January 22, 1808, John and his court arrived in [[Salvador, Brazil]]. There, Prince John signed the "''Abertura dos Portos"'' law which allowed commerce between Brazil and "friendly nations." This was particularly beneficial for Great Britain and can be seen as one of many ways Prince John found to reward the British Empire for their assistance. This new law, however, broke the colonial pact that had permitted Brazil to maintain direct commercial relations with Portugal only. This transformed the Brazilian economy, and subsequently, its demographics and society. Secret negotiations at London in 1807 by Portuguese ambassador Domingos António de Sousa Coutinho guaranteed British military protection in exchange for British access to Brazil's ports and to [[Madeira]] as a naval base. Coutinho's secret negotiations paved the way for Prince John's law to come to fruition in 1808.&lt;ref name=gomes1808 /&gt;{{rp|117}} Later on, in attempts to modernize the economy and diversify the production of the colony, Dom João allowed for the establishment of manufacturing industries in 1808 through the signing of the "''Alvará de Liberdade para as Indústrias''".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Textos Políticos da História do Brasil|last=Amaral|first=Roberto|publisher=Senado Federal|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=412–413}}&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that Brazil would no longer only be an agricultural producer. In this decree, Dom João said that in an attempt to promote national wealth and recognize that manufacturing, industrial labor, and multiplication of labor promote means of subsistence for subjects, Brazil should heavily invest in those sectors effective immediately. He abolished any prohibition to industrial development. This attracted investment from Great Britain and, in a way, did expand the demand for labor.

When the Portuguese court arrived in Rio de Janeiro on March 7, 1808, Brazil was very sparsely populated, with a little over 3 million inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/180190498|title=1808 : como uma rainha louca, um príncipe medroso e uma corte corrupta enganaram Napoleão e mudaram a história de Portugal e do Brasil|last=1956-|first=Gomes, Laurentino,|date=2007|publisher=Editora Planeta do Brasil|isbn=9788576653202|location=São Paulo|oclc=180190498}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around one-third of the colony’s population consisted of enslaved peoples, most having been captured and shipped from Africa.&lt;ref name="gomes1808" /&gt; The indigenous population at the time was of around 800,000 people,&lt;ref name="gomes1808" /&gt; having been dramatically reduced and isolated during the first 300 years of exploration and colonization. Population density was concentrated along the Atlantic coastline. Rio de Janeiro, around the start of the 19th century, was experiencing a sizeable population boom. Over the 18th century, the population had increased tenfold due to the discovery of gold and diamonds and the migration of 800,000 individuals that ensued. In addition, it is estimated that 2 million enslaved Africans were brought to Brazil to work in mines and power the sugar industry.&lt;ref name="gomes1808" /&gt; Brazilians were illiterate, poor, and lacking several basic needs, including medical care and public health services. Only 2.5% of free men were literate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Uma história do Brasil|last=Skidmore|first=Thomas|publisher=Paz e Terra|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These changes made the city crammed, the population was displeased, and rudimentary colonial administrations were not enough to ensure progress. 
[[File:Carlota Joaquina por Manuel António de Castro.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Carlota Joaquina]]
The then small city of Rio de Janeiro was not prepared to welcome the Portuguese court. While the royal family was greeted with cheer and festivities that lasted for weeks, 10,000 houses were branded with the letters ‘PR’ standing for ''príncipe regente'' or prince regent, which meant that the homeowners had to evacuate to allow for the nobility to move in. In an almost silent form of protest, Brazilians quickly gave another meaning to the letters. They started to read ‘PR’ as ''ponha-se na rua'', a phrase that directly translates into to “put yourselves out on the street.” Another example of implicit forms of protest or negative reactions of the relocation of the court was the intensified presence of caricaturized depictions of Dom João and Carlota. Making its way through popular discourse and taking stereotypical exaggerations that built up Brazilian folklore, Dom João was a weak, gluttonous, unprepared man who cowardly fled Portugal, where he now was to live a lazy life, unaware of the needs of Brazilians. Carlota, portrayed as a strong, rude, and non-submissive woman to further attack the image of Dom João as an emasculated ruler, had harsh facial features, was moody, and was very open about her infidelity to her husband and lack of love for the colony.

The relocation of the administrative core of the Portuguese Empire to Brazil had several political ramifications. Dom João and the court found themselves charged with the responsibility to please several different groups of people at the same time. For starters, they had to please the 15,000 people who they had somewhat forced to move to Brazil with them. Then, they had to please their hosts: the Brazilians and Portuguese people who had established themselves in Brazil prior to 1808. The British Empire, a long-term ally of the Portuguese and who had played a vital role in the relocation of the court saw benefits in trade with this new administration (refer to the ‘Economic Changes’ sub-section for more details). Furthermore, Austrians, a new ally of the Portuguese Empire were satisfied with the marital connections made with Portugal. Princess Maria Leopoldina of Austria was promised to Dom Pedro I (Dom João VI’s heir) in 1817 and moved to Brazil as a youth.

Between 1808 and 1821, Dom João VI, serving as prince regent until 1818 and then as king from 1818 onwards, granted 145 nobility titles.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garcia de Oliveira|first=Marina|date=2013|title=Entre nobres lusitanos e titulados brasileiros: práticas, políticas e significados dos títulos nobiliárquicos entre o Período Joanino e o alvorecer do Segundo Reinado|url=|journal=Universidade de São Paulo|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the time that the court was located in Brazil, the Portuguese royal family collectively granted more titles of nobility than it had in its past 300 years of existence in Portugal. Much can be said about the motivations for ennobling so many people, and these titles had consequences to the political scene of Brazil, including the systematic isolation of Brazilians from politics. Between 1811 and 1821, a vast majority of noble titles were granted to those who had travelled with the court in 1807 or had fought the French in Portugal and somehow had made their way to Brazil.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As an additional way to thank Great Britain for their efforts to protect the Portuguese Empire and their expanding economic relationship with the colony, titles of nobility were also given to British individuals. Furthermore, the titles of nobilityserved as a means to consolidate the rule of the Joanine court and confirm the power status of the monarchy in the so-called ‘New World.’ When Dom João elevated the status of Brazil from colony to a co-kingdom as the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves to participate in the Congress of Vienna away from Europe, there was a sharp increase in the amount of titles granted. Not only did this change affect nobility titles, it also increased the power of the Portuguese in Brazilian affairs. Rio became an important center for world trade and grew immensely, having its demographics changed incessantly. The monarchy, as expected, favored the Portuguese to be in command of political offices, and with the creation of new government positions, departments, and military branches, almost every official was Portuguese.

Out of all 145 nobility titles granted, only six were granted to Brazilians.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Consistently, Brazilians were given the lowest royal title, that of barão or baron. To somewhat make up for the fact that Portuguese not only got more titles but also got more prestigious titles that made them more influential with the nobility, Brazilians were also granted land and seats in the Conselho da Fazenda.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These were surreptitious ways to keep Brazilians content with the monarchy and appeasing that population without jeopardizing Portuguese high society, both in Brazil and in Portugal. The first nobility title granted to a Brazilian was in 1812 to the Baroness of São Salvador de Campos dos Goytacazes. Out of the 26 titles of nobility granted in 1818, only three Brazilian men were graced: José Egídio Álvares de Almeida, Pedro Dias Paes Leme, and Paulo Fernandes Carneiro Viana.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; So many nobility titles were granted in 1818 most likely because that was when Dom João became de facto king. 17 nobility titles were granted on the day Dom João was crowned. As it can be expected, these titles did not benefit Brazilians much and did not create tight bonds between Brazilians and the new nobility. It was a reality unknown to many, even the wealthiest Brazilians. An argument can be made of this: nobility titles were made exclusively for Europeans to preserve the contrast in power and superiority of Europeans in Brazil. By granting titles to Portuguese individuals and those with close ties with Portugal, the court guaranteed the financial support to sustain themselves halfway across the Atlantic.

When talking about the intensification of economic progress, it is important to note that this means an increase in the demand for slave labor. With the end of the colonial pact, the coffee industry boomed and the sugar industry continued to flourish. Now, being able to manufacture goods, the naval and steel industries started to develop. The arrival of enslaved individuals increased dramatically during the period that the court was in Brazil and then during the decade following their absence, with the arrival of approximately 328,000 enslaved individuals to Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Economic Change in Pre-Colonial Africa: Senegambia in the Era of the Slave Trade|last=Curtin|first=Philip|publisher=Madison|year=1975|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This drastically changed the demographics of Brazil and of Rio, where most of these enslaved individuals would arrive and remain at. It is estimated that the enslaved population in Rio, at its height, was more than half of the total population. After the successful slave revolution that took place in Haiti a few years before, the court started to worry the small elites regarding potential rebellion and revolution. This led to the creation of the Military Division of the ''Guarda Real de Polícia'', or Royal Police Guard, in charge of urban policing that before the arrival of the royal family consisted of informal guards, watchmen, and sentinels. This further isolated and oppressed enslaved peoples and was the beginning of a phenomenon that proceeded in the 19th and 20th centuries of the criminalization of poverty. It reemphasized racial discrimination on an official level and associated disorder with lack of money and social ascension. This is also when Dom João VI decreed the establishment of a mounted guard.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, the penal system was used to take control of lower classes and minor infractions or public disorder, including “disrespecting curfew, playing games of luck, drinking alcohol and begging”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rioonwatch.org/?p=13506|title=Rio On Watch|last=Ashcroft|first=Patrick|date=February 18, 2014|work=Rio On Watch|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; could be punishable by law and prison. Furthermore, while attempts to “civilize” the city were made, it also meant that the biggest difference between the old court and the one in Brazil was that half of it now consisted of enslaved peoples. Slavery was not legal in Portugal but allowed in the New World, and continued for several decades even after Brazil achieved independence from Portugal.&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt;

Imperial relocation also meant the stratification of hierarchy. Those who were already rich, usually because of their connections to nobility, got richer (usually for the same reasons they had been rich in the first place) and the poorer got even poorer, now having to compete for resources, services, and physical space. With the Portuguese government now in Brazil, Portuguese immigration retention increased and this led to further disapproval of Cariocas (the term given to those native to the city of Rio de Janeiro). While the court and nobility wanted to portray itself as open to hearing the critiques and desires of the Brazilian population, only a select few could attend audiences with Dom João. He implemented the ceremony of ''beija-mão'', a daily ritual where subjects got the chance to go to the royal residence, kiss the king’s hand, and express their grievances. This practice to supposedly stay in touch with common people allowed for the social elites to voice their agendas, including white men, the nobility, and the clergy.
[[File:Mapa da cidade do Rio de Janeiro.jpg|thumb|289x289px|Map of the city of Rio de Janeiro in 1820, then capital of the Kingdom of Portugal, with the transfer of the court to Brazil.]]
On December 16, 1815, John created the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]] (''Reino Unido de Portugal, Brasil e Algarves''), elevating Brazil to the same rank as Portugal and increasing the administrative independence of Brazil. Brazilian representatives were elected to the Portuguese Constitutional Courts (''Cortes Constitucionais Portuguesas''). In 1815, in the aftermath of Napoleon's defeat and the meeting of the [[Congress of Vienna]] convened to restore European political arrangements, the Portuguese monarch declared Brazil a co-equal to Portugal to increase Portugal's bargaining power.&lt;ref name=dean/&gt; In 1816, with the death of Queen Maria, Prince John became king of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. After several delays, the ceremony of his acclamation took place in Rio de Janeiro in 1818.

Beyond having to go through infrastructural expansion to accommodate for the arrival of 15,000 people, Rio continued to be modified and upgraded in the early stages of the transferring of the court. The city lacked basic sanitation and structured sewer systems. There were very few roads. The goal was to “construct an ideal city; a city in which both mundane and monumental architecture, together with its residents’ social and cultural practices projected an unequivocally powerful and virtuous image of royal authority and government.”&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt; The city had to reflect the flourishing of the empire and institutions like public libraries, botanic gardens, opera house, palaces and government buildings were created. Rio was to be modern and secure. Architecture physically changed to reflect modern times.

Furthermore, before the arrival of the royal family and court, Brazil consisted of very disconnected conglomerates of people. Vast amounts of empty land and dense tropical forest separated cities like Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Salvador, Pernambuco, Rio Grande, and Porto Alegre. Needing to create a unified way to control the state and effectively manage territory, the government put in efforts to connect city centers through road development. The monarchy also encouraged internal trade. The isolation of cities was once used by the Portuguese Empire to maintain Brazilians subordinate and unable to organize against the crown. Now, having to manage the territory directly, that was no longer useful. It goes without saying that all of these infrastructural developments came at the cost of slaves’ hard work and lives. It is estimated that between 1808 and 1822, “Rio’s slave population increased by 200 percent. As a consequence, remaking Rio de Janeiro into the court meant reconciling the larger quest to metropolitanize the city with slavery and with the African and African-Brazilian residents who made up the majority of its population.”&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt;

Among the important measures taken by John VI (in attempts to Europeanize the country) were creating incentives for commerce and industry, allowing newspapers and books to be printed, even though the ''Imprensa Régia'', Brazil's first printing press was highly regulated by the government, establishing two medical schools, establishing [[military academies]], and creating the first Bank of Brazil (''[[Banco do Brasil]]''). In Rio de Janeiro, he also established a powder factory, [[Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden|a botanical garden]], [[Escola Nacional de Belas Artes|an art academy]], and [[Teatro São João|an opera house]]. All these measures advanced Brazil's independence from Portugal. Less beneficial were the crown's policies continuing the African slave trade, attacks on indigenous peoples, and land grants to court favorites.  He blocked the entry of ideas of political independence expressed in the U.S. and the former Spanish American colonies, now independent republics. Britain's influence in Brazil increased, with favorable terms of trade, but also [[extraterritoriality]] for British merchants.&lt;ref name="dean" /&gt;

Owing to the absence of the king and the economic independence of Brazil, Portugal entered a [[Liberal Revolution of 1820|severe political crisis]] that obliged John VI and the royal family to return to Portugal on April 25, 1821, otherwise he risked loss of his Portuguese throne.&lt;ref name="dean" /&gt; The heir of John VI, [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro I]], remained in Brazil. The Portuguese ''Cortes'' demanded that Brazil return to its former status as a colony and the return of the heir to Portugal. Prince Pedro, influenced by the Rio de Janeiro Municipal Senate (''Senado da Câmara''), refused to return to Portugal during the ''Dia do Fico'' (January 9, 1822). Brazil declared its independence on September 7, 1822, forming the [[Empire of Brazil]], ending 322 years of colonial dominance of Portugal over Brazil. Pedro was crowned the first emperor in Rio de Janeiro on October 12, 1822, taking the name Dom Pedro I.

== Aftermath ==
The Portuguese court’s tenure in Rio de Janeiro created the conditions which led to Brazil’s independence. With the court’s arrival, Rio de Janeiro saw an immediate increase in its population.&lt;ref name="Nunes"&gt;Barbosa Nunes, Rosana. "Portuguese Migration to Rio de Janeiro, 1822–1850". ''The Americas'', 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; This, coupled with increases in trade and subsequent immigration, transformed the city into a major economic center in the [[New World]]. In 1815, this resulted in Brazil being declared a co-kingdom with Portugal, raising it from its former colonial status.&lt;ref name="Wilcken"&gt;Wilcken, Patrick. ''Empire Adrift: The Portuguese Court in Rio de Janeiro 1808–1821''. Bloomsbury, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; This was an embodiment of Brazil’s growing independence from Portugal, a growth that led to the creation of a written constitution for Brazil in 1820, and intensified after the royal family’s return to Europe a year later.&lt;ref name="Schultz"&gt;Schultz, Kirsten. ''Tropical Versailles: Empire, Monarchy, and the Portuguese Court in Rio de Janeiro, 1808–1821''. New York: Routledge, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilcken"/&gt;

The relocation of the Portuguese nobility and administrative core to Brazil in 1808 had tremendous ramifications and resulted in a multi-faceted approach to change. Brazilian politics were initiated and affected, society and demographics were altered, the economy developed, and the city of Rio de Janeiro physically changed. The impact was felt in different ways and degrees by different sections of the population: nobility, wealthy families, Brazilians, indigenous peoples, and enslaved Africans or Afro-Brazilians. The stability and prosperity of the Brazilian state, resulting from the royal court’s presence, allowed for it to declare independence from Portugal without the violence and destabilization characteristic of similar movements in neighboring countries.&lt;ref name="Wilcken"/&gt; This was in part because its burgeoning independent identity had had an effect on Pedro, King John’s oldest son and first emperor of Brazil. Pedro was nine years old when the family fled Portugal, meaning he was raised in Rio de Janeiro. Coming of age in Brazil rather than Portugal led to Pedro identifying as a Brazilian, a sentiment which influenced his defiance of the Cortes in 1821.&lt;ref name="Pappas"&gt;Dale Pappas, [http://www.napoleon-series.org/research/government/Brazil/c_Independence.html The Napoleonic Wars and Brazilian Independence.] The Napoleon Series, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to his position as heir of the Portuguese crown, Pedro was able to prevent any serious efforts on the part of the Portuguese to retake Brazil. The relatively smooth transition into independence, along with the economic and cultural strides made since the royal court’s first arrival, resulted in a thriving time for the young nation. Throughout the royal court’s stay in Rio de Janeiro and during the early part of its independence, Brazil saw a huge influx of immigrants and imported slaves.&lt;ref name="Nunes"/&gt; The immigrants were largely young Portuguese, the majority of which elected to stay in Brazil permanently, rather than return to Portugal. This migration also mirrored a [[History of Portugal (1777–1834)|period of political upheaval]] in Portugal, wherein the loss of Brazil started a series of revolts.&lt;ref name="Wilcken"/&gt; The retention of immigrants demonstrated the newfound economic opportunities of the newly independent Brazil, while waves of [[anti-Portuguese sentiment]] among the masses of Rio de Janeiro revealed the nation’s lingering resentment towards its former rulers.&lt;ref name="Nunes"/&gt;

'''Workers' self-management''' (also referred to as '''self-management''', '''labor management''', '''autogestión,''' '''[[workers' control]]''', '''[[industrial democracy]]''', '''[[Workplace democracy|democratic management]]''', and '''[[worker cooperative]]''') is a form of organizational [[management]] based on self-directed work processes on the part of an organization's workforce. Self-management is a characteristic of many forms of [[socialism]], with proposals for self-management having appeared many times throughout the history of the socialist movement, advocated variously by [[Market socialism|market socialists]], [[communists]], and [[anarchists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Steele |first= David |title= From Marx to Mises: Post-Capitalist Society and the Challenge of Economic Calculation |publisher= Open Court Publishing Company |year= 1992|month= |isbn= 978-0875484495|page = 323|quote=The proposal that all the workers in a workplace should be in charge of the management of that workplace has appeared in various forms throughout the history of socialism…among the labels attached to this form of organization are ‘self-management’, ‘labor management’, ‘workers’ control’, ‘worker control’, ‘industrial democracy’ and ‘producers’ co-operatives’.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many variations of self-management. In some variants, all the worker-members manage the enterprise directly through assemblies; in other forms, workers exercise management functions indirectly through the election of specialist managers. Self-management may include worker supervision and oversight of an organization by elected bodies, the election of specialized managers, or self-directed management without any specialized managers as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Steele |first= David |title= From Marx to Mises: Post-Capitalist Society and the Challenge of Economic Calculation |publisher= Open Court Publishing Company |year= 1992|month= |isbn= 978-0875484495|page = 323|quote=The self-management idea has many variants. All the workers may manage together directly, by means of an assembly, or indirectly by electing a supervisory board. They may manage in co-operation with a group of specialized managers or they may do without them.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goals of self-management are to improve performance by granting workers greater autonomy in their day-to-day operations, boosting morale, reducing [[Social alienation|alienation]], and when paired with employee ownership, eliminating exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= O'Hara|first= Phillip |title= Encyclopedia of Political Economy, Volume 2 |publisher= Routledge|date=September 2003|isbn= 0-415-24187-1|pages = 9|quote=In eliminating the domination of capital over labour, firms run by workers eliminate capitalist exploitation and reduce alienation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An enterprise that is self-managed is referred to as a ''labour-managed firm''. Self-management refers to control rights within a productive organization, being distinct from the questions of ownership and what [[economic system]] the organization operates under.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Prychito|first= David L. |title= Markets, Planning, and Democracy: Essays After the Collapse of Communism |publisher= Edward Elgar Pub|date=July 31, 2002|isbn= 978-1840645194|pages = 71|quote=
The labor-managed firm is a productive organization whose ultimate decision making rights rest in the workers of the firm...In this sense workers’ self-management – as a basic principle – is about establishing control rights within a productive organization, while it leaves open the issue of de jure ownership (that is, who enjoys legal title to the physical and financial assets of the firm) and the type of economic system in which the firm is operating.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-management of an organization may coincide with [[employee ownership]] of that organization, but self-management can also exist in the context of organizations under [[public ownership]], and to a limited extent within [[Private property|private companies]] in the form of [[co-determination]] and worker representation on the board of directors.

== Economic theory ==
An [[economic system]] consisting of self-managed enterprises is sometimes referred to as a ''participatory economy'', ''self-managed economy'', or ''cooperative economy''. This economic model is a major version of market socialism and decentralized planned economy, stemming from the notion that people should be able to participate in making the decisions that affect their well-being. The major proponents of self-managed market socialism in the 20th century include the economists [[Benjamin Ward]], [[Jaroslav Vanek]], and Branko Horvat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Gregory and Stuart|first= Paul and Robert |title= Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First Century, Seventh Edition |publisher=George Hoffman|year= 2004 |isbn= 0-618-26181-8|pages = 145–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ward-Vanek model of self-management involves the diffusion of entrepreneurial roles amongst all the partners of the enterprise.

Branko Horvat notes that participation is not simply more desirable but also more economically viable than traditional hierarchical and authoritarian management as demonstrated by econometric measurements, which indicate an increase in efficiency with greater participation in decision-making. According to Horvat, these developments are moving the world toward a self-governing socialistic mode of organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Horvat|first= Branko |title= The Political Economy of Socialism: A Marxist Social Theory |publisher=M.E Sharpe Inc|year= 1983 |isbn= 978-0873322560|page = 173|quote = Participation is not only more desirable, it is also economically more viable than traditional authoritarian management. Econometric measurements indicate that efficiency increases with participation...There is little doubt that the world is moving toward a socialist, self-governing society at an accelerated pace.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the economic theory of self-management, workers are no longer employees but partners in the administration of their enterprise. Management theories in favor of greater self-management and self-directed activity cite the importance of autonomy for productivity in the firm, and economists in favor of self-management argue that cooperatives are more efficient than centrally-managed firms because every worker receives a portion of the profit, thereby directly tying their productivity to their level of compensation.

Historical economic figures who supported cooperatives and self-management of some kind include the anarchist [[Pierre Joseph Proudhon]], classical economist [[John Stuart Mill]], and the neoclassical economist [[Alfred Marshall]]. Contemporary proponents of self-management include the American [[Marxist]] economist [[Richard D. Wolff]] and [[Anarchism|anarchist]] [[philosopher]] [[Noam Chomsky]].

=== Labor managed firm ===

The theory of the labor manager firm explains the behavior, performance and nature of self-managed organizational forms. Although self-managed (or labor-managed) firms can coincide with worker ownership (employee ownership), the two are distinct concepts, and one need not imply the other. According to traditional neoclassical economic theory, in a competitive market economy, ownership of capital assets by labor (the workforce of a given firm) should have no significant impact on firm performance.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Samuelson, Wages and Interest: A Modern Dissection of Marxian Economic Models, 47 AM.ECON.REV. 884, 894 (1957): "In a perfectly competitive market it really doesn’t matter who hires whom: so have labor hire ‘capital’...”)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[classical liberal]] philosopher John Stuart Mill believed that worker-run and owned cooperatives would eventually displace traditional capitalist (capital-managed) firms in the competitive market economy due to their superior efficiency and stronger incentive structure. While both Mill and Karl Marx thought that democratic worker management would be more efficient in the long run compared with hierarchical management, Marx was not hopeful about the prospects of labor-managed and owned firms as a means to displace traditional capitalist firms in the market economy.&lt;ref name="Market Economies 2011"&gt;''Where Did Mill Go Wrong?: Why the Capital-Managed Firm Rather than the Labor-Managed Enterprise Is the Predominant Organizational Form in Market Economies'', by Schwartz, Justin. 2011. Ohio State Law Journal, vol. 73, no. 2, 2012: "Why, then, is the predominant form of industrial organization in market societies the traditional capital-owned and managed firm (the capitalist firm) rather than the labor-managed enterprise owned and managed by the workers (the cooperative)? This is exactly the opposite of the result predicted by John Stuart Mill over 150 years ago. He thought that such worker-run cooperative associations would eventually crowd capitalist firms out of the market because of their superior efficiency and other advantages for workers."&lt;/ref&gt; In Western market economies, despite their advantages in efficiency, the labor-managed firm is comparatively rare.&lt;ref&gt;''Where Did Mill Go Wrong?: Why the Capital-Managed Firm Rather than the Labor-Managed Enterprise Is the Predominant Organizational Form in Market Economies'', by Schwartz, Justin. 2011. Ohio State Law Journal, vol. 73, no. 2, 2012: "Mill was mistaken, and Marx correct, at least about the tendency for labor-managed firms to displace capital-managed firms in the ordinary operation of the market."&lt;/ref&gt;

Benjamin Ward critiqued the labor managed firm's objective function. According to Ward, the labor-managed firm strives to maximize net income for all its members, as contrasted with the traditional capitalist firms' objective function of maximizing profit for external owners. The objective function of the labor managed firm creates an incentive to limit employment in order to boost the net income of the firm's existing members. An economy consisting of labor-managed firms would thus have a tendency to under-utilize labor and tend toward high rates of unemployment.

=== Classical economics ===
In the 19th century, the idea of a self-managed economy was first fully articulated by the [[anarchist]] philosopher and economist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Proudhon|first=Pierre-Joseph|title='Oeuvres Complètes', volume 17|year=1866–1876|publisher=Lacroix|location=Paris|pages=188–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; This economic model was called ''[[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]]'' to highlight the mutual relationship among individuals in this system (in contrast to the "parasitism" of capitalist society) and involved cooperatives operating in a [[free-market]] economy.

The [[classical liberal]] philosopher John Stuart Mill argued worker-run cooperatives would eventually displace traditional capitalist (capital-managed) firms in the competitive market economy due to their superior efficiency.&lt;ref name="Market Economies 2011"/&gt;

[[Karl Marx]] championed the idea of a "[[Free association (communism and anarchism)|free association of producers]]" as a characteristic of [[communist society]], where self-management processes replaced the traditional notion of the centralized state. This concept is related to the Marxist idea of transcending [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= O'Hara|first= Phillip |title= Encyclopedia of Political Economy, Volume 2 |publisher= Routledge|date=September 2003|isbn= 0-415-24187-1|pages = 836|quote=it influenced Marx to champion the ideas of a "free association of producers" and of self-management replacing the centralized state.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Soviet-type economies ===
The [[Soviet-type economic planning|Soviet-type economic model]] as practiced in the former [[Soviet Union]] and [[Eastern bloc]] is criticized by socialists for its lack of widespread self-management and management input on the part of workers in [[Enterprises in the Soviet Union|enterprises]]. However, according to both the Bolshevik view and Marx's own perspective, a full transformation of the work process can only occur after technical progress has eliminated dreary and repetitive work - a state of affairs that had not yet been achieved even in the advanced Western economies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ellman |first=Michael |title=Socialist Planning |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1989 |isbn=0-521-35866-3 |page=312 |quote=In general, it seems reasonable to say that the state socialist countries have made no progress whatsoever towards organizing the labour process so as to end the division between the scientist and the process workers. This is scarcely surprising, both in view of the Bolshevik attitude toward Taylorism and in view of Marx’s own thesis that a society in which the labour process has been transformed would be one in which technical progress had eliminated dreary, repetitive, work. Such a state of affairs has not yet been reached in even the most advanced countries.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Management science ==
In his book ''[[Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us]]'', [[Daniel H. Pink]] argues on the basis of empirical evidence that self-management/self-directed processes, mastery, worker autonomy and purpose (defined as intrinsic rewards) are much more effective incentives than [[Money|monetary]] gain (extrinsic rewards). According to Pink, for the vast majority of work in the 21st century, self-management and related intrinsic incentives are far more crucial than outdated notions of hierarchical management and an over-reliance on monetary compensation as reward.

Worker self-management became a primary component of some [[trade unions|trade union]] organizations, in particular [[anarcho-syndicalism|revolutionary syndicalism]] which was introduced in late 19th century France, and [[guild socialism]] in early 20th century Britain, although both movements collapsed in the early 1920s. French trade-union [[Confédération Française Démocratique du Travail|CFDT]] (''Confédération Française Démocratique du Travail'') included worker self-management in its 1970 program, before later abandoning it. The philosophy of workers' self-management has been promoted by the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW) since its founding in the United States in 1905.

Critics of workers' self-management from the left such as [[Gilles Dauvé]] and [[Jacques Camatte]] do not admonish the model as [[reactionary]], but simply as not [[progressivism|progressive]] in the context of developed [[capitalism]]. Such critics suggest that capitalism is more than a relationship of management. Rather, they suggest capitalism should be considered as a social totality which workers' self-management in and of itself only perpetuates and does not challenge – despite its seemingly radical content and activity. This theory is used to explain why self-management in Yugoslavia never advanced beyond the confines of the larger state monopoly economy, or why many modern worker-owned facilities tend to return to hiring managers and accountants after only a few years of operation.

[[Guild socialism]] is a political movement advocating [[workers' control]] of industry through the medium of trade-related [[guilds]] "in an implied contractual relationship with the public".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/248652/Guild-Socialism "Guild Socialism".  Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2012. Web. 31 May. 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; It originated in the [[United Kingdom]] and was at its most influential in the first quarter of the 20th century. It was strongly associated with [[G. D. H. Cole]] and influenced by the ideas of [[William Morris]].
One significant experiment with workers' self-management took place during the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Revolution]] (1936–1939).&lt;ref name=Dolgoff1974&gt;{{Citation

In the 1950s, at the height of the [[Cold War]], [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] advocated what was officially called ''socialist self-management'' in distinction from the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries, all of which practiced [[central planning]] and centralized management of their economies. The [[economy of SFRY|economy of Yugoslavia]] was organized according to the theories of [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]] and &amp;ndash; more directly &amp;ndash; [[Edvard Kardelj]]. [[Croatia]]n scientist [[Branko Horvat]] also made a significant contribution to the theory of workers' self-management (''radničko samoupravljanje'') as practiced in Yugoslavia. Due to Yugoslavia's neutrality and its leading role in the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], Yugoslav companies exported to both Western and Eastern markets. Yugoslav companies carried out construction of numerous major infrastructural and industrial projects in Africa, Europe and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Liotta|first=P.H.|title=Paradigm Lost :Yugoslav Self-Management and the Economics of Disaster|url=http://balkanologie.revues.org/index681.html|accessdate=18 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Yugoslavia: Introduction of Socialist Self-Management|url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-14787.html|publisher=Country Data|accessdate=18 August 2010|date=December 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[May 1968 in France|May 68]] in [[France]], [[LIP factory]], a clockwork factory based in [[Besançon]], became self-managed starting in 1973 after the management's decision to liquidate it. The LIP experience was an emblematic social conflict of post-68 in France. [[Confédération Française Démocratique du Travail|CFDT]] (the CCT as it was referred to in Northern Spain), trade-unionist [[Charles Piaget]] led the strike in which workers claimed the [[means of production]]. The [[Unified Socialist Party (France)|Unified Socialist Party]] (PSU), which included former [[Radical and Socialist Party (France)|Radical]] [[Pierre Mendès-France]], was in favour of ''autogestión'' or self-management.&lt;ref name=Halimi&gt;[http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/carnet/2007-03-20-LIP LIP, l'imagination au pouvoir], article by [[Serge Halimi]] in ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'', 20 March 2007 {{Fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] of Spain, the [[Mondragon Cooperative Corporation]] represents perhaps the longest lasting and most successful example of workers' self-management in the world.  It has been touted by a diverse group of people, such as the [[Marxian economics|Marxian economist]] [[Richard D. Wolff]] and the research book "Capital and the Debt Trap"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sanchez Bajo|first1=Claudia|last2=Roelants|first2=Bruno|title=Capital and the Debt Trap: learning from cooperatives in the global crisis|url=http://www.capital-and-the-debt-trap.com/|publisher=Palgrave MacMillan|accessdate=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an example of how the economy can be organized on an alternative to the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard D.

Retrieved 15 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2010s, due to the [[Eurocrisis|economic crisis]] in [[Greece]], a number of factories have been occupied and have become self-managed along the lines of autogestión.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenation.com/blog/172960/greek-workers-take-over-factory-interview&lt;/ref&gt;

=== North America ===

During the [[Great Depression]], worker and utility cooperatives flourished to the point that more than half of U.S. farmers belonged to a cooperative.  In general worker cooperatives and cooperative banking institutions were formed across the country and became a thriving alternative for workers and customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://newdeal.feri.org/tva/tva10.htm# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-02-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130133336/http://newdeal.feri.org/tva/tva10.htm# |archive-date=2009-01-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://jonathanrowe.org/money-cooperative-economy-in-the-great-depression&lt;/ref&gt; Now,{{when|date=September 2014}} due to the economic downturn and stagnation in the [[rustbelt]], worker cooperatives such as the [[Evergreen Cooperatives]] have been formed in response, inspired by Mondragon.

In October 2005 the first ''Encuentro Latinoamericano de Empresas Recuperadas'' ("Latin American  Encounter of Recovered Companies") took place in [[Caracas]], [[Venezuela]], with representatives of 263 such companies from different countries living through similar economical and social situations. The meeting had, as its main outcome, the ''Compromiso de Caracas'' (Caracas' Commitment); a vindicating text of the movement.
[[File:Hotel bauen.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Hotel Bauen]] in Buenos Aires, occupied and self-managed since 2003.]]

====The ''fábricas recuperadas'' movement====
[[File:Autogestion.jpg|thumb|right|Poster for the Movimiento Nacional de Empresas Recuperadas (MNER), at a worker-recovered print shop, Chilavert Artes Gráficas in [[Buenos Aires]]]]

English-language discussions of this phenomenon may employ several different translations of the original Spanish expression other than ''recovered factory''. For example, ''worker-recuperated enterprise'', ''recuperated factory/business'',''worker-recovered factory/business'', ''reclaimed factory'', and ''worker-run factory'' have been noted. The phenomenon is also known as "autogestión," which comes from the French word for self-management (applied to factories, [[popular education]] systems, and other uses). Worker self-management may coincide with [[employee ownership]].

Argentina's ''fábricas recuperadas'' movement, which emerged in response to Argentine's [[Argentine economic crisis|2001 economic crisis]],&lt;ref name="Galafassi2004p222"/&gt; is the current most significant workers' self-management phenomenon in the world. Workers took over control of the factories in which they had worked, commonly after [[bankruptcy]], or after a [[Occupation of factories|factory occupation]] to circumvent a [[lockout (industry)|lockout]].

''Fábricas recuperadas'' means "reclaimed/recovered factories." The Spanish verb ''recuperar'' means not only "to get back", "to take back" or "to reclaim" but also "to put back into good condition". Although initially referring to industrial facilities, the term may also apply to businesses other than factories (e.g. [[Hotel Bauen]] in [[Buenos Aires]]).

Throughout the 1990s in [[History of Argentina|Argentina]]'s southern province of [[Neuquén Province|Neuquén]], drastic economic and political events occurred where the citizens ultimately rose up.  Although the first shift occurred in a single factory, bosses were progressively fired throughout the province so that by 2005 the workers of the province controlled most of the factories.

The movement emerged as a response to Argentine's [[Argentine economic crisis|2001 economic crisis]],&lt;ref name="Galafassi2004p222"&gt;Guido Galafassi, Paula Lenguita, Robinson Salazar Perez (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=XLTEMYfB4bEC&amp;pg=PA239 ''Nuevas Practicas Politicas Insumisas En Argentina''] pp.222, 238&lt;/ref&gt; and about 200 Argentine companies were "recovered" by their workers and turned into co-operatives. Prominent examples include the [[Brukman factory]], the [[Hotel Bauen]] and [[FaSinPat]] (formerly known as Zanon). As of 2005, about 15,000 Argentine workers run recovered factories.

The phenomenon of ''fabricas recuperadas'' ("recovered factories") is not new in Argentina. Rather, such [[social movement]]s were completely dismantled during the so-called "[[Dirty War]]" in the 1970s. Thus, during [[Héctor Cámpora]]'s first months of government (May–July 1973), a rather moderate and left-wing [[Peronist]], approximately 600 social conflicts, strikes and factory occupations had taken place.&lt;ref&gt;Hugo Moreno, ''Le désastre argentin. Péronisme, politique et violence sociale (1930–2001)'', [[Editions Syllepses]], Paris, 2005, p. 109 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many recovered factories are run co-operatively and all workers receive the same [[wage]]. Important management decisions are taken [[direct democracy|democratically]] by an assembly of all workers, rather than by professional managers.

The proliferation of these "recoveries" has led to the formation of a '''recovered factory movement''', which has ties to a diverse political network including [[socialists]], [[Peronists]], [[anarchists]] and [[communists]]. Organizationally, this includes two major federations of recovered factories, the larger [https://web.archive.org/web/20070219083133/http://www.mnerweb.com.ar/ Movimiento Nacional de Empresas Recuperadas] (or National Movement of Recuperated Businesses, or MNER) on the left and the smaller National Movement of Recuperated Factories (MNFR)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fabricasrecuperadas.org.ar/ Movimiento Nacional de Fabricas Recuperadas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070218152458/http://www.fabricasrecuperadas.org.ar/ |date=2007-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; on the right.&lt;ref&gt;Marie Trigona, [https://zcomm.org/zblogs/reversing-the-logic-of-capitalism-by-marie-trigona/ Recuperated Enterprises in Argentina – Reversing the Logic of Capitalism], Znet, March 27, 2006 {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[labor union]]s, unemployed protestors (known as [[piquetero]]s), traditional [[worker cooperative]]s and a range of political groups have also provided support for these take-overs. In March 2003, with the help of the MNER, former employees of the luxury [[Hotel Bauen]] occupied the building and took control of it.

One of the highest difficulties such a movement faces is its relation towards the classic [[economic]] system, as most classically managed firms refused,{{Verify source|date=June 2010}} for various reasons (among which ideological hostility to the very principle of autogestión) to work and deal with recovered factories. Thus, isolated recovered factories find it easier to work together in building an alternative, more [[economic democracy|democratic economic system]] and thus manage to reach a critical size and power which enables it to negotiate with the ordinary capitalistic firms.

The movement led in 2011 to a new [[bankruptcy]] law that facilitates take over by the workers.&lt;ref&gt;Pagina12: [http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/suplementos/cash/35-5106-2011-04-17.html ''Nueva Ley de Quiebras''] (April 2011), [http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/economia/2-169306-2011-06-02.html ''Fábricas recuperadas y también legales''] (June 2nd 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation was signed into law by President [[Cristina Kirchner]] on June 29, 2011.&lt;ref name="Pagina1220110629"&gt;[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/ultimas/20-171094-2011-06-29.html ''CFK promulgó la reforma de la Ley de Quiebras''] in ''[[Página/12]]'', June 29, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
