The '''1977 London-Sydney Marathon''', officially '''Singapore Airlines London-Sydney Rally''' was the second running of the [[London-Sydney Marathon]]. The rally took place between the 14th of August and the 27th of September 1977. The event covered 19,000 miles (30,000km) through [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and [[Australia]]. It was won by [[Andrew Cowan]], Colin Malkin and Mike Broad, driving a [[Mercedes-Benz W123|Mercedes-Benz 280E]].

==Background==
The success of the [[1968 London-Sydney Marathon]] would inspired Australian advertising publicist Wylton Dickson, who had no previous links to rallying to organised the [[World Cup Rally]], which took place in [[1970 London to Mexico World Cup Rally|1970]] and again in [[1974 London–Sahara–Munich World Cup Rally|1974]]. But following the controversy over the running of the 1974 event, the [[World Cup Rally]] was cancelled and Dickson decided to organise another London to Sydney Marathon in 1977, with sponsorship from [[Singapore Airlines]], who were celebrating their 30th Anniversary, by running the longest car rally in history. The route would see competitors cross Europe and Asia in the first twelve days of the event before the cars would be shipped from [[India]] to [[Malaysia]] with competitors driving through the country and into [[Singapore]] for the next eleven days before being shipped to Australia for the last seven days of the rally.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7494">{{Merge|Crisis in Venezuela|date=August 2018}}

The Venezuelan economic crisis also known as Great Depression in Venezuela&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elestimulo.com/elinteres/la-gran-depresion-economica-de-venezuela/|title=La crisis venezolana ya tiene nombre: Gran depresión económica|date=23 October 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, refers to the deterioration that began to be noticed in the main macroeconomic indicators from the year 2012, and whose consequences have extended in time to the present, not only economically but also politically and socially.

== Origins ==
{{transcluded section|source=Crisis in Venezuela (2012–present)}}
{{Trim|{{#section-h:Economy of Venezuela|2013–present}}}}

== Prices ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}
Due to the lack of its own resources, Venezuela has traditionally exported all its oil abroad, so the [[Price of oil|energy crisis of 2014]] produced a strong inflationary trend. In June 2013, accumulated inflation in the last twelve months was 56.2%. The sharp drop between 2014 and 2016 in the price of oil, sparked fears of a risk of hyperinflation. In 2015, Venezuela reached the highest inflation rate in the last 35 years, and in March 2016 there was hyperinflation for the first time in recorded history. In October 2016, the economy continued to contract while inflation increased again. Between 2017 and 2018, prices rose 2616% - this increase combined with austerity measures and high unemployment negatively impacted the living standards of Venezuelans. At the same time the average wages decreased (real) and the purchasing power was significantly reduced.

== Employment crisis ==

After having completed substantial improvements over the second half of the 1990s and during the 2000s, which put a few regions on the brink of full employment, Venezuela suffered a severe setback in 2015, when it saw its unemployment rate surging to 1994 levels.

Venezuelan's unemployment rate hit 17.4% at the end of June 2017, with the jobless total now having doubled over the past 12 months, when two million people lost their jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archivo.entornointeligente.com/articulo/10183731/Central-obrera-cifra-en-185-la-tasa-de-desempleo-en-Venezuela-26062017/|title=Central obrera cifra en 18,5% la tasa de desempleo en Venezuela |work=EntornoInteligente|date=26 June 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public debt ==

Public debt, which in 2010 represented 34.62% of GDP, doubled in three years, standing at 52.1% in 2013, reaching 52.98% of Gross Domestic Product in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.actualitix.com/country/ven/venezuela-public-debt-per-gdp.php|title=Venezuela - Public debt (% of GDP) - 2016|website=en.actualitix.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the risk premium began to skyrocket at the end of 2014 to a record high of 3,181 points, increasing fears of a possible IMF bailout of Venezuela. The risk premium set a record in August 2017, recording 5,000 basic points exceeding eight times Greece's risk premium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eleconomista.es/economia/noticias/8536568/08/17/Venezuela-dispara-su-riesgo-de-impago-es-ocho-veces-superior-al-de-Grecia.html|title=Venezuela dispara su riesgo de impago: es ocho veces superior al de Grecia - elEconomista.es|first=|last=elEconomista.es|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ratings ==

In the beginning of the crisis, Venezuela's credit ratings were downgraded to "junk territory" or below [[investment grade]] with negative outlooks according to most rating agencies.&lt;ref name=AJdec2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=WSJseptDOWNGRADE&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dulaney|first1=Chelsey|last2=Vyas|first2=Kejal|title=S&amp;P Downgrades Venezuela on Worsening Economy Rising Inflation, Economic Pressures Prompt Rating Cut|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/s-p-downgrades-venezuela-on-worsening-economy-1410907125|accessdate=18 September 2014|agency=The Wall Street Journal|date=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MOODYSdec2013/&gt; In a little more than one year, [[Standard and Poor's]] downgraded Venezuela's credit rating three times; from B+ to B in June 2013,&lt;ref name=REUTERSjune2013&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bases|first1=Daniel|title=Update 2 – S&amp;P downgrades Venezuela's sovereign credit rating to B|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/17/venezuela-downgrade-standardandpoors-idUSL2N0ET0Z120130617|accessdate=18 September 2014|agency=Reuters|date=17 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; B to B- in December 2013&lt;ref name=AJdec2013&gt;{{cite news|title=S&amp;P cuts Venezuela credit rating to B-minus|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2013/12/sp-cuts-venezuela-credit-rating-b-minus-2013121323213836870.html|accessdate=18 September 2014|agency=Al Jazeera|date=13 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from B- to CCC+ in September 2014.&lt;ref name=WSJseptDOWNGRADE/&gt; [[Fitch Ratings]] also lowered each of Venezuela's credit ratings in March 2014 from B+ to B&lt;ref name=REUTERSmarch2013CR&gt;{{cite news|title=Fitch Downgrades Venezuela to 'B'; Outlook Negative|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/25/fitch-downgrades-venezuela-to-b-outlook-idUSFit69472120140325|accessdate=18 September 2014|agency=Reuters.|date=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even lower from B to CCC in December 2014.&lt;ref name=FITCHdec2014&gt;{{cite news|title=Fitch Downgrades Venezuela's IDRs to 'CCC'|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/18/fitch-downgrades-venezuelas-idrs-to-ccc-idUSFit87570120141218|accessdate=19 December 2014|agency=Reuters|date=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2013, [[Moody's Investors Service]] also downgraded both Venezuela's local (B1) and foreign currency (B2) ratings to Caa1.&lt;ref name=MOODYSdec2013&gt;{{cite web|title=Moody's downgrades Venezuela to Caa1; outlook negative|url=https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-downgrades-Venezuela-to-Caa1-outlook-negative--PR_289285|website=Moody's Investors Service|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The noted reasons of credit rating changes were the greatly increased likelihood of economic and financial collapse due to the Venezuelan government's policies and an "out of control" inflation rate.&lt;ref name=WSJseptDOWNGRADE/&gt;&lt;ref name=MOODYSdec2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=REUTERSmarch2013CR/&gt;

In July 2017, Standard &amp; Poor's lowered both the domestic and foreign credit ratings of Venezuela to CCC- due to the increasing risk of default.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Venezuela Cut Deeper Into Junk by S&amp;P|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-11/venezuela-cut-deeper-into-junk-by-s-p-as-default-risk-surges|accessdate=12 July 2017|work=[[Bloomberg.com]]|date=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fitch Ratings followed suit in August 2017, lowering local and foreign credit ratings to CC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=DeFotis|first1=Dimitra|title=Venezuela Bond Default ‘Probable’ Fitch Downgrade Says|url=http://www.barrons.com/articles/venezuela-bond-default-probable-fitch-downgrade-says-1504129573|accessdate=31 August 2017|work=[[Barron's (newspaper)|Barron's]]|date=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2017 Standard &amp; Poor's rated Venezuela in technical default and Fitch ratings rated Venezuela's oil company PDVSA in restrictive default - one rank above full default.{{CN|date=June 2018}}

On April 12, 2015, [[Baltimore Police Department]] officers arrested Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old [[African Americans|African American]] resident of [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]].  Gray sustained injuries to his neck and spine while in transport in a police vehicle.  On April 18, 2015, after Gray's subsequent coma, the residents of Baltimore protested in front of the Western district police station.&lt;ref name=Fenton/&gt;&lt;ref name=Valcourt/&gt; Gray [[Death of Freddie Gray|died the following day]], April 19, 2015, a week after the arrest.

Further protests were organized after Gray's death became public knowledge, amid the police department's continuing inability to adequately or consistently explain the events following the arrest and the injuries.  Spontaneous protests started after the funeral service, although several included violent elements.  Civil unrest continued with at least twenty police officers injured, at least 250 people arrested, 285 to 350 businesses damaged, 150 vehicle fires, 60 structure fires,&lt;ref name=WaPo_damages&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/damage-to-businesses-from-baltimore-rioting-estimated-at-9-million/2015/05/13/5848c3fe-f9a8-11e4-a13c-193b1241d51a_story.html |title=Damage to businesses from Baltimore rioting estimated at about $9 million |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=May 13, 2015 |author=Wenger, Yvonne |accessdate=August 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 27 drugstores looted,&lt;ref name=NYT_June12&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/13/us/after-freddie-gray-death-west-baltimores-police-presence-drops-and-murders-soar.html?ref=todayspaper&amp;_r=3 |title=West Baltimore's Police Presence Drops, and Murders Soar |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 12, 2015 |author=Oppel, Richard A.

==Events==
===April 12: Gray's arrest===
On April 12, 2015, Freddie Carlos Gray, Jr., a 25-year-old African-American man, was arrested by the Baltimore City Police Department in the 1700 block of Presbury Street in the [[Sandtown-Winchester, Baltimore|Sandtown-Winchester neighborhood]].&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Gray was seen to be in good health at the time of the arrest. While being transported in a police van, Gray sustained injuries to his neck, including his vocal box and spinal cord. He fell into a coma and was taken to a trauma center. The BCPD could not immediately account for the injuries and released contradictory and inconsistent information regarding the timeline of the arrest, transportation and whether Gray had received appropriately prompt medical treatment.&lt;ref name=Fenton/&gt;&lt;ref name=Valcourt/&gt; On May 23, 2016, officer Edward Nero was found not guilty of all charges against him in connection with the death of Freddie Gray.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fieldstadt|first1=Elisha|title=Officer Charged in Freddie Gray Case, Edward Nero, Not Guilty on All Counts|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/baltimore-unrest/officer-freddie-gray-death-edward-nero-not-guilty-all-counts-n578676|publisher=NBC News|accessdate=May 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after that, the remaining officers who had not yet stood trial had all charges against them dropped.

===April 18–24: Protests begin===
On April 18, 2015, immediately outside the Western District police station, hundreds of Baltimore citizens protested against the apparent mistreatment of Freddie Gray as well against inadequate and inconsistent information on police actions during the arrest and transport. Gray died at approximately 7am on April 19, 2015.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Timeline: Freddie Gray's arrest, death and the aftermath - Baltimore Sun|url = http://data.baltimoresun.com/news/freddie-gray/|website = data.baltimoresun.com|accessdate = 2015-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that day, in response to Gray's death, Baltimore City Police Commissioner, Anthony Batts said, "I extend my deepest sympathies to his family" while also saying, "All Lives Matter" in a nod to the "Black Lives Matter" mantra shouted at protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/freddie-gray/bs-md-freddie-gray-20150419-story.html|title=Freddie Gray dies a week after being injured during arrest|last=Sun|first=Baltimore|website=baltimoresun.com|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protests continued during six nights in Baltimore's streets. On April 21, 2015, the [[Baltimore Police Department|Baltimore City Police Department]] released the identities of the six officers involved in Gray's arrest.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; That evening, protesters marched from the site of Gray's arrest to the Western District police station.

On April 25, 2015, protests were organized in [[downtown Baltimore]]. Protesters marched from the [[Baltimore City Hall]] to the Inner [[Inner Harbor|Harbor]]. After the final stage of the official protest event, some people became violent, damaging at least five police vehicles and [[criminal rock throwing|pelting police with rocks]].&lt;ref name=Stolberg&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stolberg|first1=Sheryl Grey|title=National Guard Activated in Baltimore as Police and Youths Clash After Funeral for Freddie Gray|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/28/us/a-call-for-peace-before-freddie-grays-funeral-in-baltimore.html|accessdate=April 28, 2015|work=The New York Times|date=August 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Near [[Oriole Park at Camden Yards]], some groups of violent protesters also smashed storefronts and fought with baseball fans arriving at the stadium for a scheduled game between the [[Baltimore Orioles]] and [[Boston Red Sox|the Boston Red Sox]].

During a press conference, Baltimore mayor [[Stephanie Rawlings-Blake]] said, "most protesters were respectful but a small group of agitators intervened".&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; She also stated that "It's a very delicate balancing act. Because while we try to make sure that they were protected from the cars and other things that were going on, we also gave those who wished to destroy space to do that as well. And we worked very hard to keep that balance and to put ourselves in the best position to de-escalate."&lt;ref&gt;[http://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2015/04/25/baltimore-mayor-gave-those-who-wished-to-destroy-space-to-do-that/ Baltimore Mayor: ‘Gave Those Who Wished to Destroy Space to Do That’], CBS News Baltimore, April 25, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase "we also gave those who wished to destroy space to do that as well" was interpreted by some conservative-leaning news sources&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Two days later, the mayor's Director of Strategic Planning and Policy, Howard Libit, released a statement clarifying the mayor's remarks:

{{Quote|text=What she is saying within this statement was that there was an effort to give the peaceful demonstrators room to conduct their peaceful protests on Saturday. Unfortunately, as a result of providing the peaceful demonstrators with the space to share their message, that also meant that those seeking to incite violence also had the space to operate. The police sought to balance the rights of the peaceful demonstrators against the need to step in against those who were seeking to create violence.

The mayor is not saying that she asked police to give space to people who sought to create violence. Any suggestion otherwise would be a misinterpretation of her statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

According to eyewitness reports,&lt;ref name=Brodey/&gt; expecting the "purge" to start at 3 p.m., Baltimore police pre-emptively de-boarded all buses going through the area, shut down the nearby [[Mondawmin (Baltimore Metro Subway station)|Mondawmin Metro station]] and cordoned off the area around the mall. Eyewitnesses saw police detain students in that general area. The police, in full riot gear, detained the students for a full half-hour before the first brick was thrown. Meghann Harris, a teacher in the Baltimore school system, said on [[Facebook]], "If I were a Douglass[sic] student that just got trapped in the middle of a minefield BY cops without any way to get home and completely in harm's way, I'd be ready to pop off, too."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2015/04/28/the-baltimore-riots-and-the-significant-distrust-of-police-in-america/ | title=Just one in four urban black Americans trust the police | work=The Washington Post | date=April 28, 2015 | accessdate=April 30, 2015 | first=Philip |last=Bump}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Afternoon and evening====
At &lt;time datetime="2015-04-28 12:00"&gt;12:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;/time&gt; in the area where Freddie Gray was arrested, volunteers numbering in the hundreds were seen cleaning up debris left from the rioting.&lt;ref name=APapril28/&gt; Police blocked off some of the area to assist with the cleanup while hardware stores in the neighborhood donated trash bags and brooms and city workers drove in trucks to carry away piles of trash and shattered glass.&lt;ref name=APapril28/&gt;

At &lt;time datetime="2015-04-28 12:55"&gt;12:55&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;/time&gt;, President Obama stated that there have been too many worrying interactions between police and black citizens, but said there was "no excuse" for the violence of rioters in Baltimore. At about 1:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., crowds gathered at a damaged drug store where Rev. [[Jesse Jackson]] was visiting, with Jackson stating, "It was painful because it destroyed a lot of neighborhood businesses and hurt a lot of people, but the violence is driven by that alienation." At a &lt;time datetime="2015-04-28 14:30"&gt;2:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;/time&gt; speaking event by Capt. Eric Kowalczyk discussing incidents that occurred on April 27, demonstrators gathered peacefully, though one individual was arrested and pepper spray was used when some protesters became disorderly. At &lt;time datetime="2015-04-28 15:00"&gt;3:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;/time&gt;, Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake took back comments calling rioters "thugs", saying that occasionally, "my little anger interpreter gets the best of me." Baltimore religious leaders announced that 14 churches throughout the city were open to give food to children that relied on schools to provide daily meals.&lt;ref name=APapril28point5&gt;{{cite news|title=LATEST ON POLICE-CUSTODY DEATH: COURT WAITS COULD INCREASE |url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/2015/The-latest-on-Baltimore-police-custody-death-More-than-150-fires-in-Baltimore-city-says/id-0b32a37d8b0440b8a444403f5c7ad647 |accessdate=April 29, 2015 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=April 29, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429101411/http://www.apnewsarchive.com/2015/The-latest-on-Baltimore-police-custody-death-More-than-150-fires-in-Baltimore-city-says/id-0b32a37d8b0440b8a444403f5c7ad647 |archivedate=April 29, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At &lt;time datetime="2015-04-28 20:30"&gt;8:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;/time&gt;, the CEO of Baltimore City Public Schools, Gregory Thornton, announced that Baltimore City Public School classes and after-school events would occur on April 29. Just before &lt;time datetime="2015-04-28 21:00"&gt;9:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;/time&gt;, several hundred protesters gathered around the CVS store that was looted, with some individuals separating the protesters and police, while a local pastor told demonstrators over a loud speaker to respect the curfew, saying, "Let's show the world, because the eyes of the world are on Baltimore right now." A police spokesman, Captain Eric Kowalczyk, stated that authorities were attempting to inform Baltimore residents of the &lt;time datetime="2015-04-28 22:00"&gt;10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;/time&gt; curfew in multiple ways, through police in patrol cars, sending messages through a police helicopter over the city and by calling residents through a [[Reverse 911]] system.&lt;ref name=APapril28point5/&gt;

At &lt;time datetime="2015-04-28 22:15"&gt;10:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;/time&gt;, hundreds of demonstrators, some throwing bottles at police, remained in the streets while police in riot gear began to move the crowds with speakers from helicopters overhead broadcasting, "You must go home. You cannot remain here. You will be subject to arrest." Tensions began to grow after individuals began to throw objects at police. Shortly after &lt;time datetime="2015-04-28 22:30"&gt;10:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;/time&gt;, smoke bombs or fireworks were thrown from the crowd and police equipped with riot shields began to slowly advance on the gathering with some people beginning to disperse. At &lt;time datetime="2015-04-28 22:32"&gt;10:32&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;/time&gt;, Baltimore Police tweeted that "Officers are now deploying pepper balls at the aggressive crowd". They then tweeted at &lt;time datetime="2015-04-28 22:34"&gt;10:34&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;/time&gt; "People who remain on the street – who do not meet the exceptions – are now in violation of the emergency curfew" with police moving across the intersection and the crowd dispersing down side streets away from the area. At &lt;time datetime="2015-04-28 22:50"&gt;10:50&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;/time&gt;, military vehicles were seen driving through the streets to disperse the remaining crowd numbered with dozens of people. At &lt;time datetime="2015-04-28 23:00"&gt;11:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;/time&gt;, the CVS intersection was clear except for police and media workers who were exempt from the curfew. At &lt;time datetime="2015-04-28 23:40"&gt;11:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;/time&gt;, Baltimore Police Commissioner Anthony Batts stated that the curfew seemed to work and that ten people were arrested; seven for violating the curfew, two people for looting and one for disorderly conduct.&lt;ref name=APapril28point5/&gt;

Between start of curfew and late night, thirty-five people, including one juvenile, had been arrested for violating the curfew.&lt;ref name="aljazeera"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/4/29/baltimore-schools-set-to-reopen-after-quiet-night.html|title=Second Night of Baltimore Curfew Arrives Quietly|work=Al Jazeera America|date=April 29, 2015|accessdate=May 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charges filed, acquittals, and charges dropped==
On May 1, 2015, after receiving a medical examiner's report ruling Gray's death a [[homicide]], state prosecutors said that they had probable cause to file criminal charges against the six officers involved. Mosby said that the Baltimore police had acted illegally and that "No crime had been committed [by Freddie Gray]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/01/baltimore-freddie-gray-death |title= Freddie Gray death: cries of 'justice' in Baltimore after six officers charged |date= May 1, 2015 |access-date= May 1, 2015 |work= The Guardian |first1= Jon |last1=Swaine |first2= Oliver |last2=Laughland |first3= Raya |last3=Jalabi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mosby said that Gray "suffered a critical neck injury as a result of being handcuffed, shackled by his feet and unrestrained inside the BPD wagon."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=6 Baltimore Police Officers Charged in Freddie Gray Death|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/02/us/freddie-gray-autopsy-report-given-to-baltimore-prosecutors.html|accessdate=May 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/01/us-usa-police-baltimore-idUSKBN0NL1GO20150501|title=Six Baltimore police officers face murder, other charges in death of black man|agency=Reuters|accessdate=May 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mosby said officers had "failed to establish probable cause for Mr. Gray's arrest, as no crime had been committed",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Alan |last1=Blinder |first2=Richard |last2=Perez-Pena|title=6 Baltimore Police Officers Charged in Freddie Gray Death|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/02/us/freddie-gray-autopsy-report-given-to-baltimore-prosecutors.html|website=New York Times|accessdate=May 1, 2015|date=May 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and charged officers with [[false imprisonment]], because Gray was carrying a [[pocket knife]] of legal size, and not the switchblade police claimed he had possessed at the time of his arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freddie Gray: Baltimore police to face criminal charges|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-32554371|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=May 1, 2015|date=May 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; All six officers were taken into custody and processed at Baltimore Central Booking and Intake Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-freddie-gray-mosby-presser-0502-20150501-story.html#page=1|title=Six officers charged in death of Freddie Gray|work=The Baltimore Sun|accessdate=May 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Six officers charged in death of Freddie Gray|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-freddie-gray-mosby-presser-0502-20150501-story.html#page=1|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|accessdate=May 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial of Officer William G.

Alicia White, and the driver of the van, Officer Caesar Goodson Jr. The trials ran into significant delays due to multiple motions being filed by both sides in the cases. On May 23, 2016, Officer Edward Nero was found not guilty on all four counts he was charged with, including two counts of misconduct in office, misdemeanor reckless endangerment, and misdemeanor assault in the second degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fenton|first1=Justin|last2=Rector|first2=Kevin|title=Freddie Gray case: Baltimore Police Officer Edward Nero found not guilty of all charges|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/freddie-gray/bs-md-ci-nero-verdict-20160521-story.html|website=baltimoresun.com|publisher=The Baltimore Sun|accessdate=31 May 2016|date=May 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Nero, two others officers were subsequently [[Acquittal|acquitted]]. In July 2016, following the acquittals, Baltimore City State's Attorney [[Marilyn Mosby]] dropped charges against Porter and the remaining two officers.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

Anti-police brutality protests were also held in [[Denver]] in solidarity with the Baltimore protests. Eleven people were arrested on April 29, 2015 following physical altercations in which police used pepper spray on protesters who rallied around [[Colfax Avenue]] and Broadway street.

After Baltimore police determined there was a "credible threat" of [[gang violence]] against police officers across the country, many departments across the US heightened their security in response: for example the Los Angeles Police Department ordered their officers to ride in pairs.&lt;ref name="lati_LAPD"&gt;{{cite web| title = LAPD officers to ride in pairs after Baltimore police warn of gang threat| last = Winton | first = Richard| work = Los Angeles Times| date = April 27, 2015| accessdate = April 27, 2015| url = http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-lapd-ride-in-pairs--20150427-story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baltimore police claimed evidence to support the idea that the [[Black Guerrilla Family]], the [[Bloods]], and the [[Crips]] were "teaming up" to target police officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/blog/bs-md-ci-freddie-gray-gang-threat-20150427-story.html|title=Baltimore police say gangs 'teaming up' to take out officers|date=April 27, 2015|work=The Baltimore Sun|accessdate=April 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, however, leaders of both the Bloods and the Crips denied the allegations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Porter|first1=Tom|title=Bloods and Crips gangs reject claims of kill-a-cop pact|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/baltimore-riots-bloods-crips-gangs-reject-claims-kill-cop-pact-1498790|accessdate=April 29, 2015|work=International Business Times|date=April 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; released a video statement asking for calm and peaceful protest in the area,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gangs call for calm in Baltimore|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-riots/bal-video-gangs-call-for-calm-in-baltimore-20150427-premiumvideo.html|accessdate=April 29, 2015|work=The Baltimore Sun|date=April 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and joined with police and clergy to enforce the curfew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Berman|first1=John|last2=Castillo|first2=Mariano|title=Baltimore gangs will help enforce curfew|url=http://cnnuslive.cnn.com/Event/Baltimore_Riot/160923728|accessdate=April 29, 2015|publisher=CNN|date=April 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one occasion, gang members helped to prevent a riot at the [[Security Square Mall]] by dispersing would-be rioters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wusa9.com/story/news/local/maryland/2015/04/28/gang-members-help-prevent-riot-baltimore-mall/26534797/ | title=Gang members help prevent riot at Baltimore mall | publisher=WUSA | date=April 28, 2015 | accessdate=April 29, 2015 | first=Garrett W |last=Haake}}&lt;/ref&gt; On other occasions, rival gang members helped each other to protect black-owned businesses, black children, and reporters, diverting rioters to Korean-, Chinese-, and Arab-owned businesses instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/28/us/amid-violence-factions-and-messages-converge-in-a-weary-and-unsettled-baltimore.html| title=Amid Violence, Factions and Messages Converge in a Weary and Unsettled Baltimore | work=The New York Times | date=April 27, 2015 | accessdate=April 30, 2015 | first=Ron |last=Nixon}}&lt;/ref&gt; On yet another occasion, the Bloods, the Crips, and the [[Nation of Islam]] were seen taking a picture together and working together to dispel violence while peacefully demonstrating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.businessinsider.com/baltimore-gangs-call-for-peace-after-riots-2015-4 | title=Baltimore gangs call for peace after riots | work=Business Insider | date=April 28, 2015 | accessdate=April 30, 2015 | author=Ryan Gorman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical opinions===
On April 28, President [[Barack Obama]] strongly condemned the violence during a White House press conference, saying, "There's no excuse for the kind of violence that we saw yesterday. It is counterproductive. ... When individuals get crowbars and start prying open doors to loot, they're not protesting. They're not making a statement. They're stealing. When they burn down a building, they're committing arson. And they're destroying and undermining businesses and opportunities in their own communities. That robs jobs and opportunity from people in that area." Obama went on to applaud the actions of peaceful protesters who he felt were being undermined by the violence, and called upon the nation to take meaningful action to collectively solve poverty and law enforcement issues fueling what he described as "a crisis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ktla.com/2015/04/28/baltimore-protestors-throw-rocks-cinder-blocks-at-police-dozens-arrested/|title=President Obama Condemns Violence After More Than 200 People Are Arrested in Baltimore|publisher=KTLA|date=April 28, 2015|accessdate=April 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On social media and elsewhere, Mayor Rawlings-Blake and President Obama were criticized for calling the rioters "thugs" on April 28.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/29/us/baltimore-riots-thug-n-word/ | title=After Baltimore riots, some leaders slam 'thug' as the new n-word | work=CNN | date=April 29, 2015 | accessdate=April 30, 2015 | author=Josh Levs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked about the postponement of the [[Baltimore Orioles]] game, the Orioles' chief operating officer, [[John P. Angelos]], said:

{{quote|My greater source of personal concern, outrage and sympathy ... is focused neither upon one night's property damage nor upon the acts, but is focused rather upon the past four-decade period during which an American political elite have shipped middle class and working class jobs away from Baltimore and cities and towns around the U.S. to third-world dictatorships ... plunged tens of millions of good hard working Americans into economic devastation and then followed that action around the nation by diminishing every American's civil rights protections in order to control an unfairly impoverished population living under an ever-declining standard of living and suffering at the butt end of an ever-more militarized and aggressive surveillance state. The innocent working families of all backgrounds whose lives and dreams have been cut short by excessive violence, surveillance, and other abuses of the Bill of Rights by government pay the true price, an ultimate price, and one that far exceeds the importance of any kids' game played tonight, or ever....&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mosendz|first1=Polly|title=As Riots Consume Baltimore, Orioles Postpone Baseball Game|url=http://www.newsweek.com/riots-consume-baltimore-orioles-postpone-baseball-game-325932|accessdate=April 29, 2015|work=Newsweek|date=April 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Online reaction ===
The protests were originally covered on social media with the [[hashtag]] #BaltimoreRiots. However, by April 28, the more popular hashtag to cover the protests became #BaltimoreUprising. The change may have occurred in response to a decline in violent actions, or may have been the promotion of a new political narrative by social media users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/04/29/when-baltimoreriots-became-baltimoreuprising/ |title='Baltimore riots' transform into 'Baltimore uprising' |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=April 29, 2015 |author= Justin Wm.

=== Increase in violence and decrease in policing ===
Baltimore recorded 43 homicides in the month of May, the second deadliest month on record and the worst since December 1971 when 44 homicides were recorded. There have also been more than 100 non-fatal shootings in May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbal.com/article/115325/2/baltimores-murder-rate-ties-25-year-monthly-record|work=WBAL|title=Baltimore's Murder Total For May Climbs To 43|author=Robert Lang|date=May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police commissioner Anthony Batts blames looted drugs, stolen from 27 pharmacies and two methadone clinics, as well as street distribution and turf wars for the spike in crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Amara|first=Kate|publisher=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|title=Police Commissioner Anthony Batts blames stolen opiates for recent violence|date=June 4, 2015|url=http://www.wbaltv.com/news/police-commissioner-anthony-batts-blames-stolen-opiates-for-recent-violence/33384202|accessdate=June 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fantz|first=Ashley|publisher=[[CNN]]|title=In Baltimore, allegations of police doing less as drugs are rampant|date=June 5, 2015|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/04/us/baltimore-drugs-violence/|accessdate=June 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increase in shootings has occurred along with a 50% decline in arrests since the charging of six officers in Gray's death in custody.&lt;ref name=CBSArrestsDrop&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2015/05/28/baltimore-residents-fearful-amid-rash-of-homicides/|work=CBS News|title=Baltimore Gets Bloodier As Arrests Drop Post-Freddie Gray|date=May 28, 2015|quote="What is happening, there is a lot of levels of confusion in the police organization. There are people who have pain, there are people who are hurt, there are people who are frustrated, there are people who are angry," Batts said. "There are people, and they've said this to me, 'If I get out of my car and make a stop for a reasonable suspicion that leads to probable cause but I make a mistake on it, will I be arrested?' They pull up to a scene and another officer has done something that they don't know, it may be illegal, will they be arrested for it? Those are things they are asking."}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heavy police presence in crime-ridden neighborhoods is no longer apparent with one resident stating, "Before it was over-policing. Now there's no police."&lt;ref name=CBSArrestsDrop /&gt; One officer speaking anonymously stated, "After the protests, it seems like the citizens would appreciate a lack of police presence, and that's exactly what they're getting."&lt;ref name=StarAfterRiots /&gt; Batts stated that his officers are "not holding back" despite encountering hostility in the Western District whenever they make an arrest with "30 to 50 people surrounding them at any time;"&lt;ref name=CBSArrestsDrop /&gt; he also stated that his officers feel "confused and unsupported" in the wake of the charges. The president of the police union said his members are "afraid of going to jail for doing their jobs properly."&lt;ref name=StarAfterRiots&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2015/05/30/after-the-riots-baltimore-has-worst-murder-month-since-1996.html|work=Toronto Star|title=After the riots, Baltimore has worst murder month since 1996|author=Daniel Dale|date=May 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''The New York Times'', looting from 27 drugstores resulted in an increase in black market access to opiates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=West Baltimore's Police Presence Drops, and Murders Soar |accessdate=June 21, 2015 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/13/us/after-freddie-gray-death-west-baltimores-police-presence-drops-and-murders-soar.html?ref=todayspaper&amp;_r=2|publisher=The New York Times|quote=[A] flood of black-market opiates stolen from 27 pharmacies during looting in April, enough for 175,000 doses now illegally available for sale.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''55th Anniversary of Lucha Libre in Estadio de Mexico''' was celebrated by a [[professional wrestling]] [[supercard]] show produced and scripted by the Mexican ''[[lucha libre]]'' promotion [[International Wrestling Revolution Group]] (IWRG; sometimes referred to as Grupo Internacional Revolución in Mexico) which took place on December 3, 2017 in [[Arena Naucalpan]], [[Naucalpan]], [[State of Mexico]] (Estadio de Mexico). The event commemorated the sport of ''lucha libre'' becoming allowed in the State of Mexico, with the first ''lucha libre'' show held in the state taking place on December 1962. Over the years IWRG has on occasion celebrated the anniversary, although not consistently holding an anniversary show every year.

In the main event [[Villano V|Ray Mendoza Jr.]] had come out of retirement to face [[Mr. Electro]] in a ''[[Lucha de Apuestas]]'', bet match, with both competitors risking their hair on the outcome of the match. Mr. Electro was disqualified in the third fall, causing him to lose the match and his hair as well. In the semi-main event [[Black Dragón (wrestler)|Black Dragón]] and [[Oficial Rayan]] lost a ''[[Relevos Suicida]]'' match to the teams of [[Oficial Spector]]/[[Tortuga Teelo]] and [[Oficial Liderk]]/[[Tortuga Mike]]. As a result of the loss the two were scheduled to wrestle each other at the [[Arena Naucalpan 40th Anniversary Show]] on December 17, in a ''Lucha de Apuestas'' match for their masks. The show included five additional matches.

==Production==
===Background===
The history of ''[[lucha libre]]'', or [[professional wrestling]] in Mexico goes all the way back to the early 1900s where individual promoters would hold shows on a local basis in various Mexican states. In 1933 [[Salvador Lutteroth]] created [[Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre]] (EMLL; Spanish for "Mexican Wrestling Enterprise") and in subsequent years took EMLL to a national level.&lt;ref name=Lutteroth&gt;{{cite book|title=Lucha Libre: Masked Superstars of Mexican Wrestling|publisher=Distributed Art Publishers, Inc.|year=2005|chapter=Los Lutteroth / the Lutteroths|pages=20–27|isbn=968-6842-48-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MondoStart&gt;{{cite book|author=Madigan, Dan|title=Mondo Lucha A Go-Go: the bizarre &amp; honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling|publisher=HarperColins Publisher|year=2007|chapter=El nacimient de un sueño (the birth of a dream)|pages=41–50|isbn=978-0-06-085583-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s and 1940s various Mexican starts to create ''lucha libre'' commissions, often as an extension of the existing Boxing commissions, responsible for overview of ''lucha libre'' in each state, licensing wrestlers and ensuring the rules are being enforced.&lt;ref name=Mondo/&gt; In the [[State of Mexico]] ''lucha libre'' was not officially sanctioned in late 1962, with the first ''lucha libre'' show in the State of Mexico held in December 1962.&lt;ref name=Mondo&gt;{{cite book | author= Madigan, Dan | title= Mondo Lucha a Go Go: the bizarre and honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling | publisher= HarperColins Publisher | year= 2007 | chapter = Okay... what is Lucha Libre? | pages = 29–40 | isbn=978-0-06-085583-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mexican [[wrestling promotion]] [[International Wrestling Revolution Group]] (IWRG; Sometimes referred to as Grupo Internacional Revolución in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) has on occasion held a [[List of major IWRG shows|a major show]] in December to commemorate the "birth" of ''Lucha Libre'' in their home state. It is unclear exactly when IWRG started to mark the Anniversary, records confirm that they held a show to commemorate the event starting in 2010 commemorating the 48th Anniversary of ''Lucha Libre'' in Estadio de Mexico, possibly prior to that. The 2017 show was for the 55th anniversary and was held on December 3, 2013 in [[Arena Naucalpan]], [[Naucalpan]], State of Mexico where IWRG holds almost all of their major ''lucha libre'' shows.&lt;ref name=55thAnn/&gt;

===Storylines===
The 55th Anniversary of Lucha Libre in Estadio de Mexico event featured eight [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]] with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing [[Screenplay|scripted]] feuds, [[plot (narrative)|plots]] and [[narrative thread|storylines]]. Wrestlers were portrayed as either [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]] (referred to as ''rudos'' in Mexico, those that portray the "bad guys") or [[Face (professional wrestling)|faces]] (''técnicos'' in Mexico, the "good guy" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.&lt;ref name="Mondo"/&gt;

==Event==
After [[Dr. Cerebro]] pinned [[Imposible (wrestler)|Imposible]] to win the match for his side (which included Alas de Acero and [[Bandido (wrestler)|Bandido]]) he challenged Imposible to defend the [[IWRG Rey del Ring Championship]] at a later date.&lt;ref name=55thAnn/&gt; The fourth match of the night was part of a long-running IWRG vs. "Indy Nation" storyline where "Indy Nation" represented a number of wrestlers from the [[Independent circuit]] in Mexico, claiming they were better than the IWRG wrestlers. On the night "Indy Nation representatives [[Centvrión]], Fly Warrior and Séptimo Rayo defeated IWRG representatives [[Diablo Jr.]], [[Dinamic Black]] and [[Emperador Azteca]], all graduates of the IWRG wrestling school. In the closing moments of the match Fulgor I came to the ring and helped Indy Nation win the match. Afterwards, the group was joined by a masked man for their victory celebration. Moments later that masked man revealed himself to be Bandido, attacking Indy Nation. Afterwards Bandido declared that he, Emperador Azteca and Ciclon Ramirez was forming a trio to oppose Indy Nation.&lt;ref name=55thAnn/&gt; The fifth match of the night marked the first time [[Villano V]]'s youngest son wrestled under the ring name [[Rokambole Jr.]], having previously competed as Kaving. Rokambole Jr, his brother [[Villano V Jr.]] and their uncle [[Villano IV]] lost to the team of [[Charly Manson|Sharlie Rockstar]] and [[Los Traumas]] ([[Trauma I]] and [[Trauma II]]) after Sharly Rockstar hit Villano V Jr. with a foul while the referee was distracted.&lt;ref name=55thAnn/&gt;

The losing team in the semi-final ''[[Relevos Suicida]]'' match would be forced to put their masks on the line at the subsequent [[Arena Naucalpan 40th Anniversary Show]] scheduled for December 17. The teams for the match were [[Oficial Spector]] and [[Tortuga Teelo]], [[Oficial Liderk]] and [[Tortuga Mike]], [[Oficial Rayan]] and [[Black Dragón (wrestler)|Black Dragón]]. While both members of [[Los Tortugas Ninja]] refused to wrestle against each other, opting to tag out instead, none of the [[Los Oficiales Elite]] members had such problems, wrestling each other to keep their mask safe. the Mike/Liderk team was the first team to score a pinfall and escape the match, followed by Teelo/Spector, which meant that Oficial Rayan and Black Dragón would risk their masks at a later date.&lt;ref name=55thAnn/&gt;

For the main event, the semi-retired [[Villano V|Ray Mendoza Jr.]] was able to keep his hair due to a mistake by his opponent [[Mr. Electro]]. In the latter stages of the match Mr. Electro tried to his Mendoza Jr. with a steel chair, but accidentally ended up hitting the referee instead. This caused Mr. Electro to be disqualified, even after his brother, Sharly Rockstar, tried to argue that the match should continue. In the end, Mr. Electro reluctantly allowed for his hair to be shaved off.&lt;ref name=55thAnn/&gt;

==Production==
The production was based on ''[[A Christmas Story: The Musical]]'', which in turn was based on the [[A Christmas Story|1983 film]]. [[Marc Platt (producer)|Marc Platt]] reprised his role as co-executive producer from the live television musical (2016) of ''[[Grease: Live]]'', joined by Adam Siegel, and television director Alex Rudzinski and theatrical director [[Scott Ellis]]. It was broadcast from the [[Warner Brothers Studios]] in [[Burbank, California]], primarily using outdoor sets. Ellis noted that emphasis on the "feeling of family" was an important aspect of the production, as "it's not just razzle-dazzle stuff and big musical numbers. Our challenge is to never lose sight of the family aspect. And I think — I hope — we've succeeded in that." Songwriting duo [[Pasek and Paul|Pasek &amp; Paul]], who wrote the songs for ''A Christmas Story: The Musical'', wrote three new songs for the production, including "In the Market for a Miracle" for Mrs. Schwartz, "Ralphie's Nightmare" for the Parker family, and the opening theme "Count on Christmas".&lt;ref name="lat-xmasstorylive"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/la-et-st-christmas-story-live-20171216-story.html|title=The leg lamp! The frozen pole! Fox prepares to bring a holiday classic to life with 'A Christmas Story Live!'|last=Villarreal|first=Yvonne|date=2017-12-16|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-12-18|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pasek noted that the team had to try and maintain a balance between preserving the familiar and iconic aspects of the film, while also expanding upon it through its musical format. He explained that "there are certain moments where we want to stay true to what people remember and then there's other moments where we have permission to do what only musical theater can do and turn the dad's fantasy into a tap dancing number." Platt remarked that when working on a project such as this, "you prepare for the unknown. That's what makes live TV exciting. There are certain things that happen that you can't anticipate".&lt;ref name="lat-xmasstorylive"/&gt;

Unlike previous years, [[NBC]] did not broadcast a live musical for the 2017 holiday season; while it did plan to produce a version of ''[[Bye Bye Birdie]]'' executive produced by and starring [[Jennifer Lopez]], it was delayed into 2018 (later delayed into 2019) to accommodate Lopez's schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2017/12/14/christmas-story-live-fox-maya-rudolph-matthew-broderick/947183001/|title=Behold the leg lamp: Fox's 'A Christmas Story' offers live-musical take on holiday classic|work=USA Today|access-date=2017-12-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lat-xmasstorylive"/&gt; The broadcast ultimately competed against [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s annual presentation of the film ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'', as well as NBC's ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]'' between the [[Dallas Cowboys]] and [[Oakland Raiders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2017/12/cowboys-win-sunday-night-football-ratings-up-christmas-story-live-flounders-sound-of-music-movie-fox-nfl-nbc-1202229044/|title=‘Sunday Night Football’ Ratings Up, Low ‘Christmas Story Live!’ Topped By ‘Sound Of Music’ Movie Encore In Viewers|last=Patten|first=Dominic|date=2017-12-18|work=Deadline|access-date=2017-12-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the special, Fox also broadcast a live, 2-and-a-half-minute commercial for ''[[The Greatest Showman]]'', a then-upcoming musical film that also featured songs written by Pasek and Paul. The spot, which was directed by [[Michael Gracey]] and [[Beth McCarthy-Miller]], and also simulcast on [[Facebook]], featured a performance of the number "Come Alive" with the film's stars [[Hugh Jackman]], [[Zac Efron]], [[Keala Settle]], and [[Zendaya]]. The presentation was billed as the first live television commercial for a film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2017/12/the-greatest-showman-hugh-jackman-zac-efron-zendaya-keala-settle-live-movie-trailer-a-christmas-story-1202228961/|title=‘The Greatest Showman’ Live Movie Trailer Electrifies During ‘A Christmas Story Live’|last=Ramos|first=Dino-Ray|date=2017-12-18|work=Deadline|access-date=2017-12-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.adweek.com/creativity/hugh-jackmans-live-ad-last-night-for-the-greatest-showman-was-quite-the-circus/|title=Hugh Jackman's Live Ad Last Night for The Greatest Showman Was Quite the Circus|work=Adweek|access-date=2017-12-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
===Critical response===
''A Christmas Story Live!'' received mixed to negative reviews, with the general audience reacting more harshly than professional critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1= Melas|first1=Chloe|title='A Christmas Story Live' didn't bring the holiday cheer|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/18/entertainment/a-christmas-story-bad-reviews/index.html|website=CNN|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the production received a 46% rating based on 13 critics' reviews and 32% based on 56 audience reviews.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/a_christmas_story_live/&lt;/ref&gt; The show's three-hour length and musical numbers drew the most negative reactions, as Fox did not promote the program as a musical, and the lavish Broadway musical numbers were perceived to clash with the story's Midwestern setting.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/a-christmas-story-live-viewers-confused-by-musical-event-read-the-reactions/ A Christmas Story Live viewers confused by musical event: read the reactions]. ''Us Weekly''. Retrieved December 18, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; However, most of the individual actors' performances were positively received, as were the technical aspects of the special (such as scene and wardrobe changes).

The ''Los Angeles Times'' praised the performers: "...Matthew Broderick, who found his own, gentler way through Shepherd’s pointy prose...Maya Rudolph was affecting as Ralphie’s mother, Chris Diamantopoulos gruff if less than epic as his father, the Old Man...Andy Walken was a good visual match for the movie’s Peter Billingsley,...The whole company of kids, in fact, was energetic and on their marks,...
Schwartz’s mother, previously an offended voice on the other end of a phone call, was here gloriously embodied by Ana Gasteyer, who brought in a Hanukkah theme..." but noted that "...the virtues that have made the movie a seasonal perennial were somewhat swallowed by the narrative digressions and showstopping gestures of the musical."&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, Robert.

''Los Angeles Times'', December 17, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ratings===
The overnight [[Nielsen ratings]] were a 2.8 rating/5 share with 4.52 million viewers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/tv-ratings-sunday-dec-17-2017/ "TV Ratings Sunday Dec 17, 2017"] zap2it.com&lt;/ref&gt; as compared to the Fox network live telecast of ''Grease: Live'' in January 2016, which earned a 7.4 overnight and 12 million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;McPhee, Ryan.

The '''Amburbium''' ("City Circuit", from ''ambire'', "to go around" + ''urb-'', "city"; plural '''''amburbia''''') was an [[Roman festivals|ancient Roman festival]] for purifying the city; that is, a [[lustrum|lustration]] ''(lustratio urbis)''. It took the form of a procession, perhaps along the old [[Servian Wall]], though the length of 10 kilometers would seem impractical to circumambulate. If it was a distinct festival held annually, the most likely month is [[Februarius|February]], but no date is recorded and the ritual may have been performed as a "crisis rite" when needed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jörg Rüpke]], "Public and Publicity: Long-Term Changes in Religious Festivals during the Roman Republic," in ''Greek and Roman Festivals: Content, Meaning, and Practice'' (Oxford University Press, 2012), pp. 308–309.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Amburbium can be hard to distinguish from the [[Ambarvalia]] in ancient sources, either because it was a similar set of ritual procedures performed on behalf of the city instead of the fields or rural areas ''(arva)'', or because both originated with the priesthood of the [[Arvales]], "Brothers of the Fields".&lt;ref&gt;Daniel P. Harmon, "Religion in the Latin Elegists," ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' II.16.3 (1986), pp. 1949–1951.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Historia Augusta|Vopiscus]] sees the two as closely related: "the city is purified, the hymns are chanted, the Amburbium is celebrated, the Ambarvalia is carried out."&lt;ref&gt;[[Historia Augusta|Vopiscus]], ''Life of Aurelian'' 20.3 ''(lustrata urbs cantata carmina amburbium celebratum ambarvalia promiss)'', as cited by Harmon,  "Religion in the Latin Elegists," p. 1949.&lt;/ref&gt; Both festivals seem to have involved the [[sacrifice in ancient Roman religion|sacrifice]] of a pig, a sheep, and a bull ''([[suovetaurilia]])''.&lt;ref&gt;Entry on "Roman Religion," in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 2010), p. 101; [[H.H. Scullard]], ''Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic'' (Cornell University Press, 1981), p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; The Amburbium's sacrificial victims ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#hostia|hostiae]])'' were ''amburbiales.''&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Paul the Deacon]]; Rüpke, "Public and Publicity," p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Servius]], for the Ambarvalia a ''hostia'' with the capacity to produce ''[[felicitas]]'' ("fecundity, blessedness") is led around in a ritual circuit three times; the ceremony, he says, is called an ''amburbium'' when it is the city that is circumambulated.&lt;ref&gt;Servius, notes to ''Georgics'' 1.345 and ''Eclogues'' 5.75, as cited by Harmon, "Religion in the Latin Elegists," p. 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; The encircling ''(circuire)'' is identical with the purification ''(lustrare)''.&lt;ref&gt;Servius, note to ''Eclogue'' 3.77; Harmon, "Religion in the Latin Elegists," p. 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;

Amburbium does not appear on any of the [[List of ancient Roman fasti|ancient calendars]], and is thus assumed if annual to be one of the ''[[feriae conceptivae]]'', a [[moveable feast]]. [[Macrobius]], an [[antiquarian#Ancient Rome|antiquarian writer]] of [[late antiquity]], says that the semi-legendary second [[king of Rome]] [[Numa Pompilius|Numa]] added ''[[Ianuarius]]'' and ''[[Februarius]]'' to the end of the ten-month [[Roman calendar|calendar of Romulus]], and instituted a lustration of the city in February, with the sacrifices to be offered to the [[Manes|Di Manes]]. The Amburbium is not named as such in the passage, but [[H.H. Scullard]] thought it might be meant. Most festival activity in February pertained to the care and propitiation of the dead.&lt;ref&gt;Scullard, ''Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic'', p. 82, citing [[Macrobius]], ''Saturnalia'' 1.13.3.&lt;/ref&gt; The scarcity of evidence may indicate that in the [[Roman Empire|Imperial period]] the Amburbium was celebrated irregularly as needed,&lt;ref&gt;Scullard, ''Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic'', p. 82; Jörg Rüpke, ''Religion in Republican Rome: Rationalization and Change'' (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2012), p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; but it was performed as late as 271 AD. According to the ''[[Historia Augusta]]'', on January 11 of that year the emperor [[Aurelian]] ordered a consultation of the [[Sibylline books]], a collection of prophetic utterances from the gods ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#fata deorum|fata deorum]])'', resulting in a lustration of the city by means of the Amburbium and Ambarvalia.&lt;ref&gt;Scullard, ''Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic'', p. 83; R.L. Rike, ''Apex Omnium: Religion in the ''Res Gestae'' of Ammianus'' (University of California Press, 1987), p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ritual has been compared to the lustral sacrifices described in the [[Iguvine Tablets]], which were conducted by the ''Fratres Atiedii'', a "brotherhood" of priests at Iguvium (present-day [[Gubbio]]).&lt;ref&gt;Harmon, "Religion in the Latin Elegists," p. 1949.&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of several ceremonies of [[ancient Roman religion]] in which a sacred topography is marked out through a procession.&lt;ref&gt;Hubert Cancik, "Rome as Sacred Landscape: Varro and the End of Republican Religion in Rome," in ''Visible Religion: Annual for Religious Iconography. Approaches to Iconology'' (Brill, 1985–86), vol. 4–5, pp. 255–256.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description by Lucan==
The Neronian poet [[Lucan]] describes a ritual circumambulation of the city that may be the Amburbium, though the account could also be a fictional composite.&lt;ref&gt;Scullard, ''Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic'', pp. 82–83. The following description is that of Scullard.&lt;/ref&gt; In his epic poem about [[Caesar's civil war]], Lucan says that when [[Julius Caesar]] returned from [[Gallic Wars|Gaul]] and marched his troops toward the city, a panic broke out and a number of omens ''([[prodigium|prodigia]])'' were reported. Religious specialists were called in, among them an [[Etruscan religion#Etrusca Disciplina|Etruscan prophet]] ''([[vates]])'' named Arruns who orders up a sequence of ritual procedures, beginning with the destruction of all "[[wikt:freak of nature|freaks of nature]]"&lt;ref&gt;As translated by Susan H. Braund, ''Lucan: Civil War'' (Oxford University Press, 1992), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#monstrum|monstra]])''. The "unspeakable fetuses of a sterile womb" ''(sterilique nefandos / ex utero fetus)'' are to be burnt using the wood of "unlucky" trees (religiously ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#arbor felix|infelix]]).'' Arruns then sets in motion an amburbium, described in densely [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion|religious terms]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
He bids the city to be circumambulated ''(urbem ambiri)'' by the fearful citizens, and the [[College of Pontiffs|pontiffs]] to encircle the length of the sacred boundary ''([[pomerium]])'' along the outer perimeter ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#finis|fines]])'' while purifying the city walls by means of festal lustration ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#festus|festo]] … [[lustrum|lustro]])''. A throng of lesser rank follow, wearing the [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#cinctus gabinus|Gabinian cincture]]. The female priest in [[Fillet (clothing)|fillets]] leads the [[Vestal Virgin|Vestal]] chorus; for her alone is it right to look upon the [[Minerva]] [[Palladium (mythology)|brought from Troy]]. Then came those who conserve the gods' utterances ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#fata deorum|fata deorum]]'', that is, the priestly college of the ''[[quindecimviri sacris faciundis|quindecimviri]]'') and the arcane chants ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#carmen|carmina]])'' and who call back [[Cybele]] after she has been [[Cybele#'Holy week' in March|bathed in the little Almo]]; and the learned [[augur]] who observes birds in flight on the left; and the ''[[epulones|septemvir]]'' who presents festal banquets, and the [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#sodalitas|sodality]] of the [[Titii]], and the [[Salii|Salian priest]] bearing the [[ancile|sacred shield]] gladly on his shoulder, and the [[flamen]] towering in his [[Apex (headdress)|conical hat]] with the well-born point.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lucan follows the procession with the sacrifice of a bull, whose [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#exta|entrails]] reveal dire omens, and a prophetic speech by [[Nigidius Figulus]] based on his astronomical observations. It is unclear whether this Amburbium was a crisis rite actually held in 49 BC, or "a figment of his poetic imagination".&lt;ref&gt;Scullard, ''Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic'', p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Annie Mae Aquash''' (Mi'kmaq name '''''Naguset Eask''''') (March 27, 1945 – mid-December 1975) was a First Nations activist from [[Nova Scotia]], Canada who moved to [[Boston]] in the 1960s and joined American Indians in education and resistance. She was part of the [[American Indian Movement]] in the [[Wounded Knee incident]] at the [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation]], United States in 1973.

Aquash participated in the 1972 [[Trail of Broken Treaties]] and occupation of the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of Interior]] headquarters in Washington, DC; and protest to draw government action and acknowledgement of First Nations and Native American civil rights in Canada and [[Wisconsin]] in the following years. After she disappeared in late 1975, there were rumors she had been killed. On February 24, 1976, her body was found on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in [[South Dakota]]; she was initially determined to have died from [[hypothermia|exposure]] by a local medical examiner, but after a second autopsy two weeks later, was found to have been murdered by an execution-style gunshot. Initially, her death was covered up and the body declared to be "unidentifiable". The FBI disseminated rumours that she had been an informant. Aquash was thirty years old at the time of her death and had two young daughters, Debbie and Denise.&lt;ref name=IWFJ&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.indigenouswomenforjustice.org/# |title=Indigenous Women for Justice web page |access-date=2006-01-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180315051031/http://indigenouswomenforjustice.org/# |archive-date=2018-03-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After decades of investigation and the hearing of testimony by three federal grand juries, in March 2003, [[Arlo Looking Cloud]] and [[John Graham (Canadian activist)|John Graham]] (also known as John Boy Patton) were indicted for the murder of Aquash. Looking Cloud was convicted in 2004 and Graham in 2010; both received life sentences. [[Thelma Conroy-Rios|Thelma Rios]] was indicted along with [[John Graham (Canadian activist)|John Graham]], but she pleaded guilty to charges as an accessory to the [[kidnapping]]. In 2008 Vine Richard "Dick" Marshall was charged with aiding the murder, but was acquitted of providing the gun. Numerous Aquash supporters and her daughters believe that higher-level AIM officials ordered her murder, fearing she was an [[FBI]] informant.

==Early life and education==
Anna Mae Pictou was born into the [[Mi'kmaq]] First Nation at Indian Brook Reserve in [[Shubenacadie, Nova Scotia]]. Her mother was Mary Ellen Pictou and her father Francis Thomas Levi. She had two older sisters, Mary and Becky Pictou, and a younger brother Francis. Her mother and sisters survived her death. Pictou and her siblings received their early educations on the reserve.

==Marriage and family==
In 1962, Pictou and James Maloney moved together from the reserve to Boston. They had two daughters together, Denise, born in 1964, and Debbie, born in September 1965. They married that year, but divorced in mid-1970.

Pictou later married Nogeeshik Aquash, an [[Ojibwe|Ojibwa]] activist, in a Native ceremony. She kept his last name after they separated.

==Activism==
In Boston, Pictou began to meet urban American Indians and other First Nations people from Canada. About 1968-1969, she met members of the [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM), founded in [[Minneapolis]] in 1968, who were organizing among urban Indians, initially to combat [[police brutality]]. Pictou became involved in the Teaching and Research in Bicultural Education School Project (TRIBES), a program in [[Bar Harbor, Maine]], to teach young [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]] about their history.

On [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]] 1970, AIM activists in Boston held a major protest against the ''[[Mayflower II]]'' celebration at [[Port of Boston|the harbor]] by boarding and seizing the ship. Pictou helped create the Boston Indian Council (now the [[North American Indian Center of Boston]]), to work to improve conditions for Indians in the city.

In 1972 Pictou participated in the [[Trail of Broken Treaties]] march of American Indian activists to [[Washington, D.C.]] Protesters occupied the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] national headquarters and presented a list of 20 demands to the government, 12 of them dealing with treaty issues. In Boston, Pictou had met ''Nogeeshik'' Aquash, from [[Walpole Island]], Canada, and they began a relationship.

In 1973 Nogeeshik and Anna Mae traveled together to the [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation]] in South Dakota to join AIM activists and [[Oglala Lakota]] in what developed as the 71-day [[Wounded Knee incident|occupation of Wounded Knee]]. They were married there in a Native ceremony by [[Wallace Black Elk]], a Lakota elder. Anna Mae took Aquash as her surname, keeping it after they later separated.&lt;ref&gt;''Voices from Wounded Knee, 1973, In the Words of the Participants'', Rooseveltown, NY: Akwesasne Notes, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"These white people think this country belongs to them," Aquash wrote in a letter to her sister at the time. "The whole country changed with only a handful of raggedy-ass pilgrims that came over here in the 1500s. And it can take a handful of raggedy-ass Indians to do the same, and I intend to be one of those raggedy-ass Indians." On her first night in South Dakota, [Dennis] Banks told her that newcomers were needed on kitchen duty. "Mr. Banks," she replied, "I didn't come here to wash dishes. I came here to fight."&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/27/magazine/who-killed-anna-mae.html Eric Konigsberg, "Who Killed Anna Mae?"], ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'', 25 April 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Using the surname Aquash, in 1974 Annie Mae was based mostly in Minneapolis. She worked on the Red Schoolhouse project, for a culturally based school for the numerous American Indian students who lived in the city. That year she also participated in the armed occupation at Anicinabe Park in [[Kenora, Ontario]], by [[Ojibwe]] activists and AIM supporters. They were protesting treatment of the Ojibwe in Kenora and northwestern Ontario in relation to health, police harassment, education and other issues, and failures by the national government's Office of Indian Affairs to improve conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sisis.nativeweb.org/sov/oh11occ.html James Burke, "The Occupation of Anicinabe Park 1974; Two Interviews: Lyle Ironstand and Louis Cameron"], ''Paper Tomahawks: From Red Tape to Red Power,'' Queenston House Publishing, 1976; reprinted from ''Oh-Toh-Kin,'' Volume 1 Number 1, Winter/Spring 1992, accessed 18 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1975, Aquash worked with the [[Menominee]] Warriors Society in the month-long armed occupation of the Alexian Brothers Novitiate at [[Gresham, Wisconsin]].&lt;ref name="Anna Mae Aquash 1993"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=N8-_WXV10CcC&amp;dq=Johanna+Brand&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;source=gbs_gdata Johanna Brand, ''The Life and Death of Anna Mae Aquash''], Toronto: James Lorimer (1993), pp. 104-105, accessed 18 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic abbey had been closed and abandoned, and the Menominee wanted the property returned to the tribe, as the land had originally been appropriated by the Alexian Brothers for their mission.&lt;ref name="Kades"/&gt; That year, Aquash was arrested twice on federal weapons-related charges, but was quickly released.

Her arrests heightened internal AIM suspicions and rumors that Aquash might be a government informant.&lt;ref name="weller"&gt;[http://www.indiancountrynews.info/aquashmurder.cfm.htm Robert Weller, "AQUASH MURDER CASE: AIM leaders point fingers at each other"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125182726/http://www.indiancountrynews.info/aquashmurder.cfm.htm |date=2012-01-25 }}, AP, at ''News From Indian Country'', 4 November 1999, accessed 17 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Leaders were nervous since they had discovered in late 1974 that [[Douglas Durham]], a prominent member who by then had been appointed as head of security for AIM, was an FBI informant. The officials expelled him from AIM in February 1975 at a public press conference.

According to biographer Johanna Brand, by the spring of 1975 Aquash was "recognized and respected as an organizer in her own right and was taking an increasing role in the decision-making of AIM policies and programs."&lt;ref name="Anna Mae Aquash 1993" /&gt; She was close to AIM leaders [[Leonard Peltier]] and [[Dennis Banks]]. She and Banks had developed an intimate relationship beginning in the summer of 1974, although he was in a common-law marriage with another woman.&lt;ref name=Kades&gt;[http://portalwisconsin.org/archives/DeMain_feature.cfm Deborah Kades, "Native Hero"], ''Wisconsin Academy Review'' 2005, accessed 9 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johanna Brand, ''Life and Death of Aquash,'' pp. 104-105&lt;/ref&gt; Aquash also continued to work for the Elders and Lakota People of the [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation]].&lt;ref name="Anna Mae Aquash 1993" /&gt; After having been seen in [[Denver]] and [[Rapid City, South Dakota]], she disappeared in December 1975.

==Murder==
On February 24, 1976, rancher Roger Amiotte found Aquash's body by the side of [[South Dakota Highway 73|State Road 73]] in the northeast corner of the reservation, about {{convert|10|mi|0}} from [[Wanblee, South Dakota|Wanblee]], South Dakota. Her remains were revealed when snow melted in February.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jfamr.org/doc/amiotte.html "Testimony of Roger Amiotte in the Trial of Arlo Looking Cloud, February, 2004"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518022824/http://www.jfamr.org/doc/amiotte.html# |date=2008-05-18 }}, Justice for Anna Mae and Ray&lt;/ref&gt; An autopsy was conducted by medical practitioner W. O. Brown, who wrote: "it appears she had been dead for about 10 days," and she had "died from frost." Failing to notice a bullet wound at the base of her skull, Brown concluded that "she had died of exposure."&lt;ref name="Anna Mae Aquash 1993"/&gt; She was not identified at the time. Her hands were cut off and sent for [[fingerprinting]] to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] headquarters in Washington, DC.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} Her body was buried in South Dakota as a "Jane Doe".

On March 10, 1976, eight days after the burial, Aquash's remains were [[exhumation|exhumed]] due to requests made by the American Indian Movement and her family.  AIM arranged for a second autopsy to be conducted by Dr. Garry Peterson, a [[pathologist]] from Minneapolis.  He found that she had been shot by a [[8 mm caliber|.32 caliber]] bullet on the left side at the back of her head, under the hairline, in a shot that traveled upwards, missing the brain and lodging in her left eye socket.  It was described as execution style.&lt;ref&gt;"Aquash murder gets new grand jury hearing ", AP, ''News From Indian Country'', January 24, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  She was reinterred in Oglala Lakota land.  Rumors persisted that she had been killed by AIM as an informant, related to federal prosecution of activist [[Leonard Peltier]] in the 1975 shooting deaths of FBI agents at Pine Ridge.

Her murder was investigated by the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]], who started the investigation as the death appeared to have taken place on the reservation.  The FBI became involved because of its interest in AIM.  It was learned that she had been seen at the Pine Ridge Reservation before her disappearance in December 1975.  Federal grand juries were called to hear testimony in her case in 1976, 1982 and 1994, but no indictments were made.&lt;ref name="weller"/&gt;  In 1997 [[Paul DeMain]], editor of the independent newspaper ''[[News From Indian Country]]'', started regularly publishing articles about the investigation of the murder of Aquash.

==People come forward==
On 3 November 1999, Robert Pictou-Branscombe, a maternal cousin of Aquash from Canada, and [[Russell Means]], associated with the Denver-based AIM movement, held a press conference in Denver at the Federal Building to discuss the slow progress of the investigation into Aquash's murder. It had been under investigation both by the FBI and the BIA.

Earlier that day in a telephone interview with journalists [[Paul DeMain]] and Harlan McKosato, journalist [[Minnie Two Shoes]] commented about the importance of Aquash,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Part of why she was so important is because she was very symbolic. She was a hard working woman. She dedicated her life to the movement, to righting all the injustices that she could, and to pick somebody out and launch their little [[cointelpro]] program on her, to bad jacket her to the point where she ends up dead - whoever did it - let's look at what the reasons are. You know, she was killed and lets look at the real reasons why it could have been any of us. It could have been me. It could have been... Ya gotta look at the basically thousands of women. You gotta remember that it was mostly women in AIM. It could have been any one of us and I think that's why it's been so important. And she was just such a good person.&lt;ref name="radio"&gt;''Native America Calling'', 3 November 1999, Native American Public Telecommunications, carried at ''News From Indian Country'', accessed 16 July 2011. Sound files deleted, transcripts available at AIM Disinformation -- [http://aimdisinfo.blogspot.com/2007/12/russ-means-holds-press-conference-on.html Russell Means Press Conference] November 3, [http://aimdisinfo.blogspot.com/2007/12/native-america-calling-anna-mae-pictou.html Anna Mae Pictou-Aquash] November 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Paul DeMain (Ojibwe/Oneida), publisher and editor of ''[[News from Indian Country]],'' said that day, "...Anna Mae had a legacy of doing things differently, in 1975 she was alcohol- and drug-free, which made her stand out within the movement boldly because many people were still using and partying and there were many things going on in that area."&lt;ref name="radio"/&gt;

In a January 2002 editorial in the ''News from Indian Country,'' DeMain said that he had met with several people who reported hearing [[Leonard Peltier]] in 1975 admit the [[Leonard Peltier#Shootout at Pine Ridge|shootings of the two FBI agents]] on 26 June 1975 at the Pine Ridge Reservation. They also said that they believed the motive for the death of Aquash "allegedly was her knowledge of who shot the two [FBI] agents, and Joe Stuntz." DeMain did not reveal his sources because of their personal danger in having spoken to him. In an editorial of March 2003, DeMain withdrew his support for [[clemency]] in the life sentence of Peltier. In response, Peltier sued DeMain for libel on May 1, 2003. On May 25, 2004, after [[Arlo Looking Cloud]] was convicted by the jury, Peltier withdrew the suit; he and DeMain reached a settlement.

==Indictments and a co-conspirator==
In January 2003, a fourth federal grand jury was called in Rapid City to hear testimony about the murder of Aquash. She was known to have been given a ride from the home of Troy Lynn Yellow Wood of Denver on December 10, 1975, by AIM members [[Arlo Looking Cloud]], John Graham and [[Theda Nelson Clarke]], who transported her to Rapid City. They took Aquash further to the Pine Ridge Reservation in mid-December.

On March 20, 2003, a federal grand jury indicted two men for her murder: Fritz Arlo Looking Cloud (an Oglala [[Lakota people|Lakota]]) and John Graham (aka John Boy Patton) (a [[Southern Tutchone]] [[Athabascan]]), from [[Whitehorse, Yukon]], Canada). Although [[Theda Nelson Clarke]], Graham's adopted aunt, was also alleged to have been involved, she was not indicted; by then she was in failing health and being cared for in a nursing home.

Bruce Ellison, who has been Leonard Peltier's lawyer since the 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freepeltier.org/speakers_bureau.htm Freepeltier].&lt;/ref&gt; invoked his [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] rights against self-incrimination and refused to testify at the grand jury hearings on charges against Looking Cloud or at his trial in 2004. During the trial, the federal prosecutor referred to Ellison as a co-conspirator in the Aquash case.&lt;ref name=demain&gt;[http://www.jfamr.org/trialtime.html Paul DeMain, "Aquash Murder Case Timeline"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513114250/http://jfamr.org/trialtime.html# |date=2008-05-13 }}, NFIC, accessed 8 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 8, 2004, the trial of [[Arlo Looking Cloud]] began before a U.S. federal jury; five days later he was found guilty of [[murder]]. On April 23, 2004, he was given a mandatory sentence of [[life in prison]]. Although no physical evidence linking Looking Cloud to the crime was presented, a videotape was shown in which he admitted to having been at the scene of the murder, but said he was not aware that Aquash was going to be killed. In that video, Looking Cloud was interviewed by Detective Abe Alonzo of the [[Denver Police Department]] and Robert Ecoffey, the Director of the Bureau of Indian Affairs Office of Law Enforcement Services. On March 27, 2003, Looking Cloud said that John Graham was the gunman.&lt;ref name="Arlo interview"&gt;[http://www.jfamr.org/doc/arlo.html "Interview With Fritz Arlo Looking Cloud, March 27, 2003"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160516003754/http://www.jfamr.org/doc/arlo.html# |date=2016-05-16 }}, Justice for Anna Mae and Ray&lt;/ref&gt;

Looking Cloud said that he was making his statement while high and under the influence of "a little bit of alcohol."&lt;ref name="Arlo interview" /&gt; Trial testimony showed that Looking Cloud told a number of other individuals in various times and places about having been present at the murder of Aquash.&lt;ref name="jfamr.org document index" /&gt;

Looking Cloud appealed his conviction. In the appeal, filed by attorney Terry Gilbert, who replaced his trial attorney Tim Rensch, Looking Cloud retracted his videotaped confession, saying that it was false. He appealed based on the grounds that his trial counsel Rensch was ineffective in failing to object to the introduction of the videotaped statement, that he failed to object to [[hearsay]] statements of Anna Mae Aquash, failed to object to hearsay instruction for the jury, and failed to object to leading questions by the prosecution to Robert Ecoffey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jfamr.org/doc/appeal.pdf ''US v.

===Extradition of Graham===
On June 22, 2006, Canada's Minister of Justice, [[Vic Toews]], ordered the [[extradition]] of John Graham to the United States to face charges on his alleged involvement in the murder of Aquash. Graham appealed the order and was held under [[house arrest]], with conditions. In July 2007, a Canadian court denied his appeal, and upheld the extradition order. On December 6, 2007 the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] denied Graham's second appeal of his extradition.

Graham told police that he last saw Aquash while accompanying her on a drive from Denver to the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, where he left her at a safe house.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===Richard Marshall===
In August 2008, a federal grand jury indicted Vine Richard "Dick" Marshall with aiding and abetting the murder. Marshall was a bodyguard for [[Russell Means]] at the time of Aquash's murder. It was alleged that Graham, Looking Cloud, and [[Theda Nelson Clarke]] had taken Aquash to Marshall's house, where they held her prior to taking her to be executed in a far corner of the reservation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indiancountrynews.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=4398&amp;Itemid=108 "U.S. indicts Richard Marshall in Aquash murder case"], ''News from Indian Country'', August 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Marshall's wife, Cleo Gates, testified to this at Looking Cloud's trial. Marshall is alleged to have provided the murder weapon to Graham and Looking Cloud. Marshall was imprisoned in 1976 after being convicted in the 1975 shooting death of a man. He was paroled from prison in 2000. He was acquitted of the charge of conspiracy to murder Anna Mae.

==State trial for Graham and Rios==
In September 2009, Graham and [[Thelma Conroy-Rios|Thelma Rios]], a Lakota advocate in Rapid City, were charged by the State Court of South Dakota with the kidnapping, rape and murder of Anna Mae. The case against the defendants continued through much of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rapidcityjournal.com/search/?l=50&amp;sd=desc&amp;s=start_time&amp;f=html&amp;q=aquash "Aquash"], ''Rapid City Journal''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thelma Rios===
[[Thelma Conroy-Rios]], a longtime Lakota advocate in [[Rapid City, South Dakota|Rapid City]], was charged by the state of South Dakota in September 2009, along with John Graham, for the kidnapping, rape and murder of Aquash.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indiancountrynews.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=14&amp;Itemid=58 "Aquash - NFIC Files/Articles"], ''News from Indian Country'', accessed 9 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Already in poor health, she avoided a trial on murder charges by agreeing to a [[plea bargain]] "that acknowledged her role in the events leading up to Aquash's death." In November 2010, she pleaded guilty to the charge of being an accessory to kidnapping and received a 5-year sentence, most of which was suspended due to her poor health.&lt;ref name=Garrigan/&gt;

Rios admitted in court that she "relayed a message from AIM leadership to other AIM members to bring Aquash from Denver to Rapid City in December 1975, because they thought she was a government informant."&lt;ref name=APRios&gt;[http://nativetimes.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4922:woman-convicted-in-aim-slaying-dies-of-lung-cancer&amp;catid=55&amp;Itemid=31 AP, "Woman convicted in AIM slaying dies of lung cancer"], 14 February 2011, accessed 13 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Rios died of lung cancer 9 February 2011.&lt;ref name=Garrigan&gt;[http://www.rapidcityjournal.com/news/article_520e1afc-3580-11e0-9546-001cc4c002e0.html Mary Garrigan, "Rios, accessory in Aquash murder, dead at 65"], ''Rapid City Journal'', 11 February 2011, accessed 9 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Although names were redacted in her plea agreement at court, she had said she heard two people ordering Aquash to be brought from Denver to Rapid City and that there was a discussion about "offing her".&lt;ref name=AP&gt;[http://www.rapidcityjournal.com/news/article_1031845a-3d34-11e0-9798-001cc4c002e0.html?mode=story "Key witness' death complicates '75 murder case"], AP, ''Rapid City Journal'', 21 February 2011, accessed 10 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graham convicted of felony murder===
On December 10, 2010, after two days of deliberation in the state court, jurors found Graham guilty of felony murder, but acquitted him of the [[premeditated murder]] charge. The felony murder conviction carries a mandatory sentence of life in prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.com/bct_news/news_details/article/1373/2010/december/10/woman-pleads-guilty-in-1975-sd-reservation-killing.html Nomaan Merchant, "SD jury convicts man in 1975 AIM activist's death"], Associated Press, ''Beaver County Times,'' December 11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; After an appeal by Graham, the South Dakota Supreme Court upheld the lower court conviction in May, 2012.&lt;ref name=sdsn0512&gt;{{cite web|title=Graham Conviction for the 1975 Execution of Annie Mae Aquash Upheld by South Dakota Supreme Court|date=May 31, 2012|url=http://news.sd.gov/newsitem.aspx?id=13008|publisher=South Dakota State News|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==
Observers and historians speculate about who ordered the murder of Annie Mae Aquash. [[John Trudell]] testified in both the 1976 Butler and Robideau trial and the 2004 Looking Cloud trial that [[Dennis Banks]] had told him that the body of Anna Mae Aquash had been found before it was officially identified.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jfamr.org/doc/trudell.html "Testimony of John Trudell in the Trial of Arlo Looking Cloud February, 2004"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060818150724/http://www.jfamr.org/doc/trudell.html# |date=2006-08-18 }}, Justice for Anna Mae and Ray&lt;/ref&gt; Banks wrote in his autobiography, ''Ojibwa Warrior'', that Trudell told him that the body found was that of Aquash. Banks wrote that he did not know until then that Aquash had been killed, although she had been missing.

In Looking Cloud's trial, the prosecution argued that AIM's suspicion of Aquash stemmed from her having heard Peltier admit to the murders. [[Darlene Ka-Mook Nichols|Darlene "Kamook" Nichols]], former wife of the AIM leader Dennis Banks, testified that in late 1975, Peltier told of shooting the FBI agents. He was talking to a small group of AIM activists who were fugitives from law enforcement. They included Nichols, her sister Bernie Nichols (later Lafferty), Nichols' husband Dennis Banks, and Aquash, among several others. Nichols testified that Peltier said, "The motherfucker was begging for his life, but I shot him anyway."&lt;ref name="Ka-Mook Testifies"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.jfamr.org/doc/kmtest1.html| title=Ka-Mook Testifies| publisher=jfamr.org| access-date=2009-09-24| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518032313/http://www.jfamr.org/doc/kmtest1.html#| archive-date=2008-05-18| dead-url=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bernie Nichols-Lafferty gave the same account of Peltier's statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://jfamr.org/didit.html| title=Bernie Lafferty Speaks Regarding Leonard Peltier| publisher=jfamr.org| access-date=2009-09-24| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716114753/http://jfamr.org/didit.html#| archive-date=2011-07-16| dead-url=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other witnesses have testified that once Aquash came under suspicion as an informant, Peltier interrogated her while holding a gun to her head.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dickshovel.com/annatp4.html "Anna Aquash, Part 4"], Dick's Shovel&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coloradoaim.org/history/1994RobideauslettertoPaulDemain.htm "Robideau's letter to Paul DeMain"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121125084425/http://www.coloradoaim.org/history/1994RobideauslettertoPaulDemain.htm |date=2012-11-25 }}, Colorado AIM website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dickshovel.com/21705.html Steve Hendricks, ''The Unquiet Grave: The FBI and the Struggle for the Soul of Indian Country''], Thunder's Mouth Press, 2006, p. 202, at Dick's Shovel website&lt;/ref&gt; Peltier and David Hill later had Aquash participate in bomb-making so that her fingerprints would be on the bombs. The trio planted the bombs at two power plants on the Pine Ridge reservation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jfamr.org/doc/appeal_rspns.pdf Corel Office Document&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327074803/http://www.jfamr.org/doc/appeal_rspns.pdf# |date=2009-03-27 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive testimony suggests that AIM leaders ordered the murder of Aquash; because of her prominent position in the organization, lower-ranking members would not have taken action against her without permission from above.

==Denise and Debbie Maloney==
Together with federal and state investigators, Aquash's daughters Denise and Debbie believe that high-ranking AIM leaders ordered the death of their mother due to fears of her being an informant; they support the continued investigation.&lt;ref name=AP/&gt; Denise Pictou-Maloney is the executive director of the "Indigenous Women for Justice", a group she founded to support justice for her mother and other Native women.&lt;ref name=IWFJ/&gt; In a 2004 interview, Pictou-Maloney said her mother was killed by AIM members who 
&lt;blockquote&gt;thought she knew too much. She knew what was happening in California, she knew where the money was coming from to pay for the guns, she knew the plans, but more than any of that, she knew about the killings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jfamr.org/denise_interview.html "An interview with Denise Pictou-Maloney on the death of her mother, Annie Mae Aquash, November 24, 2004"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051220221323/http://www.jfamr.org/denise_interview.html# |date=2005-12-20 }}, Justice for Anna Mae and Ray&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Re-interment at Indian Brook Reservation==
After the conviction of Looking Cloud in 2004, Aquash's family had her remains exhumed. They were transported to her homeland of [[Nova Scotia]] for reinterment on June 21 at Indian Brook Reservation in [[Shubenacadie, Nova Scotia|Shubenacadie]]. They held appropriate Mi'kmaq ceremonies and celebrated the work and life of the activist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jfamr.org/burial.html Carson Walker, "AIM Activist to be Buried in Native Nova Scotia June 21, 2004"], ''News from Indian Country'', 18 June 2004, at Justice for Anna Mae and Ray, accessed 10 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Family and supporters have held annual anniversary ceremonies in Annie Mae's honor since then.

The '''Bayreuth Festival''' ({{lang-de|link=no|'''Bayreuther Festspiele'''}}) is a music festival held annually in [[Bayreuth]], Germany, at which performances of operas by the 19th-century German composer [[Richard Wagner]] are presented. Wagner himself conceived and promoted the idea of a special festival to showcase his own works, in particular his monumental cycle ''{{lang|de|[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]}}'' and ''[[Parsifal]]''.

Performances take place in a specially designed theatre, the [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus]]. Wagner personally supervised the design and construction of the theatre, which contained many architectural innovations to accommodate the huge orchestras for which Wagner wrote as well as the composer's particular vision about the staging of his works.
The Festival has become a pilgrimage destination for Wagner enthusiasts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120711163527/http://bayreuther-festspiele.de/english/tickets_ _service/how_to_order_202.html "Tickets: How to Order"] on Bayreuth website, bayreuther-festspiele.de Retrieved 1 July 2103&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wagneropera.net/Bayreuth/Tickets-Bayreuth-Festival.htm "How to get tickets for the Wagner Festival in Bayreuth"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100128063856/http://www.wagneropera.net/Bayreuth/Tickets-Bayreuth-Festival.htm |date=28 January 2010 }} on wagneropera.net Retrieved 1 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
The origins of the Festival itself lie rooted in Richard Wagner's interest in establishing his financial independence. A souring of the relationship with his patron, [[Ludwig II of Bavaria]], led to his expulsion from Munich, where he had originally intended to launch the festival. Wagner next considered Nuremberg, which would have reinforced the thematic significance of works such as ''[[Die Meistersinger]]''. On the advice of [[Hans Richter (conductor)|Hans Richter]], however, the focus fell upon [[Bayreuth]] which enjoyed three distinct advantages.

First, the town boasted a splendid venue: the [[Markgräfliches Opernhaus]] built for [[Margrave of Bayreuth|Margrave Frederick]] and his wife, [[Wilhelmine of Bayreuth|Friederike Sophie Wilhelmine]] (sister of [[Frederick the Great]]) in 1747. With its ample capacity and strong acoustics, the opera house was a good match for Wagner's vision. Second, the town of Bayreuth found itself outside of regions where Wagner no longer owned the rights to the performance of his own works, which he had sold off in 1864 in order to alleviate pressing financial concerns. Finally, the town had no cultural life that could offer competition to Wagner's own artistic dominance. The Festival, once launched, would be the dominant feature of Bayreuth's cultural landscape.

In April 1870, Wagner and his wife [[Cosima Wagner|Cosima]] visited Bayreuth. On inspection, the Opera House proved to be inadequate. It was built to accommodate the [[baroque]] orchestras of the 18th century and was therefore unsuited for the complex stagings and large orchestras that Wagner's operas required. Nonetheless, the Burgermeisters proved open to assisting Wagner with the construction of an entirely new theatre and the Festival was planned to launch in 1873. After a fruitless meeting in the spring of 1871 with the German Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] to obtain funds, Wagner embarked on a fundraising tour across Germany, including Leipzig and Frankfurt.

An initial public subscription proved disappointing until Wagner, at the suggestion of his friend and admirer [[Emil Heckel]], launched a number of [[Wagner Societies]] to increase participation in the Festival's subscription. Societies were established, among other places, in Leipzig, Berlin and Vienna.

Despite making direct appeals based on Wagner's role as a composer of the new German Reich, the Societies and other fundraising channels were well short of the needed sum by the end of 1872. Wagner made another appeal to Bismarck in August 1873 and was again denied.

Desperate, Wagner turned to his former patron, Ludwig II who reluctantly agreed to help. In January 1874, Ludwig granted 100,000 Thaler and construction on the theatre, designed by architect [[Gottfried Semper]], started shortly thereafter. A planned 1875 debut was postponed for a year due to construction and other delays.

== Early history==
[[File:Felixmottl3.jpg|thumb|300px|Felix Mottl conducted ''Tristan und Isolde'' at Bayreuth in 1886]]
Since its opening in 1876, the Bayreuth Festival has been a socio-cultural phenomenon. The inauguration took place on 13&amp;nbsp;August 1876, with a performance of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|"Choral" Symphony]], which tradition has been repeated at every opening ever since.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Callow, ''Wagner: The Triumph of the Will'', p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Then came the first performance of ''[[Das Rheingold]]''. Present at this unique musical event were [[Wilhelm I of Germany|Kaiser Wilhelm]], [[Pedro II of Brazil|Dom Pedro II]] of Brazil, King Ludwig (who attended in secret, probably to avoid the Kaiser), and other members of the nobility, as well as the philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] who committed much effort to helping his then good friend Wagner establish the festival,&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, Friedrich, ''[[Twilight of the Idols]]'', [[Penguin Books]], 2003. Translator's Note (R.J. Hollingdale).&lt;/ref&gt; and such accomplished composers as [[Anton Bruckner]], [[Edvard Grieg]], [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Pyotr Tchaikovsky]], [[Franz Liszt]], and the young [[Arthur Foote]].

Artistically, the festival was a success. ("Something has taken place at Bayreuth which our grandchildren and their children will still remember", wrote Tchaikovsky, attending the Festival as a Russian correspondent.) Financially, however, the festival was a disaster and did not begin to make money until several years later. Wagner abandoned his original plan to hold a second festival the following year, and travelled to London to conduct a series of concerts in an attempt to make up the deficit. Although the festival was plagued by financial problems in its early years, it survived through state intervention and the continued support of influential Wagnerians, including [[Ludwig II of Bavaria|King Ludwig II]] of Bavaria.

From its inception, the festival has attracted leading conductors and singers, many of whom performed without pay. Among these was [[Hans Richter (conductor)|Hans Richter]], who conducted the premiere of the Ring Cycle in 1876. Another was the talented conductor [[Hermann Levi]], who was personally chosen by Richard Wagner to conduct the debut of ''Parsifal'' in 1882 with the assistance of the young [[Engelbert Humperdinck (composer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]].{{ref|Spotts}}

Following Wagner's death, his widow [[Cosima Wagner|Cosima]] continued running the festival at one or, more frequently, two-year intervals. She gradually introduced the remaining operas which complete the [[Bayreuth canon]] of Wagner's last ten completed operas. Levi, the son of a [[rabbi]], remained the festival's principal conductor for the next two decades. [[Felix Mottl]], who was involved with the festival from 1876 to 1901, conducted ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'' there in 1886. Until the 1920s, performances were strictly in accordance with the traditions established under King Ludwig's patronage. Not a note was "cut" from any of the enormous scores; no concessions were made to the limits of human patience on the part of the audiences. [[Cosima Wagner]] preserved the productions of [[Parsifal]] and [[Der Ring des Nibelungen]] just as they had been in Wagner's day, defending any proposed changes with appeals to her son Siegfried: "Was this not how Papa did it in 1876?"

After Cosima's retirement in 1906, [[Siegfried Wagner]] took over management of the festival, introducing new staging and performance styles. His early death in 1930 left the Festival in the hands of his English-born wife [[Winifred Wagner]], with [[Heinz Tietjen]] as artistic director.

== Bayreuth under Nazi Germany ==
In the 1920s, well before the rise of the [[Nazi Party]], Winifred Wagner became a strong supporter and close personal friend of [[Adolf Hitler]]; her correspondence with Hitler has never been released by the Wagner family. She and other festival leaders were members of Nazi chief ideologue [[Alfred Rosenberg]]'s [[Kampfbund für deutsche Kultur]], which actively suppressed modernist music and works by "degenerate" artists. The festival maintained some artistic independence under the [[Third Reich]]. Ironically, Hitler attended performances that included Jewish and foreign singers, long after they had been banned from all other venues across Germany (including [[heldentenor]] [[Max Lorenz (tenor)|Max Lorenz]], married to a well-known Jewish woman). Winifred's influence with Hitler was so strong that Hitler even wrote a letter (at her behest) to anti-fascist Italian conductor [[Arturo Toscanini]], begging him to lead the festival. Toscanini refused. From 1933 to 1942, the festival was conducted principally by [[Karl Elmendorff]].

It was under the Third Reich that the festival made its first break from tradition, abandoning the deteriorating 19th century sets created by Richard Wagner. Many protested at the changes, including prominent conductors such as Toscanini and [[Richard Strauss]], and even some members of the Wagner family. In their view, any change to the festival was a profanation against "the Master" (Wagner). Nevertheless, Hitler approved of the changes, thus paving the way for more innovations in the decades to come.

During the war, the festival was turned over to the [[Nazi Party]], which continued to sponsor operas for wounded soldiers returning from the front. These soldiers were forced to attend lectures on Wagner before the performances, and most found the festival to be tedious.&lt;ref&gt;Spotts, Frederic, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=mWqXGqaCOEQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Bayreuth: A History of the Wagner Festival]'', New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as “guests of the Führer”, none complained.

===Bayreuth Memorial===
[[File:Ottilie-Metzger-Gedenkplatte-Bayreuth.jpg|thumb|Memorial to Jewish singers in the Bayreuth Festival Park]]
During the 1970s Winifred Wagner was repeatedly petitioned to install a memorial to the Jewish singers at the Bayreuth Festival who had been murdered in concentration camps.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Opera (magazine)|Opera]]'' (London), Vol.48 1997, pp.&amp;nbsp;914–5:
:"The festival's archive, with its correspondence with Hitler and other documentation of the period, is still closed to research. He has not even been willing to have a modest memorial for the three Bayreuth singers who perished in concentration camps. The proposal for a memorial plaque was proposed to Wolfgang ages ago by a retired singer and Bayreuth antiquarian bookseller, Peer Baedeker. And therein lies a revealing story. When the centenary festival opened in 1976 with a wreath-laying ceremony at Wagner's grave, Baedeker placed his own wreath with a ribbon attached, with the words: In memory of Richard Breitenfeld, Henriette Gottlieb, Ottilie Metzger-Lattermann Honoured as festival singers murdered in Nazi concentration camps. Within 24 hours of the ceremony, the ribbon had vanished. An article about the incident, which later appeared in an Israeli newspaper, was sent to Winifred, who wrote the following ineffable letter to Baedeker: Herr Heinrich Schaar in Munich sends me from time to time cuttings from the Israel Nachrichten, including this one. ... Herr Schaar appears to suspect that this was my doing or at my behest, since otherwise he would not have sent me the press cutting. In the first place I had no idea you had laid a wreath, and in the second I seldom go to RW's resting place; since it is now permanently open to the public, it is never possible to visit the grave alone. I myself never heard Frau Metzger-Lattermann in Bayreuth. but I know that my husband had a very high impression of her. Frau [[Henriette Gottlieb|Gottlieb]] sang here in my time and I had a high opinion of her as well. Herr [[Richard Breitenfeld|Breitenfeld]] is unknown to me. But were all three really killed at Auschwitz? I would doubt that in the case of Frau Lattermann, since she must have been terribly old. With best wishes, also to your wife, whom I recently greeted in front of Wahnfried." – The casualness of this brush-off, the brutal indifference to the murder of three old singers speaks volumes about the attitude in Bayreuth to its past. And so the monument that the festival visitor sees today on the Green Hill – the massive copy of the bust of a glowering Wagner made for Hitler by the Nazi sculptor Arno Breker – is, properly viewed, a brazen symbol of Bayreuth's (??)"&lt;/ref&gt; A plaque was finally installed honouring [[Ottilie Metzger-Lattermann]] and [[Henriette Gottlieb]] after Winifred's death.

==New festival==
Two-thirds of the town of Bayreuth was [[Bayreuth#The Nazi era (1933–1945)|destroyed by American bombing]] in the final days of World War II, taking with it the rotunda, living room and guest room of [[Wahnfried]], though the theatre itself was undamaged. Following the war, Winifred Wagner was sentenced to probation by a war court for her support of the Nazi party. The court also banned her from administration of the Bayreuth Festival and its assets, which fell eventually to her two sons, [[Wolfgang Wagner|Wolfgang]] and [[Wieland Wagner|Wieland]].

During American occupation of the region after World War II, the theatre was used for army recreation and religious services for American soldiers. Only popular concerts and mixed entertainment were allowed: comedy, dancing, acrobatics, and then only ''[[Die Fledermaus]]'' was staged. When the Festival House was handed over to the city of Bayreuth in 1946, it was used for concerts of the Bayreuth Symphony Orchestra and the performances of such operas as ''[[Fidelio]]'', ''[[Tiefland (opera)|Tiefland]]'', ''[[Madama Butterfly]]'' and ''[[La traviata]]''. And talks about reopening of the Wagnerian Festival started. Finally it reopened on 29 July 1951 with, as always, a performance by the Bayreuth Festival Orchestra under conductor [[Wilhelm Furtwängler]] of Beethoven's 9th Symphony, followed by the first post-war premiere of Wagner's opera, ''[[Parsifal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Wagner in Bayreuth: A Documentary |last=Emmerich |first=Peter |year=1992 |publisher=Philips Classics Productions, Baarn |location=Belgium |pages=69–71 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the direction of Wieland Wagner, the "New Bayreuth" ushered in an era that was no less than revolutionary. Gone were the elaborate naturalistic sets, replaced with minimalist modern productions. In comparison, the pre-war changes seemed tame. For the first time in its history, the Bayreuth audience booed at the end of productions. Wieland was particularly derided for his 1956 production of ''[[Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg]].'' Stripped of its pageantry, conservatives viewed the breaking of this "sacred German tradition" as an outrage. {{ref|Spotts}}

Wieland defended the changes as an attempt to create an "invisible stage" that would allow the audience to experience the full psychosocial aspects of the drama without the baggage and distraction of elaborate set designs. Others have speculated that by stripping Wagner's works of their Germanic and historic elements, Wieland was attempting to distance Bayreuth from its nationalistic past and create productions with universal appeal. Over time, many critics came to appreciate the unique beauty of Wieland's reinterpretation of his grandfather's works.{{ref|Spotts}}

Wieland's innovative productions invited comparison to Wolfgang's, which critics unanimously found to be uninspired. If Wieland's productions were radical, Wolfgang's were regressive. Although still minimalist in approach, Wolfgang resurrected much of the naturalistic and romantic elements of pre-war productions. Thus, when Wieland died prematurely from lung cancer in 1966, many wondered if Bayreuth had a future. They began to question Bayreuth's primacy among German opera houses, and some suggested that more interesting productions were being staged elsewhere.{{ref|Spotts}}

Around this time (1955), in order to broaden its audience, the whole Bayreuth Festival company conducted performances in Paris and Barcelona, performing ''[[Parsifal]]'', ''[[Die Walküre]]'' and ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]''.

In 1973, faced with overwhelming criticism and family infighting, the Bayreuth Festival and its assets were transferred to a newly created [[Richard Wagner Foundation]]. The board of directors included members of the Wagner family and others appointed by the state. As chairman, Wolfgang Wagner remained in charge of administration of the festival.

While Wolfgang Wagner continued to administer the festival, beginning in the 1970s, production was handled by a number of new directors in what Wolfgang called ''Werkstatt Bayreuth'' (Bayreuth Workshop). The idea was to turn the festival into an opportunity for directors to experiment with new methods for presenting the operas. The change came out of necessity, as it was impossible for Wolfgang to both administer and direct the festival. It also provided an opportunity for Bayreuth to renew itself with each production, rather than continue to present the same operas in the same way, year after year. [[Ingmar Bergman]], who famously made a [[The Magic Flute (1975 film)|film version in Swedish]] of Mozart's ''[[Die Zauberflöte]]'', turned down an invitation to direct the festival.

The most sensational production in ''Werkstatt Bayreuth'' was the Centennial Ring Cycle under the direction of French director [[Patrice Chéreau]]. Chereau used an updated 19th century setting that followed the interpretation of [[George Bernard Shaw]] who saw the Ring as a social commentary on the exploitation of the working class by wealthy 19th century capitalists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/shaw/works/wagner.htm Bernard Shaw, ''The Perfect Wagnerite'' (1883) online at www.marxists.org] Shaw's examination of Wagner's approach to the cycle&lt;/ref&gt;

The audience reaction was split between those who saw the production as an offence and those who considered it the best Ring Cycle ever produced. The ensuing conflict, short only of outright riot, between supporters and detractors was unprecedented in the history of the festival. The performances, and the performers, however, were without dispute some of the best seen in the world of opera.

Other notable directors to have participated in ''Werkstatt Bayreuth'' included [[Jean-Pierre Ponnelle]], Sir [[Peter Hall (theatre director)|Peter Hall]] of the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]], [[Götz Friedrich]] of the [[Deutsche Oper Berlin]], [[Harry Kupfer]] of the [[Berlin State Opera]] in the former communist East Germany
and [[Heiner Müller]] of the [[Berliner Ensemble]]. In the end, Wolfgang's decision to bring in experimental directors helped rejuvenate Bayreuth and restore its reputation as the world leader in Wagnerian opera.

== 21st century ==

There was uncertainty over how the Festival was to be managed after the retirement of Wolfgang Wagner at the end of August 2008. In 2001, the Festival's 21-member board of directors had voted for his daughter, [[Eva Wagner-Pasquier]], to succeed him. Wolfgang Wagner, however, proposed to hand control over to his second wife, Gudrun, and their daughter Katharina.{{ref|BBC}} Gudrun died in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/musik/0,1518,520138,00.html Obituary] ''Der Spiegel'', 28 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; No successor was named at that time, but it was speculated that Wagner-Pasquier and Katharina would eventually be named as joint directors of the festival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,3301199,00.html "Bayreuth Festival's Wolfgang Wagner to Retire"], ''[[Deutsche Welle]]'', 29 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Directors have stated that preference will be given to descendants of Richard Wagner, and that a non-descendant would have to be a clearly better candidate.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

On 1 September 2008, Wolfgang Wagner's daughters, [[Eva Wagner-Pasquier]] and [[Katharina Wagner]], were named by Bavaria's culture minister, [[Thomas Goppel]], to take over the Festival. They were to take up their duties immediately, since their father had announced his retirement at the conclusion of the 2008 Festival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7592659.stm "Daughters chosen to run Bayreuth"], ''BBC News'', 1 September 2008. Retrieved on 1 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; They were chosen ahead of the pair of their cousin, [[Nike Wagner]], and [[Gerard Mortier]], who had placed a late bid for the directorship on 24 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Hickley | first = Catherine | title = Wagner Sisters Katharina, Eva Named to Lead Bayreuth (Update2) |publisher=Bloomberg | accessdate =1 September 2008 | date = 1 September 2008 | url = https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601100&amp;sid=a_Nlu8t5Lw8k }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = McGroarty | first = Patrick |author2=Ron Blum | title = Bayreuth names Wagner half-sisters as co-directors | work = International Herald Tribune | accessdate =1 September 2008 | date = 1 September 2008 | url = http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/09/01/europe/EU-Germany-Bayreuth-Festival.php }}&lt;/ref&gt; The conductor [[Christian Thielemann]] has agreed to act as chief adviser to the new directors, effectively taking the role of music director of the Festival.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Boyes, [http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article4656805.ece "Wagner hits a note of peace over Bayreuth"], ''The Times'' (London), 2 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tickets===
The festival draws thousands of Wagner fans to Bayreuth every summer. It is very difficult to get tickets, because demand (estimated at 500,000) greatly exceeds supply (58,000 tickets); the waiting time is between five and ten years (or more). The process entails submitting an order form every summer; applicants are usually successful after about ten years. Failure to make an application every year results in being placed at the back of the queue. Although some tickets are allocated by lottery, preference is given to members of the Society of Friends of Bayreuth (financial donors), famous patrons, and to regional and international Wagner societies, which are distributed to their own members through lottery or the willingness to pay a high contribution.

However, in 2013 tickets for one opera production were offered exclusively online, on a first come first served basis with no preferential eligibility. It is reported that they sold out within seconds.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}
This offer was repeated for the 2014 season, with tickets being available for eight performances including one complete Ring cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bayreuth Festival 2014|url=http://tickets.bayreuther-festspiele.de/en/info|publisher=Bayreuther Festspiele|accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, retail ticket prices ranged from €320 for a front row stalls seat to €45 for a gallery (third level) back row seat.&lt;ref name=bfs&gt;Bayreuther Festspiele: "Spielfolge/Programme 2014" leaflet, issued September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The Festival authorities assiduously police the traffic of tickets, and monitor sites such as [[eBay]]. If the authorities suspect that a ticket has been resold without their consent (in practice, this means at a higher price than its face value&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FAQ for humanities.music.composers.wagner|url=http://www.monsalvat.no/wagnerfaq.htm#SECTION-3|accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;), they may demand identification from the ticket holder on presentation and refuse entry to those who cannot prove to have purchased their tickets legitimately. In practice, this is uncommon.

In 2011 it was revealed that the German [[Bundesrechnungshof]] (federal audit office) were investigating the situation where, for a publicly subsidised event, only 40 percent of the tickets were actually available to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas Wiegelmann: [https://www.welt.de/print/die_welt/kultur/article13447695/Mit-den-Foerderzielen-des-Bundes-nicht-vereinbar.html "Mit den Förderzielen des Bundes nicht vereinbar"]. Die Welt, 24 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Götterdämmerung|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2011/06/bayreuth-festival|publisher=The Economist|accessdate=24 September 2013|date=20 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Early in 2012 it was announced that changes would be made to the allocation system, including the ending of allocations to [[International Association of Wagner Societies|Wagner Societies]] (but not including the Society of Friends of Bayreuth as they make a substantial financial contribution) and a reduction in the proportion reserved for travel agents and hotels. As a result, the proportion of tickets available to the general public would increase to about 65 percent of the total available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Was lange währt: Reform der Ticketvergabe in Bayreuth kommt voran|url=http://magazin.klassik.com/news/teaser.cfm?ID=9201|publisher=Klassik Magazine|accessdate=24 September 2013|language=DE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Der Ring des Nibelungen''===
{{Further|List of Bayreuth Festival productions of Der Ring des Nibelungen}}
A new production of ''Der Ring des Nibelungen'' is presented every five to seven years, following a year in which no ''Ring'' is presented. In years in which the ''Ring'' is staged, three other operas are presented as well. When no ''Ring'' is staged, five other operas are presented. Tickets for the ''Ring'' are normally sold only as a complete set for all four performances.&lt;ref name=bfs/&gt;

The newest production of the ''Ring'' (directed by [[Frank Castorf]]) premiered in 2013. Castorf's radical staging of the cycle—a colourful modern setting with the global race for oil as the underlying theme—was received with lengthy booing at its premiere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/02/arts/music/at-bayreuth-boos-and-dropped-jaws.html |title=At Bayreuth, Boos and Dropped Jaws |work=The New York Times |last=Tommasini |first=Anthony |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171207145255/https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/02/arts/music/at-bayreuth-boos-and-dropped-jaws.html |archive-date=7 December 2017 |accessdate=11 August 2018 |date=1 August 2013 |dead-url=unfit}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kettle, Martin.

When the [[Uprising in Banat|Serbs in Banat rose up]] against the Ottomans in 1594, using the portrait of Saint Sava on their [[war flags]], the Ottomans retaliated by incinerating the relics of St. Sava on the [[Vračar plateau]] in [[Belgrade]].{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=45}} Grand Vizier [[Koca Sinan Pasha]], the main commander of the Ottoman army, ordered for the relics to be brought from Mileševa to Belgrade, where he set them on fire on 27 April.{{sfn|Ćorović|2001|loc= Шести период, V.}} Monk Nićifor of the [[Fenek monastery]] wrote that "there was great violence carried out against the clergy and devastation of monasteries".{{sfn|Mileusnić|2000|p=45}} The Ottomans sought to symbolically and really, set fire to the Serb determination of freedom, which had become growingly noticeable.{{sfn|Ćorović|2001|loc= Шести период, V.}} The event, however, sparked an increase in rebel activity, until the suppression of the uprising in 1595.{{sfn|Ćorović|2001|loc= Шести период, V.}} It is believed that his [https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000450/http://www.svetosavlje.org/svetinje/Mosti/rukasvSave.htm left hand was saved]; it is currently held at Mileševa.

The '''burning of Saint Sava's relics''' ({{lang-sr|Спаљивање моштију светога Саве}}) is a [[Serbian Orthodox]] religious holiday venerated on 27 April (10 May Gregorian). Archbishop Sava founded the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]], Serbian ecclesiastical law and national literature. He was canonized as a miracle-worker and his religious cult was assimilated into folk beliefs in Ottoman times. The veneration of his relics created tension between Serbs and the occupying Ottomans. In 1774, Sava was proclaimed the patron saint of all Serbs. In the 19th century the cult was revived in the context of nationalism with the prospect of independence from the Ottomans, "representing and reproducing powerful images of a national Golden Age, of national reconciliation and unification, and of martyrdom for the church and nation". After Serbia gained full independence, a cathedral dedicated to the saint was planned, part of modernization plans of Belgrade. Although the construction board for the church was established in 1895, the construction of the winning concept, based on [[Gračanica Monastery|Gračanica]] and [[Hagia Sophia]], began in 1935. Construction stopped during World War II and the Communist rule, only to be restarted after permission in 1984; as of 2010, the exterior is finished and interior unfinished.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bakić-Hayden|2010}}, {{harvnb|Milanović|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site where Saint Sava's relics were burnt, the Vračar plateau, became the new grounds of the [[National Library of Serbia]] and the [[Church of Saint Sava]] dedicated to the saint, in the 20th century. From its location, the church dominates Belgrade's [[cityscape]], and has become a national symbol.

'''Cornerstone Florida''' was an annual American [[Christian rock festival]] held in [[Orlando, Florida]] from 2003 to 2007, a satellite festival of the original [[Cornerstone Festival]] in [[Illinois]]. It was one of the twenty-five festivals recognized by the [[Christian Festival Association]]. It has hosted such bands as [[Relient K]], [[Kutless]], [[Anberlin]], and [[Family Force 5]]. In addition to hosting national bands on the main stages, it also allowed for local Christian bands in the area (and from around the state) to perform on side stages for the passing crowds to see and experience.

Starting during the 2004 festival, Cornerstone Florida made an emphasis on doing more than music as they introduced worship and seminar stages for those in attendance who were interested. Groups like [[Chris Tomlin]], [[Shane and Shane]], and others were featured. Although the worship-only stage was removed during the 2005-2007 festivals, worship leaders such as [[David Crowder]] were still prevalent and signed to play.

==Demise==
On December 10, 2007 it was announced on the Cornerstone Florida website that there would be no Cornerstone Florida in 2008, and no indication of a return of a Florida festival event.

The Cyber Crime Department ({{lang-el|Διεύθυνση Δίωξης Ηλεκτρονικού Εγκλήματος}}) of the [[Hellenic Police]], was founded in 1995 initially named '''Cyber Crime Unit''' until 2004 when it was upgraded to a department. Its headquarters is in [[Athens|City of Athens]].

== History ==
The Cyber Crime Unit was a conception of its former director, [[FBI]]-trained Brigadier General [[Manolis Sfakianakis]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.koolnews.gr/crime/manolis-sfakianakis-o-epikefalis-ton-ellinon-james-bond-tou-diadiktyou/&lt;/ref&gt;

The unit started operation with just two officers, and is currently run by over 80 law enforcement agents and civilians qualified with university degree and postgraduate studies.

== Sectors ==
The Cyber Crime Unit has the following sectors :
* [[Credit card fraud]]
* Financial fraud
* [[Child abuse]]
* Serious organized crime
* [[Cyber terrorism]]

== Services ==
It has resolved over 6,000 cases of fraud,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nooz.gr/tech/eksixniastike-apati-me-agores-apo-to-diadiktuo3413|title=Εξιχνιάστηκε απάτη με αγορές από το διαδίκτυο|first=|last=Nooz.gr|publisher=|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsnow.gr/article/402493/diakinouse-mi-egkekrimena-farmakeftika-skevasmata-meso-diadiktyou.html|title=Διακινούσε μη εγκεκριμένα φαρμακευτικά σκευάσματα μέσω διαδικτύου|publisher=|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; extortion and child abuse,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inews.gr/89/treis-syllipseis-gia-skliro-yliko-paidikis-pornografias.htm|title=Τρεις συλληψεις για σκληρο υλικο παιδικης πορνογραφιας...|publisher=|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while several resolved cases were only partially committed in [[Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsnow.gr/article/401216/exixniasi-ilektronikis-apatis-se-varos-trapezas.html|title=Εξιχνίαση ηλεκτρονικής απάτης σε βάρος τράπεζας|publisher=|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unit has intervened in an extremely large amount of suicide attempts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsbomb.gr/koinwnia/story/219413/simantiko-to-ergo-sfakianaki-kai-tis-dioxis-ilektronikoy-egklimatos|title=Σημαντικό το έργο Σφακιανάκη και της Δίωξης Ηλεκτρονικού Εγκλήματος|first=Θωμάς|last=Μόσχος|date=19 July 2012|publisher=|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; saving altogether over 600 lives.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.xrimaonline.gr/214510/apetrepse-autoktonia-i-dioxi-ilektronikou-egklimatos&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inews.gr/268/apetrepse-aftoktonia-i-dioxi-ilektronikou-egklimatos.htm|title=Απέτρεψε αυτοκτονία η Δίωξη Ηλεκτρονικού Εγκλήματος|publisher=|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the Cyber Crime Unit is operating a website called [http://www.cyberkid.gov.gr/ Cyber - Kid] which is providing useful information to children and parents using the Internet.

Since 2013, the Cyber Crime Unithas organised a number of conferences&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsbomb.gr/koinwnia/story/275194/2o-synedrio-asfaloys-ploigisis-apo-ti-dioxi-ilektronikoy-egklimatos|title=Συνέδριο Ασφαλούς Πλοήγησης από τη Δίωξη Ηλεκτρονικού Εγκλήματος|first=Μπάμπης|last=Αθανασόπουλος|date=30 January 2013|publisher=|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsbomb.gr/koinwnia/story/274489/2o-synedrio-asfaloys-ploigisis-apo-ti-dioxi-ilektronikoy-egklimatos|title=2ο Συνέδριο Ασφαλούς Πλοήγησης από τη Δίωξη Ηλεκτρονικού Εγκλήματος|first=Μπάμπης|last=Αθανασόπουλος|date=28 January 2013|publisher=|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; all over [[Greece]], to inform children and parents on the dangers of internet use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minocp.gov.gr/index.php?option=ozo_content&amp;perform=view&amp;id=3889&amp;Itemid=519&amp;lang=|title=24-10-2011:Παρουσίαση της νέας διαδικτυακής και διαδραστικής εφαρμογής χρήσιμων συμβουλών για την ασφαλή πλοήγηση στο διαδίκτυο - Υπ.

Hanna was kidnapped and held captive for several days in Ethiopia’s capital, [[Addis Ababa]]. One of six children, she attended a private high school in the city’s [[Ayer Tena]] neighbourhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2014/11/hana-lalango-ethiopiabrutalgangrapekidnapping.html|title = Hana Lalango Ethiopia Brutal Gang Rape Kidnapping|date = |accessdate = |website = Aljazeera|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Incident  ==

On 1 October, Hanna reportedly left school around 4 p.m. local time and got into a local taxi that already had a couple of passengers.

On 11 October 2014, Hanna was found unconscious in an abandoned area in the outskirts of the city, near [[Qeranyo]], and taken to hospital. For the next few days the family took her to various referral hospitals, and waited to be admitted. Among other injuries, Hanna suffered from [[fistula]]e and died 19 days after she was found.  She reportedly identified three of the five suspects from her hospital bed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ethioinfodesk.com/justice-hanna-gang-rape-victim/|title = Justice For Hanna Gang Rape Victim|date = |accessdate = |website = Ethio Info Desk|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arrests and Trial ==

On 19 November 2014, police brought five suspects before the [[First Appearance Court]] in Addis Ababa. During a hearing attended by journalists and women right’s groups, one of the suspects pleaded innocence and all five denied the allegations, telling the court their initial confessions were obtained under duress. The police denied torturing the suspects and asked for 14 days to conduct further investigation.

== Reaction ==
The violence of the attack and the extent of her injuries caused a flood of outrage in Addis Ababa that found expression on social media. The incident and death of Hanna has thrown a spotlight on how cultural attitudes could have facilitated this act of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yibekal|first1=Rediet|title=Violence Against Women in Ethiopia: The Case of #JusticeForHanna|url=http://cyberethiopia.com/2013/?p=1133|website=Cyber Ethiopia|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:dord.jpg|right|thumb|500px|An excerpt from Webster's showing the non-existent word "dord"]]

The word '''''dord''''' is a notable [[lexicographic error|error]] in [[lexicography]], an accidental creation, or [[ghost word]], of the [[Merriam-Webster|G. and C. Merriam Company]]'s staff in the ''[[Webster's Dictionary|New International Dictionary]]'', second edition (1934), in which the term is defined as a synonym for density used by physicists and chemists.&lt;ref name=Eschner&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/brief-history-dord-180962266/ | title=As "Dord" Shows, Being in the Dictionary Doesn't Always Mean Something's a Word | first= Kat|last= Eschner | date=28 February 2017 | publisher=Smithsonian | access-date=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philip Babcock Gove]], an editor at [[Merriam-Webster]] who became editor-in-chief of ''[[Webster's Third New International Dictionary]]'', wrote a letter to the journal ''American Speech'', fifteen years after the error was caught, in which he explained why "dord" was included in that dictionary.&lt;ref name="gove"&gt;{{cite journal| first= Philip Babcock|last= Gove| authorlink= Philip Babcock Gove| title= The History of 'Dord'| work= [[American Speech]] | volume= 29 |year= 1954| pages= 136–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 31, 1931, Austin M. Patterson, Webster's [[chemistry]] editor, sent in a slip reading "D or d, cont./density."  This was intended to add "[[density]]" to the existing list of words that the letter "D" can abbreviate. The slip somehow went astray, and the phrase  "D or d" was misinterpreted as a single, run-together word: ''Dord'' (This was a plausible mistake because headwords on slips were typed with spaces between the letters, making "D&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;d" look very much like "D&amp;nbsp;o&amp;nbsp;r&amp;nbsp;d").  A new slip was prepared for the printer and a part of speech assigned along with a pronunciation. The would-be word was not questioned or corrected by proofreaders, and it appeared on page 771 of the dictionary around 1934.&lt;ref name="gove"/&gt; It appeared between the entries for [[Dorcopsis (genus)|Dorcopsis]] (a type of small kangaroo) and [[Doré bullion|doré]] (golden in color).&lt;ref name=Eschner/&gt;

On February 28, 1939, an editor noticed "dord" lacked an [[etymology]] and investigated. Soon an order was sent to the printer marked "plate change/imperative/urgent". In 1940, bound books began appearing without the [[ghost word]] but with a new abbreviation (although inspection of printed copies well into the 1940s show "dord" still present).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| editor-first= William Allan| editor-last= Neilson| collaboration= yes| title= dord| work= Webster's New International Dictionary| edition= Second| publisher= G. &amp; C. Merriam Company| year= 1943}}&lt;/ref&gt; The non-word "dord" was excised, "density" was added as an additional meaning for the abbreviation "D or d" as originally intended,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.historychannel.com.au/this-day-in-history/erroneous-word-dord-is-discovered-in-dictionary/ | title=Erroneous word "Dord" is discovered in dictionary | publisher=History Channel | access-date=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the definition of the adjacent entry "[[Doré bar|Doré]] furnace" was expanded from "A furnace for refining dore [[bullion]]" to "a furnace in which dore bullion is refined" to close up the space.  Gove wrote that this was "probably too bad, for why shouldn't ''dord'' mean 'density'?"&lt;ref name="gove"/&gt; The entry "dord" was not removed until 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/video/0027-ghostword.htm?&amp;t=1359659566 | title=  Ask the Editor: Ghost Word| first= Emily| last= Brewster| website= Merriam-Webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11840">[[Super Bowl XXXIV]] (played in January 2000) featured 14 advertisements from 14 different [[Dot-com company|dot-com companies]], each of which paid an average of $2.2 million per spot.&lt;ref name="sfgate1"&gt;Pender, Kathleen.

Sources do not agree on the exact amount of dot-com advertisers who bought spots.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, five companies that were founded before the dot-com bubble also ran tech-related ads, for a grand total of 22 different dot-com ads. These ads amounted to nearly 20 percent of the 61 spots available,&lt;ref name="sfgate1"/&gt; and $44 million in advertising.&lt;ref name="bloom"/&gt; In addition to ads which ran during the game, several companies also purchased [[Pre-game show|pre-game]] ads, most of which are lesser known. All of the publicly held companies which advertised saw their stocks slump after the game as the dot-com bubble began to rapidly deflate.&lt;ref name="sfgate1"/&gt;

The sheer amount of dot-com-related ads was so unusual that Super Bowl XXXIV has been widely been referred to as the "Dot-Com Super Bowl",&lt;ref name="Comp1"/&gt; and it is often used as a high-water mark for the dot-com bubble.&lt;ref name="BizIn"&gt;Bennet, Dashiell.

==Effectiveness==
Many websites saw short-term gains from the advertisements. LastMinuteTravel.com, for example, reported a surge of 300,000 hits per minute during its advertisement broadcast.&lt;ref name="hosp"/&gt; In many cases, though, this did not translate into long-term gains. OurBeginning.com's revenue jumped 350% in Q1 of 2000, but its $5 million in advertising costs were still ten times what its customers spent.&lt;ref name="Venture"/&gt; Short-term gains were not enough to recoup advertising losses, and [[Pets.com]], Computer.com, and Epidemic.com, among many others, would fold before the end of the year.

==Later references==
Less than a year later, [[E-Trade|E*Trade]] ran an ad during [[Super Bowl XXXV]] mocking the glut of dot-com commercials during the previous game. The ad featured the chimpanzee from E*Trade's 2000 commercial wandering through a ghost town filled with the remains of fictional dot-com companies, including a direct reference to the already-defunct [[Pets.com]] sock puppet. During the game that year, only three dot-com companies ran advertisements.&lt;ref name="bloom"&gt;Hyman, Mark, and Tom Lowry.

===Companies founded before the bubble===
In addition to the companies listed above, several tech companies that were founded before the dot-com boom also ran ads. As these are outside the strict definition of a [[dot-com company]], since their founding significantly pre-dated the creation of a dot-com website, they have been listed separately.

{{POV-check|date=May 2015}}[[File:Gedenkstein Emser Depesche.jpg|thumb|150px|Memorial stone to the Ems Dispatch in [[Bad Ems]]]]
The '''Ems Dispatch''' ({{lang-fr|Dépêche d'Ems}}, {{lang-de|Emser Depesche}}), sometimes called the '''Ems Telegram''', incited [[France]] to declare the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in July 1870. The actual dispatch was an internal message from the Prussian King's vacationing site to [[Otto von Bismarck]] in Berlin, reporting demands made by the French ambassador; it was Bismarck's released statement to the press that became known as ''Ems Dispatch''. The name referred to [[Bad Ems]], a resort spa east of [[Koblenz]] on the [[Lahn]] river, then situated in [[Hesse-Nassau]], a new possession of [[Prussia]].

== Background ==
The 'Seven Weeks' [[Austro-Prussian War]] of 16 June - 23 August 1866, which involved south and north German states on both sides as well as an [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|emerging Italy]], increased Prussian power. Austria was defeated in the key [[Battle of Königgrätz]] (or Sadowa) on 3 July. The preliminary peace of Nikolsburg, 26 July, was followed by the Peace of Prague, 23 August. The result was that Bismarck was able to expel Austria from the German Confederation, to set up and dominate the [[North German Confederation]]—north of the Main—and secure Prussian territorial gains. Hanover, Schleswig-Holstein, Nassau and Hesse-Cassel, and Frankfurt were incorporated into the Prussian kingdom. Prussia's territory expanded by nearly a quarter and its population by more than four million to roughly twenty-four million, though still less than France's thirty-eight million. France did not take part in the war which, though brief, altered the European balance of power. France did not gain territories or prestige. French demands for a "Revanche pour Sadova" (Revenge for Sadowa) took root.&lt;ref name="Price2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Price|first=Roger|title=The French Second Empire: an anatomy of political power|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XcZ-OjYUR9QC&amp;pg=RA1-PA412&amp;dq=%22Revenge+for+Sadowa%22|year=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-80830-9|page=412}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1870, the German [[Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen|Prince Leopold]], of the Roman Catholic [[cadet branch]] [[Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen]],&lt;ref&gt;The Hohenzollerns originated from Schwaben.  Strictly speaking, the Sigmaringens, who remained in Schwaben, were the senior branch of the Hohenzollerns although the Brandenburg branch enjoyed much greater status throughout the history.&lt;/ref&gt; had been offered the vacant [[List of Spanish monarchs|Spanish throne]]. The government of French Emperor Napoleon III voiced concern over a possible Spanish alliance with the Protestant [[House of Hohenzollern]] that ruled the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], protested against it, and hinted about a war. Following the protests by France, Leopold had withdrawn his acceptance in July 1870. This was already considered a diplomatic defeat for Prussia. The French were not yet satisfied with this and demanded further commitments, especially a guarantee by the Prussian king that no member of any branch of his Hohenzollern family would ever be a candidate for the Spanish throne.

==The incident==
[[File:Wilhelm I at Bad Ems.jpg|thumb|left|Wilhelm I of Prussia in Ems]]
On 13 July 1870, [[Wilhelm I of Germany|King Wilhelm I of Prussia]], on his morning stroll in the Kurpark in Ems, was stopped by Count [[Vincent Benedetti]],&lt;ref&gt;Crankshaw, ''Bismarck'', p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; the French ambassador to Prussia since 1864. Benedetti had been instructed by his superior, Foreign Minister [[Agenor, duc de Gramont|Agénor, the Duc de Gramont]], to present the French demand that the king should guarantee that he would never again permit the candidacy of a Hohenzollern prince to the Spanish throne.&lt;ref&gt;In addition, the Prussian envoy in Paris, Baron von Werther, was asked that King Wilhelm send a letter to Napoleon III which would amount to a personal apology for the matter&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting was informal and took place on the promenade of the Kursaal with the king’s entourage at a discreet distance.  Politely, and in a friendly manner,&lt;ref&gt;Koch, ''A History of Prussia'', p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; "with the courtesy that never failed him," the king refused to bind himself to any course of action into the indefinite future. After their exchange, "the two departed coolly."&lt;ref name="Howard, p. 53"&gt;Howard, ''The Franco-Prussian War'', p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

From the meeting, the King's secretary [[Heinrich Abeken]] wrote an account, which was passed on to [[Otto von Bismarck]] in Berlin. Wilhelm described Benedetti as "annoyingly persistent". The King gave permission to Bismarck to release an account of the events.

Bismarck took it upon himself to edit the report, sharpening the language. He cut out Wilhelm’s conciliatory phrases and emphasized the real issue. The French had made certain demands under threat of war; and Wilhelm had refused them. This was no forgery; it was a clear statement of the facts.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, ''Bismarck, The Man and the Statesman'', p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly the edit of the telegram, released on the evening of the same day (13 July) to the media and foreign embassies, gave the impression both that Benedetti was rather more demanding and that the King was exceedingly abrupt. It was designed to give the French the impression that King Wilhelm I had insulted Count Benedetti; likewise, the Germans interpreted the modified dispatch as the Count insulting the King.

Bismarck had viewed the worsening relations with France with open satisfaction. If war had to come, now was as good a time as any. His editing, he assured his friends, "would have the effect of a red rag on the Gallic [French] bull."&lt;ref name="Howard, p. 55"&gt;Howard, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;  The edited telegram was to be presented henceforth as the cause of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text of the Ems Telegram==
Sent by Heinrich Abeken of the Prussian Foreign Office under King Wilhelm's Instruction to Bismarck.

===Abeken's message===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
His Majesty the King has written to me:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Count Benedetti intercepted me on the promenade and ended by demanding of me, in a very importunate manner, that I should authorize him to telegraph at once that I bound myself in perpetuity never again to give my consent if the Hohenzollerns renewed their candidature.

I rejected this demand somewhat sternly, as it is neither right nor possible to undertake engagements of this kind [for ever and ever].  Naturally, I told him that I had not yet received any news and, since he had been better informed via Paris and Madrid than I was, he must surely see that my government was not concerned in the matter.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[The King, on the advice of one of his ministers], decided, in view of the above-mentioned demands, not to receive Count Benedetti any more, but to have him informed, by an adjutant, that His Majesty had now received [from Leopold] confirmation of the news which Benedetti had already had from Paris and had nothing further to say to the ambassador.

His Majesty suggests to Your Excellency, that Benedetti's new demand and its rejection might well be communicated both to our ambassadors and to the Press.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Bismarck's published version===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
After the news of the renunciation of the Prince von Hohenzollern had been communicated to the Imperial French government by the Royal Spanish government, the French Ambassador in Ems made a further demand on His Majesty the King that he should authorize him to telegraph to Paris that His Majesty the King undertook for all time never again to give his assent should the Hohenzollerns once more take up their candidature.

His Majesty the King thereupon refused to receive the Ambassador again and had the latter informed by the Adjutant of the day that His Majesty had no further communication to make to the Ambassador.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===French translation===
The French translation by the agency [[Havas]] did not translate "Adjutant", which in German refers to a high-ranking [[aide de camp]], but in French describes only a [[non-commissioned officer]] (''adjudant''), so implying that the King had deliberately insulted the ambassador by not choosing an officer to carry the message to him. This was the version published by most newspapers the following day, which happened to be July 14 ([[Bastille Day]]),&lt;ref&gt;Sedan 1870 by Douglas Fermer. 2008&lt;/ref&gt; setting the tone, letting the French believe that the king had insulted their ambassador, before the ambassador could tell his story.

==Results==
France's mistaken attitude of its own position carried matters far beyond what was necessary, and France mobilized.&lt;ref name="Koch, p. 267"&gt;Koch, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; Following further improper translations and misinterpretations of the dispatch in the press, excited crowds in Paris demanded war, just as Bismarck had anticipated.&lt;ref name="Howard, p. 55"/&gt; The Ems Dispatch had also rallied German national feeling. It was no longer Prussia alone; South German particularism was now cast aside.&lt;ref name="Koch, p. 267"/&gt;

Benedetti, the messenger for the Duc de Gramont's demands for pointless guarantees (the Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen family had withdrawn Prince Leopold’s candidature on 11 July 1870 with Wilhelm's "entire and unreserved approval"&lt;ref name="Howard, p. 53"/&gt;), became an unseen bit-player; his own dispatches to Paris no longer mattered.  In the legislative chamber, by an overwhelming majority, the votes for war credits were passed.  France declared war on 19 July 1870, starting the [[Franco-Prussian War]].&lt;ref&gt;Howard, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; Following the French defeat in 1871, the Duc de Gramont attempted to throw the blame for the failures of French diplomacy on Benedetti. In his defence Count Benedetti published his version of the events in ''Ma Mission en Prusse'' (Paris, 1871).

The [[explosion]] of [[animal]]s is an uncommon event arising through natural causes or human activity. Among the best known examples are the [[post-mortem]] [[Exploding whale|explosion of whales]], either as a result of natural [[decomposition]] or deliberate attempts at [[Carrion|carcass]] disposal.&lt;ref name="hackstadtevidence"&gt;Steven Hackstadt, [http://www.theexplodingwhale.com/#evidence The Evidence], TheExplodingWhale.com Accessed November 7, 2005; [http://perp.com/whale/ The Infamous Exploding Whale] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029125043/http://www.perp.com/whale/ |date=2007-10-29 }} perp.com, Accessed June 6, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Other instances of exploding animals are defensive in nature or the result of human intervention.

==Causes of explosions==

Natural explosions can occur for a variety of reasons. [[Post-mortem]] explosions, like that of a [[beached whale|beached]] [[exploding whale|whale]], are the result of the build-up of natural gases created by methane-producing bacteria inside the carcass during the decomposition process.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3437455.stm Sperm whale explodes in Taiwanese City]," ''eTaiwan News'', January 27, 2004 (accessed November 17, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Natural explosions which occur while an animal is living may be defense-related.

===Weaponization===
Various [[military]] attempts have been made to use animals as delivery systems for weapons. In [[Song Dynasty]] China, oxen carrying large explosive charges were used as self-propelled explosive missiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turnbull|first=Stephen|title=Siege Weapons of the Far East: AD 300–1300|year=2001|publisher=Osprey Publishing|page=40|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=12uahIduJj4C&amp;lpg=PT38&amp;ots=BvprTUWCMu&amp;dq=China%2C%20ox%20bomb%20weapon&amp;pg=PT38#v=onepage&amp;q=China,%20ox%20bomb%20weapon&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During [[World War II]] the [[United States]] investigated the use of "[[bat bomb]]s", or [[bat]]s carrying small [[Incendiary device|incendiary bomb]]s,&lt;ref Name=AFA&gt;[http://www.afa.org/magazine/1990/1090bat.asp The Bat Bombers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206195359/http://www.afa.org/magazine/1990/1090bat.asp |date=2006-12-06 }}, C.

== Examples ==

===Ants===

Some insects explode [[altruism|altruistically]], at the expense of the individual in defense of its [[ant colony|colony]]; the process is called [[autothysis]]. Several species of [[ant]]s, such as ''[[Camponotus saundersi]]'' in southeast [[Asia]], can explode at will to protect their nests from intruders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jones TH, Clark DA, Edwards AA, Davidson DW, Spande TF, Snelling RR |journal=J.

Two oversized, poison-filled mandibular glands run the entire length of the ant's body. When combat takes a turn for the worse, the ant violently contracts its abdominal muscles to rupture its body and spray poison in all directions. Likewise, many species of [[termite]]s, such as ''[[Globitermes sulphureus]]'', have members, deemed the soldier class, who can split their bodies open emitting a noxious and sticky chemical for the same reason.&lt;ref name="GR3922"&gt;{{cite book | last = Piper | first = Ross | title = Extraordinary Animals | publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group | date = 2007-08-30 | location = Santa Barbara, CA | pages = 25–27 | url =http://www.extraordinaryanimals.com | doi = 10.1336/0313339228 | id = GR3922 | isbn = 978-0-313-33922-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cows===
In January 1932, the ''[[Townsville Daily Bulletin]]'', an Australian newspaper, reported an incident where a [[dairy cow]] was partially blown up and killed on a farm at Kennedy Creek (near [[Cardwell, Queensland|Cardwell]], [[North Queensland]]). The cow had reputedly picked up a [[detonator]] in her mouth while grazing in a paddock. This was only triggered later, when the cow began to chew her [[cud]], at a time when she was in the process of being [[Milking|milked]]. The cow had its head blown off by the resulting explosion, and the farmer milking the cow was knocked unconscious.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article61348469 "Was it suicide?: A moo-cow's end"] – ''[[Townsville Daily Bulletin]]'' (Qld.: 1907–1954), 15 January 1932. Accessed 5 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rats ===
The [[explosive rat]], also known as a rat bomb, was a weapon developed by the British Special Operations Executive in World War II for use against Germany. Rat carcasses were filled with plastic explosives, and were to be distributed near German boiler rooms, where it was expected they would be disposed of by burning, with the subsequent explosion having a chance of causing a boiler explosion. The explosive rats never saw use, as the first shipment was intercepted by the Germans; however, the resulting search for more booby trapped rats consumed enough German resources for the SOE to conclude that the operation was a success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.military-history.org/weapons-technology/back-to-the-drawing-board-exploding-rats.htm|title=Back to the Drawing Board — EXPLODING RATS!|website=Military History Monthly|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toads===

According to worldwide media reports in April 2005, [[toad]]s in the [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]] district of Hamburg were observed by nature protection officials to swell up with [[gas]]es and explode, propelling their innards for distances of up to one meter. These incidents prompted local residents to refer to the area's lake—home to the toads—as "Tümpel des Todes" (Pool of Death). The incidents were reported as occurring with greatest frequency between 2 and 3 a.m. Werner Smolnik, [[environmental movement]] worker, stated on April 26, 2005, at least 1,000 toads had died in this manner over a series of a few days.&lt;ref name=msnbc&gt;{{cite news|title =Hungry crows may be behind exploding toads   
|work =msnbc.com|publisher =Microsoft|date =2005-04-28| url =http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7654561/|accessdate = 2007-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a [[witness]], "toads swell up to three-and-a-half times their normal size before blowing up", and were noted to live a short time after exploding.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Berlin [[Veterinary physician|veterinarian]] Franz Mutschmann collected toad corpses and performed [[necropsy|necropsies]]. He theorised that the phenomenon was linked to a recent influx of predatory [[crow]]s to the area. He stated that the cause was a mixture of crow attacks and the natural puff up defense of the toads. Crows attacked the toads to pick through the skin between the amphibian's chest and abdominal cavity, picking out the liver, which appears to be a delicacy for crows in the area. In a defensive move, the toads begin to blow themselves up, which in turn, due to the hole in the toad's body and the missing liver, led to a rupture of blood vessels and lungs, and to the spreading of intestines. The apparent epidemic nature of the phenomenon was also explained by Mutschmann: "Crows are intelligent animals. They learn very quickly how to eat the toads' livers."&lt;ref name=msnbc/&gt;   
   
Initial theories had included a [[virus|viral]] or [[fungus|fungal]] infection, possibly one also affecting foreign [[horse]]s involved in [[horse racing|racing]] at a nearby track. However, laboratory tests were unable to detect an infectious agent.&lt;ref name=msnbc/&gt;

{{Donizetti operas}}
'''''Fausta''''' is a [[melodramma]], or [[opera seria]], in two acts by [[Gaetano Donizetti]]. The Italian [[libretto]] was partly written by [[Domenico Gilardoni]], who died while doing so: the remainder was written by Donizetti. The literary source of the opera's libretto is ''Crispo'', a tragedy improvised by Tommaso Sgricci on 3 November 1827.&lt;ref&gt;Ciarlantini, Paola 2014, pp.&amp;nbsp;43–60&lt;/ref&gt;

The opera successfully debuted on 12 January 1832 at the [[Teatro di San Carlo]] in Naples, and was written with prima donna [[Giuseppina Ronzi de Begnis]] in mind. De Begnis was rumored to be the King's mistress.

Although the libretto had irked the chief censor, the production went ahead, supposedly because of De Begnis' influence in high places. Donizetti wrote this opera for the birthday of King [[Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies]]. [[Walter Scott]] was present at the premiere and it has been suggested that the King introduced him to the composer; Scott thought that ''Fausta'' was “without any remarkable music.”&lt;ref&gt;Allitt, John Stewart, 2003 p. 339&lt;/ref&gt; The opera marked the beginning of an important and fruitful collaboration with Ronzi de Begnis. Only 18 days separate the premiere of Bellini's ''[[Norma (opera)|Norma]]'' at [[La Scala]] and Donizetti's new opera – both set in ancient Rome and her Empire. Donizetti's aim was not to compete with Bellini's opera but simply to expand on the success of his ''[[Anna Bolena]]'' of 1830.

The opera, based on historical events, involves the complications that ensue when [[Fausta]], the wife of [[Constantine the Great|Emperor Constantine I]] falls in love with her stepson. Historical accuracy leaves something to be desired; in fact Maximian had died much before the incestuous scandal involving Fausta and [[Crispus]] exploded.

==Performance history==
&lt;div style="float: right;"&gt;[[File:Giuditta Pasta Kriehuber-detail.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|Giuditta Pasta,&lt;br /&gt;by [[Josef Kriehuber|Kriehuber]]]]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="float: right;"&gt;[[File:Adelaide Tosi-head&amp;shoulders.jpg|thumb|upright|Adelaide Tosi]]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="float: right;"&gt;[[File:Luigi Lablache-small.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Luigi Lablache]]&lt;/div&gt;
When the opera was performed at the Teatro del Fondo on 30 August and 2 September 1832, Donizetti added a duet for [[Luigi Lablache]] who had replaced Tamburini in the role of Costantino. Donizetti was not pleased with his interpretation; however, this was one of the very rare instances in which the composer made a negative remark about the famous bass.

''Fausta'' was performed for the first time at [[La Scala]], Milan, on 26 December 1832, as the prestigious season's premiere; the public fell in love with it and this resulted in a total of 31 performances. For this occasion Donizetti added an [[overture]], and a [[cavatina]] ''Par che mi dica ancor'' for the soprano [[Adelaide Tosi]]. The composer borrowed this ''aria di sortita'' from his earlier ''[[Il castello di Kenilworth]]'' and changed the words in ''Ah, se d'amor potessi''. Furthermore, an aria for the tenor ''Se crudel cosi m'estimi'' was added without Donizetti's consent.

Nevertheless the lyrics were later recycled by Donizetti for a tenor aria added to the January 1834 production at the [[Teatro Regio di Torino]]. In 1833, ''Fausta'' was performed at [[La Fenice]] in Venice, with [[Giuditta Pasta]] as Fausta and [[Domenico Donzelli]] as Crispo receiving mixed reviews. For this occasion Donizetti added a new scene at the beginning with a new aria for Fausta and, in act 2, a new duet ''Per te rinunzio al soglio'' for Fausta and Crispo. This duet was later utilized for ''Buondelmonte'' and ultimately in ''Maria Stuarda'' for the Milanese premiere of this opera as a duet for Maria and Leicester, ''Ben io comprendi''; later, in 1865 for a Naples production the words were changed to those used ever since: ''Da tutti abbandonata''. Additionally, for the Venice production Donizetti wrote a duet (act 2) for Costantino and Crispo, ''T'amo ancora'' replacing the baritone's aria ''Se di regnar desio''; and finally, a tenor's aria (also in act 2) ''Ah! perche dirmi crudel''.

In 1841, for a La Scala production, Donizetti added a duet for tenor and baritone, '' E che mi valse...'', borrowing from earlier operas ''Pia de Tolomei'' and ''Il diluvio universale''.&lt;ref&gt;Bini and Commons 1997, pp. 271–273&lt;/ref&gt; Other important premieres include Madrid in 1833, Lisbon and Barcelona in 1834; Palermo, Genoa and Bologna also in 1834; Berlin in 1835; Havana in 1837; Vienna in 1841; London in 1841 (described as a "failure"); and Rio de Janeiro in 1850.

The opera received its first performance in modern times when it was revived at the [[Rome Opera]] in 1981 with [[Raina Kabaivanska]] in the title role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Patmore|first1=David|title=Raina Kabaivanska|url=https://www.naxos.com/person/Raina_Kabaivanska/7255.htm|website=naxos.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Act 1===
''Scene 1: The Capitol Square, with the Temple of Jupiter in the background''

The populace welcomes the return of victorious Crispus, son of Emperor Constantine and his first wife Minervina. A high priest by the altar is waiting to crown Crispus who has been successful in his campaign against the Gauls. Fausta, the second wife of Constantine, and her father Maximian (archrival of the Emperor), as well as Licinia, Constantine himself and scores of prisoners witness the triumph of Crispus. Fausta looks at him and feels the pangs of her incestuous love; Constantine rejoices and Beroe, one the prisoners, remembers her love at first sight for Crispus. Constantine notices her and wonders about the female prisoner; Crispus explains that she is the daughter of a prince and declares his love for her. Fausta is stunned by the development and the Emperor tells Beroe to come forward; she declares her love and Constantine tells her that he is going to marry them that very day. Fausta is devastated by the announcement and tells her husband that the wedding will have to be set for the following day because the goddess Vesta so requires. Licinia and those attending the event rejoice. After the jubilation, everyone leaves except Maximian who is conspiring against the Emperor, and although he failed his first attempt to kill both father and son, this time he is sure he will succeed.

''Scene 2: The magnificent imperial apartments''

The Empress’ maids wonder why she no longer smiles. Fausta, in deep thought, is depressed and asks the servants and Licinia to leave. Alone, Fausta is perturbed by her unrequited love for Crispus and she feels that her only rewards are tears and endless despair.

''Scenes 3, 4, 5, and 6: The pavilion''

Licinia accompanies Crispus to the pavilion where Fausta is planning to meet him. After arriving, she ensures that no one is in sight and tells her stepson that she has to unveil a secret that has caused her great distress. It is no state secret, but her love for someone.

Unexpected, Beroe arrives much to the delight of her lover, Fausta shudders, and explains to the Empress that Maximian needs to see her. Fausta tells her rival to leave. When they are alone again she implores Crispus to forget Beroe and to direct his love to someone who is really passionately devoted to him. He begins to understand what she means by a secret and is horrified by her revelation; he tries to leave, but she grabs his hand and tells him that if he rejects her, Beroe will perish. He falls on his knees and begs her not to do that.

Constantine, Beroe, Maximian, members of the imperial household, Licinia and the maids arrive. The Emperor is suspicious seeing the son prostrated before his wife. When she explains that he was professing his love for her, all are aghast and even Beroe believes he is guilty. The Empress whisper to Crispus that she is willing to recant and die if he loves her. Maximian is overjoyed because the turn of events is very favourable to his plans to topple Constantine who is determined to exile the son. Crispus, in turn, blames Fausta for the curse the father has cast on him; she begins to see the early signs of the great tragedy she has unleashed.

===Act 2===
''Scenes 1, 2, 3 and 4: A grove close to the imperial palace''

It is night. Maximinian, who dreams to become Emperor before sunrise, has summoned his followers to murder both Crispus and Constantine.

While Maximinian and his men prepare to leave, Crispus and Beroe arrive. The former captive princess explains that Licinia has confessed to Fausta’s machinations. Maximian suspects there are other people in the grove and, when he bumps into Crispus, both become very suspicious of each other and brandish their swords.

Holding torches, Maximian’s followers, along with Constantine, appear. Seeing him with his greatest enemy, the Emperor declares that his son is plotting to get rid of him. Crispus kneels at his feet saying that he is ready to die. He professes his innocence on all accusations. The father responds that the judges and the Senate will decide his fate. Crispus is arrested and carried away by the pretorians.

At dawn, Beroe and Licinia talk about the impending trial that will sentence Crispus to death.

''Scenes 5 and 6: The Senate Hall''

The senators have gathered and the Emperor arrives escorted by his guards. Constantine realizes he still has deep feelings for his son and warns Maximian to give a factual deposition. However, during his narration he alleges that Crispus was planning to kill the Emperor. Crispus responds that this is a lie and asks Beroe to tell the facts. She explains that Crispus is innocent and that she is ready to be exiled with him, the truth being that Maximian and his assassins were ready to kill both father and son. Crispus confirms this explanation, but the father tells the senators to remember what had just been said. Constantine wants to speak to Crispus and all are asked to leave, but although he professes love for the son, when he sees no tears coming from the eyes of Crispus he remains convinced that the son is guilty. Crispus responds that an innocent person has no tears. The senators are summoned back to the hall and deliver a guilty verdict. Constantine realizes that he is about to send his son to the executioner and, trembling, he signs the death warrant.

''Scenes 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11: The atrium of the jail''

Jailer Albino feels very sorry for the 20-year-old Crispus. Fausta enters and asks him to bring her stepson; she realizes that this is her last chance. Crispus cannot believe his eyes and ears as she professes love for him in a desperate delirium. Fausta tells him that they can run away, but he shows her the poison inside his ring. She snatches the ring and utters "Love will save you."

Maximian and four armed guards arrive. Fausta is ordered to leave, but she resists and begs the father not to execute Crispus. One of the guards returns from Crispus’ cell and confirms that the execution has been carried out. Fausta ingests the poison from the ring and collapses, Maximian rushes to the cell and hears voices calling for his own death.

Constantine has heard the truth from Maximian’s hitmen and arrives with Beroe, Licinia, the Empress’s maids and his pretorians. In his hand is the signed pardon for his son, but Maximian proudly and cynically confirms that his son is dead. Meanwhile Fausta has regained some of her strength and tells Constantine about her lies. When the infuriated Emperor remonstrates that she will pay the ultimate price, she confesses that she has taken a deadly poison. Everyone is horrified and in unison respond, "Evil woman; there is no bigger monster than you on earth."

[[Image:Ballons vista aerea.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Flying above the Ancient Castle during the [[Ferrara]] Balloons Festival]]
'''Ferrara Balloons Festival''' is a yearly [[hot air balloon festival]] that takes place in [[Ferrara]], [[Italy]] and is considered to be one of the largest festivals{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} of [[hot air ballooning]] in [[Europe]], with numerous teams from Italy and other parts of the world bringing their traditional or uniquely shaped aircraft. It lasts for ten days. 

The first festival began in 2005. 
One of the most popular features of the Festival is the ascent of balloons in the sky, all setting off from the Bassani Urban Park just outside the [[Renaissance]] city walls of the UNESCO World Heritage City.

Organised by the city council and the provincial administration of [[Ferrara]], the festival also features concerts, shows, entertainment and a grand Village of the Air with attractions, shops and food outlets.

'''Formula Three''', also called '''Formula 3''' or '''F3''', is a class of [[open wheel car|open-wheel]] [[formula racing]]. The various championships held in Europe, Australia, South America and Asia form an important step for many prospective [[Formula One]] drivers. Formula Three has traditionally been regarded as the first major stepping stone for F1 hopefuls &amp;ndash; it is typically the first point in a driver's career at which most drivers in the series are aiming at professional careers in racing rather than being amateurs and enthusiasts. F3 is not cheap, but is regarded as a key investment in a young driver's future career. Success in F3 can lead directly to a [[FIA_Formula_2_Championship|Formula 2]] seat or even a [[Formula One]] [[third driver|test]] or race seat.

==History==
[[Image:Effyh500-front.jpg|thumb|A typical early car, the Effyh 500 (1947–1952) was built in Malmö, Sweden and was one of the more successful cars. It had a lightweight tube chassis, aluminium bodywork and was powered by a 500cc 1-cylinder JAP engine.]]

Formula Three (adopted by the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] in 1950) evolved from [[postwar]] [[auto racing]], with lightweight tube-frame [[chassis]] powered by 500 cc [[motorcycle]] engines (notably [[Norton (motorcycle)|Norton]]s and [[JA Prestwich Industries Ltd|JAP]] speedway). The 500 cc formula originally evolved in 1946 from low-cost "special" racing organised by enthusiasts in [[Bristol]],  England, just before the [[World War II|Second World War]]; British motorsport after the war picked up slowly, partly due to petrol rationing which continued for a number of years and home-built 500 cc cars engines were intended to be accessible to the "impecunious enthusiast". The second post-war motor race in Britain was organised by the [[VSCC]] in July 1947 at RAF Gransden Lodge, 500cc cars being the only post-war class to run that day. Unfortunately the race was a complete flop, as three of the seven entrants were non-starters, and, of the four runners, all but one were out of it in the first lap, leaving [[Eric Brandon]] in his [[Cooper Car Company|Cooper]] Prototype (T2) trailing round to a virtual walk-over at the unimpressive speed of 55.79&amp;nbsp;mph, though his best lap (which was the fastest recorded for any 500) was 65.38&amp;nbsp;mph.

Cooper came to dominate the formula with mass-produced cars, and the income this generated enabled the company to develop into the senior categories. Other notable marques included [[Kieft Cars|Kieft]], JBS and [[Emeryson]] in England, and Effyh, Monopoletta and Scampolo in Europe. John Cooper, along with most other 500 builders, decided to place the engine in the middle of the car, driving the rear wheels. This was mostly due to the practical limitations imposed by chain drive but it gave these cars exceptionally good handling characteristics which eventually led to the mid-engined revolution in single-seater racing.
&lt;gallery&gt;

Image:Ralt RT 1 1978 Formula 3 EMS.jpg|'''1970s''': [[Ralt]] RT 1
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The 500cc formula was the usual route into motor racing through the early and mid-1950s (and stars like [[Stirling Moss]] continued to enter selected F3 events even during their GP careers).  Other notable 500 cc Formula 3 drivers include [[Stuart Lewis-Evans]], [[Ivor Bueb]], [[Jim Russell (racing driver)|Jim Russell]], [[Peter Collins (racing driver)|Peter Collins]], [[Don Parker (racing driver)|Don Parker]], [[Ken Tyrrell]], and [[Bernie Ecclestone]].

From a statistical point of view, [[Don Parker (racing driver)|Don Parker]] was the most successful F3 driver. Although coming to motor racing late in life (at age 41 in 1949), he won a total of 126 F3 races altogether, and was described by Motor Sport magazine (in his 1998 obituary) as "the most successful Formula 3 driver in history." Although [[Stirling Moss]] was already a star by 1953, Parker beat him more than any other driver, and was Formula 3 Champion in 1952, again in 1953, and in 1954 he only lost the title by a half-point. He took the title for a third time in 1959.

In 1954, Parker took on a young man named [[Graham Hill|Norman Graham Hill]] as his mechanic and general assistant, and gave him his first taste of competitive motorsport in a 500cc car at Brands Hatch. Some years later, now using his middle name of Graham, this young man twice became Formula 1 World Champion (1962 and 1968).

Parker retired from Formula Three after the 1959 season, and chose not to move to Formula 2 or Formula 1 because of his age. However, he did race for one final season (1960), representing Jaguar in the British Saloon Car Championships, and winning at Oulton Park on June 6 in his XK150. As a retirement gift in 1961, Jaguar's Lofty England presented him with a specially-designed 3.8 litre Jaguar Mark 2. It was claimed to be the fastest Mark 2 Jaguar had built, being tested at 140&amp;nbsp;mph on the newly opened (but as yet unrestricted) M4 motorway in 1963.

500cc Formula Three declined at an international level during the late 1950s, although it continued at a national level into the early 60s, being eclipsed by [[Formula Junior]] for 1000 or 1100 cc cars (on a sliding scale of weights).

A one-litre Formula Three category for four-cylinder carburetted cars, with heavily tuned production engines, was reintroduced in 1964 based on the Formula Junior rules and ran to 1970. These engines (a short-stroke unit based on the [[Ford Anglia]]&lt;ref&gt;Gauld, Graham, "Ford", in ''World of Automobiles'' (London: Orbis, 1974), Volume 6, p.696&lt;/ref&gt; with a special 2-[[valve]] [[Cosworth]] or [[Holbay]] [[overhead valve|OHV]] down-draught [[cylinder head|head]] being by far the most efficient and popular) tended to rev very highly and were popularly known as "screamers"; F3 races tended to involve large packs of [[slipstream]]ing cars. The "screamer" years were dominated by [[Brabham]], [[Team Lotus|Lotus]] and [[Tecno (motorsport)|Tecno]], with [[March Engineering|March]] beginning in 1970. Early one-litre F3 chassis tended to descend from [[Formula Junior]] designs but quickly evolved.

For 1971 new regulations allowing 1600 cc engines with a restricted air intake were introduced. The 1971–73 seasons were contested with these cars, as [[aerodynamics]] started to become important.

Two-litre engine rules were introduced for 1974, still with restricted air intakes. {{As of
|2011|6
|alt=Today}} engine regulations remain basically unchanged in F3, a remarkable case of stability in racing regulations.

As the likes of Lotus and Brabham faded from F3 to concentrate on Formula One, F3 constructors of the 1970s included [[Alpine (automobile)|Alpine]], [[Lola Cars|Lola]], March, [[Modus Developments|Modus]], [[Group Racing Developments|GRD]], [[Ralt]], and [[Ensign (racing team)|Ensign]].

Image:Red Bull Formula Three car.jpg|'''2000s''': [[Dallara]] F305
&lt;/gallery&gt;

By the start of the 1980s however, Formula Three had evolved well beyond its humble beginnings to something closely resembling the modern formula. It was seen as the main training ground for future Formula One drivers, many of them bypassing Formula Two to go straight into Grand Prix racing. The chassis became increasingly sophisticated, mirroring the more senior formulae &amp;ndash; [[ground effect in cars|ground effect]]s were briefly used in the early 1980s but were banned, in line with other FIA single-seater formulae; [[carbon fibre]] chassis started to be introduced from the mid-1980s.

Historically, March (up to 1981), Ralt (up to the early 1990s) and [[Reynard Motorsport|Reynard]] (1985–1992) had been the main chassis manufacturers in two-litre F3, with [[Martini (cars)|Martini]] fairly strong in France; Reynard pioneered use of [[carbon fibre]] in the mid-1980s replacing traditional [[aluminium]] or [[steel]] [[monocoque]] structures. [[Dallara]] however, after an unsuccessful Formula One project, focussed their attention on the formula in the early nineties and obliterated all the other marques with their F393. Within a couple of years, the chassis was considered a prerequisite to competitiveness, and today Dallara chassis are ubiquitous to the formula. In order to keep costs down, their chassis have had a three-year life-cycle, with only minor annual updates. It was agreed however to extend the life-cycle of the current F308 to four years to assist teams during the economic recession; this chassis however, has been replaced in 2012 with the new F312 chassis, intended to be run until 2017. Most F3 championships, most notably the [[British Formula 3|British]] series, offer a secondary class for cars from the previous life-cycle in order to provide a cheap point of entry for lesser funded teams and drivers.

==F3 cars==
Formula Three cars are [[monocoque]] [[chassis]], using [[slick tyre|slick]] racing [[Tyre (wheel)|tyres]] and [[wing]]s. Currently, [[Dallara]] manufactures the overwhelming majority of F3 cars, though [[Mygale]], [[Lola Cars|Lola]] (formerly in partnership with [[Dome (constructor)|Dome]] of Japan), [[ArtLine Racing|Arttech]], and SLC also have a limited output. In many smaller or amateur F3 racing series older cars are frequently seen. Usually these series are divided into two or more classes, to allow more participation.

[[Internal combustion engine|Engine]]s in Formula 3 are all 2-[[litre]], 4-cylinder naturally aspirated [[specification|spec]] engines. Engines must be built from a production model [[engine block|block]] (''stock block''), and often must be sealed by race or series organizers, so no private [[engine tuning|tuning]] can be carried out. [[Honda]] engines (prepared by [[Mugen Motorsports|Mugen]]) have perennially been popular, as have engines produced by [[Volkswagen]], [[Alfa Romeo in motorsport|Alfa Romeo]], or [[Renault]]. Currently the HWA-tuned [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] and the Volkswagen engines dominate the British and European series, with Mugen, [[TOM'S]]&amp;ndash;[[Toyota]], [[Opel]], and [[Fiat]] being used by some teams.

==Championships and series==
[[Image:P1000588b.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sebastian Vettel]] demonstrating his [[Formula 3 Euro Series]] car (2006)]]
There has never been a World Championship for Formula Three. In the 1970s and into the 1980s the European Formula Three Championship and [[British Formula 3 Championship]] (once one series had emerged from the competing British series in the 1970s) were the most prominent, with a number of future Formula One champions coming from them. France, Germany, and Italy also had important Formula Three series, but interest in these was originally subsidiary to national formulae &amp;ndash; [[Formula Renault]] in France and [[Formula Super Vee]] in Germany. These nations eventually drifted towards Formula Three. The Italian series tended to attract older drivers who moved straight across from [[kart]]ing whereas in other nations drivers typically graduated to F3 after a couple of years in minor categories. The European series died out in the mid-1980s and the national series became correspondingly more important. For 2003, [[French Formula Three Championship|French]] and [[German Formula Three Championship|German F3]], both suffering from a lack of competitive entrants, merged to recreate the [[Formula 3 Euro Series]].

Brazil's [[Formula Three Sudamericana|SudAm Formula Three Championship]], which now has the most powerful engine of all Formula Three series, was known for producing excellent drivers who polished their skills in the British Formula 3 championship. Perhaps the most curious of all was the small [[All-Japan Formula Three Championship]].  Although few drivers spent a significant amount of time there, future stars such as [[Ralf Schumacher]] and [[Jacques Villeneuve]] scored victories there. An Asian series was established in 2001 and grew to produce past A1 drivers for Indonesia and Australia.

===Special races===

In addition to the many national series, Formula Three is known for major non-championship races typically including entries from the national series, the best-known of which is the [[Macau Grand Prix|FIA World Cup at Macau]]. The first Formula Three Grand Prix of Macau was held in 1983 and won by [[Ayrton Senna]]. [[Michael Schumacher]], [[David Coulthard]], [[Ralf Schumacher]], and [[Takuma Sato]] have also won there. The Formula Three Grand Prix of Macau traditionally marks the end of the Formula Three season, with drivers from almost every national series participating.

Other major races include the [[Pau Grand Prix]] (from 1999 to 2006), the [[Masters of Formula 3]] (traditionally held at [[Circuit Park Zandvoort|Zandvoort]]), and the [[Korea Super Prix]] at [[Changwon]]. These events give fans in locations not visited by other major series a way to experience major international racing.

The [[Monaco Grand Prix Formula Three support race|Monaco F3 Grand Prix]] held until 1997 was also a famous special race. It was restored in [[2005 Monaco Grand Prix Formula Three|2005]] only, as a part of the F3 Euro Series.

'''Frank Murray Dixon''' (July 25, 1892 – October 11, 1965) was an [[United States|American]] [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] [[politician]]. He served as the [[List of Governors of Alabama|40th]] [[Governor of Alabama|Governor]] of [[Alabama]] from 1939 to 1943 and is most known for reorganizing the state government and reforming the way property taxes were assessed.

==Early life==
Dixon was born in [[Oakland, California]] to Reverend Frank Dixon and Laura Dixon. Dixon spent the majority of his youth in [[Virginia]] and attended public schools in both Virginia and [[Washington, DC]]. He graduated from Phillips Exeter Preparatory School ([[Phillips Exeter Academy]]) and then went on to graduate from [[Columbia University]]. In 1916 he obtained his law degree from the [[University of Virginia]]. He began his law career in [[Birmingham, Alabama]] in the law firm of Captain [[Francis S. White]]. Soon after he married Juliet Perry, with whom he had a son and a daughter.

His law practice was interrupted by [[World War I]]. Dixon enlisted in the Royal Canadian Air Corps as a volunteer. As a second [[lieutenant]], Dixon was assigned to the French [[escadrille]] as an [[aerial observer]] and [[machine gunner]]. In July 1918 he was wounded when his plane was shot down over [[Soissons, France]], which in turn required his leg to be [[amputated]]. Dixon was awarded the [[Croix de Guerre]] with Palm by the French government; the French government also named him [[Cavalier|chevalier]] of the [[French Legion of Honor]] and promoted him to [[major]].

When he returned to Birmingham, he founded his own law partnership, Bowers and Dixon, and became a successful [[corporate lawyer]]. At that point he became a [[commander]] of the [[American Legion]] and was active in veterans’ causes. In 1934 Dixon made his first attempt at the governorship of Alabama, but lost the [[Alabama gubernatorial election, 1934|Democratic primary]] to [[Bibb Graves]]. However, in 1938 he easily defeated his opponent and succeeded Graves as the Governor of Alabama.

==Governor of Alabama==
Before his [[inauguration]] Dixon spent an extensive amount of time preparing for his term. He met with Bibb Graves, public administration experts and [[Franklin Roosevelt]] to get advice and expertise on his plans for changing Alabama’s government. As governor, Dixon strove to streamline the state government. He eliminated twenty-seven government agencies in the state by consolidating duties within the departments. The agencies that originally were under the leadership of committees were placed under the authority of one individual who reported directly to the governor. He, therefore, also centralized power in the office of the governor. He terminated the employment of every state employee added to the payroll after the date of his inauguration and ordered every employee that did not have specific duties to be terminated as well. He pushed through a teachers’ [[retirement]] system and a teacher [[tenure]] law. He also established a state [[civil service]] system that required the hiring of state employees to be based on a merit system.

Dixon spent a great amount of time reforming the [[property tax]] assessment method in the state. Dixon believed that the property tax review boards that were assigned by the county deliberately under-assessed property taxes. This, in turn, led to inadequately supported school districts and municipal services. He pushed through his reform bill that required local assessment boards be replaced by a three-person board, which would be appointed by the governor.

As [[World War II]] began at the end of his term, Dixon’s accomplishments only increased. He oversaw a wartime reorganization of the docks in [[Mobile, Alabama]] that resulted in a four-hundred percent increase in barge traffic. Alabama’s economy flourished with the ship building and repairing industry brought about by the war.

==Post gubernatorial years==
After Dixon left office in 1943, he returned to his corporate law practice and began a [[private firm]] called Bowers, Dixon, Dunn and McDowell in Birmingham. He was a [[lobbyist]] for [[conservative]] causes in the state [[legislature]]. He spent much of his time lobbying against the [[right-to-work law]]. In 1948, former governor Dixon was temporary [[chairman]] and [[keynote speaker]] at the Birmingham convention of the [[Dixiecrats|States’ Rights Democratic Party]] that nominated [[Strom Thurmond]] and [[Fielding Wright]] as their presidential ticket.

Dixon died in Birmingham on October 11, 1965.

The short's working title was ''The Early Bird gets Porky''.

==Summary==
The title screen changes seamlessly into a sign reading: "[[Get Rich Quick]]", followed by "For Sale/This lovely lot containing lots and lots/Oh!--Just oodles of [[crude oil|OIL]]!" An oil tanker pulls into the lot, and the lot's owner, con artist John Gusher, hooks the tanker to a [[irrigation sprinkler|sprinkler]] system to make it appear as if the land is saturated with natural [[crude oil]], in hopes of luring some suckers to buy the otherwise worthless land. Out of the corner of his eye, he spies Porky Pig and Gabby Goat ascending the steps of the First National Bank, where Porky means to deposit the [[money]] contained in a sack that he is holding; Gabby eagerly tries to convince Porky not to deposit his money (this in a time when [[Great Depression|bank failures were still fresh in recent memory]]) and spend his savings on pleasure, like a yacht "or a chocolate soda or something;" Porky insists on getting his 2% [[interest]]. Mr. Gusher jumps in front of the two, barely introduces himself by way of a hastily drawn and withdrawn [[business card]], and points out the plot just across the street. With Gabby egging him on, Porky signs the wayward oilman's deed and turns over his sack in exchange for the field.

The two friends, having gathered some tools in the meanwhile, begin their excavation. Gabby, by means of a pickaxe, unearths a ''can'' of oil. A dog wanders onto the property and attempts to bury a bone, only to have it spat back at him by a small gusher; the dog has some further difficulties restraining the spouts of crude. Gabby rides a [[jackhammer]] as "[[The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down]]" plays, and, as he can not control the device, drills into the earth and out again, and in again, not to be seen again for several moments. We return to the dog, who is confronted by a gopher, who performs a [[magic trick]]: he flattens the soup bone with his hands, then causes it to appear out of the dog's left ear, to the canine's delight. The gopher then buries the bone for the dog to personally exhume: but the dog only gets a face full of oil, while the gopher magically removes the bone from his "volunteer"'s mouth and absconds with it to his subterranean lair, leaving the poor dog to howl in frustration! 

Returning to Porky, he hits a small squirt of oil that disappears quickly; when he hits the same spot again with his [[pickaxe]], he discovers a piece of the sprinkler system and realizes he's been conned. An angry Porky confronts Gusher and demands his money back, but Gusher (feigning sincerity) offers only one dollar in return for the deed. Porky, reluctantly, begins to hand over the deed. By this point Gabby, still astride his jackhammer, is far beneath the earth. Just as Porky is about to accept Mr. Gusher's offer, Gabby hits a large vein of oil, which liquid then bursts through the surface and carries all of the major characters high into the air just before Gusher can get his hands on the deed. Porky realizes his new wealth and latches onto the deed, with Gusher also getting his hands on it and causing a [[tug of war]] battle. Gabby unintentionally strikes Gusher with the jackhammer, leading the crook to shout in pain and let go of the deed. Gabby and Porky fall to the ground, with Porky proudly holding the deed in his hand—only to find that instead, he has the dog's bone. A despondent Porky turns away, but his sulking is interrupted by the gopher; silently requesting the useless bone, the cheerful gopher transmutes the bone back into the deed, but only offers to return it if Gabby and Porky give the gopher a 50% share of the deed as "partners."

==Availability==
''Get Rich Quick Porky'' lapsed into the public domain in 1966. It has been widely distributed on discount media since then, usually in the form of poor-quality colorized prints.

The '''Harvey's Resort Hotel bombing''' took place on August 26–27, 1980, when three men planted an elaborately [[booby trap]]ped [[bomb]] containing {{convert|1,000|lb}} of [[dynamite]] at [[Harveys Lake Tahoe|Harvey's Resort Hotel]] (now "Harveys") in [[Stateline, Nevada]], United States. The mastermind behind the bomb, former millionaire John Birges, was attempting to [[extortion|extort]] $3 million (${{Inflation|US|3|1980|r=1|fmt=c}} million today) from the casino, claiming he had lost $750,000 (${{Inflation|US|0.75|1980|r=1|fmt=c}} million today) gambling there.

The FBI went to the spot that they believed to be the ransom drop, but due to vague directions, Birges was waiting at a different location. No money was paid to Birges.&lt;ref name=lbs/&gt;

The bomb was cleverly built and virtually tamper-proof. The ransom note said that the bomb could not be disarmed even by the bomb builder, but if paid $3 million he would give instructions on which combination of switches would allow the bomb to be moved and remotely detonated.&lt;ref name=lbs/&gt; The FBI determined that it would take four men to move it and there was no way to know if the bomb was truly disarmed or safe to move. The FBI decided that the bomb would have to be disarmed in the hotel. All guests and their belongings were evacuated from the hotel and the gas main was shut off.&lt;ref name=lbs/&gt;

After studying the bomb for more than a day through [[x-ray]]s, bomb technicians decided that, although there were warnings from the bomb maker that a shock would trigger the device, the best hope of disarming it was by separating the detonators from the dynamite. The technicians thought this could be accomplished using a [[shaped charge]] of [[C-4 (explosive)|C-4]]. The attempt to disarm the bomb failed as the technicians did not know that dynamite had also been placed in the top box containing the detonation circuit; the shaped charge detonated the top box explosives, which caused the rest of the bomb to detonate. The bomb destroyed much of the casino, although no one was injured. Harrah's Casino (which was connected to Harvey's Resort via a tunnel) was also damaged by the explosion, which broke many of the casino's windows.&lt;ref name="rj"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2005/Aug-27-Sat-2005/news/27105542.html |title=Casino explosion nearly forgotten |last=Vogel |first=Ed |date=August 27, 2005 |newspaper=[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]] |accessdate=August 25, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028034758/http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2005/Aug-27-Sat-2005/news/27105542.html |deadurl=yes |archivedate=October 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hackaday.com/2015/09/21/this-is-what-a-real-bomb-looks-like/ |title=This is What A Real Bomb Looks Like |last=Fabio |first=Adam |accessdate=February 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bomb, one of the largest the FBI had ever seen, was loaded with dynamite Birges had stolen from construction sites in Fresno. According to FBI experts, the Harvey's bomb remains the most complex [[improvised explosive device]] they have examined, and a replica of "the machine", as the extortionists called it, was still used in FBI training {{as of|2009|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/news/stories/2009/august/a-byte-out-of-history-harveys-casino-bomb/harvey_082609 |title= A Byte Out of History: The Case of the Harvey’s Casino Bomb FBI |date= August 26, 2009 |publisher= U.S. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== John Birges ==
John Birges, Sr., was a Hungarian immigrant from [[Clovis, California]]. He flew for the German [[Luftwaffe]] during [[World War II]]. He was captured and sentenced to 25 years of hard labor in a Soviet [[gulag]]. Eight years into his sentence in the gulag, he was released during a period of mass repatriation of Soviet Union POWs to their home countries, and returned to Hungary. From there, he emigrated to the U.S. and built a successful landscaping business, but his addiction to gambling led to his losing a large amount of money and prompted the bomb plot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Federal Grand Jury Indicts 6 in Bombing of Casino at Tahoe|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/19/us/federal-grand-jury-indicts-6-in-bombing-of-casino-at-tahoe.html|work=The New York Times|agency=Associated Press|date=19 August 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; His gambling debt and experience with explosives were primary pieces of evidence linking him to the bombing.&lt;ref name="EspositoGerstein2007"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Esposito |first1=Richard |last2=Gerstein |first2=Ted |title=Bomb Squad: a year inside the nation's most exclusive police unit |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uVywJ6vSMzgC&amp;pg=PA178 |accessdate=August 25, 2011 |date=March 6, 2007 |publisher=Hyperion |isbn=978-1-4013-0152-1 |page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birges was investigated as a possible suspect due to his white van being identified as being in South Tahoe at the time of the bombing.&lt;ref name=lbs&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Higginbotham |first=Adam |title=A Thousand Pounds of Dynamite |magazine=The Atavist Magazine |accessdate=May 26, 2015 |date=2014 |url=https://read.atavist.com/a-thousand-pounds-of-dynamite}}&lt;/ref&gt; Birges was eventually arrested based on a tip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=King|first1=Wayne|title=F.B.I.

After the two broke up, she was on a date with another man when they heard about a reward for information, and she informed her new boyfriend about Birges. This man then called the [[FBI]].&lt;ref name="rj"/&gt; Birges was convicted and sentenced to life in prison without parole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Conviction in Casino Bombing|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/23/us/conviction-in-casino-bombing.html|work=The New York Times|date=23 October 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, at the age of 74, he died of [[hepatocellular carcinoma|liver cancer]] at the [[Southern Nevada Correctional Center]], sixteen years and a day after the bombing.

==History==
===Iranian Revolution===
{{Further|Iran–Saudi Arabia relations}}
The proxy conflict can be traced back to the [[Iranian Revolution]] in 1979, when the monarchic [[Pahlavi dynasty|Imperial State of Iran]] became an [[Islamic republic]]. The revolutionaries called for the overthrow of monarchies and secular governments to be replaced with Islamic republics, much to the alarm of Iran's smaller Sunni-run Arab neighbors Saudi Arabia, [[Ba'athist Iraq]], [[Kuwait]], and the other [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Persian Gulf states]], most of whom were monarchies and all of whom had sizable [[Shia]] populations. Islamist insurgents rose in [[Grand Mosque seizure|Saudi Arabia]] in 1979, [[Anwar Al Sadat#Assassination|Egypt]] and [[1981 Bahraini coup d'état attempt|Bahrain]] in 1981, [[Islamist uprising in Syria|Syria]] in 1982, and [[1983 United States embassy bombing|Lebanon]] in 1983.

Prior to the Iranian Revolution, the two countries constituted the [[Nixon Doctrine]]'s "twin pillar" policy in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Miglietta |first1=John P. |title=American Alliance Policy in the Middle East, 1945-1992: Iran, Israel, and Saudi Arabia |date=2002 |publisher=Lexington Books |isbn=0739103040 |page=56 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DyWK9rIImB4C&amp;pg=PA56&amp;lpg=PA56#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monarchies, particularly Iran, were allied with the US to ensure stability in the [[Persian Gulf|Gulf region]] and act as a bulwark against Soviet influence during the [[Arab Cold War]] between Saudi Arabia and [[Egypt]] under [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]. The alliance acted as a moderating influence on Saudi-Iranian relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ramazani|first1=R.K.|title=Security in the Persian Gulf|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/yemen/1979-03-01/security-persian-gulf|accessdate=11 July 2016|work=Foreign Affairs|publisher=[[Council on Foreign Relations]]|issue=Spring 1979|date=1 March 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period Saudi Arabia styled itself as the leader of the [[Muslim world]], basing its legitimacy in part on its control of the holy cities of [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]]. In 1962 it sponsored the inaugural General Islamic Conference in [[Mecca]], at which a resolution was passed to create the [[Muslim World League]]. The organization is dedicated to spreading Islam and fostering Islamic solidarity under the Saudi purview, and has been successful in promoting Islam, particularly the conservative [[Wahhabism|Wahhabi]] doctrine advocated by the Saudi government.&lt;ref name=gold-76&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gold|first1=Dore|authorlink=Dore Gold|title=Hatred's Kingdom|date=2003|publisher=Regnery|location=Washington, DC|isbn=9780895260611|pages=75–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi Arabia also spearheaded the creation of the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] in 1969.

Saudi Arabia's image as the leader of the Muslim world was undermined in 1979 with the rise of Iran's new theocratic government under [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Ayatollah Khomeini]], who challenged the legitimacy of the [[House of Saud|Al Saud]] dynasty and its authority as [[Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sunni-Shia Divide|url=https://www.cfr.org/peace-conflict-and-human-rights/sunni-shia-divide/p33176#!/|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|accessdate=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Amiri|first=Reza Ekhtiari |author2=Ku Hasnita Binti Ku Samsu |author3=Hassan Gholipour Fereidouni|title=The Hajj and Iran's Foreign Policy towards Saudi Arabia|journal=Journal of Asian and African Studies|year=2011|volume=46|issue=678|url=http://jas.sagepub.com/content/46/6/678|accessdate=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Khalid of Saudi Arabia|King Khalid]] initially congratulated Iran and stated that "Islamic solidarity" could be the basis of closer relations between the two countries, but relations worsened substantially over the next decade. In response to the [[1987 Mecca incident]] in which Shia pilgrims clashed with Saudi security forces during the [[Hajj]], Khomeini stated: "These vile and ungodly Wahhabis, are like daggers which have always pierced the heart of the Muslims from the back...Mecca is in the hands of a band of heretics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gaub|first1=Florence|title=War of words: Saudi Arabia v Iran|url=https://www.iss.europa.eu/sites/default/files/EUISSFiles/Brief_2_Saudi_Arabia___Iran_01.pdf|accessdate=20 October 2017|publisher=European Union Institute for Security Studies (EUISS)|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iran also called for the ouster of the Saudi government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wallace|first1=Charles P.|title=Iran Asks Overthrow of Saudi Rulers Over Riots: Tehran Stand on Mecca Clash Adds to Tensions; Police Accused of Following U.S. Instructions|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-08-03/news/mn-543_1_saudi-arabia|accessdate=19 July 2017|work=Los Angeles Times|date=3 August 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iran–Iraq War===
In 1980, [[Saddam Hussein]] attempted to take advantage of revolutionary unrest in Iran and quell the revolution in its infancy. Fearing a possible [[revolutionary wave]] that could threaten Iraq's stability and embolden its Shia population, Saddam [[Iraqi invasion of Iran (1980)|launched an invasion]] on 20 September, triggering the [[Iran–Iraq War]] which lasted for eight years and killed hundreds of thousands. Saddam had reportedly secured Saudi support for Iraq's war effort during an August 1980 visit he made to Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gibson|first=Bryan R.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IPv7XdBmPDcC&amp;pg=PA33|title=Covert Relationship: American Foreign Policy, Intelligence, and the Iran-Iraq War, 1980-1988|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|year=2010|isbn=9780313386107|pp=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was in addition to [[International aid to combatants in the Iran–Iraq War|financial and military support]] Iraq received from neighboring leaders in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Kuwait, [[Jordan]], [[Qatar]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]], in part to hedge Iranian power and prevent the spread of its revolution.

American support for Iraq during the war had profound effects on Iran. The United States' defense of Saddam and its role in blocking investigations into [[Iraqi chemical attacks against Iran|Iraq's use of chemical weapons]] on Iranian soldiers and civilians convinced Iran to further pursue its own [[Iran and weapons of mass destruction|unconventional weapons program]]. The government has also used American hostility to justify foreign and domestic policies, including its nuclear program and crackdowns on internal dissent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kinzer|first=Stephen|authorlink=Stephen Kinzer|title=Inside Iran's Fury|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/inside-irans-fury-11823881/|accessdate=7 November 2017|work=Smithsonian Magazine|date=October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the Iran–Iraq War, Iran and Saudi Arabia engaged in tense competition elsewhere, supporting opposing armed groups in the [[Lebanese Civil War]], the [[Soviet–Afghan War]], and other conflicts. After the [[Cold War]], Iran and Saudi Arabia continued to support different groups and organizations along sectarian lines such as in [[Afghan Civil War (1996–2001)|Afghanistan]], [[Yemeni Civil War (1994)|Yemen]], and Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/iran/state-sponsors-iran/p9362|title=State Sponsors: Iran|first=Greg|last=Bruno|date=13 October 2011|accessdate=17 June 2017|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-yousaf-butt-/saudi-wahhabism-islam-terrorism_b_6501916.html|title=How Saudi Wahhabism Is the Fountainhead of Islamist Terrorism|first=Yousaf|last=Butt|date=21 January 2015|agency=The Huffington Post|accessdate=17 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/prince-mohammed-bin-salman-naive-arrogant-saudi-prince-is-playing-with-fire-a6804481.html|title=Prince Mohammed bin Salman: Naive, arrogant Saudi prince is playing with fire|first=Patrick|last=Cockburn|date=11 January 2016|work=The Independent|accessdate=17 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arab Spring and Arab Winter===
[[File:Persian Gulf Arab States english.PNG|thumbnail|left|230px|Member states of the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]]]]
The current phase of the conflict began in 2011 when the [[Arab Spring]] sparked a revolutionary wave across the Middle East and North Africa, leading to revolutions in [[Tunisian Revolution|Tunisia]], [[Egyptian revolution of 2011|Egypt]], and [[Yemeni Revolution|Yemen]], and the outbreak of civil war in [[Libyan Civil War (2011)|Libya]] and [[Syrian Civil War|Syria]]. In response, Saudi Arabia called for the formation of a Gulf Union to deepen ties among the member states of the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]] (GCC), a political and economic bloc founded in 1981. The proposal reflected the Saudi government's preoccupation with preventing potential uprisings by disenfranchised minorities in the Gulf monarchies as well as its regional rivalry with Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fahim|first1=Kareem|last2=Kirkpatrick|first2=David D.|title=Saudi Arabia Seeks Union of Monarchies in Region|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/15/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-seeks-union-of-monarchies-in-region.html|accessdate=15 July 2016|work=The New York Times|date=14 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The union would have centralized Saudi influence in the region by giving it greater control over military, economic, and political matters affecting member states. With the exception of [[Bahrain]], members rejected the proposed federation, as [[Oman]], Qatar, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates were wary that it would lead to Saudi dominance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hammond|first1=Andrew|title=Analysis: Saudi Gulf union plan stumbles as wary leaders seek detail|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gulf-union-idUSBRE84G0WN20120517|accessdate=12 July 2016|agency=Reuters|date=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the decreasing importance of the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] as a wedge issue and mutual tensions with Iran, GCC states have sought strengthened economic and security cooperation with [[Israel]], who is involved in [[Iran–Israel proxy conflict|its own proxy conflict]] with Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ramani|first1=Samuel|title=Israel Is Strengthening Its Ties With The Gulf Monarchies|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/samuel-ramani/why-israel-is-strengthening_b_11946660.html|accessdate=14 September 2016|agency=The Huffington Post|date=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi Arabia has also become increasingly concerned about the United States' commitment as an ally and security guarantor. The American foreign policy pivot to Asia, its lessening reliance on Saudi oil, and the potential of [[rapprochement]] with Iran have all contributed to a more assertive Saudi foreign policy.&lt;ref name="Poole 2016"/&gt; In 2015 Saudi Arabia formed the intergovernmental [[Islamic Military Alliance|Islamic Military Alliance to Fight Terrorism]] (IMAFT) in December 2015 with the stated goal of combating terrorism. The coalition currently comprises 41 member states, all of which are led by Sunni-dominated governments.

The onset of the [[Arab Winter]] exacerbated Saudi concerns about Iran as well as its own internal stability. This prompted [[Riyadh]] to take greater action to maintain the status quo, particularly within Bahrain and other bordering states, with a new foreign policy described as a "21st century version of the [[Brezhnev Doctrine]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Riedel|first=Bruce|authorlink=Bruce Riedel|title=Brezhnev in the Hejaz|url=http://nationalinterest.org/article/brezhnev-the-hejaz-5733|accessdate=7 October 2016|work=The National Interest|issue=September–October 2011|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Byman|first1=Daniel|title=After the hope of the Arab Spring, the chill of an Arab Winter|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/after-the-hope-of-the-arab-spring-the-chill-of-an-arab-winter/2011/11/28/gIQABGqHIO_story.html|accessdate=7 October 2016|work=The Washington Post|date=1 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iran took the opposite approach in hopes of taking advantage of regional instability by expanding its presence in the [[Shia crescent]] and creating a land corridor of influence stretching from Iraq to Lebanon, done in part by supporting Shia militias in the [[Iranian intervention in Iraq (2014–present)|war against ISIL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ross|first=Dennis|authorlink=Dennis Ross|title=Trump Is on a Collision Course With Iran|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/06/20/trump-foreign-policy-syria-middle-east-iran-215285|accessdate=21 June 2017|work=Politico Magazine|publisher=[[Politico]]|date=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bazzi|first=Mohamad|authorlink=Mohamad Bazzi|title=The Growing U.S.-Iran Proxy Fight in Syria|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/06/iran-syria-trump-saudi-arabia-escalation-isis/530844/|accessdate=21 June 2017|work=[[The Atlantic]]|date=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While they all share concern over Iran, the Sunni Arab governments both within and outside of the GCC have long disagreed on political Islam. Saudi Arabia's [[Wahhabism|Wahhabi]] religious establishment and its top-down bureaucracy differ from some of its allies such as Qatar, which promotes populist Sunni Islamist platforms similar to that of [[President of Turkey|President]] [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] in [[Turkey]]. Qatar has also drawn criticism from neighboring Sunni countries for its support of controversial transnational organizations like the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], which as of 2015 is considered a terrorist organization by the governments of [[Bahrain]], Egypt, Russia, Syria, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.&lt;ref&gt;See:

On 2 January 2016, 47 people were put to death in several Saudi cities, including prominent Shiite cleric [[Nimr al-Nimr]].

In recent years, [[Salman of Saudi Arabia|King Salman]] made significant changes in domestic policy to address growing unemployment and economic uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bennett-Jones|first1=Owen|title=Saudi king faces changing landscape|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-32547700|accessdate=21 September 2016|agency=BBC News|date=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such economic pressures further affected the regional dynamic in 2016. Russia, who has long maintained ties with Iran, has also sought closer ties to Saudi Arabia. In September 2016, the two nations conducted informal talks about cooperating on oil production. Both have been heavily affected by the collapse of oil prices and considered the possibility of an [[OPEC]] freeze on oil output. As part of the talks, Russian [[President of Russia|President]] [[Vladimir Putin]] recommended an exemption for Iran, whose oil output has steadily increased following the lifting of [[Sanctions against Iran|international sanctions]] in January 2016. He stated that Iran deserves the opportunity to reach its pre-sanction levels of output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stuster|first1=J.

Extremist movements throughout the Middle East have also become a major division between Iran and Saudi Arabia. During the Cold War, Saudi Arabia funded extremist militants in part to bolster resistance to the Soviet Union at the behest of the United States, and later to combat Shia movements supported by Iran. The support had the unintended effect of metastasizing extremism throughout the region. The Saudi government now considers extremist groups like [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]] and the [[Al-Nusra Front]] to be one of the two major threats to the kingdom and its monarchy, the other being Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Khalilzad|first1=Zalmay|title=‘We Misled You’: How the Saudis Are Coming Clean on Funding Terrorism|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/09/saudi-arabia-terrorism-funding-214241|accessdate=14 September 2016|work=Politico Magazine|agency=Politico|date=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a ''New York Times'' op-ed, Iranian [[List of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Iran|Foreign Minister]] [[Mohammad Javad Zarif]] agreed that terrorism was an international threat and called on the [[United Nations]] to block funding of extremist ideologies using Iran's [[World Against Violence and Extremism|WAVE]] initiative as a framework. However, he placed the blame on Saudi Arabia and its sponsorship of [[Wahhabism]] for instability in the Middle East. He argued that Wahhabism was the fundamental ideology shared among terrorist groups in the Middle East, and that it has been "devastating in its impact". He went so far as to proclaim "Let us rid the world of Wahhabism" and asserted that, despite arguments otherwise, Wahhabism was the true cause of the Iran–Saudi Arabia rivalry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zarif|first1=Mohammad Javad|title=Mohammad Javad Zarif: Let Us Rid the World of Wahhabism|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/14/opinion/mohammad-javad-zarif-let-us-rid-the-world-of-wahhabism.html|accessdate=14 September 2016|work=The New York Times|date=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States presidential election, 2016|election]] of [[Donald Trump]] in the United States in 2016 prompted uncertainty from both countries about future US policy in the Middle East, as both were targets of criticism during his campaign. The Saudi government anticipated that the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration]] would adopt a more hawkish stance than the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]] on Iran, which would potentially benefit Riyadh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Connor|first1=Tom|title=Saudi Arabia vs. Iran: How Will Donald Trump Influence The Middle East Cold War?|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/saudi-arabia-vs-iran-how-will-donald-trump-influence-middle-east-cold-war-2449937|accessdate=16 December 2016|work=International Business Times|date=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iran feared the return of economic isolation, and President Hassan Rouhani made efforts to establish further international economic participation for the country by signing oil deals with Western companies before Trump took office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Erdbrink|first1=Thomas|last2=Krauss|first2=Clifford|title=Iran Races to Clinch Oil Deals Before Donald Trump Takes Office|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/08/world/middleeast/iran-oil-sanctions-trump.html|accessdate=16 December 2016|work=The New York Times|date=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2017====
In May 2017, Trump declared a shift in US foreign policy toward favoring Saudi Arabia at Iran's expense, marking a departure from President Obama's more reconciliatory approach. This move came days after the [[Iranian presidential election, 2017|re-election]] of Rouhani in Iran, who defeated conservative candidate [[Ebrahim Raisi]]. Rouhani's victory was seen as a popular mandate for liberal reforms in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hubbard|first1=Ben|last2=Erdbrink|first2=Thomas|title=In Saudi Arabia, Trump Reaches Out to Sunni Nations, at Iran's Expense|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/21/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-iran-donald-trump.html|accessdate=22 May 2017|work=The New York Times|date=21 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Russia====

Russia has been aligned with Iran and Syria for years.

====China====

In a conversation with King Salman in March 2018, Chinese [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]] [[Xi Jinping]] expressed interest in increased strategic cooperation with Saudi Arabia.

==Involvement in regional conflicts==
====Syrian Civil War====
{{main|Saudi Arabian involvement in the Syrian Civil War|Iranian involvement in the Syrian Civil War}}

[[Syria]] has been a major theater in the proxy conflict throughout its ongoing [[Syrian Civil War|civil war]], which began in 2011. Iran and the GCC states have provided varying degrees of military and financial support to opposing sides, with Iran backing the government and Saudi Arabia supporting rebel militants.
[[File:Defence ministers of the three allied powers in the Syrian Civil War.jpg|thumbnail|left|200px|The defense ministers of Russia, Iran, and Syria in [[Tehran]] on 10 June 2016]]
Syria is an important part of Iran's sphere of influence, and the [[Council of Ministers (Syria)|government]] under [[Bashar al-Assad]] has long been a major ally. During the early stages of the Arab Spring, [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Supreme Leader]] [[Ali Khamenei|Khamenei]] initially expressed support for the revolutions in [[Tunisian Revolution|Tunisia]] and [[Egyptian revolution of 2011|Egypt]], characterizing them as an "Islamic awakening" akin to its own revolution in 1979. When [[Civil uprising phase of the Syrian Civil War|protests]] broke out in Syria, Iran changed its position and condemned them, comparing the uprising to its own [[2009 Iranian presidential election protests|presidential election protests]] in 2009 and accusing the United States and Israel of being behind the unrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Khalaji|first1=Mehdi|title=Iran's Policy Confusion about Bahrain|url=http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/irans-policy-confusion-about-bahrain|accessdate=7 October 2016|publisher=[[The Washington Institute for Near East Policy]]|date=27 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The war threatens Iran's position, and Saudi Arabia and its allies have sided with Sunni rebels in part to weaken Iran. For years Iranian forces have been involved on the ground, with soldiers in Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps facing heavy casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Henry|title=Mapping the Deaths of Iranian Officers Across Syria|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-syria-crisis-iran-idUSBREA1K09U20140221|accessdate=6 October 2016|work=Foreign Policy|date=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, with no end in sight to the conflict, Iran increased its ground support for the [[Syrian Army]], providing elite forces, intelligence gathering, and training.

Saudi Arabia countered Russia's intervention in Syria by increasing its support for the rebels and supplying American-made anti-tank [[BGM-71 TOW|TOW missiles]], a move which slowed initial progress made by Russian and Syrian forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bassam|first1=Laila|last2=Perry|first2=Tom|title=Saudi support to rebels slows Assad attacks: pro-Damascus sources|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-idUSKCN0SV23O20151106|accessdate=6 October 2016|agency=Reuters|date=6 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, a Saudi-led coalition of Arab states, including all GCC members except [[Oman]], [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen|intervened]] and launched airstrikes and a ground offensive in the country, declaring the entire [[Saada Governorate]] a military target and imposing a naval blockade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Miles|first1=Tom|title=Saudi-led strikes in Yemen break international law: U.N. coordinator|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-saudi-un-idUSKBN0NU0PN20150509|accessdate=20 September 2016|agency=Reuters|date=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States intervened in October 2016 after missiles were fired at a US warship, which was in place to protect oil shipments along the sea lane passing through the [[Bab-el-Mandeb|Mandeb Strait]].

====Iraqi Civil War====
{{main|Iranian intervention in Iraq (2014–present)}}

While the majority of Muslims in Iraq are Shia, the country has been ruled for decades by Sunni-dominated governments under the [[Ottoman Empire]], the British-installed [[Kingdom of Iraq|Hashemites]], and the [[Ba'athist Iraq|Ba'athists]]. Under the rule of Saddam Hussein, Iraq was hostile to both Iran and Saudi Arabia and acted as a counterbalancing regional power. The [[2003 invasion of Iraq|American-led invasion]] in 2003 caused a power vacuum in the region. With the antagonistic Ba'athist regime removed, Iran sought a more friendly Shia-dominated government and supported sympathetic rebel factions as part of an effort to undermine the coalition, which Iran feared would install a government hostile to its interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fisher|first1=Max|title=How the Iranian-Saudi Proxy Struggle Tore Apart the Middle East|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/20/world/middleeast/iran-saudi-proxy-war.html|accessdate=2 November 2017|work=The New York Times|date=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saudi Arabia remained more passive during the occupation of Iraq, taking caution to preserve its relations with the United States by avoiding any direct support of Sunni insurgent groups. Riyadh supported the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]]'s commitment to stay in the country, as it limited Iran's influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gause III|first1=F.

Following the United States [[Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq|withdrawal from Iraq]] in December 2011, the country drifted further into Iran's sphere of influence. The instability that resulted from the [[Iraqi Civil War (2014–2017)|Iraqi Civil War]] and the rise of ISIL threatened the existence of the Iraqi regime and led to an [[Iranian intervention in Iraq (2014–present)|Iranian intervention]] in 2014.

====Bahraini uprising====
{{main|Saudi-led intervention in Bahrain}}
[[File:March of 9 march 7.JPG|thumb|[[Aftermath of the Bahraini uprising (January–August 2012)|Bahraini anti-government protests]] in 2012]]
Saudi Arabia and Iran have sought to extend their influence in Bahrain for decades. While the majority of Muslims in Bahrain are Shia, the country is ruled by the Sunni [[House of Khalifa|Al Khalifa]] family. Iran claimed sovereignty over Bahrain until 1970, when Shah [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] abandoned claims after negotiations with the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=rhm&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alvandi|first=Roham|title=Muhammad Reza Pahlavi and the Bahrain Question, 1968–1970|journal=British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies|year=2010|volume=32|issue=2|pages=159–177|doi=10.1080/13530191003794723}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Iranian Revolution led to resumed interest in Bahraini affairs. In 1981, the front organization [[Islamic Front for the Liberation of Bahrain]] led a [[1981 Bahraini coup d'état attempt|failed coup attempt]] to install a Shia theocratic regime led by [[Hadi al-Modarresi]].

Sunni states have long feared that Iran might stir up unrest among regional Shia minority populations, especially in Bahrain. The Al Khalifa regime's stability depends heavily on Saudi support. The island is connected to Saudi Arabia by the 25 kilometer [[King Fahd Causeway]], and its proximity to Saudi Arabia's oil-rich, majority Shia [[Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia|Eastern Province]] is viewed by Riyadh as a security concern. Any political gains by the Shia in Bahrain are seen by the Saudis as gains for Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mabon|first1=Simon|title=After years of proxy war, Saudi Arabia and Iran are finally squaring up in the open|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/after-years-of-proxy-war-saudi-arabia-and-iran-are-finally-squaring-up-in-the-open-a6797001.html|accessdate=13 July 2016|work=The Independent|date=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the Arab Spring in 2011, the GCC regimes sought to maintain their legitimacy through social reform, economic handouts, and violent repression.

The Bahraini government publicly blamed Iran for the protests, but an [[Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry|independent commission]] established by [[Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa|King Hamad]] rejected the claim, instead highlighting human rights abuses committed in the crackdown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bahrain protesters join anti-government march in Manama|date=9 March 2012|publisher=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-17309839|accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PenForce_NYT14March" /&gt; The protests, along with the Iran nuclear deal, strained Bahrain's relationship with the United States.

Following the onset of the [[Arab Winter]], Bahrain accused Iran of orchestrating several domestic incidents as part of a campaign to destabilize the country.

Saudi Arabia also referred to the incident as an "attack on the pipeline".&lt;ref name="DW November 2017"/&gt;

====Lebanese arena====
{{See also|2017 Lebanon–Saudi Arabia dispute}}
In 2008, Saudi Arabia proposed creating an Arab force backed by US and NATO air and sea power to intervene in Lebanon and destroy Iranian-backed Hezbollah, according to a US diplomatic cable released by [[WikiLeaks]]. According to the cable Saudi argued that a Hezbollah victory against the [[Fouad Siniora|Siniora]] government "combined with Iranian actions in Iraq and on the Palestinian front would be a disaster for the US and the entire region".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=MacAskill|first1=Ewen|title=WikiLeaks cables: Saudis proposed Arab force to invade Lebanon|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/07/wikileaks-saudi-arab-invasion-lebanon|accessdate=21 June 2017|work=The Guardian|date=7 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lebanon: SAG FM says UN peace keeping force needed now|url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/08RIYADH768_a.html|publisher=WikiLeaks|accessdate=21 June 2017|date=14 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016 Saudi Arabia and the UAE banned their citizens from visiting [[Lebanon]] and suspended [[military aid]] due to possible [[Hezbollah|Iranian influence]] and Lebanon's refusal to condemn the [[2016 attack on the Saudi diplomatic missions in Iran|attack on Saudi embassy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/saudi-arabia-and-uae-tell-citizens-not-go-lebanon-1263867364|title=Saudi Arabia and UAE tell citizens to avoid Lebanon|publisher=Middle East Eye|date=23 February 2016|accessdate=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Saudi and UAE ban citizens from travelling to Lebanon|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/02/saudi-uae-ban-citizens-travelling-lebanon-160223154000581.html|accessdate=19 July 2017|agency=Al Jazeera|date=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lebanese [[List of Prime Ministers of Lebanon|Prime Minister]] [[Saad Hariri]] resigned on 4 November 2017. The situation was seen as a power play by Saudi Arabia to increase its influence in Lebanon and counterbalance Iran's victories in Iraq and Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Perry|first1=Tom|last2=Bassam|first2=Laila|title=Saudi reopens Lebanon front in struggle with Iran|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lebanon-politics-hariri-analysis/saudi-reopens-lebanon-front-in-struggle-with-iran-idUSKBN1D72BA|accessdate=8 November 2017|agency=Reuters|date=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Alsaafin|first1=Linah|last2=Najjar|first2=Farah|title=Is Lebanon caught in a Saudi-Iran regional power play?|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/11/lebanon-caught-saudi-iran-regional-power-play-171107075704436.html|accessdate=8 November 2017|agency=Al Jazeera|date=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a televised speech from Saudi Arabia, Hariri criticized Hezbollah and blamed Iran for causing "disorder and destruction" in Lebanon.

====War in Afghanistan====

The rivalry has contributed to the [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)|ongoing instability]] in [[Afghanistan]]. Afghanistan shares historical ties with Iran, and is strategically important to Saudi Arabia. After the Cold War, Saudi policy shifted from fighting the spread of communism to containing Iranian influence in South and Central Asia.&lt;ref name="afghanistan"/&gt;

Saudi Arabia was one of three countries to officially recognize the Sunni [[Taliban]] government in 1996, along with its allies Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates. During the [[Afghan Civil War (1996–2001)|Afghan Civil War]], Iran and Saudi Arabia supported opposing militant factions. Iran assisted the Shia [[Hizb-i-Wahdat]], while Saudi Arabia provided financial support to the Wahhabist [[Islamic Dawah Organisation of Afghanistan|Ittihad-i Islami]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=John|last=Sifton|date=6 July 2005|accessdate=11 April 2018|title=Blood-Stained Hands: Past Atrocities in Kabul and Afghanistan's Legacy of Impunity|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]|url=https://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2005/07/06/blood-stained-hands}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–2014)|invasion of Afghanistan]] and the removal of the Taliban in the wake of the [[September 11 attacks]] benefited Iran, which had previously been on the brink of war with the group. The regime change removed Iran's primary threat along its eastern borders, and the removal of Saddam Hussein two years later further bolstered its position, allowing it to refocus its efforts on other areas, especially Syria and Yemen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Quince|first1=Annabelle|title=Iran and Saudi Arabia: Divisions, proxy wars and chaos in the Middle East|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/rearvision/iran-saudi-arabia-sectarian-divisions-proxy-wars-chaos/7152358|accessdate=21 September 2016|agency=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|publisher=Radio National|date=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ensuing years, Iran sought to expand its influence over Afghanistan. It provided limited support to the Taliban as a potential means of increasing leverage with the Afghan central government and creating a deterrent to conflict with the United States, although the support waned amid growing backlash in Afghanistan against perceived Iranian interference.&lt;ref name="rand 2014"&gt;{{cite web|authors=Nader, Alireza; Scotten, Ali G.; Rahmani, Ahmad Idrees; Stewart, Robert; Mahnad, Leila|url=https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR600/RR616/RAND_RR616.pdf|title=Iran's Influence in Afghanistan: Implications for the U.S. Drawdown|publisher=RAND Corporation|isbn=978-0-8330-8592-4|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iran has also sought to expand soft influence by building pro-Iranian schools, mosques, and media centers, and by maintaining close ties with Afghanistan's [[Tajiks|Tajik]] and [[Hazaras|Hazara]] populations.&lt;ref name="rand 2014" /&gt;

====Pakistani sectarian violence====
Since 1989 [[Pakistan]] has been dealing with [[Sectarian violence in Pakistan|sectarian conflict]]. The population is predominantly Sunni and has about 10-15% of Shia adherents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=South Asia: Pakistan|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/pk.html|website=[[The World Factbook]]|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pakistan is economically dependent on Saudi Arabia and a key strategic ally. The country's economic stability relies heavily on foreign workers who send money home. The largest amount comes from the 1.5 million Pakistanis working in Saudi Arabia who sent home about $5.5 billion USD in remittances in 2017.&lt;ref name="WSJ 22-02-2018"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shah|first1=Saeed|last2=Talley|first2=Ian|title=Saudi Arabia Stymies U.S. Over Pakistan Terror List|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/pakistan-avoids-inclusion-on-international-terror-financing-watch-list-1519257040|accessdate=22 February 2018|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi Arabia has invested in the country's nuclear weapons projects, and believes it could use Pakistan to quickly obtain nuclear weapons at will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Urban|first1=Mark|title=Saudi nuclear weapons 'on order' from Pakistan|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-24823846|accessdate=15 November 2017|agency=BBC News|date=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Riyadh also sees the province of [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]] as a potential means of stirring ethnic unrest in neighboring Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dorsey|first1=James|title=The Middle East Will Only Get Worse|url=https://www.fairobserver.com/region/middle_east_north_africa/saad-hariri-saudi-arabia-iran-hezbollah-israel-war-world-news-43400/|accessdate=15 November 2017|agency=Fair Observer|date=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Pakistan declared its neutrality in the conflict in Yemen after Saudi solicitations for military support. It ultimately provided some degree of covert support, joining [[Somalia]] in sending proxy forces to aid the Saudi-led campaign against Houthi rebels.&lt;ref name="FP 11-01-2016" /&gt; In 2016, Saudi Arabia sought closer ties with Pakistan as part of its "look east" policy of expanding its reach to East and South Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shams|first1=Shamil|title=Examining Saudi-Pakistani ties in changing geopolitics|url=http://www.dw.com/en/examining-saudi-pakistani-ties-in-changing-geopolitics/a-19512946|accessdate=5 October 2016|publisher=Deutsche Welle|date=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, Saudi Arabia, acting on behalf of the GCC, joined China and Turkey in opposing a US-led initiative to place Pakistan on an international terror-financing watch list through the [[Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering|Financial Action Task Force]]. This move came days after Pakistan pledged to send 1,000 troops to the Gulf kingdoms for what it described as an advisory mission.&lt;ref name="WSJ 22-02-2018" /&gt;

Iran has been accused of influencing young Pakistani Shias to act as proxies to further Iranian interests in Pakistan. The Iranian government has been suspected of militarizing Shia loyalists amongst Pakistan's local population and promoting sectarian sentiments to further achieve its goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pakistan.asia-news.com/en_GB/articles/cnmi_pf/features/2018/02/16/feature-01|title=Iran manipulates Pakistani Shia to satisfy 'nefarious' geopolitical agenda|first=Pakistan|last=Forward|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Pakistani Shias have also been suspected of traveling to parts of the Middle East including Syria and Lebanon to fight on behalf of the Iranian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pakistan.asia-news.com/en_GB/articles/cnmi_pf/features/2017/09/26/feature-01|title=Pakistani pilgrims are being recruited into Iran's mercenary groups|first=Pakistan|last=Forward|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1007694/iran-recruits-pakistani-shias-for-combat-in-syria/|title=Iran recruits Pakistani Shias for combat in Syria - The Express Tribune|date=11 December 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dhakatribune.com/tribune-supplements/world-tribune/2017/09/17/iran-recruits-afghan-pakistani-shias-fight-syria/|title=Iran recruits Afghan and Pakistani Shias to fight in Syria - Dhaka Tribune|website=www.dhakatribune.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nuclear programs of Iran and Saudi Arabia==
{{main|Nuclear program of Saudi Arabia|Iran and weapons of mass destruction}}
Although both Iran and Saudi Arabia signed the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons]] in 1970 and 1988 respectively, a potential nuclear arms race has been a concern for years. Both governments claim that their programs are for peaceful purposes, but foreign governments and organizations have accused both of taking steps to obtain nuclear weapons capabilities.

Iran's ongoing [[Nuclear program of Iran|nuclear program]] began in the 1950s under the Shah in cooperation with the United States as part of the [[Atoms for Peace]] program. The cooperation continued until the Iranian Revolution in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-061209atoms-day1-story,0,2034260.htmlstory|title=An atomic threat made in America|last=Roe|first=Sam|date=28 January 2007|work=Chicago Tribune |accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sanctions on Iran|Sanctions]] have been in place since then, and were expanded in 2006 with the passage of United Nation Security Council [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1737|Resolution 1737]] and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1696|Resolution 1696]] in response to Iran's uranium enrichment program.

Saudi Arabia has considered several options in response to the Iranian program: acquiring its own [[Nuclear program of Saudi Arabia|nuclear capability]] as a deterrent, entering into an alliance with an existing nuclear power, or pursuing a regional [[nuclear-weapon-free zone]] agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=MacAskill|first1=Ewen|last2=Traynor|first2=Ian|title=Saudis consider nuclear bomb|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/sep/18/nuclear.saudiarabia|accessdate=22 June 2017|work=The Guardian|date=18 September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that Saudi Arabia has been a major financier of [[Pakistan]]'s integrated [[Pakistan and weapons of mass destruction|nuclear program]] since 1974, a project begun under former [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]]. In 2003 it was reported that Saudi Arabia had taken the "strategic decision" to acquire "off-the-shelf" atomic weapons from Pakistan, according to senior American officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harnden|first1=Toby|last2=Lamb|first2=Christina|title=Saudis 'to get nuclear weapons'|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/saudis-to-get-nuclear-weapons-v85860g8bp3|work=The Times|date=17 May 2015|accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2003, ''[[The Washington Times]]'' reported that Pakistan and Saudi Arabia had entered a secret agreement on nuclear cooperation to provide the Saudis with nuclear weapons technology in return for access to cheap oil for Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/org/news/2003/031022-pakistan_saudi-arabia.htm|title=Pakistan, Saudi Arabia in secret nuke pact: Islamabad trades weapons technology for oil|last=De Borchgrave|first=Arnaud|work=The Washington Times|date=22 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following several years of negotiations for a [[Iran nuclear deal framework|nuclear deal framework]] between Iran and the [[P5+1]] countries, the [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action]] (JCPOA) was signed in 2015. The deal raised concerns for Saudi Arabia, which saw it as a step toward reducing Iran's international isolation and potentially exacerbating the proxy conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The 'Cold War' between Iran and Saudi Arabia is heating up.

[[President of the United States|President]] [[Donald Trump|Trump]] announced on 8 May 2018 that the United States would [[United States withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|unilaterally withdraw]] from the JCPOA and reinstate previous [[sanctions against Iran]] in addition to imposing new sanctions.&lt;ref name="nyt 08-05-18"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Landler|first1=Mark|title=Trump Withdraws U.S. From 'One-Sided' Iran Nuclear Deal|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/world/middleeast/trump-iran-nuclear-deal.html|accessdate=8 May 2018|work=The New York Times|date=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In anticipation of the decision, Iranian [[President of Iran|President]] [[Hassan Rouhani|Rouhani]] stated that Iran would remain in the deal if the remaining parties did the same, but was otherwise vague on how the country would respond to the US decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In Case Of US Withdrawal Iran Will Stay In Nuclear Deal, If Others Also Stay|url=https://en.radiofarda.com/a/29213598.html|accessdate=8 May 2018|agency=[[Radio Farda]]|date=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10320">'''David James Wilkie''' (9 July 1949 – 30 November 1984) was a [[Wales|Welsh]] taxi driver who was killed during the [[UK miners' strike (1984–1985)|miners' strike]] in the [[United Kingdom]], when two striking miners [[criminal rock throwing|dropped a concrete block]] from a footbridge onto his taxi whilst he was driving a strike-breaking miner to work. The attack caused a widespread revulsion at the extent of violence in the dispute. The two miners were convicted of [[murder]] but the charge was reduced to [[manslaughter]] on appeal, becoming a [[leading case]] on the issue of the difference between the two offences.

==Background==
David Wilkie was born on 9 July 1949.{{cn|date=September 2011}} He was working in [[Treforest]], [[Mid Glamorgan]] as a taxi driver, driving a [[Ford Cortina]] for City Centre Cars, based in [[Bute Street (Cardiff)|Bute Street]], Cardiff.&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;Tim Jones, "Two miners charged with murder of taxi driver", ''The Times'', 1 December 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; He was regularly engaged in driving non-striking miners to work, as the bitter industrial dispute had made them targets for physical retaliation by those miners who were on strike. The [[Merthyr Tydfil]] area was said to be the strongest in support of the strike of any mining area in Britain; it is situated in [[South Wales]], where a large percentage of Britain's remaining coalmines were situated.&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt;  There had not been much mass picketing in South Wales during the conflict, as there had been in many parts of England, because there had been so few strikebreakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Adeney |first1=Martin |last2=Lloyd |first2=John |date=1988 |title=The Miners' Strike 1984-5: Loss Without Limit |location=London |page=124 |publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|isbn=0-7102-1371-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Killing==
On 30 November 1984, Wilkie's fare was David Williams, who lived in [[Rhymney]] and worked at the [[Merthyr Vale]] mine, six miles away. Wilkie was driving the same route as he had done for the previous ten days. He was accompanied by two police cars and a motorcycle outrider, and had just turned on to the [[A465 road]] north of Rhymney at the Rhymney Bridge roundabout, when two striking miners dropped a {{convert|46|lb|adj=on}}&lt;ref name="Trial"&gt;Tim Jones, "Miner's taxi driver killed in minutes by 46 lb concrete block, QC says", ''The Times'', 8 May 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; concrete block from a bridge 27 feet over the road. Wilkie died at the scene from multiple injuries; Williams escaped with minor injuries.&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt;

==Reaction==
The incident led to a decrease in public support for the striking miners, and to an increase in the number of workers in other industries who crossed miners' picket lines (e.g. at power plants).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Adeney |first1=Martin |last2=Lloyd |first2=John |date=1988 |title=The Miners' Strike 1984-5: Loss Without Limit |location=London |pages=150–151 |publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|isbn=0-7102-1371-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] said, "My reaction is one of anger at what this had done to a family of a person only doing his duty and taking someone to work who wanted to go to work." [[Kim Howells]], speaking for the South Wales [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]], blamed the attack on the attempts to persuade miners to return to work.&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt; [[Arthur Scargill]] said he had been "deeply shocked by the tragedy" of Wilkie's death.&lt;ref name="Scargill"&gt;"Scargill shocked by 'tragic death'", ''The Times'', 1 December 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

Labour Party leader [[Neil Kinnock]] was scheduled to appear at a Labour Party rally alongside Scargill in [[Stoke-on-Trent]] on the day of the tragedy.&lt;ref name="LWL294"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Adeney |first1=Martin |last2=Lloyd |first2=John |date=1988 |title=The Miners' Strike 1984-5: Loss Without Limit |location=London |publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul |page=294 |isbn=0-7102-1371-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kinnock's speech developed into an argument with some hecklers who saw him as having betrayed the NUM by failing to support the strike.&lt;ref name="LWL294"/&gt;  Kinnock began by saying, "We meet here tonight in the shadow of an outrage."&lt;ref name="LWL294"/&gt;  When interrupted, Kinnock accused the hecklers of "living like parasites off the struggle of the miners."&lt;ref name="LWL294"/&gt;  As Kinnock went on to denounce the lack of the ballot, the violence against strikebreakers and the tactical approach of Scargill, he was asked by hecklers what he had done for the striking miners.&lt;ref name="LWL295"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Adeney |first1=Martin |last2=Lloyd |first2=John |date=1988 |title=The Miners' Strike 1984-5: Loss Without Limit |location=London |publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul |page=295 |isbn=0-7102-1371-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kinnock shouted back, "Well, I was not telling them lies.  That's what I was not doing during that period."&lt;ref name="LWL295"/&gt;  This was a thinly-veiled attack on Scargill, whom he later admitted that he detested.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2004/02_february/27/coal_war.shtml BBC Press Office – Kinnock detests Scargill – 27 February 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;
     
Wilkie lived with his fiancée Janice Reed, who was the mother of his two-year-old daughter and was pregnant with a baby who was born six weeks later. He also had a 12-year-old daughter and a five-year-old son by a previous partner.&lt;ref name="Victim"&gt;Tim Jones, "Unlikely killers in a bitter dispute", ''The Times'', 17 May 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; Funds were opened to help the family; among the donors was philanthropist [[John Paul Getty, Jr.|Paul Getty]].&lt;ref name="Getty"&gt;"Dispute in the coalfields", ''The Times'', 19 December 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Roy Davies|Bishop of Llandaff]] led Wilkie's funeral service; he called for "some sort of moratorium" and a return to work by the miners in return for an impartial board to investigate conditions in the coal industry.&lt;ref name="Bishop"&gt;Tim Jones, "Bishop's plea as driver is buried", ''The Times'', 12 December 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder trial==

The two men who caused Wilkie's death, Dean Hancock and Russell Shankland, were found guilty of murder by a majority verdict on 16 May 1985 (by which time the strike had ended) and sentenced to life imprisonment.&lt;ref name=OTDMay16&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/16/newsid_2512000/2512469.stm Miners jailed for pit strike murder], BBC News online (16 May 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Verdict"&gt;Tim Jones, "Miners get life for taxi murder", ''The Times'', 17 May 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; A third man, Anthony Williams, who had been present on the bridge but was found to have actively discouraged them from dropping the concrete block, was acquitted.&lt;ref name="Dismissed"&gt;Rupert Morris, "Welsh officials to meet over dismissed pitman", ''The Times'', 24 June 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; The life sentences caused an outcry among the striking miners, who felt that the death of Wilkie was not a deliberate act; the strike had ended by the time the verdict was brought in, but 700 miners at Merthyr Vale walked out on hearing the news. A third miner, Dean Williams, was cleared of conspiracy to cause serious injury.&lt;ref name="Wildcat strike"&gt;Tim Jones, "Miners walk out over life terms", ''The Times'', 18 May 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

Russell Shankland's solicitor was critical of Scargill's attitude. He referred to the strike as "a war" and said with regards to Scargill, "In that war there were generals, and they stood outside the law and they left Russell Shankland outside the law."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/16/newsid_2512000/2512469.stm BBC on this day, 16 May 1985, Miners jailed for pit strike murder]&lt;/ref&gt;

On appeal, their convictions were reduced to manslaughter, and their life sentences were replaced with eight-year prison terms, of which they would serve just over half. The [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]], [[Geoffrey Lane, Baron Lane|Lord Lane]], explained that the crime would be murder if the death was a "natural consequence" of the miners' actions, but the legal phrase "natural consequence" was potentially misleading without further explanation.&lt;ref name="Appeal"&gt;Frances Gibb, "Miners win murder charge appeal", ''The Times'', 1 November 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; The appeal verdict of guilty to manslaughter was upheld in the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]], in the case ''[[R v Hancock]]''.&lt;ref name="Lords"&gt;Frances Gibb, "Manslaughter verdicts are upheld on miners who killed taxi driver", ''The Times'', 13 December 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; Hancock and Shankland were released on 30 November 1989,&lt;ref name=OTDMay16/&gt; which was coincidentally the fifth anniversary of Wilkie's death.

==Aftermath==
[[Kim Howells]], the South Wales NUM official who commented on the killing of David Wilkie, later became a [[Member of Parliament]] for the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and served as a minister in the [[Blair government]] and later became chair of the [[Intelligence and Security Committee]], a committee of parliamentarians that oversees the work of Britain's intelligence and security agencies. In 2004 he said that when he heard that a taxi driver had been killed, he thought "hang on, we've got all those records we've kept over in the NUM offices, there's all those maps on the wall, we're gonna get implicated in this". He then destroyed "everything", because he feared a police raid on the union offices.&lt;ref name="Destruction"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/3435161.stm "Howells' strike papers admission – inquiry"], BBC News, 27 January 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The killing is referenced in the [[Roger Waters]] songs , "Who Needs Information" and "Me or Him", on his 1984 ''[[Radio K.A.O.S.]]'' album.

The opening narration is largely the same as that of the American series, but replaces "district attorneys" with "Crown Prosecutors".

===The police portion===
For most of ''Law &amp; Order: UK''{{'}}s run, the [[cold open]] or lead-in of the show began with the discovery of a crime, usually a murder. The scene typically began with a slice of everyday life in London, (usually the scene would be the same as the US version of the episode but with a British institution instead, e.g. A British fish and chip shop instead of an American coffee shop). Some civilians would then discover the crime victim, or sometimes the crime would occur in a public place and they would be a witnesses or a victim of a crime.

The police are represented in the show by [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police Force]] Murder Investigation Unit (referred to as M.I.U.), with two [[Criminal Investigation Department]] (CID) detectives, a senior detective sergeant (DS) and a junior detective sergeant (DS), who report directly to their boss, a detective inspector (DI) or detective chief inspector (DCI). During the preliminary crime scene examination, the featured detectives make their first observations and will come up with theories followed by a witticism or two, before the title sequence begins.

The detectives often have few or no good clues — they might not even know the victim's identity — and must usually chase several dead ends before finding a likely suspect. They investigate the crime by collecting evidence at the crime scene (with the help of [[scenes of crime officer]]s (SOCOs)), visit the [[coroner]] or [[Forensic pathology|forensic pathologist]] for clues to the victim's cause and time of death (sometimes the [[Body identification|victim's identity]] from [[Forensic dentistry|dental records]] or fingerprints). The police will also inform relatives of the victim's death, interview witnesses, trace the victim's last known movements (by talking to the victim's family and friends). as well as visiting the [[crime lab]]oratory for evidence (e.g. such as fingerprints, [[DNA profiling|DNA]] and [[Forensic ballistics|ballistics]] etc.), records and research for information on financial details and background information on both victim(s) and suspect(s). In some instances, psychologists and/or psychiatrists are called in for insight into the criminal's behaviour or ''[[modus operandi]]''. All the while, the detectives report to their commanding officer, keeping them informed and being advised on how best to proceed next.

When the investigation leads to one or more suspects, the police will take the case to their boss, who decides if there is enough for a [[Search warrant|search]] and/or [[arrest warrant|arrest]] warrants (though sometimes the commanding officer will consult with the CPS office to see if the case is strong enough) and whether or not any back-up (such as uniformed officers or armed police) is needed. The detectives will then arrest the suspects(s), with sometimes the police having to chase the accused through the streets of London. The scene then shifts to the interrogation room where the detectives interrogate the suspect(s), until they ask for a solicitor, their defence barristers show up and asks the suspect not to talk anymore or the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] decides they have enough to press charges.

===The trial portion===
Towards the middle of a show, the police will begin to work with the prosecutors to make the arrest, though sometimes the CPS team will on occasion appear early on to arrange a plea-for-information deal or to decide if the detectives have enough evidence for search warrant(s) and/or arrest warrant(s) before arresting the suspect or suspects and an arraignment scene will follow.

The matter then is taken over by a pair of crown prosecutors, a senior crown prosecutor (sometimes referred to as a Chief Crown Prosecutor) and a junior crown prosecutor (sometimes referred to as a [[Crown Advocate]]) from the office of the London [[Crown Prosecution Service]]. They discuss deals, prepare the witnesses and evidence, and conduct the Crown's case in the trial. The crown prosecutors work together and with the coroner's office, the [[Crime Lab|crime laboratory]] (including [[Fingerprint|Fingerprint analysts]], [[DNA profiling|DNA profilers]] and [[Forensic ballistics|Ballistics analysts]]), and [[psychologists]] and/or [[psychiatrists]] (if the defendant uses an insanity plea) all of whom may be needed to testify in court for the prosecution. The police may also reappear to testify in court or to arrest another suspect, but most investigation in the second segment is done by the CPS office, who always consult with the local London CPS Director for advice on the case. If the case is very weak then the police would re-investigate.

Unlike many legal dramas (e.g. ''[[Kavanagh QC]]'' and ''[[Rumpole of the Bailey]]''), the court proceedings are shown from the prosecution's point of view, with the regular characters trying to prove the defendant's guilt, not innocence. The second half usually opens with the [[arraignment]] of defendants and proceeds to trial preparation, including legal research and plea negotiations. Some episodes include legal proceedings beyond the testimony of witnesses, including motion hearings, (often concerning admissibility of evidence); jury selection; and allocutions, usually as a result of plea bargains. Many episodes employ motions to suppress evidence as a plot device, and most of these end with evidence or statements being suppressed, often on a technicality. This usually begins with the service of the motion to the CPS team, follows with argument and case citations of precedent before a judge in court, and concludes with visual reaction of the winning or losing attorney.

Many episodes use outlandish defence scenarios such as [[Diminished responsibility]] (e.g. "Genetics"/"Television"/"God"/"the devil made me do it" and [[intoxication defence]]) and [[insanity defense|Temporary insanity]] (Ie "[[Black rage (law)|Black Rage]]"/"White Rage"/"Sports Rage"). Also episodes revolve around moral and ethical debates including the [[right to die]] ([[euthanasia]]), the [[right to life]] ([[abortion]]) and [[the right to bear arms#United States|the right to bear arms]] ([[gun control]]). The episode usually ends with the verdict being read by the jury foreperson and a shot of both the winning and losing parties. The scene then shifts to the Crown Prosecution Service London office where the team is leaving the office to go home while contemplating either the true guilt of the accused, the defence scenarios they used or the moral or ethical debate of the episode.

[[File:LOUK intertitle1.svg|thumb|250px|left|One of the distinguishing features of ''Law &amp; Order'' is a black-and-white [[intertitle]] card, which gives the description of the time, date and setting of each scene. This intertitle is the first title from "[[Care (Law &amp; Order: UK)|Care]]".]]
''Law &amp; Order: UK'' was first imagined by franchise creator [[Dick Wolf]] in 2000; however, at the time, no network was willing to pick up a pilot for the series.&lt;ref name="manchestereveningnews.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/showbiz/s/1096326_law__order_uk_bradley_walsh |title=Law &amp; Order UK: Bradley Walsh |publisher=Manchester Evening News |date=2010-04-20 |accessdate=2014-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=October 2014}} Wolf managed to attract scriptwriter [[Chris Chibnall]], who had previously worked on British productions ''[[Torchwood]]'', ''[[Life on Mars (UK TV series)|Life on Mars]]'' and ''[[Born and Bred]]'', to write a series of 13 adaptions from the original ''Law &amp; Order'' series. Wolf then asked Chibnall to look through the ''Law &amp; Order Bible'', a book released in the United States containing a collection of synopses for every episode. Chibnall picked 13 episodes that could be adapted for [[Television in the United Kingdom|British television]], watched the originals on DVD, and then wrote the adaptations to accommodate contractual requirements with production company Kudos, and to build on the show's reputation of successful storytelling. Subsequently, the series was picked up by [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]. One of the episodes Chibnall adapted, however, had to be scrapped because of incompatibility with English law, resulting in a different episode being adapted.&lt;ref name="manchestereveningnews.co.uk"/&gt;{{failed verification|date=October 2014}} Wolf then attracted producer Richard Stokes to the series, but he stated that a 13-episode series would be too long for broadcast on British television, and thus, he separated the 13 scripts into two separate series. Wolf, however, objected to this, claiming that it wouldn't be an issue, as each series in the United States contains 22 episodes per series. Wolf pushed [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] for more episodes per series, but his attempt was unsuccessful. Each of the 13 scripts was updated for contemporariness, and while the difficulties of adapting the scripts for the English legal system exceeded the expectations of the production team, Stokes opined that audiences familiar with both shows would enjoy them for their distinctions. Further series have continued to adapt scripts from the original ''Law &amp; Order'' series. Many of the familiar hallmarks of the original ''Law &amp; Order'' series were carried through into the adaptation, including the styling of the opening music, [[black-and-white]] [[intertitle]]s, using Wolf's signature "clanging cell door" sound, and [[hand-held camera]] work. Stokes later expressed his praise for the Kudos' method of [[Guerrilla_filmmaking|guerrilla filming]] on the streets of London. &lt;ref name="Law and Order"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/law-and-order/1993671.article | work=Broadcast | title=Law and Order | first=Paul | last=Hoggart | date=18 Feb 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wolf later described the biggest difference between the two series as the wigs, claiming, "The law is not really that dissimilar and, you know, murder is murder."&lt;ref name="Law &amp; Order gets UK makeover"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7880999.stm | work=BBC News | title=Law &amp; Order gets UK makeover | date=23 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/4736370/Feature-Law-and-Order-heads-to-Britain.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Matt | last=Warman | title=Feature: Law and Order heads to Britain | date=23 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cast changes==
In August 2012, ITV announced that they had renewed the show for an six-episode seventh series.

==Series==

=== Series 1–4 (2009–11) ===
The first four series of ''Law &amp; Order: UK'' starred [[Bradley Walsh]], [[Jamie Bamber]] and [[Harriet Walter]], [[Ben Daniels]], [[Freema Agyeman]] and [[Bill Paterson (actor)|Bill Paterson]]. Each commission consisted of thirteen-episode seasons to be broken up in 6–7 episode series. Series one was broadcast in February 2009 and concluded in March 2009 with seven episodes being broadcast. The second series followed in January 2010 and consisted of six episodes. The series was renewed for another thirteen episodes and the first seven were broadcast as series three in September 2010. The remaining six were broadcast in March 2011 as series four. The first major cast departures came at the end of the fourth series, with Ben Daniels and Bill Paterson leaving the series. Walsh, Bamber, Walter, and Agyeman all remained in their roles.

=== Series 5–6 (2011–12) ===
The next series was broadcast in July 2011 and saw [[Jamie Bamber]] leave in the fifth series finale. [[Dominic Rowan]] and [[Peter Davison]] joined the main cast, replacing Daniels and Paterson. The next seven episodes were broadcast in January 2012 as series six, and saw [[Paul Nicholls (actor)|Paul Nicholls]] join the cast as Sergeant Sam Casey. Jamie Bamber made his final uncredited appearance in the first episode of the series, in both flashback and photograph. It was later announced along with the commission of a seventh series that [[Harriet Walter]] and [[Freema Agyeman]] would depart off-screen, thus this was the final season to feature them as part of the regular cast.

=== Series 7–8 (2013–14) ===
The departures of Walter and Agyeman meant that [[Bradley Walsh]] was the only remaining cast member who had appeared from the first episode. A seventh series of six episodes aired from 14 July 2013, after being filmed in November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Munn |first=Patrick |url=http://www.tvwise.co.uk/2013/07/itv-sets-premiere-date-for-law-order-uk-season-7/ |title=ITV Sets Premiere Date For 'Law &amp; Order: UK' Season 7 |publisher=TVWise |date=2013-07-03 |accessdate=2013-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seventh series, broadcast eighteen months after the sixth series, won its time slot for all six episodes.&lt;ref name=RatingsChamp/&gt; [[Georgia Taylor]] and [[Paterson Joseph]] joined the main cast, while Paul Nicholls departed during the final episode of the series. On 28 June 2013, [[Bradley Walsh]] confirmed on ''[[This Morning (TV programme)|This Morning]]'' that an eighth series had been commissioned and would start filming in October 2013. ITV later confirmed that ''Law &amp; Order: UK'' would return in 2014 with an eight episode series, and that [[Doc Brown (rapper)|Ben Bailey Smith]] had been cast as DS Joe Hawkins who replaces Paul Nicholls as DS Sam Casey.&lt;ref name=RatingsChamp/&gt; The series began airing in the UK on 12 March 2014.&lt;ref name=RatingsChamp&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itv.com/presscentre/press-releases/itv-recommissions-law-order-uk-eighth-series#.UkQRRYZwqFl |title=ITV recommissions Law &amp; Order: UK for an eighth series |work=ITV Press Centre |publisher=[[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] |date=2013-09-26 |accessdate=2016-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paterson Joseph departed the main cast in the penultimate episode of the series, and was replaced by [[Sharon Small]] as Inspector Elisabeth Flynn. Former cast member Harriet Walter returned for a single-episode guest appearance.

In June 2014, broadcaster [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] and producer [[Kudos (production company)|Kudos]] issued a joint press release announcing that series 8 would be "the last to be transmitted for the foreseeable future".&lt;ref name=Over&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itv.com/presscentre/press-releases/itv-announces-law-order-uk-take-break-our-screens |title=ITV announces Law &amp; Order: UK is to take a break from our screens |work=ITV Press Centre |publisher=[[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] |date=2014-06-03 |accessdate=2016-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Episodes==
{{Main|List of Law &amp; Order: UK episodes}}

Originally commissioned as a single series of thirteen episodes, episodes 1–7 were transmitted as series one, broadcast in 2009, and episodes 8–13 were transmitted as series two, broadcast in 2010. A second run of thirteen episodes was commissioned in 2010, with episodes 1–7 being transmitted as series three, broadcast in 2010, and episodes 8–13 being transmitted as series four, broadcast in 2011. A third run of thirteen episodes was commissioned in October 2010, with episodes 1–6 being transmitted as series five, broadcast in 2011, and episodes 7–13 being transmitted as series six, broadcast in 2012. In August 2012, ITV commissioned a seventh series made up of eight episodes.

In Canada and the United States, for series 1-6, each thirteen-episode run was transmitted as a single series, meaning a total of three seasons had been broadcast through 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvthrong.co.uk/law-order-uk/itv-commissions-13-new-episodes-law-order-uk |title=ITV commissions 13 new episodes of Law &amp; Order: UK |work=tvthrong.co.uk |date=18 October 2010 |accessdate=26 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206103749/http://www.tvthrong.co.uk/law-order-uk/itv-commissions-13-new-episodes-law-order-uk |archivedate= 6 December 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the 6-episode series 7 was broadcast as season 4 in the US, a month after the UK broadcast. No date has been announced for the US broadcast of series 8.

On 30 April 2014, the final episode of series 8 was due to air at 9:00 but was pulled from broadcast hours prior due to the storyline's similarity to the murder of British teacher Ann Maguire in the same week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/law-order-uk-pulled-tv-3479969|title=Law and Order: UK pulled from TV schedules following fatal attack on Leeds teacher Anne Maguire|last=Leigh|first=Rob|date=30 April 2014|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode was instead due to be shown on the later date of 11 June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=9.00pm - 10.00pm |url=http://www.itv.com/presscentre/ep8week24/law-order-uk|title=Law &amp; Order: UK Episode 8 &amp;#124; presscentre |publisher=[[itv.com]] |date=2014-06-11 |accessdate=2014-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Filming==
Filming on the first series of ''Law &amp; Order: UK'' began in January 2008,&lt;ref name="itv20080115"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/Drama/copsandcrime/LawandOrder/default.html |title=Cast announced for Law &amp; Order: UK |accessdate=26 January 2009 |date=15 January 2008 |publisher=[[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116120419/http://www.itv.com/Drama/copsandcrime/LawandOrder/default.html |archivedate=16 January 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and after completion, ITV cutbacks were a concern for cast member [[Jamie Bamber]], who in an interview with Metro, stated "I think it will [return], but I don't know because as you know there are cutbacks on ITV."&lt;ref&gt;[http://metro.co.uk/2009/04/23/bamber-doubts-crime-show-return-54270/ ]&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] commissioned a further thirteen episodes, and filming began in the third quarter of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/jun/25/law-and-order-itv | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Leigh | last=Holmwood | title=Law &amp; Order to return to ITV | date=25 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; These episodes were subsequently broadcast from 9 September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.itv.com/documents/doc/Law%20and%20Order%20UK%20Series%203%5B3%5D.doc&lt;/ref&gt; For the Law part of the series, frequent filming on-location around [[London]] takes place, while for the Order part, filming around the exterior of the [[Old Bailey]] takes place concurrently on Sundays.

The campus of [[University College London]], including the main quadrangle and the cloisters, was used for the basis of filming for scenes aired in series six.&lt;ref name="Law &amp; Order gets UK makeover"/&gt;

==Cast==
{{main|List of Law &amp; Order: UK characters}}
The original cast of ''Law &amp; Order: UK'' consisted of [[Bradley Walsh]] as Sergeant Ronnie Brooks, [[Jamie Bamber]] as Sergeant Matt Devlin, and [[Harriet Walter]] as Inspector Natalie Chandler, [[Ben Daniels]] as Prosecutor James Steel, [[Freema Agyeman]] as Solicitor Alesha Phillips, and [[Bill Paterson (actor)|Bill Paterson]] as Director George Castle. Bamber was subsequently replaced by [[Paul Nicholls (actor)|Paul Nicholls]] as Sergeant Sam Casey, and later [[Doc Brown (rapper)|Ben Bailey-Smith]] as Sergeant Joe Hawkins, while Walter was succeeded by [[Paterson Joseph]] as Inspector Wes Layton, and [[Sharon Small]] as Inspector Elisabeth Flynn. Similarly, both [[Georgia Taylor]] and [[Dominic Rowan]] would succeed Agyeman and Daniels, respectively, as Prosecutors Kate Barker and Jake Thorne, whilst Paterson was succeeded by [[Peter Davison]], as Director Henry Sharpe.

Original cast member Walsh left the cast prior to a potential ninth series, though ITV's decision to place the show on hiatus after the series eight finale leaves Walsh's departure a moot point, and as such he remains the only actor to appear throughout the entire run of the series.

===Characters===
* Ronnie Brooks ([[Bradley Walsh]], series 1-8), is a Detective Sergeant assigned to London's Major Incident Unit. A recovering alcoholic and absent-father, Ronnie values his job more than anything. He lives to see justice served. Ronnie is the light-hearted leader and mentor of his Junior Partner, and has turned down numerous promotions in order to make a difference on the streets.
* Matt Devlin ([[Jamie Bamber]], series 1-5), is a Detective Sergeant and the Junior Partner to Ronnie's senior role. Flirtatious, tech-savvy and people-smart, Matt formed strong bonds with both Alesha and Natalie. It was no surprise then, that when he was gunned down outside a court-house, the team were inconsolable.
* Natalie Chandler ([[Harriet Walter]], series 1-6; guest star series 8), is the mother-figure to Ronnie's father-figure and the Senior Investigating Officer at the M.I.U. She departed to care for her mother, who was in the late stages of a terminal disease.
* James Steel ([[Ben Daniels]], series 1-4), is a senior crown prosecutor employed by the London CPS. 
* Alesha Phillips ([[Freema Agyeman]], series 1-6), is Steel's partner and a junior CPS prosecutor. A tough lawyer raised on the streets of London, Phillips had a flirty relationship with Devlin until his death. She departed the CPS to become a senior prosecutor in Greater Manchester. 
* George Castle ([[Bill Paterson (actor)|Bill Paterson]], series 1-4), was the first director of CPS London and the supervisor of Phillips and Steel. 
* Jake Thorne ([[Dominic Rowan]], series 5-8), was Phillips second partner, and a senior crown prosecutor.
* Henry Sharpe ([[Peter Davison]], series 5-8), succeeded Castle as the director of CPS London and was the direct supervisor to Thorne and Phillips. 
* Sam Casey ([[Paul Nicholls (actor)|Paul Nicholls]], series 6-7), is a Detective Sergeant who has worked at M.I.U. for several years. Originally assigned to investigate the death of Devlin, he was partnered with Ronnie on a full-time basis sometime during the subsequent year. He is a part-time dad, and presumably left the force to focus more wholly on the upbringing of his child.
* Kate Barker ([[Georgia Taylor]], series 7-8), replaced Phillips following her promotion. Loud and nosey, Barker was a defence barrister before joining Thorne, making it exceedingly difficult to build a professional relationship upon their adversarial experiences. 
* Wes Layton ([[Paterson Joseph]], series 7-8), worked with Ronnie during his days on the beat. Assigned to the MIU temporarily to cover Chandler's leave, but became her permanent replacement shortly thereafter. He was assassinated during series 8 as part of a series of gun-crimes that also targeted Sharpe. 
* Joe Hawkins ([[Doc Brown (rapper)|Ben Bailey Smith]], series 8), was Ronnie's third and final partner. A newly promoted DS, he is far more working class than his predecessors and as such possesses greater street smarts. Eager to learn, he's a fresh mind for Ronnie to mould, and he's fiercely loyal.
* Elisabeth Flynn ([[Sharon Small]], series 8) joined the team after she was promoted following an on-the-job injury. Her personal crusade was against knife-crime, making it ironic that that was the first case that fell onto her desk. She sees Ronnie as a dinosaur, and has a deep desire to modernise the police force. She appears only in the final episode of the series.

==Reception==
Independent writer Robin Jarossi, who attended a special preview of the premiere episode at the [[British Film Institute]] in London on 5 February 2009, praised the uniquely British take on the franchise for balancing the new vision while maintaining the proven ''Law &amp; Order'' formula. Jarossi specifically extolled the unexpected casting of Bradley Walsh, the excellent use of their London backdrop, and Chibnall's adaptation of the show.&lt;ref name="s10120090206"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Law &amp; Order: UK Review Episode 1|last=Jarossi|first=Robin|date=6 February 2009|work=suite101.com|publisher=Suite101.com Media Inc|location=[[Vancouver]], British Columbia, Canada|quote=ITV1 Succeeds with London Version of US Prime-time hit}}&lt;!-- blacklisted | url         =http://british-tv.suite101.com/article.cfm/law_order_uk_review_episode_1

While ''[[Radio Times]]'' reviewer Alison Graham felt the series' execution was adequate, she criticised its pacing and writing; the former for not matching that of the original ''Law &amp; Order'' programmes, and the latter for "falling headfirst into a typically British legal-drama trap of the noble prosecutor, crusading to bring the guilty to justice while pitted against the louche, self-serving defence barrister."&lt;ref name="RTcare"&gt;{{cite web

And wrong.".&lt;ref name="tnt20090311" /&gt; However, later on in the series' run ''[[The Observer|The Observer's]]'' Kathryn Flytt writes that despite her initial prejudices, the series "seems to have absorbed the pace and energy of the original without looking too tricksily derivative".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Barrister Caroline Haughey, a self-confessed crime junkie, said that ''Law and Order: UK'' made her cry:

&lt;blockquote&gt;the relationship between the officers and CPS was reasonably fair; however, the conduct of the Crown Prosecution Advocate in his talking directly to defendants and offering plea bargains was a step too far.  Law And Order State Side is excellent, but the translation of that justice system into our own jurisdiction is not really possible – CPS lawyers do NOT invite defendants to CPS HQ, and  do not run their own investigation.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Lumber Cartel''' was a facetious [[conspiracy theory]] popularized on [[USENET]] that claimed [[anti-spam]]mers were secretly paid agents of lumber companies.&lt;ref name="Goodman"&gt;{{cite book
|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kUp6p5P8waoC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;dq=lumber.cartel+spam&amp;sig=_mVXjVzCIL_Kea1ltz3sKTj4qGU
|title=Spam Wars: Our Last Best Chance to Defeat Spammers, Scammers, and Hackers
|author=[[Danny Goodman]]
|year=2004
|publisher=SelectBooks
|isbn=1-59079-063-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1997, a participant on [[news.admin.net-abuse.email]] posted an essay to the newsgroup. The essay described a [[conspiracy theory]]:

{{cquote|The original anti-spammer was in truth a major spammer just one day before two major lumber companies deposited a total of $275,000 into his account. He instantly stopped spamming and began what is now the biggest anti-spam ring on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://groups.google.com/group/news.admin.net-abuse.email/msg/387e586f6dd859ca| date=Nov 14, 1997| title=Possible Anti-Spam Conspiracy Uncovered| author=Vladimir| accessdate=2006-07-11| publisher=Google Groups| work=  news.admin.net-abuse.email}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The reasoning provided in the essay was that certain companies first destroy forests and make [[paper]] out of them, which is in turn used to send [[bulk mail]]. Since sending [[e-mail spam]] does not use paper at all, the essay argued, the lumber companies would want to stop it before it would surpass paper-based bulk mailing, and consequently only those in the pay of the lumber companies would be anti-spam.

The rationale was based in [[disclaimer]]s in certain spam messages that they were using electronic means in order to save paper. The joke eventually led to a club and numerous [[parody]] websites, most of which have long since disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|author=Brian S. McWilliams
|year=2005
|publisher=[[O'Reilly Media]]
|isbn=0-596-00732-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gatherings of anti-spammers on Usenet began to ridicule proponents of this theory, and many participants in [[news.admin.net-abuse.email]] chose to dub themselves as members of "the Lumber Cartel" in their [[signature block|signature]]s, followed immediately by the acronymic disclaimer "TinLC" (There is no Lumber Cartel), reminiscent of the [[There Is No Cabal]] catchphrase.&lt;ref name="Goodman"/&gt;  People were able to register with a website about the '''Lumber Cartel''' and were given a  sequential membership number. That was added to email sig files in [[news.admin.net-abuse.email]] and used on personal websites. There was no verification or requirement to receive the membership number.

'''''Mahaveer Janma Kalyanak''''', is one of the most important religious festivals for [[Jain]]s. It celebrates the birth of [[Mahaveer]], the twenty-fourth and last ''[[Tirthankara]]'' of ''[[Avasarpiṇī]]''.{{efn|descending half of the worldly time cycle as per [[Jain cosmology]] which is actually current now}} As per the [[Gregorian calendar]], the holiday occurs either in March or April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9dNOT9iYxcMC |title=Concise Encyclopaedia of India|first=K.R.|last=Gupta|publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Dist |date= 2006|accessdate=6 May 2017|isbn=9788126906390|p=1001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birth==
Most modern historians consider Kundagram (which is today's Kundalpur in Champaran district of Bihar) as [[Mahaveer]]'s birthplace, .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2003-10-14/patna/27173208_1_kundalpur-lord-Mahaveera-basokund|title=Row over Mahaveer’s birthplace|work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jain texts, Mahaveer was born on the thirteenth day of the bright half of the moon in the month of ''[[Chaitra]]'' in the year 599 BCE (Chaitra Sud 13).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=KpBuAAAAMAAJ|title=Gazetteers: Junagadh|last1=(India)|first1=Gujarat|year=1975|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kristi L. Wiley: ''Historical Dictionary of Jainism'', Lanham 2004, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Mahaveer was born in a democratic kingdom (Ganarajya), Vajji, where the king was chosen by votes. [[Vaishali district|Vaishali]] was its capital.{{sfn|Jalaj|2011|p=4}}

Mahaveer was named 'Vardhamana', which means "One who grows", because of the increased prosperity in the kingdom at the time of his birth.{{sfn|Kailash Chand Jain|1991|p=32}} In Vasokund, Mahaveer is much revered by the villagers. A place called ''Ahalya bhumi'' has not been ploughed for hundreds of years by the family that owns it, as it is considered to be the birthplace of Mahaveer.{{sfn|Jalaj|2011|p=4}}

==Birth legend==
[[File:Sixteen Symbolic Dreams.jpg|thumb|left|Sixteen auspicious dreams seen by the mother of all ''Tirthankara'']]
Mahaveer was born into [[Ikshvaku dynasty]] as the son of King [[Siddhartha of Kundagrama]] and Queen [[Trishala]]. During her pregnancy, Trishala was believed to have had a number of [[auspicious dreams]], all signifying the coming of a great soul. [[Digambara]] sect of Jainism holds that the mother saw sixteen dreams which were interpreted by the King Siddhartha.{{sfn|Pannalal Jain|2015|p=460}} According to the [[Svetambara]] sect, the total number of auspicious dreams is fourteen. It is said that when Queen Trishala gave birth to Mahaveer, [[Indra]], the head of heavenly beings (''[[Deva (Jainism)|devas]]'') performed a ritual called ''abhisheka on Sumeru Parvat'', this being the second of five auspicious events (''[[Panch Kalyanaka]]s''), said to occur in the life of all ''Tirthankaras''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Pramansagar|first=Muni|title=Jain tattvavidya|year=2008|publisher=Bhartiya Gyanpeeth|location=India|isbn=978-81-263-1480-5|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Celebrations==

During the day, most members of the [[Jain community]] engage in some sort of charitable act, prayers, pujas, and vratas. Many devotees visit temples dedicated to Mahaveer to meditate and offer prayers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Mahaveer Jayanti 2015: The importance of a Satvik meal |url=http://food.ndtv.com/food-drinks/mahavir-jayanti-2015-the-importance-of-a-satvik-meal-751655 |work=[[NDTV]] |date=2 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404075153/http://food.ndtv.com/food-drinks/mahavir-jayanti-2015-the-importance-of-a-satvik-meal-751655 |archivedate=4 April 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lectures by monks and nuns are held in temples to preach the path of virtue as defined by [[Jainism]]. Donations are collected in order to promote charitable missions like saving cows from slaughter or helping to feed poor people. Ancient Jain temples across India typically see an extremely high volume of practitioners come to pay their respects and join in the celebrations.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5350">'''Marathon IV: Road Rogue''' was an eight-day experimental music performance by [[Minneapolis]] musician and composer [[Mark Mallman]]. The project consisted of a continuous, 180-plus hour mobile webcast from the back of a van as it traveled from New York City to Los Angeles. The vehicle was equipped with technology that translated brain waves and heart rhythms into electronic music, allowing the artist to continue performing while he was sleeping.

==Origins==
[[Mark Mallman]] is a Minneapolis piano-based rock musician known for pushing creative and physical limits on stage. Among his most notable performances are a series of “Marathon” events. In 1999, he penned and performed a 26.2 hour song titled “Marathon” at St. Paul’s [[Turf Club (venue)|Turf Club]]. Five years later he doubled the feat with a 52.4 hour “Marathon 2” performance. And in October 2010 he completed “Marathon 3,” a 78.6-hour song that stretched across four days.

The “Marathon 4” concept emerged from conversations with Stuart DeVaan, a musician and technologist whose company Implex had provided live video streaming services for Marathon 3. DeVaan designed and built the rolling performance space inside a 1992 Vandura conversion van, complete with cameras, mixers, laptops, antennas and a data center to deliver. The duo also partnered with video producer Hamil Griffin-Cassidy and musician Gus Watkins.

==Performance==
The performance began Sept. 15, 2012, in New York City and concluded eight days later in Los Angeles following stops in Pittsburgh, Detroit, Chicago, Omaha, Denver and Las Vegas. The song featured few vocals and consisted of a largely ambient soundscape.&lt;ref name=current&gt;{{cite web|last=Swensson |first=Andrea |url=http://blog.thecurrent.org/2012/08/mark-mallman-planning-cross-continental-7-day-long-marathon-4/ |title=Mark Mallman planning cross-continental, 7-day-long Marathon 4 &amp;#124; Local Current Blog &amp;#124; The Current from Minnesota Public Radio |website=Blog.thecurrent.org |date=2012-08-20 |accessdate=2016-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; “Sometimes I’m making up lyrics and music and playing live. And then sometimes the machine makes its own music based on instructions.”&lt;ref name=star&gt;{{cite web|author=Debra Black |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2012/09/20/performance_artist_mark_mallman_tours_us_on_marathon_musicmaking_journey.html |title=Performance artist Mark Mallman tours U.S. on marathon music-making journey &amp;#124; Toronto Star |website=Thestar.com |date=2012-09-20 |accessdate=2016-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; From sunrise to sunset the musicians performed using conventional electronic music instruments, including electric guitar, a Yamaha keytar, iPad apps, a hacked NES cartridge and other gadgets.&lt;ref name=wired&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.wired.com/2012/09/brain-wave-music-road-trip/ |title=Road-Tripping Rocker to Livestream Brain Wave Music While He Sleeps |website=Wired.com |date=2012-09-13 |accessdate=2016-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; After dark it transitioned to a sleep-mode soundscape generated from the artist’s own biorhythms. 

==Technology==
As the sun set, the musician hooked himself up to a Polar heart-rate monitor and a Mattel Mindflex headset, both of which fed into a laptop through an Arduino-based microcontroller kit. Ableton Live sequencing software translated the signals into MIDI messages. One MIDI channel set the song’s tempo based on the heart-rate monitor. Meanwhile, a homebrew program called BioWave turned the brain output into an additional 10 MIDI signals to produce “ambient, chordal soundscapes.” The software was developed by a University of Georgia student.&lt;ref name=citypages&gt;{{cite web|author=Erik Hess |url=http://www.citypages.com/music/mark-mallman-preps-for-marathon-4-a-week-long-nyc-to-la-song-6645359 |title=Mark Mallman preps for Marathon 4, a week-long NYC to LA song |publisher=City Pages |date=2012-08-28 |accessdate=2016-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the day, the artist channeled brain waves through a program called Mind Synth using a different neuroheadset called the Emotiv Epoc, sometimes used to control wheelchairs.&lt;ref name=wired /&gt; The van was also equipped with five video cameras, mixers, analog-to-digital converters, and a data center containing a video encoding system and two-carrier cellular data system with outboard antennas.&lt;ref name=citypages /&gt;

==Objective==
Mallman wanted to build on his 78.6 hour “Marathon 3” performance but believed he was reaching the limit of what could be accomplished in a conventional performance and venue. “I had to abandon my body at a certain point, because it was just holding me back.”&lt;ref name=current /&gt; Initially he drew plans for a machine that would move his arms up and down mechanically before moving on to focus on generating sounds from his body’s involuntary systems.&lt;ref name=wired /&gt; “For me, it’s about exploring the back of the mind in music.”&lt;ref name=current /&gt;

The artist also sought to abandon the traditional concept of what a venue is. There was no in-person audience beyond the musicians and technicians inside the van, though the performance was broadcast live on the artist’s website, MarkMallman.com.&lt;ref name=current /&gt;

'''May Morning''' is an annual event in [[Oxford]], [[United Kingdom]], on [[May Day]] (1st May).

==Event==
The event starts early at 6am with the [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]] [[Choir]] singing a hymn, the [[Hymnus Eucharisticus]], from the top of [[Magdalen Tower, Oxford|Magdalen Tower]], a tradition of over 500 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.magd.ox.ac.uk/history/cc_hymnus.shtml May Morning] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060101040109/http://www.magd.ox.ac.uk/history/cc_hymnus.shtml |date=1 January 2006 }}, [[Magdalen College, Oxford]].&lt;/ref&gt; Large crowds normally gather under the tower along the [[High Street, Oxford|High Street]] and on [[Magdalen Bridge, Oxford|Magdalen Bridge]]. This is then followed by general revelry and festivities including [[Morris dance|Morris dancing]] in [[Radcliffe Square]] between the [[University Church of St Mary the Virgin|University Church]] and the [[Radcliffe Camera]], impromptu music, etc., for a couple of hours from around 6.15am onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dailyinfo.co.uk/mayday |title=May Eve &amp; May Day |author=&lt;!-- not stated --&gt;| website=Daily Info |access-date=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a party atmosphere, despite the early hour. In fact, there are normally all-night [[Ball (dance)|ball]]s the night before, so some people (especially students) are in formal attire (e.g., [[black tie]]/[[white tie]] or [[ball gown]]).

There is a modern tradition of students jumping from Magdalen Bridge. This occurred sporadically in the 1960s, becoming an annual event by the ?1980s. However the river is sometimes shallow, which has on occasion caused serious injury, notably in 1997 when one person was left paralyzed, and 2005 when ten were hopitalized&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/oxfordshire/4785758.stm| location=Oxford, UK | title=Jumpers' bridge closes on May Day  | date=8 March 2006 | accessdate=1 May 2013 | work=[[BBC News]] | publisher=[[BBC]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;. Hence the bridge was closed every May Morning 1998-2001 and 2006-2009.

In the 19th century, the young townsmen blew horns and ran riot, after the singing.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Activities have varied over the previous centuries.  [[Vera Brittain]] wrote a poem with the title ''May Morning'' in 1916. The first ten lines depict the actual event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ww1lit.nsms.ox.ac.uk/ww1lit/collections/item/1748 Vera Brittain, ''May Morning'.]&lt;/ref&gt; One fictional description of the Tudor May Morning is in "Towers in the Mist" by [[Elizabeth Goudge]].&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Goudge, ''Towers in the Mist''.&lt;/ref&gt; Another description is found in the film ''[[Shadowlands (1993 film)|Shadowlands]]'' directed by [[Richard Attenborough]], on an episode in the life of the English scholar, writer and fellow of Magdalen's [[C. S. Lewis]], starring [[Anthony Hopkins]] as C. S. Lewis and [[Debra Winger]] as [[Joy Davidman]].

'''Middlefaire''' is a festival site located near [[Hillsboro, Texas]].

The 21-acre site opened in 2006 and features four festivals.&lt;ref name=Watson&gt;{{cite news | title = Hillsboro festival gives guests a taste of the renaissance | first = John | last = Watson | date = 2010-09-26 | publisher = Cleburne Times-Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These are Texas Pirate Festival held in June, Magical &amp; Medieval Fantasy Faire in early October, Arts &amp; Crafts Fair in late October and Renaissance Festival in November.&lt;ref name=Reporter&gt;{{cite news | title = Pirate Fans Set Sail For Hillsboro | date = 2011-04-28 | publisher = The Hillsboro Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the Texas Pirate Festival &amp; The Renaissance Festival, the faire is presided over by the court of Queen Claude of France, played by Deborah Papst. Other notable figures are the Duke of Orleans played by Dean Papst. During the Fantasy Faire a number of courts are present including the fairy court; presided over by Pebbles the Fairy (Chelsea Craig), unseelie court, a creatures court with a Minotaur King and others. 

==History==
Middlefaire first opened with the Renaissance Festival on the weekend of October 14 and 15 in 2006.  The 21-acre fair was created and is owned by K. G. "Paul" Tuma, better known to fair-goers as Paul Delacroix.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; The site features several permanent buildings, about half of which were built by merchants who sell at the site. They are arranged in a 17th-century English village.&lt;ref name=Dallas&gt;{{cite news | title = Texas Pirate Festival at Middlefaire | date = 2011-05-05 | publisher = The Dallas Morning News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=spring&gt;{{cite news |title=On the town: spring festivals, Texas Pirate Festival at Middlefaire |author=Varghese, Bindu | url=http://www.dallasnews.com/entertainment/headlines/20110302-on-the-town-spring-festivals.ece |newspaper=The Dallas Morning News |date=March 2, 2011 |accessdate=May 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Middlefaire jack tar tavern.jpg|thumb|A girl exits Jack Tar Tavern at the first Texas Pirate Festival at Middlefaire.  Binky the WonderSkull can be seen in the shadows. (2010)]]
The fair site is located at 8581 State Highway 171 at the intersection of County Road 1458, five miles north of Hillsboro.&lt;ref name=spring /&gt;  All three fairs feature a variety of merchandise and entertainers typically singers, belly dancers, skits, musicians, pub sings, sword fights, jousting, pirate battles with historic working cannons, and other entertainments.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;  Flush toilets and camping are available on site.&lt;ref name="middlefaire"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.middlefest.com|title=Middlefaire|accessdate=Aug 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Minnesota Fringe Festival''' is a performing arts festival held in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], [[United States]], every summer, usually during the first two weeks in August.  The eleven-day event, which features performing artists of many genres and disciplines, is one of many [[Fringe Festival]]s in [[North America]].  Minnesota Fringe is the largest nonjuried festival in the United States&lt;ref name=2014stribstats&gt;{{cite news|last1=Royce|first1=Graydon|title=Fringe Festival hits new ticket record|url=http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/blogs/270773461.html|accessdate=November 24, 2014|work=[[Star Tribune]]|date=August 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the third-largest Fringe festival in North America.  In 2013, Minnesota Fringe ran August 1–11 and featured 176 shows with a total of 895 performances in multiple venues around the city and distributed 50,007 tickets over the eleven-day event. In 2007, attendance and box office revenue were adversely affected by the [[I-35W Mississippi River bridge|collapse of the I-35W bridge]] the day before the festival opened.

Fringe shows are 60 minutes or less and appear in an official venue supplied by the festival for five performances stretched out over the festival's eleven days.  Venues vary widely, with capacities ranging from 55 to over 400, and available configurations include black-box, proscenium, thrust or arena stages.  Past venues include Minneapolis Theatre Garage, [[HUGE Improv Theater]], [[Mixed Blood Theatre]] mainstage, [[Theatre de la Jeune Lune]]'s side stage and the four stages at the [[University of Minnesota]]'s [[Rarig Center]].&lt;ref name=2014venues&gt;{{cite news|title=Minnesota Fringe will have 20 Minneapolis venues|url=http://www.twincities.com/stage/ci_25426766/minnesota-fringe-will-have-20-minneapolis-venues|accessdate=November 24, 2014|work=[[St. Paul Pioneer Press]]|date=March 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Normally, eleven shows will share a venue.

Performing companies that participate in the Fringe split a share of the ticket revenues with the festival and pay an application fee.  Currently, the artists' share is 65 percent of the box office revenue.

The 2017 festival, which runs August 3-13, marks the 24th annual festival, the first under the leadership of executive director Dawn Bentley, who assumed this position on April 3, 2017,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Preston|first1=Rohan|title=A new director takes the helm at the Minnesota Fringe Festival|url=http://www.startribune.com/a-new-director-takes-the-helm-at-the-minnesota-fringe-festival/415000824/|accessdate=March 1, 2017|publisher=[[Star Tribune|Minneapolis Star Tribune]]|date=February 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; after former executive director Jeff D.

==History==
{{further|List of Minnesota Fringe Festivals}}
The Minnesota Fringe Festival was created as part of a trend of [[fringe festival]] establishments in the United States. The country's first fringe was the [[Seattle Fringe Festival]], founded in 1991, followed by the [[Orlando International Fringe Theater Festival]] and the [[San Francisco Fringe Festival]] in 1992 and 1993, respectively.&lt;ref name="NA fests"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hersh|first1=Amy|title=North American fringe fests: A new tradition that's growing|url=https://apps.hclib.org/auth/EDS?url=http%3a%2f%2fsearch.ebscohost.com%2flogin.aspx%3fdirect%3dtrue%26db%3dedb%26AN%3d9512033983%26site%3deds-live%26scope%3dsite|accessdate=June 14, 2016|work=[[Backstage (magazine)|Back Stage]]|date=November 17, 1995|subscription=yes|via=[[EBSCOHost]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded by Bob McFadden and operating with a budget of around $35,000, the Minnesota Fringe Festival first ran from June 23–July 2, 1994, in several theaters around the [[Cedar-Riverside, Minneapolis|West Bank]] neighborhood of [[Minneapolis]].&lt;ref name="fringe at 20"&gt;{{cite news|title=Minnesota Fringe Festival at 20|first1=Rohan|last1=Preston|url=http://www.startribune.com/minnesota-fringe-festival-at-20/217176491/|date=August 1, 2013|accessdate=July 9, 2016|work=[[Star Tribune]]|archivedate=July 9, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160709230904/http://www.startribune.com/minnesota-fringe-festival-at-20/217176491/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pizzato"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pizzato|first1=Mark|title=Minnesota Fringe Festival|journal=[[Theatre Journal]]|date=March 1995|volume=47|issue=1|pages=142–145|jstor=3208817|doi=10.2307/3208817}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of the festival's name, the Minnesota Fringe did not serve as the fringe festival to any larger, more mainstream theater event. The first annual Fringe was described by Mark Pizzato as "quickly organized and underpublicized", with low attendance reported at its 53 shows, each of which cost six dollars or less and ran under 90 minutes.&lt;ref name="pizzato" /&gt; It drew 4,600 theatergoers and featured shows from companies hailing from three continents (North America, Asia, and Europe).&lt;ref name="returns1995"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Abdallah|first1=Cheryl|title=Minnesota Fringe Festival Returns|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-2351423.html|accessdate=June 14, 2016|work=Asian Pages|date=June 30, 1995|subscription=yes|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival's growth was modest in its first several years. In 1997, following the previous year's festival which had seen the lowest attendance of any Fringe to date, the event moved to the [[Loring Park]] neighborhood.&lt;ref name="loring"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vaughan|first1=Peter|title=Grass is greener in Loring Park for Fringe|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-62606945.html|accessdate=July 9, 2016|work=[[Star Tribune]]|date=March 16, 1997|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year marked an attendance of 4,300, after which point Dean Seal replaced McFadden as the festival's executive director.&lt;ref name="seal steps down"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Royce|first1=Graydon|title=Fringe producer Seal steps down; festival reorganizes staff|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-78377664.html|accessdate=July 9, 2016|work=[[Star Tribune]]|date=September 18, 2001|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="passes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Preston|first1=Rohan|title=Fringe getting bigger|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-62564942.html|accessdate=July 9, 2016|work=[[Star Tribune]]|date=August 23, 1998|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, the festival began offering patrons multi-show passes and attendance increased to 6,573.&lt;ref name="passes" /&gt; The following year, the festival's attendance more than doubled, owing, according to Fringe officials, to better marketing and the 68 shows at that years festival, an increase from previous years.&lt;ref name="double"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Preston|first1=Rohan|title=Fans flocked to this year's Fringe Festival|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-62458919.html|accessdate=July 9, 2016|work=[[Star Tribune]]|date=August 12, 1999|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the Fringe won a $10,000 grant from the [[McKnight Foundation]] and once more expanded, to 80 shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Preston|first1=Rohan|title=Boosting the Fringe|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-62456545.html|accessdate=July 9, 2016|work=[[Star Tribune]]|date=April 23, 2000|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Festival operations, with a working budget of $260,000, were run out of an office space above the Acadia Cabaret Cafe in Minneapolis, and the festival had begun attracting a variety of sponsors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Peck|first1=Claude|title=Growth at the Fringe|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-63677082.html|accessdate=July 9, 2016|work=[[Star Tribune]]|date=July 23, 2000|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in its earlier years, acts had been selected by invitation, by the new millennium the festival was operating on an [[unjuried]] [[first-come, first-served]] model.&lt;ref name="loring" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2001 success"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Royce|first1=Graydon|title=Success presses Fringe|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-76875872.html|accessdate=July 9, 2016|work=[[Star Tribune]]|date=July 29, 2001|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2001 festival marked the first year that Fringe organizers had to turn away applicants, with the number of shows capped at 120.&lt;ref name="2001 success" /&gt; The festival had also expanded into screening films and showcasing visual art as part of the Visual Fringe.&lt;ref name="on the move"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Royce|first1=Graydon|title=Fringe is on the move|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-88131007.html|accessdate=July 9, 2016|work=[[Star Tribune]]|date=June 30, 2002|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2002 festival was the first in a number of years to employ venues outside of Loring Park, expanding the festival's footprint to the [[Uptown, Minneapolis|Uptown]] district. By this point, the Minnesota Fringe was the United States's largest fringe festival.&lt;ref name="on the move" /&gt; In the following years, the festival's most popular shows saw increased attendance, including record numbers of sold-out houses, as well as reprises and remounts at other venues, while mean attendance decreased, indicating decreased attendance at smaller shows.&lt;ref name="fifteen"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Royce|first1=Graydon|title=Fringe Festival attendance rose 15.3%|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-120860970.html|accessdate=July 9, 2016|work=[[Star Tribune]]|date=August 18, 2004|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="flowering"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Royce|first1=Graydon|title=Flowering Fringe|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-120279765.html|accessdate=July 9, 2016|work=[[Star Tribune]]|date=August 6, 2004|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper in 2004 announced plans to exit the Fringe after the 2005 festival, but stayed on an additional year to help solve fundraising issues that arose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Royce|first1=Graydon|title=Leah Cooper to quit Fringe Festival|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-122114236.html|accessdate=July 9, 2016|work=[[Star Tribune]]|date=September 16, 2004|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Royce|first1=Graydon|title=Fringe fest director says she is leaving|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-146700256.html|accessdate=July 9, 2016|work=[[Star Tribune]]|date=June 6, 2006|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the festival began using venues in the West Bank neighborhood again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Royce|first1=Graydon|title=Fringe fest adds U's Rarig Center to its stages|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-143738607.html|accessdate=July 9, 2016|work=[[Star Tribune]]|date=March 26, 2006|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features of the Minnesota Fringe==
[[File:The Donner Party Kidz!.jpg|thumb|right|''The Donner Party Kidz!'', a show from the 2012 Festival]]
===Nonjuried entry===
Minnesota Fringe Festival is nonjuried; that is, the performers and shows are not vetted by a panel of judges ahead of time.  Companies that wish to perform submit applications and are drawn by lottery, a practice that replaced the festival's former method of "first come, first served" in 2004.

===Performance categories===
The festival is open to all performing artists.  Show genres typically include comedy (scripted and improv), drama, dance (classical, modern and ethnic), puppetry, musical theater, opera and shows for/by children and teens. Minnesota Fringe, like many fringe festivals, has proven to be an excellent launching point for new work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.2amtheatre.com/2010/08/19/the-minnesota-fringe-festival-and-the-popularity-of-new-plays/ "The Minnesota Fringe Festival and the Popularity of New Plays"]; 2AMt blog, Max "Bunny" Sparber; 19 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accessibility===
Each venue is wheelchair-accessible and the festival offers ASL-interpreted shows for the deaf and hard-of-hearing, as well as audio-described shows for the blind.&lt;ref name=access&gt;{{cite news|title=Accessible Fringe Festival Returns for 13th Season|url=http://www.accesspress.org/archive/2006/07/story_accessible_fringe_festival.htm|accessdate=November 24, 2014|work=Access Press|date=July 10, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061014133421/http://www.accesspress.org/archive/2006/07/story_accessible_fringe_festival.htm|archivedate=October 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Bring Your Own Venue"===
In the past, Minnesota Fringe has provided an option for companies to produce site-specific work outside the official venues. The Bring Your Own Venue (BYOV) option was only available for shows that could not normally fit into a traditional theater space.  Past BYOV shows have been staged in places such as a clothing store dressing area, a swimming pool, an art gallery and a coffee shop.  In 2006, 23 shows, a record number, performed in BYOV slots.&lt;ref&gt;Papatola, Dominic; [http://www.twincities.com/mld/twincities/entertainment/performing_arts/15181139.htm "Wrinkle in the rules requires some fringers to get a place lift"]; St. Paul Pioneer Press; 3 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Website===
The [http://www.fringefestival.org Minnesota Fringe Festival Website] operates year-round.  All of the shows in the yearly festival are up for review by any audience member who registers on the site.  Shows are rated on a scale of 0 to 5 stars along with a written review.  Each show is assigned an overall star rating based on the average of all the reviews received.  Minnesota Fringe also retains a staff of photographers who attend shows and return photographs for the festival's daily slide show.  During the six-week 2013 festival period, the site received over a million pageviews.

{{Campaignbox Kosovo War}}

The '''NATO bombing of Yugoslavia''' was the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]]'s (NATO) military operation against the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] (FRY) during the [[Kosovo War]]. The air strikes lasted from March 24, 1999 to June 10, 1999. The official NATO operation code name was ''Operation Allied Force''; the [[United States]] called it "Operation Noble Anvil",&lt;ref name="Towards a common European security and defence policy: the ways and means of making it a reality"/&gt; while in Yugoslavia, the operation was incorrectly called "Merciful Angel" ({{lang-sr|Милосрдни анђео}}/''Milosrdni anđeo''), as a result of a misunderstanding or mistranslation.&lt;ref name="RTS-2009"&gt;[[Radio Television of Serbia|RTS]]: [http://www.rts.rs/page/stories/ci/story/1/%D0%A1%D1%80%D0%B1%D0%B8%D1%98%D0%B0/52257/%D0%9F%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BA%D0%BB%D0%BE+%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B0+%22%D0%9C%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%80%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%B8+%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%92%D0%B5%D0%BE%22 Порекло имена "Милосрдни анђео" (''On the origin of the name "Merciful Angel")] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102044701/http://www.rts.rs/page/stories/ci/story/1/%D0%A1%D1%80%D0%B1%D0%B8%D1%98%D0%B0/52257/%D0%9F%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BA%D0%BB%D0%BE+%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B0+%22%D0%9C%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%80%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%B8+%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%92%D0%B5%D0%BE%22 |date=November 2, 2012 }}, March 26, 2009 {{sr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bombings continued until an agreement was reached that led to the withdrawal of Yugoslav armed forces from Kosovo, and the establishment of [[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo]] (UNMIK), a UN [[peacekeeping]] mission in Kosovo.

The bloodshed, ethnic cleansing of thousands of Albanians driving them into neighbouring countries, and the potential of it to destabilize the region provoked intervention by international organizations and agencies, such as the United Nations, NATO, and [[International non-governmental organization|INGO]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jordan|first=Robert S.|title=International organizations: A comparative approach to the management of cooperation|p=129|year=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780275965495}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yoshihara|first=Susan Fink|chapter=Kosovo|pp=67–68|editor1-last=Reveron|editor1-first=Derek S.|editor2-last=Murer|editor2-first=Jeffrey Stevenson|title=Flashpoints in the War on Terrorism|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135449315}}&lt;/ref&gt;
NATO countries attempted to gain authorisation from the [[United Nations Security Council]] for military action, but were opposed by [[China]] and [[Russia]] that indicated they would veto such a proposal. NATO launched a campaign without UN authorisation, which it described as a [[humanitarian intervention]]. The FRY described the NATO campaign as an illegal [[war of aggression]] against a sovereign country that was in violation of [[international law]] because it did not have UN Security Council support.

The bombing killed between 489 and 528 civilians, and destroyed bridges, industrial plants, public buildings, private businesses, as well as barracks and military installations.

The NATO bombing marked the second major combat operation in its history, following the [[Operation Deliberate Force|1995 NATO bombing campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. It was the first time that NATO had used military force without the approval of the [[UN Security Council]].&lt;ref name="rt.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rt.com/news/yugoslavia-kosovo-nato-bombing-705/ |title=15 years on: Looking back at NATO's 'humanitarian' bombing of Yugoslavia — RT News |newspaper=www.rt.com |date=March 24, 2004 |accessdate=October 26, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161203123353/https://www.rt.com/news/yugoslavia-kosovo-nato-bombing-705/ |archive-date=December 3, 2016 |dead-url=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{transcluded section|Yugoslav Wars}}
{{#section::Yugoslav Wars|KosoovoWar}}

==Goals==
[[NATO]]'s objectives in the [[Kosovo conflict]] were stated at the [[North Atlantic Council]] meeting held at NATO headquarters in [[Brussels]] on April 12, 1999:&lt;ref name="NATO_situation"/&gt;
* An end to all military action and the immediate termination of [[War crimes in the Kosovo War|violence and repressive activities by the Milosevic government]];
* Withdrawal of all military, police and paramilitary forces from Kosovo;
* Stationing of UN peacekeeping presence in Kosovo;
* Unconditional and safe return of all [[refugee]]s and displaced persons;
* Establishment of a political framework agreement for Kosovo based on [[Rambouillet Accords]], in conformity with [[international law]] and the [[Charter of the United Nations]].

==Strategy==
Operation Allied Force predominantly used a large-scale [[aerial warfare|air campaign]] to destroy Yugoslav military infrastructure from high altitudes. After the third day of aerial bombing, NATO had destroyed almost all of its strategic military targets in Yugoslavia. Despite this, the Yugoslav Army continued to function and to attack [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] (KLA) insurgents inside Kosovo, mostly in the regions of Northern and Southwest Kosovo. NATO bombed strategic economic and societal targets, such as bridges, military facilities, official government facilities, and factories, using long-range cruise missiles to hit heavily defended targets, such as strategic installations in [[Belgrade]] and [[Pristina]]. The NATO air forces also targeted infrastructure, such as power plants (using the [[Graphite bomb|BLU-114/B "Soft-Bomb"]]), water-processing plants and the state-owned broadcaster, causing much environmental and economic damage throughout Yugoslavia.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

The [[Rand Corporation]] examined the issue in a study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monograph_reports/MR1365/MR1365.ch4.pdf |title=Why Milosevic Decided to Settle the Conflict Over Kosovo When He Did|access-date=April 6, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180904010418/https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monograph_reports/MR1365/MR1365.ch4.pdf |archive-date=September 4, 2018 |dead-url=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=April 2017}} The [[Netherlands|Dutch]] then-foreign minister [[Jozias van Aartsen]] said that the strikes on Yugoslavia should be such as to weaken their military capabilities and prevent further humanitarian atrocities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://international.sp.nl/sites/international.sp.nl/files/the_last_war.pdf |title=The Last War of the 20th century |access-date=March 24, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140830064549/http://international.sp.nl/sites/international.sp.nl/files/the_last_war.pdf |archive-date=August 30, 2014 |dead-url=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=November 2018}}

Due to restrictive media laws, media in Yugoslavia carried little coverage of what its forces were doing in Kosovo, or of other countries' attitudes to the humanitarian crisis; so, few members of the public expected bombing, instead thinking that a diplomatic deal would be made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Judah|title= The Serbs|publisher= Yale University Press|isbn= 978-0-300-15826-7|page= 327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arguments for strategic air power===
According to [[John Keegan]], the capitulation of Yugoslavia in the Kosovo War marked a turning point in the history of warfare. It "proved that a war can be won by air power alone". By comparison, diplomacy had failed before the war, and the deployment of a large NATO ground force was still weeks away when [[Slobodan Milošević]] agreed to a peace deal.&lt;ref name="telegraph"/&gt;

As for why air power should have been capable of acting alone, it has been argued{{by whom|date=October 2014}} that there are several factors required. These normally come together only rarely, but all occurred during the Kosovo War:&lt;ref name="bombardment"/&gt;

# Bombardment needs to be capable of causing destruction while minimising casualties. This causes pressure within the population to end hostilities rather than to prolong them. The exercise of precision air power in the Kosovo War is said{{by whom|date=October 2014}} to have provided this.
# The government must be susceptible to pressure from within the population. As was demonstrated by the overthrow of Milošević a year later, the Yugoslav government was only weakly authoritarian and depended upon support from within the country.
# There must be a disparity of military capabilities such that the opponent is unable to inhibit the exercise of air superiority over its territory. Serbia, a relatively small impoverished [[Balkan]] state, faced a much more powerful [[NATO]] coalition including the United Kingdom and the United States.
# [[Carl von Clausewitz]] once called the "essential mass of the enemy" his "centre of gravity". Should the center of gravity be destroyed, a major factor in Yugoslav will to resist would be broken or removed. In Milošević's case, the centre of gravity was his hold on power. He manipulated hyperinflation, sanctions and restrictions in supply and demand to allow powerful [[business]] interests within Serbia to profit and they responded by maintaining him in power. The damage to the economy, which squeezed it to a point where there was little profit to be made, threatened to undermine their support for Milošević if the air campaign continued, whilst causing costly infrastructure damage.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

===Arguments against strategic air power===
# Diplomacy:
## According to British Lieutenant-General Mike Jackson, Russia's decision on June 3, 1999 to back the West and to urge Milošević to surrender was the single event that had "the greatest significance in ending the war".  The Yugoslav capitulation came the same day.&lt;ref name="telegraph2"/&gt; Russia relied on Western economic aid at the time, which made it vulnerable to pressure from NATO to withdraw support for Milošević.&lt;ref name="history3"/&gt;
## Milošević's indictment by the UN as a war criminal (on May 24, 1999), even if it did not influence him personally, made the likelihood of Russia resuming diplomatic support less likely.&lt;ref name="rand"/&gt;
## The [[Rambouillet Agreement]] of March 18, 1999, had Yugoslavia agreed to it, would have given NATO forces the right of transit, [[Bivouac shelter|bivouac]], [[Military exercise|manoeuvre]], [[billet]], and utilisation across Serbia. By the time Milošević capitulated, NATO forces were to have access only to Kosovo proper.&lt;ref name="hosmer2001"/&gt;
## The international civil presence in the province was to be under UN control which allowed for a Russian veto should Serb interests be threatened.&lt;ref name="hosmer2001"/&gt;
# Concurrent ground operations – The KLA undertook operations in Kosovo itself and had some successes against Serb forces. The Yugoslav army abandoned a border post opposite Morinë near the Yugoslav army outpost at [[Kosare]] in the north west of the province. The Yugoslav army outpost at Kosare remained in Yugoslav hands throughout the war: this allowed for a supply line to be set up into the province and the subsequent taking of territory in the [[Junik]] area. The KLA also penetrated a few miles into the south-western Mount Pastrik area. But most of the province remained under Serb control.&lt;ref name="hosmer5"/&gt;
# Potential ground attack – General [[Wesley Clark]], [[Supreme Allied Commander Europe]], was "convinced" that planning and preparations for ground intervention "in particular, pushed Milošević to concede".&lt;ref name="general"/&gt;  The Yugoslav capitulation occurred on the same day that U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] held a widely publicised meeting with his four [[Joint Chiefs of Staff|service chiefs]] to discuss options for a ground-force deployment in case the air war failed.&lt;ref name="lambeth"/&gt; However, France and Germany vigorously opposed a ground offensive, and had done so for some weeks, since April 1999. French estimates suggested that an invasion would need an army of 500,000 to achieve success. This left NATO, particularly the United States, with a clear view that a land operation had no support. With this in mind, the Americans reaffirmed their faith in the air campaign.&lt;ref name="ritchie"/&gt; The reluctance of NATO to use ground forces casts serious doubt on the idea that Milošević capitulated out of fear of a land invasion.&lt;ref name="ritchie6"/&gt;

==Operation==
On March 20, 1999 [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] [[Kosovo Verification Mission]] monitors withdrew from Kosovo citing a "steady deterioration in the security situation",&lt;ref name=PerlezJ-TNYT-1999-03-22&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E00E0D71031F931A15750C0A96F958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all|title=Conflict in the Balkans: The Overview; Milosevic to Get One 'Last Chance' to Avoid Bombing|last=Perlez|first=Jane|date=March 22, 1999|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=February 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kosovo Verification Mission (Closed)|publisher=[[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]]|url=http://www.osce.org/node/44552|accessdate=October 22, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130119202021/http://www.osce.org/node/44552|archive-date=January 19, 2013|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on March 23, 1999 [[Richard Holbrooke]] returned to Brussels and announced that peace talks had failed.&lt;ref name="bbc23mar99"/&gt; Hours before the announcement, Yugoslavia announced on national television it had declared a [[state of emergency]] citing an "imminent threat of war ... against Yugoslavia by Nato" and began a huge mobilisation of troops and resources.&lt;ref name="bbc23mar99"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wp99mar24"/&gt; On March 23, 1999 at 22:17 UTC the [[Secretary General of NATO]], [[Javier Solana]], announced he had directed the [[Supreme Allied Commander Europe]] (SACEUR), General [[Wesley Clark]], to "initiate air operations in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia."&lt;ref name="wp99mar24"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Press Statement by Dr. Javier Solana, Secretary General of NATO"/&gt; On March 24 at 19:00 UTC NATO started the bombing campaign against Yugoslavia.&lt;ref name="The Kosovo Report: Conflict, International Response, Lessons Learned"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Press Statement by Dr. Javier Solana, NATO Secretary General following the Commencement of Air Operations"/&gt;

{{see also|Civilian casualties during Operation Allied Force}}
NATO's bombing campaign involved 1,000 aircraft operating from air bases in Italy and Germany, and the aircraft carrier {{USS|Theodore Roosevelt|CVN-71|6}} stationed in the [[Adriatic Sea]]. At dusk,{{when|date=June 2015}} [[F/A-18 Hornet]]s of the [[Spanish Air Force]] were the first NATO planes to bomb Belgrade and perform [[SEAD]] operations. [[BGM-109 Tomahawk]] [[cruise missile]]s were fired from ships and [[submarine]]s. The U.S. was the dominant member of the coalition against [[Yugoslavia]], although other NATO members were involved. During the ten weeks of the conflict, NATO aircraft flew over 38,000 combat missions. For the [[German Air Force]], this mission was its first conflict participation since [[World War II]]. In addition to air power, one battalion of [[Apache helicopter]]s from the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]'s [[11th Aviation Regiment]] was deployed to help combat missions. The regiment was augmented by pilots from [[Fort Bragg (North Carolina)|Fort Bragg]]'s [[82nd Airborne]] Attack Helicopter Battalion. The battalion secured AH-64 Apache attack helicopter refueling sites, and a small team forward deployed to the Albania – Kosovo border to identify targets for NATO air strikes.

The campaign was initially designed to destroy Yugoslav air defenses and high-value military targets.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

[[File:Ostruznica Highway Bridge.jpg|thumb|left|Ostruznica highway bridge hit during Operation Allied Force]]
NATO military operations increasingly attacked Yugoslav units on the ground; as well as continuing the strategic bombardment.
Montenegro was bombed several times, and NATO refused to prop up the precarious position of its anti-Milošević leader, [[Milo Đukanović]]. "[[Dual-use]]" targets, used by civilians and military, were attacked; the targets included bridges across the [[Danube]], factories, power stations, telecommunications facilities, headquarters of [[Yugoslavian Leftists]], a political party led by Milošević's wife, and the [[Avala TV Tower]]. Some protested that these actions were violations of [[international law]] and the [[Geneva Conventions]]. NATO argued these facilities were potentially useful to the Yugoslav military and thus their bombing was justified.

====NATO command organisation====
Solana directed Clark to "initiate air operations in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia". Clark then delegated responsibility for the conduct of Operation Allied Force to the Commander-in-Chief of Allied Forces Southern Europe who in turn delegated control to the Commander of Allied Air Forces Southern Europe, Lieutenant-General Michael C. Short, USAF.&lt;ref name="Biographies:Lieutenant General Michael C. Short"/&gt; Operationally, the day-to-day for responsibility for executing missions was delegated to the Commander of the 5th Allied Tactical Air Force.&lt;ref name="nato7"/&gt;

===Yugoslav operations===
[[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|The Hague Tribunal]] ruled that over 700,000 [[Kosovo Albanian]]s were forcibly displaced by Yugoslav forces into neighbouring Albania and Macedonia, with many thousands displaced within Kosovo.&lt;ref name="verdict"/&gt; By April, the United Nations reported 850,000 [[refugee]]s had left Kosovo.&lt;ref name="preparedness"/&gt; Another 230,000 were listed as internally displaced persons (IDPs): driven from their homes, but still inside Kosovo. [[List of German foreign ministers|German Foreign Minister]] [[Joschka Fischer]] claimed the refugee crisis was produced by a Yugoslav plan codenamed "[[Operation Horseshoe]]".

[[Radio Television of Serbia|Serbian Television]] claimed that huge columns of [[refugees]] were fleeing Kosovo because of NATO's bombing, not Yugoslav military operations.&lt;ref name="Larsen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rozen"/&gt; The Yugoslav side and its Western supporters claimed the refugee outflows were caused by a mass panic in the Kosovo Albanian population, and that the exodus was generated principally by fear of NATO bombs.

The United Nations and international [[human rights]] organisations were convinced the crisis resulted from a policy of [[ethnic cleansing]]. Many accounts from both Serbs and Albanians identified Yugoslav security forces and paramilitaries as the culprits, responsible for systematically emptying towns and villages of their Albanian inhabitants by forcing them to flee.&lt;ref name="SENSE Tribunal : ICTY"/&gt;

Atrocities against civilians in Kosovo were the basis of United Nations [[war crimes]] charges against Milošević and other officials responsible for directing the Kosovo conflict.

[[File:Против ваздушна одбрана покушава да обори НАТО бомбардере.jpeg|thumb|Yugoslav anti-aircraft fire at night]]
An important portion of the war involved combat between the [[Air Force of Serbia and Montenegro|Yugoslav Air Force]] and the opposing air forces. [[United States Air Force]] [[F-15 Eagle|F-15s]] and [[F-16]]s flying mainly from Italian air force bases attacked the defending Yugoslav fighters; mainly [[MiG-29]]s, which were in poor condition, due to lack of spare parts and maintenance. Other [[NATO]] forces also contributed to the air war.

Air combat incidents:
* During the night of March 24/25, 1999: Yugoslav air force scrambled five MiG-29s to counter the initial attacks. The two fighters that took off from [[Niš Constantine the Great Airport|Niš Airport]] were vectored to intercept targets over southern Serbia and Kosovo, were dealt with by NATO fighters: the MiG-29 flown by Maj. Dragan Ilić was damaged.  He landed with one engine out and the aircraft was later expended as a decoy. The second MiG, flown by Maj. Ilijo Arizanov, was shot down by an USAF F-15C piloted by Lt. Col. Cesar Rodriguez. The pair from [[Batajnica Air Base]] (Maj. Nebojša Nikolić and Maj. Ljubiša Kulačin), were engaged by USAF Capt. Mike Shower who shot down Nikolić while Kulačin evaded several missiles fired at him while fighting to bring his malfunctioning systems back to working order. Eventually realising that he could not do anything, and with Batajnica AB under attack, he diverted to [[Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport]], and landed safely, his aircraft temporarily concealed under the tail of a parked retired airliner.&lt;ref name="Belgrade Airport, Serbia – Aircraft Concealment"/&gt; The fifth and last MiG-29 to get airborne that night was flown by Maj. Predrag Milutinović. Immediately after take-off his radar failed and electrical generator malfunctioned. Shortly after, he was warned by SPO-15 of being acquired by fire control radar, but he eluded the opponent by several evasive manoeuvres. Attempting to evade further encounters, he approached Niš Airport intending to land when he was hit by an [[2K12 Kub]] in a [[friendly fire]] incident and forced to eject. In total, the 127.LAE launched five MiG-29s on that night, of which three were shot down, one badly damaged, and one returned in unserviceable condition. Not a single pilot was killed – even if it would take few days until one of them was recovered. Closer examination of available evidence indicates that Maj. Arizanov was shot down by USAF Col. Rodriguez, while Majors Nikolic and Kulacin were engaged by USAF Capt. Showers, who eventually shot down Nikolic. Maj. Milutinovic's aircraft was probably shot down by a KLU F-16AM flown by Maj. Peter Tankink.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.f-16.net/f-16-news-article607.html |title=How Dutch F-16AMs shot down a Mig-29 |website=F-16.net |date=April 21, 1999 |author=Lieven Dewitte |accessdate=October 26, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104180203/http://www.f-16.net/f-16-news-article607.html |archive-date=November 4, 2016 |dead-url=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.f-16.net/f-16-news-article230.html |title=First combat success for F-16MLU |website=F-16.net |date=March 24, 1999 |author=Lieven Dewitte |accessdate=October 26, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161026231312/http://www.f-16.net/f-16-news-article230.html |archive-date=October 26, 2016 |dead-url=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the morning of March 25: Maj. Slobodan Tešanović stalled his MiG-29 while landing on [[Užice-Ponikve Airport|Ponikve Airbase]] after a re-base flight. He ejected safely.&lt;ref name="ejection-history1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="acig.org"/&gt;
* During the war Yugoslav strike aircraft [[J-22 Orao]]s and [[G-4 Super Galeb]]s performed some 20–30 combat missions against the [[Kosovo Liberation Army|KLA]] in Kosovo at treetop level&lt;ref name="CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: THE AIR THREAT; Out of NATO's Reach: Yugoslavia's Treetop War – New York Times"/&gt; causing some casualties. During one of those missions on March 25, 1999, Lt. Colonel Života Ðurić was killed when his J-22 Orao hit a hill in Kosovo. It was never firmly established whether an aircraft malfunction, pilot error or an enemy action (by KLA) was the cause (NATO never claimed they shot it down).&lt;ref name="ejection-history1"/&gt;
* In the afternoon of March 25, 1999: Two Yugoslav MiG-29s took off from Batajnica to chase a lone NATO aircraft flying in the direction of Bosnia. They crossed the border and were engaged by two US [[F-15 Eagle|F-15s]]. Both MiGs were shot down by Captain Jeff Hwang.&lt;ref name="faqs"/&gt; One MiG pilot, Major Slobodan Perić having evaded at least one missile before being hit ejected and was later smuggled back to Yugoslavia by the [[Republika Srpska]] police. The other pilot, Captain Zoran Radosavljević, did not eject and was killed.&lt;ref name="Yugoslav"/&gt;
* On March 27, 1999, the 3rd Battalion of the 250th Missile Brigade, under the command of Colonel [[Zoltán Dani]], equipped with the Isayev S-125 'Neva-M' (NATO designation [[SA-3 Goa]]), [[Shooting down of F-117|downed]] an American [[F-117 Nighthawk]].&lt;ref name="Serb discusses 1999 downing of stealth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dictionaryofwar"/&gt; Yugoslav air defense operators found they could detect F-117s with "obsolete" Soviet radars operating on long wavelengths.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} The pilot ejected and was rescued by [[search and rescue]] forces near Belgrade.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} This was the first and so far only time a [[stealth aircraft]] has been shot down.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}
* On April 5–7, 1999, one Yugoslav MiG-29 was scrambled to intercept NATO aircraft, but each time Yugoslav pilots refused battle due to malfunctions.&lt;ref name="acig.org"/&gt;
* On April 30, some American sources confirm that a second F-117A was damaged by a surface-to-air missile.&lt;ref name="moon"/&gt; Although the aircraft returned to base, it supposedly never flew again.&lt;ref name="das"/&gt;&lt;ref name="airforces"/&gt;
* On May 2, an American [[F-16]] was shot down near [[Šabac]], by a [[SA-3]] again fired by the 3rd Battalion of the 250th Missile Brigade. The pilot Lt. Colonel [[David Goldfein]], commander of the [[555th Fighter Squadron]] at the time was rescued.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} On the same day an [[A-10 Thunderbolt II]] was heavily damaged by [[Strela 2]] shoulder-mounted SAM over Kosovo and had to make an emergency landing in [[Skopje "Alexander the Great" Airport|Skopje]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]].&lt;ref name="sponauer1"/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=November 2013}} Also a US-operated Harrier jump-jet crashed while returning to the amphibious assault carrier [[USS Kearsarge (LHD-3)|USS ''Kearsarge'']] from a training mission.

* On May 4, a Yugoslav [[MiG-29]], piloted by Lt. Colonel Milenko Pavlović, commander of the [[204th Fighter Aviation Wing]] was shot down at a low altitude over his native city Valjevo by two USAF F-16s. The falling aircraft was possibly hit as well by [[Strela 2]] fired by Yugoslav troops. Pavlović was killed.&lt;ref name="Yugoslav"/&gt;
* On May 11 an A-10 was lightly damaged over Kosovo.&lt;ref name="sponauer1"/&gt;
* During the war NATO lost two [[AH-64 Apache]] strike helicopters (one on April 26 and the other on May 4&lt;ref name="AH-64 Apache"/&gt; in Albania near the border with Yugoslavia, in training accidents resulting in death of two crew members).
* NATO reported that it lost 21 UAVs to technical failures or enemy action during the conflict, including at least seven German UAVs and five French UAVs. While the commander of the Yugoslav Third Army claimed that 21 NATO UAVs had been shot down by Yugoslav forces, another Yugoslav general claimed that Yugoslav air defenses and ground forces had shot down 30 UAVs.{{sfn|Rip|Hasik|2002|p=411}}

===KFOR===
By the start of April, the conflict seemed closer to resolution. NATO countries began to deliberate about invading Kosovo with ground units. U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] was reluctant to commit US forces for a ground offensive. At the same time, Finnish and Russian negotiators continued to try to persuade Milošević to back down. Faced with little alternative, Milošević accepted the conditions offered by a Finnish-Russian mediation team and agreed to a military presence within Kosovo headed by the UN, but incorporating NATO troops.

On June 12, after Milošević accepted the conditions, [[Kosovo Force|KFOR]] began entering Kosovo. KFOR, a NATO force, had been preparing to conduct combat operations, but in the end, its mission was only peacekeeping. It was based upon the [[Allied Rapid Reaction Corps]] headquarters commanded by then Lieutenant General [[Mike Jackson (British Army officer)|Mike Jackson]] of the [[British Army]]. It consisted of British forces (a brigade built from 4th Armored and 5th Airborne Brigades), a [[French Army]] Brigade, a [[German Army]] brigade, which entered from the west while all the other forces advanced from the south, and [[Italian Army]] and US Army brigades.

The U.S. contribution, known as the Initial Entry Force, was led by the U.S. [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]]. Subordinate units included TF 1–35 Armor from Baumholder, Germany, the 2nd Battalion, 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, the [[26th Marine Expeditionary Unit]] from [[Camp Lejeune]], [[North Carolina]], the 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry Regiment from Schweinfurt, Germany, and Echo Troop, 4th Cavalry Regiment, also from Schweinfurt, Germany. Also attached to the U.S. force was the [[Greek Army]]'s 501st Mechanised Infantry Battalion. The initial U.S. forces established their area of operation around the towns of Uroševac, the future [[Camp Bondsteel]], and Gnjilane, at [[Camp Monteith]], and spent four months – the start of a stay which continues to date – establishing order in the southeast sector of Kosovo.

The first NATO troops to enter Pristina on June 12, 1999 were [[Norway|Norwegian]] special forces from FSK [[Forsvarets Spesialkommando]] and soldiers from the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Special Air Service]] 22 S.A.S, although to NATO's diplomatic embarrassment Russian troops arrived first at the airport. The Norwegian soldiers from FSK [[Forsvarets Spesialkommando]] were the first to come in contact with the Russian troops at the airport. FSK's mission was to level the negotiating field between the belligerent parties, and to fine-tune the detailed, local deals needed to implement the peace deal between the Serbians and the Kosovo Albanians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.norli.no/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?urlRequestType=Base&amp;catalogId=10051&amp;categoryId=&amp;productId=1085065&amp;errorViewName=ProductDisplayErrorView&amp;urlLangId=-101&amp;langId=-101&amp;top_category=&amp;parent_category_rn=&amp;storeId=10651|title=Krigere og diplomater|website=Norli.no|accessdate=October 26, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307042943/http://www.norli.no/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/productdisplay?catalogid=10051&amp;categoryid=&amp;errorviewname=productdisplayerrorview&amp;langid=-101&amp;parent_category_rn=&amp;productid=1085065&amp;storeid=10651&amp;top_category=&amp;urllangid=-101&amp;urlrequesttype=base|archive-date=March 7, 2016|dead-url=no}}{{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.norli.no/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?urlRequestType=Base&amp;catalogId=10051&amp;categoryId=&amp;productId=286391&amp;errorViewName=ProductDisplayErrorView&amp;urlLangId=-101&amp;langId=-101&amp;top_category=&amp;parent_category_rn=&amp;storeId=10651|title=Norges hemmelige krigere|website=norli.no|accessdate=October 26, 2016|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421051414/http://www.norli.no/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?urlRequestType=Base&amp;catalogId=10051&amp;categoryId=&amp;productId=286391&amp;errorViewName=ProductDisplayErrorView&amp;urlLangId=-101&amp;langId=-101&amp;top_category=&amp;parent_category_rn=&amp;storeId=10651|archivedate=April 21, 2014}}{{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/utenriks/montenegro/britisk-og-norske-soldater-i-pristina/a/3978724|title=Britisk og norske soldater i Pristina - Montenegro - VG|newspaper=Vg.no|date=June 12, 1999|accessdate=October 26, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024223014/http://www.vg.no/nyheter/utenriks/montenegro/britisk-og-norske-soldater-i-pristina/a/3978724/|archive-date=October 24, 2016|dead-url=no}} {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/utenriks/norske-elitesoldater-skamroses/a/6450899|title=Norske elitesoldater skamroses|newspaper=Vg.no|date=March 3, 2000|accessdate=October 26, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024153321/http://www.vg.no/nyheter/utenriks/norske-elitesoldater-skamroses/a/6450899/|archive-date=October 24, 2016|dead-url=no}} {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the initial incursion, the U.S. soldiers were greeted by Albanians cheering and throwing flowers as U.S. soldiers and KFOR rolled through their villages.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} Although no resistance was met, three U.S. soldiers from the Initial Entry Force lost their lives in accidents.&lt;ref name="specialist"/&gt;

Following the military campaign, the involvement of Russian peacekeepers proved to be tense and challenging to the NATO Kosovo force. The Russians expected to have an independent sector of Kosovo, only to be unhappily surprised with the prospect of operating under NATO command. Without prior communication or coordination with NATO, Russian peacekeeping forces entered Kosovo from [[Bosnia]] and seized [[Pristina International Airport]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In 2010 [[James Blunt]] in an interview described how his unit was given the assignment of securing the Pristina in advance of the 30,000-strong peacekeeping force and the Russian army had moved in and taken control of the airport before his unit's arrival. As the first officer on the scene, Blunt shared a part in the difficult task of addressing the potentially violent international incident. His own account tells of how he refused to follow orders from NATO command to attack the Russians.&lt;ref name="Singer James Blunt 'prevented World War III'"/&gt;

[[Outpost Gunner]] was established on a high point in the Preševo Valley by Echo Battery 1/161 Field Artillery in an attempt to monitor and assist with peacekeeping efforts in the Russian Sector. Operating under the support of 2/3 Field Artillery, 1st Armored Division, the Battery was able to successfully deploy and continuously operate a Firefinder Radar which allowed the NATO forces to keep a closer watch on activities in the Sector and the Preševo Valley. Eventually a deal was struck whereby Russian forces operated as a unit of KFOR but not under the NATO command structure.&lt;ref name="bbc-airport"/&gt;

==NATO forces==
While not directly related to the hostilities, on March 12, 1999 the [[Czech Republic]], [[Hungary]], and [[Poland]] joined NATO by depositing instruments of accession in accordance with Article 10 of the [[North Atlantic Treaty]] at a ceremony in [[Independence, Missouri]].&lt;ref name="The United States, NATO, and a New Multilateral Relationship"/&gt; These nations did not participate directly in hostilities.

===Aviation===
A large element of the operation was the air forces of NATO, relying heavily on the US Air Force and Navy. The French Navy and Air Force operated the [[Super Etendard]] and the [[Mirage 2000]]. The [[Aeronautica Militare|Italian Air Force]] operated with 34 [[Panavia Tornado|Tornado]], 12 [[F-104]], 12 [[AMX International AMX|AMX]], 2 [[B-707]], the [[Marina Militare|Italian Navy]] operated with [[Harrier II]]. The British Royal Air Force operated the [[RAF Harrier II|Harrier GR7]] and [[RAF Tornado GR1|Tornado]] ground attack jets as well as an array of support aircraft. [[Belgian Air Force|Belgian]], [[Royal Danish Air Force|Danish]], [[Royal Netherlands Air Force|Dutch]], [[Royal Norwegian Air Force|Norwegian]] and [[Turkish Air Force|Turkish]] Air Forces operated F-16s. The Spanish Air Force deployed [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet|EF-18]]s and [[KC-130]]s. The [[Royal Canadian Air Force|Canadian Air Force]] deployed a total of 18 [[CF-18]]s, enabling them to be responsible for 10% of all bombs dropped in the operation. The fighters were armed with both guided and unguided "dumb" munitions, including the [[Paveway]] series of laser-guided bombs.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The bombing campaign marked the first time the German Air Force actively participated in combat operations since the end of World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Hyde-Price |first= Adrian |year= 2001 |chapter= Germany and the Kosovo War: Still a Civilian Power? |title= ''In Douglas Webber, ed., ''New Europe, New Germany, Old Foreign Policy?: German Foreign Policy Since Unification'', pp.&amp;#8239;19–34'' |location= London and Portland, OR |publisher= Frank Cass |isbn= 978-0-714-65172-9 }} See p.&amp;#8239;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0_utD3oQVdIC&amp;pg=PA19 19].&lt;/ref&gt;

However, NATO forces relied mostly upon the Americans and the proven effectiveness of its air power by using the F-16, [[F-15]], [[F-117]], [[F-14]], [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet|F/A-18]], [[EA-6B]], [[B-52]], [[KC-135]], [[KC-10]], [[Airborne early warning and control|AWACS]], and [[JSTARS]] from bases throughout Europe and from aircraft carriers in the region. The American [[B-2 Spirit]] stealth bomber also saw its first successful combat role in Operation Allied Force, all while striking from its home base in the continental United States.
[[File:U-238 DU ammunition.JPG|thumb|right|[[Depleted uranium]] ammunition, fired in FR Yugoslavia in 1999.]]

Even with this air power, noted a RAND Corporation study, "NATO never fully succeeded in neutralising the enemy's radar-guided SAM threat".&lt;ref&gt;Lambeth, 2001, p.  xvi&lt;/ref&gt;

===Space===
Operation Allied Force incorporated the first large-scale use of satellites as a direct method of weapon guidance. The collective bombing was the first combat use of the Joint Direct Attack Munition [[JDAM]] kit, which uses an inertial-guidance and [[GPS]]-guided tail fin to increase the accuracy of conventional gravity munitions up to 95%. The JDAM kits were outfitted on the [[B-2]]s. The [[AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon]] (JSOW) had been previously used in [[Operation Southern Watch]] earlier in 1999.

===Naval===
NATO naval forces operated in the Adriatic Sea. The [[Royal Navy]] sent a substantial task force that included the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Invincible|R05|6}}, which operated [[BAE Sea Harrier|Sea Harrier FA2]] fighter jets. The RN also deployed [[destroyer]]s and [[frigate]]s, and the [[Royal Fleet Auxiliary]] (RFA) provided support vessels, including the aviation training/primary casualty receiving ship {{ship|RFA|Argus|A135|6}}. It was the first time the RN used cruise missiles in combat, operated from the nuclear fleet submarine {{HMS|Splendid|S106|6}}.
The [[Italian Navy]] provided a naval task force that included the aircraft carrier {{ship|Italian aircraft carrier|Giuseppe Garibaldi|551|2}}, a frigate ({{ship|Italian frigate|Maestrale|F570|2}}) and a submarine ({{sclass-|Sauro|submarine|4}}).
The [[United States Navy]] provided a naval task force that included the aircraft carrier USS ''Theodore Roosevelt'', {{USS|Vella Gulf|CG-72|6}}, and the amphibious assault ship {{USS|Kearsarge|LHD-3|6}}. The [[French Navy]] provided the aircraft carrier {{ship|French aircraft carrier|Foch|R99|2}} and escorts. The [[German Navy]] deployed the frigate [[German frigate Rheinland-Pfalz (F209)|''Rheinland-Pfalz'']] and ''Oker'', an {{sclass-|Oste|fleet service ship|1}}, in the naval operations. The [[Netherlands]] send the submarine {{HNLMS|Dolfijn|1990|6}} to upheld trade embargoes off the coast of Yugoslavia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sail.nl/schepen/marineschepen/onderzeeboten|title=Onderzeeboten|website=www.sail.nl|language=nl-NL|access-date=December 17, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330012330/https://sail.nl/schepen/marineschepen/onderzeeboten|archive-date=March 30, 2018|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Army===

NATO ground forces included a U.S. battalion from the [[505th Parachute Infantry Regiment]], [[82nd Airborne Division]]. The unit was deployed in March 1999 to Albania in support of the bombing campaign where the battalion secured the [[Tirana]] airfield, Apache helicopter refueling sites, established a forward-operating base to prepare for [[Multiple Launch Rocket System]] (MLRS) strikes and offensive ground operations, and deployed a small team with an [[AN/TPQ-36 Firefinder radar]] system to the Albania/Kosovo border where it acquired targets for NATO air strikes. Immediately after the bombing campaign, the battalion was refitted back at Tirana airfield and issued orders to move into Kosovo as the initial entry force in support of [[Operation Joint Guardian]].
[[Task Force Hawk]] was also deployed.

[[Human Rights Watch]] concluded "that as few as 489 and as many as 528 Yugoslav civilians were killed in the ninety separate incidents in Operation Allied Force". Refugees were among the victims. Between 278 and 317 of the deaths, nearly 60 percent of the total number, were in Kosovo. In Serbia, 201 civilians were killed (five in Vojvodina) and eight died in Montenegro. Almost two thirds (303 to 352) of the total registered civilian deaths occurred in twelve incidents where ten or more civilian deaths were confirmed.&lt;ref name="hrw"/&gt;
 
According to one Serbian claim, NATO tactics sometimes included second post strikes in populated areas, with the aim of destroying rescue and medical teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/naslovna/reportaze/aktuelno.293.html:656631-Spasilac-kome-je-NATO-spalio-noge|title=Spasilac kome je NATO spalio noge|website=www.novosti.rs|access-date=March 25, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170324153834/http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/naslovna/reportaze/aktuelno.293.html:656631-Spasilac-kome-je-NATO-spalio-noge|archive-date=March 24, 2017|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military casualties===
Military casualties on the NATO side were limited. According to official reports, the alliance suffered no fatalities from combat operations. However, on May 5, an American AH-64 Apache crashed and exploded during a night-time mission in Albania.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"/&gt;&lt;ref name="twodie"/&gt; The Yugoslavs claimed they shot it down, but NATO claimed it crashed due to a technical malfunction.

Operation Allied Force inflicted less damage on the Yugoslav military than originally thought due to the use of [[camouflage]]. Other misdirection techniques were used to disguise military targets. It was only in the later stages of the campaign that strategic targets such as bridges and buildings were attacked in any systematic way, causing significant disruption and economic damage. This stage of the campaign led to controversial incidents, most notably the bombing of the People's Republic of China embassy in Belgrade where three Chinese reporters were killed and twenty injured, which NATO claimed was a mistake.&lt;ref name="Final Report to the Prosecutor by the Committee Established to Review the NATO Bombing Campaign Against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia"/&gt;

===Damage and economic loss===
[[File:Večna vatra.jpg|thumb|[[Eternal flame (Belgrade)|Eternal flame]] in [[Belgrade]], memorial to the military and civilian victims of the NATO bombing]]
In April 1999, during the NATO bombing, officials in Yugoslavia said the damage from the bombing campaign has cost around $100 billion up to that time.&lt;ref name="Nato hits Milosevic HQ"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/324708.stm | title=Nato hits Milosevic HQ | publisher=BBC News | date=April 21, 1999 | accessdate=September 20, 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018070305/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/324708.stm | archive-date=October 18, 2015 | dead-url=no | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, a year after the bombing ended, [[G17 Plus|Group 17]] published a survey dealing with damage and economic restoration. The report concluded that direct damage from the bombing totalled $3.8 billion, not including Kosovo, of which only 5% had been repaired at that time.&lt;ref name="Dinkic"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://freeserb.home.xs4all.nl/interviews/2000/e-dinkic09072000.html | title=I would never join the government alone without my colleagues | publisher=Free Serbia | date=July 9, 2000 | accessdate=September 18, 2015 | author=Dinkic, Mladjan | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018070307/http://freeserb.home.xs4all.nl/interviews/2000/e-dinkic09072000.html | archive-date=October 18, 2015 | dead-url=no | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, a group of economists from the G17 Plus party estimated the total economic losses resulting from the bombing were about $29.6 billion.&lt;ref name="B92 7yearson"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics.php?yyyy=2006&amp;mm=06&amp;dd=09&amp;nav_id=35250 | title=Seven years since end of NATO bombing | publisher=B92 | date=June 9, 2006 | accessdate=September 21, 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926062106/http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics.php?yyyy=2006&amp;mm=06&amp;dd=09&amp;nav_id=35250 | archive-date=September 26, 2015 | dead-url=no | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This figure included indirect economic damage, loss of [[human capital]], and loss of [[Gross domestic product|GDP]].{{citation needed|reason=B92 does not say what was included|date=September 2015}}

===Political outcome===
{{refimprove section|date=June 2015}}
When NATO agreed Kosovo would be politically supervised by the United Nations, and that there would be no independence referendum for three years, the Yugoslav government agreed to withdraw its forces from Kosovo, under strong diplomatic pressure from Russia, and the bombing was suspended on June 10. The war ended June 11, and Russian paratroopers seized [[Slatina airport]] to become the first peacekeeping force in the war zone.&lt;ref name="First planes land at Pristina airport"/&gt;
As British troops were still massed on the Macedonian border, planning to enter Kosovo at 5:00&amp;nbsp;am, the Serbs were hailing the Russian arrival as proof the war was a UN operation, not a NATO operation.
After hostilities ended, on June 12 the U.S. Army's 82nd Airborne, 2–505th Parachute Infantry Regiment entered war-torn Kosovo as part of Operation Joint Guardian.

Yugoslav President Milošević survived the conflict and declared its outcome a major victory for Yugoslavia. He was, however, indicted for war crimes by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] along with a number of other senior Yugoslav political and military figures. His indictment led to Yugoslavia as a whole being treated as a pariah by much of the international community because Milošević was subject to arrest if he left Yugoslavia. The country's economy was badly affected by the conflict, and in addition to electoral fraud, this was a factor in [[Overthrow of Slobodan Milošević|the overthrow of Milošević]].

Thousands were killed during the conflict, and hundreds of thousands more fled from the province to other parts of the country and to the surrounding countries. Most of the Albanian refugees returned home within a few weeks or months. However, much of the non-Albanian population again fled to other parts of Serbia or to protected enclaves within Kosovo following the operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Abuses against Serbs and Roma in the new Kosovo|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/kosov2/|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]|date=August 1999|access-date=December 4, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902070934/http://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/kosov2/|archive-date=September 2, 2012|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pristina Serbs prepare for exodus|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/jun/10/2|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=June 10, 1999|access-date=December 15, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230002921/https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/jun/10/2|archive-date=December 30, 2016|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Serbs Follow Yugoslav Forces Out of Kosovo in Reverse Exodus|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/jun/13/news/mn-46216|publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]''|date=June 13, 1999|access-date=October 5, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151005214554/http://articles.latimes.com/1999/jun/13/news/mn-46216|archive-date=October 5, 2015|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: EXODUS; As NATO Pours In, Fearful Serbs Pour Out|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/14/world/crisis-in-the-balkans-exodus-as-nato-pours-in-fearful-serbs-pour-out.html|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=June 14, 1999|access-date=February 11, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160724011720/http://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/14/world/crisis-in-the-balkans-exodus-as-nato-pours-in-fearful-serbs-pour-out.html|archive-date=July 24, 2016|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NATO Fears Serb Exodus After Killings|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1999/07/25/nato-fears-serb-exodus-after-killings/6b882bb4-e263-420f-9c05-1b42c9314841/|publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]''|date=July 25, 1999|access-date=September 5, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180525064009/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1999/07/25/nato-fears-serb-exodus-after-killings/6b882bb4-e263-420f-9c05-1b42c9314841/|archive-date=May 25, 2018|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albanian guerrilla activity spread into other parts of Serbia and to neighbouring Republic of Macedonia, but subsided in 2001.

In December 2002, [[Elizabeth II]] approved the awarding of the [[Battle Honour]] "Kosovo" to squadrons of the RAF that participated in the conflict. These were: Nos [[No. 1 Squadron RAF|1]], [[No. 7 Squadron RAF|7]], [[No. 8 Squadron RAF|8]], [[No. 9 Squadron RAF|9]], [[No. 14 Squadron RAF|14]], [[No. 23 Squadron RAF|23]], [[No. 31 Squadron RAF|31]], [[No. 51 Squadron RAF|51]], [[No. 101 Squadron RAF|101]], and [[No. 216 Squadron RAF|216]] squadrons. This was also extended to the Canadian squadrons deployed to the operation, [[No. 425 Squadron RCAF|425]] and [[No. 441 Squadron RCAF|441]].

Ten years after the operation, the Republic of Kosovo [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|declared independence]] with a new Republic of Kosovo government.

==Attitudes towards the campaign==
[[File:Kop mine mines.jpg|thumb|Warning sign about NATO [[cluster bombs]] near ski slopes at [[Kopaonik]].]]
{{Main|Legitimacy of the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia}}

===In favor of the campaign===
Those who were involved in the NATO airstrikes have stood by the decision to take such action. U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]]'s [[Secretary of Defense (United States)|Secretary of Defense]], [[William Cohen]], said, "The appalling accounts of mass killing in Kosovo and the pictures of refugees fleeing Serb oppression for their lives makes it clear that this is a fight for justice over genocide."&lt;ref name="defenselink"/&gt; On CBS' ''Face the Nation'' Cohen claimed, "We've now seen about 100,000 military-aged men missing. ... They may have been murdered."&lt;ref name="washingtonpost8"/&gt; Clinton, citing the same figure, spoke of "at least 100,000 (Kosovar Albanians) missing".&lt;ref name="clintonfoundation"/&gt; Later, Clinton said about Yugoslav elections, "they're going to have to come to grips with what Mr. Milošević ordered in Kosovo. ... They're going to have to decide whether they support his leadership or not; whether they think it's OK that all those tens of thousands of people were killed. ..."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1999"/&gt; In the same press conference, Clinton also said, "NATO stopped deliberate, systematic efforts at ethnic cleansing and genocide."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1999"/&gt; Clinton compared the events of Kosovo to [[the Holocaust]]. CNN reported, "Accusing Serbia of 'ethnic cleansing' in Kosovo similar to the genocide of Jews in World War II, an impassioned Clinton sought Tuesday to rally public support for his decision to send U.S. forces into combat against Yugoslavia, a prospect that seemed increasingly likely with the breakdown of a diplomatic peace effort."&lt;ref name="cnn9"/&gt; 

President Clinton's [[United States Department of State|Department of State]] also claimed Yugoslav troops had committed genocide. ''The New York Times'' reported, "the Administration said evidence of 'genocide' by Serbian forces was growing to include 'abhorrent and criminal action' on a vast scale. The language was the State Department's strongest up to that time in denouncing Yugoslav President Slobodan Milošević."&lt;ref name="genocide"/&gt; The Department of State also gave the highest estimate of dead Albanians. In May 1996, Defense Secretary William Cohen suggested that there might be up to 100,000 Albanian fatalities."&lt;ref name="erlanger"/&gt;

Five months after the conclusion of NATO bombing, when around one third of reported gravesites had been visited thus far, 2,108 bodies had been found, with an estimated total of between 5,000 and 12,000 at that time;&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; Yugoslav forces had systematically concealed grave sites and moved bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Judah|title= The Serbs|publisher= Yale University Press|isbn= 978-0-300-15826-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Serbia's Kosovo Cover-Up: Who Hid the Bodies?|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/serbia-s-kosovo-cover-up-who-hid-the-bodies|publisher=Balkan Insight|accessdate=June 10, 2015|quote=The Belgrade officials and policemen who took hundreds of murdered Albanians' corpses from Kosovo to Serbia and concealed them in mass graves have never been prosecuted in their home country.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527044033/http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/serbia-s-kosovo-cover-up-who-hid-the-bodies|archive-date=May 27, 2015|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States House of Representatives]] passed a [[concurrent resolution|non-binding resolution]] on March 11, 1999 by a vote of 219–191 conditionally approving of President Clinton's plan to commit 4,000 troops to the NATO peacekeeping mission.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; In late April, the House Appropriations Committee approved $13&amp;nbsp;billion in emergency spending to cover the cost of the air war, but a second non-binding resolution approving of the mission failed in the full House by a vote of 213–213.&lt;ref name="nytimes10"/&gt; The [[United States Senate|Senate]] had passed the second resolution in late March by a vote of 58–41.&lt;ref name="On the Concurrent Resolution (S.Con.Res. 21 )"/&gt;

===Criticism of the campaign===
There has also been criticism of the campaign.  The Clinton administration was accused of inflating the number of Kosovar Albanians killed by Serbs.&lt;ref name="washington"/&gt; [[Joseph Farah]] accused the coalition of exaggerating the casualty numbers to make a claim of potential [[genocide]] to justify the bombings.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

In an interview with Radio-Television Serbia journalist Danilo Mandic on April 25, 2006, [[Noam Chomsky]] claimed that [[Strobe Talbott]], the Deputy Secretary of State under President Clinton and the leading U.S. negotiator during the war, had written in his foreword to John Norris' 2005 book ''Collision Course: NATO, Russia, and Kosovo'' that "the real purpose of the war had nothing to do with concern for Kosovar Albanians", but rather "It was because Serbia was not carrying out the required social and economic reforms, meaning it was the last corner of Europe which had not subordinated itself to the US-run neoliberal programs, so therefore it had to be eliminated".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/20060425.htm On the NATO Bombing of Yugoslavia, Noam Chomsky interviewed by Danilo Mandic] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220200424/http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/20060425.htm |date=February 20, 2014 }} Chomsky.info, April 25, 2006, Accessed January 13, 2014.&lt;br /&gt;For the passage Chomsky presumably had in mind, see pp.&amp;#8239;xxii-iii of the introduction to Norris's book: "As nations throughout the region sought to reform their economies, mitigate ethnic tensions, and broaden civil society, Belgrade seemed to delight in continually moving in the opposite direction … It was Yugoslavia's resistance to the broader trends of political and economic reform—not the plight of Kosovar Albanians—that best explains NATO's war."&lt;/ref&gt; On May 31, 2006, [[J. Bradford DeLong|Brad DeLong]] rebutted Chomsky's allegation and quoted from elsewhere in the passage which Chomsky had cited,&lt;ref name=faaavag /&gt; "the Kosovo crisis was fueled by frustration with Milosevic and the legitimate fear that instability and conflict might spread further in the region" and also that "Only a decade of death, destruction, and Milosevic brinkmanship pushed NATO to act when the Rambouillet talks collapsed. Most of the leaders of NATO's major powers were proponents of 'third way' politics and headed socially progressive, economically centrist governments. None of these men were particularly hawkish, and Milosevic did not allow them the political breathing room to look past his abuses."&lt;ref name=faaavag&gt;[http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/05/on_the_nato_bom.html On the NATO Bombing of Yugoslavia...] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140115060201/http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/05/on_the_nato_bom.html |date=January 15, 2014 }}, Brad DeLong, May 31, 2006, Accessed January 13, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="collision"/&gt;

The [[United Nations Charter]] does not allow military interventions in other sovereign countries with few exceptions which, in general, need to be decided upon by the [[United Nations Security Council]]. The issue was brought before the UNSC by Russia, in a draft resolution which, inter-alia, would affirm "that such unilateral use of force constitutes a flagrant violation of the United Nations Charter". China, Namibia and Russia voted for the resolution, the other members against, thus it failed to pass.&lt;ref name="Security Council Rejects Demand for Cessation of Use of Force Against Federal Republic of Yugoslavia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dead link"/&gt;{{dead link|date=October 2016}}

Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Ariel Sharon]] criticised the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia as an act of "brutal interventionism" and said Israel was against "aggressive actions" and "hurting innocent people" and hoped "the sides will return to the negotiating table as soon as possible".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/fisk/ariel-sharon-by-robert-fisk-521809.html Ariel Sharon... by Robert Fisk] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926002449/http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/fisk/ariel-sharon-by-robert-fisk-521809.html |date=September 26, 2015 }} Friday January 6, 2006, ''The Independent''&lt;/ref&gt; However, later into the campaign, Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] expressed support for NATO's mission in the war and Israel provided medical assistance to 112 Kosovar Albanian refugees and housed them in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Trounson, Rebecca.

On April 29, 1999, Yugoslavia filed a complaint at the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ) at [[The Hague]] against ten NATO member countries (Belgium, Germany, France, United Kingdom, Italy, Canada, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, and the United States) and alleged that the military operation had violated Article 9 of the 1948 Genocide Convention and that Yugoslavia had jurisdiction to sue through Article 38, para. 5 of
Rules of Court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/114/7173.pdf International Court of Justice - 7173] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140115040939/http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/114/7173.pdf |date=January 15, 2014 }} Accessed January 13, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; On June 2, the ICJ ruled in an 8–4 vote that Yugoslavia had no such jurisdiction.&lt;ref name=nojurisdict&gt;[http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/amato1.htm Review of the ICJ Order of June 2, 1999 on the Illegality of Use of Force Case] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218054226/http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/amato1.htm |date=February 18, 2011 }} Anthony D'Amato:Leighton Professor of Law, Northwest University, June 2, 1999, Accessed January 13, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Four of the ten nations (the United States, France, Italy and Germany) had withdrawn entirely from the court's "optional clause." Because Yugoslavia filed its complaint only three days after accepting the terms of the court's optional clause, the ICJ ruled that there was no jurisdiction to sue either Britain or Spain, as the two nations had only agreed to submit to ICJ lawsuits if a suing party had filed their complaint a year or more after accepting the terms of the optional clause.&lt;ref name=nojurisdict /&gt; Despite objections that Yugoslavia had legal jurisdiction to sue Belgium, the Netherlands, Canada and Portugal,&lt;ref name=nojurisdict /&gt; the ICJ majority vote also determined that the NATO bombing was an instance of "humanitarian intervention" and thus did not violate Article 9 of the Genocide Convention.&lt;ref name=nojurisdict /&gt;

[[Amnesty International]] released a report which stated that NATO forces had deliberately targeted a civilian object ([[NATO bombing of the Radio Television of Serbia headquarters]]), and had bombed targets at which civilians were certain to be killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/news/no-justice-victims-nato-bombings-20090423|publisher=[[Amnesty International]]|date=April 23, 2009|title=No justice for the victims of NATO bombings|access-date=December 4, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217051002/http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/news/no-justice-victims-nato-bombings-20090423|archive-date=February 17, 2013|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/08/world/rights-group-says-nato-bombing-in-yugoslavia-violated-law.html|work=[[New York Times]]|title=Rights Group Says NATO Bombing in Yugoslavia Violated Law|author=Steven Erlanger|date=June 8, 2000|access-date=February 11, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223162203/http://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/08/world/rights-group-says-nato-bombing-in-yugoslavia-violated-law.html|archive-date=February 23, 2017|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report was rejected by NATO as "baseless and ill-founded".

'''''Palestrina''''' is an opera by the German composer [[Hans Pfitzner]], first performed in 1917. The composer referred to it as a ''Musikalische Legende'' (musical legend), and wrote the [[libretto]] himself, based on a legend about the [[Renaissance]] musician [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]], who saves the art of contrapuntal music ([[polyphony]]) for the Church in the sixteenth century, through his composition of the ''[[Missa Papae Marcelli]]''. The wider context is that of the European [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and the role of music in relation to it. The character of [[Charles Borromeo|Cardinal Borromeo]] is depicted, and a General Congress of the [[Council of Trent]] is the centrepiece of Act II.

The conductor of the premiere was [[Bruno Walter]]. On 16 February 1962, the day before he died, Walter ended his last letter with: ''"Despite all the dark experiences of today I am still confident that ''Palestrina'' will remain.  The work has all the elements of immortality"''.&lt;ref&gt;Liner notes to the Rafael Kubelik/Nicolai Gedda/Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau DG recording&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical appreciation==
Claire Taylor-Jay has discussed Pfitzner's depiction of the political relationship between Palestrina and the Council of Trent, in the light of several German "artist-operas" such as [[Paul Hindemith]]'s ''[[Mathis der Maler (opera)|Mathis der Maler]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Claire Taylor-Jay, ''The Artist-Operas of Pfitzner, Krenek, and Hindemith: Politics and the Ideology of the Artist'', Aldershot: Ashgate, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mosco Carner]] has written on Pfitzner's own expression of the role of spontaneous inspiration in composition, as expressed in ''Palestrina''.&lt;ref&gt;Mosco Carner, "Pfitzner v. Berg, or Inspiration v. Analysis".  ''The Musical Times'', '''118(1611)''', pp. 379-380 (May 1977).&lt;/ref&gt;  Several scholarly articles have delved into Pfitzner's musical and ideological conservatism, as expressed in this opera.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Steinberg (music critic)|Michael P.

==Performance history==
The work was first performed at the [[Prinzregententheater]], [[Munich]] on 12 June 1917. The title role was created by the tenor [[Karl Erb]].&lt;ref&gt;A photograph in Volume I of ''[[The Record of Singing]]'' shows the [[East Prussian]] tenor [[Felix Senius]] (1868-1913) in the title-role Palestrina. The first public performance was indeed in 1917, yet Senius died in 1913, so Erb was the first to perform the part. M. Scott, ''The Record of Singing'', I (Duckworth, London 1977), pp. 204-205, Fig 179.&lt;/ref&gt; Pfitzner wrote in his copy of the score:&lt;blockquote&gt;
'Ich erachte es als einen der seltenen Glücksumstände in meinem Künstlerleben, dass mein grösstes Werk bei seinem ersten Erscheinen in der Welt für seine Haupt- und Titelrolle einen solch idealen Vertreter gefunden hat, wie Sie, lieber Karl Erb es sind. Ihr Name ist mit diesem Stück deutscher Kunst fur alle Zeiten ruhmreich verbunden.'&lt;ref&gt;M. Müller-Gögler, ''Karl Erb: Das Leben eines Sängers'' (Franz Huber, Offenburg c.1948), 81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
''(I consider it as one of the very occasional fortunate circumstances in my life as an artist, that my greatest work at its first appearance in the world has found for its chief and title role such an ideal interpreter as you, dear Karl Erb, are. Your name is for all time praiseworthily united with this piece of German art.)''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the original performances, [[Maria Ivogün]] (later wife of Karl Erb) sang the role of Ighino, [[Fritz Feinhals]] and Dr [[Emil Schipper]] sang Borromeo, [[Willi Birrenkoven]] was Budoja,&lt;ref&gt;L. Riemens, Schumann and Brahms Lieder on record (HMV, Hayes 1983), 8.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bruno Walter]] conducted. More recently the role of Palestrina has been played by [[Julius Patzak]], a successor to the style of tenor singing developed or maintained by Karl Erb.

''Palestrina'' was Pfitzner's most successful opera and is still regularly performed in German-speaking countries, though revivals abroad are rarer.  The first UK performance was a semi-professional production in 1981 at Abbey Opera, and the first fully professional UK production was at the [[Royal Opera House]], [[Covent Garden]], in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Guy Rickards, "First Performances: Pfitzner's 'Palestrina'".  ''Tempo'' (New Ser.), '''201''', pp. 35-37 (July 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==
[[Image:Carlo Borromeo.jpg|thumb|250px|right| The future Saint Charles Borromeo]]

===Act One===
''A room in Palestrina's house, Rome, around 1560''&lt;br /&gt;
(Scene 1) Palestrina's student Silla is trying over a secular lyric he has written, and planning to make a new life in [[Florence]], where he hopes to find his own voice as a singer and song-writer. [[Rome]] clings to its old-fashioned [[polyphony]] as closely as it defends its religion. (2) Ighino and Silla discuss their singing: Silla thinks a singer should stand alone, but Ighino thinks that real strength lies subordinating the individual self to the larger complex idea. He is sad because his father has lost heart: fame made others jealous, his marriage led the Pope to dismiss him, and his wife died knowing this. Since then Palestrina has written nothing. Silla sings to him his new song. (3) [[Charles Borromeo|Cardinal Borromeo]] is visiting Palestrina to explain that, because of growing secularism, the Pope plans to banish polyphony from [[Mass (Roman Rite)|the Mass]] and other offices, to burn the polyphonic masterpieces, and to revert entirely to the [[Gregorian chant]]. [[Emperor Ferdinand I]] hopes that a new polyphonic Mass can be written which will appease his fears. Borromeo wants Palestrina to undertake this, but, lacking the spirit, he refuses, and Borromeo leaves in anger. (4) Palestrina ponders his loss of faith and the weakness of love. In his despair, spirits of the great music-masters of previous ages appear and surround him. (5) The spirits tell Palestrina he belongs to their elect and must fulfil the task. He protests that in the modern consciousness ("Bewusstseins"), art cannot thrive. The spirits reply that this is his earthly mission: he must bring the light to his generation. They vanish. (6) In the darkness of his room angels begin to appear, singing the Mass, and his dead wife's spirit approaches. Not seeing them, Palestrina feels a surge of joy as the walls and ceiling open up to celestial light full of glory and angels, who sing the [[Gloria in Excelsis Deo|Gloria]]. In a creative transport Palestrina's pen is inspired, and as it all fades, he sinks exhausted to sleep, surrounded by sheets of music strewn all around. (7) Silla and Ighino enter while he sleeps, and find the music: it is a complete Mass, written in one night. Ighino rejoices, but Silla is sceptical.

===Act Two===
''The Great Hall in Cardinal Madruscht's Palace in [[Trento|Trent]]''&lt;br /&gt;
(Scene 1) Bishop Severolus and the Papal legate Novagerio prepare the hall for the final General Congress of the Council of Trent. The Cardinal of Lorraine (who has reached compromise with the Pope) and Count Luna, representative of the King of Spain (favouring Protestantism) must be seated equally and without precedence. (2) Cardinal Madruscht and Novagerio discuss the coming decision while awaiting the delegates, and they greet Borromeo. (3) While delegates arrive, Borromeo and Novagerio talk politics: Emperor Ferdinand and his son Maximilian plan to have dominion of the Catholic world (including Germany) from the throne of Spain, in union with the [[King of the Romans|Kingship of Rome]], which is offered to [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian]] even though he is secretly inclined to [[Lutheranism]]. But the Pope will preserve dogma by the interpretation of imperial decrees. Borromeo explains that Palestrina has refused the commission for the new polyphonic Mass. Novagerio insists that Palestrina must be forced into subordination, or be crushed. (4) Cardinal Madruscht deplores Lorraine's compromise with Rome, and urges the Cardinal of [[Prague]] to stand fast for doctrinal Reforms. The Spanish arrive and look scornfully at the Italians and the Bishop of [[Budoja]]. Morone, the other papal legate, arrives and the Council begins. (5) Morone opens the meeting hoping for unity of purpose between Emperor, Pope and Princes. The question of the polyphonic Mass is raised, but Borromeo tells them it is unfinished. The issue of the vernacular Mass and [[breviary]] arises, but then Count Luna and Cardinal of Lorraine dispute precedence, and Budoja disrupts proceedings to deflect Count Luna's case. Chaos breaks out: the meeting is adjourned till the afternoon, when everything must be resolved. The delegates disperse. (6) Lorraine protests to Morone that he should have precedence, but Morone is angry that he has provoked Count Luna. Novagerio appeals to Lorraine to consider the interests of the Pope. Badoja makes himself objectionable. (7) The Spanish servants, and a group of German and Italian servants, shout abuse at each other and a battle with daggers ensues. Cardinal Madruscht appears with a troop of soldiers, and commands them to shoot to kill. A volley is fired, and many fall dead and wounded: all the survivors are seized and carried off for torture.

===Act Three===
''Palestrina's house in Rome, as in the First Act.''&lt;br /&gt;
(Scene 1) Palestrina, aged and very tired, waits in his room with Ighino and some choristers. Borromeo imprisoned him for refusing the commission, but Ighino handed the music of the Mass over to save his father from the hangman. Now it is being sung before the Pope. Ighino begs his father to reawaken to life and to embrace the son who loves him. Suddenly the voices of singers from the Papal chapel are heard from the street singing 'Evviva Palestrina, the Saviour of Music!' (2) Papal singers come into the room, saying how greatly the Mass has pleased everyone. [[Pope Pius IV]] himself enters with eight Cardinals (including Borromeo), Palestrina kneels, and the Pope asks him to return and lead the [[Sistine Choir]] until the end of his days. Then they leave, but Borromeo remains and prostrates himself in tears, begging Palestrina's forgiveness. Palestrina raises him up, kisses him on the cheek and embraces him, for both are shattered vessels that must be filled with the breath of love. Borromeo, much chastened, departs: Ighino embraces his father, and asks if he will now be happy. Silla has gone to Florence, but Ighino will remain: in joy the boy rushes out into the street. Palestrina looks at his wife's portrait, and with an expression of devotion to God sits at the organ and begins to play.

On Christmas Day 1950, four Scottish students from the [[University of Glasgow]] ([[Ian Hamilton (lawyer)|Ian Hamilton]], [[Gavin Vernon]], Kay Matheson and Alan Stuart) removed the [[Stone of Scone]] from [[Westminster Abbey]] in [[London]] and took the Stone back to Scotland.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1457731/Gavin-Vernon.html |title=Gavin Vernon |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=26 March 2004 |accessdate=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scotsman1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/defining-our-destiny-1-519098 |title=Defining our destiny |newspaper=[[The Scotsman]] |date=29 March 2004 |accessdate=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The students were members of the [[Scottish Covenant Association]], a group that supported [[Scottish Home Rule|home rule]] for Scotland.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt; In 2008 the incident was made into a film called ''[[Stone of Destiny (film)|Stone of Destiny]]''.&lt;ref name="scotsman2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/film-review-stone-of-destiny-1-1438029 |title=Film review: Stone of Destiny |newspaper=The Scotsman |date=3 October 2008 |accessdate=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Stone of Scone, the ancient Stone upon which Scottish monarchs had been crowned, was taken from [[Scone, Perthshire|Scone]] near [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], Scotland by King [[Edward I of England]] (Longshanks) in 1296 during the struggles against English invasion, which historians call the [[Scottish Wars of Independence]] as a [[looting|spoil of war]], kept in Westminster Abbey in London and fitted into [[King Edward's Chair]].&lt;ref name="destiny"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edinburghcastle.gov.uk/highlights-stone-of-destiny |title=Stone of Destiny |publisher=[[Historic Scotland]] |year=2012 |accessdate=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequent [[England|English]] and then [[United Kingdom|British]] monarchs were crowned sitting upon the chair and Stone.&lt;ref name="destiny" /&gt;  At the time, the Stone was viewed as a symbol of Scottish nationhood; by removing the Stone to London, Edward I was declaring himself 'King of the Scots'.&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt;

In 1950, Ian Hamilton, a student at the [[University of Glasgow]], approached Gavin Vernon with a plan to remove the Stone of Scone from Westminster Abbey in London and return it to Scotland.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  The plan was funded by a [[Glasgow]] businessman, Robert Gray, who was a councillor on the [[Glasgow Corporation Tramways|Glasgow Corporation]].&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt;&lt;ref name="scotsman3"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/scottish-news/top-stories/first-stone-raider-meets-his-final-destiny-1-519088 |title=First Stone raider meets his final destiny |newspaper=The Scotsman |date=29 March 2004 |accessdate=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vernon agreed to participate in the plan along with Kay Matheson and Alan Stuart who were also students in Glasgow.&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt;  By removing the Stone the group hoped to promote their cause for Scottish [[devolution in the United Kingdom|devolution]] and to reawaken a sense of national identity amongst the Scottish people.&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hamilton" /&gt;

==Removal of the Stone of Scone==
In December 1950, a few days before Christmas, the four students from Glasgow drove to London in two [[Ford Anglia]]s, a journey which took them eighteen hours.&lt;ref name="herald"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/gavin-vernon-engineer-who-helped-return-the-stone-of-destiny-to-scotland-1.89326 |title=Gavin Vernon Engineer who helped return the Stone of Destiny to Scotland |newspaper=[[The Herald (Glasgow)]] |date=1 April 2004 |accessdate=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On arrival in London they had a brief meeting at [[Lyons Corner House]] and decided to make an immediate attempt at removing the Stone from the Abbey.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  Later that day Ian Hamilton hid under a trolley in the Abbey, but was caught by a nightwatchman after the Abbey doors had been closed, briefly questioned, and then let go.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;

The following day Vernon and Stuart returned to Westminster Abbey and learned some information on the watchmen's shifts.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  In the middle of that night, the three men entered a works yard and gained entrance into [[Poet's Corner]].&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  Reaching the Chapel containing the tomb of [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] and [[King Edward's Chair]], they pulled down the barrier.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  On removing the Stone from under the Chair, it crashed to the floor and broke into two pieces&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  The three men, using Hamilton's coat, dragged the larger piece down the high altar steps, then Hamilton took the smaller piece to one of the cars waiting outside.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;

Ian Hamilton placed the small piece of Stone in the boot of the car and got into the passenger seat.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  As he did this, Kay Matheson noticed a policeman in the gaslight; Hamilton and Matheson immediately fell into a lovers' clinch.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  The policeman stopped and the three proceeded to have a conversation even though it was 5 A.M.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  Having shared some jokes and a cigarette Matheson and Hamilton drove off to [[Victoria, London|Victoria]], Hamilton getting out on the way to walk back to the Abbey.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;

On his arrival there was no sign of Vernon and Stuart, so he proceeded to drag the large piece of stone to the car himself.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  As he was driving away he saw Vernon and Stuart walking towards him.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;

The stone was so heavy that the springs on the car were sagging, so Vernon, fearing the alarm had been raised, made his way to [[Rugby, Warwickshire]].&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  Hamilton and Stuart drove to [[Kent]], hid the large piece of stone in a field and made their way back to Scotland.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  Matheson left her car, containing the small piece of the Stone, with a friend in the Midlands, and like Vernon made her way back to Scotland by train.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  On discovering that the Stone was missing, the authorities closed the border between Scotland and England for the first time in four hundred years.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;

A fortnight later Hamilton and some friends – including John Josselyn, whose 21st great grandfather was, ironically, Edward I &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trees.ancestry.co.uk/tree/25017403/person/1650035497 | title=John Rodney Josselyn - Overview - Ancestry.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; – recovered the two pieces of stone and brought them to Glasgow.&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt;  They hired a stonemason, Baillie [[Robert Gray (Scottish politician)|Robert Gray]], to mend the Stone.&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt;  Gray placed a brass rod inside the Stone containing a piece of paper.&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt;  To this day, nobody knows what was written on the piece of paper.&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt;

In April 1951 the police received a tip-off and the Stone was found on the site of the High Altar at [[Arbroath Abbey]] where in 1320 the assertion of Scottish nationhood was made in the [[Declaration of Arbroath]].&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  The Stone was returned to Westminster Abbey in February 1952.&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt;

The police conducted an investigation with specific focus on Scotland.&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt;  All four of the group were interviewed and all later confessed to their involvement with the exception of Ian Hamilton.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  The authorities decided not to prosecute as the potential for the event to become politicised was far too great.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  [[Hartley Shawcross, Baron Shawcross|Sir Hartley Shawcross]], addressing Parliament on the matter, said: "The clandestine removal of the Stone from Westminster Abbey, and the manifest disregard for the sanctity of the abbey, were vulgar acts of vandalism which have caused great distress and offence both in England and Scotland.  I do not think, however, that the public interest required criminal proceedings to be taken."&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/319077062/13B6B8FC20016577E13/1?accountid=15842 |title=Gavin Vernon |newspaper=[[The Times]] |date=2 April 2004 |accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications==
To understand the implications of the raid, one must understand the political landscape in the United Kingdom just after the end of the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref name="hamilton"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/3743946/Ian-Hamilton-on-Stone-of-Destiny-I-felt-I-was-holding-Scotlands-soul.html |title=Ian Hamilton on Stone of Destiny: I felt I was holding Scotland's soul |newspaper=[[Daily Mail]] |date=14 December 2008 |accessdate=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The United Kingdom was a unified nation and even in an era of post-war austerity, devolution was not on the political agenda.&lt;ref name="hamilton" /&gt;  At the time, the [[Scottish National Party]] had 0.7% of the vote, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] had withdrawn its commitment to devolution, and the [[Unionist Party (Scotland)|Conservative Party]] was at the high point of its popularity in Scotland.&lt;ref name="hamilton" /&gt;  The raid was completely unexpected and gave the cause of Scottish devolution and nationalism a brief sense of prominence in the public conscience throughout the United Kingdom and beyond.&lt;ref name="scotsman1" /&gt;

The students became notorious for the daring heist and in Scotland they achieved nigh-on hero status, while in contrast the English were somewhat bewildered.&lt;ref name="hamilton" /&gt;  The heist and the students became synonymous with the devolution and [[Scottish National Party|nationalist]] political movements in Scotland from 1950 onwards.&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt;

Over time the incident encouraged a belief in change, throwing open to scrutiny the Union, which had existed since [[Acts of union 1707|1707]].&lt;ref name="scotsman1" /&gt;   Long before the Stone was officially returned to Scotland in 1996 and the Scottish people voted for devolution in 1997, the removal of the Stone of Scone in 1950 contributed to those events.&lt;ref name="scotsman1" /&gt;

== Portrayals in popular culture ==

The removal of the stone was the subject of a contemporary [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]] song by Donald MacIntyre, "''[[Òran na Cloiche]]''" ("The Song of the Stone"). Its return to England was the subject of an accompanying [[lament]], "''Nuair a Chaidh a' Chlach a Thilleadh''" ("When the Stone Was Returned").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=MacMillan |first=Somerled |date=1968 |title=Sporan Dhòmhnaill - Gaelic Poems and Songs by the late Donald Macintyre, the Paisley Bard |trans-title=Donald's Purse - Gaelic Poems and Songs by the late Donald Macintyre |url= |language=gd |location=Edinburgh |publisher=Scottish Academic Press |isbn= |page=xxvi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Hamilton's book, ''The Taking of the Stone of Destiny'', was made into a film entitled ''[[Stone of Destiny (film)|Stone of Destiny]]''. The film depicted Hamilton (played by [[Charlie Cox]]) as the protagonist leading a team of students to reclaim the [[Stone of Scone]]. Additionally, Hamilton had a small, [[cameo role]].&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;"[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1037156/ Stone of Destiny]," ''[[The Internet Movie Database]]''. ''(Retrieved 2010-01-09.)''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[BBC Alba]] released an hourlong bilingual (Scottish Gaelic and English) dramatization of Kay Matheson's (played by [[Kathleen MacInnes]]) interrogation by the police. In this version Matheson pretends not to speak English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNJgudcRi64|title=AN CEASNACHADH - Interrogation of a Highland Lass|first=|last=Gaelic Filmz|date=19 February 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Highlander: The Series]]'' the episode "The Stone of Scone" (1997) reveals the Stone of Destiny was swiped and duplicated by immortals: the Scotsman [[Duncan MacLeod]] and his friends [[Hugh Fitzcairn]] and [[Amanda (Highlander)|Amanda Darieux]]. A cover story involving students was concocted to conceal their involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/highlander/the-stone-of-scone-55212/|title=Highlander: The Stone of Scone|first=|last=TV.com|website=TV.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Setting up to fail''' is a phrase denoting a [[no-win situation]] designed in such a way that the person in the situation cannot succeed at the task which they have been assigned. It is considered a form of [[workplace bullying]].&lt;ref&gt;Stambor, Zak.[https://www.apa.org/monitor/julaug06/apathy.aspx "Bullying stems from fear, apathy."] ''APA.com''. Originally published in ''Monitor on Psychology''. American Psychological Association. July/August 2006, vol. 37, no. 7. p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also situations in which an organization or project is set up to fail.&lt;ref name=skeptic/&gt;&lt;ref name = "AusFent"/&gt; and where individuals set themselves up to fail.&lt;ref name=boyatzis/&gt;

The first known documented use of "set up to fail" was in 1969 in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;
[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8-zQAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22set+up+to+fail%22&amp;dq=%22set+up+to+fail%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4f4BVY6nKsTiU-CzgOAO&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBw Economic Opportunity Amendments of 1969: Hearings, Ninety-first Congress, First Session, on H.R. 513]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the workplace==
Setting up to fail is a well-established [[workplace bullying]] tactic.&lt;ref&gt;Peyton, PR. ''Dignity at Work: Eliminate Bullying and Create a Positive Working Environment'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rayner C, Hoel H A. "Summary Review of Literature Relating to Workplace Bullying", ''Journal of Community &amp; Applied Social Psychology'', volume 7, issue 3, pages 181–191, June 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Randle J Workplace Bullying in the NHS (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; One technique is to overload with work, while denying the victim the authority to handle it and over-interfering;&lt;ref&gt;J-F Manzoni/J-L Barsoux, ''The Set-up-to-fail Syndrome'' (2007) p. 5 and p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; another is the withholding of  the information necessary to succeed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tim Field]], ''Bully in Sight'', Success Unlimited (1996) pp. 63–7 {{ISBN|978-0-9529121-0-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a person puts another individual (usually a subordinate) in a [[Occupational stress|stressful]] situation in which failure is almost certain, this may be an aspect of [[bullying]] wherein the outcome can then be used to [[discrediting tactic|discredit]] and [[victim blaming|blame the victim]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Tim Field]], ''Bully in Sight'' Success Unlimited (1996) p. 43 {{ISBN|978-0-9529121-0-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, this may involve the bully covertly sabotaging and [[social undermining|undermining]] an objective that may have otherwise been achievable. This type of bullying may be the result of the [[Projective identification|projection]] of the bully's own feelings of inadequacy onto the victim.&lt;ref&gt;S. White, ''An Introduction to the Psychodynamics of Workplace Bullying'' (2013) pp. 31–2&lt;/ref&gt;

There can be cases where an employee is set up to fail because the stated goals of the task are considered harmful to the organization; an internal investigation is one example. Institutions may protect themselves by "going through the motions" of a sham investigation in which the findings conveniently fail to find any evidence of wrongdoing by the authorities involved with setting up the investigation.

==Bigotry==
Minorities seeking acceptance into the mainstream are often concerned about being set up to fail in the face of covert institutional [[racism]]&amp;nbsp;– something feared for example by the first black US [[naval officer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Stillwell/Colin L Powell, ''The Golden Thirteen'' (2003) p. 98 and p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

==Families==
Parents may have excessive expectations for their children's academic success for instance, thus setting them up for failure by hoping they may solve their parents' problems for them.&lt;ref&gt;Debra Wesselmann, ''The Whole Parent'' (2003) p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; The result may be to create a self-destructive syndrome in the child&amp;nbsp;– the so-called [[Child (archetype)|Divine Child]] complex.&lt;ref&gt;Polly Young-Eisendrath, ''Women and Desire'' (London 2000) p. 107 and p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

==Therapy==
Therapy may be sabotaged by either the client or the provider. The client, both hoping for and fearing the possibility of real help, may impose conditions on the therapy that all but guarantee its failure.&lt;ref&gt;Neville Symington, ''Narcissism'' (2003) p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the helper, needing to keep clients in a state of dependency,&lt;ref&gt;P. Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (1990) p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; may be threatened by the prospect of success/closure, and undermine the therapy accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''Games People Play'' (1966) pp. 126–7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Setting oneself up to fail&lt;!--This section is linked from [[Impostor syndrome]]: do not rename without including an anchor to previous name ([[MOS:HEAD]])--&gt;==
A person setting themselves up for failure may do so because they have a [[fear of failure]], an unrealistic assessment of their own abilities, or because they are naive and uninformed regarding the abilities necessary to succeed. In some cases, an individual has an unjustified expectation that they will fail, a self-reinforcing negative spiral,&lt;ref name=boyatzis&gt;[[R. E. Boyatzis]]/A. McKee, ''Resonant Leadership'' (2005) p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; or failure neurosis&lt;ref name=enotes&gt;{{cite web|last=De Mijolla|first=Alain|title=Failure neurosis|url=https://www.enotes.com/failure-neurosis-reference/failure-neurosis|publisher=Enotes|accessdate=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– perhaps driven by a sense of guilt,&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 506&lt;/ref&gt; or by the [[Repetition compulsion|compulsion to repeat]] self-destructive behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;S, Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) pp. 292–3&lt;/ref&gt;

In 589 BC, [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] laid siege to [[Jerusalem]], culminating in the destruction of the city and [[Temple in Jerusalem|its temple]] in the summer of 587 or 586 BC.

==Siege==
Following the [[Siege of Jerusalem (597 BC)|siege of 597 BC]], the Neo-[[Babylonia]]n king Nebuchadnezzar installed [[Zedekiah]] as tributary [[king of Judah]], at the age of 21. However, Zedekiah revolted against Babylon, and entered into an alliance with Pharaoh [[Apries|Hophra]], the king of [[Late Period of ancient Egypt|Egypt]]. Nebuchadnezzar responded by invading [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Kings|25:1|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; and began a siege of [[Jerusalem]] in December 589 BC. During this siege, the duration of which was either 18 or 30 months,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Malamat|first1=Abraham|title=The Last Kings of Judah and the Fall of Jerusalem: An Historical – Chronological Study|journal=Israel Exploration Journal|date=1968|volume=18|issue=3|pages=137–56|jstor=27925138|quote=The discrepancy between the length of the siege according to the regnal years of Zedekiah (years 9–11), on the one hand, and its length according to Jehoiachin's exile (years 9–12), on the other, can be cancelled out only by supposing the former to have been reckoned on a Tishri basis, and the latter on a Nisan basis. The difference of one year between the two is accounted for by the fact that the termination of the siege fell in the summer, between Nisan and Tishri, already in the 12th year according to the reckoning in Ezekiel, but still in Zedekiah's 11th year which was to end only in Tishri.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Bible describes the city as enduring horrible deprivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Kings|25:3|HE}}; {{bibleverse||Lamentations|4:4|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Lamentations|5|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Lamentations|9|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completion of the eleventh year of Zedekiah's reign,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Jeremiah|1:3|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nebuchadnezzar broke through Jerusalem's walls, conquering the city. Zedekiah and his followers attempted to escape but were captured on the plains of [[Jericho]] and taken to [[Riblah]]. There, after seeing his sons killed, Zedekiah was blinded, bound, and taken captive to Babylon,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Kings|25:1–7|HE}}; {{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|36:12|HE}}; {{bibleverse||Jeremiah|32:4–5|HE}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Jeremiah|34:2–3|HE}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Jeremiah|39:1–7|HE}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Jeremiah|52:4–11|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he remained a prisoner until his death.

After the fall of Jerusalem, the Babylonian general, Nebuzaraddan, was sent to complete its destruction. Jerusalem was plundered, and [[Solomon's Temple]] was destroyed. Most of the elite were taken into [[Babylonian captivity|captivity in Babylon]]. The city was razed to the ground. Only a few people were permitted to remain to tend to the land.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Jeremiah|52:16|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jew [[Gedaliah]] was made governor of the remnant of Judah, the [[Yehud Province]], with a [[Chaldea]]n guard stationed at [[Mizpah in Benjamin|Mizpah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Kings|25:22–24|HE}}; {{bibleverse||Jeremiah|40:6–8|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bible reports that, on hearing this news, Jews who had fled to [[Moab]], [[Ammon]], [[Edom]], and in other countries returned to Judah.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Jeremiah|40:11–12|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gedaliah was assassinated by [[Ishmael son of Nethaniah]] two months later, and the population that had remained and those who had returned then fled to Egypt for safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Kings|25:25–26|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Jeremiah|43:5–7|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Egypt, they settled in [[Migdol]] (it is uncertain where the Bible is referring to here, probably somewhere in the Nile Delta), [[Tahpanhes]], [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] (called Noph), and [[Pathros]] (the vicinity of [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Jeremiah|44:1|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chronological notes==
{{See also|Jeconiah}}
[[File:Zedekiah is chained and brought before Nebuchadnezzar.jpg|thumb|Zedekiah is chained and brought before [[Nebuchadnezzar II|Nebuchadnezzar]], from [[Petrus Comestor]]'s "[[Bible Historiale]]," 1670.]]
There has been some debate as to when the second siege of Jerusalem took place. There is no dispute that Jerusalem fell the second time in the summer month of Tammuz ({{bibleverse||Jeremiah|52:6|HE}}), but [[William F. Albright]] dates the end of Zedekiah's reign and the fall of Jerusalem to 587 BC, but [[Edwin R. Thiele]] offers 586 BC.&lt;ref name=Thiele&gt;Edwin Thiele, ''[[The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings]]'', (1st ed.; New York: Macmillan, 1951; 2d ed.; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1965; 3rd ed.; Grand Rapids: Zondervan/Kregel, 1983). {{ISBN|0-8254-3825-X}}, {{ISBN|9780825438257}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thiele's reckoning is based on the presentation of Zedekiah's reign on an accession basis, which he asserts was occasionally used for the kings of Judah. In that case, the year that Zedekiah came to the throne would be his ''zero''th year; his first full year would be 597/596 BC, and his eleventh year, the year that Jerusalem fell, would be 587/586 BC. Since Judah's regnal years were counted from Tishri in autumn, that would place the end of his reign and the capture of Jerusalem in the summer of 586 BC.&lt;ref name=Thiele /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leslie McFall, "A Translation Guide to the Chronological Data in Kings and Chronicles," ''Bibliotheca Sacra'' 148 (1991) 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nebuchadnezzar Chronicle]] (BM&amp;nbsp;21946), published in 1956, indicates that Nebuchadnezzar captured Jerusalem the first time putting an end to the reign of [[Jeconiah|Jehoaichin]], on 2&amp;nbsp;Adar (16&amp;nbsp;March) 597&amp;nbsp;BC, in Nebuchadnezzar's seventh year.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Wiseman|D. J. Wiseman]], ''Chronicles of Chaldean Kings in the British Museum'' (London: Trustees of the British Museum, 1956) 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Jeremiah&amp;nbsp;52:28&amp;ndash;29 gives the relative periods for the end of the two sieges as Nebuchadnezzar's seventh and eighteenth years, respectively. (The same periods are elsewhere described at 2&amp;nbsp;Kings&amp;nbsp;24:12 and 2&amp;nbsp;Kings&amp;nbsp;25:8 as Nebuchadnezzar's eighth and nineteenth years, including his accession year.) Identification of Nebuchadnezzar's eighteenth year for the end of the siege places the event in the summer of 587 BC.

[[File:QuietClubbing Gatsby Party 4.08.16.jpg|thumb|QuietClubbing Gatsby Party in New York on April 8, 2016]]
A '''silent disco''' or '''silent rave''' is an event where people dance to music listened to on wireless [[headphone]]s.&lt;ref name="Oxford English Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/silent+disco|title=silent disco - Definition of silent disco in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than using a [[speaker system]], music is broadcast via a radio transmitter with the signal being picked up by wireless headphone receivers worn by the participants. Those without the headphones hear no music, giving the effect of a room full of people dancing to nothing.

In the earliest days of silent discos, before 2005, there would be only one channel available to listen to music through. Over time, the technology moved along to where there were two, and later technology allowed for a third channel that three separate DJs could broadcast over at the same time.

Silent discos are popular at music festivals as they allow dancing to continue past noise curfews. Similar events are "mobile clubbing" gatherings, where a group of people dance to the music on their personal music players.

==History==
[[Image:Silent house party san francisco.jpg|thumb|left|A silent house party in [[San Francisco, California]]]]
An early reference in fiction is the 1969 Finnish science-fiction film ''Ruusujen Aika'' (''A Time of Roses''), where characters wear headsets during a party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0138764/|title= IMDb "A Time of Roses"|publisher=|accessdate=|last=|first= | date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept was used by eco-activists in the early 1990s, utilizing headphones at outdoor parties to minimize noise pollution and disturbance to the local wildlife.

In 1994, the [[Glastonbury Festival]] linked its on-site radio station to the video screen sited next to the Main Stage, allowing festival goers to watch late night [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] football and music videos on the giant screen after the sound curfew by using their own portable radios. The idea was the brainchild of the project manager from Proquip, who supplied the giant screen, and engineers from Moles Recording Studio in [[Bath, Somerset]], who were working with Radio Avalon.

In May 2000, [[BBC]] Live Music held a "silent gig" at [[Chapter Arts Centre]] in [[Cardiff]], where the audience listened to a band, Rocketgoldstar, and various DJs through headphones.&lt;ref name="BBC Music Live events unfold"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/764290.stm|title=BBC News - ENTERTAINMENT - BBC Music Live events unfold|website=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2002 artist Meg Duguid hosted ''Dance with me...''  a silent dance party at the [[Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago]] where she created an outdoor club installation complete with velvet ropes and glow rope in which a DJ spun a transmission to wireless headsets that audience members put on and danced to.&lt;ref&gt;http:&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Molzahn|first1=Laura|title=Summer Solstice Celebration|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/summer-solstice-celebration/Content?oid=908938|website=Chicago Reader|accessdate=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://megduguid.com/section/149646-Dance-with-me.html|title=Dance with me...|website=megduguid.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Duguid threw a second dance party at the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago]] the following year, entitled Dueling DJs where two DJS simultaneously spun two separate musical transmissions various wireless headsets that audience members put on and danced to.  This performance was repeated the following year (2004) at the [[Chicago Cultural Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dueling DJs @ Cultural Center|url=http://www.gapersblock.com/slowdown/archives/2004/12/|website=Gapers Block: Slow Down Archive|accessdate=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "silent disco" has been in existence since at least 2005 with [[Bonnaroo Music Festival]] advertising such an event that year with DJ’s [[Motion Potion]], Quickie Mart and DJ medi4 and headphones provided by KOSS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Netherlands, the traveling arts and culture festival De Parade already featured a "stille disco" [silent disco] earlier, for example in 2003. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schmitz|first1=Jowi|title=Amsterdams Parade-publiek bekijkt zichzelf|url=https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2003/08/05/amsterdams-parade-publiek-bekijkt-zichzelf-7649080-a812311|website=NRC.nl|publisher=NRC|accessdate=21 May 2018|language=Dutch|date=5 August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch DJs Nico Okkerse and Michael Minton have been described as "the pioneers ... in the legend of silent disco" because they started "stille disco" events in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carroll|first1=Robert|title=A quiet night out|url=https://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/music/a-quiet-night-out-1.499140|website=The National|publisher=The National|accessdate=21 May 2018|date=19 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Okkerse claims his company 433fm.com "created Silent Disco in 2002"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nico Okkerse|url=https://www.linkedin.com/in/nico-okkerse-0b0191b/|website=LinkedIn|publisher=LinkedIn|accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its site does have photos from such events going back to at least 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Festival de Parade Museumpark|url=http://www.radio433.com/foto/detail.php?book=20030620&amp;taal=|website=Radio433.com|publisher=433fm.com|accessdate=21 May 2018|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[HUSHconcerts]] (previously, Silent Frisco) was the first company to produce a multi-city Silent Disco tour in 2008 with Silent Soundclash &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2008/jun/14/meltdownmassiveattack|title=Meltdown: Silent disco, big noise|last=Ojumu|first=Akin|date=2008-06-14|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2017-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; kicking off at [[Winter Music Conference]] in Miami, followed by Atlanta, Athens, Savannah, Wilmington NC, Charlottesville Va, Baltimore, New York City, Syracuse, Pittsburgh and St. Louis. During this tour, the company became the first to produce American silent discos on a beach (Miami Beach) and a boat (the Rocksoff Cruise in New York Harbor).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jambands.com/news/2010/04/02/silent-soundclash-rana-eric-krasno-chapter-2-among-cruises-on-rocks-off-calendar|title=Silent Soundclash, RANA, Eric Krasno &amp; Chapter 2 Among Cruises on Rocks Off Calendar|website=www.jambands.com|access-date=2017-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Oxford Dictionary Online]] added the term "silent disco" to their website in February 2011.&lt;ref name="Oxford English Dictionary" /&gt; As interest has increased, there has been a rise in the number of companies organizing parties and providing events with wireless headphones. Some companies have offered home kits.&lt;ref name="craze"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/6142360/Silent-disco-craze-spreads.html|title=Silent disco craze spreads|last=Johnston|first=Ian|date=6 September 2009|work=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=7 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mobile clubbing==
Another type of silent party, known as mobile clubbing, involves the gathering of a group of people in an unconventional location to dance to music which they provide themselves via a [[Portable audio player|portable music device]], such as an [[MP3 player]], listened to on headphones.  These [[flash mob]] gatherings may involve hundreds of people, transforming public spaces into temporary clubbing areas, in which dancers listen to their personal playlists.  To an observer it would appear that the participants are dancing for no apparent reason. Mobile clubbing events are organized using mass-emails, word-of-mouth or [[social networking]] websites such as [[Facebook]], or a combination of these methods.

The first event, organised by London-based artists Ben Cummins (also founder of Pillow Fight Club) and Emma Davis, was at London's [[Liverpool Street Station]] in September 2003.&lt;ref name="Mobile Clubbing website"&gt;[http://www.mobile-clubbing.com/Seedsprouts/MobileClubbing/Display/EventList.aspx?period=past Mobile Clubbing website] retrieved on 2009-02-28&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next five months there were a further five events at other London train stations including [[London Waterloo railway station|Waterloo]], [[Charing Cross railway station|Charing Cross]] and [[London Bridge station|London Bridge]].&lt;ref name="Mobile Clubbing Instructions"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070501081916/http://www.mobile-clubbing.com/eventsWeb/public/mobileclubbing/mcInstructions.aspx Mobile Clubbing Instructions] retrieved on 2007-05-01&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 2008 there had been more than twenty of these events at similar venues throughout London, mostly train station concourses or other public spaces that lend themselves to expressive dancing and rapid dispersal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=409998&amp;in_page_id=1770|title=i-Pod flashmobbers dance in their hundreds at station|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An event in 2007 at [[London Victoria station|Victoria Station]], [[London]] involved 4,000 participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = 4,000 flash mob dancers startle commuters at Victoria | first = Tim | last = Stewart | work = [[Evening Standard]] | date = 2007-04-05 | accessdate = 2007-05-03 | url = https://www.standard.co.uk/news/4000-flash-mob-dancers-startle-commuters-at-victoria-7203786.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The event was broken up by police two hours later.

==Headphone concert==

A headphone concert is a [[live music]] performance where the audience, in the same venue as the performing artist, listens to the music through headphones.&lt;ref name="plug2005"&gt;{{cite web|title=[:]plug[:] (2005)|url=http://deletist.info/|work=deletist.info |accessdate=2016-08-23| date=2005-08-31 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050924230826/http://deletist.info/|archivedate=2005-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea originated in 1997 when [[Erik Minkkinen]],&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Sister Iodine]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="placard2005"&gt;{{cite web|title=the placard headphone festival|url=http://www.leplacard.org/|work=leplacard.org |accessdate=2005-10-26| date=2005-08-31 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051026233655/http://www.leplacard.org/|archivedate=2005-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; an electronic artist&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://v2.nl/archive/people/erik-minkkinen|title=Erik Minkkinen|website=V2_Institute for the Unstable Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/76850-Erik-Minkkinen|title=Erik Minkkinen|website=Discogs}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Paris]], streamed a live concert from his closet over the internet to three listeners in Japan.&lt;ref name="wiredbyo"&gt;{{cite web|last=Axline|first=Keith|title=Fest Rocks With BYO Headphones|url=http://archive.wired.com/entertainment/music/news/2005/08/68682|work=Wired.com entertainment music news|publisher=wired magazine|accessdate=2016-08-23|date=2005-08-31|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160823160820/http://archive.wired.com/entertainment/music/news/2005/08/68682|archivedate=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept led to a decentralized organization known as ''le placard'' ("the Cupboard"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/#fr/en/Placard|title=Google Translate|website=translate.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; which allowed anybody to establish a streaming or listening room.&lt;ref name="wiredbyo"/&gt;

The first headphone concert taking place in front of a live audience took place March 20, 1999, at the [[South by Southwest]] festival in [[Austin, Texas]]. The American psychedelic band [[The Flaming Lips]] used an FM signal generator at the venue and handed out mini [[FM radio]] receivers and headphones to each member of the audience. A normal speaker system was also used so the sound could also be felt. This continued on their "International Music Against Brain Degeneration Revue" tour with mixed results, with technical problems including dead batteries and intoxicated audience members having trouble tuning to the correct frequency.&lt;ref name="warner press archive"&gt;{{cite web|last=Booker|first=Scott|title=Partly Accurate Flaming Lips News|url=http://www.wbr.com/flaminglips/cmp/marnov99.htm|work=Archived News Relating To The Flaming Lips|accessdate=2013-02-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070329221215/http://www.wbr.com/flaminglips/cmp/marnov99.htm|archivedate=2007-03-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another headphone concert was performed in the [[Chapter Arts Centre]], [[Cardiff]] in April 2000 by [[Rocketgoldstar]].&lt;ref name="BBC Music Live events unfold" /&gt;

Later headphone concerts used specially designed wireless 3-channel headphones, better in-house custom made transmitters and no speakers or any live PA in the venue.  Major events hosting headphone concerts included the 2005 [[Glastonbury Festival]], [[2010 Shift Festival]] in Switzerland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Spirgi|first=Dominique|title=2010 Shift Festival english program|url=http://www.shiftfestival.ch/en/shift-2010/program/headphone-concerts/|work=2010 Shift Festival website|publisher=Shift  Electronic Arts Festival   Postfach CH-4023 Basel Switzerland|accessdate=2009-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 2011-12 [[Van's Warp Tours]] across North America, [[Sensoria Music &amp; Film Festival|Sensoria 2012]] in [[Sheffield, UK]], the 2012 [[Bonnaroo Music Festival]] in Tennessee and the [[Hoxeyville Music Fest]] in Michigan.&lt;ref name="knoxnews.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Brimer|first=Adam|title=Bonnaroo Silent Disco Day 1|url=http://www.knoxnews.com/photos/galleries/2012/jun/07/day-1-thursday-at-bonnaroo-2012/46908/|work=knox news|publisher=Knoxnews.com|accessdate=Dec 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, [[Kid Koala]] performed a "Space Cadet Headphone Concert tour" around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2012/04/kid_koala_space_cadet_headphone_experience_april_4_review.php | title = Live: Kid Koala's Space Cadet Headphone Experience Crashes In Brooklyn - New York - Music - Sound of the City | accessdate = 2013-02-21 | last = Mlynar | first = Phillip | date = 2012-04-05 | publisher = [[Village Voice]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variant of the headphone concert involves live bands competing for the audience, who are able to choose which band's frequency to receive. In August 2008, the first silent [[Battle of the Bands]] was held at [[Barfly (club)|The Barfly]] music venue in [[Cardiff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejoycollective.co.uk/blog/uncategorized/preview-silent-gig-featuring-kutosismuscle-club-and-others-barfly-wed-13th-august|title= Silent Gig featuring Kutosis/Muscle Club and others @ Barfly : Wed 13th August |publisher=Joy Collective|accessdate=2008-08-08|last=|first= | date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event featured bands going directly head-to-head, with a stage at each end of the venue, allowing gig-goers to choose which group they wished to listen to.

==Silent theatre==
Theatre and performance companies are now beginning to exploit silent disco technology as well. In 2009, with the help of SilentArena Ltd, Feral Productions began using an experimental approach – a mixture of narrative-led performance, [[sound art]] and guided exhibit. Their first performance, ''The Gingerbread House'', took the audience from The [[Courtyard, Hereford]] on a journey through a [[multi-storey car park]] in the centre of Hereford. In 2010, their second show, ''Locked (Rapunzel’s Lament)'', took place in a children’s playground, also in Hereford. Silent theatre techniques are now being used by companies in Liverpool, Birmingham and Glasgow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.herefordtimes.com/leisure/reviews/4715331.Thinking_out_of_the_dramatic_box/ |title=The Gingerbread House breaks dramatic boundaries in Hereford |accessdate= |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.herefordtimes.com/leisure/theatre/8383794.New_theatre_group___s_hoping_for_another_fairytale_ending_at_The_Courtyard_in_Hereford/ |title=Feral Productions' hoping for another fairytale ending at The Courtyard in Hereford |accessdate= |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 [[Lincoln Center]] staged a production of the [[Rocky Horror Picture Show]] utilizing Quiet Events Headphones,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quiet Theater|url=https://quietevents.com/quiet-theater/|website=Quiet Events|publisher=Quiet Events|accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; where an audience wearing headphones could switch between the audio for the live performance and the soundtrack of the film version being projected behind it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = ‘Rocky Horror’ at Lincoln Center, With Headphones|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/10/movies/rocky-horror-in-central-park-with-headphones.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2015-08-09|access-date = 2015-09-25|issn = 0362-4331|first = Dave|last = Itzkoff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Silent street shows ==
Street performers have used the concept as a solution to overcome bans on amplification and loudspeakers on the street. In 2016, Irish band [[Until April]] began using this for their shows on the street while touring in Germany and Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.advertiser.ie/galway/article/86139/galway-duo-find-novel-way-to-overcome-amplifier-bans-on-continental-europe|title=Galway duo find novel way to overcome amplifier bans on continental Europe|access-date=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2008, 36 medals have been awarded, of which 27 have been awarded to citizens of the United Kingdom and two to citizens of France. One medal each has been won by citizens of New Zealand, Germany, Austria, Russia, Italy, Sweden and the United States. Only two women ([[Mary Cartwright]] and [[Dusa McDuff]]) have ever won the medal.

'''Teatro Degollado''' ({{IPA-es|teˈatɾo ðeɣoˈʝaðo|lang}}, ''[[Santos Degollado|Degollado]] Theater'') is a [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]]&lt;ref name=gdltours&gt;[http://www.gdltours.com/degollado_theater_guadalajara.html " Guadalajara Historic District Teatro Degollado "], "gDLtours".&lt;/ref&gt; Mexican theater known for its diverse performances and artistic design. It is located in the central plaza of  [[Guadalajara]], [[Jalisco]], Mexico on Belen Street between Hidalgo Avenue and Morelos Avenue. Many performances (from cultural Mexican dances to international operas) take place in this building.&lt;ref name=discover&gt;[http://discovermexicoadventures.web.officelive.com/TeatroDegollado.aspx “Teatro Degollado”] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814165111/http://discovermexicoadventures.web.officelive.com/TeatroDegollado.aspx |date=2011-08-14 }}, "Discover Mexico Adventures".&lt;/ref&gt; Meant to be a monument of Guadalajara's culture, the theater was inaugurated in September 1866; breathing life to the city through its innovative artistic beauty.

== Original plans ==
Degollado Theater was constructed during Mexico's 1800's theatrical movement. There was a high demand for a great theater in Guadalajara, Jalisco that displayed the cultural arts of the city.&lt;ref name=discover/&gt; In response to the demand, on October 1, 1855, Antonio Perez Verdia proposed the construction of Alarcon Theater (after the classic dramatist [[Juan Ruiz de Alarcon]])&lt;ref name=costa&gt;[http://www.costalegre.org/Cultural-Centers/teatro-degollado.html "Teatro Degollado"], "Costa Alegre &amp; Mexico Practical Travel Guide", Tuesday July 06, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; to the current governor of the time, [[Santos Degollado]]. On December 12 of that same year, Degollado signed the official decree to build the structure, and in March, 1856, Degollado set the first cornerstone of the building. In April 1856, Jacobo Galvez was appointed to lead the initial construction of the theater.&lt;ref name=gdltours/&gt;&lt;ref name=centenario&gt;Pizano y Saucedo, Carlos. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25134633 "Centenario del “Teatro Degollado” De Guadalajara"], "[[El Colegio de México]]", Guadalajara.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to a three-year war in Mexico, and a change of government during the dispute, the completion of the project was slow. On November 12, 1861, Governor Pedro Amazon changed the proposed name of the project from the "Alarcon Theater" to the "Degollado Theater", after ex-governor and general at the time of his death, Santos Degollado (killed in a battle on June 16, 1861).&lt;ref name=gdltours/&gt;&lt;ref name=discover/&gt;&lt;ref name=costa/&gt; This change of name was not acknowledged at the time of inauguration, but was adopted on December 18, 1866, when Mexican liberal troops regained control of the plaza where the theater is located.&lt;ref name=centenario/&gt;

== First inauguration ==
The theater's first inauguration was on September 13, 1866, with the opera "[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]", performed by [[Angela Peralta]], opera soprano noted as the "Mexican Nightingale".&lt;ref name=gdltours/&gt;&lt;ref name=costa/&gt; At this point in time the theater had not been completed. Subsequently, there were many renovations and four more inaugurations.&lt;ref name=centenario/&gt;

== Inauguration dates ==
These are the dates of all the inaugurations following renovations of the structure:

* September 13, 1866
* October 30, 1880
* September 15, 1910	
* June 28, 1941
* September 8, 1964	
&lt;ref name=centenario/&gt;

== Artistic design ==
Degollado Theater is famous for its beautiful paintings along its golden walls on the interior of the building and its symbolic mosaic on the exterior.

===Interior ===

Most of the theater's renovations were made to improve the interior design by adding paintings and giving it its current red and golden color. Before the theater's first inauguration, Gerardo Suarez and Carlos Villasenor decorated the theater with a mural representing [[Dante Alighieri]]'s fourth song in the [[Divine Comedy]].&lt;ref name=discover/&gt; On 1877, Fermin Riestra was ordered to continue with the construction  of the building; a three-year process on which a gilded eagle holding a Mexican flag on its talons and a chain on its beak was placed on the center of the inner arch of the building. Within the three year construction, Felipe Castro painted the murals ''Time and Hours'' and ''The Fame'' on the proscenium arch. Between 1880 and 1890, the stucco on the concert hall was completed and a golden color was added to the interior walls. By 1893, tiles were removed from the stage, due to the lack of support they provided for the structure, and were replaced by a metal arch on 1905. Between 1909 and 1910 artist [[Roberto Montenegro]] focused on the reconstruction and decoration of the interior of the building which included the addition of a crystal lamp on the theater's vault. Fifty years later, architect Ignacio Diaz Morales was in charge of a complete restoration of the building where sculptures by Benito Castaneda replaced Venetian mosaics. On May 2001, a chamber hall that can hold 200 people was added to the inside of the building.&lt;ref name=gdltours/&gt;&lt;ref name=centenario/&gt;

===Exterior===

With fewer renovations than the interior, the exterior of the building still retains its artistic beauty. Between 1953 and 1959 Montenegro painted the mosaic of Apollo and the nine muses on the [[pediment]] of the theater. The portico supporting the pediment consists of 16 [[corinthian order|Corinthian]] columns.&lt;ref name=gdltours/&gt;&lt;ref name=costa/&gt;  When Ignacio Diaz was in charge of the renovation of the theater, he ordered the engraving of the phrase "May we never hear a hint of discord" along Montenegro's mosaic on the main entrance.&lt;ref name=discover/&gt;

==Building's dimensions==
Several measurements of the Theater:
*Building measures 97&amp;nbsp;m long, 36.4&amp;nbsp;m wide, and 22.5&amp;nbsp;m high.
*Stage measures 54&amp;nbsp;m by 18&amp;nbsp;m.&lt;ref name=gdltours/&gt;
*Oval hall measures 10&amp;nbsp;m × 6.5&amp;nbsp;m wide.
*Building capacity of 1,015 spectators.&lt;ref name=gdltours/&gt;

'''Tempe Girl''' is the name given to an [[unidentified decedent]] whose body was discovered on April 27, 2002 in [[Tempe, Arizona]]. She had died of [[cocaine intoxication]]—ruled to be neither an [[accidental death|accident]] nor a [[homicide]]—one day before the discovery of her body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Teen Died Eight Years Ago. Who Is She? |date=September 13, 2010 |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/09/13/grace.coldcase.jane.doe/index.html |publisher=CNN |accessdate=November 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decedent is believed to have been of either [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic]] or [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] ethnicity and was allegedly picked up while hitchhiking, claiming she had been effectively disowned by her own mother for her frequent [[recreational drug use]].&lt;ref name=NCMEC&gt;{{cite web|title=Jane Doe 2002|url=http://www.missingkids.org/poster/NCMU/1111241/1#poster|website=missingkids.org|publisher=[[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]]|accessdate=October 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NamUs UP # 1987|url=https://www.namus.gov/UnidentifiedPersons/Case#/1987|website=www.namus.gov|publisher=[[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]]|accessdate=November 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This unidentified decedent became known as '''Tempe Girl''' due to [[Tempe, Arizona|the city]] in which her body was discovered. Her official case number is '''02-1368'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unidentified Persons Bureau|url=http://www.maricopa.gov/Medex/Unidentified/search.aspx?caseNum=02-1368|website=maricopa.gov|publisher=Maricopa County Medical Examiner|accessdate=November 22, 2018|year=2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303231803/http://www.maricopa.gov/Medex/Unidentified/search.aspx?caseNum=02-1368|archivedate=March 3, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
On April 27, 2002, the fully clothed body of a teenage female was discovered in the vicinity of 1850 East University Drive, close to the [[Arizona State University]], in Tempe, Arizona. She had been deceased for less than 24 hours before the discovery of her body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NamUs UP # 1987|url=https://www.namus.gov/UnidentifiedPersons/Case#/1987|website=www.namus.gov|publisher=[[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]]|accessdate=November 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case File 501UFAZ|url=http://doenetwork.org/cases/501ufaz.html|website=doenetwork.org|publisher=[[The Doe Network]]|accessdate=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Close to the body of the decedent, investigators located a compact disc, from which they were able to retrieve several clear [[fingerprint]]s which, via an examination of police records, were identified as belonging to a woman living in [[Phoenix, Arizona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NamUs UP # 1987|url=https://www.namus.gov/UnidentifiedPersons/Case#/1987|website=www.namus.gov|publisher=[[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]]|accessdate=November 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autopsy===
Tempe Girl was aged between 15 and 19 years old at the time of her death, and was five feet one inch in height.{{refn|group=n|Some sources state the most likely age of Tempe Girl to be approximately 17 years old. Furthermore, other sources state Temper Girl's height to be "approximately" five feet one inches.&lt;ref name=for&gt;{{cite news|last1=Trepkov|first1=Diana|title=Forensic Art|url=http://www.forensicmag.com/articles/2011/04/forensic-art|accessdate=October 17, 2014|agency=Forensic Magazine|date=April 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ANNA DOE - Can I Come Home Now?|url=http://canyouidentifyme.blogspot.com/2010/12/anna-doe-can-i-come-home-now.html|website=canyouidentifyme.org|accessdate=October 16, 2014|date=December 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} She weighed between 120 and 125 pounds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NamUs UP # 1987|url=https://www.namus.gov/UnidentifiedPersons/Case#/1987|website=www.namus.gov|publisher=[[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]]|accessdate=November 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;and was most likely of Hispanic ancestry, although her actual heritage may have been Native American.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NamUs UP # 1987|url=https://www.namus.gov/UnidentifiedPersons/Case#/1987|website=www.namus.gov|publisher=[[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]]|accessdate=November 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decedent had brown eyes and black hair which was 12 inches in length, extending past her shoulder by several inches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NamUs UP # 1987|url=https://www.namus.gov/UnidentifiedPersons/Case#/1987|website=www.namus.gov|publisher=[[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]]|accessdate=November 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wore a red halter top, blue jeans with a distinctive hollow silver [[medal|medallion]] pattern,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Reconstruction of an Unidentified Girl Found in Tempe, Arizona|url=https://www.forensicmag.com/article/2011/04/forensic-art|website=forensicmag.com|publisher=Forensic Art|accessdate=November 25, 2018|date=April 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; a side zipper, and eyelets upon the waistband,&lt;ref name=NCMEC/&gt; blue underwear, one wedge black high heel shoe (size 6.5), and a purple elastic hair tie upon her wrist.&lt;ref name=Muensch/&gt; In addition, the decedent had an ''L''-shaped scar measuring approximately one inch in length on the back of her left hand; this scar was vertical, and extended beneath her pinky and ring fingers toward her wrist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NamUs UP # 1987|url=https://www.namus.gov/UnidentifiedPersons/Case#/1987|website=www.namus.gov|publisher=[[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]]|accessdate=November 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also had a scar on her left shoulder. The decedent also wore faded purple nail polish on her fingernails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case File 501UFAZ|url=http://doenetwork.org/cases/501ufaz.html|website=doenetwork.org|publisher=[[The Doe Network]]|accessdate=October 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her dental charts, [[DNA]], and fingerprints yielded no results matching her to any known missing person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Reconstruction of an Unidentified Girl Found in Tempe, Arizona|url=https://www.forensicmag.com/article/2011/04/forensic-art|website=forensicmag.com|publisher=Forensic Art|accessdate=November 25, 2018|date=April 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, investigators suspected the [[cause of death]] of the decedent to be foul play, although this theory was quickly disproven through both the subsequent formal questioning of witnesses, and discovering via the official [[coroner]]'s report that the official cause of death had been acute [[cocaine intoxication]].&lt;ref name=Muensch/&gt; The ultimate nature of this case was never determined, as the [[autopsy]] conducted upon the decedent did not reveal if she had been murdered or had died by a form of [[death by misadventure|misadventure]].

==Investigation==
The clothing Tempe Girl had worn did not assist investigators in determining her identity, as all manufacturing brands were either common or could not be determined.&lt;ref name=for&gt;{{cite news|last1=Trepkov|first1=Diana|title=Forensic Art|url=http://www.forensicmag.com/articles/2011/04/forensic-art|accessdate=October 17, 2014|agency=Forensic Magazine|date=April 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon discovering that the fingerprints upon the compact disc located close to the decedent's body belonged to a woman living in Phoenix, investigators interviewed this individual. The woman claimed to have no knowledge about the decedent, although her boyfriend confirmed to investigators that he had observed this girl hitchhiking alone near 32nd Street and Greenway Road in Phoenix on April 26, and that he had offered her a ride to her intended destination of Tempe. According to this [[Eyewitness memory|eyewitness]], the girl had been hitchhiking from Phoenix to Tempe with an expressed intention of purchasing tickets for an upcoming music concert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NamUs UP # 1987|url=https://www.namus.gov/UnidentifiedPersons/Case#/1987|website=www.namus.gov|publisher=[[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]]|accessdate=November 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the woman's boyfriend, the girl had voluntarily entered his vehicle in the vicinity of 32nd Street and Greenway Road on April 26. The young woman had conversed solely in Spanish as she rode in his vehicle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ANNA DOE - Can I Come Home Now?|url=http://canyouidentifyme.blogspot.com/2010/12/anna-doe-can-i-come-home-now.html|website=canyouidentifyme.org|accessdate=October 16, 2014|date=December 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had furthermore informed this individual that she had recently been effectively disowned by her own family due to her habitual recreational drug use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NamUs UP # 1987|url=https://www.namus.gov/UnidentifiedPersons/Case#/1987|website=www.namus.gov|publisher=[[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]]|accessdate=November 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Collom&gt;{{cite news|last1=Collom|first1=Lindsey|title=Police Seek Help in Identifying Teen|url=http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2008/04/29/20080429unidentified0429.html|accessdate=October 16, 2014|agency=The Arizona Republic|publisher=Gannett|date=29 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had driven her to Tempe, where the decedent had initially stated she intended to purchase tickets for a music concert, although en route, she had changed her mind and asked the man if he was able to obtain drugs, to which he replied in the affirmarive.&lt;ref name=Muensch/&gt;

After the driver had picked up a second individual—whom he had known as a drug dealer—the young woman had spent her money on cocaine from this individual instead of purchasing tickets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unidentified Persons Bureau|url=http://www.maricopa.gov/Medex/Unidentified/search.aspx?caseNum=02-1368|website=maricopa.gov|publisher=Maricopa County Medical Examiner|accessdate=October 16, 2014|year=2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303231803/http://www.maricopa.gov/Medex/Unidentified/search.aspx?caseNum=02-1368|archivedate=March 3, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the decedent ingested the cocaine, she reportedly developed a negative reaction to the drug, causing her to experience acute [[convulsion]]s.{{refn|group=n|Investigators have stated that although Tempe Girl had ingested a high dosage of cocaine, the quantity she had ingested was not "a completely spectacular amount".&lt;ref name=who&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weed|first1=Alexis|title=Teen died Eight years ago.

The driver of the vehicle in which Tempe Girl had allegedly ingested the cocaine was never prosecuted, as the [[medical examiner]] was uncertain either if the decedent had been under 18 at the time of her death; whether she was still alive at the time she left his vehicle; or if she had been either pushed or dragged from the vehicle to the location of her discovery.

==Ongoing investigation==
Tempe investigators did subsequently search through numerous schools in Arizona for leads pertaining to any female known to be missing whose physical features matched her description. All these lines of inquiry failed to bear fruition. In addition, the [[Tempe Police Department]] have maintained contact with Mexican investigators, suspecting the decedent may possibly have been an immigrant.{{refn|group=n|Investigators have stated they believe this decedent may have hailed from Phoenix, Arizona.&lt;ref name=for&gt;{{cite news|last1=Trepkov|first1=Diana|title=Forensic Art|url=http://www.forensicmag.com/articles/2011/04/forensic-art|accessdate=October 17, 2014|agency=Forensic Magazine|date=April 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''''Variations on the Death of Trotsky''''' is a short [[one-act]] [[comedy-drama]] written by [[David Ives]] for the series of one-act plays titled ''[[All in the Timing]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dramatists.com/cgi-bin/db/single.asp?key=30 "All in the Timing, Six One-Act Comedies"] dramatists.com, accessed February 8, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The play fictionalizes the death of [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian revolution]]ary [[Leon Trotsky]] through a number of distinct variations, though all from the same, historically accurate cause: a wound to the head by an [[ice axe|ice ax]]&amp;mdash;referred to in the play as a "mountain-climber's ax", for comic effect, to distinguish it from an [[ice pick|icepick]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrucki, Martin.[http://www.thepublictheatre.org/education/study_guides/1995-96/All_in_the_Timing.html?r=20131031 " 'All in the Timing' Study Guide"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222141001/http://www.thepublictheatre.org/education/study_guides/1995-96/All_in_the_Timing.html?r=20131031 |date=2014-02-22 }} thepublictheatre.org, November 1995, accessed February 8, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
While keeping with the tradition and style of Ives's plays of taking an odd conceit and playing it for laughs as the audience finds its feet before giving the big payoff, ''Variations'' is distinguished, along with ''[[Words, Words, Words]]'' and ''[[Philip Glass Buys a Loaf of Bread]]'' in that, while it begins comically, it may end either comically or dramatically, depending on the production. It is unique in that, of all of his works, it calls the most for an unexpectedly tragic, sentimental ending.  Arguably, it is also Ives' only piece centered around a single character (while ''Philip Glass Buys a Loaf of Bread'' could be similarly considered, in fact the majority of that play is an ensemble piece).

==Synopsis==
The play is divided into eight scenes or "variations", each depicting a differing final moment of Trotsky's life and making satirical [[allusion]]s to [[soap opera]] conventions, ''[[The Honeymooners]]'', and [[Yorick|Act 5, Scene 1 from ''Hamlet'']]. True to its title, the play calls for Trotsky to die at the end of each scene, and then continues on (after the ring of a bell) from near where the last scene left off, usually progressing the story a bit further each time. Since the play takes place on the day of Trotsky's death (one day after the attack) Trotsky is depicted throughout the show with a mountain-climber's ax sticking comically out of his skull (not an icepick, as is made clear a number of times). Though this is apparent to the audience from the very beginning, Trotsky himself does not realize that the ax is there until his wife, known only as Mrs. Trotsky, comes in with an encyclopedia from the future which tells of Trotsky's demise. The third and final character is introduced near the end of the play: [[Ramon Mercader]], the Spanish assassin who  "smashed, not buried" the ax into Trotsky's skull. Trotsky has a deep fear of icepicks, and is taken aback when he finds that his fear should have been directed towards mountain-climber axes.

After seven essentially comedic variations, the eighth involves Trotsky seeing Mercader out of the house in a civil manner, with Ramon&amp;mdash;having posed as a gardener&amp;mdash;revealing that he actually did perform some gardening on Trotsky's property and requesting that Trotsky go outside to admire his [[Tropaeolum|nasturtiums]]. Trotsky then comes to grips with the facts of his impending demise, settling affairs with his wife, pondering the nature of man and humanity ("So even an assassin can make the flowers grow") and reciting some future events that he will never live to know about. Finally he declares that he is in his "last room", though Mrs. Trotsky tries to explain that he is, in fact, unconscious in a hospital. Trotsky accepts that he is fortunate just to have lived for another day after the attack&amp;mdash;that this seems to be symbolic of some sort of hope concerning human life. He decides to go look at the garden that Ramon had tended to, but before he can, he dies for the final time.

==Productions==
''Variations on the Death of Trotsky'' was originally presented in January 1991&lt;ref&gt;Ives, David. [https://books.google.com/books?id=cI0BujZH-DUC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;lpg=PA87&amp;dq=Manhattan+Punch+Line+Theatre,+1991 ''Variations on the Death of Trotsky''] ''All in the Timing: Six One-act Comedies'', Dramatists Play Service, Inc, 1994, {{ISBN|0822213966}}, pp 85ff&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Manhattan Punch Line Theatre]] (Steve Kaplan, artistic director), in New York City as part of its annual Festival of One-Act Comedies. It was directed by Jason McConell Buzas, and stage managed by [[Kathryn Maloney]]. The set design was by [[Vaughn Patterson]]; the costume design was by Sharon Lynch; the lighting design was by [[Patt Dignan]]. The cast was as follows:

* Daniel Hagen as Trotsky
* [[Nora Mae Lyng]] as Mrs. Trotsky
* Steven Rodriguez as Ramon

''Variations on the Death of Trotsky'' was performed as part of the Ives' six one-act plays ''[[All in the Timing]]'' [[Off-Broadway]] at [[Primary Stages]] in December 1993 and revived in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Lipton, Brian Scott.

==History==
[[File:The birth of the Buddha; scene with Queen Maya Wellcome V0046076.jpg|thumb|[[Maya (mother of the Buddha)|Queen Maya]] holds onto a branch of a tree while giving birth to the Buddha, who is received by [[Śakra (Buddhism)|Śakra]] as other gods look on.]]
The decision to agree to celebrate Wesākha as the Buddha’s birthday was formalized at the first conference of the [[World Fellowship of Buddhists]] held in Sri Lanka in 1950, although festivals at this time in the Buddhist world are a centuries-old tradition. The resolution that was adopted at the World Conference reads as follows:
{{quote|That this Conference of the World Fellowship of Buddhists, while recording its appreciation of the gracious act of His Majesty, the [[King of Nepal|Maharaja of Nepal]] in making the full-moon day of Vesak a [[Culture of Nepal#Festivals and celebrations|Public Holiday in Nepal]], earnestly requests the Heads of Governments of all countries in which large or small number of Buddhists are to be found, to take steps to make the full-moon day in the month of May a Public Holiday in honour of the Buddha, who is universally acclaimed as one of the greatest benefactors of Humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = World Fellowship of Buddhists Second Two-Year Plan (B.E. 2544-2545/2001-2002)|url = http://www.bdcu.org.au/bddronline/bddr11no3/wfbs2ypn.html#plan1|website = Buddha Dhyana Dana Review Online|accessdate = 2015-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
On Vesākha Day, Buddhists all over the world commemorate events of significance to Buddhists of all traditions: The birth, enlightenment and the passing away of [[Gautama Buddha]]. As Buddhism spread from India it was assimilated into many foreign cultures, and consequently Vesākha is celebrated in many different ways all over the world. In India, Vaishakh Purnima day is also known as Buddha Jayanti day and has been traditionally accepted as Buddha's birth day.

In 1999, the United Nations resolved to internationally observe the day of Vesak at its headquarters and offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY: 54/115. International recognition of the Day of Vesak at United Nations Headquarters and other United Nations offices|url=http://www.worldlii.org/int/other/UNGARsn/1999/192.pdf|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=6 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the observance is derived from the [[Pali]] term ''{{lang|pl|vesākha}}'' or [[Sanskrit]] ''{{lang|sa|vaiśākha}}'', which is the name of the lunar month used in ancient India falling in April–May. In [[Mahayana]] Buddhist traditions, the holiday is known by its Sanskrit name (Vaiśākha) and derived variants of it. Local renditions of the name vary by language, including:

==Celebration==
May 2007 had two full moon days: the 1st and the 31st. Some countries (including Sri Lanka, Cambodia and Malaysia) celebrated Vesākha on the 1st, and others (Thailand, Singapore) celebrated the holiday on the 31st because of a different local lunar observance. The difference also manifests in the observance of other Buddhist holidays, which are traditionally observed at the local full moon.

Likewise, in 2012, Vesak was observed on 28 April in Hong Kong and Taiwan, on 5 May in Sri Lanka, on 6 May in India and Bangladesh, on 28 May in South Korea and on 4 June in Thailand. (In 1999, the Taiwanese government set Buddha's birthday as the second Sunday of May, the same date as [[Mother's Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Thousands of believers mark Buddha's birthday |author= Camaron Kao |date= 14 May 2012 |work= [[China Post]] |url= http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national-news/2012/05/14/341025/Thousands-of.htm |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130616030705/http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national-news/2012/05/14/341025/Thousands-of.htm |archivedate= 16 June 2013 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Sakyamuni Buddha birthday celebrated |author= Ko Shu-Ling |date= 9 May 2011 |work= Taipei Times |url= http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2011/05/09/2003502765 |quote= The legislature approved a proposal in 1999 to designate the birthday of Sakyamuni Buddha — which falls on the eighth day of the fourth month of the lunar calendar — a national holiday and to celebrate the special occasion concurrently with International Mother’s Day, which is celebrated on the second Sunday of May. }}&lt;/ref&gt;). In 2014, Vesak is celebrated on 13 May in Myanmar, Singapore and Thailand while it is observed on 15 May in Indonesia.

On Vesākha, devout Buddhists and followers alike assemble in their various temples before dawn for the ceremonial and honorable hoisting of the [[Buddhist flag]] and the singing of hymns in praise of the holy [[Refuge (Buddhism)|triple gem]]: The [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], The [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]] (his teachings), and The [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]] (his disciples). Devotees may bring simple offerings of flowers, candles and [[joss-sticks]] to lay at the feet of their teacher. These symbolic offerings are to remind followers that just as the beautiful flowers would wither away after a short while and the candles and joss-sticks would soon burn out, so too is life subject to decay and destruction. Devotees are enjoined to make a special effort to refrain from killing of any kind. They are encouraged to partake of vegetarian food for the day. In some countries, notably Sri Lanka, two days are set aside for the celebration of Vesākha and all liquor shops and slaughter houses are closed by government decree during the two days.

Also birds, insects and animals are released by the thousands in what is known as a 'symbolic act of liberation' of giving freedom to those who are in captivity, imprisoned, or tortured against their will. (The practice, however, is banned in some countries such as Singapore, as it is believed that the released animals are unable to survive long-term and may adversely impact the local ecosystem if they do.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tnp.sg/news/singapore-news/vesak-day-practice-releasing-animals-harms-ecosystems|title=Vesak Day practice of releasing animals harms ecosystems|date=22 May 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some devout Buddhists will wear a simple white dress and spend the whole day in temples with renewed determination to observe the [[Noble Eightfold Path|Eight Precepts]].
[[File:WesakDay.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Young novice monk on Vesākha Day Parade]]

Devout Buddhists undertake to lead a noble life according to the teaching by making daily affirmations to observe the [[Five Precepts]]. However, on special days, notably new moon and full moon days, they observe the eight Precepts to train themselves to practice morality, simplicity, and humility.

Some temples also display a small statue of the Buddha in front of the altar in a small basin filled with water and decorated with flowers, allowing devotees to pour water over the statue; it is symbolic of the cleansing of a practitioner's bad karma, and to reenact the events following the Buddha's birth, when devas and spirits made heavenly offerings to him.

Devotees are expected to listen to talks given by monks. On this day, monks will recite verses uttered by the Buddha twenty-five centuries ago to invoke peace and happiness for the government and the people. Buddhists are reminded to live in harmony with people of other faiths and to respect the beliefs of other people as the Buddha taught.

===Bringing happiness to others===
[[File:Korean Minute- Buddha's Birthday Festival.webm|thumb|Video Korean Buddhist monks perform ritual dances and music on Buddha's Birthday.]]
Celebrating Vesākha (Vesak) also means making special efforts to bring happiness to the unfortunate like the aged, the handicapped and the sick. To this day, Buddhists will distribute gifts in cash and kind to various charitable homes throughout the country. Vesākha is also a time for great joy and happiness, expressed not by pandering to one’s appetites but by concentrating on useful activities such as decorating and illuminating temples, painting and creating exquisite scenes from the life of the Buddha for public dissemination. Devout Buddhists also vie with one another to provide refreshments and vegetarian food to followers who visit the temple to pay homage to the Enlightened One.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

===Paying homage to the Buddha===
Tradition ascribes to the Buddha himself instruction on how to pay him homage. Just before he died, he saw his faithful attendant [[Ananda]], weeping. The Buddha advised him not to weep, but to understand the universal law that all [[Dependent origination|compounded things]] (including even his own body) must disintegrate. He advised everyone not to cry over the disintegration of the physical body but to regard his teachings (The Dhamma) as their teacher from then on, because only the Dhamma truth is eternal and not subject to the law of change. He also stressed that the way to pay homage to him was not merely by offering flowers, incense, and lights, but by truly and sincerely striving to follow his teachings. This is how Buddhists are expected to celebrate Vesak: to use the opportunity to reiterate their determination to lead noble lives, to develop their minds, to practise loving-kindness and to bring peace and harmony to humanity. {{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Dates of observance===
The exact date of Vesak is based on the Asian [[lunisolar calendar]]s and is primarily celebrated in [[Vaisakha]] month of the [[Buddhist calendar]] and the [[Hindu calendar]], and hence the name Vesak. In Nepal, which is considered the birth-country of Buddha, it is celebrated on the full moon day of the [[Vaisakha]] month of the [[Hindu calendar]], and is traditionally called Buddha Purnima, Purnima meaning the full moon day in Sanskrit. In Theravada countries following the [[Buddhist calendar]], it falls on a full moon Uposatha day, typically in the 5th or 6th lunar month. Nowadays, in Sri Lanka, Nepal, India, and Bangladesh, Vesak/Buddha Purnima is celebrated on the day of the full moon in May in the Gregorian calendar.

[[File:2600 Sambuddhatva jayanthi in Jetavana 02.jpg|thumb|Vesak is celebrated in [[Jetavana]], India, 2011]]

===In Japan===
In Japan, Vesākha or {{nihongo||花祭|hanamatsuri}} is also known as {{nihongo||灌仏会|Kanbutsue}},  {{nihongo||降誕会|Goutan'e}}), {{nihongo||仏生会|Busshoue}}, {{nihongo||浴仏会|Yokubutsue}}, {{Nihongo||龍華会|Ryuge'e}} and {{nihongo||花会式|Hanaeshiki}}. It is not a public holiday. It is based on a legend that a dragon appeared in the sky on the Buddha's birthday and poured [[soma (drink)|soma]] over him.

It used to be celebrated on the 8th day of the fourth month in the [[Chinese calendar]] based on one of the legends that proclaims the day as Buddha's birthday. At present, the celebration is observed on 8 April of the Solar Calendar since the [[government of Meiji Japan]] adopted the western solar calendar as the official calendar. Since the 8th day of the fourth month in the lunar calendar commonly falls in May of the current solar calendar, it is now celebrated about a month earlier.

In Japan, Vesak celebrations include pouring {{nihongo||[[amacha]]|甘茶}}, a sweet tea made from ''[[Hydrangea macrophylla]]'', on statues. In Buddhist religious sites such as temples and [[vihara]]s, more involved ceremonies are conducted for lay Buddhists, priests, and monks and nuns.

===In Nepal===
Vesak, commonly known in Nepal as "Buddha Jayanti" is widely celebrated all across the country, predominantly, [[Lumbini]] – the birthplace of Buddha, and [[Swayambhunath|Swayambhu]] – the holy temple for Buddhists, also known as "the Monkey Temple". The main door of [[Swayambhunath|Swayambhu]] is opened only on this very day, therefore, people from all over Kathmandu valley are stimulated by the event. Thousands of pilgrims from various parts of the world come together to celebrate Buddha's birthday at his birthplace, [[Lumbini]]. In [[Nepal]], Buddha is worshipped by all religious groups, therefore "Buddha Jayanti" is marked by a public holiday. People donate foods and clothes to the needy and also provide financial aid to monasteries and schools where Buddhism is taught and practised.

===In Sri Lanka===
[[File:Piliyandala Vesak Pandol, May 2015.jpg|thumbnail|Vesak Thorana in Piliyandala, Sri Lanka]]
Vesak is celebrated as a religious and a cultural festival in Sri Lanka on the full moon of the lunar month of Vesak (usually in the Gregorian month of May), for about one week and this festival is often celebrated by different religious people in Sri Lanka.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2018/04/29/spectrum/unifying-spiritual-and-secular|title=Unifying the Spiritual and The secular|last=|first=|date=2018-04-27|work=Sunday Observer|access-date=29 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this week, the selling of alcohol and fresh meat is usually prohibited, with abattoirs also being closed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lanka.com/events/vesak-festival/ Vesak Festival in Sri Lanka]&lt;/ref&gt; Celebrations include religious and alms-giving activities. Electrically-lit [[pandal]]s called ''thoranas'' are erected in locations mainly in Colombo, Kandy, Galle and elsewhere, most sponsored by donors, religious societies and welfare groups. Each pandal illustrates a story from the [[Jataka tales]].

In addition, colourful lanterns called ''Vesak kuudu'' are hung along streets and in front of homes. They signify the light of the Buddha, Dharma and the Sangha. Food stalls set up by Buddhist devotees called ''dansälas'' provide free food, ice-cream and drinks to passersby.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lanka.com/events/vesak-festival/|title=Vesak Festival in Sri Lanka|last=|first=|date=|website=lanka.com|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=29 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groups of people from community organisations, businesses and government departments sing ''bhakti gee'' (Buddhist devotional songs). Colombo experiences a massive influx of people from all parts of the country during this week.

===In Korea===

[[File:KOCIS Korea YeonDeungHoe 20130511 05 (8733836165).jpg|thumb|Lotus Lantern Festival (연등회, Yeon Deung Hoe) in [[Seoul]]]]
In South Korea the [[Buddha's Birthday|birthday of Buddha]] is celebrated on the 8th day of the 4th month in the [[Korean calendar|Korean lunar calendar]] (as well as in [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]], Vietnam) and is an official holiday. This day is called {{lang|ko|석가탄신일}} (Seokga tansinil), meaning "Buddha's birthday" or {{lang|ko|부처님 오신 날}} (Bucheonim osin nal) meaning "the day when the Buddha came". It has now grown into one of the nation’s biggest cultural festivals. Lotus lanterns cover the entire temple throughout the month which are often flooded down the street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.korea.net/NewsFocus/Culture/view?articleId=107937|title=Lotus lanterns light up Seoul night|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the day of Buddha's birth, many temples provide free meals and tea to all visitors. The breakfast and lunch provided are often sanchae [[bibimbap]].

===In Laos===
The '''Vixakha Bouxa''' festival is the [[Lao people|Lao]] version of the Thai Visakha Puja, which it closely resembles. It commemorates the [[birth]], [[Bodhi|enlightenment]], and [[death]] of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], which are all said to have happened on the same date. It is held around the month of May or ''Vesak'', based on the lunar calendar. Celebrations include [[Dance and Theater of Laos|dances]], [[poetry|poems]], [[parade]]s, [[procession]]s, [[meditation|deep meditation]], [[Dance and Theater of Laos|theatrical performances]], and [[puppet show]]s.

====Boun Bang Fay====
One part of the Vixakha Bouxa festival is called '''Boun Bang Fay''', or [[Rocket Festival]]. As this occurs during the hottest and driest season of the year, large homemade [[firework|rocket]]s are launched into the sky in an attempt to convince the celestial beings to send down [[rain]]. Traditionally, Buddhist [[monks]] made the rockets out of hollow bamboo tubes filled with [[gunpowder]] (among other things). Nowadays, lay people make the ''bang fai'' more like [[fireworks]] and hold competitions for the highest, fastest and most colorful rockets. The event takes place on both sides of the Mekhong River border between Thailand and the Lao People's Democratic Republic, and sometimes teams from the neighbouring countries will compete against each other. Tourists travel long distances to witness this now popular event.

===In Vietnam===
{{main|Huế Phật Đản shootings}}
Before 1975, the birthday of Buddha was a national public holiday in South Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://quangduc.com/lichsu/13nienbieupgvn3.html Niên biểu lịch sử Phật giáo Việt Nam] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115000946/http://quangduc.com/lichsu/13nienbieupgvn3.html |date=15 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;    It was a public festival with float and lantern parades on the streets. However, after the [[Fall of Saigon]], the day was no longer a public holiday.

===In Malaysia===
[[File:Wesak at Mara Vihara.jpg|thumb|300px|People thronged to the Maha Vihara Buddhist Temple during the Wesak Day celebration in [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]]]]
Celebrated by Buddhists to mark three momentous events in Buddha's life – his birth, enlightenment, and his departure from the human world, the Wesak celebration in Malaysia begins at dawn when devotees gather at Buddhist temples nationwide to meditate on the [[Eight Precepts]]. Donations - giving food to the needy and offerings of incense and joss sticks - and prayers are carried out. The sutras are chanted in unison by monks in saffron robes. The celebration is highlighted by a candle procession. Wesak Day in Malaysia is a national public holiday.

===In Bangladesh===

The Wesak Day is an important festival for most [[Bengali Buddhists]] if it is in Bangladesh, it is celebrated likely in [[Chittagong]], [[Dhaka]], and some other Buddhist places and people in Bangladesh. In Bangla language, it is known as Buddho Purnima. It is also a public holiday in Bangladesh.

===In Indonesia===
[[File:Borobudur on Vesak Day 2011.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Vesak Day celebration in Borobudur temple, Indonesia]]
This significant and traditional holy day is observed throughout Indonesia, where it is known as Waisak Day.&lt;ref name="Malik2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Akhtar Malik|title=Survey of Buddhist Temples and Monasteries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E5EkAQAAIAAJ|date=1 January 2007|publisher=Anmol Publications|isbn=978-81-261-3259-1|page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gupta2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sameer Das Gupta|title=Advanced history of Buddhism: monasteries and temples|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H4ckAQAAIAAJ|date=1 January 2008|publisher=Cyber Tech Publications|page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Borobudur]], thousands of Buddhist monks will join together to repeat mantras and meditate as they circuit the temple in a ritual called "Pradaksina". This is a form of tribute to the temple. Monks celebrate the special day by bottling holy water (which symbolises humility) and transporting flames (which symbolize light and enlightenment) from location to location. The monks also took part in the "Pindapata" ritual, where they received charity from the people of Indonesia. Waisak Day in Indonesia has been celebrated as a national public holiday every year since 1983.

===In Singapore===
In Singapore, Vesak Day was made a public holiday in 1955 after many public petitions, replacing [[Whit Monday]].&lt;ref name="Ong2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Y. D. Ong|title=Buddhism in Singapore: A Short Narrative History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=foIkAQAAIAAJ|date=1 January 2005|publisher=Skylark Publications|isbn=978-981-05-2740-2|page=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Piyasīlo1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=Piyasīlo|title=New Directions in Buddhism Today: Celebrating 30 Years of the Buddha Day Holidays, 1962-1992|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cWADAQAAIAAJ|year=1992|publisher=Community of Dharmafarers|isbn=978-983-9030-03-7|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LimLee2016"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jason Lim|author2=Terence Lee|title=Singapore: Negotiating State and Society, 1965-2015|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uks9DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA147|date=26 May 2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-33152-0|pages=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early decades of the 20th century, Vesak Day was associated with the Ceylonese community which then celebrated it along with their National Day in a two-day event. After World War II, there was a movement to make Vesak Day a public holiday, with the Singapore Buddhist Association leading the petitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/news/singapore/more-singapore-stories/story/5-things-about-vesak-day-20140512|title=Vesak Day: 5 things you should know about this Buddhist celebration|first=|last=migration|date=12 May 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===At the United Nations===
In 1999, the [[United Nations]] [[General Assembly]] adopted resolution 54/115, entitled 'International recognition of the Day of Vesak at United Nations Headquarters and other United Nations offices'. The resolution internationally recognized the Day of Vesak to acknowledge the contributions that Lord Buddha and Buddhism have made for over two and a half millennia. It also called for annual commemoration of the Day at the UN Headquarters, in New York, and other UN offices around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=United Nations News Service|title=Buddha's message of compassion 'timeless' says UN chief on international day|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=56719|accessdate=11 May 2017|work=UN News Service Section|agency=UN News Centre|publisher=United Nations|date=10 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International recognition of the Day of Vesak at United Nations Headquarters and other United Nations offices|url=https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/54/115|website=www.un.org|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Day of Vesak is an official holiday for the UN offices in many of the countries in South-East Asia.

The [[Tokyo]] {{Nihongo|'''Wonder Festival'''|ワンダーフェスティバル}}, or {{Nihongo|'''Wonfes'''|ワンフェス|wanfesu}} for short, is a semiannual (Feb, Aug) event held in the [[Makuhari Messe]], in [[Chiba, Chiba|Chiba]], Japan. The main focus is to display and sell "[[garage kit]]s", which are sculptures that usually replicate [[anime]] and game characters, but also popular [[mecha]]/sci-fi characters and creatures such as [[Kuratas]]. These models are extremely detail oriented, and many of these sculptures appear in very small quantities due to the amateur nature of their reproduction. Unusually skilled artisans are promoted specifically during the "wonder showcase" (WSC), in which their works are given special attention and limited quantities of their masterpieces are sold for high prices to avid collectors.&lt;ref&gt;''All 47 Garage Kit Masterpieces Chosen for “Wonder Show Case” in Past Ten Years''.
