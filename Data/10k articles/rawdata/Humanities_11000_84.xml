'''''A Black Moon Broods Over Lemuria''''', is [[Bal-Sagoth]]'s 1995 debut album after their 1993 demo. The album was recorded in a two-week period in June 1994, but due to label problems the album was released almost a year later. The name [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]] comes from a hypothetical land mass in the [[Indian Ocean]].
The keyboard intro on this album was written and performed by Keith Appleton, the proprietor of [[Academy Music Studio]], the studio where the album was recorded.&lt;ref&gt;''http://www.bal-sagoth.freeserve.co.uk/discography.html''{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 May 2016 the album was re-released by Cacophonous Records as a special edition CD featuring remastered audio, expanded lyric booklet, new sleeve notes and exclusive new artwork.

In January 2018 the album was issued as a limited edition cassette version by the Malaysian label Diabolicurst Productions under license from Cacophonous Records. The edition was limited to just 100 copies.

'''''A Night to Remember''''' is a 1955 non-fiction book by [[Walter Lord]] that depicts the [[Sinking of the RMS Titanic|sinking of the RMS ''Titanic'']] on 15 April 1912. The book was hugely successful, and is still considered a definitive resource about the [[RMS Titanic|''Titanic'']]. Lord interviewed 63 survivors of the disaster as well as drawing on books, memoirs, and articles that they had written. In 1986, Lord authored his follow-up book, ''The Night Lives On'', following renewed interest in the story after the [[wreck of the RMS Titanic|wreck of the ''Titanic'']] was discovered by [[Robert Ballard]].

The [[A Night to Remember (1958 film)|film based on the book]] and with advice from Lord, was released in 1958. Lord also served as a consultant to Canadian film director [[James Cameron]] while he was making his film ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' in 1997.

==Publication history==
Lord traveled on the [[RMS Olympic|RMS ''Olympic'']], ''Titanic''{{'}}s sister ship, when he was a boy and the experience gave him a lifelong fascination with the lost liner.{{sfn|Welshman|2012|pp=281}} As he later put it, he spent his time on the ''Olympic'' "prowling around" and trying to imagine "such a huge thing" sinking. He started reading about and drawing ''Titanic'' at the age of ten and spent many years collecting ''Titanic'' memorabilia, causing people to "take note of this oddity."{{sfn|Biel|1996|p=150}} He majored in history at [[Princeton University]] and graduated from [[Yale Law School]] before joining the New York-based advertising agency [[J. Walter Thompson]].{{sfn|Biel|1996|p=150}} Writing in his spare time, he interviewed 63 survivors of the disaster.{{sfn|Butler|1998|p=208}}

''A Night to Remember'' was only Lord's second book but was a huge success, thanks in no small part to the aggressive advertising campaign carried out by [[Henry Holt and Company|R &amp; W Holt]] following its launch in November 1955. The book also undoubtedly benefited from the popularity of the 1953 film ''[[Titanic (1953 film)|Titanic]]'' and other coverage of the disaster that was published around the same time.{{sfn|Biel|1996|p=150}} Within two months of its publication, the book had sold 60,000 copies and remained listed as a best-seller for six months. The ''[[Ladies' Home Journal]]'' and ''[[Reader's Digest]]'' both published condensed versions and it was selected in June 1956 by the [[Book of the Month Club]]. The first paperback edition was published by [[Bantam Books]] in October 1956.{{sfn|Welshman|2012|pp=281–2}}

Since then the book has never been out of print and has been translated into over a dozen languages. Its success enabled Lord to leave the world of advertising and become a full-time writer.{{sfn|Welshman|2012|pp=281–2}} After the discovery of the wreck of the ''Titanic'' in 1985 sparked a new wave of public interest in the disaster he wrote a follow-up book, ''The Night Lives On'' (1986). Daniel Allen Butler comments that "although it was of immense interest to ''Titanic'' buffs the world over, it lacked the spark of the original,"{{sfn|Butler|1998|p=208}} which by 1998 had reached its fiftieth printing.{{sfn|Biel|1996|p=151}}

==Critical commentaries==
[[File:Walter Lord.jpg|right|thumb|Walter Lord, author of ''A Night to Remember'', pictured in 1958]]
The book received widespread praise from contemporary critics. ''[[The New York Times]]'' called it "stunning ... one of the most exciting books of this or any other year".{{sfn|Welshman|2012|pp=282}}  The ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'' praised the book for doing "a magnificent job of re-creative chronicling, enthralling from the first word to the last."{{sfn|Welshman|2012|pp=282}}  ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' said that it was "seamless and skillful... it's clear why this is many a researcher's ''Titanic'' bible", while ''[[USA Today]]'' described it as "the most riveting narrative of the disaster."{{sfn|Welshman|2012|pp=282}}

The secret to Lord's success, according to the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]''{{'}}s critic Stanley Walker, was that he used "a kind of literary [[pointillism]], the arrangement of contrasting bits of fact and emotion in such a fashion that a vividly real impression of an event is conveyed to the reader."{{sfn|Welshman|2012|pp=282}} Walker highlighted the way that Lord had avoided telling the story through the prism of [[social class]], which had been the usual style of previous narratives, and instead successfully depicted the human element of the story by showing how those aboard reacted to the disaster whatever their class.{{sfn|Welshman|2012|pp=282}}

Steven Biel, an American cultural historian, notes the novelistic way in which Lord tells the story. The book depicts events through the eyes of multiple individuals, violating simple chronology to present an overlapping series of narratives. [[Nathaniel Philbrick]], writing in the introduction to the fiftieth anniversary edition of ''A Night to Remember'', notes that at the time of publication it was the first significant book about ''Titanic'' for nearly forty years. He argues that the book's hallmarks are its restraint, brevity and readability, which downplays the extravagant and mythical aspects of the disaster and instead puts in the foreground the stories of the people on the ship. The narrative builds suspense, making the reader care about the characters and revisit the disaster from their perspective.{{sfn|Welshman|2012|pp=283–4}} It tells the story in a highly visual and aural way, describing the sights and sounds of the night of the disaster "with the immediacy of a live broadcast or a television documentary", as Biel puts it.{{sfn|Biel|1996|p=151}}

A key to Lord's method is his technique of adopting an unconventional approach to the chronology of the event, "[taking] an imaginative approach to time and space in which hours and minutes prove extremely malleable, the ship itself seems almost infinitely complex, and the disaster assumes order and unity from far away."{{sfn|Biel|1996|p=152}} In short it is "a modernist narrative [constructed] around a modernist event."{{sfn|Biel|1996|p=152}} Reviewers highlighted the way in which Lord depicted the human side of the ''Titanic'' story, which ''The New York Times'' called "the core of Mr. Lord's account, and explains its fascination, a pull as powerful in its way as the last downward plunge of the ship itself."{{sfn|Biel|1996|p=156}} While the "legendary acts of gallantry" stood out, the book invites readers to put themselves in the place of those aboard and implicitly asks how they would react in the same situation.{{sfn|Biel|1996|p=156–7}} As ''Newsweek'' put it, "What would it be like to be aboard a sinking ocean liner?"{{sfn|Biel|1996|p=156–7}}

The significance of Lord's book, according to Biel, is that it "gave the disaster its fullest retelling since 1912 and made it speak to a modern mass audience and a new set of postwar concerns. In the creation of the ''Titanic'' myth there were two defining moments: 1912, of course, and 1955."{{sfn|Biel|1996|p=149}} Lord updates the popular interpretation of the ''Titanic'' disaster by portraying it in world-historical terms as the symbolic and actual end of an era, and as an event which "marked the end of a general feeling of confidence." Uncertainty replaced orderliness, and the ship's sinking marked the beginning of the twentieth century's "unending sequence of disillusionment. Before the ''Titanic'', all was quiet. Afterward, all was tumult."{{sfn|Biel|1996|p=155}} Biel notes that Lord's underlying theme is a rather nostalgic reflection of the "nobler instincts" exhibited in the disaster and their subsequent eclipse. Such ideals were attractive for a post-war society that celebrated the role of the [[nuclear family]] and the traditional roles of the male breadwinner and female homemaker.{{sfn|Biel|1996|p=155}}

Lord's invocation of an era of confidence and certainty was also a relevant theme at the height of the Cold War.{{sfn|Biel|1996|p=155}} The University of California sociologist Fred Davis comments that nostalgia "thrives ... on the rude transitions wrought by such phenomena as war, depression, civil disturbance, and cataclysmic natural disasters – in short, those events that cause masses of people to feel uneasy and to wonder whether the world and their being are quite what they always took them to be."{{sfn|Davis|1979|p=49}} The turmoil and uncertainty of the early [[Atomic Age]] and the onset of profound social changes made the old concepts of the nuclear family and traditional gender roles, reflected in the behaviour of ''Titanic''{{'}}s passengers, resonate with a mid-1950s audience.{{sfn|Biel|1996|p=157}}

The gradual nature of the disaster was also more comforting, in some respects, compared with the nature of modern technological failures such as air crashes. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''{{'}}s reviewer made this point explicitly: "This air age, when death comes too swiftly for heroism or with no survivors to record it, can still turn with wonder to an age before yesterday when a thousand deaths at sea seemed the very worst the world must suffer."{{sfn|Biel|1996|p=158}} It was, as Steven Biel comments, "a quainter kind of disaster" in which the victims had time to prepare and chose how to die.{{sfn|Biel|1996|p=157}}

==Screen adaptations==
The book has been adapted twice for the screen. The first production was staged as a live adaptation screened on 28 March 1956 by [[NBC]] TV and sponsored by [[Kraft Foods]] as part of the ''[[Kraft Television Theatre]]'' strand.{{sfn|Anderson|2005|p=97}} It has been described as "the biggest, most lavish, most expensive thing of its kind" attempted up to that point, with 31 sets, 107 actors, 72 speaking parts, 3,000 gallons of water and costing $95,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|95000|1956|r=1}}}} at present-day prices). [[George Roy Hill]] directed and [[Claude Rains]] provided a narration{{sfn|Biel|1996|p=151}} – a practice borrowed from radio dramas which provided a template for many television dramas of the time.{{sfn|Anderson|2005|p=98}} It took a similar approach to the book, lacking dominant characters and switching between a multiplicity of scenes. Rains' narration was used "to bridge the almost limitless number of sequences of life aboard the doomed liner", as a reviewer put it,{{sfn|Biel|1996|p=160}} and closed with his declaration that "never again has Man been so confident. An age had come to an end."{{sfn|Biel|1996|p=161}} The production was a major hit, attracting 28 million viewers, and greatly boosted the book's sales.{{sfn|Biel|1996|p=151}} It was rerun on [[kinescope]] on 2 May 1956, five weeks after its first broadcast.{{sfn|Anderson|2005|p=97}}{{sfn|Rasor|2001|p=119}}

The second adaptation was the 1958 British [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] ''[[A Night to Remember (1958 film)|A Night to Remember]]'' starring [[Kenneth More]], which is still widely regarded as "the definitive cinematic telling of the story."{{sfn|Heyer|2012|p=104}} The film came about after its eventual director, [[Roy Ward Baker]], and its producer, Belfast-born [[William MacQuitty]] both acquired copies of the book – Baker from his favorite bookshop and MacQuitty from his wife – and decided to obtain the film rights. MacQuitty had actually seen ''Titanic'' being launched on 31 May 1911 and still remembered the occasion vividly.{{sfn|Mayer|2004|p=31}} He met Lord and brought him on board the production as a consultant.{{sfn|Heyer|2012|p=149}} The film diverges from both the book and the NBC TV adaptation in focusing on a central character, Second Officer [[Charles Lightoller]], played by More. Its conclusion reflects Lord's world-historical theme of a "world changed for ever" with a fictional conversation between two survivors, Lightoller and Colonel [[Archibald Gracie IV|Archibald Gracie]], sitting on an overturned lifeboat. Lightoller declares that the disaster is "different ... Because we were so sure. Because even though it's happened, it's still unbelievable. I don't think I'll ever feel sure again. About anything."{{sfn|Biel|1996|p=161}}

==Collection==
After Lord died in 2002, he bequeathed to the [[National Maritime Museum]] in [[Greenwich, England]] his huge collection of manuscripts, original letters and ''Titanic'' memorabilia, which he had gathered during his life and used to write ''A Night to Remember''. MacQuitty also donated items from his own collection of material related to the film. Items from the collection are on display at the museum and can be accessed by researchers.{{sfn|National Maritime Museum|7 April 2003}}

'''Acerra''' {{IPA-it|aˈtʃɛrra|}} is a town and ''[[commune]]'' of [[Campania]], southern Italy, in the [[Metropolitan City of Naples]], about {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=off}} northeast of the capital in [[Naples]]. It is part of the Agro Acerrano plain.

==History==
Acerra is one of the most ancient cities of the region, probably founded by the [[Osci]] with the name of '''''Akeru''''' ({{lang-la|Acerrae}}, {{lang-grc|Ἀχέρραι}}). It first appears in history as an independent city during the great war of the Campanians and Latins against [[Rome]]; shortly after the conclusion of which, in 332 BC, the Acerrani, in common with several other Campanian cities, obtained the Roman "civitas," but without the right of suffrage. The period at which this latter privilege was granted them is not mentioned, but it is certain that they ultimately obtained the full rights of Roman citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Livy|8.17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Second Punic War]] it was faithful to the Roman alliance, on which account it was besieged by [[Hannibal]] in 216 BC, and being abandoned by the inhabitants in despair, was plundered and burnt. But after the expulsion of Hannibal from Campania, the Acerrani, with the consent of the Roman senate, returned to and rebuilt their city in 210 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Livy|23.17, 27.3.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acerra served as a Roman base during the [[Social War (91–88 BC)|Social War]] in 90 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Canby, Courtland. ''The Encyclopedia of Historic Places''. (New York: Facts of File Publications, 1984) p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; During the Social War it was besieged by the [[Samnium|Samnite]] general, [[Gaius Papius Mutilus]], but offered so vigorous a resistance that he was unable to reduce it.&lt;ref&gt;[[Appian]], ''B.C.'' 1.42, 45.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Virgil]] praises the fertility of its territory, but the town itself had suffered so much from the frequent inundations of the river [[Clanius]], on which it was situated, that it was in his time almost deserted.&lt;ref&gt;Virg. ''G.'' 2.225; and Servius ''ad loc.''; [[Silius Italicus|Sil. Ital.]] 8.537.&lt;/ref&gt; It subsequently received a colony under [[Augustus]],&lt;ref&gt;Lib. Colon. p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Strabo]] speaks of it in conjunction with [[Nola]] and [[Nuceria]], apparently as a place of some consequence. It does not seem, however, to have retained its colonial rank, but is mentioned by Pliny as an ordinary municipal town.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Strabo|v. pp. 247, 249}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Pliny|3.5.9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 826 the [[Lombards]] built here a castle, later destroyed by [[Bono of Naples]]. In 881 it was sacked by the [[Saracens]]. Later it was a [[italo-Norman|Norman]] possession, the seat of a county. As part of the [[Kingdom of Naples]], it was a fief of the Aquino, the Origlia, the Orsini del Balzo and, from 1496 until 1812, the Cardenas. From 1927 it was part of the province of [[Terra di Lavoro]]. On 1 October 1943, whilst the city was occupied by the forces of [[Nazi Germany]], the Germans massacred 110 civilians, in one of the bloodiest massacres in Campania; a memorial was erected to the victims.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oblomagazine.net/magazine/2012/10/08/eccidio-nazista-del-1943-sistemata-e-scoperta-una-lapide-a-memoria-della-strage/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''American Civil War Museum''' is a multi-site museum in the [[Greater Richmond Region]] of central [[Virginia]], dedicated to the history of the [[American Civil War]]. The museum operates three sites: [[White House of the Confederacy|The Museum and White House of the Confederacy]] and the [[Tredegar Iron Works#American Civil War Center at Historic Tredegar|American Civil War Center at Historic Tredegar]] in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], and the Museum of the Confederacy&amp;ndash;[[Appomattox, Virginia|Appomattox]]. It maintains a comprehensive collection of artifacts, manuscripts, [[Confederate imprint]]s (books and pamphlets), and photographs.

In November 2013, the Museum of the Confederacy and the American Civil War Center at Historic Tredegar merged, creating the American Civil War Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Calos|first=Katherine|title=Civil War center, Confederacy museum join forces|url=http://www.timesdispatch.com/news/local/civil-war-center-confederacy-museum-join-forces/article_0295cb9f-fd5a-5177-98e8-0e1f5f46a6c2.html|accessdate=14 March 2014|newspaper=[[Richmond Times-Dispatch]]|date=November 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its current name was announced in January 2014.&lt;ref name="Boyd CWN FM 2014"&gt;{{cite news|last=Boyd|first=Scott C.|title=‘American Civil War Museum’ Is The Name For Richmond Civil War Entity|url=http://www.civilwarnews.com/archive/articles/2014/febmar/museum-021405.htm|accessdate=14 March 2014|newspaper=[[Civil War News]]|date=February–March 2014| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306192101/http://www.civilwarnews.com/archive/articles/2014/febmar/museum-021405.htm| archivedate=March 6, 2016 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Museum of the Confederacy ==

The Museum of the Confederacy was founded in 1894, 29 years after [[Battle of Appomattox Court House#Surrender|Lee's surrender in Appomattox]]. It is located in the historic home that served as the [[White House of the Confederacy]], two blocks north of the [[Virginia State Capitol]], which the [[Ladies Hollywood Memorial Association]] saved from destruction. It opened as the Confederate Museum and White House of the Confederacy in 1896, on February 22, the date of [[Jefferson Davis]]'s inauguration. The historic home was named a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1963 and [[Virginia Historic Landmark]] in 1966. A new building next door was built in 1976 to house the expanding collection (and a 12-year restoration of the historic home began). The Museum maintains a collection of flags, weapons, documents, and personal effects related to the Confederacy, and offers tours of the home restored to its 1861–65 appearance. In 2006, museum officials announced that neither the museum nor the home would be moved.&lt;ref name=wapo&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tucker|title=Swept Away By History|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/03/AR2007040301915.html|publisher=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="moc.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moc.org/about-us/extended-history|title=The Extended History - Museum of the Confederacy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum houses more than 15,000 documents and artifacts along with 500 original, wartime, battle flags from the failed [[Confederate States of America]]. Among the thousands of other important pieces found there are items owned by [[Jefferson Davis]], [[Robert Edward Lee]], [[Joseph E. Johnston]], [[John Bell Hood]], [[Thomas Jonathan Jackson]], [[Simon Bolivar Buckner]], [[J.E.B. Stuart]], [[Joseph Wheeler]], [[Wade Hampton III|Wade Hampton]], [[Lewis Armistead]], and [[Raphael Semmes]].  The provisional Confederate Constitution and the Great Seal of the Confederacy are also housed there.

[[Image:CSS Virginia Anchor.jpg|thumb|right|Anchor of the CSS Virginia]] A newer building to better preserve and exhibit the museum's collections was built and opened in 1976 immediately adjacent to the White House, on its remaining 3/4 acre (3,000 m²) property. The anchor of the first [[ironclad warship]], [[CSS Virginia|CSS ''Virginia'']], which fought the {{USS|Monitor}} in the [[Battle of Hampton Roads]] on March 9, 1862, is prominently displayed in front of the Museum.

The White House was closed in 1976, to be fully restored to its wartime appearance.  The restoration project was completed in 1988, and reopened for public tours in June 1988.  The White House featured extensive reproduction wall coverings and draperies, as well as significant numbers of original White House furnishings from the Civil War period.

Notable past and present exhibitions include: ''The Confederate Years: Battles, Leaders, and Soldiers, 1861–1865''; ''Women in Mourning''; ''Before Freedom Came: African-American Life in the Antebellum South''; ''Embattled Emblem: The Army of Northern Virginia Battle Flag, 1861 – Present''; ''A Woman's War: Southern Women, Civil War, and the Confederate Legacy''; ''R. E. Lee: The Exhibition''; ''The Confederate Navy''; and ''Virginia and the Confederacy: A Quadricentennial Perspective''.

===History===
The Museum of the Confederacy was founded by Richmond's society ladies, starting with Isabel Maury, who was later joined by Ann Crenshaw Grant and Isobel Stewart Bryan. Isabel Maury was the founder of the Museum of the Confederacy but she also was the first Regent of the [[Confederate Memorial Literary Society]] (CMLS). The Isabel Maury Planned Giving Society continues the work of Mrs. Isabel Maury, daughter of Robert Henry Maury, who, with the Relics Committee, was instrumental in securing much of the Museum's current collection.

By the centennial anniversary of the Civil War, the museum's governing board determined that it wanted to see the museum evolve from a shrine to a more modern museum. In 1963, the CMLS hired its first museum professional as executive director, and in 1970, changed the name of the institution to "The Museum of the Confederacy." Visitors peaked at 91,000 per year in the early 1990s but were down to around 51,000 in the early 2000s.&lt;ref name=wapo/&gt;

===White House of the Confederacy===
{{Main|White House of the Confederacy}}
[[Image:LC-B815-911 Rt side stereoview 1865 LOC.JPG|thumb|White House of the Confederacy, 1865, Library of Congress]]
The White House of the Confederacy is a gray stuccoed neoclassical mansion built in 1818 by [[John Brockenbrough]], who was president of the Bank of Virginia. Designed by [[Robert Mills (architect)|Robert Mills]], Brockenbrough’s private residence was built in early nineteenth century on East Clay Street in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]'s affluent [[Shockoe Hill]] neighborhood (later known as the [[Court End]] District), and was two blocks north of the Virginia State Capitol.

[[President of the Confederate States of America]] [[Jefferson Davis]], his wife [[Varina Howell|Varina]], and their children moved into the house in August 1861, and lived there for the remainder of the war. President Davis maintained an at-home office on the second floor of the White House due to his poor health.

The house was abandoned during the evacuation of Richmond on April 2, 1865.  Within twelve hours, soldiers from Major General [[Godfrey Weitzel]]’s XVIII Corps seized the former Confederate White House, intact. During his tour of Richmond, President [[Abraham Lincoln]] visited Davis's former residence, and it was where Union officers held a number of meetings with local officials in the aftermath. During [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction]], the building served as part of the headquarters for Military District Number One (Virginia), and was occasionally used as the residence of the commanding officer of the Department of Virginia.

Following the end of Reconstruction, the House became a school -- the Richmond Central School. When the city announced its plans to demolish the building to make way for a more modern school building in 1890, the Confederate Memorial Literary Society was formed with the purpose of saving the White House from destruction.

==The American Civil War Museum &amp;ndash; Appomattox==
[[File:Robert E Lee deathmask.jpg|thumb|Death mask of Robert E. Lee, on display at the Appomattox museum]]
Opened in 2012 as the Museum of the Confederacy &amp;ndash; Appomattox, in [[Appomattox, Virginia]], adjacent to the [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park]], the American Civil War Museum - Appomattox tells the stories of the closing days of the Civil War, and the beginnings of our country’s journey toward reuniting as Americans. The Museum is situated on eight acres of land and contains 5,000 square feet for exhibits.&lt;ref name="Our History"&gt;{{cite web|title=American Civil War Museum, Our History|url=https://acwm.org/about-us/our-story}}&lt;/ref&gt; The location changed its name in 2017 as part of the transition into the American Civil War Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Tyree |first1=Elizabeth |title=Appomattox Civil War Museum re-brands to tell the whole story of the war |url=https://wset.com/news/local/appomattox-civil-war-museum-re-brands-to-tell-the-whole-story-of-the-war |accessdate=July 10, 2018 |agency=ABC |publisher=WSET |date=August 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historic Tredegar==
{{Main|Tredegar Iron Works}}

Historic Tredegar, home to The American Civil War Center, traces its roots to 1836, when Francis B. Deane founded Tredegar Iron Works. He named his Richmond plant for a [[Wales|Welsh]] town and iron works. In 1841 Deane hired Joseph Reid Anderson as commercial sales agent.  Under Joseph Reid Anderson’s ownership, Tredegar manufactured an array of items including locomotives, train wheels, spikes, cables, ships, boilers, naval hardware, iron machinery, and brass items.&lt;ref name="Our History" /&gt;

==Future expansion==
The museum plans to construct a major new building on the site of the historic Tredegar Iron Works in downtown Richmond. The new building will feature more than 7,000 square feet of new gallery space for permanent and changing exhibitions of items from the museum’s renowned collections of Civil War artifacts, as well as an “immersion theater” highlighting Richmond’s role in the war. The 8.9 acre site also will feature a new outdoor exhibit, living history demonstrations, and a new Family Resource Center, to be located in the historic Administration Building. Groundbreaking and site preparation for the outdoor exhibit will take place in early 2015. Those projects, which are scheduled to take six months, also will include a reconfiguration of the site’s landscaping, repair of the historic canal wall and leveling of the grounds on the site’s upper level. The exhibit galleries at Historic Tredegar will remain open to the public throughout the outdoor construction, including the “In the Cause of Liberty” exhibit in the historic Foundry Building, and the Richmond National Battlefield Park Visitor Center, located in the historic Pattern Building. Groundbreaking and construction for the new building is tentatively scheduled to begin in late 2015 and complete by early 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Civil War Museum, Nov 5 2014 Expansion|url=https://acwm.org/about-us/for-the-media/news-release/american-civil-war-museum-releases-updated-expansion-schedule}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connections to scholars==
Several prominent Civil War historians have had connections to the museum. [[Douglas Southall Freeman]], the biographer of [[George Washington]] and [[Robert E. Lee]], started his career at the museum. [[William C. Davis (historian)|Jack Davis]], [[Emory M. Thomas]], and [[Harvard University]] President [[Drew Gilpin Faust]] have all done research there. [[James I. Robertson, Jr.]], of [[Virginia Tech]], [[Edwin C. Bearss]], Historian Emeritus of the [[National Park Service]], and [[William J. Cooper]] of LSU, have each served as members of the museum’s governing board.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17422">{{Other uses|Anaphora (disambiguation){{!}}Anaphora}}
In [[linguistics]], '''anaphora''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|n|æ|f|ər|ə}}) is the use of an expression whose interpretation depends upon another expression in context (its [[Antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]] or postcedent). In a narrower sense, anaphora is the use of an expression that depends specifically upon an antecedent expression and thus is contrasted with [[cataphora]], which is the use of an expression that depends upon a postcedent expression. The anaphoric (referring) term is called an '''anaphor'''. For example, in the sentence ''Sally arrived, but nobody saw her'', the [[pronoun]] ''her'' is an anaphor, referring back to the antecedent ''Sally''. In the sentence ''Before her arrival, nobody saw Sally'', the pronoun ''her'' refers forward to the postcedent ''Sally'', so ''her'' is now a ''cataphor'' (and an anaphor in the broader, but not the narrower, sense). Usually, an anaphoric expression is a [[proform]] or some other kind of [[deixis|deictic]] (contextually-dependent) expression.&lt;ref&gt;Tognini-Bonelli (2001:70) writes that "an anaphor is a linguistic entity which indicates a referential tie to some other linguistic entity in the same text".&lt;/ref&gt; Both anaphora and cataphora are species of [[endophora]], referring to something mentioned elsewhere in a dialog or text.

Anaphora is an important concept for different reasons and on different levels: first, anaphora indicates how [[discourse]] is constructed and maintained; second, anaphora binds different [[Syntax|syntactical]] elements together at the level of the sentence; third, anaphora presents a challenge to [[natural language processing]] in [[computational linguistics]], since the identification of the reference can be difficult; and fourth, anaphora tells some things about how language is understood and processed, which is relevant to fields of linguistics interested in [[cognitive psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;The four ways just listed in which anaphora is important for linguistics are from McEnery (2000:3).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nomenclature and examples ==

The term ''anaphora'' is actually used in two ways.

In a broad sense, it denotes the act of referring. Any time a given expression (e.g. a proform) refers to another contextual entity, anaphora is present.

In a second, narrower sense, the term ''anaphora'' denotes the act of referring backwards in a dialog or text, such as referring to the left when an anaphor points to its left toward its antecedent in languages that are written from left to right. Etymologically, ''anaphora'' derives from [[Ancient Greek]] ἀναφορά (anaphorá, "a carrying back"), from ἀνά (aná, "up") + φέρω (phérō, "I carry"). In this narrow sense, anaphora stands in contrast to [[cataphora]], which sees the act of referring forward in a dialog or text, or pointing to the right in languages that are written from left to right: Ancient Greek καταφορά (kataphorá, "a downward motion"), from κατά (katá, "downwards") + φέρω (phérō, "I carry"). A proform is a cataphor when it points to its right toward its postcedent. Both effects together are called either anaphora (broad sense) or less ambiguously, along with [[self-reference]] they comprise the category of endophora.&lt;ref&gt;Concerning the term ''endophora'', see Bussmann et al. (1998:58f.).&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of anaphora (in the narrow sense) and cataphora are given next. Anaphors and cataphors appear in bold, and their antecedents and postcedents are underlined:

::&lt;u&gt;'''Anaphora''' (in the narrow sense, species of endophora)&lt;/u&gt;

::a. Susan dropped &lt;u&gt;the plate&lt;/u&gt;. '''It''' shattered loudly. &lt;small&gt;- The pronoun ''it'' is an anaphor; it points to the left toward its antecedent ''the plate''.&lt;/small&gt;

::b. &lt;u&gt;The music stopped&lt;/u&gt;, and '''that''' upset everyone. &lt;small&gt;- The demonstrative pronoun ''that'' is an anaphor; it points to the left toward its antecedent ''The music stopped''.&lt;/small&gt;

::c. Fred was &lt;u&gt;angry&lt;/u&gt;, and '''so''' was I. &lt;small&gt;- The adverb ''so'' is an anaphor; it points to the left toward its antecedent ''angry''.&lt;/small&gt;

::d. If Sam &lt;u&gt;buys a new bike&lt;/u&gt;, I will '''do it''' as well. &lt;small&gt;- The verb phrase ''do it'' is an anaphor; it points to the left toward its antecedent ''buys a new bike''.&lt;/small&gt;

::&lt;u&gt;'''Cataphora''' (included in the broad sense of anaphora, species of endophora)&lt;/u&gt;

::a. Because '''he''' was very cold, &lt;u&gt;David&lt;/u&gt; put on his coat. &lt;small&gt;- The pronoun ''he'' is a cataphor; it points to the right toward its postcedent ''David''.&lt;/small&gt;

::b. '''His''' friends have been criticizing &lt;u&gt;Jim&lt;/u&gt; for exaggerating. &lt;small&gt;- The possessive adjective ''his'' is a cataphor; it points to the right toward its postcedent ''Jim''.&lt;/small&gt;

::c. Although Sam might '''do so''', I will not &lt;u&gt;buy a new bike&lt;/u&gt;. &lt;small&gt;- The verb phrase ''do so'' is a cataphor; it points to the right toward its postcedent ''buy a new bike''.&lt;/small&gt;

::d. In '''their''' free time, &lt;u&gt;the kids&lt;/u&gt; play video games. &lt;small&gt;- The possessive adjective ''their'' is a cataphor; it points to the right toward its postcedent ''the kids''.
&lt;/small&gt;

A further distinction is drawn between endophoric and [[exophora|exophoric reference]]. Exophoric reference occurs when an expression, an exophor, refers to something that is not directly present in the linguistic context, but is rather present in the situational context. Deictic proforms are stereotypical exophors, e.g.

::&lt;u&gt;'''Exophora'''&lt;/u&gt;

::a. '''This''' garden hose is better than '''that''' one. &lt;small&gt;- The demonstrative adjectives ''this'' and ''that'' are exophors; they point to entities in the situational context.&lt;/small&gt;

::b. Jerry is standing over '''there'''. &lt;small&gt;- The adverb ''there'' is an exophor; it points to a location in the situational context.&lt;/small&gt;

Exophors cannot be anaphors as they do not substantially refer within the dialog or text, though there is a question of what portions of a conversation or document are accessed by a listener or reader with regard to whether all references to which a term points within that language stream are noticed (i.e., if you hear only a fragment of what someone says using the pronoun ''her'', you may never discover who ''she'' is, though if you heard the rest of what the speaker was saying on the same occasion, you might discover who ''she'' is, either by anaphoric revelation or by exophoric implication because you realize who ''she'' must be according to what else is said about ''her'' even if ''her'' identity is not explicitly mentioned, as in the case of [[Homophora|homophoric reference]]).

A listener might, for example, realize through listening to other clauses and sentences that ''she'' is ''a Queen'' because of some of her attributes or actions mentioned. But which queen? Homophoric reference occurs when a generic phrase obtains a specific meaning through knowledge of its context. For example, the referent of the phrase ''the Queen'' (using an emphatic [[definite article]], not the less specific ''a Queen'', but also not the more specific ''Queen Elizabeth'') must be determined by the context of the utterance, which would identify the identity of the queen in question. Until further revealed by additional contextual words, gestures, images or other [[media (communication)|media]], a listener may not even know what monarchy or historical period is being discussed, and even after hearing ''her'' name is ''Elizabeth'' does not know, even if an English-UK Queen Elizabeth becomes indicated, if this queen means ''Queen Elizabeth I'' or ''Queen Elizabeth II'' and must await further clues in additional communications. Similarly, in discussing 'The Mayor' (of a city), the Mayor's identity must be understood broadly through the context which the speech references as general 'object' of understanding; is a particular human person meant, a current or future or past office-holder, the office in a strict legal sense, or the office in a general sense which includes activities a mayor might conduct, might even be expected to conduct, while they may not be explicitly defined for this office.

== In generative grammar ==
{{see also|Binding (linguistics)|Government and binding theory}}
The term ''anaphor'' is used in a special way in the [[generative grammar]] tradition of [[Chomsky]] and his followers. Here it denotes what would normally be called a [[reflexive pronoun|reflexive]] or [[reciprocal pronoun|reciprocal]] pronoun, such as ''himself'' or ''each other'' in English, and analogous forms in other languages. The use of the term ''anaphor'' in this narrow sense is unique to generative grammar, and in particular, to the traditional [[binding (linguistics)|binding]] theory.&lt;ref&gt;The traditional binding theory is associated above all with Chomsky's analysis from the early 1980s (Chomsky 1981).&lt;/ref&gt; This theory investigates the syntactic relationship that can or must hold between a given proform and its antecedent (or postcedent). In this respect, anaphors (reflexive and reciprocal pronouns) behave very differently from, for instance, personal pronouns.&lt;ref&gt;See Büring (2005) for an introduction to and discussion of anaphors (in the sense of generative grammar) in the traditional binding theory.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Complement anaphora ==
In some cases, anaphora may refer not to its usual antecedent, but to its [[Complement (linguistics)|complement]] set. In the following example a, the anaphoric pronoun ''they'' refers to the children who are eating the ice-cream. Contrastingly, example b has ''they'' seeming to refer to the children who are not eating ice-cream:

::a. Only a &lt;u&gt;few of the children&lt;/u&gt; ate their ice-cream. '''They''' ate the strawberry flavor first. &lt;small&gt;- '''They''' meaning the children who ate ice-cream&lt;/small&gt;

::b. Only a &lt;u&gt;few of the children&lt;/u&gt; ate their ice-cream. '''They''' threw it around the room instead. &lt;small&gt;- '''They''' meaning either the children who did not eat ice-cream or perhaps the children who did not eat ice-cream and some of those who ate ice-cream but did not finish it or who threw around the ice-cream of those who did not eat it, or even all the children, those who ate ice-cream throwing around part of their ice-cream, the ice-cream of others, the same ice-cream which they may have eaten before or after throwing it, or perhaps only some of the children so that '''they''' does not mean to be all-inclusive&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref name="The Interpretation of Complement Anaphora: The Case of The Others by Nobuaki, Ursini"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/U11-1017 | title=The Interpretation of Complement Anaphora: The Case of The Others | publisher=Proceedings of Australasian Language Technology Association Workshop | date=2011 | accessdate=28 July 2015 | authors=Nobuaki, Akagi, Ursini, Francesco-Alessio, both Centre for Cognition and its Disorders (CCD), Macquarie University | pages=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its narrower definition, an anaphoric pronoun must refer to some noun (phrase) that has already been introduced into the discourse. In complement anaphora cases, however, the anaphor refers to something that is not yet present in the discourse, since the pronoun's referent has not been formerly introduced, including the case of 'everything but' what has been introduced. The set of ice-cream-eating-children in example b is introduced into the discourse, but then the pronoun ''they'' refers to the set of non-ice-cream-eating-children, a set which has not been explicitly mentioned.&lt;ref name="Complement Anaphora and Interpretation by Rick Nouwens"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://jos.oxfordjournals.org/content/20/1/73.short | title=Complement Anaphora and Interpretation | publisher=Journal of Semantics | work=Volume 20, Issue 1 Pp. 73-113. | accessdate=28 July 2015 | author=Nouwen, Rick }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both [[semantic]] and [[pragmatics]] considerations attend this phenomenon, which following [[discourse representation theory]] since the early 1980s, such as work by Kamp (1981) and Heim (File  Change  Semantics, 1982), and [[generalized quantifier theory]], such as work by Barwise and Cooper (1981), was studied in a series of psycholinguistic experiments in the early 1990s by Moxey and Sanford (1993) and Sanford et al. (1994).&lt;ref name="The Interpretation of Complement Anaphora: The Case of The Others by Nobuaki, Ursini"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Communicating quantities: A psycho-logical perspective by Moxey, Sanford"&gt;{{cite web | title=Communicating quantities: A psycho-logical perspective | publisher=Laurence Erlbaum Associates | date=1993 | author=Moxey, L |author2=Sanford, A}}&lt;/ref&gt; In complement anaphora as in the case of the pronoun in example b, this anaphora refers to some sort of complement set (i.e. only to the set of non-ice-cream-eating-children) or to the [[maximal set]] (i.e. to all the children, both ice-cream-eating-children and non-ice-cream-eating-children) or some hybrid or variant set, including potentially one of those noted to the right of example b. The various possible referents in complement anaphora are discussed by Corblin (1996), Kibble (1997), and Nouwen (2003).&lt;ref name="Complement Anaphora and Interpretation by Rick Nouwens"/&gt; Resolving complement anaphora is of interest in shedding light on brain access to [[information]], [[calculation]], [[mental model]]ing, [[communication]].&lt;ref name="Resolving Complement Anaphora by Hadas Kotek"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hkotek.com/Kotek%20-%20Resolving%20complement%20anaphora.pdf | title=Resolving Complement Anaphora | publisher=Proceedings of the Second Workshop on Anaphora Resolution (2008) | work=SSN 1736-6305 Vol. 2 | accessdate=28 July 2015 | author=Kotek, Hadas }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Mental models and the interpretation of anaphora | publisher=Hove, UK: Psychology Press | date=2001 | author=Garnham, A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anaphora resolution – centering theory ==
There are many theories that attempt to prove how anaphors are related and trace back to their antecedents, with centering theory (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1983) being one of them. Taking the computational theory of mind view of language, centering theory gives a computational analysis of underlying antecedents. In their original theory, Grosz, Joshi, &amp; Weinstein (1983) propose that some discourse entities in utterances are more 'central' than others, and this degree of centrality imposes constraints on what can be the antecedent. 

In the theory, there are different types of centers: forward facing, backwards facing, and preferred. 

=== Forward facing centers ===

A ranked list of discourse entities in an utterance. The ranking is debated, some focusing on theta relations (Yıldırım et al. 2004) and some providing definitive lists.

=== Backwards facing center ===

The highest ranked discourse entity in the previous utterance. 

=== Preferred center ===

The highest ranked discourse entity in the previous utterance realised in the current utterance.

'''Anasyrma''' ({{lang-grc|ἀνάσυρμα}}) composed of ἀνά ''ana'' "up, against, back", and σύρμα ''syrma'' "skirt"; plural: '''anasyrmata''' ({{lang|grc|ἀνασύρματα}}), also called '''anasyrmos''' ({{lang|grc|ἀνασυρμός}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Blackledge |first=Catherine |year=2009 |title=The Story of V: A Natural History of Female Sexuality |location=New Brunswick, New Jersey |publisher=Rutgers University Press |page=12 |isbn=978-0813534558}}&lt;!-- year was given as 2003, might be error, might be earlier edition--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[gesture]] of lifting the [[skirt]] or [[kilt]]. It is used in connection with certain [[religion|religious]] [[ritual]]s, eroticism, and lewd jokes (see, for example, [[Baubo]]). The term is used in describing corresponding works of [[art]]. Anasyrma differs from "flashing", a physically similar gesture as an act of [[exhibitionism]], in that an exhibitionist has an implied purpose of his/her own sexual arousal, while anasyrma is done only for the effect on the onlookers.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Anasyrma is effectively "the exposing of the genitals". This is a form of exhibitionism found in religion or artwork, rather than a display for arousal, and it always refers to the act of a woman exposing herself. The act of lifting up one's skirt to display the genitals can be an [[:en:wiktionary:apotropaic|apotropaic]] device; it can, in circumstances of war, evoke the fear of the enemy. It can also be an act that evokes surprise and subsequent laughter and a letting go of sadness. What is significant about anasyrma is that it reflects the numinous quality of the female genitals and the genital region through which birth ensues. In several cultures, there is a myth of anasyrma used for emotional healing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Miriam Robbins Dexter |author2=Victor H. Mair |title=Sacred Display: Divine and Magical Female Figures of Eurasia |publisher=Cambria Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-1604976748}}{{page needed|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anasyrma may be a deliberately provocative self-exposing of one's naked [[genitals]] or [[buttocks]]. The famous example of the latter case is [[Aphrodite Kallipygos]] ("Aphrodite of the beautiful buttocks"). In many traditions, this gesture also has an [[apotrope|apotropaic]] character, as a mockery or means to ward off a supernatural enemy, analogous to [[mooning]].

==Greek antiquity==
[[Image:Ermafrodito pubblicato in Marjon van der Meulen, Rubens Copies after the Antique.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Hermaphroditus|Ermafrodito]] ''anasyromenos'' sketch by [[Peter Paul Rubens]].]]
Ritual jesting and intimate exposure were common in the cults of [[Demeter]] and [[Dionysus]], and figure in the celebration of the [[Eleusinian mysteries]] associated with these divinities. The mythographer [[Apollodorus of Athens|Apollodorus]] says that Iambe's jesting was the reason for the practice of ritual jesting at the [[Thesmophoria]], a festival celebrated in honor of Demeter and Persephone. In other versions of the myth of Demeter, the goddess is received by a woman named Baubo, a [[crone]] who makes her laugh by exposing herself, in a ritual gesture called anasyrma ("lifting [of skirts]"). A set of statuettes from [[Priene]], a Greek city on the west coast of Asia Minor, are usually identified as "[[Baubo]]" figurines, representing the female body as the face conflated with the lower part of the abdomen. These appeared as counterparts to the [[phallus]]es decorated with eyes, mouth, and sometimes legs, that appeared on vase paintings and were made as statuettes.

Terracotta [[hermaphrodite]] figurines in the so-called ''anasyromenos'' pose, with female breasts and a long garment lifted to reveal male genitals have been found from [[Sicily]] to [[Lesbos]], dating back to the late [[Classical Greece|Classical]] and early [[Hellenistic period]]. The ''anasyromenos'' pose, however, was not invented in the 4th century BCE, figures of this type drew on a much earlier [[Eastern world|eastern]] [[Iconography|iconographic]] tradition employed for female divinities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ik-morphomata.uni-koeln.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Fluide%20Ko%CC%88rper/Ajootian_abstract%26CV.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216191227/http://www.ik-morphomata.uni-koeln.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Fluide%20Ko%CC%88rper/Ajootian_abstract%26CV.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-12-16 |author=Aileen Ajootian |title=Hermaphroditos ανασυρόμενος: Revealing the Body |publisher=University of Mississippi |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient literature suggests that the figures represent the androgynous Cypriot deity [[Aphroditus]] (possibly a form of [[Astarte]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/2005-ashtoreth#anchor4|title=Ashtoreth: In Arabia|publisher=[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=2013-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose cult was introduced into mainland Greece between the 5th–4th century BCE. The revealed [[phallus]] was believed to have [[apotropaic magic]]al powers, averting the [[evil eye]] or ''[[invidia]]'' and bestowing [[good luck]].

==Apotropaic effect of nakedness==
Many historical references suggest that anasyrma had dramatic or supernatural effect—positive or negative. [[Pliny the Elder]] wrote that a [[menstruating]] woman who uncovers her body can scare away [[hailstorms]], whirlwinds and lightning. If she strips naked and walks around the field, caterpillars, worms and beetles fall off the ears of corn. Even when not menstruating, she can lull a storm out at sea by stripping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pliny the Younger|title=Natural History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R5QVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA262&amp;lpg=PA262&amp;dq=hailstorms+whirlwinds+and+lightnings+will+even+be+scared+away+by+a+woman+uncovering+her+body#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|chapter=xxviii. c.23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to folklore, women lifted their skirts to chase off enemies in [[Ireland]] and [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=10 Questions: Miriam Robbins Dexter on the Power of Female Display |publisher=UCLA Program on Central Asia |date=October 6, 2010 |url=http://www.international.ucla.edu/asia/centralasia/article/117670 |accessdate=2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; A story from ''[[The Irish Times]]'' (September 23, 1977) reported a potentially violent incident involving several men, which was averted by a woman exposing her genitals to the attackers. According to [[Balkans|Balkan]] folklore, when it rained too much, women would run into the fields and lift their skirts to scare the gods and end the rain.

Associated carvings, called [[sheela na gig]]s, were common on medieval churches in northern Europe and the British Isles.

In some nations of [[Africa]], a woman stripping naked and displaying herself is still considered a curse and a means to ward off evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Alexis Okeowo | title = The Ivory Coast Effect | url = http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-ivory-coast-effect | date = March 21, 2011 | work = The New Yorker | accessdate = 2011-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; As women give life, they can take it away. In [[Nigeria]], among other places, women invoked the curse only under the most extreme circumstances, and men who are exposed are considered dead. No one will cook for them, marry them, enter into any kind of contract with them or buy anything from them. The curse extends to foreign men as well, who will go impotent or suffer some great harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imow.org/wpp/stories/viewStory?storyId=1098 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080525164953/http://www.imow.org/wpp/stories/viewStory?storyId=1098 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-05-25 |title=The Curse of Nakedness |publisher=Imow.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Antitheism''' (sometimes '''anti-theism''') is the opposition to [[theism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://atheism.about.com/od/atheismatheiststheism/a/AntiTheism.htm |title=Atheism and Anti-Theism: What's the Difference? What is Anti-Theism? |author=Austin Cline |publisher=[[About.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/antitheism |title=antitheism |publisher=[[The Free Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has had a range of applications.  In [[secularism|secular]] contexts, it typically refers to direct opposition to the belief in any [[deity]].

==Opposition to theism==
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines ''antitheist'' as "One opposed to belief in the existence of a god". The earliest citation given for this meaning dates from 1833.&lt;ref&gt;The Shorter OED (1970 reprint) page 78&lt;/ref&gt; 
''Antitheism'' has been adopted as a label by those who regard theism as dangerous, destructive, or encouraging of harmful behavior. [[Christopher Hitchens]] offers an example of this approach in ''[[Letters to a Young Contrarian]]'' (2001), in which he writes: "I'm not even an [[Atheism|atheist]] so much as I am an antitheist; I not only maintain that all religions are versions of the same untruth, but I hold that the influence of churches, and the effect of religious belief, is positively harmful."&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | url = http://commonwealthclub.org/archive/01/01-12hitchens-excerpt.html | title = Christopher Hitchens – Book Excerpt | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090915172725/http://www.commonwealthclub.org/archive/01/01-12hitchens-excerpt.html | archivedate = 2009-09-15 | deadurl = yes}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition to the idea of God==

Other definitions of antitheism include that of the French Catholic philosopher [[Jacques Maritain]] (1953) for whom it is "an active struggle against everything that reminds us of God" (p.&amp;nbsp;104), and that of [[Robert Flint]] (1877), Professor of Divinity at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. Flint's [[Baird Lecture]] for 1877 was entitled ''Anti-Theistic Theories''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Flint| first=Robert| title=Anti-Theistic Theories: Being the [[Baird Lecture]] for 1877| edition=5| year=1894| location=London| publisher=William Blackwood and Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used it as a very general [[umbrella term]] for all opposition to his own form of theism, which he defined as the "belief that the heavens and the earth and all that they contain owe their existence and continuance to the wisdom and will of a supreme, self-existent, omnipotent, omniscient, righteous, and benevolent Being, who is distinct from, and independent of, what He has created."&lt;ref&gt;Flint, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In dealing with theories which have nothing in common except that they are antagonistic to theism, it is necessary to have a general term to designate them. Anti-theism appears to be the appropriate word. It is, of course, much more comprehensive in meaning than the term atheism. It applies to all systems which are opposed to theism. It includes, therefore, atheism, but short of atheism there are anti-theistic theories. Polytheism is not atheism, for it does not deny that there is a deity; but it is anti-theistic since it denies that there is only one. Pantheism is not atheism, for it asserts that there is a god; but it is anti-theism, for it denies that god is a being distinct from creation and possessed of such attributes as wisdom, and holiness, and love. Every theory which refuses to ascribe to a god an attribute which is essential to a worthy conception of its character is anti-theistic. Only those theories which refuse to acknowledge that there is evidence even for the existence of a god are atheistic.&lt;ref&gt;Flint, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Flint also acknowledges that antitheism is typically understood differently from how he defines it. In particular, he notes that it has been used as a subdivision of atheism, descriptive of the view that theism has been disproven, rather than as the more general term that Flint prefers. He rejects ''[[nontheism|non-theistic]]'' as an alternative, "not merely because of its hybrid origin and character, but also because it is far too comprehensive. Theories of physical and mental science are non-theistic, even when in no degree, directly or indirectly, antagonistic to theism."&lt;ref&gt;Flint, p. 444–445&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition to the existence of a god or gods is frequently referred to as [[dystheism]] (which means "belief in a deity that is not benevolent") or [[misotheism]] (strictly speaking, this means "hatred of God"). Examples of belief systems founded on the principle of opposition to the existence of a god or gods include some forms of [[Atheistic Satanism]] and [[maltheism]].

==Other uses==
{{see also|Misotheism#Terminology}}
Another use of the term ''antitheism'' was coined by [[Christopher New]] in a thought experiment published in 1993. In his article, he imagines what arguments for the existence of an evil god would look like: "Antitheists, like theists, would have believed in an omnipotent, omniscient, eternal creator; but whereas theists in fact believe that the supreme being is also perfectly good, antitheists would have believed that he was perfectly evil."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=New| first=Christopher|date=June 1993| title=Antitheism – A Reflection| journal=Ratio| volume=6| issue=1| pages=36–43| doi=10.1111/j.1467-9329.1993.tb00051.x}}. See also: Daniels, Charles B. (1997). "God, demon, good, evil", ''The Journal of Value Inquiry'', Vol. 31 (2), June, pp.177–181.&lt;/ref&gt; New's usage has reappeared in the work of Wallace A. Murphree.&lt;ref&gt;Murphree, Wallace A. (1997). "[http://www.springerlink.com/content/n458676824862657/ Natural Theology: theism or antitheism]", ''Sophia'', Vol.36 (1), March, pp.75–83&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The word "antitheism" (or the hyphenated "anti-theism") has been recorded in English since 1788.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=antitheism|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=antitheism&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[etymology|etymological]] roots of the word are the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''[[wikt:ἀντί|anti]]'' and ''[[wikt:θεός#Ancient Greek|theos]].''

{{Sound change}}
In [[phonology]], '''assimilation''' is a common [[phonological process]] by which one sound becomes more like a nearby sound. This can occur either within a word or between words. It occurs in normal speech, and it becomes more common in more rapid speech. In rapid speech, for example, "handbag" is often pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|æ|m|b|æ|ɡ}}. The pronunciations {{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|æ|n|b|æ|ɡ}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|æ|n|d|b|æ|ɡ}} are, however, common in normal speech, whereas the word "cupboard", for example, is always pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ʌ|b|ər|d}}, never {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ʌ|p|b|ɔr|d}}, even in slow, highly articulated speech. 

As in these examples, sound segments typically assimilate to a following sound (this is called regressive or anticipatory assimilation), but they may also assimilate to a preceding one (progressive assimilation). While assimilation most commonly occurs between immediately adjacent sounds, it may occur between sounds separated by others ("assimilation at a distance").

Assimilation can be [[synchronic analysis|synchronic]]&amp;mdash;that is, an active process in a language at a given point in time&amp;mdash;or [[historical linguistics|diachronic]]&amp;mdash;that is, a historical [[sound change]].

A related process is [[coarticulation]], where one segment influences another to produce an allophonic variation, such as vowels acquiring the feature [[nasalization|nasal]] before nasal consonants when the [[soft palate|velum]] opens prematurely or {{IPA|/b/}} becoming labialised as in "boot". This article describes both processes under the term ''assimilation''.

==Concept==
The physiological or psychological mechanisms of coarticulation are unknown; coarticulation is often loosely referred to as a segment being "triggered" by an assimilatory change in another segment. In assimilation, the phonological patterning of the language, discourse styles and accent are some of the factors contributing to changes observed. 

There are four configurations found in assimilations: 
*Between adjacent segments.
*Between segments separated by one or more intervening segments.
*Changes made in reference to a preceding segment
*Changes made in reference to a following segment

Although all four occur, changes in regard to a following adjacent segment account for virtually all assimilatory changes (and most of the regular ones).{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} Assimilations to an adjacent segment are vastly more frequent than assimilations to a non-adjacent one. These radical asymmetries might contain hints about the mechanisms involved, but they are unobvious.

If a sound changes with reference to a following segment, it is traditionally called "regressive assimilation"; changes with reference to a preceding segment are traditionally called "progressive". Many&lt;ref&gt;For examples, see: Slis, Iman Hans. 1985. ''The voiced-voiceless distinction and assimilation of voice in Dutch''. Helmond: Wibro. 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt; find these terms confusing, as they seem to mean the opposite of the intended meaning. Accordingly, a variety of alternative terms have arisen—not all of which avoid the problem of the traditional terms. Regressive assimilation is also known as right-to-left, leading, or anticipatory assimilation. Progressive assimilation is also known as left-to-right, perseveratory, preservative, lagging or lag assimilation. The terms anticipatory and lag are used here.

Occasionally, two sounds (invariably adjacent) may influence one another in reciprocal assimilation. When such a change results in a single segment with some of the features of both components, it is known as coalescence or fusion.

Assimilation occurs in two different types: complete assimilation, in which the sound affected by assimilation becomes exactly the same as the sound causing assimilation, and partial assimilation, in which the sound becomes the same in one or more features, but remains different in other features.

[[Tonal language]]s may exhibit tone assimilation (tonal umlaut, in effect), while [[sign languages]] also exhibit assimilation when the characteristics of neighbouring [[chereme]]s may be mixed.

==Examples==
===Anticipatory assimilation to an adjacent segment===

Anticipatory assimilation to an adjacent segment&lt;ref name="Sihler"&gt;Sihler, Andrew L. 2000. ''Language History: An Introduction''. Amsterdam: John Benjamins, pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt; is the most common type of assimilation by far, and typically has the character of a conditioned sound change, i.e., it applies to the whole lexicon or part of it.
For example, [[Phonological history of English consonant clusters#Assimilation|in English]], the place of articulation of [[nasal consonant|nasals]] assimilates to that of a following [[stop consonant|stop]] (''handkerchief'' is pronounced {{IPA|[hæŋkɚtʃif]}}, ''handbag'' in rapid speech is pronounced {{IPA|[hæmbæɡ]}}).

In [[Italian language|Italian]], voiceless stops assimilate to a following {{IPA|/t/}}:

*[[Latin]] {{lang|la|octo}} "eight" &gt; It. {{lang|it|otto}}
*Latin {{lang|la|lectus}} "bed" &gt; {{lang|it|letto}}
*Latin {{lang|la|subtus}} – pronounced {{lang|la|suptus}} "under" &gt; {{lang|it|sotto}}

===Anticipatory assimilation at a distance===

Anticipatory assimilation at a distance is rare, and usually merely an accident in the history of a specific word.
*[[Slovene language|Standard Slovene]] {{lang|sl|[[Jevnica]]}} (a toponym) &gt; Slovene dialect {{lang|sl|Vevnica}}&lt;ref&gt;Savnik, Roman, ed. 1971. ''Krajevni leksikon Slovenije'', vol. 2. Ljubljana: Državna založba Slovenije, p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Snoj, Marko. 2009. ''Etimološki slovar slovenskih zemljepisnih imen''. Ljubljana: Modrijan and Založba ZRC, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the diverse and common assimilations known as [[I-mutation|umlaut]], wherein the phonetics of a vowel are influenced by the phonetics of a vowel in a following syllable, are both commonplace and in the nature of sound laws. Such changes abound in the histories of [[Germanic languages]], [[Romance languages|Romance]], [[Insular Celtic languages|Insular Celtic]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]], and many others.

Examples: in the history of English, a back vowel becomes front if a high front vowel or semivowel (*i, ī, j) is in the following syllable, and a front vowel becomes higher, if it is not already high:
*[[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] {{lang|gem-x-proto|*mūsiz}} "mice" &gt; [[Old English]] {{lang|ang|mýs}} {{IPA|/myːs/}} &gt; Modern English ''mice''
*PGmc {{lang|gem-x-proto|*batizōn}} "better" &gt; OE {{lang|ang|bettre}}
*PGmc {{lang|gem-x-proto|*fōtiz}} "feet" &gt; OE {{lang|ang|fét}} &gt; ME ''feet''

Contrariwise, Proto-Germanic {{lang|gem-x-proto|*i}} and {{lang|gem-x-proto|*u}} &gt; {{lang|ang|e, o}} respectively before {{lang|gem-x-proto|*a}} in the following syllable ([[Germanic a-mutation]]), although this had already happened significantly earlier:
*PGmc {{wikt-lang|gem-x-proto|*wurdą}} &gt; OE {{lang|ang|word}}
*PGmc {{wikt-lang|gem-x-proto|*nestaz}} &gt; OE {{lang|ang|nest}}

Another example of a regular change is the sibilant assimilation of [[Sanskrit]], wherein if there were two different sibilants as the onset of successive syllables, a plain {{IPA|/s/}} was always replaced by the palatal {{IPA|/ɕ/}}:
* [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] {{PIE|*''smeḱru''}}- "beard" &gt; Skt. {{transl|sa|śmaśru}}-
* PIE {{PIE|*''ḱoso''}}- "gray" &gt; Skt. {{transl|sa|śaśa}}- "rabbit"
* PIE {{PIE|*''sweḱru''}}- "husband's mother' &gt; Skt. {{transl|sa|śvaśrū}}-

===Lag assimilation to an adjacent segment===

Lag assimilation to an adjacent segment&lt;ref name="Sihler"/&gt; is tolerably common, and often has the nature of a sound law.

Proto-Indo-European {{PIE|*''-ln-''}} becomes {{PIE|''-ll-''}} in both Germanic and Italic. Thus {{PIE|*''ḱl̥nis''}} "hill" &gt; PreLat. {{PIE|*''kolnis''}} &gt; Lat. {{lang|la|collis}}; &gt; PGmc {{lang|gem-x-proto|*hulniz}}, {{wikt-lang|gem-x-proto|*hulliz}} &gt; OE {{lang|ang|hyll}} {{IPA|/hyll/}} &gt; ''hill''. The enclitic form of English ''is'', [[elision|eliding]] the vowel, becomes voiceless when adjacent to a word-final voiceless non-sibilant. Thus ''it is'' {{IPA|[ɪtɪz]}}, ''that is'' {{IPA|[ðætɪz]}} &gt; ''it's'' {{IPA|[ɪts]}}, ''that's'' {{IPA|[ðæts]}}.

In [[Polish language|Polish]], {{IPA|/v/}} regularly becomes {{IPA|/f/}} after a voiceless obstruent:
*{{lang|pl|kwiat}} 'flower', pronounced {{IPA|[kfjat]}} instead of {{IPA|[kvjat]}}
*{{lang|pl|twarz}} 'face', pronounced {{IPA|[tfaʂ]}} instead of {{IPA|[tvaʂ]}}

Because of a similar process, [[Proto-Indo-Iranian language|Proto-Indo-Iranian]] {{lang|iir-x-proto|*sw}} became {{transl|fa|sp}} in [[Persian language|Persian]]. E.g. [[Old Persian]] {{transl|peo|aspa}} 'horse' corresponds to [[Sanskrit]] {{transl|sa|aśva}}.

===Lag assimilation at a distance===

Lag assimilation at a distance is rare, and usually sporadic (except when part of something bigger, as in the Skt. {{transl|sa|śaśa}}- example, above): Greek {{transl|grc|leirion}} &gt; Lat. {{lang|la|līlium}} "lily".

In [[vowel harmony]], a vowel's phonetics is often influenced by that of a preceding vowel. Thus, for example, most Finnish case markers come in two flavors, with {{IPA|/ɑ/}} (written {{lang|fi|a}}) and {{IPA|/æ/}} (written {{lang|fi|ä}}) depending on whether the preceding vowel is back or front. However, it is difficult to know where and how in the history of Finnish an actual ''assimilatory change'' took place. The ''distribution'' of pairs of endings in Finnish is just that, and is not in any sense the operation of an assimilatory innovation (though probably the outbirth of such an innovation in the past).

===Coalescence (fusion)===

[[Proto-Italic language|Proto-Italic]] {{PIE|*''dw''}} &gt; Latin {{lang|la|b}}, as in {{wikt-lang|ine-x-proto|*dwís}} "twice" &gt; Lat. {{lang|la|bis}}. Also, Old Latin {{lang|la|duellum}} &gt; Latin {{lang|la|bellum}} "war".

[[Proto-Celtic language|Proto-Celtic]] {{lang|cel-x-proto|*sw}} shows up in [[Old Irish]] in initial position as {{lang|sga|s}}, thus {{PIE|*''swesōr''}} "sister" &gt; OIr {{lang|sga|siur}} {{IPA|*/ʃuɾ/}}, {{PIE|*''spenyo''-}} &gt; *''swinea''- &gt; *''swine'' "nipple" &gt; {{lang|sga|sine}}. However, when preceded by a vowel, the *''sw'' sequence becomes {{IPA|/f/}}: {{lang|sga|má fiur}} "my sister", {{lang|sga|bó tri-fne}} "a cow with three teats".  There is also the famous change in [[P-Celtic]] of {{PIE|*''kʷ''}} -&gt; ''p''.  [[Proto-Celtic]] also underwent the change {{PIE|*''gʷ''}} -&gt; ''b''.

'''''Before Night Falls''''' ({{lang-es|Antes que anochezca: autobiografía}}) is the 1992 [[autobiography]] of [[Cubans|Cuban]] writer [[Reinaldo Arenas]], describing his early life in Cuba, his time in prison, and his escape to the United States in the [[Mariel Boatlift]] of 1980. It received a favorable review from ''[[The New York Times]]'' and was on the newspaper's list of the ten best books of 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gonzalez Echevarria |first=Roberto |work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/12/06/specials/arenas-night.html  |title=An Outcast of the Island  |date=October 24, 1993 |accessdate=November 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was adapted into a [[Before Night Falls (film)|film]] of the same name in 2000, starring [[Javier Bardem]] and [[Johnny Depp]].

==Opera adaptation==
On May 29, 2010 the premiere performance of ''Before Night Falls'', an opera by [[Jorge Martín (composer)|Jorge Martín]], took place at the [[Fort Worth Opera]]. The opera follows the book by Reinaldo Arenas closely.

On March 29, 2017, [[Florida Grand Opera]] premiered ''Before Night Falls'' in [[Miami]] with five performances at the [[Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1982">'''Coarticulation''' in its general sense refers to a situation in which a conceptually isolated speech sound is influenced by, and becomes more like, a preceding or following speech sound. There are two types of coarticulation: ''anticipatory coarticulation,'' when a feature or characteristic of a speech sound is anticipated (assumed) during the production of a preceding speech sound; and ''carryover'' or ''perseverative coarticulation,'' when the effects of a sound are seen during the production of sound(s) that follow. Many models have been developed to account for coarticulation. They include the look-ahead, articulatory syllable, time-locked, window, coproduction and articulatory phonology models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hardcastle, W.  |author2=Hewlett, N.|title=Coarticulation: Theory, Data, and Techniques.|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Sound change}}
Coarticulation in phonetics refers to two different phenomena:
*the '''[[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]]''' of the [[place of articulation]] of one [[Phone (phonetics)|speech sound]] to that of an adjacent speech sound. For example, while the sound {{IPA|/n/}} of [[English language|English]] normally has an [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]] place of articulation, in the word ''tenth'' it is pronounced with a [[dental consonant|dental]] place of articulation because the following sound, {{IPA|/θ/}}, is dental.
*the production of a '''[[co-articulated consonant]]''', that is, a consonant with two simultaneous places of articulation. An example of such a sound is the [[voiceless labial-velar plosive]] {{IPA|/k͡p/}} found in many [[West Africa]]n languages.

The term '''coarticulation''' may also refer to the transition from one articulatory [[gesture]] to another.

This article compares the [[List of United States presidential candidates, 2008|presidential candidates]] in the United States' [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election]]. It does not cover [[United States presidential election|previous elections]]. Because of [[ballot access]] restrictions in the United States, not all candidates appeared on the ballots in all states.

|McKinney supports comprehensive federal investment in low-come families and communities, with an emphasis on people of color, to eliminate racial and other disparities in education, healthcare, imprisonment, family income, wealth, home ownership. She supports a moratorium on foreclosures, and end to the privatization of prisons. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita survivors should be recognized as Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs); she supports protecting their right of return, including their right to vote in their home states, and reparations for the losses they incurred due to government abandonment and negligence. She calls for an end to the "War on Drugs," which justifies foreign military intervention and assaults civil liberties; mandatory minimum drug sentences should be ended, and the budget should focus on treatment and prevention.&lt;ref name="GP" /&gt;

'''''Der Landser''''' (literally ''private, common soldier'') was a German [[pulp magazine]] published by Pabel-Moewig and featuring mostly stories in [[World War II]] settings. The magazine was founded in 1954&lt;ref name=cardw/&gt; by writer and former [[Luftwaffe]] officer {{illm|Bertold K. Jochim|de|Bertold K. Jochim}} (1921-2002), who worked as its editor-in-chief until 1999. In September 2013 the [[Bauer Media Group]], its last owner, ceased publishing the magazine.&lt;ref name=cardw/&gt;&lt;ref name=jacke&gt;{{cite news|author=Jack Ewing|title=German Magazine Said to Glorify Nazis Will End|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/14/world/europe/german-magazine-said-to-glorify-nazis-will-cease-publication.html?_r=0|accessdate=10 August 2014|work=The New York Times|date=13 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and profile==
The magazine asserted that its war stories were true and that their underlying message was one of peace. In fact many of their stories came with disclaimer reminding the reader of the horrors of war. Critics however dismissed such claims as pure lip service to avoid getting [[Bibliographic index|index]]ed by West Germany's [[Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons]] which started to index several of their editions in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Corinna Bochmann: ''[http://www.bundespruefstelle.de/bmfsfj/generator/bpjm/redaktion/PDF-Anlagen/bpjm-aktuell-jugendgefaehrdende-medien-im-rechtsextremismus-aus-sicht-der-bpjm-aus-02-06,property=pdf,bereich=bpjm,sprache=de,rwb=true.pdf Jugendgefährdende Medien im Rechtsextremismus aus Sicht der BPJM (PDF)]''. S.1. Jahrestagung 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its founding the magazine was criticized for glorifying war and delivering a distorted image of the [[Wehrmacht]] and [[Nazi Germany]] during [[World War II]]. The content of novels was accurate regarding minor technical details, but its descriptions were often not authentic and withheld important contextual information from the reader. Antisemitism, German war crimes, the repressive nature of the German government, and the causes of the war were not mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;Torben Fischer, Matthias N. Lorenz: ''Lexikon der "Vergangenheitsbewältigung" in Deutschland: Debatten- und Diskursgeschichte des Nationalsozialismus nach 1945''. transcript Verlag 2007, {{ISBN|978-3-89942-773-8}}, p.&amp;nbsp;116 ({{Google books|1-nQ4CzC95YC|online copy|page=116}}) (German)&lt;/ref&gt; Germany's leading news magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' described ''Der Landser'' once as the expert journal for the whitewashing of the Wehrmacht ("Fachorgan für die Verklärung der Wehrmacht").&lt;ref name="spiegel98"&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-7955989.html?name=Kampferprobte+Verb%26auml%3Bnde ''Kampferprobte Verbände'']. In DER SPIEGEL 32/1998 3 August 1998, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

The publisher of the magazine was Pabel Moewig, a subsidiary of [[Bauer Media Group]].&lt;ref name=cardw/&gt; In September 2013 Bauer Media Group said it would cease publication of ''Der Landser'' following complaints from the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]].&lt;ref name=jacke/&gt; The magazine was closed down 13 September 2013.&lt;ref name=cardw&gt;{{cite news|author=Carla Bleiker|title=Publishing house terminates German pulp mag 'Der Landser'|url=http://www.dw.de/publishing-house-terminates-german-pulp-mag-der-landser/a-16989362|accessdate=14 April 2015|work=Deutsche Welle|date=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections==
[[File:DSC05996 Howdy Doody at DIA by Volkan Yuksel.JPG|thumb|right|Original Dawson [[Howdy Doody]], by Volkan Yuksel]]
The museum contains 100 galleries of art from around the world. [[Diego Rivera]]'s ''[[Detroit Industry Murals|Detroit Industry]]'' cycle of [[fresco]]es span the upper and lower levels to surround the central grand marble court of the museum. The armor collection of [[William Randolph Hearst]] lines the main hall entry way to the grand court.
The collection of [[Visual arts of the United States|American art]] at the DIA is one of the most impressive, and officials at the DIA have ranked the American paintings collection third among museums in the United States. Works by American artists began to be collected immediately following the museum's founding in 1883. Today the collection is a strong survey of American history, with acknowledged masterpieces of painting, sculpture, furniture and decorative arts from the 18th century, 19th century, and 20th century, with contemporary American art in all media also being collected. The breadth of the collection includes such American artists as [[John James Audubon]], [[George Bellows]], [[George Caleb Bingham]], [[Alexander Calder]], [[Mary Cassatt]], [[Dale Chihuly]], [[Frederic Edwin Church]], [[Thomas Cole]], [[John Singleton Copley]], [[Robert Colescott]], [[Leon Dabo]], [[Thomas Wilmer Dewing]], [[Thomas Eakins]], [[Childe Hassam]], [[Robert Henri]], [[Winslow Homer]], [[George Inness]], [[Martin Lewis (artist)|Martin Lewis]], [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], [[Charles Willson Peale]], [[Rembrandt Peale]], [[Tom Phardel]], [[Duncan Phyfe]], [[Hiram Powers]], [[Sharon Que]], [[Frederic Remington]], [[Paul Revere]], [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]], [[John Singer Sargent]], [[John French Sloan]], [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], [[Marylyn Dintenfass]], [[Gilbert Stuart]], [[Yves Tanguy]], [[Henry Ossawa Tanner]], [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]], [[Andy Warhol]], [[William T.

The early 20th century was a period of prolific collecting for the museum, which acquired such works as a dragon tile relief from the [[Ishtar Gate]] of [[Babylon]], an Egyptian relief of Mourning Women and a statuette of a Seated Scribe, [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]]'s ''The Wedding Dance'', ''[[Saint Jerome in His Study (after van Eyck)|Saint Jerome in His Study]]'' by [[Jan van Eyck]] and [[Giovanni Bellini]]'s ''Madonna and Child''. Early purchases included French paintings by [[Claude Monet]], [[Odilon Redon]], [[Eugène Boudin]], and [[Edgar Degas]], as well as [[Old Masters]] including [[Gerard ter Borch]], [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Albrecht Dürer]] and [[Rembrandt van Rijn]]. The museum includes works by [[Vincent van Gogh]] including a self-portrait. The [[Self-portraits by Vincent van Gogh|self-portrait of Vincent van Gogh]] and ''The Window'' by [[Henri Matisse]] were purchased in 1922 and were the first paintings by these two artists to enter an American public collection. Later important acquisitions include [[Hans Holbein the Younger]]'s ''Portrait of a Woman'', [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]]'s ''[[Nocturne in Black and Gold – The Falling Rocket|Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket]]'', and works by [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Eugène Delacroix]], [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux]] and [[François Rude]]. German [[Expressionism]] was embraced and collected early on by the DIA, with works by [[Heinrich Campendonk]], [[Franz Marc]], [[Karl Schmidt-Rottluff]], [[Max Beckmann]], [[Karl Hofer]], [[Emil Nolde]], [[Lovis Corinth]], [[Ernst Barlach]], [[Georg Kolbe]], [[Wilhelm Lehmbruck]], [[Erich Heckel]], [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]], [[Paula Modersohn-Becker]], and [[Max Pechstein]] in the collection. Non-German artists in the Expressionist movement include [[Oskar Kokoschka]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Chaim Soutine]] and [[Edvard Munch]]. ''[[The Nut Gatherers]]'' by [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]] is, by some accounts, the most popular painting in the collection.

In addition to the American and European works listed above, the collections of the Detroit Institute of Arts are generally encyclopedic and extensive, including ancient Greek, Roman, Etruscan, Mesopotamian, and Egyptian material, as well as a wide range of Islamic, African and Asian art of all media.

In December 2010, the museum debuted a new permanent gallery with special collections of hand, shadow, and string puppets along with programmable lighting and original backgrounds.  The museum plans to feature puppet related events and rotation of exhibits drawn from its puppet collections.&lt;ref name=Puppetgallery&gt;{{cite press release| date=22 November 2010| accessdate=2011-05-16| url=http://www.dia.org/news/753/The-Puppets-Are-Coming%2c-The-Puppets-Are-Coming%21-Detroit-Institute-of-Arts-to-unveil-new-puppet-gallery-December-22.aspx| title=The Puppets Are Coming, The Puppets Are Coming!

Before 1920, a commission was established to choose an architect to design a new building to house the DIA's expanding collections. The commission included DIA President Ralph H. Booth, William J. Gray, architect [[Albert Kahn (architect)|Albert Kahn]] and industrialist [[Edsel Ford]]. [[Wilhelm Valentiner|W.R. Valentiner]], the museum director acted as art director and Clyde H. Burroughs was the secretary. The group chose [[Philadelphia]] architect [[Paul Philippe Cret]] as the lead architect and the firm of [[Zantzinger, Borie and Medary]] as associated architects, with Detroit architectural firms of [[Albert Kahn (architect)|Albert Kahn]] and [[C. Howard Crane]] contributing "advice and suggestions."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book| title=The Architecture of the Detroit Institute of Arts| publisher=The Detroit Institute of Arts| year=1928}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cornerstone for new [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]], [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Italian Renaissance]] styled building was laid June 26, 1923 and the finished museum was dedicated October 7, 1927.&lt;ref name=Ferry&gt;{{cite book| last=Ferry| first=W.

In 1922, [[Horace Rackham]] donated a casting of [[Auguste Rodin]]'s sculpture, ''[[The Thinker]]'', acquired from a German collection, to the museum where it was exhibited while the new building was under construction. The work was placed in the Great Hall of the new museum building. Sometime in the subsequent years the work was moved out of the building and placed on a pedestal in front of the building, facing [[Woodward Avenue]] and the [[Detroit Public Library]] across the street which was also constructed of white marble in the Beaux-Arts, Italian Renaissance style .

The south and north wings were added in 1966 and 1971 respectively. Both were designed by [[Gunnar Birkerts]] and were originally faced in black granite to serve as a backdrop for the original white marble building. The south wing was later named in honor of museum benefactors Edsel and Eleanor Ford and the north wing for Jerome Cavanaugh who was Detroit Mayor during the expansion.&lt;ref name=Ferry /&gt;&lt;ref name=artshow /&gt;

===Renovation and expansion===

In November 2007, the Detroit Institute of Arts building completed a renovation and expansion at a total cost of $158 million. Architects for the renovation included [[Michael Graves]] and associates along with the [[SmithGroup]].&lt;ref name=NewDIA&gt;{{cite web| first=Lucy| last=Ament| date=22 January 2008| url=http://www.modeldmedia.com/features/diaarch12608.aspx| title=The New DIA: The Architects| publisher=Model D Media| accessdate=2010-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project, labeled the ''Master Plan Project'', included expansion and renovation of the north and south wings as well as restoration of the original Paul Cret building, and added 58,000 additional square feet, bringing the total to 658,000 square feet.&lt;ref name=DIAhistory/&gt; The renovated exterior of the north and south wings was refaced with white marble acquired from the same quarry as the marble on the main building designed by Paul Cret.&lt;ref name=NewDIA/&gt; The major renovation of the Detroit Institute of Arts has provided a significant example of study for museum planning, function, direction, and design.&lt;ref name=Linett&gt;{{cite journal| last=Linett| first=Peter| date=January 2009| volume=52| issue = 1| title=Focus on the Detroit Institute of Arts| url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2151-6952.2009.tb00330.x/pdf| work=Curator: The Museum Journal| accessdate=2014-11-08| subscription=yes| doi=10.1111/j.2151-6952.2009.tb00330.x| pages=13–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:DetroitInstituteoftheArts2010B.jpg|thumb|left|350px|&lt;center&gt;Detroit Institute of Arts&lt;/center&gt;]]

The Museum had its genesis in an 1881 tour of Europe made by local newspaper magnate [[James E. Scripps]]. Scripps kept a journal of his family's five-month tour of art and culture in Italy, France, Germany, and the Netherlands, portions of which were published in his newspaper ''[[The Detroit News]]''. The series proved so popular that it was  republished in book form called ''Five Months Abroad''. The popularity inspired William H. Brearley, the manager of the newspaper's advertising department to organize an art exhibit in 1883, which was also extremely well received.

Brearly convinced many leading Detroit citizens to contribute to establish a permanent museum. It was originally named the Detroit Museum of Art. Among the donors were [[James E. Scripps]], his brother George H. Scripps, [[Dexter M. Ferry]], [[Christian H. Buhl]], [[Russell A. Alger|Gen. Russell A. Alger]], [[Moses W. Field]], [[James McMillan (politician)|James McMillan]] and Hugh McMillan, George H. Hammond, James F. Joy, Francis Palms, [[C. R. Mabley|Christopher R. Mabley]], Simon J. Murphy, [[John Stoughton Newberry|John S. Newberry]], [[Cyrenius A. Newcomb, Sr.]], [[Thomas W. Palmer]], Philo Parsons, George B. Remick, Allan Shelden, William C. Weber, David Whitney Jr., [[George V. N. Lothrop]], and [[Hiram Walker]].
[[File:Institute of Arts (NBY 5883).jpg|thumb|Detroit Institute of Arts, circa 1910s]]
With much success from their first exhibit, Brearley then challenged 40 of Detroit's leading and prominent businessmen to contribute $1,000 each to help fund the building of a permanent museum.  With $50,000 coming from Scripps alone, their goal was within reach.  By 1888, Scripps and Brearley had incorporated Detroit Museum of Arts, filling it with over 70 pieces of artwork acquired by Scripps during his time in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historicdetroit.org/building/detroit-museum-of-art/ |title=Detroit Museum of Art — Historic Detroit |publisher=Historicdetroit.org |date= |accessdate=2015-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lasting as a museum less than 40 years, the impact the museum had on the city of Detroit was tremendous.  The Art Loan Exhibition's success in 1883 had led to the creation of a board. The purpose of the board was to raise and establish funds to build a permanent art museum in the city. Donating money to the cause were some of Detroit's biggest names, including [[James E. Scripps]], George H. Scripps, [[Russell A. Alger]], and Sen. [[Thomas W. Palmer|Thomas Palmer]]. The old Detroit Museum of Art building opened in 1888 at 704 E. Jefferson Avenue (it was finally demolished in 1960).  The Detroit Museum of Art board of trustees changed the name to the Detroit Institute of Arts in 1919 and a committee began raising funds to build a new location with Scripps still at the helm. The present DIA building on Woodward Avenue debuted on October 7, 1927. While not officially declared the founder of the Detroit Institute of Arts, Scripps and Brearley were indeed the founders of the DIA's predecessor, The Detroit Museum of Art.  With the success of the arts, and the booming auto industry, families were flocking to the city; pushing for the need to expand the vision that Scripps had originally dreamed, a new building was raised and the DIA was born.

Another decision in 1919 that would have a lasting impact of the future of the museum was transferring ownership to the City of Detroit with the museum becoming a city department and receiving operating funds. The board of trustees became the Founder's Society a private support group that provided additional money for acquisitions and other museum needs. The museum sought the leadership of German art scholar [[Wilhelm Valentiner]]. It as under Valentiner's leadership as director that, the museum flush with money from a booming city and wealthy patrons,  the size and quality of the DIA's collections grew significantly. The DIA became the first U.S. museum to acquire a van Gogh and Matisse in 1922 and Valentiner's relationship with German expressionist led to significant holdings of early [[Modernist art]].&lt;ref name="A Brief History"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of the Detroit Institute of Arts|url=http://www.phillipsoppenheim.com/pdf/DIA-Addendum%20-%20A-Brief-History-of-the-Detroit-Institute-of-Arts.pdf|publisher=Phillips Oppenheim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Valentiner also reorganized how art was displayed at the museum. Breaking with the tradition of organizing artworks by their type with, for example, painting grouped together in one gallery and sculpture in another. Valentiner organized them by nation and chronology, this was recognized as being so revolutionary that the 1929 Encyclopædia Britannica used an illustration of the main floor plan of the DIA as an example of the perfect modern art museum.&lt;ref name="A Brief History"/&gt;

[[File:Detroit Museum of Arts 1888.jpg|thumb|left|The old Detroit Museum of Art stood at 704 E. Jefferson Ave. The building opened in 1888]]
Support for the museum came from Detroit philanthropists such as [[Charles Lang Freer]], and the auto barons: art and funds were donated by the Dodges, the Firestones and the Fords, especially [[Edsel Ford]] and his wife Eleanor, and subsequently their children. [[Robert Hudson Tannahill]] of the [[Hudson's]] Department Store family, was a major benefactor and supporter of the museum, donating many works during his lifetime. At his death in 1970, he bequeathed a large European art collection, which included works by [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Edgar Degas]], [[Georges Seurat]], [[Henri Rousseau]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Constantin Brâncuși]], important works of German [[Expressionism]], a large collection of [[African art]], and an endowment for future acquisitions for the museum. Part of the current support for the museum comes from the state government in exchange for which the museum conducts statewide programs on art appreciation and provides [[art conservation]] services to other museums in Michigan.
[[File:Master of the Osservanza - The Resurrection - WGA14606.jpg|thumb| [[Master of the Osservanza Triptych]], ''The Resurrection'', c. 1445]]

In 1949, the museum was among the first to return a work that had been [[Nazi plunder|looted by the Nazis]], when it returned [[Claude Monet]]'s ''The Seine at Asnières'' to its rightful owner. The art dealer from whom they had purchased it reimbursed the museum. In 2002, the museum discovered that [[Ludolf Bakhuizen|Ludolf Backhuysen]]'s ''A Man-O-War and Other Ships off the Dutch Coast'', a 17th-century seascape painting under consideration for purchase by the museum, had been looted from a private European collection by the Nazis. The museum contacted the original owners, paid the rightful restitution, and the family allowed the museum to accession the painting into its collection, adding another painting to the museum's already prominent Dutch collection.
In another case, Detroit Institute of Arts v. Ullin, which involved a claim concerning [[Vincent Van Gogh]]’s "Les Becheurs (The Diggers)" (1889), the museum successfully asserted that Michigan's three-year statute of limitations precluded the court or a jury from deciding the merits of the case.&lt;ref&gt;WJRO. [http://wjro.org.il/cms/assets/uploads/2015/12/ReportMuseums.pdf  "Report Concerning Current Approaches of United States Museums To Holocaust Era Art Claims June 25, 2015”]&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum was expanded with a south and north wing in 1966 and 1971, respectively, giving space for the museum to receive two big gifts in 1970, the collection of Robert Tannahill and [[Anna Thompson Dodge]] bequeathed the 18th-century French contents of the music room from her home, Rose Terrace, to the museum upon her death.&lt;ref name="A Brief History"/&gt;

As the fortunes of the city declined in the 1970s and 80s so did its ability to support the DIA. In 1975, even with reduced staff, the city was forced to close the museum for three weeks in June. The State of Michigan provided funding to reopen and over this time period the state would play an increasing role in funding the museum.&lt;ref name="A Brief History"/&gt;

A 1976 gift of $1 million from Eleanor Ford created the Department of African, Oceanic and New World Cultures.&lt;ref name=artshow&gt;{{cite news| url=http://detnews.com/article/20071106/ENT05/711060400/It-began-with-an-art-show| title= It All Began with an Art Show| work=[[The Detroit News]]| publisher=detnews.com| date=6 November 2007| accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1990, 70 percent of the DIA's funding was coming from the State of Michigan, that year the state facing a recession and budget deficit cut funding by more than 50 percent. This resulted in the museum having to close galleries and reduce hours, a fundraising campaign led by [[Joseph L. Hudson]] was able to restore operations.&lt;ref name="A Brief History"/&gt;

In 1998, the Founder's Society signed an operating agreement with the City of Detroit that would have the Founder's Society operating as Detroit Institute of Arts, Inc take over management of the museum from the Art Department with the city retaining ownership of the DIA itself.&lt;ref name="A Brief History"/&gt;

On February 24, 2006, a 12-year-old boy stuck a piece of chewing gum on [[Helen Frankenthaler]]'s 1963 abstract work ''The Bay'', leaving a small stain. The painting was valued at $1.5 million in 2005, and is one of Frankenthaler's most important works. The museum's conservation lab successfully cleaned and restored the painting, which was returned to the gallery in late June 2006.&lt;ref name=gum&gt;{{cite press release| url=http://www.dia.org/news/288/Masterpiece-Back-On-View-After-Gum-Incident.aspx| title=Masterpiece Back On View After Gum Incident| publisher=Detroit Institute of Arts| date=30 June 2006| accessdate=2014-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the settlement of the City of Detroit's bankruptcy ownership of the museum was transferred to Detroit Institute of Arts, Inc in December 2014 returning the museum to its pre-1919 status as an independent non-profit.&lt;ref name="A Brief History"/&gt;

===Finance===
One of the largest, most significant art museums in the United States, the Detroit Institute of Arts relies on private donations for much of its financial support. The museum has sought to increase its endowment balance to provide it financial independence. The City of Detroit owns the museum building and collection, but withdrew the city's financial support. The museum's endowment totaled $200 million in 1999 and $230 million in 2001.  The museum completed a major renovation and expansion in 2007. By 2008, the museum's endowment reached $350 million; however, a recession, reduced contributions, and unforeseen costs reduced the endowment balance to critical levels.&lt;ref name="MillageWSJ"/&gt;

In 2012, the endowment totaled $89.3 million and provided an annual return of about $3.4 million in investment income; while admissions, the museums cafe restaurant, and merchandise and book sales from the museum's gift shop generated about $3.5 million a year, or just 15 percent of the annual budget.  The museum raised $60 million from 2008 to 2012, reduced staffing, and reduced its annual operating budget from $34 million in 2008 to 25.4 million in 2012.&lt;ref name="MillageWSJ"&gt;{{cite news| authorlink=Judith H.

State-appointed emergency manager Kevin Orr hired [[Christie's]] Auction House to appraise the collection.  After months of determining the fair market value of the portion of the art that was purchased with city funds, Christie's released a report December 19, 2013, saying that the collection of nearly 2,800 pieces of the then city-owned artwork, was worth $454 million to $867 million, with one masterpiece by Van Gogh worth up to $150 million.&lt;ref name=Christies&gt;{{cite news| agency=[[Associated Press]]| title=Christie’s Values Detroit’s Art At $454M-$867M| url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/2013-12-19/christies-values-detroits-art-at-454m-867m| work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]| accessdate=2014-11-08| date=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Journal1&gt;{{cite journal| title=La collection du Detroit Institute of Arts menace| url=http://www.lejournaldesarts.fr/jda/archives/docs_article/117226/la-collection-du-detroit-institute-of-arts-menacee.php|trans-title=The collection of the Detroit Institute of Arts threatened| language=French| work=La Journal des Arts.fr| location=Paris| date=13 December 2013| accessdate=2014-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent possible sale of the works, museum proponents developed what has been named the ''grand bargain''.  Under the plan, which was eventually approved, the museum would raise $100 million for its portion, nine private foundations pledged $330 million, and the state of Michigan would contribute $350 million for a total of $820 million in order to guarantee municipal workers' pensions. In return, the city of Detroit would transfer its portion of the collection and the building to the non-profit entity that already operates the museum.&lt;ref name=Sell&gt;{{cite journal| title=Detroit va céder le DIA... au DIA !|trans-title=Detroit will sell the DIA...to the DIA!| date=31 January 2014| work=La Journal des Arts.fr| url=http://www.lejournaldesarts.fr/site/archives/docs_article/118577/detroit-va-ceder-le-dia-au-dia-.php| language=French| accessdate=2014-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; This plan was challenged by other creditors, who claimed that it treated them unfairly and requested to conduct their own appraisal of the museum collection.&lt;ref name=Bomey&gt;{{cite news| title=DIA seeks to block removal of artworks for valuation in bankruptcy fight| url=http://www.freep.com/article/20140513/NEWS01/305130035/dia-detroit-institute-of-arts-grand-bargain-bankruptcy| work=[[Detroit Free Press]]| last=Bomey| first=Nathan| date=13 May 2004| accessdate=2014-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some creditors came forward with offers from other parties to buy the artworks for sums higher than Christie's appraisal.&lt;ref name=ODonnell&gt;{{cite journal| title=Detroit Institute of Arts Grand Bargain Not Done Yet, Creditors Claim to Have Purchaser Willing to Pay Nearly $2 Billion for Entire Collection| url=http://www.artlawreport.com/2014/04/23/detroit-institute-of-arts-grand-bargain-not-done-yet-creditors-claim-purchaser-willing-to-pay-nearly-2-billion-for-entire-collection/| last=O'Donnell| first=Nathan| date=23 April 2014| work=Art Law Report| accessdate=2014-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 13, 2014, Detroit emergency manager [[Kevyn Orr]] asked Detroit automakers to add $195 million to make the grand bargain stronger.&lt;ref name=Gray&gt;{{cite news| title=Orr pleads with lawmakers for Grand Bargain cash, creditors plot legal strategy| url=http://www.freep.com/article/20140513/NEWS01/305130196/Detroit-bankruptcy-DIA-Detroit-Institute-of-Arts-grand-bargain-lansing| last1=Gray| first1=Kathleen| last2=Bomey| first2=Nathan| last3=Stryker| first3=Mark| date=13 May 2014| work=Detroit Free Press| accessdate=2014-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eventual settlement did not require the DIA to sell any art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/detroit-bankruptcy/2014/11/07/rhodes-bankruptcy-decision/18648093/ | title=Judge OKs bankruptcy plan; a 'miraculous' outcome | work=Detroit Free Press | accessdate=2014-12-02 | last1=Bomey | first1=Nathan | last2=Helms | first2=Matt | last3=Guillen | first3=Joe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery in 2014 that DIA President [[Graham W. J.

Gifford-Gonzalez's work at [[Lake Turkana]] on the border of [[Ethiopia]] and [[Kenya]] has put her at the forefront of scholars who study pastoralism in that area.&lt;ref name="Gifford-Gonzalez 1998 166–200"/&gt; She specializes in the study of the [[domestication]] of [[donkey]]s, [[cattle]], [[sheep]], and [[goat]]s, and the importance that these animals had on the peoples who lived, and continue to live, at Lake Turkana.&lt;ref name="Gifford-Gonzalez 1998 166–200" /&gt;  Cattle found at [[Pastoral Neolithic]] sites near Lake Turkana came with herders from northern Africa after the [[Sahara]] started to dry out.&lt;ref name="Gifford-Gonzalez 1998 166–200" /&gt; Gifford-Gonzalez argues that there seems to be a lag in the spread of [[domestication of animals|domesticated animals]] farther south in [[East Africa|eastern Africa]],&lt;ref name="Gifford-Gonzalez 1998 166–200" /&gt; which may have been due to threats of livestock diseases such as [[Bovine malignant catarrhal fever|Bovine Malignant Catarrhal Fever]] (MCF), which is almost 100% lethal for [[cattle]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gifford-Gonzalez|first=Diane|year=2000|title=Animal Disease Challenges to the Emergence of Pastoralism in Sub-Saharan Africa|journal=African Archaeology Review|volume=17|issue=3|pages=95–139|doi=10.1023/A:1006601020217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other livestock diseases affect humans as well, such as [[Rift Valley fever|Rift Valley Fever]] (RVF), [[East Coast fever|East Coast Fever]] (ECF), [[foot-and-mouth disease]] (FMD), and [[trypanosomiasis]] (sleeping sickness).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It is impossible, though, to tell if coming into contact with [[cattle]] caused [[epidemic]]s of unfamiliar [[disease]]s in early pastoralist societies.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Gifford-Gonzalez has also studied early evidence for fishing around [[Lake Turkana]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gifford-Gonzalez|first=Diane|last2=Stewart|first2=Kathlyn|last3=Rybczynski|first3=Natalia|year=1999|title=Human Activities and Site Formation at Modern Lake Margin Foraging Camps in Kenya|journal=Journal of Anthropological Archaeology|volume=18|issue=4|pages=397–440|doi=10.1006/jaar.1999.0337}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fishing has typically been associated with [[anatomically modern human]]s,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; but evidence of fishing has been found at sites near [[Lake Edward|Lake Rutanzige]], [[Olduvai Gorge]], and [[Lake Turkana]] that date from the late [[Pliocene]] to the [[Late Pleistocene]],&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; prior to the earliest known members of the genus ''Homo''. Gifford-Gonzalez then asks if it may have been possible for early hominins to have fished, and to have passed that knowledge down to ''[[Homo sapiens]].''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Gifford-Gonzalez and [[Kathlyn Stewart]] conducted [[Ethnoarchaeology|ethnoarchaeological]] research with [[Daasanach people|Dassanetch]] pastoralists who live in the lower [[Omo River (Ethiopia)|Omo River]] Valley, and they found that the Dassanetch were relied entirely on their own [[livestock]] and on fish from the nearby river.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Gifford-Gonzalez and Stewart were then able to study the material remains found at Dassanetch fishing camps, providing a useful point of reference for ancient archaeological finds from places such as Olduvai Gorge. 

She has also been a part of [[genetic testing]] of animals that can show where an animal was [[Domestication|domesticated]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gifford-Gonzalez|first=Diane|last2=Hanotte|first2=Olivier|year=2011|title=Domesticating Animals in Africa: Implications of Genetic and Archaeological Findings|journal=Journal of World Prehistory|volume=24|issue=1|pages=1–23|doi=10.1007/s10963-010-9042-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the [[genetics]] that she has studied show that there are  relations between the [[cattle]] from [[South Asia]], [[Africa]], and [[Europe]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It used to be thought that [[Africa]] had no unique [[Domestication|domesticates]] of is own&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; but this data has tentatively pointed to an [[Domestication|independent domestication process]] of [[cattle]] in [[Africa]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The [[Genetic analysis|genetic studies]] of [[cattle]] can show that [[African taurine|African]] and [[European taurine]]'s lineage diverged somewhere in the 22nd–26th [[Millennium|millennia]] [[Before Present|BP]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The analyses point to [[domestication]] of  [[European taurine|European stock]] around 5000 BP and [[African taurine|African stock]] being around 9000 BP, even if this date of [[domestication]] is a point of [[controversy]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The [[Domestication|domestication process]] is sometimes glossed over as an invention by humans and not a process that is [[Biology|biological]] and [[evolution]]ary.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; But Diane Gifford-Gonzalez argues that [[Domestication of animals|animal domestication]] is an ongoing, dynamic system of interaction with animals that causes lasting changes to that animal.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; [[Domestication]] is more of a [[Coevolution|co-evolution]] for the animals because the [[Reproduction|reproducing]] animals are usually chosen by the humans and they are now living in a human-structured environment which changes their behavior.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Not only do the animals change their behavior, humans also change their behavior to be able to coexist alongside the animals.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Sometimes the [[gene]]s inside the humans can actually change; like in [[Eurasia]] and [[East Africa]], adult [[gene]]s changed to accommodate the influx of milk in their diets and to allow them digest it.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Through the [[Selective breeding|selective-breeding]] that these animals are put through throughout the process of [[domestication]], there is also the ‘unconscious selection’ that goes along with it.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These 'unconscious selections' usually refer to the physical characteristics of the animal; such as [[wolves]] looking more like modern-day [[dog]]s after 10 [[generation]]s of [[Selective breeding|selective-breeding]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The reason inherently [[Africa]]n animals like [[gazelle]]s and [[monkey]]s were not able to be [[Domestication|domesticated]] was to do with some of the animal's traits.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; [[Gazelle]]s for example are prone to getting panicked when they are caged and mortally injure themselves from trying to jump out.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; G[[Genetic analysis|enetic studies]] may clarify whether or not animals such as cattle were independently domesticated in [[North Africa|northern Africa]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The '''''Eliza Battle''''' was a [[Tombigbee River]] [[steamboat]] that ran a route between [[Columbus, Mississippi]] and [[Mobile, Alabama]] during the 1850s. She was destroyed in a fire on the river near modern [[Pennington, Alabama]] on March 1, 1858. It was the greatest [[maritime disaster]] in Tombigbee River history, with an estimated thirty-three people killed, out of roughly sixty passengers and a crew of forty-five.&lt;ref name="tombigbee"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Tombigbee River Steamboats: Rollodores, Dead heads, and Side-wheelers |last=Ward |first=Rufus |year=2010 |publisher=History Press |location=Charleston, South Carolina |isbn=978-1-59629-285-7 |pages=69–92 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimeselizabattle"&gt;{{cite news |title=Burning of the Steamer Eliza Battle |newspaper=New York Times |date=4 March 1858 |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1858/03/12/78531487.pdf |accessdate=9 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disaster and its aftermath saw the ''Eliza Battle'' enter southwestern [[Alabama]] [[folklore]] as a [[List of ghost ships|ghost ship]], with numerous purported sightings of the burning ship from just north of Pennington to [[Nanafalia, Alabama|Nanafalia]] downriver. The story of the disaster and associated folklore has been fictionalized in several published short stories, most notably in “The Phantom Steamboat of the Tombigbee” in ''[[13 Alabama Ghosts and Jeffrey]]''.&lt;ref name="jeffrey"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Windham |first1=Kathryn Tucker |last2=Figh |first2=Margaret Gillis |year =1969 |title=13 Alabama Ghosts and Jeffrey |publisher=Strode Publishers |isbn=0-8173-0376-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The ''Eliza Battle'' was launched  in [[New Albany, Indiana]] in 1852.  A side-wheeled [[paddle steamer]], the wooden-hulled ship had a size of 316 tons.  She was operated out of [[Mobile, Alabama]] by the firm of Cox, Brainard and Company.  One of the most luxurious [[riverboat]]s plying the state's waters at that time, former [[President of the United States|President]] [[Millard Fillmore]] was entertained during a reception on board the ship in Mobile on April 7, 1854.&lt;ref name="tombigbee"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimeselizabattle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimesfillmore"&gt;{{cite news |title=Reception of Ex-President Fillmore |newspaper=New York Times |date=8 April 1854 |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1854/04/14/76436322.pdf |accessdate=9 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disaster==
[[File:Tombigbee River below Moscow Landing in 1888.jpg|thumb|1888 photograph of the Tombigbee River below [[Moscow, Alabama|Moscow]] Landing, near the site of the disaster.]]
Captained by S. Graham Stone and with Daniel Epps as pilot, the ''Eliza Battle'' departed Columbus in the last days of February 1858.  Only able to negotiate the Tombigbee that far north during the regular flooding of the river during the winter months, the ship made its way downriver with stops at [[Pickensville, Alabama|Pickensville]], [[Gainesville, Alabama|Gainesville]], [[Demopolis, Alabama|Demopolis]] and numerous small river [[Landing (water transport)|landings]].  By the time that the ship left Demopolis, on February 28, 1858, she was fully loaded with passengers and more than 1200 bales of [[cotton]].  During an already cold night, a strong [[north wind]] began to blow, with the air temperature decreasing another 40&amp;nbsp;°F in the two hours after nightfall.&lt;ref name="tombigbee"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bhamnews"&gt;{{cite news |title=Recollections: Eliza Battle |author=Emmet Calhoun |newspaper=Birmingham News |date=14 August 1942 |url = http://www.riverboatdaves.com/aboutboats/eliza_battle.htm |accessdate=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At roughly 2 a.m. on March 1, 1858, about {{convert|32|mi|km}} downriver from Demopolis, near Beckley’s Landing ({{Coord|32.28486|-87.92779|display=inline}}), it was discovered that cotton bales on the main deck were on fire. Partially attributed to the strong winds, the fire soon spread out of control. The boat continued downstream out of control. Cut off from the lifeboat by the flames, the passengers, dressed only in their nightclothes, were forced to seek refuge in the icy river. Some survived by floating atop cotton bales. The ''Eliza Battle'' finally came to rest above Kemp's Landing ({{Coord|32.24359|-88.01238|display=inline,title}}), near the modern [[Alabama State Route 114]] bridge over the river near Pennington. The survivors were rescued by the ''Magnolia'' and local residents, with some passengers having to be retrieved from treetops along the flooded river. All of the casualties were attributed to drowning or exposure to the extreme cold during the night.  The ship sank below the waters of the Tombigbee following the disaster, with the hull of the wreck remaining on the river bottom in {{convert|28|ft|m||abbr=on}} of water to the present day.&lt;ref name="tombigbee"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimeselizabattle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bhamnews"/&gt;

==Folklore==
In [[Kathryn Tucker Windham|Kathryn Tucker Windham's]] ''13 Alabama Ghosts and Jeffrey'' the disaster and folklore concerning the ghost ship is recorded as “The Phantom Steamboat of the Tombigbee”. The story roughly follows newspaper accounts of the disaster. It is purported in the story that sightings of the ship tend to happen on cold and windy winter nights, with the ship, fully engulfed in flames, appearing on the river near the same locations where the disaster occurred. It also relates that the sightings are said by river-men to foretell of impending disaster and are an ill omen to ships still plying the waters of the river.&lt;ref name="jeffrey"/&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''''Extermination of Evil'''''|辟邪絵|Hekija-E}} is a set of five paintings depicting [[List of Asian mythologies|traditional Asian deities]] banishing evil. The paintings are collectively listed as a [[List of National Treasures of Japan (paintings)|National Treasure of Japan]] and held at the [[Nara National Museum]].

==Overview==
The paintings are thought to have been created during the 12th century, during the reign of [[Emperor Go-Shirakawa]] in the [[Heian period]];{{sfn|e-Museum, Extermination of Evil}} they may have also been produced during the Kamakura period.{{sfn|Bunka.nii.ac.jp, 紙本著色辟邪絵}} The [[Japanese calligraphy|calligrapher]] is thought to be the same on the five scrolls as on the [[Hell Scroll (Tokyo National Museum)|Hell Scroll]] and the Demon of Punishment,{{sfn|e-Museum, Extermination of Evil}} which were produced at roughly the same time.{{sfn|Bunka.nii.ac.jp, 紙本著色辟邪絵}} They are thought to have originally been a single handscroll,{{sfn|e-Museum, Extermination of Evil}}{{sfn|Bunka.nii.ac.jp, 紙本著色辟邪絵}} known as the "second edition of the Masuda family Hell Scroll", that was stored in the Rengeō-in Temple (now [[Sanjūsangen-dō]]).

[[Image:Fasces.svg|thumb|upright=0.4|A ''fasces'' image, with the axe in the middle of the bundle of rods]]
'''Fasces''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|ˈ|f|æ|s|iː|z}}, {{IPA-la|ˈfa.skeːs|lang}}; a ''[[plurale tantum]]'', from the [[Latin]] word ''[[wikt:en:fascis#Latin|fascis]]'', meaning "bundle";&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webster.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=fasces Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary]: fasces&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-it|fascio littorio}}) is a bound bundle of wooden rods, sometimes including an axe with its blade emerging. The fasces had its origin in the [[Etruscan civilization]] and was passed on to [[ancient Rome]], where it symbolized a [[magistrate]]'s [[Power (social and political)|power]] and [[jurisdiction]]. The axe originally associated with the symbol, the [[Labrys]] ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|xld-Grek|λάβρυς}}, ''{{lang|xld-Latn|lábrys}}'') the double-[[Axe#Parts of the axe|bitted]] [[axe]], originally from [[Crete]], is one of the oldest symbols of Greek civilization. To the Romans, it was known as a ''bipennis''.&lt;ref&gt;the term for a single-bladed axe being ''hēmipelekys'' "half-pelekys", e.g. [[Iliad|Il]]. 23.883.&lt;/ref&gt; Commonly, the symbol was associated with [[female deities]], from prehistoric through historic times.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The image has survived in the modern world as a representation of magisterial or collective power, law and governance. The fasces frequently occurs as a [[Charge (heraldry)|charge]] in [[heraldry]]: it is present on the reverse of the U.S. [[Mercury dime]] coin and behind the podium in the [[United States House of Representatives]]; and it was the origin of the name of the [[National Fascist Party]] in Italy (from which the term ''[[fascism]]'' is derived).

During the first half of the 20th century both the fasces and the [[swastika]] (each symbol having its own unique ancient religious and mythological associations) became heavily identified with the [[authoritarian]]/[[Fascism|fascist]] political movements of [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Benito Mussolini]].  During this period the swastika became deeply stigmatized, but the fasces did not undergo a similar process.

The fact that the fasces remained in use in many societies after [[World War II]] may have been due to the fact that prior to Mussolini the fasces had already been adopted and incorporated within the governmental iconography of many governments outside Italy. As such, its use persists as an accepted form of governmental and other iconography in various contexts. (The [[swastika]] remains in common usage in parts of Asia for religious purposes which are also unrelated to early 20th century European fascism.)

The fasces is sometimes confused with the related term ''[[fess]]'', which in [[French heraldry]] is called a ''fasce''.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Origin and symbolism==
[[File:Fasces in the Sheldonian Theatre.jpg|thumb|Ornamentation consisting of fasces held in the mouth of a lion inside the [[Sheldonian Theatre]] at Oxford University]]
A few artifacts found showing a thin bundle of rods surrounding a two-headed axe point to a possible Etruscan origin for fasces, but little is known about the Etruscans themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Haynes, S. (2000). Etruscan civilization: A cultural history. Los Angeles: J. Paul Getty Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; Fasces symbolism might be derived via the Etruscans from the eastern Mediterranean, with the [[labrys]], the [[Anatolia]]n, and [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] double-headed axe, later incorporated into the [[praetor]]ial fasces. There is little archaeological evidence for precise claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/fa-fn/fasces/fasces.html|accessdate=2011-04-13|title=Fasces|date=2011-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of the [[Roman Republic]], the fasces had developed into a thicker bundle of [[Betula pubescens|birch]] rods, sometimes surrounding a single-headed axe and tied together with a red leather ribbon into a cylinder. On certain special occasions, the fasces might be decorated with a [[laurel wreath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/fa-fn/fasces/fasces.html|accessdate=2011-04-13|title=Fasces|date=2011-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The symbolism of the fasces could suggest strength through unity (see [[Unity makes strength]]); a single rod is easily broken, while the bundle is very difficult to break. This symbolism occurs in [[Aesop's Fables|Aesop's fable]] "[[The Old Man and his Sons]]". A similar story is told about the [[Bulgar]] (pre-Bulgarian, proto-Bulgarian) Khan [[Kubrat]], giving rise to the Bulgarian national motto "Union gives strength" (Съединението прави силата). However, bundled birch twigs could also symbolise [[corporal punishment]] (see [[birching]]).

==Republican Rome==
The ''fasces lictoriae'' ("bundles of the lictors") [[symbol]]ised power and authority (''[[imperium]]'') in ancient [[Rome]], beginning with the early [[Roman Kingdom]] and continuing through the republican and [[Roman Empire|imperial]] periods. By republican times, use of the fasces was surrounded with tradition and protocol. A corps of ''apparitores'' (subordinate officials) called [[lictors]] each carried fasces before a [[Roman magistrate|magistrate]], in a number corresponding to his rank. Lictors preceded [[Roman consul|consul]]s (and [[proconsul]]s), [[praetor]]s (and [[propraetor]]s), [[Roman dictator|dictator]]s, curule [[aedile]]s, [[quaestor]]s, and the [[Flamen Dialis]] during [[Roman triumph]]s (public celebrations held in Rome after a military conquest).

According to Livy, it is likely that the lictors were an Etruscan tradition, adopted by Rome.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 1:8&lt;/ref&gt; The highest magistrate, the ''[[Roman dictator|dictator]]'', was entitled to twenty-four lictors and fasces, the consul to twelve, the proconsul eleven, the praetor six (two within the ''[[pomerium]]''), the propraetor five, and the curule aediles two.

Another part of the symbolism developed in Republican Rome was the inclusion of just a single-headed axe in the fasces, with the blade projecting from the bundle. The axe indicated that the magistrate's judicial powers (''[[imperium]]'') included capital punishment. Fasces carried within the ''[[Pomerium]]''—the boundary of the sacred inner city of Rome—had their axe blades removed; within the city, the power of life and death rested with the people through their assemblies. During times of emergency, however, the Roman Republic might choose a dictator to lead for a limited time period, who was the only magistrate to be granted capital punishment authority within the Pomerium. Lictors attending the dictator kept the axes in their fasces even inside the Pomerium—a sign that the dictator had the ultimate power in his own hands. There were exceptions to this rule: in 48 BC, guards holding bladed fasces guided [[Publius Servilius Vatia Isauricus (consul 48 BCE)|Vatia Isauricus]] to the tribunal of [[Marcus Caelius Rufus|Marcus Caelius]], and Vatia Isauricus used one to destroy Caelius's magisterial chair (''[[Curule Chair|sella curulis]]'').{{Clear}}

An occasional variation on the fasces was the addition of a [[laurel wreath]], symbolizing victory. This occurred during the celebration of a ''[[Roman triumph|Triumph]]'' - essentially a victory parade through Rome by a returning victorious general. Previously, all Republican Roman commanding generals had held high office with imperium, and so, already were entitled to the lictors and fasces.

==Usage==
The modern Italian word ''[[fascio]]'', used in the twentieth century to designate peasant cooperatives and industrial workers' unions, is related to ''fasces''.

Numerous governments and other authorities have used the image of the ''fasces'' as a [[symbol]] of [[power (sociology)|power]] since the end of the [[Roman Empire]]. It also has been used to hearken back to the Roman republic, particularly by those who see themselves as modern-day successors to the old republic or its ideals.

[[Coat of arms of Ecuador|The Ecuadorian coat of arms]] incorporated the fasces in 1830, although it had already been in use in the coat of arm of [[Gran Colombia]] since 1821.

[[Italian Fascism]], which derives its name from the ''fasces'', arguably used this symbolism the most in the twentieth century. The [[British Union of Fascists]] also used it in the 1930s. The ''fasces'', as a widespread and long-established symbol in the West, however, has avoided the [[social stigma|stigma]] associated with much of [[fascist symbolism]], and many authorities continue to display them, including the federal government of the United States.

===France===
A review of the images included in ''Les Grands Palais de France ''Fontainebleau'' ''&lt;ref&gt;''Les Grands Palais de France '''Fontainebleau''', I re Série, Styles Louis XV, Louis XVI, Empire, Labrairie Centrale D'Art Et D'Architecture, Ancienne Maison Morel, Ch. Eggimann, Succ, 106, Boulevard Saint Germain, Paris, 1910&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Les Grands Palais de France : Fontainebleau '', II me Série, Les Appartments D'Anne D'Autriche, De François I er, Et D'Elenonre La Chapelle, Labrairie Centrale D'Art Et D'Architecture, Ancienne Maison Morel, Ch. Eggimann, Succ, 106, Boulevard Saint Germain, Paris, 1912&lt;/ref&gt; reveals that French architects used the Roman fasces (''faisceaux romains'') as a decorative device as early as the reign of [[Louis XIII]] (1610–1643) and continued to employ it through the periods of [[Napoleon I]]'s Empire (1804–1815).

The fasces typically appeared in a context reminiscent of the [[Roman Republic]] and of the [[Roman Empire]]. The [[French Revolution]] used many references to the ancient [[Roman Republic]] in its imagery. During the [[French First Republic|First Republic]], topped by the [[Phrygian cap]], the fasces is a tribute to the Roman Republic and means that power belongs to the people. It also symbolizes the "unity and indivisibility of the Republic",&lt;ref name="elysee1"&gt;[http://www.elysee.fr/president/la-presidence/les-symboles-de-la-republique-francaise/le-faisceau-de-licteur/le-faisceau-de-licteur.5979.html Site of the French Presidency] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104072203/http://www.elysee.fr/president/la-presidence/les-symboles-de-la-republique-francaise/le-faisceau-de-licteur/le-faisceau-de-licteur.5979.html |date=November 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as stated in the [[French Constitution]]. [[French Revolution of 1848|In 1848]] and [[Government of National Defense|after 1870]], it appears on the [[Seal (emblem)|seal]] of the French Republic, held by the goddess, [[Liberty (goddess)|Liberty]]. There is the fasces in the [[National Emblem of France|arms of the French Republic]] with the "RF" for ''République française'' (see image below), surrounded by leaves of [[olive tree]] (as a symbol of [[peace]]) and [[oak]] (as a symbol of [[justice]]). While it is used widely by French officials, this symbol never was officially adopted by the government.&lt;ref name="elysee1"/&gt;

The fasces appears on the helmet and the buckle insignia of the French Army's [[Autonomous Corps of Military Justice]], as well as on that service's distinct cap badges for the prosecuting and defending lawyers in a court-martial.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

===United States===
[[File:National Guard Bureau (insignia).svg|thumb|[[National Guard Bureau]] insignia]]
Since the original founding of the United States in the 18th century, several offices and institutions in the United States have heavily incorporated representations of the ''fasces'' into much of their iconography.

* In the [[Oval Office]], above the door leading to the exterior walkway, and above the corresponding door on the opposite wall, which leads to the president's private office; note: the fasces depicted have no axes, possibly because in the [[Roman Republic]], the blade was always removed from the bundle whenever the ''fasces'' were carried inside the city, in order to symbolize the rights of citizens against arbitrary state power (see above)
* Two fasces appear on either side of the [[flag of the United States]] behind the podium in the [[United States House of Representatives]], and were added to the chamber's decor during the remodeling project of 1950.&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.house.gov/Exhibitions-and-Publications/Capitol/1951-Present/ US House of Representatives: Chamber, 1951–Present] history.house.gov website.

The '''Gray's Inn Lane Hand Axe''' is a pointed flint [[hand axe]], found buried in gravel under [[Gray's Inn Road|Gray's Inn Lane]], London, England, by pioneering archaeologist [[John Conyers (apothecary)|John Conyers]] in 1679, and now in the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref name="British Museum"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/p/pointed_flint_handaxe.aspx |title=British Museum – Pointed flint handaxe |first= |last=British Museum|work=britishmuseum.org |year=2011|quote=Gray's Inn Road, London, England This flint handaxe was found in gravel near the bones of an elephant by John Conyers in 1679. |accessdate=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The hand axe is a fine example from about 350,000 years ago, in the [[Lower Paleolithic]] period, but its main significance lies in the role it and the circumstances of its excavation played in the emerging understanding of the early history of mankind.

==Discovery and history==
John Conyers was present at the excavation in 1679 of the remains of a supposed [[elephant]] at [[Battlebridge]] in gravel;&lt;ref name="British history"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22095 |title=Archaeology – The Lower Palaeolithic Age &amp;#124; A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 1 (pp. 11–21) |first=J S |last=Cockburn|first2=H P F |last2=King|first3=K J T |last3=McDonnell|work=british-history.ac.uk |year=2011 |quote=At the end of the century a Mr. Conyers found, opposite 'Black Mary's' near Gray's Inn Lane, a handaxe associated with the tooth of an elephant, (fn. 2) probably that of either a mammoth or the straight-tusked elephant (E. antiquus). John Bagford in a letter dated 1715 suggested that this elephant was probably introduced by Claudius, but at the same time accepted the implement as being of human workmanship. |accessdate=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Levine141&gt;Levine, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; the site was near [[Gray's Inn Lane]], opposite "Black Mary's", and the remaining tooth was later thought to be of a [[mammoth]] or [[straight-tusked elephant]].&lt;ref name=VCH&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22095 ''British History Online'']&lt;/ref&gt; A pointed flint [[hand axe]] was found nearby,&lt;ref name=Levine141/&gt;

At the time, it was commonly thought that humans had been on earth for a relatively short period of time,&lt;ref name="British Museum"/&gt; and that stone tools were used by people who simply lacked the knowledge to create metal tools.&lt;ref name="British Museum"/&gt;

Conyers was the first to argue that it was a human artefact.&lt;ref name="British history"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lamas.org.uk/archives/t35-john-conyers.html |title=Archive of Transactions:  John Conyers, London’s first archaeologist|first=Juanita |last=Burnby |work=lamas.org.uk |year=2008|accessdate=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=56834|title=Conyers, John|first=Juanita|last=Burnby}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Conyers' death, [[John Bagford]] (1650–1716) published the discovery,&lt;ref name="Evans1897"&gt;{{cite book|author=J.

It was first reported by John Bagford in Hearne's edition of Leland, Collectanea, i, p. lxiv. }}&lt;/ref&gt; rejecting the idea that the assemblage of elephant bones and stone axe had originated from the time of [[flood myth|Noah's flood]], arguing instead for its origin in the Roman period under the [[Emperor Claudius]];&lt;ref name="British Museum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="British history"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Levine141/&gt; this was in a letter of 1715, in which Bagford accepted the human origin of the handaxe.&lt;ref name="British history"/&gt;&lt;ref name=VCH/&gt; With other items from Conyers' collection, the handaxe passed to the collection of [[Sir Hans Sloane]], whose own collection was one of the founding collections of the British Museum.

According to the British Museum website, the hand axe is now estimated to be about 350,000 years old. Elephants were living in Britain at this time, during a period in the [[Ice age]] when the climate was similar to that of today.&lt;ref name="British Museum"/&gt; The hand axe is currently displayed in the "Enlightenment Gallery" of the British Museum, which is housed in the [[King's Library]].

[[File:Hacibektas-09-superchango.jpg|thumb|200px|Haji Bektash Veli Complex]]

The '''Haji Bektash Veli complex''' ({{lang-tr|Hacıbektaş Külliyesi}}) is an [[Alevism|Alevi]] Cultural Monument of the Republic of [[Turkey]], located in [[Hacıbektaş]], [[Nevsehir Province|Nevshehir province]]. It was built in the 13th century as a [[khanqah|Teqe]] (''dergâh'') of the [[Sufism|Sufi]] saint [[Haji Bektash Veli]]. After his death, his [[mausoleum]] was built here. After the [[Atatürk's Reforms|European reforms]] of the founding father of Turkey, [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] and the exodus of the [[Bektashi order]] to [[Albania]] in 1925, the complex was closed declared as museum in 1964. The khanqa of the complex is thought to be the very first "King type" khanqa in Turkey.

Nowadays it is still visited by hundreds of thousands of Alevis, Bektashis and even Sunnis Muslims from Turkey, Albania and the [[Turkish diaspora]] in Europe and the Americas alike. Large festivals are held here every August. Since 2012, the Haji Bektash Veli complex is on the [[World Heritage Sites]] [[List of World Heritage Sites in Turkey (Tentative list)|Tentative list]] of the [[UNESCO]].

'''Hajj Nematollah''' ({{lang-fa|حاجی نعمت‌الله}} 1871 &amp;ndash; February 28, 1920) was an influential [[mysticism|mystic]] and religious leader of the  [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar Empire]]. He was born in [[Jeyhounabad]], [[Iran]] and is considered one of the greatest leaders and mystics in [[Kurdish history|Kurdish]] and [[Ahl-e Haqq]] history.&lt;ref&gt;Minorsky, Dr. Vladimir. "Notes sur la secte des Ahl-I Haqq", (Deuxieme partie), in ''Revue du Monde Musulman'', Volumes XLIV-XLV, 1921, 205-302.&lt;/ref&gt; Two of his most famous works of poetry and history are ''Furqān al-Akhbar'' (aka "The Firkan") and ''Ḥaqq al-Ḥaqāyiq yā Shāhnāmah-ʾi Ḥaqīqat''.&lt;ref&gt;1966, Bibliothèque Iranienne, Librairie D’Amerique Et D’Orient Adrien - Maisonneuve&lt;/ref&gt; According to Encyclopædia Britannica, "The chief source of information about the Ahl-e Haqq is the ''Firqan al-Akhbar'', written in... early 20th century by (Hajj Nemat)…"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-208035/Firqan-al-Akhbar FirqÄn al-AkhbÄr -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111202172642/http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-208035/Firqan-al-Akhbar|date=December 2, 2011}} at www.britannica.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Hajj Nemat's great-grandfather, Bayan Beg, accompanied Aga Abbas (one of the successors of Shah Hayas) to Jeyhounabad in the late 18th century. Bayan Beg's son, Esmail Beg, was Hajj Nemat’s grandfather.&lt;ref&gt;Elahi, Nur Ali. Asar ol-haqq, Vol 1, #1849&lt;/ref&gt;

Nematollah Jeyhounabadi was born in 1871 (1288 [[Islamic calendar|Hijri calendar]]) in the small village of Kurdish Jeyhounabad. Before his birth, Persia was going through one of the worst droughts in history. His father, Bayan, named him Nematollah ("Grace of God") because on the day of his birth, Iran finally received the rain it so desperately needed.

In 1893 he married Sakina and they had their first child, Nur Ali Elahi, in 1895. At the age of thirty, during a grave illness, he claimed that he went on a journey to the beyond where he was appointed by God to announce the imminent return of the divine. Thousands of people flocked around him, and on his command ceased to take tea, tobacco and opium. He “believed the time had come to reveal the Real Truth”, and “by God’s command abandoned the world and became the messenger of the [[Muhammad al-Mahdi|Lord of the Hour]]”. After the advent was postponed twice, he went silent and waited for the Great Essence to appear.&lt;ref&gt;Stead, F.D. The Ali Ilahi Sect in Persia, in: The Moslem World, April 1932, Vol XXII, No. 2, page 188&lt;/ref&gt;

==His family==

Hajj Nemat was married to Sakina Khanoom, with whom he had 7 children. They had 3 sons, and four daughters. The names of his sons were [[Nur Ali Elahi]], Yar Ali, Bahram, and his daughters were [[Malak Jân Nemati]], Javaher, and Mariam. In the last few days of his life Hajj Nemat had predicted his own death. Within 48 hours of his death his first grandchild, Hajj Amin Elahi, was born.

==''Forqan ol-Akhbar''==

The original manuscript of ''Forqan ol-Akhbar'' was completed in 1910 by  Hajj Nemat and is written in four parts.&lt;ref&gt;Minorsky, Dr. Vladimir. "Etudes sur les Ahl-I Haqq, I. Toumari=Ahl-I Haqq", ''Revue de L’Histoire des Religions'', volume XCVII, No. 1, January 1928, pp. 90-105.&lt;/ref&gt; His son [[Nur Ali Elahi]] wrote an introduction to ''Forqan ol-Akhbar'' and the biography of his father under the title of ''Kashf Al-Haqa’iq'' (which is approximately the first 14 pages of the manuscript, and features Nur Ali Elahi's calligraphy). ''Forqan ol-Akhbar'' is the only manuscript entirely handwritten by Hajj Nemat and is considered a historical masterpiece. Hajj Nemat gave the manuscript to [[Saeed Khan Kordestani|Dr. Saeed Khan Kordestani]] in order for him to transport it to France to have it translated by [[Vladimir Minorsky|Dr. Vladimir Minorsky]]. Unfortunately Dr. Minorsky died in 1966 before the manuscript was fully translated and published. After Minorsky’s death the manuscript became misplaced and remains unpublished as of this date.

===Part one===
The first part of ''Forqan ol-Akhbar'' deals with the fundamental principles of the ''haqiqat'' established in pre-eternity by the Divinity who in the stage of ''ya-yi ghaybat'' became externalized in the garment of Khawandagar. The law remained concealed till the coming of [[Sultan Sahak]]. Then the ''daftardars'' recorded these doctrines, but each in his own way and according to the sources which were accessible to him. As a result, the Ahl-e Haqq community has no single sacred book, and its divisions are distinguished by different views. The Ahl-e Haqq required a ''kutb-I kull'' which would be unique. So after 1324/1906 Ne’matollah, by God’s command, abandoned the world and became the "messenger of the Lord of the hour", of Pir Benyamin (explained as bin + ya + amin "faithful son of Ya"). Then comes the explanation of [[reincarnation]] (''gardish-e dun be-dun'', "going from one garment to another"). The creatures of the world are divided into two distinct categories according to their original element (''zarda-gil'' or ''khak-i siyah''). To the first belong the saved and luminous beings, whose receptive ''[[sardar]]s'' are Benyamin and Sayyid Muhammad (in his [[Avatar]] of Buzurg-sawar). To the other category belong beings of fire and darkness whose respective sardars are [[Iblis]] and [[Khannas]], with whom are associated the first three [[caliph]]s, [[Mu’awiya]], [[Aisha]], etc. The intermixture of the two categories of beings produces combinations which may be externally recognized.

===Part two===
The second part of the treatise is mainly concerned with the correspondence of the avatars through the ages. Thus manifestations of Benyamin are [[Noah]], [[Jesus]] and provisionally (''mihman'') Rustam of the Persian epic; those of Razbar: [[Sheba|Bilkis]], the Queen of Saba; [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], the mother of Jesus, etc.; those of Sayyid Muhammad: [[Zoroaster]], [[Muhammad]], etc. Next we are given the history of [[Sultan Sahak]] (Ishak) and of his successors.

===Part three===
The third part relates the personal experiences of Hajj Ne’matollah and the commandments which he received from God during his journey to the beyond (''safar-I ukba''), notably his mission to unite the 12 Ahl-e Haqq [[khanadans]], to give absolution from sins (''az khiyanat pak namudan'') and to intercede (''shifa’at'') with the Lord of Time.

===Part four===
The fourth part is a full description of rites and customs (''amr wa-nahy''), with the [[Gurani]] text of the formulae recited on each occasion.

== Ḥaqq al-Ḥaqāyiq yā Shāhnāmah-ʾi Ḥaqīqat==
The style of Ḥaqq al-Ḥaqāyiq yā Shāhnāmah-ʾi Ḥaqīqat is poetic. There is an entire chapter about [[Ali]], "The beginning was Ali and the end is Ali. Both worlds are luminous from the light of Ali. Ali is the manifestation of the pure essence of God, He is the King and Lord of both worlds. A sparkle of His essence, like the sun appeared at my time. I became so illuminated by him, that I knew of no God, other than Him."&lt;ref&gt;Hajj Nematollah,  Ḥaqq al-Ḥaqāyiq yā Shāhnāmah-ʾi Ḥaqīqat, page 394 (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other works==
Hajj Nemat wrote about 20 books and essays. Among them is [[Edalat Nameh]] (The book of Justice) which is concerning government. [[Forqan ol-Akhbar]], [[Shah-Nama]], and [[Kuch-e Kurdi]] (in Kurdish verse) are all about the same subject. He also has a "Masnavi" in Persian and there is a book of his predictions. In this book, the duration of the [[Pahlavi dynasty]] and their destiny in [[World War II]] can be found and there are also predictions about World War III and other subjects.

'''Ihuatzio''' is an archeological site located at the southern slopes of "Cerro Tariaqueri", just north of the Ihuatzio town, in the [[Tzintzuntzan, Michoacán|Tzintzuntzan]] municipality, of [[Michoacán]] state.&lt;ref name= Cambio   /&gt;

The ancient site is some 7 kilometers south-east of Tzintzuntzan, on the south-eastern shore of the [[Lake Pátzcuaro]]. Human settlements vestiges are registered from two different occupational periods; the first occurred between 900 and 1200 CE, corresponding to Nahuatl language speaking groups; the second group corresponding to the maximum development reached by the [[Purépecha people|Purépecha]] Culture, between 1200 and 1530 CE.

This archaeological site was built on an artificially leveled plateau, and it is considered very important, for the Michoacán prehispanic history, it was an astronomical observatory and ceremonial center. Although it is relatively small, the pyramids dedicated to "Curicaueri" and "Xaratanga"&lt;ref name=UNM&gt;{{cite web|first=|last=|title=Ihuatzio|url=http://www.umich.mx/mich/islas-patzcuaro/Ihuatzio.html|publisher=Panorama de Michoacan, Universidad Michoacana|location=|language=Spanish|trans-title=|accessdate=Sep 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228221453/http://www.umich.mx/mich/islas-patzcuaro/Ihuatzio.html|archivedate=2009-02-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; are remarkable. A sculpture representing a [[Chac Mool]]&lt;ref&gt;Chac-Mool is the name given to a type of Prehispanic Mesoamerican stone statue, it depicts a human figure in a reclining position with the head up and turned to one side, holding a tray over the stomach. Chac-Mool statues are found in or around temples in Toltec and other post-Classic central Mexican sites, and in post-Classic Maya civilization sites with heavy Toltec influence, such as Chichen Itza.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Toltec]] culture characteristic element) was found; as well as a series of roads and walls surrounding the site.&lt;ref name=INAH&gt;{{cite journal |author2= Villanueva Medina, Eugenia F. |author= Cárdenas García, Efraín |title=INAH Michoacán, página web Ihuatzio |trans-title=Michoacan INAH Web Site for Ihuatzio|journal=INAH|location=Mexico |url= http://www.gobiernodigital.inah.gob.mx/ZonasArqueologicas/todas/htme/za01302.html|language=Spanish |accessdate= July 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prehispanic settlement fully covers a low-lying plateau and kept a strategic location at the extreme west of the Lake and other dominant sites as Tzintzuntzan.&lt;ref name=Cambio   &gt;{{cite web |first=  Heriberto|last=  Cortés Vélez |title= Michoacán y su historia a través de sus zonas arqueológicas   |url=http://www.cambiodemichoacan.com.mx/imprime.php?id=41238  |publisher= Cambio de Michoacán|location=  |language= Spanish |trans-title=Michoacán and its history through its archaeological zones  |date=March 27, 2006 |accessdate= Sep 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
According to the archeological evidence, there has been human habitation within the territory of Michoacán state for at least 10,000 years.&lt;ref name="elochis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_michoacan |title=Historia |year=2009 |work=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México Michoacán |publisher=Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal, |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=History |accessdate=June 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517162648/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_michoacan |archivedate=May 17, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In prehispanic times there were a number of migration waves into the area including the Pirinda, Nahua, Huetamo, Colima, Purépecha and other peoples.&lt;ref name="prehis"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.umich.mx/mich/historia/prehisp.html |title= El Estado de Michoacán Epoca Prehispanica |publisher= UMSNH |location= Morelia, Michoacán |language= Spanish |trans-title=The State of Michoacan Pre-Hispanic Era |accessdate= June 16, 2010 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100124211111/http://www.umich.mx/mich/historia/prehisp.html |archivedate= January 24, 2010 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are sites of formal settlements from all Mesoamerican period. Important sites include [[El Opeño]] and those in [[Curutarán]], [[Tepalcatepec]] [[Apatzingán]], [[Zinapécuaro]] and [[Coalcomán de Vázquez Pallares|Coalcoman]]. The territory has been inhabited by the Nahuas, Otomis, [[Matlatzinca people|Matlatzinca]]s, Pirindas and Tecos as well as the Purépecha.&lt;ref name="elochis"/&gt;

The main prehispanic civilization of the state is that of the Purépecha, which was centered in the Lake Pátzcuaro area.&lt;ref name="elochis"/&gt; Before the 13th century, both Nahua and Purépecha peoples were here, sustaining themselves by agriculture and fishing. The Purépecha are descendants of a late arrival of [[Chichimeca]]s who came from the north. At Lake Pátzcuaro, they came upon people with similar cultures to their own but who were more technically and socially advanced. The formation of the Purépecha state began in the 13th century, when these people started their own dominion at Uayameo, today [[Santa Fe de la Laguna]] and becoming dominant over the entire Lake Pátzcuaro area by the 15th century. Conquest of neighboring tribes and territories occurred between 1401 and 1450, absorbing peoples with different cultures and languages into the empire. By the late 15th century, this state rivaled that of the Aztecs, expanding their territory over much of what is now Michoacán and into part of [[Colima]], [[Nayarit]], [[Querétaro]], [[Guanajuato]], [[Guerrero]] and [[Jalisco]]. The Aztecs attempted to invade Purépecha but were repelled. This would later cause the Purépecha to deny the Aztecs aid in the defense of [[Tenochtitlan]] against the Spanish.&lt;ref name="elochis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="prehis"/&gt;

The history of Michoacán has been studied from archaeological remains and other historical resources, such as the literary work "Relación de Michoacán"&lt;ref name=Jero   /&gt; written in 1542, and it is known that the first settlers of the state were several Chichimeca tribes which arrived in different epochs and consequently evolved differently.

The archeological sites found in the state, have helped clarify the history of the birth and development of ethnic groups which provided the essence of the [[Michoacán]] culture, dating back to the formative or Preclassical period (1500 to 200&amp;nbsp;BCE), the classical (800&amp;nbsp;BCE to 800 CE) and Postclassical (800 to 1000 CE), among whose sites are included: [[El Opeño]], Curutarán, la Villita, Tepalcatepec, Apatzingán, Zinapécuaro, Coalcomán, San Felipe de los Alzati, [[Tzintzuntzan (Mesoamerican site)|Tzintzuntzan]], Tingambato, Pátzcuaro, Zacapu, Uruapan, Tzitzio, etc.

The Michoacán territory was inhabited by the [[Purépecha people]], which developed as a dominant culture and imposed their economic, religious, military and [[cultural hegemony]] to other ethnic groups who also inhabited the region, as the [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]], [[Otomi people|Otomi]], [[Matlatzincas]] or Pirindas and Tecos. In the region, in addition to the Tarascan or Purépecha language, Coacomeca, Xilotlazinca Colimote dialects, Pirinda, Mazahua, Sayulteco, [[Nahuatl]] and Teca were spoken.

The area has been inhabited at least since the early [[Mesoamerican chronology|Pre-classic period]]. Early lithic evidence from before 2500&amp;nbsp;BC like [[Folsom point|fluted points]] and stone utensils are found at some [[Megafauna]] kill sites. The earliest radio-carbon dates of archeological sites fall around 1200&amp;nbsp;BC. The best known early preclassical culture of Michoacán was the [[Chupicuaro culture]]. Chupícuaro sites are mostly found on lake islands which can be seen as a sign of it having traits relating it to the later Tarascan cultural patterns. In the early Classical period, [[Mesoamerican Ballgame|ballcourts]] and other artifacts demonstrate a [[Teotihuacan]] influence in the Michoacán region.

In Michoacán there are over 45 known archaeological sites although only seven are open to the public, among these are Tzintzuntzan, Ihuatzio and Tingambato, which represent the rich Purépecha culture, although it is known that remains of previous cultures are hidden under the bases of these and other ceremonial centers.&lt;ref name=Esc   &gt;{{cite journal |last=Flores A. |first=Juan José   |date=Aug 22, 2010  |title= Tzintzuntzan, Ihuatzio y Tingambato, arqueología en Michoacán |trans-title=Tzintzuntzan, Ihuatzio and Tingambato, Michoacan archaeology |journal=Suite 101 Net  |location=  |url= |language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Purépecha people dominated a large territory which includes the States of Michoacán, Guanajuato, Querétaro, part of Jalisco and Guerrero, was an indomitable race that resisted the onslaught of the Aztecs, who could never dominate them, however, and due to their astronomical predictions voluntarily submitted to the Spanish domain, willingly converting to Christianity.&lt;ref name=Esc   /&gt;

===Toponymy===
The Ihuatzio name comes from the [[Purépecha language]] word Hihuatsi, that means "Coyotes Place".

From Information in the Relación de Michoacan,&lt;ref name=Jero   &gt;Jerónimo de Alcalá, 1542, Relación de Michoacán, Moisés Franco Mendoza (coord.), paleografía Clotilde Martínez Ibáñez y Carmen Molina Ruiz, México, El Colegio de Michoacán, Gobierno del Estado de Michoacán, 2000, p.321. {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; the place is also known by its Nahuatl name as Cuyacan or Cuyuacan (Coyoacan) and it is first mentioned when Tariácuri plans his attack to Tariaran.&lt;ref name= Claudia /&gt;

===Lake Patzcuaro===
'''Lake Pátzcuaro''' lies in an [[endorheic basin]], which does not drain to the sea. The Lake Pátzcuaro basin is of volcanic origin. At times it has been part of an open and continuous hydrological system formed by [[Lake Cuitzeo]], Pátzcuaro and [[Lake Zirahuén]], which drained into the [[Lerma River]]. Today, like lakes Cuitzeo and Zirahuén, it is a closed basin, although ecologists consider it a sub-basin of the Lerma-Chapala basin.&lt;ref&gt;"Descripción de la cuenca", ''Recuperación Ambiental del Lago de Pátzcuaro". Accessed October 18, 2009. [http://www.recuperapatzcuaro.info/cuenca.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lake Pátzcuaro basin is home to the [[Purépecha people]]. Purépecha leaders established the basin as the heartland of the [[Tarascan state]], which rivaled the [[Aztec Empire]] before the Spanish conquest. The towns of [[Ihuatzio]], [[Tzintzuntzan (Mesoamerican site)|Tzintzuntzan]] and [[Pátzcuaro]] were important Tarascan centers.

===Purépecha language===
{{main article|Purépecha language}}
The Purépecha language, is an [[language isolate|isolated language]], which is not even provisionally related to any other language. Spoken in the State of Michoacán, near Lake Pátzcuaro and the Parícutin volcano. There are two major variants and perhaps 12 minors; the main language stream occurs between the Lake and the volcanic plateau. Speakers easily identify others origin from their speech, and even the village of origin. They are proud to continue speaking their native language, even if they live elsewhere. However, dialectal differences are relatively recent, and speakers consider all variants as part of the same language.&lt;ref name=Purep  &gt;{{cite web |first=   |last=  |title=  Purépecha (p'orhépecha, p'urhépecha)|url= http://www.sil.org/MEXICO/tarasca/00e-tarasca.htm|publisher=Purépecha Instituto Lingüístico de Verano|location= |language= Spanish|trans-title=|accessdate=Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theories about the Purépecha origin vary. Some say that they came from the north with the Aztecs; others claim they came from the south and perhaps related to the [[Quechua languages|Quechua]]&lt;ref&gt;'''Quechua''' is a [[Native American language|Native South American]] [[language family]] and [[dialect cluster]] spoken primarily in the [[Andes]] of [[South America]], derived from an original common ancestor language, Proto-Quechua. It is the most widely spoken language family of the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]], with a total of probably some 6 to 8&amp;nbsp;million speakers (estimates vary widely). Some speakers of Quechua also call it 'runa simi' (or regional variants thereof), literally 'people speech', although 'runa' here has the more specific sense of ''indigenous Andean'' people.&lt;/ref&gt; from Ecuador, Bolivia and Peru. While their language is isolated, it shares some features with the [[Zuni language|Zuni]] &lt;ref&gt;'''Zuni''' (also '''Zuñi''') is a language of the [[Zuni people]], indigenous to western [[New Mexico]] and eastern [[Arizona]] in the [[United States]]. It is spoken by around 9,500 people worldwide, especially in the vicinity of [[Zuni Pueblo, New Mexico|Zuni Pueblo]], [[New Mexico]], and much smaller numbers in parts of [[Arizona]].&lt;/ref&gt;  and quechua (perhaps not more than borrowed features).&lt;ref name= Purep    /&gt;

[[Joseph Greenberg|Greenberg]] assigned it to the [[Chibchan]] language family, but this proposal was rejected by specialists.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg 1987&lt;/ref&gt; Statistical studies by [[Morris Swadesh|Swadesh]] have suggested relationships to Zuñi, Quechua, Mayan and Aymara, but these conclusions remain unproven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faculty.smu.edu/rkemper/anth_3311/anth_3311_adkins_tarascan_paper.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091219132626/http://faculty.smu.edu/rkemper/anth_3311/anth_3311_adkins_tarascan_paper.htm |archivedate=2009-12-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Desarrollo del sistema de casos del purépecha|author=Zarza, F.G.V.|date=2006|publisher=Centro de Investigaciones y Estudios Superiores en Antropología Social|isbn=9789684965928|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_93gl1oWtqgC|page=55|accessdate=June 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tarascan State===
{{main article|Tarascan State}}
The '''Tarascan state''' was a prehispanic Mesoamerican empire, roughly covering the geographic area of the present-day [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[States of Mexico|state]] of [[Michoacán]]. In [[Purépecha language|Purépecha]], language of the Purépecha, the name of the state was ''Iréchecua Tzintzuntzáni'', the "lands of Tzintzuntzan".

The Purépecha were a nomadic group that arrived in the basin of Lake Pátzcuaro. Their place of origin is unknown; however, it is known that their food and livelihood depended on their hunter-gatherer activities. The main events of society tarascan are described in the aforementioned "Relacion de Michoacan"; this 16th-century document mentions the Tarascan arrival at Zacapú, "Naranja de Tapia", where they established alliances through the marriage of Ireti-Ticátame ("guide and lord"), with a local woman. Later, they were forced to leave and headed towards the Patzcuaro Basin.&lt;ref name= Espe &gt;{{cite journal |last=Espejel Cruz |first=Ricardo   |date=Aug 31, 2003  |title= Ihuatzio, lugar de coyotes|trans-title=Ihuatzio, place of coyotes |journal=Morelia Hoy |location=Morelia Michoacán |url= http://www.espejel.com/ihuatzio.html |language=Spanish |accessdate=Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The people of the Tarascan empire were mostly of [[Purépecha people|Purépecha]] ethnic affiliation but also included other earlier ethnic groups such as the [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]], [[Otomi people|Otomi]], [[Matlatzinca people|Matlatzinca]] and [[Chichimec]]. These ethnic groups were gradually assimilated into the Purépecha majority group.

The Tarascan state was contemporary with and an enemy of the [[Aztec Empire]], against which it fought many wars. The Tarascan Empire blocked Aztec expansion to the northwest, and the Tarascans fortified and patrolled their frontiers with the Aztecs, possibly developing the first truly territorial state of Mesoamerica.

Due to its relative isolation within Mesoamerica, the Tarascan state had many cultural traits completely distinct from those of the Mesoamerican cultural group. It is particularly noteworthy for being among the few Mesoamerican civilizations to use metal for tools and ornamentation.

In the late mesoamerican classical period, at least two non Purépecha ethnic groups lived around Lake Pátzcuaro: Nahuatl speakers in Jarácuaro, and some Chichimecan cultures on the northern banks, with the Nahua population being the second largest.

===First Occupation===
A number of Nahua-speaking groups arrived to the area during the first stage. They already possessed a rudimentary food-production technology and probably had a sedentary mindset. Abundant food resources and other natural conditions were a determining factor in the formation and sustenance of the area's dense population. By the time of the second stage, the Tarascan group took control of a vast territory, settling in the Pátzcuaro watershed and setting up a tributary system based on their overwhelming military strength. Together with Tzintzuntzan and Pátzcuaro, Ihuatzio figured among the most important Tarascan settlements.

According to archaeologist Efraín Cárdenas, from archaeological evidence, the first occupation is tentatively chronologically located at between 900 and 1200 CE, corresponding to Nahuatl speaking groups.&lt;ref name= Cambio   /&gt;&lt;ref name= Espe    /&gt;

===Second Occupation===
During the second period the site is occupied by the Purépecha culture, according to archaeologist Efraín Cárdenas.&lt;ref name= Cambio   /&gt;

The second occupation period, chronologically placed at between 1200 and 1530 CE, corresponds to Tarascan domain, of the Lake Pátzcuaro basin and almost all the northern part of the State of Michoacán.&lt;ref name= Espe   /&gt;

It is very difficult to establish the site construction chronology exclusively from archaeological data. The "Relación de Michoacán" mentions that upon the death of Tariácuri, the most outstanding character of narration, the political and religious power he had was divided into three lordships: Pátzcuaro, Ihuatzio and Tzintzuntzan. These were governed by three major characters: his youngest son Huiquingaje and nephews Hiripan and Tangaxoan.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

This transcendental event of Tarascan (Purépecha) military and political development was described by Jerónimo de Alcalá&lt;ref&gt;Jerónimo de Alcalá was born in Murcia, Spain. Whether he was a converted catholic is argued, as it is not proved, although some authors consider it probable. He abandoned his religious vocation and became a doctor in Valencia. He was married twice.&lt;/ref&gt;  testimony as follows:

:::"... at the break of dawn, before daylight, Tariácuri climbed a mound called Thiapu, he cleared a section and made three dirt piles, he placed atop each a stone and an arrow. His nephews climbed the mound...[where Tariácuri stated:] Children hear me: look Hiripan, there will be three Lords. Yours is this pile which is in the middle, which is the village of Coyoacán [Ihuatzio]: and you Tangaxoán you're on this heap which is the village of Michoacán [Tzintzuntzan]; and you Huiquingaje, you're in this town is the village of Pátzcuaro. "Hence, there will be three Lords."&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

This event is very important to understand the growth and development of Ihuatzio, because of the initiative always shown by Hiripan during conquests, power again concentrated, but not in a particular person, but in a certain space: Ihuatzio. Radiocarbon dating place the site between 1510 and 1575 CE.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

===Investigations===
The first reference of existence of archaeological vestiges in this place goes back to 1799 from a Bravo Ugarte description, who contributed information about the constructive system, mentioning that it reflected a low technological level since lime and sand were not used; nevertheless, he made references to large site dimensions.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

Later, in 1855 friar Pedro Beaumont, in the Michoacán Chronicle, displays the first map of the Pátzcuaro Lake basin, with indication of the most important Tarascan establishments. Beaumont refers to Ihuatzio as one of the main tarascan establishments of the Pátzcuaro Lake basin.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

In 1929, Marquina for the first time made a survey of the site surface, describing and making sketches of the rectangular base structures. According to him, Ihuatzio is composed of two main groups: a platform oriented north-south 400 meters long by 300 wide. This platform is delimited by wide walls remains. On its center there are 3 yácatas&lt;ref name=Yacata &gt;Yácatas are structures of mixed plant, with a semi-circular section built over pyramids, in Tarascan language Yácata means a "pile of stones"&lt;/ref&gt; facing east. To the north of this platform is another one of smaller dimensions (300 by 180 meters) oriented east-west, also limited on its larger sides by tall staggered walls 10 meters wide that form a 223 by 147 meters plaza. This plaza has two rectangular structures, also facing east, seated on a common 87 by 37.5 meters platform.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

Between 1937 and 1938, Caso and Acosta performed excavations, release and consolidation works of the base rectangular structures took place. During these works the [[Chacmool]] was found, a ritual element that denotes a cultural contact with Toltec sites such as Tula where this archaeological element constitutes a distinguishing characteristic.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

The site was opened to the public in 1937–1938, although a visitor’s register only started in 1994.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

===History===
Historically speaking, Ihuatzio is mentioned as one of the three heads of the Purépecha or Tarascan Empire at the time when the group consolidated.

The activities performed by the Tarascan or P’urépechas at this site, were related to the economic and social organization of the different sectors of the prehispanic society and to activities of ritual and ceremonial character. This is deduced from archaeological findings, as well as written data available from sources during the Spanish conquest. These sources are; the Michoacán Chronicle, the Jucutacato canvas&lt;ref name=Grecia   &gt;{{cite web |first=   Grecia |last=  Ponce |title=  El Lienzo de Jucutacato, escrito en purépecha. Ensayo del investigador Carmelo Lopez|url=  http://www.cambiodemichoacan.com.mx/vernota.php?id=69012 |publisher=Cambio de Michoacán  |location= |language= Spanish|trans-title=The Jucutacato canvas, written in purépecha. Essay by researcher Carmelo Lopez. |date= September 20, 2007
|accessdate=Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the ceremonies and rites relation of population and government of the Indians of the province of Michoacán (simply known as Relation of Michoacán).&lt;ref name= Claudia    /&gt;

As noted, Tariácuri explained to his nephews how they will attack the town of Hiuacha (Tariaran), and how Hiripan will become king of Cuyacan, Tangaxoan of Mechuacan (Tzintzuntzan) and his son Hiquingaje in Pátzcuaro. By then Hiripan, Tangaxoan and Hiquingaje had been living for some time in Tzintzuntzan. Hiripan spied on his enemies from the Tariacaherio hill, north of Ihuatzio, and there Curicaueri&lt;ref&gt;Curicaueri (purépecha language: great fire or large bonfire), is the name of the God of fire in Purépecha or Tarascan culture, which was established in the current Mexican State of Michoacán during the postclassical period Mesoamerican.&lt;/ref&gt; appeared before him on a dream and warned him that he will be king. When the [[Chichimeca]]  attacked the Pacandan Isle&lt;ref&gt;Pacanda comes from the purépecha and means "to push something in the water", has a privileged location in the central part of Lake Pátzcuaro, its inhabitants are native peoples which preserved customs and ancient traditions. [http://patzcuaro.pagesperso-orange.fr/mx/07/mx/07jais08.htm La Pacanda]{{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; people to obtain the first captives to be sacrificed in the Querétaro temple, Tariácuri orders his nephews to go to harata Hiuazi and Yuazi xanchacuyo from where they will attack the islanders, while working in farming lands near the shore of the lake (in a place called Araueni). It is possible that both sites were in or near what later would be Ihuatzio.&lt;ref name= Claudia    /&gt;

When Tariácuri dies, Hiripan follows his uncle orders, three kingdoms are formed and he constructed a house in Cuyacan. Later, when they begin to organize the territory that has been conquered, they decide to construct in Cuyacan a house for the God Curicaueri and to keep treasures obtained in the conquests there. From then on Cuyacan becomes the head of the kingdom. Hiripan was buried in Cuyacan and his son Ticatame succeeded him. During his reign, the head of the kingdom was transferred to Tzintzuntzan to where Zizispandaquare (son of Tangaxoan) moved Curicaueri together with the treasure.&lt;ref name= Claudia   /&gt;

In spite of having lost their position, Cuyacan continued being an important site. When they went to war, the Cuyacan lord was the one who harangued the soldiers and when they chose a new ''[[cazonci]]'',&lt;ref&gt;'''Cazonci''' or '''caltzontzin''' or '''irecha''', is the term used in the Purépecha or Tarascan culture, for their rulers. The Cazonci exerted maximum economic, legal and religious authority, its position was privileged because it was regarded as representative of the gods. The cazonci regularly inherited his position to his descendants in direct line, or very close relatives.&lt;/ref&gt; he was one of the members of the group that met to discuss who would be the next king. In fact, Zinzicha considered Paquingata, lord of Cuyacan as a possible Cazonci, but he refused. Paquingata was grandson of Ticatame and son of Tucuruan.&lt;ref name=Claudia   &gt;{{cite web |first=Claudia  |last=  Espejel Carbajal |title=  Ihuatzio,   en la orilla oriental del lago de Pátzcuaro.|url=http://etzakutarakua.colmich.edu.mx/proyectos/relaciondemichoacan/indices/completoLugares.asp?letra=I&amp;pagina=1&amp;id=169&amp;tabla=lugar|publisher= El Colegio de Michoacán, A.

==The site==
Architecturally speaking, Ihuatzio is one of the most extensive and complex sites of the State of Michoacán. The archaeological remains are distributed in an approximate area of 50 hectares.&lt;ref name= Espe    /&gt;

Unfortunately, as in most Mexican archaeological sites, not every area of monuments has been explored and therefore are only partially open to the public; the only sector that can be visited is known as "Plaza de Armas", where rectangular base pyramidal structures are located, placed on an also rectangular platform.&lt;ref name= Espe    /&gt;

The prehispanic settlement fully covers a low-lying plateau and keeps a strategic location at the extreme west of the Lake and other dominant sites as Tzintzuntzan. It is possible that Ihuatzio controlled this portion of the basin.&lt;ref name= Espe   /&gt;

This site contains the best preserved monuments of the Michoacán Kingdom civilization depicting its greatness: a pyramid which served the natives as the main square; remains of a tower or fortress that was built (according to an ancient tradition) by the founder of the city in prehispanic times; some yácatas or kings tombs which have, where idols, decorations, weapons and vessels were uncovered; a well-constructed street or road, called Querendaro that served to communicate with Tzintzuntzan to the north.&lt;ref name=Acambeo  &gt;{{cite web |first=  |last=  |title=  Ihuatzio, Zona Lacustre|url=http://patzcuaro.pagesperso-orange.fr/mx/07/mx/07jaal59.htm |publisher= Acambeo|location=Morelia, Michoacán  |language= Spanish |trans-title=Ihuatzio, lacustrine area |accessdate= Sep 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structures===
The characteristic features of the Ihuatzio archaeological site are defensive-walls and walled roads. The first constitute a communication system between the main groups of constructions and access points to the site at prehispanic times. The second element, the roads, constitutes an interior road system, only that their functions could be diverse, as serving as a defense wall and limiting accesses to the site as well as internal communication.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

====Plaza de Armas====
The '''Plaza de Armas''' is a huge rectangular, graded area bordered on the north and south ends by structures called wall-causeways which were used as roads. Ceremonial activities, rituals, and festivities were celebrated in the different parts of this square. Yet there is the possibility that some economic activities, such as marketing and exchange of goods, were also carried out here. It is even believed that it was sometimes used as a ball court playing field, as well.

The area open to the public, consists of a large quadrangular space bordered by two elements called "uatziris" (or Huatziris) by local people. These elements are wide staggered walls in both sides; access to the top side was by an embedded stairway. At the western end of the plaza a rectangular 1.5 meter high platform was placed on which two plinths were constructed, these are described next.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

====Yácatas====
Three Yácatas are located on a large plaza, south of the "Plaza de Armas", which is not yet open to the public. These buildings, whose foundation combines a rectangle with a semicircle, are characteristic of some purépecha sites of the 15th and 16th centuries. It had a stairway embedded in the center of the rectangular body. These three yácatas face west, on the semicircular part of their bodies, precisely in front of one of the mentioned wall-roads and constitute the communication system between the main building groups and the access points to the site at prehispanic times.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

The Yácatas&lt;ref name=Yacata /&gt; walls are built with horizontally set slabs which cover a rock and earth core. The outer coating consisted of Janamus blocks&lt;ref name=Xanamu &gt;Janamu or Xanamu are red volcanic rock blocks, in Purépecha or tarascan language Xanamu means rough stone&lt;/ref&gt; which once fully covered the structures but have since weathered completely. Some vestiges can be seen on the east face of rectangular structure no. 1.

====Huatziri====
The Huatziris or walled causeway (Muro-Calzada), is a most infrequent element in western Mexico's archaeology. It consists of a structure built with a system similar to that used in the rectangular buildings, namely, a rock and earth core covered by stone slabs. It displays a stuccoed-upper part, stepped tiers, and an average height of seven feet. It surrounds a large part of the settlement and had the dual function of road and entrance control.

The top of the wall was also finished and has staggered bodies, but it is smaller than the "Calzada del Rey" walls, described below, it measures 2.5 meters high average; this wall surrounds a large part of the settlement and had a double function, it served for roadway and also as a defensive element.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

====Platform====
It is of rectangular base, constructed with a dirt and stone nucleus, covered with stone slabs without cement. Finishing was with stone xanamu&lt;ref name=Xanamu /&gt; carved blocks, of which only some samples are left. It measures 87 meters long; 37.5 wide and 1.5 high. The following structures were built on top.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

====Pyramidal Foundations====
These are two structures laid out east-west with stairways facing east. The construction consisted of a basalt stone nucleus, covered with stone slabs staggered walls, making up 11 bodies, finishing also consisted of Xanamu&lt;ref name=Xanamu /&gt; slabs. There are only remains of the stairways. Between these two structures there is a 1.65 meters wide passageway, where excavations unearthed human skeletons and the Chac-Mool sculpture.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

====Calzada del Rey====
The "King Road" is a characteristic feature of this site, unique in prehispanic architecture not only of Michoacán but also of Western Mexico, are enormous constructions of approximately 250 meters long by 20 wide and more than 5 meters high, which are conformed by several overlaid bodies and located in the west and south sectors of the site. There is a flattened dirt floor on top, and are delimited by two small protective walls for pedestrian use. From their shape and displayed distribution in the landscape and because of the spaces that are communicated, it is assumed that they served as walkways used to transport the "Cazonzi" (purépecha or tarascan name for the king) from the ceremonial center to different points of the site.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

====Mirador====
The south sector has another unique element, it consists of a circular base construction, cylinder shaped. This building, exclusive of the Ihuatzio archaeological site, does not display a well-defined access point and its precise function is not known. Nevertheless, given its strategic location, it is supposed it served as a cosmos observatory or viewpoint. The only certain fact is that there are no other similar structures in all of Michoacán, or registered sites in Guanajuato and Jalisco states.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

The '''Joukowsky Institute for Archaeology and the Ancient World''' is an interdisciplinary center for research and teaching of [[archaeology]], particularly archaeology and art of the ancient Mediterranean, Egypt, and the Near East, at [[Brown University]].

==History==
The Joukowsky Institute was established in 2004, with a gift from Artemis Joukowsky, a former Chancellor of Brown University&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.lib.brown.edu/portraits/display.php?idno=230 Brown Portrait Collection biography of Artemis A.W. Joukowsky]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Martha Sharp Joukowsky]], a former associate professor of Anthropology at Brown. A new director, [[Susan E. Alcock]], took up her appointment in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.browndailyherald.com/campus-news/alcock-to-oversee-expansion-of-interdisciplinary-archaeology-institute-1.1678566 Alcock to oversee expansion of interdisciplinary archaeology institute], by Sara Walter, ''Brown Daily Herald'', February 9, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Peter van Dommelen succeeded Alcock, becoming Director of the Institute in July 2015.

The Institute has continued and expanded the activities of Brown’s former Center for Old World Archaeology and Art (COWAA). COWAA was founded in 1978 by R. Ross Holloway, professor of classics, Rudolf Winkes, historian of ancient Roman art, and Martha Sharp Joukowsky.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=C0240 COWAA]" in ''[[Encyclopedia Brunoniana]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Joukowsky Institute moved to the newly renovated Rhode Island Hall,&lt;ref&gt;Rhode Island Hall earned Brown its first gold certification from the U.S. Green Building Council’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program. [http://today.brown.edu/articles/2010/09/leed Today at Brown]&lt;/ref&gt; located on Brown University's Main Green, in September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070827194852/http://www.brown.edu/Facilities/Building_Brown/projects/rihall/ Building Brown]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core Faculty==

A '''jukebox musical''' is a [[musical film]] or [[Musical theatre|stage presentation]] featuring the songs of [[popular music]] acts.  The term is used to describe films starring famous [[popular music]] acts showcasing their own recorded songs, not necessarily as part of a traditional [[Theatre music|musical score]], though they are sometimes augmented with scored background music.  Use of the term has also grown to encompass musical films and theatrical presentations that celebrate past or present music acts or personalities, usually played by professional actors singing new renditions of the real artists' previously-recorded songs and other material, done in a manner more akin to a typical [[Broadway theatre|Broadway musical]], where songs are incorporated into a formal musical score and accompanied by [[choreography]].  The songs in jukebox musicals (of both kinds) are often contextualized into a [[drama]]tic [[Plot (narrative)|plot]], and particularly in the case of the later kind, a [[Biography|biographical]] story about the featured performer(s).  In some instances plots do not revolve around the musical act(s) making appearances.

Jukebox musical films of the first kind often feature famous [[Pop music|pop]] stars and [[Rock music|rock]] [[Musical ensembles|groups]] playing themselves, such as [[the Beatles]] in their narrative films, or in other cases playing as [[alter egos]].  Some films star one well-known act, but others include a [[Revue|variety of acts]].  Some jukebox musicals include previously recorded songs, but others introduce unreleased material, such the Beatles' did in their first film, ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'', which [[Andrew Sarris]] described as "the ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' of jukebox musicals", as well as in their second and third features, ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'' and ''[[Magical Mystery Tour (film)|Magical Mystery Tour]]'' (their fourth film, the [[Animation|animated]] ''[[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]]'', featured mostly previously released songs). Prior to the Beatles, [[Elvis Presley]]'s movies sometimes contained previously unreleased music.  In the 1980s, [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]'s ''[[Purple Rain (film)|Purple Rain]]'', in which he played a fictional character called the Kid, also featured new songs.

Other films described as jukebox musicals take all their songs from a single [[concept album]] featuring an integrated song cycle with a story arc, sometimes labeled a [[rock opera]]. Both the movies of [[The Who]]'s ''[[Tommy (1975 film)|Tommy]]'' and of [[Pink Floyd]]'s ''[[Pink Floyd – The Wall|The Wall]]'' adapted the entire song cycle of a single album which already revolved around a fictional character.

Although jukebox musicals had achieved success for years (for instance ''[[Buddy – The Buddy Holly Story]]'', the musical about the life of [[Buddy Holly]] which ran in the [[West End theatre|West End]] for 13 years from 1989 to 2003), a surge in popularity was led by the success of ''[[Mamma Mia!]]'', built around the music of [[ABBA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mamma Mia! and the Rise of the Jukebox Musical|url=http://www.cheaptheatretickets.com/mamma-mia-jukebox-musical/|publisher=Cheap Theater Tickets|accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reception of jukebox musicals has been divided, with the most common criticism being that there is too much focus on how many songs can be fit into the musical. Some jukebox musicals, like ''[[Lennon (musical)|Lennon]]'' and ''[[Good Vibrations (musical)|Good Vibrations]]'' have been critical and financial flops. Others, like ''[[Jersey Boys]]'' and ''[[All Shook Up (musical)|All Shook Up]]'' have been popular with both fans and critics.

The term "jukebox musical" dates at least to 1962,&lt;ref&gt;''Guide to the Performing Arts: 3460'', Scarecrow Press, Inc., 1962, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=4b_EAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%2B%22jukebox+musical%22 204], "—[[Garson Kanin|Kanin, Garson]]; his jukebox musical with [[Phil Silvers]], [[Nancy Walker]]".&lt;/ref&gt; following ''Jukebox'' (1939), though the general genre—motion pictures consisting largely of hit recordings—dates to the 1940s and 1950s.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} Examples are ''Jam Session'', ''[[An American in Paris (film)|An American in Paris]]'' (1951), ''[[Rock, Rock, Rock (film)|Rock, Rock, Rock]]'' (1956); ''[[Rock Around the Clock (film)|Rock Around the Clock]]'' (1956) and ''Juke Box Rhythm'' (1959).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11819">A '''law  degree''' is an academic degree conferred for studies in [[law]]. Such degrees are generally preparation for legal careers; but while their curricula may be reviewed by legal authority, they do not themselves confer a license. A legal license is granted (typically by examination) and exercised locally; while the law degree can have local, international, and world-wide aspects- e.g., in Britain the [[Legal Practice Course]] is required to become a British [[solicitor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/becomingasolicitor.law|title=Becoming a Solicitor|publisher=The Law Society (UK)|accessdate=2009-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sra.org.uk/students/students.page|title=Solicitor's Regulation Authority Student and Training information|publisher=Solicitor's Regulation Authority|accessdate=2009-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Bar Professional Training Course]] (BPTC) to become a [[barrister]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barcouncil.org.uk/trainingandeducation/howtobecomeabarrister/ |title=How to Become a Barrister |publisher=The Bar Council (UK) |accessdate=2009-01-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218134750/http://www.barcouncil.org.uk/trainingandeducation/howtobecomeabarrister/ |archivedate=December 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first academic degrees were all law degrees-and the first law degrees were [[doctorate]]s. The foundations of the first universities in Europe were the [[glossators]] of the 11th century, which were schools of law.&lt;ref&gt;Herbermann, et al. (1915). [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05072b.htm Catholic Encyclopedia]. New York: Encyclopedia Press. Accessed May 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The first European university, that of [[University of Bologna|Bologna]], was founded as a school of law by four famous legal scholars in the 12th century who were students of the [[glossator]] school in that city. It is from this history that it is said that the first academic title of doctor applied to scholars of law. The degree and title were not applied to scholars of other disciplines until the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;Herbermann (1915).&lt;/ref&gt; And at the [[University of Bologna]] from its founding in the 12th century until the end of the 20th century the only degree conferred was the doctorate, usually earned after five years of intensive study after secondary school. The rising of the doctor of philosophy to its present level is a modern novelty.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, A. (1921). "Training for the Public Profession of the Law, Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, Bulletin 15." Boston: Merrymount Press.&lt;/ref&gt; At its origins, a doctorate was simply a qualification for a [[guild]]—that of teaching law.&lt;ref&gt;van Ditzhuyzen, R. (2005). [http://ugle.svf.uib.no/svfweb1/filer/1309.pdf The 'creatio doctoris': Diversity or convergence of ceremonial forms]? Unknown publisher. Accessed May 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Bologna]] served as the model for other law schools of the [[medieval]] age.&lt;ref&gt;García y García, A. (1992). [https://books.google.com/books?id=5Z1VBEbF0HAC&amp;pg=RA1-PA399&amp;lpg=RA1-PA399&amp;dq=bologna+doctor+title&amp;source=web&amp;ots=ov98N_ekq2&amp;sig=nAvm4JUEZJg389NCdSNfX1Gc-7s&amp;hl=en#PPP1,M1 "The Faculties of Law,"] [[A History of the University in Europe]], London: Cambridge University Press. Accessed May 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; While it was common for students of law to visit and study at schools in other countries, such was not the case with England because of the English rejection of [[Roman law]] (except for certain jurisdictions such as the Admiralty Court) and although the [[University of Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge]] did teach [[canon law]] until the [[English Reformation]], its importance was always superior to [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] in those institutions.&lt;ref&gt;García y García (1992), 390.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the medieval Islamic [[madrasah]]s, there was a doctorate in the Islamic law of the [[Sharia]], called the ''[[Ijazah|ijazat attadris wa 'l-ifta']]'' ("license to teach and issue legal opinions").&lt;ref&gt;Makdisi, G. (1989). "Scholasticism and Humanism in Classical Islam and the Christian West," Journal of the American Oriental Society 109, 2, pp. 175–182.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of degrees==
The type of law degree conferred differs according to the jurisdiction.  Some examples include;

* ''[[Bacharel em Direito]]'' (Bachelor of Laws) or ''[[Bacharel em Ciências Jurídicas e Sociais]]'' (Bachelor of Laws and Social Sciences), in [[Brazil]], is an undergraduate degree.

Langbein, “Scholarly and Professional Objectives in Legal Education: American Trends and English Comparisons,” Pressing Problems in the Law, Volume 2: What are Law Schools For?, Oxford University Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Bachelor of Civil Law]] (B.C.L.) degree is similar in nature, historically distinguished from [[canon law]].
* [[Master of Laws]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and various current or former [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries. Also referred to as an LL.M. from its Latin name, Legum Magister.

'''Marin Sorescu''' ({{IPA-ro|maˈrin soˈresku|-|Ro-Marin Sorescu.ogg}}; 29 February 1936 – 8 December 1996) was a Romanian poet, playwright, and novelist.

His works were translated into more than 20 countries, and the total number of his books that were published abroad rises up to 60 books. He has also been known for his painting, and he opened many art exhibits in Romania and abroad. He occupied the position of Minister of Culture within the Nicolae Văcăroiu Cabinet, without being a member of any political party, after the Romanian revolution of 1989 (from 25 November 1993 to 5 May 1995).

== Biography ==
Born to a family of farmworkers in [[Bulzești]], [[Dolj County]], Sorescu graduated from the primary school in his home village. After that he went to the [[Frații Buzești High School|Buzesti Brothers High School]] in Craiova, after which he was transferred to the Predeal Military School. His final education was at the [[University of Iaşi]], where, in 1960, he graduated with a degree in modern languages. His first book, a collection of parodies in 1964 entitled ''Singur printre poeţi'' ("Alone Among  Poets"), was widely discussed. He himself called them "sarcastic and awkward". Ten volumes of poetry and prose followed, having a very rapid ascension in the world of literary, as a poet, novelist, playwright, essayist. He grew so popular that his readings were held in [[Football (soccer)|football]] stadiums. In 1971, he was a resident of the [[International Writing Program]] at the [[University of Iowa]].

On his poetry, Sorescu said, with characteristic irony: "Just as I can't give up smoking because I don't smoke, I can't give up writing because I have no talent." He often claimed a sense of alienation, saying "the spoken word is a crossed frontier. By the act of saying something, I fail to say many other things." On censorship, he said, after his last, post-[[Romanian Revolution of 1989|1989 Revolution]] volumes were delayed, "we have won our freedom, so I mustn't complain. O [[Censorship|censors]], where are you now?"

Sorescu's collection of ''Censored Poems'' comprised poems could not be published until the end of the [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]] [[Communist Romania|Communist]] dictatorship; of these, the best known is ''House under surveillance''.

''Iona'', the play written by Marin Sorescu and first published in 1968 is a true masterpiece. The biblical myth says the prophet ''Iona'' was swollen by a whale.&lt;ref&gt;http://paginiortodoxe.tripod.com/vssep/09-22-sf_prooroc_iona.html&lt;/ref&gt; In his play, Sorescu takes the story further and imagines what happens to ''Iona'' while he was inside the whale. "The most terrible part of the play is when Iona loses his echo", writes  Sorescu in the foreword of this play. "Iona was alone, but his echo was whole. He shouted: Io-na, and his echo answered: Io-na. Then, it remained just half of the echo. He shouted Io-na, but all he could hear was Io. Io, in some ancient language, means ''me''".&lt;ref&gt;http://ctt.ro/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Marin-Sorescu-Iona.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; ''Iona'' was played to a full house in Bucharest in 1969, but the tragedy was quickly withdrawn, because its content was considered too controversial.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/marin-sorescu&lt;/ref&gt;

Ill with [[cirrhosis]] and [[hepatitis]], he died from a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at the [[Elias Hospital]] in [[Bucharest]], aged 60.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29464">In [[geodesy]], a '''meridian arc''' measurement is the distance between two points with the same [[longitude]], i.e., a [[arc (geometry)|segment]] of a [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] [[curve (geometry)|curve]] or its length. Two or more such determinations at different locations then specify the shape of the [[reference ellipsoid]] which best approximates the shape of the [[geoid]]. This process is called the determination of the [[figure of the Earth]]. The earliest determinations of the size of a [[spherical Earth]] required a single arc. The latest determinations use [[geodetic astronomy|astro-geodetic]] measurements and the methods of [[satellite geodesy]] to determine the reference ellipsoids.

Those interested in accurate expressions of the meridian arc for the [[WGS84]] ellipsoid should consult the subsection entitled [[#Numerical expressions|numerical expressions]].

==The Earth as a sphere==
{{main|Earth radius}}

Early estimations of Earth's size are recorded from Greece in the 4th century BC, and from scholars at the [[caliph]]'s [[House of Wisdom]] in the 9th century. The first realistic value was calculated by [[Alexandria]]n scientist [[Eratosthenes]] about 240 BC. He knew that on the [[summer solstice]] at local noon the [[sun]] goes through the [[zenith]] in the ancient Egyptian city of [[Syene]] (Assuan). He also knew from his own measurements that, at the same moment in his hometown of [[Alexandria]], the [[zenith distance]] was {{sfrac|1|50}} of a full circle (7.2°).

Assuming that Alexandria was due north of Syene, Eratosthenes concluded that the distance between Alexandria and Syene must be {{sfrac|1|50}} of Earth's circumference. Using data from [[caravan (travellers)|caravan]] travels, he estimated the distance to be 5,000 [[stadion (unit of length)|stadia]] (about 500 [[nautical miles]])—which implies a circumference of 252,000 stadia. Assuming the [[Ancient Greek units of measurement#Length|Attic stadion]] (185&amp;nbsp;m) this corresponds to 46,620&amp;nbsp;km, or 16% too great. However, if Eratosthenes used the Egyptian stadion (157.5&amp;nbsp;m) his measurement turns out to be 39,690&amp;nbsp;km, an error of only 1%. Syene is not precisely on the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and not directly south of Alexandria. The sun appears as a disk of 0.5°, and an estimate of the overland distance traveling along the [[Nile]] or through the desert couldn't be more accurate than about 10%.

Eratosthenes' estimation of Earth's size was accepted for nearly two thousand years. A similar method was used by [[Posidonius]] about 150 years later, and slightly better results were calculated in 827 by the [[grade measurement]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} of the Caliph [[Al-Ma'mun]].

==The Earth as an ellipsoid==
{{main|Earth ellipsoid}}

Early literature uses the term ''oblate spheroid'' to describe a [[sphere]] "squashed at the poles". Modern literature uses the term ''ellipsoid of revolution'' in place of [[spheroid]], although the qualifying words "of revolution" are usually dropped. An [[ellipsoid]] that is not an ellipsoid of revolution is called a triaxial ellipsoid. ''Spheroid'' and ''ellipsoid'' are used interchangeably in this article, with oblate implied if not stated.

===17th and 18th centuries===
Although it had been known since [[classical antiquity]] that the Earth was [[Spherical Earth|spherical]], by the 17th century, evidence was accumulating that it was not a perfect sphere. In 1672, [[Jean Richer]] found the first evidence that [[gravity]] was not constant over the Earth (as it would be if the Earth were a sphere); he took a [[pendulum clock]] to [[Cayenne]], [[French Guiana]] and found that it lost {{frac|2|1|2}} minutes per day compared to its rate at [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Pendulum gravimeters began to be taken on voyages to remote parts of the world, and it was slowly discovered that gravity increases smoothly with increasing [[latitude]], [[gravitational acceleration]] being about 0.5% greater at the [[geographical pole]]s than at the [[Equator]].

In 1687, Newton had published in the ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'' as a proof that the Earth was an oblate [[spheroid]] of [[flattening]] equal to {{sfrac|1|230}}.&lt;ref name=Newton&gt;Isaac Newton: [https://books.google.com/books?id=KaAIAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA405 ''Principia'', Book III, Proposition XIX, Problem III], translated into English by Andrew Motte.

A meridian arc of [[Jean Picard]] was extended to a longer arc by [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini]] and his son [[Jacques Cassini]]  over the period 1684–1718.&lt;ref name=clarke&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arc was measured with at least three latitude determinations, so they were able to deduce mean curvatures for the northern and southern halves of the arc, allowing a determination of the overall shape. The results indicated that the Earth was a ''prolate'' spheroid (with an equatorial radius less than the polar radius). To resolve the issue, the [[French Academy of Sciences]] (1735) proposed expeditions to Peru ([[Pierre Bouguer|Bouguer]], [[Louis Godin]], [[Charles Marie de La Condamine|de La Condamine]], [[Antonio de Ulloa]], [[Jorge Juan y Santacilia|Jorge Juan]]) and Lapland ([[Pierre Louis Maupertuis|Maupertuis]], [[Alexis Clairaut|Clairaut]], [[Charles Étienne Louis Camus|Camus]], [[Pierre Charles Le Monnier|Le Monnier]], Abbe Outhier, [[Anders Celsius|Celsius]]). The expedition to Peru is described in the [[French Geodesic Mission]] article and that to Lapland is described in the [[Torne Valley]] article. The resulting measurements at equatorial and polar latitudes confirmed that the Earth was best modelled by an oblate spheroid, supporting Newton.&lt;ref name=clarke/&gt; By 1743, [[Clairaut's theorem]] however had completely supplanted Newton's approach.

By the end of the century, [[Delambre]] had remeasured and extended the French arc from [[Dunkirk]] to the [[Mediterranean]]. It was divided into five parts by four intermediate determinations of latitude. By combining the measurements together with those for the arc of Peru,
ellipsoid shape parameters were determined and the distance between the Equator and pole along the [[Paris Meridian]] was calculated as {{val|5130762}}&amp;nbsp;[[toise]]s as specified by the standard toise bar in Paris. Defining this distance as exactly {{val|10000000|u=m}} led to the construction of a new standard [[metre]] bar as {{val|0.5130762}}&amp;nbsp;toises.&lt;ref name=clarke/&gt;{{rp|22}}

===19th century===
In the 19th century, many astronomers and geodesists were engaged in detailed studies of the Earth's curvature along different meridian arcs. The analyses resulted in a great many model ellipsoids such as Plessis 1817, Airy 1830, [[Bessel ellipsoid|Bessel 1830]], Everest 1830, and [[Alexander Ross Clarke|Clarke 1866]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A comprehensive list of ellipsoids is given under [[Earth ellipsoid#Historical Earth ellipsoids|Earth ellipsoid]].

==Meridian distance on the ellipsoid==

The determination of the meridian distance, that is the distance from the equator to a point at a latitude {{mvar|φ}} on the ellipsoid is an important problem in the theory of map projections, particularly the [[Transverse Mercator projection]]. Ellipsoids are normally specified in terms of the parameters defined above, {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, {{mvar|f}}, but in theoretical work it is useful to define extra parameters, particularly the [[Eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]], {{mvar|e}}, and the third [[flattening]] {{mvar|n}}. Only two of these parameters are independent and there are many relations between them:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 f&amp;=\frac{a-b}{a}\,, \qquad  e^2=f(2-f)\,, \qquad n=\frac{a-b}{a+b}=\frac{f}{2-f}\,,\\
b&amp;=a(1-f)=a\sqrt{1-e^2}\,,\qquad  e^2=\frac{4n}{(1+n)^2}\,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!--'''Comment''': notation is problematic in this area. One must distinguish between the meridian radius of curvature and the meridian distance. The notation {{math|''M''(''φ'')}} has been used for both. The definitions adopted here are:
*{{math|''M''(''φ'')}} is the meridian radius of curvature.
*{{math|''m''(''φ'')}} is the meridian distance.--&gt;

The [[Earth radius#Meridional|meridian radius of curvature]] can be shown&lt;ref&gt;Rapp, R, (1991): [http://hdl.handle.net/1811/24333 Geometric Geodesy, Part I], &amp;sect;3.5.1, pp. 28–32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=osborne&gt;{{citation|first=Peter

:&lt;math&gt; M(\varphi) = \frac{a(1 - e^2)}{\left(1 - e^2 \sin^2 \varphi \right)^\frac32},&lt;/math&gt;
so that the arc length of an infinitesimal element of the meridian is {{math|''dm'' {{=}} ''M''(''φ'') ''dφ''}} (with {{mvar|φ}} in radians). Therefore, the meridian distance from the equator to latitude {{mvar|φ}} is
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
m(\varphi) &amp;=\int_0^\varphi M(\varphi) \, d\varphi \\
&amp;= a(1 - e^2)\int_0^\varphi \left(1 - e^2 \sin^2 \varphi \right)^{-\frac32} \, d\varphi\,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
The distance formula is simpler when written in terms of the
[[Latitude#Reduced (or parametric) latitude|parametric latitude]],
:&lt;math&gt;m(\varphi) = b\int_0^\beta\sqrt{1 + e'^2\sin^2\beta}\,d\beta\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|tan ''β'' {{=}} (1 − ''f'')tan ''φ''}} and {{math|''e''′&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} {{sfrac|''e''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|1 − ''e''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}}}.

The distance from the equator to the pole, the quarter meridian, is
:&lt;math&gt;m_\mathrm{p} = m\left(\frac \pi 2\right)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Even though latitude is normally confined to the range {{math|[−{{sfrac|π|2}},{{sfrac|π|2}}]}}, all the formulae given here apply to measuring distance around the complete meridian ellipse (including the anti-meridian). Thus the ranges of {{mvar|φ}}, {{mvar|β}}, and the rectifying latitude {{mvar|μ}}, are unrestricted.

===Relation to elliptic integrals===

The above integral is related to a special case of an [[Elliptic integral#Incomplete elliptic integral of the third kind|incomplete elliptic integral of the third kind]]. In the notation of the online NIST handbook&lt;ref&gt;F. W. J. Olver, D. W. Lozier, R. F. Boisvert, and C. W. Clark, editors,
2010, [http://dlmf.nist.gov NIST Handbook of Mathematical Functions] (Cambridge
University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; ([http://dlmf.nist.gov/19.2#ii Section 19.2(ii)]),
:&lt;math&gt;m(\varphi)=a\left(1-e^2\right)\,\Pi(\varphi,e^2,e)\,.&lt;/math&gt;
It may also be written in terms of [[Elliptic integral#Incomplete elliptic integral of the second kind|incomplete elliptic integrals of the second kind]] (See the NIST handbook [http://dlmf.nist.gov/19.6#iv Section 19.6(iv)]),
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
m(\varphi) &amp;= a\left(E(\varphi,e)-\frac{e^2\sin\varphi\cos\varphi}{\sqrt{1-e^2\sin^2\varphi}}\right) \\
&amp;= a\left(E(\varphi,e)+\frac{d^2}{d\varphi^2}E(\varphi,e)\right) \\
&amp;= b E(\beta, ie')\,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
The quarter meridian can be expressed in terms of the [[Elliptic integral#Complete elliptic integral of the second kind|complete elliptic integral of the second kind]],
:&lt;math&gt;m_\mathrm{p}=aE(e)=bE(ie').&lt;/math&gt;
The calculation (to arbitrary precision) of the elliptic integrals and approximations are also discussed in the NIST handbook. These functions are also implemented in computer algebra programs such as Mathematica&lt;ref&gt;[http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/guide/EllipticIntegrals.html Mathematica guide: Elliptic Integrals]&lt;/ref&gt; and Maxima.&lt;ref&gt;[http://maxima.sf.net Maxima], 2009, A computer algebra system, version 5.20.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Series expansions===

The above integral may be expressed as an infinite truncated series by expanding the integrand in a Taylor series, performing the resulting integrals term by term, and expressing the result as a trigonometric series. In 1755, [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|ref = harv |year = 1755

}}&lt;/ref&gt; derived an expansion in the [[Eccentricity (mathematics)#Ellipses|third eccentricity]] squared.

====Expansions in the eccentricity ({{mvar|e}})====
[[Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre|Delambre]] in 1799&lt;ref name=delambre&gt;Delambre, J. B. J. (1799): [https://books.google.com/books?id=DBAOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA72 ''Méthodes Analytiques pour la Détermination d'un Arc du Méridien''; précédées d'un mémoire sur le même sujet par A. M. Legendre], De L'Imprimerie de Crapelet, Paris, 72–73&lt;/ref&gt; derived a widely used expansion on {{math|''e''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}},

:&lt;math&gt;m(\varphi)=\frac{b^2}a\left(D_0\varphi+D_2\sin 2\varphi+D_4\sin4\varphi+D_6\sin6\varphi+D_8\sin8\varphi+\cdots\right)\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
D_0 &amp;= 1 + \tfrac{3}{4} e^2 + \tfrac{45}{64} e^4 + \tfrac{175}{256} e^6 + \tfrac{11025}{16384} e^8 + \cdots, \\
D_2 &amp;= - \tfrac{3}{8} e^2 - \tfrac{15}{32} e^4 - \tfrac{525}{1024} e^6 - \tfrac{2205}{4096} e^8 - \cdots, \\
D_4 &amp;= \tfrac{15}{256} e^4 + \tfrac{105}{1024} e^6 + \tfrac{2205}{16384} e^8 + \cdots, \\
D_6 &amp;= - \tfrac{35}{3072} e^6 - \tfrac{105}{4096} e^8 - \cdots, \\
D_8 &amp;= \tfrac{315}{131072} e^8 + \cdots.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Rapp&lt;ref&gt;Rapp, R, (1991), §3.6, pp. 36–40.&lt;/ref&gt; gives a detailed derivation of this result.  In this article, trigonometric terms of the form {{math|sin 4''φ''}} are interpreted as {{math|sin(4''φ'')}}.

====Expansions in the third flattening ({{mvar|n}})====

Series with considerably faster convergence can be obtained by expanding in terms of the [[Flattening#First, second and third flattening|third flattening]] {{mvar|n}} instead of the eccentricity. They are related by
:&lt;math&gt;e^2 = \frac{4n}{(1+n)^2}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

In 1837, [[Friedrich Bessel|Bessel]] obtained one such series,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | ref = harv| last = Bessel | first = F.

:&lt;math&gt;m(\varphi)=\frac{a+b}2\left(H_0\varphi+H_2\sin 2\varphi+H_4\sin4\varphi+H_6\sin6\varphi+H_8\sin8\varphi+\cdots\right)\,,&lt;/math&gt;
with
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
H_0 &amp;= 1 + \tfrac{1}{4} n^2 + \tfrac{1}{64} n^4 + \cdots, \\
H_2 &amp;= - \tfrac{3}{2} n + \tfrac{3}{16} n^3 + \cdots,&amp;
H_6 &amp;= - \tfrac{35}{48} n^3 + \cdots, \\
H_4 &amp;= \tfrac{15}{16} n^2 - \tfrac{15}{64} n^4 - \cdots,\qquad&amp;
H_8 &amp;= \tfrac{315}{512} n^4 - \cdots.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Because {{mvar|n}} changes sign when {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} are interchanged, and because the initial factor {{math|{{sfrac|1|2}}(''a'' + ''b'')}} is constant under this interchange, half the terms in the expansions of {{math|''H''&lt;sub&gt;2''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} vanish.

The series can be expressed with either {{mvar|a}} or {{mvar|b}} as the initial factor by writing, for example,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac12(a+b) = \frac{a}{1+n} = a(1-n+n^2-n^3+n^4-\cdots)\,,&lt;/math&gt;
and expanding the result as a series in {{mvar|n}}. Even though this results in more slowly converging series, such series are used in the specification for the [[transverse Mercator projection]] by the [[National Geospatial Intelligence Agency]]&lt;ref&gt;J. W. Hager, J.F. Behensky, and B.W. Drew, 1989. Defense Mapping Agency Technical Report TM 8358.2.

====Series in terms of the parametric latitude====

}}&lt;/ref&gt; derived an expansion of the meridian distance in terms of the parametric latitude {{mvar|β}} in connection with his work on [[geodesics on an ellipsoid|geodesics]],

:&lt;math&gt;m(\varphi)=\frac{a+b}2\left(B_0\beta+B_2\sin 2\beta+B_4\sin4\beta+B_6\sin6\beta+B_8\sin8\beta+\cdots\right)\,,&lt;/math&gt;
with
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
B_0 &amp;= 1 + \tfrac{1}{4} n^2 + \tfrac{1}{64} n^4 + \cdots = H_0\,,\\
B_2 &amp;= - \tfrac{1}{2} n + \tfrac{1}{16} n^3 + \cdots, &amp;
B_6 &amp;= - \tfrac{1}{48} n^3 + \cdots, \\
B_4 &amp;= - \tfrac{1}{16} n^2 + \tfrac{1}{64} n^4 + \cdots, \qquad&amp;
B_8 &amp;= - \tfrac{5}{512} n^4 + \cdots.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Because this series provides an expansion for the elliptic integral of the second kind, it can be used to write the arc length in terms of the geographic latitude as

:&lt;math&gt;m(\varphi)=\frac{a+b}2\left(B_0\varphi-B_2\sin2\varphi+B_4\sin4\varphi-B_6\sin6\varphi+B_8\sin8\varphi-\cdots-\frac{2n\sin2\varphi}{\sqrt{1+2n\cos2\varphi+n^2}}\right)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

====Generalized series====

The above series, to eighth order in eccentricity or fourth order in third flattening, provide millimetre accuracy.  With the aid of symbolic algebra systems, they can easily be extended to sixth order in the third flattening which provides full double precision accuracy for terrestrial applications.

Delambre&lt;ref name=delambre/&gt; and Bessel&lt;ref name=bessel25/&gt; both wrote their series in a form that allows them to be  generalized to arbitrary order.  The coefficients in Bessel's series can expressed particularly simply

:&lt;math&gt;B_{2k} =
\begin{cases} c_0\,, &amp; \text{if }k = 0\,, \\[5px]
\dfrac{c_k}{k}\,, &amp; \text{if } k &gt; 0\,,
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;c_k = \sum_{j=0}^\infty \frac{(2j-3)!!\, (2j+2k-3)!!}{(2j)!!\, (2j+2k)!!} n^{k+2j}&lt;/math&gt;

and {{math|''k''!!}} is the [[double factorial]], extended to negative values via the recursion relation: {{nowrap|(−1)!! {{=}} 1}} and {{nowrap|(−3)!! {{=}} −1}}.

The coefficients in Helmert's series can similarly be expressed generally by
:&lt;math&gt;H_{2k} = (-1)^k (1-2k)(1+2k) B_{2k}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

This result was conjected by Helmert&lt;ref&gt;Helmert (1880), §1.11&lt;/ref&gt; and proved by Kawase.&lt;ref&gt;Kawase, K. (2011): [http://www.gsi.go.jp/common/000062452.pdf A General Formula for Calculating Meridian Arc Length and its Application to Coordinate Conversion in the Gauss-Krüger Projection], Bulletin of the [[Geospatial Information Authority of Japan]], '''59''', 1–13&lt;/ref&gt;

The factor {{math|(1 − 2''k'')(1 + 2''k'')}} results in poorer convergence of the series in terms of {{mvar|φ}} compared to the one in {{mvar|β}}.

The quarter meridian is given by
:&lt;math&gt;m_\mathrm{p} = \frac{\pi(a+b)}4 c_0 = \frac{\pi(a+b)}4 \sum_{j=0}^\infty\left(\frac{(2j-3)!!}{(2j)!!}\right)^2 n^{2j}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
a result which was first obtained by Ivory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| ref = harv| author1-link = James Ivory (mathematician)| doi = 10.1017/s0080456800030817| title = A new series for the rectification of the ellipsis| journal = [[Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh]] | volume = 4| issue = 2| pages = 177&amp;ndash;190| year = 1798| last1 = Ivory | first1 = J. |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=FaUaqZZYYPAC&amp;pg=PA177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Numerical expressions====

The trigonometric series given above can be conveniently evaluated using [[Clenshaw algorithm#Geodetic applications|Clenshaw summation]]. This method avoids the calculation of most of the trigonometric functions and allows the series to be summed rapidly and accurately. The technique can also be used to evaluate the difference {{math|''m''(''φ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) − ''m''(''φ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}} while maintaining high relative accuracy.

Substituting the values for the semi-major axis and eccentricity of the [[World Geodetic System|WGS84]] ellipsoid gives
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
m(\varphi)&amp;=\left(111\,132.952\,55\,\varphi^{(\circ)}-16\,038.509\,\sin 2\varphi+16.833\,\sin4\varphi-0.022\,\sin6\varphi+0.000\,03\,\sin8\varphi\right)\mbox{ metres} \\
&amp;= \left(111\,132.952\,55\,\beta^{(\circ)}-5\,346.170\,\sin 2\beta-1.122\,\sin4\beta-0.001\,\sin6\beta-0.5\times10^{-6}\,\sin8\beta\right)\mbox{ metres,}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''φ''&lt;sup&gt;(&lt;/sup&gt;°&lt;sup&gt;)&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} {{sfrac|''φ''|1°}}}} is {{mvar|φ}} expressed in degrees (and similarly for {{math|''β''&lt;sup&gt;(&lt;/sup&gt;°&lt;sup&gt;)&lt;/sup&gt;}}).

For the WGS84 ellipsoid the quarter meridian is
:&lt;math&gt; m_\mathrm{p}= \frac{\pi(a+b)}4 c_0 =10\,001\,965.729\mbox{ m.}&lt;/math&gt;
The perimeter of a meridian ellipse is {{math|4''m''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 2π(''a'' + ''b'')''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Therefore, {{math|{{sfrac|1|2}}(''a'' + ''b'')''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the radius of the circle whose circumference is the same as the perimeter of a meridian ellipse. This defines the [[Earth radius#Rectifying radius|rectifying Earth radius]] as {{val|6367449.146|u=m}}.

On the ellipsoid the exact distance between parallels at {{math|''φ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''φ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} is {{math|''m''(''φ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) − ''m''(''φ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}}. For WGS84 an approximate expression for the distance {{math|Δ''m''}} between the two parallels at &amp;plusmn;0.5° from the circle at latitude {{mvar|φ}} is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta m=(111\,133 - 560\cos 2\varphi)\mbox{ metres.}&lt;/math&gt;

==The inverse meridian problem for the ellipsoid==

In some problems, we need to be able to solve the inverse problem: given {{mvar|m}}, determine {{mvar|φ}}. This may be solved by [[Newton's method]], iterating
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi_{i+1} = \varphi_i - \frac{m(\varphi_i) - m}{M(\varphi_i)}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
until convergence.  A suitable starting guess is given by {{math|''φ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''μ''}} where
:&lt;math&gt;\mu = \frac{\pi}2 \frac m{m_\mathrm{p}}&lt;/math&gt;
is the [[rectifying latitude]].  Note that it there is no need to differentiate the series for {{math|''m''(''φ'')}}, since the formula for the meridian radius of curvature {{math|''M''(''φ'')}} can be used instead.

Alternatively, Helmert's series for the meridian distance can be reverted to give&lt;ref&gt;Helmert (1880), §1.10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=adams1921&gt;Adams, Oscar S (1921).

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = \mu + H'_2\sin2\mu + H'_4\sin4\mu + H'_6\sin6\mu + H'_8\sin8\mu + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
H'_2 &amp;= \tfrac{3}{2} n - \tfrac{27}{32} n^3 + \cdots,&amp;
H'_6 &amp;= \tfrac{151}{96} n^3 + \cdots, \\
H'_4 &amp;= \tfrac{21}{16} n^2 - \tfrac{55}{32} n^4 + \cdots,\qquad&amp;
H'_8 &amp;= \tfrac{1097}{512} n^4 + \cdots.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, Bessel's series for {{mvar|m}} in terms of {{mvar|β}} can be reverted to give&lt;ref&gt;Helmert (1880), §5.6&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \mu + B'_2\sin2\mu + B'_4\sin4\mu + B'_6\sin6\mu + B'_8\sin8\mu + \cdots,&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
B'_2 &amp;= \tfrac{1}{2} n - \tfrac{9}{32} n^3 + \cdots,&amp;
B'_6 &amp;= \tfrac{29}{96} n^3 - \cdots, \\
B'_4 &amp;= \tfrac{5}{16} n^2 - \tfrac{37}{96} n^4 + \cdots,\qquad&amp;
B'_8 &amp;= \tfrac{539}{1536} n^4 - \cdots.

{{Greek myth}}
The '''''Odyssey''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɒ|d|ə|s|i}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Odyssey |title=Odyssey|work=[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-grc-gre|Ὀδύσσεια}} ''Odýsseia'', {{IPA-el|o.dýs.sej.ja|pron}} in [[Attic Greek|Classical Attic]]) is one of two major ancient [[Hellenic civilization|Greek]] [[epic poetry|epic poem]]s attributed to [[Homer]]. It is, in part, a sequel to the ''[[Iliad]]'', the other work ascribed to Homer. The ''Odyssey'' is fundamental to the modern [[Western canon]]; it is the second-oldest extant work of Western literature, while the ''Iliad'' is the oldest. Scholars believe the ''Odyssey'' was composed near the end of the 8th century BC, somewhere in [[Ionia]], the Greek coastal region of [[Anatolia]].&lt;ref name="The Odyssey 2003"&gt;[[D.C.H. Rieu]]'s introduction to ''The Odyssey'' (Penguin, 2003), p. ''xi''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The poem mainly focuses on the Greek hero [[Odysseus]] (known as [[wikt:Ulysses|Ulysses]] in [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] myths), king of [[Ithaca]], and his journey home after the fall of [[Troy]]. It takes Odysseus ten years to reach [[Ithaca]] after the ten-year [[Trojan War]].&lt;ref&gt;The dog Argos dies ''autik' idont' Odusea eeikosto eniauto'' ("seeing Odysseus again in the twentieth year"), [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Hom.+Od.+17.290 ''Odyssey'' 17.327]; cf. also [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Hom.+Od.+2.129 2.174-6], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Hom.+Od.+23.85 23.102], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Hom.+Od.+23.129 23.170].&lt;/ref&gt; In his absence, it is assumed Odysseus has died, and his wife [[Penelope]] and son [[Telemachus]] must deal with a group of unruly suitors, the ''Mnesteres'' (Greek: {{lang|grc|Μνηστῆρες}}) or [[Proci]], who compete for Penelope's hand in marriage.

The ''Odyssey'' continues to be read in the [[Homeric Greek]] and translated into modern languages around the world. Many scholars believe the original poem was composed in an [[oral tradition]] by an ''[[aoidos]]'' (epic poet/singer), perhaps a [[rhapsode]] (professional performer), and was more likely intended to be heard than read.&lt;ref name="The Odyssey 2003"/&gt;  The details of the ancient oral performance and the story's conversion to a written work inspire continual debate among scholars. The ''Odyssey'' was written in a poetic dialect of Greek—a literary amalgam of [[Aeolic Greek]], [[Ionic Greek]], and other [[Ancient Greek dialects]]—and comprises 12,110 lines of [[dactylic hexameter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Homer |authorlink=Homer |translator=Robert Fagles |others=Introduction by Bernard Knox |title=The Odyssey |year=1996 |publisher=Penguin Books |location=United States of America |isbn=978-0-14-026886-7 |page=13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fox |first=Robin Lane |authorlink=Robin Lane Fox |title=The Classical World: An Epic History from Homer to Hadrian |year=2006 |publisher=Basic Books |location=United States of America |isbn=978-0-465-02496-4 |page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- some sources give a different number of lines, but 12,110 is the most often cited --&gt; Among the most noteworthy elements of the text are its [[Nonlinear narrative|non-linear]] plot, and the influence on events of choices made by women and slaves, besides the actions of fighting men. In the [[English language]] as well as many others, the word [[wikt:odyssey|''odyssey'']] has come to refer to an epic voyage.

The ''Odyssey'' has a lost sequel, the ''[[Telegony]]'', which was not written by Homer. It was usually attributed in antiquity to [[Cinaethon of Sparta]]. In one source,{{which|date=October 2016}} the ''Telegony'' was said to have been stolen from [[Musaeus of Athens]] by either Eugamon or [[Eugammon of Cyrene]] (see [[Cyclic poets]]).

==Synopsis==

===Exposition===

[[File:Villa Romana de La Olmeda Mosaicos romanos 001 Ulises.jpg|thumb|A [[mosaic]] depicting [[Odysseus]], from the villa of [[La Olmeda]], [[Pedrosa de la Vega]], Spain, late 4th-5th centuries AD]]

The ''Odyssey'' begins after the end of the ten-year [[Trojan War]] (the subject of the ''[[Iliad]]''), and Odysseus has still not returned home from the war because he angered the god, [[Poseidon]]. Odysseus' son [[Telemachus]] is about 20 years old and is sharing his absent father's house on the island of [[Ithaca]] with his mother [[Penelope]] and a crowd of 108 boisterous young men, "the Suitors", whose aim is to persuade Penelope to marry one of them, all the while reveling in Odysseus' palace and eating up his wealth.

Odysseus' protectress, the goddess [[Athena]], requests to [[Zeus]], king of the [[Odyssean gods|gods]], to finally allow Odysseus to return home when Odysseus' enemy, the god of the sea [[Poseidon]], is absent from [[Mount Olympus]] to accept a sacrifice in [[Ethiopia]]. Then, disguised as a [[Taphians|Taphian]] chieftain named [[Mentes (King of the Taphians)|Mentes]], she visits Telemachus to urge him to search for news of his father. He offers her hospitality; they observe the suitors dining rowdily while the bard [[Phemius]] performs a narrative poem for them. Penelope objects to Phemius' theme, the "Return from Troy",&lt;ref&gt;This theme once existed in the form of another epic, ''[[Nostoi]]'', of which only fragments remain.&lt;/ref&gt; because it reminds her of her missing husband, but Telemachus rebuts her objections, asserting his role as head of the household.

That night Athena, disguised as Telemachus, finds a ship and crew for the true prince. The next morning, Telemachus calls an assembly of citizens of Ithaca to discuss what should be done with the suitors. Telemachus is scoffed by the insolent suitors, particularly by their leaders [[Antinous son of Eupeithes|Antinous]], [[Eurymachus]], and [[Leiocritus]].  Accompanied by Athena (now disguised as [[Mentor (Odyssey)|Mentor]]), he departs for the Greek mainland and the household of [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]], most venerable of the Greek warriors at Troy, who resided in [[Pylos]] after the war.

From there, Telemachus rides overland, accompanied by Nestor's son [[Peisistratus (Odyssey)|Peisistratus]], to [[Sparta]], where he finds [[Menelaus]] and [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], who are now reconciled. While Helen laments the fit of lust brought on by Aphrodite that sent her to Troy with Paris, Menelaus recounts how she betrayed the Greeks by attempting to imitate the voices of the soldiers' wives while they were inside the [[Trojan Horse]]. Telemachus also hears from Helen, who is the first to recognize him, that she pities him because Odysseus was not there for him in his childhood because he went to Troy to fight for her and also about his exploit of stealing the Palladium, or the Luck of Troy, where she was the only one to recognize him. Menelaus, meanwhile, also praises Odysseus as an irreproachable comrade and friend, lamenting the fact that they were not only unable to return together from Troy but that Odysseus is yet to return.

Both Helen and Menelaus also say that they returned to [[Sparta]] after a long voyage by way of [[Egypt]]. There, on the island of [[Lighthouse of Alexandria|Pharos]], Menelaus encountered the old sea-god [[Proteus]], who told him that Odysseus was a captive of the nymph [[Calypso (mythology)|Calypso]]. Incidentally, Telemachus learns the fate of Menelaus' brother [[Agamemnon]], king of [[Mycenae]] and leader of the Greeks at Troy: he was murdered on his return home by his wife [[Clytemnestra]] and her lover [[Aegisthus]]. The story briefly shifts to the suitors, who have only just now realized that Telemachus is gone. Angry, they formulate a plan to ambush his ship and kill him as he sails back home. Penelope overhears their plot and worries for her son's safety.

===Escape to the Phaeacians===

[[File:Odysseus And Nausicaä - Project Gutenberg eText 13725.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|[[Charles Gleyre]], ''[[Odysseus]] and [[Nausicaä]]'']]

The second part recounts the story of Odysseus. In the course of his seven years in captivity on [[Ogygia]], the island of [[Calypso (mythology)|Calypso]], she has fallen deeply in love with him, even though he has consistently spurned her offer of immortality as her husband and still mourns for home. She is ordered to release him by the messenger god [[Hermes]], who has been sent by Zeus in response to Athena's plea. Odysseus builds a raft and is given clothing, food, and drink by Calypso. When Poseidon learns that Odysseus has escaped, he wrecks the raft but, helped by a veil given by the sea nymph [[Ino (Greek mythology)|Ino]], Odysseus swims ashore on [[Scheria|Scherie]], the island of the Phaeacians. Naked and exhausted, he hides in a pile of leaves and falls asleep. The next morning, awakened by the laughter of girls, he sees the young [[Nausicaä]], who has gone to the seashore with her maids to wash clothes after Athena told her in a dream to do so. He appeals to her for help. She encourages him to seek the hospitality of her parents, [[Arete (mythology)|Arete]] and [[Alcinous]] (or Alkinous). Odysseus is welcomed and is not at first asked for his name, but Alcinous promises to provide him a ship to return him to his home country. He remains for several days, and is goaded into taking part in a [[discus throw]] by the taunts of [[Euryalus (Phaeacian)|Euryalus]], impressing the Phaeacians with his incredible athletic ability. Afterwards, he hears the blind singer [[Demodocus (Odyssey character)|Demodocus]] perform two narrative poems. The first is an otherwise obscure incident of the Trojan War, the "Quarrel of Odysseus and [[Achilles]]"; the second is the amusing tale of a love affair between two Olympian gods, [[Ares]] and [[Aphrodite]]. Finally, Odysseus asks Demodocus to return to the Trojan War theme and tell of the [[Trojan Horse]], a stratagem in which Odysseus had played a leading role. Unable to hide his emotion as he relives this episode, Odysseus at last reveals his identity. He then begins to tell the story of his return from Troy.

===Odysseus' account of his adventures===

[[File:Francesco Hayez 028.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|''Odysseus Overcome by [[Demodocus (Odyssey character)|Demodocus]]' Song'', by [[Francesco Hayez]], 1813–15]]

Odysseus goes back in time and recounts his story to the Phaeacians. After a failed piratical raid on [[Ismara|Ismaros]] in the land of the [[Cicones]], Odysseus and his twelve ships were driven off course by storms. Odysseus visited the lethargic [[Lotus-Eaters]] who gave his men their fruit that would have caused them to forget their homecoming had Odysseus not dragged them back to the ship by force. Afterwards, Odysseus and his men landed on a lush, uninhabited island near the land of the [[Cyclops|Cyclopes]]. The men then landed on shore and entered the cave of [[Polyphemus]], where they found all the cheeses and meat they desired. Upon returning home, Polyphemus sealed the entrance with a massive boulder and proceeded to eat Odysseus' men. Odysseus devised an escape plan in which he, identifying himself as "Nobody", plied Polyphemus with wine and blinded him with a wooden stake. When Polyphemus cried out, his neighbors left after Polyphemus claimed that "Nobody" had attacked him. Odysseus and his men finally left the cave by hiding on the underbellies of the sheep as they were let out of the cave. While they were escaping, however, Odysseus foolishly taunted Polyphemus and revealed his true identity. Recalling that had been prophesied by appeals to his father Poseidon. Poseidon then cursed Odysseus to wander the sea for ten years, during which he would lose all his crew and return home through the aid of others. After the escape, Odysseus and his crew stayed with [[Aeolus (son of Hippotes)|Aeolus]], a king endowed by the gods with the winds. He gave Odysseus a leather bag containing all the winds, except the west wind, a gift that should have ensured a safe return home. Just as Ithaca came into sight, the greedy sailors naively opened the bag while Odysseus slept, thinking it contained gold. All of the winds flew out and the resulting storm drove the ships back the way they had come. Aeolus, recognizing that Odysseus has drawn the ire of the gods, refused to further assist him.

The men then re-embarked and encountered the cannibalistic [[Laestrygonians]]. All of Odysseus' ships except his own entered the harbor of the Laestrygonians' Island and were immediately destroyed. He sailed on and reached the island of [[Aeaea]] where he visited the witch-goddess [[Circe]], daughter of the sun-god [[Helios]]. She turned half of his men into swine after feeding them drugged cheese and wine. Hermes warned Odysseus about Circe and gave Odysseus an herb called ''[[moly (herb)|moly]]'' which gave him resistance to Circe's magic. Odysseus forced the now-powerless Circe to change his men back to their human form, and was subsequently seduced by her. They remained with her on the island for one year, while they feasted and drank. Finally, guided by Circe's instructions, Odysseus and his crew crossed the ocean and reached a harbor at the western edge of the world, where Odysseus sacrificed to the dead. He first encountered the spirit of [[Elpenor]], a crewman who had gotten drunk and fallen from a roof to his death on Aeaea. Elpenor's ghost told Odysseus to bury his body, which Odysseus promised to do. Odysseus then summoned the spirit of the prophet [[Tiresias]] for advice on how to appease Poseidon upon his return home, and was told that he may return home if he is able to stay himself and his crew from eating the sacred livestock of [[Helios]] on the island of [[Thrinacia]] and that failure to do so would result in the loss of his ship and his entire crew. Next Odysseus met the spirit of his own mother, [[Anticlea]], who had died of grief during his long absence. From her, he got his first news of his own household, threatened by the greed of the Suitors. Finally, he met the spirits of famous men and women. Notably, he encountered the spirit of Agamemnon, of whose murder he now learned, and Achilles, who lamented the woes of the land of the dead but was comforted in hearing of the success of his son [[Neoptolemus]] (for Odysseus' encounter with the dead, see also ''[[Nekuia]]'').

[[File:Odysseus Sirens BM E440 n2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|right|Odysseus and the Sirens, eponymous vase of the [[Siren Painter]], c. 480-470 BC ([[British Museum]])]]

Returning to Aeaea, they buried Elpenor and were advised by Circe on the remaining stages of the journey. They skirted the land of the [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]]s, who sang an enchanting song that normally caused passing sailors to steer toward the rocks, only to hit them and sink. All of the sailors had their ears plugged up with beeswax, except for Odysseus, who was tied to the mast as he wanted to hear the song. He told his sailors not to untie him as it would only make him want to drown himself. They then passed between the six-headed monster [[Scylla]] and the whirlpool [[Charybdis]], narrowly avoiding death, even though Scylla snatched up six men. Next, they landed on the island of [[Thrinacia]], with the crew overriding Odysseus's wishes to remain away from the island. Zeus caused a storm which prevented them leaving, causing them to deplete the food given to them by Circe. While Odysseus was away praying, his men ignored the warnings of Tiresias and Circe and hunted the sacred cattle of Helios. The Sun God insisted that Zeus punish the men for this sacrilege. They suffered a shipwreck as they were driven towards Charybdis. All but Odysseus were drowned. Odysseus clung to a fig tree above Charybdis. Washed ashore on the island of [[Ogygia]], he was compelled to remain there as Calypso's lover, bored, homesick and trapped on her small island, until she was ordered by Zeus, via Hermes, to release Odysseus.
Odysseus did not realise how long it would take to get home to his family.

===Return to Ithaca===

[[File:Giuseppe Bottani - Athena revealing Ithaca to Ulysses.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|left|''[[Athena]] Revealing Ithaca to Ulysses'' by [[Giuseppe Bottani]] (18th century)]]

Having listened with rapt attention to his story, the [[Phaeacians]] agree to provide Odysseus with more treasure than he would have received from the spoils of Troy. They deliver him at night, while he is fast asleep, to a hidden harbour on Ithaca. Poseidon, offended that the Phaeacians have returned Odysseus home, destroys the Phaeacian ship on its return voyage, and the city sacrifices to Poseidon and agrees to stop giving escorts to strangers to appease him. Odysseus awakens and believes that he has been dropped on a distant land before Athena appears to him and reveals that he is indeed on Ithaca. She then hides his treasure in a nearby cave and disguises him as an elderly beggar so he can see how things stand in his household. He finds his way to the hut of one of his own slaves, the swineherd [[Eumaeus]], who treats him hospitably and speaks favorably of Odysseus. After dinner, the disguised Odysseus tells the farm laborers a fictitious tale of himself: he was born in [[Crete]], had led a party of Cretans to fight alongside other Greeks in the Trojan War, and had then spent seven years at the court of the king of Egypt, finally shipwrecking in [[Thesprotia]] and crossing from there to Ithaca. He further promises the men of the return of Odysseus, but his promises are wearily discounted by the men.

Meanwhile, Telemachus sails home from Sparta, evading an ambush set by the Suitors. He disembarks on the coast of Ithaca and makes for Eumaeus's hut. Father and son meet; Odysseus identifies himself to Telemachus (but still not to Eumaeus), and they decide that the Suitors must be killed. Telemachus goes home first. Accompanied by Eumaeus, Odysseus returns to his own house, still pretending to be a beggar. When Odysseus' dog (who was a puppy before he left) saw him, he becomes so excited that he dies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Homer|title=The Odyssey|page=Scroll 17 Line 8–8|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0218:book=17:card=8|accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is ridiculed by the Suitors in his own home, especially by one extremely impertinent man named [[Antinous son of Eupeithes|Antinous]]. Odysseus meets Penelope and tests her intentions by saying he once met Odysseus in Crete. Closely questioned, he adds that he had recently been in Thesprotia and had learned something there of Odysseus's recent wanderings.

Odysseus's identity is discovered by the housekeeper, [[Eurycleia]], when she recognizes an old scar as she is washing his feet. Eurycleia tries to tell Penelope about the beggar's true identity, but Athena makes sure that Penelope cannot hear her. Odysseus then swears Eurycleia to secrecy.

===Slaying of the Suitors===

[[File:Thomas Degeorge Ulysse.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''Ulysse et Télémaque Massacrent les Prétendants de Pénélope'' by [[Thomas Degeorge]] (1812)]]

The next day, at Athena's prompting, Penelope maneuvers the Suitors into competing for her hand with an archery competition using Odysseus' bow. The man who can string the bow and shoot it through a dozen axe heads would win. Odysseus takes part in the competition himself: he alone is strong enough to string the bow and shoot it through the dozen axe heads, making him the winner. He then throws off his rags and kills Antinous with his next arrow. Then, with the help of Athena, Odysseus, Telemachus, Eumaeus, and [[Philoetius]] the cowherd he kills the other Suitors, first using the rest of the arrows and then by swords and spears once both sides armed themselves. Once the battle is won, Odysseus and Telemachus also hang twelve of their household maids whom Eurycleia identifies as guilty of betraying Penelope or having sex with the Suitors. They mutilate and kill the goatherd [[Melanthius (Odyssey)|Melanthius]], who had mocked and abused Odysseus and brought weapons and armor to the suitors. Now, at last, Odysseus identifies himself to Penelope. She is hesitant but recognizes him when he mentions that he made their bed from an olive tree still rooted to the ground. Many modern and ancient scholars take this to be the original ending of the ''Odyssey'', and the rest to be an interpolation.

The next day he and Telemachus visit the country farm of his old father [[Laertes]], who likewise accepts his identity only when Odysseus correctly describes the orchard that Laertes had previously given him.

The citizens of Ithaca have followed Odysseus on the road, planning to avenge the killing of the Suitors, their sons. Their leader points out that Odysseus has now caused the deaths of two generations of the men of Ithaca: his sailors, not one of whom survived; and the Suitors, whom he has now executed (albeit rightly). Athena intervenes in a ''[[Deus ex machina|dea ex machina]]'' and persuades both sides to give up the [[feud|vendetta]]. After this, Ithaca is at peace once more, concluding the ''Odyssey''.

==Character of Odysseus==

{{Main|Odysseus}}

[[File:Mosaïque d'Ulysse et les sirènes.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|left|A Roman [[mosaic]] depicting a maritime scene with [[Odysseus]] (Latin: Ulysses) and [[Siren (mythology)|the Sirens]], from [[Carthage]], 2nd century AD, now in the [[Bardo Museum]], [[Tunisia]]]]

Odysseus' name means "trouble" in Greek, referring to both the giving and receiving of trouble—as is often the case in his wanderings. An early example of this is the boar hunt that gave Odysseus the scar by which Eurycleia recognizes him; Odysseus is injured by the boar and responds by killing it. Odysseus' heroic trait is his ''mētis'', or "cunning intelligence". He is often described as the "Peer of [[Zeus]] in Counsel".  This intelligence is most often manifested by his use of disguise and deceptive speech. His disguises take forms both physical (altering his appearance) and verbal, such as telling the [[Cyclops]] [[Polyphemus]] that his name is {{lang|grc|[[Outis|Οὖτις]]}}, "Nobody", then escaping after blinding Polyphemus. When asked by other Cyclopes why he is screaming, Polyphemus replies that "Nobody" is hurting him, so the others assume that "If alone as you are [Polyphemus] none uses violence on you, why, there is no avoiding the sickness sent by great Zeus; so you had better pray to your father, the lord Poseidon".&lt;ref&gt;From the Odyssey of Homer translated by [[Richmond Lattimore]] [Book 9, page 147/8, lines 410 - 412].&lt;/ref&gt; The most evident flaw that Odysseus sports is that of his arrogance and his pride, or ''[[hubris]].'' As he sails away from the island of the Cyclopes, he shouts his name and boasts that nobody can defeat the "Great Odysseus". The Cyclops then throws the top half of a mountain at him and prays to his father, Poseidon, saying that Odysseus has blinded him. This enrages Poseidon, causing the god to thwart Odysseus' homecoming for a very long time.

==Structure==
The ''Odyssey'' is written in [[dactylic hexameter]]. It opens ''[[in medias res]]'', in the middle of the overall story, with prior events described through [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] or storytelling. This device is also used by later authors of literary epics, such as [[Virgil]] in the ''[[Aeneid]]'', [[Luís de Camões]] in ''[[Os Lusíadas]]''&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11198/ |title = The Lusiads |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1800–1882 |accessdate = 2013-08-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alexander Pope]] in ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]''.

The first four books of the poem trace [[Telemachus]]' efforts to assert control of the household, and then, at Athena's advice, his efforts to search for news of his long-lost father. Then the scene shifts: Odysseus has been a captive of the beautiful nymph [[Calypso (mythology)|Calypso]], with whom he has spent seven of his ten lost years. Released by the intercession of his patroness [[Athena]], through the aid of [[Hermes]], he departs, but his raft is destroyed by his divine enemy [[Poseidon]], who is angry because Odysseus blinded his son, [[Polyphemus]].  When Odysseus washes up on [[Scheria|Scherie]], home to the [[Phaeacians]], he is assisted by the young [[Nausicaä]] and is treated hospitably. In return, he satisfies the Phaeacians' curiosity, telling them, and the reader, of all his adventures since departing from Troy. The shipbuilding Phaeacians then loan him a ship to return to [[Ithaca]], where he is aided by the swineherd [[Eumaeus]], meets Telemachus, regains his household by killing the Suitors, and is reunited with his faithful wife, [[Penelope]].

All ancient and nearly all modern editions and translations of the ''Odyssey'' are divided into 24 books. This division is convenient, but it may not be original. Many scholars{{who|date=June 2017}} believe it was developed by [[Alexandrian scholarship|Alexandrian]] editors of the 3rd century BC. In the [[Classical Greece|Classical period]], moreover, several of the books (individually and in groups) were given their own titles: the first four books, focusing on Telemachus, are commonly known as the ''[[Telemachy]]''. Odysseus' narrative, Book 9, featuring his encounter with the cyclops Polyphemus, is traditionally called the ''Cyclopeia''. Book 11, the section describing his meeting with the spirits of the dead is known as the ''[[Nekuia]]''. Books 9 through 12, wherein Odysseus recalls his adventures for his Phaeacian hosts, are collectively referred to as the ''Apologoi'': Odysseus' "stories". Book 22, wherein Odysseus kills all the Suitors, has been given the title ''Mnesterophonia'': "slaughter of the Suitors". This concludes the Greek [[Epic Cycle]], though fragments remain of the "alternative ending" of sorts known as the ''[[Telegony]]''.

''Telegony'' aside, the last 548 lines of the ''Odyssey'', corresponding to Book 24, are believed by many scholars to have been added by a slightly later poet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carne-Ross|first1=D. S.|article=The Poem of Odysseus|title=The Odyssey, translated by Robert Fitzgerald|date=1998|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|location=New York|isbn=978-0-374-52574-3|page=lxi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several passages in earlier books seem to be setting up the events of Book 24, so if it were indeed a later addition, the offending editor would seem to have changed earlier text as well. For more about varying views on the origin, authorship and unity of the poem see [[Homeric scholarship]].

==Geography of the ''Odyssey''==
{{Main|Homer's Ithaca|Geography of the Odyssey}}
The events in the main sequence of the ''Odyssey'' (excluding Odysseus' embedded narrative of his wanderings) take place in the [[Peloponnese]] and in what are now called the [[Ionian Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;Strabo 1.2.15, quoted by [[Moses I. Finley]], ''The World of Odysseus'', rev. ed. 1976:33.&lt;/ref&gt; There are difficulties in the apparently simple identification of [[Ithaca]], the homeland of Odysseus, which may or may not be the same island that is now called Ithakē (Ιθάκη). The wanderings of Odysseus as told to the Phaeacians, and the location of the Phaeacians' own island of [[Scheria]], pose more fundamental problems, if geography is to be applied: scholars, both ancient and modern, are divided as to whether or not any of the places visited by Odysseus (after [[Ismara|Ismaros]] and before his return to [[Ithaca]]) are real.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Lane Fox, ''Travelling Heroes in the Epic Age of Homer'', 2008, ch. "Finding Neverland"; Lane summarizes the literature in notes and bibliography.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences on the ''Odyssey''==
[[File:Humbaba deamon-AO 9034-IMG 0655-black.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|Terracotta plaque of the Mesopotamian ogre [[Humbaba]], believed to be a possible inspiration for the figure of [[Polyphemus]]]]

Scholars have seen strong influences from Near Eastern mythology and literature in the ''Odyssey''. [[Martin Litchfield West|Martin West]] has noted substantial parallels between the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' and the ''Odyssey''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Litchfield West|West, Martin.]] ''The East Face of Helicon: West Asiatic Elements in Greek Poetry and Myth''. (Oxford 1997) 402-417.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Odysseus and [[Gilgamesh]] are known for traveling to the ends of the earth, and on their journeys go to the land of the dead. On his voyage to the underworld, Odysseus follows instructions given to him by [[Circe]]. Her island, [[Aeaea]], is located at the edges of the world and seems to have close associations with the sun. Like Odysseus, Gilgamesh gets directions on how to reach the land of the dead from a divine helper: in this case, the goddess [[Siduri]], who, like Circe, dwells by the sea at the ends of the earth. Her home is also associated with the sun: Gilgamesh reaches Siduri's house by passing through a tunnel underneath Mt. [[Mashu]], the high mountain from which the sun comes into the sky. West argues that the similarity of Odysseus' and Gilgamesh's journeys to the edges of the earth are the result of the influence of the Gilgamesh epic upon the ''Odyssey''.

In 1914, paleontologist [[Othenio Abel]] surmised the origins of the cyclops to be the result of ancient Greeks finding an elephant skull. The enormous nasal passage in the middle of the forehead could have looked like the eye socket of a giant, to those who had never seen a living elephant.&lt;ref&gt;Abel's surmise is noted by [[Adrienne Mayor]], ''The First Fossil Hunters: Paleontology in Greek and Roman Times'' (Princeton University Press) 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Classical scholars, on the other hand, have long realized that the story of the cyclops was originally a Greek [[fairy tale|folk tale]], which existed independently of the ''Odyssey'' and which only became embedded in it at a later date. Similar stories are found in cultures across Europe and the Middle East.&lt;ref name="Anderson 2000 127–131"&gt;{{cite book |title= Fairytale in the Ancient World |last= Anderson|first= Graham|year= 2000|publisher= Routledge|isbn= 978-0-415-23702-4|pages= 127–131|url= https://books.google.com/books/about/Fairytale_in_the_Ancient_World.html?id=B2DAAlUrbBIC|accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this explanation, the cyclops was originally simply a giant or ogre, much like [[Humbaba]] in the ''Epic of Gilgamesh''.&lt;ref name="Anderson 2000 127–131"/&gt; The detail about it having one eye was simply invented in order to explain how the creature was so easily blinded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Fairytale in the Ancient World |last= Anderson|first= Graham|year= 2000|publisher= Routledge|isbn= 978-0-415-23702-4|pages= 124–125|url= https://books.google.com/books/about/Fairytale_in_the_Ancient_World.html?id=B2DAAlUrbBIC|accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Themes ==

=== Homecoming ===
[[File:Homerus - Odissea, 1794 - 3939651 F.jpg|thumb|''Odissea'' (1794)]]
An important factor to consider about Odysseus' homecoming is the hint at potential endings to the epic by using other characters as parallels for his journey.&lt;ref name="Thornton on Homecomings"&gt;Thornton, Agathe. "The Homecomings of the Achaeans." ''People and Themes in Homer's Odyssey''. Dunedin: U of Otago in Association with Methuen, London, 1970. 1-15. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, one example is that of [[Agamemnon]]'s homecoming versus Odysseus' homecoming. Upon Agamemnon's return, his wife [[Clytemnestra]] and her lover, [[Aegisthus]] kill Agamemnon. Agamemnon's son, [[Orestes]], out of vengeance for his father's death, kills Aegisthus. This parallel compares the death of the suitors to the death of Aegisthus and sets Orestes up as an example for [[Telemachus]].&lt;ref name="Thornton on Homecomings" /&gt; Also, because Odysseus knows about Clytemnestra's betrayal, Odysseus returns home in disguise in order to test the loyalty of his own wife, [[Penelope]].&lt;ref name="Thornton on Homecomings" /&gt;  Later, Agamemnon praises Penelope for not killing Odysseus. It is because of Penelope that Odysseus has fame and a successful homecoming. This successful homecoming is unlike [[Achilles]], who has fame but is dead, and Agamemnon, who had an unsuccessful homecoming resulting in his death.&lt;ref name="Thornton on Homecomings" /&gt;

=== Wandering ===

Only two of Odysseus's adventures are described by the poet. The rest of Odysseus' adventures are recounted by Odysseus himself. The two scenes that the poet describes are Odysseus on [[Calypso (mythology)|Calypso]]'s island and Odysseus' encounter with the Phaeacians. These scenes are told by the poet to represent an important transition in Odysseus' journey: being concealed to returning home.&lt;ref name="Thornton on Wanderings"&gt;Thornton, Agathe. "The Wanderings of Odysseus." ''People and Themes in Homer's Odyssey''. Dunedin: U of Otago in Association with Methuen, London, 1970. 16-37. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Calypso's name means "concealer" or "one who conceals," and that is exactly what she does with Odysseus.&lt;ref&gt;Calypso and Odysseus. (n.d.). Retrieved April 28, 2016, from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.greekmyths-greekmythology.com/calypso-odysseus-greek-myth/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Calypso keeps Odysseus concealed from the world and unable to return home. After leaving Calypso's island, the poet describes Odysseus' encounters with the Phaeacians—those who "convoy without hurt to all men"&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Odyssey'' 8.566. (''The Odyssey of Homer''. Translated by Richmond Lattimore. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1975.)&lt;/ref&gt;—which represents his transition from not returning home to returning home.&lt;ref name="Thornton on Wanderings" /&gt; Also, during Odysseus' journey, he encounters many beings that are close to the gods. These encounters are useful in understanding that Odysseus is in a world beyond man and that influences the fact he cannot return home.&lt;ref name="Thornton on Wanderings" /&gt; These beings that are close to the gods include the Phaeacians who lived near Cyclopes,&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Odyssey'' 6.4-5. (''The Odyssey of Homer''. Translated by Richmond Lattimore. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1975.)&lt;/ref&gt; whose king, [[Alcinous]], is the great-grandson of the king of the giants, [[Giants (Greek mythology)|Eurymedon]], and the grandson of Poseidon.&lt;ref name="Thornton on Wanderings" /&gt; Some of the other characters that Odysseus encounters are [[Polyphemus]] who is the cyclops son of Poseidon, God of Oceans,  [[Circe]] who is the sorceress daughter of the Sun that turns men into animals, Calypso who is a goddess, and the [[Laestrygonians]] who are cannibalistic giants.&lt;ref name="Thornton on Wanderings" /&gt;

=== Guest-friendship ===

Throughout the course of the epic, Odysseus encounters several examples of ''[[xenia (Greek)|xenia]]'' ("guest-friendship"), which provide models of how hosts should and should not act.&lt;ref name="Thornton on Guest-Friendship"&gt;Thornton, Agathe. "Guest-Friendship". ''People and Themes in Homer's Odyssey''. Dunedin: U of Otago in Association with Methuen, London, 1970. 38-46. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The Phaeacians demonstrate exemplary guest-friendship by feeding Odysseus, giving him a place to sleep, and granting him a safe voyage home, which are all things a good host should do. Polyphemus demonstrates poor guest-friendship. His only "gift" to Odysseus is that he will eat him last.&lt;ref name="Thornton on Guest-Friendship" /&gt; Calypso also exemplifies poor guest-friendship because she does not allow Odysseus to leave her island.&lt;ref name="Thornton on Guest-Friendship" /&gt; Another important factor to guest-friendship is that kingship implies generosity. It is assumed that a king has the means to be a generous host and is more generous with his own property.&lt;ref name="Thornton on Guest-Friendship" /&gt; This is best seen when Odysseus, disguised as a beggar, begs Antinous, one of the suitors, for food and Antinous denies his request. Odysseus essentially says that while Antinous may look like a king, he is far from a king since he is not generous.&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Odyssey'' 17.415-44. (''The Odyssey of Homer''. Trans. Richmond Lattimore. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1975. Print.)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Testing ===
[[File:Odysseus und Penelope (Tischbein).jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Penelope questions Odysseus to prove his identity.]]

Another theme throughout the ''Odyssey'' is testing.&lt;ref name="Thornton on Themes" /&gt; This occurs in two distinct ways. Odysseus tests the loyalty of others and others test Odysseus' identity. An example of Odysseus testing the loyalties of others is when he returns home.&lt;ref name="Thornton on Themes" /&gt; Instead of immediately revealing his identity, he arrives disguised as a beggar and then proceeds to determine who in his house has remained loyal to him and who has helped the suitors. After Odysseus reveals his true identity, the characters test Odysseus' identity to see if he really is who he says he is.&lt;ref name="Thornton on Themes" /&gt; For instance, Penelope tests Odysseus' identity by saying that she will move the bed into the other room for him. This is a difficult task since it is made out of a living tree that would require being cut down, a fact that only the real Odysseus would know, thus proving his identity. For more information on the progression of testing type scenes, read more below.&lt;ref name="Thornton on Themes"&gt;Thornton, Agathe. "Testing." ''People and Themes in Homer's Odyssey''. Dunedin: U of Otago in Association with Methuen, London, 1970. 47-51. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Omens ===

Omens occur frequently throughout the ''Odyssey,'' as well as in many other epics. Within the Odyssey, omens frequently involve birds.&lt;ref name="Lattimore" /&gt; It is important to note who receives the omens and what these omens mean to the characters and to the epic as a whole. For instance, bird omens are shown to Telemachus, Penelope, Odysseus, and the suitors.&lt;ref name="Lattimore" /&gt; Telemachus and Penelope receive their omens as well in the form of words, sneezes, and dreams.&lt;ref name="Lattimore" /&gt; However, Odysseus is the only character who receives thunder or lightning as an omen.&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Odyssey'' 20.103-4. (''The Odyssey of Homer''. Trans. Richmond Lattimore. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1975. Print.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Odyssey'' 21.414. (''The Odyssey of Homer''. Trans. Richmond Lattimore. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1975. Print.)&lt;/ref&gt; This is important to note because the thunder came from Zeus, the king of the gods. This direct relationship between Zeus and Odysseus represents the kingship of Odysseus.&lt;ref name="Lattimore"&gt;Thornton, Agathe. "Omens." ''People and Themes in Homer's Odyssey''. Dunedin: U of Otago in Association with Methuen, London, 1970. 52-57. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scenes ==

[[File:Odysseus and Euryclea by Christian Gottlob Heyne - Project Gutenberg eText 13725.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.1|''Odysseus and Eurycleia'' by [[Christian Gottlob Heyne]]]]

=== Finding scenes ===

Finding scenes occur in the ''Odyssey'' when a character discovers another character within the epic. Finding scenes proceed as followed:&lt;ref name="Thornton on Wanderings" /&gt;
# The character encounters or finds another character.
# The encountered character is identified and described.
# The character approaches and then converses with the found character.
These finding scenes can be identified several times throughout the epic including when Telemachus and [[Peisistratos|Pisistratus]] find [[Menelaus]] when Calypso finds Odysseus on the beach, and when the suitor [[Amphimedon]] finds Agamemnon in Hades.&lt;ref name="Thornton on Wanderings" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Edwards" /&gt;

=== Guest-friendship ===

Guest-friendship is also a theme in the ''Odyssey'', but it too follows a very specific pattern. This pattern is:
# The arrival and the reception of the guest.
# Bathing or providing fresh clothes to the guest.
# Providing food and drink to the guest.
# Questions may be asked of the guest and entertainment should be provided by the host.
# The guest should be given a place to sleep and both the guest and host retire for the night.
# The guest and host exchange gifts, the guest is granted a safe journey home and departs.
Another important factor of guest-friendship is not keeping the guest longer than they wish and also promising their safety while they are a guest within the host's home.&lt;ref name="Thornton on Guest-Friendship" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Edwards" /&gt;

=== Testing ===

While testing is a theme with the epic, it also has a very specific type scene that accompanies it as well. Throughout the epic, the testing of others follows a typical pattern. This pattern is:
# Odysseus is hesitant to question the loyalties of others.
# Odysseus tests the loyalties of others by questioning them.
# The characters reply to Odysseus' questions.
# Odysseus proceeds to reveal his identity.
# The characters test Odysseus' identity.
# There is a rise of emotions associated with Odysseus' recognition, usually lament or joy.
# Finally, the reconciled characters work together.&lt;ref name="Thornton on Themes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Edwards" /&gt;

=== Omens ===

Omens are another example of a type scene in the ''Odyssey.'' Two important parts of an omen type scene are the recognition of the omen and then the interpretation.&lt;ref name="Lattimore" /&gt; In the ''Odyssey'' specifically, there are several omens involving birds. All of the bird omens—with the exception of the first one in the epic—show large birds attacking smaller birds.&lt;ref name="Lattimore" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Edwards" /&gt; Accompanying each omen is a wish which can be either explicitly stated or only implied.&lt;ref name="Lattimore" /&gt; For example, Telemachus wishes for vengeance&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Odyssey'' 2.143-5. (''The Odyssey of Homer''. Trans. Richmond Lattimore. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1975. Print.)&lt;/ref&gt; and for Odysseus to be home,&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Odyssey'' 15.155-9. (''The Odyssey of Homer''. Trans. Richmond Lattimore. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1975. Print.)&lt;/ref&gt; Penelope wishes for Odysseus' return,&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Odyssey'' 19.136. (''The Odyssey of Homer''. Trans. Richmond Lattimore. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1975. Print.)&lt;/ref&gt; and the suitors wish for the death of Telemachus.&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Odyssey'' 20.240-243. (''The Odyssey of Homer''. Trans. Richmond Lattimore. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1975. Print.)&lt;/ref&gt; The omens seen in the ''Odyssey'' are also a recurring theme throughout the epic.&lt;ref name="Lattimore" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Edwards"&gt;Edwards, Mark W. "Homer and the Oral Tradition." ''Oral Tradition'' 7.2 (1992): 284-330. Web. 06 Apr. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural impact==

[[File:Annibale Carracci, The Cyclops Polyphemus.jpg|thumb|''The Cyclops Polyphemus'' by [[Annibale Carracci]] (between 1595 and 1605), showing a scene shared between the ''Odyssey'' and [[Euripides]]'s ''[[Cyclops (play)|Cyclops]]'' (1922)]]

The ''Odyssey'' is regarded as one of the most important foundational works of [[western literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bahr|first1=Arthur|title=Foundation of Western Literature|url=https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/literature/21l-001-foundations-of-western-culture-homer-to-dante-fall-2008/|website=MIT Open Courseware|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely regarded by western literary critics as a timeless classic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cartwright|first1=Mark|title=Odyssey|url=http://www.ancient.eu/Odyssey/|website=Ancient History Encyclopedia|publisher=Ancient History Encyclopedia|accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Straightforward retellings of the ''Odyssey'' have flourished ever since the [[Middle Ages]]. ''Merugud Uilix maicc Leirtis'' ("On the Wandering of Ulysses, son of Laertes") is an eccentric [[Old Irish]] version of the material; the work exists in a 12th-century AD manuscript, which linguists believe is based on an 8th-century original.&lt;ref&gt;Merugud Uilix maicc Leirtis. Kuno Meyer (ed), First edition [v + 36 pp.; v–xii Introduction; 1–15 Critical edition of Text; 16–29 Translation; 30–36 Index Verborum.] David Nutt270 Strand, London (1886)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/meruguduilixmai00homegoog ''Merugud Uilix maicc Leirtis: the Irish Odyssey''], ed. Kuno Meyer, London: 1886.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria]]'', first performed in 1640, is an opera by [[Claudio Monteverdi]] based on the second half of Homer's ''Odyssey''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2007/03/23/9078832/monteverdis-the-return-of-ulysses|title=Monteverdi's 'The Return of Ulysses'|last=|first=|date=|website=NPR.org|access-date=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first canto of [[Ezra Pound]]'s ''[[The Cantos]]'' (1917) is both a translation and a retelling of Odysseus' [[katabasis|journey to the underworld]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=New Approaches to Ezra Pound|last=Hesse|first=Eva|publisher=University of California Press|year=1969|isbn=|location=|pages=126|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poem "[[Ulysses (poem)|Ulysses]]" by Alfred, Lord Tennyson is narrated by an aged Ulysses who is determined to continue to live life to the fullest. ''[[The Odyssey (TV miniseries)|The Odyssey]]'' (1997), a made-for-TV movie directed by [[Andrei Konchalovsky]], is a slightly abbreviated version of the epic.

Other authors have composed more creative reworkings of the poem, often updated to address contemporary themes and concerns. ''[[Cyclops (play)|Cyclops]]'' by [[Euripides]], the only [[extant literature|fully extant]] [[satyr play]],&lt;ref&gt;Euripides. McHugh, Heather, trans. ''Cyclops; Greek Tragedy in New Translations''. Oxford Univ. Press (2001) {{ISBN|9780198032656}}&lt;/ref&gt; retells the episode involving [[Polyphemus]] with a humorous twist.&lt;ref&gt;Dougherty, Carol. “The Double Vision of Euripides' ''Cyclops'': An Ethnographic ''Odyssey'' on the Satyr Stage”. ''Comparative Drama''. Vol. 33, No. 3 (Fall 1999), pp. 313-338&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[True History|A True Story]]'', written by [[Lucian]] of Samosata in the 2nd century AD, is a satire on the ''Odyssey'' and on ancient travel tales, describing a journey sailing westward, beyond the [[Pillars of Hercules]] and to the [[Moon]], the first known text that could be called [[science fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;Swanson, Roy Arthur: {{Quote|Lucian of Samosata, the Greco-Syrian satirist of the second century, appears today as an exemplar of the science-fiction artist. There is little, if any, need to argue that his mythopoeic Milesian Tales and his literary fantastic voyages and utopistic hyperbole comport with the genre of science fiction;&amp;nbsp;...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:JoyceUlysses2.jpg|thumb|left|Front cover of [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'']]

[[James Joyce]]'s [[modernist literature|modernist]] novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' (1922) is a retelling of the ''Odyssey'' set in modern-day [[Dublin]]. Each chapter in the book has an assigned theme, technique, and correspondences between its characters and those of Homer's ''Odyssey''.&lt;ref name="The Classical Tradition"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grafton|first1=Anthony|last2=Most|first2=Glenn W.|last3=Settis|first3=Salvatore|title=The Classical Tradition|date=2010|publisher=The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts and London, England|isbn=978-0-674-03572-0|page=653}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Homer's Daughter]]'' by [[Robert Graves]] is a novel imagining how the version we have might have been invented out of older tales. The Japanese-French anime ''[[Ulysses 31]]'' (1981) updates the ancient setting into a 31st-century [[space opera]]. ''[[Omeros]]'' (1991), an epic poem by [[Derek Walcott]], is in part a retelling of the ''Odyssey'', set on the [[Caribbean]] island of [[St. Lucia]]. The film ''[[Ulysses' Gaze]]'' (1995) directed by Theo Angelopoulos has many of the elements of the ''Odyssey'' set against the backdrop of the most recent and previous Balkan Wars.&lt;ref name="The Classical Tradition"/&gt;

[[Daniel Wallace (author)|Daniel Wallace]]'s ''[[Big Fish: A Novel of Mythic Proportions]]'' (1998) adapts the epic to the [[American South]], while also incorporating [[tall tales]] into its first-person narrative much as Odysseus does in the ''Apologoi'' (Books 9-12). The [[Coen Brothers]]' 2000 film ''[[O Brother, Where Art Thou?]]'' is loosely based on Homer's poem. [[Margaret Atwood]]'s 2005 novella ''[[The Penelopiad]]'' is an ironic rewriting of the ''Odyssey'' from [[Penelope]]'s perspective. [[Zachary Mason]]'s ''[[The Lost Books of the Odyssey]]'' (2007) is a series of short stories that rework Homer's original plot in a contemporary style reminiscent of [[Italo Calvino]]. ''[[The Heroes of Olympus]]'' (2010–2014) by [[Rick Riordan]] is based entirely on Greek mythology and includes many aspects and characters from the ''Odyssey''.&lt;ref name="enotes.com"&gt;{{Cite web|title = When was Homer's Odyssey written? – Homework Help – eNotes.com|url = http://www.enotes.com/homework-help/when-was-odyssey-written-1699|website = eNotes|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors have sought to imagine new endings for the ''Odyssey''. In canto XXVI of the ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', [[Dante Alighieri]] meets Odysseus in the [[eighth circle of hell]], where Odysseus himself appends a new ending to the ''Odyssey'' in which he never returns to [[Ithaca]] and instead continues his restless adventuring.&lt;ref&gt;''Inferno'', Canto XXVI, lines 98-99.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grafton|first1=Anthony|last2=Most|first2=Glenn W.|last3=Settis|first3=Salvatore|title=The Classical Tradition|date=2010|publisher=The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts and London, England|isbn=978-0-674-03572-0|page=652}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nikos Kazantzakis]] aspires to continue the poem and explore more modern concerns in his epic poem ''[[The Odyssey: A Modern Sequel]]'', which was first published in 1938 in modern Greek.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grafton|first1=Anthony|last2=Most|first2=Glenn W.|last3=Settis|first3=Salvatore|title=The Classical Tradition|date=2010|publisher=The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts and London, England|isbn=978-0-674-03572-0|pages=652–653}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, [[BBC]] Culture polled experts around the world to nominate the stories they felt had shaped mindsets or influenced history. ''Odyssey'' topped the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20180521-the-100-stories-that-shaped-the-world|title=The 100 stories that shaped the world|first=22 May|last=2018|website=bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20180521-the-greatest-tale-ever-told|title=The greatest tale ever told?|first=Natalie|last=Haynes|website=bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''PMS Clan''' (formerly Psychotic Man Slayerz, now Pandora’s Mighty Soldiers) was born from the camaraderie of finding other girl gamers in a male dominated online gaming community. Because of the original sparseness of women in the online gaming community, and the amount of harassment female gamers are submitted to, the PMS Clan was founded to provide a competitive, fun and positive environment for female gamers.  Since its inception in 2002, PMS has become one of the most recognized female oriented Clans in the world. Members from all walks of life are integrated into one community, sharing one passion – gaming.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pmsclan.com/forum/recruitment-and-clan-regulations-arena/pms|h2o-clan-rules-faqs/handbook/16366-handbook&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Past Poisons: An Ellis Peters Memorial Anthology of Historical Crime''''' is a 1998 British anthology of [[historical mystery]] short stories and novellas, edited by [[Maxim Jakubowski]]. The collection is named for novelist [[Ellis Peters]], whose ''[[The Cadfael Chronicles|Cadfael Chronicles]]'' (1977-1994) are generally credited for popularizing the combined genre of [[historical fiction]] and [[mystery fiction]] that would become known as historical mystery.&lt;ref name="PW Picker 2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/new-titles/adult-announcements/article/43024-mysteries-of-history.html |title=Mysteries of History |first=Lenny |last=Picker |date=3 March 2010 |accessdate=13 November 2013 |work=[[Publishers Weekly]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WSJ 2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://m.us.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704804204575069371115999474?mobile=y |title=Five Best Historical Mystery Novels |first=David B.|last=Rivkin Jr. |date=27 February 2010 |accessdate=17 November 2013 |website=WSJ.com |publisher=''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peking opera''', or '''Beijing opera''' ({{zh|s=京剧 |p=Jīngjù}}) is a form of [[Chinese opera]] which combines music, vocal performance, mime, dance and acrobatics. It arose in the late 18th century and became fully developed and recognized by the mid-19th century.&lt;ref name="Afternoon"&gt;{{cite book | first=Joshua S. | last=Goldstein | title=Drama Kings: Players and Publics in the Re-creation of Peking Opera, 1870–1937 | year=2007 | publisher=University of California Press | work = | pages =3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The form was extremely popular in the [[Qing dynasty]] court and has come to be regarded as one of the cultural treasures of China.&lt;ref name="Taiping"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Mackerras, Colin Patrick| title=Theatre and the Taipings| journal=Modern China| year=1976| volume=2| issue=4| pages=473–501 | doi=10.1177/009770047600200404}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major performance troupes are based in [[Beijing]], [[Tianjin]] and [[Shanghai]].&lt;ref name="Contemp"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Wichmann, Elizabeth| title=Tradition and Innovation in Contemporary Beijing Opera Performance| journal=TDR| year=1990| volume=34| issue=1| pages=146–178| doi=10.2307/1146013 | jstor=1146013 | publisher=TDR (1988–), Vol. 34, No. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The art form is also preserved in [[Taiwan]] (Republic of China), where it is also known as {{lang|zh-Latn|Guójù}} ({{zh|t=國劇 |l=National opera}}). It has also spread to other regions such as the [[United States]] and [[Japan]].&lt;ref name="1930 New York"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Rao, Nancy Yunhwa| title=Racial Essences and Historical Invisibility: Chinese Opera in New York, 1930| journal=Cambridge Opera Journal| year=2000| volume=12| issue=2| pages=135–162 | doi=10.1017/S095458670000135X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peking opera features four main types of performers. Performing troupes often have several of each variety, as well as numerous secondary and tertiary performers. With their elaborate and colorful costumes, performers are the only focal points on Peking opera's characteristically sparse stage. They use the skills of speech, song, dance and combat in movements that are symbolic and suggestive, rather than realistic. Above all else, the skill of performers is evaluated according to the beauty of their movements. Performers also adhere to a variety of stylistic conventions that help audiences navigate the plot of the production.&lt;ref name="aural"&gt;{{cite book | title=Listening to Theatre: The Aural Dimension of Beijing Opera| last=Wichmann| first=Elizabeth| year=1991| pages=360| publisher=University of Hawaii Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The layers of meaning within each movement must be expressed in time with music. The music of Peking opera can be divided into the {{lang|zh-Latn|xīpí}} ({{lang|zh|西皮}}) and {{lang|zh-Latn|èrhuáng}} ({{lang|zh-hans|二黄}}) styles. Melodies include [[aria]]s, fixed-tune melodies and [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] patterns.&lt;ref name="aria"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Guy, Nancy A.| title=The Appreciation of Chinese Opera: A Reply to Ching-Hsi Perng (in Forum for Readers and Authors)| journal=Asian Theatre Journal| year=1990| volume=7| issue=2| pages=254–259 | doi=10.2307/1124341 | jstor=1124341 | publisher=Asian Theatre Journal, Vol. 7, No. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The repertoire of Peking opera includes over 1,400 works, which are based on [[Chinese history]], [[Chinese folklore|folklore]] and, increasingly, contemporary life.&lt;ref&gt;Wichmann, Elizabeth (1991) p.12–16&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional Peking opera was denounced as 'feudalistic' and 'bourgeois' during the [[Cultural Revolution]] of the 1960s and replaced with the [[Revolutionary opera|eight revolutionary model operas]] as a means of propaganda and indoctrination.&lt;ref name="Lu Xing"/&gt; After the Cultural Revolution, these transformations were largely undone. In recent years, Peking opera has attempted numerous reforms in response to sagging audience numbers. These reforms, which include improving performance quality, adapting new performance elements and performing new and original plays, have met with mixed success.

==Etymology==
"Peking opera" is the English term for the art form; the term entered the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', 2nd edition, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Beijing opera'' is a more recent equivalent.

In [[China]], the art form has been known by many other names in different times and places. The earliest Chinese name was a combination of the Xipi and Erhuang melodies, and was called ''Pi Huang''. As it increased in popularity, its name became ''Jingju'' or ''Jingxi'', which reflected its start in the capital city, Jing, and the form of the performance, Xi. From 1927 to 1949, Beijing was known as Beiping, and Peking opera was known as ''Pingxi'' or ''Pingju'' (Traditional 平劇, Simplified 平剧) to reflect this change. Finally, with the establishment of the People's Republic of China, the name of the capital city was reverted to Beijing, and the formal name of Beijing theatre in Mainland China was established as ''Jingju''. The Taiwanese name for this type of opera, ''Guoju'', national theatre style, reflects [[Political status of Taiwan|disputes]] over the true seat of the Chinese government.&lt;ref name="Name?"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Guy, Nancy A.| title=Peking Opera as "National Opera" in Taiwan: What's in a Name?| journal=Asian Theatre Journal| year=1995| volume=12| issue=1| pages=85–103 | doi=10.2307/1124469 | jstor=1124469 | publisher=Asian Theatre Journal, Vol. 12, No. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origins===
[[File:Sun Wukong at Beijing opera - Journey to the West.jpg|thumb|left|The character [[Sun Wukong]] at the Peking opera from ''[[Journey to the West]]'']]
Peking opera was born when the 'Four Great Anhui Troupes' brought Anhui opera, or what is now called ''[[Huiju]]'', in 1790 to Beijing, for the eightieth birthday of the [[Qianlong Emperor]]&lt;ref name="Xu"&gt;{{cite book|author=Chengbei Xu|title=Peking Opera|date=9 March 2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-18821-0|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 25 September.&lt;ref name="Elliott"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark C. Elliott|title=Emperor Qianlong: Son of Heaven, Man of the World|year=2009|publisher=Longman Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-321-08444-6|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally staged for the court and only made available to the public later. In 1828, several famous Hubei troupes arrived in Beijing and performed jointly with Anhui troupes. The combination gradually formed Peking opera's melodies. Peking opera is generally regarded as having fully formed by 1845.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Joshua S. (2007) p.3&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is called Peking opera (Beijing theatre style), its origins are in the southern [[Anhui]] and eastern [[Hubei]], which share the same dialect of [[Xiajiang Mandarin]] (Lower Yangtze Mandarin). Peking opera's two main [[Four Great Characteristic Melodies|melodies]], ''Xipi'' and ''Erhuang'', were derived from Han Opera  after about 1750. The tune of Peking opera is extremely similar to that of Han opera, therefore Han opera is widely known as the Mother of Peking opera.&lt;ref name="XiEr"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Huang, Jinpei| title=Xipi and Erhuang of Beijing and Guangdong styles| journal=Asian Music| year=1989 | volume=20| issue=2| pages=152–195| doi=10.2307/834024 | jstor=834024 | publisher=Asian Music, Vol. 20, No. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Xipi'' literally means 'Skin Puppet Show', referring to the puppet show that originated in [[Shaanxi province]]. Chinese puppet shows always involve singing.  Much dialogue is also carried out in an archaic form of Mandarin Chinese, in which the [[Zhongyuan Mandarin]] dialects of Henan and Shaanxi are closest. This form of Mandarin is recorded in the book ''Zhongyuan Yinyun''. It also absorbed music from other operas and local ''[[Zhili Province|Zhili]]'' musical art forms. Some scholars believe that the ''Xipi'' musical form was derived from the historic [[Qinqiang]], while many conventions of staging, performance elements, and [[aesthetic]] principles were retained from [[Kunqu]], the form that preceded it as court art.&lt;ref name="XiEr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kunqu"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wtrgreenkunqu.org/Resources/Kunqu%20Description.htm|title=What is Kunqu Theatre?|accessdate=2007-04-04|publisher=Wintergreen Kunqu Society|year=2006|author=Wilson, Charles, Hans Frankel|format=Web}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Joshua S (2007) pp. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, Peking opera is not a monolithic form, but rather a coalescence of many older forms. However, the new form also creates its own innovations. The vocal requirements for all of the major roles were greatly reduced for Peking opera. The Chou, in particular, rarely has a singing part in Peking opera, unlike the equivalent role in Kunqu style. The [[melodies]] that accompany each play were also simplified, and are played with different traditional instruments than in earlier forms. Perhaps most noticeably, true acrobatic elements were introduced with Peking opera.&lt;ref name="Kunqu" /&gt; The form grew in popularity throughout the 19th century. The Anhui troupes reached their peak of excellence in the middle of the century, and were invited to perform in the court of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom that had been established during the [[Taiping Rebellion]]. Beginning in 1884, the [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] became a regular patron of Peking opera, cementing its status over earlier forms like Kunqu.&lt;ref&gt;Mackerras, Colin Patrick (1976) pp.473–501&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of Peking opera has been attributed to the simplicity of the form, with only a few voices and singing patterns. This allowed anyone to sing the arias themselves.&lt;ref name="Curtain"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Yang, Richard F. S.| title=Behind the Bamboo Curtain: What the Communists Did to the Peking opera| journal=Asian Theatre Journal| year=1969| volume=21| issue=1| pages=60–66| doi=10.2307/3205778}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Music"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Hsu, Dolores Menstell| title=Musical Elements of Chinese Opera| journal=The Musical Quarterly| year=1964| volume=50| issue=4| pages=439–451| doi=10.1093/mq/L.4.439}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:無款 清末 京劇一百人物像 冊 絹本-One hundred portraits of Peking opera characters MET DP280076.jpg|thumb|One of 100 portraits of Peking opera characters housed at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]] 
At the time of its growth in the late nineteenth century, albums became used to display aspects of stage culture, including makeup and costumes of performers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=One hundred portraits of Peking opera characters|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/51581|accessdate=November 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peking opera was initially an exclusively male pursuit. The [[Qianlong Emperor]] had banned all female performers in Beijing in 1772. The appearance of women on the stage began unofficially during the 1870s. Female performers began to impersonate male roles and declared equality with men. They were given a venue for their talents when Li Maoer, himself a former Peking-opera performer, founded the first female Peking-opera troupe in Shanghai. By 1894, the first commercial venue showcasing female performance troupes appeared in Shanghai. This encouraged other female troupes to form, which gradually increased in popularity. As a result, theatre artist Yu Zhenting petitioned for the lifting of the ban after the founding of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] in 1911. This was accepted, and the ban was lifted in 1912, although male Dan continued to be popular after this period.&lt;ref name="Own Poses"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Chou, Hui-ling| title=Striking Their Own Poses: The History of Cross-Dressing on the Chinese Stage| journal=TDR| year=1997| volume=41| issue=2| pages=130–152| doi=10.2307/1146629}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Model "revolutionary opera" and Peking opera in Taiwan===
{{Main|Revolutionary opera}}
After the [[Chinese Civil War]], Peking opera became a focal point of identity for both involved parties. When the [[Communist Party of China]] came to power in Mainland China in 1949, the newly formed government moved to bring art into line with Communist ideology, and "to make art and literature a component of the whole revolutionary machine".&lt;ref name="8 Model"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Yang, Daniel S. P.| title=Censorship: 8 Model Works| journal=The Drama Review| year=1971| volume=15| issue=2| pages=258–261| doi=10.2307/1144648 | jstor=1144648 | publisher=The Drama Review: TDR, Vol. 15, No. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; To this end, dramatic works without Communist themes were considered subversive, and were ultimately banned during the [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966–1976).&lt;ref name="Yang"&gt;Yang, Daniel S.P. (1971) pp. 259&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of opera as a tool to transmit communist ideology reached its climax in the Cultural Revolution, under the purview of [[Jiang Qing]], wife of [[Mao Zedong]]. The 'model operas' were considered one of the great achievements of the Cultural Revolution, and were meant to express Mao's view that "art must serve the interests of the workers, peasants, and soldiers and must conform to proletarian ideology."&lt;ref name="Lu Xing"&gt;{{cite book | author=Lu, Xing| title=Rhetoric of the Chinese Cultural Revolution | publisher=University of South California Press| year=2004| pages=143–150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the [[eight model plays]] eventually retained during that time were five Peking operas.&lt;ref&gt;Yang, Daniel S.P. (1971) pp. 258&lt;/ref&gt; Notable among these operas was ''[[The Legend of the Red Lantern]]'', which was approved as a concert with piano accompaniment based on a suggestion from Jiang Qing.&lt;ref&gt;Yang, Daniel S.P. (1971) pp. 261&lt;/ref&gt; Performances of works beyond the eight model plays were allowed only in heavily modified form. The endings of many traditional plays were changed, and visible stage assistants in Peking opera were eliminated.&lt;ref name="Yang" /&gt; After the end of the Cultural Revolution in the late 1970s, traditional Peking opera began to be performed again. Peking opera and other theatrical art forms were a controversial subject both before and during the Twelfth National People's Congress in 1982. A study carried in the ''[[People's Daily]]'' revealed that over 80 percent of musical dramas staged in the country were traditional plays from the pre-Communist era, as opposed to newly written historical dramas promoting socialist values. In response, Communist party officials enacted reforms to curb liberalism and foreign influence in theatrical works.&lt;ref name="Twelfth "&gt;{{cite journal | author=Mackerras, Colin| title=Drama and Politics in the China of the Twelfth Party Congress| journal=Asian Theatre Journal| year=1984| volume=1| issue=2| pages=147–165 | doi=10.2307/1124562 | jstor=1124562 | publisher=Asian Theatre Journal, Vol. 1, No. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the retreat of the [[Republic of China]] to Taiwan in 1949, Peking opera there took on a special status of "political symbolism", in which the [[Kuomintang]] government encouraged the art form over other forms of performance in an attempt to claim a position as the sole representative of Chinese culture. This often occurred at the expense of traditional [[Taiwanese opera]].&lt;ref name="Governing"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Guy, Nancy| title=Governing the Arts, Governing the State: Peking Opera and Political Authority in Taiwan| journal=Ethnomusicology| year=1999| volume=43| issue=3| pages=508–526 | doi=10.2307/852559 | jstor=852559 | publisher=Ethnomusicology, Vol. 43, No. 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crossroads"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Perng, Ching-Hsi| title=At the Crossroads: Peking Opera in Taiwan Today| journal=Asian Theatre Journal| year=1989| volume=6| issue=2| pages=124–144 | doi=10.2307/1124455 | jstor=1124455 | publisher=Asian Theatre Journal, Vol. 6, No. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its status as a prestigious art form with a long history, Peking opera has indeed been studied more and received more monetary support than other forms of theater in Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;Perng, Ching-Hsi (1989) pp. 128&lt;/ref&gt; However, there has also been a competing movement towards advocating native opera to differentiate Taiwan from the mainland. In September 1990, when the Kuomintang government participated in a state-sponsored mainland cultural event for the first time, a Taiwanese opera group was sent, possibly to emphasize "Taiwaneseness".&lt;ref name="Taiwaneseness"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Chang, Huei-Yuan Belinda| title=A Theatre of Taiwaneseness: Politics, Ideologies, and Gezaixi| journal=TDR| year=1997| volume=41| issue=2| pages=111–129| doi=10.2307/1146628 | jstor=1146628 | publisher=TDR (1988–), Vol. 41, No. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern Peking opera===
[[File:BeijingOperaProduction.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''[[Farewell My Concubine (play)|Farewell My Concubine]]'', one piece of classical Peking opera. The woman, [[Consort Yu]], deeply loved the King [[Xiang Yu]] (middle of the stage), and when he failed in a war, she committed suicide for him.]]
During the second half of the 20th century, Peking opera witnessed a steady decline in audience numbers. This has been attributed both to a decrease in performance quality and an inability of the traditional opera form to capture modern life.&lt;ref&gt;Wichmann, Elizabeth (1990) pp. 148–149&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the archaic language of Peking opera required productions to use electronic subtitles, which hampered the development of the form. The influence of Western culture has also left the younger generations impatient with the slow pacing of Peking opera.&lt;ref name="Macbeth"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Diamond, Catherine| title=Kingdom of Desire: The Three Faces of Macbeth (in Report)| journal=Asian Theatre Journal| year=1994| volume=11| issue=1| pages=114–133 | doi=10.2307/1124387 | jstor=1124387 | publisher=Asian Theatre Journal, Vol. 11, No. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Peking opera began to see reform starting in the 1980s. Such reforms have taken the form of creating a school of performance theory to increase performance quality, employing modern elements to attract new audiences, and performing new plays outside of the traditional canon. However, these reforms have been hampered by both a lack of funding and an adverse political climate that makes the performance of new plays difficult.&lt;ref name="Wichmann"&gt;Wichmann, Elizabeth (1990) pp. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to more formal reform measures, Peking-opera troupes during the 1980s also adopted more unofficial changes. Some of those seen in traditional works have been called "technique for technique's sake". This has included the use of extended high pitch sequences by female Dan, and the addition of lengthier movement sections and percussion sequences to traditional works. Such changes have generally met with disdain from Peking-opera performers, who see them as ploys to gain immediate audience appeal. Plays with repetitive sequences have also been shortened to hold audience interest.&lt;ref&gt;Wichmann, Elizabeth (1990) pp. 151&lt;/ref&gt; New works have naturally experienced a greater freedom to experiment. Regional, popular, and foreign techniques have been adopted, including Western style makeup and beards and new face paint designs for Jing characters.&lt;ref&gt;Wichmann, Elizabeth (1990) pp. 152&lt;/ref&gt; The spirit of reform continued during the 1990s. To survive in an increasingly open market, troupes like the Shanghai Peking Opera Company needed to bring traditional Peking opera to new audiences. To do this, they have offered an increasing number of free performances in public areas.&lt;ref name="Shanghai Reform"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Wichmann-Walczak, Elizabeth| title="Reform" at the Shanghai Beijing Opera Company and Its Impact on Creative Authority and Repertory| journal=TDR| year=2000| volume=44| issue=4| pages=96–119| doi=10.1162/10542040051058500}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has also been a general feeling of a shift in the creative attribution of Peking-opera works. The performer has traditionally played a large role in the scripting and staging of Peking-opera works. However, perhaps following the lead of the West, Peking opera in recent decades has shifted to a more director and playwright centered model. Performers have striven to introduce innovation in their work while heeding the call for reform from this new upper level of Peking-opera producers.&lt;ref name="Xiqu Research"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Wichmann, Elizabeth| title=Xiqu Research and Translation with the Artists in Mind (in Symposium: What More Do We Need to Know about Chinese Theatre?)| journal=Asian Theatre Journal| year=1994| volume=11| issue=1| pages=96–119 | doi=10.2307/1124385 | jstor=1124385 | publisher=Asian Theatre Journal, Vol. 11, No. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Channel [[CCTV-11]] in Mainland China is currently dedicated to broadcasting classic Chinese opera productions, including Peking opera.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Joshua S. (2007) pp. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peking opera around the world===
In addition to its presence in China, Peking opera has spread to many other places. It can be found in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and overseas Chinese communities elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Rhetoric"&gt;{{cite book | first=D.

[[Mei Lanfang]], one of the most famous Dan performers of all time, was also one of the greatest popularizers of Peking opera abroad. During the 1920s, he performed Peking opera in Japan. This inspired an American tour in February 1930. Although some, such as the actor [[Otis Skinner]], believed that Peking opera could never be a success in the United States, the favorable reception of Mei and his troupe in New York City disproved this notion. The performances had to be relocated from the 49th Street Theater to the larger National Theater, and the duration of the tour extended from two weeks to five.&lt;ref&gt;Rao, Nancy Yunhwa (2000) pp. 135–138&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1930 Tour"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Brokering Glory for the Chinese Nation: Peking Opera's 1930 American Tour|journal=Comparative Drama|year=2001|first=Nancy|last=Guy|volume=35|issue=|pages= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mei traveled across the United States, receiving honorary degrees from the [[University of California]] and [[Pomona College]]. He followed this tour with a tour in the [[Soviet Union]] in 1935.&lt;ref name="Lanfang Case Model"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Banu, Georges, Ella L. Wiswell, June V.

The theatre department at the [[University of Hawaii at Mānoa]] has been home to English language Jingju for more than twenty-five years. The school offers Asian Theatre as a major and has regular Jingju performances, the most recent being ''Lady Mu and the Yang Family Generals'' in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/news/article.php?aId=3322|title=Mānoa: English-language world premiere of Jingju (Beijing "Opera") play - University of Hawaii News|website=www.hawaii.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training==
{{main|Peking Opera School}}
Becoming a Peking opera performer requires a long and arduous apprenticeship beginning from an early age.&lt;ref name="training interview"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Chang, Donald, John D. Mitchell, Roger Yeu| title=How the Chinese Actor Trains: Interviews with Two Peking Opera Performers (in Asian Theatre Traditions)| journal=Educational Theatre Journal| year=1974| volume=26| issue=2| pages=183–191 | doi=10.2307/3206634 | jstor=3206634 | publisher=Educational Theatre Journal, Vol. 26, No. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the 20th century, pupils were often handpicked at a young age by a teacher and trained for seven years on contract from the child's parents. Since the teacher fully provided for the pupil during this period, the student accrued a debt to his master that was later repaid through performance earnings. After 1911, training took place in more formally organized schools. Students at these schools rose as early as five o'clock in the morning for exercises. Daytime was spent learning the skills of acting and combat, and senior students performed in outside theatres in the evening. If they made any mistakes during such performances, the entire group was beaten with bamboo canes. Schools with less harsh training methods began to appear in 1930, but all schools were closed down in 1931 after the Japanese invasion. New schools were not opened until 1952.&lt;ref name="Halson"&gt;{{cite book | title=Peking Opera: A Short Guide| last=Halson| first=Elizabeth| year=1966| pages=8| publisher=Oxford University Press| location=Hong Kong}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Performers are first trained in acrobatics, followed by singing and gestures. Several performing schools, all based on the styles of famous performers, are taught. Some examples are the [[Mei Lanfang]] school, the [[Cheng Yanqiu]] school, the Ma Lianliang school, and the Qi Lintong school.&lt;ref name="Performing Arts in China Review"&gt;{{cite journal | author=F. S. Yang, Richard| title=The Performing Arts in Contemporary China (in Book Reviews)| journal=Asian Theatre Journal| year=1984| volume=1| issue=2| pages=230–234 | doi=10.2307/1124569 | jstor=1124569 | publisher=Asian Theatre Journal, Vol. 1, No. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students previously trained exclusively in the art of performance, but modern performance schools now include academic studies as well. Teachers assess the qualifications of each student and assign them roles as primary, secondary, or tertiary characters accordingly. Students with little acting talent often become Peking-opera musicians.&lt;ref&gt;Chang, Donald (1974) pp. 183–191&lt;/ref&gt; They may also serve as the supporting cast of foot soldiers, attendants, and servants that is present in every Peking-opera troupe.&lt;ref name="Wichmann_2"&gt;Wichmann, Elizabeth (1991) p.12&lt;/ref&gt; In Taiwan, the [[Ministry of National Defense of the Republic of China]] runs a national Peking-opera training school.&lt;ref&gt;Perng, Ching-Hsi (1989) pp. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visual performance elements==

Peking-opera performers use four main skills. The first two are song and speech. The third is dance-acting. This includes pure dance, pantomime, and all other types of dance. The final skill is combat, which includes both acrobatics and fighting with all manner of weaponry. All of these skills are expected to be performed effortlessly, in keeping with the spirit of the art form.&lt;ref name="Wichmann_3"&gt;Wichmann, Elizabeth (1991) p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aesthetic aims and principles of movement===
Peking opera follows other traditional Chinese arts in emphasizing meaning, rather than accuracy. The highest aim of performers is to put beauty into every motion. Indeed, performers are strictly criticized for lacking beauty during training.&lt;ref name="Wichmann_3" /&gt; Additionally, performers are taught to create a synthesis between the different aspects of Peking opera. The four skills of Peking opera are not separate, but rather should be combined in a single performance. One skill may take precedence at certain moments during a play, but this does not mean that other actions should cease.&lt;ref&gt;Wichmann, Elizabeth (1991) p.3–4&lt;/ref&gt; Much attention is paid to tradition in the art form, and gestures, settings, music, and character types are determined by long held convention. This includes conventions of movement, which are used to signal particular actions to the audience. For example, walking in a large circle always symbolizes traveling a long distance, and a character straightening his or her costume and headdress symbolizes that an important character is about to speak. Some conventions, such as the pantomimic opening and closing of doors and mounting and descending of stairs, are more readily apparent.&lt;ref name="Wichmann_4"&gt;Wichmann, Elizabeth (1991) p.6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aesthetics"&gt;{{cite book | first=Elizabeth | last=Wichmann-Walczak |author2=editor Corinne H. Dale | title=in Chinese Aesthetics and Literature: A Reader | year=2004 | publisher=SUNY Press | work = | pages =129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many performances deal with behaviors that occur in daily life. However, in accordance with the overriding principle of beauty, such behaviors are stylized to be presented on stage. Peking opera does not aim to accurately represent reality. Experts of the art form contrast the principles of Peking opera with the principle of ''Mo'', mimes or imitation, that is found in western dramas. Peking opera should be suggestive, not imitative. The literal aspects of scenes are removed or stylized to better represent intangible emotions and characters.&lt;ref name="Mo"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Chen, Jingsong| title=To Make People Happy, Drama Imitates Joy: The Chinese Theatrical Concept of Mo| journal=Asian Theatre Journal| year=1997| volume=14| issue=1| pages=38–55 | doi=10.2307/1124084 | jstor=1124084 | publisher=Asian Theatre Journal, Vol. 14, No. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common stylization method in Peking opera is roundness. Every motion and pose is carefully manipulated to avoid sharp angles and straight lines. A character looking upon an object above them will sweep their eyes in a circular motion from low to high before landing on the object. Similarly, a character will sweep their hand in an arc from left to right in order to indicate an object on the right. This avoidance of sharp angles extends to three-dimensional movement as well; reversals of orientation often take the form of a smooth, S-shaped curve.&lt;ref&gt;Wichmann, Elizabeth (1991) p.4–5&lt;/ref&gt; All of these general principles of aesthetics are present within other performance elements as well.

===Staging and costumes===
[[File:Beijng-Opera1.jpg|thumb|left|A scene from Peking opera]]

Peking opera stages have traditionally been square platforms. The action on stage is usually visible from at least three sides. The stage is divided into two parts by an embroidered curtain called a ''shoujiu''. Musicians are visible to the audience on the front part of the stage.&lt;ref name="tyfo"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://china.tyfo.com/int/ent/opera/peking/peking-index.htm|title=Peking Opera|year=2000|publisher=It's China Network - TYFO.COM|author=Unknown Author|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607182457/http://china.tyfo.com/int/ent/opera/peking/peking-index.htm|archivedate=June 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional Peking opera stages were built above the line of sight of the viewers, but some modern stages have been constructed with higher audience seating. Viewers are always seated south of the stage. Therefore, north is the most important direction in Peking opera, and performers will immediately move to "center north" upon entering the stage. All characters enter from the east and exit from the west.&lt;ref name="Afternoon Tea"&gt;{{cite book | title=Afternoon Tea at the Beijing Opera| url=https://books.google.com/?id=EO7LgHBYmHcC&amp;dq=%22Beijing+opera%22+AND+%22repertoire%22| last=Chengbei| first=Xu| year=2006| pages=163| publisher=Long River Press | isbn=978-1-59265-057-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In line with the highly symbolic nature of Peking opera, the form uses very few props. This reflects seven centuries of Chinese performance tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Perng, Ching-Hsi (1989) pp. 135&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of large objects is frequently indicated through conventions. The stage will almost always have a table and at least one chair, which can be turned through convention into such diverse objects as a city wall, a mountain, or a bed. Peripheral objects will often be used to signify the presence of a larger, main object. For example, a whip is used to indicate a horse and an oar symbolizes a boat.&lt;ref name="Wichmann_4" /&gt;

The length and internal structure of Peking-opera plays is highly variable. Prior to 1949, ''zhezixi'', short plays or plays made up of short scenes from longer plays, were often performed. These plays usually center on one simple situation or feature a selection of scenes designed to include all four of the main Peking opera skills and showcase the virtuosity of the performers. This format has become less prevalent in recent times, but plays of one act are still performed. These short works, as well as individual scenes within longer works, are marked by an emotional progression from the beginning of the play to the end. For example, the concubine in the one act play ''The Favorite Concubine Becomes Intoxicated'' begins in a state of joy, and then moves to anger and jealousy, drunken playfulness, and finally to a feeling of defeat and resignation. A full-length play usually has from six to fifteen or more scenes. The overall story in these longer works is told through contrasting scenes. Plays will alternate between civil and martial scenes, or scenes involve protagonists and antagonists. There are several major scenes within the work that follow the pattern of emotional progression. It is these scenes that are usually excerpted for later ''zhezixi'' productions. Some of the most complex plays may even have an emotional progression from scene to scene.&lt;ref&gt;Wichmann, Elizabeth (1991) p.18–21&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the scarcity of props in Peking opera, costumes take on added importance. Costumes function first to distinguish the rank of the character being played. Emperors and their families wear yellow robes, and high-ranking officials wear purple. The robe worn by these two classes is called a ''mang'', or python robe. It is a costume suitable for the high rank of the character, featuring brilliant colors and rich embroidery, often in the design of a dragon. Persons of high rank or virtue wear red, lower-ranking officials wear blue, young characters wear white, the old wear white, brown, or olive, and all other men wear black. On formal occasions, lower officials may wear the ''kuan yi'', a simple gown with patches of embroidery on both the front and back. All other characters, and officials on informal occasions, wear the ''chezi'', a basic gown with varying levels of embroidery and no jade girdle to denote rank. All three types of gowns have water sleeves, long flowing sleeves that can be flicked and waved like water, attached to facilitate emotive gestures. Tertiary characters of no rank wear simple clothing without embroidery. Hats are intended to blend in with the rest of the costume and will usually have a matching level of embroidery. Shoes may be high or low soled, the former being worn by characters of high rank, and the latter by characters of low rank or acrobatic characters.&lt;ref&gt;Halson, Elizabeth (1966) p.19–38&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stage properties (Qimo)===
[[file:Beijing opera02.jpg|200px|thumb|right|An actor can act out the scene of galloping the horse simply by using a horsewhip without riding a real horse on stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.travelchinaguide.com/intro/arts/beijing_opera/|title=Beijing/Peking Opera: History, Roles, Facial Painting, Artists|website=www.travelchinaguide.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Qimo (stage props) is the name for all stage properties and some simple decorations. The term first occurred in the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)]]. Qimo includes articles of everyday life such as candlesticks, lanterns, fans, handkerchiefs, brushes, paper, ink and ink slabs, and tea and wine sets. The props also include: sedan chairs, vehicle flags, oars, and horsewhips, as well as weapons. Also employed are various articles to demonstrate environments, such as cloth backdrops to represent cities, and curtains, flags, table curtains, and chair covers. Traditional qimo are not just imitations of real articles, but also artistic articles in their own right.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Stage Props in Peking Opera {{cite web |url=http://arts.cultural-china.com/en/87Arts4904.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-04-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170419103944/http://arts.cultural-china.com/en/87Arts4904.html |archivedate=2017-04-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Flags are also frequently used on the stage. A square flag with the Chinese character for "marshal" on it, a rectangular flag with the Chinese character for "commander" on it, and a flag with the name of a certain army on it represent the location of army camps and commanders-in-chief. In addition, there are water, fire, wind, and vehicle flags. Actors shake these flags to represent waves, fire, wind, or moving vehicles.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Aural performance elements==

===Vocal production===

Vocal production in Peking opera is conceived of as being composed of "four levels of song": songs with music, verse recitation, prose dialogue, and non-verbal vocalizations. The conception of a sliding scale of vocalization creates a sense of smooth continuity between songs and speech.  The three basic categories of vocal production technique are the use of breath (''yongqi''), pronunciation (''fayin''), and special Peking-opera pronunciation (''shangkouzi'').&lt;ref name="Wichmann, Elizabeth 1991"&gt;Wichmann, Elizabeth (1991), 177–178.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Chinese opera, breath is based in the pubic region and supported by the abdominal muscles. Performers follow the basic principle that "Strong centralized breath moves the melodic-passages" (''zhong qi xing xiang''). Breath is visualized being drawn up through a central breathing cavity extending from the pubic region to the top of the head. This "cavity" must be under the performer's control at all times, and he or she develops special techniques to control both entering and exiting air. The two major methods of taking in breath are known as "exchanging breath" (''huan qi'') and "stealing breath" (''tou qi''). "Exchanging breath" is a slow, unhurried process of breathing out old air and taking in new. It is used at moments when the performer is not under time constraint, such as during a purely instrumental musical passage or when another character is speaking. "Stealing breath" is a sharp intake of air without prior exhalation, and is used during long passages of prose or song when a pause would be undesirable. Both techniques should be invisible to the audience and take in only the precise amount of air required for the intended vocalization. The most important principle in exhalation is "saving the breath" (''cun qi''). Breath should not be expended all at once at the beginning of a spoken or sung passage, but rather expelled slowly and evenly over its length. Most songs and some prose contain precise written intervals for when breath should be "exchanged" or "stolen". These intervals are often marked by carats.&lt;ref&gt;Wichmann, Elizabeth (1991), 178–180.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pronunciation is conceptualized as shaping the throat and mouth into the shape necessary to produce the desired vowel sound, and clearly articulating the initial consonant. There are four basic shapes for the throat and mouth, corresponding to four vowel types, and five methods of articulating consonants, one for each type of consonant. The four throat and mouth shapes are "opened-mouth" (''kaikou''), "level-teeth" (''qichi''), "closed-mouth" (''hekou'' or ''huokou''), and "scooped-lips" (''cuochun''). The five consonant types are denoted by the portion of the mouth most critical to each type's production: throat, or larynx (''hou''); tongue (''she''); molars, or the jaws and palate (''chi''); front teeth (''ya''); and lips (''chun'').&lt;ref&gt;Wichmann, Elizabeth (1991), 184–185.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some syllables (written [[Chinese characters]]) have special pronunciations in Peking opera. This is due to the collaboration with regional forms and [[kunqu]] that occurred during the development of Peking opera. For example, 你, meaning "you", may be pronounced ''li'', as it is in the Anhui dialect, rather than the Standard Chinese ''ni''. 我, meaning "I" and pronounced ''wo'' in Standard Chinese, becomes ''ngo'', as it is pronounced in the dialect of [[Suzhou]]. In addition to pronunciation differences that are due to the influence of regional forms, the readings of some characters have been changed to promote ease of performance or vocal variety. For example, ''zhi'', ''chi'', ''shi'', and ''ri'' sounds do not carry well and are difficult to sustain, because they are produced far back in the mouth. Therefore, they are performed with an additional ''i'' sound, as in ''zhii''.&lt;ref&gt;Wichmann, Elizabeth (1991), 188–190.&lt;/ref&gt;

These techniques and conventions of vocal production are used to create the two main categories of vocalizations in Peking opera: stage speech and song.

===Stage speech===

Peking opera is performed using both [[Classical Chinese]] and [[Modern Standard Chinese]] with some slang terms added for color. The social position of the character being played determines the type of language that he or she uses. Peking opera features three major types of stage speech (''nianbai''). Monologues and dialogue, which make up the majority of most plays, consist of prose speeches. The purpose of prose speech is to advance the plot of the play or inject humor into a scene. They are usually short, and are performed mostly using vernacular language.  However, as Elizabeth Wichmann points out, they also have rhythmic and musical elements, achieved through the "stylized articulation of monosyllabic sound units" and the "stylized pronunciation of speech-tones", respectively.  Prose speeches were frequently improvised during the early period of Peking opera's development, and ''chou'' performers carry on that tradition today.&lt;ref&gt;Wichmann, Elizabeth (1991), 25, 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second main type of stage speech consists of quotations drawn from classical Chinese poetry. This type is rarely used in Peking opera; plays have one or two such quotations at most, and often none at all. In most instances, the use of classical poetry is intended to heighten the impact of a scene.  However, ''Chou'' and more whimsical ''Dan'' characters may misquote or misinterpret the classical lines, creating a comical effect.&lt;ref&gt;Wichmann, Elizabeth (1991), 47–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

The final category of stage speech is conventionalized stage speeches (''chengshi nianbai''). These are rigid formulations that mark important transition points. When a character enters for the first time, an "entrance speech" (''shangchang'') or "self-introduction speech" (''zi bao jiamen'') is given, which includes a prelude poem, a set-the-scene poem, and a prose set-the-scene speech, in that order. The style and structure of each entrance speech is inherited from earlier [[Yuan Dynasty]], [[Ming Dynasty]], folk, and regional forms of Chinese opera.  Another conventionalized stage speech is the exit speech, which may take the form of a poem followed by a single spoken line. This speech is usually delivered by a supporting character, and describes his or her present situation and state of mind.  Finally, there is the recapitulation speech, in which a character will use prose to recount the story up to that point. These speeches came about as a result of the ''zhezixi'' tradition of performing only one part of a larger play.&lt;ref&gt;Wichmann, Elizabeth (1991), 48–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Song===

There are six main types of song lyrics in Peking opera: emotive, condemnatory, narrative, descriptive, disputive, and "shared space separate sensations" lyrics. Each type uses the same basic lyrical structure, differing only in kind and degree of emotions portrayed. Lyrics are written in couplets (''lian'') consisting of two lines (''ju''). Couplets can consist of two ten character lines, or two seven character lines. The lines are further subdivided into three ''dou'' (lit. "pause"), typically in a 3-3-4 or 2-2-3 pattern. Lines may be "padded" with extra characters for the purpose of clarifying meaning. Rhyme is an extremely important device in Peking opera, with thirteen identified rhyme categories.  Song lyrics also use the speech tones of Mandarin Chinese in ways that are pleasing to the ear and convey proper meaning and emotion. The first and second of Chinese's four tones are normally known as "level" (''ping'') tones in Peking opera, while the third and fourth are called "oblique" (''ze''). The closing line of every couplet in a song ends in a level tone.&lt;ref&gt;Wichmann, Elizabeth (1991), 27–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Songs in Peking opera are proscribed by a set of common aesthetic values. A majority of songs are within a pitch range of an octave and a fifth. High pitch is a positive aesthetic value, so a performer will pitch songs at the very top of his or her vocal range.  For this reason, the idea of a song's key has value in Peking opera only as a technical tool for the performer. Different performers in the same performance may sing in different keys, requiring the accompanying musicians to constantly retune their instruments or switch out with other players. Elizabeth Wichmann describes the ideal basic timbre for Peking opera songs as a "controlled nasal tone". Performers make extensive use of vocal vibrato during songs, in a way that is "slower" and "wider" than vibrato used in Western performances. The Peking opera aesthetic for songs is summed up by the expression ''zi zheng qiang yuan'', meaning that the written characters should be delivered accurately and precisely, and the melodic passages should be weaving, or "round".&lt;ref name="Wichmann, Elizabeth 1991" /&gt;

===Music===
[[File:Jinghu (1).jpg|thumb|The ''[[Jinghu (instrument)|jinghu]]'', an instrument commonly used in Peking-opera music]]

The accompaniment for a Peking opera performance usually consists of a small ensemble of traditional melodic and percussion instruments. The lead melodic instrument is the ''[[Jinghu (instrument)|jinghu]]'', a small, high-pitched, two-string spike fiddle.&lt;ref name="Hsu, Dolores Menstell 1964 pp.447"&gt;Hsu, Dolores Menstell (1964) pp.447&lt;/ref&gt; The ''jinghu'' is the primary accompaniment for performers during songs. Accompaniment is heterophonic – the ''jinghu'' player follows the basic contours of the song's melody, but diverges in pitch and other elements. The ''jinghu'' often plays more notes per measure than the performer sings, and does so an octave lower. During rehearsal, the ''jinghu'' player adopts his or her own signature version of the song's melody, but also must adapt to spontaneous improvisations on the part of the performer due to changed performance conditions. Thus, the ''jinghu'' player must have an instinctive ability to change his or her performance without warning to properly accompany the performer.&lt;ref&gt;Wichmann, Elizabeth (1991), 244–246.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second is the circular bodied plucked lute, the ''[[yueqin]]''. Percussion instruments include the ''daluo'', ''xiaoluo'', and ''naobo''. The player of the ''gu'' and ''ban'', a small high pitch drum and clapper, is the conductor of the entire ensemble.&lt;ref&gt;Hsu, Dolores Menstell (1964) pp.451&lt;/ref&gt; The two main musical styles of Peking opera, ''Xipi'' and ''Erhuang'', originally differed in subtle ways. In the ''Xipi'' style, the strings of the jinghu are tuned to the keys of A and D. The melodies in this style are very disjointed, possibly reflecting the style's derivation from the high and loud melodies of the Qinqiang opera of northwestern China. It is commonly used to tell joyous stories. In ''Erhuang'', on the other hand, the strings are tuned to the keys of C and G. This reflects the low, soft, and despondent folk tunes of south-central [[Hubei]] province, the style's place of origin. As a result, it is used for lyrical stories. Both musical styles have a standard meter of two beats per bar. The two musical styles share six different tempos, including ''manban'' (a slow tempo), ''yuanban'' (a standard, medium-fast tempo), ''kuai sanyan'' ("leading beat"), ''daoban'' ("leading beat"), ''sanban'' ("rubato beat"), and ''yaoban'' ("shaking beat"). The ''xipi'' style also uses several unique tempos, including ''erliu'' ("two-six"), and ''kuaiban'' (a fast tempo). Of these tempos, ''yuanban'', ''manban'', and ''kuaiban'' are most commonly seen. The tempo at any given time is controlled by a percussion player who acts as director.&lt;ref&gt;Huang, Jinpei (1989) pp.154–155&lt;/ref&gt; ''Erhuang'' has been seen as more improvisational, and ''Xipi'' as more tranquil. The lack of defined standards among performance troupes and the passage of time may have made the two styles more similar to each other today.&lt;ref name="Hsu, Dolores Menstell 1964 pp.447" /&gt;

The melodies played by the accompaniment mainly fall into three broad categories. The first is the aria. The arias of Peking opera can be further divided into those of the ''Erhuang'' and ''Xipi'' varieties. An example of an aria is ''wawa diao'', an aria in the ''Xipi'' style that is sung by a young Sheng to indicate heightened emotion.&lt;ref&gt;Guy, Nancy A. (1990) pp. 254–259&lt;/ref&gt; The second type of melody heard in Peking opera is the fixed-tune melody, or ''qupai''. These are instrumental tunes that serve a wider range of purposes than arias. Examples include the "Water Dragon Tune" (''shui long yin''), which generally denotes the arrival of an important person, and "Triple Thrust" (''ji san qiang''), which may signal a feast or banquet.&lt;ref name="Guy"&gt;Guy, Nancy A. (1990) pp.256&lt;/ref&gt; The final type of musical accompaniment is the percussion pattern. Such patterns provide context to the music in ways similar to the fixed-tune melodies. For example, there are as many as 48 different percussion patterns that accompany stage entrances. Each one identifies the entering character by his or her individual rank and personality.&lt;ref name="Guy" /&gt;

The repertoire of Peking opera includes nearly 1,400 works. The plays are mostly taken from historical novels or traditional stories about civil, political and military struggles. Early plays were often adaptations from earlier Chinese theatre styles, such as ''kunqu.'' Nearly half of 272 plays listed in 1824 were derived from earlier styles.&lt;ref name="Wichmann_2" /&gt; Many classification systems have been used to sort the plays. Two traditional methods have existed since Peking opera first appeared in China. The oldest and most generally used system is to sort plays into civil and martial types. Civil plays focus on the relationships between characters, and feature personal, domestic, and romantic situations. The element of singing is frequently used to express emotion in this type of play. Martial plays feature a greater emphasis on action and combat skill. The two types of play also feature different arrays of performers. Martial plays predominantly feature young sheng, jing, and chou, while civil plays have a greater need for older roles and dan. In addition to being civil or martial, plays are also classified as either ''daxi'' (serious) or ''xiaoxi'' (light). The performance elements and performers used in serious and light plays greatly resemble those used in martial and civil plays, respectively. Of course, the aesthetic principle of synthesis frequently leads to the use of these contrasting elements in combination, yielding plays that defy such dichotomous classification.&lt;ref&gt;Wichmann, Elizabeth (1991) p.15–16&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1949, a more detailed classification system has been put into use based on thematic content and the historical period of a play's creation. The first category in this system is ''chuantongxi'', traditional plays that were in performance before 1949. The second category is ''xinbian de lishixi'', historical plays written after 1949. This type of play was not produced at all during the Cultural Revolution, but is a major focus today. The final category is ''xiandaixi'', contemporary plays. The subject matter of these plays is taken from the 20th century and beyond. Contemporary productions are also frequently experimental in nature, and may incorporate Western influences.&lt;ref&gt;Wichmann, Elizabeth (1991) p.14–15&lt;/ref&gt; In the second half of the 20th century, Western works have increasingly been adapted for Peking opera. The works of [[Shakespeare]] have been especially popular.&lt;ref name="Shakespeare"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Fei, Chunfang Faye, William Huizhu Sun| title=Othello and Beijing Opera: Appropriation As a Two-Way Street| journal=The Drama Review| year=2006| volume=50| issue=1| doi= 10.1162/dram.2006.50.1.120| pages=120–133}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement to adapt Shakespeare to the stage has encompassed all forms of Chinese theatre.&lt;ref name="Shakespeare other forms"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Zha Peide |author2=Tian Jia | title=Shakespeare in Traditional Chinese Operas (in Shakespeare in China)| journal=Shakespeare Quarterly| year=1988| volume=39| issue=2| pages=204–211 | doi=10.2307/2870631 | jstor=2870631 | publisher=Shakespeare Quarterly, Vol. 39, No. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peking opera in particular has seen versions of ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' and ''[[King Lear]]'', among others.&lt;ref name="Shakespeare Beijing opera"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Brockbank, J.

==Film==
Peking opera and its stylistic devices have appeared in many Chinese films.  It often was used to signify a unique "Chineseness" in contrast to sense of culture being presented in Japanese films.  [[Fei Mu]], a director of the pre-Communist era, used Peking opera in a number of plays, sometimes within "Westernized", realistic plots.  [[King Hu]], a later Chinese film director, used many of the formal norms of Peking opera in his films, such as the parallelism between music, voice, and gesture.&lt;ref name="Hu"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Questions of Chinese Aesthetics: Film Form and Narrative Space in the Cinema of King Hu|journal=Cinema Journal|date=Autumn 1998|first=Héctor|last=Rodríguez|volume=38|issue=1|pages=73–97 |doi=10.2307/1225736|publisher=Cinema Journal, Vol. 38, No. 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1993 film ''[[Farewell My Concubine (film)|Farewell My Concubine]]'', by [[Chen Kaige]], Peking opera serves as the object of pursuit for the protagonists and a backdrop for their romance.  However, the film's portrayal of Peking opera has been criticized as one-dimensional.&lt;ref name="Kwok"&gt;{{cite journal|title="Farewell My Concubine": History, Melodrama, and Ideology in Contemporary Pan-Chinese Cinema|journal=Film Quarterly|date=Autumn 1995|first=Jenny|last=Kwok Wah Lau|volume=49|issue=1|pages=22–23 |jstor=1213489|doi=10.1525/fq.1995.49.1.04a00030}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chen returned to the subject again in 2008 with the [[Mei Lanfang]] biopic ''[[Forever Enthralled]]''.  Peking opera is also featured in ''[[Peking Opera Blues]]'' by [[Tsui Hark]].

A Western film that thematized Peking opera was the 1993 film ''[[M. Butterfly (film)|M. Butterfly]]'' by [[David Cronenberg]] with [[Jeremy Irons]] and [[John Lone]], based on a [[M. Butterfly|play of the same name]] by [[David Henry Hwang]], which was itself based of the real-life relationship between French diplomat [[Bernard Boursicot]] and Peking opera singer [[Shi Pei Pu]]. This story of love and espionage focuses especially on the fact that in traditional Peking operas, all female roles were played by men.

==Peking-opera houses in Beijing==
Fundamental to the performance and overall ambience of traditional Peking opera is the venue. There are many restored venues in Beijing dating from the late 17th century onwards, the opera stage at [[Prince Gong Mansion]], [[Zheng Yici Peking Opera Theatre|Zhengyici-xi-lou]] and [[Huguang Guild Hall]], being among them. However, modern venues for the general operatic and theatre stage are also common, such as the [[National Centre for the Performing Arts (China)|National Centre for the Performing Arts]], and the [[Chang'an Grand Theatre]] located on the East Chang'an Avenue is an example of modern Peking opera theatre.

Signed into effect on 12 June 2002, the '''Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act''', (PHSBPRA) was signed by the President, the Department of Health and Human Services ([[DHHS]]) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture ([[USDA]]).

It established procedures for preparation for bioterrorism and public health emergencies. It also created the [[National Disaster Medical System]], through which teams of health professionals, such as physicians, pharmacists, paramedics, and nurses, volunteer in emergency situations.

A component of the new rules include security risk assessment of individuals who have access to the [[select agents and toxins]]. It is intended to establish new requirements for registration of possession, use, and transfer of select agents and toxins that could pose a threat to human, animal, and plant safety and health. Any person who meets the criteria of a "restricted person" as defined in the USA [[PATRIOT Act]] of 2001, must not be afforded access to these materials.

The '''Charter of Quebec Values''' ({{Lang-fr| Charte de la laïcité or Charte des valeurs québécoises}}) was [[Bill (proposed law)|Bill]] 60 in the [[Canada|Canadian]] province of [[Quebec]], introduced by the governing [[Parti Québécois]] in 2013 under Premier [[Pauline Marois]], trying to legislate the Quebec controversy on [[reasonable accommodation]].  The PQ cabinet member forwarding the bill was [[Bernard Drainville]], Minister responsible for Democratic Institutions and Active Citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.assnat.qc.ca/en/deputes/drainville-bernard-209/biographie.html&lt;/ref&gt; Premier Marois also threatened invoking the notwithstanding clause of the Constitution of Canada to pass the Charter in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/the-political-strategy-behind-quebec-s-values-charter-1.2418405&lt;/ref&gt;  There was much controversy in Quebec and elsewhere about the charter, especially its proposed prohibition of [[public sector]] employees from wearing or displaying conspicuous religious symbols.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/is-quebecs-secular-charter-constitutional-nine-legal-experts-weigh-in/article14324825/&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposal would have included the following provisions:
* Amend the [[Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms]]
* Establish a duty of neutrality and reserve for all state personnel (including state-funded education and health care workers).
* Limit the wearing of conspicuous [[religious symbol]]s for said personnel.
* Make it mandatory to have one's face uncovered when providing or receiving a state service.
* Establish an implementation policy for state organizations.

The PQ had a minority government; Marois called an early election to obtain a greater vote of confidence.&lt;ref&gt;http://theconversation.com/new-premier-same-old-story-quebecs-longtime-anti-niqab-efforts-104472&lt;/ref&gt; The bill died as of the [[Quebec general election, 2014|2014 election]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/editorials/couillard-should-bury-the-charter-of-values/article18061611/&lt;/ref&gt; which was won by the [[Quebec Liberal Party]]. The Charter of Quebec Values was argued to be a contributing factor in the PQ’s loss of power (although the bill was polled with higher public opinion support than the governing party itself).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2014/09/18/barbara-kay-values-return-to-quebec-in-more-sensible-liberal-version/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=September 19, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140918213440/http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2014/09/18/barbara-kay-values-return-to-quebec-in-more-sensible-liberal-version/ |archivedate=September 18, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Liberals were opposed to the legislation, but party leader [[Philippe Couillard]] pledged during the campaign to put forward a less strict set of measures on the reasonable accommodation issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/quebec-liberals-won-without-too-much-effort-legault-says-1.1765991 "Quebec Liberals won 'without too much effort', Legault says"]. [[CTV News]], April 8, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chronology ==
{{Expand section|date=October 2013}}
The proposal was first announced on May 22, 2013.
The Charter was officially proposed on September 10, 2013.
The bill died on the order paper as of March 5, 2014.

== Symbols ==
[[File:Non à la charte.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|&lt;center&gt;Protest&lt;br /&gt;Saturday, September 14, 2013 in [[Montreal]]&lt;/center&gt;]]
The most controversial of all provisions seems to be about the restriction of the [[public sector]] employees from wearing or displaying conspicuous religious symbols.

According to the bill, relatively discreet items such as a [[finger ring]], [[earring]], or small [[pendant]]s bearing a religious symbol will be allowed, while more obvious items such as a [[kippah]], [[turban]], [[hijab]], [[niqāb]], and larger crosses and religious pendants would be prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Charter of Quebec values would ban religious symbols for public workers|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/charter-of-quebec-values-would-ban-religious-symbols-for-public-workers-1.1699315|accessdate=17 September 2013|newspaper=CBC News|date=10 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elected politicians would be exempt and temporary opt-out provisions have been proposed for [[universities]] and [[hospitals]]. Furthermore, certain items and customs with an ostensibly religious nature, such as the large [[crucifix]] on display in the [[Quebec National Assembly]], and observing [[Christmas]] are exempt on the rationale of them reflecting the province's cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Strapagiel|first=Lauren|title=Quebec Charter of Values: your FAQ guide to a secular public service|url=http://o.canada.com/2013/09/10/quebec-charter-of-values-faq/|publisher=O canada.com|accessdate=17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to the widespread belief that this measure is motivated by an act of ethnocentric [[hypocrisy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Quebec teachers' group calls Charter of Values extremist |url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/quebec-teachers-group-calls-charter-of-values-extremist-1.1440603|accessdate=18 September 2013|newspaper=CTV News|date=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions against ==
The charter was popular in the beginning, but constant attacks reduced the support occasionally to 50% of the population.

===Quebec political parties===
In Quebec itself, the provincial [[Official Opposition]], the [[Quebec Liberal Party]], enjoying an increase in support since the announcement of this Charter, declared that it would oppose passing this bill to the point of triggering an election over the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Edmiston|first=Jake|title=Quebec Liberals jump to 7% lead over PQ as backlash grows over values charter|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/09/15/quebec-liberals-jump-to-7-lead-over-pq-as-backlash-grows-over-quebec-values-charter/|accessdate=17 September 2013|newspaper=National Post|date=15 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Coalition Avenir Québec]] leader [[François Legault]] proposed a compromise with a more limited ban with health care workers and daycare workers exempted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CAQ proposes values charter compromise|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/caq-proposes-values-charter-compromise-1.1858266|accessdate=18 September 2013|newspaper=CBC News|date=17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former PQ premier [[Jacques Parizeau]] did not feel the end of the bill justified its means.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/Macpherson+Does+Pauline+Marois+have+guiding+principles/9627130/story.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=March 18, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140318225344/http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/Macpherson+Does+Pauline+Marois+have+guiding+principles/9627130/story.html |archivedate=March 18, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2016/09/10/pqs-disastrous-charter-of-values-misadventure-holds-lessons-for-the-conservatives-hbert.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federal political parties===
The reaction to this bill has been divisive with most of the major Federal political parties denouncing this proposal. For instance, [[Justin Trudeau]] of the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] described this measure as a cynical [[wedge issue]] designed to foment conflict with the [[Federal Government of Canada]] to promote [[Quebec separatism]] when it is challenged in the courts as [[unconstitutional]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Charter of Quebec values would ban religious symbols for public workers|newspaper=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Thomas Mulcair]] of the [[New Democratic Party of Canada]] declared it unacceptable, deriding it while speaking to the press as "state-sponsored [[discrimination]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NDP’s Mulcair denounces Quebec charter|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/831100/ndps-mulcair-denounces-quebec-charter/|accessdate=17 September 2013|newspaper=The Canadian Press|date=10 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] noted that the bill will likely not become law, but will take whatever action necessary in the event that it does.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mas|first=Susana|title=Quebec's charter of values will fail, PM Harper predicts|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/quebec-s-charter-of-values-will-fail-pm-harper-predicts-1.1856227|accessdate=17 September 2013|newspaper=CBC News|date=Sep 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Member of Parliament]] [[Maria Mourani]] was expelled from the [[Bloc Québécois]] for complaining that the proposed Charter is an act of political [[opportunism]] over [[human rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mas|first=Susana|title=Maria Mourani, expelled Bloc MP, quits the party|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/maria-mourani-expelled-bloc-mp-quits-the-party-1.1828707|accessdate=17 September 2013|newspaper=CBC News|date=Sep 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse===
Quebec's human rights commission, the [[Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse]] condemned the proposed charter as a "radical" infringement on fundamental rights.&lt;ref name="CTVCommission"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/quebec-human-rights-commission-slams-proposed-values-charter-1.1501308|title=Quebec human rights commission slams proposed values charter|last=Melanie Marquis and Nelson Wyatt|date=17 October 2013|work=CTV News|publisher=The Canadian Press|accessdate=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other groups===
The Canadian Civil Liberties Association submitted a brief to the Quebec National Assembly’s Committee on Institutions. They described Bill 60 as a profoundly disturbing law that would violate fundamental freedoms and cannot 'be justified in a free and democratic society' as the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms requires. CCLA posits that the Bill violates freedom of religion, freedom of expression, the right to equality, and the right to be free from discrimination. CCLA mentions inconsistencies in the law that would be disproportionate upon members of minority faith traditions. They urged the Quebec government to abandon the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccla.org/2013/12/20/cclas-opposition-to-the-quebec-charter-of-values-read-our-brief/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=March 24, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326104340/http://ccla.org/2013/12/20/cclas-opposition-to-the-quebec-charter-of-values-read-our-brief/ |archivedate=March 26, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Council of Canadian Muslims]] also submitted a brief to the Quebec National Assembly on Bill 60. They described the bill as discriminatory and that it would violate religious freedoms of the Muslim community. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nccm.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/NCCM-Submission-on-Bill-60-to-Quebec-NA.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The NCCM urged the opposition parties in the Quebec National Assembly to defeat Bill 60.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nccm.ca/national-muslim-advocacy-group-calls-quebecs-proposed-charter-discriminatory-urges-opposition-parties-to-reject-it/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The president of the ''[[Mouvement laïque québécois]]'', [[Lucie Jobin]], wrote that she "is delighted that secularism is registered on it - it is a public value of social cohesion - but we express many reservations. It would be a two-speed secularism".&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.lejournalinternational.fr/Charte-des-valeurs-quebecoises%C2%A0-Dieu-est-mort-vive-Dieu%C2%A0_a1302.html « Charte des valeurs québécoises : Dieu est mort, vive Dieu ! »], Roxanne D'Arco, Le Journal International, 30 septembre 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 13, [[Jewish General Hospital]] executive director Dr. Lawrence Rosenberg called the proposed charter "flawed and contrary to Quebec's spirit of inclusiveness and tolerance" and said that the hospital would ignore it if passed, in a written statement endorsed by the hospital’s board of directors.&lt;ref name="JGH"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/jewish-general-hospital-says-charter-is-offensive-1.2425582|title=Jewish General Hospital says charter is 'offensive'|date=13 November 2013|work=[[CBC News]]|accessdate=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 12, 2014, an independent documentary, ''Québec 60: un documentaire'', was published on [[YouTube]] to counter the Quebec Charter of Values. The documentary focuses on women who wear the veil and who live in the province of Quebec. It also tackles the Charter's effects on other religious minorities: the Sikh and the Jewish communities. On its first week of release, the online documentary gathered more than 18,000 views.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQpbYWRcgsk&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 15, 2014 an independent documentary, ''La charte des distractions'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140527215553/http://chartedesdistractions.com/ La charte des distractions] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140527215553/http://chartedesdistractions.com |date=May 27, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[English language|English]]: the Charter of Distractions) was published by a collective of independent media groups which consisted of G.A.P.P.A.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://gappasquad.wordpress.com G.A.P.P.A.]&lt;/ref&gt; Les Alter Citoyens,&lt;ref&gt;[http://lesaltercitoyens.com Les Alter Citoyens]&lt;/ref&gt; and 99%Media&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.99media.org 99%Media ]&lt;/ref&gt; as a critical view and analysis of the Quebec Charter of Values and how it represented a distraction from the real social, economic, and environmental issues that have been further exacerbated by the successive austerity measures imposed by the Parti Québécois and the Parti libéral du Québec before it. The documentary also drew parallels with what had happened a year earlier during the 2012 Quebec [[Maple spring]] protests. The documentary also drew parallels with the [[Idle No More]] movement and the treatment of [[First Nations]] peoples. The documentary was released openly to the public on YouTube&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uc0e-C9jFpk&lt;/ref&gt; and received significant media attention.

=== Public reaction ===

Some half of Quebeckers supported the Charter at its peak, according to polls.&lt;ref&gt;http://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/dan-delmar-its-wrong-to-link-mosque-shooting-quebec-charter-of-values&lt;/ref&gt; It was, however, not a major electoral motivation issue.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ipsos.com/en-ca/quebec-voter-issues-final-days-reveal-party-strategies&lt;/ref&gt;

The public reaction has included at least one public incident where a Quebec woman of Algerian origin wearing an Islamic veil was accosted in [[Laurier Québec]] shopping centre in [[Quebec City]] by a woman citing the charter who demanded they change their religion and remove the headscarf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Benjamin Shingler|first=and Melanie Marquis|title=Woman says she was accosted in mall over her Islamic veil as Liberals threaten election over Quebec charter|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/09/16/woman-says-she-was-accosted-in-mall-over-her-islamic-veil-as-liberals-threaten-election-over-quebec-charter/|accessdate=17 September 2013|newspaper=National Post|date=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another incident occurred when a white male harassed a hijab-wearing woman on a bus in Montreal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Muslim Woman In Hijab Harassed On Montreal Bus, Quebec Charter Cited In Rant|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/17/muslim-woman-hijab-harassed-montreal-bus-quebec_n_3942132.html|accessdate=26 March 2014|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, there have been at least two public protest marches in [[Montreal]] of people of various faiths denouncing the Charter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thousands gather in Montreal to protest charter of Quebec values|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/thousands-gather-in-montreal-to-protest-charter-of-quebec-values-1.1454721|accessdate=17 September 2013|newspaper=CTV News|date=14 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Anti-values charter marchers call for 'open Quebec'|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/anti-values-charter-marchers-call-for-open-quebec-1.1872799|accessdate=30 September 2013|newspaper=CBC News|date=29 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been at least two marches in support of the charter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pro-charter of Quebec values rally hits Montreal streets|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/pro-charter-of-quebec-values-rally-hits-montreal-streets-1.1863684|accessdate=30 September 2013|newspaper=CBC News|date=22 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the "Janettes" movement of women for [[laicity]].

Ginsburg]] defined the term in 1995.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Concept ==
Globally, women are confined to different societal standards on reproduction. The ability to choose whether women want to become pregnant is not available to all women. [[Contraception]] and [[abortion]]s can be illegal or difficult to obtain depending on location or [[socioeconomic status]]. Women’s experience of child birth has varied from required minimum number of children a mother must birth and honors for overachieving the set minimums to a restricted the number of children per household. In a broader sense, stratified reproduction asserts that certain categories of people are encouraged and coerced to reproduced while others are systematically discouraged to do so. The capacity to control one's reproductive choices is unequally distributed among race, sexual orientation, gender, class and socioeconomic status.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, M., Dirks, D. &amp; Aseltine, E. (2009). Stratified reproduction. In J. O'Brien (Ed.), Encyclopedia of gender and society (pp. 812-814). Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, Inc. doi: 10.4135/9781412964517.n406&lt;/ref&gt; Stratified reproduction also extends beyond the aspect of reproduction to the extent of conception, contraception, prenatal medical care, childcare, and the mother’s role in their child’s life.&lt;ref&gt;Ginsburg, Faye D. and Rayna Rapp, ed. 1995 Conceiving the New World Order.  London, England: University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt;

 In 1984, Shellee Colen coined the term "stratified reproduction" when studying West Indian childcare workers in New York City, who typically worked for wealthier white families. Colen highlighted differences between white and West Indian mothers’ ability to choose how they each care for their children. The white mothers hire a nanny to carry out the routine tasks of childcare while the West Indian mothers forgo the ability to raise their children so that they can financially support them. Colen drew the conclusion that child birth and childcare is experienced, valued, and rewarded differently depending on a mother’s socioeconomic status and availability of resources.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Studies using the concept ==
Since the emergence of the term stratified reproduction, researchers have applied its concepts to analyze the different effects of varying social factors on reproduction and childcare. [[Rayna Rapp]] and [[Faye Ginsburg|Frye D. Ginsburg]] pioneered the application of stratified reproduction to different societies to emphasize the variation to which women experienced reproduction and childcare. In Rapp and Ginsburg’s book, ''Conceiving'' ''the New World Order: The Global politics of Reproduction'', they discuss several societies that limited women’s choice on reproduction and childcare due to socioeconomic factors.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/30896173|title=Conceiving the new world order : the global politics of reproduction|date=1995|publisher=University of California Press|others=Ginsburg, Faye D., Reiter, Rayna R.|isbn=9780520089143|location=Berkeley|oclc=30896173}}&lt;/ref&gt; They touch on Shellee Colen’s research on West Indian nannies in New York and how they are unable to participate in their own child’s childcare, because they must immigrate to America to find work to support their family.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They also include Gail Kligman’s research on abortion bans in [[Romania]] under [[Nicolae Ceaușescu|Ceausescu]]’s rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/789661646|title=Gender in cross-cultural perspective|last=|first=|date=2012|publisher=Pearson|others=Brettell, Caroline., Sargent, Carolyn F., 1947-|year=|isbn=9780205247288|location=Boston|pages=374–384|oclc=789661646}}&lt;/ref&gt; State policy required the Romanian women to birth at least four children in hopes of increasing the population for a more efficient socialist country. They also discuss China’s limit on the maximum number of children per household, and low-income African American women’s struggle to obtain proper contraceptives and abortions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Rapp and Ginsburg concluded that “global and local socioeconomic relations that form the context for stratified reproduction, whereby ‘some categories of people are empowered to nurture and reproduce, while others are disempowered’”, and that cultural ideologies and state policies reinforce the stratified reproduction implanted by socioeconomic factors.

The scope of use of the stratified reproduction framework is not limited to women’s access to contraceptives or lack thereof. Researchers are applying stratified reproduction to the health of the mothers and children. Infertility has also been linked to the effects of stratified reproduction. Scarce financial resources deters mothers from being able to reach effective medical services to help prevent infertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greil|first=Arthur L.|last2=McQuillan|first2=Julia|last3=Shreffler|first3=Karina M.|last4=Johnson|first4=Katherine M.|last5=Slauson-Blevins|first5=Kathleen S.|title=Race-Ethnicity and Medical Services for Infertility|journal=Journal of Health and Social Behavior|language=en|volume=52|issue=4|pages=493–509|doi=10.1177/0022146511418236|pmid=22031500|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Infertility ==
Infertility is just one aspect of stratified reproduction. Although it is estimated that 186 million people worldwide are affected by infertility, technology can be able to assist those who are infertile.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Inhorn|first=M. C.|last2=Patrizio|first2=P.|date=2015-03-22|title=Infertility around the globe: new thinking on gender, reproductive technologies and global movements in the 21st century|url=https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article/21/4/411/683746|journal=Human Reproduction Update|language=en|volume=21|issue=4|pages=411–426|issn=1355-4786|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In-Vitro-Fertilization (IVF) is one assisted reproductive technique (ART) that is used. IVF was developed over 30 years ago to help women with blocked or damaged fallopian tubes. IVF has helped many couples achieve their dreams of having a child. However, IVF is extremely expensive and/or inaccessible to many globally. In Central and Southern Africa "two-thirds of infertile women have diagnoses of tubal blockage attributable to sterilizing RTIs [Reproductive Tract Infections]" which is exactly what IVF was developed for.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Inhorn|first=Marcia C.|date=2009-06-18|title=Right to assisted reproductive technology: Overcoming infertility in low-resource countries|journal=International Journal of Gynecology &amp; Obstetrics|language=en|volume=106|issue=2|pages=172–174|doi=10.1016/j.ijgo.2009.03.034|pmid=19539927|issn=0020-7292}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high costs and inaccessibility keep infertility as a major aspect of stratified reproduction. According to a study done by Marcia C. Inhorn and Pasquale Patrizio, regions such as South Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and North Africa, Central and Eastern Europe and Central Asia have high infertility rates.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; While infertility is a global phenomenon, other issues within those regions play a role in their high infertility rates.

Secondary infertility, being unable to conceive after a previous pregnancy, is the most common form of infertility in women.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Typically secondary infertility comes from RTIs. In countries where abortions are illegal, women will choose to have unsafe abortions. These unsafe abortions can lead to RTIs and secondary infertility if left untreated. Studies show that in places where laws are lifting the ban on abortions, secondary infertility rates are decreasing.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Ethnicity and race also play a role in infertility. Recently, the stories of Latinas' struggle for reproductive rights have been coming out. These stories provided evidence that the US was funding forced sterilization of Latinas and other ethnic groups. In their article, Elena R. Gutiérrez and Liza Fuentes study two communities, Puerto Rican women in Puerto Rico and New York and Mexican-origin women in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gutiérrez|first=Elena R.|last2=Fuentes|first2=Liza|date=|title=Population Control by Sterilization|url=https://www.albany.edu/celac/LRR%202010.pdf#page=87|journal=Latino (a) Research Review|volume=7|issue=3|pages=85–100|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once Puerto Rico became a US colony in 1898, people began to talk about Puerto Rico being overpopulated. To deal with this a large portion, over 34% of mothers aged 20–49, were sterilized. Not all women chose to be sterilized.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Many of these women were used for contraceptive testing without their knowledge.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Mexican-origin women were another community that experiences forced sterilization. They were non consensual sterilizations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; These sterilizations came from the idea that Latinas are over-populating the US.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In his article, Leo Chavez discusses Latina fertility in the United States. Their ethnic identity drove a new set of advertisements, anti-immigration advertisements.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chavez|first=Leo|date=Summer 2004|title=A Glass Half Empty: Latina Reproduction and Public Discourse|jstor=44127294|journal=Human Organization|volume=63|issue=2|pages=173–188}}&lt;/ref&gt; These advertisements suggest that the Latina communities leave. That their fertility was not wanted in the US, a country where the population growth rate was near zero.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Puerto Ricans such as those discussed in the article by Gutiérrez and Fuentes were apart of this larger Latina community that was being targeted. In Leo Chavez's article, he collects data to discuss fertility rates in Latinas. He uses this data to show that while Latinas are having more children, they are not started at a younger age as the US would like to believe.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Queer Stratified Reproduction ==
More recently, there has been a closer look into how the system of stratified reproduction impacts the LGBTQ+ community. Stratified reproduction within the reproductive field of medicine feeds into a political economy that does not include a right to health, but a right to purchase health care if one can afford it and is deemed worthy of these biomedicines. States such as Arizona and Mississippi have recently seen legislative attempts to allow health care services to deny care to LGBTQ people and these stratifications of access to care  also denies LGBTQ people the same possibilities for family planning and formation.&lt;ref&gt;Greil, A. L., McQuillan, J., Shreffler, K. M., Johnson, K. M., &amp; Slauson-Blevins, K. S. (2011). Race-Ethnicity and Medical Services for Infertility: Stratified Reproduction in a Population-based Sample of U.S. Women. Journal of Health and Social Behavior, 52(4), 493–509. https://doi.org/10.1177/0022146511418236&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Touillettes.JPG|thumb|Three common coffee swizzle sticks]]

A '''swizzle stick''' is a small stick used to hold fruit [[Cocktail garnish|garnishes]] or stir drinks. The original swizzle sticks were created in the 18th century at a rum plantation in the West Indies. They were used to stir up Bermudian cocktails called [[Rum Swizzle]]s and were made from the [[branch]] of the ''[[Quararibea turbinata]]'' (also known as the "Swizzle stick tree"). In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, stir sticks made of glass were created to shake out the bubbles from [[champagne]], whose carbonation caused indigestion for some drinkers.

'''''The World Tossed at Tennis''''' is a [[Literature in English#Jacobean literature|Jacobean]] era [[masque]] composed by [[Thomas Middleton]] and [[William Rowley]], first published in 1620. It was likely acted on 4 March 1620 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|new style]]) at [[Somerset House|Denmark House]].&lt;ref&gt;W. J. Lawrence, "Early Substantive Theatre Masques," ''Times Literary Supplement'', 8 December 1921.&lt;/ref&gt;

Middleton and Rowley conducted one of the most interesting collaborative efforts in [[English Renaissance theatre|English Renaissance drama]]; together they produced significant works, ''[[The Changeling (play)|The Changeling]]'' and ''[[A Fair Quarrel]]''. Their only masque is one of the stranger and more original literary products of their generation.

==Publication==
''A Courtly Masque; the Device called, the World tost at Tennis'' was entered into the [[Stationers' Register]] on 4 July 1620, and published later that year in a [[book size|quarto]] printed by George Purslowe for the [[Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers|stationer]] Edward Wright. The title page assigns authorship to Middleton and Rowley; it states that the work was performed "diverse times" by Rowley's acting company, [[Prince Charles's Men]].

The first edition bears Middleton's dedication to [[Charles Howard, 2nd Earl of Nottingham|Charles Howard, Baron of Effingham]] and his wife Mary Lady Effingham, the daughter of Sir [[William Cockayne]], a [[Lord Mayor of London]]. It also includes an address to the reader signed by "Simplicity," a Prologue, and a list of "The Figures and Persons" in the masque.

==Authorship==
In their other collaborations, Middleton takes primary responsibility for the main plot, and Rowley handles subplot materials – usually comic, but also serious, as in ''A Fair Quarrel''. The standard dichotomy of main plot and subplot does not apply to their masque; in this work, Rowley was mainly responsible for the first half of the work, the first 471 lines, and Middleton the second half, 515 lines.&lt;ref&gt;David J. Lake, ''The Canon of Middleton's Plays'', Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1975; pp. 203–4.&lt;/ref&gt; The break between the two writers' shares comes just after the masque's oddest and most original feature, the introduction of the personifications of five coloured starches.

==The message==
The masque was commissioned by [[Charles I of England|Prince Charles]]. The intent of the masque was to influence his father, King [[James I of England|James I]], to move away from his pacifistic foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;John Jowett, "Thomas Middleton," in: ''A Companion to Renaissance Drama'', Arthur F. Kinney, ed., London, Blackwell, 2002;  p. 510.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1620, the [[Thirty Years' War]] was in its first phase; James daughter and Charles's sister [[Elizabeth of Bohemia|Princess Elizabeth]] and her husband [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine]] had inadvertently started the war when they accepted the crown of [[Bohemia]] in 1618.

Despite his strong familial connection, James was unwilling to take an active part in the Protestant cause, much to the distress of many of his subjects. The masque had no discernible success in swaying James's position.

==The masque==
The masque features the mythological divinities and personifications that are standard in the masque genre: [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and [[Pallas Athena]] are present, as are Time and Deceit, the nine [[Muses]] and the [[Nine Worthies]]. There is a King and a Lawyer, a "Land-Captain" and a "Sea-Captain," and the Devil as well. The second half of the work, Middleton's portion, is dominated by the adventures of Deceit as he interacts with the other characters. Eventually Deceit is defeated by the Lawyer, and the Devil is defeated by the Church.

The masque also contains unusual characters; the Induction is a conversation among three personified English royal palaces, [[St. James's Palace|St. James's]], [[Richmond Palace|Richmond]], and Denmark House. And the first of the masque's three dances is performed by, of all things, five different-coloured Starches. To appropriate music – "a light fantastic air" and "a ridiculous strain" – five figures representing coloured starches, white, blue, yellow, green and red, "come dancing in." After their dance, they quarrel; White demands precedence over the others, but they resist. As Yellow puts it, "I am as stiff i' my opinion / As any Starch amongst you."

The Starches are examples of what Jupiter calls the "Deceit and Pride" of the age, characterised by "The frenzy of apparel," "masculine painting," and "Vain-glory, fashion, humour, and such toys."

==Why five starches?==
In the second decade of the seventeenth century, Mistress [[Anne Turner (murderer)|Anne Turner]] started a new fashion. It had long been standard in Elizabethan and Jacobean clothing to wear starched white ruffs and cuffs, commonly called "bands." The famous and often-reproduced portrait of actor Edward Alleyn (seen [[Edward Alleyn|here]]) provides a good view of the prevailing style. Mrs. Turner was the first person in England to dye these white bands yellow. The fashion became famous and notorious when Turner, an associate of [[Simon Forman]] and a denizen of the Jacobean demimonde, was executed on 15 November 1615 for her role in the murder of Sir [[Thomas Overbury]].&lt;ref&gt;Ann Rosalind Jones and Peter Stallybrass, ''Renaissance Clothing and the Materials of Memory'', Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2000; pp. 59–86.&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Lord Chief Justice]] Sir Edward Coke (in traditional white bands [[Edward Coke|here]]) sentenced Turner to death, he specifically instructed that she should die in yellow bands: "as she was the person who had brought yellow starched ruffs into vogue, she should be hanged in that dress, that the same might end in shame and detestation."&lt;ref&gt;John Heneage Jesse, ''Literary and Historical Memorials of London'', London, Richard Bentley, 1847; p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; According to at least one report, the hangman also wore yellow bands as he put Turner to death.

References to yellow bands and yellow starch recur in plays of the 1615–18 era, by Middleton and others – ''[[A Fair Quarrel]]'', ''[[The Widow (play)|The Widow]]'', ''[[More Dissemblers Besides Women]]'', ''[[Albumazar]]'', ''[[The Queen of Corinth]]'', ''[[The Devil is an Ass]]'', and ''[[Christmas, His Masque]]''. ([[Robert Davenport (dramatist)|Robert Davenport]]'s plays of uncertain date, ''[[The City Nightcap]]'' and ''[[A New Trick to Cheat the Devil]]'', also contain such references.) ''The World Tossed at Tennis'' is unique in that it refers not only to white and yellow starch but to red, green, and blue starch too. Were these other colours worn in ruffs and cuffs in the years around 1620? The text of the masque suggests this was so, though supporting evidence is thin.

(In Davenport's ''New Trick to Cheat the Devil'', Act IV scene 1, The Devil claims that "I was first father for this yellow Sterch, / Which did succeed the blew...." The color sequence, blue then yellow, is the same as given by Rowley in ''World Tossed at Tennis''.)

The fashion for yellow bands lasted in Court circles until the mid-1620s.&lt;ref&gt;Jones and Stallybrass, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable winners ==

==History==

The earliest roots of the genre can be found in [[Jean Yarbrough]]'s ''[[King of the Zombies]]'' (1941) and [[Gordon Douglas (director)|Gordon Douglas]]'s ''[[Zombies on Broadway]]'' (1945), though both of these films dealt with [[Haitian Vodou|Haitian-style]] zombies. While not comedies, [[George A. Romero]]'s ''[[Dawn of the Dead (1978 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]'' (1978) and ''[[Day of the Dead]]'' (1985) featured several comedic scenes. ''[[An American Werewolf in London]]'' (1981)&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Resa (2004). [http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue388/interview2.html "Science Fiction Weekly Interview"]. ''SciFi Weekly, Issue 388'', paragraph 4. Retrieved April 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Return of the Living Dead]]'' series (1985)&lt;ref&gt;Dellamorte (January 22, 2003). [http://www.classic-horror.com/reviews/returnlivingdead.shtml ''Return of the Living Dead'']. ''Classic Horror Review''. Retrieved April 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; (especially the first two and the last of the series) can be considered some of the earliest examples of zombie-comedy using the modern zombie. Other early examples include ''[[Mr. Vampire]]'', ''[[CHUD II: Bud the CHUD]]'' (1989), ''[[Braindead (film)|Braindead]]'' (1992), and ''[[Bio Zombie]]'' (1998).

Modern zombie comedies include ''[[Zombieland]]'', [[Gregg Bishop]]'s ''[[Dance of the Dead (film)|Dance of the Dead]]'', and [[Edgar Wright]]'s ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]''&lt;ref&gt;Edelstein, David (September 23, 2004).

Romero]]'s earlier ''Dead'' films, especially ''[[Dawn of the Dead (1978 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]''.

Andrew Currie's ''[[Fido (film)|Fido]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Capt. Xerox (March 16, 2007). [http://www.theendoftheuniverse.ca/node/529 "Critics Love the New Zombie Comedy ''Fido''"]. ''The Website @ The End Of The Universe''. Retrieved April 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Matthew Leutwyler]]'s ''[[Dead &amp; Breakfast]]'', and [[Peter Jackson]]'s ''[[Braindead (1992 film)|Braindead]]'' are also examples of zombie comedies.&lt;ref&gt;Frazer, Bryant. [http://www.deep-focus.com/flicker/braindea.html ''Braindead'' (review)]. ''Deep Focus''. Retrieved April 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sam Raimi]]'s ''[[Evil Dead II]]'', although a more direct [[horror film]], contains some lighthearted and dark comedy elements, and its sequel, ''[[Army of Darkness]]'', is even more comedic. ''[[The Evil Dead (franchise)|The Evil Dead]]'' series does not, however, feature any traditional-style zombies.
