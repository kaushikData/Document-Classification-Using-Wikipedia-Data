'''Allan Gurganus''' is an American [[novelist]], [[short story]] writer, and [[essay]]ist whose work, which includes ''[[Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All]]'' and ''[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/books/review/local-souls-by-allan-gurganus.html Local Souls],'' is often influenced by and set in his native [[North Carolina]].

==Biography==
Gurganus was born in [[Rocky Mount, North Carolina|Rocky Mount]], [[North Carolina]]. He first trained as a painter, studying at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and the [[Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts]]. He served three years as a message decoder with the [[United States Navy]] during the [[Vietnam War]], as a punishment for draft evasion,&lt;ref name=karp&gt;Peter Karp, Paul Veitch, "Old-fashioned storyteller with a Southern drawl", ''Sunday Canberra Times'', 15 November 1998, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; and began writing during his time on the ''[[USS Yorktown (CV-10)|USS Yorktown]]''. He achieved the rank petty officer second class. Following military service, he graduated from [[Sarah Lawrence College]] where he studied with [[Grace Paley]]. He studied with [[John Cheever]], [[John Irving]] and [[Stanley Elkin]] at the [[University of Iowa]] in the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]].  Cheever sold Gurganus's short story "Minor Heroism" to ''[[The New Yorker]]'' without telling Gurganus beforehand.&lt;ref name = salon&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was the first story ''The New Yorker'' had ever published about a homosexual character (the magazine's founder [[Harold Ross]] had instructed his staff that there was no such thing as a homosexual).&lt;ref name=karp/&gt; Gurganus himself is a gay man.&lt;ref name=salon/&gt;

In addition to later teaching at both Sarah Lawrence and the Iowa Writers' Workshop, he has also taught at [[Stanford University|Stanford]] and [[Duke University|Duke]] Universities.

His best known work is his 1989 debut novel, ''[[Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All]]'', which was on the [[New York Times Best Seller list]] for eight months. It won the [[Sue Kaufman Prize for First Fiction|Sue Kaufman Prize]] from [[The American Academy of Arts and Letters]], was a main selection of the [[Book-of-the-Month Club]], and sold over four million copies. It was made into a [[CBS]] television play, with [[Cicely Tyson]] winning one of its four [[Emmy Award]]s as best supporting actress in the role of the freed slave Castalia. The novel was also adapted for a one-woman [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] play, starring [[Ellen Burstyn]], in 2003.

Gurganus's other works include ''[[White People (book)|White People]]'',&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/11/16/home/gurganus-white.html|title=The Curse of the Caucasians|date=February 3, 1991|first=George|last=Garrett|authorlink=George Garrett (poet)}}&lt;/ref&gt; a collection of short stories and novellas;&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; ''[[Plays Well with Others (novel)|Plays Well with Others]]'', a novel; and ''[[The Practical Heart]]'', a collection of four novellas, which won a 2001 [[Lambda Literary Award]] in the Gay Men's Fiction category. His shorter fiction has been published in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'', and ''[[The Paris Review]]'', in addition to being included in the ''[[O. Henry Awards|O. Henry Prize Collection]]'' and the ''[[W. W. Norton#Norton anthologies|Norton Anthology of Short Fiction]]''.

After living in [[New York City]] for a number of years, Gurganus returned to North Carolina, where he co-founded the political group Writers Against [[Jesse Helms]] and, as a result, appeared as himself in [[Tim Kirkman]]'s 1998 documentary ''[[Dear Jesse]]''. Gurganus has also taken a position against the [[Iraq War]], most notably by citing his Vietnam War experience in an essay published in ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'', "The War at Home",&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

'''Anna Baright Curry''' (1854-1924) was a noted educator and the founder of [[Curry College]] in [[Milton, Massachusetts]].

== Early life and education ==

Anna Baright was born on June 19, 1854, to a [[Quaker]] family in Poughkeepsie, New York.{{sfn|Curry College History}} Most of her family members were art lovers; the stage actress [[Julia Dean (actress, born 1830)|Julia Dean]] was her aunt.{{sfn|Howe|1904|pp=388-391}} 

After graduating from Cook's Collegiate Institute in 1873, she worked briefly as a teacher in New York state, then taught [[elocution]] at Milwaukee Female College. In 1875 she enrolled in [[Boston University]]'s School of Oratory, where one of her teachers was [[Alexander Graham Bell]]. At B.U. she was described by one of her professors as "the greatest woman reader in the country." This was a significant compliment in an era of oratory when speakers such as Charles Dickens and Mark Twain were paid thousands to read lengthy pieces of their work. Baright graduated with honors in 1877.{{sfn|Curry College History}} 

== Career ==

After graduation she was appointed First Assistant to Lewis Baxter Monroe, Dean of the School of Oratory. In 1879, she and Monroe were planning to open a summer school for oratory on [[Martha's Vineyard]] when Monroe died. Rather than cancel, Baright successfully ran the five-week program herself. It was the first summer school of its kind in the country. That fall, Samuel Silas Curry took over the leadership of the Boston University School of Oratory. {{sfn|Curry College History}}

Encouraged by Boston University's first president, [[William F. Warren]], Baright started her own school in downtown Boston that fall. The School of Elocution and Expression offered a two-year program modeled after that of the B.U. oratory school. Baright based her teaching on Monroe's principle that "expression is the outward manifestation of that which is already in the consciousness."{{sfn|Curry College History}} Professor J. W. Churchill called her "the greatest woman teacher of elocution in the country."{{sfn|Howe|1904|p=391}}

In 1882, Baright married [[Samuel Silas Curry]] and became Anna Baright Curry. In 1885, the school was renamed the School of Expression, and Samuel Silas Curry became the head of the school with Anna Baright Curry serving as Dean.{{sfn|Fryer|2012|p=31}} Former Boston University School of Oratory professor and telephone inventor [[Alexander Graham Bell]] became the school's first chancellor from 1907 until his death in 1922. The Currys ran the school until their respective deaths in 1921 and 1924. Years later, the school was renamed Curry College in their honor.{{sfn|Curry College History}}

== Personal life and death ==

Baright and Curry married on May 31, 1882. The couple had six children, one of whom was the noted mathematician Haskell Curry.{{sfn|Curry College History}} Baright Curry was a member of the [[New England Women's Club]], the Cantabrigia Club, and the Boston [[Browning Society]].{{sfn|Howe|1904|p=391}} She died in Boston in 1924.{{sfn|Curry College History}}

'''Buke''' ({{zh|s=补课|p=bǔ kè}}) in the high school of mainland China refers to the social phenomenon of extra study for the improvement of students’ academic performance in [[National Higher Education Entrance Examination]] (commonly known as ''Gaokao'') in the form of extra mandatory classes organized by high schools or private tutoring provided by [[cram school]].

== Types ==
Generally, Buke in high schools of mainland China are of two types:
* Extra mandatory classes. In most cases, high schools arrange such classes for students in weekends and holidays, which may follow the ordinary schedule; or in some areas, students will be asked to study in school for extended hours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinanews.com/edu/2014/09-09/6571190.shtml 鄉村補課現象難禁 怕拉大與城裡學校差距不得不補]&lt;/ref&gt; In a typical Chinese test-prep factory, Maotanchang High School, students will have their three-hour free time on Sunday afternoon every week ).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/04/magazine/inside-a-chinese-test-prep-factory.html?_r=0#%20 Inside a Chinese Test-Prep Factory  Available online 23 Mar 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Cram school]]. The main feature of private tutoring is that it is optional, depending on factors such as personal willingness, study situations, and family economic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpfd.cnki.com.cn/Article/CPFDTOTAL-JYJJ200610001091.htm 中國城鎮學生教育補習的實證分析]&lt;/ref&gt; Yu (2012) suggests that private tutoring mainly consists of three forms “(a) one-to-one private tutoring, (b) small groups of students with one tutor, and (c) private tutoring in a large class setting.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/ecoedu/v32y2013icp1-28.html Does private tutoring improve students’ National College Entrance Exam performance?—A case study from Jinan, China  Available online 23 Mar 2015 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reasons ==
;Examination-oriented educational system and result-oriented educational ideology
:A student’s score in ''[[Gaokao]]'' is the main standard for admission to university, and the competition has intensified over the years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.cn/jrzg/2013-06/04/content_2418433.htm 高考大省考生增減都煩惱 高考競爭激烈難緩解 Available online 23 Mar 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Being admitted to a top-class university is considered as the ultimate success for students, at least in teachers' and parents' views.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nanzao.com/tc/14c315caa3412a9/pin-ge-bi-xue-fen-zhong-yao-fu-mu-ying-gai-bian-xin-tai 品格比學分重要 父母應改變心態 Available online 23 Mar 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;  Students, parents, teachers and schools all want to improve the students’ score in any possible ways, including extra classes either in school or in private institution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pengpai.blogspot.hk/2007/10/blog-post.html 城市義務教育階段課外補習研究 Available online 23 Mar 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;
;Unbalanced and insufficient distribution of educational resources.
:High schools vary in different levels. Lower-level schools lack outstanding teachers, while private educational institutions provide opportunities for students in lower-level schools to get high-standard education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cqvip.com/qk/82253x/200501/15153295.html 高中生教育補習支出：影響因素及政策啟示]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related legislation ==
Almost every year the [[Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China]] issues official documents which emphasize the prohibition of any forms of ''Buke'' organized by state-run schools. In Opinions Concerning the Implementation of the Compulsory Education Law to further regulate which was issued after the emendation of the Compulsory Education Law in 2006, the Ministry of Education points out that it is banned for teachers in state-run schools to encourage either intramural or extramural ''Buke''. And Teachers’ devotion in the extramural Buke in their part-time is also strongly opposed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moe.gov.cn/publicfiles/business/htmlfiles/moe/moe_2778/201001/xxgk_77687.html 教育部關於當前加強中小學管理規範辦學行為的指導意見 Available online 23 Mar 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the prohibition of ''Buke'' by state-run schools, in mainland there is no national regulation for ''Buke'' organized by private-run schools or educational establishments, however the regulations made by some local governments at different levels did affect them. In February 2015, Wenzhou City Board of Education issued Disposal Options of [[Wenzhou]] for Primary and Secondary School Teachers in Paid Buke, for teacher’s attendance in paid ''Buke'' is officially considered an unprofessional conduct. For the first time this regulation relate to the in-service teachers in private-run primary and secondary schools, hence it is called “the toughest regulation on Buke”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.hexun.com/2015-02-04/173043172.html?from=rss 民办学校教师首次被严禁有偿补课 民辦學校教師首次被嚴禁有償補課 Available online 23 Mar 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; According to a clerk working in an educational establishment, the in-service teachers in Wenzhou no longer attend extramural Buke after the implementation of the disposal options.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.zj.com/detail/2015/03/10/1569465.html 溫州推最嚴“禁補令”去年47教師有償補課被查]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Debate ==
While some parents, student and educators support ''buke'' for the opportunity to retain learning through holidays and to work out difficult problems for which there is not time during normal classes,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cntv.cn/china/20100815/100796_1.shtml 教育部頒佈補課禁令10年 學生和家長稱形同虛設 Available online 10 Apr 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://edu.qq.com/a/20140212/011282.htm 部分中學寒假補課 兩派網友意見不一激烈辯論 Available online 10 Apr 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; others oppose the practice as overly stressing academic performance and increasing stress on students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edu.qq.com/a/20140212/011282.htm 部分中學寒假補課 兩派網友意見不一激烈辯論 Available online 10 Apr 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.hsw.cn/system/2014/08/07/051992273_01.shtml 補課or不補課：網路大V發起討論 家長學生舌戰激辯 Available online 10 Apr 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.hsw.cn/system/2014/08/07/051992273_03.shtml 補課or不補課：網路大V發起討論 家長學生舌戰激辯 Available online 10 Apr 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

She was the first Mexican woman on the radio in San Antonio, with her program "La Estrella" airing on [[KONO (AM)|KONO]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fmusq|title=MUNGUIA, CAROLINA MALPICA|last=E.|first=OROZCO, CYNTHIA|date=2010-06-15|website=tshaonline.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and career ==
Carolina Malpica de Munguía was born in [[Puebla, Mexico]]{{n|date=November 2018}} on January 14, 1891 to her father Patricio Malpica. Her father was widowed, and sent her to Instituto Normal Metodista for schooling, which was a Methodist school even though she was Catholic.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=González|first=Gabriela|date=2003|title=Carolina Munguía and Emma Tenayuca: The Politics of Benevolence and Radical Reform|url=http://www.jstor.org.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/stable/3347357|journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies|volume=24| issue =  2/3|pages=200–229|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the institute she was taught how to be a teacher and graduated in 1911, and later worked in an elementary school in Mexico.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1031048137|title=Redeeming La Raza : transborder modernity, race, respectability, and rights|last=Gabriela,|first=González,|isbn=9780199914142|location=New York, NY|oclc=1031048137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malpica de Munguía took graduate classes in English, then became a principal at a Methodist School in Orizaba, Veracruz.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The school closed due to the Mexican Revolution, so Malpica de Munguía started her own school in Puebla, Mexico where she taught fourth and fifth grade before its closure.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It was after this that she became the primary school inspector or supervisor for the city of Puebla.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Gonzalez, Gabriela.

&lt;/ref&gt;

Carolina’s career as an educator ended when she married José Rómulo Munguía Torres in 1916.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/74671044|title=Latinas in the United States : a historical encyclopedia|date=2006|publisher=Indiana University Press|others=Ruíz, Vicki., Sánchez Korrol, Virginia.|isbn=0253111692|location=Bloomington|oclc=74671044}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had seven children and remained married until their deaths.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Due to Carolina’s husband’s status as a revolutionary, the family were exiled from Mexico, leading to the family moving in 1926 to [[San Antonio|San Antonio, Texas]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Later career and activism ==
In 1932 Carolina became the first Mexican Woman on the radio with her program “La Estrella” that was aired on [[KONO (AM)|KONO]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; “La Estrella” was started to help promote the Mexican culture in San Antonio, which it did by connecting with the listeners through music and books.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After the success of the radio program Carolina helped her husband establish his own printing business in the 1930s called Munguía Printers which was a family affair.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In her early years in San Antonio Carolina taught Spanish at the Wesleyan Institute, which later became [[Trinity University (Texas)|Trinity University]], until her family grew too large for her to keep a career.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Additionally, in this time she washed and shelled pecans in the Munguía home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://depthome.brooklyn.cuny.edu/latinashistory/munguiacarolina.html|title=munguiacarolina|website=depthome.brooklyn.cuny.edu|access-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After finding economic stability for the Munguía family in San Antonio, Carolina decided to become an activist for the Mexican community, or [[La Raza]]. She did this by starting on June 12, 1938 Círculo Social Feminino, México, later renamed to Circulo Cultural "Isabel, La Catolica," which was a designed to help lower middle-class to working-class Mexican and Mexican American women.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The slogan for the organization was “Toda por la patria y el hogar,” or All for country and home, which was designed around the revitalization of the Mexican and Mexican American community.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Circulo Cultural participated in many community projects like taking in donations for the poor, celebrating Mexican holidays, volunteering at the [[Mexican consulate|Mexican Consulate]] and Clinic, putting on cultural events, and raising money for community outreach.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For the organization, Carolina provided two Mexican-origin lawyers to answer any legal questions that members of the Circulo Cultural might have.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The organization was only active for sixteen months, and disbanded in the early 1940s.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In 1938 she started participating with Asociación de la Biblioteca Mexicana, which was a project of the [[Mexican consulate|Mexican Consulate]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Carolina Malpica de Munguía’s next role of a community Activist was through the Spanish-Speaking PTA. She served in the Crockett Latin American Parent-Teachers Association, which she was the Secretary in 1937 and the President in 1938.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Spanish-Speaking PTA was created so that Spanish-speaking Parents could bring their concerns and ideas to the teachers in order for the students’ education to improve. Because of community need Carolina improved Crockett Elementary School to meet those needs. [[Great Depression|The Great Depression]] was going on at this time so students were going to school hungry, dirty, poorly clothed, and sick or injured.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; To meet these needs a dining room was opened, showers were created, sewing circles were organized, and medical attention were given to students.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Carolina had additional needs met through the Home of Neighborly Service Center, who fed children, and Mexican American barbers, who gave children free haircuts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Throughout the entire time she served at Crockett she had the Spanish Speaking PTA raise money for clothes and shoes for the students, while creating Christmas baskets for the families of students.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1940 and 1941 she moved up in the organization and became the head of the Spanish Speaking Department of the San Antonio PTA Council in District 5, and in this position she looked after the Spanish-Speaking PTAs in District 5, gave speeches at seven schools, participated in Executive PTA Board meetings, founded a Spanish-Speaking PTA chapter at T. J. Brackenridge, and visited the PTA state convention to showcase work done by Spanish speaking students.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She joined the [[American Red Cross]] because four of her sons were fighting in [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Malpica de Munguía helped her husband start El Patronato in 1944, which was an organization that was built around the idea of the Spanish Language.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; El Patronato helped to create the Universidad Autónoma de México in San Antonio.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This was not the last of Carolina’s activist work.

== Later life and legacy ==
Later in life she participated in the Shrine of the Little Flower, which was devoted to [[Thérèse of Lisieux|St. Thérese of Lisieux]], and was a Catholic organization.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; She was never a United States citizen, but she was the grandmother of [[Henry Cisneros]], who became the first Mexican-American mayor of San Antonio.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She died May 25, 1977 in San Antonio, Texas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6058">The '''Dorak affair''' was a scandal concerning a group of antiquities from the Yortan culture, the so-called "Dorak Treasure", which took place in the 1950s and 1960s in [[Turkey]] and centred on the British archaeologist [[James Mellaart]].

==Events==
According to Mellaart, he encountered a young lady called Anna Papastrati on a train from [[Istanbul]] to [[Izmir]] and noticed that she was wearing an unusual armband. She is meant to have told him that this armband was part of a collection of antiquities, which was in the possession of her family. He therefore went to the house of Papastrati, who according to him was a young Greek lady and spoke good [[English language|English]] with a slight American accent. There she showed him numerous pieces which were stylistically associated with the [[Yortan culture]]. The Yortan culture was one of the cultures which neighboured ancient [[Troy]]. Mellaart stayed several days in the house at Izmir, making sketches and notes. Photography of the pieces was forbidden, according to Mellaart. Papastrati promised to photograph the pieces herself at the next opportunity and send the photos to him. The items were said to have been found in shallow graves near the city of [[Dorak]], south of the [[Sea of Marmara]], during the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)|Greco-Turkish War]]. Mellaart reported that he had seen photographs of the graves in which the Dorak treasure had been found and that there was a description of the discovery in [[Modern Greek]], which he had also seen. Mellaart said he left the house after a few days without correctly noting its location, although he noted a name and address (''Anna Papastrati, 217 Kazim Direk Street, Izmir'') on a piece of notepaper. No communication was received subsequently from Papastrati. Mellaart said that he did not make the discovery public at first because he was waiting for the photos and consent to publication. He said he had written to Izmir twice without receiving an answer. 

In mid-October 1958, a letter was received by the [[British Institute in Ankara|British Institute of Archaeology]] in [[Ankara]], where Mellaart was deputy director. It read:
{{quote|Dear James, Here is the letter you want so much. As the owner, I authorise you to publish your drawings of the Dorak objects, which you drew in our house. You always were more interested in these old things than in me! Well, there it is. Good luck, and goodbye. Love, Anna Pappastrati.}} 
The letter was dated "18/10/1958" and the return to sender address was "Kazim Direk Caddesi no. 217, Karsiyaka – Izmir."

Mellaart then published his sketches and notes on the finds in ''[[The Illustrated London News]]''. Discussing their significance in the article, Mellaart drew parallels with the Treasure of [[Ur]].

Investigations by the Turkish authorities and by journalists revealed, however, that the address on Kazim Direk Caddesi belonged to a commercial building in a street which had no residential houses. However, there were at least two other streets of the same name in Izmir at that time, and the street might have been renamed. At any rate, the address could not be located. The pieces which Mellaart had described, never appeared in private collections or on the legal art market.

In 1962, a press campaign began in Turkey, in which Mellaart was charged with smuggling the treasure, in exchange for a cut worth 240 million [[Deutsche Mark]]s. There was eye-witness testimony that a thick-set foreigner had been seen near the find location at Dorak with a woman. One witness even identified Mellaart himself. In 1964, public pressure reached such a point that the Turkish government forbid Mellaart from excavating at [[Çatalhöyük]] and they finally allowed him to enter Turkey in 1965, on condition that he would participate only as an assistant.

==Debate about the Dorak Treasure==
There are various views about the reality behind the Dorak affair. One perspective holds that Mellaart, who was known only in relation to the excavations at Çatalhöyük, had invented the treasure himself. The supposed letter from Anna Papastrati has similarities with the typewriter used by his wife in the institute and for his other correspondence at that time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL0510/S00059.htm Suzan Mazur, "Dorak Diggers Weigh in on Anna &amp; Royal Treasure", www.scoop.co.nz from 4 August 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another opinion connects the American accent of "Anna Papastrati" with the US base at Izmir or with employment at a [[CIA]] operation there. In the late 1960s, this was known as a key point for smuggling of items out of Turkey for the illegal art market. In this view, Mellaart was used to provide high-value finds of the Yortan culture with a history from a renowned expert. In this view, the meeting with Mellaart on the train was intentionally arranged and he was then played by criminals.&lt;ref&gt;Dora Jane Hamblin, ''Türkei – Land der lebenden Legenden'', Bastei-Lübbe, Bergisch Gladbach 1975, {{ISBN|3-404-25012-5}}, S. 196 f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Posthumously, Mellaart has been implicated in [[James Mellaart#Aftermath|several cases]] of fabrication of archeological finds.

'''Facultades de Filosofía y Teología de San Miguel''' (English: Philosophical and Theological Faculty of San Miguel) is a [[Jesuit]] university and seminary in [[San Miguel, Buenos Aires|San Miguel]], [[Buenos Aires Province]], Argentina. 

==History==
San Miguel was initially founded in 1918 in Santa Fe and in 1923 was moved to Buenos Aires. The university has two campuses, USAL Universidad del Salvador and Centro Loyola.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facultades de Filosofía y Teología de San Miguel|url=http://sri.ucab.edu.ve/?q=es/content/facultades-de-filosof%C3%AD-y-teolog%C3%AD-de-san-miguel-0|website=La Universidad Católica Andrés Bello|language=Spanish|accessdate=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1932, the university received authorization from the [[Holy See]] to award ecclesiastical degrees in philosophy and theology, from bachelor through [[Licentiate of Sacred Theology|licentiate]] and doctorate. For many years it was the only university in South America authorized to confer pontifical degrees in philosophy and theology, and so drew students from Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia, Chile, Peru, Brazil, and Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jesuitas-sm.com.ar/quienes-somos Pontifical]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Francis connection==
[[Pope Francis]] from 1967 to 1970 studied theology at the Faculty of Theology "San José" School of San Miguel, where he had received a licentiate in philosophy and now received also a [[Licentiate of Sacred Theology|licentiate]] in theology. While master of novices at Villa Barilari in San Miguel (1972-1973) he served as a professor in the Faculty of Theology and rector of the College, until he became [[Provincial Superior]] of the Argentine Jesuits in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Biografía: ¿Quién es Jorge Bergoglio?|url=http://www.news.va/es/news/biografia-quien-es-jorge-mario-bergoglio|accessdate=8 May 2015|publisher=Vatican|date=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Feodor Felix Konrad Lynen''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Foreign Member of the Royal Society|ForMemRS]]}}&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt; (6 April 1911{{spaced ndash}}6 August 1979) was a [[Germany|German]] [[biochemist]]. In 1964 he won the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] together with [[Konrad Emil Bloch|Konrad Bloch]] for their discoveries concerning the mechanism and regulation of [[cholesterol]] and [[fatty acid metabolism]] while he was director of the Max-Planck Institute for Cellular Chemistry in Munich.

==Biography==
Feodor Lynen was born in [[Munich]] on 6 April 1911. He started his studies at the chemistry department of [[University of Munich|Munich University]] in 1930 and graduated in March 1937 under [[Heinrich Otto Wieland|Heinrich Wieland]] with the work: "On the Toxic Substances in Amanita". Lynen remained in Germany throughout World War II. In 1942 he became a chemistry lecturer at the [[University of Munich|Munich University]]. In 1947 he became an assistant professor and in 1953 a professor of biochemistry. From 1954 onwards he was director of the Max-Planck Institute for Cellular Chemistry in Munich, a position which was created for him at the instigation of two senior scientists, [[Otto Heinrich Warburg|Otto Warburg]] and [[Otto Hahn]]. In 1972, that institute was merged into the newly founded [[Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry|Max-Planck Institute of Biochemistry]] in 1972. Also in 1972, Lynen was named President of the [[Gesellschaft Deutscher Chemiker]] (GDCh).&lt;ref name=lynen-nobel-bio&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1964/lynen-bio.html |title= Feodor Lynen &amp;mdash; Biographical |accessdate= 2013-11-13 |publisher= Nobel Media AB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964 he won the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] together with [[Konrad Emil Bloch|Konrad Bloch]] for their discoveries concerning the mechanism and regulation of [[cholesterol]] and [[fatty acid metabolism]]. These discoveries took many years to work out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bucher NL, Overath P, Lynen F |title=beta-Hydroxy-beta-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase, cleavage and condensing enzymes in relation to cholesterol formation in rat liver |journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta |volume=40 |issue= |pages=491–501 |date=June 1960 |pmid=13805544 |doi=10.1016/0006-3002(60)91390-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lynen F |title=The biochemical basis of the biosynthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids |language=German |journal=Wiener Klinische Wochenschrift |volume=78 |issue=27 |pages=489–97 |date=July 1966 |pmid=4296920}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Back P, Hamprecht B, Lynen F |title=Regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis in rat liver: diurnal changes of activity and influence of bile acids |journal=Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics |volume=133 |issue=1 |pages=11–21 |date=August 1969 |pmid=5810824 |doi=10.1016/0003-9861(69)90482-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hamprecht B, Nüssler C, Waltinger G, Lynen F |title=Influence of bile acids on the activity of rat liver 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase. 1.

Working mostly separately, Lynen and Bloch both discovered the steps that created squalene and turned the squalene into cholesterol. Initially, Lynen found that acetate activated by Coenzyme A was needed to start the process. He discovered the chemical structure of acetyl-coenzyme A, which was needed for a detailed understanding of the biochemical pathways.&lt;ref name=faq-lynen /&gt; He also learned that [[biotin]], or Vitamin B7, was needed for in the process.&lt;ref name=lynen&gt;{{cite web |last=Lynen |first= Fyodor |title= The pathway from 'activated acetic acid' to the terpenes and fatty acids |date=1964-12-11  |publisher= Nobel Media AB }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 May 1937, Lynen married Eva Wieland (1915-2002), daughter of his academic teacher. They had five children between 1938 and 1946.&lt;ref name=lynen-nobel-bio /&gt; Feodor Lynen died in Munich, Germany, on 6 August 1979, six weeks after an operation for aneurism.&lt;ref name=faq-lynen /&gt;

==Fellowship==
The [[Alexander von Humboldt Foundation]] has a fellowship named in his honor.

'''Free Geek''' was founded as  a [[non-profit organization]] by Oso Martin, and launched on Earth Day 2000 as part of a community-wide public event at Pioneer Courthouse Square in downtown [[Portland, Oregon]]. In September of that year Free Geek opened the doors to their facility on Southeast 10th Avenue as a recycling/reuse dropoff for electronic waste. In January 2001, The ''[[The Oregonian|Oregonian]]'' ran an article advertising their free computer program for volunteers, which immediately became so successful that they had to start a waiting list. They currently have over 2,000 active volunteers per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=MacKinnon | first=Merry |title=Computer nerds, and proud of it |url=http://wiki.freegeek.org/index.php/Lifestyles_Northwest_article |work= Lifestyles Northwest |date=March 2006 |accessdate=2006-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Pete | last=Forsyth |authorlink=wikisource:en:Author:Pete Forsyth|title=[[wikisource:en:Free Software, Older Computers Help Group Narrow Digital Divide|Free software, older computers help group narrow digital divide]]  |work=The Portland Tribune |date=May 4, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the past 17 years, Free Geek has expanded to fill its 22,000 square-foot home and grown into a community education hub, adding classes, internships, outreach programs, and free technology to low-income individuals and nonprofits to their ongoing commitment to sustainable reuse and recycling. Since their founding, they have:
* Diverted over '''1.3 million items''' from landfills.
* Received over '''900,000''' hours of volunteer experience from '''35,000''' individuals.
* Granted over '''72,620''' technology devices to nonprofits, schools, community change organizations, and individuals, including over '''10,000''' computers to volunteers and students in exchange for community service.

==Activities==
[[File:Freegeek1.jpg|thumb|Entrance to the Portland Free Geek during Geek Fair]]

Free Geek offers a wide range of free classes to its volunteers and to the general public. These classes generally fall into a few major categories including basic computer use, advanced computer courses, digital arts creation, digital nativity/online safety, and workplace readiness.  Free Geek also offers phone and drop-in [[technical support]] on specific days of the week for the computers it produces.

=== Programs ===
People who wish to [[Volunteering|volunteer]] at Free Geek's [[community technology center]] usually choose between two programs: the Build Program and the Adoption Program. The Adoption Program allows volunteers to get to work immediately on relatively simple tasks, such as keeping incoming equipment organized or sorting metals and plastics. In the Build Program, volunteers learn while they work, and are trained to build refurbished computers. Volunteers completing the Adoption Program are given a computer after 24 hours of volunteering (one free computer per year)&lt;ref&gt;free geek volunteer

http://www.freegeek.org/#volunteer
&lt;/ref&gt; while the Build Program volunteers get to keep the sixth computer they build.&lt;ref&gt;Free Geek Build Program, Free Geek Website {{cite web |url=http://www.freegeek.org/volunteer/build-program/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130414184859/http://www.freegeek.org/volunteer/build-program/ |archivedate=2013-04-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:AHP FG S1 HR-033.jpg|thumb|Photo Credit: Angela Holm Photography]]
Free Geek has numerous other programs, which are generally run by interns, longer-serving volunteers and staff members. A few examples: The Hardware Grants program reviews requests for computer equipment from schools, churches, non-profit and community change organizations. The Reuse program works to ensure that reuse is prioritized over recycling, and finds new ways to get equipment into the hands of people who will put it to use. The Technocrats oversee the network infrastructure of the organization.

====Recycling, Reuse &amp; Resale====

Free Geek is committed to keeping Oregon green.  Raw materials are processed by volunteers in their warehouse, where approximately 40% of it is restored into usable technology.  Some of it is sold, either online or in their Southeast Portland store, where proceeds support educational and outreach programs.  Any materials which cannot be reused are recycled to the highest ethical, safety and sustainability standards, preventing it from entering our waste stream and poisoning the environment.  Free Geek also donates refurbished computers and technology directly back into the community; in 2017, for example, Free Geek was able to give away six laptop computers for every ten sold in the Free Geek Store. In 2016 Free Geek donated 4,400 refurbished items of technology back to the community, providing free computers to low-income individuals, schools and nonprofit partners throughout the [[Portland metropolitan area|Portland Metro]] area and beyond.

====Hardware Grant Program====

Free Geek is committed to providing free technology equipment and support to organizations working hard to make the [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] community a better place.  The Hardware Grant Program connects qualifying [[Nonprofit organization|nonprofits]] and schools with refurbished [[desktop computer]]s, [[laptop]]s, printers, and other equipment.  Since their inception, they have granted more than 10,500 items to a total of over 2,000 nonprofits such as [[Black Lives Matter|Black Lives Matter (Vancouver, WA)]], Bradley-Angle House, [[Habitat for Humanity]], Hacienda CDC, Home Forward, KBOO Community Radio, Northwest Children's Theatre and School, Oxford House and [[Street Roots]].  60% of grantees are based in the [[Portland metropolitan area|Portland Metro area]]; between 2012 and 2017, 25% of hardware grants went to schools or educational nonprofits, 18% to human services, 13% to arts &amp; culture, 10% to community development, and the rest to a host of other sectors such as civil rights, [[animal welfare]], [[health]], [[faith-based organization]]s, and the [[Environmental organization|environment]].

====Volunteers &amp; Internships====

Volunteers are the backbone of work at Free Geek, making the massive e-waste recycling operation possible.  Since the founding in 2000,  over 20,500 volunteers passed through the doors. In 2016 alone, over 2,000 active volunteers and interns gave more than 47,500 hours of their time to Free Geek.

The Volunteer Adoption Program offers a free computer to every volunteer after 24 hours of volunteer time. Each year Free Geek disburses around 550 computers (complete with monitor, speakers, keyboard, and mouse) specifically to volunteers who have completed their 24 hours of service. Many  volunteers are low-income individuals who otherwise would not have the opportunity to own their own computer.  To ensure that everyone has equal access, Free Geek works with each volunteer to accommodate a wide range of abilities, offering opportunities for people of all ages, from youth to senior citizens; of all backgrounds and experience levels, including those with little to no previous computer experience; volunteers in wheelchairs, with physical disabilities or with other specific accessibility needs; volunteers with developmental disabilities or who are on the autism spectrum or otherwise non-neurotypical; and volunteers who are most comfortable communicating in Spanish.

Free Geek also offers custom-tailored 3- to 6-month internship programs for skilled volunteers 16 years and up, designed to help develop vital job skills to help them pursue tech sector careers and make connections in the community.

====Plug Into Portland====

Founded in 2014, Plug Into Portland grew out of a collaborative partnership between Free Geek and [[Portland Public Schools (Oregon)|Portland Public Schools]], which expanded in 2017 to cover other Metro-area school districts such as [[Washington County, Oregon|Washington]], [[Reynolds School District (Oregon)|Reynolds]], [[David Douglas School District|David Douglas]], and the [[Vancouver, Washington|Vancouver, WA]] area. This program addresses the digital literacy gap which hinders low-income K-12 students’ inability to learn because they do not have access to a computer at home.  Students who volunteer for a total of 24 hours at any nonprofit organization in their community receive a free computer from Free Geek.  Plug Into Portland is focused on quickly and easily getting computers into family homes, allowing students access to the technology they need to succeed in school and the means for their families to be involved in that success.  This program served approximately 100 low-income students and families in 2016.

====Earn-a-Computer====

According to a 2014 Broadband Adoption Survey,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.portlandoregon.gov/revenue/article/501556|title=Oregon Broadband Adoption Report|last=|first=|date=|website=www.portlandoregon.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; at least 15% of Portland-area residents do not have internet access at home, while at least 10% do not even have access to a computer.  This population largely consists of vulnerable and at-risk communities: low-income families, youth, seniors, people of color, immigrants and refugees, people with disabilities, and English language learners.  Lack of basic computer skills puts these populations at a stark disadvantage. In 2016, in partnership with the Multnomah County Library and a diverse group of community partners – including MetroEast Community Media, Home Forward, Human Solutions, Hacienda CDC, The Olseth Family Foundation, and NTEN (the Nonprofit Technology Network) – Free Geek launched the first cohort of our Earn-a-Computer (EAC) program, a five-week culturally-specific digital literacy curriculum designed to bring these vital skills directly into the communities who need them most and have least access to them.

Free Geek works with low-income housing community partners to identify and recruit cohorts of ten residents at a time, primarily elderly and immigrant populations who have little to no experience with computers.  They offer as many options as possible to eliminate potential barriers to access and learning; they serve participants in their own neighborhoods, provide free food and childcare when needed, and offer both class instruction and written support materials in multiple languages, including English, Spanish, Kurdish, Somali and Russian. Over the course of four classes, participants learn to navigate the web, send their first email, and access ongoing resources like computer classes at the library and Free Geek.  Each participant receives a free personal computer; during the final class, they help familiarize participants with their new technology, show them how to access free tech support from Free Geek, and make referrals to low-cost internet services.

In its first year, EAC provided over 1,500 teaching hours to over 150 students, grouped in cohorts of ten to allow for personalized instruction.  Of those students, 87% were English language learners, 54% had no high school diploma or GED, and 95% had a household income of less than $30,000.

====Community Education====

Free Geek offers a wide and diverse range of free educational offerings that demystify technology and empower the community with the technology skills they need to succeed in all areas of life.  Community partners in this work include ChickTech, [[Girls, Inc.|Girls Inc]]., [[Impact NW]], Oregon City Public Library, PLUG (Portland Linux-Unix Group) and Thinkful, who provide classes and workshops to participants in Free Geek’s educational programs.  In basic digital literacy classes, Free Geek  and volunteer instructors help individuals reach their own goals with technology; in more specialized offerings, Free Geek fosters the imagination of community members, sparks their interest in technology, and builds confidence that anyone can learn and work with computers.  Current classes and workshops include such topics as "Anatomy of a Computer," programming with JavaScript and Python, web development, social media for organizations, data science, digital privacy and safety, graphic design and digital art.  in 2016 Free Geek served nearly 1,700 students with over 4,000 classroom hours of instruction.

==Free software==
Free Geek's refurbished computers run Linux Mint, Ubuntu or other [[free and open-source software]]. The use of free software has several major benefits to the organization, and to the recipients of equipment: Free Geek operates without needing to devote resources to managing [[software license]]s, and may install software where it is needed with minimal complications from legal considerations; and computer recipients get a wide range of software, which they may easily expand without paying money or entering into restrictive contracts.

Free Geek was the joint winner of the first Chris Nicol FOSS Prize awarded by the [[Association for Progressive Communications]] (APC) in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Free Geek has been keeping the needy nerdy for seven full years|work=APCNews|url=http://www.apc.org/en/node/1862/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Locations==
In addition to Portland, a number of other cities have started their own Free Geek organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freegeek.org/about/intergalactic/ Free Geek Intergalactic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091014132010/http://www.freegeek.org/about/intergalactic/ |date=2009-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4199">'''History Trek: A Canadian History Site''' is a [[bilingual]] ([[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]]) [[web portal]] made for children, containing reliable sources about [[History of Canada|Canadian history]]. It was developed by researchers at [[McGill University]] with the help of students who ranged from 9 to 12 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;Large, A., Beheshti, J., Nesset V., &amp; Bowler, L., 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/ref&gt; This is an example of an [[intergenerational]] design team, directly involving a sample of their user population within their team.&lt;ref&gt;Large, A., Beheshti, J., Nesset V., &amp; Bowler, L., 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, History Trek was designed "by children for children".&lt;ref&gt;Large, A., Beheshti, J., Nesset V., &amp; Bowler, L., 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;7.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
The development of History Trek was funded by the [[Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada]] and took place between 2002 and 2007.&lt;ref name="Large &amp; Beheshti, 2007"&gt;Large &amp; Beheshti, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The intergenerational design team, called the "Web Wonders", consisted of McGill researchers and a sample of student users. This design "team was led by Andrew Large and Jamshid Beheshti"&lt;ref name="Large &amp; Beheshti, 2007" /&gt; whose primary goal was to make an informational portal website that children would both want to use and know how to use. Potential users were included in the History Trek development process to determine the visual design, use of terminology, and methods of information retrieval.&lt;ref&gt;Large, A., Beheshti, J., Nesset, V., &amp; Bowler, L., 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods of information retrieval ==

Based on the research done during development, and in order to support both information retrieval and browsing, History Trek incorporated four methods to retrieve information:
* Keyword search
* Advanced search
* Topic search
* Alphabetical search{{#tag:ref|Research conducted after History Trek was implemented indicated that the Topic Search (42%) and Alphabetical Search (41%) were the most popular, followed by the Keyword Search (15%) and Advanced Search (3%).&lt;ref&gt;Beheshti, J., Large, A., &amp; Tam, M., 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;395-396.&lt;/ref&gt;|group="nb"}}

The '''"Carl Maria von Weber" College of Music''' ('''Hochschule für Musik "Carl Maria von Weber"''' in German, and also/formerly known as Dresden Conservatory or Dresden Royal Conservatory) is a  [[College or university school of music|college of music]] in [[Dresden]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=Hochschule für Musik - Dresden Music Festival | url=http://www.musikfestspiele.com/cms/index.php?id=660| publisher= | date= | accessdate=17 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Hochschule opened on 1 February 1856 and is one of the oldest German conservatoires. [[Francesco Morlacchi]], [[Carl Maria von Weber]] and [[Richard Wagner]] made reference to the necessity of establishing institutional training for musicians in Dresden. On 1 February 1856, a violinist of the Royal Orchestra, Friedrich Tröstler, founded the first music school in Dresden. In 1881 the title "royal" was granted, and it changed its name to "Royal Conservatoire", although it was a private institution.&lt;ref name="Dresden Study Abroad Program"&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=Dresden Study Abroad Program | url=http://www.capital.edu/14980/| publisher= | date= | accessdate=17 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1881 till 1918 was an institution under royal patronage and from 1937 onwards under the municipal authority. The original building of the hochschule was destroyed during World War II and all teaching activities were moved to Mendelssohnalle 34. At first the university was an educational institution where the future instrumentalists of the town’s orchestra were trained. It became the Hochschule für Musik; named after [[Carl Maria von Weber]] in 1959.&lt;ref name="Dresden Study Abroad Program"/&gt;

== Studies ==
All [[orchestral music|orchestral instruments]], [[singing|voice]], [[piano]], [[conducting]], [[composer|composition]], [[music theory]] and [[accompaniment]], as well as popular music/jazz/rock specialties can be studied at the College.  Particular emphasis is placed on the education of singers and orchestral musicians. This is because of the especial relationship of the school and the [[Semperoper]], [[Dresden Staatskapelle|Staatskapelle Dresden]], and the [[Dresden Philharmonic|Dresden Philharmonic Orchestra]]. The formation of singers and orchestral musicians was strongly determined by members of the Saxon State Opera, The Staatskapelle and Philharmonic orchestras working as teachers on an honorary basis. There are c. 250 public events organized and realized by students and staff and guests lecturers every year.&lt;ref name="Dresden Study Abroad Program"/&gt;

==Facilities==
The Hochschule occupies two buildings in the metropolitan area of Dresden: the main building at 13 Wettiner Platz and the other on Blochmannstraße. The main building has all the facilities of a modern conservatoire, a large recital hall and several smaller ones, rehearsal and practice rooms, teaching studios, a canteen, a library and offices. A new extension to the main building, finished in 2008, houses a new 450-seat concert hall and several rehearsal and teaching rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title= Konzertsaal der Hochschule für Musik Carl Maria v. Weber| url=http://hammeskrause.info/xml/projekte.php5?id=7&amp;bild=1 | publisher= Hammes Krause Architects| date= | accessdate=17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public performances==
With more than 300 public concerts and opera performances every year, the Hochschule contributes greatly to the region’s cultural life and offers its students at the same time a practical artistic training. Regular artistic projects are realized especially by the [[Opera]] Class and the bigger ensembles like the hochschule's [[Symphony Orchestra]], the School's [[Choir]] and the [[Bigband]]. The special image of the Dresden University of Music is fundamentally shaped by the close connection to Dresden’s two big orchestras, the [[Sächsische Staatskapelle Dresden]] and the [[Dresden Philharmonic Orchestra]]. Furthermore the Opera Class has a location at its disposal, which enables performances under professional conditions.

==High School of Music "Carl Maria von Weber"==
Founded in 1965, but working as a different organization since 1945, the '''High School of Music "Carl Maria Von Weber"''' ('''Sächsisches Landesgymnasium für Musik "Carl Maria von Weber"''' in German) is a [[music school|specialist music school]] for school-age children, located in [[Dresden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=Sächsisches Landesgymnasium für Musik CARL MARIA VON WEBER Dresden| url=http://www.hfmdd.de/index.php?id=72| publisher=Hochschule für Musik, Dresden | date= | accessdate=11 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school imparts the regular school program but great emphasis is put on individual music training, music theory classes and orchestral playing. Most instrumental teachers are also professors at the Hochschule für Musik "Carl Maria von Weber" or play in one of the professional orchestras of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=Geschichte| url=http://www.landesmusikgymnasium.de/index.php?id=15| publisher=Sächsisches Landesgymnasium für Musik | date= | accessdate=11 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The president of the school is the English [[conducting|conductor]] [[Sir Colin Davis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=Schirmherr: sir Colin Davis| url=http://www.landesmusikgymnasium.de/index.php?id=58| publisher= | date= | accessdate=11 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous patrons include [[Sir Yehudi Menuhin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=Polifonia Pre-college Working Group Site visit Report | url=http://aecsite.cramgo.nl/DownloadView.aspx?ses=9765| publisher=Polifonia| date= | accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4261">The '''Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia''' ({{lang-ca|Institut d'Arquitectura Avançada de Catalunya, IAAC}}; {{IPA-ca|instiˈtud dəɾkitəkˈtuɾə əβənˈsaðə ðə kətəˈluɲə|IPA}}) is an educational and research centre dedicated to the development of an architecture capable of meeting the worldwide challenges in the construction of habitability in the early 21st century.

Based in the [[22@]] district of Barcelona, one of the world’s capitals of architecture and urbanism, IAAC is a platform for the exchange of knowledge with faculty and students from over 40 countries,
including United States, China, India, [[Poland]], Italy, Norway, Mexico and [[Sudan]]. Students work simultaneously on multiple scales (city, building, manufacturing) and in different areas of expertise (ecology, energy, digital manufacturing, new technologies), pursuing their own lines of enquiry on the way to developing an integrated set of skills with which to act effectively in their home country or globally.

IAAC has carried out research projects in [[Brazil]], [[Taiwan]], [[Croatia]] and [[Romania]]. In 2008 it was chosen to take part in the official section of the [[Venice Biennale]] with the project Hyperhabitat and in 2010 it presented a 1:1 scale house (entirely produced at IAAC) at the [[Solar Decathlon Europe]] in [[Madrid]] where it won the Peoples Choice Award. IAAC has the most advanced digital production laboratory of any educational institution in southern Europe, with laser cutters, 3D printers, milling machines and a platform for manufacturing chips.

IAAC offers two Master courses one in Advanced Architecture, and another in Advanced Interactions courses are in conjunction with the [[Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya|UPC Polytechnic University]] in addition to the Open Thesis Fabrication course. Masters is open to Masters architecture students from around the world. In addition to IAAC masters, there is the Fab Academy, offered by [[Fab Lab Barcelona]] which is hosted by IAAC, while being part of the global network of Fab Labs affiliated to MIT’s Center for Bit and Atoms.

Since 2004 the IAAC has run the Self-Sufficient Housing and Self-Fab House design competitions, and later this year will present the Your City 2109 competition with the aim of generating new paradigms for architecture and the construction of the city in this time of change.

==Vision==
Located in [[Barcelona]], one of the international capitals of [[Urbanism]], the institution develops a multidisciplinary program that explores urban and international territorial phenomena, placing especial emphasis on the opportunities that emerges from developing countries and the cultural, economic and social values that architecture may contribute to society.

==Objectives==
The main objective of the Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia is to stimulate, promote and develop research on the diverse areas of advanced architecture promoting the development of knowledge in architecture and its interaction with other disciplines.

==Curriculum==
Some of the most important projects and publications done by '''Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia''' recently are [https://web.archive.org/web/20070718214321/http://www.hipercatalunya.org/ Hipercatalunya] (a research about the territory of Catalonia) The Media House (a project developed with the [http://www.media.mit.edu/ MIT's Media Lab]) and the  [https://web.archive.org/web/20070908003759/http://www.metapolis.com/ Metapolis] Dictionary of Advanced Architecture.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2755">The '''International Confederation of Principals''' (ICP) is a global association of [[school]] leadership organisations. 

ICP was founded in 1991, and operates through a council with up to three delegates from each member organisation. This meets three times in a two-year period. Council elects an executive committee to work with and support the elected president of ICP, an executive secretary services both executive and council. ICP has over 40 members, each member being a major independent organisation that supports the professional development and work of school leaders. 
The ICP represents school leaders across five continents; it is non-political and non-sectarian and gives a powerful international voice to school principals. Membership is open to any organisation of school leaders whose constitution contains nothing contrary to the constitution of the ICP.

The ICP Constitution has the following major goals:
# Encourage closer relationships between school leaders of all nations;
# Promote and enhance the image and professionalism of school leaders;
# Promote the exchange of people and professional publications among the constituent groups and encourage participation in meetings and conferences across national boundaries;
# Foster school curricula that encourages international understanding and goodwill, and a respect for the human rights and dignity across all races and cultures;
# Promote the right and responsibilities of school leaders, and also their professional organisations, and the material and ethical interests of the education profession;
# Promote and encourage equal opportunities for all young persons to learn and develop to their fullest potential in achieving a respectable and productive quality of life;

The '''John Darwin disappearance case''' was an investigation into the [[faked death]] of the [[British people|British]] former teacher and prison officer John Darwin. Darwin turned up alive in December 2007, five years after he was believed to have died in a canoeing accident.

John Darwin was arrested and charged with [[fraud]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/12/08/john.darwin/?iref=hpmostpop] CNN&lt;/ref&gt; His wife, Anne, was also arrested and charged for helping Darwin to collect his [[life insurance]] of £25,000. The fraudulent death also allowed the couple to pay off their £130,000 mortgage. In December 2007, after it was revealed the couple had been photographed together in Panama a year earlier, Anne confessed to knowing Darwin was alive. Anne admitted that he had been secretly living in their house and the house next door, which allowed him to get the [[insurance fraud|insurance money illegally]] for his own [[Gain (accounting)|personal gain]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=500455&amp;in_page_id=1770&amp;ct=5] Daily Mail&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 July 2008 John and Anne Darwin were each sentenced to over six years' imprisonment.&lt;ref name=jail&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/tees/7520803.stm|title= John &amp; Anne Darwin sentenced to jail|publisher=BBC| date=23 July 2008|accessdate=24 July 2008|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
John Darwin was born on 14 August 1950, in [[Hartlepool]], [[County Durham]].&lt;ref name="dailymail2" /&gt; He attended [[St Francis Roman Catholic Grammar School|St Francis RC Grammar School]] and [[Pendleton Sixth Form College|De La Salle College, Salford]], [[Lancashire]], where he studied biology and chemistry.&lt;ref name=educ&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,2221193,00.html?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=11|publisher=The Guardian|date=2007-12-03|accessdate=2007-12-10|title=Detectives to question long-lost canoeist | location=London | first=Aidan | last=Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 December 1973, John Darwin married Anne Stephenson in [[Blackhall, County Durham|Blackhall]].&lt;ref name=hartlepool1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hartlepoolmail.co.uk/johndarwinmissingcanoeist/An-unexpected-anniversary--.3568967.jp|publisher=Hartlepool Mail|date=2007-12-08|accessdate=2007-12-11|title=An unexpected anniversary...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin then taught science and mathematics&lt;ref name=myst&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,2222143,00.html|publisher=The Guardian|date=2007-12-05|accessdate=2007-12-10|title=Canoe mystery man arrested for fraud | location=London | first=Matthew | last=Weaver
}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Derwentside]] for 18 years before leaving to join [[Barclays]] Bank. He later became a prison officer at [[HM Prison Holme House]].&lt;ref name=educ/&gt; He and his wife, a doctor's receptionist, also ran a business renting [[bedsit]]s in County Durham with 12 houses. They ran into debt after purchasing two houses in [[Seaton Carew]] in December 2000. The debts, amounting to "tens of thousands of [[Pound sterling|pounds]]",&lt;ref name="MailCon"&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=500455&amp;in_page_id=1770&amp;ct=5 Canoe widow's full confession] Daily Mail 8 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; caused Darwin to talk about faking his own death to claim the insurance by early 2002.

==Disappearance==
John Darwin was seen paddling out to sea in his canoe on 21 March 2002, at Seaton Carew, in Hartlepool.&lt;ref name="bbc3"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sea search for Missing Canoeist|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1887151.stm|date=2002-03-22|accessdate=2007-12-09|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later the same day, he was reported as "missing" after failing to report to work. A large-scale sea search took place,&lt;ref name="bbc3"/&gt; during which {{Convert|62|sqmi|abbr=out}} of coastline were searched. There was no sign of Darwin,&lt;ref name="bbc3"/&gt; though a double-ended paddle was retrieved from the sea near Seaton Carew, the following day. Later on 22 March 2002, the wreckage of John Darwin's canoe was found.&lt;ref name="hartlepool3"&gt;{{cite web|title=Missing Canoeist - Wreck is Found|url=http://www.hartlepoolmail.co.uk/news/MISSING-CANOEIST--WRECK-IS.611443.jp|date=2002-05-08|accessdate=2007-12-14|publisher=Hartlepool Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[North Sea]] was unusually calm and rescuers had been puzzled that Darwin could have got into trouble in such conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.martinfrost.ws/htmlfiles/dec2007/lostin_panama.html The 'dead' canoeist John Darwin, his wife and the Panama connection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026091302/http://martinfrost.ws/htmlfiles/dec2007/lostin_panama.html |date=26 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Missing years==
During the years that Darwin was presumed dead, he lived for some time in a [[bedsit]] next door to the family home; he then secretly moved back in with his wife Anne in February 2003. Meanwhile, a death certificate was issued stating that John Darwin had died on 21 March 2002.&lt;ref name="dailymail2"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=499889&amp;in_page_id=1770|  title=Revealed: The document that shows Darwin was officially dead| publisher=Daily Mail| accessdate=2007-12-09 | location=London | date=2007-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed his wife to claim his life insurance; it is alleged that £25,000 was paid out from Unat Direct Insurance Management Limited (part of the [[American International Group|AIG]] insurance group)&lt;ref name=bbc5&gt;{{cite news|title=Court remands canoeist in custody|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7136208.stm|date=2007-12-10|accessdate=2007-12-10|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a much larger amount which paid off the £130,000 mortgage.&lt;ref name="newsoftheworld1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Darwin's bolt hole |url=http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/0912_darwin.shtml |date=2007-12-09 |accessdate=2007-12-09 |publisher=News of The World |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210010251/http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/0912_darwin.shtml |archivedate=10 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometime that year, a tenant of the block of bedsit flats that the Darwins owned, Lee Wadrop, recognised Darwin and asked him "Aren't you supposed to be dead?" to which Darwin replied "Don't tell anyone about this". Wadrop later said that he had not told the police because he "did not want to get involved".&lt;ref name="telegraph3"&gt;{{cite news | title = Canoe man's wife lands back in Britain | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/12/09/ncanoe309.xml | date = 2007-12-09 | accessdate = 2007-12-09 | publisher = Telegraph.co.uk | location=London | first1=Jasper | last1=Copping | first2=Ben | last2=Leach | first3=Patrick | last3=Sawer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the Darwin couple decided to move abroad, considering [[Cyprus]]. John Darwin applied for, and obtained a passport using the false name "John Jones", but using his true home address.&lt;ref name="times1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Canoe Man and Canoe Wife — Sunk|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1692989,00.html|date=2007-12-09|accessdate=2007-12-09|publisher=Time / CNN | first=Alex | last=Altman}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2004, the couple visited Cyprus to investigate buying property there.

In May 2005, an angler, Matt Autie, claimed to have met John Darwin—who was going under the name "John Williams"—at a lake near [[Penzance]], [[Cornwall]].&lt;ref name="telegraph4"&gt;{{cite news | title = 'Dead' canoeist used a fake passport | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/12/08/ncanoe208.xml | date = 2007-12-08 | accessdate = 2007-12-09 | publisher = Telegraph.co.uk | location=London | first=Nick | last=Allen}}&lt;/ref&gt; When back at home, Darwin is reported to have spent most of his time on the Internet where he encountered a woman from [[Kansas]] in the United States whom he flew out to meet. By November, Darwin was back in the UK and flew from [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] to [[Gibraltar]], and then travelled to [[El Puerto de Santa María]] to view a £45,000, {{convert|42|ft|adj=on|spell=in}} [[catamaran]] that he was considering buying from boat dealer Robert Hopkin.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/topstories/2007/12/07/john-darwin-s-fake-passport-trip-89520-20216483/ John Darwin's fake passport trip] Daily Mirror Stewart Maclean 07/12/2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 March 2006, Darwin is reported to have signed a planning objection to a neighbour's building work using a false name. Darwin and his wife began to consider [[Panama]] as a possible destination. The couple flew from Newcastle to Panama on 14 July 2006, where they were photographed by a Panamanian property agent, and the resulting photograph was posted on the Internet. In February 2007, they spent a further week in Panama.{{fact|date=October 2016}} Newspapers from February 2007 were later found in the boarded-up gap between the Darwins' house and the bedsit where Darwin had hidden. In March 2007, the couple returned to Panama and formed a company called Jaguar Properties in order to buy a two-bedroom apartment in El Dorado for £50,000. The bedsit house next to the family home was sold under the name of the Darwins' son, Mark; the home had been transferred to Mark Darwin in 2006. The proceeds from the sale were then transferred to Panama.&lt;ref name="dailymail4"&gt;{{cite news|title='Back from the dead' canoeist's son flees leaving 'coded' message for his girlfriend|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-500025/Back-dead-canoeists-son-flees-leaving-coded-message-girlfriend.html|date=2007-12-06|accessdate=2007-12-09|publisher=Daily Mail | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following month, Anne Darwin returned to the UK to sell her home while John Darwin remained in Panama. In May 2007, the couple purchased a £200,000 tropical estate in the village of [[Escobal]], [[Colón, Panama|Colón]], Panama, near the [[Panama Canal]], with the intention of building a hotel from where canoeing holidays could be run. In a later interview with John Darwin, published in Elizabeth Greenwood's book ''Playing Dead'', he states that the canoe-rental aspect of this purchase was a story entirely fabricated by the media playing on the romanticism of his faked death. He and Anne Darwin visited Panama again in July 2007, staying for six weeks.&lt;ref name="dailymail4"/&gt; A police investigation was started in September when a colleague of Anne Darwin became suspicious upon overhearing a phone conversation between the couple.&lt;ref name=hartlepool2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hartlepoolmail.co.uk/johndarwinmissingcanoeist/EXCLUSIVE-Overheard-phone-call-led.3561417.jp|publisher=Hartlepool Mail|date=2007-12-06|accessdate=2007-12-11|title=EXCLUSIVE: Overheard phone call led to investigation }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Darwin family home was sold for £295,000 in October 2007 and Anne Darwin subsequently left for Panama. In the third week of November, the couple holidayed in [[Costa Rica]] before returning to Panama. On 30 November 2007, Mrs Darwin bought an airline ticket for her husband to England because "he was missing his sons". On the same day, their son Mark left his property firm after working his notice period.&lt;ref name="dailymail4"/&gt;

==Return and arrest==
Following a change in Panama's visa laws, John Darwin emailed Anne on 14 June 2007 to notify her that their identities would have to be verified by UK police in order for them to receive now-required Panamanian "investors' visas." Knowing that his John Jones alias would not pass this level of scrutiny, Darwin decided to return to the United Kingdom under his real name and fake [[amnesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2448817/Why-canoeist-John-Darwin-came-back-from-the-dead.html|title=Why canoeist John Darwin came back from the dead|first=Paul Stokes and Nigel|last=Bunyan|date=23 July 2008|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 December 2007, Darwin walked into the [[West End of London|West End]] Central police station in London, claiming to have no memory of the past five years. His wife Anne—who had sold up her British properties and moved to Panama three months before his re-appearance—expressed surprise, joy and elation at the return of her missing husband.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.martinfrost.ws/htmlfiles/dec2007/darwin_admits.html Richard Edwards, Paul Stokes and Tom Leonard.

The Darwins' cover story unravelled after the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' published a photo of John and Anne, taken in Panama in 2006. The photograph had been discovered when a member of the public searched for the words "John", "Anne" and "Panama" in [[Google Images]]. The photo had been featured on the website movetopanama.com and was brought to the attention of the ''Daily Mirror'' and the [[Cleveland Police]].&lt;ref name=guardian2&gt;{{cite news|first=Matthew|last=Weaver|title=Woman found canoeist photo via Google|url=https://www.theguardian.com/crime/article/0,,2223073,00.html|date=2007-12-06|accessdate=2007-12-08|publisher=Guardian Unlimited | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anne reportedly confirmed that the photograph was of John, saying "Yes, that's him. My sons will never forgive me."&lt;ref name=guardian1&gt;{{cite news|title=Wife confronted with Panama photo |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uklatest/story/0,,-7130684,00.html |date=2007-12-06 |accessdate=2007-12-08 |publisher=Guardian Unlimited |location=London |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080103232911/http://www.guardian.co.uk/uklatest/story/0%2C%2C-7130684%2C00.html |archivedate= 3 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The police then arrested Darwin at his son Anthony's house in [[Basingstoke]].

A police investigation discovered that John Darwin had been using a false passport by the name of "John Jones", an identity that had belonged to a baby from [[Sunderland]] who had died in 1950.&lt;ref name=telegraph2&gt;{{cite news|first=Nick|last=Allen|title='Dead' canoeist used a fake passport|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/12/08/ncanoe208.xml|date=2007-12-08|accessdate=2007-12-08 | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,30100-1296707,00.html|title=Did Darwin Steal Dead Baby's Name? (Sky News)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique featured in the 1971 novel ''[[The Day of the Jackal]]'' by [[Frederick Forsyth]]. Upon examining the false passport, police found that Darwin had made several trips to Panama in the previous five years.

John Darwin's two sons initially expressed elation at the return of their father,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/tees/7130673.stm|title=Canoeist sons 'victims of scam'|date=6 December 2007|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; but as the story unfolded, they issued a joint statement stating they felt they had been victims of a scam and implying that they wished to have no further contact with their parents.&lt;ref name="dailymail4"/&gt; Both sons were reported to have changed their jobs prior to their father's reappearance. On 6 December, one of John Darwin's sons allegedly disappeared after clearing out his North London flat and leaving a notebook reportedly containing coded messages for his girlfriend, as well as directions for her to get to [[London City Airport]]. Police emphasised that he was not suspected of any crime.&lt;ref name=telegraph1&gt;{{cite news | first = Sally | last = Peck |author2=Leonard, Tom | title = Canoeist mystery: new twist as son disappears | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/12/06/ncanoe906.xml | date = 2007-12-07 | accessdate = 2007-12-08 | publisher = Telegraph.co.uk | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 December, the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' quoted Anne Darwin as saying that, although she initially thought her husband was dead, he turned up at their home in 2003 and secretly lived in an adjacent [[bedsit]] that she owned for about three years. He entered the home from the bedsit through a secret hole in the wall; the hole was hidden behind a wardrobe with a false back. The article stated that, two months after he had moved back in with Anne, she was persuaded to attend an inquest into his death so she could claim the life insurance. John was pronounced dead and the life insurance company paid only half of the £50,000 policy because no body had been found. Anne said he had faked his death to escape financial difficulties arising from properties they owned. She claimed that he had decided to return publicly because he missed his sons, who had not been aware he was still alive.&lt;ref name=dailymail1&gt;{{cite news|first=Natalie|last=Clarke|author2=Leigh, David|title=Canoe widow's full confession|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=500455&amp;in_page_id=1770&amp;ito=1490|date=2007-12-08|accessdate=2007-12-08|publisher=Daily Mail | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that day, Darwin was charged with [[insurance fraud|obtaining life insurance money by deception]] and [[Making false statements|making untrue statements]] to obtain a passport.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/tees/7134962.stm Police await canoeist wife move] BBC, 2007-12-09&lt;/ref&gt; Anne Darwin was arrested at [[Manchester Airport]] the following day upon returning to the UK, and detained in connection with the allegations of fraud.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/tees/7135079.stm Canoeist wife arrested back in UK] BBC, 2007-12-09&lt;/ref&gt; She appeared in court on 11 December in Hartlepool to face two charges of fraud—obtaining £25,000 and £137,000 by deception. She remained in custody until 14 December.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7137774.stm Canoeist wife remanded in custody ] BBC, 2007-12-11&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin appeared at Hartlepool Magistrates' Court on 10 December, where he was also remanded in custody until 14 December.&lt;ref name="bbc5"/&gt;

On 14 December, Anne and John Darwin appeared separately before Hartlepool [[Magistrates' court (England and Wales)|Magistrates' Court]] and they both were remanded in custody to appear again on 11 January 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7143965.stm|title=Christmas in prison for Darwins|date=14 December 2007|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 January 2008, John and Anne Darwin returned to Hartlepool Magistrates' Court to face further charges of deception. John faced an additional charge of obtaining £137,000 by deception (the same charge his wife was already facing) in addition to the existing life insurance charge against both of them for £25,000 and John's separate charge of obtaining a passport by deception. They were then both charged together from obtaining more money from a teachers' pension scheme (two separate amounts of £25,186 and £58,845), plus obtaining money from the [[Department for Work and Pensions]] (two separate amounts of £2,000 and £2,273). They were remanded in custody once more to appear in court again on 18 January 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/tees/7178497.stm|title=Further charges for canoe couple|date=5 January 2018|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 January, they each appeared separately at Hartlepool Magistrates' Court by video-link and were remanded in custody until 15 February, when they faced [[Committal procedure|committal]] to [[Crown Court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/tees/7195475.stm|title=Canoe couple remanded in custody|date=5 January 2018|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 March, John Darwin admitted seven charges of obtaining cash by deception and a passport offence at [[Leeds]] Crown Court. He denied nine charges of using criminal property; these charges will remain on file, according to prosecutors. Anne Darwin denied six charges of deception and nine of using criminal property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/tees/7293765.stm|title=Missing canoeist admits deception|date=13 March 2008|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sentencing==
On 23 July 2008, John Darwin and Anne Darwin were both convicted of fraud. John Darwin faced an additional charge relating to his fake passport and was sentenced to six years and three months in prison. Anne Darwin, who was described by the police as a [[Pathological lying|compulsive liar]], was sentenced to six years and six months.&lt;ref name=jail/&gt; Both appealed against their sentences&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/tees/7600222.stm |title=Canoeist appeals against sentence |date=2008-09-05 |accessdate=2008-09-05 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 27 March 2009, both appeals were denied by the Court of Appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/tees/7967603.stm |title=Canoe pair lose jail term appeals |date=2009-03-27 |accessdate=2008-03-27 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Crown Prosecution Service]] has vowed that all profits from the "callous and calculated" fraud committed by the couple will be confiscated.&lt;ref name="times-23jul2008"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article4384627.ece|title=John and Anne Darwin sentenced to total of more than 12 years in jail|last=Booth|first=Jenny|author2=Hines, Nico|date=23 July 2008|work=[[The Times]]|publisher=[[News Corporation]]|accessdate=4 December 2009|quote=Gale Gilchrist, a spokesman for the Crown Prosecution Service, said: ''"There is no doubt that this was a callous and calculated fraud ..."'' Ms Gilchrist said that prosecutors would be working with the police to make sure that the Darwins were forced to repay the proceeds of their crimes. | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Darwin was released on probation in January 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/8265683/Canoe-man-John-Darwin-walks-free-from-jail.html |title=Canoe man John Darwin walks free from jail |publisher=Daily Telegraph |date=18 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Anne Darwin was released in March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/mar/09/anne-darwin-released-canoe-disappearance |title=Anne Darwin released after serving time for canoe disappearance fraud |publisher=The Guardian |date=2011-03-09 |accessdate=2011-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 February 2012, the CPS announced that the entire £501,641.39 in life insurance and pension payouts received by Anne Darwin had been recovered, part of which involved the sale of two properties in Panama. Kingsley Hyland, head of the North East CPS Complex Casework Unit, said: "It is important that fraudsters see that not only will we prosecute them wherever possible, but we will also make every effort to retrieve their ill-gotten gains to return them to those they have defrauded."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tees-17031563|title=CPS recover £500k from canoe fraudster wife Anne Darwin|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=14 February 2012|accessdate=2012-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, it was reported that Darwin had repaid just £121 from the £679,073 that the judge had ordered him to repay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tees-26937700|title=Fake death conman John Darwin 'has repaid just £121'|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=8 April 2014|accessdate=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was because all the assets were in Anne Darwin's name. By July 2015, the pair no longer had any assets, having repaid a total of £541,762.39.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tees-33560815|title=Canoe fraudsters John and Anne Darwin 'have no assets'|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=16 July 2015|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The story of John and Anne Darwin was dramatised in the [[BBC Four]] programme ''Canoe Man'' in 2010. The film starred [[Bernard Hill]] and [[Saskia Reeves]] as John and Anne Darwin, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00rs2kc|title= Canoe Man|publisher= BBC Online|accessdate= 26 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Musician [[Martin Gordon]] documented the story with the song "Panama" from his 2009 release ''[[Time Gentlemen Please (album)|Time Gentlemen Please]]''. In fiction, it inspired a 2009 novel by Adrian Gere called ''Return from the Dead'',&lt;ref name="cp-02dec2009"&gt;{{cite news|title=Novel no 2 for grandad|date=2 December 2009|work=Croydon Post|publisher=[[Northcliffe Media]]|pages=13|quote=Adrian Gere, 70, was thrilled when he found out his new book Return from the Dead, inspired by John Darwin, aka the Canoe Man, was going to be printed by US Company [[PublishAmerica|Publish America]]... The names, locations and main storyline are completely different although there are some similarities with what really happened.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 2010 storyline in the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] [[soap opera]] ''[[Coronation Street]]'' saw the character [[Joe McIntyre (Coronation Street)|Joe McIntyre]] attempt the same thing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hartlepoolmail.co.uk/news/corrie-s-joe-set-to-do-a-darwin-1-987192|title=Corrie's Joe 'set to do a Darwin'|website=www.hartlepoolmail.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, it was mentioned in the [[BBC]] soap opera ''[[EastEnders]]'' when it was revealed that the character [[Kathy Beale]] and her husband faked their deaths in South Africa for insurance payouts. The song "Simian Son" by [[Jez Lowe]] concerning incidents in Hartlepool references the incident. The 2018 novel ''Let Me Lie'' by [[Clare Mackintosh]] in which a husband and wife apparently commit suicide was inspired by the John Darwin story, mentioned by the Author in the Authors Notes section of the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thebooktrail.com/book-trails/let-me-lie/|title=The Book Trail Let Me Lie'|website=wwww.thebooktrail.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:US Army 52327 25th CAb touches down in Kuwait.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Small arms live-fire training, simulating advancing upon an enemy compound at [[Camp Buehring]], Kuwait, 2009.]]
A '''live-fire exercise''' or LFX is any [[military exercise]] in which a realistic scenario for the use of specific equipment is demonstrated. In the popular lexicon this is applied primarily to tests of weapons or weapon systems that are associated with the various branches of a nation's [[armed forces]], although the term can be applied to the civilian arena as well.

==Armed services==
Armed services usually use live-fire exercises as an opportunity to use real [[ammunition]] in a realistically created combat situation. The area in which these tests are conducted will be devoid of people to avoid casualties, and will likely be owned by the government which authorized the test. Most live-fire tests are conducted either against derelict equipment, such as tanks and ships, or against remotely controlled drones.

The purpose of this type of exercise is twofold: First, it offers recruits the chance to get accustomed to their weapons so that they will know how to properly operate them; secondly, this provides soldiers with an opportunity to fire live ammunition without having to worry about an actual enemy returning fire. This allows soldiers to get reacquainted with the feel and time of actually using and expending ammunition, rather than simply simulating the experience. Live-fire exercises of this type can be observed either by remotely controlled cameras or by long-range [[telescope|telescopic]] devices, such as [[binoculars]].

===Army===
[[File:Mercedes-Benz G-Class of the Canadian Land Forces.JPG|thumb|right|A Canadian Army Mercedes-Benz G-Class wagon in a live-fire exercise with Canadian soldier firing the mounted C6 GPMG.]]
An army, being the main branch responsible for land combat, is perhaps the best known group that conducts live-fire exercises. Most live-fire exercises occur within the [[military base]] where the units conducting the exercise are located. In some cases, one installation will host units from another for a larger live-fire exercise. Equipment tested under these circumstances range from [[small arms]] and [[assault rifle]] fire all the way up to missile systems and [[artillery]] fire. In the case of small arms, the tests are usually proficiency based and aimed at ensuring a soldier can fire their assigned weapons. In the case of the latter, missile systems may be test-fired at remotely controlled drones to simulate a situation in which enemy missiles or aircraft are launched at allied or friendly forces, while artillery units can take the opportunity to test new shells or to fire under adverse [[weather]] conditions for a chance to see how the artillery pieces will perform.

===Marine forces===
[[File:M1A1 firing main gun 3.jpg|thumb|U.S. Marines conduct a live-fire exercise with an M1A1 Abrams Tank in Iraq.]]
For the most part [[marine (armed services)|marine]] corps live-fire exercises are similar to the army's live-fire exercises. One notable difference stems from the amphibious nature of a marine force's duty, which can lead the force to incorporate [[amphibious assault ship]]s when they conduct live-fire exercises.

===Air forces===
[[Image:B-2 Spirit bombing, 1994.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A [[B-2 Spirit]] dropping [[Mark 83 bomb|Mk.82 bombs]] in a 1994 training exercise off [[Point Mugu, California|Pt. Mugu]] in the Pacific Ocean.]]
An [[air force]], due to its nature, usually limits live-fire exercises to the air, although bombing exercises can be conducted as well.

During live-fire exercises dealing with air-to-air combat, remotely controlled [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drones]] are frequently used to simulate enemy [[aircraft]]. In modern times, the drones are fired on by planes loaded with some type of [[air-to-air missile]], with the objective of the exercise being to destroy the drone. These test are usually done to ensure that guidance packages within the missiles will work, although they can be done to test other factors, such as a missile's susceptibility to [[Radar jamming and deception|jamming]] or to see if a new type of dodging technique will work against the missiles fired.

Live-fire exercises involving air-to-surface work are usually centered around [[precision-guided munition]]s. In some cases, tests involving bombs will make use of [[wikt:derelict|derelict]] buildings or, even more frequently, vehicles. Live-fire bombing exercises are usually conducted with precision-guided munitions to ensure that they work correctly, but are also used to test new and experimental weapons to ensure that they work as they were originally designed to. These test are usually monitored by [[chase plane]]s and by cameras to determine if everything worked as it was originally intended to.

Live-fire exercises may also be conducted against planes for the purpose of testing a plane's susceptibility to SAM sites, or as a means to test a plane's stealth features.

===Naval forces===
[[Image:USSTheSullivans-firingmissi.jpg|thumb|left|U.S. {{sclass-|Arleigh Burke|destroyer}}s fire anti-missile missiles during a live-fire exercise.]]
Naval live-fire exercises may use anti-ship [[missile]]s and [[torpedo]]es, although tests involving air-to-air and [[air-to-surface missile]], guns and bombs are not uncommon. Navies conduct live-fire exercises to test elements of an integrated defense system, such as the US [[Aegis combat system|Aegis]]; namely, its ability to track and destroy enemy [[anti-ship missile]]s. Tests can also include an integrated defense system's compatibility to fire new missiles or newer versions of the same missile. Live-fire tests are also conducted with a [[CIWS]] system, which is designed as the last line of defense for a ship. Surface ships also frequently test-fire the various guns kept and maintained aboard the vessel; these can range from sidearms and rifles up to the [[16"/50 caliber Mark 7 gun|16" guns]] of the mothballed US {{sclass-|Iowa|battleship}}s. This is done to maintain the skill and knowledge needed to operate the weapon. In the case of [[aircraft carrier]]s, the pilots assigned to the carrier may conduct air-to-air and air-to-surface missile exercises similar to those of the air force; additionally, these pilots may also conduct live-fire exercises against derelict ships. Recent aircraft carriers have incorporated missile-launching systems, and have taken part in live-fire exercises involving missiles.

For [[submarine]]s, both fast attack and ballistic missile (or "boomers"), live-fire tests may include firing sea-to-land missiles at targets on shore or launching dummy ballistic missiles; however, the most frequent live-fire exercises conducted by submarines involve firing torpedoes at a target. The best-known tests of torpedoes are those conducted against a derelict ship, typically on a ship from a navy's own [[reserve fleet|mothball fleet]] that has become too old or obsolete to warrant maintaining. The purpose of these tests is to ensure that the torpedo will work under combat conditions, and such tests can be used to determine whether or not noisemakers or other [[decoy]]s will have any effect against the unit when launched.

===Use against training soldiers===
Some forces, especially in more [[authoritarian]] societies{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}, have also been known to use live ammunition against their own forces in military exercises,{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} to ensure that the soldiers 'take their training seriously' and get accustomed to being shot at before facing actual enemies. This kind of fire is usually not intended to kill anyone, though practices such as firing into the ground close to a soldier going through an obstacle course pose obvious risks.&lt;!-- Cannot cite this, but saw a movie about an Arab military training camp 15 years ago in which this was done. Please reference if possible --&gt;

German [[Waffen SS]] training involved the usage of live ammunition, designed to make the soldiers tougher than regular soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://waffen-ss.com/page.php?page=100 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130630135835/http://waffen-ss.com/page.php?page=100 |archivedate=30 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Soviet Union]], just after [[Joseph Stalin]] died in 1954, conducted a live [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear]] [[Nuclear testing|test]], during exercises at the [[Totskoye range]], against soldiers at a distance believed to be safe when in [[trench]]es. Any immediate deaths can't be proven today, but [[Russia]]n [[human rights]] activists assert that the long aftermath death toll is in the thousands.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

A similar live nuclear test was performed by the [[United States Marine Corps|USMC]] [[Marine Corps Test Unit]] and [[US Army]] Armored Task Force "Razor" during exercise [[Operation Teapot|Teapot]] ([[Desert Rock VI]]) at the [[Nevada Test Site]] in 1955.

The British [[Special Air Service|SAS]] and [[Royal Marines]] are also known to use live rounds, for the former during the jungle phase of training, and the latter using live rounds in their final exercise.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} The SAS also use live-fire in regular close quarter combat training.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

==Non-military==
[[Image:CannonWithSmoke.jpg|thumb|left|Cannon in a Civil War [[Historical reenactment|re-enactment]]: The large amounts of gunpowder used often affected visibility significantly. Gunners hope for a strong wind that will allow them to continue to see their target.]]
Weapons tests are not usually conducted by civilian agencies; however, some civilian groups do conduct live-fire tests of equipment to ensure that they work properly or to test new methods. Examples here would include [[law enforcement agency|law enforcement agencies]] ([[shooting range]]s) and [[controlled explosion]]s by demolition experts. Sometimes, [[historical reenactment]]s, such as those done for the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], will include live-fire demonstrations so the general public can observe historical equipment in action.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==Other types==
[[Image:Peacekeeper-missile-testing.jpg|thumb|right|Testing of the [[LG-118A Peacekeeper]] re-entry vehicles, all eight fired from only one missile. Each line represents the path of a warhead which, were it live, would detonate with the explosive power of twenty-five [[Little Boy|Hiroshima-style]] weapons.]]
Other types of live-fire exercises include various [[nuclear testing|nuclear tests]] conducted by the world's nuclear powers. Also in this group are the live-fire tests of new and exotic weaponry like the [[Massive Ordnance Air Blast bomb]], or "Mother of all Bombs". Also numbered among the unique weapons tests are test fires of [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s (ICBM) and [[multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle]]s. Recently, a new addition was made to this area when live-fire tests began of the U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative, nicknamed "[[Strategic Defense Initiative|Star Wars]]". These live-fire tests are aimed at intercepting incoming enemy ballistic missiles before they can detonate over their designated target.

==Dangers==
[[File:US Navy 090226-N-1251W-002 Gunners Mate 1st Class Leland Pasion explains how to inspect rounds for safety before a live-fire exercise aboard the amphibious dock landing ship USS Harpers Ferry (LSD 49).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Inspection for safety before a live-fire exercise]]
[[Image:USS Iowa BB61 Iowa Explosion 1989.jpg|thumb|right|On 19 April 1989, {{USS|Iowa|BB-61|6}}{{'}}s #2 turret [[USS Iowa turret explosion|exploded]] during a routine live-fire training exercise. Forty-seven sailors died as a result of the blast.]]
In any situation in which [[hazardous material]]s are involved there exists the potential for a mishap to occur, and when these mishaps occur the results can be as spectacular as they are deadly. All forms of ordnance contain some type of [[explosive]] charge to launch and, in most cases, detonate, a weapon. If these charges are inappropriately stored or handled the result can be serious injury or death to the person and anyone in the immediate vicinity. Other dangers include faulty guidance and sensory information, which can cause guided ordnance to inadvertently target friendly or neutral units. Advances in technology have helped to reduce, and in some cases eliminate, problems with these materials; nonetheless, extreme care must be given when using or implementing them. For example, the handling of [[gunpowder]] demands the use of [[glove]]s and an area free of [[static electricity]] and other potential sparks which could ignite the powder.

"'''Manuscript'''" is a broad concept in [[publishing]], that can refer to one or both of the following: 
* the formatting of a ''short story manuscript'', 
* an accepted manuscript (by its merit, not its format), not yet in a final format (but reviewed), published with non-final-format in advance, as ''preprint''.

A manuscript is the work that an author submits to a publisher, [[editing|editor]], or producer for [[publishing|publication]]. Even with the advent of [[desktop publishing]], making it possible for anyone to prepare text that appears professionally [[typesetting|typeset]], many publishers still require authors to submit manuscripts within their respective guidelines.

== Manuscript format ==

Although publishers guidelines for formatting are the most critical resource for authors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Formatting and Submitting your Manuscript|edition= 3rd|last1= Sambuchino|first1= Chuck |last2= The Editors of Writer's Digest Books|year= 2009|publisher= Writer's Digest Books|location= Cincinnati, OH|isbn= 978-1-58297-571-9|pages=5, 10}}
&lt;/ref&gt; [[style guide]]s are also key references for authors preparing manuscripts since "virtually all professional editors work closely with one of them in editing a manuscript for publication."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Pocket Idiot's Guide to Grammar and Punctuation: A Handy Reference to Resolve All Your Grammatical Problems|last= Stevenson|first=Jay|year=2005|publisher=Alpha Books|isbn=978-1-59257-393-6|page=viii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manuscript formatting (also named [[standard manuscript format]]) depends greatly on the type of work that is being written, as well as the individual publisher, editor or producer. Writers who intend to submit a manuscript should determine what the relevant writing standards are, and follow them. Individual publishers' standards will take precedence over [[style guide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Formatting and Submitting your Manuscript|edition= 3rd|last1= Sambuchino|first1= Chuck |last2= The Editors of Writer's Digest Books|year= 2009|publisher= Writer's Digest Books|location= Cincinnati, OH|isbn= 978-1-58297-571-9|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Preprint ==
{{main|Preprint}}
An ordinary ''manuscript'' only becomes a "publisher's [[preprint]]" if it somehow gets distributed beyond the authors (or the occasional colleague whom they ask for advice), but the "publisher" here is a loose concept. Illustrating:

* In a [[peer review]] context: if an author prepares a manuscript on their computer and submit it to a publisher for review, and the submission is not accepted, there never was any "publisher's preprint".
* In a web context (legal/cultural authorship): if an author needs to ensure authorship, they can use a [[Disciplinary repository|repository]] to upload a version of their publication before full publication. In this context, web-publishing is not the only alternative, it is possible to use a [[legal deposit]] of the manuscript.

In both contexts, a future "final print" is planned &amp;ndash; with [[Page layout|better layout]], [[proofreading]] and some kind of [[prepress proofing]] &amp;ndash; that will replace the "preprinted ''manuscript''".

'''Martin Rieser''' is Professor of Digital Creativity in the Institute of Creative Technologies, in [[De Montfort University]], Leicester.

==Background==
Joint research Professor between the [http://www.ioct.dmu.ac.uk Institute of Creative Technologies]  and The Faculty of Art and Design at De Montfort University, his track record as a researcher and practitioner in Digital Arts stretches back to the early 1980s. Originally a graduate of English Literature and Philosophy from Bristol University, he subsequently studied Printmaking at Atelier 17 in Paris with [[Stanley William Hayter]] and then at Goldsmiths, where he also developed an abiding interest in Photography. From such an already hybrid background he moved into Computer Arts, establishing the first postgraduate course in the discipline in London in 1982.

==Research==
His art practice in internet art and interactive narrative installations has been seen around the world including Milia in Cannes; Paris; The ICA London and in Germany, Montreal, Nagoya in Japan and Melbourne, Australia.

He has delivered papers on interactive narrative and exhibited at many major conferences in the field including [[Inter-Society for the Electronic Arts]]: Montreal 1995, Rotterdam 1996, Chicago 1997, Nagoya 2002, University of Oslo 2004, [[Siggraph]], 2005,  Banff Arts Centre 2005, Digital Matchmakers Trondheim 2005 Plan ICA 2005, NAI Rotterdam 2008, Intelligent Environments Seattle 2008, Locunet, University of Athens 2008, and at many other conference venues across the UK and Europe.

==Installations and visual research==
His interactive installations include ''Understanding Echo'' shown in Japan 2002, [https://web.archive.org/web/20081123123054/http://www.martinrieser.com/Understandingecho.htm] ''Hosts'' Bath Abbey 2006 [https://web.archive.org/web/20081123122807/http://www.martinrieser.com/Hosts.htm] and ''Secret Door'' Invideo Milan 2006, ''The Street'' RMIT Gallery Melbourne 2008. He is currently developing mobile artworks for Manchester and Vienna, and public installations for the new DMC in Leicester.

In 1988, he exhibited at the First International Society of Electronic Artists (FISEA) conference held in Utrecht. In 1990, created an interactive exhibition utilising giant digital panels and interactive sound installations with an accompanying multimedia program on the theme of the Electronic Forest. This was one of the first such installations of its type and prototyped the connection of such exhibitions to the internet. In 1990 he began experimenting with permanent digital ceramic printing for Public Art. 

In 1992, he also directed the ''Media Myth and Mania'' section of the joint Watershed/Artec exhibition and CD publication ''From Silver to Silicon''. The latter piece has been shown at many venues around the world including Milia in Cannes; Paris; ICA and the Photographer’s Gallery, London and at ISEA Montreal. Other visual research projects included the direction of a 1995 collaboration involving five other artists (collectively known as ''Ship of Fools'') using the subject of mythologies to explore the full range of narrative and visual interfaces in interactive media in a piece called Labyrinth. This work involved drama, digital image, virtual environments, and interactive video at F-Stop Gallery in Bath and as part of the Cheltenham Literary Festival. It has been previewed at a number of venues including the Oberhausen Short Film festival in Germany and at ISEA in Montreal. His 2002 research project T''riple Echo'' won an AHRB award and involves a three screen interactive video depicting a love triangle based on the Orpheus legends. ''Understanding Echo'', 2002 was funded by the DA2[http://www.da2.org.uk/da2.htm]. An interactive video drama, it was shown at the Cheltenham literary festival, Watershed Bristol and at ISEA2002 in Nagoya Japan.

He took [[AHRB]] research leave in 2004-5 creating a new, large–scale locative work for Bath Abbey called ''Hosts'' which uses mobile and positional technologies combined with interactive sound and video. In 2006 he was commissioned by Electric Pavilion to create Starshed, [http://www.electricpavilion.org/content/roots/starshed/index.html] an interactive map of the uncanny for mobile and webmedia. Also in 2006 he exhibited ''Secret Room'' at Arthotel for Invideo Festival Milan. Current research includes Vienna Underground a locative media commission for the emobilArt European workshop and ''Riverains'' for the [[b.Tween]] Festival in Manchester. He is developing two further works for the new Digital Media Centre in Leicester: ''Secret Garden'', a virtual reality opera co-authored with [[Andrew Hugill]] and ''The Street'', an interactive video wall, featured in  autumn 2008 Melbourne in HEAT: The Art of Climate Change

==Residencies/commissions==
Watershed/Cambridge Darkroom residency which involved constructing a self-curating web site and multimedia piece called ''Screening the Virus'', based around publicly submitted artwork on HIV/Aids related themes. This was later short listed for a Wellcome Trust Sci-Art award. He had an  Honorary Research Fellow Residency at [[La Trobe University]] Melbourne which led to his exhibiting The Street in   ''HEAT: The Art of Climate Change'', an  [[RMIT University|RMIT]] Melbourne International Exhibition Commission in 2008. Other recent commissions include ''Riverains'', a b.Tween Festival Locative commission for Exploding Narrative and  the 2008 Watershed Pervasive Media commission

He has published numerous essays and books on digital art including ''New Screen Media: Cinema/ Art/Narrative'' (BFI/ZKM, 2002), which combines a DVD of current research and practice in this area together with critical essays. And has recently edited The Mobile Audience, a book on locative technology and art due out this year from Rodopi, also logged in a blog: [http://www.mobileaudience.blogspot.com]

He has also acted as consultant to bodies such as Cardiff Bay Arts Trust and the Photographer’s Gallery London, Arkive in Bristol,  The Soros Media Institute in Prague and UIAH in Helsinki.

==Curation==
He has experience of curation and judging through number of other international exhibitions in electronic art, including ''The Electronic Eye'' European Digital Art at Watershed 1986, the first International survey exhibition of Digital Printmaking: ''The Electronic Print'', [[Arnolfini]] in Bristol 1989. Arcade 2- 1997, Arcade 3 2000, He helped to make a successful lottery bid to fund a national digital arts initiative Imag@nation subsequently transformed into DA2: an arts initiative promoting digital art practice nationally, and internationally.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6381">'''Mitchell J. Nathan''' is Full Professor of Educational Psychology, Chair of the Learning Science program in the School of Education at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], and a researcher at the [[Wisconsin Center for Education Research]].

Nathan uses [[experimental psychology|experimental design]] and [[discourse analysis|video based discourse analysis]] methods to study learning and teaching in school settings. His research investigates the role of prior knowledge and invented strategies in the development of algebraic thinking, the notion of Expert Blind Spot &lt;ref&gt;[http://aer.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/40/4/905 Expert Blind Spot Among Preservice Teachers - Nathan and Petrosino 40 (4): 905 - American Educational Research Journal&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; to explain teachers'  instructional decision making, and how teachers use [[gesture]]s, [[embodied philosophy|embodiment and objects]] to convey abstract ideas during instruction.   
 
He is principal researcher for the STAAR project (Supporting the Transition from Arithmetic to Algebraic Reasoning) funded through the IERI program by the [[National Science Foundation]], U.S. Department of Education’s Institute for Educational Sciences, and [[National Institutes of Health]]-NICHD), and has secured over $10 million in research funds as a PI or co-PI.

He has published over 50 peer-reviewed papers in his subject; the most cited one has been cited 316 times according to Google Scholar.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=I1gfRZwAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao Google Scholar page for Mitch Nathan]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Apprenticeship Service''', part of the [[Skills Funding Agency]], is a government agency that coordinates apprenticeships in England, enabling young people to enter the [[Tradesman|skilled trades]].

==History==
At the beginning of February 2008 the Labour Government published a document called ''Strategy for the Future of Apprenticeships in England''. It introduced a quango, the National Apprenticeship Service. The National Skills Director of the Learning and Skills Council was to be in charge of the NAS. The LSC at the time had had most of its funding farmed out to local authorities. The NAS was to be part of the LSC, as outlined in the government's 2008 document on apprenticeships. Two new divisions in the LSC were formed at the same time - one for young people headed by Rob Wye, and one for adult education and training headed by Chris Roberts. All of the three new divisions were still at this stage part of the LSC, and not separate entities. At the time six government agencies had some responsibility for apprenticeships, but there was no overall leadership.

At the time of its formation, the Labour Government up to that point had been heavily focused on persuading 50% of under-18s to attend university. In other European countries, much more focus is placed on apprenticeships; only 6% of English companies offer apprenticeships compared to 30% in Germany. In England, those who by age of 25 had been on an apprenticeship are likely to earn much more than those who do not, for similar qualifications (£100,000 over a career). A university degree is often quoted as improving earning potential, but is highly dependent on choice of degree, and apprenticeships have a much higher success rate on earning potential.

A '''national academy''' is an organizational body, usually operating with [[State (polity)|state]] financial support and approval, that co-ordinates scholarly [[research]] activities and standards for [[academic disciplines]], most frequently in the [[science]]s but also the [[humanities]]. Typically the country's [[learned society|learned societies]] in individual disciplines will liaise with or be co-ordinated by the national academy.  National academies play an important organizational role in academic exchanges and collaborations between countries.

The extent of official recognition of national academies varies between countries.  In some cases they are explicitly or de facto an arm of government; in others, as in the [[United Kingdom]], they are voluntary, [[non-profit]] bodies with which government has agreed to negotiate, and which may receive government financial support while retaining substantial independence.  In the countries of the former [[Soviet Union]], and in the [[People's Republic of China]], the national academies have considerable power over policy and personnel in their areas. There is however a growing consensus among international federations of learned academies that bona fide national (or learned) academies need to adhere to certain criteria:
*The fellowship is elected, on the basis of excellence, by existing fellows (members)
*The number of fellows is restricted either to a total number or to a rate of accretion
*The governance of the academy is democratic and “bottom up”. The fellowship is the ultimate source of the academy’s authority
*The academy is independent of government, industry and professional associations.  Most, if not all, academies derive some financial support from some or all of these other organizations but this support needs to be given in a manner that does not compromise the academy’s independence.

== Different models ==

In some countries, a single academy covers all disciplines; an example is [[France]].
In others, there are several academies, which work together more or less closely; for example, [[Australia]]. In many states they are organized in [[Academy of Sciences|Academies of Science]].

'''Oliver Elton''' (3 June 1861 – 4 June 1945) was an English literary scholar whose works include ''A Survey of English Literature (1730 - 1880)'' in six volumes, criticism, biography, and translations from several languages including [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. He was [[King Alfred Chair of English Literature|King Alfred Professor]] of English at [[Liverpool University]]. He also helped set up the Department of English at the [[University of the Punjab]], [[Lahore]], [[Pakistan]].

==Early life==
Born at [[Holt, Norfolk]], on 3 June 1861, Elton was the only child of Sarah and the Reverend Charles Allen Elton (1820–1887), the headmaster of [[Gresham's School]], where Oliver was taught by his father until he proceeded to [[Marlborough College]] and [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford]], where he was a scholar from 1880 to 1885. He graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] with first class honours in ''[[Literae Humaniores]]'' in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;Foster, Joseph, ''Alumni Oxonienses 1880-1892''&lt;/ref&gt;

His friends at Oxford included [[Leonard Huxley (writer)|Leonard Huxley]], [[Michael Ernest Sadler|Michael Sadler]] and [[Dugald Sutherland MacColl]], whose sister he later married.

==Career==
Elton's first work was as a tutor and lecturer in [[London]], while preparing school editions of [[Shakespeare]] and [[John Milton|Milton]]. He translated [[Einar Hafliðason]]'s ''[[Laurentius Saga]]'' as ''The Life of Laurence Bishop of Hólar in Iceland'' ([[Lárentíus Kálfsson]]) into English.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Elton (trans.), ''The Life of Laurence Bishop of Hólar in Iceland'' (London: [[Rivington (publishers)|Rivington]], 1890), available at [https://archive.org/details/lifeoflaurencebi00einauoft https://archive.org/details/lifeoflaurencebi00einauoft].&lt;/ref&gt; In this he was encouraged by [[Frederick York Powell]], whose biography Elton would later publish in 1906.&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;Smith, D. N., revised by Rebecca Mills, ''Elton, Oliver (1861–1945), literary scholar and translator'', in ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' ([[Oxford University Press]], 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1890 he went as a lecturer to [[Owens College, Manchester]], remaining for ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=ELTON. Oliver|magazine=Who's Who|year=1907|volume= 59|page=556|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yEcuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA556}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time there he published a translation of nine of the books of the ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'' by ''[[Saxo Grammaticus]]'', a study of [[Michael Drayton]], and ''The Augustan Ages'' (1899) which brought him recognition from the academic literary world. Meanwhile, he got to know [[Charles Edward Montague]] and wrote for the ''[[Manchester Guardian]]''.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

He went to [[Liverpool University|Liverpool]] in 1901 as Professor of English Literature and stayed till his retirement in 1925. While there, he completed two thirds (four volumes) of his ''Survey of English Literature'' and lectured and wrote on Milton, [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Tennyson]], [[Henry James]], [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]] and others.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

After retirement he went to [[Harvard]] as a visiting professor and later settled in Oxford. He completed the ''Survey of English Literature'', and published a book on English poetry: ''The English Muse: a Sketch'' (1933). He also continued an interest in Russian and other [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] literature (mainly Serbian) which had begun during the [[World War I|first world war]], and published further translations, notably of [[Pushkin]]'s [[Eugene Onegin]] (1937).&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

Elton's encyclopedic range is impressive and George Sampson, in the ''Cambridge History of English Literature'', brackets him with two of his contemporaries who were also "scholars on the heroic scale of learning ": [[William Paton Ker]] and [[George Saintsbury]].&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

==Family==
In 1888 Elton married Letitia Maynard MacColl, the sister of his Oxford friend [[Dugald Sutherland MacColl]]. Letitia became a children's writer. They had three sons, one of whom was the biologist [[Charles Sutherland Elton]].&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

'''Open Roberta''' is the name of a project within the German education initiative "Roberta—Learning with robots", initiated by Fraunhofer IAIS, which is an institute belonging to the [[Fraunhofer Society]]. With Open Roberta Fraunhofer IAIS is looking to encourage kids to code by using robots e.g. [[Lego Mindstorms]], and other programmable hardware systems e.g. Arduino, BBC micro:bit, Calliope mini. The [[Cloud Computing|Cloud]]-approach of the Open Roberta Lab makes programming easier and minimizes the hurdles for teachers and schools to teach how to code.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ojs.statsbiblioteket.dk/index.php/lom/article/view/22183/20134 Journal Learning und Medien (LOM)]&lt;/ref&gt; Open Roberta is free and does not require any installation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.open-roberta.org/ Open Roberta Website]&lt;/ref&gt; The project was initially founded with €1Mio&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.izb.fraunhofer.de/de/presse/news-24-03-2015.html Pressemitteilung von Fraunhofer IAIS].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://google-produkte.blogspot.de/2014/11/open-roberta.html Google Produkt Blog]&lt;/ref&gt; by Google.org&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.org/ Google.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Open Roberta Lab ==
[[File:OpenRobertaLabEN2016.png|thumb|Open Roberta Lab]]
Open Roberta Lab is cloud-based programming environment and is the user-facing middleware in a chain of software and firmware bits that make a robot work in a classroom environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hackaday.com/2016/05/11/open-robots-with-open-roberta/ Hackaday.com]&lt;/ref&gt; This environment allows children and young people with no technical pre-knowledge to program a [[Lego Mindstorms|LEGO MINDSTORMS]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legoengineering.com/open-roberta/ LEGO Engineering Website]&lt;/ref&gt; EV3 and NXT robot, as well as the [[Arduino]] based robot Bot'n Roll ONE A,&lt;ref&gt;[http://botnroll.com/onea/]&lt;/ref&gt; the BBC micro:bit,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://microbit.org/|title=The Micro:bit Foundation is a global non-profit organisation making invention with technology fun for everyone!|website=microbit.org|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Calliope mini.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://calliope.cc/|title=CALLIOPE {{!}} Home|website=calliope.cc|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of the release 2.3.0, the microboard B-O-B-3 and as of the release 3.0 the microboards [[Arduino Uno]], [[Arduino Nano]] and Arduino Mega can also be programmed using Open Roberta. There is a variety of different program blocks available to program the motors, sensors, and the EV3 brick.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geekinsydney.com/6991/open-roberta-lab-better-way-program-ev3/ Geek in Sydney]&lt;/ref&gt; Open Roberta Lab uses the approach of [[Visual programming language|visual programming]]. This approach makes it easier - especially for beginners with no experience - to learn how to code. As a cloud based programming environment no installation is needed, any [[Operating system|operation system]] and computer hardware device may be used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lab.open-roberta.org/ „Open Roberta Lab“] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150625024053/http://lab.open-roberta.org/ |date=2015-06-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jost, B., Ketterl, M., Budde, R., Leimbach, T. Graphical Programming Environments for Educational Robots: ''Open Roberta – Yet another One?'', in IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia (ISM), December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
The big advantage of Open Roberta Lab is, that it can be used with any device (PC, tablet, smartphone) and with any [[operating system]] (Mac OS, Windows, Linux). Only a [[web browser]] is needed. The Lab can be used without registration. No user account is needed. As of the release 2.2.1, the linux-based operating system EV3dev is officially supported for the LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 robot. Open Roberta Lab is available in the following languages: Catalan, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish and Turkish.

== Open Source Community ==
The programming platform Open Roberta Lab is [[open source]] developed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://thenextweb.com/google/2014/11/04/open-roberta-google-wants-help-german-school-kids-learn-program-robots/?awesm=tnw.to_d4hCT The Next Web]&lt;/ref&gt; Both the [[software]] as well as the open source development tools are available on a server of [[Fraunhofer Society]]. The development team at Fraunhofer works together with teachers and education experts from the Roberta network. Therefore, also universities and students are involved in the development. It should address especially female students - the guiding principle of the Roberta project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dev.open-roberta.org/ Open Roberta Developer Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programming language NEPO® ==
[[File:NEPO program Hello-World2016.png|thumb|NEPO program Hello World]]
NEPO is a free open source meta programming language that can be used by students, scholars, teachers, and other interested persons within the Open Roberta Lab. NEPO translates to New Easy Programming Online (or simply OPEN read backwards). NEPO is how we call our graphical programming language and its coupled hardware connection layer. NEPO uses the freely available [[Blockly]] library.&lt;ref&gt;[https://code.google.com/p/blockly/ Blockly Website]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition within NEPO there are additional functionalities and improvements have been adapted for Open Roberta. The programming paradigm of NEPO is inspired by [[Scratch programming language|Scratch]] from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. A NEPO block always represents and encapsulates a certain robot functionality. A blocks feature set can easily be recognized through the associated block category, for example »sensors«. Programming with NEPO follows a simple principle. The blocks are interconnected and will be executed by the robot according to their order. This principle is called »sequential operation«.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dev.open-roberta.org/ Open Roberta Wiki]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== NEPO block categories ===
All available blocks are listed and categorized as the Action, Sensors, Control, Logic, Math, Text, Colours, Variables, Functions, and Massages as shown in the table below.

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: left"
|-
! colspan="2" style="background: #efefef;" | Category !! Notes !! style="background:white;" | &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; !! colspan="2" style="background: #efefef;" | Category !! Notes
|- valign="top"
| bgcolor="#f29400"| &amp;nbsp; || Action || Includes blocks for the robot to be performed directly. || rowspan="5" bgcolor="white"| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; || bgcolor="#b1c800"| &amp;nbsp; || Text ||Includes blocks to write strings on the robot display.
|- valign="top"
| bgcolor="#8fa402"| &amp;nbsp; || Sensors || Contains blocks for all standard sensors of the EV3 system. || bgcolor="#ebc300"| &amp;nbsp; || Colours || Standard colour blocks to compare sensor inputs.
|- valign="top"
| bgcolor="#eb6a0a"| &amp;nbsp; || Control || Includes blocks for the program sequence control. The category includes the following blocks: If .. do, If .. do .. else, repeat indefinitely, repeat .. times, wait .. ms, wait until .. || bgcolor="#9085ba"| &amp;nbsp; || Variables ||Local and global variables can be defined.
|- valign="top"
| bgcolor="#33b8ca"| &amp;nbsp; || Logic || With the »logic« blocks, conditions can be created. With this condition you can interrelate states, values, and events with each other. || bgcolor="#179c7d"| &amp;nbsp; || Functions ||Functions with input and output parameters can be defined.
|- valign="top"
| bgcolor="#005a94"| &amp;nbsp; || Math || Mathematical operators and parameter blocks. || bgcolor="#ff69b4"| &amp;nbsp; || Messages ||Includes blocks to send and receive bluetooth massages.
|- valign="top"
| bgcolor="#39378b"| &amp;nbsp; || List ||Includes blocks to create a list and to search or sort list elements.|| || bgcolor="#e2001a"| &amp;nbsp; || program-start || Each program starts with this block. This block is always available in the workspace.
|}

=== NEPO input / output connector ===
[[File:NEPO typ check input connectors.png|thumb|NEPO typ check input connectors]]
Depending on the block different values can be passed to a block. The type of the value can be identified by the colored compounds (called including »connectors«) of a block. In the chapter »block category« you can see the different values a block may have. Only if the colors of the input and the output connector match, these blocks can be connected.

A block may optionally also pass a value (only one!) to another block. These blocks have colored output connectors. Only if the colors of the input and the output connector are the same, these blocks can be connected.
[[File:NEPO typ check output connectors.png|thumb|NEPO typ check output connectors]]

In total there are six input and output types within NEPO. These types can have the following values:
   
* Logical value (light blue)
* Number (dark Blue)
* String / Text (green)
* Colour (yellow)
* List (purple)
* Connection (pink)

== Open Roberta Simulator ==

[[File:OpenRobertaSimulationEN2016.png|thumb|Open Roberta 2D simulation of a wheeled robot]]
Since version beta 1.3.0 the Open Roberta Lab also offers a simulation environment. This is a simulation of a two-dimensional robot model equipped with two wheels ([[Differential (mechanical device)|differential drive]]). To program the simulated robot also the programming language NEPO may be used. The simulated 2D model includes the simulation of an ultrasonic sensor, a touch sensor, a color sensor and the display of an LED. In addition, different environments can be chosen. Since version beta 1.4.0 NEPO blocks can used without any changes for the 2D-Simulation and the real robot.

== Open Roberta Gallery ==
As of the release 2.3.0, the „Gallery“ is available allowing users to share own programs with everyone else. Logged-in users with a verified account can do that by clicking “edit” in the menu bar, followed by a click on the menu point “my programs”. In the following overview of the programs saved online, they then just have to click on the gallery-icon on the right-hand side. 

In order to load a program off the Gallery, users – logged in or not – double-click on the chosen program and are then able to view, change or download its content.

The '''Milan Planetarium''' (in Italian, '''Planetario di Milano''') is the largest and most important [[planetarium]] in [[Italy]]. It is located in the [[Giardini Pubblici Indro Montanelli|Gardens of Porta Venezia]], in the [[Porta Venezia]] district of [[Milan]]. It was established in 1930, and has been in operation since then.

The Planetarium building was inaugurated on May 20, 1930. It was designed by architect Piero Portaluppi for Ulrico Hoepli, who donated it to Milan. It has an octagonal base and it is 19.6 meters in diameter, with an overall capacity of 300 seats. The dome-shaped screen is decorated with the silhouette of the Milan skyline as it was in 1930 (for example, without the [[Pirelli Tower]]).

The scene is created by a Zeiss IV star projector, which has been in use since 1968.

The Planetarium has about 100,000 visitors a year. It also serves as the headquarters of the Circolo Astrofili di Milano, the oldest and most important [[amateur astronomy]] club in Milan.

'''Project Aladdin''' is a multi-faceted cultural initiative launched in March 2009 under the patronage of [[UNESCO]] with the aim of countering [[Holocaust denial]] and all forms of racism and intolerance, while promoting intercultural dialogue, particularly among Muslims and Jews.&lt;ref name="AFP1"&gt;{{cite news |title=French project aims to counter rise of Holocaust denial in Muslim world |author=AFP |url=http://www.ejpress.org/article/news/western_europe/35610 |newspaper=European Jewish Press |date=March 27, 2009 |accessdate=April 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ap20090327&gt;{{cite news |title=New Web site to combat Holocaust denial |author=Associated Press |url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1237727558125&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |date=March 27, 2009 |accessdate=9 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110125102112/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull&amp;cid=1237727558125 |archivedate=25 January 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Leaders from Europe, Muslim world to launch website aimed at ending Holocaust denial |author=Associated Press |url=http://gulfnews.com/news/world/other-world/leaders-from-europe-muslim-world-to-launch-website-aimed-at-ending-holocaust-denial-1.59660 |newspaper=Gulf News |date=March 27, 2009 |accessdate=April 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was initiated by the [[Fondation pour la Mémoire de la Shoah]], a French foundation dedicated to keeping alive the memory of [[the Holocaust]].&lt;ref name="AFP1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ap20090327 /&gt;

The Project's sponsors include President of [[France]] [[Jacques Chirac]], and [[Prince Hassan bin Talal]] of [[Jordan]] and former German Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]], who are also on the Project's "Board of Distinguished Patrons." Other members of the Board include former Indonesian President [[Abdurrahman Wahid]], and former Mauritanian President [[Ely Ould Mohamed Vall]].&lt;ref name="jpost.com"&gt;"New Web site to combat Holocaust denial,"

More than 500 distinguished figures from [[Europe]], [[North America]] and the [[Muslim]] world have joined the project by declaring their support for its fundamental text, ''A Call to Conscience''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projetaladin.org/en/why-this-web-site/a-call-to-conscience.html |title="A Call to Conscience" |publisher=Projetaladin.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; They include statesmen, parliamentarians, religious figures, intellectuals, historians, academics, authors, artists and civil society actors of different faiths and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/Lifestyle/Story/STIStory_355469.html |title=Straits Times, March 27, 2007, "Project to remember Holocaust," |publisher=Straitstimes.com |date=2009-03-27 |accessdate=2010-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its effort to promote knowledge as a bridge between cultures, the Aladdin Project has set up a multilingual website in [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] that contains information on [[the Holocaust]], as well as a basic introduction to [[Judaism|Jewish faith]], history and culture and an overview of historical relations between Jews and Muslims in different countries.&lt;ref name="FMS"&gt;[http://www.fondationshoah.org/FMS/spip.php?article894&amp;lang=en ''Aladdin Project : a dialogue based on the rejection of Holocaust denial''] - Fondation pour la Memoire de la Shoah&lt;/ref&gt;

A tenet of the project is its online library, where books in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] can be downloaded free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aladdinlibrary.org/node/1 Aladdin Online Library: Free Access to Knowledge] Aladdin Online Library: Free Access&lt;/ref&gt; The first collection includes the first-ever translation into Arabic and Persian of such classics as [[The Diary of Anne Frank|Anne Frank's Diary]] and [[Primo Levi]]'s ''[[If This Is a Man|Survival in Auschwitz]]''. In line with the project's expressed purpose of helping to "bring about a dialogue based on knowledge and mutual respect," the fast-expanding library is set to also include works of authors from the Muslim world translated into English and French.&lt;ref name="FMS"/&gt;

==Launch Conference at UNESCO==
The Aladdin Project was officially launched on March 27, 2009, at the UNESCO headquarters in Paris. In an unprecedented event, the Heads of State of Egypt, Morocco, Qatar, Tunisia and Bosnia and the governments of Turkey and Spain sent high-level representatives to join Senegalese President [[Abdoulaye Wade]], former French President Jacques Chirac and other dignitaries from Europe and the Muslim world to hail the Aladdin Project, reject Holocaust denial, and embark on a Jewish-Muslim dialogue based on mutual knowledge and mutual respect.&lt;ref name="jpost.com"/&gt;

The conference was opened by UNESCO Director General [[Kōichirō Matsuura|Koichiro Matsuura]], who praised the project, saying that "UNESCO offers its support to this initiative, in the hope that it will enhance in a durable manner educational means for peace and tolerance." [[David René de Rothschild|David de Rothschild]], President of the [[Fondation pour la Mémoire de la Shoah|Shoah Memorial Foundation]], outlined the broad themes of the project and its objectives. Other speakers included President Wade of Senegal, [[André Azoulay]], Counselor to the King of [[Morocco]], [[Ahmed Toufiq]], Minister of Islamic Affairs, both representing King Mohammed VI, Qatar's Khalid bin Muhammad al-Atiyah, Minister for International Cooperation, representing Sheikh [[Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani]], the [[Emir of Qatar]], [[Egypt]]'s [[Farouk Hosny]], Minister of Culture, representing President [[Hosni Mubarak]], Tunisia's Prof. M'hamed Hassine Fantar representing President [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]], and [[Bahrain]]'s Princess [[Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa]], a former president of the United Nations General Assembly. Also present on behalf of their respective governments were [[Mustafa Ceric]], the Grand Mufti of Bosnia, and Professor [[İlber Ortaylı]], a distinguished Turkish historian and president of the [[Topkapı Palace|Topkapı]] Museum in Istanbul.&lt;ref name="PAConf" /&gt;

Other notables who came from far away to be present at the conference included Abdou Filali-Ansari representing [[Aga Khan IV]], former [[Tunisia]]n Prime Ministers [[Hédi Baccouche]] and [[Mohammed Mzali]], Egypt's Aly El Samman, a veteran proponent of interfaith dialogue and advisor to the late President [[Anwar El Sadat]], [[Ahmed Aboutaleb]], the Mayor of Rotterdam, Gul Khan, the Lord Mayor of Nottingham, Iranian theologian Ayatollah [[Ahmad Iravani]], Hélé Béji, president of the International College of Tunis, and Pakistani-born British [[Mufti]] Abduljalil Sajid.&lt;ref name="PAConf" /&gt;

In a message to the conference read on his behalf by French Justice Minister [[Rachida Dati]], President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] of France said, "The strength of the Aladdin Project is to extend a hand to those who have been handicapped by prejudices, ignorance, or simply a lack of accessible information; to expose the lies and clear up the misunderstandings; to open up a new horizon for our common future. I share, unreservedly, this fundamental intuition of the Aladdin Project, for I am convinced that peace between peoples can only be based on mutual understanding and respect, and these are acquired in knowing and interacting with the other side."&lt;ref name="PANewsletter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projetaladin.org/assets/files/Newsletter-1-ENG.pdf |title=Project Aladdin Newsletter #1 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former American President [[Bill Clinton]] praised Project Aladdin, saying that it "has the potential to play a vital role in countering denial with facts and putting a human face on something that otherwise might seem too terrible to believe."&lt;ref name=ap20090327/&gt;

"Project Aladdin's focus on encouraging an intercultural dialogue based on mutual knowledge and mutual respect will help ensure that the 21st century is defined not by our differences, but by our common humanity. That is the key to a peaceful future," the former President concluded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projetaladin.org/en/homepage/cronicle/aladdin-projects-launch-conference-at-unesco-a-huge-success/discours.html |title=Project Aladdin's launch conference |publisher=Projetaladin.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current events==
Project Aladdin was recently in the news for its criticism of [[Hezbollah]], citing a "campaign of intimidation" in relation to the use of ''[[The Diary of Anne Frank]]'' in a [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] private school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etaiwannews.com/etn/news_content.php?id=1099700&amp;lang=eng_news ''Holocaust awareness group criticizes Hezbollah''] [[Associated Press]] November 5, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Project Aladdin celebrated its 10th Anniversary on 29th May 2017 with a Gala Dinner attended by UNESCO DG [[Irina Bokova]] and former President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]]. At the dinner Sheikh [[Mohamed Bin Issa Al Jaber]] was awarded the 2017 Prize for the Dialogue of Cultures. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/the_director_general_celebrates_the_10th_anniversary_of_the-1/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''School of Architecture''' at [[UNAM]] is one of the leading schools of architecture and design in Mexico. It offers undergraduate and postgraduate studies in [[architecture]], [[landscape architecture]], [[urbanism]] and [[industrial design]].

[[File:FAUNAM 2015.jpg|thumb|right|School of Architecture Main Building, Designed by José Villagrán García in 1952]]
[[File:FAUNAM 2.jpg|thumb|right|Patio next to Main Building. Commonly referred to by faculty and staff as "Patio de los Pinos"]]

==History==
The School is one of the follow-up institutions of the former [[Academia de San Carlos]], the other one being the School of Arts and Design. The Academia de San Carlos offered studies in architecture since 1791, under control of the [[Royal and Pontifical University of Mexico]]. In 1910, [[Porfirio Diaz]]'s government grants autonomy to the university, thus the academy was reorganized as the ''Escuela Nacional de Arquitectura'' (National School of Architecture) and the ''Escuela Nacional de Artes Plásticas'' (National School of Art).  In 1954 the architecture school moved to its current facilities in [[Ciudad Universitaria]] as ''Facultad de Arquitectura''. The first postgraduate studies in both architecture and urbanism were opened in 1968. In 1969 the school opened its undergraduate program in industrial design, and in 1985 the undergraduate programs in urbanism and landscape architecture and postgraduate studies in industrial design.

==Staff and organization==
The School is run by a dean, currently B.A. Marcos Mazari Hiriart. He is aided by a Technical Council, composed of professors and student and administrative representatives, which makes decisions regarding curriculum, school calendars and schedules, among other tasks.

The school includes the four undergraduate programs (architecture, landscape architecture, urbanism and industrial design), and the graduate, specialization and research programs (in architecture, urbanism and industrial design). In addition, the school holds its own architectural office, which develops projects both for the University and for external clients; and a cultural division that manages cultural events, exhibits, publications, lectures, etc.

The undergraduate program in architecture is organised within five branches: project; urban-environmental; technology; theory, history and research. Furthermore, the program is spread among 16 partially independent studios or ''workshops'' which offer all the mandatory courses. These studios are physically located in eight two story buildings (except for two located in the main building). These workshops originally were conceived to perform long-standing projects and focus on experimentation of different architectural conceptions, depending on the staff that the studio had, the profile of the students was formed.

The workshops are mostly named after Mexican architects or architects that had contributed to Mexican architecture:

*Luis Barragán 
*Max Cetto
*Ehécatl 21
*Juan Antonio García Gayou
*Domingo García Ramos
*Jorge González Reyna
*Carlos Lazo Barreiro
*Jorge González Reyna
*Ramón Marcos Noriega
*Federico Mariscal y Piña
*Hannes Meyer
*Juan O'Gorman
*José Revueltas
*José Villagrán García
*Tres
*Uno

==Location and facilities==

The School is located in [[Ciudad Universitaria]] in Mexico City, near the [[School of Engineering, UNAM]]. It is spread in two separate building complexes; the largest of which houses the undergraduate programs in architecture and landscape architecture, the architecture library, a cafeteria, the Carlos Lazo theater and the Museo Universitario de Ciencias y Artes (Science and Arts University Museum), as well as the main administrative offices. A separate building houses the graduate programs and the undergraduate programs in industrial design and urbanism, two libraries specializing in industrial design and in doctorate-level research, and a cafeteria.

==Degrees offered==
*[[Bachelor of Architecture]]
*Bachelor of [[Industrial Design]]
*Bachelor of [[Landscape Architecture]]
*Bachelor of Urbanism
*[[Master of Architecture]]
*Master of Industrial Design
*Master of Urbanism
*[[Doctor of Architecture]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12558">'''Science Gallery''' is an international group of public [[science centre]]s. Each gallery is operated by '''Science Gallery International''' in partnership with a major local academic institution. The first Science Gallery was opened in 2008 and housed in Trinity's Naughton Institute, at [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]], [[University of Dublin|Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. Each gallery holds various artistic exhibitions and lectures with a view to [[science outreach]] and art-science collaborations. Unlike most science centres, they have no permanent collection, but rather a series of 3-4 temporary exhibitions each year.

===Establishment and location===

Science Gallery Dublin is located within the Naughton Institute of [[Trinity College, Dublin]], which opened in early 2008. [[Michael Coey|Prof. Mike Coey]] had championed the inclusion of gallery space in the Naughton Institute as a place to host exhibitions on science and talks.&lt;ref name=Alstrom&gt;{{cite news|last1=Alstrom|first1=Dick|title=Landmark exhibition venue for Dublin|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/landmark-exhibition-venue-for-dublin-1.476377|accessdate=21 July 2018|date=4 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Byrne&gt;{{cite news|last1=Niall|first1=Byrne|title=The Friday Interview: Dr Michael John Gorman, TCD Science Gallery|url=https://www.siliconrepublic.com/innovation/the-friday-interview-dr-michael-john-gorman-tcd-science-gallery|accessdate=21 July 2018|date=29 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its launch, Michael John Gorman was the gallery's director and [[Lynn Scarff]] was Education and Outreach manager.&lt;ref name=Byrne /&gt; Scarff subsequently served as director from 2014 to 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Science Gallery Dublin Director Lynn Scarff appointed new Director of the National Museum of Ireland|url=https://dublin.sciencegallery.com/news/2018/sciencegallerydublindirectorlynnscarffappointednewdirectornationalmuseumireland|website=Science Gallery Dublin|accessdate=22 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of the gallery is to host a programme of exhibitions, workshops, and events to engage people aged 15–25 with science and technology.&lt;ref name="Trinity News" /&gt; Since its opening the Gallery has received funding and support from [[Google]].&lt;ref name=Ryan&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ryan|first1=Susan|title=Google donates €1million to Ireland’s Science Gallery|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/google-donates-e1million-to-irelands-science-gallery-304443-Dec2011/|accessdate=5 June 2015|agency=The Journal|date=14 Dec 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 the gallery attracted 242,000 visitors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cullen|first1=Paul|title=Rise in cultural and heritage visitors|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/rise-in-cultural-and-heritage-visitors-1.456134|accessdate=5 June 2015|agency=The Irish Times|date=3 Feb 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2014 that had risen to 400,000, and has seen a total of 1.8 million visitors from 2008 to 2014.&lt;ref name=Riggs&gt;{{cite web|last1=Riggs|first1=Samuel|title=Science Gallery Honoured With Own Stamp|url=http://www.universitytimes.ie/?p=32213|website=The University Times|accessdate=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gallery was featured on a limited edition 2015 [[An Post]] stamp, which was part of a series along with the BT [[Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition]], celebrating recent Irish scientific achievements.&lt;ref name=Riggs /&gt;

===Exhibitions===
The gallery hosts a number of exhibitions every year of varying length. Science Gallery Dublin's opening show was ''Lightwave''in early 2008,&lt;ref name="Trinity News"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Science Gallery launched at TCD with LIGHTWAVE exhibition|url=http://www.tcd.ie/news_events/articles/the-science-gallery-launched-at-tcd-with-lightwave-exhibition/685#.VXGTZ0YwHdE|website=Trinity News and Events|accessdate=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has since gone on to host forty other shows including shows the way we perceive - ''Seeing'' - and the future of work - ''Humans Need Not Apply.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Previous seasons at Science Gallery|url=https://dublin.sciencegallery.com/archive|website=Science Gallery Dublin|accessdate=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A component of a number of the exhibitions is the ability for the public to participate in ongoing research. Examples of this are the collection of data on the water consumption and showering habits of visitors to the Home/Sick exhibition  ''WashLab''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ahlstrom|first1=Dick|title=Science Gallery shows us that home is where the heart and the hazards are|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/science/science-gallery-shows-us-that-home-is-where-the-heart-and-the-hazards-are-1.2190774|accessdate=5 June 2015|agency=The Irish Times|date=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Shpilman Institute for Photography''' (SIP) was an Israeli non profit organisation which promoted [[photography]] worldwide.

==History==
SIP was founded in 2010 Shalom Shpilman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/life/arts-leisure/the-engineer-who-put-together-a-startlingly-efficient-photograph-collection.premium-1.433168|title=The engineer who put together a startlingly efficient photograph collection|author=Daniel Rauchwerger|date=29 May 2012|work=Haaretz.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to promote [[photography]] as an art in [[Israel]] and worldwide. The institute, located in [[Tel Aviv]], hosts exhibitions, lectures and various artistic activities by people in the field of photography and media art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artandeducation.net/client/shpilman_institute_for_pho/|title=Shpilman Institute for Photography|work=Art &amp; Education | access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SIP also provides ground and holds academic research. It offers grants and scholarships to projects, both locally in [[Israel]] and internationally. 

In addition to hosting temporary exhibitions, the SIP had a permanent collection with over 900 works, including photographs by [[Erwin Blumenfeld]], Frederick Sommer, Berenice Abbott, [[Arthur Siegel]], Nan Goldin, Cindy Sherman, [[Man Ray]], Cecil Beaton, Elliott Erwitt, [[Bill Brandt]], Andre Breton, [[Claude Cahun]], [[Salvador Dali]], Harry Callahan, Paul Heismann, [[Yasuhiro Ishimoto]], [[Adi Nes]], [[Jeff Wall]], [[Uri Gershuni]], [[Ilit Azulay]], [[Deganit Berest]], [[Eli Lotar]], [[Ohad Matalon]], [[Lee Miller]] and [[Michal Heiman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://thesip.org/language/en/artist/millerbio-en/ | title=Miller Lee | access-date=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of end 2016, Shpilman Institute of Photography ceased its activities and sold its permanent collection at [[Sotheby's]] and [[Christie's]]. Fifty-five works from the collection were purchased by [[Israel Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/gallery/art/1.2784326|title=Israel Museum purchased 55 works from Shpilman collection|work=Haaretz.com | access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation site's latest update was at the end of 2014 and the institute premises were vacated at the beginning of 2015. The [[Shpilman International Prize for Excellence in Photography]] remains active though patronage of Israel Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loeildelaphotographie.com/en/2015/11/10/article/159877221/christies-collection-shpilman/|title=Christie’s : Shalom Shpilman Collection|work=loeildelaphotographie.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/gallery/art/1.2477679|title=מכון שפילמן לצילום ימכור חלקים גדולים מהאוסף שלו - אמנות - הארץ|trans-title=Shpilman Institute of Photography to sell its permanent collection|language=|work=Haaretz.com | access-date=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SiMERR Australia''' is an Australia-wide research body. Its National Centre is located at the [[University of New England (Australia)|University of New England]], [[Armidale, New South Wales|Armidale]], NSW, [[Australia]].

SiMERR Australia's main goal is to improve learning outcomes for students in regional and rural areas, particularly in the areas of [[science]], [[mathematics]] and [[Information and Communication Technology]] (ICT).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.une.edu.au/simerr/pages/aboutus_aims.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The National Centre of Science, ICT, and Mathematics Education for Regional and Rural Australia (SiMERR) grew out of the Centre for Cognition Research into Learning and Teaching (CRiLT), which was part of the School of Education at the [[University of New England (Australia)|University of New England]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.une.edu.au/simerr/pages/aboutus_history.php&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike CRiLT, SiMERR focused on the curriculum areas of science, mathematics and ICT.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.une.edu.au/simerr/pages/aboutus_history.php&lt;/ref&gt;

SiMERR opened its doors on 1 July 2004, with branches, or ''hubs'' opening in each state of Australia in the twelve months that followed in partnership universities, such as the [[University of Tasmania]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.simerr.educ.utas.edu.au/launch.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.deakin.edu.au/arts-ed/education/simerr/launch.php&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Deakin University]] in Victoria.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.deakin.edu.au/arts-ed/education/simerr/launch.php&lt;/ref&gt;

The SiMERR National summit in 2005 brought together educators and other stakeholders for the first national meeting of its kind since the National Centre opening. The two-day summit brought together people from diverse bodies, such as teacher associations, Federal Government departments, universities, parent groups and educational authorities. Delegates discussed ways in which the educational disadvantage experienced by students in rural and regional areas may be addressed&lt;ref&gt;http://www.une.edu.au/news/archives/000374.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
SiMERR Australia consists of a series of ''hubs'' located in each state in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.une.edu.au/simerr/pages/partnerships_hubs.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims==
SiMERR Australia's vision is to work to improve outcomes for students in science, ICT and mathematics so that:
* Parents can send their children to rural and regional schools and know they will experience equal opportunities for a quality education;
*Students can attend rural or regional schools and realise their academic potential in Science, ICT and Mathematics; and
*Teachers can work in rural and regional schools and be professionally connected and supported.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.une.edu.au/simerr/pages/aboutus_aims.php&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SimSpark''' is a generic simulation system for various multiagent simulations. It supports developing physical simulations for AI and robotics research with an [[open-source software|open-source application]] framework.  It is commonly used in academic research and education.

== History ==
The SimSpark project started in 2003 and was based on the building blocks of the ''Spark'' project.  It was initially developed by [[Marco Kögler]] and [[Oliver Obst]] at the [[University of Koblenz and Landau|University of Koblenz-Landau]] in [[Koblenz]], [[Germany]].

SimSpark was registered with [[SourceForge]] in 2004&lt;ref&gt;http://sourceforge.net/projects/simspark/&lt;/ref&gt; and has an established code base &lt;ref&gt;https://www.ohloh.net/p/simspark/factoids/3252289&lt;/ref&gt; with development increasing year-over-year.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ohloh.net/p/simspark/factoids/3252288&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architecture ==
Agents communicate with the simulation server via [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] or [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]], and therefore can be implemented in any language that supports such sockets.  Multiple software agents can participate in one simulation.

Simulations are created within the server using the [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] language and text-based RSG files.  
SimSpark uses the [[Open Dynamics Engine]] (ODE) for detecting collisions and for simulating rigid body dynamics.  ODE allows accurate simulation of the physical properties of objects such as velocity, inertia and friction.

== Use in RoboCup ==
[[Image:SimSpark-screenshot-with-Nao.png|thumb|SimSpark running RoboCup 3D on Windows 7]]
SimSpark is the simulation engine for the [[RoboCup]] [[RoboCup 3D Soccer Simulation League|3D Soccer Simulation League]]. In this simulation two teams play [[soccer]] with rules similar to regular soccer. The robots use simulated cameras and other sensors such as accelerometers, gyros and touch and audio sensors.  Software agents process signals from these sensors (also known as ''perceptors'') and generate control signals for the 22 hinges within each robot's body in order to achieve whatever forms of motion are required to win a game of soccer.

The original soccer robot model was known as ''soccerbot'', but since 2008 it has been replaced with a [[Nao (robot)|Nao robot]] inspired model.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7658">The '''Teape Lectures''' were established at [[Cambridge University]] in 1955.  They form the major activity of the Teape Trust ([[Charity Commission for England and Wales|Charity No]] 250095), created from an endowment made posthumously by William Marshall Teape (St John's College, Cambridge 1882, died 1945).&lt;ref name=al&gt;{{cite web|title=William Marshall Teape|url=http://www.austlit.edu.au/austlit/page/A45035|publisher=[[AustLit]]|accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The object of the trust is 'The advancement of education by the provision of lectures on the relationship between [[Christian philosophy|Christian]] and [[Hindu philosophy|Hindu]] thought and subject thereto the study of Christian and Hindu religious thought and the promotion of [[Christianity_and_other_religions#Relations_with_Hinduism|Christian-Hindu]] relations'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cambridge University Reporter]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The lectures are among the most prestigious engagements for Christian-Hindu relations, as evidenced from the list of major speakers who have held the appointments, and from the internationally significant publications that have emerged from many of the lecture series.

The lectures are typically delivered in Cambridge by a speaker from India or in India by a speaker with a Cambridge connection.  They reflect a close association between [[Westcott House, Cambridge]] and [[St. Stephen's College, Delhi]].

'''Ted Berrigan''' (November 15, 1934 – July 4, 1983) was an [[American poet]].

==Early life==
Berrigan was born in [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], Rhode Island, on November 15, 1934. After high school, he spent a year at [[Providence College]] before joining the [[U.S. Army]]. After three years in the Army, he finished his college studies at the [[University of Tulsa]] in [[Oklahoma]], where he received a BA in [[English studies|English]] in 1959 and fell just short of the requirements for a [[Master's degree|M.A.]] in 1962. Berrigan was married to Sandy Berrigan, also a poet, and they had two children: David Berrigan and Kate Berrigan. He and his second wife, the poet [[Alice Notley]], were active in the poetry scene in [[Chicago]] for several years, then moved to [[New York City]], where he edited various magazines and books.

==The New York School==
A prominent figure in the second generation of the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] of Poets, Berrigan was peer to [[Jim Carroll]], [[Anselm Hollo]], [[Alice Notley]], [[Ron Padgett]], [[Anne Waldman]], [[Bernadette Mayer]], and [[Lewis Warsh]]. He collaborated with Padgett and [[Joe Brainard]] on ''Bean Spasms'', a work significant in its rejection of traditional concepts of ownership. Though Berrigan, Padgett, and Brainard all wrote individual poems for the book, and collaborated on many others, no authors were listed for individual poems.

In 2005, Ted Berrigan's published and unpublished poetry was published together in a single volume edited by the poet [[Alice Notley]], Berrigan's second wife, and their two sons, [[Anselm Berrigan]], a poet, and Edmund Berrigan, a poet and songwriter.

==''The Sonnets''==
The poet [[Frank O'Hara]] called Berrigan's most significant publication, ''The Sonnets,'' "a fact of modern poetry."  A telling reflection on the era that produced it, ''The Sonnets'' beautifully weaves together traditional elements of the Shakespearean sonnet form with the disjunctive structure and cadence of [[T. S. Eliot]]'s ''[[The Waste Land]]'' and Berrigan's own literary innovations and personal experiences. The product is a composition, in the words of Berrigan's editor and second wife Alice Notley, "[that is] musical, sexy, and funny."

Berrigan was initially drawn to the sonnet form because of its inherent challenge; in his own words, "the form sort of [stultifies] the whole process [of writing]."  The procedure that he ultimately concocted to write ''The Sonnets'' is the essence of the work's novelty and ingenuity.  After attempting several sonnets, Berrigan decided to go back through what he had written and take out certain lines, one line from each work until he had six lines. He then went through the poems backwards and took one more line from each until he had accumulated six more lines, twelve lines total. Based on this body of the work, Berrigan knew what the final couplet would be; this process became the basis for The Sonnets.  Addressing claims that the method is totally mechanical, Berrigan explains that some of the seventy-seven sonnets came to him "whole," not needing to be pieced together.  The poet's preoccupation with style, his concern for form and his own role as the creator as evinced by ''The Sonnets'' pose a challenge to traditional ideas about poetry and signify a fresh and innovative artistic approach.

The book recognizes the eternal possibility for invention in a genre seemingly overwhelmed by the success of its traditional forms{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}.  By imitating the forms and practices of earlier artists and recreating them to express personal ideas and experiences, Berrigan demonstrates the potential for poetry in his and subsequent generations.  As Charles Bernstein succinctly comments, "Part collage, part process writing, part sprung lyric, Ted Berrigan's ''The Sonnets'' remains…one of the freshest and most buoyantly inspired works of contemporary poetry.  Reinventing verse for its time, ''The Sonnets'' are redolent with possibilities for our own.”

==Death==
Berrigan died on July 4, 1983 at the age of 48. The cause of death was cirrhosis of the liver brought on by hepatitis.

'''''The Life Before Her Eyes''''' is a 2007 American [[Thriller (genre)|thriller film]] directed by [[Vadim Perelman]]. The screenplay was adapted by Emil Stern from the [[Laura Kasischke]] novel of the same name. The film stars [[Uma Thurman]] and [[Evan Rachel Wood]]. It was released on April 18, 2008, and revolves around a [[survivor's guilt]] from a [[Columbine High School Massacre|Columbine]]-like event that occurred 15 years previously, which causes her present-day idyllic life to fall apart.

==Plot==
Imaginative, impetuous, and wild Diana McFee ([[Evan Rachel Wood]]) cannot wait for her adult life to begin. While awaiting the final days of high school in the lush springtime, Diana tests her limits with sex and drugs as her more conservative friend Maureen ([[Eva Amurri]]) watches with concern. Then the two teens are involved in a [[Columbine High School massacre|Columbine]]-like shooting incident at their school and are forced to make an impossible choice.

The film mostly focuses on Diana’s adulthood ([[Uma Thurman]]). She leads an apparently normal life as an art history university professor. She has a daughter, Emma (Gabrielle Brennan), and she’s married to the professor who once gave a speech in her school about the power of visualization, how one can shape one’s own future in this way.  However, Diana continues to feel guilty about something that doesn’t let her sleep.

One day she gets a call from Emma’s school, where the nuns running the school complain about Emma's behavior.  At an ice cream parlor, Diana asks Emma not to hide any more as she is always doing; Emma responds to her mother's reproaches with the claim that Diana hates her. They leave the parlor abruptly and as they’re about to get into the car, Diana sees her husband with another woman. She hesitates about confronting him and instead remains in the middle of the street where she is hit by a pickup truck. On her way to the hospital she imagines that blood is escaping from her body.  In reality, she hasn’t been hurt by the accident.  Instead, Diana is remembering the complications she had following an abortion in her high school days.

The day of the 15th anniversary of the shooting, a memorial is held at the school. Diana drives in front of the school several times until she finally decides to stop and bring in some flowers. As she enters the school she’s asked whether she’s one of the survivors. She smiles and walks inside, first leaving flowers on some desks and then moving on to the rest rooms where one of the shootings took place. At that moment she gets a call from Emma’s school informing her that her daughter is missing and that a pink piece of clothing has been found in the woods. She drives there and walks through the woods, shouting out her daughter's name. Emma appears before Diana’s eyes for a moment but then vanishes almost as soon as she has appeared.

It is revealed what occurred fifteen years earlier in the washroom where Diana left the flowers.  She and Maureen had been forced to decide who would survive when confronted by the shooter, Michael Patrick ([[John Magaro]]).  Though Maureen had offered herself first, the shooter questioned why Diana should not die.  In response, Diana agreed to be killed and was shot by Michael, who then killed himself.  At that moment, Diana dreamed the adult life she thought she would have if she let Maureen die and Emma was the child she would have had if she had not gone through the abortion.  

At the anniversary, Diana is asked once again if she is a survivor.  She replies "No" with a smile, with a sense of relief that she did the right thing by dying and having her friend live her life.

'''Thinkswap''' is an online educational platform for secondary and tertiary students across [[Australia]] that provides access to a variety of study resources, including study notes and subject guides, as well as past [[essay]]s and assignments. Thinkswap collates and organises all user-submitted material allowing users to search for content by either [[University]] (or certificate, in the case of secondary school content), down to the specific subject the user is studying. Users can either upload their own content in exchange for credits which they can "swap" for new content, or purchase content directly.

== History ==
Thinkswap was founded by Adam Fasullo whilst studying at the [[University of Technology Sydney]] in 2010 as a means for students to share their own class notes, subject guides and past assignments. He believed that most of this sharing was already occurring amongst group of friends and developed Thinkswap to bring this dynamic online, whereby students would benefit from multiple information sources. Following the full website launch, friends Andrew Romano and Emmanuel Christophorou later joined the company as Directors. The website initially targeted University students in [[New South Wales|NSW]], but it has grown since then and now has coverage across most Universities in each State across Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/digital-life-news/australian-duo-turn-uni-lecture-notes-into-cash-20140729-zy2g0.html|title=Australian duo turn uni lecture notes into cash|last=Grubb|first=Ben|date=2014-07-30|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com.au/yep-that-was-us-what-australian-startup-nexus-notes-learned-after-being-eaten-alive-on-shark-tank-this-week-2015-4|title='Yep, that was us' -- What Australian startup Nexus Notes learned after being eaten alive on Shark Tank this week|last=Heber|first=Alex|date=2015-04-13|newspaper=Business Insider Australia|language=en|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2014, Thinkswap extended its reach to High School students in NSW and is continuing to expand into other states across Australia. In 2015 and 2016, the website made its first physical presence appearing at the [[NSW HSC]] and Careers Expo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hscandcareers.com.au/Exhibitors|title=The HSC and Careers Expo, Exhibitors with|website=www.hscandcareers.com.au|language=en|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==

=== Exchange Credits ===
Exchange credits form the currency of the Thinkswap marketplace. In exchange for uploading a document, users will receive a certain number of exchange credits that can be used to purchase other documents on Thinkswap. Alternatively, exchange credits can be purchased directly giving the user access to the resource instantly. Through the use of Exchange Credits, Thinkswap essentially standardises the value of all uploaded documents, broadly classifying resources as either: Complete Study Notes, Partial Study Notes, or Past Essay / Assignment. In essence, a user uploading content of a certain value will be able to ‘swap’ it for another document of equal value.

== Controversy ==
Whilst Thinkswap reviews all uploaded content, there is no ability to guarantee that the content is the original work of the uploading user. This is particularly the case for past essays / assignments, as well as subject guides, which may contain some [[copyright]] material of the University or school. In order to protect the intellectual property of the original author, Thinkswap is required by law to expeditiously remove content when it is flagged as [[Copyright infringement|infringing copyright]].

Given Thinkswap also accepts past essays and assignments, the website has been criticised in the media as an aid of student cheating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://indaily.com.au/news/2015/02/19/sa-students-targeted-assignment-selling-site/|title=SA students targeted by assignment-selling site - InDaily|date=2015-02-19|newspaper=InDaily|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this, Thinkswap has taken proactive steps to ensure users are aware of the correct use of the platform, including promoting numerous messages around [[plagiarism]] and the website's intention to fully co-operate with Universities in any cases of student cheating suspected to relate to Thinkswap content.

Srinivasa Sastri served as a member of the [[Madras Legislative Council]] from 1913 to 1916, [[Imperial Legislative Council (India)|Imperial Legislative Council of India]] from 1916 to 1919 and the [[Council of State]] from 1920 to 1925. Sastri also functioned as India's delegate to the [[League of Nations]], as member of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom]] and agent to the [[Union of South Africa]].{{Citation needed|reason=there is no reference / citation given for these statements |date=June 2017}}

Sastri gained worldwide fame for his prowess in the English language. He was a close follower of [[Gopal Krishna Gokhale]]. He was also a close friend and associate of [[Mahatma Gandhi]], who addressed Sastri as his "elder brother" in writings. Sastri was made a [[Order of the Companions of Honour|Companion of Honour]] in 1930. In 1921, the [[List of Honorary Freemen of the City of London|Freedom of the City of London]] was conferred on him, and in 1931 he received the Freedom of the City of [[Edinburgh]]. {{Citation needed|reason=there is no reference / citation given for these statements |date=June 2017}}

However, some members of the Indian freedom struggle such as [[Jawaharlal Nehru|Nehru]] felt that Sastri was too sympathetic to the [[British Raj|British rulers]], and too co-operative with them. This was especially apparent at the [[Round Table Conferences (India)|Round table conferences]] where Sastri and his party member agreed to the unfair proposals of the British.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nehru|first1=Jawaharlal|title=An Autobiography|date=1 March 1945|publisher=Bodell|location=Calcutta|edition=1|accessdate=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1894, Srinivasa Sastri was appointed headmaster of Hindu High School, [[Triplicane]] and served for a period of eight years, until &lt;ref name="englishlanguageproud"&gt;{{cite news|title=He did the English language proud|date=26 September 2003|work=The Hindu|author=V. Sundaram|url=http://www.hindu.com/fr/2003/09/26/stories/2003092601490600.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1902. During this period, he achieved fame for his proficiency in English and his good administrative skills. In his late years, he also served as Vice-Chancellor of the [[Annamalai University]].&lt;ref name="ecncylopaediaindianlitp4175" /&gt;&lt;ref name="greatindianpatriots" /&gt; During his tenure as Vice-Chancellor, he demonstrated his scholarship in Sanskrit and Oriental Literature. He persuaded [[R. Raghava Iyengar|Mahavidwan R. Raghava Iyengar]], then Head of the Tamil Research Department, to translate Kalidasan's epic poem ''Abhignana Sakuntalam'' in Tamil. The poem was translated in the Sandam Metre and published in 1938.&lt;ref name="Abhignana Sakuntalam"&gt;{{cite book|title=Abhignana Sakuntalam|author=Mahavidwan R.

== Politics ==

Srinivasa Sastri established the [[Madras Teachers Guild]] during his term as headmaster of Triplicane High School.&lt;ref name="mahatma_thehindu"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mahatma's Dear brother|url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2006/11/14/stories/2006111400740300.htm|date=14 November 2006|work=[[The Hindu]]|author=B.

Srinivasa Sastri met [[Indian independence activist]] [[Gopal Krishna Gokhale]] for the first time in 1906.&lt;ref name="ecncylopaediaindianlitp4175" /&gt; He was drawn towards Gokhale's [[Servants of India Society]] and joined the organization becoming its President in 1915.&lt;ref name="ecncylopaediaindianlitp4175" /&gt;&lt;ref name="houghtonmifflinp1350"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Houghton Mifflin Dictionary of Biography|page=1350|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year=2003|id={{ISBN|061825210X}}, {{ISBN|978-0-618-25210-7}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the [[Indian National Congress]] in 1908 and became the Secretary of the [[Madras district|Madras]] District Congress Committee in 1911.&lt;ref name="ecncylopaediaindianlitp4175" /&gt;&lt;ref name="encyclopaediap4175"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature: Sasay to Zorgot|author=Amaresh Datta|year=1987|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|page=4175}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a member of the Congress, he was instrumental in bringing about a pact between the Congress and the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]].&lt;ref name="houghtonmifflinp1350" /&gt;

Srinivasa Sastri was nominated to the [[Madras Legislative Council]] in 1913 and to the [[Imperial Legislative Council (India)|Imperial Legislative Council of India]] in 1916.&lt;ref name="ecncylopaediaindianlitp4175" /&gt;&lt;ref name="houghtonmifflinp1350"/&gt; He opposed the [[Rowlatt Act]] which empowered the Government of India to imprison anyone without trial and delivered a well-appreciated speech in the Imperial Legislative Council denouncing the bill.&lt;ref name="ecncylopaediaindianlitp4175" /&gt;  In 1919, he was appointed a member of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="ecncylopaediaindianlitp4175" /&gt;

In 1922, Sastri resigned his membership of the Indian National Congress after disagreeing with its leadership on the issue of non-cooperation and established the [[Indian Liberal Party]] along with [[Tej Bahadur Sapru]].&lt;ref name="houghtonmifflinp1350" /&gt; He consequently served as a President of the Indian Liberal Federation. In 1924, he accompanied [[Annie Besant]] on a visit to England demanding [[Home Rule]] for India.&lt;ref name="ecncylopaediaindianlitp4175" /&gt; He also participated in the first and second round table conferences.&lt;ref name="ecncylopaediaindianlitp4175" /&gt;

== International delegations ==

[[File:Sastri washingtonspeech.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Report in ''[[The New York Times]]'' dated 29 January 1922, on the incident at the Town Hall, Washington D. C.]]

Srinivasa Sastri was a part of the delegation of Indian moderates who visited England in 1919.&lt;ref name="ecncylopaediaindianlitp4175" /&gt; He was also a part of the Indian delegation to the Imperial Conference (1921) and the Second session of the [[League of Nations]] in 1921.&lt;ref name="ecncylopaediaindianlitp4175" /&gt;&lt;ref name="secondsession"&gt;{{cite web|title=Second Session of the Assembly|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~league/2ndassemb.htm|publisher=University of Indiana|work=League of Nations Photo Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a member of the Viceregal council, Srinivasa Sastri was also a part of the British delegation which participated in the [[Washington Naval Conference]] and a signatory to the [[Five Power Treaty|Five Power Naval Disarmament Treaty]].&lt;ref name="nytimes_nov61921"&gt;{{cite news|title=PERSONNEL OF DELEGATIONS; UNITED STATES.

In 1922, the Government of India sent Sastri on delegations to Australia, New Zealand and Canada in order to investigate the conditions of Indians living in those countries.&lt;ref name="becomingaus"&gt;{{cite web|title=Muslim Journeys – Becoming Australian|url=http://uncommonlives.naa.gov.au/contents.asp?cID=92|publisher=Government of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to his efforts, the Government of Australia passed the Commonwealth Electoral Act enlarging the franchise to include "natives of British India".&lt;ref name="becomingaus" /&gt;

In 1919, Srinivasa Sastri visited the Union of South Africa along with  [[Sir Benjamin Robertson]] as a part of the delegation which signed the Cape Town Agreement with the Government of South Africa.&lt;ref name="houghtonmifflinp1350" /&gt; As a result of this agreement, South Africa gave up its Class Area Bill intended to segregate Indians in South Africa.&lt;ref name="houghtonmifflinp1350" /&gt; Initially,  [[Jan Smuts]], the Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa, refused to treat Srinivasa Sastri on par with the European delegate.&lt;ref name="bhavanp40"&gt;{{cite book|title=Bhavan's journal, Volume 16|page=40|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|year=1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on Srinivasa Sastri's departure from South Africa as India's [[Agent-General|Agent]] in 1928, Smuts recognized Sastri as the "most respected man in South Africa".&lt;ref name="bhavanp40" /&gt;

Srinivasa Sastri was sent to the [[Federated Malay States]] in 1937, to report on the conditions of the Indian labourers in the country.&lt;ref name="racialdiscriminationp130"&gt;{{cite book|title=Racial discrimination against overseas Indians: a class analysis|page=130|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|year=1990|author=Prakash Chand Jain|id={{ISBN|8170222885}}, {{ISBN|978-81-7022-288-0}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; The delegation submitted a controversial report titled ''Conditions of Indian labour in Malaya'' which was published in Madras and [[Kuala Lumpur]], the very same year.&lt;ref name="racialdiscriminationp130" /&gt; Srinivasa Sastri, being the author of the report, was criticized by Indian nationalists for "his reluctance to comment at length on the political and social status of Indians in Malaya".&lt;ref name="racialdiscriminationp130" /&gt;

== Agent to South Africa ==

[[File:JanSmutsFM.png|thumb|130px|right|[[Jan Smuts]], then Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa, refused to accord Srinivasa Sastri the same welcome that was offered to Sir Benjamin Robertson, a fellow delegate of Sastri.]]

On 27 May 1927, at the behest of [[Mahatma Gandhi]], [[Lord Irwin]], the [[Viceroy of India]], appointed Srinivasa Sastri as India's first [[Agent-General|Agent]] to the [[Union of South Africa]]. Srinivasa Sastri arrived in South Africa in June 1927 and served as Agent till January 1929.&lt;ref name="sa_history_timeline_1920s"&gt;{{cite web|title=South African History Timelines – 1920s|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/chronology/general/1920s.html|publisher=South African History Online (SAHO)|access-date=18 October 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091014100639/http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/chronology/general/1920s.html|archive-date=14 October 2009|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after taking over, Srinivasa Sastri successfully pressurized the South African government to withdraw Section 5 of the Immigration and Indian Relief (Further Provision) Bill which empowered South African immigration officers and boards to cancel registration certificates.&lt;ref name="sa_history_timeline_1920s" /&gt; Through his efforts, the Natal Commission for Indian Education was appointed on 17 November 1927.&lt;ref name="sa_history_timeline_1920s" /&gt; With Sastri's support and encouragement, dissidents of the Transvaal British Indian Association (TBIA) founded the Transvaal Indian Congress (TIC) on 18 December 1927.&lt;ref name="sa_history_timeline_1920s" /&gt; The TBIA later merged with the South African Indian Congress. Section 104 of the Liquor Bill prohibiting Indians from entering licensed premises was withdrawn.&lt;ref name="sa_history_timeline_1920s" /&gt; The Thornton Committee was established in 1928 to investigate the sanitary conditions of Indians in and around Durban.&lt;ref name="sa_history_timeline_1920s" /&gt;

During the early part of Sastri's tenure, a number of [[Racial segregation|segregationary]] laws were passed targeting Indians and Indian immigrants in South Africa.&lt;ref name="sa_history_timeline_1920s" /&gt; The period also witnessed the establishment of a number of trade unions.&lt;ref name="sa_history_timeline_1920s" /&gt;  Sastri campaigned against racial segregation of Indians and got the Class Area Bill segregating Indians withdrawn.&lt;ref name="houghtonmifflinp1350" /&gt;

Sastri returned to India in January 1929 and was succeeded by [[Kurma Venkata Reddy Naidu]].&lt;ref name="sa_history_timeline_1920s" /&gt;

== Later life and death ==
[[File:Vssrinivasasastri1921.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Srinivasa Sastri (right) in 1921]]
In 1930, Sastri was appointed a member of the Royal Commission on Labour in India.&lt;ref name="industriallabourp66"&gt;{{cite book|title=Industrial labour in India: Its Studies and reports, Series A (Industrial relations) ; no. 41|publisher=International Labour Office|page=66|year=1938}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 1930–31, he participated in the Round Table Conferences in London to discuss India's future and was instrumental in bringing about the Gandhi-Irwin Pact.&lt;ref name="transferofpowerp46"&gt;{{cite book|title=Transfer of Power in India|page=46|author=V.

In June 1940, the Government of Madras appointed a committee headed by Srinivasa Sastri to frame a set of general principles for coining words for scientific and technical terms in vernacular languages.&lt;ref name="coffeep149"&gt;{{cite book | last =  Vēṅkaṭācalapati  | first =  Ā.

M. Subramania Pillai who felt that Srinivasa Sastri was biased in favour of Sanskrit and hence, Anti-Tamil.&lt;ref name="coffeep150" /&gt; The committee submitted its report after three months recommending the retention of the existing Sanskrit loanwords in Tamil and rejecting the need for them to be replaced.&lt;ref name="coffeep151"&gt;{{cite book | last =  Vēṅkaṭācalapati  | first =  Ā.

The committee was eventually reshuffled by Provincial Education Minister [[T. S. Avinashilingam Chettiar]] soon after the demise of Srinivasa Sastri and balanced with the introduction of more members supporting the replacement of Sanskrit loan words.&lt;ref name="coffeep156"&gt;{{cite book | last =  Vēṅkaṭācalapati  | first =  Ā.

Srinivasa Sastri's health began to deteriorate in early 1946.&lt;ref name="kodandaraop434"&gt;[[#Kodanda Rao|Kodanda Rao]], Pg 434&lt;/ref&gt; In January, Srinivasa Sastri was admitted to the General Hospital, Madras.&lt;ref name="kodandaraop434" /&gt; He died at 10:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. on 17 April at the age of 76.&lt;ref name="greatindianpatriots" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=R.

== Silver-Tongued Orator of the British Empire ==

Srinivasa Sastri was known for his mastery over the English language and his oratory.{{Citation needed|reason=there is no reference / citation given for these statements |date=June 2017}} As a student, he once corrected a few passages in [[J. C. Nesfield]]'s ''English Grammar''.{{Citation needed|reason=there is no reference / citation given for these statements |date=June 2017}} Whenever he was on visit to the United Kingdom, Sastri was often consulted over spellings and pronunciations.{{Citation needed|reason=there is no reference / citation given for these statements |date=June 2017}} His mastery over the English language was recognized by [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]], [[Winston Churchill]], [[Constance Lytton|Lady Lytton]] and [[Arthur Balfour|Lord Balfour]]&lt;ref name="greatindianpatriots" /&gt; who rated him amongst the five best English-language orators of the century.&lt;ref name="englishlanguageproud" /&gt;&lt;ref name="indianenglishp362"&gt;{{cite book|title=Indian writing in English|author=K. R. Srinivasa Iyengar|publisher=Asia Publishing House|year=1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Master of Balliol, Arthur Lionel Smith swore that he had never realized the beauty of the English language until he heard Sastri.&lt;ref name="indianenglishp362" /&gt; while Lord Balfour remarked that listening to Srinivasa Sastri made him realise the heights to which the English language could rise.&lt;ref name="greatindianpatriots" /&gt; Thomas Smart conferred upon Sastri the appellation "Silver Tongued Orator of the British Empire"&lt;ref name="tmrp311"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Modern Review, Vol 118|page=311|publisher=Prabasi Press Private, Ltd|year=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he was so called all over the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="englishlanguageproud" /&gt; Srinivasa Sastri's inspirations were [[William Shakespeare]], [[Sir Walter Scott]], [[George Eliot]], [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Thomas W. Harvey|Thomas Harvey]], [[Victor Hugo]] and [[Valmiki]] - Indian sage and the author of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] epic ''[[Ramayana]]''.&lt;ref name="greatindianpatriots" /&gt;

However, others noticed that Sastri often repeated the rhetoric of the [[British Raj|British empire]]. In a meeting with students in [[Lucknow]] in 1991, he advised students to follow the rules laid out by the British colonial government and not to disobey them. Some time later, when [[Annie Besant]] was interned due to her idea regarding [[Indian Home Rule movement|Home rule]], Sastry fell silent when followers of Besant and [[Servants of India Society|Servants of India]] needed guidance the most. This led Nehru to later comment in his [[An Autobiography (Nehru)|autobiography]] that while Sastri was an excellent orator, he appeared to advocate mute submission and was not very effective in times of crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nehru |first1=Jawaharlal |title=An Autobiography |date=1 July 1936 |publisher=Bodley Head |location=London |accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Srinivasa Sastri corrected mistakes in the manuscript of ''[[The Story of My Experiments with Truth]]'', the English translation of Gandhi's autobiography and also successive issues of the magazine ''[[Harijan]]'' that was edited by Mahatma Gandhi.&lt;ref name="greatindianpatriots" /&gt;

In 1994 Yerevan State of Art and Theater was divided into State Academy of Fine Arts and Yerevan State Institute of Theater,&lt;ref name="ЕГХА"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yafa.am/en/ |title=Ереванская государственная художественная академия |publisher= |accessdate=2015-04-11 |lang=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Institute became independent institution and till nowadays works as Yerevan State Institute of Theatre and Cinematography.&lt;ref name="ЕГИТиК" /&gt; 

== History ==
Theater in Armenia has a centuries-old history and dates back to pagan rituals, for example, worship of death and resurrection of God Gisane – [[Ara the Beautiful]]&lt;ref&gt;"[[Гисане|ГИСАНЭ]] - в армянской мифологии умирающий и воскресающий бог животворящей природы, ипостась [[Дионис]]а. Другое наименование - Ара Прекрасный. Служители в храме Г. назывались гусаны. Это наименование перешло в эллинистич. Армении на актёров, т. к. театральное искусство было связано с культом предков. Обряд погребения Г. с участием гусанов был перенесён в церемонии похорон представителей знати. Дзайнарку-гусаны (оплакивающие) изображали подвиги усопшего "пением, показом и танцем под звуки пандпра" (Мовсес Хоренаци, 5 в.). До 18 в. армянские актёры сохраняли культовый атрибут Г. - головной убор, изображавший хвост кометы." — {{cite book| author = Театральная энциклопедия. Гл. ред. [[Мокульский, Стефан Стефанович|С. С.

Armenian tragedy dzajnarku-gusan and vohbergak, comedy genre katakergak and kataka-gusan, known from 1 century b.c., served as a base for further development of professional theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.theatre-enc.ru/html/a/arm8nskiy-teatr.html|title= Армянский театр |publisher=Театральная энциклопедия |accessdate=2015-04-11 |lang=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;
