In the '''1920s in Angola''' mining became the primary source of revenue for the colonial government.&lt;ref name=a&gt;{{cite book|last=Boahen|first=A. Adu|year=1990|title=Africa Under Colonial Domination, 1880-1935|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
Comphania de Diamantes de Angola, the [[Diamang]] diamond company of Angola, was established in 1920. The government maintained a 5% stake in the company, gave it a thirty-year lease to mine diamonds, and allowed it to operate without paying taxes or import tariffs. The company employed 10,000 workers and attracted investment from [[South Africa]]. In 1922, the Anglo American diamond company purchased a 16% stake in [[Diamang]]. The [[London Diamond Syndicate]] agreed to buy {{convert|125000|carat|kg}} from [[Angola]] annually. Under the rule of Governor General Norton de Matos, the colonial government spent 13 million pounds to bring 9,000 immigrants from [[Portugal]], expanding construction of [[Benguela railway]] and roads. The settler population reached 36,000 by 1924.&lt;ref name=b&gt;{{cite book|last=Fage|first=John Donnelly|year=1986|title=The Cambridge History of Africa|pages=526–527}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1929, mined resources made up 25% of Angola's exports, 600,000 pound sterling.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;

'''Air Dream''' was a short-lived [[charter airline]] based in [[Cambodia]]. During 2007, it operated flights between [[Siem Reap]], Cambodia, and Hanoi, [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.vietnamnet.vn/social/2008/06/787746/ Vietnam Net News: Foreign aircraft abandoned at Noi Bai Airport] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612222339/http://english.vietnamnet.vn/social/2008/06/787746/ |date=2008-06-12 }}, 10 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Its single aircraft, chartered from financially troubled [[Royal Khmer Airlines]], was flown to [[Noi Bai International Airport]], [[Hanoi]], in late 2007 for maintenance reasons and abandoned there subsequently, as the airline was shut down.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7446469.stm  Plane abandoned at Hanoi airport], BBC, 10 June 2008.

[[File:Alan_Freeman.gif|thumb|right|Alan Freeman]]
'''Alan Leslie "Fluff" Freeman''', [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] (6 July 1927 – 27 November 2006) was an Australian-born British [[disc jockey]] and radio personality in the United Kingdom for 40 years, best known for presenting ''[[Pick of the Pops]] ''from 1961 to 2000.

==Career==
Born and educated in New South Wales, Australia, Freeman worked as an assistant paymaster/accountant for one of Australia's largest timber companies after leaving school.

Freeman originally wanted to be an opera singer but decided his voice was not strong enough. He was invited to audition as a radio announcer in 1952 and commenced working for [[7LA]] in [[Tasmania]], known as the teenager's station. Freeman's duties included continuity announcer, presenter of musical programmes incorporating opera, ballet and classical music, DJ for the top 100, news reader, quiz master and commercials reader.

After moving to radio station [[3KZ]] in Melbourne, in 1957 he took a nine-month trip around the world, with the promise to return to Melbourne by January 1958. He arrived in London and on deciding to stay wrote numerous letters of delay and later apology, to his former employer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aircheck Tracker&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |url=http://www.geocities.com/thehotw/AlanFreemantracker.htm |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kmFJAnST?url=http://www.geocities.com/thehotw/AlanFreemantracker.htm |archivedate=25 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freeman began his British career as a summer relief disc jockey on [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]] and continued to present late-evening programmes on the station until the early 1970s. He gained his nickname "Fluff" as a result of a fluffy jumper that he was fond of wearing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/2940413.stm "Obituary: Alan 'Fluff' Freeman"], BBC News, 28 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960 he moved to the [[BBC Light Programme]] as presenter of the ''Records Around Five'' show, which was introduced by his signature tune, "[[At the Sign of the Swingin' Cymbal]]", written by [[Brian Fahey (composer)|Brian Fahey]]. The more upbeat version performed by 'Brass Incorporated' was introduced in April 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/nov/29/guardianobituaries.media|title=Obituary: Alan Freeman|author=Adam Sweeting|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1961 he introduced ''[[Pick of the Pops]]'' as part of a Saturday evening show ''Trad Tavern''. ''Pick Of The Pops'' became a permanent show in its own right in 1962, with Freeman presenting it until 24 September 1972 and continuing with his 'Swingin' Cymbal' signature tune. At the same time, he was one of the original team of presenters of BBC TV's ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', a regular member of the ''[[Juke Box Jury]]'' panel and had a brief stint as compere of the lunchtime pop music show ''[[Go Man Go]]'' on the [[BBC Light Programme]] in 1963. In 1968 he presented a music magazine-style television show for the BBC, ''All Systems Freeman'', which aired for several weeks on Friday evening, but despite good reviews did not return for a second series.

In 1962 he recorded a dance single, "Madison Time", with the Talmy Stone Band. Released by [[Decca Records]], F11523, it was reportedly one of the label's worst-ever sellers.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In April 1972, Freeman joined the daily presenters on [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]], taking over the 3–5 p.m. show from [[Terry Wogan]]. He used "[[Soul Bossa Nova]]" by [[Quincy Jones]] as his theme until 1 June 1973. During this time he spotlighted youth clubs and young people and became Vice-President of the [[London Association of Youth Clubs]]. During the 1970s he also presented the Radio 1 series ''Quiz Kid'' on Sunday evenings, which was recorded at youth clubs and boys' clubs all over the country; while on Saturday afternoons he presented his ''Rock Show'', featuring heavy and progressive rock and a rundown of the album chart, from 30 June 1973 to 26 August 1978. He presented the original version of ''The Story of Pop'' as a 26-part Radio 1 series in 1973–74. From 1975 to 1977, Freeman presented the Radio 2 musical game show ''Free Spin''. In addition he lent his name to several rock and classical compilation albums, the best-known being "By Invitation Only" (1976), a collection of material sourced from artists on the [[Atlantic]] label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| first= John| last= Van der Kiste| year= 2016| title= Pop Pickers and Music Vendors| publisher= Fonthill Media| location= Stroud| isbn= | page= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freeman left the BBC to work for [[Capital London|Capital Radio]] from 1979 to 1988, presenting the Top 40 of the 70s, on 31 December 1979. He later revived ''Pick of the Pops'' on 13 March 1982 (now called ''Pick of the Pops Take Two'', combining the current Top 15 with an earlier chart) and ''The Rock Show'' previous to that on 7 January 1980. He returned to the BBC and Radio 1 in January 1989 to revive ''The Rock Show'' and ''Pick of the Pops''. This run of ''Pick of the Pops'' ended on 27 December 1992 but he continued to host ''The Rock Show'' until 23 October 1993, when he, with other long-serving DJs, left the station as it was revamped by controller [[Matthew Bannister]]. In 1990, he appeared as a celebrity guest on the television series [[You Bet!]], made by [[London Weekend Television]] and hosted by Sir [[Bruce Forsyth]]. He was the subject of ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'' in 1987 when he was surprised by [[Eamonn Andrews]].

In December 1993, he presented the ''Alternative Chart Show'' on a trial one-off [[Restricted Service Licence]] (RSL) broadcast by [[XFM]] in [[London]]. Throughout 1994 he presented a revised and expanded version of the Radio 1 series ''The Story of Pop'', broadcast in 52 hour-long episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epguides.com/StoryofPop/ |title=Epguides |publisher=Epguides.com |accessdate=4 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120628210836/http://epguides.com/StoryofPop/ |archivedate=28 June 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He then hosted ''Pick of the Pops Take Three'' on [[Gold (radio)|Capital Gold]] from April 1994 until January 1997. In 1996 and 1997 he also hosted ''The Friday Rock Show'' on [[Virgin Radio]] and was heard presenting one-off shows on [[Classic FM (UK)|Classic FM]].

In 1998 he was awarded the [[MBE]] for services to broadcasting.

He returned to the BBC on [[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2]], taking ''Pick of the Pops'' back to its home, from 1997 until 2000. A lifetime love of [[classical music]] and particularly [[opera]] was developed in the show ''Their Greatest Bits'', which resulted in another compilation CD on the [[BBC Records|BBC]] label. Throughout his career, he was well-known especially for his jingles, which integrated short bursts of classical music and hard rock segued together, as well as his catchphrases, including 'Hi there, pop pickers!', which later became 'Greetings, music lovers!' on his classical shows, and 'All right?', right, stay bright' and frequently 'Not arf!'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| first= John| last= Van der Kiste| year= 2016| title= Pop Pickers and Music Vendors| publisher= Fonthill Media| location= Stroud| isbn= | page= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[arthritis]] got the better of his hands, he handed ''Pick of the Pops'' over to ex-[[96 Trent FM|Radio Trent]] DJ [[Dale Winton]] who hosted it until 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/683704.stm | work=BBC News | title=Fluff's farewell to pop pickers | date=20 March 2000 | accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Acting ===
Freeman acted in the horror film ''[[Dr. Terror's House of Horrors]]'' (1965) and the rock musical ''[[Absolute Beginners (film)|Absolute Beginners]]'' (1986), and played himself or a similar character in films such as ''[[It's Trad, Dad!]]'' (1962), ''[[Just for Fun (film)|Just for Fun]]'' (1963) and ''[[Sebastian (1968 film)|Sebastian]]'' (1968). He also played God (albeit a God who sat at a [[mixing desk]] and said "Alright?") in two episodes of ''[[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]]'' in 1984. Freeman also appeared in TV advertisements for Brentford Nylons and for [[Omo (detergent)|Omo]] "with exclusive WM7 for perfect whiteness."

=== Recognition ===
Freeman's style has been parodied, and he was the model for [[Harry Enfield]]'s character [[Smashie and Nicey|Dave Nice]], although he contributed to the [[satire]] himself in good grace by appearing on Enfield's show (and Enfield himself praised Freeman in [[Simon Garfield]]'s book on Radio 1, ''The Nation's Favourite'', by categorising him along with [[John Peel]] as "DJs who loved music" as opposed to "DJs who loved the sound of their own voices, like [[Dave Lee Travis]]").

For all Freeman's supposed [[clichés]] and [[archetype]]s in his broadcasting style, he has been regarded as original by fellow broadcasters. When he appeared on [[John Peel]]'s ''[[This Is Your Life]]'', Peel said: "Fluff is the greatest out-and-out disc jockey of them all".

After Freeman's death, [[Robin Gibb]] wrote a tribute "[[Alan Freeman Days]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.robingibb.com/news/2008/05/15/alan_freeman_days|title=Alan Freeman Days|last=|first=|date=15 May 2008|website=robingibb.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619083555/http://www.robingibb.com/news/2008/05/15/alan_freeman_days|archive-date=19 June 2008|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recorded in August 2007, the song was included on Gibb's first posthumous album ''[[50 St. Catherine's Drive]]'' in 2014.

==Honours==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2216">'''''Alger républicain''''' (''Republican Algeria'', الجزائر الجمهورية) is an [[Arabic language]] [[Algeria]]n [[List of newspapers in Algeria|newspaper]] published in [[Algeria]]. 

==History and profile==
''Alger républicain'' was founded in October 1938,&lt;ref name=mark&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Orme|title=The Development of Albert Camus's Concern for Social and Political Justice: "justice Pour Un Juste"|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VGBSVdHwmUYC&amp;pg=PA66|accessdate=11 September 2014|date=1 January 2007|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press|isbn=978-0-8386-4110-1|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; and intermittently published ever since. In its initial phase the paper declared itself as "the honest newspaper of the honest people".&lt;ref name=mark/&gt; It is close to the [[Algerian Communist Party|Algerian communist movement]], without having been an official party publication. However, the movement controlled the paper in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Ottaway|author2=Marina Ottaway|title=Algeria: The Politics of a Socialist Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bp8IfVxOcEQC&amp;pg=PA183|accessdate=11 September 2014|date=1 January 1970|publisher=University of California Press|page=183|id=GGKEY:TN91X5AFRUD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The paper was edited by the French-Algerian communist and anti-colonial activist [[Henri Alleg]] from 1951, as a major daily newspaper. Despite censorship and confiscation of copies by the French authorities, it had become perhaps the largest daily in Algeria at independence in 1962, having featured a number of prominent writers and journalists, including [[Albert Camus]] and [[Kateb Yacine]]. Alger républicain was banned in 1965 by the government of [[Houari Boumédiène]], but later refounded by Alleg and others in exile. In 1994, it ceased regular publication, but has since returned under Alleg's editorship, and is now on sale in Algeria again.

'''Bedfordshire''' was a [[European Parliament constituency|constituency]] of the [[European Parliament]] located in the [[United Kingdom]], electing one [[Member of the European Parliament]] by the [[first-past-the-post]] electoral system. Created in [[European Parliament election, 1979 (United Kingdom)|1979]] for the first elections to the European Parliament, it was abolished in 1984 and succeeded by [[Cambridge and Bedfordshire North (European Parliament constituency)|Cambridge and Bedfordshire North]] and [[Bedfordshire South (European Parliament constituency)|Bedfordshire South]].

==Boundaries==

It consisted of the [[List of United Kingdom Parliament constituencies|parliamentary constituencies]] of [[Bedford (UK Parliament constituency)|Bedford]], [[Mid Bedfordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Mid Bedfordshire]], [[South Bedfordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|South Bedfordshire]], [[Hemel Hempstead (UK Parliament constituency)|Hemel Hempstead]], [[Hitchin (UK Parliament constituency)|Hitchin]], [[Luton East (UK Parliament constituency)|Luton East]], and [[Luton West (UK Parliament constituency)|Luton West]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Boundary Commission for England]], ''European Assembly Constituencies'', December 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

When it was abolished in 1984, the subsequent seats were based on the parliamentary constituencies created by the 1983 boundary changes. The area covered by the new parliamentary constituencies of Mid Bedfordshire and [[North Bedfordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North Bedfordshire]] became part of the [[Cambridge and Bedfordshire North (European Parliament constituency)|Cambridge and Bedfordshire North]] constituency, while the new constituencies of [[South West Bedfordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|South West Bedfordshire]], [[Stevenage (UK Parliament constituency)|Stevenage]], [[West Hertfordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|West Hertfordshire]], [[Luton North (UK Parliament constituency)|Luton North]] and [[Luton South (UK Parliament constituency)|Luton South]] were transferred to [[Bedfordshire South (European Parliament constituency)|Bedfordshire South]].&lt;ref&gt;European Parliament Information Office, ''MEPs and their constituencies'', December 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bäsk''' (Swedish for "bitter") is a [[Alcoholic beverages in Sweden|Swedish]] style spiced [[Brännvin|liquor]] flavored with [[Artemisia absinthium|wormwood]] ("malört" in [[Swedish language|Swedish]]).  [[Sweden]] is one of the few countries that have never banned [[absinthe]] or other wormwood-flavored liquors.

In the United States, the [[Chicago]]-based brand [[Jeppson's Malört]] is one of the most well-known versions of the liquor.

Bäsk is said to be [[digestif|good for]] [[digestion]], and therefore is traditionally associated with fatty foods.

CIQM originally operated as "Q103" at 103.1 FM (now the home of [[CFHK-FM]] in St. Thomas) from its sign-on in 1986 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/1986/DB86-19.HTM Decision CRTC 86-19]&lt;/ref&gt; until moving to the 97.5 frequency vacated by CKO in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/1993/DB93-20.htm Decision CRTC 93-20]&lt;/ref&gt; For many years, the station was known as "Q97.5," even after taking on the "[[EZ Rock]]" trademark; in [[2006 in radio|2006]], the "Q" was dropped and the station became known as simply "97.5, London's EZ Rock."

[[File:CIQM FM.png|thumb|EZ Rock logo 2010-2012]]
On September 6, 2010, CIQM underwent several changes, including a tweak in branding (as "The New Sound of EZ Rock"), a new logo and new on-air staff.  The station moved from its 24-year-old [[adult contemporary]] format to [[hot adult contemporary]].  The switch was due to rival [[CKOT-FM]] switching from [[easy listening]] to a gold-based [[Soft AC]] mix, and also because of rimshot rivals [[CIHR-FM]] and [[CHGK-FM]], both mainstream AC stations, also being heard in London.  The station also dropped the decimal point from the station ID after flipping to [[Hot AC]].  Just after the format tweak, Astral switched CIQM's jingles from the [[adult hits]] jingles to the [[hot adult contemporary]] jingles. Despite all of the changes, CIQM, which once dominated the market, suffered from ratings erosion, and had the lowest share in the London CMA, and was a distant second place behind CKOT.

On August 13, 2012, CIQM began stunting with jockless music, as well as their website being replaced by a countdown clock, informing listeners to tune in August 17 at 8 AM. At that time, the station flipped to [[contemporary hit radio|CHR]], becoming the 5th station in Canada (10th overall, including [[CKQB-FM|CKQB]] in [[Ottawa]], although that station reverted to its previous "Bear" branding (and has since flipped to CHR), [[CKZZ-FM|CKZZ]] in [[Vancouver]] (though they are considered Hot AC, and has since reverted to its former "Z95.3" branding), and [[CFBT-FM|CFBT]] in Vancouver) using the "Virgin Radio" branding. The final song on '''EZ Rock''' was "[[Rehab (Amy Winehouse song)|Rehab]]" by [[Amy Winehouse]], while the first song on '''Virgin Radio''' was "[[Pound The Alarm]]" by [[Nicki Minaj]].&lt;ref&gt;https://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/69607/ez-rock-stunting-in-london/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://formatchange.com/ezrock-becomes-virgin-radio/&lt;/ref&gt; The station has a full-time air staff, as well as the London affiliate for [[On Air with Ryan Seacrest (radio)|On Air with Ryan Seacrest]]. Longtime rival [[CFHK-FM|CFHK]] became once again the market's only [[hot adult contemporary]] station. CIQM-FM's flip to [[contemporary hit radio]] filled the Top 40 void in London for the first time since 2004, when CFHK dropped it in favour of its current Hot AC format.

As part of Astral's merger with [[Bell Media]] on June 27, 2013, CIQM is now owned by Bell Media.

"'''Draumur um Nínu'''" ([[English language|English]] translation: "'''The dream about Nina'''", sometimes known as "'''Nína'''") was the [[Iceland]]ic entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1991]], performed in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] by [[Eyjólfur Kristjánsson]] and [[Stefán Hilmarsson]] under the name "[[Stefán &amp; Eyfi]]". Although the song did not fare too well in the contest it has remained one of Iceland's most popular songs of all time, still receiving regular airplay. An indication of the song's enduring popularity is that when it is played in Reykjavik bars and nightclubs the patrons usually join in.

The song, with its catchy piano intro, is a ballad, with the singers expressing their love for the titular Nina. It appears that she can never be with them, however the reason for this is never explained.
In 2002, Eyjólfur and Stefán performed the song at a concert in the Reykjavík City Theatre. The concert was recorded and the recordings were released on a CD.

At the contest, it was performed second on the night (following [[Yugoslavia]]'s [[Bebi Dol]] with [[Aquarela do Brasil|Brazil]] and preceding [[Malta]]'s [[Georgina Abela|Georgina]] and [[Paul Giordimana]] with [[Could It Be (Georgina &amp; Paul Giordimaina song)|Could It Be]]). At the close of voting, it had received 26 points, placing 15th in a field of 22.

It was succeeded as [[Iceland in the Eurovision Song Contest|Icelandic representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1992|1992 Contest]] by [[Heart 2 Heart (band)|Heart 2 Heart]] with [[Nei eða já]].

'''Dublinia''' is a historical recreation (or [[living history]]) museum and visitor attraction in [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]], focusing on the [[Viking]] and [[Medieval]] history of the city. Dublinia is located in a part of Dublin's [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christ Church Cathedral]], known as the [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin#Synod hall and bridge|Synod hall]].

Dublinia features [[historical reenactment]], with actors playing the roles of Vikings and Medieval Dubliners (in full costume) and encourages visitors to join in. It has recreations of Viking and Medieval era buildings (houses, etc) and street scenes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dublinia.ie/exhibitions_dublin-page.html Dublinia - Exhibitions] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120719075004/http://www.dublinia.ie/exhibitions_dublin-page.html |date=July 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhibition was opened in 1993,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/vikings-invade-for-the-return-of-dublinia-2177967.html|title=Vikings invade for the return of Dublinia|date=May 13, 2010|accessdate=10 November 2012|author=Michael McHale|work=[[Irish Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was redeveloped in 2010 at a cost of €2 million. The museum attracts over 125,000 visitors per annum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2010/0512/breaking72.html|title=Dublinia unveils its €2m facelift|date=5 May 2010|accessdate=10 November 2012|work=[[Irish Times]]{{Subscription required|date=February 2014}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Et Cetera"''' is a song by [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] singer [[Sinéad Mulvey]] and rock band [[Black Daisy]] that represented [[Ireland in the Eurovision Song Contest 2009|Ireland]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2009]] in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]]. The song was composed by a multinational songwriting team of Niall Mooney of Ireland, [[Jonas Gladnikoff]] of [[Sweden]], [http://www.danielemoretti.it/home.htm?lingua=en/ Daniele Moretti] of [[Italy]] and Christina Schilling of [[Denmark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oikotimes.com/v2/index.php?file=articles&amp;id=5177|title=Et Cetera wins Irish national final|last=Fisher|first=Luke|date=2009-02-20|publisher=''Oikotimes''|accessdate=2009-02-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224144116/http://www.oikotimes.com/v2/index.php?file=articles&amp;id=5177|archivedate=2009-02-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/13315|title=Ireland: Sinead Mulvey &amp; Black Daisy to Eurovision|last=Klier|first=Marcus|date=2009-02-20|publisher=''ESCToday''|accessdate=2009-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song competed in the second semi-final on 14 May 2009 but failed to qualify for the final, making it the second time in a row and the third time in 5  years the nation failed to make it to the final.

It was chosen on 20 February 2009 as part of [[The Late Late Show (season 47)|a special edition]] of chat show ''[[The Late Late Show (Ireland)|The Late Late Show]]'' which had [[Jerry Springer]], [[Marty Whelan]] and [[Linda Martin]] reviewing the six entries competing to go to Moscow. It  won with 78 points from a possible 80, awarded in two phases, phase one by national juries and phase two by the viewers.

The song was released as a single by [[Sony BMG]] on 1 May in Ireland, as both a physical CD single and as a digital download.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/13833|title=Ireland: Sony snap up Sinead|last=Darby|first=Harry|date=2009-04-29|publisher=''ESCToday''|accessdate=2009-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It debuted on the Irish charts at #15 and peaked at #6.&lt;ref&gt;[http://acharts.us/song/43494 Irish Singles Chart] Accessed May 16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2864">'''Ev iyesi''' ({{lang-tt|Öy İyäse}} or {{lang|tt|Öy Atası}}, sometimes ''Өй бәкчәсе'' "House Guard") is a [[household deity]] in [[Turkish mythology]]. Also known as '''Uy (Oy) iyesi''' or '''Yurt iyesi'''.

Ev iyesi is a deity or spirit that protects the home, looking after the entire household or certain key members.

==Meaning of iye==
Ev İyesi is a house spirit in Turkish / Turkic folklore. Usually İye has the meaning of "[[familiar spirit]]". He is masculine, typically small and bearded.  He takes on the appearance of current or former owners of the house and have a grey beard. In Anatolia he is known as ''Sahab'' or ''Kimsene''.

===In Turkish Folklore===
Traditionally, every house is said to have its ''iye''. The word "''iye''" means owner, master, possessor, etc. It does not do evil unless angered by a family’s poor keep of the household, profane language or neglect. He is seen as the home's guardian, and he sometimes helps with household chores and field work. Some even treat them as part of the family, albeit an unseen one, and leave them gifts like milk in the kitchen overnight. It is said the favorite place for these spirits to live is either the threshold under the door or under the stove. The center of the house is also said to be their domain. Ev İyesi maintains peace and order, and rewards a well-maintained household. Some peasants feed him nightly in return for protection of their house. When a new house was built, Anatolian people would attract the İye to take to the new house.

==Similar creatures==
# '''Eşik iyesi''' or '''Astana iyesi''' (Spirit of doorstep) is a some kind of Ev iyesi. Even they are synonymous. It lives on the threshold (doorstone) of the house.
# '''Mutfak iyesi''' or '''Aşlık İyesi''' lives in kitchen.
# '''Evlik İyesi''' or '''Ambar İyesi''' is the protector spirit of cellar or larder.

'''L'Esposizione Internazionale Specializzata Genova '92 - Colombo '92''' (in English ''International Exhibition Genoa '92 - Colombo '92'') or more informally '''Expo 1992''', held in [[Genoa]], [[Italy]] from 15 May to 15 August 1992. The theme was "[[Christopher Columbus]], The Ship and the Sea", and the Expo was timed to celebrate the 500 years since the Discovery of America by the Genoese sailor Christopher Columbus. Because of the theme, the expo was also known as ''Colombiadi''. It was a specialized Exhibition with 54 countries represented. Total visitors were 694,800.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.expo2010.cn/expo/expo_english/oe/awe/wes/userobject1ai36209.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816170535/http://en.expo2010.cn/expo/expo_english/oe/awe/wes/userobject1ai36209.html |archivedate=2011-08-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although not related, the exposition ran at the same time as [[Seville Expo '92]]. The expo's logo was a "500" number with the Genoa's flag; the mascot was a cat dressed like Christopher Columbus called "Gatto Cristoforo"

==Exposition==
The International Exposition of Genoa '92 was held at the [[Genoa#Old harbour|Porto Antico]] and allowed the entire redesign of the area, designed by the architect [[Renzo Piano]]. The aquarium hosted the sea's pavilion and the ship "Italia" hosted the ship's pavilion. Other important places were "Piazza delle Feste", a covered square, the "Magazzini del Cotone" an old port structure which now host the conference centre, "Porta Siberia" an historical port's fortress and the "Palazzina Millo".

==Participants==
54 countries attended the event officially (three unofficially) and, initially, it was announced that the Expo reached about 1.7 million visitors, of 3,000,000 provided,&lt;ref&gt;[http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1992/ottobre/22/menti_sull_Expo_sindaco_dimissionario_co_7_9210222227.shtml Menti' sull' Expo: sindaco dimissionario], articolo de [[Il Corriere della Sera]], del 22 ottobre 1992&lt;/ref&gt; but the count was later revised in only about 800,000 visitors. In the fall of 1992 it was discovered that the actual visitors were less than what was announced at first, and that the Ente Colombo, who ran the event, had collected only 13 billion compared to 45 billion planned. Because of the false news circulated and the lack of success of the event, the Mayor Romano Merlo, who was also president of Colombo, resigned and was replaced by Deputy Mayor [[Claudio Burlando]].

The guest of honor was the Government of the Bahamas, where Christopher Columbus first landed in the Americas on the island of [[Guanahani]]. Sculptures called "Obelisk" by Alessandro Matta and "Dolphin" by Bruno Elisei were displayed nn the Bahamian hall, in homage to the Columbus.&lt;ref&gt;(cat. uff.

Family of the [[Athenian]] nobility of the late [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] years. The name of the family seems to originate from the usual title of the members of the local governing councils of the [[Greeks|Greek]] communities during late medieval and early Ottoman years ([[Gerontes]], meaning the "Elders", or [[Dimogerontes]]). Several [[Prokritoi]] (local governors) of [[Athens]] during the Ottoman era were members of this family. After the [[Greek War of Independence]] the family has given several prominent members of the Athenian society (mayors of the city, scientists, lawyers, writers, poets, translators).

'''Intelsat IVA F-6''' was a [[geostationary]] [[communication]] [[satellite]] built by [[Hughes Aircraft Company|Hughes]], it was owned by [[Intelsat]]. The satellite was based on the [[Spacebus|HS-353]] platform and its estimated useful life was 7 years.

== History ==
The Intelsat IVA F-6 was part of the Intelsat IVA series which consisted of 6 satellites, of which five were successfully placed into orbit. All five satellites in the series were retired and operated an average of almost 4 years beyond their life expectancies. The satellite antenna allowed coverage from the land masses on both sides of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] basin with four point beams and had sufficient insulation between the east beams and the western beams that used the same frequencies in the east and west. The separation of the beam by directional [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] allowed this dual use of the frequency, significantly increasing the capacity of satellite communication within an assigned frequency range. Although the initial requirement Intelsat VAT series was only for the Atlantic service, but also was given special attention during the project to provide service on the [[Indian Ocean]] and [[Pacific Ocean]].

The satellite had 20 transponders (individual radio transmitters) compared to 12 on board each Intelsat IV satellite. It had a total height of 22 feet, 11 inches (7.01 meters) and a diameter of 7 feet, 9 inches (2.38 meters). The solar panels, covered with about 17,000 solar cells, provided primary energy of 600 Watts. The weight of the satellite, which had an orbiting life project of 7 years, was about £3335 (1,515&amp;nbsp;kg).

The satellite was successfully launched into space on March 31, 1978, by means of an [[Atlas-Centaur]] vehicle from the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]], [[United States]]. It had a launch mass of 1,515&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref&gt;Krebs, Gunter. [http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/intelsat-4a.htm Intelsat-4A]. ''Gunter's Space Page''. Retrieved 22 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2546">The '''International Advisory and Monitoring Board''' was appointed to oversee the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]]'s disbursements from the [[humanitarian]] [[Development Fund for Iraq]].  When the CPA was authorized to manage the DFI by [[United Nations]] [[United Nations resolution|resolution]] [[UN Security Council Resolution 1483|1483]].
the CPA was obliged to cooperate with the oversight of the IAMB.  The IAMB was composed of senior representatives from the United Nations, the [[Arab Fund for Social and Economic Development]], the [[International Monetary Fund]], and the [[World Bank]].

The IAMB had trouble getting co-operation from the [[Civilian Administrator of Iraq|Administrator of Iraq]], [[Paul Bremer]], and from the CPA.  In their final press release before the CPA's authority expired the IAMB wrote:

:''"The IAMB regrets, despite its repeated requests, the delay in receiving reports on audits undertaken by various agencies on sole-sourced contracts funded by the DFI. In the light of these delays the IAMB decided to commission a special audit to determine the extent of sole-sourced contracts. The IAMB was also informed by the CPA that '''contrary to earlier representations''' the award of metering contracts have been delayed and continues to urge the expeditious resolution of this critical issue. Finally, the IAMB noted the delay in completing the audits on the [[State Oil Marketing Organization]] (SOMO) and requested the CPA to press for prompt finalization of these."''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4567">'''The International Year for the Culture of Peace''' was designated by the [[United Nations]] as the year 2000, with the aim of celebrating and encouraging a culture of [[peace]].

== Origins ==

Since 1959 the [[United Nations]] has designated specific years to emphasize issues which are part of the mission of the organization. The International Year for the Culture of Peace was proclaimed in a [[United Nations General Assembly]] resolution in 1997 on the basis of an [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]] resolution.&lt;ref name="UN_ARES5215"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-RES-52-15 |type=Resolution |body=General Assembly |session=52 |accessdate=2007-08-10 |date=20 November 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The General Assembly invited a '''Declaration and Programme of Action''' from UNESCO and adopted it after ten months of difficult negotiation.&lt;ref name="UN_ARES53243"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-RES-53-243 |type=Resolution |body=General Assembly |session=53 |accessdate=2007-08-10 |date=13 September 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The IYCP Taskforce ==

The lead organization for the International Year was [[UNESCO]]. There was a logic to this, in that [[UNESCO]] is the [[United Nations]] organization dealing with education, and also in that the constitutional mandate of [[UNESCO]] involves the encouragement of a global culture of peace. Within the [[UNESCO]] Secretariat in Paris, a specific International Year for the Culture of Peace Taskforce was established from 1998 to 2000, with the aim of co-ordinating the activities to publicize the International Year.  Members of the Taskforce included: [[David Adams (peace activist)|David Adams]] (Chair)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.culture-of-peace.info/adams.html, accessed 24 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;, Enzo Fazzino, Katherine Stoessel,&lt;ref name="culture-of-peace.info"&gt;http://www.culture-of-peace.info/history/page32.html, accessed 24 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Di Bretherton&lt;ref name="culture-of-peace.info"/&gt;, Zeynep Varoglu&lt;ref name="culture-of-peace.info"/&gt; and Jan Visser.&lt;ref name="culture-of-peace.info"/&gt;

== International Year Strategies and Results ==

The strategies behind the International Year centred upon involving civil society as much as possible. The specific initiatives included the collection of some 75 million signatures worldwide in support of a culture of peace, with the Manifesto 2000 Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://decade-culture-of-peace.org/iycp/iycp-uk/uk_sum_monde.htm| title=World Information Board| publisher=Website for Culture of Peace Decade| accessdate=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another initiative was the [[Culture of Peace News Network]], otherwise known as the [[CPNN]],  a web-based news service  reporting news in support of a culture of peace.

An extensive description of the results obtained during the International Year was published by UNESCO.&lt;ref&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001223/122350e.pdf REPORT ON THE PROGRESS MADE BY UNESCO IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAMME OF ACTION ON A CULTURE OF PEACE&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assessment of the International Year ==

Opinion is divided as to how effective the International Year was.  It is possible to argue that there was much rhetoric in the International Year, and yet often the impact of such events can only be discerned many years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eprints.qut.edu.au/archive/00002945/| title=Page, James S. (2001) 'The International Year for the Culture of Peace: Was It Worthwhile?'. ''International Journal of Cultural Studies''. 4(3): 348-351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ongoing Commitment of the United Nations ==

The work of supporting and encouraging a culture of peace continues through the [[International Decade for the Promotion of a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World]], and the ongoing [[Culture of Peace News Network]].

'''Ivan Franko Park''' (Парк імені Івана Франка), formerly known as '''Kościuszko Park''' and the '''Jesuit Gardens''', is a park in [[Lviv]], [[Ukraine]]. It is the oldest park in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{tr}} [http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/park-icinde-kurulu-bir-sehir-lviv-29214703 Park içinde kurulu bir şehir: Lviv], ''Hurriyet.com'', 14 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://travelicious.world/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-lviv-ukraine/ 10 Things You Didn’t Know About Lviv, Ukraine], ''Travelicious.world'', 13 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the 16th century, the land of the park was the property of the [[Szolc-Wolfowicz family]] and [[Antonio Massari]], a [[Republic of Venice|Venitian consul]]. They passed the property to a Jesuit order. The park's former name Jesuit Gardens derived from that history. The monastic residents built a brewery and an inn with the elegance of Italian refinery. During a siege by Moscow's army in 1655, a rampart wall was built around the property. By the end of the 18th century, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]], following his policy of confiscating monastic holdings, ordered the establishment of a municipal park in Lviv. In 1799, restaurateur [[Johann Höcht]] leased the park and opened a French resort on the site. It was redesigned by horticulturist Karl Bauer as a landscaped park in 1855.&lt;ref name="lvivcenter 21"&gt;[http://www.lvivcenter.org/en/lia/objects/?ci_objectid=21 Ivan Franko Park (formerly, Jesuit Gardens)], ''Lvivcenter.org''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
The Ivan Franko Park ([[Lviv]], [[Ukraine]]) is located on a hillside of the Lviv Heights between Lystopadovoho Chynu and Krushelnytskoi Streets. It is near [[Lviv University]], which is also named after [[Ivan Franko]]. The park fills a parallelogram between Marshalkovska, Mitskevych, Mateyko and Krashevsky Streets (presently, Universitetska, Lystopadovoho Chynu, Mateyko, and Krushelnytskoi) (Miasto Lwów, 1896, 318)&lt;ref name="lvivcenter 21"/&gt; A large statue of Ivan Franko towers over the park&lt;ref&gt;Jozef Wittlin, Philippe Sands, [https://books.google.fr/books?id=VnYhDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA121&amp;dq=Ivan+Franko+Park&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjNh_HBybDWAhWJbiYKHUoeBa4Q6AEIcTAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=Ivan%20Franko%20Park&amp;f=false City of Lions], ''Books.google.fr'', 21 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Ecosystem==

Most of them are [[regionalism (politics)|regionalist]], some are [[autonomism (political doctrine)|autonomist]] or [[separatism|separatist]], others represent [[minority group|minority]] interests. To be included in the list, parties need to gain at least 3.0% at the country-level or 3.0% in regional entities with at least 500,000 inhabitants or 6.0% in those with at least 100,000 inhabitants.

In this way, France appears as 'presidentialist system' endowed with a 'semi-presidential regime' (1983: 587).

Since its independence, Lithuania has been referred to as one of the [[Baltic states]]. It is situated along the southeastern shore of the [[Baltic Sea]], to the east of [[Sweden]] and [[Denmark]]. It is bordered by [[Latvia]] to the north, [[Belarus]] to the east and south, [[Poland]] to the south, and [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] (a [[Russia]]n [[Enclave and exclave|exclave]]) to the southwest. Lithuania has an estimated population of 2.8 million people {{As of|2017|lc=y}}, and its capital and largest city is [[Vilnius]]. Other major cities are [[Kaunas]] and [[Klaipėda]]. [[Lithuanians]] are [[Baltic people]]. The official language, [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], along with [[Latvian language|Latvian]], is one of only two living languages in the [[Baltic languages|Baltic branch]] of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language family.

For centuries, the southeastern shores of the Baltic Sea were inhabited by various [[Balts|Baltic tribes]]. In the 1230s, the Lithuanian lands were united by [[Mindaugas]], the King of Lithuania, and the first unified Lithuanian state, the [[Kingdom of Lithuania]], was created on 6 July 1253. During the 14th century, the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] was the largest country in Europe; present-day Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine, and parts of Poland and Russia were the territories of the Grand Duchy. With the [[Lublin Union]] of 1569, Lithuania and Poland formed a voluntary two-state [[personal union]], the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. The Commonwealth lasted more than two centuries, until neighbouring countries [[Partitions of Poland|systematically dismantled]] it from 1772 to 1795, with the [[Russian Empire]] annexing most of Lithuania's territory.

As [[World War I]] neared its end, Lithuania's [[Act of Independence of Lithuania|Act of Independence]] was signed on 16 February 1918, declaring the founding of the modern Republic of Lithuania. In the midst of the [[Second World War]], Lithuania was first [[Soviet occupation of the Baltic states (1940)|occupied by the Soviet Union]] and then by [[Occupation of Lithuania by Nazi Germany|Nazi Germany]]. As World War II neared its end and the Germans retreated, the [[Soviet occupation of the Baltic states (1944)|Soviet Union reoccupied Lithuania]]. On 11 March 1990, a year before the formal [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Lithuania became the first Baltic state&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lithuania breaks away from the Soviet Union|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/1990/mar/12/eu.politics|website=Theguardian.com|quote=Lithuania last night became the first republic to break away from the Soviet Union, by proclaiming the restoration of its pre-war independence. The newly-elected parliament, 'reflecting the people's will,' decreed the restoration of 'the sovereign rights of the Lithuanian state, infringed by alien forces in 1940,' and declared that from that moment Lithuania was again an independent state.|publisher=Guardian Media Group |location=London |date=12 March 1990 |accessdate=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to declare itself independent, resulting in [[Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania|the restoration of an independent State of Lithuania]].

Lithuania is a member of the [[European Union]], the [[Council of Europe]], [[eurozone]], [[Schengen Agreement]], [[NATO]] and [[OECD]]. It is also a member of the [[Nordic Investment Bank]], and part of [[NB8|Nordic-Baltic]] cooperation of [[Northern Europe]]an countries. The United Nations [[Human Development Index]] lists Lithuania as a "very high human development" country.

==Etymology==
{{Main|Name of Lithuania}}
[[File:Lietuvos vardas. The first name of Lithuania in writing 1009.jpg|thumb|left|Lithuania's name in writing 1009]]
The first known record of the name of Lithuania ({{lang-lt|Lietuva}}) is in a 9 March 1009 story of [[Bruno of Querfurt|Saint Bruno]] in the [[Quedlinburg Chronicle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=On the Origin of the Name of Lithuania | journal=Lithuanian Quarterly Journal of Arts and Sciences | volume=55 | issue=3 | date=Fall 2009 | first=Tomas | last=Baranauskas | issn=0024-5089}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chronicle recorded a Latinized form of the name Lietuva: ''Litua''&lt;ref&gt;Vilnius. [http://www.vilnius-tourism.lt/index.php/en/39453/ Key dates]. Retrieved on 18 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; (pronounced {{IPA|[litua]}}). Due to the lack of reliable evidence, the true meaning of the name is unknown. Nowadays, scholars still debate the meaning of the word and there are a few plausible versions.

Since the word ''Lietuva'' has a suffix (-''uva''), the original word should have no suffix. A likely candidate is ''Lietā''. Because many [[Baltic language|Baltic]] [[ethnonym]]s originated from [[hydronym]]s, linguists have searched for its origin among local hydronyms. Usually such names evolved through the following process: hydronym → toponym → [[ethnonym]].&lt;ref name=Zigmas2&gt;Zigmas Zinkevičius. Kelios mintys, kurios kyla skaitant Alfredo Bumblausko Senosios Lietuvos istoriją 1009-1795m. Voruta, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lietava River|Lietava]], a small river not far from [[Kernavė]], the core area of the [[Duchy of Lithuania|early Lithuanian state]] and a possible first capital of the eventual [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], is usually credited as the source of the name.&lt;ref name=Zigmas2/&gt; However, the river is very small and some find it improbable that such a small and local object could have lent its name to an entire nation. On the other hand, such a naming is not unprecedented in world history.&lt;ref name=Zigmas&gt;{{cite journal |first=Zigmas |last=Zinkevičius |url=http://www.voruta.lt/archyvas/74/253 |title=Lietuvos vardo kilmė |journal=Voruta |issn=1392-0677 |date=30 November 1999 |volume=3 |issue=669 |language=lt }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prehistory===
{{Main|Duchy of Lithuania}}
[[File:Seges is senkapio.jpg|thumb||upright=.70|right|Lithuanian brooches from 9th–12th centuries]]
The first people settled in the territory of Lithuania after the [[last glacial period]] in the 10th millennium BC: [[Kunda culture|Kunda]], [[Neman culture|Neman]] and [[Narva culture]]s. They were traveling hunters and did not form stable settlements. In the 8th millennium BC, the climate became much warmer, and forests developed. The inhabitants of what is now Lithuania then traveled less and engaged in local hunting, gathering and fresh-water fishing. Agriculture did not emerge until the 3rd millennium BC due to a harsh climate and terrain and a lack of suitable tools to cultivate the land. Crafts and trade also started to form at this time. Over a millennium, the [[Indo-European migrations|Indo-Europeans]], who arrived in the 3rd – 2nd millennium BC, mixed with the local population and formed various [[Baltic tribes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Šapoka|first1=Adolfas|title=Lietuvos istorija|date=1936|publisher=[[Šviesa]]|location=Kaunas|pages=13–17|url=http://www.partizanai.org/failai/pdf/sapokos-istorija.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Baltic-amber-colours.JPG|thumb|left|[[Baltic Amber]], that dates 44 million years ago, is a valuable trade resource. It was once transported to the [[Roman Empire]], [[Egypt]] through the [[Amber Road]].]]

The [[Baltic tribes]] did not maintain close cultural or political contacts with the [[Roman Empire]], but they did maintain trade contacts (see [[Amber Road]]). [[Tacitus]], in his study ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'', described the [[Aesti]] people, inhabitants of the south-eastern [[Baltic Sea]] shores who were probably Balts, around the year 97 AD. The Western Balts differentiated and became known to outside chroniclers first. [[Ptolemy]] in the 2nd century AD knew of the [[Galindians]] and [[Yotvingians]], and [[Early Middle Ages|early medieval]] chroniclers mentioned [[Old Prussians]], [[Curonians]] and [[Semigallians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first1=Alfonsas |last1=Eidintas |first2=Alfredas |last2=Bumblauskas |first3=Antanas |last3=Kulakauskas |first4=Mindaugas |last4=Tamošaitis |title=The History of Lithuania |year=2013 |url=http://static.eu2013.lt/uploads/documents/Liet_istorija_knygos/EN_lt.pdf |publisher=Eugrimas |isbn=978-609-437-204-9 |pages=22–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lithuanian language]] is considered to be very [[Conservative (language)|conservative]] for its close connection to Indo-European roots. It is believed to have differentiated from the [[Latvian language]], the most closely related existing language, around the 7th century.&lt;ref name="Bumblauskas 13"&gt;Eidintas et al.

From the 9th to the 11th centuries, coastal Balts were subjected to raids by the [[Vikings]], and the kings of [[Denmark]] collected tribute at times.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} During the 10–11th centuries, Lithuanian territories were among the lands paying tribute to [[Kievan Rus']], and [[Yaroslav the Wise]] was among the [[Ruthenia]]n rulers who invaded Lithuania (from 1040). From the mid-12th century, it was the Lithuanians who were invading Ruthenian territories. In 1183, [[Polotsk]] and [[Pskov]] were ravaged, and even the distant and powerful [[Novgorod Republic]] was repeatedly threatened by the excursions from the emerging Lithuanian war machine toward the end of the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Jerzy |last=Ochmański |title=Historia Litwy [The History of Lithuania]|year=1982 |edition=2nd |isbn=9788304008861 |publisher=Zakład Narodowy im.

From the late 12th century, an organized Lithuanian military force existed; it was used for external raids, plundering and the gathering of slaves. Such military and pecuniary activities fostered social differentiation and triggered a struggle for power in Lithuania. This initiated the formation of early statehood, from which the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baczkowski|first1=Krzysztof|title=''Dzieje Polski późnośredniowiecznej (1370–1506)'' [History of Late Medieval Poland (1370–1506)]|date=1999|publisher=Fogra|location=Kraków|isbn=83-85719-40-7|pages=55–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially inhabited by fragmented Baltic tribes, in the 1230s the Lithuanian lands were united by [[Mindaugas]], who was crowned as [[King of Lithuania]] on 6 July 1253.&lt;ref name="voruta2001"&gt;{{lt icon}} Tomas Baranauskas (2001).

[[Siege of Pilėnai]] is noted for the Lithuanians' heroic defense against the intruders. Despite the devastating century-long struggle with the Orders, the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] expanded rapidly, overtaking former Slavic principalities of [[Kievan Rus']].

On 22 September 1236, the [[Battle of Saulė]] between [[Samogitians]] and the [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword]] took place close to [[Šiauliai]]. The Livonian Brothers were smashed during it and their further conquest of the [[Balts]] lands were stopped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zikaras|first1=Karolis|title=Battle of Saulė 1236|date=2014|publisher=[[Ministry of National Defence (Lithuania)|Military Cartography Centre of Lithuanian Armed Forces]]|location=Domeikava, Kaunas District|isbn=978-609-412-017-6|url=https://kam.lt/download/30977/saules%20musis%20angliskai%201.pdf|accessdate=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The battle inspired rebellions among the [[Curonians]], [[Semigallians]], [[Selonians]], [[Oeselians]], tribes previously conquered by the Sword-Brothers.

According to the legend, Grand Duke [[Gediminas]] was once hunting near the [[Vilnia River]]; tired after the successful hunt, he settled in for the night and dreamed of a huge [[Iron Wolf (character)|Iron Wolf]] standing on top a hill and howling as strong and loud as a hundred wolves. ''Krivis'' (pagan priest) Lizdeika interpreted the dream that the Iron Wolf represents [[Vilnius Castles]]. Gediminas, obeying the will of gods, built the city, and gave it the name [[Vilnius]] – from the stream of the Vilnia River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Legend of the Founding of Vilnius – Gediminas Dream|url=https://ironwolf.lt/the-legend-of-the-founding-of-vilnius/|website=ironwolf.lt|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1362 or 1363, Grand Duke [[Algirdas]] achieved a decisive victory in the [[Battle of Blue Waters]] against [[Golden Horde]] and stopped its further expansion in the present-day [[Ukraine]]. The victory brought the city of [[Kiev]] and a large part of present-day Ukraine, including sparsely populated [[Podolia]] and [[Dykra]], under the control of the expanding Grand Duchy of Lithuania.&lt;ref name=baran&gt;{{cite journal| first=Tomas |last=Baranauskas |authorlink=Tomas Baranauskas |title=Mėlynųjų Vandenų mūšis: atminties sugrįžimas po 650 metų |url=http://www.veidas.lt/melynuju-vandenu-musis-atminties-sugrizimas-po-650-metu |journal=[[Veidas]] |issn=1392-5156 |issue=25 |pages=30–32 |date=23 June 2012|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt; After taking Kiev, Lithuania became a direct neighbor and rival of the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xxREnBcMFcEC&amp;pg=PA88 |title=A Companion to Russian Studies: An Introduction to Russian History |first=Robert |last=Auty |first2=Dimitri |last2=Obolensky | publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1981 |page=86 | isbn=0-521-28038-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 14th century, Lithuania was one of the largest countries in Europe and included present-day [[Belarus]], [[Ukraine]], and parts of [[Poland]] and [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Magocsi (1996). ''History of the Ukraine''. University of Toronto Press. p. 128. {{ISBN|0802078206}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The geopolitical situation between the west and the east determined the multicultural and multi-confessional character of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The ruling elite practised religious tolerance and [[Chancery Slavonic]] language was used as an auxiliary language to the [[Latin]] for official documents.

In 1385, the Grand Duke [[Jogaila]] accepted Poland's offer to become its king. [[Jogaila]] embarked on gradual [[Christianization of Lithuania]] and established a [[personal union]] between Poland and Lithuania. Lithuania was one of the last [[Romuva (religion)|pagan]] areas of Europe to adopt Christianity.
[[File:Jan Matejko, Bitwa pod Grunwaldem.jpg|thumb|left|[[Battle of Grunwald]] and [[Vytautas the Great]] in the centre]]

After two civil wars, [[Vytautas the Great]] became the Grand Duke of Lithuania in 1392. During his reign, Lithuania reached the peak of its territorial expansion, centralization of the state began, and the [[Lithuanian nobility]] became increasingly prominent in state politics. In the great [[Battle of the Vorskla River]] in 1399, the combined forces of [[Tokhtamysh]] and Vytautas were defeated by the [[Golden Horde|Mongols]]. Thanks to close cooperation, the armies of Lithuania and Poland achieved a great victory over the Teutonic Knights in 1410 at the [[Battle of Grunwald]], one of the largest battles of medieval Europe.&lt;ref name="Lane"&gt;{{cite book | author = Thomas Lane| title = Lithuania: Stepping Westward | publisher = Routledge | year = 2001 | pages = ix, xxi | url = https://books.google.com/?id=fecMC0LXU-sC&amp;printsec=frontcover | isbn = 0-415-26731-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The New Encyclopædia Britannica'' v. 17 (1998) p. 545&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rick Fawn|title=Ideology and national identity in post-communist foreign policies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SBtYrTANgvUC&amp;pg=PA186|year=2003|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-7146-5517-8|pages=186–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1429, at the [[Congress of Lutsk]] Vytautas received the title of [[King of Lithuania]] with the backing of [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor]], but the envoys who were transporting the crown were stopped by Polish [[magnate]]s in autumn of 1430. Another crown was sent, but Vytautas died in the [[Trakai Island Castle]] several days before it reached Lithuania. He was buried in the [[Cathedral of Vilnius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lucko suvažiavimas|url=http://www.partizanai.org/karys-1955m-8/4611-lucko-suvaziavimas|website=Partizanai.org|accessdate=22 December 2017|language=lt-lt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the deaths of Jogaila and Vytautas, the Lithuanian nobility attempted to break the union between [[Poland]] and Lithuania, independently selecting Grand Dukes from the [[Jagiellon dynasty]]. But, at the end of the 15th century, Lithuania was forced to seek a closer alliance with Poland when the growing power of the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] threatened Lithuania's Russian principalities and sparked the [[Muscovite–Lithuanian Wars]] and the [[Livonian War]].

On 8 September 1514, [[Battle of Orsha]] between Lithuanians, commanded by the [[Hetmans of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Grand Hetman]] [[Konstanty Ostrogski]], and Muscovites was fought. According to ''[[Rerum Moscoviticarum Commentarii]]'' by [[Sigismund von Herberstein]], the primary source for information on the battle, the much smaller army of Poland–Lithuania (under 30,000 men) defeated a force of 80,000 Muscovite soldiers, capturing their camp and commander.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Prieš 500 metų – Oršos mūšis|date=November 2014|publisher=[[Union of Lithuanian Freedom Fighters]]|url=http://www.llks.lt/Varpas/Varpo%20archyvas/Varpas%202014/2014%20lapkritis.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The battle destroyed a military alliance against Lithuania and Poland.

The Livonian War was ceased for ten years with a [[Truce of Yam-Zapolsky]] signed on 15 January 1582 according to which the already [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] recovered [[Livonia]], [[Polotsk]] and [[Velizh]], but transferred [[Velikiye Luki]] to the [[Tsardom of Russia]]. The [[truce]] was extended for twenty years in 1600, when a [[diplomatic mission]] to Moscow led by [[Lew Sapieha]] concluded negotiations with Tsar [[Boris Godunov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baliulis|first1=Algirdas|title=Lietuvos Didžiosios Kunigaikštystės ir Maskvos valstybės diplomatiniai santykiai XVI a. pabaigoje|publisher=Lietuvos istorijos institutas|location=Vilnius|url=http://mokslozurnalai.lmaleidykla.lt/publ/0235-716X/2002/3/L-03.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The truce was broken when [[Polish–Muscovite War (1605–18)|the Poles invaded Muscovy in 1605]].

===Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth===
{{Main|Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth}}
[[File:Vilenskija zamki. Віленскія замкі (T. Makoŭski, 1600).jpg|thumb|left|[[Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania]], marked 6, in 1600]]
The [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] was created in 1569. As a member of the Commonwealth, Lithuania retained its institutions, including a separate army, currency, and statutory laws.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Daniel. ''The Polish–Lithuanian State: 1386–1795''. University of Washington Press, 2001. p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually [[Polonization]] affected all aspects of Lithuanian life: politics, language, culture, and national identity. From the mid-16th to the mid-17th centuries, culture, arts, and education flourished, fueled by the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Protestant Reformation]]. From 1573, the Kings of Poland and Grand Dukes of Lithuania were [[free election (Polish throne)|elected by the nobility]], who were granted ever increasing [[Golden Liberty|Golden Liberties]]. These liberties, especially the ''[[liberum veto]]'', led to anarchy and the eventual dissolution of the state.

[[File:Kirholm 1605 I.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Battle of Kircholm]], 1605]]

The Commonwealth reached its [[Polish Golden Age|Golden Age]] in the early 17th century. Its powerful [[Sejm|parliament]] was dominated by nobles who were reluctant to get involved in the [[Thirty Years' War]]; this neutrality spared the country from the ravages of a political-religious conflict that devastated most of contemporary Europe. The Commonwealth held its own against [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]], the [[Tsardom of Russia]], and vassals of the [[Ottoman Empire]], and even launched successful [[expansionism|expansionist]] offensives against its neighbors. In [[Polish–Muscovite War (1605–18)|several invasions]] during the [[Time of Troubles]], Commonwealth troops entered Russia and managed to take [[Moscow]] and hold it from 27 September 1610 to 4 November 1612, when they were driven out [[Polish–Muscovite War (1605–18)#The_war resumes (1611)|after a siege]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lietuvos aukso amžius – vienas sprendimas galėjo pakeisti visą istoriją|url=https://www.delfi.lt/multimedija/musu-lietuva/lietuvos-aukso-amzius-vienas-sprendimas-galejo-pakeisti-visa-istorija.d?id=74961334|website=DELFI|accessdate=24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Emila Plater conducting Polish scythemen in 1831.jpg|thumb|right|[[Emilia Plater]], often nicknamed as a Lithuanian [[Joan of Arc]], leading peasant [[Kosynierzy|scythemen]] during the 1831 uprising]]

In 1655, after the extinguishing [[Battle of Vilnius (1655)|battle]], for the first time in history Lithuanian capital Vilnius was taken by the foreign army. Russian army looted the city, splendid churches, manors. 8000-10000 citizens were killed; the city burned 17 days. Those who returned after the catastrophe didn't recognise the city. Russian occupation of Grand Duchy of Lithuania lasted up to 1661. Many artefacts and cultural heritage were either lost or looted, significant parts of the state archive – [[Lithuanian Metrica]], collected since 13th century, were lost and the rest is moved out of the country. During the [[Second Northern War|Northern Wars]] (1655–1661), the Lithuanian territory and economy were devastated by the [[Swedish Empire|Swedish]] army. Almost all territory of Grand Duchy of Lithuania was occupied by Swedish and Russian armies. This period is known as ''Tvanas'' ([[Deluge (history)|The Deluge]]).

Before it could fully recover, Lithuania was ravaged during the [[Great Northern War]] (1700–1721). The war, [[Great Northern War plague outbreak|a plague]], and [[Great Frost of 1709|a famine]] caused the deaths of approximately 40% of the country's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |volume= 16 |issue=2 |year= 2008 |url=http://www.liw.lt/archive_vid.php?shid=1211283347&amp;id=1211283055 |title=The Roads to Independence |journal=Lithuania in the World |issn=1392-0901 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512014106/http://www.liw.lt/archive_vid.php?shid=1211283347&amp;id=1211283055 |archivedate=12 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign powers, especially Russia, became dominant in the domestic politics of the Commonwealth. Numerous fractions among the nobility used the Golden Liberties to prevent any reforms.

The [[Constitution of 3 May 1791]] was adopted by the [[Great Sejm]] (parliament) of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth trying to save the state. The legislation was designed to redress the Commonwealth's political defects due to the system of Golden Liberties, also known as the "Nobles' Democracy," had conferred disproportionate rights on the nobility (szlachta) and over time had corrupted politics. The constitution sought to supplant the prevailing anarchy fostered by some of the country's [[Magnates of Poland and Lithuania|magnates]] with a more democratic [[constitutional monarchy]]. It introduced elements of political equality between townspeople and nobility, and placed the peasants under the protection of the government, thus mitigating the worst abuses of [[serfdom]]. It banned parliamentary institutions such as the ''liberum veto'', which had put the Sejm at the mercy of any deputy who could revoke all the legislation that had been passed by that Sejm. It was drafted in relation to a copy of the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Constitution of May 3, 1791|url=http://www3.lrs.lt/pdf/konstitucija_angliska_1.pdf|website=LRS.lt|accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1791 m. gegužės 3 d.

The 1787 U.S. Constitution was actually the first governmental constitution, introducing the clear division of the executive, legislative and judiciary powers, accordingly with [[John Locke|the legal and philosophical values]] influential in the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;The claims of "first" and "second constitution" have been disputed, particularly as different scholars define the word constitution differently. Both the U.S. and Polish-Lithuanian constitutions were preceded by earlier ones, mainly non-governmental constitutions or statutory acts, which did not introduce the clear division of the executive, legislative and judiciary powers (considered during the Enlightenment by thinkers such as [[Montesquieu]]), including some also termed constitutions. According to Koenigsberger, the [[Corsican Constitution]] of 1755 did not separate the executive from the judiciary power. See [[history of the constitution]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russian Empire===
Eventually, [[Partitions of Poland|the Commonwealth was partitioned]] in 1772, 1792, and 1795 by the [[Russian Empire]], [[Prussia]], and [[Habsburg Austria]].

The largest area of Lithuanian territory became part of the Russian Empire. After unsuccessful [[November Uprising|uprisings in 1831]] and [[January Uprising|1863]], the Tsarist authorities implemented a number of [[Russification]] policies. In 1840 the [[Statutes of Lithuania#Third Statute|Third Statute of Lithuania]] was abolished. They [[Lithuanian press ban|banned the Lithuanian press]], closed cultural and educational institutions, and made Lithuania part of a new administrative region called [[Northwestern Krai]]. The Russification failed owing to an extensive network of [[book smuggler]]s and secret Lithuanian home schooling.

[[File:Valancius.jpg|thumb|left|Bishop [[Motiejus Valančius]] (1801–1875) urged to resist Russification, to protest against closing of catholic churches and monasteries, organised book printing in Lithuanian in [[Lithuania Minor]] and distribution channels in occupied Lithuania]]

After the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)]], when German diplomats assigned what were seen as Russian spoils of war to Turkey, the relationship between Russia and the [[German Empire]] became complicated. The Russian Empire resumed the construction of fortresses at its western borders for defence against a potential invasion from Germany in the West. On 7 July 1879 the [[Alexander II of Russia|Russian Emperor Alexander II]] approved of a proposal from the Russian military leadership to build the largest "first-class" defensive structure in the entire state – the {{convert|65|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} [[Kaunas Fortress]].&lt;ref name="Kauno tvirtovė"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Kauno tvirtovės istorija |publisher=Gintaras Česonis |url=http://tvirtove.kaunas.lt/ |year=2004 |accessdate=12 June 2008 |language=lt |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510074436/http://tvirtove.kaunas.lt/ |archivedate=10 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Large numbers of Lithuanians went to the United States in 1867–1868 after a [[famine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Lithuanians in the United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Simonas Daukantas]] promoted a return to Lithuania's pre-[[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Commonwealth]] traditions, which he depicted as a Golden Age of Lithuania and a renewal of the native culture, based on the [[Lithuanian language]] and customs. With those ideas in mind, he wrote already in 1822 a history of Lithuania in Lithuanian – ''Darbai senųjų lietuvių ir žemaičių'' (''The Deeds of Ancient Lithuanians and Samogitians''), though still not yet published at that time. A colleague of S.Daukantas, [[Teodor Narbutt]] wrote in Polish a voluminous ''Ancient History of the Lithuanian Nation'' (1835–1841), where he likewise expounded and expanded further on the concept of historic Lithuania, whose days of glory had ended with the Union of Lublin in 1569. Narbutt, invoking the German scholarship, pointed out the relationship between the Lithuanian and [[Sanskrit]] languages. A [[Lithuanian National Revival]], inspired by the ancient Lithuanian history, language and culture, laid the foundations of the modern Lithuanian nation and independent Lithuania.

On 18–22 September 1917, the [[Vilnius Conference]] elected the 20-member [[Council of Lithuania]]. The council adopted the [[Act of Independence of Lithuania]] on 16 February 1918 which proclaimed the restoration of the independent state of Lithuania governed by democratic principles, with [[Vilnius]] as its capital. The state of Lithuania which had been built within the framework of the Act lasted from 1918 until 1940.

Following the capitulation of Germany in November 1918, the first Provisional [[Constitution of Lithuania]] was adopted and the first government of Prime Minister [[Augustinas Voldemaras]] was organized. At the same time, the army and other state institutions began to be organized. Lithuania fought [[Lithuanian Wars of Independence|three wars of independence]]: [[Lithuanian–Soviet War|against the Bolsheviks]] who proclaimed the [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic (1918–1919)|Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic]], against the [[West Russian Volunteer Army|Bermontians]], and [[Polish–Lithuanian War|against Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pirmosios Lietuvos nepriklausomybės kovos|url=http://www.partizanai.org/index.php/karys-4-5-1951m/4055-pirmosios-lietuvos-nepriklausomybes-kovos|website=Partizanai.org|accessdate=23 December 2017|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lesčius|first1=Vytautas|title=Lietuvos kariuomenė nepriklausomybės kovose 1918–1920.

In January 1923, Lithuania staged the [[Klaipėda Revolt]] and captured [[Klaipėda Region]] (Memel territory) which was detached from [[East Prussia]] by the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. The region became an autonomous region of Lithuania.

On 15 May 1920, the first meeting of the democratically elected [[constituent assembly]] took place. The documents it adopted, i. e. the temporary (1920) and permanent (1922) constitutions of Lithuania, strove to regulate the life of the new state. Land, finance, and educational reforms started to be implemented. The currency of Lithuania, the [[Lithuanian litas]], was introduced. The [[Vytautas Magnus University|University of Lithuania]] was opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VMU Now and Before|url=http://www.vdu.lt/en/about-vmu/vmu-now-and-before/|website=[[Vytautas Magnus University]]|accessdate=23 December 2017|date=10 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171224101656/http://www.vdu.lt/en/about-vmu/vmu-now-and-before/|archive-date=24 December 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; All major public institutions had been established. As Lithuania began to gain stability, foreign countries started to recognize it. In 1921 Lithuania was admitted to the [[League of Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kantautas|first1=Adam|last2=Kantautas|first2=Filomena|title=A Lithuanian Bibliography: A Check-list of Books and Articles Held by the Major Libraries of Canada and the United States|date=1975|publisher=University of Alberta|isbn=9780888640109|pages=295–296|url=https://books.google.lt/books?id=qUfXrFMJv78C&amp;pg=PA295&amp;lpg=PA295|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 December 1926, a military [[1926 Lithuanian coup d'état|coup d'état]] took place resulting in the replacement of the democratically elected government with a conservative authoritarian government led by Antanas Smetona. [[Augustinas Voldemaras]] was appointed to form a government. The so-called authoritarian phase had begun strengthening the influence of one party, the [[Lithuanian Nationalist Union]], in the country. In 1927, the Seimas was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lrs.lt/sip/portal.show?p_r=16275&amp;p_k=1|website=LRS.lt|title=III Seimas (1926–1927 m.)|accessdate=23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new constitution adopted in 1928, which consolidated presidential powers.

[[File:Lituanica Above New York.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Lituanica]]'' above [[New York City|New York]] in 1933. The transatlantic flight was one of the most precise in aviation history. It equaled, and in some aspects surpassed, [[Charles Lindbergh]]'s classic flight.]]

On 15 July 1933, [[Steponas Darius]] and [[Stasys Girėnas]], Lithuanian pilots, emigrants to the United States, made a significant flight in the [[Aviation history|history of world aviation]]. They flew across the Atlantic Ocean, covering a distance of 3,984 miles (6,411 kilometers) without landing, in 37 hours and 11 minutes (107.1&amp;nbsp;mph). In terms of comparison, as far as the distance of non-stop flights was concerned, their result ranked second only to that of [[Russell Boardman]] and [[John Polando]].

The temporary capital Kaunas, which was nicknamed the ''Little Paris'', and the country itself had a [[Western world|Western]] standard of living with sufficiently high salaries and low prices. At the time, qualified workers there were earning very similar [[real wages]] as workers in [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Switzerland]] and [[France]], the country also had a surprisingly high [[Rate of natural increase|natural increase in population]] of 9.7 and the [[industrial production]] of Lithuania increased by 160% from 1913 to 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kodėl Kaunas buvo vadinamas mažuoju Paryžiumi?|url=https://kultura.lrytas.lt/istorija/kodel-kaunas-buvo-vadinamas-mazuoju-paryziumi.htm|website=lrytas.lt|accessdate=3 January 2013|language=lt-LT}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lapinskas|first1=Anatolijus|title=Lietuva tarpukariu nebuvo atsilikėlė|url=https://www.delfi.lt/news/daily/lithuania/lietuva-tarpukariu-nebuvo-atsilikele.d?id=61355765|website=[[DELFI]]|accessdate=29 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation was aggravated by the global economic crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thebalance.com/the-great-depression-of-1929-3306033|title=What Happened During the Great Depression?|website=Thebalance.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purchase price of agricultural products had declined significantly. In 1935, farmers began strikes in [[Suvalkija]] and [[Dzūkija]]. In addition to economic ones, political demands were made. The government cruelly suppressed the unrest. In the spring of 1936, four peasants were sentenced to death for starting the riots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globallabour.info/en/2009/03/trade_unions_in_lithuania_a_br.html|title=Trade Unions in Lithuania – A Brief History – Sergejus Glovackas (2009) (Global Labour Institute – English)|website=Globallabour.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the retreat of the [[Wehrmacht|German armed forces]], the [[Occupation and annexation of the Baltic states by the Soviet Union (1944)|Soviets reestablished their control of Lithuania]] in July–October 1944. The [[Deportation|massive deportations]] to [[Siberia]] were resumed and lasted until the death of [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] in 1953. All Lithuanian national symbols were banned. Under the pretext of Lithuania's economic recovery, the [[Moscow]] authorities encouraged the migration of workers and other specialists to Lithuania with the intention to further integrate Lithuania into the [[Soviet Union]] and to develop the country's industry. At the same time, Lithuanians were lured to work in the USSR by promising them all the privileges of settling in a new place.

The second Soviet occupation was accompanied by the [[Lithuanian partisans|guerrilla warfare]] of the Lithuanian population, which took place in 1944–1953. It sought to restore an independent state of Lithuania, to consolidate democracy by destroying communism in the country, returning national values and the freedom of religion. Classified as bandits by the Soviets, Lithuanians took to the forests and fought them with a gun in their hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5379.htm |title=US Department of State Bureau of Public Affairs|website=State.gov |date=August 2006 |accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.partizanai.org/failai/html/fighters-for-freedom.htm|title=Fighters for Freedom.

On 11 March 1990, the [[Supreme Council – Reconstituent Seimas|Supreme Council]] announced the restoration of Lithuania's independence. Lithuania became the first Soviet occupied state to announce restitution of independence. On 20 April 1990, the USSR imposed an [[Blockade|economic blockade]] by stopping to deliver supplies of raw materials (primarily oil) to Lithuania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Martha Brill Olcott |title=The Lithuanian Crisis |url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russian-federation/1990-06-01/lithuanian-crisis |website=www.foreignaffairs.com |accessdate=18 November 2018 |language=en-US |date=1990 |quote=For over two years Lithuania has been moving toward reclaiming its independence. This drive reached a crescendo on March 11, 1990, when the Supreme Soviet of Lithuania declared the republic no longer bound by Soviet law. The act reasserted the independence Lithuania had declared more than seventy years before, a declaration unilaterally annulled by the U.S.S.R. in 1940 when it annexed Lithuania as the result of a pact between Stalin and Hitler.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only the domestic industry, but also the population started feeling the lack of fuel, essential goods, and even hot water. Although the blockade lasted for 74 days, Lithuania did not renounce the declaration of independence.
[[File:January 13 events in Vilnius Lithuania.jpg|thumb|right|On [[January Events (Lithuania)|13 January 1991]], Soviets began shooting and crushing with tanks unarmed independence supporters. To this day, [[Russia]] refuses to extradite [[Crimes against humanity|criminals against humanity]] that are responsible for the bloody events.]]
Gradually, the economic relations had been restored. However, the tension had peaked again in January 1991. At that time, attempts were made to carry out a coup using the [[Soviet Armed Forces]], the Internal Army of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the USSR Committee for State Security ([[KGB]]). Because of the bad economic situation in Lithuania, the forces in Moscow thought the [[coup d'état]] would receive a strong public support. But the situation was the opposite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=10 svarbiausių 1991–ųjų sausio įvykių, kuriuos privalote žinoti|url=https://www.15min.lt/naujiena/aktualu/lietuva/10-svarbiausiu-1991-uju-sausio-ivykiu-kuriuos-privalote-zinoti-56-565845|website=15min.lt|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People from all over Lithuania flooded to [[Vilnius]] to defend their legitimately elected [[Supreme Council – Reconstituent Seimas|Supreme Council of the Republic of Lithuania]] and independence. The coup ended with a few casualties of peaceful civilians and caused huge material loss. Not a single person who defended [[Seimas|Lithuanian Parliament]] or other state institutions used a weapon, but the [[Soviet Army]] did. Soviet soldiers killed 14 people and injured hundreds. A large part of the Lithuanian population participated in the [[January Events (Lithuania)|January Events]].&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news|title=On This Day 13 January 1991: Bloodshed at Lithuanian TV station|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/13/newsid_4059000/4059959.stm|accessdate=13 September 2011|date=13 January 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Soviet crackdown; Soviet loyalists in charge after attack in Lithuania; 13 dead; curfew is imposed| author=Bill Keller|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]| date=14 January 1991| accessdate=18 December 2009| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/14/world/soviet-crackdown-soviet-loyalists-charge-after-attack-lithuania-13-dead-curfew.html?pagewanted=all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, on 11 February 1991, the [[Alþingi|Icelandic parliament]] voted to confirm that [[Iceland]]'s 1922 recognition of Lithuanian independence was still in full effect, as it never formally recognized the Soviet Union's control over Lithuania,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Svo fljótt sem verða má |url=http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?pageId=2927190 |accessdate=28 October 2018 |work=[[Þjóðviljinn]] |date=12 February 1991 |language=Icelandic}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that full diplomatic relations should be established as soon as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Stjórnmálasamband verði tekið upp svo fljótt sem verða má |url=http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?pageId=1738122 |accessdate=28 October 2018 |work=[[Morgunblaðið]] |date=12 February 1991 |language=Icelandic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Viðurkenning á sjálfstæði í fullu gildi |url=http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?pageId=2581110 |accessdate=28 October 2018 |work=[[Dagblaðið Vísir]] |date=12 February 1991 |language=Icelandic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Lithuania}}
[[File:Lithuania Centre of Europe.jpg|thumb|left|The Geographic Centre of Europe is in Lithuania]]
[[File:LithuaniaPhysicalMap-en.png|thumb|right|350px|Physical map and geomorphological subdivision of the Lithuania.]]
Lithuania is located in [[Northern Europe|northern]]-[[eastern Europe]]{{ref|NoteA|Note}} and covers an area of {{convert|65200|km2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abhinav.com/lithuania-immigration/lithuania-climate.aspx|title=Lithuania Geography|website=Abhinav.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; It lies between latitudes [[53rd parallel north|53°]] and [[57th parallel north|57° N]], and mostly between longitudes [[21st meridian east|21°]] and [[27th meridian east|27° E]] (part of the [[Curonian Spit]] lies west of 21°). It has around {{convert|99|km|mi|1}} of sandy coastline, only about {{convert|38|km|mi|0}} of which face the open [[Baltic Sea]], less than the other two [[Baltic Sea countries]]. The rest of the coast is sheltered by the Curonian sand peninsula. Lithuania's major [[warm-water port]], [[Klaipėda]], lies at the narrow mouth of the [[Curonian Lagoon]] (Lithuanian: ''Kuršių marios''), a shallow lagoon extending south to [[Kaliningrad]]. The country's main and largest river, the [[Nemunas River]], and some of its tributaries carry international shipping.

Lithuania lies at the edge of the [[North European Plain]]. Its landscape was smoothed by the glaciers of the [[last glacial period|last ice age]], and is a combination of moderate lowlands and highlands. Its highest point is [[Aukštojas Hill]] at {{convert|294|m|ft|0}} in the eastern part of the country. The terrain features [[List of lakes in Lithuania|numerous lakes]] ([[Lake Vištytis]], for example) and wetlands, and a mixed forest zone covers over 33% of the country. [[Drūkšiai]] is the largest, [[Tauragnas]] is the deepest and [[Asveja]] is the longest lake in Lithuania.

After a re-estimation of the boundaries of the [[continent]] of Europe in 1989, Jean-George Affholder, a scientist at the [[Institut géographique national (France)|Institut Géographique National]] (French National Geographic Institute), determined that the [[geographic centre of Europe]] was in Lithuania, at {{coord|54|54|N|25|19|E|type:landmark|name=Purnuškės (centre of gravity)}}, {{convert|26|km|mi}} north of Lithuania's capital city of [[Vilnius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geosite.jankrogh.com/other.htm |title=Other Places of Interest: Central Europe |author=Jan S. Krogh |accessdate=31 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Affholder accomplished this by calculating the [[centre of gravity]] of the [[Geography of Europe|geometrical figure]] of Europe.

===Climate===
{{Main|Geography of Lithuania#Climate}}
Lithuania's climate, which ranges between [[maritime climate|maritime]] and [[continental climate|continental]], is relatively mild. Average temperatures on the coast are {{convert|-2.5|C}} in January and {{convert|16|°C|0|abbr=on}} in July. In Vilnius the average temperatures are {{convert|-6|°C|0|abbr=on}} in January and {{convert|17|°C|0|abbr=on}} in July. During the summer, {{convert|20|°C|0|abbr=on}} is common during the day while {{convert|14|°C|0|abbr=on}} is common at night; in the past, temperatures have reached as high as {{convert|30|or|35|°C|0|abbr=on}}. Some winters can be very cold. {{convert|-20|°C|0|abbr=on}} occurs almost every winter. Winter extremes are {{convert|-34|°C|0|abbr=on}} in coastal areas and {{convert|-43|°C|0|abbr=on}} in the east of Lithuania.

The average annual precipitation is {{convert|800|mm|1|abbr=on}} on the coast, {{convert|900|mm|1|abbr=on}} in the Samogitia highlands and {{convert|600|mm|1|abbr=on}} in the eastern part of the country. Snow occurs every year, it can snow from October to April. In some years sleet can fall in September or May. The growing season lasts 202 days in the western part of the country and 169 days in the eastern part. Severe storms are rare in the eastern part of Lithuania but common in the coastal areas.

The longest records of measured temperature in the Baltic area cover about 250 years. The data show warm periods during the latter half of the 18th century, and that the 19th century was a relatively cool period. An early 20th century warming culminated in the 1930s, followed by a smaller cooling that lasted until the 1960s. A warming trend has persisted since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltex-research.eu/BACC/events/goteborg/Poster_2_1.pdf |title=Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin – The BACC Project – 22–23&amp;nbsp;May 2006, Göteborg, Sweden |format=PDF|accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lithuania experienced a drought in 2002, causing forest and [[peat]] bog fires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Research Note Effect of drought and fires on the quality of water in Lithuanian rivers|year=2003 |bibcode=2003HESS....7..423S |author=G.

After the restoration of Lithuania's independence in 1990, the ''Aplinkos apsaugos įstatymas'' (Environmental Protection Act) was adopted already in 1992. The law provided the foundations for regulating social relations in the field of environmental protection, established the basic rights and obligations of legal and natural persons in preserving the biodiversity inherent in Lithuania, ecological systems and the landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aplinkos apsaugos įstatymas|url=https://www.e-tar.lt/portal/lt/legalAct/TAR.E2780B68DE62/vsPTFQpUEB|website=e-tar.lt|accessdate=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lithuania agreed to cut [[carbon emissions]] by at least 20% of 1990 levels by the year 2020 and by at least 40% by the year 2030, together with all European Union members. Also, by 2020 at least 20% (27% by 2030) of country's total energy consumption should be from the [[renewable energy]] sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EU climate action|url=https://ec.europa.eu/clima/citizens/eu_en|website=European Commission|accessdate=27 April 2018|language=en|date=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Lithuania introduced especially effective [[container deposit legislation]], which resulted in collecting 92% of all packagings in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Europa suskubo paskui Lietuvą: kuo skiriasi šalių užstato sistemos?|url=https://www.15min.lt/naujiena/aktualu/lietuva/europa-suskubo-paskui-lietuva-kuo-skiriasi-saliu-uzstato-sistemos-56-968940|website=15min.lt|accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lithuania does not have high mountains and its landscape is dominated by blooming meadows, dense forests and fertile fields of cereals. However it stands out by the abundance of [[hillfort]]s, which previously had castles where the ancient Lithuanians burned altars for pagan gods.&lt;ref name="gamta"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gamta|url=http://www.lithuania.travel/lt/objektai/gamta-/80|website=lithuania.travel|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lithuania is a particularly watered region with more than 3,000 lakes, mostly in northeastern Lithuania. Many rivers are also flowing in Lithuania, most notably the longest [[Nemunas]].&lt;ref name="gamta" /&gt;

Forest has long been one of the most important natural resources in Lithuania.

Lithuanian ecosystems include natural and semi-natural (forests, bogs, wetlands, meadows), and anthropogenic (agrarian and urban) ecosystems. Among natural ecosystems, forests are particularly important to Lithuania, covering 33% of the country's territory. Wetlands (raised bogs, fens, transitional mires, etc.) cover 7.9% of the country, with 70% of wetlands having been lost due to drainage and peat extraction between 1960 and 1980. Changes in wetland plant communities resulted in the replacement of moss and grass communities by trees and shrubs, and fens not directly affected by land reclamation have become drier as a result of a drop in the water table. There are 29,000 rivers with a total length of 64,000&amp;nbsp;km in Lithuania, the [[Nemunas River]] basin occupying 74% of the territory of the country. Due to the construction of dams, approximately 70% of spawning sites of potential catadromous fish species have disappeared. In some cases, river and lake ecosystems continue to be impacted by anthropogenic eutrophication.&lt;ref name="cbd"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lithuania – Biodiversity Facts|url=https://www.cbd.int/countries/profile/default.shtml?country=lt#facts|website=cbd.int|accessdate=24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agricultural land comprises 54% of Lithuania's territory (roughly 70% of that is arable land and 30% meadows and pastures), approximately 400,000 ha of agricultural land is not farmed, and acts as an ecological niche for weeds and invasive plant species. Habitat deterioration is occurring in regions with very productive and expensive lands as crop areas are expanded. Currently, 18.9% of all plant species, including 1.87% of all known fungi species and 31% of all known species of lichens, are listed in the [[List of extinct and endangered species of Lithuania|Lithuanian Red Data Book]]. The list also contains 8% of all fish species.&lt;ref name="cbd"/&gt;

The wildlife populations have rebounded as the hunting became more restricted and urbanization allowed replanting forests (forests already tripled in size since their lows). Currently, Lithuania has approximately 250,000 larger wild animals or 5 per each square kilometer. The most prolific large wild animal in every part of Lithuania is the [[roe deer]], with 120,000 of them. They are followed by [[boar]]s (55,000). Other ungulates are the [[deer]] (~22,000), [[fallow-deer]] (~21,000) and the largest one: [[moose]] (~7,000). Among the Lithuanian predators, [[fox]]es are the most common (~27,000). [[Wolve]]s are, however, more ingrained into the mythology as there are just 800 in Lithuania. Even rarer are the [[lynx]]es (~200). The large animals mentioned above exclude the [[rabbit]], ~200,000 of which may live in the Lithuanian forests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fauna of Lithuania|url=http://www.truelithuania.com/tag/fauna-of-lithuania|website=TrueLithuania.com|accessdate=24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Seimas litauensparlament.jpg|thumb|left|[[Seimas]] — (Parliament of Lithuania)]]
Since Lithuania declared the restoration of its independence on 11 March 1990, it has maintained strong democratic traditions. It held its first independent general elections on 25 October 1992, in which 56.75% of voters supported the [[Constitution of Lithuania|new constitution]].&lt;ref name="referenda"&gt;{{lt icon}} [http://www3.lrs.lt/docs2/QKVXRGNF.DOC Nuo 1991 m. iki šiol paskelbtų referendumų rezultatai] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080909201701/http://www3.lrs.lt/docs2/QKVXRGNF.DOC# |date=9 September 2008 }}, Microsoft Word Document, [[Seimas]]. Retrieved 4 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; There were intense debates concerning the constitution, particularly the role of the president. A [[Lithuanian presidency referendum, 1992|separate referendum]] was held on 23 May 1992 to gauge public opinion on the matter, and 41% of voters supported the restoration of the [[President of Lithuania]].&lt;ref name="referenda" /&gt; Through compromise, a [[semi-presidential system]] was agreed on.&lt;ref name="Lina" /&gt;

The Lithuanian [[head of state]] is the president, directly elected for a five-year term and serving a maximum of two terms. The president oversees foreign affairs and national security, and is the [[commander-in-chief]] of the military. The president also appoints the [[Prime Minister of Lithuania|prime minister]] and, on the latter's nomination, the rest of the cabinet, as well as a number of other top civil servants and the judges for all courts.

The current Lithuanian head of state, [[Dalia Grybauskaitė]] was [[Lithuanian presidential election, 2009|elected on 17 May 2009]], becoming the first female president in the country's history, and the second female head of state in the Baltic States after [[Latvia]] elected their first female political leader in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.president.lv/pk/content/?cat_id=16&amp;lng=en&amp;p|title=Biography of Dr: Vaira Vike-Freiberga|date=17 April 2007|publisher=Latvijas Valsts prezidenta kanceleja|accessdate=28 April 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507125756/http://www.president.lv/pk/content/?cat_id=16&amp;lng=en&amp;p|archivedate=7 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dalia Grybauskaitė was [[Lithuanian presidential election, 2014|re-elected for a second term in 2014]].

The judges of the [[Constitutional Court of Lithuania|Constitutional Court]] (''Konstitucinis Teismas'') serve nine-year terms. They are appointed by the President, the Chairman of the Seimas, and the Chairman of the Supreme Court, each of whom appoint three judges. The [[unicameral]] Lithuanian parliament, the [[Seimas]], has 141 members who are elected to four-year terms. 71 of the members of its members are elected in single member constituencies, and the others in a nationwide vote by [[proportional representation]]. A party must receive at least 5% of the national vote to be eligible for any of the 70 national seats in the Seimas.&lt;ref name="Seimas"&gt;{{cite web|title=Seimo rinkimai|url=http://www.lrs.lt/sip/portal.show?p_r=15405&amp;p_k=1|website=lrs.lt|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political parties and elections===
{{Main|Elections in Lithuania}}
Lithuania exhibits a fragmented multi-party system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tlu.ee/stss/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/stss_nov_2011_saarts.pdf |title=Comparative Party System Analysis in Central and Eastern Europe: the Case of the Baltic States |last1=Saarts |first1=Tõnis |publisher=Studies of Transition States and Societies |access-date=31 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019212154/http://www.tlu.ee/stss/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/stss_nov_2011_saarts.pdf |archive-date=19 October 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; with a number of small parties in which coalition governments are common.

Each municipality in Lithuania is governed by a [[municipal council]] and a [[mayor]], who is a member of the municipal council. The number of members, elected on a four-year term, in each municipal council depends on the size of the municipality and varies from 15 (in municipalities with fewer than 5,000 residents) to 51 (in municipalities with more than 500,000 residents). 1,524 municipal council members were elected in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vrk.lt/naujienos/-/content/10180/1/vrk-prieme-svarbius-sprendimus-artejanciu-savivaldybiu-tarybu-rinkimu-klausimais |title=VRK priėmė svarbius sprendimus artėjančių savivaldybių tarybų rinkimų klausimais |language=Lithuanian |trans-title=CEC took important decisions regarding the upcoming election to municipal councils |date=23 September 2014 |publisher=Central Electoral Commission |access-date=31 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212040822/http://www.vrk.lt/naujienos/-/content/10180/1/vrk-prieme-svarbius-sprendimus-artejanciu-savivaldybiu-tarybu-rinkimu-klausimais |archive-date=12 February 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the council, with the exception of the mayor, are elected using proportional representation.

===Law and law enforcement===
{{Main|Law of Lithuania}}
[[File:Lithuanian police Audi A6 in Vilnius.jpg|thumb|Lithuanian Police officers]]
After regaining of independence in 1990, the largely modified Soviet legal codes were in force for about a decade. The current [[Constitution of Lithuania]] was adopted on 25 October 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lietuvos Konstitucija|url=http://www3.lrs.lt/home/Konstitucija/Konstitucija.htm|website=lrs.lt|accessdate=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the [[Civil Code of Lithuania]] was passed in [[Seimas]]. It was succeeded by the [[Criminal Code]] and [[Criminal Procedure]] Code in 2003. The approach to the [[criminal law]] is [[inquisitorial]], as opposed to [[adversarial]]; it is generally characterised by an insistence on formality and rationalisation, as opposed to practicality and informality. Normative legal act enters into force on the next day after its publication in the ''Teisės aktų registras'', unless it has a later entry into force date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nuo 2014 m. sausio 1 d. teisės aktai oficialiai skelbiami Teisės aktų registre|url=http://www3.lrs.lt/pls/inter/w5_show?p_r=4443&amp;p_d=143651&amp;p_k=1|website=3.lrs.lt|accessdate=24 February 2018|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Union law]] is an integral part of the Lithuanian legal system since 1 May 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nacionalinės teisės aktų derinimo su Europos Sąjungos teise metodiniai nurodymai|url=http://www.etd.lt/index.php?189546198|website=etd.lt|accessdate=22 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lithuania, after breaking away from the Soviet Union had a difficult crime situation, however the Lithuanian law enforcement agencies eliminated many criminals over the years, making Lithuania a reasonably safe country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LRT dokumentikos ciklas "Nematoma Lietuvos istorija" – apie valstybės pergalę prieš mafiją|url=http://www.lrt.lt/televizija/anonsai/22093/lrt-dokumentikos-ciklas-nematoma-lietuvos-istorija-apie-valstybes-pergale-pries-mafija|website=LRT|accessdate=5 September 2016|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crime in Lithuania has been declining rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.osac.gov/pages/ContentReportDetails.aspx?cid=21469] {{dead link|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Law enforcement in Lithuania is primarily the responsibility of local ''Lietuvos policija'' (Lithuanian Police) commissariats. They are supplemented by the ''Lietuvos policijos antiteroristinių operacijų rinktinė Aras'' (Anti-Terrorist Operations Team of the Lithuanian Police ''Aras''), ''Lietuvos kriminalinės policijos biuras'' (Lithuanian Criminal Police Bureau), ''Lietuvos policijos kriminalistinių tyrimų centras'' (Lithuanian Police Forensic Research Center) and ''Lietuvos kelių policijos tarnyba'' (Lithuanian Road Police Service).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lietuvos policija|url=https://policija.lrv.lt/|website=policija.lrv.lt|accessdate=31 March 2018|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, there were 63,846 crimes registered in Lithuania. Of these, thefts comprised a large part with 19,630 cases (13.2% less than in 2016). While 2,835 crimes were very hard and hard (crimes that may result in more than six years imprisonment), which is 14.5% less than in 2016. Totally, 129 homicides or attempted homicide occurred (19.9% less than in 2016), while serious bodily harm was registered 178 times (17.6% less than in 2016). Another problematic crime [[contraband]] cases also decreased by 27.2% from 2016 numbers. Meanwhile, crimes in electronic data and information technology security fields noticeably increased by 26.6%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Užregistruota ir ištirta nusikalstamų veikų (2017 / Sausis – Gruodis)|url=https://www.ird.lt/lt/paslaugos/nusikalstamu-veiku-zinybinio-registro-nvzr-paslaugos/ataskaitos-1/nusikalstamumo-ir-ikiteisminiu-tyrimu-statistika-1/view_item_datasource?id=6763&amp;datasource=18743|website=Ird.lt|accessdate=31 March 2018|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2013 Special Eurobarometer, 29% of Lithuanians said that corruption affects their daily lives (EU average 26%). Moreover, 95% of Lithuanians regarded corruption as widespread in their country (EU average 76%), and 88% agreed that bribery and the use of connections is often the easiest way of obtaining certain public services (EU average 73%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lithuania's EU Anti-Corruption Report|date=2014|publisher=European Commission|location=Brussels|pages=2–3|url=https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/what-we-do/policies/organized-crime-and-human-trafficking/corruption/anti-corruption-report/docs/2014_acr_lithuania_chapter_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though, according to local branch of Transparency International, corruption levels have been decreasing over the past decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Korupcija Lietuvoje: prarandame milijonus, jei ne milijardus|url=http://kauno.diena.lt/naujienos/lietuva/salies-pulsas/korupcija-lietuvoje-prarandame-milijonus-jei-ne-milijardus-733110|website=kauno.diena.lt|accessdate=7 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to scientist Gintautas Sakalauskas, this is not because of a high criminality rate in the country, but due to Lithuania's high repression level and the lack of trust of the convicted, who are frequently sentenced to a jail imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kuo mažiau pasitikėjimo, tuo pilnesni kalėjimai: Lietuva kalinių skaičiumi pirmauja|url=https://www.lzinios.lt/lzinios/lietuva/kuo-maziau-pasitikejimo-tuo-pilnesni-kalejimai-lietuva-kaliniu-skaiciumi-pirmauja/248403|website=LZINIOS.lt|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Administrative divisions===
{{Main|Administrative divisions of Lithuania}}
{{See also|Counties of Lithuania|Municipalities of Lithuania|Elderships of Lithuania}}
{{Map of Counties of Lithuania|100px|float=right}}
The current system of administrative division was established in 1994 and modified in 2000 to meet the requirements of the European Union. The country's [[Counties of Lithuania|10 counties]] (Lithuanian: singular – ''apskritis'', plural – ''apskritys'') are subdivided into [[Municipalities of Lithuania|60 municipalities]] (Lithuanian: singular – ''savivaldybė'', plural – ''savivaldybės''), and further divided into 500 [[Elderships of Lithuania|elderships]] (Lithuanian: singular – ''seniūnija'', plural – ''seniūnijos'').

Municipalities have been the most important unit of administration in Lithuania since the system of [[County governor (Lithuania)|county governorship]] (''apskrities viršininkas'') was dissolved in 2010.&lt;ref name="county"&gt;{{lt icon}} [http://www3.lrs.lt/pls/inter3/dokpaieska.showdoc_l?p_id=349513 (Republic of Lithuania Annul Law on County Governing)], [[Seimas]] law database, 7 July 2009, Law no. XI-318.&lt;/ref&gt; Some municipalities are historically called "district municipalities" (often shortened to "district"), while others are called "city municipalities" (sometimes shortened to "city"). Each has its own elected government. The election of municipality councils originally occurred every three years, but now takes place every four years. The council appoints [[elder (administrative title)|elders]] to govern the elderships. Mayors have been directly elected since 2015; prior to that, they were appointed by the council.&lt;ref&gt;{{lt icon}} Justinas Vanagas, [http://www.delfi.lt/news/daily/lithuania/seimas-iteisino-tiesioginius-meru-rinkimus.d?id=65139619 Seimo Seimas įteisino tiesioginius merų rinkimus], Delfi.lt, 26 June 2014. Retrieved 26 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Elderships, numbering over 500, are the smallest administrative units and do not play a role in national politics. They provide necessary local public services—for example, registering births and deaths in rural areas. They are most active in the social sector, identifying needy individuals or families and organizing and distributing welfare and other forms of relief.&lt;ref name="elderates"&gt;{{lt icon}} [http://www3.lrs.lt/pls/inter2/dokpaieska.showdoc_l?p_id=146527 Lietuvos Respublikos vietos savivaldos įstatymo pakeitimo įstatymas], [[Seimas]] law database, 12 October 2000, Law no. VIII-2018. Retrieved 3 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Some citizens feel that elderships have no real power and receive too little attention, and that they could otherwise become a source of local initiative for addressing rural problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{lt icon}} Indrė Makaraitytė, [http://www.delfi.lt/archive/article.php?id=5663231 Europos Sąjungos pinigai kaimo neišgelbės], Atgimimas, Delfi.lt, 16 December 2004.

Lithuania is also active in developing cooperation among northern European countries. It has been a member of the Baltic Council since its establishment in 1993. The Baltic Council, located in [[Tallinn]], is a permanent organisation of international cooperation that operates through the [[Baltic Assembly]] and the Baltic Council of Ministers.

Lithuania also cooperates with Nordic and the two other Baltic countries through the [[NB8]] format. A similar format, NB6, unites Nordic and Baltic members of EU. NB6's focus is to discuss and agree on positions before presenting them to the Council of the European Union and at the meetings of EU foreign affairs ministers.

The [[Council of the Baltic Sea States]] (CBSS) was established in [[Copenhagen]] in 1992 as an informal regional political forum. Its main aim is to promote integration and to close contacts between the region's countries. The members of CBSS are Iceland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Germany, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Poland, Russia, and the European Commission. Its observer states are Belarus, France, Italy, Netherlands, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Ukraine.

The [[Nordic Council|Nordic Council of Ministers]] and Lithuania engage in political cooperation to attain mutual goals and to determine new trends and possibilities for joint cooperation. The Council's information office aims to disseminate [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] concepts and to demonstrate and promote Nordic cooperation.

The Lithuanian National Defence Policy aims to guarantee the preservation of the [[independence]] and [[sovereignty]] of the state, the [[integrity]] of its land, territorial waters and airspace, and its constitutional order. Its main strategic goals are to defend the country's interests, and to maintain and expand the capabilities of its armed forces so they may contribute to and participate in the missions of NATO and European Union member states.&lt;ref name="WB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kam.lt/kam/download/7963/bk-en1.pdf |title=White Paper Lithuanian defence policy |language=lt |website=Kam.lt |accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agriculture===

[[File:Lazdininku malunas.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Windmill]] in Lithuania]]
Agriculture in Lithuania dates to the [[Neolithic]] period, about 3,000 to 1,000 [[Before Christ|BC]]. It has been one of Lithuania's most important occupations for many centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jurginis|first1=J.|title=Arimo įrankių reikšmė žemdirbystės sistemoms|url=http://lad.lt/data/com_ladlibrary/988/156-163.pdf|website=lad.lt|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lithuania's accession to the [[European Union]] in 2004 ushered in a new agricultural era. The EU pursues a very high standard of food safety and purity. In 1999, the [[Seimas]] (parliament) of Lithuania adopted a Law on Product Safety, and in 2000 it adopted a Law on Food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Law on Product Safety|url=https://e-seimas.lrs.lt/portal/legalAct/lt/TAD/f9a7f340736a11e6a0f68fd135e6f40c?jfwid=-brx0ubedz|website=e-seimas.lrs.lt|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Law on Food|url=https://e-seimas.lrs.lt/portal/legalAct/lt/TAD/74505e2018da11e6aa14e8b63147ee94?jfwid=rivwzvpvg|website=e-seimas.lrs.lt|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reform of the agricultural market has been carried out on the basis of these two laws.

In 2016, agricultural production was made for 2.29 billion euros in Lithuania. [[Cereal crops]] occupied the largest part of it (5709,7 tons), other significant types were [[sugar beet]]s (933,9 tons), [[rapeseed]] (392,5 tons) and [[potato]]es (340,2 tons). Products for 4385,2 million euros were exported from Lithuania to the foreign markets, of which products for 3165,2 million euros were Lithuanian origin. Export of agricultural and food products accounted for 19.4% of all exports of goods from the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Žemės ir maisto ūkio 2016 metų apžvalga|url=https://zum.lrv.lt/uploads/zum/documents/files/LT_versija/Veiklos_sritys/Statistin%C4%97%20informacija/%C5%BDem%C4%97s%20ir%20maisto%20%C5%ABkio%202016%20met%C5%B3%20ap%C5%BEvalga%20(03).pdf|website=zum.lrv.lt|pages=1–3|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Organic farming]] is constantly becoming more popular in Lithuania. The status of organic growers and producers in the country is granted by the public body ''Ekoagros''. In 2016, there were 2539 such farms that occupied 225541,78 hectares. Of these, 43,13% were cereals, 31,22% were perennial grasses, 13,9% were leguminous crops and 11,75% were others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Veiklos ataskaita, 2016 m.|url=https://www.ekoagros.lt/media/1/2016-m-veiklos-ataskaita.pdf|website=ekoagros.lt|pages=1–4|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water supply and sanitation===
[[File:Heilquelle.JPG|thumb|upright=0.7|Mineral water spring in [[Birštonas]]]]
Lithuania has one of the largest fresh water supplies, compared with other countries in Europe. Lithuania and [[Denmark]] are the only countries in Europe, which are fully equipped with fresh groundwater. Lithuanians consumes about 0.5 million cubic meters of water per day, which is only 12–14 percent of all explored fresh groundwater resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gėlo vandens ištekliais Lietuva išsiskiria iš kitų Europos šalių|url=http://www.lrt.lt/naujienos/lietuvoje/2/137832/gelo-vandens-istekliais-lietuva-issiskiria-is-kitu-europos-saliu|website=LRT|accessdate=25 May 2016|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water quality in the country is very high and is determined by the fact that drinking water comes from deep layers that are protected from pollution on the surface of the earth. Drilling depth usually reaches 30–50 meters, but in [[Klaipėda Region]] it even reaches 250 meters. Consequently, Lithuania is one of very few European countries where groundwater is used for centralized water supply. With a large underground fresh water reserves, Lithuania exports mineral-rich water to other countries. Approved mineral water quantity is about 2.7 million cubic meters per year, while production is only 4–5 percent of all mineral water resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gėlas vanduo – milžiniškas turtas Lietuvos gelmėse|url=http://alkas.lt/2012/03/15/gelas-vanduo-milziniskas-turtas-lietuvos-gelmese/|website=alkas.lt|accessdate=15 March 2012|language=lt-LT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vilnius]] is the only Baltic capital that uses centralized water supplying from deep water springs, which are protected from pollution and has no [[nitrates]] or [[nitrites]] that are harmful to the human body. Water is cleaned without chemicals in Lithuania. About 20% of the consumed water in the state is a non-filtered very high quality water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Raudonis|first1=Jokūbas|title=Vilniaus turtas – švarus vanduo iš giluminių šaltinių|url=https://verslas.lrytas.lt/rinkos-pulsas/2013/05/08/news/vilniaus-turtas---svarus-vanduo-is-giluminiu-saltiniu-5024475/|website=lrytas.lt|accessdate=8 May 2013|language=lt-LT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the decommissioning of the [[Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant]], Lithuania turned from electricity exporter to electricity importer. Unit No. 1 was closed in December 2004, as a condition of Lithuania's entry into the European Union; Unit No. 2 was closed down on 31 December 2009.

There has been a steady [[Urbanization|movement of population to the cities]] since the 1990s, encouraged by the planning of regional centres, such as [[Alytus]], [[Marijampolė]], [[Utena]], [[Plungė]], and [[Mažeikiai]]. By the early 21st century, about two-thirds of the total population lived in urban areas. {{As of|2015}}, 66.5% of the total population lives in urban areas.&lt;ref name="CIA"/&gt; Lithuania's [[Larger urban zone|functional urban areas]] include [[Vilnius]] (population 696,000 in 2016) and [[Kaunas]] (population 387,000 in 2016).&lt;ref&gt;[http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=urb_lpop1&amp;lang=en] {{dead link|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fDI of the Financial Times in their research ''Cities and Regions of the Future 2018/19'' ranked Vilnius 4th in the mid-sized European cities category and Vilnius county was ranked 10th in the small European regions category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fdiintelligence.com/content/download/71341/2038156/file/fDi%20European%20Cities%20and%20Regions%20of%20the%20Future%202018:19.pdf|website=Fdiintelligence.com|format=PDF|page=57,73|title=Cities and Regions of the Future 2018/19|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003–2012, the network of hospitals was restructured, as part of wider healthcare service reforms. It started in 2003–2005 with the expansion of ambulatory services and primary care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://healthmanagement.org/c/hospital/issuearticle/the-healthcare-system-in-lithuania|title=The Healthcare System in Lithuania|website=healthmanagement.org|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2016, Lithuania ranked 27th in Europe in the [[Euro health consumer index]], a ranking of European healthcare systems based on waiting time, results and other indicators.

{{As of|2015}} Lithuanian [[life expectancy]] at birth was 73.4 (67.4 years for males and 78.8 for females)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Publications/Files/WPP2015_Volume-I_Comprehensive-Tables.pdf|format=PDF|title=World Population Prospects : The 2015 Revision : Volume I: Comprehensive Tables|website=Esa.un.org|accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[infant mortality]] rate was 6.2 per 1,000 births. The annual population growth rate increased by 0.3% in 2007. At 33.5 people per 100,000 in 2012, Lithuania has seen a dramatic rise in suicides in the post-Soviet years, and now records the highest in Europe (cases in rural areas are five times more frequent than in cities)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kauno.diena.lt/naujienos/lietuva/salies-pulsas/lietuva-pagal-savizudybiu-skaiciu-pirmajame-penketuke-pasaulyje-784698|title=Lietuva pagal savižudybių skaičių – pirmajame penketuke pasaulyje|website=kauno.diena.lt|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[List of countries by suicide rate|fourth highest]] age-standardized suicide rate in the world, according to [[WHO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Suicide rates.

By 2000 the vast majority of Lithuanian health care institutions were non-profit-making enterprises and a private sector developed, providing mostly outpatient services which are paid for out-of-pocket. The [[Ministry of Health (Lithuania)|Ministry of Health]] also runs a few health care facilities and is involved in the running of the two major Lithuanian teaching hospitals. It is responsible for the State Public Health Centre which manages the public health network including ten county public health centres with their local branches. The ten [[Counties of Lithuania|counties]] run county hospitals and specialised health care facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Health Care Systems in Transition|date=2000|publisher=WHO|url=http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/95127/E69920.pdf?ua=1|accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is now Compulsory Health Insurance for Lithuanian residents. There are 5 Territorial Health Insurance Funds, covering Vilnius, Kaunas, Klaipėda, Šiauliai and Panevėžys. Contributions for people who are economically active are 9% of income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Compulsory Health Insurance Contributions|url=http://www.vlk.lt/sites/en/health-insurance-in-Lithuania/compulsory-health-insurance-contributions/|publisher=VLK|accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emergency medical services are provided free of charge to all residents.

According to the 2011 census, 77.2% of residents of Lithuania were Catholics.&lt;ref name="stat-rel"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://osp.stat.gov.lt/documents/10180/217110/Gyv_kalba_tikyba.pdf |title=GYVENTOJAI PAGAL TAUTYBĘ, GIMTĄJĄ KALBĄ IR TIKYBĄ |publisher=Department of Statistics to the Government of the Republic of Lithuania |date=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catholicism has been the main religion since the official [[Christianisation of Lithuania]] in 1387. The Catholic Church was prosecuted by the Russian Empire as part of the [[Russification]] policies and by the Soviet Union as part of the overall [[Religion in the Soviet Union|anti-religious campaigns]]. During the Soviet era, some priests actively led the resistance against the Communist regime, as symbolised by the [[Hill of Crosses]] and exemplified by ''[[The Chronicle of the Catholic Church in Lithuania]]''.

4.1% of the population are [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], mainly among the Russian minority. The community of [[Old Believers]] (0.8% of population) dates back to 1660s.

[[Protestants]] are 0.8%, of which 0.6% are [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] and 0.2% are [[Lithuanian Evangelical Reformed Church|Reformed]]. The [[Reformation]] did not impact Lithuania to a great extent as seen in [[East Prussia]], [[Estonia]], or [[Latvia]].

The historical communities of [[Lipka Tatars]] maintain [[Islam in Lithuania|Islam]] as their religion.

The [[Lithuanian language]] (''lietuvių kalba'') is the official state language of Lithuania and is recognized as one of the [[official language]]s of the [[European Union]]. There are about 2.96 million native Lithuanian speakers in Lithuania and about 0.2 million abroad.

Lithuanian is a [[Baltic languages|Baltic language]], closely related to [[Latvian language|Latvian]], although they are not [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]]. It is written in an adapted version of the [[Latin alphabet|Roman script]]. Lithuanian is believed to be the [[conservative (language)|linguistically most conservative]] living [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European tongue]], retaining many features of [[Proto Indo-European language|Proto Indo-European]].&lt;ref name="zinkevicius"&gt;{{cite book | author = Z.

In the modern times, the Lithuanian language is divided into two dialects: [[Aukštaitian dialect]] and [[Samogitian dialect]]. The pronunciation of words varies in both dialects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tarmių skirstymas|url=http://www.tarmes.lt/index_meniu.php?id=1|website=Tarmes.lt|accessdate=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Samogitian dialect also has many completely different words and is even considered as a separate language by some linguists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. Juozas Pabrėža: "Stipriausia kalba Lietuvoje yra žemaičių"|url=http://www.santarve.lt/aktualijos/seniunijoje/dr-juozas-pabreza-stipriausia-kalba-lietuvoje-yra-zemaiciu/|website=santarve.lt|accessdate=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The groundwork for written Lithuanian was laid in 16th and 17th centuries by Lithuanian noblemen and scholars, who promoted Lithuanian language, created dictionaries and published books – [[Mikalojus Daukša]], [[Stanislovas Rapolionis]], [[Abraomas Kulvietis]], [[Jonas Bretkūnas]], [[Martynas Mažvydas]], [[Konstantinas Sirvydas]], Simonas Vaišnoras-Varniškis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vaišnoras Simonas (Varniškis) apie 1545 – †1600 XI 16|url=http://www.varniai-museum.lt/index.php?mid=11&amp;art=460&amp;langID=1|website=Varniai-museum.lt|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first grammar book of the Lithuanian language ''Grammatica Litvanica'' was published in Latin in 1653 by [[Daniel Klein (grammarian)|Danielius Kleinas]].

[[Jonas Jablonskis]] works and activities are especially important for the Lithuanian literature moving from the use of dialects to a standard Lithuanian language. The linguistic material which he collected was published in the 20 volumes of [[Academic Dictionary of Lithuanian]] and is still being used in research and in editing of texts and books. He also introduced the letter ''ū'' into Lithuanian writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Šlekonytė|first1=Jūratė|title=Lietuvių tautosakos populiarintojas Jonas Jablonskis|url=http://www.llti.lt/failai/23_Sukaktys_Jablonskis.pdf|website=llti.lt|accessdate=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
{{Main|Lithuanian literature}}
[[File:Oldest surviving writing in Lithuanian language.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.65|Oldest surviving [[manuscript]] in the [[Lithuanian language]] (beginning of the 16th century), rewritten from a 15th-century original text]]
[[File:Mažvydo Katekizmas, Vilnius.jpg|thumb|upright|The first Lithuanian [[printing|printed]] book ''[[Catechism of Martynas Mažvydas]]'' (1547, Königsberg)]]
There is a great deal of Lithuanian literature written in [[Latin]], the main scholarly language of the Middle Ages. The edicts of the Lithuanian King [[Mindaugas]] is the prime example of the literature of this kind. The [[Letters of Gediminas]] are another crucial heritage of the Lithuanian Latin writings.

One of the first Lithuanian authors who wrote in Latin was [[Mikołaj Hussowczyk|Nicolaus Hussovianus]] (around 1480 – after 1533). His poem ''Carmen de statura, feritate ac venatione bisontis'' (''A Song about the Appearance, Savagery and Hunting of the Bison''), published in 1523, describes the Lithuanian landscape, way of life and customs, touches on some actual political problems, and reflects the clash of paganism and Christianity. A person under the pseudonym {{ill|Michalo Lituanus|lt}} (around 1490 – 1560) wrote a treatise ''[[De moribus tartarorum, lituanorum et moscorum]]'' (''On the Customs of Tatars, Lithuanians and Muscovites'') in the middle of the 16th century, but it was not published until 1615. An extraordinary figure in the cultural life of Lithuania in the 16th century was the lawyer and poet of Spanish origin Petrus Roysius Maurus Alcagnicensis (around 1505 – 1571). The publicist, lawyer, and mayor of Vilnius, [[Augustinus Rotundus]] (around 1520 -1582) wrote a no longer existent history of Lithuania in Latin around the year 1560. loannes Radvanus, a humanist poet of the second half of the 16th century, wrote an epic poem imitating the [[Aeneid]] of [[Virgil|Vergil]]. His ''Radivilias'', intended to become the Lithuanian national epic, was published in Vilnius in 1588.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dambrauskaitė |first1=Ramunė |title=A Latin Funeral Oration From Vilnius (1594) |url=https://books.google.lt/books?id=101lb8v-bJcC&amp;pg=PA253#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |website=books.google.lt |publisher=Leuven University Press, Humanistica Lovaniensia |accessdate=13 July 2018 |location=Leuven |page=253 |language=en |date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

17th century Lithuanian scholars also wrote in Latin – Kazimieras Kojelavičius-Vijūkas, [[Žygimantas Liauksminas]] are known for their Latin writings in theology, rhetorics and music. Albertas Kojalavičius-Vijūkas wrote first printed Lithuanian history ''Historia Lithuania''.

Lithuanian literary works in the [[Lithuanian language]] started being first published in the 16th century. In 1547 [[Martynas Mažvydas]] compiled and published the first printed Lithuanian book ''Katekizmo prasti žodžiai'' (''The Simple Words of Catechism''), which marks the beginning of literature, printed in Lithuanian. He was followed by [[Mikalojus Daukša]] with ''Katechizmas''. In the 16th and 17th centuries, as in the whole Christian Europe, Lithuanian literature was primarily religious.

The evolution of the old (14th–18th century) Lithuanian literature ends with [[Kristijonas Donelaitis]], one of the most prominent authors of the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. Donelaitis' poem ''Metai'' (''[[The Seasons (poem)|The Seasons]]'') is a landmark of the Lithuanian fiction literature, written in [[hexameter]].&lt;ref name="INST"&gt;Institute of Lithuanian Scientific Society. {{cite web|url=http://anthology.lms.lt/ |title=Lithuanian Classic Literature |accessdate=16 February 2009 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050204191505/http://anthology.lms.lt/ |archivedate=4 February 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a mix of [[Classicism]], [[Sentimentalism (literature)|Sentimentalism]] and [[Romanticism]], the Lithuanian literature of the first half of the 19th century is represented by [[Maironis]], [[Antanas Baranauskas]], [[Simonas Daukantas]] and [[Simonas Stanevičius]].&lt;ref name="INST" /&gt; During the Tsarist annexation of Lithuania in the 19th century, the [[Lithuanian press ban]] was implemented, which led to the formation of the [[Knygnešiai]] (Book smugglers) movement. This movement is thought to be the very reason the Lithuanian language and literature survived until today.

20th-century Lithuanian literature is represented by [[Juozas Tumas-Vaižgantas]], [[Antanas Vienuolis]], [[Bernardas Brazdžionis]], [[Antanas Škėma]], [[Balys Sruoga]], [[Vytautas Mačernis]] and [[Justinas Marcinkevičius]].

In 21st-century debuted [[Kristina Sabaliauskaitė]], Renata Šerelytė, Valdas Papievis, [[Laura Sintija Černiauskaitė]], [[Ruta Sepetys|Rūta Šepetys]].

[[File:Kinas Romuva.JPG|thumb|[[Romuva Cinema]], the oldest still operational [[movie theater]] in Lithuania]]
On 28 July 1896, [[Thomas Edison]] live photography session was held in the Concerts Hall of the [[Botanical Garden of Vilnius University]]. After a year, similar American movies were available with the addition of special [[phonograph record]]s that also provided sound. In 1909, Lithuanian cinema pioneers {{ill|Antanas Račiūnas|lt}} and [[Ladislas Starevich]] released their first movies. Soon the Račiūnas' recordings of Lithuania's views became very popular among the [[Lithuanian Americans]] abroad. In 1925, Pranas Valuskis filmed movie ''Naktis Lietuvoje'' (Night in Lithuania) about [[Lithuanian book smugglers]] that left the first bright Lithuanian footprint in [[Hollywood]]. The most significant and mature Lithuanian American movie of the time ''Aukso žąsis'' (Golden goose) was created in 1965 by {{ill|Birutė Pūkelevičiūtė|lt}} that featured motifs from the [[Brothers Grimm]] fairy tales. In 1940, [[Romuva Cinema]] was opened in [[Kaunas]] and currently is the oldest still operational movie theater in Lithuania. After the occupation of the state, movies mostly were used for the [[Soviet propaganda]] purposes, nethertheless Almantas Grikevičius, Gytis Lukšas, Henrikas Šablevičius, Arūnas Žebriūnas, Raimondas Vabalas were able to overcome the obstacles and create valuable films. After the restoration of the independence, [[Šarūnas Bartas]], [[Audrius Stonys]], [[Arūnas Matelis]], Audrius Juzėnas, [[Algimantas Puipa]], {{ill|Janina Lapinskaitė|lt}}, Dijana and her husband Kornelijus Matuzevičius received success in international movie festivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kino Lietuvoje istorija |url=https://sites.google.com/site/lietuvoskinas19/lietuvos-kinas |website=sites.google.com |accessdate=26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lithuanian folk music belongs to [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] music branch which is connected with [[neolithic]] [[corded ware]] culture. Two instrument cultures meet in the areas inhabited by Lithuanians: stringed ([[Kanklės|kanklių]]) and wind instrument cultures. Lithuanian folk music is archaic, mostly used for ritual purposes, containing elements of [[paganism]] faith. There are three ancient styles of singing in Lithuania connected with ethnographical regions: [[monophony]], [[heterophony]] and [[polyphony]]. Folk song genres: Sutartinės (Multipart Songs),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sutartinės, Lithuanian multipart songs|url=https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/sutartines-lithuanian-multipart-songs-00433|website=ich.unesco.org|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wedding Songs, War-Historical Time Songs, Calendar Cycle and Ritual Songs and Work Songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anthology of Lithuanian ethnoculture|url=http://www.lnkc.lt/eknygos/eka/|website=Lnkc.lt|accessdate=23 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lithuanians and other nations which lived in [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] share many dishes and beverages.

'''Makalaka''' is a general designation used by the [[Bechuana]], [[Northern Ndebele people|Matabele]] and kindred peoples, for conquered or [[Slavery|slave]] [[tribe]]s.  Thus, many of the tribes subjugated by the [[Makololo]] chief, [[Sebetwane]] (or Sebituane, or Setitwane) in about 1830 were called Makalaka.  The name is more frequently used to designate the [[Makalanga]], one of the tribes now classed as [[Shona people|Mashona]]s, who were brought into subjection by the Matabele.

'''Pan European Game Information''' ('''PEGI''') is a European [[video game content rating system]] established to help European consumers make informed decisions when buying video games or apps through the use of age recommendations and content descriptors. It was developed by the [[Interactive Software Federation of Europe]] (ISFE) and came into use in April 2003; it replaced many national age rating systems with a single European system. The PEGI system is now used in 38 countries and is based on a code of conduct, a set of rules to which every publisher using the PEGI system is contractually committed. PEGI self-regulation is composed by five age categories and eight content descriptors that advise the suitability and content of a game for a certain age range based on the games content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pegi.info/en/ |title=PEGI Website |publisher=Pegi.info |date= |accessdate=29 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728144723/http://www.pegi.info/en/ |archive-date=28 July 2011 |dead-url=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The age rating is not intended to indicate the difficulty of the game or the skill required to play it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pegi.info/en/index/id/33 |title=PEGI Pan European Game Information – What do the labels mean? |publisher=Pegi.info |date= |accessdate=29 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807040750/http://www.pegi.info/en/index/id/33 |archive-date=7 August 2011 |dead-url=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Age ratings ==
PEGI has five age categories.

The current design was introduced at the end of 2009. Black and white icons were used until June 2009, when the colour-coded PEGI icons were announced, with green for 3 and 7, orange for 12 and 16, and red for 18. Plus signs were removed from the icons, and the background text changed from 'ISFE' from the old, black-and-white icons to 'PEGI' from the new, colour-coded PEGI icons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.next-gen.biz/news/pegi-unveils-new-ratings-symbols|date=17 June 2009|work=Edge|publisher=[[Future Publishing]]|title=PEGI Unveils New Ratings Symbols|author=Tom Ivan|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219192008/http://www.next-gen.biz/news/pegi-unveils-new-ratings-symbols|archivedate=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; That design was slightly altered at the end of 2009, by removing the watermark and locking the URL bar underneath the age rating icon. Reprinted games from 2009 or before often still display the old designs.

In Portugal, two of the PEGI categories were aligned with the age ratings of the film classification system to avoid confusion; 3 was changed to 4 and 7 was changed to 6. Finland also used a modified scale, where 12 became 11 and 16 became 15. Finland fully adopted PEGI on 1 January 2007, and the standard ratings were fully enforced as well.

== PEGI and the European Union ==
A consumer survey commissioned by [[ISFE]] in 2012 demonstrated that the PEGI age rating labels are recognised on average by 51% of respondents in 16 different countries (highest: France 72%; lowest: Czech Republic 28%), while 86% of all respondents found them to be clear and 89% found them useful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isfe.eu/sites/isfe.eu/files/attachments/euro_summary_-_isfe_consumer_study.pdf |title=Videogames in Europe: Consumer Study - European Summary Report |publisher=isfe.eu |date= |accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PEGI is an example of European harmonisation. The European Commission supports the PEGI self-regulation: "PEGI appears to have achieved good results and PEGI On-line is also a promising initiative, making of PEGI a good example of self-regulation in line with the better regulation agenda."&lt;ref&gt;Communication from the commission of the European parliament, the council, the European economic and social committee and the committee of the regions, on the protection of consumers, in particular minors, in respect of the use of video games, Brussels, 2008, p.9&lt;/ref&gt;
Moreover, the European Parliament in its last report on protection of consumers "takes the view that the PEGI system for rating games is an important tool which has improved transparency for consumers, especially parents, when buying games by enabling them to make a considered choice as to whether a game is suitable for children".&lt;ref&gt;Toine Manders, Report of the European Parliament on the protection of the consumers, in particular minors, in respect of the use of video games, 2009, p.6. article 24&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rating process ==
To obtain the ratings for any piece of interactive software, the applicant submits the game with other supporting materials and completes a content declaration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pegi.info/en/index/id/1184/media/pdf/235.pdf|title=PEGI Assessment Form|publisher=Pegi.info|date=|accessdate=6 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111215170513/http://www.pegi.info/en/index/id/1184/media/pdf/235.pdf|archivedate=15 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; all of which is evaluated by an '''independent administrator''' called the [[Netherlands Institute for the Classification of Audiovisual Media]] (NICAM). It is based on the Dutch [[Kijkwijzer]] system as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kijkwijzer.nl/pagina.php?id=3 NICAM website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221174849/http://www.kijkwijzer.nl/pagina.php?id=3 |date=21 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Following the evaluation the applicant will receive a license to use the rating logos. If the applicant disagrees with the rating, they can ask for an explanation or make a complaint to the complaints board. Consumers may also make complaints to this board.

Although PEGI was established by an industry body (ISFE) the ratings are given by a body independent of the industry and the whole system is overseen by a number of different Boards and Committees. There is the '''PEGI Council''', composed mainly by national representatives for PEGI, that recommends adjustments to the code in light of social, legal and technological developments. Members of the PEGI Council are recruited for their skill and experience from among parent/consumer body representatives, child psychologists, media specialists, civil servants, academics and legal advisers versed in the protection of minors in Europe.&lt;ref name="pegi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pegi.info/en/index/id/41/ |title=Website PEGI |publisher=Pegi.info |date= |accessdate=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a '''Complaints Board''' with experts from various European countries. They deal with complaints related to breaches of requirements of the code of conduct or to age rating recommendations. Should a complaint be received from a consumer or publisher regarding a rating given to a game and no satisfactory settlement can be reached by the PEGI administrator through discussion, explanation or negotiation the complainant may formally request the Complaints Board to mediate. Three board members will then convene, hear the complaint and decide on a ruling. Publishers using the PEGI system are bound by the decision of the Complaints Board. Consequently, they are obliged to carry out any corrective actions required and, in cases of non-compliance, are subject to sanctions as laid out by the code.

== Global cooperation in IARC ==
In 2013, PEGI co-founded the [[International Age Rating Coalition]] with [[Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle|USK]] and the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]]. IARC aims to streamline the rating of digitally distributed games and apps by providing a single online system that produces age ratings for all participating regions. By filling out one questionnaire, a publisher instantaneously receives ratings from PEGI, [[Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle|USK]], [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]], [[Australian Classification Board|ACB]] and others.&lt;ref name="ign"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://au.ign.com/articles/2014/09/01/getting-digitally-distributed-games-classified-in-australia-to-be-cost-free|title=Getting Digitally-Distributed Games Classified in Australia to Be Cost-Free - IGN|publisher=au.ign.com|accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dealspwn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dealspwn.com/international-age-ratings-system-160904|title=New International Age Ratings System Launching Worldwide Next Year &amp;#124; Video Game Deals &amp;amp; UK News &amp;#124; Dealspwn.com|publisher=dealspwn.com|accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== PEGI committees ==
There are a number of committees to ensure the system keeps functioning properly.

* '''Experts Group''': The PEGI Experts Group is made up of academics working in the fields of psychology and sociology, and representatives from NICAM, VSC, and the games industry. It works on adapting and modifying the PEGI questionnaire and the underlying criteria to take account of technological and content developments and recommendations made by the PEGI Council or circumstances brought to light by the complaints procedure.
* '''Legal Committee''': Since PEGI is a voluntary system it runs in conjunction with, and is subordinate to, existing national laws, whether they prohibit certain content or establish mandatory rating systems. The Legal Committee's role is to advise PEGI s.a. of any changes to national legislation within participating countries that could affect the voluntary age rating system.
* '''Enforcement Committee''': The Enforcement Committee is charged with implementing the recommendations of the PEGI Council and, more generally, of ensuring the enforcement of the provisions of the PEGI Code of Conduct, including conclusion of the Complaints Board.

== PEGI Online ==
In 2007, the PEGI Online division of PEGI was formed as an addition to the PEGI system for online games. Goals include giving young people in Europe improved protection against unsuitable online gaming content and educating parents on how to ensure safe online play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pegi.info/page/pegi-online |title=PEGI Online Website |publisher=Pegionline.info |date= |accessdate=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This project is supported directly by the European Commission:

{{Quote|PEGI On-line, which was launched in June 2007 and co-funded by the Safer Internet Programme, is the logical development of the PEGI system, designed to better protect young people against unsuitable gaming content and to help parents to understand the risks and potential for harm within this environment.&lt;ref&gt;Communication from the commission of the European parliament, the council, the European economic and social committee and the committee of the regions, on the protection of consumers, in particular minors, in respect of the use of video games, Brussels, 2008, p.3.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

PEGI Online is based on four principles:
* The PEGI Online Safety Code and Framework Contract which is signed by all participants
* The PEGI Online Logo which will be displayed by holders of a licence
* The website for applicants and for the general public
* An independent administration, advice, and dispute settlement process

The licence to display the PEGI Online Logo is granted by the PEGI Online Administrator to any online gameplay service provider that meets the requirements set out in the PEGI Online Safety Code (POSC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pegi.info/page/pegi-online-safety-code |title=PEGI Online Safety Code |publisher=Pegionline.info }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
PEGI is the standard age rating system for video games in 37 European countries and Israel, but products with PEGI labels can be found across the globe alongside other rating systems as a result of import for linguistic reasons (e.g.: English versions in South Africa and the United Arab Emirates, Spanish or Portuguese versions in Latin America). The official status of PEGI ratings varies from country to country, depending on the way national legislation deals with age classification and the protection of minors. In some countries, PEGI is the [[de facto]] standard without specific regulation, other countries have officially acknowledged PEGI as the sole system for age ratings, while yet another number of countries have incorporated the PEGI rating system into laws governing the age classification of media, making the labels enforceable in retail.

[[Image:RoyalPalaceSofia.jpg|left|thumb|250px|The former royal palace in 1917.]]

'''Prince Alexander I Square''' ({{lang-bg|площад Княз Александър I, Ploshtad Knyaz Aleksandar I}}), often called simply '''Battenberg Square''' (площад Батенберг) is the [[List of city squares by size|largest square]] of [[Sofia]], the capital of [[Bulgaria]]. It is named after [[Alexander, Prince of Bulgaria|Alexander Joseph of Battenberg]] (Alexander I of Bulgaria), the first prince of modern Bulgaria. During the [[History of the People's Republic of Bulgaria|Communist rule of Bulgaria]], the square was named '''September 9th''' '''Square''', after a coup on September 9, 1944, made the country a [[Communist state]].  Before 1944, the square was known as '''Tsar's Square''' because the former royal palace, now the [[National Art Gallery (Bulgaria)|National Art Gallery]] was located there. It was the site of the [[Georgi Dimitrov Mausoleum]] from 1949 until 1999. It is arguably the most suitable place in Sofia for major open-air concerts such as the concert series ''"Opera on the Square"'', demonstrations, parades (including the military parade on [[St George's Day#St. George.27s Day in Bulgaria|St George's Day]]) and other large-scale events. 

== Events ==
[[File:UnitMD Parade.jpg|thumb|A Moldovan military band on the square in 2009.]]
During the communist era, September 9th Square was the main site of civil and military parades in honor of [[International Workers' Day]], The [[Bulgarian coup d'état of 1944]], The [[Great October Socialist Revolution]], and in 1981 the [[1300th Anniversary of the Bulgarian State Parade|1300th Anniversary of the Bulgarian State]]. The government leaders ascended to the top of the Georgi Dimitrov Mausoleum to view these parades. After the fall of communism in 1989, only parades were held in honor of Armed Forces Day.

The '''Sichuanese''', '''Sze Chuan''' or '''Si Ch'uan''' (previous romanize spelling) people ([[Sichuanese Mandarin|Sichuanese]]: 巴蜀人 Ba&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;su&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;ren&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|[pa&lt;sup&gt;55&lt;/sup&gt;su&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;zən&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;]}}; alternatively 川人, 川渝人, 四川人 or 巴蜀民系) are a subgroup of [[Han Chinese]] living in mostly [[Sichuan]] province and [[Chongqing]] municipality of [[China]].

==History==
[[File:E-MJ - engineering and mining journal (1920) (14578888028).jpg|thumb|left|A river towing party of Sichuanese [[coolie]]s, 1920.]]
Beginning from the 9th century BC, [[Shu (state)|Shu]] (on the [[Chengdu Plain]]) and [[Ba (state)|Ba]] (which had its first capital at [[Enshi City]] in [[Hubei]] and controlled part of the [[Han River (Shaanxi and Hubei)|Han Valley]]) emerged as cultural and administrative centers where two rival kingdoms were established. Although eventually the [[Qin dynasty]] destroyed the kingdoms of Shu and Ba, the Qin government accelerated the technological and agricultural advancements of Sichuan making it comparable to that of the [[Yellow River]] Valley. The now-extinct [[Ba-Shu Chinese|Ba-Shu language]] was derived from Qin-era settlers and represents the earliest documented division from what is now called [[Middle Chinese]].

During the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] and [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] dynasties, the population of Sichuan where [[Chengdu-Chongqing dialect]] is now spoken at was reduced through wars and the [[bubonic plague]] and settlers arrived from the area of modern [[Hunan]], [[Hubei]], [[Guangdong]] and [[Jiangxi]], replacing the earlier spoken Chinese dialect with a new standard.&lt;ref name="parsons"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Culmination of a Chinese Peasant Rebellion: Chang Hsien-chung in Szechwan, 1644–46 |author= James B. Parsons |journal=The Journal of Asian Studies |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=387–400 |publisher= |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?aid=7001496 |year=1957 |doi=10.2307/2941233}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Yingcong Dai|title=The Sichuan Frontier and Tibet: Imperial Strategy in the Early Qing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DYHfVVAAf_kC&amp;pg=PA16#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2009|publisher=University of Washington Press|isbn=978-0-295-98952-5|pages=16–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Migration and settlement in Sichuan, 1644-1796|first=Robert Eric |last=Entenmann|publisher=Harvard University|year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent history===
Many migrant workers from rural Sichuan have migrated to other parts of the country, where they often face [[regional discrimination in China|discrimination]] in employment, housing etc.&lt;ref&gt;Handbook of Chinese Migration: Identity and Wellbeing&lt;/ref&gt; A common [[stereotype]] about Sichuanese people is that they are hot tempered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Chinese Migration: Identity and Wellbeing|first1= Robyn R. |last1=Iredale|first2=Fei |last2=Guo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
{{Main|Sichuanese Mandarin|Minjiang dialect|Ba-Shu Chinese}}
{{See also|Bashu culture}}
[[File:Sichuanese in China.png|thumb|right|Locations of present-day Sichuanese speakers.]]

The Sichuanese once spoke their own variety of spoken Chinese called [[Ba-Shu Chinese]], or Old Sichuanese before it became extinct during the Ming dynasty. Now most of them speak [[Sichuanese Mandarin]]. The [[Minjiang dialect]]s are thought by some linguists to be a bona fide descendant of Old Sichuanese due to many characteristics of [[Ba-Shu Chinese]] phonology and vocabulary being found in the dialects,&lt;ref&gt;试论宋代巴蜀方言与现代四川方言的关系》"&gt;刘晓南（2009年第8卷第6期），《试论宋代巴蜀方言与现代四川方言的关系——兼谈文献考证的一个重要功用：追寻失落的方言》，语言科学&lt;/ref&gt; but there is no conclusive evidence whether Minjiang dialects are derived from Old Sichuanese or Southwestern Mandarin.

==Cuisine==
{{Main|Sichuan cuisine}}
Sichuan is well known for its spicy cuisine and use of [[Sichuan pepper]]s due to its more arid climate.

* [[Chen Shou]], official and writer

The '''United Nations Integrated Office in Burundi''' ('''BINUB''') was established by the [[United Nations Security Council]] to support the government of [[Burundi]] in its efforts towards long-term peace and stability and to replace the work of [[United Nations Operation in Burundi]] (ONUB).&lt;ref name="UN_SRES17192006"&gt;{{UN document |docid=S-RES-1719(2006) |type=Resolution |body=Security Council |year=2006 |resolution_number=1719 |accessdate=2008-08-28|date=25 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its mandate was scheduled to begin on 1 January 2007 for an initial 12 months, and its creation and mission was as a result of recommendations in a report by the Secretary-General.&lt;ref name="UN_S2006429"&gt;{{UN document |docid=S-2006-429 |type=Document |body=Security Council |year=2006 |document_number=429 |accessdate=2008-08-28|title=Seventh report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Operation in Burundi|date=21 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UN_S2006429Add1"&gt;{{UN document |docid=S-2006-429-Add.1 |type=Document |body=Security Council |year=2006 |document_number=429-Add.1 |accessdate=2008-08-28|title=Seventh report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Operation in Burundi - Addendum|date=14 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The previous UN mission in Burundi, ONUB, was created to facilitate the implementation of the peace agreements signed between the previous government and the [[CNDD-FDD]] rebel group. The CNDD-FDD's leader Pierre Nkurunziza went on to win the Burundian elections in 2005, and his party effectively controls the Burundian government.

The reasons for establishing a second mission in Burundi, following directly on the ONUB missions, was the ceasefire agreement reached between the new CNDD-FDD government and the last remaining rebel group Palipehutu-FNL. This ceasefire agreement was signed on 7 September 2006 in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, after mediation by South Africa in talks that began in May. Among the key points in the agreement were a complete cessation of hostilities, temporary immunity for FNL fighters and the demobilization of these troops and their subsequent integration into the armed forces of Burundi, in line with earlier peace agreements in this conflict that all stipulated power-sharing arrangements in the security sector.

The BINUB mission was created to facilitate the implementation of this ceasefire agreement, with the most important point of the mandate being the support of the implementation of the modalities of the agreement, assistance in the reform of the security sector and support of the reintegration of ex-combatants[http://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N06/585/71/PDF/N0658571.pdf?OpenElement]. The Burundian government also requested the BINUB to help in the establishment of [[rule of law]], [[good governance]] and [[freedom of press]] and media.

The mandate of BINUB currently extends to the end of 2010.&lt;ref name="UN_SRES17912007"&gt;{{UN document |docid=S-RES-1791(2007) |type=Resolution |body=Security Council |year=2007 |resolution_number=1791 |accessdate=2008-08-28|date=19 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was replaced by the [[United Nations Office in Burundi]] (BNUB) on 1 January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://bnub.unmissions.org/Default.aspx?tabid=2963&amp;language=en-US&lt;/ref&gt;
