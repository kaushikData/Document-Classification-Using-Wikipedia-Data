In addition, the reverse effect is argued, where it is proposed that language comprehension influences movement and sensation. Proponents of the bi-directional hypothesis of language and action conduct and interpret [[Linguistics|linguistic]], [[Cognitive science|cognitive]], and [[Kinesiology|movement]] studies within the framework of [[embodied cognition]] and [[embodied language processing]]. '''Embodied language''' developed from embodied cognition, and proposes that sensorimotor systems are not only involved in the comprehension of language, but that they are necessary for understanding the [[Semantics|semantic]] meaning of words.

Action-oriented models of cognition propose that cognitive processes stem from action (bottom, red), thereby necessitating sensorimotor systems for higher cognitive processes like language comprehension. Adapted from Kilner et al. (2016).]]
The theory that sensory and motor processes are coupled to cognitive processes stems from action-oriented models of cognition.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://bernhard-hommel.eu/SFR18_10%20Kilner%20et%20al.pdf|title=The Pragmatic Turn: Toward Action-Oriented Views in Cognitive Science|last=Kilner|first=J.|last2=Hommel|first2=B.|last3=Bar|first3=M.|last4=Barsalou|first4=L.W.|last5=Friston|first5=K.J.|last6=Jost|first6=J.|last7=Maye|first7=A.|last8=Metzinger|first8=T.|last9=Pulvermuller|first9=F. et al.,|publisher=MIT Press|year=2016|isbn=|volume=18|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=159–173|chapter=Action-oriented models of cognitive processing: A little less cogitation, a little more action please}}&lt;/ref&gt; These theories, such as the [[Embodied cognition|embodied]] and [[Situated cognition|situated]] cognitive theories, propose that cognitive processes are rooted in areas of the brain involved in [[Motor cortex|movement planning and execution]], as well as areas responsible for [[Primary sensory areas|processing]] [[Sensory cortex|sensory]] input, termed sensorimotor areas or areas of action and perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barsalou|first=L.W.|year=2008|title=Grounded Cognition|url=|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=59|pages=617–645|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to action-oriented models, higher cognitive processes evolved from sensorimotor brain regions, thereby necessitating sensorimotor areas for cognition and language comprehension.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; With this organization, it was then hypothesized that action and cognitive processes exert influence on one another in a bi-directional manner: action and perception influence language comprehension, and language comprehension influences sensorimotor processes.

Although studied in a unidirectional manner for many years, the bi-directional hypothesis was first described and tested in detail by Aravena et al.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These authors utilized the [[Embodied language processing#Action-Sentence Compatibility Effect .28ACE.29|Action-Sentence Compatibility Effect (ACE)]], a task commonly used to study the relationship between action and language, to test the effects of performing simultaneous language comprehension and motor tasks on neural and behavioral signatures of movement and language comprehension.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These authors proposed that these two tasks cooperate bi-directionally when compatible, and interfere bi-directionally when incompatible.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For example, when the movement implied by the action language stimuli is compatible with the movement being performed by the subject, it was hypothesized that performance of both tasks would be enhanced.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Neural evidence of the bi-directional hypothesis was demonstrated by this study,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and the development of this hypothesis is ongoing.

== Effects of Language Comprehension on Systems of Action ==
Language comprehension tasks can exert influence over systems of action, both at the neural and behavioral level. This means that language stimuli influence both electrical activity in sensorimotor areas of the brain, as well as actual movement.

=== Neural activation ===
Language stimuli influence electrical activity in sensorimotor areas of the brain that are specific to the bodily-association of the words presented. This is referred to as [[Semantics|semantic]] [[Somatotopic arrangement|somatotopy]], which indicates activation of sensorimotor areas that are specific to the bodily association implied by the word. For example, when processing the meaning of the word “kick,” the regions in the motor and somatosensory cortices that represent the legs will become more active.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hauk|first=O.|last2=Johnsrude|first2=I.|last3=Pulvermüller|first3=F.|date=2004|title=Somatotopic representation of action words in human motor and premotor cortex|url=|journal=Neuron|volume=41|pages=301–307}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boulenger|first=V.|last2=Hauk|first2=O.|last3=Pulvermüller|first3=F.|date=2009|title=Grasping ideas with the motor system: Semantic somatotopy in idiom comprehension|url=|journal=Cerebral Cortex|volume=19|pages=1905–1914}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boulenger et al.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; demonstrated this effect by presenting subjects with action-related language while measuring neural activity using [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]]. Subjects were presented with action sentences that were either associated with the legs (e.g. “John kicked the object”) or with the arms (e.g. “Jane grasped the object”). The medial region of the [[motor cortex]], known to represent the legs, was more active when subjects were processing leg-related sentences, whereas the lateral region of the motor cortex, known to represent the arms, was more active with arm-related sentences.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This body-part-specific increase in activation was exhibited about 3 seconds after presentation of the word, a time window that is thought to indicate [[semantic processing]].&lt;ref&gt;Humphries, C., Binder, J.R., Medler, D.A., Liebenthal, E. (2007). "Time-course of semantic processes during sentence comprehension: an fMRI study." ''Neuroimage''. '''36''': 924-932.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, this activation was associated with subjects comprehending the meaning of the word. This effect held true, and was even intensified, when subjects were presented with [[idiom]]atic sentences.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Abstract language that implied more figurative actions were used, either associated with the legs (e.g. “John kicked the habit”) or the arms (e.g. “Jane grasped the idea”).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Increased neural activation of leg motor regions were demonstrated with leg-related idiomatic sentences, whereas arm-related idiomatic sentences were associated with increased activation of arm motor regions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This activation was larger than that demonstrated by more literal sentences (e.g. “John kicked the object”), and was also present in the time window associated with semantic processing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Action language not only activates body-part-specific areas of the motor cortex, but also influences neural activity associated with movement. This has been demonstrated during an [[Embodied language processing#Action-Sentence Compatibility Effect .28ACE.29|Action-Sentence Compatibility Effect (ACE)]] task, a common test used to study the relationship between language comprehension and motor behavior.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Glenberg|first=A. M.|last2=Kaschak|first2=M.P.|date=2002|title=Grounding language in action|url=|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|volume=9|pages=558–565}}&lt;/ref&gt; This task requires the subject to perform movements to indicate understanding of a sentence, such as moving to press a button or pressing a button with a specific hand posture, that are either compatible or incompatible with movement implied by the sentence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For example, pressing a button with an open hand to indicate understanding of the sentence "Jane high-fived Jack" would be considered a compatible movement, as the sentence implies an open-handed posture. Motor potentials (MP) are an [[Event-related potential|Event Related Potentials]] (ERPs) stemming from the motor cortex, and are associated with execution of movement.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Enhanced amplitudes of MPs have been associated with precision and quickness of movements.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hatta|first=A.|last2=Nishihira|first2=Y.|last3=Higashiura|first3=T.|last4=Kim|first4=S.R.|last5=Kaneda|first5=T.|date=2009|title=Long-term motor practice induces practice-dependent modulation of movement-related cortical potentials (MRCP) preceding self-paced non-dominant handgrip movement in kendo players|url=|journal=Neuroscience Letters|volume=459|pages=105–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Slobounov|first=S.|last2=Johnston|first2=J.|last3=Chiang|first3=H.|last4=Ray|first4=W.J.|date=2002|title=Motor-related cortical potentials accompanying enslaving effect in single versus combination of fingers force production tasks|url=|journal=Clinical Neurophysiology|volume=113|pages=1444–1453}}&lt;/ref&gt; Re-afferent potentials (RAPs) are another form of ERP, and are used as a marker of sensory feedback&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Deecke|first=L.|date=1987|title=Bereitschaftspotential as an indicator of movement preparation in supplementary motor area and motor cortex|url=|journal=Ciba Foundation Symposium|volume=132|pages=231–250}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=A.L.|last2=Staines|first2=W.R.|date=2006|title=Cortical adaptions and motor performance improvement associated with short-term bimanual training|url=|journal=Brain Research|volume=1071|pages=165–174}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both MP and RAP have been demonstrated to be enhanced during compatible ACE conditions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These results indicate that language can have a facilitory effect on the excitability of neural sensorimotor systems. This has been referred to as [[Priming (psychology)#Semantic|semantic]] [[Priming (psychology)|priming]],&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grisoni|first=L.|last2=Dreyer|first2=F.R.|last3=Pulvermüller|first3=F.|date=2016|title=Somatotopic Semantic Priming and Prediction in the Motor System|url=|journal=Cerebral Cortex|volume=26|pages=2353–2366}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicating that language primes neural sensorimotor systems, altering excitability and movement.

=== Movement ===
The ability of language to influence neural activity of motor systems also manifests itself behaviorally by altering movement. Semantic priming has been implicated in these behavioral changes, and has been used as evidence for the involvement of the motor system in language comprehension. The [[Embodied language processing#Action-Sentence Compatibility Effect .28ACE.29|Action-Sentence Compatibility Effect (ACE)]] is indicative of these semantic priming effects. Understanding language that implies action may invoke motor facilitation, or prime the motor system, when the action or posture being performed to indicate language comprehension is compatible with action or posture implied by the language. Compatible ACE tasks have been shown to lead to shorter reaction times.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zwaan|first=R.A.|last2=Taylor|first2=L.J.|date=2006|title=Seeing, acting, understanding: motor resonance in language comprehension|url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|volume=135|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect has been demonstrated on various types of movements, including hand posture during button pressing,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; reaching,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and manual rotation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Language stimuli can also prime the motor system simply by describing objects that are commonly manipulated. In a study performed by Masson et al., subjects were presented with sentences that implied non-physical, abstract action with an object (e.g. "John thought about the calculator" or "Jane remembered the thumbtack").&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; After presentation of language stimuli, subjects were cued to perform either functional gestures, gestures typically made when using the object described in the sentence (e.g. poking for calculator sentences), or a volumetric gesture, gestures that are more indicative of whole hand posture (e.g. horizontal grasp for calculator sentences).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Target gestures were either compatible or incompatible with the described object, and were cued at two different time points, early and late. Response latencies for performing compatible functional gestures significantly decreased at both time points, whereas latencies were significantly lower for compatible volumetric gestures in the late cue condition.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Masson|first=M.E.|last2=Bub|first2=D.N.|last3=Newton-Taylor|first3=M.|date=2008|title=Language-based access to gestural components of conceptual knowledge|url=|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology|volume=61|pages=869–882}}&lt;/ref&gt; These results indicate that descriptions of abstract interactions with objects automatically (early time point) generate motor representations of functional gestures, priming the motor system and increasing response speed.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The specificity of enhanced motor responses to the gesture-object interaction also highlights the importance of the motor system in semantic processing, as this enhanced motor response was dependent on the meaning of the word.  
[[File:Olmstead et al. figure.png|left|thumb|Change in relative phase shift (RPS), indicating movement coordination, as a function of language stimuli. Subjects exhibited a significant change in RPS only when presented with performable sentences. Adapted from Olmstead et al. (2009).]]
A study performed by Dr. Olmstead et al.,&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olmstead|first=A.J.|last2=Viswanathan|first2=N.|last3=Aicher|first3=K.A.|last4=Fowler|first4=C.A.|date=2009|title=Sentence comprehension affects the dynamics of bimanual coordination: Implications for embodied cognition|url=|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology|volume=62|pages=2409–2417}}&lt;/ref&gt; described in detail [[Embodied cognition#Language comprehension|elsewhere]], demonstrates more concretely the influence that the semantics of action language can have on movement coordination. Briefly, this study investigated the effects of action language on the coordination of rhythmic bimanual hand movements. Subjects were instructed to move two [[pendulum]]s, one with each hand, either in-[[Phase (waves)|phase]] (pendulums are at the same point in their cycle, [[phase difference]] of roughly 0 degrees) or anti-phase (pendulums are at the opposite point in their cycle, phase difference of roughly 180 degrees).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Robust behavioral studies have revealed that these two phase states, with phase differences 180 and 0 degrees, are the two stable relative phase states, or the two coordination patterns that produce stable movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Information, natural law, and the self-assembly of rhythmic movement|last=Kugler|first=P.|last2=Turvey|first2=M.|publisher=Routledge|year=1987|isbn=|location=Hillside, NJ|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This pendulum swinging task was performed as subjects judged sentences for their plausibility; subjects were asked to indicate whether or not each presented sentence made logical sense.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Plausible sentences described actions that could be performed by a human using the arms, hands, and/or fingers ("He is swinging the bat"), or actions that could not be performed ("The barn is housing the goat").&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Implausible sentences also used similar action verbs ("He is swinging the hope"). Plausible, performable sentences lead to a significant change in the relative phase shift of the bimanual pendulum task.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The coordination of the movement was altered by action language stimuli, as the relative phase shift that produced stable movement was significantly different than in the non-performable sentence and no language stimuli conditions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This development of new stable states has been used to imply a reorganization of the motor system utilized to plan and execute this movement,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and supports the bi-directional hypothesis by demonstrating an effect of action language on movement.

== Effects of Systems of Action on Language Comprehension ==
The bi-directional hypothesis of action and language proposes that altering the activity of motor systems, either through altered neural activity or actual movement, influences language comprehension. Neural activity in specific areas of the brain can be altered using [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS), or by studying patients with [[Neuropathology|neuropathologies]] leading to specific sensory and/or motor deficits. Movement is also used to alter the activity of neural motor systems, increasing overall excitability of motor and pre-motor areas.

=== Neural activation ===
Altered neural activity of motor systems has been demonstrated to influence language comprehension. One such study that demonstrates this effect was performed by Dr. Pulvermüller et al.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pulvermüller|first=F.|last2=Hauk|first2=O.|last3=Nikulin|first3=V.|last4=Ilmoneimi|first4=R.J.|date=2005|title=Functional links between motor and language systems|url=|journal=European Journal of Neuroscience|volume=21|pages=793–797}}&lt;/ref&gt; TMS was used to increase the excitability of either the leg region or the arm region of the [[motor cortex]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Authors stimulated the left motor cortex, known to be more closely involved in language processing in right-handed individuals, the right motor cortex, as well as a sham stimulation where stimulation was prevented by a plastic block placed between the coil and the skull.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; During the stimulation protocols, subjects were shown 50 arm, 50 leg, 50 distractor (no bodily relation), and 100 pseudo- (not real) words.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Subjects were asked to indicate recognition of a meaningful word by moving their lips, and response times were measured.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; It was found that stimulation of the left leg region of the motor cortex significantly reduced response times for recognition of leg words as compared to arm words, whereas the reverse was true for stimulation of the arm region.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Stimulation site on the right motor cortex, as well as sham stimulation, did not exhibit these effects.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Therefore, somatotopically-specific stimulation of the left motor cortex facilitated word comprehension in a body-part-specific manner, where stimulation of the leg and arm regions lead to enhanced comprehension of leg and arm words, respectively.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This study has been used as evidence for the bi-directional hypothesis of language and action, as it showcases that manipulating motor cortex activity alters language comprehension in a semantically-specific manner.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

A similar experiment has been performed on the articulatory motor cortex, or the mouth and lip regions of the motor cortex used in the production of words.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schomers|first=M.R.|last2=Kirilina|first2=E.|last3=Weigand|first3=A.|last4=Bajbouj|first4=M.|last5=Pulvermüller|first5=F.|date=2014|title=Causal influence of articulatory motor cortex on comprehending single spoken words: TMS evidence|url=|journal=Cerebral Cortex|volume=25|pages=3894–3902}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two categories of words were used as language stimuli: words that involved the lips for production (e.g. "pool") or the tongue (e.g. "tool).&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Subjects listened to the words, were shown pairs of pictures, and were asked to indicate which picture matched the word they heard with a button press.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; TMS was used prior to presentation of the language stimuli to selectively facilitate either the lip or tongue regions of the left motor cortex; these two TMS conditions were compared to a control condition where TMS was not applied.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; It was found that stimulation of the lip region of the motor cortex lead to a significantly decreased response time for lip words as compared to tongue words.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In addition, during recognition of tongue words, reduced reaction times were seen with tongue TMS as compared to lip TMS and no TMS.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Although this same effect was not seen with lip words, authors attribute this to the complexity of tongue as opposed to lip movements, and the increase difficulty of tongue words as opposed to lip.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Overall, this study demonstrates that the activity in the articulatory motor cortex influences the comprehension of single spoken words, and highlights the importance of the motor cortex in speech comprehension&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Lesions of sensory and motor areas have also been studied to elucidate the effects of sensorimotor systems on language comprehension. One such example of this is the patient JR; this patient has a lesion in areas in the auditory association [[Auditory cortex|cortex]] implicated in processing [[Auditory system|auditory]] information.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trumpp|first=N.M.|last2=Kliese|first2=D.|last3=Hoenig|first3=K.|last4=Haarmeier|first4=T.|last5=Kiefer|first5=M.|date=2013|title=Losing the sound of concepts: Damage to auditory association cortex impairs the processing of sound-related concepts|url=|journal=Cortex|volume=49|pages=474–486}}&lt;/ref&gt; This patient showcases significant impairments in conceptual and perceptual processing of sound-related language and objects.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; For example, processing the meaning of words describing sound-related objects (e.g., "bell') was significantly impaired in JR as compared to non-sound-related objects (e.g., "armchair").&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; These data suggest that damage of sensory regions involved in processing auditory information specifically impair processing of sound-related conceptual information,&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; highlighting the necessity of sensory systems for language comprehension.

=== Movement ===
Movement has been shown to influence language comprehension. This has been demonstrated by priming motor areas with movement, increasing the excitability of motor and pre-motor areas associated with the body part being moved.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mollo|first=G.|last2=Pulvermüller|first2=F.|last3=Hauk|first3=O.|date=2016|title=Movement priming of EEG/MEG brain responses for action-words characterizes the link between language and action|url=|journal=Cortex|volume=74|pages=262–276}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been demonstrated that motor engagement of a specific body part decreases neural activity in language processing areas when processing words related to that body part.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; This decreased neural activity is a feature of semantic priming, and suggests that activation of specific motor areas through movement can facilitate language comprehension in a semantically-dependent manner.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; An interference effect has also been demonstrated. During incompatible ACE conditions, neural signatures of language comprehension have been shown to be inhibited.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Combined, these pieces of evidence have been used to support a semantic role of the motor system.

Movement can also inhibit language comprehension tasks, particularly tasks of verbal working memory.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shebani|first=Z.|last2=Pulvermüller|first2=F.|date=2013|title=Moving the hands and feet specifically impairs working memory for arm-and leg-related action words|url=|journal=Cortex|volume=49|pages=222–231}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked to memorize and verbally recall four-word sequences of either arm or leg action words, performing complex, rhythmic movements after presentation of the word sequences was demonstrated to interfere with memory performance.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; This performance deficit was body-part specific, where movement of the legs impaired performance of recall of leg words, and movement of the arms impaired recall of arm words.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; These data indicate that sensorimotor systems exhibit cortically specific "inhibitory casual effects" on memory of action words,&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; as impairment was specific to motor engagement and bodily association of the words.

== Organization of Neural Substrates ==
Relating cognitive functions to brain structures is done in the field of [[cognitive neuroscience]]. This field attempts to map cognitive processes, such as language comprehension, onto neural activation of specific brain structures.The bi-directional hypothesis of language and action requires that action and language processes have overlapping brain structures, or shared [[neural substrate]]s, thereby necessitating motor areas for language comprehension. The neural substrates of embodied cognition are often studied using the cognitive tasks of [[Cognitive neuroscience of visual object recognition|object recognition]], [[Activity recognition|action recognition]], [[Working memory|working memory tasks]], and [[Sentence processing|language comprehension]] tasks. These networks have been elucidated with behavioral, computational, and imaging studies, but the discovery of their exact organization is ongoing.

=== Circuit organization ===
[[File:Leg Neural Network.jpg|thumb|Proposed organization of motor-semantic neural circuits for action language comprehension. Gray dots represent areas of language comprehension, creating a network for comprehending all language. The semantic circuit of the motor system, particularly the motor representation of the legs (yellow dots), is incorporated when leg-related words are comprehended. Adapted from Shebani et al. (2013).]]
It has been proposed that the control of movement is organized hierarchically, where movement is not controlled by individually controlling single neurons, but that movements are represented at a gross, more functional level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kawato|first=M.|last2=Furukawa|first2=K.|last3=Suzuki|first3=R.|date=1987|title=A hierarchical neural-network model for control and learning of voluntary movement|url=|journal=Biological cybernetics|volume=57|pages=169–185}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar concept has been applied to the control of cognition, resulting in the theory of cognitive circuits.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pulvermüller|first=F.|last2=Garagnani|first2=M.|last3=Wennekers|first3=T.|date=2014|title=Thinking in circuits: toward neurobiological explanation in cognitive neuroscience|url=|journal=Biological cybernetics|volume=108|pages=573–593}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory proposes that there are functional units of neurons in the brain that are strongly connected, and act coherently as a functional unit during cognitive tasks.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; These functional units of neurons, or "thought circuits," have been referred to as the "building blocks of cognition".&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Thought circuits are believed to have been originally formed from basic anatomical connections, that were strengthened with correlated activity through [[Hebbian theory|Hebbian learning]] and plasticity.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Formation of these neural networks has been demonstrated with computational models using known anatomical connections and Hebbian learning principles.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;Pulvermüller, F., &amp; Garagnani, M. (2014). From sensorimotor learning to memory cells in prefrontal and temporal association cortex: a neurocomputational study of disembodiment. ''Cortex,'' '''57:''' 1-21.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, sensory stimulation through interaction with an object activates a distributed network of neurons in the cortex. Repeated activation of these neurons, through Hebbian plasticity, may strengthen their connections and form a circuit.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Doursat, R., &amp; Bienenstock, E. "Neocortical self-structuration as a basis for learning." ''5th International conference on development and learning (ICDL 2006)''. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; This sensory circuit may then be activated during the perception of known objects.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

This same concept has been applied to action and language, as understanding of the meaning of action words requires an understanding of the action itself. During language and motor skill development, one likely learns to associate an action word with an action or a sensation.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; This action or sensation, and the correlated sensorimotor areas involved, are then incorporated into the neural representation of that concept.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; This leads to semantic topography, or the activation of motor areas related to the meaning and bodily-association of action language.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These networks may be organized into "kernels," areas highly activated by language comprehension tasks, and "halos," brain areas in the periphery of networks that experience slightly increased activation.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; It has been hypothesized that language comprehension is housed in the left-perisylvian neuronal circuit, forming the "kernel," and sensorimotor regions are peripherally activated during semantic processing of action language, forming the "halo".&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

=== Evidence for shared neural networks ===
Many studies that have demonstrated a role of the motor system in semantic processing of action language have been used as evidence for a shared neural network between action and language comprehension processes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; For example, facilitated activity in language comprehension areas, evidence of semantic priming, with movement of a body part that is associated with the action word has also been used as evidence for this shared neural network.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; A more specific method for identifying whether certain areas of the brain are necessary for a cognitive task is to demonstrate impaired performance of said task following a functional change to the brain area of interest.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;Shallice, T. ''From neuropsychology to mental structure''. Cambridge University Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;  A functional change may involve a lesion, or altered excitability through stimulation, or utilization of the area for another task.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; According to this theory, there is only a finite amount of neural real-estate available for each task. If two tasks share a neural network, there will be competition for the associated neural substrates, and the performance of each task will be inhibited when performed simultaneously.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Using this theory, proponents of the bi-directional hypothesis have postulated that performance of verbal working memory of action words would be impaired by movement of the concordant body part.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; This has been demonstrated with the selective impairment of memorization of arm and leg words when coupled with arm and leg movements, respectively.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; This implies that the neural network for verbal working memory is specifically tied to the motor systems associated with the body part implied with the word.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; This semantic topography has been suggested to provide evidence that action language shares a neural network with sensorimotor systems, thereby supporting the bi-directional hypothesis of language and action.

In [[ecology]] and [[Earth science]], a '''biogeochemical cycle''' or '''substance turnover''' or '''cycling of substances''' is a pathway by which a [[chemical substance]] moves through biotic ([[biosphere]]) and abiotic ([[lithosphere]], [[atmosphere]], and [[hydrosphere]]) compartments of [[Earth]]. There are biogeochemical cycles for carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and water; and there are human-induced cycles such as those for mercury and atrazine. In some cycles there are ''reservoirs'' where a substance remains for a long period of time (such as an ocean or lake for water).

== Systems ==
[[Image:Plagiomnium affine laminazellen.jpeg|thumb|250px|[[Chloroplasts]] conduct [[photosynthesis]] and are found  in [[plant cell]]s and other [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] organisms. These are Chloroplasts visible in the cells of ''Plagiomnium affine'' — Many-fruited Thyme-moss.]]
Ecological systems ([[ecosystem]]s) have many biogeochemical cycles operating as a part of the system, for example the water cycle, the carbon cycle, the nitrogen cycle, etc.
All chemical elements occurring in organisms are part of biogeochemical cycles. In addition to being a part of living organisms, these chemical elements also cycle through abiotic factors of ecosystems such as water ([[hydrosphere]]), land ([[lithosphere]]), and/or the air ([[atmosphere]]).&lt;ref name="enviroliteracy.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Biogeochemical Cycles|url=http://www.enviroliteracy.org/subcategory.php/198.html|publisher=The Environmental Literacy Council|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The living factors of the planet can be referred to collectively as the biosphere. All the nutrients—such as [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], [[phosphorus]], and [[sulfur]]—used in ecosystems by living organisms are a part of a ''closed system''; therefore, these chemicals are recycled instead of being lost and replenished constantly such as in an open system.&lt;ref name="enviroliteracy.org"/&gt; 

The flow of energy in an ecosystem is an ''open system''; the sun constantly gives the planet energy in the form of light while it is eventually used and lost in the form of heat throughout the [[trophic level]]s of a food web.  Carbon is used to make carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, the major sources of [[food energy]].  These compounds are oxidized to release carbon dioxide, which can be captured by plants to make organic compounds.  The [[chemical reaction]] is powered by the light energy of the sun.

It is possible for an ecosystem to obtain energy without sunlight.  Carbon must be combined with hydrogen and oxygen in order to be utilized as an energy source, and this process depends on sunlight.  Ecosystems in the [[deep sea]], where no sunlight can penetrate, use sulfur.  [[Hydrogen sulfide]] near [[hydrothermal vent]]s can be utilized by organisms such as the [[giant tube worm]].  In the [[sulfur cycle]], sulfur can be forever recycled as a source of energy.  Energy can be released through the [[oxidation]] and [[redox|reduction]] of sulfur compounds (e.g., oxidizing elemental sulfur to [[sulfite]] and then to [[sulfate]]).

Although the Earth constantly receives energy from the sun, its chemical composition is essentially fixed, as additional matter is only occasionally added by meteorites. Because this chemical composition is not replenished like energy, all processes that depend on these chemicals must be recycled. These cycles include both the living biosphere and the nonliving lithosphere, atmosphere, and hydrosphere.

== Reservoirs ==
[[Image:Coal anthracite.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Coal is a reservoir of [[carbon]].]]

The chemicals are sometimes held for long periods of time in one place. This place is called a ''reservoir'', which, for example, includes such things as [[coal]] deposits that are storing [[carbon]] for a long period of time.&lt;ref name="carbon"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baedke|first1=Steve J.|last2=Fichter|first2=Lynn S.|title=Biogeochemical Cycles: Carbon Cycle|url=http://csmgeo.csm.jmu.edu/geollab/idls/carboncycle.htm|website=Supplimental Lecture Notes for Geol 398|publisher=James Madison University|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When chemicals are held for only short periods of time, they are being held in ''exchange pools''. Examples of exchange pools include plants and animals.&lt;ref name="carbon" /&gt;  

Plants and animals utilize carbon to produce carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, which can then be used to build their internal structures or to obtain energy.  Plants and animals temporarily use carbon in their systems and then release it back into the air or surrounding medium.  Generally, reservoirs are abiotic factors whereas exchange pools are biotic factors. Carbon is held for a relatively short time in plants and animals in comparison to coal deposits. The amount of time that a chemical is held in one place is called its ''[[residence time]]''.&lt;ref name="carbon" /&gt;

== Important cycles ==

The most well-known and important biogeochemical cycles are shown below:
&lt;gallery class="center" widths="180" heights="150"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
There are many biogeochemical cycles that are currently being studied for the first time as [[climate change]] and human impacts are drastically changing the speed, intensity, and balance of these relatively unknown cycles. These newly studied biogeochemical cycles include 
* the [[mercury cycle]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mercury Cycling in the Environment|url=http://wi.water.usgs.gov/mercury/mercury-cycling.html|website=Wisconsin Water Science Center|publisher=United States Geological Survey|date=10 January 2013|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 
* the human-caused cycle of [[atrazine]], which may affect certain species.

Biogeochemical cycles always involve hot equilibrium states: a balance in the cycling of the element between compartments. However, overall balance may involve compartments distributed on a global scale.

As biogeochemical cycles describe the movements of substances on the entire globe, the study of these is inherently multidisciplinary.  The carbon cycle may be related to research in [[ecology]] and [[atmospheric sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McGuire|first=1A. D. |last2=Lukina|first2=N.

A '''biological oxidizer''' is a device that uses [[micro-organisms]] to treat [[wastewater]] and the [[volatile organic compound]]s produced by commercial and industrial operations. Biological oxidation devices convert [[biodegradable]] organic compounds into [[carbon dioxide]] and [[water]]. This is a natural occurring process which differs from traditional [[chemical]] and [[thermal]] oxidizing agents and methods. Some of the more commonly used micro-organisms are [[Heterotroph|heterotrophic bacteria]], which play an important role in biological degradation processes. Generally, these micro-organisms are rod shaped and [[facultative]]. Biological oxidizers provide a stable environment which allows bacteria to naturally oxidize and stabilize a large number of organics in a more efficient manner. Some of the emissions that may be treated biologically include:

* [[heterocyclic compounds]] (such as [[quinoline]] or [[pyridine]]);
* [[polyaromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs);
* pharmaceutical substances;
* [[polychlorinated biphenyls]];
* [[hydrocarbons]] (oil);
* [[benzene]], [[toluene]], [[ethylbenzene]], and [[xylene]] (BETEX);

The prompt removal of a wide range of wastes and pollutants from the environment is the foremost requisite leading to minimal negative [[Environment (biophysical)|environmental]] impact and [[sustainability]]. [[Microorganism]]s offer excellent anabolic and catabolic adaptability to degrade and produce stabilized organic matters from contaminants. [[Microbiology]] is providing significant views of regulatory metabolic pathways as well as effectiveness to adaption and biological degradation in our changing environment.

==Biological destruction mechanism of hazardous air pollutants==
[[File:Biological Oxidizer Capture Module.jpg|thumb|Biological oxidizer capture module]]
Micro-organisms are utilized in biological remediation to control industrial and commercial [[vapor]] [[effluent]]s. When utilizing biological oxidation systems for the remediation emissions, the off gases or vapors are passed through a packed bed having a thin biological film at the surface. The micro-organisms are immobilized into the thin biological film, as the vapor passes over the film they become attached and are oxidized or stabilized.

The biological film accomplishes the [[Biodegradation|degradation]] process, as the biological sump water is reprocessed over the biomedia it creates additional biological growth and as the film increases so does the biological oxidizers efficiency.

Large surface area and footprint were once required to treat waste water vapor and industrial plant emissions, with the advent of advanced biological oxidation equipment a smaller footprint is required. The footprint will typically occupy the same space as conventional [[thermal oxidizer]]s.

==Biological controls==

Excessive formation of the biological film may lead to certain problems such as sloughing, it is an important factor to maintain optimum biological film. Maintaining the biological film is accomplished by proper moisture content. For this purpose the humidity of the air is adjusted within the reaction chamber before the vapor flows over the packing media. The biological packing media may be natural or made of synthetic [[plastic]]. Recirculation of the water is always completed in the biological oxidation system to make the system more cost-effective. [[Biochemical oxygen demand]] (BOD) indirectly measures the amount of easily biodegradable organic matters thus very low values indicate direct waste water disposal.

The prompt removal of a wide range of wastes and pollutants from the waste gas flow is the foremost requirement of biological oxidizers to meet regulatory permitting requirements. [[Micro-organism]]s differ in their ability to rapidly metabolize different pollutants, so the selection of the proper mix of organisms is critical. [[Research]] is underway to genetically modify various organisms to improve their performance in biological oxidation.

==Benefits of biological oxididation==
[[File:Biological Oxidation System.jpg|thumb|Biological oxidation system]]
Biological oxidation of organic matters has led to the innovation of a low cost secondary treatment of the waste water emissions and industrial air emissions. The process of [[biodegradation]] offers a very fast method which typically offers 4,000 catalytic cycles per minute. Destruction rate efficiency is generally greater than 99% on most biodegratable organics emissions. The Biological oxidation technology is free from secondary emissions (NOx) with limited CO2 production. While other oxidation technologies such as [[thermal oxidation]] produces CO, NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

==List of Manufacturers==
The following manufacturers have been involved in the development, design and planning of waste gas purification systems for a wide range of industries: Global manufacture of turnkey systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6429">A '''blended space''' is a space in which a physical environment and a virtual environment are deliberately integrated in a close knit way. The aim of blended space design is to provide people with the experience of feeling a sense of presence in the blended space, acting directly on the content of the blended space.&lt;ref name ="SoI"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Benyon|first1=David|title=Spaces of Interaction, Places for Experience|date=2014|publisher=Morgan and Claypool|isbn=9781608457724|page=97|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="presencePaper"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Benyon|first1=David|title=Presence in Blended Spaces|journal=Interacting with Computers|date=July 2012|volume=24|issue=4|pages=219–226|doi=10.1016/j.intcom.2012.04.005|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2371818.2371889}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of blended spaces include augmented reality devices such as the [[Microsoft HoloLens|Microsoft Hololens]] and games such as [[Pokémon Go|Pokemon GO]] in addition to many smartphone tourism apps, smart meeting rooms and applications such as bus tracker systems.

== History ==
The idea of blending comes  from the ideas of conceptual integration, or [[conceptual blending]] introduced by [[Gilles Fauconnier]] and [[Mark Turner (cognitive scientist)|Mark Turner]]. Originally focused on understanding linguistic expressions, the simple but powerful ideas of blending have been applied to many areas as detailed on Mark Turner's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://markturner.org/blending.html|title=BLENDING AND CONCEPTUAL INTEGRATION|website=markturner.org|access-date=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creative thought arises from bringing together concepts from two input spaces. These spaces have some correspondences with each other and share a structure with a more generic space. The blended space takes a partial mapping of the concepts and structure of the two input spaces to provide a new structure that demonstrates properties not possessed by either of the input spaces. Fauconnier and Turner provide many examples of blends in their book along with descriptions of different types of blend (reflecting different types of projections from the two input spaces). They also provide guidance for creating  blends that are effective "at the human scale".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The way we think: conceptual blending and the mind's hidden complexities|last=Fauconnier and Turner|first=Gilles and Mark|publisher=Basic Books|year=2002|isbn=0-465-08786-8|location=New York, NY|pages=309–353}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manuel Imaz and David Benyon introduced blending theory to look at concepts in software engineering and human-computer interaction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Describing spaces ==
[[File:BlendedSpacesImage.JPG|thumb|Conceptual Blending in Mixed Reality Spaces]]
There are two main components to any space. They are:
#'''Objects''' – The actual distinct objects which make up the medium/space. The objects thus effectively describe the space. 
#'''Agents''' – Correspondents/users inside the space who interact with it through the objects.&lt;ref name="SoI" /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For presence in a blended space, there must be a physical space and a digital space. In the context of blended space, the higher the communication between the physical and digital spaces, the richer the experience.&lt;ref name="SoI" /&gt; This communication happens through the medium of correspondents which relay the state and nature of objects.
&lt;br /&gt;
For the purpose of looking at blended spaces, the nature and characteristics of any space can be represented by these factors:
# Ontology – Different types of objects present in the space the total number of objects and the relationships between objects and the space.
# Topology – The way objects are placed and positioned.
# Volatility – Frequency with which the objects change.
# Agency – Medium of communication between the objects, and between the objects and users. Agency also encompasses the users inside the space.

&lt;br /&gt;'''Physical Space''' – Physical spaces are spaces which afford spatial interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Dourish|first1=Paul|title=Implications for Design|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1124855|website=dl.acm.org|publisher=SIGHCI|doi=10.1145/1124772.1124855|conference=Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of spatial interaction greatly impacts the user's cognitive model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buxton|first1=Bill|chapter=Mediaspace – Meaningspace – Meetingspace|chapterurl=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-84882-483-6_13|website=www.springer.com/us/|publisher=Springer|title=Media Space 20 + Years of Mediated Life|doi=10.1007/978-1-84882-483-6_13|isbn=978-1-84882-482-9|pp= 217–231|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;'''Digital Space''' – Digital space (also called the information space) consists of all the information content. This content can be in any form.&lt;ref name="designPaper"&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Benyon|first1=David|title=Designing Blended Spaces|url=http://ewic.bcs.org/upload/pdf/ewic_hci12_althci_paper1.pdf|website=dl.acm.org|publisher=BCS-HCI|conference=BCS-HCI '12 Proceedings of the 26th Annual BCS Interaction Specialist Group Conference on People and Computers|year=2012|pages=398–403}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
The simplest implementation of a blended space requires two features. The first required feature is input. The input can range from tactile, to changes in the environment. The next required feature is notifications received from the digital spaces.
The correspondences between the physical and digital space have to be abstracted and exploited by the design of the blended space. Seamless integration of both the spaces is rare. Blended spaces need anchoring points or technologies to link the spaces.&lt;ref name ="presencePaper" /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; A well designed blended space advertises and conveys the digital content in a subtle and unobtrusive way. Presence can be measured using physiological, behavioral, and subjective measures derived from the space.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Benyon|first1=David|last2=Imaz|first2=Manuel|title=Designing with blends|date=2007|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass. &amp; London|isbn=9780262090421|pages=209–218|edition=1|url=http://researchrepository.napier.ac.uk/1777/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6973">'''Cancer slope factors''' (CSF) are used to estimate the risk of [[cancer]] associated with exposure to a [[carcinogen]]ic or potentially carcinogenic substance. A slope factor is an upper bound, approximating a 95% [[confidence limit]], on the increased cancer risk from a lifetime exposure to an agent by [[ingestion]] or [[inhalation]]. This estimate, usually expressed in units of proportion (of a population) affected per mg of substance/kg [[body weight]]-day, is generally reserved for use in the low-dose region of the [[dose-response relationship]], that is, for exposures corresponding to risks greater than 1 in 100.&lt;ref name="IRIS"&gt;http://www.epa.gov/iris/help_ques.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Slope factors are also referred to as cancer potency factors (PF).

==Toxicity Assessments for Carcinogenic Effects==

For carcinogens, it is commonly assumed that a small number of molecular events may evoke changes in a single cell that can lead to uncontrolled cellular proliferation and eventually to a clinical diagnosis of cancer.  This [[toxicity]] of carcinogens is referred to as being "non-threshold" because there is believed to be essentially no level of exposure that does not pose some probability of producing a carcinogenic response, therefore, there is no dose that can be considered to be risk-free. However, some (non-genotoxic) carcinogens may exhibit a threshold whereby doses lower than the threshold do not invoke a carcinogenic response. 

When evaluating cancer risks of genotoxic carcinogens, theoretically an effect threshold cannot be estimated.  For [[chemical]]s that are carcinogens, a two-part evaluation to quantify risk is often employed in which the substance first is assigned a weight-of-evidence classification, and then a ''slope factor'' is calculated.&lt;ref name ="RAGS"&gt;http://www.epa.gov/oswer/riskassessment/ragsa/pdf/ch7.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generating a Slope Factor==

When the chemical is a known or probable human carcinogen, a toxicity value that defines quantitatively the relationship between dose and response (i.e., the slope factor) is calculated.  Because risk at low exposure levels is difficult to measure directly either by animal experiments or by [[Epidemiology|epidemiologic studies]], the development of a slope factor generally entails applying a model to the available ''[[data set]]'' and using the model to extrapolate from the relatively high doses administered to experimental animals (or the exposures noted in epidemiologic studies) to the lower exposure levels expected for human contact in the environment.&lt;ref name="RAGS" /&gt;

==Data Sets==

High-quality human data (e.g. high quality epidemiological studies) on carcinogens are preferable to animal data. When human data are limited, the most sensitive species is given the greatest emphasis.  Occasionally, in situations where no single study is judged most appropriate, yet several studies collectively support the estimate, the [[geometric mean]] of estimates from all studies may be adopted as the slope.  This practice ensures the inclusion of all relevant data.&lt;ref name="RAGS" /&gt;

==Weight-of-Evidence Classification for Carcinogens==

Slope factors are typically calculated for potential carcinogens in classes A, B1, and B2.  Quantitative estimation of slope factors for the chemicals in class C proceeds on a case-by-case basis. The slope factor is used in risk assessments to estimate an upper-bound lifetime probability of an individual developing cancer as a result of exposure to a   particular level of a potential carcinogen.  Slope  factors should always be accompanied by the ''weight of-evidence'' classification to indicate the strength of the evidence that the agent is a human carcinogen.&lt;ref name="RAGS" /&gt;

* A = Human carcinogen
* B1 = indicates that limited human data are available.
* B2 = indicates sufficient evidence in animals and inadequate or no evidence in humans.
* C = Possible human carcinogen
* D = Not classifiable as to human carcinogenicity
* E = Evidence of non-carcinogenicity for humans

==Calculation of Cancer Risk==
For each age interval "i", the cancer risk for exposure by a specified pathway is computed as:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/oswer/riskassessment/sghandbook/riskcalcs.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\text{Risk}_i = C \cdot \frac{IR_i \cdot EF_i \cdot ED_i}{BW_i \cdot AT} \cdot SF \cdot ADAF_i
&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
:C = Concentration of the chemical in the contaminated environmental medium (soil or water) to which the person is exposed. The units are mg/kg for soil and mg/L for water.
:IR&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = Intake rate of the contaminated environmental medium for age bin "i". The units are kg/day for soil and L/day for water.
:BW&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = Body weight of the exposed person for age bin "i".
:EF&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = Exposure frequency for age bin "i" (days/year). This describes how often a person is exposed to the contaminated medium over the course of a typical year.
:ED&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = Exposure duration for age bin "i" (years). This describes how long a person is exposed to the contaminated medium over the course of their lifetime.
:AT = Averaged time, in days. This term specifies the length of time over which the average dose is calculated. For quantifying cancer risk a "lifetime" of 70 years is used (i.e, 70 years times 365 days/year).
:SF = Cancer slope factor (mg/kg-day)&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;
:ADAF = Age-dependant adjustment factor for age bin "i" (unitless)

==Risk Specific Dose (RSD)==

The '''Cancer Slope Factor''' is used to derive the Risk Specific Dose (RSD)(mg/kg-day) for direct-acting carcinogenic agents, those that cause chemical changes ([[mutation]]s) in [[DNA]].  It is also the default choice for carcinogens when there are insufficient data to demonstrate that the mode of action of the chemical is nonlinear.  The RSD is often calculated based on a one-in-a-million extra risk (10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; risk) or a one-in-a-hundred-thousand risk (10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; risk) for other-than highly exposed individuals.  The term "extra" in the definition of the RSD refers to a risk from environmental exposure to the chemical of interest above the background risk that is always present.&lt;ref&gt;http://water.epa.gov/learn/training/wacademy/health_page15.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

The formula to calculate the RSD for a chemical based on a one-in-a-million extra risk (10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; risk) is:  RSD = 0.000001 / CSF

==Potency Factor==
The CSF is also called a "potency factor" and is used to calculate the Incremental Lifetime Cancer Risk by multiplying the CSF by the chronic daily intake (CDI).  The CDI is the dose over a lifetime and is expressed in mg/kg-day.&lt;ref&gt;Environmental law, policy, and economics: reclaiming the environmental agenda By Nicholas Askounes Ashford, Charles C. Caldart (Page 87)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9506">'''Contact calls''' are seemingly haphazard sounds made by many social animals (such as a chicken's cluck).&lt;ref&gt;Macedonia, J. (1986). Individuality in the contact call of the ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta). American Journal of Primatology, 11, 163-179&lt;/ref&gt; Contact calls are unlike other calls (such as alarm calls) in that they are not usually widely used, conspicuous calls, but rather short exclamations that differ between individuals. Often, the message that the call is meant to convey is specific to the individual or group's activity, such as informing other members of the group about one's location while foraging for food.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Proximate-factors-mediating-%22contact%22-calls-in-and-Rendall-Cheney/c68196aa1784d8897fc9f8c402249bffd7791697|title=Proximate factors mediating "contact" calls in adult female baboons (Papio cynocephalus ursinus) and their infants.|last=Rendall|first=Drew|last2=Cheney|first2=Dorothy L.|date=2000|website=undefined|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-14|last3=Seyfarth|first3=Robert M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some social animal species communicate the signal of potential danger by stopping contact calls, without the use of alarm calls. [[Charles Darwin]] wrote about this in relation to wild horse and cattle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Descent of Men | author = Charles Darwin |year = 2004 | publisher = Penguin Books. pg. 123 | location = London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Humming as contact calls==
[[Joseph Jordania]] suggested that human [[Hum (sound)|humming]] could have played a function of contact calls in early human ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;Jordania, J. (2009). Times to Fight and Times to Relax: Singing and Humming at the Beginnings of Human Evolutionary History. Kadmos, 1, 272–277&lt;/ref&gt; According to his suggestion, humans find it distressing to be in full silence (which is a sign of danger for them), and this is why humans who are alone sometimes hum, whistle, talk to themselves, or listen to TV or radio during other activities.

==Birds==
Birds use contact calls in flight to establish location and to keep aware of each other's presence while flying and feeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://birds.about.com/od/c/g/contactcall.htm |title=Contact Call Definition - Bird Contact Calls - Parrot Contact Calls |publisher=Birds.about.com |date=2012-04-09 |accessdate=2012-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For some species, this call consists of a short, high-pitched sound, recognized and duplicated exactly by mates. Some fowl, such as geese,"honk" while in migration to communicate location and proximity to others in their flock.&lt;ref name=Cornell&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birds.cornell.edu/AllAboutBirds/studying/birdsongs/whycall#sound |title=All About Birds : Why Birds Call |publisher=Birds.cornell.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Parapatric speciation|parapatric]] and [[Sympatry|sympatric]] species of birds, where territories of one species may border or overlap with that of another species, the contact calls of each species may [[Divergent evolution|divergently evolve]] to help differentiate one species from that of the other within close proximity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Husemann|first=Martin|last2=Ulrich|first2=Werner|last3=Habel|first3=Jan|date=2014|title=The evolution of contact calls in isolated and overlapping populations of two white-eye congeners in East Africa (Aves, Zosterops)|url=https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2148-14-115|journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology|language=En|volume=14|issue=1|pages=115|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-14-115|issn=1471-2148}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where one species may have little to no variation among the contact calls of distinct allopatric populations, populations with overlapping territories may change their contact call to sound different from the bordering population's. The same variation pattern is seen in certain species of birds, such as the White-eyed Birds (''Zosterops spp.)'' with increasing elevation and longitude/latitude.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

===Warning===
Some species of birds have alarm calls to specifically warn other individuals of predators. The [[black-capped chickadee|Black-capped Chickadee]] warns its kind of the level of threat an approaching predator is by the number of "de"s heard. Its call, ''chick-a-dee-dee-dee'', might indicate more danger than ''chick-a-dee-dee''. Some calls reveal more details about an approaching predator, indicated by the pitch or speed. When there is a threatening enemy in the air, such as a hawk or eagle, the [[Florida scrub jay|Florida Scrub-Jay]] warns other jays to seek cover by using a thin, shrill-like call. In contrast, an approaching predatory feline provokes a low-pitched "scolding" sound, and calls on fellow jays for help in scaring the intruder away.&lt;ref name=Cornell /&gt;

===Comfort===
Parrots kept as pets demonstrate contact calls with their human owners. Parrots make their call to establish that the human is within earshot, and continue to make the call (sometimes growing louder into a scream) until acknowledged. The screaming develops in pet parrots, as well as wild flock, when the animal feels like its needs are not being met because the contact call is not being understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hallander |first=Jane |title=The Communication Link With Our Parrots |url=http://www.parrothouse.com/jh2.html |accessdate=March 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deer==
Deer communicate with contact calls, alarm calls and other calls to signal when they are ready to breed, to feed, to locate others in their group, after they have shed their velvet, to signal frustration, to summon nearby deer and to intimidate unwanted visitors.

==Primates==
[[File:Ringstaartmakis - Ring-tailed Lemur.jpg|thumb|272x272px|A troop of Ring-Tailed Lemurs]]

===Ring-Tailed Lemurs===
A [[ring-tailed lemur]]'s contact call is used heavily to communicate and is classified on the level of excitement the lemur achieves in a situation. When low to moderately excited, the lemur moans; a "meow" is heard when the excitement is raised to a moderate level or when a situation will bring group togetherness. The loudest call occurs when a lemur is separated from its troop, and is recognizable by a distinct "wail."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lang KA|first=Cawthon|title=Primate Factsheets: Ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta) Behavior|url=http://pin.primate.wisc.edu/factsheets/entry/ring-tailed_lemur/behav|accessdate=March 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pygmy Marmosets===
[[Pygmy marmoset|Pygmy marmosets]] have developed a vocal system in which two acoustically different contact calls have been established.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These two different calls allow individual marmosets to identify others within their population. The call an individual uses varies as a response to the call that they've heard. If one of the contact calls is played over a loudspeaker (from a familiar location to the marmoset), the response from a given individual can be predicted, indicating that the calls are used as an identification mechanism of communication. &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Snowdon|first=Charles T.|last2=Cleveland|first2=Jayne|date=1980|title=Individual recognition of contact calls by pygmy marmosets|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S000334728080131X|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=28|issue=3|pages=717–727|doi=10.1016/s0003-3472(80)80131-x|issn=0003-3472|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baboons===
[[Chacma baboon|Chacma]] [[Chacma baboon|Baboons]] have been observed to use contact calls not only as identification tools and locators of members of the group, but also as a way of communicating messages with one another about their status with respect to the main group. Mother baboons can recognize and locate the contact calls or barks of her offspring when they venture to [[Foraging|forage]] or explore independently, such as to be able to find them if they get lost and need help finding their way back. The mother never barks back, unless she is in danger of being separated from the group (i.e. searching for her offspring will lead her too far astray from the group as it moves across the terrain). In this case, she will venture out slightly in the direction of the calling infant and bark back intermittently to let the lost baboon track her voice down and make its way back to the group.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The '''Doctor of Social Work''' (DSW) is a [[professional doctorate]] in [[social work]], most often offering advanced training in a professional area of practice including but not limited to; [[nonprofit organization]], [[leadership development]], and [[social justice]]. The DSW usually focuses on clinical practice or nonprofit administration. The DSW is related to, but also distinct from the more traditional [[PhD]], which is a more research-oriented degree for social workers who wish primarily to further their careers in academia or research settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Social Work Doctoral Programs |url=https://socialworklicensure.org/social-worker-education/social-work-doctoral-programs/ |website=SocialWorkLicensure.org |accessdate=November 10, 2018 |language=English |quote=There are two types of social work doctorate: the DSW and the PhD. The Doctor of Social Work or DSW has traditionally been considered a practice doctorate, as opposed to a research degree. It’s the newer degree, but it’s actually far from new. The first DSW programs came into being in the 1940’s – when today’s retirees were mere children.  There is a difference between DSW and PhD programs… sometimes. The title of the degree may have as much to do with its history as its current requirements. Each degree has had times in history when it was favored. If a school offers both degrees, one can expect the PhD to be the research-heavy one.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although different schools vary in the extent to which they emphasize each, both DSW and PhD candidates in the field of social work gain experience in education, advanced practice, teaching, supervision, research, policy analysis, administration and/or program development. As with other doctorates, a holder of a DSW is referred to using the formal title of 'doctor'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url= https://socialworklicensure.org/social-worker-education/social-work-doctoral-programs/
 |title= Social Work Doctoral Programs
 |access-date= October 12, 2018
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals who hold the '''Doctor of Social Work''' work in a variety of fields and disciplines that coincide with that of [[social work]] including [[higher education]], [[health care administration]] and [[nonprofit organization]]. 

==History of the DSW degree==
Although the first doctoral degrees that were offered in the field of social work were that of PhD's, in late 1940's the '''Doctor of Social Work''' program emerged, with some of the earliest DSW degrees having been offered at [[University of Pennsylvania]] and [[Smith College]]. Some institutions that originally offered PhD programs in Social Work later converted to the DSW professional doctorate degree due to growing and improving trends in social work and in academia. 

By the 1960's and 1970's, doctoral degrees for social work increased significantly. By the early 1970's, many universities began only offering the DSW professional doctorate, surpassing that of the PhD degree in social work that was originally offered at many competing institutions. 

Over the years, great confusion lied between the PhD and the DSW with many holders of the DSW entering research based positions within higher education. Seeing that the DSW is a professional practice based doctorate, many institutions slowly began to remove the DSW from their curriculum in an effort to promote research education within the discipline. 

With many social workers and allied health professionals pursuing clinical practice based doctoral degrees in other disciplines including education, nursing, psychology, physical therapy and nutrition, the discussion to promote the DSW degree was slowly placed at the forefront. 

Understanding that not all practice based doctorates should be solely focused on advanced clinical practice, the DSW was emerged as an advanced practice [[professional doctorate]]. 

Having being an advanced practice doctoral degree, the Doctor of Social Work is an important development in community based social services encompassing components in education, social justice, social welfare and policy development/analysis. 

Holders of this degree are expected to work in a variety of fields and arenas in social service agencies, health and mental health care institutions, higher education and academia, and community service organizations.

==Time frame==

The typical time frame for completion of a Doctor of Social Work is 3 to 4 years after earning a master's degree. Some institutions however, offer an advanced alternative to the degree for those with prior knowledge and experience in social work and furthermore, for holders with other social work oriented degrees.

==Admission==

Admission to a Doctor of Social Work program in the USA is highly competitive. Typically, institutions require applicants to hold a master's degree. Applicants may also hold a MSW degree from a Council on Social Work Education (CSWE) accredited program or a related degree including but not limited to [[Master of Public Administration]] (MPA), [[Master of Public Health]] (MPA),  [[Master of Arts in Education]] (MAEd), [[Master of Science in Nursing]] (MSN), [[Master of Public Policy]] (MPP) and the [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA).

[[File:Everybody Draw Mohammed Day.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Cartoon, "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day!"]]

'''Everybody Draw Mohammed Day''' (or '''Draw Mohammed Day''') was a 2010 event in support of artists threatened with violence for drawing [[Depictions of Muhammad|representations of the Islamic prophet Muhammad]]. It stemmed from a protest against [[censorship]] of the American television show ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[201 (South Park)|201]]", led by the show's distributor [[Comedy Central]], in response to death threats that had been made against some of those responsible for two segments broadcast in April 2010. A drawing representing [[Mohammed]] was posted on the Internet on April 20, 2010, with a message suggesting that "everybody" create a drawing depicting Mohammad on May 20 in support of free speech.

U.S. [[cartoon]]ist Molly Norris of [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] created the artwork in reaction to Internet death threats that had been made against animators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] for depicting Muhammad in an episode of ''[[South Park]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4674864.stm |title =Q&amp;A: Depicting the Prophet Muhammad |publisher =BBC News |date =February 2, 2006 |accessdate=February 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Postings on RevolutionMuslim.com (under the pen name  Abu Talha al-Amrikee; later identified as [[Zachary Adam Chesser]]) had said that Parker and Stone could wind up like [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]], a Dutch filmmaker who was stabbed and shot to death.&lt;ref name="Theo van Gogh murder"&gt;{{cite news|title=Life of slain Dutch film-maker|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3975211.stm|accessdate=May 22, 2012|newspaper=[[BBC]]|date=November 2, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Norris claimed that, if people draw pictures of Muhammad, [[Islamic terrorism|radical Islamist terrorists]] would not be able to murder them all, and threats to do so would become unrealistic. Within a week, Norris' idea became popular on [[Facebook]], was supported by numerous [[bloggers]], and generated coverage on the blog websites of major U.S. newspapers. As the publicity mounted, Norris and the man who created the first Facebook page promoting the May 20 event disassociated themselves from it. Nonetheless, planning for the protest continued with others "taking up the cause".&lt;ref name="erases"/&gt; Facebook had an "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day" page, which grew to over 100,000 participants (101,870 members by May 20). A protest page on Facebook against the initiative named "Against ‘Everybody Draw Mohammed Day'" attracted slightly more supporters (106,000 by May 20).&lt;ref name=figure/&gt; Subsequently, Facebook was temporarily blocked by Pakistan; the ban was lifted after Facebook agreed to block the page for users in India and Pakistan.

In the media, Everybody Draw Mohammed Day attracted support from commentators who felt that the campaign represented important issues of freedom of speech, and the need to stand up for this freedom.

===Background===
''[[South Park]]'' episodes "[[200 (South Park)|200]]" and "[[201 (South Park)|201]]", broadcast in April 2010, featured a character in a bear costume, who various other characters stated was Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last =James | first = Frank |author2=Mark Memmott | title = Facebook Blocked By Pakistani Court For 'Draw Muhammad' Day | work =[[National Public Radio]]: The two-way | publisher = www.npr.org | date = May 19, 2010 | url = https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2010/05/facebook_blocked_by_pakistani.html | accessdate =May 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''South Park'' episode sparked statements from the extremist website [[Revolution Muslim]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Bates | first = Theunis | title = Pakistan Bans Facebook Over Muhammad Cartoons | work = AOL News | language =  | publisher = www.aolnews.com | date = May 19, 2010 | url = http://www.aolnews.com/world/article/pakistan-bans-facebook-over-muhammad-cartoons/19483123 | accessdate = May 19, 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100520033044/http://www.aolnews.com/world/article/pakistan-bans-facebook-over-muhammad-cartoons/19483123 | archivedate = May 20, 2010 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last =Rodriguez | first =Alex | title = Facebook dark in Pakistan amid uproar over Muhammad caricatures|work=Los Angeles Times | publisher = www.latimes.com | date = May 19, 2010 | url = http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-pakistan-facebook-20100520,0,4071401.story | accessdate =May 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which posted a picture of the partially decapitated body of the Dutch filmmaker, [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]], with a statement declaring that Parker and Stone could meet a similar fate. The group running the website said it was not threatening Parker and Stone, however, it also posted the addresses of Comedy Central's New York office and the California production studio where ''South Park'' is made.&lt;ref name=jgscl&gt;{{Cite news| last = Griswold | first =Jamie ([[Associated Press]]) | title =Seattle cartoonist launches 'Everybody Draw Mohammed Day' | work =MyNorthwest.com | publisher = Bonneville International | date = April 25, 2010 | url = http://www.mynorthwest.com/?nid=11&amp;sid=313170# | accessdate =May 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Comedy Central]] [[self-censored]] the episode when it was broadcast by removing the word "Muhammad" and a speech about intimidation and fear from the ''South Park'' episode.&lt;ref name=jgscl/&gt;

===Molly Norris cartoon===
Molly Norris drew the original, poster-like cartoon on April 20, 2010, which declared May 20, 2010, to be the first annual "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day". The drawing showed various [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]] objects, including a coffee cup, a cherry and a box of pasta, each claiming to be the likeness of Muhammad. Norris used an alternate [[transliteration]] of "Mohammed" on her poster.&lt;ref name=jotcoelat&gt;Orr, Jimmy, [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2010/04/creators-of-everybody-draw-muhammad-day-abandon-effort-after-it-becomes-controversial.html "Creators of 'Everybody Draw Muhammad Day' drop gag after everybody gets angry"], April 26, 2010, "Top of the Ticket" blog, ''Los Angeles Times''. Retrieved April 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Across the top of the illustration she wrote: {{quote|text=In light of the recent veiled (ha!) threats aimed at the creators of the television show South Park ... by bloggers on Revolution Muslim's website, we hereby deem May 20, 2010 as the first 'Everybody Draw Mohammed Day!'

In late April, after she had rejected the idea for the May 20 protest, Norris stated on her website: "This was always a drawing about rights, never MEANT to disrespect religion. Alas – if we don't have rights, we will not be able to practice the religion of our choice. [...] None of these little characters ARE the likeness of Mohammed, they are just CLAIMING to be!"

===Cartoonist and Facebook page creator end involvement===
On April 25, Norris wrote on her website that the response to her idea had surprised and shocked her: "I did not intend for my cartoon to go [[Viral phenomenon|viral]]. I did not intend to be the focus of any 'group'. I practice the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] by drawing what I wish. This particular cartoon of a 'poster' seems to have struck a gigantic nerve, something I was totally unprepared for. I am going back to the drawing table now!"&lt;ref name=mnwco/&gt;&lt;ref name="howardfriedman" /&gt; On April 26, she wrote on her website: "I am NOT involved in "Everybody Draw Mohammd [''[[sic]]'' ] Day! I made a cartoon that went viral and I am not going with it. Many other folks have used my cartoon to start sites, etc. Please go to them as I am a private person who draws stuff".&lt;ref name=jotcoelat/&gt; She also asked Savage to replace the original illustration she had given him with another one she drew that was tamer, but Savage refused. Asked why she initially publicized it, she replied, "Because I'm an idiot."&lt;ref name=jotcoelat/&gt;

Norris said the campaign had grown much bigger than she initially intended, and that her cartoon was being used in ways she couldn't control. "I just want to go back to my quiet life", she told the writer of a blog about comics at ''[[The Washington Post]]''.&lt;ref name=mcpspc/&gt; Wellington announced on April 26 that he, too, was dropping out of the movement. "I am aghast that so many people are posting deeply offensive pictures of the Prophet," he wrote.&lt;ref name=jotcoelat/&gt;&lt;ref name="rickmoran" /&gt; "Y'all go ahead if that's your bag, but count me out."&lt;ref name=jotcoelat/&gt;&lt;ref name="rickmoran"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Moran | first =Rick | title = A Lesson for our Post-Modern Media Environment | work = The Moderate Voice | publisher = Newstex | date = April 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Norris acknowledged, "I said that I wanted to counter fear and then I got afraid."&lt;ref name="erases" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title =The PM wrestles with greatest non-core moral issue of the election after next |work=The Australian | publisher = www.theaustralian.com.au | date = April 27, 2010 | url =http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/opinion/the-pm-wrestles-with-greatest-non-core-moral-issue-of-the-election-after-next/story-e6frg6zo-1225859056591 | accessdate =May 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 29, Norris suggested that "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day" be called off: "Let's call off 'Everybody Draw Mohammed Day' by changing it to 'Everybody Draw Al Gore Day' instead. Enough Mohammed drawings have already been made to get the point across. At this juncture, such drawings are only hurtful to more liberal and moderate Muslims who have not done anything to endanger our first amendment rights."&lt;ref&gt;Cavna, Michael, [http://voices.washingtonpost.com/comic-riffs/2010/04/apologetic_draw_muhammad_carto.html "Apologetic 'Draw Muhammad' cartoonist urges 'Draw Al Gore' instead [VIDEO&amp;#93;"], 8:38 a.m. update of a 1 a.m. post, April 30, 2010, retrieved same day&lt;/ref&gt; On May 1, Norris posted a marked up version of her original cartoon, apologizing to Muslims.&lt;ref name=posterdescribed/&gt;

Norris' change in position received varying reactions from commentators. [[Kathleen Parker]], an opinion columnist for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', wrote, "Norris's cartoon was a fine idea, but she should be relieved of further duty or responsibility."&lt;ref name=kpfos&gt;Parker, Kathleen, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/27/AR2010042703813.html?hpid=opinionsbox1 "Freedom of sketch"], opinion article, ''[[The Washington Post]]'', April 27, 2010. Retrieved April 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', Alex Spillius commented, "No one should blame Norris for withdrawing from the fray, for this kind of case throws up lingering and insidious uncertainties. Any threat could blow over quickly or endure, [[The Satanic Verses controversy|Rushdie-style]], for decades.

==Reception==

===Support===
The idea for the May 20 protest received support from [[Kathleen Parker]], an opinion columnist for ''[[The Washington Post]]'': "Americans love their free speech and have had enough of those who think they can dictate the limits of that fundamental right. [...] Draw to any heart's discontent. It's a free country. For now."&lt;ref name=kpfos/&gt; The idea also received support from prominent bloggers and bloggers on prominent websites, such as [[Michael C. Moynihan]] at ''[[Reason magazine|Reason]]'' magazine's "Hit &amp; Run" blog, who encouraged his readers to send him their drawings.&lt;ref name="moynihan423"&gt;Moynihan, Michael C., [http://reason.com/blog/2010/04/23/first-annual-everybody-draw-mo "First Annual Everybody Draw Mohammad Day"], blog post, April 23, 2010, "Hit &amp; Run" blog, ''Reason'' magazine website. Retrieved April 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Moynihan stated he planned to select some of his favorite depictions of Muhammad from the protest movement, and then add them to the Reason.com website.&lt;ref name="moye" /&gt;&lt;ref name="moynihan423" /&gt; Moynihan commented, "In the South Park episode that started all this, Buddha does lines of coke and there was an episode where Cartman started a Christian rock band that sang very homo-erotic songs. Yet there is one religious figure we can't make fun of. The point of the episode that started the controversy is that celebrities wanted Muhammad's power not to be ridiculed. How come non-Muslims aren't allowed to make jokes?"&lt;ref name="moye" /&gt; Moynihan posited that the decision of Comedy Central to enact [[self-censorship]] of the ''South Park'' episode would have the impact of worsening the situation.&lt;ref name="moye" /&gt;

Writing for ''[[The American Spectator]]'', Jeremy Lott commented positively about the protest movement: "While the suits at Comedy Central and Yale University Press have been cowed, people across the country have decided to speak up and thereby magnify the offense a thousandfold."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news  | last =Lott  | first =Jeremy  | title =The Nation's Pulse – The Humorless Veto  | work =[[The American Spectator]]  | date =April 27, 2010  | url =http://spectator.org/archives/2010/04/27/the-humorless-veto  | accessdate =May 3, 2010  | deadurl =yes  | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20100430165343/http://spectator.org/archives/2010/04/27/the-humorless-veto  | archivedate =April 30, 2010  | df =mdy-all  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Helge Rønning, a professor at the Institute of Media and Communication at the [[University of Oslo]], said the offense to Muslims was outweighed by freedom-of-speech concerns. "Indignation from those who claim the right to engage in criticism of religion is as important as the indignation that comes from the Muslim side," he told the  [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation|NRK]] (Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation). "I think that this is an attitude that goes deeper than whether these drawings are blasphemous or not." [[Vebjørn Selbekk]], a Norwegian editor who was threatened in 2006 after he reprinted [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|Danish cartoons of Mohammed]] in his publication, supported the May 20 protest. "I think maybe this is the right way to react—with humor, and also to spread this number, so it isn't only a few who sit with all the threats and all the discomfort associated with defending our freedom of speech in this area," he said.&lt;ref&gt;Vold, Henrik Brattli, [http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/kultur/1.7097202 "Alle skal tegne Muhammed"], article, NRK (Norsk Rikskringkasting AS—[[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]]), April 26, 2010, in Norwegian (Selbekk: "og jeg synes kanskje dette er den riktige måten å reagere på – med humor, og også å spre dette på flere, så det ikke bare er noen få som blir sittende med alle truslene "; Rønning: "Jeg mener nok at indignasjonen fra dem som hevder retten til å drive religionskritikk er like viktig som den indignasjonen som kommer fra den muslimske siden.

===Criticism===
Law professor and blogger [[Ann Althouse]] rejected the Everybody Draw Mohammed Day idea because "depictions of Muhammad offend millions of Muslims who are no part of the violent threats."&lt;ref&gt;Althouse, Ann, [http://althouse.blogspot.com/2010/04/everybody-draw-mohammed-day-is-not-good.html "'Everybody Draw Mohammed Day' is not a good idea."], blog post, April 24, 2010, "Althouse" blog.

In Pakistan, an editorial in ''[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]'', the country's oldest English-language newspaper, said that there was no doubt that the Facebook initiative "was in poor taste and deserving of strong condemnation," adding that it was "debatable whether freedom of expression should extend to material that is offensive to the sensibilities, traditions and beliefs of religious, ethnic or other communities." However, the editorial called the Lahore High Court's decision to block Facebook a "knee-jerk reaction," saying that, "many users feel, and rightly so, that they can decide for themselves what is or is not offensive, and choose not to access material that is repugnant to their beliefs," and that the block might "have played right into the hands of those who think nothing of displaying or publishing material that denigrates their beliefs. By reacting the way we do we only harm ourselves and, in the process, even become a subject of derision."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Staff |title=Facebook furore |work=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] |date=May 21, 2010 |url=http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/the-newspaper/editorial/19-facebook-furore-150-hh-09 |accessdate=May 30, 2010 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524012334/http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/the-newspaper/editorial/19-facebook-furore-150-hh-09 |archivedate=May 24, 2010 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for ''[[Religion Dispatches]]'', Austin Dacey compared the protest movement to [[Martin Luther]], stating, "Forget the ''South Park'' dust up; forget Everybody Draw Muhammad Day. If you want to see truly shocking anti-religious cartoons, you have to go back to the sixteenth century. Near the end of Luther’s life, his propaganda campaign against Rome grew increasingly vitriolic and his language grotesquely pungent."&lt;ref name="austindacey"&gt;{{Cite news| last =Dacey  | first = Austin  | title =  Satire is Religion – The debate over cartoons and prophets is not just about free of speech; it’s about freedom of religion.| work = Religion Dispatches | publisher =www.religiondispatches.org | date = May 12, 2010 | url = http://www.religiondispatches.org/archive/culture/2561/satire_is_religion/ | accessdate = May 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dacey argued, "The debate over cartoon depictions of the Prophet Muhammad is often framed as a clash between free speech and religious attitudes. But it is just as much a clash between ''conflicting'' religious attitudes, and the freedom at stake is not only freedom of expression but freedom of religion. For while Luther was surely engaging in offensive speech, he was also exercising a right of freedom of conscience, which included the right to dissent from Catholic orthodoxy."&lt;ref name="austindacey" /&gt;

In an analysis of the protest movement for the ''[[Daily Bruin]]'', journalist Jordan Manalastas commented, "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day is a chance to reinstate offense and sincerity to their proper place, freed from terror or silence. ... The proper (and, at the risk of looking [[jingoistic]], American) way to combat bad speech is with better speech. To silence and be silenced are the refuge of cowards."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Manalastas | first = Jordan  | title =Cartoonist criticized for creating ‘Everybody Draw Mohammed Day’ should have defended her right to First Amendment  | work = [[Daily Bruin]]  |publisher = www.dailybruin.com, [[University of California, Los Angeles]] | date = May 17, 2010 | url =http://www.dailybruin.com/articles/2010/5/17/cartoonist-criticized-creating-everybody-draw-moha/  | accessdate = May 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an analysis of the protest movement for ''[[Spiked (magazine)|Spiked]]'', [[Brendan O'Neill (journalist)|Brendan O'Neill]] was critical of the concept of "mocking Muhammad," writing, "... these two camps – the Muhammad-knockers and the Muslim offence-takers – are locked in a deadly embrace. Islamic extremists need Western depictions of Muhammad as evidence that there is a new crusade against Islam, while the Muhammad-knockers need the [[flag-burning]], street-stomping antics of the extremists as evidence that their defence of the Enlightenment is a risky, important business."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = O'Neill | first = Brendan | title =Mocking Muhammad: a shallow Enlightenment  | work =[[Spiked (magazine)|Spiked magazine]] | publisher = www.spiked-online.com | date =May 19, 2010  | url = http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/8894#.WDk70orQeUk | accessdate = November 26, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several [[editorial cartoonist]]s quoted by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' blogger Michael Cavna were critical of the Draw Mohammed Day idea or declined to participate, although all supported the right of cartoonists to depict Mohammed if they chose to.&lt;ref name=Cavna20May&gt;Michael Cavna, [http://voices.washingtonpost.com/comic-riffs/2010/05/their_turn_12_top_cartoonists.html THEIR TURN: 12 top cartoonists offer their take on 'Draw Muhammad Day'], ''[[The Washington Post]]'' blog ''Comics Riff'' (May 20, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  The president of the [[Association of American Editorial Cartoonists]] opposed involvement because, "something like that can be too easily co-opted by interest groups who, I suspect, have an agenda that goes beyond a simple defense of free expression."&lt;ref name=Cavna20May/&gt;  Other cartoonists quoted in the article called the event, "childish and needlessly provocative," or demurred because they dislike, "choreographed punditry."&lt;ref name=Cavna20May/&gt;

==Threat on Molly Norris's life, forced into hiding==
On July 11, 2010, it was reported that the Yemeni-American al-Qaeda cleric [[Anwar al-Awlaki]] had put Molly Norris on a hitlist. In the English version of the [[al-Qaeda]] magazine  ''[[Inspire (magazine)|Inspire]],'' Al-Awlaki wrote, "The medicine prescribed by the Messenger of Allah is the execution of those involved," and was quoted as saying, &lt;blockquote&gt;The large number of participants makes it easier for us because there are more targets to choose from in addition to the difficulty of the government offering all of them special protection ... But even then our campaign should not be limited to only those who are active participants.&lt;ref name="hitlist"&gt;{{cite web |first=James Gordon |last=Meek |first2=Katie |last2=Nelson |url =http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/cleric-anwar-al-awlaki-puts-draw-mohammed-cartoonist-molly-norris-execution-hitlist-article-1.464988 |title =Cleric Anwar al-Awlaki puts 'Everybody Draw Mohammed' cartoonist Molly Norris on execution hitlist |publisher =Daily News |date =July 11, 2010 |accessdate=February 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="threat"&gt;{{cite web |first=Joshua Rhett |last=Miller |url =http://www.foxnews.com/world/2010/07/12/death-threats-rattle-everybody-draw-muhammad-day-advocate.html |title ='Everybody Draw Muhammad Day' Advocate Rattled by Death Threats |publisher =Fox News |date =July 12, 2010 |accessdate=February 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[FBI]] officials reportedly notified Norris warning her that they considered it a "very serious threat."&lt;ref name="hitlist" /&gt;&lt;ref name="threat" /&gt;

Norris has since changed her name and gone into hiding.  According to the ''[[Seattle Weekly]]'' (her former employer), this decision was based on "the insistence of top security specialists at the FBI."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattleweekly.com/2010-09-15/news/on-the-advice-of-the-fbi-cartoonist-molly-norris-disappears-from-view/ On the Advice of the FBI, Cartoonist Molly Norris Disappears From View – Page 1 – News – Seattle – Seattle Weekly&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/dannywestneat/2012937189_danny19.html | work=The Seattle Times | first=Danny | last=Westneat | title=Terror threat to Seattle cartoonist should draw response | date=September 18, 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525065818/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/dannywestneat/2012937189_danny19.html | archivedate=May 25, 2012 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/01/08/seattle-cartoonist-still-in-hiding-following-2010-islamist-death-threat/|title=Seattle cartoonist still in hiding following 2010 Islamist death threat|author=Dan Springer|date=8 Jan 2015|work=FoxNews.com}}&lt;br /&gt;* {{cite web|title=Seattle cartoonist still in hiding four years after Islamic fatwa|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/cartoonist-hiding-islamic-death-threat-article-1.2073298|author=Nicole Hensley|date=10 Jan 2015|work=NY Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stelter&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stelter|first1=Brian|title=Cartoonist in Hiding After Death Threats|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/17/us/17cartoon.html|accessdate=15 April 2015|publisher=New York Times|date=16 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The threat against Norris appeared to be renewed when Al Qaeda's ''[[Inspire (magazine)|Inspire]]'' included her in its March 2013 edition with eleven others in a pictorial spread entitled "Wanted: Dead or Alive for Crimes Against Islam," and captioned, "Yes We Can: A Bullet A Day Keeps the Infidel Away."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Dashiell |last=Bennett |url=http://www.theatlanticwire.com/global/2013/03/al-qaeda-most-wanted-list/62673/ |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HtcWUniy?url=http://www.theatlanticwire.com/global/2013/03/al-qaeda-most-wanted-list/62673/ |archivedate=July 5, 2013 |title=Look Who's on Al Qaeda's Most-Wanted List |publisher=The Atlantic Wire |date=March 1, 2013 |accessdate=March 3, 2013 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Daniel |last=Halper |url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/al-qaeda-mag-publishes-wanted-dead-or-alive-list_704904.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HtbXBiy8?url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/al-qaeda-mag-publishes-wanted-dead-or-alive-list_704904.html |archivedate=July 5, 2013 |title=Al Qaeda Mag Publishes 'Wanted: Dead or Alive' List |publisher=The Weekly Standard |date=March 1, 2013 |accessdate=March 3, 2013 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cartoonist [[Charb|Stéphane "Charb" Charbonnier]] was also added to [[Al-Qaeda]]'s most wanted list, along with [[Lars Vilks]] and three ''[[Jyllands-Posten]]'' staff members: [[Kurt Westergaard]], [[Carsten Juste]], and [[Flemming Rose]].&lt;ref name="thewire2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewire.com/global/2013/03/al-qaeda-most-wanted-list/62673/|title=Look Who's on Al Qaeda's Most-Wanted List|author=Dashiell Bennet|date=1 Mar 2013|work=The Wire}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://time.com/3657246/paris-charlie-hebdo-shooting/|title=Paris Police Say 12 Dead After Shooting at Charlie Hebdo|author=Conal Urquhart|work=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/11330505/Murdered-Charlie-Hebdo-cartoonist-was-on-al-Qaeda-wanted-list.html|title=Murdered Charlie Hebdo cartoonist was on al Qaeda wanted list|author=Victoria Ward|work=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''fractional-horsepower motor''' ('''FHP''') is an [[electric motor]] with a rated output power of 746.9 or 746 [[Watt]]s or less. There is no defined minimum output, however, it is generally accepted that a motor with a frame size of less than 35mm square can be referred to as a 'micro-motor'.

The term 'fractional' indicates that the motor often has a power rating smaller than one [[horsepower]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.fractionalhorsepowermotors.com/| title=Fractional Horsepower Motor Manufacturers| accessdate= 25 Aug 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fractional-horsepower electric motors are exempt from the US [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]] and the new EN 60034-30:2009&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cemep.org/index.php?id=53]&lt;/ref&gt; ruling of European directive 2005/32/EC&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/eco_design/directive_2005_32.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; concerning the efficiency classes of low-voltage three-phase [[asynchronous motor]]s.

==History==
The earliest commercially-successful electric motors date back to the latter part of the 19th century when [[Nikola Tesla]] patented his [[induction motor]] in 1888. The development of fractional-[[horsepower]] motors, however, would not have taken place without the push toward urban, and later, rural electrification, using alternating current. Electrification began in cities around 1915, and with electrification, so too came the potential market for washing machines, refrigerators, vacuum cleaners and a host of other commercial appliances. This was recognised by major manufacturers, like Westinghouse and General Electric, who were already in the business of manufacturing large motors for industrial installations. By 1920, over 500,000 fractional-horsepower motors were powering washers and other appliances in America.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond McInnis, A history of the amateur woodworking movement; Appendix 21 http://www.woodworkinghistory.com/appendix_21.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E T Painton Small Electric Motors DC and AC London: Pitman, 1923&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George A Schock, Early History of Baldor Electric Co, 1920-1976. Fort Smith, Arkansas: Baldor Electric Co, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

After the second world war, the demand for FHP motors grew, particularly throughout the consumerist boom of the 1950s and 60's. In 2000, the European FHP market was worth an estimated $4.5 billion with some 300-million units in manufacture.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Frost and Sullivan, European Fractional Horse Power Motors Market, 17 March 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Precision motors==
[[Servo motors]] and [[stepper motors]] are specialist types of fractional-[[horsepower]] [[electric motor]]s usually intended for high-precision or robotics applications. Usually running from a DC supply, when combined with a [[planetary gear]]box can offer accuracies less than 8 arc-minutes (&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;ths&lt;/sup&gt; of a degree, or approx. 2.3 [[milliradian]]s). Due to their specialized nature, however, these types of motors tend to be expensive compared with standard, or general-purpose lower-precision units.

==Applications==
Fractional-horsepower motors are used across a wide range of industries and applications for a variety of motion and compression needs. The largest portion of sales can be attributed to the automotive sector, however, accounting for some 35% of all FHP motor sales,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; driving auxiliary applications such as electric windows, wind-shield wipers, powered seats, wing mirrors, central locking systems, roof openers, and trunk openers. In Europe, the majority of these applications are fulfilled by the industry's largest players: Brose (formerly [[Siemens]]), [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]], and Nidec (formerly Valeo).

The second-largest area of consumption is the field of [[white goods]], and small domestic appliances (approximately 12% of the European market). For example, FHP motors are being used to drive pumps and compressors in refrigerators, coffee machines, and washing machines, and they provide suction in vacuum cleaners and a variety of other switching and motion tasks across the ever-increasing variety of domestic products. Until the recent divestment of its motors interests, [[Electrolux]] was believed to be Europe's largest manufacturer of FHP motors for domestic-appliance applications.

Industrial applications consume a similar number of units to that of domestic products with FHP motors being used across a variety of conveyance and process applications.

Other applications include: pumps &amp; compressors, medical devices, portable tools, office machinery, and [[HVAC]].

'''Franklin University Switzerland''' is a [[Private school|private]] [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts university]] in [[Lugano]], [[Switzerland]]. Founded in 1969, Franklin offers [[Bachelor of Arts]] and [[Master of Science]] degrees accredited by both in Switzerland and in the United States. Prospective American students can apply to Franklin University Switzerland through the [[Common Application]].

==History==
Chartered in 1969, Franklin University Switzerland was born out of the former Fleming College and founded as a non-profit, independent, post-secondary institution under the name of Franklin University Switzerland. The institution is named for [[Benjamin Franklin]], the [[United States]]' first ambassador to [[France]]. It has stressed, since its incarnation, the importance of international studies as the basis for a strong, global education.

Franklin University Switzerland obtained United States accreditation from the Commission on Higher Education of the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools in 1975, confirmed most recently in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.msche.org/institutions_view.asp?idinstitution=232|title=Middle States Commission on Higher Education|author=Info724 Ltd.|publisher=|accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having obtained Swiss program-level accreditation in 2005, Franklin was granted full university institution accreditation by the Swiss University Conference in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cus.ch/wDeutsch/akkreditierung/studiengaenge/index.php|title=Schweizerische Universitätskonferenz - Akkreditierte Studiengänge und Institutionen|author=author|publisher=|accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the only university in the world to be accredited in the United States and Switzerland. Swiss accreditation as a university institution gave Franklin the right to call itself a university in Switzerland. In April 2014, the institution officially changed its name and celebrated its inauguration as Franklin University Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fus.edu/about-franklin/news/907-franklin-celebrates-university-day|title=Franklin Celebrates University Day|publisher=|accessdate=12 April 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141120222658/http://www.fus.edu/about-franklin/news/907-franklin-celebrates-university-day|archivedate=20 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
[[Image:Franklin College Switzerland Main Lawn 2007.jpg|thumb|Franklin University Switzerland, the main campus]]
The main campus (known as Kaletsch Campus), acquired in 1985, is composed of a private villa with attached library, auditorium, and classroom wing, surrounded by a wooded park. In 2005 the university acquired an additional campus nearby (known as North Campus), adding administrative, education, athletic, social and residential capacity. The current campus spans {{convert|5|acre|ha|order=flip|0}}. The Franklin campus is residential, and is on a hillside overlooking the town of [[Lugano]], in the Italian-speaking canton of [[Ticino]], [[Switzerland]].

[[Image:Franklin College Residenza Panera.jpg|thumb|Franklin University Switzerland, Residenza Panera]]

Franklin University Switzerland has nine residence buildings, seven in [[Sorengo]] and two in [[Lugano]].
* Airone is in an old hotel directly between the main campus and North Campus with singles and doubles. All rooms have their own bathrooms and some of which have kitchenettes. The ground floor houses the office of Student Life, and one of the student lounges, the "Falcon's Nest".
* Alba is in Lugano 5–10 minutes from North Campus on the way downtown.
* Ciliegi is directly across via Ponte Tresa from Airone. This is the smallest residence on campus, in apartment-style doubles.
* Leonardo da Vinci (LDV) is on the grounds of North Campus; this is the only all-freshman student dormitory.
* Giardino, nestled below the Sorengo monastery: This residence is mainly multiples (4-6 bedrooms and a shared kitchen) with some triples for freshmen.
* Panera is on the main campus grounds next to the Grotto (one of two dining halls) with apartment-style triples. Each apartment consists of four rooms: a bedroom, bathroom (with bathtub), separate kitchen, and a large common room with three desks and a couch. The Panera Lawn is a common meeting place and hang out for many students, no matter what residence they live in.
* The final two buildings are the as-of-late unnamed New Buildings (A and B) located across via Ponte Tresa from Panera. New Building A has four bedroom apartment-style housing, while New Building B has two, three, four, five, and six bedroom apartments, some of which are two stories. All rooms in both New Buildings have arguably the biggest kitchens on campus with at least one bathroom (with a shower) per two students. New Building B offers a noise-free, substance-free rooming option with an emphasis on healthy living for students.

==Academics==
Franklin's curriculum promotes international awareness and critical thinking, and emphasizes an interdisciplinary and liberal arts perspective. The majority of courses are taught in English, with the exception of language courses, including an upper-level language courses on film, culture and literature. Students must achieve proficiency in Italian, French, Spanish, or German, through fulfilling a three-year language course sequence.

In addition to the language requirement, a core curriculum consisting of Intercultural Competencies (humanities and arts), International Engagement (political science, history and economics) and Social Responsibility (sciences and cultural studies) is at the forefront. A full year's worth of study in these three categories is a requirement. Courses in mathematics and writing are required as well.

The most popular majors at Franklin are International Management, International Relations, Environmental Studies, Communications and Media Studies and International Economics, respectively.&lt;ref name="usnews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/franklin-college-switzerland-CH0001|title=Franklin University Switzerland|work=Best Colleges|publisher=U.S. News and World Report|accessdate=2013-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The average class size at Franklin is 16, with no class exceeding 30 students.

==Academic Travel Program==
The Academic Travel Program is an integrated part of the Franklin University Switzerland curriculum. Academic Travel is a credit-bearing degree requirement, and two weeks of travel each semester represent an extension of the students’ class work.&lt;ref name="ga"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goabroad.com/providers/franklin-college-switzerland/programs/franklin-a-us-college-in-switzerland-4605|title=Franklin - A US College in Switzerland|work=Degree Abroad|publisher=GoAbroad|accessdate=2013-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Travel is led by faculty members and relates to the academic expertise of the individual professor and to his or her knowledge of a given country or area.

All students, including semester and year-abroad students, are required to participate in the Academic Travel Program. Academic Travel is a graduation requirement and an integral component of each semester of study. The graduation requirement for Academic Travel is fulfilled by participating in six travel programs. Students usually fulfill the requirement by participating each semester of their first three years at Franklin. Students who enter with sophomore standing must participate each semester in which they are enrolled except their senior year.

The travels are themed around academic studies relating to the location visited and the professor guiding the travel. Economics, art history, literature, business and marketing, international relations, and history are among common themes investigated through travels.

Academic Travel destinations have included the [[Baltic states]], [[Belgium]], [[Brazil]], [[Croatia]], [[Cyprus]], [[Denmark]], [[England]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Guatemala]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Iceland]], [[India]], [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Malawi]], [[Morocco]], [[Mozambique]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Scotland]], [[Serbia]], [[South Korea]], [[Spain]], [[Switzerland]], [[Turkey]], and the [[United States]].

==Student life==
Student life at Franklin consists of an emphasis on independent travel in [[Switzerland]] and greater [[Europe]], and of student associations, residential life, and interaction with Swiss-Italian culture in Lugano.

==Athletics==
Franklin University Switzerland offers students a wide variety of sports and fitness programs, as well as activities to promote a healthy lifestyle. Some on-campus sports facilities include the Tone Athletic Center, two volleyball courts, a basketball court and a soccer field.  Organized athletic activities include Men's and Women's Soccer, Men's and Women's Basketball, and Lugano Street Dance. Students are also encouraged to start athletic programs. Student-led activities have included Field Hockey, Yoga, Cross-fit, and Self-Defense.

Since 2000-2001 (with an exception of a bye year in 2001-2002)  Franklin's men's soccer team has competed in the National Swiss Division (5th League). The team competes with other clubs in the league from the Canton of [[Ticino]]. Franklin University Switzerland is currently the reserve team for the local club FC Paradiso, making it Franklin FC Paradiso II. In spring 2012 the team won its fourth Fair Play award. The team trains twice a week and competes on the weekends in the fall and spring semesters — home games are played on Friday nights. The players have a mid-season break from December to February.  During this period the school hosts an indoor soccer tournament open to all Franklin students, faculty and staff.

'''Function-Spacer-Lipid (FSL) Kode constructs''' (Kode Technology) are [[Amphiphile|amphiphatic]], water [[wikt:dispersible|dispersible]] biosurface engineering constructs that can be used to engineer the surface of [[cell (biology)|cell]]s, [[virus]]es and organisms, or to modify solutions and non-biological surfaces with bioactives.&lt;ref name="Blake2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Korchagina2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Synthetic glycolipid-like constructs as tools for glycobiology research, diagnostics, and as potential therapeutics|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S0006297915070068|journal = Biochemistry (Moscow)|date = 2015-07-16|issn = 0006-2979|pages = 857–871|volume = 80|issue = 7|doi = 10.1134/S0006297915070068|language = en|first = E.

FSL Kode constructs with all these aforementioned features are also known as Kode Constructs.&lt;ref name="Blake2011" /&gt; The process of modifying surfaces with FSL Kode constructs is known as "koding" and the resultant "koded" [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s,&lt;ref name="Blake2011" /&gt; [[virus]]es and [[liposome]]s are respectively known as [[kodecytes]],&lt;ref name="Blake2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Henry2009" /&gt; and [[kodevirions]]&lt;ref name="Blake2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hadac2011" /&gt;.

==Technology description==

All [[Cell membrane|living surfaces]] are decorated with a diverse range of complex molecules, which are key modulators of [[Cell signaling|chemical communications]] and other functions such as protection, [[Cell adhesion|adhesion]], [[infectivity]], [[apoptosis]], etc. Functional-Spacer-Lipid (FSL) Kode constructs can be [[Chemical synthesis|synthesized]] to mimic the bioactive components present on biological surfaces, and then re-present them in novel ways.&lt;ref name="Blake2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Korchagina2012" /&gt;

The architecture of an FSL Kode construct, as implicit in the name, consists of three components - a functional head group, a spacer, and a lipid tail.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This structure is analogous to a [[Lego minifigure]] in that, they have three structural components, with each component having a separate purpose.&lt;ref name="Blake2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Korchagina2012" /&gt; In the examples shown in all the figures, a Lego '[[minifig]]' has been used for the analogy. However, it should be appreciated that this is merely a representation and the true structural similarity is significantly varied between Lego minifigures and FSL Kode constructs ''(fig 1)''. The functional group of an FSL is equivalent to a Lego minifigure head, with both being at the extremity and carrying the character functional components. The spacer of the FSL is equivalent to the body of the Lego minifigure and the arms on the minifigure are representative of substitutions which may be engineered into the chemical makeup of the spacer. The lipid of the FSL anchors it to lipid membranes and gives the FSL construct its [[amphiphile|amphiphatic]] nature which can cause it to self-assemble. Because the lipid tail can act directly as an anchor it is analogous to the legs of a Lego minifigure.

==Flexible design==
The functional group, the spacer and the lipid tail components of the FSL Kode construct can each be individually designed resulting in FSL Kode constructs with specific biological functions.&lt;ref name="Korchagina2012" /&gt; The functional head group is usually the bioactive component of the construct and the various spacers and lipids influence and effect its presentation, orientation and location on a surface. Critical to the definition of an FSL Kode construct is the requirement to be [[Dispersion (chemistry)|dispersible]] in water, and spontaneously and stably incorporate into cell membranes. Other lipid [[Bioconjugation|bioconjugates]] that include components similar to FSLs but do not have these features are not termed as Function-Spacer-Lipid Kode constructs.&lt;ref name="Korchagina2012" /&gt;

As indicated in the figure, the function group analogous to the minifigures head can be arranged in different substances, the spacer analogous to the body of the minifigure (including the arms) can have a variety of different features, and the lipid or minifigure legs can be a variety of different lipids. Together the three components of function, spacer &amp; lipid represent the FSL construct.

A large range of functional groups have already been made into FSL Kode constructs. These include:

''Note 2: Mass – the mass that can be anchored by an FSL Kode constructs can range from 200 to &gt;1x10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; [[Dalton (unit)|Da]]''

===Spacers&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;===
The spacer is an integral part of the FSL Kode construct and gives it several important characteristics including water [[Dispersion (chemistry)|dispersibility]].&lt;ref name="Korchagina2012" /&gt;
* '''Length''' – the spacer can be varied in length, for example 1.9&amp;nbsp;nm (Ad), 7.2&amp;nbsp;nm (CMG2), 11.5&amp;nbsp;nm (CMG4),&lt;ref name="Korchagina2012" /&gt; allowing for enhanced presentation of Functional groups at the biosurface.
* '''Optimizes 'F' presentation''' – The presentation of the bioactive (functional group) on a spacer reduces [[steric hindrance]] and increases the bioactive surfaces exposed and available for interactions
* '''Rigidity''' – the spacer can be modified to be either flexible or rigid depending upon desired characteristics
* '''Substitutions''' (represented by the leaves on the stalk) – the spacer can be modified both in [[charge (chemistry)|charge]], and [[Chemical polarity|polarity]].
* '''Branches''' – usually the spacer is linear, but it can also be branched including specific spacing of the branches to optimize presentation and interaction of the F group.
* '''Inert''' – important to the design of FSL Kode constructs is the biologically inert nature of the spacer. Importantly this feature means the S-L components of the constructs are unreactive with undiluted serum. Consequently, the constructs are compatible ''[[in vivo]]'' use, and can improve diagnostic assay sensitivity by allowing for the use of undiluted serum.

===Lipids&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;===
The [[lipid]] tail is essential for enabling [[lipid membrane]] insertion and retention but also for giving the construct [[amphiphile|amphiphilic]] characteristics that enable [[hydrophilic]] surface coating (due to formation of [[bilipid layer]]s). Different [[Lipid bilayer|membrane lipids]] that can be used to create FSLs have different membrane physiochemical characteristics and thus can affect biological function of the FSL. Lipids in FSL Kode constructs include:&lt;ref name="Korchagina2012" /&gt;
* '''Diacyl/diakyl''' e.g. DOPE
* '''Sterols''' e.g. cholesterol 
* '''Ceramides'''

The last three examples all based on CMG2 spacers (stalks), with a DOPE lipid tail (roots) are multimeric presentations of F. The first of these is a simple duplication of the F group, while the following has an additional spacer between the F groups. The final construct is a cluster presentation.
}}

One of the important functions of an FSL construct is that it can optimise the presentation of [[antigen]]s, both on cell surfaces and solid-phase membranes. This optimisation is achieved primarily by the spacer, and secondarily by the lipid tail. In a typical [[immunoassay]], the antigen is deposited directly onto the [[microplate]] surface and binds to the surface either in a random fashion, or in a preferred orientation depending on the residues present on the surface of this antigen. Usually this deposition process is uncontrolled. In contrast, the FSL Kode construct bound to a microplate presents the antigen away from the surface in an orientation with a high level of exposure to the environment. Furthermore, typical immunoassays use recombinant [[peptide]]s rather than discrete peptide antigens. As the recombinant peptide is many times bigger than the [[epitope]] of interest, a lot of undesired and unwanted peptide sequences are also represented on the microplate. These additional sequences may include unwanted microbial related sequences (as determined by a [[BLAST]] analysis) that can cause issues of low level cross-reactivity. Often the mechanism by which an immunoassay is able to overcome this low level activity is to dilute the serum so that the low level microbial reactive [[antibodies]] are not seen, and only high-level specific antibodies result in an interpretable result. In contrast, FSL Kode constructs usually use specifically selected peptide fragments (up to 40 amino acids),&lt;ref name="Henry2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Henry2012a" /&gt; thereby overcoming cross-reactivity with microbial sequences, and allowing for the use of undiluted [[serum (blood)|serum]] (which increases [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity]]).

The F component can be further enhanced by presentation of it in [[multimeric]] formats and with specific spacing. The four types of multimeric format include linear repeating units, linear repeating units with spacing, clusters, and branching ''(Fig. 4)''.

The surface of the bilayer will be hydrophilic, allowing it to interact and anchor the FSLs to the hydrophilic surface.
}}

=== Amphiphilic FSL Kode construct ===

The FSL Kode construct by nature of its composition in possessing both hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions are [[amphiphile|amphiphilic]] (or amphipathic). This characteristic determines the way in which the construct will interact with surfaces. When present in a [[solution]] they may form simple [[micelles]] or adopt more complex bilayer structures with two simplistic examples shown in ''Fig. 5a''. More complex structures are expected. The actual nature of FSL micelles has not been determined. However, based on normal structural function of micelles, it is expected that it will be determined in part by the combination of functional group, spacer and lipid together with temperature, [[concentration]], size and [[hydrophobicity|hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity]] for each FSL Kode construct type.

Surface coatings will occur via two theoretical mechanisms, the first being direct hydrophobic interaction of the lipid tail with a hydrophobic surface resulting in a [[monolayer]] of FSL at the surface ''(Fig. 5b)''. Hydrophobic binding of the FSL will be via its hydrophobic lipid tail interacting directly with the hydrophobic ([[lipophilic]]) surface. The second surface coating will be through the formation of bilayers as the lipid tail is unable to react with the hydrophilic surface. In this case the lipids will induce the formation of a bilayer, the surface of which will be hydrophilic. This hydrophilic membrane will then interact directly with the hydrophilic surface and will probably encapsulate [[fibres]]. This hydrophilic bilayer binding is the expected mechanism by which FSLs are able to bind to fibrous membranes such as paper&lt;ref name="Henry2012c"/&gt; and glass fibres ''(Fig. 5c)'' and ''(Fig. 9)''.

=== Lipid membrane modification ===

}}

After labeling of the surface with the selected F bioactive(s) the constructs will be present and orientated at the membrane surface. It is expected that the FSL will be highly mobile within the membrane and the choice of lipid tail will effect is relative partitioning within the membrane.&lt;ref name="Korchagina2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Harrison2010" /&gt; The construct unless it has [[Lipid bilayer phase behavior|flip-flop behavior]] is expected to remain surface presented. However, the modification is not permanent in living cells and constructs will be lost (consumed) at a rate proportional to the activity at the membrane and [[Cell division|division rate of the cell]] (with dead cells remaining highly labeled).&lt;ref name="Blake2011" /&gt; Additionally, when present ''in vivo'' with serum lipids FSLs will elute from the membrane into the plasma at a rate of about 1% per hour.&lt;ref name="Hadac2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Oliver2011b" /&gt; In fixed cells or inactive cells (e.g. red cells) stored in serum free media the constructs are retained normally.&lt;ref name="Blake2011" /&gt;

Liposomes are easy koded by simply adding FSL Kode constructs into the preparation. Contacting koded liposomes with microplates or other surfaces can cause the labeling of the microplate surface.

=== Non-biologic surface interaction ===
Non-biologic surface coatings will occur via two mechanisms, the first being direct hydrophobic interaction of the lipid tail with a hydrophobic surface resulting in a monolayer of FSL at the surface. The second surface coating will be through the formation of bilayers, which probably either encapsulate fibres or being via the hydrophilic F group. This is the expected mechanism by which FSLs bind to fibrous membranes such as paper&lt;ref name="Henry2012c" /&gt; and glass fibres. A recent study has found that when FSL Kode constructs are optimised, could in a few seconds glycosylate almost any non-biological surface including metals, glass, plastics, rubbers, and other polymers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Ultra-Fast Glyco-Coating of Non-Biological Surfaces|url = http://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/17/1/118|journal = International Journal of Molecular Sciences|date = 2016-01-16|pages = 118|volume = 17|issue = 1|doi = 10.3390/ijms17010118|language = en|first = Eleanor|last = Williams|first2 = Katie|last2 = Barr|first3 = Elena|last3 = Korchagina|first4 = Alexander|last4 = Tuzikov|first5 = Stephen|last5 = Henry|first6 = Nicolai|last6 = Bovin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology features ==

The technological features of FSL Kode constructs and the koding process can be summarized as follows:
* '''Rapid and simple''' – simple contact for 10–120 minutes and constructs spontaneously and stably incorporate – no washing required.&lt;ref name="Blake2011" /&gt;
* '''Replicable''' – same variables (time, temperature, concentration) equals the same result.&lt;ref name="Blake2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Frame2007" /&gt;
* '''Toxicity''' – FSL constructs are [[biocompatible]], disperse into biological solutions without [[solvents]], detergents. They label non-covalently and are non-genetic. Normal [[vitality]] and functionality is maintained in modified cells/virions/organisms.&lt;ref name="Harrison2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Oliver2011a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Oliver2011b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lan2012" /&gt; Toxicity/vitality experiments in small laboratory animals, [[zebrafish]], [[cell culture]]s, [[spermatozoa]] and [[embryos]] find no [[toxic]] effects within physiological ranges.
* '''Amphiphilic''' – the [[amphiphilic]] nature of the FSL Kode construct makes them water dispersible (clear solution of micelles), yet once interacted with a membrane they insert/coat and become water resistant
* '''Variable design''' – a single F can be presented in more than 100 ways by varying the spacer and lipid.
* '''High biovisibility''' – as the spacer holds the F moiety away for the membrane it is able to achieve increased sensitivity, specificity and reactivity can be optimized by use of multiple and variable biomarker presentations on the same surface.
* '''Additive''' – FSL modification is compatible with other technologies allowing users to add additional features to cells/viruses/organisms/surfaces already modified by more traditional methods. Multiple FSL constructs may be added to a surface simultaneously by simply creating a mix of FSL Kode constructs. Constructs insert into living or fixed cell ([[Glutaraldehyde#Fixative|glutaraldehyde]]) membranes. 
[[File:RFG maleimide construction.svg|thumb|''Fig. 8'' FSLs can be easily created from [[cysteine]]-containing peptides, proteins or any other [[thiol]]s of biological interest. The mixing of a cysteine containing peptide with FSL-RFG(Maleimide), in [[N-Methylmorpholine|4MMF]] buffer, allows the peptide to react with the [[maleimide]] residue of the FSL (through the well-known [[Michael reaction|Michael nucleophilic addition reaction]]). Following overnight incubation then vacuum drying, an FSL peptide is created. No purification is required.|400x400px]]
* '''Simple FSL peptide synthesis''' – there is a reactive-functional-group FSL Kode construct with maleimide as its functional group which can be used for preparation of FSLs from [[cysteine]]-containing peptides, proteins or any other [[thiol]]s of biological interest.&lt;ref name="Henry2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Henry2012a" /&gt; The effective synthetic approach is based on the well-known [[Michael reaction|Michael nucleophilic]] addition to maleimides ''(Fig. 7)''.
* '''Synthetic "Gylcolipids"''' – one family of the FSL constructs are synthetic [[glycolipid]]s with well-defined hydrophobic tails and carbohydrate head groups

=== Koded membranes surfaces and solutions ===
FSL constructs have a wide range of uses and they have been used to modify the following:
* '''Cells''' – [[blood cell]]s,&lt;ref name="Blake2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Korchagina2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Henry2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Frame2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Georgakopoulos2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Oliver2011a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Oliver2011b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hult2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Henry2012b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Heathcote2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nadarajan2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Henry2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Henry2012c" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chesla2010" /&gt; [[Cell culture|culture lines]],&lt;ref name="Blake2011" /&gt; [[embryos]],&lt;ref name="Blake2011" /&gt; [[spermatozoa]]&lt;ref name="Blake2011" /&gt;
* '''Viruses'''&lt;ref name="Hadac2011" /&gt; – influenza,&lt;ref name="Korchagina2012" /&gt; [[measles]], [[varicella]]
* '''Organisms''' – [[parasite]]s, [[microbe]]s, [[zebrafish]]&lt;ref name="Lan2012" /&gt;
* '''Liposomes''' – also micelles, lipid particles&lt;ref name="Oliver2011a" /&gt;
* '''Surfaces/fibres''' – hydrophobic or hydrophilic membranes/fibres, paper,&lt;ref name="Henry2012c" /&gt; [[nitrocellulose]], cotton, silk, glass, [[Teflon]], [[silica]], magnetic beads (microspheres)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Rapid biofunctionalization of magnetic beads with function-spacer-lipid constructs|url = http://sepmag.eu/blog/bid/401297/Rapid-biofunctionalization-of-magnetic-beads-with-function-spacer-lipid-constructs|website = sepmag.eu|accessdate = 2015-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; etc.
* '''Solutions''' – saline, plasma/serum, culture media

== Methodology for FSL use (koding) ==
[[File:Preparation of kodecytes and kodevirions.svg|thumb|''Fig. 9'' Preparation of [[kodecytes]]/[[kodevirions]]. Simply mix cells/virions with an FSL solution (containing 1 or more FSLs) and incubate for 10–120 minutes at 37°C (or at temperatures as low as 4°C). The constructs will spontaneously incorporate into the membrane and no further steps are required.|400x400px]]
FSL constructs, when in solution ([[Saline (medicine)|saline]]) and in contact, will spontaneously incorporate into cell and virus membranes.&lt;ref name="Blake2011" /&gt; The methodology involves simply preparing a solution of FSL construct(s) in the range of 1–1000 [[µg]]/[[millilitre|mL]]. The actual concentration will depend on the construct and the quantity of construct required in the membrane. One part of FSL solution is added to one part of cells (up to 100% [[suspension (chemistry)|suspension]]) and they are incubated at a set temperature within the range of 4–37&amp;nbsp;°C (39–99&amp;nbsp;°F) depending on temperature compatibility of the cells being modified. The higher the temperature, the faster the rate of FSL insertion into the membrane. For red blood cells, at 37&amp;nbsp;°C incubation for 2 hours achieves &gt;95% insertion with at least 50% insertion being achieved within 20 minutes. In general, FSL insertion time of 4 hours at room temperature or 20 hours at 4&amp;nbsp;°C gives results similar to 1 hour at 37&amp;nbsp;°C for carbohydrate based FSLs inserting into red blood cells.&lt;ref name="Blake2011" /&gt; The resultant kodecytes or kodevirions do not required to be washed, however this option should be considered if an excess of FSL construct is used in the koding process.

== Applications ==
FSL Kode constructs have been used for research and development, [[diagnostic]] products, and are currently being investigated as potential [[therapeutic]] agents.

=== Kodecytes ===
{{main article|Kodecyte#Applications}}

FSL have been used to create human red cell kodecytes that have been used to detect and identify blood group allo-antibodies&lt;ref name="Heathcote2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nadarajan2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Henry2011" /&gt; as [[ABO blood group system|ABO]] sub-group mimics,&lt;ref name="Hult2012" /&gt; ABO quality control systems,&lt;ref name="Henry2009" /&gt; [[serologic]] teaching kits&lt;ref name="Henry2012b" /&gt; and a [[syphilis]] diagnostic.&lt;ref name="Chesla2010" /&gt; Kodecytes have also demonstrated that FSL-FLRO4 is a suitable reagent for labelling [[packed red blood cells]] (PRBC) at any point during routine storage and look to facilitate the development of immunoassays and transfusion models focused on addressing the mechanisms involved in [[Transfusion-related immunomodulation|tansfusion-related immunomodulation]] (TRIM).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Murine kodecytes have been experimentally used to determine ''in vivo'' cell survival,&lt;ref name="Oliver2011b" /&gt; and create model [[Transfusion reaction#Complications of transfusions|transfusion reactions]].&lt;ref name="Oliver2011a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Oliver2011b" /&gt; Zebrafish kodecytes have been used to determine real time ''in vivo'' cell migration.&lt;ref name="Lan2012" /&gt; Kodecytes have been used to create influenza diagnostics.&lt;ref name="Korchagina2012" /&gt; Kodecytes which have been modified with FSL-GB3 were unable to be infected with the [[HIV virus]].&lt;ref name="Harrison2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Branch2008" /&gt;

=== Kodevirions ===
{{main article|Kodevirions#Applications}}

Kodevirions are FSL modified viruses. Several FSL Kode constructs have been used to label viruses to assist in their [[Flow cytometry|flow-cytometric visualisation]]&lt;ref name="Hadac2011" /&gt; and to track them real time distribution in animal models.&lt;ref name="Hadac2011" /&gt; They have also been used to modify the surface of viruses with the intention of targeting them to be used to attach [[tumor]]s ([[oncolytic]]).&lt;ref name="Hadac2011" /&gt;

=== Kodesomes ===
Kodesomes are liposomes that have been decorated with FSL Kode constructs. These have been used to deposit FSL constructs onto microplates to create diagnostic [[assay]]s. They also have the potential for therapeutic use.&lt;ref name="Harrison2011" /&gt;

=== Koded solutions ===
These are solutions containing FSL Kode constructs where the construct will exist as a clear micellular dispersion. FSL-GB3 as a solution/gel has been used to inhibit HIV infection&lt;ref name="Harrison2010" /&gt; and to neutralise [[Shiga toxin]].&lt;ref name="Harrison2010" /&gt; FSL blood group A as a solution has been used to neutralise circulating antibodies in a [[mouse]] model and allow incompatible blood group A ([[murine]] kodecytes) transfusion.&lt;ref name="Oliver2011a" /&gt; This model experiment was used to demonstrate the potential of FSLs to neutralise circulating antibody and allow for incompatible blood transfusion or [[organ transplantation]].&lt;ref name="Henry2012c" /&gt;

=== Koded surfaces ===
[[File:Inkjet Printed FSLs.jpg|thumb|''Fig. 10'' FSL constructs can be printed with a [[Inkjet printer|standard desktop inkjet printer]] directly onto paper to create [[immunoassay]]s. Image is a typical example of an inkjet printed enzyme immunoassay (EIA) where 12 different FSL constructs were printed as identifying codes on paper and then reacted against different samples. The antibody activity in the samples can be identified by appearance of words identifying the target antigen. An empty inkjet cartridge is filled with an FSL construct and words, barcodes, or graphics are printed. A [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|Perspex]] template is adhered to the surface to create [[Microtiter plate|reaction wells]]. The method is then a standard [[immunoassay|EIA]] procedure, but blocking of serum is not required and undiluted serum can be used. A typical EIA procedure is as follows: add serum, incubate, wash by immersion, add secondary EIA [[Immunoassay#Detection Antibody|detection antibody]], incubate, wash, add [[Nitro blue tetrazolium chloride|NBT]]/BCIP precipitating substrate and stop the reaction when developed by washing. The end result is stable for years.|541x541px]]

All FSL Kode constructs disperse in water and are therefore compatible with [[inkjet printer]]s. FSL constructs can be printed with a standard desktop inkjet printer directly onto paper to create immunoassays.&lt;ref name="Henry2012c" /&gt; An empty ink cartridge is filled with an FSL construct and words, [[barcode]]s, or graphics are printed. A [[Perspex]] template is adhered to the surface to create reaction wells. The method is then a standard [[Immunoassay|EIA]] procedure, but blocking of serum is not required and undiluted serum can be used. A typical procedure is as follows: add serum, incubate, wash by immersion, add secondary EIA conjugate, incubate, wash, add [[Nitro blue tetrazolium chloride|NBT]]/[[BCIP]] precipitating substrate and stop the reaction when developed by washing ''(Fig. 9)''. The end result is stable for years.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14490">'''Functional genomics''' is a field of [[molecular biology]] that attempts to make use of the vast wealth of data given by [[genomics|genomic]] and [[Transcriptomics|transcriptomic]] projects (such as [[genome project|genome sequencing projects]] and [[RNA-Seq|RNA sequencing]]) to describe [[gene]] (and [[protein]]) functions and interactions. Unlike [[structural genomics]], functional genomics focuses on the dynamic aspects such as gene [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]], [[translation (biology)|translation]], [[regulation of gene expression]] and [[protein–protein interaction]]s, as opposed to the static aspects of the genomic information such as [[DNA sequence]] or structures. Functional genomics attempts to answer questions about the function of DNA at the levels of genes, RNA transcripts, and protein products. A key characteristic of functional genomics studies is their genome-wide approach to these questions, generally involving high-throughput methods rather than a more traditional “gene-by-gene” approach.

==Goals of functional genomics==
The goal of functional genomics is to understand the function of larger numbers of genes or proteins, eventually all components of a genome. A more long-term goal is to understand the relationship between an organism's [[genome]] and its [[phenotype]]. The term functional genomics is often used broadly to refer to the many '''technical approaches''' to study an organism's '''genes and proteins''', including the "biochemical, cellular, and/or physiological properties of each and every gene product"&lt;ref name="Gibson and Muse"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Gibson G, Muse SV |title=A primer of genome science |edition=3rd |publisher=Sinauer Associates |location=Sunderland, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; while some authors include the study of '''nongenic elements''' in his definition.&lt;ref name="Pevsner"&gt;{{cite book |author=Pevsner J |year=2009 |title=Bioinformatics and functional genomics |edition=2nd |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |location=Hoboken, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Functional genomics may also include studies of natural '''genetic variation''' '''over time''' (such as an organism's development) or '''space''' (such as its body regions), as well as functional disruptions such as mutations.

The promise of functional genomics is to generate and synthesize genomic and proteomic knowledge into an understanding of the dynamic properties of an organism. This would provide a more complete picture than studies of single genes. Integration of functional genomics data is also the goal of [[systems biology]].

==Techniques and applications==
Functional genomics includes function-related aspects of the genome itself such as [[mutation]] and [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]] (such as [[single nucleotide polymorphism]] (SNP) analysis), as well as measurement of molecular activities. The latter comprise a number of "-[[omics]]" such as [[transcriptomics]] ([[gene expression]]), [[proteomics]] ([[protein production]]), and [[metabolomics]]. Functional genomics uses mostly [[multiplex (assay)|multiplex]] techniques to measure the abundance of many or all gene products such as [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]]s or [[protein]]s within a [[Biological specimen|biological sample]]. Together these measurement modalities endeavor to quantitate the various biological processes and improve our understanding of gene and protein functions and interactions.

===At the DNA level===

====Genetic interaction mapping====
{{Main|Epistasis}}
Systematic pairwise deletion of genes or inhibition of gene expression can be used to identify genes with related function, even if they do not interact physically. Epistasis refers to the fact that effects for two different gene knockouts may not be additive; that is, the phenotype that results when two genes are inhibited may be different from the sum of the effects of single knockouts.

====The ENCODE project====
{{Main|ENCODE}}
The ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA elements) project is an in-depth analysis of the human genome whose goal is to identify all the functional elements of genomic DNA, in both coding and noncoding regions. To this point{{when|date=January 2018}} , only the pilot phase of the study has been completed, involving hundreds of assays performed on 44 regions of known or unknown function comprising 1% of the human genome. Important results include evidence from genomic tiling arrays that most nucleotides are transcribed as coding transcripts, noncoding RNAs, or random transcripts, the discovery of additional transcriptional regulatory sites, further elucidation of chromatin-modifying mechanisms.

===At the RNA level: transcriptome profiling===

====Microarrays====
{{Main|DNA microarray}}
Microarrays measure the amount of mRNA in a sample that corresponds to a given gene or probe DNA sequence. Probe sequences are immobilized on a solid surface and allowed to [[Nucleic acid hybridization|hybridize]] with fluorescently labeled “target” mRNA. The intensity of fluorescence of a spot is proportional to the amount of target sequence that has hybridized to that spot, and therefore to the abundance of that mRNA sequence in the sample. Microarrays allow for identification of candidate genes involved in a given process based on variation between transcript levels for different conditions and shared expression patterns with genes of known function.

====SAGE====
{{Main|Serial analysis of gene expression}}
[[Serial analysis of gene expression]] (SAGE) is an alternate method of analysis based on RNA sequencing rather than hybridization. SAGE relies on the sequencing of 10–17 base pair tags which are unique to each gene. These tags are produced from [[Polyadenylation|poly-A mRNA]] and ligated end-to-end before sequencing. SAGE gives an unbiased measurement of the number of transcripts per cell, since it does not depend on prior knowledge of what transcripts to study (as microarrays do).

====RNA sequencing====
{{Main|RNA-Seq|MicroRNA sequencing}}
RNA sequencing has taken over microarray and SAGE technology in recent years, as noted in 2016, and has become the most efficient way to study  transcription and gene expression. This is typically done by [[DNA sequencing|next-generation sequencing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hrdlickova|first=Radmila|last2=Toloue|first2=Masoud|last3=Tian|first3=Bin|date=January 2017|title=RNA-Seq methods for transcriptome analysis|journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: RNA|volume=8|issue=1|doi=10.1002/wrna.1364|issn=1757-7012|pmid=27198714|pmc=5717752|page=e1364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A subset of sequenced RNAs are small RNAs, a class of non-coding RNA molecules that are key regulators of transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene silencing, or [[RNA silencing]]. Next generation sequencing is the gold standard tool for [[non-coding RNA]] discovery, profiling and expression analysis.

===At the protein level: protein–protein interactions===

====Yeast two-hybrid system====
{{Main|Two-hybrid screening}}
A yeast [[two-hybrid screening]] (Y2H) tests a "bait" protein against many potential interacting proteins ("prey") to identify physical protein–protein interactions. This system is based on a transcription factor, originally GAL4,&lt;ref name=pmid2547163&gt;{{Cite journal
| volume = 340
| title = A novel genetic system to detect protein-protein interactions
| issue = 6230
| pages = 245–246
| journal = Nature | first2 = O.
| last2 = Song
| pmid = 2547163
| year = 1989
| last1 = Fields | first1 = S.
| doi = 10.1038/340245a0 
|bibcode = 1989Natur.340..245F }}&lt;/ref&gt; whose separate DNA-binding and transcription activation domains are both required in order for the protein to cause transcription of a reporter gene. In a Y2H screen, the "bait" protein is fused to the binding domain of GAL4, and a library of potential "prey" (interacting) proteins is recombinantly expressed in a vector with the activation domain. In vivo interaction of bait and prey proteins in a yeast cell brings the activation and binding domains of GAL4 close enough together to result in expression of a [[reporter gene]]. It is also possible to systematically test a library of bait proteins against a library of prey proteins to identify all possible interactions in a cell.

====AP/MS====
[[Affinity purification]] and [[mass spectrometry]] (AP/MS) is able to identify proteins that interact with one another in complexes. Complexes of proteins are allowed to form around a particular “bait” protein. The bait protein is identified using an antibody or a recombinant tag which allows it to be extracted along with any proteins that have formed a complex with it. The proteins are then digested into short [[peptide]] fragments and mass spectrometry is used to identify the proteins based on the mass-to-charge ratios of those fragments.

===Loss-of-function techniques===

====Mutagenesis====
Gene function can be investigated by systematically “knocking out” genes one by one. This is done by either [[gene knockout|deletion]] or disruption of function (such as by [[insertional mutagenesis]]) and the resulting organisms are screened for phenotypes that provide clues to the function of the disrupted gene.

====RNAi====
{{Main|RNAi}}
RNA interference (RNAi) methods can be used to transiently silence or knock down gene expression using ~20 base-pair double-stranded RNA typically delivered by transfection of synthetic ~20-mer short-interfering RNA molecules (siRNAs) or by virally encoded short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs). RNAi screens, typically performed in cell culture-based assays or experimental organisms (such as ''C. elegans'') can be used to systematically disrupt nearly every gene in a genome or subsets of genes (sub-genomes); possible functions of disrupted genes can be assigned based on observed [[phenotype]]s.

===Functional annotations for genes===

====Genome annotation====
{{Main|Genome project#Genome annotation}}
Putative genes can be identified by scanning a genome for regions likely to encode proteins, based on characteristics such as long [[open reading frames]], transcriptional initiation sequences, and [[polyadenylation]] sites. A sequence identified as a putative gene must be confirmed by further evidence, such as similarity to cDNA or EST sequences from the same organism, similarity of the predicted protein sequence to known proteins, association with promoter sequences, or evidence that mutating the sequence produces an observable phenotype.

====Rosetta stone approach====
The Rosetta stone approach is a computation method of de novo protein function prediction, based on the hypothesis that some proteins involved in a given physiological process may exist as two separate genes in one organism and as a single gene in another. Genomes are scanned for sequences that are independent in one organism and in a single open reading frame in another. If two genes have fused, it is predicted that they have similar biological functions that make such co-regulation advantageous.

===Functional genomics and bioinformatics===
Because of the large quantity of data produced by these techniques and the desire to find biologically meaningful patterns, [[bioinformatics]] is crucial to analysis of functional genomics data. Examples of techniques in this class are [[data clustering]] or [[principal component analysis]] for unsupervised [[machine learning]] (class detection) as well as [[artificial neural network]]s or [[support vector machine]]s for supervised machine learning (class prediction, [[Statistical classification|classification]]). Functional enrichment analysis is used to determine the extent of over- or under-expression (positive- or negative- regulators in case of RNAi screens) of functional categories relative to a background sets. [[Gene ontology]] based enrichment analysis are provided by [[Gene set enrichment analysis#DAVID|DAVID]] and [[gene set enrichment analysis]] (GSEA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Subramanian A, Tamayo P, Mootha VK |title=Gene set enrichment analysis: A knowledge-based approach for interpreting genome-wide expression profiles |journal=Proc.

'''Giants' tomb''' (Italian: ''[[:wiktionary:Tomba|Tomba]] dei giganti'', [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]]: ''Tumba de zigantes'' / ''gigantis'') is the name given by [[Sardinians|local people]] and [[archaeologist]]s to a type of [[Sardinia]]n [[megalithic]] [[gallery grave]] built during the [[Bronze Age]] by the [[Nuragic civilization]]. They were collective tombs and can be found throughout [[Sardinia]], with 800 being discovered there.&lt;ref name=Atzeni.I&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/2572124/ASPETTI_E_PROBLEMATICHE_DEL_RITUALE_FUNERARIO_DI_ETA_NURAGICA  Aspetti e problematiche del rituale funarario di età nuragica]&lt;/ref&gt;

A stone [[cairn]] lies over the burial chambers, with some examples having a cup-shaped entrance similar to the [[court cairn]] tombs of [[Ireland]].

==Types==
[[File:Giants' grave Coddu Vecchiu (Sardegna).jpg|right|500px|thumb|Coddu Vecchju - [[Arzachena]]]]

There are two general types of giants' tomb. In the so-called "slab type", uncut slabs are buried on end in the ground, and are arranged side-by-side. There is usually a central [[stele]], which is the largest slab (up to 4&amp;nbsp;m in height) and has a doorway cut through it.

In the more primitive slab-type giants tombs, the central slab is unmodified aside from the entrance that is cut through it at the base, or else there is a crude dolmen-like arrangement of 3 uncut rocks to form the entrance (Osono, Sortali, Lolghi, Pescaredda). In more advanced slab-type giants tombs, the central slab is modified so as to be rounded on top, and has a simple design carved into the front surface (Dorgali, Goronna, Santu Bainzu, Coddu Vecchju).

The [[sepulchre]]s have a characteristic rectangular plan with an [[apse]]. The burial chamber is usually 5 to 15 metres long and 1 to 2 metres high. The structures were originally covered by a mound resembling the shape of an overturned ship. Near the entrance an [[obelisk]] (''betile'' in [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]]) is usually found, which symbolizes the gods or ancestors who watched over the dead.

The so-called "block type" tombs are made of rectangular-cut blocks (Bidistili, Madau II, Seleni II, Iloi, Mura Cuata).

There are also structures similar to the block-type giants tombs on the island of [[Malta]], in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mysteriousbritain.co.uk/scotland/arran/ancient-sites/giants-graves.html Giant's Graves]&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Menorca]].&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Lilliu, La civiltà nuragica, Sassari 1982 p.54&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Green Bridge System.JPG|thumb|Green bridge system]]
'''Green bridges''' are an [[Ecotechnology|ecotechnological]] [[In_situ#Environmental_engineering|in-situ]] horizontal filtration system. Their different physical and biological filters work in combination to remove suspended and dissolved impurities of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kodarkar|first=Mohan|title=Ecological Restoration of Highly Polluted Stretch of Ahar River, Udaipur &amp; Ecological Improvement of Udaisagar Lake, Rajasthan, India, p. 7|url=http://rcse.edu.shiga-u.ac.jp/gov-pro/plan/2010list/10/indian_lakes/ilbm_impact_story-udaipur%27s_ecological_restoration_of_ahar_river_using_green_bridge_technology__2_.pdf|accessdate=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Green bridge filters help in reducing the suspended solids by filtration process, reducing [[Chemical oxygen demand|Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)]]/[[Biochemical oxygen demand|Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)]] by aerobic degradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sayali|first=Joshi|title=Ecotechnological Applications for control of lake pollution|url=http://wldb.ilec.or.jp/data/ilec/wlc12/F%20-%20Eutrophication%20and%20its%20Control/F-12.pdf|accessdate=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Green Bridges also help in the restoration of ecological food chain.

== Development ==
Natural streams, rivers and lakes have their own in-built purification system which consists of natural slopes, stones for biological growth and complex [[food web]] help in the purification process. This food web is nothing but utilization of one's waste by another as its own food. Nature has her own living machinery of detritivorous microbes and other living species to consume wastes. These principles have been harnessed in the treatment of polluted streams.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Green bridges are developed using fibrous material with stones. All the floatable and suspended solids are trapped in this biological bridge and the turbidity of flowing water is reduced. Green plants on the bridges increase the DO level in water, which in turn facilitates the growth of aerobic organisms, which degrade organic pollutants. Sandeep Joshi, director, SERI (Shrishti Eco-Research Institute) has developed this technology and has received a patent for it.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

== Benefits ==
* Capital expenditure is comparable with the annual operational cost of conventional bioremediation systems.
* Can be developed and operated in combination with conventional systems to improve the performance of the latter.
* Reduce the ecotoxicity of the man-made substances released into the water bodies and facilitate the eco-assimilation of those pollutants into the ecological cycles thus reducing the quantum of hazardous residues to zero which otherwise require costly secured landfill and incineration techniques.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===Expected results===
* Solids control : 40–80% reduction
* Pollution control : COD/BOD reduction – 40–90%
* Fecal coliforms control : 50–100% reduction
* Ecotoxicity : Nil
* Dissolved oxygen : Increased by 150% – 1200%
* Aquatic species : 
** Increase in plants/plankton – 200%
** Increase in micro-invertebrates – 200%

Other than the changes in the water quality mentioned above a multifold change in population of avifauna, terrestrial plants along the riverbanks has been noticed. There is an overall odour and mosquito reduction and improvement of river aesthetics. Increase in health status of aquatic life in lentic-lotic system by reduction in ecotoxicity of pollutants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kodarkar|first=Mohan|title=Ecological Restoration of Highly Polluted Stretch of Ahar River, Udaipur &amp; Ecological Improvement of Udaisagar Lake, Rajasthan, India, p. 12|url=http://rcse.edu.shiga-u.ac.jp/gov-pro/plan/2010list/10/indian_lakes/ilbm_impact_story-udaipur%27s_ecological_restoration_of_ahar_river_using_green_bridge_technology__2_.pdf|accessdate=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10747">'''Green leaf volatiles''' (commonly abbreviated as '''GLV''') are [[Volatile organic compound|volatile organic compounds]] that are released when plants suffer tissue damage. Specifically, they include [[Aldehyde|aldehydes]], [[Ester|esters]], and [[Alcohol|alcohols]] of 6-carbon compounds released after wounding.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-11101536|title=Plants send SOS signal to insects|last=Gill|first=Victoria|date=2010-08-27|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; These compounds are very quickly produced and emitted, and are used by nearly every green plant.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Plants constantly release GLVs, but un-stressed plants release them in much smaller amounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Li|first=Tao|title=Neighbour Recognition Through Volatile-Mediated Interactions|date=2016|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-33498-1_7|work=Signaling and Communication in Plants|pages=153–174|publisher=Springer International Publishing|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-33498-1_7|isbn=9783319334967|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these chemicals act as [[Signaling (telecommunications)|signaling]] compounds between either plants of the same species, of other species, or even vastly different lifeforms like insects. Some, although not necessarily all, of these chemicals act essentially as plant [[pheromones]].&lt;sup&gt;[[Green leaf volatiles#cite note-2|[12]]]&lt;/sup&gt; GLVs also have antimicrobial properties to prevent infection at the site of injury.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Uses ==
GLVs are used in both plant-plant and plant-insect interactions. They usually serve as a warning signal of oncoming causes of tissue damage. When a plant is attacked, it emits GLVs into the environment through the air&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scala|first=Alessandra|last2=Allmann|first2=Silke|last3=Mirabella|first3=Rossana|last4=Haring|first4=Michel A.|last5=Schuurink|first5=Robert C.|date=2013-08-30|title=Green Leaf Volatiles: A Plant’s Multifunctional Weapon against Herbivores and Pathogens|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3794753/|journal=International Journal of Molecular Sciences|volume=14|issue=9|pages=17781–17811|doi=10.3390/ijms140917781|issn=1422-0067|pmc=3794753|pmid=23999587}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Undamaged neighboring plants perceive these GLV signals and activate the expression of genes related to the plants defense mechanisms&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. This allows the plant emitting the GLVs and the neighboring plants to enter a primed state. In this primed state plants activate their defenses systems more quickly and in a stronger concentration&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=ul Hassan|first=Muhammad Naeem|last2=Zainal|first2=Zamri|last3=Ismail|first3=Ismanizan|date=August 2015|title=Green leaf volatiles: biosynthesis, biological functions and their applications in biotechnology|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25865366|journal=Plant Biotechnology Journal|volume=13|issue=6|pages=727–739|doi=10.1111/pbi.12368|issn=1467-7652|pmid=25865366}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The amount of GLVs that a wounded plant emits is directly related to the severity of the injury, so the concentration of GLVs in the atmosphere and the frequency of exposure both play a role in neighboring plants successfully entering a primed state&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

In plant-insect interactions, GLVs are used as a form of defense. They alert [[predators]] to the locations of [[Herbivore|herbivores]] that are preying on the plant and causing tissue damage. For example, a study done by Northwestern University found that [[Parasitoid wasp|parasitic wasps]] are more attracted to plants that are emitting GLVs due to wounding from herbivores than to plants that are emitting GLVs due to mechanical damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nwo.nl/en/research-and-results/research-projects/i/17/8517.html|title=How isomerisation of green leaf volatiles affects plant-insect interactions|last=sitewriter|website=www.nwo.nl|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to determine if plants are capable of recognizing and distinguishing between GLVs, a study was done at University of California Davis where researchers exposed plants to GLVs emitted by a mechanically damaged tomato plant, and to GLVs emitted by a tomato plant that had been damaged by herbivores.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matsui|first=Kenji|last2=Sugimoto|first2=Kohichi|last3=Mano|first3=Jun'ichi|last4=Ozawa|first4=Rika|last5=Takabayashi|first5=Junji|date=2012-04-30|title=Differential Metabolisms of Green Leaf Volatiles in Injured and Intact Parts of a Wounded Leaf Meet Distinct Ecophysiological Requirements|url=https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0036433|journal=PLoS ONE|language=en|volume=7|issue=4|pages=e36433|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0036433|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3340338|pmid=22558466}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers observed a difference in the plants reaction, showing an increase in the proteins related to defense mechanisms for the plant exposed to the herbivore GLVs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This supports the theory that plants are able to distinguish between different GLVs, and react differently depending on which signal they receive.

== Antimicrobial Properties ==
Other benefits of Green Leaf Volatiles are that at the site of damage, GLVs are released in high concentrations and act as [[antimicrobial]] agents to make the plant more resistant to bacterial or fungal [[Infection|infections]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brilli|first=Federico|last2=Ruuskanen|first2=Taina M.|last3=Schnitzhofer|first3=Ralf|last4=Müller|first4=Markus|last5=Breitenlechner|first5=Martin|last6=Bittner|first6=Vinzenz|last7=Wohlfahrt|first7=Georg|last8=Loreto|first8=Francesco|last9=Hansel|first9=Armin|date=2011-05-26|title=Detection of Plant Volatiles after Leaf Wounding and Darkening by

To study the anti-fungal properties of GLVs, researchers at the University of Arizona influenced how plants expressed HPL, the main [[enzyme]] of GLV synthesis&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=ul Hassan|first=Muhammad Naeem|last2=Zainal|first2=Zamri|last3=Ismail|first3=Ismanizan|date=2015-04-10|title=Green leaf volatiles: biosynthesis, biological functions and their applications in biotechnology|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/pbi.12368|journal=Plant Biotechnology Journal|language=en|volume=13|issue=6|pages=727–739|doi=10.1111/pbi.12368|issn=1467-7644}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Scientists compared the rates of fungal spore growth in HPL over-expressing and HPL silencing mutants to the wild type plants.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Results from the study showed lower rates of fungal growth and higher GLV emissions on the HPL over-expressing mutants, while the HPL silencing mutants showed higher rates of fungal growth and lower GLV emissions, which supports the hypothesis that GLVs have antimicrobial properties.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The antimicrobial properties of GLVs have also been part of an [[evolutionary arms race]] that raise questions for scientists. During an infection, plants emit GLVs to act as microbial agents, but bacteria and viruses have adapted to use these GLVs to their own benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2006-08-01|title=Crosstalk between abiotic and biotic stress responses: a current view from the points of convergence in the stress signaling networks|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369526606000884|journal=Current Opinion in Plant Biology|language=en|volume=9|issue=4|pages=436–442|doi=10.1016/j.pbi.2006.05.014|issn=1369-5266}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common example of this is found in the red raspberry. When the red raspberry plant is infected, the virus influences it to produce more GLVs, which attract the red raspberry aphid.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Engelberth|first=Juergen|last2=Alborn|first2=Hans T.|last3=Schmelz|first3=Eric A.|last4=Tumlinson|first4=James H.|date=2004-02-10|title=Airborne signals prime plants against insect herbivore attack|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/101/6/1781|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=101|issue=6|pages=1781–1785|doi=10.1073/pnas.0308037100|issn=0027-8424|pmid=14749516}}&lt;/ref&gt; These GLVs cause more aphids to come and to feed on the plant for longer, giving the virus better chances of being ingested and spread more widely.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Researchers are now trying to determine whether under infectious conditions plants emit GLVs for their benefit, or if bacteria and viruses induce the release of these compounds for their own benefit&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dombrowski|first=James E.|last2=Martin|first2=Ruth C.|date=2018-01-29|title=Activation of MAP kinases by green leaf volatiles in grasses|url=https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-017-3076-9|journal=BMC Research Notes|language=En|volume=11|issue=1|doi=10.1186/s13104-017-3076-9|issn=1756-0500|pmc=5789745|pmid=29378628}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Griffith's experiment''', reported in 1928 by [[Frederick Griffith]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Griffith|first=Fred.|authorlink=Frederick Griffith|title=The Significance of Pneumococcal Types|journal=Journal of Hygiene |publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=January 1928|volume=27|issue=2|pages=113–159|jstor=4626734 |pmid=20474956 |pmc=2167760 |doi=10.1017/S0022172400031879}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the first experiment suggesting that bacteria are capable of transferring genetic information through a process known as [[Transformation (genetics)|transformation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lorenz|first1=M. G.|last2=Wackernagel|first2=W.|title=Bacterial gene transfer by natural genetic transformation in the environment|journal=[[Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews|Microbiological Reviews]]|volume=58 |issue=3|pages=563–602 |date=1994-09-01 |pmid=7968924|pmc=372978}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Downie|first=A. W.|title=Pneumococcal transformation — a backward view: Fourth Griffith Memorial Lecture|journal=[[Microbiology (journal)|Journal of General Microbiology]]|url=http://mic.sgmjournals.org/content/73/1/1.full.pdf|volume=73|issue=1|pages=1–11|year=1972|doi=10.1099/00221287-73-1-1|pmid=4143929|accessdate=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Griffith's findings were followed by [[Avery–MacLeod–McCarty experiment|research in the late 1930s and early 40s]] that isolated [[DNA]] as the material that communicated this genetic information.

[[Pneumonia]] was a serious cause of death in the wake of the [[1918 flu pandemic|post-WWI Spanish influenza pandemic]], and Griffith was studying the possibility of creating a vaccine.  Griffith used two [[Strain (biology)|strain]]s of pneumococcus (''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'') bacteria which infect [[mouse|mice]] – a type III-S (smooth) which was [[virulent]], and a type II-R (rough) strain which was nonvirulent. The III-S strain synthesized a [[polysaccharide]] capsule that protected itself from the host's [[immune system]], resulting in the death of the host, while the II-R strain did not have that protective capsule and was defeated by the host's immune system. A German bacteriologist, [[Fred Neufeld]], had discovered the three pneumococcal types (Types I, II, and III) and discovered the [[Quellung reaction]] to identify them in vitro.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iwDn7ubDO2kC Lehrer, Steven. Explorers of the Body. 2nd edition 2006 p 44]&lt;/ref&gt; Until Griffith's experiment, bacteriologists believed that the types were fixed and unchangeable, from one generation to another.

In this experiment, [[bacterium|bacteria]] from the III-S strain were killed by heat, and their remains were added to II-R strain bacteria. While neither alone harmed the mice, the combination was able to kill its host. Griffith was also able to isolate both live II-R and live III-S strains of pneumococcus from the blood of these dead mice. Griffith concluded that the type II-R had been "transformed" into the lethal III-S strain by a "transforming principle" that was somehow part of the dead III-S strain bacteria.

Today, we know that the "transforming principle" Griffith observed was the [[DNA]] of the III-s strain bacteria. While the bacteria had been killed, the DNA had survived the heating process and was taken up by the II-R strain bacteria. The III-S strain DNA contains the genes that form the smooth protective polysaccharide capsule. Equipped with this gene, the former II-R strain bacteria were now protected from the host's immune system and could kill the host. The exact nature of the transforming principle (DNA) was verified in the experiments done by [[Avery–MacLeod–McCarty experiment|Avery, McLeod and McCarty]] and by [[Hershey–Chase experiment|Hershey and Chase]].

The '''Hong Kong International Convention for the safe and environmentally sound recycling of ships''', or '''Hong Kong Convention''' is a mulitateral convention adopted in 2009, which has not entered into force. The conference that created the convention was attended by 63 countries, and overseen by the [[International Maritime Organization]] (IMO), which is a specialist agency of the United Nations (U.N).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imo.org/|title=International Maritime Organization|work=imo.org|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The convention has been designed to try to improve the health and safety of current [[ship breaking]] practices. Ship breaking is considered to be "amongst the most dangerous of occupations, with unacceptably high levels of fatalities, injuries and work-related diseases"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/safework/areasofwork/hazardous-work/WCMS_110335/lang--en/index.htm|title=IShip-breaking: a hazardous work|work=ilo.org|accessdate=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[ILO]] as large ships are often beached and then dismantled by hand by workers with very little [[personal protective equipment]] (PPE). This is most common in Asia, with India, Bangladesh, [[China]], and Pakistan holding the largest ship breaking yards.&lt;ref&gt;Mikelis, Nikos.http://www.imo.org/includes/blastDataOnly.asp/data_id%3D23449/shiprecycling.pdf "A statistical overview of ship recycling", September 2007. Retrieved on 22 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hong Kong Convention recognised that [[ship recycling]] is the most environmentally sound way to dispose of a ship at the end of its life, as most of the ship's materials can be reused. However, it sees current methods as unacceptable. The work sees many injuries and fatalities to workers, as they lack the correct [[safety equipment]] to handle the large ship correctly as it is dismantled and most vessels contain a large amount of [[hazardous material]]s such as [[asbestos]], [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]], [[Tributyltin|TBT]], and [[Chlorofluorocarbon|CFCs]], which can also lead to highly life-threatening diseases such as [[mesothelioma]] and lung cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Sites-Types/mesothelioma |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906150654/http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/sites-types/mesothelioma |archivedate=6 September 2010 |df=dmy-all }} Retrieved on 22 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inventory of Hazardous Materials==
The ''Inventory of Hazardous Materials'' has been designed to try to minimise the dangers of these hazards. The Convention defines a hazard as: “any material or substance which is liable to create hazards to [[human health]] and/or the [[Natural environment|environment]]".&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/ships/pdf/Convention.pdf Retrieved on 22 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

All vessels over 500 gross tonnes (GT) that are in commercial service (the convention does not apply to [[warship]]s or [[naval auxiliary]] or ships operating their whole life only in waters subject to the sovereignty or jurisdiction of the State whose flag the ship is entitled to fly) will have to comply with the convention once it comes into force. Each party that does wish to comply must restrict the use of hazardous materials on all ships that fly the flag of that party.&lt;ref&gt;International Maritime Organization http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/ships/pdf/Convention.pdf 'agenda item 8' Retrieved on 11 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

New ships must all carry an Inventory of Hazardous Materials. The inventory will list all 'hazardous materials' on board the vessel, including their amounts and locations. Existing ships must comply no later than five years after the convention comes into force, or prior to being recycled if this occurs before the five-year period. The inventory will remain with a vessel throughout its lifespan, being updated as all new installations enter the ship, as these may potentially contain hazards. The presence of the inventory will then ensure the safety of crew members during the vessel's working life, and also the safety of workers during the recycling process.

==Signature, Ratification and accession==
The convention was open for signature between 1 September 2009 and 31 August 2010, and remained open for accession afterwards. It will enter into force two years after "15 states, representing 40% of the world merchant shipping by gross tonnage, and on average 3% of recycling tonnage for the previous 10 years, have either signed it without reservation as to [[ratification]], acceptance or approval, or have deposited instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession with the Secretary General".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imo.org/Environment/mainframe.asp?topic_id=818 Retrieved on 22 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; None of these conditions was met as of 2017:

==Relation to EU instruments==
The EU Ship Recycling Regulation &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/ships/|title=Ship recycling - Waste - Environment - European Commission|work=europa.eu|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; entered into force on 30 December 2013. Although this regulation closely follows the Hong Kong convention, there are important differences. The Regulation sets out a number of requirements for European ships, European ship owners, ship recycling facilities willing to recycle European ships, and the relevant competent authorities or administrations. It also requires the Commission to adopt a number of acts implementing the Regulation (in particular the European List of ship recycling facilities authorized to recycle ships flying the Union flag). For the Inventory of Hazardous Materials required by the EU regulation, there are additional substances listed as prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52012PC0118|title=EUR-Lex - 52012PC0118 - EN - EUR-Lex|work=europa.eu|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20779">In [[machine learning]], '''hyperparameter optimization''' or tuning is the problem of choosing a set of optimal [[Hyperparameter (machine learning)|hyperparameters]] for a learning algorithm.

The same kind of machine learning model can require different constraints, weights or learning rates to generalize different data patterns. These measures are called hyperparameters, and have to be tuned so that the model can optimally solve the machine learning problem. Hyperparameter optimization finds a tuple of hyperparameters that yields an optimal model which minimizes a predefined [[loss function]] on given independent data.&lt;ref name=abs1502.02127&gt;{{cite arxiv |eprint=1502.02127|last1=Claesen|first1=Marc|title=Hyperparameter Search in Machine Learning|author2=Bart De Moor|class=cs.LG|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The objective function takes a tuple of hyperparameters and returns the associated loss.&lt;ref name=abs1502.02127/&gt; [[Cross-validation (statistics)|Cross-validation]] is often used to estimate this generalization performance.&lt;ref name="bergstra"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bergstra|first1=James|last2=Bengio|first2=Yoshua|year=2012|title=Random Search for Hyper-Parameter Optimization|url=http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume13/bergstra12a/bergstra12a.pdf|journal=J. Machine Learning Research|volume=13|pages=281–305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Approaches ==

=== Grid search ===
The traditional way of performing hyperparameter optimization has been ''grid search'', or a ''parameter sweep'', which is simply an [[Brute-force search|exhaustive searching]] through a manually specified subset of the hyperparameter space of a learning algorithm. A grid search algorithm must be guided by some performance metric, typically measured by [[Cross-validation (statistics)|cross-validation]] on the training set&lt;ref&gt;Chin-Wei Hsu, Chih-Chung Chang and Chih-Jen Lin (2010). [http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/papers/guide/guide.pdf A practical guide to support vector classification]. Technical Report, [[National Taiwan University]].&lt;/ref&gt;
or evaluation on a held-out validation set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal 
| vauthors = Chicco D
| title = Ten quick tips for machine learning in computational biology 
| journal = BioData Mining
| volume = 10
| issue =  35
| pages = 35 
| date = December 2017 
| pmid = 29234465
| doi = 10.1186/s13040-017-0155-3
| pmc= 5721660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the parameter space of a machine learner may include real-valued or unbounded value spaces for certain parameters, manually set bounds and discretization may be necessary before applying grid search.

For example, a typical soft-margin [[support vector machine|SVM]] [[statistical classification|classifier]] equipped with an [[radial basis function kernel|RBF kernel]] has at least two hyperparameters that need to be tuned for good performance on unseen data: a regularization constant ''C'' and a kernel hyperparameter γ. Both parameters are continuous, so to perform grid search, one selects a finite set of "reasonable" values for each, say

:&lt;math&gt;C \in \{10, 100, 1000\}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma \in \{0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0\}&lt;/math&gt;

Grid search then trains an SVM with each pair (''C'', γ) in the [[Cartesian product]] of these two sets and evaluates their performance on a held-out validation set (or by internal cross-validation on the training set, in which case multiple SVMs are trained per pair). Finally, the grid search algorithm outputs the settings that achieved the highest score in the validation procedure.

Grid search suffers from the [[curse of dimensionality]], but is often [[embarrassingly parallel]] because typically the hyperparameter settings it evaluates are independent of each other.&lt;ref name="bergstra"/&gt;

=== Random search ===
{{main|Random search}}

Random Search replaces the exhaustive enumeration of all combinations by selecting them randomly. This can be simply applied to the discrete setting described above, but also generalizes to continuous and mixed spaces. It can outperform Grid search, especially when only a small number of hyperparameters affects the final performance of the machine learning algorithm.&lt;ref name="bergstra" /&gt; In this case, the optimization problem is said to have a low intrinsic dimensionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ziyu|first=Wang|last2=Frank|first2=Hutter|last3=Masrour|first3=Zoghi|last4=David|first4=Matheson|last5=Nando|first5=de Feitas|date=2016|title=Bayesian Optimization in a Billion Dimensions via Random Embeddings|url=http://jair.org/papers/paper4806.html|journal=Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research|language=en|volume=55|pages=361–387|doi=10.1613/jair.4806}}&lt;/ref&gt; Random Search is also [[embarrassingly parallel]], and additionally allows to include prior knowledge by specifying the distribution from which to sample.

=== Bayesian optimization ===
{{main|Bayesian optimization}}

Bayesian optimization is a global optimization method for noisy black-box functions.  Applied to hyperparameter optimization, Bayesian optimization builds a probabilistic model of the function mapping from hyperparameter values to the objective evaluated on a validation set. By iteratively evaluating a promising hyperparameter configuration based on the current model, and then updating it, Bayesian optimization, aims to gather observations revealing as much information as possible about this function and, in particular, the location of the optimum. It tries to balance exploration (hyperparameters for which the outcome is most uncertain) and exploitation (hyperparameters expected close to the optimum). In practice, Bayesian optimization has been shown&lt;ref name="hutter"&gt;{{Citation

=== Gradient-based optimization ===
For specific learning algorithms, it is possible to compute the gradient with respect to hyperparameters and then optimize the hyperparameters using gradient descent. The first usage of these techniques was focused on neural networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Larsen|first1=Jan|last2= Hansen |first2=Lars Kai|last3=Svarer|first3=Claus|last4=Ohlsson|first4=M|title=Design and regularization of neural networks: the optimal use of a validation set|journal=Proceedings of the 1996 IEEE Signal Processing Society Workshop|date=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, these methods have been extended to other models such as [[support vector machine]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Olivier Chapelle |author2=Vladimir Vapnik |author3=Olivier Bousquet |author4=Sayan Mukherjee |title=Choosing multiple parameters for support vector machines |journal=Machine Learning |year=2002 |volume=46 |pages=131–159 |url=http://www.chapelle.cc/olivier/pub/mlj02.pdf | doi = 10.1023/a:1012450327387 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or logistic regression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1 =Chuong B|author2= Chuan-Sheng Foo|author3=Andrew Y Ng|journal = Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 20|title = Efficient multiple hyperparameter learning for log-linear models|year =2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A different approach in order to obtain a gradient with respect to hyperparameters consists in differentiating the steps of an iterative optimization algorithm using  [[automatic differentiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Domke|first1=Justin|title=Generic Methods for Optimization-Based Modeling|journal=Aistats|date=2012|volume=22|url=http://www.jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v22/domke12/domke12.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=abs1502.03492&gt;{{cite arXiv |last1=Maclaurin|first1=Douglas|last2=Duvenaud|first2=David|last3=Adams|first3=Ryan P.|eprint=1502.03492|title=Gradient-based Hyperparameter Optimization through Reversible Learning|class=stat.ML|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evolutionary optimization ===
{{main|Evolutionary algorithm}}

Evolutionary optimization is a methodology for the global optimization of noisy black-box functions. In hyperparameter optimization, evolutionary optimization uses [[evolutionary algorithms]] to search the space of hyperparameters for a given algorithm.&lt;ref name="bergstra11" /&gt; Evolutionary hyperparameter optimization follows a [[Evolutionary algorithm#Implementation|process]] inspired by the biological concept of [[evolution]]:

# Create an initial population of random solutions (i.e., randomly generate tuples of hyperparameters, typically 100+)
# Evaluate the hyperparameters tuples and acquire their [[fitness function]] (e.g., 10-fold [[Cross-validation (statistics)|cross-validation]] accuracy of the machine learning algorithm with those hyperparameters)
# Rank the hyperparameter tuples by their relative fitness
# Replace the worst-performing hyperparameter tuples with new hyperparameter tuples generated through [[crossover (genetic algorithm)|crossover]] and [[mutation (genetic algorithm)|mutation]]
# Repeat steps 2-4 until satisfactory algorithm performance is reached or algorithm performance is no longer improving

'''Internet linguistics''' is a domain of [[linguistics]] advocated by the English linguist [[David Crystal]]. It studies new language styles and forms that have arisen under the influence of the [[Internet]] and of other [[new media]], such as [[Short Message Service]] (SMS) [[text messaging]].&lt;ref name="David Crystal's Scope"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the beginning of [[human-computer interaction]] (HCI) leading to [[computer-mediated communication]] (CMC) and Internet-mediated communication (IMC), experts{{who?|date=May 2018}} have acknowledged that linguistics has a contributing role in it, in terms of web interface and usability. Studying the emerging language on the Internet can help improve conceptual organization, translation and web usability. Such study aims to benefit both linguists and web users.&lt;ref name=" Linguistics and web usability "&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of Internet linguistics can take place through four main perspectives: [[#socp|sociolinguistics]], [[#ep|education]], [[#sp|stylistics]] and [[#ap|applied]] linguistics.&lt;ref name="David Crystal's Scope"/&gt; Further dimensions have developed as a result of further technological advances - which include the development of the Web as [[text corpus | corpus]] and the spread and influence of the stylistic variations brought forth by the spread of the Internet, through the [[mass media]] and through [[literary works]]. In view of the increasing number of users connected to the Internet, the linguistics future of the Internet remains to be determined, as new computer-mediated technologies continue to emerge and people adapt their languages to suit these new media.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt; The Internet continues to play a significant role both in encouraging as well as in diverting attention away from the usage of languages.&lt;ref name="Introduction to Minority Languages, Multimedia and the Web"/&gt;

==Main perspectives==

David Crystal has identified four main perspectives for further investigation – the sociolinguistic perspective, the educational perspective, the stylistic perspective and the applied perspective.&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt; The four perspectives are effectively interlinked and affect one another.

=== {{anchor|socp}}Sociolinguistic perspective ===
This perspective deals with how society views the impact of Internet development on languages.&lt;ref name="David Crystal's Scope" /&gt; The advent of the Internet has revolutionized communication in many ways; it changed the way people communicate and created new platforms with far-reaching social impact. Significant avenues include but are not limited to SMS text messaging, [[e-mails]], [[Online chat|chatgroups]], [[virtual worlds]] and the Web.&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt;

The evolution of these new mediums of communications has raised much concern with regards to the way language is being used. According to Crystal (2005), these concerns are neither without grounds nor unseen in history – it surfaces almost always when a new technology breakthrough influences languages; as seen in the 15th century when [[printing]] was introduced, the 19th century when the [[telephone]] was invented and the 20th century when [[broadcasting]] began to penetrate our society.&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt;

At a personal level, CMC such as SMS Text Messaging and mobile e-mailing ([[push mail]]) has greatly enhanced instantaneous communication.&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt; Some examples include the [[iPhone]] and the [[BlackBerry]].

In schools, it is not uncommon for educators and students to be given personalized school e-mail accounts for communication and interaction purposes.  Classroom discussions are increasingly being brought onto the Internet in the form of discussion forums. For instance, at [[Nanyang Technological University]], students engage in collaborative learning at the university’s portal – edveNTUre, where they participate in discussions on forums and online quizzes and view streaming podcasts prepared by their course instructors among others. [[iTunes U]] in 2008 began to collaborate with universities as they converted the [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] music service into a store that makes available academic lectures and scholastic materials for free – they have partnered more than 600 institutions in 18 countries including [[Oxford University|Oxford]], [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] and [[Yale University|Yale]] Universities.&lt;ref name="iPhone takes on BlackBerry"&gt;{{Cite news

| newspaper = [[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]
| date = 7 March 2008
| accessdate = 2010-10-31}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

These forms of academic social networking and media are slated to rise as educators from all over the world continue to seek new ways to better engage students. It is commonplace for students in [[New York University]] to interact with “guest speakers weighing in via [[Skype]], library staffs providing support via [[instant messaging]], and students accessing library resources from off campus.”&lt;ref name="Universities Use Social Media to Connect"&gt;{{Cite news
| title = Universities Use Social Media to Connect
| first = Peter
| last = Cohen
| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/31/education/31iht-riedsoc.html?_r=1
| newspaper = [[The New York Times]]
| date = 30 March 2010
| accessdate = 2010-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This will affect the way language is used as students and teachers begin to use more of these CMC platforms.&lt;ref name="Universities Use Social Media to Connect"/&gt;

At a professional level, it is a common sight for companies to have their computers and laptops hooked up onto the Internet (via wired and wireless [[Internet connection]]), and for employees to have individual e-mail accounts. This greatly facilitates internal (among staffs of the company) and external (with other parties outside of one’s organization) communication. Mobile communications such as [[smart phones]] are increasingly making their way into the corporate world. For instance, in 2008, Apple announced their intention to actively step up their efforts to help companies incorporate the iPhone into their enterprise environment, facilitated by technological developments in streamlining integrated features (push e-mail, calendar and contact management) using [[ActiveSync]].&lt;ref name="iPhone takes on BlackBerry" /&gt;

In general, these new CMCs that are made possible by the Internet have altered the way people use language – there is heightened informality and consequently a growing fear of its deterioration. However, as David Crystal puts it, these should be seen positively as it reflects the power of the creativity of a language.&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt;

====Themes====

The sociolinguistics of the Internet may also be examined through five interconnected themes.&lt;ref name="Thurlow"&gt;{{cite book

# [[Multilingualism]] – It looks at the prevalence and status of various languages on the Internet.
# [[Language change]] – From a sociolinguistic perspective, language change is influenced by the physical constraints of technology (e.g. typed text) and the shifting social-economic priorities such as globalization. It explores the linguistic changes over time, with emphasis on [[Internet lingo]].
# [[Conversation analysis|Conversation discourse]] – It explores the changes in patterns of social interaction and communicative practice on the Internet.
# Stylistic diffusion – It involves the study of the spread of Internet jargons and related linguistic forms into common usage. As language changes, conversation discourse and stylistic diffusion overlap with the aspect of language stylistics.
#:''See below: [[#sp|Stylistic perspective]]''
# [[Metalanguage]] and [[folk linguistics]] – It involves looking at the way these linguistic forms and changes on the Internet are labelled and discussed (e.g. impact of Internet lingo resulted in the 'death' of the apostrophe and loss of capitalization.)

==={{anchor|ep}}Educational perspective===
The educational perspective of internet linguistics examines the Internet's impact on [[formal language]] use, specifically on [[Standard English]], which in turn affects [[language education]].&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt; The rise and rapid spread of Internet use has brought about new linguistic features specific only to the Internet platform. These include, but are not limited to, an increase in the use of informal written language, inconsistency in written styles and [[Stylistics (linguistics)|stylistics]] and the use of new abbreviations in Internet chats and SMS text messaging, where constraints of technology on word count contributed to the rise of new abbreviations.&lt;ref name="David Crystal's Scope" /&gt; Such [[acronyms]] exist primarily for practical reasons — to reduce the time and effort required to communicate through these mediums apart from technological limitations. Examples of common acronyms include ''[[lol]]'' (for laughing out loud; a general expression of laughter), ''[[SMS language#Common abbreviations|omg]]'' (oh my god) and ''gtg'' (got to go).&lt;ref name="The Influence of Internet on Language and Email Stress"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The educational perspective has been considerably established in the research on the Internet's impact on language education. It is an important and crucial aspect as it affects and involves the education of current and future student generations in the appropriate and timely use of informal language that arises from [[Internet usage]]. There are concerns for the growing infiltration of informal language use and incorrect word use into academic or formal situations, such as the usage of casual words like "guy" or the choice of the word "preclude" in place of "precede" in academic papers by students. There are also issues with spellings and grammar occurring at a higher frequency among students' academic works as noted by educators, with the use of abbreviations such as "u" for "you" and "2" for "to" being the most common.&lt;ref name="No LOL Matter: Cyber lingo shows up in academia"&gt;{{cite news

| last = Hayslett

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguists and professors like Eleanor Johnson suspect that widespread mistakes in writing are strongly connected to Internet usage, where educators have similarly reported new kinds of spelling and grammar mistakes in student works. There is, however, no [[scientific evidence]] to confirm the proposed connection.&lt;ref name="Experts divided over Internet changes to Language"&gt;{{cite news

| first = Rachel
| last = Abrams
| publisher = [[Voanews.com|VOANews]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though there are valid concerns about Internet usage and its impact on students' academic and formal writing, its severity is however enlarged by the informal nature of the new media platforms. [[Naomi Baron|Naomi S. Baron]] (2008)  argues in ''Always On'' that student writings suffer little impact from the use of Internet-mediated communication (IMC) such as internet chat, SMS text messaging and e-mail.&lt;ref name="Always On"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study in 2009 published by the [[British Psychological Society|British Journal of Developmental Psychology]] found that students who regularly texted (sent messages via SMS using a mobile phone) displayed a wider range of vocabulary and this may lead to a positive impact on their reading development.&lt;ref name="Texting improves language skill"&gt;{{cite news

| publisher = BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the use of the Internet resulted in stylistics that are not deemed appropriate in academic and formal language use, it is to be noted that Internet use may not hinder language education but instead aid it. The Internet has proven in different ways that it can provide potential benefits in enhancing language learning, especially in second or [[Foreign language teaching|foreign language learning]]. Language education through the Internet in relation to Internet linguisitics is, most significantly, applied through the communication aspect (use of e-mails, [[discussion forums]], [[Instant messaging|chat messengers]], [[blog]]s, etc.).&lt;ref name="Globalization and Language Education"&gt;{{cite web

| title = Globalization and Language Education

| work = Presentation
| first = Tim
| last = Xie}}&lt;/ref&gt;
IMC allows for greater interaction between language learners and native speakers of the language, providing for greater error corrections and better learning opportunities of standard language, in the process allowing the picking up of specific skills such as negotiation and persuasion.&lt;ref name="Globalization and Language Education"/&gt;

==={{anchor|sp}}Stylistic perspective===
This perspective examines how the Internet and its related technologies have encouraged new and different forms of creativity in language, especially in literature.&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt; It looks at the Internet as a medium through which new language phenomena have arisen. This new mode of language is interesting to study because it is an amalgam of both spoken and written languages. For example, traditional writing is static compared to the dynamic nature of the new language on the Internet where words can appear in different colors and font sizes on the computer screen.&lt;ref name=" Linguists See Internet Lingo as Cultural Catalyst "&gt;{{Cite news
 |last        = Cook
 |first       = Franklin

 |archivedate = 2010-02-13
 |df          = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, this new mode of language also contains other elements not found in natural languages. One example is the concept of framing found in e-mails and discussion forums. In replying to e-mails, people generally use the sender’s e-mail message as a frame to write their own messages. They can choose to respond to certain parts of an e-mail message while leaving other bits out. In discussion forums, one can start a new thread and anyone regardless of their physical location can respond to the idea or thought that was set down through the Internet. This is something that is usually not found in written language.&lt;ref name=" Linguists See Internet Lingo as Cultural Catalyst"/&gt;

Future research also includes new varieties of expressions that the Internet and its various technologies are constantly producing and their effects not only on written languages but also their spoken forms.&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt; The communicative style of Internet language is best observed in the CMC channels below, as there are often attempts to overcome technological restraints such as transmission time lags and to re-establish social cues that are often vague in written text.&lt;ref name="Thurlow"/&gt;

====Mobile phones====
{{see also|mobile phone}}
Mobile phones (also called "cell phones") have an expressive potential beyond their basic communicative functions. This can be seen in text-messaging poetry competitions such as the one held by [[The Guardian]].&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt; The 160-character limit imposed by the cell phone has motivated users to exercise their linguistic creativity to overcome them.  A similar example of new technology with character constraints is [[Twitter]], which has a 280-character limit.  There have been debates as to whether these new abbreviated forms introduced in users’ [[wikt:Special:Search/tweet|Tweet]]s are "lazy" or whether they are creative fragments of communication. Despite the ongoing debate, there is no doubt that Twitter has contributed to the linguistic landscape with new lingoes and also brought about a new dimension of communication.&lt;ref name=" From Telegraph to Twitter: The Language of the Short Form "&gt;{{Cite news

 |df          = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cell phone has also created a new literary genre – [[cell phone novels]]. A typical cell phone novel consists of several chapters which readers download in short installments. These novels are in their "raw" form as they do not go through editing processes like traditional novels. They are written in short sentences, similar to text-messaging.&lt;ref name="Thumbs Race as Japan’s Best Sellers Go Cellular"&gt;{{Cite news

| accessdate = 2010-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Authors of such novels are also able to receive feedbacks and new ideas from their readers through e-mails or online feedback channels. Unlike traditional novel writing, readers’ ideas sometimes get incorporated into the storyline or authors may also decide to change their story’s plot according to the demand and popularity of their novel (typically gauged by the number of download hits).&lt;ref name="Cell Phones Put to Novel Use"&gt;{{cite news

====Blogs====
{{see also|blog}}

Blogging has brought about new ways of writing diaries and from a linguistic perspective, the language used in blogs is "in its most 'naked' form",&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt; published for the world to see without undergoing the formal editing process. This is what makes blogs stand out because almost all other forms of printed language have gone through some form of editing and standardization.&lt;ref name="Language and the Internet"&gt;{{cite book |last=Crystal |first=David

====Virtual worlds====

Virtual worlds provide insights into how users are adapting the usage of natural language for communication within these new mediums. The Internet language that has arisen through user interactions in text-based chatrooms and [[computer-simulated]] worlds has led to the development of slangs within digital communities. Examples of these include [[pwn]] and [[noob]]. [[Emoticons]] are further examples of how users have adapted different expressions to suit the limitations of cyberspace communication, one of which is the "loss of emotivity".&lt;ref name="On The Linguistic Nature of Cyberspace and Virtual Communities"&gt;{{cite journal

Communication in niches such as [[role-playing game]]s (RPG) of [[MUDs|Multi-User domains]] (MUDs) and virtual worlds is highly interactive, with emphasis on speed, brevity and spontaneity.  As a result, CMC is generally more vibrant, volatile, unstructured and open. There are often complex organization of sequences and exchange structures evident in the connection of conversational strands and short turns. Some of the CMC strategies used include capitalization for words such as ''EMPHASIS'', usage of symbols such as the asterisk to enclose words as seen in ''*stress*'' and the creative use of punctuation like ''???!?!?!?''.&lt;ref name="Thurlow"/&gt; Symbols are also used for discourse functions, such as the asterisk as a [[Conversation analysis#Repair|conversational repair]] marker and arrows and carats as [[deixis]] and [[referent]] markers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collister|first=Lauren B.|date=2012-03-01|title=The discourse deictics ∧ and &lt;-- in a World of Warcraft community|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211695812000050|journal=Discourse, Context &amp; Media|volume=1|issue=1|pages=9–19|doi=10.1016/j.dcm.2012.05.002|archive-url=http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/17348/|archive-date=21 Feb 2013}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collister|first=Lauren Brittany|date=2011-02-01|title=*-repair in Online Discourse|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216610003152|journal=Journal of Pragmatics|series=The Language of Space and Time|volume=43|issue=3|pages=918–921|doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.09.025|archive-url=http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/20621/|archive-date=21 Feb 2014}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides contributing to these new forms in language, virtual worlds are also being used to teach languages. [[Virtual world language learning]] provides students with simulations of real-life environments, allowing them to find creative ways to improve their language skills. Virtual worlds are good tools for language learning among the younger learners because they already see such places as a "natural place to learn and play".&lt;ref name=" Language Teaching Gains Second Life: Virtual Worlds Offer New Methods to Teach Languages "&gt;{{Cite press release

====E-mail====
{{See also|email}}

One of the most popular Internet-related technologies to be studied under this perspective is e-mail, which has expanded the stylistics of languages in many ways. A study done on the linguistic profile of e-mails has shown that there is a hybrid of speech and writing styles in terms of format, grammar and style.&lt;ref name="baron"&gt;{{cite journal

| accessdate = 2010-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often related to informality as it feels temporary and can be deleted easily. However, as this medium of communication matures, e-mail is no longer confined to sending informal messages between friends and relatives. Instead, business correspondences are increasingly being carried out through e-mails. Job seekers are also using e-mails to send their resumes to potential employers. The result of a move towards more formal usages will be a medium representing a range of formal and informal stylistics.&lt;ref name="Language and the Internet"/&gt;

While e-mail has been blamed for students’ increased usage of informal language in their written work, David Crystal argues that e-mail is "not a threat, for language education" because e-mail with its array of stylistic expressiveness can act as a domain for language learners to make their own linguistic choices responsibly. Furthermore, the younger generation’s high propensity for using e-mail may improve their writing and communication skills because of the efforts they are making to formulate their thoughts and ideas, albeit through a digital medium.&lt;ref name=" Say so long to traditional letter writing "/&gt;

====Instant messaging====
{{See also|instant messaging}}

Like other forms of online communication, instant messaging has also developed its own acronyms and short forms. However, instant messaging is quite different from e-mail and chatgroups because it allows participants to interact with one another in real-time while conversing in private.&lt;ref name="7 things you should know about…Instant Messaging "&gt;{{Cite journal

This increased degree of intimacy allows greater informality in language and "typographical idiosyncrasies". There are also greater occurrences of stylistic variation because there can be a very wide age gap between participants. For example, a granddaughter can catch up with her grandmother through instant messaging. Unlike chatgroups where participants come together with shared interests, there is no pressure to conform in language here.&lt;ref name="Language and the Internet"/&gt;

==={{anchor|ap}}Applied perspective===
[[File:Language on internet.JPG|thumb|alt=|Source: [http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats7.htm Internet World Stats]]]
The applied perspective views the linguistic exploitation of the Internet in terms of its communicative capabilities – the good and the bad.&lt;ref name="David Crystal's Scope" /&gt; The Internet provides a platform where users can experience multilingualism. Although English is still the dominant language used on the Internet, other languages are gradually increasing in their number of users.&lt;ref name="Thurlow" /&gt; The [[Global Internet usage]] page provides some information on the number of users of the Internet by language, nationality and geography. This multilingual environment continues to increase in diversity as more language communities become connected to the Internet. The Internet is thus a platform where minority and [[endangered language]]s can seek to revive their language use and/or create awareness. This can be seen in two instances where it provides these languages opportunities for progress in two important regards - [[language documentation]] and [[language revitalization]].&lt;ref name="David Crystal's Scope" /&gt;

====Language documentation====
{{See also|Language documentation}}
Firstly, the Internet facilitates language documentation. Digital archives of media such as audio and video recordings not only help to preserve language documentation, but also allows for global dissemination through the Internet.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publicity about endangered languages, such as Webster (2003) has helped to spur a worldwide interest in linguistic documentation.

Foundations such as the Hans Rausing Endangered Languages Project (HRELP), funded by Arcadia also help to develop the interest in linguistic documentation. The HRELP is a project that seeks to document endangered languages, preserve and disseminate documentation materials among others. The materials gathered are made available online under its Endangered Languages Archive (ELAR) program.

Other online materials that support language documentation include the Language Archive Newsletter which provides news and articles about topics in endangered languages. The web version of Ethnologue also provides brief information of all of the world’s known living languages. By making resources and information of endangered languages and language documentation available on the Internet, it allows researchers to build on these materials and hence preserve endangered languages.

====Language revitalization====
{{See also|language revitalization}}

Secondly, the Internet facilitates language revitalization. Throughout the years, the digital environment has developed in various sophisticated ways that allow for virtual contact. From e-mails, chats to instant messaging, these virtual environments have helped to bridge the spatial distance between communicators. The use of e-mails has been adopted in language courses to encourage students to communicate in various styles such as conference-type formats and also to generate discussions.&lt;ref name="Singhal"&gt;{{cite journal

| first = Meena
| last = Singhal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the use of e-mails facilitates language revitalization in the sense that speakers of a minority language who moved to a location where their native language is not being spoken can take advantage of the Internet to communicate with their family and friends, thus maintaining the use of their native language. With the development and increasing use of telephone broadband communication such as [[Skype]], language revitalization through the internet is no longer restricted to literate users.&lt;ref name="David Crystal's Scope" /&gt;

Hawaiian educators have been taking advantage of the Internet in their language revitalization programs.&lt;ref name="Warschauer"&gt;{{cite journal

The content, interface and menus of the system are entirely in the Hawaiian language. It is installed throughout the immersion school system and includes components for e-mails, chat, dictionary and online newspaper among others. In higher institutions such as colleges and universities where the Leoki system is not yet installed, the educators make use of other software and Internet tools such as Daedalus Interchange, e-mails and the Web to connect students of Hawaiian language with the broader community.&lt;ref name="Warschauer2"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another use of the Internet includes having students of minority languages write about their native cultures in their native languages for distant audiences. Also, in an attempt to preserve their language and culture, [[Occitan]] speakers have been taking advantage of the Internet to reach out to other Occitan speakers from around the world.  These methods provide reasons for using the minority languages by communicating in it.&lt;ref name="Wright"&gt;{{cite journal

====Exploitation of the Internet====
::''See also: [[Forensic linguistics]]''

The Internet can also be exploited for activities such as [[terrorism]], [[internet fraud]] and [[pedophilia]]. In recent years, there has been an increase in crimes that involved the use of the Internet such as e-mails and [[Internet Relay Chat]] (IRC), as it is relatively easy to remain anonymous.&lt;ref name="BAAS"&gt;{{cite news

From a forensic linguistic point of view, there are many potential areas to explore. While developing a chat room [[Content-control software|child protection procedure]] based on search terms filtering is effective, there is still minimal linguistically orientated literature to facilitate the task.&lt;ref name="David Crystal's Scope" /&gt; In other areas, it is observed that the [[Semantic Web]] has been involved in tasks such as personal [[data protection]], which helps to prevent fraud.&lt;ref name="Ryan Lee"&gt;{{cite book

==Dimensions==

The dimensions covered in this section include looking at the Web as a corpus and issues of language identification and normalization. The impacts of internet linguistics on everyday life are examined under the spread and influence of Internet stylistics, trends of language change on the Internet and conversation discourse.

===The Web as a corpus===

With the Web being a huge reservoir of data and resources, language scientists and technologists are increasingly turning to the web for language data.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"&gt;{{Cite journal

It was met with much controversy as they lacked theoretical integrity leading to much skepticism of their role in the field,&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt; until the publication of the journal ‘Using Large Corpora’ in 1993&lt;ref name="computational linguistics using large corpora"&gt;{{Cite journal

====Themes====

There has been much discussion about the possible developments in the arena of the Web as a corpus. The development of using the web as a data source for word sense disambiguation was brought forward in The EU MEANING project in 2002.&lt;ref name="rigau000"&gt;{{Cite conference

In areas of [[language modeling]], the Web has been used to address data sparseness. Lexical statistics have been gathered for resolving prepositional phrase attachments,&lt;ref name="volk000"&gt;{{Cite conference

In areas of information retrieval, a Web track was integrated as a component in the community’s TREC evaluation initiative. The sample of the Web used for this exercise amount to around 100GB, compromising of largely documents in the .gov top level domain.&lt;ref name="hawking000"&gt;{{Cite conference

====British National Corpus====
{{See also|British National Corpus}}

The [[British National Corpus]] contains ample information on the dominant meanings and usage patterns for the 10,000 words that forms the core of English.

The number of words in the British National Corpus (ca 100 million) is sufficient for many empirical strategies for learning about language for linguists and lexicographers,&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="baker001"&gt;{{Cite conference

However, for some other purposes, it is insufficient, as an outcome of the [[Zipfian distribution|Zipfian]] nature of word frequencies. Because the bulk of the lexical stock occurs less than 50 times in the British National Corpus, it is insufficient for statistically stable conclusions about such words. Furthermore, for some rarer words, rare meanings of common words, and combinations of words, no data has been found. Researchers find that probabilistic models of language based on very large quantities of data are better than ones based on estimates from smaller, cleaner data sets.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt;

====The multilingual Web====

{{Update||date=March 2017|inaccurate=yes|talk=The data about percentage of  languages on internet pages is from year 2000 and is no longer accurate.}}

The Web is clearly a multilingual corpus.&lt;ref&gt;Ivković, D. (2013). The Eurovision Song Contest on YouTube: A corpus-based analysis of language attitudes. Language@Internet, 10, article 1. (urn:nbn:de:0009-7-35977)&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that 71% of the pages (453 million out of 634 million Web pages indexed by the Excite engine) were written in English, followed by Japanese (6.8%), German (5.1%), French (1.8%), Chinese (1.5%), Spanish (1.1%), Italian (0.9%), and Swedish (0.7%).&lt;ref name="xu000"&gt;{{Cite conference

A test to find contiguous words like ‘deep breath’ revealed 868,631 Web pages containing the terms in [[AlltheWeb]]. The number found through the search engines are more than three times the counts generated by the British National Corpus, indicating the significant size of the English corpus available on the Web.

The massive size of text available on the Web can be seen in the analysis of controlled data in which corpora of different languages were mixed in various proportions. The estimated Web size in words by [[AltaVista]] saw English at the top of the list with 76,598,718,000 words. The next is German, with 7,035,850,000 words along with 6 other languages with over a billion hits. Even languages with fewer hits on the Web such as Slovenian, Croatian, Malay, and Turkish have more than one hundred million words on the Web.&lt;ref name="grenstette000"&gt;{{Cite conference

====Challenges====

In areas of language modeling, there are limitations on the applicability of any language model as the statistics for different types of text will be different.&lt;ref name="biber000"&gt;{{Cite journal
 | title = Using register-diversified corpora for general language studies

}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a language technology application is put into use (applied to a new text type), it is not certain that the language model will fare in the same way as how it would when applied to the training corpus. It is found that there are substantial variations in model performance when the training corpus changes.&lt;ref name="sekine000"&gt;{{Cite conference

  | booktitle = Proceedings of the Fifth Conference on Applied Natural Language Processing
  | place = Washington, DC
  | pages = 96–102
  | year = 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This lack of theory types limits the assessment of the usefulness of language-modeling work.

As Web texts are easily produced (in terms of cost and time) and with many different authors working on them, it often results in little concern for accuracy. Grammatical and typographical errors are regarded as “erroneous” forms that cause the Web to be a dirty corpus. Nonetheless, it may still be useful even with some noise.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt;

The issue of whether [[sublanguage]]s should be included remains unsettled. Proponents of it argue that with all sublanguages removed, it will result in an impoverished view of language. Since language is made up of lexicons, grammar and a wide array of different sublanguages, they should be included. However, it is not until recently that it became a viable option. Striking a middle ground by including some sublanguages is contentious because it’s an arbitrary issue of which to include and which not.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt;

The decision of what to include in a corpus lies with corpus developers, and it has been done so with pragmatism.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt; The desiderata and criteria used for the British National Corpus serves as a good model for a general-purpose, general-language corpus&lt;ref name="atkins001"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the focus of being representative replaced with being balanced.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt;

Search engines such as [[Google]] serves as a default means of access to the Web and its wide array of linguistics resources. However, for linguists working in the field of corpora, there presents a number of challenges. This includes the limited instances that are presented by the search engines (1,000 or 5,000 maximum); insufficient context for each instance (Google provides a fragment of around ten words); results selected according to criteria that are distorted (from a linguistic point of view) as search term in titles and headings often occupy the top results slots; inability to allow searches to be specified according to linguistic criteria, such as the citation form for a word, or word class; unreliability of statistics, with results varying according to search engine load and many other factors. At present, in view of the conflicts of priorities among the different stakeholders, the best solution is for linguists to attempt to correct these problems by themselves. This will then lead to a large number of possibilities opening in the area of harnessing the rich potential of the Web.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt;

====Representation====

Despite the sheer size of the Web, it may still not be representative of all the languages and domains in the world, and neither are other corpora. However, the huge quantities of text, in numerous languages and language types on a huge range of topics makes it a good starting point that opens up to a large number of possibilities in the study of corpora.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt;

===Impact of its spread and influence===

Stylistics arising from Internet usage has spread beyond the new media into other areas and platforms, including but not limited to, [[films]], [[music]] and [[literary works]]. The infiltration of Internet stylistics is important as mass audiences are exposed to the works, reinforcing certain Internet specific language styles which may not be acceptable in standard or more formal forms of language.

Apart from internet slang, grammatical errors and typographical errors are features of writing on the Internet and other CMC channels. As users of the Internet gets accustomed to these errors, it progressively infiltrates into everyday language use, in both written and spoken forms.&lt;ref name="David Crystal's Scope" /&gt; It is also common to witness such errors in mass media works, from typographical errors in news articles to grammatical errors in advertisements and even internet slang in drama dialogues.

The more the internet is incorporated into daily life, the greater the impact it has on formal language. This is especially true in modern Language Arts classes through the use of smart phones, tablets, and social media. Students are exposed to the language of the internet more than ever, and as such, the grammatical structure and slang of the internet are bleeding into their formal writing. Full immersion into a language is always the best way to learn it. Mark Lester in his book ''&lt;u&gt;Teaching Grammar and Usage&lt;/u&gt;'' states, “The biggest single problem that basic writers have in developing successful strategies for coping with errors is simply their lack of exposure to formal written English...We would think it absurd to expect a student to master a foreign language without extensive exposure to it.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Teaching Grammar and Usage|last = Lester|first = Mark|publisher = Allyn and Bacon|year = 2001|isbn = 0205306551|location = Boston|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since students are immersed in internet language, that is the form and structure they are mirroring.

==== Mass media ====

There has been instances of television advertisements using Internet slang, reinforcing the penetration of Internet stylistics in everyday language use. For example, in the [[Cingular Wireless|Cingular]] commercial in the United States, acronyms such as "BFF Jill" (which means "Best Friend Forever, Jill") were used. More businesses have adopted the use of Internet slang in their advertisements as the more people are growing up using the Internet and other CMC platforms, in an attempt to relate and connect to them better.&lt;ref name="Using Internet Slang in Spoken Conversation: LOL!"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such commercials have received relatively enthusiastic feedback from its audiences.&lt;ref name="Using Internet Slang in Spoken Conversation: LOL!"/&gt;

The use of [[Internet lingo]] has also spread into the arena of music, significantly seen in [[popular music]]. A recent example is [[Trey Songz|Trey Songz's]] lyrics for "LOL :-)", which incorporated many Internet lingo and mentions of Twitter and texting.&lt;ref name="Trey Songz LOL"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.treysongz.com/music/lol-ft-gucci-mane-soulja-boy/ | title = LOL :-) Ft. Gucci Mane &amp; Soulja Boy Tell 'Em | work = Song | first = Trey | last = Songz | authorlink = Trey Songz | publisher = Trey Songz| accessdate = 2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spread of Internet linguistics is also present in [[films]] made by both commercial and [[independent filmmakers]]. Though primarily screened at [[film festivals]], DVDs of independent films are often available for purchase over the internet including paid-live-streamings, making access to films more easily available for the public.&lt;ref name="LOL - The Movie"&gt;{{cite video

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The very nature of commercial films being screened at public cinemas allows for the wide exposure to the mainstream mass audience, resulting in a faster and wider spread of Internet slangs. The latest commercial film is titled "LOL" (acronym for ''Laugh Out Loud'' or ''Laughing Out Loud''), starring [[Miley Cyrus]] and [[Demi Moore]].&lt;ref name="Miley Cyrus' Movie 'LOL' Picked Up By Distributor"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of internet slangs is not limited to the English language but extends to other languages as well. The [[Korean language]] has incorporated the English alphabet in the formation of its slang, while others were formed from common misspellings arising from fast typing. The new [[Korean slang]] is further reinforced and brought into everyday language use by television shows such as [[soap operas]] or comedy dramas like “[[High Kick Through the Roof]]” released in 2009.&lt;ref name="Korean Language in Contemporary Society"&gt;[[Korean Language in Contemporary Society]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Linguistic future of the Internet==

With the emergence of greater computer/Internet mediated communication systems, coupled with the readiness with which people adapt to meet the new demands of a more technologically sophisticated world, it is expected that users will continue to remain under pressure to alter their language use to suit the new dimensions of communication.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt;

As the number of Internet users increase rapidly around the world, the cultural background, linguistic habits and language differences among users are brought into the Web at a much faster pace. These individual differences among Internet users are predicted to significantly impact the future of Internet linguistics, notably in the aspect of the multilingual web. As seen from 2000 to 2010, Internet penetration has experienced its greatest growth in non-English speaking countries such as China, India and Africa,&lt;ref name="Internet Usage Statistics"&gt;{{cite web

Also, the interaction between English and other languages is predicted to be an important area of study.&lt;ref&gt;Ivkovic, D., &amp; Lotherington, H. (2009). Multilingualism in cyberspace: Conceptualising the virtual linguistic landscape. International Journal of Multilingualism, 6(1), 17-36.&lt;/ref&gt; As global users interact with each other, possible references to different languages may continue to increase, resulting in formation of new Internet stylistics that spans across languages. Chinese and Korean languages have already experienced English language's infiltration leading to the formation of their multilingual Internet lingo.&lt;ref name="A Comparison of English and Chinese Internet Language"&gt;{{cite web

At current state, the Internet provides a form of education and promotion for minority languages. However, similar to how cross-language interaction has resulted in English language's infiltration into Chinese and Korean languages to form new slangs,&lt;ref name="A Comparison of English and Chinese Internet Language" /&gt; minority languages are also affected by the more common languages used on the Internet (such as English and Spanish). While language interaction can cause a loss in the authentic standard of minority languages, familiarity of the majority language can also affect the minority languages in adverse ways.&lt;ref name="Introduction to Minority Languages, Multimedia and the Web"&gt;{{cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26341">'''Learned helplessness''' is behavior that occurs when the subject endures repeatedly painful or otherwise aversive stimuli which it is unable to escape from or avoid. After such experiences, the organism often fails to learn or accept "escape" or "avoidance" in new situations where such behavior is likely to be effective.  In other words, the organism learned that it is helpless. In situations where there is a presence of aversive stimuli, it has accepted that it has lost control and thus gives up trying, even as changing circumstances offer a method of relief from said stimuli. Such an organism is said to have acquired learned helplessness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carlson |first=Neil R. |title=Psychology the science of behavior |year=2010 |publisher=Pearson Canada |pages=409 |isbn=978-0-205-69918-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1380861/learned-helplessness|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|author=Nolen, J.L.|title=Learned helplessness|accessdate=January 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  '''Learned helplessness theory''' is the view that [[clinical depression]] and related [[mental illness]]es may result from such real or perceived absence of control over the outcome of a situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Seligman |first=M. E. P. |year=1975 |title=Helplessness: On Depression, Development, and Death |location=San Francisco |publisher=W. H. Freeman |isbn=0-7167-2328-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundation of research and theory==

===Early key experiments===
American psychologist [[Martin Seligman]] initiated research on learned helplessness in 1967 at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] as an extension of his interest in depression.&lt;ref name="Seligman, M. E. P. 1972"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Seligman | first1 = M. E. P. | year = 1972 | title = Learned helplessness | url = | journal = Annual Review of Medicine | volume = 23 | issue = 1| pages = 407–412 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.me.23.020172.002203 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This research was later expanded through experiments by Seligman and others. One of the first was an experiment by Seligman &amp; Maier:  In Part 1 of this study, three groups of dogs were placed in harnesses. Group 1 dogs were simply put in a harnesses for a period of time and were later released. Groups 2 and 3 consisted of "[[Yoke|yoked pairs]]". Dogs in Group 2 were given electric shocks at random times, which the dog could end by pressing a lever. Each dog in Group 3 was paired with a Group 2 dog; whenever a Group 2 dog got a shock, its paired dog in Group 3 got a shock of the same intensity and duration, but its lever did not stop the shock. To a dog in Group 3, it seemed that the shock ended at random, because it was his paired dog in Group 2 that was causing it to stop. Thus, for Group 3 dogs, the shock was "inescapable".

In Part 2 of the experiment the same three groups of dogs were tested in a shuttle-box apparatus (a chamber containing two rectangular compartments divided by a barrier a few inches high). All of the dogs could escape shocks on one side of the box by jumping over a low partition to the other side. The dogs in Groups 1 and 2 quickly learned this task and escaped the shock. Most of the Group 3 dogs – which had previously learned that nothing they did had any effect on shocks – simply lay down passively and whined when they were shocked.&lt;ref name="Seligman, M. E. P. 1972"/&gt;

In a second experiment later that year with new groups of dogs, Overmier and Seligman ruled out the possibility that, instead of learned helplessness, the Group 3 dogs failed to avert in the second part of the test because they had learned some behavior that interfered with "escape". To prevent such interfering behavior, Group 3 dogs were immobilized with a paralyzing drug ([[curare]]), and underwent a procedure similar to that in Part 1 of the Seligman and Maier experiment. When tested as before in Part 2, these Group 3 dogs exhibited helplessness as before. This result serves as an indicator for the ruling out of the interference hypothesis.

From these experiments, it was thought that there was to be only one cure for helplessness. In Seligman's hypothesis, the dogs do not try to escape because they expect that nothing they do will stop the shock. To change this expectation, experimenters physically picked up the dogs and moved their legs, replicating the actions the dogs would need to take in order to escape from the electrified grid. This had to be done at least twice before the dogs would start willfully jumping over the barrier on their own. In contrast, threats, rewards, and observed demonstrations had no effect on the "helpless" Group 3 dogs.&lt;ref name="Seligman, M. E. P. 1972" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Seligman, M. E. P., 1975 Scientific American&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later experiments===
Later experiments have served to confirm the depressive effect of feeling a lack of control over an aversive stimulus. For example, in one experiment, humans performed mental tasks in the presence of distracting noise. Those who could use a switch to turn off the noise rarely bothered to do so, yet they performed better than those who could not turn off the noise. Simply being aware of this option was enough to substantially counteract the noise effect.&lt;ref name="Learned helplessness in man"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hiroto | first1 = D.S. | last2 = Seligman | first2 = M.E.P. | year = 1975 | title = Generality of learned helplessness in man | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 31 | issue = | pages = 311–27 | doi=10.1037/h0076270}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, an animal study&lt;ref&gt;Varela JA, Wang J, Varnell AL &amp; Donald C. Cooper (2011) Control over stressful stimuli induces plasticity of individual prefrontal cortical neurons: A conductance-based neural simulation. http://www.neuro-cloud.net/nature-precedings/varela Available from Nature Precedings {{DOI|10.1038/npre.2011.6267.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that animals with control over stressful stimuli exhibited changes in the excitability of certain neurons in the prefrontal cortex.  Animals that lacked control failed to exhibit this neural effect and showed signs consistent with learned helplessness and social anxiety.

==Expanded theories==
Research has found that a human's reaction to feeling a lack of control differs both between individuals and between situations.  i.e. learned helplessness sometimes remains specific to one situation but at other times generalizes across situations.&lt;ref name="Learned helplessness in man"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Peterson |first=C. |last2=Park |first2=C. |year=1998 |chapter=Learned helplessness and explanatory style |editor1-first=D.

Y. |last2=Seligman |first2=M. E. P. |last3=Teasdale |first3=J.

P. |year=1995 |title=Learned Helplessness: A Theory for the Age of Personal Control |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-504467-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such people can often be helped to learn a more realistic explanatory style by [[cognitive behavioral therapy]], a therapy heavily endorsed by Seligman.

[[Bernard Weiner]] proposed a detailed account of the attributional approach to learned helplessness. His attribution theory includes the dimensions of globality/specificity, stability/instability, and [[Locus of control|internality/externality]]&lt;ref&gt;Weiner, B. (1986). An attributional theory of motivation and emotion. New York: Springer-Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt;:

* A ''global attribution'' occurs when the individual believes that the cause of negative events is consistent across different contexts.
** A ''specific attribution'' occurs when the individual believes that the cause of a negative event is unique to a particular situation.
* A ''stable attribution'' occurs when the individual believes the cause to be consistent across time.
** An u''nstable attribution'' occurs when the individual thinks that the cause is specific to one point in time.
* An ''external attribution'' assigns causality to situational or external factors,
** while an ''internal attribution'' assigns causality to factors within the person.&lt;ref name="Helplessness in humans" /&gt;

==Neurobiological perspective==

Research has shown that increased 5-HT ([[serotonin]]) activity in the [[dorsal raphe nucleus]] plays a critical role in learned helplessness. Other key brain regions that are involved with the expression of helpless behavior include the [[basolateral amygdala]], central nucleus of the [[amygdala]] and
[[Stria terminalis#Bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST)|bed nucleus of the stria terminalis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hammack|first1=Sayamwong|last2=Cooper|first2=Matthew|last3=Lezak|first3=Kimberly|title=Overlapping neurobiology of learned helplessness and conditioned defeat: Implications for PTSD and mood disorders|doi=10.1016/j.neuropharm.2011.02.024|work=original paper|publisher=University of Vermont}}&lt;!--|accessdate=16 November 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Activity in medial prefrontal cortex, dorsal hippocampus, septum and hypothalamus has also been observed during states of helplessness.

In the article, "Exercise, Learned Helplessness, and the Stress-Resistant Brain", Benjamin N. Greenwood and Monika Fleshner discuss how exercise might prevent stress-related disorders such as anxiety and depression. They show evidence that running wheel exercise prevents learned helplessness behaviors in rats.&lt;ref&gt;idem, p82&lt;/ref&gt;  They suggest that the amount of exercise may not be as important as simply exercising at all. The article also discusses the neurocircuitry of learned helplessness, the role of serotonin (or 5-HT), and the exercise-associated neural adaptations that may contribute to the stress-resistant brain. However, the authors finally conclude that "The underlying neurobiological mechanisms of this effect, however, remain unknown. Identifying the mechanisms by which exercise prevents learned helplessness could shed light on the complex neurobiology of depression and anxiety and potentially lead to novel strategies for the prevention of stress-related mood disorders".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenwood|first=Benjamin|title=Excerise, Learned Helplessness, and the Stress-Resistant Brain|url=http://www.exuberantanimal.com/web/library/case_for_the_body_resources/neuro/Greenwood-2008_Exercise%20and%20the%20brain.pdf|pmid=18300002|work=original paper|publisher=University of Colorado-Boulder and Department of Integrative Physiology|accessdate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health implications==
People who perceive events as uncontrollable show a variety of symptoms that threaten their mental and physical well-being.  They experience stress, they often show disruption of emotions demonstrating passivity or aggressivity, and they can also have difficulty performing cognitive tasks such as problem-solving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roth | first1 = S. | year = 1980 | title = A revised model of learned helplessness in humans | url = | journal = Journal of Personality | volume = 48 | issue = | pages = 103–33 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1980.tb00969.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wortman, C.B. &amp; Brehm, J.W.

===Depression===
[[Abnormal psychology|Abnormal]] and [[Cognitive psychology|cognitive]] psychologists have found a strong correlation between depression-like symptoms and learned helplessness in laboratory animals.&lt;ref name="Stressors"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Maier S.F. |author2=Watkins, L.R. |year=2005 |title=Stressor controllability and learned helplessness: The roles of the dorsal raphe nucleus, serotonin, and corticotropin-releasing factor |url=http://www.uvm.edu/~shammack/Maier%20and%20Watkins%202005%20review.pdf |website=uvm.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young adults and middle-aged parents with a pessimistic explanatory style often suffer from depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chang | first1 = E.C. | last2 = Sanna | first2 = L.J. | year = 2007 | title = Affectivity and psychological adjustment across two adult generations: Does pessimistic explanatory style still matter? | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 43 | issue = | pages = 1149–59 | doi=10.1016/j.paid.2007.03.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; They tend to be poor at problem-solving and [[cognitive restructuring]], and also tend to demonstrate poor job satisfaction and interpersonal relationships in the workplace.&lt;ref name="life stress"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Welbourne | first1 = J.L. | last2 = Eggerth | first2 = D. | last3 = Hartley | first3 = T.A. | last4 = Andrew | first4 = M.E. | last5 = Sanchez | first5 = F. | year = 2007 | title = Coping strategies in the workplace: Relationships with attributional style and job satisfaction | url = | journal = Journal of Vocational Behavior | volume = 70 | issue = | pages = 312–25 | doi=10.1016/j.jvb.2006.10.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those with a pessimistic style also tend to have weakened [[immune systems]], having not only increased vulnerability to minor ailments (e.g., cold, fever) and major illness (e.g., heart attack, cancers), but also poorer recovery from health problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bennett | first1 = K.K. | last2 = Elliott | first2 = M. | year = 2005 | title = Pessimistic explanatory style and Cardiac Health: What is the relation and the mechanism that links them? | url = | journal = Basic and Applied Social Psychology | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 239–48 | doi=10.1207/s15324834basp2703_5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social impact===
Learned helplessness can be a factor in a wide range of social situations.
*In [[Psychological_abuse|emotionally abusive relationships]], the victim often develops learned helplessness.  This occurs when the victim confronts and/or tries to leave the abuser, only to have the abuser dismiss or trivialize the victims feelings, pretend to care but not change, and/or impede the victim from leaving {{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}.   
*The motivational effect of learned helplessness is often seen in the classroom.  Students who repeatedly fail may conclude that they are incapable of improving their performance, and this attribution keeps them from trying to succeed, which results in increased helplessness, continued failure, loss of self-esteem and other social consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Stipek, D.E.P. (1988). Motivation to learning. Allyn &amp; Bacon: Boston.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ramirez | first1 = E. | last2 = Maldonado | first2 = A. | last3 = Martos | first3 = R. | year = 1992 | title = Attribution modulate immunization against learned helplessness in humans | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 62 | issue = | pages = 139–46 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.62.1.139}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Child abuse]] by neglect can be a manifestation of learned helplessness. For example, when parents believe they are incapable of stopping an infant's crying, they may simply give up trying to do anything for the child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Donovan | first1 = W.L. | last2 = Leavitt | first2 = L.A. | last3 = Walsh | first3 = R.O. | year = 1990 | title = Maternal self-efficacy: Illusory control and its effect on susceptibility to learned helplessness | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 61 | issue = | pages = 1638–47 | doi=10.2307/1130771}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Learned helplessness may be a factor in the development of a [[victim mentality]] in a child or young adult. By being repeatedly exposed to uncomfortable or painful situations, such as bullying or abuse by their peers, the person may stop trying to cope with painful social situations. This can lead to continued stress, feelings of [[self-hatred]], and maladaptive behaviors such as avoiding all social interactions {{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}.
*Those who are extremely shy or anxious in social situations may become passive due to feelings of helplessness {{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}. Gotlib and Beatty (1985) found that people who cite helplessness in social settings may be viewed poorly by others, which tends to reinforce the passivity.
*Aging individuals may respond with helplessness to the deaths of friends and family members, the loss of jobs and income, and the development of age-related health problems.  This may cause them to neglect their medical care, financial affairs, and other important needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rodin | first1 = J. | year = 1986 | title = Aging and health: Effects of the sense of control | url = | journal = Science | volume = 233 | issue = | pages = 1271–6 | doi=10.1126/science.3749877}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*According to Cox et al., [[Lyn Yvonne Abramson|Abramson]], [[Patricia Devine|Devine]], and Hollon (2012), learned helplessness is a key factor in depression that is caused by inescapable prejudice (i.e., "deprejudice").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cox|first=William|title=Stereotypes, Prejudice, and Depression The Integrated Perspective|doi=10.1177/1745691612455204|work=original paper|accessdate=16 November 2012|url=http://www.archpsychological.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/deprejudice-txng-dep-n-prejudice-w-tx-for-other.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus: "Helplessness born in the face of inescapable prejudice matches the helplessness born in the face of inescapable shocks."&lt;ref&gt;idem, p433&lt;/ref&gt;
*According to Ruby K. Payne's book ''A Framework for Understanding Poverty'', treatment of [[poverty|the poor]] can lead to a [[cycle of poverty]], a [[Cycle of poverty#Culture of poverty|culture of poverty]], and generational poverty. This type of learned helplessness is passed from parents to children. People who embrace this mentality feel there is no way to escape poverty and so one must live in the moment and not plan for the future, trapping families in poverty.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, Ruby K. Framework for understanding poverty. Highlands, Tex: Aha! Process, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Social problems resulting from learned helplessness may seem unavoidable to those entrenched. However, there are various ways to reduce or prevent it. When induced in experimental settings, learned helplessness has been shown to resolve itself with the passage of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Young | first1 = L.D. | last2 = Allin | first2 = J.M. | year = 1986 | title = Persistence of learned helplessness in humans | url = | journal = Journal of General Psychology | volume = 113 | issue = | pages = 81–8 | doi=10.1080/00221309.1986.9710544}}&lt;/ref&gt; People can be immunized against the perception that events are uncontrollable by increasing their awareness of previous experiences, when they were able to affect a desired outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Altmaier | first1 = E.M. | last2 = Happ | first2 = D.A. | year = 1985 | title = Coping skills training's immunization effects against learned helplessness | url = | journal = Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 181–9 | doi=10.1521/jscp.1985.3.2.181}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cognitive therapy]] can be used to show people that their actions do make a difference&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thornton | first1 = J.W. | last2 = Powell | first2 = G.D. | year = 1974 | title = Immunization to and alleviation of learned helplessness in man | url = | journal = American Journal of Psychology | volume = 87 | issue = | pages = 351–67 | doi=10.2307/1421378}}&lt;/ref&gt; and bolster their [[self-esteem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Orbach | first1 = E. | last2 = Hadas | first2 = Z. | year = 1982 | title = The elimination of learned helplessness deficits as a function of induced self-esteem | url = | journal = Journal of Research in Personality | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 511–23 | doi=10.1016/0092-6566(82)90009-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extensions==
Cognitive scientist and usability engineer [[Donald Norman]] used learned helplessness to explain why people blame themselves when they have a difficult time using simple objects in their environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The US [[sociologist]] [[Harrison White]] has suggested in his book ''Identity and Control'' that the notion of learned helplessness can be extended beyond psychology into the realm of social action. When a culture or political identity fails to achieve desired goals, perceptions of collective ability suffer.

==Emergence under torture==
In [[U.S. Army and CIA interrogation manuals#CIA manuals|CIA interrogation manuals]] learned helplessness is characterized as "apathy" which may result from prolonged use of coercive techniques which result in a "debility-dependency-dread" state in the subject, "If the debility-dependency-dread state is unduly prolonged, however, the arrestee may sink into a defensive apathy from which it is hard to [[torture|arouse]] him."&lt;ref name=KUBARKIX&gt;{{cite web|title=KUBARK COUNTERINTELLIGENCE  INTERROGATION|url=http://www.parascope.com/articles/0397/kub_ix.htm|publisher=CIA|accessdate=December 11, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060602231920/http://www.parascope.com/articles/0397/kub_ix.htm|archivedate=2 June 2006 |pages=Chapter IX.

In 2005, Glatze was quoted by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine saying "I don't think the gay movement understands the extent to which the next generation just wants to be normal kids. The people who are getting that are the Christian right."&lt;ref name=time2005&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1112856-1,00.html |title=The Battle Over Gay Teens |first=John |last=Cloud |periodical=Time Magazine |date=October 2, 2005 |accessdate=2008-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glatze turned toward Christianity after a health scare due to [[palpitations]].&lt;ref name=nyt20110619/&gt; Worried that he was affected by the same heart condition which claimed his father's life, he sought medical help. The palpitations turned out to be due to [[anemia]], caused by [[celiac disease]].&lt;ref name=edgeboston1&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.edgeboston.com/index.php?ci=108&amp;ch=news&amp;sc=glbt&amp;sc2=features&amp;sc3=&amp;id=4945 |title=My Ex-Gay Life :: Choosing Heterosexuality |first=David |last=Foucher |periodical=Edge Boston |date=July 11, 2007 |accessdate=2008-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] in the first half of 2007&lt;ref name=ctoday&gt;{{citation|url=http://wthrockmorton.com/2007/07/04/interview-with-michael-glatze/ |title=Interview with Michael Glatze |date=July 4, 2007 |accessdate=2008-11-23 |first=Warren |last=Throckmorton |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318022149/http://wthrockmorton.com/2007/07/04/interview-with-michael-glatze/ |archivedate=March 18, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but left the church shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name=nyt20110619/&gt;

==Reception==

''[[The Guardian]]'' described the book as "a passionate case for the importance of micro-organisms".&lt;ref name="GuardianObit"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Smith |first1=Barry |title=John Postgate obituary |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/nov/10/john-postgate |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=8 February 2017 |date=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his textbook ''Essential Microbiology'', Stuart Hogg recommends the book to readers who want a general overview of [[Microbes in human culture|microbes and their uses]], stating "there can be no better starting point than John Postgate's classic".&lt;ref name=Hogg&gt;{{cite book |last=Hogg |first=Stuart |title=Essential Microbiology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8yRRtGJxP7YC&amp;pg=PT497 |year=2013 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-1-118-68814-4 |pages=497}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[New Scientist]]'' described the book as "a pleasure to read from first page to last. It is a literal statement. Start to read it and the first page, describing the astonishing dispersion of microbes, from the upper atmosphere to the depths of the sea, will provide any reader with enough wonder and excitement to take them through to the last page and the surface of Venus."&lt;ref name=NewScientist&gt;{{cite book |author=Reed Business Information |title=New Scientist |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OZDUtqfi1LsC&amp;pg=PA48 |date=7 August 1986 |publisher=Reed Business Information |page=48 |ISSN=0262-4079}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine commented that Postgate's "admirable, elegantly written and painlessly informative book" came close to losing its [[alliteration|alliterative]] title, at the hands of "militant [[feminism|feminists]]" at [[Penguin Books]] editing the paperback version in 1986.{{efn|The review noted that they replaced all suspect terms with gender-neutral forms, ignoring the context, so "every schoolboy" became "every schoolchild", wrong because Postgate was actually writing about unequal provision of science education. Worse, and "hilariously" in the reviewer's opinion, "backroom boy" became "students in backrooms", showing "ignorance of idiom and insensitivity to the nuances of language".&lt;ref name=NewScientist2&gt;{{cite news |author=Reed Business Information |title=New Scientist |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KWmKGnwBffwC&amp;pg=PA88 |date=22 May 1986 |publisher=Reed Business Information |page=88 |ISSN=0262-4079}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref name=NewScientist2/&gt;

Dennis R. Schneider, reviewing the 3rd edition in 1992 for ''Cell'', described the book as having "succinctly and carefully explained examples of how [[microorganism]]s affect our lives ... one of the classics of popular science", standing alongside classics like Rosebury's ''Life of Man'' and De Kruif's ''Microbe Hunters''. Schneider wrote that the book's [[British English|Britishness]] "'colours' the text", but Postgate's emphasis on the beneficial and not just the harmful effects of microbes was welcome and admirably explored. He noted few errors, but objected to Postgate's assertion that [[AIDS]] "originated by transmission from a [[primate]]", for which there was at that time no evidence. Schneider would have liked a "better and longer" account of [[molecular biology]]. His chief criticism, however, was that by the 1990s the book no longer had an audience, since "the Victorial ideal of the educated middle class has vanished into the wasteland of broken families, double digit unemployment and a damaged educational system". All the same, he found the book "of value and beauty (except perhaps to the publisher)".&lt;ref name=Cell&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schneider |first1=Dennis R. |title=Microbes and man (3rd edn) by John Postgate |journal=Cell |date=1993 |volume=1|issue=7 |pages=283 |doi=10.1016/0966-842X(93)90053-T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles W. Kim, reviewing the 3rd edition for ''The Quarterly Review of Biology'', stated that "If the author's intent was to present the impact of the ubiquitous microorganisms on the environment and humans, he has succeeded admirably", describing Postgate's style as "unique".&lt;ref name=QRBiol&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kim |first1=Charles W.|title=Reviews and Brief Notices Microbes and Man. John Postgate |journal=Quarterly Review of Biology |date=1993 |volume=68 |issue=3 |pages=432–434 |doi=10.1086/418206 |url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/418206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

D. Roy Cullimore, in his ''Practical Atlas for Bacterial Identification'', comments that all four editions were "easy reading", addressing the challenges that microbes presented to human society. He suggests that "ideally" all four books be read in sequence for an overiew of the development of [[microbiology]] in half a century.&lt;ref name=Cullimore&gt;{{cite book |last=Cullimore |first=D. Roy|title=Practical Atlas for Bacterial Identification |edition=Second |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2xDOBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA238 |year=2010 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-1-4200-8798-7 |page=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mount Laguna Observatory''' ('''MLO''') is an [[astronomy|astronomical]] [[observatory]] owned and operated by [[San Diego State University]] (SDSU).&lt;ref&gt;http://mintaka.sdsu.edu/MLO/FACILITIES/Facilities.html&lt;/ref&gt; The telescope was operated in partnership with the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] (UIUC) until 2000. MLO is located approximately {{Convert|75|km|mi|sp=us}} east of downtown [[San Diego]], [[California]] (USA) on the eastern edge of the [[Cleveland National Forest]] in the [[Laguna Mountains]] and near the hamlet of [[Mount Laguna, California|Mount Laguna]].  MLO was dedicated on June 19, 1968, seven years after SDSU's Department of Astronomy became an independent academic department of SDSU's College of Sciences.  The dedication took place during the 1968 summer meeting of the [[Astronomical Society of the Pacific]].&lt;ref name=1969SMTH /&gt;

==Telescopes==

* The {{Convert|1.06|m|in|abbr=on}} MLO 40-inch Telescope is a [[Cassegrain reflector]] built by Astro Mechanics in 1966.  It was originally fitted with a {{Convert|1.02|m|in|abbr=on}} [[primary mirror]] which has since been replaced.  It is known informally as the Illinois telescope because it was located at UIUC's [[University of Illinois Observatory#Modern Department|Prairie Observatory]] until 1981.&lt;ref name=40IN /&gt;
* The {{Convert|0.6|m|in|abbr=on}} Clifford Smith 24-inch Telescope is a Cassegrain reflector.  It was built by the SDSU Department of Astronomy and used at the main campus from 1961 to 1966.  In 1971 it was installed at MLO after modifications.&lt;ref name=24IN /&gt;&lt;ref name=24IN-TOUR /&gt;
* The {{Convert|0.52|m|in|abbr=on}} Reginald Buller 21-inch Visitors' Telescope was built in 1950 by J.W. Fecker, Inc.  It was donated to SDSU by Reginald Buller and dedicated at MLO in 1988.  It is used primarily by students for direct viewing, and for outreach.&lt;ref name=21IN /&gt;

===Future telescopes===

* The {{Convert|1.26|m|in|abbr=on}} 50-inch Phillips Claud Telescope is currently under construction.  It is a collaboration between SDSU and the [[University of Kansas]] (KU), and is expected to see first light in the first half of 2014.&lt;ref name=50IN /&gt;&lt;ref name=50IN2 /&gt;

===Former telescopes===

* A {{Convert|0.4|m|in|abbr=on}} telescope built by [[Boller and Chivens]] was the first telescope at the observatory, and was replaced by the Claud telescope.&lt;ref name=50IN /&gt;
* A {{Convert|0.4|m|in|abbr=on}} telescope built by Nishimura and used by visitors was moved to the UCSD campus in 1988.  It was replaced by the Buller telescope.&lt;ref name=1989RPRT /&gt;
* The {{Convert|1.0|m|in|abbr=on}} Ultra-Light Technology for Research in Astronomy (ULTRA) telescope was a test bed for lightweight carbon-fiber mirrors.  It was located in the 0.4&amp;nbsp;m Boller and Chivens building from 2006 until 2008.  Before it was installed, the original dome was replaced with a larger one, and the mount upgraded.&lt;ref name=50IN /&gt;  The project was collaboration of SDSU, KU, Dartmouth College, and Composite Mirror Applications, Inc. (CMA) of [[Tucson, Arizona]].&lt;ref name=KU-MLO /&gt;

'''Multiprotocol Encapsulation''', or MPE for short, is a [[Data link layer]] protocol defined
by [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] which has been published as part of [[ETSI]] [[EN 301 192]]. It
provides means to carry packet oriented protocols (like for instance
[[Internet Protocol|IP]]) on top of [[MPEG transport stream]] (TS).

Another encapsulation method is [[Unidirectional Lightweight Encapsulation]] (ULE) which was developed and standardized within the [[IETF]] as RFC 4326.
== Protocol Outline ==
MPE uses [[MPEG-2 Private Table]] sections to carry the user
datagrams. The section header is used to convey:

* the frame's destination MAC address
* optional [[ISO/IEC 8802-2]] [[Logical Link Control]] (LLC) and [[ISO/IEC 8802-1]] [[Sub-Network Attachment Point]] ([[Subnetwork_Access_Protocol|SNAP]]) information
* a payload scrambling indication
* a MAC address scrambling indication

MAC addresses from 1 to 6 bytes length may be used. The format of
[[MPEG-2]] [[DSM-CC]] sections happens to be compatible with DVB MPE.

== MPE-based IP Service Offerings ==
===Service Architecture===
A complete IP service offering over MPEG-2 TS can be established by
organizing MPE streams into one or more [[IP Platform]]s carried on a
broadcast network by means of the [[IP/MAC Notification Table]]
mechanism which is also defined in [[ETSI]] [[EN 301 192]].

===Commercial Offerings===

Both major European satellite operators ([[SES S.A.|SES]] and
[[Eutelsat]]) are offering commercial IP services using MPE (such as [[ASTRA2Connect]]) to both businesses and consumers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5681">{{Theosophy}}
The term '''Neo-Theosophy''' is a term, originally derogatory, used by the followers of [[Helena Blavatsky|Blavatsky]] to denominate the system of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical]] ideas expounded by [[Annie Besant]] and [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]] following the death of Madame Blavatsky in 1891. This material differed in major respects from Blavatsky's original presentation, but it is accepted as genuinely Theosophical by many Theosophists around the world. 

==Overview==
After Blavatsky died in 1891, [[William Quan Judge]] became involved in a dispute with [[Henry Steel Olcott]] and [[Annie Besant]] over Judge allegedly forging letters from the Mahatmas. As a result, he ended his association with Olcott and Besant during 1895 and took most of the Society's American Section with him. He managed his new organization for about a year until his death in [[New York City]], whereupon [[Katherine Tingley]] became manager. The organization originating from the faction of Olcott and Besant is based in India and known as the [[Theosophical Society Adyar|Theosophical Society - Adyar]], while the organization managed by Judge is known nowadays simply as the [[Theosophical Society Pasadena|Theosophical Society]], but often with the specification, "international headquarters, [[Pasadena, California]]."  The ''Theosophical Society - Adyar'' is the group denounced as ''Neo-Theosophy'' by those who are followers of William Q. Judge and the original teachings of Madame Blavatsky; they do not accept what they regard as the ''Neo-Theosophical'' teachings of Annie Besant, Henry Olcott, and [[C. W. Leadbeater]]. 

The term ''Neo-Theosophy'' was coined by Ferdinand T. Brooks around 1912 in a book called ''Neo Theosophy Exposed'', the second part of an earlier book called ''The Theosophical Society and its Esoteric Bogeydom''.&lt;ref&gt;James R. Lewis, Jesper Aagaard Petersen, ''Controversial New Religions'', [[Oxford University Press]], 2004 {{ISBN|0-19-515682-X}}  Page 292&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1924, Margaret Thomas published a book called ''Theosophy Versus Neo-Theosophy''. This book, now available online,&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.blavatskyarchives.com/thomas/index.htm Theosophy vs. Neo-Theosophy:]&lt;/ref&gt; presents a detailed critical comparison of Blavatskyian Theosophy and Neo-Theosophy.

[[G. R. S. Mead]] who was also highly critical of the clairvoyant researches of Besant and Leadbeater, remaining loyal to Blavatskyian Theosophy,&lt;ref&gt;by [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]], Clare Goodrick-Clarke  ''G. R. S. Mead and the Gnostic Quest'' North Atlantic Books {{ISBN|1-55643-572-X}} Page 22&lt;/ref&gt; also used the term Neo-Theosophy to refer to Besant's movement.  For him "Theosophy" meant the wisdom element in the great world religions and philosophies.&lt;ref&gt;cited in Demetres P. Tryphonopoulos, ''The Celestial Tradition: A Study of Ezra Pound's the Cantos'' , Wilfrid Laurier University Press 1992 {{ISBN|0-88920-202-8}} Page 85&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, the term Neo-Theosophical came to be used outside Theosophical circles to refer to groups formed by former Theosophists as well as groups whose central premises borrow heavily from Blavatskyian Theosophy. Robert S. Ellwood, in his 1973 book ''Religious and Spiritual Groups in Modern America'' referred to organizations that had been formed by former Theosophists as "devolutions of Theosophy" and included in his survey "Neo-Gnostic groups and Neo-Rosicrucian groups [...] the [[Anthroposophy]] of [[Rudolf Steiner]], [...] [[Alice Bailey]]'s groups, ([[Guy Ballard]]'s) [["I AM" Activity]] and [[Max Heindel]]'s [[Rosicrucian Fellowship|Rosicrucianism]].&lt;ref&gt; Robert S. Ellwood, Jr., "Religious and Spiritual Groups in Modern America", Prentice-Hall, 1973 {{ISBN|0-13-773317-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a later book, ''Alternative Altars'' (1979) Professor Ellwood added;

{{quote|Alice Bailey (1880 - 1949), founder of the Arcane School and the Full Moon Meditation Groups, and Guy Ballard (1878 - 1930), of the "I AM" movement, are representative of those who have started activities based on new and special communications from Theosophical Masters.&lt;ref&gt;Robert S. Ellwood, Jr., Alternative Altars: Unconventional and Eastern Spirituality in America, University of Chicago Press, 1979 {{ISBN|0-226-20618-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The author Daryl S. Paulson associates "neo-Theosophy" with Alice Bailey.&lt;ref&gt;Daryl S. Paulson, "The Near-Death Experience: An Integration of Cultural, Spiritual, and Physical Perspectives", ''Journal of Near-Death Studies'', Springer, Netherlands, ISSN 0891-4494 (Print) 1573-3661 (Online) Issue Volume 18, Number 1 / September, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Other neo-Theosophists include [[Rudolf Steiner|Steiner]]'s contemporary [[Peter Deunov]] and [[Samael Aun Weor]], who introduced theosophical teachings to Latin America.  [[Dion Fortune]] and [[Aleister Crowley]] were also influencers of (and influenced by) the leading edge of the theosophical movement, which in turn influenced [[Anton LaVey]]'s [[LaVeyan Satanism|Satanism]], [[L. Ron Hubbard]]'s [[Scientology]], [[Wicca]], and the modern [[New Age]] and [[New Thought]] movements. (Alice Bailey introduced the term ''New Age'').&lt;ref&gt;See Neville Drury. "Why Does Aleister Crowley Still Matter?" Richard Metzger, ed. ''Book of Lies: The Disinformation Guide to Magick and the Occult.'' Disinformation Books, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of Neo-Theosophists today include  [[Benjamin Creme]] and Douglas Baker.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20086">'''New Philology''' generally refers to a branch of Mexican [[ethnohistory]] and [[philology]] that uses colonial-era native language texts written by Indians to construct history from the indigenous point of view. The name New Philology was coined by [[James Lockhart (historian)|James Lockhart]] to describe work that he and his doctoral students and scholarly collaborators in history, anthropology, and linguistics had pursued since the mid-1970s.&lt;ref&gt;James Lockhart, "[[Charles Gibson]] and the Ethnohistory of Postconquesst Central Mexico" in ''Nahuas and Spaniards: Postconquest Central Mexican History and Philology.'' Stanford University Press and UCLA Latin American Studies, vol. 76. 1991, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; Lockhart published a great many essays elaborating on the concept and content of the New Philology and [[Matthew Restall]] published a description of it in the ''Latin American Research Review.''&lt;ref&gt;Restall, Matthew, "A History of the New Philology and the New Philology in History", ''Latin American Research Review'' - Volume 38, Number 1, 2003, pp.113–134&lt;/ref&gt; The techniques of the New Philology have also been applied in other disciplines such as European [[medieval]] studies.&lt;ref&gt;M. J. Driscoll, "[http://www.driscoll.dk/docs/words.html The words on the page: Thoughts on philology, old and new]", in: ''Creating the medieval saga: Versions, variability, and editorial interpretations of Old Norse saga literature,'' edited by Judy Quinn &amp; Emily Lethbridge. Syddansk Universitetsforlag, Odense 2010, pp. 85–102.&lt;/ref&gt;  
  
==Historical Development==
Lockhart's discusses philology and in particular the new philology in an essay for a collection of essays hosted digitally at University of Oregon.&lt;ref&gt;"Introduction: Background and Course of the New Philology" ''Sources and Methods for the Study of Postconquest [[Mesoamerican]] Ethnohistory'', Provisional Version hosted by the Wired Humanities Project at the University of Oregon (2007). [http://whp.uoregon.edu/Lockhart/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt; For him, the new philology was built upon the foundation of the old, which focuses on close reading of texts and resulted in collections of printed documentation. An important nineteenth-century Mexican philologist was [[Joaquín García Icazbalceta]].  In Mexico and Latin America, nineteenth-century scholars mined the Spanish archives for colonial documentation for their national histories. A feature of the New Philology is that the publication of indigenous texts in the original language with translations with introductions was standard.  The translated texts often appeared first, followed by a separate scholarly monograph analyzing the texts. The two should be considered two parts of the same scholarly publication. Many of the scholars working in the New Philology did so before it gained that designation.  A particularly valuable online publication are essays where individual scholars discuss the process and product of translating and publishing particular native language documentation.&lt;ref&gt;Provisional Version hosted by the Wired Humanities Project at the University of Oregon (2007). [http://whp.uoregon.edu/Lockhart/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Philology was developed from the 1970s and onwards, building on the work of a previous generation of scholars, most especially historian [[Charles Gibson]], whose ''Aztecs under Spanish Rule'' (1964)&lt;ref&gt;''The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule&gt;'' Charles Gibson, 1964 Stanford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; and his earlier ''Tlaxcala in the Sixteenth Century'' (1952)&lt;ref&gt;''Tlaxcala in the Sixteenth Century'' Charles Gibson, 1952. Yale University Press&lt;/ref&gt; were major scholarly achievements, placing colonial-era Aztecs (now more commonly called [[Nahuas]]) at the center of historical analysis. The leading figure in the establishment of the New Philological historiographical approach was [[James Lockhart (historian)|James Lockhart]] who, in the early 1970s, began learning Nahuatl and studying local level indigenous sources in the [[Nahuatl language]]. His magnum opus was published in 1992, ''The Nahuas After the Conquest.'',&lt;ref&gt;''Nahuas After the Conquest: Social and Cultural History of the Indians of Central Mexico, sixteenth through eighteenth centuries,'' James Lockhart, 1992. Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; which incorporated and extended his own work and that of others.

An early and important text in this vein was ''Nahuatl in the Middle Years'' (1976), published by Lockhart and University of Texas linguist [[Frances Karttunen]].&lt;ref&gt;''Nahuatl in the Middle Years: Language contact Phenomena in Texts of the Colonial Period'', Frances Karttunen &amp; James Lockhart, 1976, University of California Press, Berkeley, California.&lt;/ref&gt; Also important for the early history of the New Philology was the publication of ''Beyond the Codices'' (1976), alluding to the existence of native language texts other than the formal ones termed codices.&lt;ref&gt;''Beyond the Codices'' [[Arthur J. O. Anderson]], Frances Berdan, and James Lockhart, 1976. Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Arthur J. O. Anderson]], a leading figure in Mesoamerican ethnohistory for his collaboration with [[Charles Dibble]] in publishing an English translation of the [[Florentine Codex]] by Franciscan [[Bernardino de Sahagún]], participated in this early project of publishing local-level colonial documents.

In the mid-1970s Lockhart began mentoring history doctoral students at UCLA, who learned Nahuatl and began research on particular region documentation in Nahuatl. Sarah Cline was the first to complete a dissertation in 1981, based on these types of local-level sources, a set of 60 testaments from the central Mexican Indian polity or ''altepetl'' of [[Culhuacán (altepetl)|Culhuacán]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Testaments of Culhuacan''. S.L. Cline and Miguel Leon-Portilla (Eds.) 1984. UCLA Latin American Center Nahuatl Studies Series, vol. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Colonial Culhuacan, 1580-1600: A Social History of an Aztec Town'', S.L. Cline, 1986. New Mexico: University of New Mexico Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Testaments of Culhuacan, Sarah Cline. ''Sources and Methods for the Study of Postconquest Mesoamerican Ethnohistory'' [http://whp.uoregon.edu/Lockhart/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1993 Cline also published a set of early local-level Nahuatl censuses from the Cuernavaca, as ''The Book of Tributes'', as well as an analysis of all three volumes, adding to the existing published corpus.&lt;ref&gt;''The Book of Tributes: Early Sixteenth-Century Nahuatl Censuses from Morelos''. S. L. Cline, 1993, Museo de Antropología e Historia, Archivo Histórico Collección Antigua, vol. 549. UCLA Latin American Center Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Book of Tributes", Sarah Cline, ''Sources and Methods for the Study of Postconquest Mesoamerican Ethnohistory'' [http://whp.uoregon.edu/Lockhart/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Azteckischer Zensus, Zur indianischen Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft im Marquesado um 1540: Aus dem "Libro de Tributos" (Col. Ant. Ms. 551) im Archivo Historico,'' Mexico. 2 vols. Eike Hinz, Claudine Hartau, and Marie Luise Heimann-Koenen, eds. 1983. Hanover.&lt;/ref&gt; In this first generation Robert Haskett, who examined Nahuatl texts on colonial Cuernavaca, later also publishing on primordial titles.&lt;ref&gt;''Indigenous Rulers: An Ethnohistory of Indian Town Government in Colonial Cuernavaca'', Robert Haskett, 1991, University of New Mexico Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Primordial Titles", Robert Haskett. ''Sources and Methods for the Study of Postconquest Mesoamerican Ethnohistory'' [http://whp.uoregon.edu/Lockhart/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Susan Schroeder delved into the rich texts produced by seventeenth-century Nahua historian, Chimalpahin, resulting in several publications &lt;ref&gt;''Chimalpahin and the Kingdoms of Chalco'', 1991, Susan Schroeder, Tucson: University of Arizona Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Codex Chimalpahin: Society and Politics in Mexico-Tenochtitlan, Tlatelolco, Texcoco, Culhuacan, and other Nahua Altetpetl in Central Mexico.'' Domingo de San Anton Munon Chimalpahin Cuauhtlehuantzin, Arthur J.O. Anderson, Susan Schroeder, Wayne Ruwet. 1997. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Annals of His Time: Don Domingo de San Anton Munon Chimalpahin Quahtlehuantzin''James Lockhart, Susan Schroeder, and Doris Namala.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Annals of Chimalpahin", Susan Schroeder. ''Sources and Methods for the Study of Postconquest Mesoamerican Ethnohistory''[http://whp.uoregon.edu/Lockhart/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The largest number of local-level indigenous documents, such as testaments and bills of sale, are in Nahuatl, resulting in Nahuatl having the largest set of published sets of documents and monographic scholarly analyses. Rebecca Horn's dissertation on Coyoacan and later Stanford University Press monograph showed the multiple connections between Nahuas and Spaniards.&lt;ref&gt;''Postconquest Coyoacan: Nahua-Spanish Relations in the Valley of Mexico.'' Rebecca Horn, 1997. Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Nahuatl and Spanish Sources for Coyoacan", Rebecca Horn. ''Sources and Methods for the Study of Postconquest Mesoamerican Ethnohistory'' [http://whp.uoregon.edu/Lockhart/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Horn also served as associate editor of the UCLA Latin American Center's Nahuatl Studies Series.

Some UCLA later doctoral students of Lockhart, particularly [[Matthew Restall]] and Kevin Terraciano, first learned Nahuatl and then other Mesoamerican indigenous languages (Mixtec and Yucatec Maya) that had a significant corpus of documents in the language. Restall's UCLA 1995 dissertation "The World of the Cah: postconquest Yucatec Maya Society" was followed by his 1995 publication of a collection of eighteenth-century wills.&lt;ref&gt;''Life and Death in a Maya Community: The Ixil Testaments of the 1760s.'' Matthew Restall, 1995. Lancaster CA: Labyrinthos&lt;/ref&gt; and culminating in his Stanford University Press monograph, ''The Maya World: Yucatec culture and society, 1550-1850.''&lt;ref&gt;''The Maya World: Yucatec culture and society, 1550-1850''. Matthew Restall. 1997, Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Sources for the Ethnohistory and Afrohistory of Postconquest Yucatan," Matthew Restall.''Sources and Methods for the Study of Postconquest Mesoamerican Ethnohistory''[http://whp.uoregon.edu/Lockhart/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  Terraciano's 1994 dissertation on the Mixtecs of Oaxaca entitled ''Ñudzahui history: Mixtec writing and culture in colonial Oaxaca'' was followed by his 2001 monograph ''The Mixtecs of Colonial Oaxaca: Ñudzahui History''.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Terraciano,''The Mixtecs of Colonial Oaxaca: Nudzahui History, sixteen through eighteenth centuries''. 2001, Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Terraciano and Restall revised the titles of their dissertations in the published monographs to allow better recognition by readers of the publication's subject; Cline used "Aztec" in the title of her monograph on Culhuacan, rather than "Nahua", which in the 1980s had little recognition value even among specialists on Latin American cultures.

Lauren Lambert Jennings explicitly applied techniques from New Philology to the study of European Song texts quoting their "central premise [as] the idea that [[codex]] is not merely a neutral container for its texts." She continued by saying that the New Philologists and scholars of "textual cultures" "posit that a work's meaning (literary and cultural) is determined by the entire manuscript matrix — its physical form, contents, scribe(s), readers, and history."&lt;ref&gt;Lauren Lambert Jennings, "Tracing Voices: Song as Literature in Late Medieval Italy" (Ph.D. dissertation: University of Pennsylvania, 2012), p. 42, online at [https://usc.academia.edu/LaurenJennings/Books/1591293/Tracing_Voices_Song_as_Literature_in_Late_Medieval_Italy]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3234">A '''nutrient enema''', also known as '''feeding per rectum''', '''rectal alimentation''', or '''rectal feeding''', is an [[enema]] administered with the intent of providing [[nutrition]] when normal [[eating]] is not possible. Although this treatment is ancient, dating back at least to [[Galen]] and a common technique in 19th century medicine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=1987791|title=The nutrient enema|author=J. W. A.

Child.|pages=22–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; nutrient enemas have been superseded in modern medical care by [[tube feeding]] and [[Parenteral nutrition|intravenous feeding]].

A variety of different mixes have been used for nutrient enemas throughout history. A paper published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 1926 stated that because the [[rectum]] and lower [[digestive tract]] lack [[digestive enzyme]]s, it is likely that only the end-products of normal digestion such as [[sugars]], [[amino acid]]s, [[salt]] and [[alcohol]], will be absorbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Rectal Alimentation| journal = Nature| volume = 118| pages = 858–859| year = 1926| doi = 10.1038/118858a0|bibcode = 1926Natur.118..858.| issue=2980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This treatment was given to U.S. President [[James A. Garfield]] after his shooting in 1881, and is asserted to have prolonged his life.&lt;ref&gt;Bliss, D. W.

'''Operation Moonwatch''' (also known as ''Project Moonwatch'' and, more simply, as ''Moonwatch'') was an [[citizen science|amateur science program]] formally initiated by the [[Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory]] (SAO) in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siris-sihistory.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?uri=full=3100001~!1159!0 |title=Operation Moonwatch Begins |website=Siris-sihistory.si.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SAO organized Moonwatch as part of the [[International Geophysical Year]] (IGY) which was probably the largest single scientific undertaking in history. Its initial goal was to enlist the aid of amateur astronomers and other citizens who would help professional scientists [[Satellite watching|spot the first artificial satellites]]. However, until professionally manned optical tracking stations came on-line in 1958, this network of amateur scientists and other interested citizens played a critical role in providing crucial information regarding the world’s first satellites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Auchincloss |first=Kenneth |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=120766 |title=Smithsonian Astronomers Keep Hectic Pace &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; The Harvard Crimson |website=Thecrimson.com |date=1957-11-09 |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of Moonwatch==
Moonwatch’s origins can be traced to two sources. In the United States, there was a thriving culture of amateur scientists including thousands of citizens who did astronomy for an [[avocation]]. During the Cold War, the United States also encouraged thousands of citizens to take part in the [[Ground Observer Corps]], a nationwide program to spot Soviet bombers. Moonwatch brought together these two activities and attitudes, melding curiosity and vigilance into a thriving activity for citizens. Moonwatch, in other words, was an expression of 1950s popular culture and fixed properly within the context of the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=327104 |accessdate=June 23, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010052130/http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=327104 |archivedate=October 10, 2007|title=Russians Launch Artificial Satellite}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moonwatch was the brainchild of [[Harvard]] astronomer [[Fred L. Whipple]]. In 1955, as the recently appointed director of the [[Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory]] in Cambridge, MA, Whipple proposed that amateurs could play a vital role in efforts to track the first satellites. He overcame the objections of colleagues who doubted ordinary citizens could do the job or who wanted the task for their own institutions. Eventually, Whipple carved out a place for amateurs in the IGY.

==Moonwatch's members==
In the late 1950s, thousands of teenagers, housewives, amateur astronomers, school teachers, and other citizens served on Moonwatch teams around the globe. Initially conceived as a way for citizens to participate in science and as a supplement to professionally manned optical and radio tracking stations, Moonwatchers around the world found themselves an essential component of the professional scientists’ research program. Using specially designed telescopes, hand-built or purchased from vendors like [[Radio Shack]], scores of Moonwatchers nightly monitored the skies. Their prompt response was aided by the extensive training they had done by spotting pebbles tossed in the air, registering the flight of moths, and participating in national alerts organized by the [[Civil Air Patrol]].

Once professional scientists had accepted the idea that ordinary citizens could spot satellites and contribute to legitimate scientific research, Whipple and his colleagues organized amateurs around the world. Citizens formed Operation Moonwatch teams in towns and cities all around the globe, built their own equipment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atmob.org/library/clubhistory.php |title=Amateur Telescope Makers of Boston |website=Atmob.org |date=1953-10-19 |accessdate=2016-02-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303142614/http://www.atmob.org/library/clubhistory.php |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and courted sponsors. In many cases, Moonwatch was not just a fad but an expression of real interest in science. By October 1957, Operation Moonwatch had some 200 teams ready to go into action, including observers in Hawaii &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ifa.hawaii.edu/users/steiger/igy_period.htm |title=Institute for Astronomy, University of Hawaii |website=Ifa.hawaii.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Australia &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aswa.info/articles/forty-years-ago.html |title=Astronomical Society of Western Australia (Inc.) |website=Aswa.info |date= |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==How Moonwatch worked==
[[File:Smithsonian Institution Archives - 2002-32252.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Baker-Nunn camera|Baker-Nunn satellite tracking camera]].]]
Whipple envisioned a global network of specially designed instruments that could track and photograph satellites. This network, aided by a corps of volunteer satellite spotters and a computer at the [[MIT Computation Center]], would establish [[ephemerides]] – predictions of where a satellite will be at particular times. The instruments at these stations were eventually designed by [[Dr. James G. Baker]] and [[Joseph Nunn]] and hence known as [[Baker-Nunn camera]]s. Based on a series of super-Schmidt wide-angle telescopes and strategically placed around the globe at 12 locations, the innovative cameras could track rapidly moving targets while simultaneously viewing large swaths of the sky. 
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Baker Nunn Camera .JPG|thumb|Baker-Nunn camera station in Hawaii {{Deletable image-caption|2007-04-25|date=May 2012}}]] --&gt;
From the start, Whipple planned that the professionally manned Baker-Nunn stations would be complemented by teams of dedicated amateurs. Amateur satellite spotters would inform the Baker-Nunn stations as to where to look, an important task given that scientists working on the Vanguard program likened finding a satellite in the sky to finding a golf ball tossed out of a jet plane.  Amateur teams would relay the information back to the SAO in Cambridge where professional scientists would use it to generate accurate satellite orbits. At this point, professionals at the Baker-Nunn stations would take over the full-time task of photographing them.

==During the IGY==
[[File:Cincinnati Moonwatch Team sign.jpg|thumb|Historic marker for the [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] team]]
''[[Sputnik 1]]'s'' sudden launch was followed less than a month later with the Soviets orbiting [[Sputnik 2]] and the dog [[Laika]]. Moonwatch teams networked around the world who provided tracking information needed by scientists in Western nations. For the opening months of the Space Age, members of Moonwatch were the only organized worldwide network that was prepared to spot and help track satellites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,862748,00.html |title=THE NATION: Red Moon Over the U.S. |publisher=TIME |date=1957-10-14 |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The information they provided was complemented by the radio tracking program called [[Minitrack]] the United States Navy operated as well as some information from [[amateur radio]] buffs.

In many cases, Moonwatch teams also had the responsibility of communicating news of [[Sputnik]] and the first American satellites to the public. The public responded, in turn, with infectious enthusiasm as local radio stations aired times to spot satellites and local and national newspapers ran hundreds of articles that described the nighttime activities of Moonwatchers.

Moonwatch caught the attention of those citizens interested in science or the Space Race during the late 1950s and much of the general public as well. Newspapers and popular magazines featured stories about Moonwatch regularly; dozens of articles appeared in the [[Los Angeles Times]], The New Yorker, and The [[New York Times]] alone.  Meanwhile, in the U.S. local businesses sponsored teams with monikers like Spacehounds and The Order of Lunartiks. Meanwhile, Moonwatch teams in Peru, Japan, Australia, and even the Arctic regularly sent their observations to the Smithsonian.

Moonwatch complemented the professional system of satellite tracking stations that Fred Whipple organized around the globe. These two networks – one composed of amateurs and the other of seasoned professionals – helped further Whipple’s personal goals of expanding his own astronomical empire. Operation Moonwatch was the most successful amateur activity of the IGY and it became the public face of a satellite tracking network that expanded the Smithsonian’s global reach. Whipple used satellite tracking as a gateway for his observatory to participate in new research opportunities that appeared in the early years of space exploration.

In February 1958, President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] publicly thanked the SAO, Fred Whipple, and the global corps of satellite spotters that comprised Moonwatch for their efforts in tracking the first Soviet and American satellites.

==Moonwatch after the IGY==
Even after the IGY ended, the Smithsonian maintained Operation Moonwatch. Hundreds of dedicated amateur scientists continued to help NASA and other agencies track satellites. Their observations often rivaled those of professional tracking stations, blurring the boundary between professional and amateur.  Moonwatch members and the Smithsonian were important contributors to US Department of Defense satellite tracking research and development efforts, 1957–1961; see [[Project Space Track (1957-1961)|Project Space Track]].

Moonwatch continued long after the IGY ended in 1958. In fact, the Smithsonian operated Moonwatch until 1975 making it one of the longest running amateur science activities ever. As the fad of satellite spotting passed, the Smithsonian refashioned Operation Moonwatch to perform new functions. It encouraged teams of dedicated amateurs to contribute increasingly precise data for satellite tracking. Moonwatchers adapted to the needs of the Smithsonian through the activities of “hard core” groups in places like Walnut Creek, California. Throughout the 1960s, the Smithsonian gave them ever more challenging assignments such as locating extremely faint satellites and tracking satellites as they re-entered the earth’s atmosphere. At times, the precise observations and calculations of dedicated Moonwatchers surpassed the work of professionals.

One of the most notable activities of Moonwatchers after the IGY was the observance of [[Sputnik 4]] when it reentered the atmosphere in September 1962. Moonwatchers and other amateur scientists near Milwaukee, WI observed the flaming re-entry and their observations eventually led to the recovery and analysis of several fragments from the Soviet satellite.

==Moonwatch's legacy==
Moonwatch affected the lives of participants long after they stopped looking for satellites. When the Smithsonian discontinued the program in 1975, one long-time Moonwatcher compared his participation to “winning the Medal of Honor.” Moonwatch inspired some future scientists, for example, [[James A. Westphal]], a Moonwatcher from Oklahoma, who eventually helped design instruments for the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] at [[Caltech]]. The program boosted science programs at many schools throughout the country and helped revitalize amateur science in the United States.

The [[United States Space Surveillance Network]] and other modern tracking systems are professional and automated, but amateurs remain active in [[satellite watching]].

'''Painting in Space''' ("Les Peintures dans l`espace" in French) is an [[art movement]] that was invented by [[Yervand Kochar]] in the 1930s in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://armenianweekly.com/2010/11/14/komitas-and-kochar-the-music-and-image-of-undefeated-spirit/|title=Komitas and Kochar: The Music and Image of Undefeated Spirit|date=2010-11-14|work=The Armenian Weekly|access-date=2018-10-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This movement syntheses all the possibilities of painting, graphic and sculpture. 

== About ==
Painting in Space consists of different metal panels with various paintings. With the help of an engine situated in the base of the figure it is being viewed in slow motion. This way [[Yervand Kochar]] shows how in time separate space elements become one, breaking the boundaries of time and space. It is not a sculpture, but painting in motion. Kochar proposes to expand the possibilities of visual thinking, introducing motion into frozen forms, blending painting with the plasticity of three-dimensional geometric forms.

One work of the Painting in Space works, aptly named ''Les Peintures dans l`espace'', (1934) by [[Yervand Kochar]], is being exhibited and in the permanent collection at [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] in [[Paris]] since 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.centrepompidou.fr/cpv/resource/cej9p9e/rgkBe7|title=Collection: Peinture dans l'espace|last=|first=|date=|work=Le Centre Pompidou|access-date=2017-03-22|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2674">In [[spherical astronomy]], the '''parallactic angle''' is the angle between the [[great circle]] through a [[celestial object]] and the [[zenith]], and the [[hour circle]] of the object.&lt;ref name="aips"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astron.nl/aips++/docs/glossary/p.html#parallactic_angle|title=AIPS++ Glossary|publisher=Associated Universities Inc., Washington, D.C.|accessdate=21 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually denoted ''q''. In the triangle zenith—object—celestial pole, the parallactic angle will be the [[position angle]] of the zenith at the celestial object. Despite its name, this angle is unrelated with [[parallax]]. The parallactic angle is zero when the object crosses the [[meridian (astronomy)|meridian]].

== Uses ==
Depending on the type of [[telescope mount|mount]] of the [[telescope]], this angle may also affect the orientation of the celestial object's disk as seen in a telescope. With an [[equatorial mount]], the cardinal points of the celestial object's disk are aligned with the vertical and horizontal direction of the view in the telescope. With an [[altazimuth mount]], those directions are rotated by the amount of the parallactic angle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.petermeadows.com/html/parallactic.html|title=Solar Observing: Parallactic Angle|last=Meadows|first=Peter|accessdate=15 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cardinal points referred to here are the points on the limb located such that a line from the center of the disk through them will point to one of the celestial poles or 90° away from them; these are not the [[cardinal points]] defined by the object's axis of rotation.

The orientation of the disk of the Moon, as related to the [[horizon]], changes throughout its [[diurnal motion]] and the parallactic angle changes equivalently.&lt;ref name="meeus1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Meeus|first=Jean|title=Astronomical Algorithms|date=1998|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also the case with other celestial objects.

In an [[ephemeris]], the [[position angle]] of the midpoint of the bright [[lunar limb|limb]] of the Moon or planets, and the position angles of their [[North pole]]s may be tabulated. If this angle is measured from the North point on the limb, it can be converted to an angle measured from the zenith point (the vertex) as seen by an observer by subtracting the parallactic angle.&lt;ref name="meeus1998" /&gt; The position angle of the bright limb is directly related to that of the [[subsolar point]].

[[Image:london-park-system.jpg|thumb|right|The County of London Park System, planned by [[Patrick Abercrombie]] in 1943-4|300px]]  A '''park system''', also known as an open space system, is a network of green spaces that are connected by public walkways, bridleways or cycleways. The concept first emerged with the need to minimize fragmentation of natural environments and was referred to as "[[Wildlife corridor|patch and corridor]]."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ahern|first1=Jack|title=Greenways as a Planning Strategy|journal=Landscape and Urban Planning|date=1995|volume=33|pages=131–155|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/016920469502039V/1-s2.0-016920469502039V-main.pdf?_tid=40541390-2eb5-11e7-81ea-00000aab0f27&amp;acdnat=1493674346_9ae3299e8869afa5e4604041c0ca6552|doi=10.1016/0169-2046(95)02039-v}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern [[landscape architecture]], the park system is collaborating with the idea of planning [[Greenway (landscape)|greenways]], which run through urban and rural areas. These systems can serve the landscape through ecological, recreational, social, cultural, and healthful measures, and are designed with intentions of [[Sustainable development|sustainability]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

One of the earliest park systems, in London, came into existence by chance. As London expanded around former royal parks in the nineteenth century, [[St. James's Park]], [[Green Park]] and [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] became part of the urban area. This arrangement was admired in France and adopted for the nineteenth century re-planning of Paris by [[Baron Haussmann]]. It was also admired by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] and used to create the famous [[Emerald Necklace]] in Boston. Another example is [[Ebenezer Howard]]'s Adirondack Park concept. These green networks were part of the nineteenth century [[Garden city movement|Garden City Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zube|first=Ervin H.|date=1995|title=Greenways and the U.S. National Park System|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/0169204694020114/1-s2.0-0169204694020114-main.pdf?_tid=b9cbffaa-2eb8-11e7-9307-00000aacb35f&amp;acdnat=1493675838_474529eabbfc6b0dd0ddea0aa781e5a6|journal=Landscape and Urban Planning|volume=33|pages=17–25|doi=10.1016/0169-2046(94)02011-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1927, the [[Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission]] was formed to plan and acquire parklands along stream valley corridors in the then-rural northern and eastern suburbs of Washington, D.C.  Over 33,000 acres (130&amp;nbsp;km²) are now protected in the [[Montgomery County, Maryland]] portion and provide welcome green space in this urbanized region.  A major proposal for a park system was included in [[Patrick Abercrombie]]'s 1943-4 [[County of London Plan]].

The largest continuous urban parks system in [[North America]] is the [[North Saskatchewan River valley parks system]] in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]], Canada, which is {{convert|7400|ha|acre|abbr=on}} in size and {{convert|48|km|mi|abbr=on}} in length, and also includes 22 ravines, which have a combined total length of {{convert|103|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Ribbon&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.edmonton.ca/environmental/documents/Ribbon_of_GreenMaster_Plan.pdf#xml=http://search1.edmonton.ca/texis/ThunderstoneSearchService/pdfhi.txt?query=north+saskatchewan+river+valley&amp;pr=www.edmonton.ca&amp;prox=page&amp;rorder=750&amp;rprox=250&amp;rdfreq=0&amp;rwfreq=0&amp;rlead=750&amp;rdepth=0&amp;sufs=1&amp;order=r&amp;cq=&amp;id=4d9aed517 | title=Ribbon of Green: North Saskatchewan River Valley and Ravine System Master Plan | publisher=City of Edmonton | accessdate=2011-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest urban parks system in [[Australia]] is the [[Western Sydney Parklands]], which is {{convert|5280|ha|acre|abbr=on}} in size and {{convert|27|km|mi|abbr=on}} in length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/resources/planmanagement/draft/WesternSydneyRPPOMFinalDraft.pdf |title=Western Sydney Regional Park Draft Plan of Management |publisher=NSW Government |accessdate=16 May 2013 |quote=It is approximately 5,280 hectares in size and is the largest urban park in Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Talbruecke-Bruenn-4 2005-08-04.jpg|thumb|Formwork (shuttering) for a pile cap]]
A '''pile cap''' is a thick [[concrete]] mat that rests on concrete or timber piles that have been driven into soft or unstable ground to provide a suitable stable foundation. It usually forms part of the [[foundation (engineering)|foundation]] of a building, typically a multi-story building, structure or support base for heavy equipment. The cast [[concrete]] pile cap distributes the load of the building into the [[deep foundation|piles]]. A similar structure to a pile cap is a "raft", which is a concrete foundation floor resting directly onto soft soil which may be liable to [[subsidence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbe.napier.ac.uk/projects/piledesign/guide/chapter8.htm|title=PILE INSTALLATION METHODS|publisher=School of the Built Environment, Napier University, Edinburgh 15 November 2005|accessdate=15 February 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20030505003515/http://www.sbe.napier.ac.uk/projects/piledesign/guide/chapter8.htm|archivedate=5 May 2003|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
The mat is made of concrete which is an aggregate of small rocks and [[cement]]. This mixture has to be supported by a framework to avoid sagging and fracture while setting. This process is known as [[Form work|shuttering]] and [[reinforcing]]. The materials used are long twisted steel bars between the piles held in shape by thinner tie wires. Once this steel mat is laid, timber is attached around the perimeter to contain the wet concrete mixture. Once poured, (usually as a series of small loads), the concrete is stirred to remove any air pockets that might weaken the structure when set. The concrete undergoes a chemical change as it hardens and this produces a lot of heat. Sometimes, if the mass of concrete is very large, pipes carrying [[refrigerant]] [[coolant]] are used in the mass to assist the setting process to prevent the concrete from cracking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mahapwd.com/training/traininghandbook/4.htm|title=EXECUTION OF WORK|publisher=Public works department - various dates|accessdate=15 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Politics of the International Space Station'''  begins with the 1972 milestone in co-operation between the United States and the Soviet Union in space, the [[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project]]. This cooperative venture resulted in the July 1975 docking of [[Soyuz 19]] with an [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Apollo]] spacecraft. From 1978 to 1987, the USSR's [[Interkosmos]] programme included allied Warsaw Pact countries, and countries which were not Soviet allies, such as India, Syria and France, in manned and unmanned missions to Space stations Salyut 6 and 7. In 1986 the USSR extended this co-operation to a dozen countries in the [[Mir]] programme. From 1994 to 1998, NASA Space Shuttles and crew visited MIR in the [[Shuttle–Mir Program]]me. In 1998, assembly of the [[International Space Station]] began.&lt;ref name="OnOrbit"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/externalflash/ISSRG/pdfs/on_orbit.pdf |title=On-Orbit Elements |publisher=NASA |author=NASA |date=18 February 2010 |accessdate=19 June 2010 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091029013438/http://www.nasa.gov/externalflash/ISSRG/pdfs/on_orbit.pdf |archivedate=29 October 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, a meeting in Quebec City between the leaders of the Canadian Space Agency and those from Japan, Russia, the United States and involved European nations resulted in a renewed pledge to maintain the International Space Station until at least 2020. NASA reports to be still committed to the principles of the mission but also to use the station in new ways, which were not elaborated. CSA President Steve MacLean stated his belief that the station's Canadarm will continue to function properly until 2028, alluding to Canada's likely extension of its involvement beyond 2020.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vancouversun.com/technology/Canada+renews+pledge+International+Space+Station+until+2020/6235789/story.html Canada renews pledge to International Space Station until 2020.] The Vancouver Sun. 1 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ownership of modules, station usage by participant nations, and responsibilities for station resupply are established by the Space Station Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA). This international treaty was signed on 28 January 1998 by the United States of America, Russia, Japan, Canada and eleven member states of the European Space Agency (Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom).&lt;ref name="PartStates"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaHS/partstates.html|title=Human Spaceflight and Exploration—European Participating States|accessdate=17 January 2009|publisher=European Space Agency (ESA)|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ESA-IGA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflight.esa.int/users/index.cfm?act=default.page&amp;level=11&amp;page=1980|title=ISS Intergovernmental Agreement|publisher=European Space Agency (ESA)|accessdate=19 April 2009|date=19 April 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610083738/http://www.spaceflight.esa.int/users/index.cfm?act=default.page&amp;level=11&amp;page=1980|archivedate=10 June 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of the United Kingdom, all of the signatories went on to contribute to the Space Station project. A second layer of agreements was then achieved, called Memoranda of Understanding (MOU), between NASA and ESA, CSA, RKA and JAXA. These agreements are then further split, such as for the contractual obligations between nations, and trading of partners' rights and obligations.&lt;ref name="ESA-IGA" /&gt; Use of the Russian Orbital Segment is also negotiated at this level.&lt;ref name="RSA-MOU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/elements/nasa_rsa.html|title=Memorandum of Understanding Between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration of the United States of America and the Russian Space Agency Concerning Cooperation on the Civil International Space Station|publisher=NASA|accessdate=19 April 2009|date=29 January 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these main intergovernmental agreements, Brazil originally joined the programme as a bilateral partner of the United States by a contract with NASA to supply hardware.&lt;ref name="Brazil"&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA Signs International Space Station Agreement With Brazil|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/news/releases/1996_1998/h97-233.html|date=14 October 1997|accessdate=18 January 2009|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; In return, NASA would provide Brazil with access to its ISS facilities on-orbit, as well as a flight opportunity for one Brazilian astronaut during the course of the ISS programme. However, due to cost issues, the subcontractor [[Embraer]] was unable to provide the promised ExPrESS pallet, and Brazil left the programme in 2007.&lt;ref name="Emerson Kimura 2009"&gt;{{cite web|title=Made in Brazil O Brasil na Estação Espacial Internacional|url=http://www.gizmodo.com.br/conteudo/made-brazil-o-brasil-na-estacao-espacial-internacional/|publisher=Gizmodo Brazil|accessdate=9 March 2011|author=Emerson Kimura|language=Portuguese|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italy has a similar contract with NASA to provide comparable services, although Italy also takes part in the programme directly via its membership in ESA.&lt;ref name="Italy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asi.it/en/flash_en/living/the_international_space_station_iss|title=International Space Station (ISS)|publisher=Italian Space Agency|date=18 January 2009|accessdate=18 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expanding the partnership would require unanimous agreement of the existing partners.

The heads of both the South Korean and Indian space agency [[ISRO]] announced at the first plenary session of the 2009 [[International Astronautical Congress]] that their nations wished to join the ISS programme, with talks due to begin in 2010. The heads of agency also expressed support for extending ISS lifetime.&lt;ref name="ISRO and KARI to join ISS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2009/10/14/333406/south-korea-india-to-begin-iss-partnership-talks-in.html|title=South Korea, India to begin ISS partnership talks in 2010|work=Flight International|accessdate=14 October 2009|date=19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; European countries not part of the programme will be allowed access to the station in a three-year trial period, [[ESA]] officials say.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space-travel.com/reports/EU_mulls_opening_ISS_to_more_countries_999.html|title=EU mulls opening ISS to more countries|publisher=Space-travel.com|accessdate=16 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian part of the station is operated and controlled by the Russian Federation's space agency and provides Russia with the right to nearly one-half of the crew time for the ISS. The allocation of remaining crew time (three to four crew members of the total permanent crew of six) and hardware within the other sections of the station is as follows: ''[[Columbus (ISS module)|Columbus]]'': 51% for the ESA, 46.7% for NASA, and 2.3% for CSA.&lt;ref name="ESA-IGA" /&gt; ''[[Japanese Experiment Module|Kibō]]'': 51% for the JAXA, 46.7% for NASA, and 2.3% for CSA.&lt;ref name="JAXA-MOU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/elements/nasa_japan.html|title=Memorandum of Understanding Between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration of the United States of America and the Government of Japan Concerning Cooperation on the Civil International Space Station|publisher=NASA|accessdate=19 April 2009|date=24 February 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Destiny (ISS module)|Destiny]]'': 97.7% for NASA and 2.3% for CSA.&lt;ref name="CSA-MOU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/elements/nasa_csa.html|title=Memorandum of Understanding Between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration of the United States of America and the Canadian Space Agency Concerning Cooperation on the Civil International Space Station|publisher=NASA|accessdate=19 April 2009|date=29 January 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crew time, electrical power and rights to purchase supporting services (such as data upload and download and communications) are divided 76.6% for NASA, 12.8% for JAXA, 8.3% for ESA, and 2.3% for CSA.&lt;ref name="ESA-IGA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JAXA-MOU" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CSA-MOU" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Manifest"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/iss_manifest.html|title=Consolidated Launch Manifest|accessdate=8 July 2008|publisher=NASA|author=NASA|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SSSM"&gt;{{cite book|first=David|last=Harland|title=The Story of Space Station Mir|publisher=Springer-Verlag New York Inc|date=30 November 2004|location=New York|isbn=978-0-387-23011-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Included in the agreement was training, provision of Soyuz capsules, life support systems, docking systems, and space suits. American observers comment that Shenzhou spacecraft could dock at the ISS if it became politically feasible, whilst Chinese engineers say work would still be required on the rendezvous system.

==Brazil==
Brazil joined the ISS as a partner of the United States and this included a contract with NASA to supply hardware to the Space Station.&lt;ref name="Brazil"/&gt; In return, NASA would provide Brazil with access to NASA ISS facilities on-orbit, as well as a flight opportunity for one Brazilian astronaut during the course of the ISS programme. However, due to cost issues, the subcontractor [[Embraer]] was unable to provide the promised ExPrESS pallet, and Brazil left the programme in 2007.&lt;ref name="Emerson Kimura 2009"/&gt; Regardless, the first Brazilian astronaut, [[Marcos Pontes]], was sent to ISS in April 2006 for [[Expedition 13]].&lt;ref name="space.com"&gt;[http://www.space.com/2222-brazils-astronaut-fresh-iss-crew-reach-orbit.html]&lt;/ref&gt; This was Brazil's first space traveler and he returned to Earth safely.&lt;ref name="space.com"/&gt; Pontes trained on the Space Shuttle and Soyuz, but ended up going up with the Russians, although he did work at the U.S. Johnson Space Center after returning to Earth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12989">[[Thomas P. Hughes]],&lt;ref name="hughes"&gt;Hughes, T. P. (1983). Networks of power: Electrification in western society, 1880-1930. USA: The Johns Hopkins University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; in his {{According to whom|seminal book,|date=July 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;Melvin Kranzberg, "History &amp; Technology: Kranzberg's Laws" ''Society for the History of Technology'', 1986&lt;/ref&gt; ''Networks of power: Electrification in western society, 1880-1930'', introduces the concept in the analysis of technological systems, whereby the reverse salient refers to a component of the system that, due to its insufficient development, prevents the technological system in its entirety achieving its targeted development.

==Technological systems and their evolution==
Technological systems may refer to a [[hierarchy|hierarchically]] nested structure of technological parts, whereby the [[system]] is seen as a composition of [[interdependence|interdependent]] sub-systems that are themselves systems comprising further sub-systems.&lt;ref name="tushman and murmann"&gt;[[Tushman, M.L.]] &amp; Murmann, J.P. 1998, "Dominant Designs, Technology Cycles, and Organizational Outcomes", Research in Organizational Behavior, vol. 20, pp. 231-266.&lt;/ref&gt; In this manner, the holistic system as well as its properties is seen to be [[:wikt:synthesized|synthesized]] through the sub-systems that constitute it. Technological systems may also be seen as [[sociotechnical systems|socio-technical systems]] that contain, in addition to technical sub-systems, social sub-systems, such as the creators and users of [[technology]], as well as overseeing regulatory bodies. In both perspectives, technological systems are seen to be goal-seeking, therefore evolving towards objectives.&lt;ref name="sahal"&gt;Sahal, D. 1981, Patterns of Technological Evolution, Addison-Wesley, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hughes&lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt; proposes that technological systems pass through certain phases during the system’s evolution. The first of these phases sees the invention and development of the system, owed greatly to the efforts of inventors and [[entrepreneur]]s, such as [[Thomas Edison]] in the development of the electric technological system. The second stage is the era of technological transfer from one region or society to others, for example, the dissemination of Edison’s electric system from New York City to other cities such as London and Berlin. The third phase of systemic evolution is marked by a period of system growth and expansion when the technological system strives to improve its performance, for instance with respect to economic outcomes or [[Output (economics)|output]] efficiency. In this phase, the system is dependent on the satisfactory evolution of all its components’ performances. The development of the technological systems is therefore reliant on the reciprocated and interdependent cause and effect [[Process (science)|processes]] amongst social and technical components, and may be described as [[coevolution|co-evolutionary]], where the balanced co-evolution of system components carries significance in establishing desired system progress. Subsequently, a sub-system which evolves at a sufficient pace contribute positively to the collective development, while a sub-system which does not develop sufficiently prevents the technology system achieving its targeted development. Hughes names these problematic sub-systems reverse salients.&lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hughes2"&gt;Hughes, T.P. 1987, "The Evolution of Large Technological Systems" in The Social Construction of Technological Systems, eds. W.E. Bijker, T.P. Hughes &amp; T.P. Pinch, The MIT Press, USA, pp. 51-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reverse salients in technological system evolution==
A reverse salient is the inverse of a [[Salients, re-entrants and pockets|salient]] that depicts the forward protrusion along an object’s profile or a line of battle.&lt;ref name="hughes2" /&gt; Hence, reverse salients are the backward projections along similar, continuous lines. The reverse salient subsequently refers to the sub-system that has strayed behind the advancing performance frontier of the system due to its lack of sufficient performance. In turn, the reverse salient hampers the progress or prevents the fulfillment of potential development of the collective system. In line with the socio-technical standpoint, reverse salients can be technical elements such as [[electric motor|motors]] and [[capacitor]]s of an electric system, or social elements such as organizations or productive units.&lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt;

Because reverse salients limit system development, the further development of the system lies in the correction of the reverse salient, where correction is attained through incremental or radical [[innovation]]s. The reverse salient denotes a focusing device, in the words of [[Nathan Rosenberg]],&lt;ref name="rosenberg"&gt;Rosenberg, N. (1969). The direction of technological change: Inducement mechanisms and focusing devices. Economic Development and Cultural Change, 18, 1-24.&lt;/ref&gt; for technological system [[Stakeholder theory|stakeholders]], which strive to remove it through innovation. It is possible that the reverse salient is not able to be corrected within the bounds of the existing technological system through [[innovation|incremental innovations]]. Consequently, [[innovation|radical innovations]] may be needed to correct the reverse salient. However, radical innovations can lead to the creation of new and different technological systems, as witnessed in the emergence of the [[alternating current]] system that overcame the problem of low cost electricity distribution, which the [[direct current]] system could not.&lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt;

Hence, the reverse salient is a useful concept for analyzing technological system evolution,&lt;ref name="dedehayir"&gt;Dedehayir, O. 2009, "[http://www.jiem.org/index.php/jiem/article/view/125 Bibliometric study of the reverse salient concept]", ''[[Journal of Industrial Engineering and Management]]'', Vol 2, No 3.&lt;/ref&gt; because often the analysis of technological systems centers on the factors that limit system development. More than technical components, these factors may also be social components. Subsequently, reverse salients may be more applicable in certain contexts to denote system performance hindrance than similar or overlapping concepts such as [[wikt:bottleneck|bottleneck]] and technological imbalance or disequilibrium.&lt;ref name="rosenberg2"&gt;Rosenberg, N. (1976). Perspectives on technology. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The reverse salient refers to an ''extremely complex situation in which individuals, groups, material forces, historical influences, and other factors have idiosyncratic, causal forces, and in which accidents as well as trends play a part. On the contrary, the disequilibrium concept suggests a relatively straightforward abstraction of physical science''.&lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt; Additionally, while the reverse salient and bottleneck concepts share similarities and have been used interchangeably in particular contexts, the reverse salient often refers to the sub-system that not only curbs the performance or output of the collective system but also requires correction because of its limiting affect. This is not necessarily the case with bottlenecks, which are ''geometrically too symmetrical''&lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt; and therefore do not represent the complexity of system evolution. For instance, a particular system’s output performance may be compromised due to a bottleneck sub-system but the bottleneck will not require improvement if the system’s present output performance is satisfactory. If, on the other hand, a higher level of performance would be required of the same system, the bottleneck may emerge as a reverse salient that holds the system back from attaining that higher output performance.

==Reverse salient examples==
While numerous studies illustrate technological systems that have been hampered by reverse salients, the most seminal work in this field of study is that of Hughes,&lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt; who gives a historical account of the development of Edison’s direct-current electric system. In order to supply electricity within a defined region of distribution, sub-systems such as the [[Electrical generator|direct current generator]] were identified as reverse salients and corrected. The most notable limitation of the direct-current system was, however, its low voltage transmission distance, and the resulting cost of distributing electricity beyond a certain range. To reduce costs, Edison introduced a three-wire system to replace the previously installed two-wire alternative and trialed different configuration of generators, as well as the usage of storage batteries. These improvements however did not correct the reverse salient completely. The satisfactory resolution of the problem was eventually provided by the radical innovation of the alternating current system.

Since Hughes' seminal work, other authors have also provided examples of reverse salients in different technological systems. In the [[ballistic missile]] technological development, where the systemic objective has been to increase missile accuracy, [[Donald Angus MacKenzie|MacKenzie]]&lt;ref name="mackenzie"&gt;MacKenzie, D. (1987). Missile accuracy: A case study in the social processes of technological change. In W. E. Bijker, T. P. Hughes &amp; T. J. Pinch (Eds.), The social construction of technological systems (pp. 195-222). USA: The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; has identified the [[gyroscope]] sub-system as a technical reverse salient. Takeishi and Lee&lt;ref name="takeishi"&gt;Takeishi, A., &amp; Lee, K. (2005). Mobile music business in japan and korea: Copyright management institutions as a reverse salient. Journal of Strategic Information Systems, 14, 291-306.&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that [[copyright|music copyright]] managing institutions have acted as a social reverse salient in the evolution of the [[mobile music]] technology system in Japan and Korea, where the objective was to proliferate mobile music throughout the end-user market. And further, Mulder and Knot,&lt;ref name="mulder"&gt;Mulder, K., &amp; Knot, M. (2001). PVC plastic: A history of systems development and entrenchment. Technology in Society, 23, 265-286.&lt;/ref&gt; see the development of the PVC ([[polyvinyl chloride]]) plastic technology system to have been sequentially hampered by several states of reverse salience, including: difficulty to process PVC material, quality of manufactured products, health concerns for individuals exposed to effluent from PVC manufacturing facilities, and finally the [[carcinogen]]ic nature of vinyl chloride.

==Analytical measure of reverse salience==
The magnitude of reverse salience emerges as an informative [[parameter]] in technological systems analysis as it signifies not only the technological disparity between sub-systems but also the entire system’s limited level of performance. Notwithstanding its importance, the literature studying technological system evolution has remained limited in terms of analytical tools that measure the state of reverse salience. Dedehayir and Mäkinen&lt;ref name="dedehayir makinen"&gt;[http://www.jotmi.org/index.php/GT/article/view/art87/158 Dedehayir, O. &amp; Mäkinen, S.J. 2008, "Dynamics of Reverse Salience as Technological Performance Gap: An Empirical Study of the Personal Computer Technology System", Journal of Technology Management and Innovation, vol. 3, no. 3, pp. 55-66.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="citer"&gt;[http://tta.mediacabinet.fi/en/research/citer/?id=82 CITER]&lt;/ref&gt; have subsequently proposed an [[Absolute value|absolute]] ''[http://www.jotmi.org/index.php/GT/article/view/art87/158 performance gap]'' measure of reverse salience magnitude. This measure evaluates the technological performance differential between the salient sub-system (i.e. the advanced sub-system) and the reverse salient sub-system at a particular point in time. In turn, by evaluating a series of performance differentials over time, the performance gap measure helps reflect the dynamics of change in the evolving technological system through changing reverse salience magnitude.

==Origin of term==
According to Thomas Hughes, the  name "reverse salient" was inspired by the Verdun [[Salient (military)|salient]] during the [[Battle of Verdun]], which he claimed his history professor in college referred to as a "reverse salient". He described it as a backward bulge in the advancing line of a [[military front]].&lt;ref name="American Heritage"&gt;[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1985/6/1985_6_65.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt; This is the same as a [[Salient (military)|salient]]; moreover, "reverse salient" is not a military term in general usage.

In [[scientific visualization]] a '''tensor glyph''' is an object that can visualize all or most of the nine degrees of freedom, such as [[acceleration]], twist, or [[shear matrix|shear]] – of a &lt;math&gt;3 \times 3&lt;/math&gt; matrix. It is used for [[tensor field]] visualization, where a data-matrix is available at every point in the grid. "Glyphs, or icons, depict multiple data values by mapping them onto the shape, size, orientation, and surface appearance of a base geometric primitive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cs.utah.edu/~gk/papers/vissym04/vissym04kindlmann.pdf | title=Superquadric Tensor Glyphs | work=Joint EUROGRAPHICS – IEEE TCVG Symposium on Visualization (2004) | year=2004 | accessdate=September 1, 2012 | author=Kindlmann, Gordon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tensor glyphs are a particular case of multivariate data [[Glyph (data visualization)|glyphs]].

There are certain types of glyphs that are commonly used:
* Ellipsoid
* Cuboid
* Cylindrical
* [[Superquadrics]]

According to Thomas Schultz and [[Gordon Kindlmann]], specific types of tensor fields "play a central role in scientific and biomedical studies as well as in image analysis
and feature-extraction methods."&lt;ref name="schultz"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~glk/sqd/schultzTVCG10SuperquadricTensorGlyphs.pdf | title=Superquadric Glyphs for Symmetric Second-Order Tensors | author=Schultz, Thomas and Gordon L.

===Projects===

====Commission on Global Security, Justice &amp; Governance====

The Hague Institute and the [[Stimson Center]], based in Washington, DC gathered "a select group of eminent statespersons and public intellectuals"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org/index.php?page=Programs-&amp;pid=180&amp;id=43&amp;progid=3&amp;fromHome=1 |title=Programs |publisher=Thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; to address global threats and challenges related to fragile states, climate change and the cyber-economy. The Commission, later renamed as the [[Albright-Gambari Commission]], convened consultations online and around the world to facilitate a report which complements the UN Post-2015 [[Sustainable Development Goals]] agenda, the UN Peacebuilding Architecture, the Fourth Global Conference on Cyberspace in The Hague, and the UN Conference on Parties on Climate Change in [[Paris]].

====The Hague Approach====

The Hague Approach was intended a flagship project of The Hague Institute. It comprises "six guiding principles for achieving sustainable peace in post-conflict situations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org/index.php?page=News-News_Articles-Recent_News-The_Hague_Approach:__What_is_it&amp;pid=138&amp;id=121#.UkGfdsanovQ |title=The Hague Approach: What is it? &amp;#124; Recent News |publisher=Thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2013, the Institute presented The Hague Approach Principles during the [[Peace Palace]] centenary to King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org/index.php?page=News-News_Articles-News_Archives-The_Hague_Institute_Commemorates_Peace_Palace_Centenary&amp;pid=159&amp;id=124&amp;jaar=2013 |title=The Hague Institute Commemorates Peace Palace Centenary &amp;#124; News Archives |publisher=Thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Global Governance Reform Initiative====

The Global Governance Reform Initiative tackled issues in cyberspace, migration, and oceans. The initiative brings together stakeholders from different sectors (government, civil society, international organizations, and business) and geographical regions to address pressing issues in global governance collectively. A three-day conference titled ''The Future of Cyber Governance'' convened in May 2014 and launched the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org/index.php?page=News-News_Articles-Recent_News-The_Future_of_Cyber_Governance&amp;pid=138&amp;id=236 |title=The Future of Cyber Governance &amp;#124; Recent News |publisher=Thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org |date=2014-05-19 |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Water Diplomacy Consortium (WDC)====

The Water Diplomacy Consortium combined expertise from five Netherlands-based organizations to serve as a “global hub” to exchange knowledge and experience in water technology and water governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dutchwatersector.com/news-events/news/7134-stockholm-water-week-new-platform-addresses-conflicting-claims-over-fresh-water-use.html |title=Stockholm water week: New platform addresses conflicting claims over fresh water use |publisher=Dutchwatersector.com |date=2013-09-06 |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hague Institute served as the lead partner of the WDC which also includes [[Netherlands Institute of International Relations Clingendael]], Water Governance Centre, [[UNESCO-IHE]] Institute for Water Education, and [[UPEACE]].

====Knowledge Platform Security &amp; Rule of Law====

Consisting of a network of experts and practitioners, the Knowledge Platform focused on building “security and rule of law” in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kpsrl.org/about/our-work |title=Our Work|accessdate=September 24, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927124228/http://www.kpsrl.org/about/our-work |archivedate=September 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The platform was originally launched in late spring 2012 by [[Ben Knapen]], former Dutch State Secretary for European Affairs and International Cooperation. The Hague Institute served as the primary facilitator for the platform’s partners including the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands]].

===Public Discussions===
[[File:Hague Institute Flag.jpg|thumb|left|The Hague Institute for Global Justice flag.]]

==Publications==
The Hague Institute's experts and programs produced a variety publications based on research and analysis on a scope of issues affecting global justice. These publications aimed to inform policymakers, academics, experts and the general public. In June 2014, the Institute launched a working paper series to complement its existing publication series of Policy Briefs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org/index.php?page=Publications&amp;pid=179#policybriefs |title=Publications |publisher=Thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Commentaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org/index.php?page=Commentary&amp;pid=174 |title=Recent Commentary |doi=10.1017/S0020589314000438 |publisher=Thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The working paper series aimed to "contribute original research of the highest quality to scholarly and policy debates."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org/index.php?page=Publications&amp;pid=179 |title=Publications |publisher=Thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working papers addressed [[just war theory]], sanctions against [[Iran]] and the relationship between constitutional law and [[global governance]].

In August 2013, the Institute published ''The Hague Approach Principles,'' six principles for achieving sustainable peace in post-conflict situations, and a comparative study of rule of law efforts in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]] titled, ''Promoting the Rule of Law in Peacebuilding: Lessons from Afghanistan and Iraq''. Both publications, based on empirical evidence, were presented at the centennial celebrations of the [[Peace Palace]] in The Hague.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org/index.php?page=News-News_Articles-Recent_News-The_Hague_Institute_Commemorates_Peace_Palace_Centenary&amp;pid=138&amp;id=124#.UjmtQsanovQ |title=The Hague Institute Commemorates Peace Palace Centenary &amp;#124; Recent News |publisher=Thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hague Approach Principles have subsequently been endorsed by current and former UN and global leaders including San-Hyun Song, Judy Cheng-Hopkins and [[Jan Eliasson]].

The Hague Institute produced a biannual magazine called ''Intersections'', which highlighted activities of the Institute and featured columns from public figures working at the intersection of peace, security and global justice issues.

On January 1, 2013 Abiodun Williams was appointed as the Institute's first president. He was preceded by Professor [[Willem van Genugten]] who served as Interim Dean of the Institute from September 2011 to December 2012. In an article by Dutch magazine [[De Groene Amsterdammer]] (4th April 2018), sources told the magazine that Williams insisted that the position of 'international dean' had to be restyled as 'president', in addition to a very high financial compensation package in order to lend him greater authority and benefits. &lt;ref name="groene"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.groene.nl/artikel/he-just-didn-t-seem-to-care|title=Hoe het Haagse Institute for Global Justice 20 miljoen subsidie verspeelde|work=De Groene Amsterdammer|access-date=2018-04-04|language=nl-NL}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch government granted up to 20 million Euros in subsidies for the Institute. According to staff members, Williams neglected fund raising, and spent considerable amounts of Institute funds on questionable expenses such as first class airfare, 5-star hotel rooms and long taxi rides not visibly related to the Institute's business, a claim confirmed by accounting firms. Furthermore, according to a reconstruction by Dutch newspaper ''[[de Volkskrant]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://krant.volkskrant.nl/?code=ST-725912-lg2Pi2ZtUBH224zGAop3-caps.volkskrant.nl&amp;state=paperId(90247),zone(NL)#/paper|title=de Volkskrant Krant Online|website=krant.volkskrant.nl|language=en|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Williams spent thousands of euros on expensive lunches at the nearby Carlton Ambassador hotel and first class flights since 'cattle class' was not good enough for him. A senior researcher quoted in the article indicates that there were many clashes between employees and Williams. According to the researcher citied, Williams distanced himself from staff whenever he felt challenged: 'Like it was beneath his dignity to talk to me directly. There was a culture clash. We academics are egalitarian. Though he was very focused on hierarchy and quickly felt criticized.'&lt;ref name="groene" /&gt; 

Reports claim his financial mismanagement eventually led to his departure in December 2016.  In 2013, for instance, Williams claimed 10,205.50 Euro for taxi rides, including a short trip of less than a kilometer from his home to the Dutch Parliament in The Hague, which amounted to 321 Euro. On 29 October he also took a cab to Groningen costing 722.25 Euro.&lt;ref&gt;Irene van der Linde and Tjitske Lingsma, "The Death of a White Elephant," International Justice Tribune, 6 April 2018, https://www.justicetribune.com/articles/death-white-elephant-hague&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly thereafter, another organization based in The Hague, the Center for International Legal Cooperation, considered a 'structural cooperation' out of a sense of responsibility for the loss of the subsidized funds. After viewing the financial documents, the CILC was startled by the 'deplorable situation'. Allegedly, Williams was seen behind the paper shredder for hours before his departure, which documents in question were destroyed is unclear.&lt;ref name="vk1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/geldnood-nekt-prestigieuze-haagse-denktank-toezichthouder-greep-te-laat-in~a4588737/|title=Geldnood nekt prestigieuze Haagse denktank, toezichthouder greep te laat in|last=Koelé|first=Theo|website=De Volkskrant|language=nl-NL|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;Anton Nijssen, Williams' close associate for a long time, has been appointed by the Supervisory Board as' liquidator 'who has to take care of' the (financial) handling of cases'. There are numerous creditors, including the former landlord VNG and the Indisch Herinneringscentrum, which last year already moved into the spacious building in The Hague where the last researcher of the Hague Institute for Global Justice left just before Easter. Williams’ mismanagement is said to have been the main reason for the subsequent failure of the institute.&lt;ref name="vk1" /&gt;

Following the reports of the alleged mismanagement, the topic was raised in the Dutch parliament where several political parties posed questions to the Dutch Minister of Economic Affairs and Climate, [[Eric Wiebes]]. Willem Moorlag from the Dutch socialist party [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|PvdA]] asked the minister whether there is any judicial ground to recover the lost funds from Williams and/or the Supervisory Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tweedekamer.nl/kamerstukken/kamervragen/detail?id=2018Z06289&amp;did=2018D23370|title=De frauduleuze ondergang van het The Hague Institute for Global Justice|website=www.tweedekamer.nl|language=nl|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The right-wing [[Forum for Democracy (Netherlands)|Forum voor Democratie]] (FvD) asked the minister why no action was undertaken against Williams when it was already clear after several months that he didn't fulfill his role as funds raiser.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl/kv-tk-2018Z06381.html|title=Het financiële fiasco rondom het Haagse Institute for Global Justice (IGJ)|last=Staten-Generaal|first=Tweede Kamer der|website=zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl|language=nl|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jan Paternotte from the social liberal [[Democrats 66|D66]] asked the minister how it was possible that the Institute still received subsidies after a critical report by [[PricewaterhouseCoopers|Price Waterhouse Coopers]] exposed the financial mismanagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nu.nl/algemeen/5206955/d66-pvda-en-fvd-willen-opheldering-geldverkwisting-haagse-denktank.html|title=D66, PvdA en FvD willen opheldering over 'geldverkwisting' Haagse denktank {{!}} NU - Het laatste nieuws het eerst op NU.nl|website=www.nu.nl|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Closure==
In April 2018, The Hague Institute for Global Justice closed down after becoming insolvent, reportedly caused by poor leadership from President Abiodun Williams, serious mismanagement, and lack of proper oversight of President Williams by the Advisory Board led by Dick Benschop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2018/04/the-hague-global-justice-institute-closes-due-to-lack-of-funding/ The Hague global justice institute closes due to lack of funding]; Dutchnews.nl; 4 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt;
