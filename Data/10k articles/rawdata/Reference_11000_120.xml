The '''Biodiversity Heritage Library for Europe''' (BHL-Europe) was a three-year (2009&amp;ndash;2012) EU project aimed to the coordination of [[digitization]] of literature on [[biodiversity]]. It involved 28 major natural history museums, botanical gardens, libraries and other European institutions. BHL-Europe was founded in [[Berlin]] in May 2009 and regarded itself as a European partner project of the [[Biodiversity Heritage Library]] (BHL) project, which was founded in 2005 and initially formed by ten (since 2009, twelve) United States and British libraries.

BHL-Europe was a [[best practice]] network. Important components were the coordination of digitization and the creation of appropriate infrastructure, as well as the consolidation of various European digitization projects under a common centralized and multilingual BHL portal. The scope was to make available the digitized literature under [[Open Access]] and [[Creative Commons licenses]], and to improve its searchability (using [[Optical character recognition|OCR]]).

BHL-Europe was also responsible for the creation of structures for long-term storage of digital information (durability of digital data).

==Composition of BHL-Europe==

The following 28 institutions functioned in May 2009 in Berlin as the founding members of the consortium of BHL-Europe:&lt;ref&gt;''http://www.bhl-europe.eu''{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''British Library Sound Archive''' (formerly the '''British Institute of Recorded Sound'''; also known as the '''National Sound Archive''' (NSA)&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=National Sound Archive|author=|access-date=June 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in [[London]], [[England]] is among the largest collections of recorded sound in the world, including [[music]], spoken word and ambient recordings.

It holds more than six million recordings,&lt;ref name="saveoursounds"&gt;{{cite web|title=Save our Sounds |url=http://www.bl.uk/projects/save-our-sounds|publisher=British Library|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; including over a million discs and 200,000 tapes. These include commercial record releases, chiefly from the [[United Kingdom|UK]], but with some from overseas, radio broadcasts (many from the [[BBC Sound Archive]]) and privately made recordings.

== History ==
[[File:PCopeland.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Peter Copeland]] began digitising the collection in the 1990s.]]
The history of the Sound Archive can be traced back to 1905, when it was first suggested that the [[British Museum]] should have a collection of audio recordings of poets and statesmen. [[The Gramophone Company]] started donating [[metal masters]] of audio recordings in 1906 (on the basis that records would wear out), with a number of donations being made up until 1933. These recordings included some by [[Nellie Melba]], [[Adelina Patti]], [[Enrico Caruso|Caruso]] and [[Francesco Tamagno]], and others of [[Lev Tolstoy]], [[Ernest Shackleton]], [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] and [[Lewis Waller]]. A number of [[Gramophone record|shellac pressings]] were also donated in the period 1920-50.&lt;ref name="day2001" /&gt;

In 1955, [[Patrick Saul]] founded the ''British Institute of Recorded Sound'', after realising that material was in danger of being lost as the British Museum did not maintain a comprehensive archive. The Institute was located in a property owned by the British Museum in [[Russell Square]] (with rent and rates guaranteed by [[Robert Mayer (philanthropist)|Robert Mayer]]), and supported by a donation from the [[Quaker]] trust in Birmingham. A public appeal resulted in the donation of thousands of shellac discs, which started off the collection.&lt;ref name="day2001" /&gt;

The British Institute of Recorded Sound became part of the [[British Library]], which had been split off from the British Museum, in April 1983.&lt;ref name="day2001"&gt;Day, T. (2001). The National Sound Archive: the first fifty years. pp 41-64 in ''Aural History: Essays on Recorded Sound'' (A. Linehan, Ed.). The British Library. {{ISBN|0-7123-4741-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later renamed the British Library Sound Archive. The metal masters originally collected by the British Museum were transferred to the Archive in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=British Museum Gramophone recordings|url=http://searchbeta.bl.uk/primo_library/libweb/action/display.do?tabs=detailsTab&amp;ct=display&amp;fn=search&amp;doc=BLLSA6875418&amp;indx=1&amp;recIds=BLLSA6875418&amp;recIdxs=0&amp;elementId=&amp;renderMode=poppedOut&amp;displayMode=full&amp;dscnt=0&amp;frbrVersion=&amp;vl%28174399379UI0%29=any&amp;frbg=&amp;scp.scps=scope%3A%28BLCONTENT%29&amp;tab=local_tab&amp;dstmp=1295010468281&amp;srt=rank&amp;mode=Basic&amp;dum=true&amp;vl%28freeText0%29=british%20museum%20recordings&amp;vid=BLVU1|publisher=British Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cain bairns''' or '''kain bairns''' were infants who, according to [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[superstition]], were seized by [[warlock]]s and [[witch]]es, and paid as a [[tax]] or [[tithe]] to the [[Devil]]. ''Càin'' is a Gaelic word for a [[tribute]], tax or tithe, and is the origin of the [[Scots language|Lowland Scots]] term. "[[Bairn]]", meaning child. The word was in use along the [[Scottish Borders]], according to [[Walter Scott]]'s ''Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border''.

It is unconnected with [[Cain]] in the [[Bible]].

[[File:Konrad III Miniatur 13 Jahrhundert.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Conrad III of Germany|Conrad III]] from the [[Bibliothèque royale de Belgique]], MS 467, folio 64 verso. This manuscript, from about 1240, contains the ''Chronica sancti Pantaleonis''.]]
The '''''Chronica regia Coloniensis''''' ("Royal Chronicle of Cologne", German: ''Kölner Königschronik''), also called the '''''Annales Colonienses maximi''''', is an anonymous [[medieval Latin]] chronicle that covers the years 576 to 1202. The original chronicle only went up to 1197, but a continuator later added the following few years' events. According to the historian Manfred Groten, the ''Chronica'' was probably first compiled about 1177 in [[Michaelsberg Abbey, Siegburg]], and then continued in Cologne. The earliest manuscript only contains an account down to 1175.

The chronicle is called "royal" because it is a history of the [[Roman emperors]], [[List of Frankish kings|Frankish kings]], [[Byzantine emperors]] and [[List of German monarchs|German kings]] and [[Holy Roman Emperor|emperors]]. It probably began with [[Augustus]], but the beginning of the chronicle is lost. Up to 1106 the ''Chronica'' depends on the works of [[Frutolf von Michelsberg]] and [[Ekkehard of Aura]], and then on until 1144 on the now lost ''[[Annales Patherbrunnenses]]''. After that it is an independent source. The author of the ''[[Chronica sancti Pantaleonis]]'' made use of the royal chronicle to cover the years down to 1199, and the historian [[Georg Waitz]] treated the former as a mere continuation of the latter and edited them together.

The author of the ''Chronica'' had access to a letter of [[Rainald of Dassel]], archbishop of Cologne, which gave him important information on the emperor's Italian expedition of 1166. He also knew details of the [[Siege of Lisbon|reconquest of Lisbon]] and the [[Second Crusade]] in 1147 because a contingent from the Rhineland took part. He includes a poem, "''De expugnatione Salaciae carmen''" (A Song on the Conquest of Alcácer do Sal), by one Gosuinus, describing how the crusaders captured [[Alcácer do Sal Municipality|Alcácer do Sal]], the ancient Salacia.&lt;ref&gt;The poem begins at p. 349 in Waitz (1880).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[embedded system|embedded]] [[computer system]]s on board the [[Mars rover]]s sent by [[NASA]] must withstand the high radiation levels and large temperature changes in space. For this reason their computational resources are limited compared to systems commonly used on Earth.&lt;ref name="ieeecomputer"&gt;[[Max Bajracharya]], [[Mark W. Maimone]], and [[Daniel Helmick]] (2008) ([[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] and [[California Institute of Technology]]); ''Autonomy for Mars rovers: past, present, and future''; published in: ''[[Computer (journal)|Computer]]'', a [[academic journal|journal]] of the [[IEEE]] [[IEEE Computer Society|Computer Society]], December 2008, Volume 41, Number 12, page 45, {{ISSN|0018-9162}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In operation ==
Direct [[teleoperation]] of a Mars rover is impractical, since the round trip communication time between Earth and Mars ranges from 8 to 42 minutes and the [[Deep Space Network]] system is only available a few times during each Martian day ([[Timekeeping on Mars#Sols|sol]]).&lt;ref name="ieeecomputer"/&gt; Therefore, a rover command team plans, then sends, a sol of operational commands to the rover at one time.&lt;ref name="ieeecomputer"/&gt;

A rover uses [[autonomy]] [[computer software|software]] to make decisions based on observations from its sensors.&lt;ref name="ieeecomputer"/&gt; Each pair of images for stereo the ''[[Mars Pathfinder#Sojourner rover|Sojourner]]'' rover could generate 20 navigation 3D points (with the initial software version the craft landed with). The [[Mars Exploration Rover|MER]] rovers can generate 15,000 (nominal) to 40,000 (survey mode) 3D points.&lt;ref name="ieeecomputer"/&gt;

==Performance comparisons==

With the exception of ''[[Curiosity rover|Curiosity]]'', each Mars rover has only one on-board computer. There are two identical on-board computers on ''Curiosity'', which is currently{{when|date=April 2018}} operating on its redundant computer, while its primary computer is being investigated for the reasons why it started to fail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/msl/news/msl20130228.html |title=Computer Swap on Curiosity Rover |date=February 28, 2013 |accessdate=2017-06-12 |publisher=NASA/JPL }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dato Capital''' is an [[online database]] of [[business information]] about companies and directors registered in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Gibraltar]], [[Spain]], [[Panama]], [[Cayman Islands]], [[Luxembourg]] and [[British Virgin Islands]].

The website publishes basic company and director information but complete reports are priced. The amount of available information about a company varies depending on the country of incorporation, ranging from financial data (UK companies) to just company name and type (Cayman Islands and BVI). Basic information about directors includes approximate figures of the number and location of the companies involved and an extract of appointment list. Not all of the countries have director data.

The parent company who owns the database and website is Netamo Systems SL, incorporated in Spain.

The company received attention in October 2014 when it published lists of deleted director profile links under the [[Right to be forgotten]] directive.

==History==

According to the parent company, it was incorporated in 2001; started working in business applications in 2003, and website was launched on 2007. First proof of datocapital.com existence dates to December 2008, and it shows a Spanish version with only Spanish companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Informes de Empresas (17 December 2008) |url=http://www.datocapital.com/ |website=Dato Capital |publisher=Archive.org |accessdate=3 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217163907/http://www.datocapital.com/ |archivedate=17 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Domain was registered on September 2006.
The first press mention of UK companies was on March 2014,&lt;ref name="uk1"/&gt; and Gibraltar and Panama appear in another interview of March 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McLeod|first1=Ewan|title=Eduardo Amo of Dato Capital|url=http://www.fintechprofile.com/2015/03/04/eduardo-amo-of-dato-capital/|accessdate=3 September 2015|publisher=FinTech Profile|date=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Latter countries were introduced during 2015.

==Business Model==

The company acts an information reseller, collecting data from public sources such as gazettes and official corporate registries; and private sources such as banks and credit agencies. Some of the data is published in the company website with an [[advertising]] model, and the rest of the data is sold in a [[paid content]] model. There is no registration available.

===Controversy with data aggregators===

The role of data aggregators has been criticized since 1995 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dorobek|first1=Christopher J|title=Web projects revive debate over data sales|url=http://gcn.com/Articles/1995/10/15/Web-projects-revive-debate-over-data-sales.aspx?m=1|accessdate=3 September 2015|publisher=GCN|date=15 October 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; with privacy &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Whitehouse|first1=Sheldon|title=Why Americans Hate Government Surveillance but Tolerate Corporate Data Aggregators|url=https://www.lawfareblog.com/why-americans-hate-government-surveillance-tolerate-corporate-data-aggregators|accessdate=3 September 2015|publisher=Lawfare|date=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and data accuracy &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=GOVERNMENT OF THE BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS|url=http://www.ifcforum.org/files/IFCF%20response%20to%20BVI%20FORMATTEDJan%202014.pdf|accessdate=3 September 2015|publisher=IFC Forum|date=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as main concerns.
Most negative views against data aggregators are based on the use of personal email addresses and details, but since the company publishes company director names, it may be considered personal data as well&lt;ref name="fortune"/&gt;

==Right to be forgotten==
Starting June 2014, [[Google]] started removing links to director profiles of the United Kingdom and Spain in the website, and the company published a daily updated list with deleted links for each country as a response.&lt;ref name=list_uk&gt;{{cite web|title=List of removed URLs in the UK due to the "Right to be Forgotten"|url=https://en.datocapital.com/uk/blog/uk-removed-urls-right-to-be-forgotten.html|website=Dato Capital|accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=list_spain&gt;{{cite web|title=List of removed URLs in Spain due to Right to be Forgotten|url=https://en.datocapital.com/es/blog/spain-removed-urls-right-to-be-forgotten.html|website=Dato Capital|accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company claims that business information is exempted from privacy laws, and that their users have the right to access business information all across the world.&lt;ref name="list_uk"/&gt;

An article by Roger Parloff was published in [[Fortune Magazine]] covering the story, citing 110 removed links, 64 from UK directors and 56 from Spanish directors (in September 2015, the website lists 174 links, 100 from the UK &lt;ref name="list_uk"/&gt; and 74 from Spain &lt;ref name="list_spain"/&gt;).&lt;ref name="fortune"/&gt;
[[Jimmy Wales]] quoted the article in a tweet saying ''I told you so. Where is our right to remember?"'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wales|first1=Jimmy|title=I told you so. Where is our right to remember?|url=https://twitter.com/jimmy_wales/status/524625445858582529|website=Twitter|accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another article was published in WSJ Blogs from Jason Wright, managing director of risk consulting firm [[Kroll Inc.]], citing the previous story and stating that ''"For investors, the “right to be forgotten” could become the right to be defrauded."''&lt;ref name="wsj"/&gt;

===Criticism===
The Fortune Magazine article also included opposing views from [[Viktor Mayer-Schönberger]], who stated that ''"My name is personal information.  So I, as an individual, can object to somebody else processing that information if that somebody does not perform a media function."''

The '''dechristianization of France during the French Revolution''' is a conventional description of the results of a number of separate policies conducted by various governments of [[France]] between the start of the [[French Revolution]] in 1789 and the [[Concordat of 1801]], forming the basis of the later and less radical ''[[laïcité]]'' policies. The goal of the campaign between 1793 and 1794 ranged from the public reclamation of the massive amounts of land, power, and money held by the [[Catholic Church]] in France to the termination of Catholic religious practice and of the religion itself.{{sfn|Tallet|1991|p=1-17}}{{sfn|Spielvogel|2006|p=549}}{{sfn|Tallet|1991|p=1}} There has been much scholarly debate over whether the movement was popularly motivated.{{sfn|Tallet|1991|p=1-17}}

The French Revolution initially began with attacks on church corruption and the wealth of the higher clergy, an action with which even many [[Christian]]s could identify, since the Roman Catholic church held a dominant role in [[Ancien Régime|pre-revolutionary France]]. During a two-year period known as the [[Reign of Terror]], the episodes of [[anti-clericalism]] grew more violent than any in modern [[History of Europe|European history]]. The new revolutionary authorities suppressed the church; abolished the Catholic monarchy; nationalized church property; exiled 30,000 priests and killed hundreds more.&lt;ref name="StoryChr"&gt;{{cite book |last= Collins|first= Michael|others= Mathew A Price |title=The Story of Christianity|year=1999 |publisher=Dorling Kindersley |quote=At first the new revolutionary government attacked church corruption and the wealth of the bishops and abbots who ruled the church -- causes with which many Christians could identify.

==Religion and the Catholic Church under the monarchy==

===Before 1789===
In [[Early modern France#France in the 17th and 18th centuries|18th-century France]], the vast majority of the population adhered to the [[Catholic Church]] as [[Catholicism]] had been since the [[Edict of Fontainebleau|revocation]] of the [[Edict of Nantes]] in 1685 the only religion officially allowed in the kingdom. Nonetheless, minorities of French Protestants (mostly [[Huguenot]]s &amp; German [[Lutherans]] in [[Alsace]]) and Jews still lived in France at the beginning of the Revolution. The [[Edict of Versailles]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?id=30EEq8R2feIC&amp;pg=PA212&amp;dq=Edict+of+versailles&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwixlpT-jfvNAhUqC8AKHc0HDREQ6AEIJjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Edict%20of%20versailles&amp;f=false Encyclopedia of the Age of Political Revolutions and New Ideologies, 1760-1815], p. 212, retrieved July 17, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; commonly known as the Edict of Tolerance, had been signed by Louis XVI on 7 November 1787 and had given non-Catholics in France the right to openly practice their religions as well as legal and civil status, which included the right to contract marriages without having to convert to the Catholic faith. At the same time, [[libertine]] thinkers popularized atheism and [[anti-clericalism]].

The [[Ancien Régime]] institutionalised the authority of the clergy in its status as the [[First estate|First Estate]] of the [[estates of the realm|realm]]. As the largest landowner in the country, the Catholic Church controlled properties which provided massive revenues from its tenants;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; the Church also had an enormous income from the collection of [[tithe]]s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Betros|first1=Gemma|title=THE FRENCH REVOLUTION AND THE CATHOLIC CHURCH|journal=History Review|date=Dec 2010|issue=68|pages=16–21|issn=0962-9610}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Church kept the registry of births, deaths, and marriages and was the only institution that provided hospitals and education in some parts of the country, it influenced all citizens.

===Between 1789 and 1792===
The event that launched the Revolution was the abolition of the privileges of the First and Second Estate on the [[Abolition of feudalism in France|night of 4 August 1789]]. In particular, it abolished the [[tithe]]s gathered by the Catholic clergy.&lt;ref&gt;Furet, François. "Night of August 4," in François Furet, and Mona Ozouf, eds. A Critical Dictionary of the French Revolution (Harvard University Press, 1989) pp 107-114.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen]] of 1789 proclaimed freedom of religion across France in these terms :

Article IV - Liberty consists of doing anything which does not harm others: thus, the exercise of the natural rights of each man has only those borders which assure other members of the society the enjoyment of these same rights. These borders can be determined only by the law.

Article X - No one may be disturbed for his opinions, even religious ones, provided that their manifestation does not trouble the public order established by the law.

On October 10, 1789, the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]] seized the properties and land held by the Catholic Church and decided to sell them as [[assignat]]s.

On July 12, 1790, the assembly passed the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]] that subordinated the Roman Catholic Church in France to the French government. It was never accepted by the [[Pope]] and other high-ranking clergy in [[Rome]].

==New policies of the Revolutionary authorities==
The programme of dechristianization waged against Catholicism, and eventually against all forms of Christianity, included:&lt;ref&gt;Compare {{harvtxt|Tallett|1991}}: "During the course of the year II much of France was subjected to a campaign of dechristianization, the aim of which was the eradication of Catholic religious practice, and Catholicism itself. The campaign, which was at its most intense in the winter and spring of 1793-94 [...] comprised a number of different activities. These ranged from the removal of plate, statues and other fittings from places of worship, the destruction of crosses, bells, shrines and other 'external signs of worship', the closure of churches, the enforced abdication and, occasionally, the marriage of constitutional priests, the substitution of a Revolutionary calendar for the Gregorian one, the alteration of personal and place names which had any eccesiastical connotations to more suitably Revolutionary ones, through to the promotion of new cults, notably those of reason and of the Supreme Being."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Latreille"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Latreille |first=A. |article=French revolution |title=New Catholic Encyclopedia |volume=v. 5 |p=972–973 |edition=Second |year=2002 |publisher=Thompson/Gale |isbn=0-7876-4004-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Spielvogel|2006|p=549}}{{qn|date=August 2015}}

An especially notable event that took place in the course of France’s dechristianization was the [[Cult of Reason#Festival of Reason|Festival of Reason]], which was held in [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame Cathedral]] on 10 November 1793.

The dechristianization campaign can be seen as the logical extension&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schaeffer|first1=Francis A.|title=How Should We Then Live|isbn=1581345364|pages=120–122|edition=L'Abri 50th Anniversary}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[materialism|materialist]] philosophies of some [[leader]]s of [[the Enlightenment]] such as [[Voltaire]], while for others with more prosaic concerns it provided an opportunity to unleash resentments against the Catholic Church (in the spirit of conventional [[anti-clericalism]]) and its clergy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lewis|1993|p=96}}: "Many of the Parisian Sections eagerly joined in the priest-hunt...."&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Revolution and the Church==
{{refimprove|section|date=October 2018}}&lt;!--7 paragraphs have no citations--&gt;
In August 1789, the State cancelled the taxing power of the Church. The issue of church property became central to the policies of the new revolutionary government. Declaring that all church property in France belonged to the nation, confiscations were ordered and church properties were sold at [[public auction]]. In July 1790, the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]] published the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]] that stripped clerics of their special rights &amp;mdash; the clergy were to be made employees of the state, elected by their parish or bishopric, and the number of bishoprics was to be reduced &amp;mdash; and required all priests and bishops to swear an oath of fidelity to the new order or face dismissal, deportation or death.

French priests had to receive [[pope|Papal]] approval to sign such an oath, and [[Pius VI]] spent almost eight months deliberating on the issue. On 13 April 1791, the Pope denounced the Constitution, resulting in a split in the French Catholic church. Over fifty percent became [[Refractory bishop|abjuring]] priests ("jurors"), also known as "constitutional clergy", and nonjuring priests as "refractory clergy".
[[File:Carte des prêtres assermentés en France en 1791.svg|thumb|Map of France showing the percentage of juring priests in 1791. The borders of the map are those of 2007, because the data come from archives of the modern [[departments of France|departments]].]]
In September 1792, the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]] legalized [[divorce]], contrary to Catholic doctrine. At the same time, the State took control of the birth, death, and marriage registers away from the Church. An ever-increasing view that the Church was a counter-revolutionary force exacerbated the social and economic grievances and violence erupted in towns and cities across France.

In [[Paris]], over a forty-eight-hour period beginning on 2 September 1792, as the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]] (successor to the National Constituent Assembly) dissolved into chaos, three Church bishops and more than two hundred priests were massacred by angry mobs; this constituted part of what would become known as the [[September Massacres]]. Priests were among those drowned in mass executions (''[[Drownings at Nantes|noyades]]'') for [[treason]] under the direction of [[Jean-Baptiste Carrier]]; priests and nuns were among the mass executions at [[Lyon]]s, for [[separatism]], on the orders of [[Joseph Fouché]] and [[Collot d'Herbois]]. Hundreds more priests were imprisoned and made to suffer in abominable conditions in the port of [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]].

Anti-church laws were passed by the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]] and its successor, the [[National Convention]], as well as by [[département]] councils throughout the country. Many of the acts of dechristianization in 1793 were motivated by the seizure of church gold and silver to finance the war effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Lewis | first=Gwynne | title=The French Revolution: Rethinking the Debate | publisher=Routledge | series=Historical Connections | date=1993 | isbn=978-1-134-93741-7 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DfmJAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA45 | accessdate=9 May 2017 | page=45 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In November 1793, the ''département'' council of [[Indre-et-Loire]] abolished the word ''dimanche'' ({{lang-en|Sunday}}).{{sfn|Vovelle|1991|p=180, 182}} The [[Gregorian calendar]], an instrument decreed by  [[Pope Gregory XIII]] in 1582, was replaced by the [[French Republican Calendar]] which abolished the [[Sabbath in Christianity|sabbath]], [[Calendar of saints|saints' days]] and any references to the Church. The seven-day week became ten days instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shaw|first1=Matthew|title=Reactions To The French Republican Calendar|journal=Fr Hist|date=1 March 2001|volume=15|issue=1|page=6|url=https://academic.oup.com/fh/article/15/1/4/603684/REACTIONS-TO-THE-FRENCH-REPUBLICAN-CALENDAR|accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It soon became clear, however, that nine consecutive days of work were too much, and that international relations could not be carried out without reverting to the Gregorian system, which was still in use everywhere outside of France. Consequently, the Gregorian Calendar was reimplemented in 1795.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Segura González|first=Wenceslao|year=n.d.|title=La reforma del calendario|url=http://www.alqantir.com/la_reforma_del_calendario.pdf|journal=EWT Ediciones|pages=42|isbn=9788461617296|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anti-clericalism|Anti-clerical]] parades were held, and the [[Archbishop of Paris]], [[Jean-Baptiste-Joseph Gobel]], was forced to resign his duties and made to replace his [[mitre]] with the red "[[Phrygian cap|Cap of Liberty]]." Street and place names with any sort of religious connotation were changed, such as the town of [[St. Tropez]], which became Héraclée. Religious holidays were banned and replaced with holidays to celebrate the harvest and other non-religious symbols. Many churches were converted into "temples of reason," in which Deistic services were held.&lt;ref name="HorneDavidson2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Horne|first1=Thomas Hartwell|last2=Davidson|first2=Samuel|title=An Introduction to the Critical Study and Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures|date=21 November 2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|language=English |isbn=978-1-108-06772-0|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Latreille"/&gt;{{sfn|Spielvogel|2006|p=549}}{{sfn|Tallet|1991|p=1}} Local people often resisted this dechristianisation and forced members of the clergy who had resigned to conduct Mass again. [[Maximilien Robespierre]] and the [[Committee of Public Safety]] denounced the dechristianizers as foreign enemies of the Revolution, and established their own new religion. This [[Cult of the Supreme Being]], without the superstitions of Catholicism,&lt;ref name="Censer and Hunt"/&gt; supplanted both Catholicism and the rival [[Cult of Reason]].  Both new religions were short-lived.&lt;ref name="Fremont-Barnes2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fremont-Barnes|first=Gregory|title=Encyclopedia of the Age of Political Revolutions and New Ideologies, 1760-1815: A-L|year=2007|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780313334467|page=237|quote=The cult was a deliberate attempt to counter the unsuccessful efforts at dechristianization, and the atheistic Cult of Reason, which reached its high point in the winter of the previous year.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Censer and Hunt"&gt;Censer and Hunt, ''Liberty, Equality, Fraternity: Exploring the French Revolution'', pp. 92–94.&lt;/ref&gt; Just six weeks before his arrest, on 8 June 1794 the still-powerful Robespierre personally led a vast procession through Paris to the [[Tuileries]] garden in a ceremony to inaugurate the new faith. His execution occurred shortly afterward, on 28 July 1794.{{sfn|Vovelle|1991|p=180, 182}}

By early 1795 a return to some form of religion-based faith was beginning to take shape and a law passed on 21 February 1795 legalized public worship, albeit with strict limitations. The ringing of church bells, religious processions and displays of the [[Christian cross]] were still forbidden.

As late as 1799, priests were still being imprisoned or deported to penal colonies. Persecution only worsened after the French army led by General [[Louis Alexandre Berthier]] captured [[Rome]] in early 1798, declared a new [[Roman Republic (18th century)|Roman Republic]], and imprisoned [[Pope Pius VI]], who would die in captivity in [[Valence, Drôme|Valence]], France in August 1799. Ultimately, with [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] now in ascendancy in France, year-long negotiations between government officials and the new Pope [[Pope Pius VII|Pius VII]] led to the [[Concordat of 1801]], formally ending the dechristianization period and establishing the rules for a relationship between the Catholic Church and the French State.

Victims of the Reign of Terror totaled somewhere between 20,000 and 40,000. According to one estimate, among those condemned by the revolutionary tribunals about 8 percent were aristocrats, 6 percent clergy, 14 percent middle class, and 70 percent were workers or peasants accused of hoarding, evading the draft, desertion, rebellion, and other purported crimes.&lt;ref name="history.com"&gt;[http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?articleId=209830 Harvey, Donald Joseph FRENCH REVOLUTION, History.com 2006 (Accessed 27 April 2007)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014173234/http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?articleId=209830 |date=14 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these social groupings, the clergy of the Catholic Church suffered proportionately the greatest loss.&lt;ref name="history.com"/&gt;

Anti-church laws were passed by the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]] and its successor, the [[National Convention]], as well as by [[département]] councils throughout the country. The [[Concordat of 1801]] endured for more than a century until it was abrogated by the government of the Third Republic, which established a policy of [[laïcité]] on 11 December 1905.

==Toll on the Church==
Under threat of death, imprisonment, military conscription, and loss of income, about twenty thousand constitutional priests were forced to abdicate and hand over their letters of ordination, and six thousand to nine thousand of them agreed or were [[Forced marriage|coerced to marry]].

'''Ethnic pornography''' is a genre of [[pornography]] featuring [[pornographic actor|performers]] of specific [[ethnic group]]s, or depictions of [[miscegenation|interracial sexual activity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FCFOEtZdtMoC&amp;pg=PA208 |title=Pornography: Film and Culture |first=Peter |last=Lehman |page=208 |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=2006 |accessdate=December 2, 2011|isbn=9780813538716 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though productions can feature any type of ethnic group (Caucasian, Asian, African American), the most common emphasis is on relationships between white- and black-skinned individuals.

==Interracial pornography in the United States {{anchor|Interracial pornography}}==
Interracial pornography features performers of differing racial and ethnic backgrounds and often employs [[ethnic stereotype|ethnic and racial stereotypes]] in its depiction of performers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vocativ.com/news/227328/porns-race-problem/ |title=Porn's Race Problem |publisher=Vocativ.com |date=2015-09-01 |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ingraham"&gt;Ingraham, Natalie (2015). "Pornography, genres of". The International Encyclopedia of Human Sexuality. Vol. 2. Malden, MA: Wiley-Blackwell. pp. 953–956. doi:10.1002/9781118896877.wbiehs366. {{ISBN|9781405190060}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While the performers may not actually be of the particular advertised race in the video, they may be featured if they conform to stereotypical ideas of what that race looks like.&lt;ref name="ingraham" /&gt; Even though some white actresses refuse to work with black actors, the genre is increasingly popular among white male viewers.&lt;ref name="ingraham" /&gt;

''[[Behind the Green Door]]'' (1972) was one of the first pornographic films to feature sex between a white actress ([[Marilyn Chambers]]) and a black actor ([[Johnnie Keyes]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vancouversun.com/entertainment/movie-guide/Classic+porn+star+Marilyn+Chambers+dead/1492289/story.html |title=Interracial porn pioneer Marilyn Chambers dead at 56 |date=April 15, 2009 |work=[[The Vancouver Sun]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416040643/http://www.vancouversun.com/entertainment/movie-guide/Classic%2Bporn%2Bstar%2BMarilyn%2BChambers%2Bdead/1492289/story.html |archivedate=April 16, 2009 |accessdate=June 19, 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, some of [[Pornography in the United States|American pornography]]'s white actresses were allegedly warned to avoid [[African American]] males, both on-screen and in their personal lives. One rationale was the purportedly widespread belief that appearing in interracial pornography would ruin a white performer's career, although some observers have said that there is no evidence that this is true. ''[[AVN (magazine)|Adult Video News]]'' critic Sheldon Ranz wrote in 1997 that:

{{Quote|We keep hearing a lot about '[[The powers that be (phrase)|the powers that be]]' that tell white women that it's not in their 'interest' to work with blacks. Is there any proof that [[Ginger Lynn|Ginger [Lynn]]]'s scene with Tony El-Lay in ''Undressed Rehearsal'' hurt her career? [[Nina Hartley]] still gets lots of bookings in Southern [[strip club]]s, especially [[Texas]], even though she is an avowed interracialist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup |title=Stars Who Refuse Interracial Scenes |first=Sheldon |last=Ranz |date=April 5, 1997 |newsgroup=rec.arts.movies.erotica |url=https://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.movies.erotica/msg/62a4233ee98f905a |accessdate=July 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On the other hand, some commentators have pointed out that the lack of [[racial segregation|racial divide]] and "nonsense about 'attraction' and 'preference'" in the [[Pornography in Europe|European pornographic scene]] allowed many top European female performers to appear in American interracial pornographic films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lukeisback.com/essays/essays/racism.htm |title=Racism |accessdate=January 18, 2008 |author=[[Luke Ford (blogger)|Luke Ford]] |year=2005 |quote=[[Angel Dark]], Stacy Silver, [[Sylvia Saint]], Jane Darling, Liliane Tiger, Monica Sweetheart, Sharka Blue, Ellen Saint, etc., have all done IR, and not because they had to do it to salvage their careers either. And these are all hot European starlets who can pick and choose any guy with whom to do a scene, but don't go around talking nonsense about "attraction" and "preference." |publisher=LukeIsBack.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lexington Steele]] told [[The Root (magazine)|''The Root'']] in a 2013 interview that white female performers who appear in interracial pornography may conceal their careers due to social pressure from their intimates, arguing "It's just an element of American culture that still exists, and that is the feeling that a white female will be deflowered or soiled, if you will, by doing a scene with a black male".&lt;ref name="root"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2013/04/pornindustry_racism_whats_behind_it/ |title=Is the Porn Industry Racist? |accessdate=July 24, 2016 |date=April 3, 2013 |publisher=[[The Root (magazine)|The Root]] |first=Keli |last=Goff |authorlink=Keli Goff }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a survey by Jon Millward, while 87% of porn actresses are willing to take a [[Facial (sex act)|facial]], only 53% will do interracial porn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/james-deen-is-pissed-off-about-racism-in-the-porn-industry |title=James Deen Is Pissed Off About Racism in the Porn Industry |first=Rachel |last=Bell |date=September 3, 2015 |publisher=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] |accessdate=July 24, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403010818/https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/james-deen-is-pissed-off-about-racism-in-the-porn-industry |archivedate=April 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jonmillward.com/blog/studies/deep-inside-a-study-of-10000-porn-stars/ |title=Deep Inside: A Study of 10,000 Porn Stars |website=Jonmillward.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alleged role of agents===
Sophie Dee, prominent figure of the genre, claimed in a 2010 interview that agents often pressure white female performers not to appear in interracial pornography, although they will be paid better for performing with black men and their careers will not be damaged in any way, pointing at positive examples of some [[Vivid Entertainment]] actresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.xcitement.com/interview/?page_id=907 |title=Xcitement Interviews: Sophie Dee |first=Cindi |last=Loftus |date=April 2010 |publisher=Xcitement Magazine |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100630012304/http://www.xcitement.com/interview/?page_id=907 |archivedate=June 30, 2010 |accessdate=June 19, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aurora Snow]] noted in a 2013 article that the major factor preventing several white actresses from doing interracial scenes is "career anxiety" imposed by agents rather than their own racial bias. Tee Reel, male porn star and one of the few black agents in the U.S. industry, had a concurring opinion, saying, "In the business, some girls who say they don't do interracial, I've actually had sex with, off-camera."&lt;ref name="beast"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/03/05/interracial-sex-still-taboo-for-many-porn-stars.html |title=Interracial Sex Still Taboo for Many Porn Stars |accessdate=October 13, 2013 |date=March 5, 2013 |publisher=[[The Daily Beast]] |first=Aurora |last=Snow |authorlink=Aurora Snow}}&lt;/ref&gt; Porn star Kristina Rose has alleged that some agents tell younger actresses that they will earn less from performing in interracial pornography to bar their involvement, although the opposite is true on a global level.&lt;ref name="beast" /&gt;

==Scholarly criticism==
In Chapter 3 of her book ''Porn Studies'', [[Linda Williams (film scholar)|Linda Williams]], professor at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], examines the film ''Crossing the Color Line'' starring [[Sean Michaels (actor)|Sean Michaels]], a black actor, and [[Christi Lake]], a white actress.&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;{{cite book |last=Williams |first=Linda |authorlink=Linda Williams (film scholar) |chapter=Skin Flicks on the Racial Border: Pornography, Exploitation, and Interracial Lust |editor-last=Williams |editor-first=Linda |title=Porn Studies |year=2004 |publisher=Duke University Press |location=Durham, N.C. |isbn=978-0-8223-3300-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|273}} In the interviews portion of the film, Michaels and Lake express how being "color-blind" is a progressive approach to interracial porn.&lt;ref name=Williams /&gt;{{rp|273}} Williams identifies a contradiction between these interviews and the subsequent performance, in which both actors make several references to the differences in skin color between them.&lt;ref name=Williams /&gt;{{rp|273–277}} For example, Lake refers to Michaels' genitalia as a "big black dick".&lt;ref name=Williams /&gt;{{rp|274}} Williams argues that by pointing out racial differences, race is being made the main point of intrigue for the audience, which perpetuates the exotification of racial differences.&lt;ref name=Williams /&gt;{{rp|275–276}} She argues that the eroticized sexual tension in interracial pornography dates back in American history to slavery.&lt;ref name=Williams /&gt;{{rp|271}}

Mireille Miller-Young, professor of feminist studies at [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], argues that while the porn industry hypersexualizes African-American pornographic actresses, they are often paid less, hired less, and given less attention during health checks than their white counterparts.&lt;ref name=Miller-Young&gt;{{cite journal |last=Miller-Young |first=Mireille |year=2010 |title=Putting Hypersexuality to Work: Black Women and Illicit Eroticism in Pornography |journal=Sexualities |url=https://law.wustl.edu/centeris/BlackSexualEconomiesProject/archive/papers/MMY_Hypersexuality_Sexualities13(2)2010.pdf |doi=10.1177/1363460709359229 |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=219–235 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars{{who|date=July 2016}} also argue that white women are upheld as the most-prized commodity in the industry, while black women are often devalued for their sex work, regardless of their perceived erotic abilities.&lt;ref name=Miller-Young /&gt;

[[File:Bolide.jpg|thumb|"Fiery serpents" - a flying bolide]]
A '''Fiery Serpent''' (also known as a '''snake-Lubac''', '''Letun''', '''Letuchy''', '''Litavets''', '''Maniac''', '''nalyot''', '''ognyanny''' and '''prelestnik''') (Russian: Огненный змей) is an [[Demon|evil entity]] common to [[Slavic mythology]], which presents itself as an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] snake demon.

==Description==
The Fiery Serpent generally resembles a [[Phosphorescence|glowing]], fiery [[rocket]], a [[Flame|flaming]] [[broom]], or a ball of blue fire. According to the mythology, it is an [[Demon|evil spirit]] that reveals itself at night. The serpent has been portrayed as a spirit that presents itself as the form of a lost love to [[widow]]s or women grieving the loss of a lover. In their [[grief]], and their desperation to be rejoined with their lost love, women do not recognize the serpent and become convinced that their [[love]]r has returned.

The fiery serpent lacks the ability to [[Deafness|hear]] and [[Muteness|speak]] properly. It is told that those who are visited by the serpent experience [[weight loss]], exhibit signs of [[insanity]] and eventually commit [[suicide]].

== Myths about the fiery serpent ==
According to [[East Ukraine|Eastern Ukrainian]] legends, whilst traveling, the fiery serpent throws beautiful [[gift]]s to grieving women and [[village]]rs, including [[bead]]s, rings and [[handkerchief]]s.

The serpent is often represented in [[Slavic mythology|Slavic folk tales]] as entering a person's house through the [[chimney]]. The serpent may bring gifts of gold - but those gifts turn to horse [[manure]] at sunrise. In addition, victims of the serpent often experience [[hallucination]]s, including visions of [[supernatural]] [[Torture|torment]], such as [[Breastfeeding|suckling on breasts]] which excrete blood rather than milk. The fiery serpent has no [[spinal cord]] and cannot correctly [[Pronunciation|pronounce]] certain words. For example, instead of "Jesus Christ," the serpent may say "Sus Christ", or "Chudoroditsa," in place of "Bogoroditsa" ([[Virgin Mary|mother of God]]), the woman who gave birth to a miracle.

If a child is born out of a relationship with the serpent, then that child is believed to be born with black skin, with [[Hoof|hooves]] instead of feet, eyes without [[eyelid]]s and a cold body. Such a child is fated to live a very short life.

== Sources of information ==
Myths about the fiery serpent are found in [[Serbia|Serbian]] epic songs in Russian bylinas, [[fairy tale]]s and conspiracies, as well as the hagiographic [[The Tale of Peter and Fevronia|Story of Peter and Fevronia of Murom]], which is based on folk material.

== The origin of the image ==
Visible manifestations of a fiery serpent show [[meteoroid#Fireball|fireball]]s flying deviated or horizontal, which can be seen rushing through the air in the form of long, wide ribbons of red sparks. The image of a flying [[dragon]] was associated with signs of temporary insanity, depression, or hallucinations - particularly in women who have lost their loved ones.

== Fiery serpents in literature ==
The image of a fiery serpent was described by the Russian poet [[Afanasy Fet|Afanasy Afanasievich Fet]] in his ballad, "Snake", written in 1847.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24743">The '''history of the [[Forbidden City]]''' begins in the 15th century when it was built as the palace of the Ming emperors of China. It is located in the centre of [[Beijing]], [[China]], and was the [[China|Chinese]] imperial palace from the mid-[[Ming Dynasty]] to the end of the [[Qing Dynasty]] in 1912. It has been a museum since the 1920s. 

Built from 1406 to 1420, the palace complex has undergone many changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=故宫到底有多少间房 (How many rooms in the Forbidden City) |url=http://www.singtaonet.com/arts/t20060927_343639.html |publisher=Singtao Net |date=2006-09-27 |accessdate=2007-07-05 |language=Chinese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070718140600/http://www.singtaonet.com/arts/t20060927_343639.html |archivedate=2007-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After serving as the imperial palace for some five hundred years, the Forbidden City became a museum, the Palace Museum, in 1925. In 1987, it was declared a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/439|title=UNESCO World Heritage List: Imperial Palaces of the Ming and Qing Dynasties in Beijing and Shenyang|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=2007-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and Ming Dynasty==

[[File:Verbotene-Stadt1500.jpg|thumb|The Forbidden City as depicted in a [[Ming Dynasty]] painting]]

The site of the Forbidden City was situated on the [[Khanbaliq|Imperial city]] during the [[Mongol]] [[Yuan Dynasty]]. After the collapse of the Yuan Dynasty, the [[Hongwu Emperor]] of the [[Ming Dynasty]] moved the capital from Beijing in the north to [[Nanjing]] in the south, and in 1369 ordered that the Yuan palaces be razed.  His son [[Zhu Di]] was created Prince of Yan with his seat in Beijing.  In 1402, Zhu Di usurped the throne and became the [[Yongle Emperor]].  He made Beijing a secondary capital of the Ming empire, and construction began in 1406 of what would become the Forbidden City.&lt;ref name="Yu 18"&gt;Yu (1984) p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; The Forbidden City's plan was designed by many architects and designers, and then it was examined by the Emperor's Ministry of Work.&lt;ref name="journal"/&gt; The chief architects and engineers include Cai Xin,&lt;ref name="journal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pacificrim.usfca.edu/research/perspectives/mallas.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627021008/http://www.pacificrim.usfca.edu/research/perspectives/mallas.pdf|archivedate=2010-06-27 |title=Vatican City and the Forbidden City; St. Peter's Square and Tiananmen Square: A Comparative Analysis.

Construction lasted 14 years and employed the work of 100,000 skilled artisans and up to a million labourers.&lt;ref name="Yang 15"&gt;Yang (2003) p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;  The pillars of the most important halls were made of whole logs of precious ''[[Phoebe (plant)|Phoebe zhennan]]'' wood ({{zh|c=楠木|p=nánmù}}) found in the jungles of south-western China.  Such a feat was not to be repeated in subsequent years — the great pillars seen today were rebuilt using multiple pieces of pinewood in the Qing Dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;The only surviving large-scale hall built with whole logs of Phoebe zhennan is at Zhu Di's tomb at the [[Ming Tombs]] outside Beijing. This hall is only slightly smaller than the [[Hall of Supreme Harmony]] in the Forbidden City: [http://www.china.org.cn/english/features/atam/115650.htm China.org.cn: The Thirteen Ming Tombs in Beijing]&lt;/ref&gt; The grand terraces and large stone carvings were made of stone from quarries near Beijing.  The larger pieces could not be transported conventionally. Instead, wells were dug along the way, and water from the wells was poured on the road in deep winter, forming a layer of ice. The stones were dragged along the ice.&lt;ref name="CCTV"&gt;{{cite video | people=China Central Television, The Palace Museum |date=2005 | url=http://www.cctv.com/history/special/C15041/01/index.shtml| title=Gugong: "I. Building the Forbidden City" | medium=Documentary | location=China | publisher=CCTV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The floors of major halls were paved with "golden bricks" ({{zh|c=金砖|p=jīnzhuān}}), baked with clay from seven counties of [[Suzhou]] and [[Songjiang Town|Songjiang]] prefectures.&lt;ref name="Yu 21"&gt;Yu (1984) p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Each batch took months to bake, resulting in smooth bricks that ring with a metallic sound.&lt;ref name="Yang 15"/&gt;  Much of the interior pavings seen today are six-century-old originals.

Soil excavated during construction of the moat was piled up to the north of the palace to create an artificial hill, the [[Jingshan Park|Jingshan hill]].&lt;ref name="Yu 20"&gt;Yu (1984) p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Even before the palace was completed, Zhu Di moved to Beijing under the guise of "touring and hunting" (巡狩): the administrative centre of the empire gradually shifted from Nanjing to Beijing. When the palace was completed in 1420, Zhu Di moved there and Beijing officially became the primary capital of the empire.&lt;ref name="CCTV"/&gt; However, scarcely nine months after their construction, the three main halls including the [[throne room]] burnt down, and it would be 23 years before they were rebuilt.

From 1420 to 1644, the Forbidden City was the seat of the Ming Dynasty. In April 1644, rebel forces led by [[Li Zicheng]] captured it, and [[Chongzhen Emperor|Chongzhen]], the last emperor of the Ming Dynasty, hanged himself on Jingshan Hill.  Li Zicheng proclaimed himself emperor of the [[Shun Dynasty]] at the Hall of Military Eminence.&lt;ref&gt;Yang (2003) p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; However, he soon fled before the combined armies of former Ming general [[Wu Sangui]] and [[Manchu]] forces, setting fire to parts of the Forbidden City in the process.&lt;ref&gt;p 3734, {{cite book |last=Wu |first= Han|authorlink= Wu Han (PRC)|title=朝鲜李朝实录中的中国史料 (Chinese historical material in the Annals Yi Dynasty)|year=1980 |publisher=Zhonghua Book Company|location=Beijing |id=CN / D829.312 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Qing Dynasty==

[[File:Kangxi-Verbotene-Stadt1.jpg|thumb|The [[Kangxi Emperor]] returning to the Forbidden City after a tour to the south.]]
[[File:Die_Gartenlaube_(1853)_b_445.jpg|thumb|A depiction of the Forbidden City in the German book ''The Garden Arbor'' (1853)]]

By October 1644, the Manchus had achieved supremacy in northern China, and prince regent [[Dorgon]] proclaimed the [[Qing Dynasty]] as the successor to the Ming. A ceremony was held at the Forbidden City to proclaim the young [[Shunzhi Emperor]] as ruler of all China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Muoruo|last= Guo|authorlink= Guo Moruo|title= 甲申三百年祭 (Commemorating 300th anniversary of the Jia-Sheng Year)|work= New China Daily|date=1944-03-20 |language= Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Qing rulers largely maintained the Palace's Ming Dynasty scheme, except for the names of some of the principal buildings. The Ming Dynasty names favoured the character ''ji'' ({{zh|t=極|s=极}}), meaning "supremacy" or "extremity", while the new Qing names favoured names meaning "peace" and "harmony"; for example, ''Huangji Dian'', the "Hall of Imperial Supremacy", was changed to ''Taihe Dian'', the "[[Hall of Supreme Harmony]]".&lt;ref name="CCTV２"&gt;{{cite video | people=China Central Television, The Palace Museum |date=2005 | url=http://www.cctv.com/history/special/C15041/01/index.shtml| title=Gugong: "II. Ridgeline of a Prosperous Age" | medium=Documentary | location=China | publisher=CCTV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, signs and [[Nameplate|name plates]] were made bilingual ([[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Manchu language|Manchu]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=故宫外朝宫殿为何无满文？ (Why is there no Manchu on the halls of the Outer Court?) |url=http://ha.people.com.cn/news/2006/06/16/109613.htm |work=People Net |publisher= |id= |pages= |page= |date=2006-06-16 |accessdate=2007-07-12 |language=Chinese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201185034/http://ha.people.com.cn/news/2006/06/16/109613.htm |archivedate=2008-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the main part of the Empress's official bedchamber, the Hall of Earthly Tranquility, became a [[Shamanism|Shamanist]] shrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://125.35.3.4/China/phoweb/BuildingPage/1/B488.htm |title=坤宁宫 (Palace of Earthly Tranquility) |accessdate=2007-07-12 |author=Zhou Suqin |publisher=The Palace Museum |pages= |language=Chinese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929095215/http://125.35.3.4/China/phoweb/BuildingPage/1/B488.htm |archivedate=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Forbidden City thus became the power centre of the Qing Dynasty. In 1860, during the Second [[Opium War]], Anglo-French forces took control of the Forbidden City and occupied it until the end of the war.&lt;ref name="CCTV11"&gt;{{cite video | people=China Central Television, The Palace Museum |date=2005 | url=http://www.cctv.com/history/special/C15041/01/index.shtml| title=Gugong: "XI. Flight of the National Treasures" | medium=Documentary | location=China | publisher=CCTV}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1900 [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] fled from the Forbidden City during the [[Boxer Rebellion]], leaving it to be occupied by forces of the treaty powers until the following year.

After being home to twenty-four emperors, fourteen of the Ming Dynasty and ten of the Qing Dynasty, the Forbidden City ceased to be the political centre of China in 1912, with the abdication of [[Puyi]], the last Emperor of China.  However, under an agreement signed between the [[Aisin Gioro|Qing imperial house]] and the new [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]] government, Puyi was allowed, in fact required, to live within the walls of the Forbidden City. Puyi and his family retained the use of the Inner Court, while the Outer Court was handed over to the Republican authorities. A museum was established in the Outer Court in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Yang (2003) p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;

==After the revolution==
[[File:TropasRepublicanasCiudadProhibida19170712--fightforrepublic00putn.jpeg|thumb|Republican troops fighting to retake the Forbidden City on July 12, 1917, after Zhang Xun’s attempted imperial restoration]]

Opposition to Puyi staying in the palace grew during the [[Beiyang government]] of the Republic of China.&lt;ref name="Yan4"&gt;{{cite book|last=Yan|first=Chongnian|authorlink=Yan Chongnian|title= 正说清朝十二帝 (True Stories of the Twelve Qing Emperors)|url=http://culture.people.com.cn/GB/40472/55544/55547/55560/3875789.html|year=2004|publisher=Zhonghua Book Company|location=Beijing|isbn=7-101-04445-X|language=Chinese|chapter=国民—战犯—公民 (National – War criminal – Citizen)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923 [[Reginald Johnston]], Puyi's English teacher, told Puyi about [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuchs]] smuggling treasures out of the palace and selling them in antique shops. Puyi ordered an audit of the palace's collections. Before it began, a fire consumed the gardens of the Palace of Establishing Prosperity (建福宫) where the bulk of the [[Qianlong Emperor]]'s collection of art works was stored.&lt;ref name="Jianfu1"&gt;{{cite news |title= Forbidden City 4__Destruction and Rebuilding|url= http://english.cri.cn/4406/2007/02/12/1281@195333.htm|publisher= CRI Online|date=2007-02-15|accessdate=2007-07-20|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his memoir, Puyi claimed the fire was started by the eunuchs to conceal their embezzlement. This fire further fuelled public sentiments against Puyi's continued occupation of the palace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Aisin-Gioro |first=Puyi |title=From Emperor to citizen : the autobiography of Aisin-Gioro Pu Yi | year= 1964|publisher=Foreign Language Press|location=Beijing |isbn=0-19-282099-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gardens were not rebuilt until 2005.&lt;ref name="Jianfu2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinaheritagefund.com/jfg.html |title=Jianfu Palace Garden |accessdate=2007-07-20 |publisher=China Heritage Fund |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006085051/http://www.chinaheritagefund.com/jfg.html |archivedate=October 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=February 2016}}

In 1924, [[Feng Yuxiang]] took control of Beijing in a coup. Denouncing the previous agreement with the Qing imperial house, Feng expelled Puyi from the Palace.&lt;ref name="Yan4"/&gt; On October 10, 1925 ([[Double Ten Day]]), the Palace Museum was established in the Forbidden City. The large amount of treasures and curiosities housed there were gradually catalogued and put on public display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Cao Kun |title= 故宫X档案: 开院门票 掏五毛钱可劲逛 (Forbidden City X-Files: Opening admission 50 cents)|url= http://culture.people.com.cn/GB/22226/53974/53977/3750782.html|work= Beijing Legal Evening|publisher= People Net|date=2005-10-06|accessdate=2007-07-25|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon, however, the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion of China]] threatened the safety of these national treasures, and they were moved out of the Forbidden City. Starting in 1933, important artefacts were packed and evacuated. They were first shipped to Nanjing and thence to Shanghai. However, the [[Japanese Imperial Army|Japanese forces]] soon threatened Shanghai. The [[Executive Yuan]] decided to evacuate the collections to the remote west. The artifacts were split into three lots. One took the northern route towards [[Shaanxi]]. One was shipped up the [[Yangtze River]] towards [[Sichuan]]. The final lot was transported south towards [[Guangxi]]. The pace of the Japanese advance forced the artifacts to be moved quickly to escape bombing and capture, often with just hours' notice. In the end, all three collections reached the relative safety of [[Sichuan]], where they stayed until the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;See map of the evacuation routes at: {{cite web |url= http://www.npm.gov.tw/en/administration/about/tradition.htm|title= National Palace Museum – Tradition &amp; Continuity|accessdate=2007-05-01 |publisher= National Palace Museum }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the Japanese army captured the Forbidden City in Beijing, but were only able to remove a few large bronze tubs and a few pieces of cannon. Most of these were recovered after the war, in [[Tianjin]].&lt;ref name="CCTV11"/&gt;

At the end of [[World War II]] in 1945, the artifacts were moved back to Nanjing and Beijing.  Remarkably, none were damaged or lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.npm.gov.tw/en/administration/about/tradition.htm|title= National Palace Museum – Tradition &amp; Continuity|accessdate=2007-05-01 |publisher= National Palace Museum }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1940s, with the [[Kuomintang]] losing the Chinese Civil War, [[Chiang Kai-shek]] ordered the artifacts from the Forbidden City and the National Museum in Nanjing to be moved to [[Taiwan]]. In the event no artifacts were shipped from Beijing, but many of the best collections stored in Nanjing were shipped to Taiwan, and today form the core of the [[National Palace Museum]] in [[Taipei]].&lt;ref name="Three"&gt;{{cite news|title= 三大院长南京说文物 (Three museum directors talk artifacts in Nanjing)|url= http://www.people.com.cn/GB/paper447/10416/949293.html|work= Jiangnan Times|publisher= People Net|date= 2003-10-19|accessdate= 2007-07-05|language= Chinese|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081201133727/http://www.people.com.cn/GB/paper447/10416/949293.html|archivedate= 2008-12-01|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Under the People's Republic of China==
[[File:Forbiddencity notopen06.JPG|thumb|The East Glorious Gate under renovation as part of the 19-year restoration process.]]

In 1949, the People's Republic of China was proclaimed at [[Tiananmen]], directly in front of the Forbidden City. Over the next two decades various proposals were made to raze or reconstruct the Forbidden City to create a public park, a transport interchange, or "places of entertainment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Jun|last= Wang|title= Forbidden City reconstruction plans|url= http://www.gmw.cn/02sz/2006-09/01/content_493893.htm|publisher= Guangming Daily|date=2006-09-01|accessdate=2007-05-01|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Forbidden City suffered some damage during this period, including the dismantling of the throne in the Hall of Middle Harmony, the removal of name tablets from several buildings and gardens, and the demolition of some minor gates and structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Jie|last= Chen|title= Several horrifying reconstruction proposals had been made for the Forbidden City|url= http://news.eastday.com/eastday/node81741/node81803/node112035/userobject1ai1829390.html|work= Yangcheng Evening News|publisher= Eastday|date=2006-02-04|accessdate=2007-05-01|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The damage peaked during the [[Cultural Revolution]]. In 1966, the Hall of Worshipping Ancestors was modified and some artifacts destroyed for an exhibition of revolutionary mud sculptures. However, further destruction was prevented when Premier [[Zhou Enlai]] intervened by sending an army battalion to guard the city. These troops also prevented ransacking by the [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] who were swept up in the storm to demolish the "[[Four Olds]]". From 1966 to 1971, all gates to the Forbidden City were sealed, saving it from more destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Yinming|last= Xie|author2=Qu, Wanlin|title= "文化大革命"中谁保护了故宫 (Who protected the Forbidden City in the Cultural Revolution?)|url= http://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/68742/69115/69120/5005812.html|work= CPC Documents|publisher= People Net|date=2006-11-07|accessdate=2007-07-25|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Forbidden City was declared a [[World Heritage Site]] in 1987 by [[UNESCO]] as the "Imperial Palace of the Ming and Qing Dynasties",&lt;ref&gt;The Forbidden City was listed as the "[http://whc.unesco.org/archive/advisory_body_evaluation/439.pdf Imperial Palace of the Ming and Qing Dynasties]" (UNESCO World Heritage Official Document). In 2004, [[Mukden Palace]] in [[Shenyang]] was added as an extension item to the property, which then became known as "Imperial Palaces of the Ming and Qing Dynasties in Beijing and Shenyang": {{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/439|title=UNESCO World Heritage List: Imperial Palaces of the Ming and Qing Dynasties in Beijing and Shenyang|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=2007-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to its significant place in the development of [[Chinese architecture]] and culture.

==Present==
[[File:Beijing-forbidden9.jpg|thumb|Tourists inside the Palace Museum]]
Currently, the Palace Museum is responsible for the preservation and restoration of the Forbidden City. Building heights around the Forbidden City are restricted. In 2005, a sixteen-year restoration project was started to repair and restore all buildings in the Forbidden City to their pre-1912 state. This is the largest restoration of the Forbidden City undertaken in two centuries, and involves progressively closing off sections of the Forbidden City for assessment, repairs, and restoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gjdx.dpm.org.cn/ |title=Forbidden City restoration project website |accessdate=2007-05-03 |author=Palace Museum |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070421023644/http://gjdx.dpm.org.cn/ |archivedate=April 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also as part of the project, some derelict or destroyed sections are being rebuilt. The gardens of the Palace of Establishing Prosperity, destroyed by fire in 1923, were rebuilt in 2005, but remain closed to the public.&lt;ref name="Jianfu2"/&gt; The interior was also designed in a different style, and the buildings are used by visiting [[Very Important Person|dignitaries]].&lt;ref name="Jianfu1"/&gt;

While effort has been made to prevent the commercialisation of the palace, a variety of commercial enterprises exist, such as souvenir shops and photography stands. These commercial enterprises often rouse controversy. A [[Starbucks]] store, which opened in 2000, sparked objections&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Reuters |title=Starbucks brews storm in China's Forbidden City |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/FOOD/news/12/11/china.starbucks.reut/ |publisher=CNN |date=2000-12-11 |accessdate=2007-05-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070502100933/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/FOOD/news/12/11/china.starbucks.reut/ |archivedate=2007-05-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually closed on July 13, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Mellissa Allison| title=Starbucks closes Forbidden City store| url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2003788095_webstarbucks13.html| publisher=The Seattle Times| date=2007-07-13|accessdate=2007-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese media also took notice of a pair of souvenir shops that refused to admit Chinese citizens in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Two stores inside Forbidden City refuse entry to Chinese nationals|url= http://news.xinhuanet.com/society/2006-08/23/content_4995055.htm|publisher= Xinhua Net|date= 2006-08-23|accessdate= 2007-05-01|language= Chinese|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090113150824/http://news.xinhuanet.com/society/2006-08/23/content_4995055.htm|archivedate= 2009-01-13|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the reports, the purpose was to preserve an atmosphere where foreigners could be victims of [[price gouging]]. The Palace Museum promised to investigate the matter. Some commentators, such as influential [[Phoenix TV]] host Luqiu Luwei, have further questioned the whole practice of renting out premises in the Forbidden City as retail space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= 闾丘露薇：星巴克怎么进的故宫？Luqiu Luwei: How did Starbucks get into the Forbidden City|url= http://culture.people.com.cn/GB/27296/5290184.html|publisher= People Net|date=2007-01-16|accessdate=2007-07-25|language=Chinese}}; see also the original [[blog]] post [http://blog.sina.com.cn/u/46e9d5da01000694 here] (in Chinese).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jiang Tingxi''' ({{zh|t=蔣廷錫|s=蒋廷锡|p=Jiǎng Tíngxí|w=Chiang T'ing-hsi}}, 1669–1732&lt;ref name="Barnhart"&gt;Barnhart: Page 379.&lt;/ref&gt;), [[courtesy name]] '''Yangsun''' (杨孙), was a [[Chinese painter]], and an editor of the [[encyclopedia]] ''[[Gujin Tushu Jicheng]]'' (''Complete Collection of Ancient and Modern Writings and Charts'').

Jiang was born in [[Changshu]], [[Jiangsu]]. Besides the name Yangsun, he was also known by his courtesy name Youjun (酉君), as well as the pseudonyms Nansha (南沙), Qingtong Jushi, Qiujun, and XiGu (西谷).

The 5020-volume state-sponsored encyclopedia ''Gǔjīn Túshū Jíchéng'' ({{zh|t=古今圖書集成|s=古今图书集成|l=Complete Collection of Illustrations and Writings from the Earliest to Current Times|labels=no}}) was published in 1726 and had been compiled by [[Chen Menglei]] and Jiang Tingxi during the reigns of the [[Kangxi Emperor|Kangxi]] and [[Yongzheng Emperor|Yongzheng]] emperors in the [[Qing dynasty]].

As an official painter and grand secretary to the imperial court, Jiang used a wide variety of artistic styles, and focused particularly on paintings of birds and flowers. He was also proficient in [[calligraphy]].

Although better known for his ''Gujin Tushu Jicheng'', Jiang also contributed—along with other scholars—in the compilation of the "Daqing Yitongzhi" ('Gazetteer of the Qing Empire').&lt;ref name="fairbank teng 211"&gt;Fairbank &amp; Teng, 211.&lt;/ref&gt; This geographical [[gazetteer]] was provided with a preface in 1744 (more than a decade after Jiang's death), revised in 1764, and reprinted in 1849.&lt;ref name="fairbank teng 211"/&gt;

Apart of cultural activity, as a holder of the ''jinshi'' degree Tinxi performed the important duties in the Qing government's Office of Military Finance, on par with Zhang Tingyu (headed by [[Yinxiang (prince)|Yinxiang]], the Yongzheng Emperor's brother).&lt;ref&gt;Spence, The Search for Modern China, p.80-81&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Minnesota History Center''' is a museum and library that serves as the headquarters of the [[Minnesota Historical Society]]. It is near downtown [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]], and is considered one of Minnesota's finest public buildings.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The History Center is on Kellogg Boulevard, between the [[Mississippi River]] and the [[Minnesota State Capitol]].&lt;ref&gt;"Minnesota History Center", p.2.&lt;/ref&gt; Before this building was built in 1992, the Minnesota Historical Society (MNHS) occupied what is now the [[Minnesota Judicial Center]], originally built for the Society in 1917. Before that, MNHS was housed in the basement of the [[Minnesota State Capitol|State Capitol]].&lt;ref name="minnesotahistorycenter.org"&gt;http://www.minnesotahistorycenter.org/about/about-the-history-center.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center hosts concerts, dance performances, lectures, conferences, meetings, dinners, political campaign events, memorial services, receptions, parties, and weddings; as many as 75,000 schoolchildren visit the History Center every year.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

== Architecture ==

The Minneapolis architectural firm of Hammel Green and Abrahamson (HGA) designed the History Center's floor plan and exterior. HGA looked to [[Fort Snelling]], the [[Cathedral of Saint Paul, National Shrine of the Apostle Paul|St. Paul's Cathedral]] and the [[Minnesota State Capitol]] for inspiration. One member of the History Center Planning Committee said, "We have envisioned a place that draws the public in, fires the imagination, and responds to its hunger for an understanding of the past. We have envisioned a building alive with people from morning until far into the evening...a vital cultural and educational center."{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

After ten years of planning and nearly three years of construction, The History Center opened in October 1992. The building features a central dome with two bordering wings, creating an L-shaped design. The north facade faces the Capitol, and the southeast facade overlooks a large lawn and terrace area. Bronze doors admit visitors into the Center's main entrance, on the west wall.

''Charm Bracelet'' lies on the floor of the first-story rotunda. This project, sculpted by James Casebere, depicts a broken piece of jewelry in which each of ten "charms" represents an important aspect of Minnesota: a tractor (agriculture); a printer's ink roller (civic society and free speech); a tepee (the Dakota tribe); a mill building (lumbering and flour-milling); a house (family); a power plant (technology and industry); a turtle, bear and fish (nature, outdoor recreation, and Ojibwe totems of healing, defense and learning); and a whooping crane (lost wilderness and a metaphor for history).

The Minnesota History Center is one of the 26 [[Minnesota Historical Society]] sites and is home to the Minnesota Historical Society headquarters, the Society's collections, an expansive library, and {{convert|44,000|sqft|m2}} of museum gallery space. The museum showcases interactive in-house-developed and traveling exhibits, as well as historical programming and lectures. The Center also contains conference rooms, the 3M Auditorium, Café Minnesota, two museum gift shops and {{convert|12,800|sqft|m2}} of classroom space.&lt;ref name="minnesotahistorycenter.org"/&gt;

More than half of the {{convert|427,000|sqft|m2}} building is underground,&lt;ref&gt;Horrigan, Brian. "Minnesota History Center" Minnesota Historical Society Press, 1996. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; much of which is used for storage. The Minnesota History Center possesses over 1,000,000 artifacts, including archaeological objects, books, photographs, maps, paintings, prints, drawings, manuscripts, government records, newspapers and periodicals. Such artifacts are stored in the {{convert|100,000|sqft|m2}} of storage space available in the Center. In this storage space, the shelves reach heights over 25 feet.&lt;ref&gt;Horrigan, Brian. "Minnesota History Center" Minnesota Historical Society Press, 1996. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The Center also has a conservation laboratory, where conservators repair, stabilize, and maintain the Society's thousands of valuable objects.

== Gale Family Library ==
The Gale Family Library on the second floor of the History Center, offers resources for MNHS members and guests. Two rooms, the Weyerhaeuser Reference Room and the Ronald M. Hubbs Microfilm Reading Room, make up the library area. The library often hosts classes on historical and genealogical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sites.mnhs.org/library/|title=Library {{!}} Library Home|website=sites.mnhs.org|access-date=2016-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

The codex contains the complete text of the four [[Gospel]]s, on 420 purple parchment leaves (24 by 19&amp;nbsp;cm). The text is written in one column per page, 17 lines per page, in gold. It is written in early minuscule, but some parts of the codex in [[Uncial script#Half-uncial|semi-uncial]], and titles in [[Uncial script|uncial]] letters. The codex contains simple miniatures, mainly geometrical figures, without any direct Christian symbols. There are also ornaments on the metal cover.{{r|Gregory}}

In terms of style and age, it is comparable to the [[Minuscule 565|Empress Theodora's Codex]].

The text is divided according to the {{lang|grc|κεφαλαια}} (''chapters''), whose numerals are given at the margin. There is also a division according to the smaller [[Ammonian Sections]], with references to the [[Eusebian Canons]].{{r|Gregory}}
 
It contains tables of the {{lang|grc|κεφαλαια}} (''tables of contents'') before each Gospel.&lt;ref name = Gregory/&gt;

== History ==

The origin of this manuscript has been and remains the subject of debate. It was found in a church of Berat, and became known after publication written by bishop of Berat “Description abrégée et historique de la sainte métropole de Belgrade, aujourd’hui Berat” (Corfu, 1868). It was examined by [[Pierre Batiffol]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Batiffol]], ''Les manuscrits grecs de Berat d'Albanie et le Codex Purpureus'', Paris 1886.&lt;/ref&gt;

Formerly the codex was located in a church in [[Berat]]. Since 1971, it has been housed in the [[National Archives of Albania]] (No. 2) at [[Tirana]].{{r|Aland}}&lt;ref name = INTF&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://intf.uni-muenster.de/vmr/NTVMR/ListeHandschriften.php | title = Liste Handschriften | publisher = Institute for New Testament Textual Research | accessdate = 16 November 2010 | location = Münster}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Codex Beratinus 2'' now is registered with the [[UNESCO]] as a [[World Heritage Site|world treasure]].

[[Monsanto]] has been involved in several high-profile lawsuits, as both plaintiff and defendant. It has been defendant in a number of lawsuits over health and environmental issues related to its products. Monsanto has also made frequent use of the courts to defend its patents, particularly in the area of [[agricultural biotechnology]], as have other companies in the field, such as [[Pioneer Hi-Bred|Dupont Pioneer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/93431968/Pioneer-Hi-Bred-International-v-Does-1-5 |title=Pioneer Hi Bred International v.

==Patent litigation==
Monsanto was one of the first companies to apply the [[History of biotechnology#Biotechnology and industry|biotechnology industry]] business model to agriculture, using techniques developed by [[Genentech]] and other biotech drug companies in the late 1970s in California.&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy Leonard-Barton, Gary P. Pisano. January 29, 1990. Harvard Business Review: Case Studies.

===As plaintiff===
In 1969, Monsanto sued [[Rohm and Haas]] for infringement of Monsanto's patent for the herbicide [[propanil]].   In [[Monsanto Co. v. Rohm and Haas Co.]], the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit|Third Circuit Court of Appeals]] ruled against Monsanto on the basis that the company had fraudulently procured the patent it sought to enforce.&lt;ref&gt;Monsanto Co. v. Rohm and Haas Co., 456 F.2d 592 (3d Cir. 1972)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openjurist.org/456/f2d/592/monsanto-company-v-rohm-and-haas-company|title=456 F. 2d 592 - Monsanto Company v. Rohm &amp; Haas Companypublisher=OpenJurist|accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the mid‑1990s, Monsanto indicates that it has filed suit against 145 individual U.S. farmers for [[patent infringement]] and/or [[breach of contract]] in connection with its genetically engineered seed but has proceeded through trial against only eleven farmers, all of which it won.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monsanto.com/newsviews/Pages/saved-seed-farmer-lawsuits.aspx|author=Monsanto Company|title=Saved Seed and Farmer Lawsuits}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Susan A. Schneider, ''Food, Farming, and Sustainability'', pp. 583-84 (2011) (discussing http://www.monsanto.com/monsanto_today/for_the_record/monsanto_saved_seed_lawsuits.asp).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Center for Food Safety]] has listed 90 lawsuits through 2004 by Monsanto against farmers for claims of seed patent violations.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Monsanto defends its patents and their use, explaining that patents are necessary to ensure that it is paid for its products and for all the investments it puts into developing products. As it argues, the principle behind a farmer’s seed contract is simple: a business must be paid for its product., but that a very small percentage of farmers do not honor this agreement. While many lawsuits involve breach of Monsanto's Technology Agreement, farmers who have not signed this type of contract, but do use the patented seed, can also be found liable for violating Monsanto's patent.&lt;ref name="Bowman SCOTUS"&gt;''Bowman v.

The usual Monsanto claim involves patent infringement by intentionally replanting patented seed. Such activity was found by the [[United States Supreme Court]] to constitute patent infringement in ''[[Bowman v. Monsanto Co.]]'' (2013).&lt;ref name="Bowman SCOTUS"/&gt; The case began in 2007, when Monsanto sued Indiana farmer Vernon Hugh Bowman who in 1999 bought seed for his second planting from a grain elevator – the same elevator to which he and others sold their transgenic crops.&lt;ref name="Bowman CAFC decision"&gt;United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.

The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] had issued a similar decision in ''[[Monsanto Canada Inc. v.

Scc.lexum.org.&lt;/ref&gt; That case concerned [[Percy Schmeiser]], who claimed to have discovered that some [[canola]] growing on his farm in 1997 was Roundup resistant. Schmeiser harvested the seed from the Roundup resistant plants, and planted the seed in 1998. Monsanto sued Schmeiser for patent infringement for the 1998 planting. Schmeiser claimed that because the 1997 plants grew from seed that was pollinated with pollen blown into his field from neighboring fields, he owned the harvest and was entitled to do with it whatever he wished, including saving the seeds from the 1997 harvest and planting them in 1998. The initial Canadian Federal Court rejected Schmeiser's defense and held for Monsanto, finding that in 1998 Schmeiser had intentionally planted the seeds he had harvested from the wind-seeded crops in 1997, and so patent infringement had indeed occurred.&lt;ref name="2001FCT256"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://decisions.fct-cf.gc.ca/en/2001/2001fct256/2001fct256.html |title='&amp;#39;Monsanto Canada v.

Monsanto has also successfully sued grain elevators that clean seeds for farmers to replant of [[Patent infringement under United States law#Indirect infringement|inducing patent infringement]]. For example, Monsanto sued the Pilot Grove Cooperative Elevator in [[Pilot Grove, Missouri]], which had been cleaning conventional seeds for decades before the issuance of the patent that covered genetically engineered seeds.&lt;ref name="url_monsantoharvest"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2008/05/monsanto200805 |title=Monsanto's Harvest of Fear }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a seed cleaner from Indiana, Maurice Parr, was sued by Monsanto for inducing farmers to save seeds in violation of Monsanto’s patent rights. Parr told his customers that cleaning patented seeds for replanting was not infringing activity. The case was settled and in exchange for paying no monetary damages, Parr agreed to an injunction requiring Parr to obtain certification from his clients that their seeds were not Monsanto patented seeds and to advise clients that [[seed saving]] of patented seeds is illegal.&lt;ref&gt;Susan A. Schneider, ''Food, Farming, and Sustainability'', p. 582 (2011) (discussing Monsanto v. Parr, No. 4:07CV0008AS (N.D. Ind.

In one case, a farmer committed misconduct while defending a Monsanto lawsuit, which resulted in criminal penalties.

Monsanto has been criticized for a mistaken lawsuit. In 2002, Monsanto mistakenly sued Gary Rinehart of [[Eagleville, Missouri]] for patent violation. Rinehart was not a farmer or seed dealer, but [[sharecropping|sharecropped]] land with his brother and nephew, who were violating the patent. Monsanto dropped the lawsuit against him when it discovered the mistake. It did not apologize for the mistake or offer to pay Rinehart's attorney fees.&lt;ref name="url_monsantoharvest"/&gt;

In 2009, Monsanto sued [[DuPont Pioneer]] for patent infringement of Roundup Ready patents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-01/monsanto-awarded-1-billion-against-dupont-by-jury.html | work=Bloomberg | first1=Joe | last1=Whittington | first2=Andrew | last2=Harris | first3=Jack | last3=Kaskey | title=Monsanto Awarded Billion Against DuPont by Jury | date=August 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; DuPont had licensed the patents from Monsanto already, but had added additional glyphosate-resistance genes to its seed, which Monsanto claimed was not allowed in the license.

===As defendant===
The [[Public Patent Foundation]] has unsuccessfully attempted to invalidate several Monsanto patents. In 2006, the foundation filed for ''ex parte'' reexamination of four patents, which the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (PTO) granted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091126131100/http://www.pubpat.org/monsantovfarmers.htm Monsanto Anti-Farmers Patents]. [[Public Patent Foundation]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 2008 the PTO had confirmed the validity of all four patents, with minor amendments to two patents,&lt;ref&gt;''Ex Parte'' Reexamination Certificates for U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,196,525 and 5,322,938.&lt;/ref&gt; and allowing new patent claims to issue for the other two patents.&lt;ref&gt;''Ex Parte'' Reexamination Certificates for U.S. Pat.

==Chemical pollution==

Monsanto presently operates as an agricultural company, but it was founded in 1901 as a chemical company.  In 1997 Monsanto split the chemical sector of its business into an independent company, [[Solutia Inc.]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/10/business/monsanto-chooses-a-spinoff-of-its-chemical-operations.html?ref=monsantocompany Monsanto Chooses a Spinoff Of Its Chemical Operations – New York Times].

===Agent Orange===
In 1980, the first US [[Agent Orange]] class-action lawsuit was filed for the injuries military personnel in Vietnam suffered through exposure to [[dioxins]] in the [[defoliant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1347&amp;dat=19800125&amp;id=ZdMSAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0_oDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5065,3012612 |title='&amp;#39;Dying Veteran May Speak From Beyond The Grave In Court: Lakeland Ledger |publisher=News.google.com |date=1980-01-25 |accessdate=2012-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chemical companies involved denied that there was a link between Agent Orange and the veterans' medical problems.

===Dioxin===

In a case that ran from February 1984 through October 1987, Monsanto was the defendant in the longest civil jury trial in U.S. history, ''Kemner v. Monsanto''. The case involved a group of plaintiffs who claimed to have been poisoned by [[dioxin]] in 1979 when a train derailed in [[Sturgeon, Missouri]]. Tank cars on the train carried a chemical used to make wood preservatives and "small quantities of a dioxin called 2, 3, 7, 8, TCDD... formed as a part of the manufacturing process."&lt;ref name="Kellner appeal decision"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leagle.com/xmlResult.aspx?xmldoc=19911722576NE2d1146_11573.xml&amp;docbase=CSLWAR2-1986-2006 |title=KEMNER v. MONSANTO CO. – July 22, 1991 |publisher=Leagle.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial outcome was mixed. "The jurors, after deliberating more than two months, agreed with Monsanto that the plaintiffs had suffered no physical harm from exposure to dioxin. But they accepted the plaintiffs' argument that Monsanto had failed to alter its manufacturing process to eliminate dioxin as a byproduct and that it had failed to warn the public about dioxin's harmfulness. Most of the plaintiffs were awarded only one dollar each for actual losses, but they were awarded $16.2 million in punitive damages."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/24/us/spill-s-legal-odyssey.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm | work=New York Times | first=E.

===Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)===
In the early 1990s, Monsanto faced several lawsuits over harm caused by [[Polychlorinated biphenyls|PCB]]s from workers at companies such as Westinghouse that bought PCBs from Monsanto and used them to build electrical equipment.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Steyer. ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch''. November 25, 1991. "Settlement Doesn't End Monsanto's Woes". Accessed via Factiva September 29, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Monsanto and its customers, such as Westinghouse and GE, also faced litigation from third parties, such as workers at scrap yards that bought used electrical equipment and broke them down to reclaim valuable metals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://caselaw.findlaw.com/ky-supreme-court/1243307.html Decision], Supreme Court of Kentucky.

In 2014, the Los Angeles Superior Court found that Monsanto was not liable for cancers claimed to be from PCBs permeating the food supply of three plaintiffs who had developed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. After a four-week trial, the jury found that Monsanto’s production and sale of PCBs between 1935 and 1977 were not substantial causes of the cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.law360.com/articles/540961/jury-finds-monsanto-pcbs-not-to-blame-for-cancer-cases|title=Jury Finds Monsanto PCBs Not To Blame For Cancer Cases|author=Andrew Scurria|publisher=Law360|date=22 May 2014|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the cities of Spokane, San Diego, and San Jose initiated lawsuits against Monsanto to recover cleanup costs for PCB contaminated sites, alleging that Monsanto continued to sell PCBs without adequate warnings after they knew of their toxicity.

In July 2015, a St Louis county court in Missouri found that Monsanto, Solutia, Pharmacia and Pfizer were not liable for a series of deaths and injuries caused by PCBs manufactured by [[Monsanto Chemical Company]]  until 1977.

=== RoundUp ===
{{Further|Roundup (herbicide)#Legal}}
Over 4,000 cancer patients are suing Monsanto in numerous state courts for failure to warn the public about the risk of cancer associated with glyphosate-based weedkiller RoundUp.

==Other legal actions==

In 2005, the [[United States Department of Justice|US DOJ]] filed a Deferred Prosecution Agreement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.law.virginia.edu/pdf/faculty/garrett/monsanto.pdf |title=United States of America v. Monsanto Company (Foreign Corrupt Practices Act) |publisher=United States District Court for the District of Columbia }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which Monsanto admitted to violations of the [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]] (15 U.S.C. § 78dd-1) and making false entries into its books and records (15 U.S.C § 78m(b)(2) &amp; (5)). Monsanto also agreed to pay a $1.5 million fine. The case involved bribes paid to an Indonesian official.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4153635.stm Business | Monsanto fined $1.5m for bribery]. BBC News (January 7, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Monsanto admitted a senior manager at Monsanto directed an Indonesian consulting firm to give a $50,000 bribe to a high-level official in Indonesia's environment ministry in 2002 related to the agency's assessment on its genetically modified cotton. Monsanto told the company to disguise an invoice for the bribe as "consulting fees". Monsanto also has admitted to paying bribes to a number of other high-ranking Indonesian officials between 1997 and 2002. On March 5, 2008, the deferred prosecution agreement against Monsanto was dismissed with prejudice (unopposed by the Department of Justice) by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, thereby indicating that Monsanto had complied fully with the terms of the agreement.

In 2014, Monsanto reached a settlement with soft wheat farmers over the 2013 discovery of experimental glyphosate-resistant wheat in a field in Oregon which had led to South Korea and Japan temporarily stopping some US wheat importation.

In 2003, Monsanto sued [[Oakhurst Dairy]] over Oakhurst's label on its milk cartons that said "Our farmer's pledge: no artificial hormones," referring to the use of [[bovine somatotropin]] (rBST).&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt; Monsanto argued that the label implied that Oakhurst milk was superior to milk from cows treated with rBST, which harmed Monsanto's business.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.wired.com/medtech/health/news/2003/09/60132?currentPage=all | title=Sour Grapes Over Milk Labeling | date=September 16, 2003 | publisher=Wired Magazine | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wlecaMul?url=http://www.wired.com/medtech/health/news/2003/09/60132?currentPage=all | archivedate=February 25, 2011 | deadurl=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two companies settled out of court, and it was announced that Oakhurst would add the word "used" at the end of its label, and note that the U.S. FDA claims there is no major difference between milk from rBST-treated and non rBST-treated cows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2008/08/11/10927 "Maine Dairy 'Somewhat Vindicated' As Monsanto Leaves Bovine Hormone Business"].

As a result of this ruling, growers were permitted to harvest and process their crop at the end of the 2010 growing season, yet a ban on new plantings was enacted.

===SEC Investigation===
In February 2016, Monsanto agreed to pay a $80 million settlement after a [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] investigation found that Monsanto had misstated its earnings in filings over a 3-year period.

==Not a party, but involved==

===1997 WTVT news story===
This is a case where Monsanto was not a party, but was alleged to have been involved in the events under dispute. In 1997, the news division of [[WTVT]] (Channel 13), a [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]–[[Fox Television Stations Group|owned station]] in [[Tampa, Florida]], planned to air an investigative report by [[Steve Wilson (reporter)|Steve Wilson]] and [[Jane Akre]] on the health risks allegedly associated with Monsanto's [[Bovine somatotropin|bovine growth hormone]] product, [[Posilac]].&lt;ref name="sptimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.com/News/081900/TampaBay/Reporter_wins_suit_ov.shtml |title=Reporter wins suit over firing |publisher=Sptimes.com |date=August 19, 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Just before the story was to air, Fox received a threatening letter from Monsanto, saying the reporters were biased and that the story would damage the company.&lt;ref name="sptimes.com" /&gt; Fox tried to work with the reporters to address Monsanto's concerns, and the negotiations between Fox and the reporters broke down.&lt;ref name="sptimes.com" /&gt; Both reporters were eventually fired. Wilson and Akre alleged the firing was for retaliation, while WTVT contended they were fired for insubordination. The reporters then sued Fox/WTVT in Florida state court under the state's [[whistleblower]] statute. In 2000, a Florida jury found that while there was no evidence Fox/WTVT had bowed to any pressure from Monsanto to alter the story, Akre, but not Wilson, was a whistleblower and was unjustly fired.&lt;ref name="sptimes.com" /&gt; Fox appealed the decision stating that under Florida law, a whistleblower can only act if "a law, rule, or regulation”" has been broken and argued that the FCC's news distortion policy did not fit that definition.&lt;ref name="decision"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/fl-district-court-of-appeal/1310807.html |title=NEW WORLD COMMUNICATIONS OF TAMPA INC WTVT TV v.

Recognizing an uncodified agency policy developed through the adjudicative process as the equivalent of a formally adopted rule is not consistent with this policy, and it would expand the scope of conduct that could subject an employer to liability beyond what Florida's Legislature could have contemplated when it enacted the whistle-blower's statute."

===Industrial Bio-Test Laboratories scandal===
In 1981, four executives of [[Industrial Bio-Test Laboratories]](IBT), an American [[contract research organization]] were indicted in federal court on various counts including [[scientific misconduct]] and fraud, and were convicted in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.6857237 | last1 = Marshall | first1 = E. | title = The murky world of toxicity testing | journal = Science | volume = 220 | issue = 4602 | pages = 1130–1132 | year = 1983 |url=http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/lnn13c00/pdf| pmid = 6857237}}&lt;/ref&gt; IBT was an industrial product safety testing laboratory that was used by pharmaceutical companies, chemical manufacturers and other industrial clients, operated one of the largest facility of its kind in the US, and performed more than one-third of all [[toxicology testing]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=SchneiderAmicus&gt;Schneider, Keith, [http://planetwaves.net/contents/ibt_guity.html "IBT – Guilty" Winter 1983].

In 1991, Philip Smith, a former assistant toxicologist at IBT, testified in a trial in which Monsanto was being sued by workers at Westinghouse over PCBs, that final toxicology reports on PCBs provided to Monsanto by IBT contained falsified data.&lt;ref name='Steyer 1991-10-29'&gt;{{cite news | first = Robert | last = Steyer | title = Lab Falsified Monsanto PCB Data, Witness Says | date = October 29, 1991 | work = St. Louis Post-Dispatch }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==False advertising==
In 1996, the ''New York Times'' reported that: "Dennis C. Vacco, the Attorney General of New York, ordered the company to pull ads that said Roundup was "safer than table salt" and "practically nontoxic" to mammals, birds and fish. The company withdrew the spots, but also said that the phrase in question was permissible under E.P.A. guidelines."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/29/business/monsanto-recruits-horticulturist-san-diego-zoo-pitch-its-popular-herbicide.html?ref=monsantocompany Monsanto recruits the horticulturist of the San Diego Zoo to pitch its popular herbicide. – New York Times].

In 1999, Monsanto was condemned by the UK [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] (ASA) for making "confusing, misleading, unproven and wrong" claims about its products over the course of a £1 million advertising campaign. The ASA ruled that Monsanto had presented its opinions "as accepted fact" and had published "wrong" and "unproven" scientific claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Monsanto ads condemned | url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/1999/mar/01/gm.food?INTCMP=SRCH | first = Sarah | last = Hall | work =The Guardian|date=March 1, 1999 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monsanto responded with an apology and claimed it was not intending to deceive and instead "did not take sufficiently into account the difference in culture between the UK and the USA in the way some of this information was presented."&lt;ref&gt;BBC.

In 2001, French environmental and consumer rights campaigners brought a case against Monsanto for misleading the public about the [[Environmental impact assessment|environmental impact]] of its [[herbicide]] [[Roundup (herbicide)|Roundup]], on the basis that [[glyphosate]], Roundup's main ingredient, is classed as "dangerous for the environment" and "toxic for aquatic organisms" by the [[European Union]]. Monsanto's advertising for Roundup had presented it as biodegradable and as leaving the soil clean after use. In 2007, Monsanto was convicted of false advertising and was fined 15,000 euros. Monsanto's French distributor Scotts France was also fined 15,000 euros. Both defendants were ordered to pay damages of 5,000 euros to the Brittany Water and Rivers Association and 3,000 euros to the CLCV (Consommation Logement Cadre de vie), one of the two main general consumer associations in France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.terradaily.com/2006/070126154451.ovopjxml.html "Monsanto fined in France for 'false' herbicide ads"].

In August 2012, a Brazilian Regional Federal Court ordered Monsanto to pay a $250,000 fine for [[false advertising]]. In 2004, advertising that related to the use of GM soya seed, and the herbicide glyphosate used in its cultivation, claimed it was beneficial to the conservation of the environment. The federal prosecutor maintained that Monsanto misrepresented the amount of herbicide required and stated that "there is no scientific certainty that soybeans marketed by Monsanto use less herbicide." The presiding judge condemned Monsanto and called the advertisement "abusive and misleading propaganda." The prosecutor held that the goal of the advertising was to prepare the market for the purchase of genetically modified soybean seed (sale of which was then banned) and the herbicide used on it, at a time when the approval of a Brazilian Biosafety Law, enacted in 2005, was being discussed in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Brazil fines Monsanto $250,000 for misleading ad – FRANCE 24 | url =http://www.france24.com/en/20120822-brazil-fines-monsanto-250000-misleading-ad|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907021146/http://www.france24.com/en/20120822-brazil-fines-monsanto-250000-misleading-ad|archivedate=September 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''The Navy Records Society''' was established in 1893 as a scholarly [[text publication society]] to publish historical documents relating to the history of the [[Royal Navy]]. Professor Sir [[John Knox Laughton]] and [[Admiral Cyprian Bridge|Admiral Sir Cyprian Bridge]] were the key leaders who organized the society, basing it on the model of earlier organisations such as the [[Hakluyt Society]] and the [[Camden Society]]. The American naval historian, Rear Admiral [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]], was one of the first overseas members to join the Navy Records Society. 
[[File:NRS Logo.jpg|thumb]]

The society has published volumes of original documents and papers almost every year since its foundation. The volumes cover all the major figures in British naval history, such as Nelson, Beatty and Cunningham, and a wide range of topics, from signals and shipbuilding to strategy and politics. In 2006 the NRS published its 150th volume.

== Online Magazine ==

The society has recently augmented its traditional book publishing activities with the launch of its Online Magazine, an ever-expanding online archive of miscellaneous British naval records. The online collection includes records in archives and museums as well as those in private collections which would otherwise never be seen.  New postings to the archive are made at least once per month throughout the year. Every posting receives a detailed introduction explaining how or why the record is important and is posted alongside relevant links in the collection of the Royal Museums Greenwich and, where appropriate, relevant videos. Members can share their knowledge and comment on every posting.

==Leading Figures==
* '''Admiral Sir Cyprian Bridge (1839–1924)'''

Sir Cyprian Bridge co-founded the Navy Records Society (NRS) with Sir John Knox Laughton. He was born in Newfoundland, the son of the chaplain to its governor, Admiral Sir Thomas John Cochrane.

Bridge entered the Royal Navy in 1853. He saw service in many parts of the globe, notably the Antipodes. In 1889 he became director of the Admiralty's newly instituted naval intelligence department. Reaching flag-rank in 1892, he chaired, the following June, the preliminary meeting which resulted in the foundation of the NRS.

Leaving his Admiralty post in 1894, he was later that year appointed naval C-in-C of the Australian squadron, serving as such until 1898. In that year he was promoted vice-admiral, and in 1899 he was knighted (KCB).

In 1901 he went to China as C-in-C of the squadron, playing a seminal role in the negotiations that led to the Anglo-Japanese Treaty (1902). He became full admiral and KCB in 1904, the year he relinquished the command and retired from active service.

He served as an assessor on the International Commission of Inquiry into the 1904 Dogger Bank incident, and during the First World War as a member of the Mesopotamia Commission of Inquiry appointed in August 1916.

He held definite views on naval policy, opposing construction of HMS Dreadnought as contrary to British interests, and publishing widely on naval topics. His books included a memoir, Some Recollections (1918).

More information about Sir Cyprian's life and career, and a list of further reading, can be found in Sir Geoffrey Callender's entry on him (revised by James Goldrick) in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (ODNB).

* '''Sir John Knox Laughton (1830–1913)'''

Sir John Knox Laughton, the principal founder of the Navy Records Society, was born in Liverpool, son of a former master mariner. He graduated as a wrangler in mathematics from Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, and entered the Royal Navy as an instructor.

In 1853 he joined the Baltic-bound Royal George, and following the Crimean War was transferred to the Calcutta, which participated in the Second Opium War. His sea-going career ended in 1866, when he commenced teaching at the Royal Naval College, Portsmouth. He authored acclaimed pioneering texts on meteorology and nautical surveying, and in 1873 became head of the department of meteorology at the new Royal Naval College, Greenwich.

Having authored Essay on Naval Tactics (1873) and The Scientific Study of Naval History (1874), Laughton in 1876 added naval history to his teaching responsibilities. A prolific author in the field, he was the progenitor of the study of naval history in its modern form. In 1885 he was appointed professor of modern history at King's College, London.

He founded the NRS with a long-standing friend, Admiral Cyprian Bridge (1839–1924), director of naval intelligence at the Admiralty. Many distinguished people supported the venture, including the renowned American naval strategist and commentator Alfred Thayer Mahan, whose writings helped to kindle popular interest in naval topics, and the famed historian Samuel Rawson Gardiner.

As the society's secretary from 1893–1912, Laughton played a pivotal role: directing the NRS, arranging publications, recruiting members, and securing respected scholars to edit its volumes. During the years leading up to the First World War, when Germany was striving to develop an ocean-going force to challenge Britain's mastery of the seas, the NRS (with a membership of around 500 that included opinion-formers from the armed services, academia, politics, and the press) deliberately concentrated on the publication of historical sources which reflected contemporary issues in order to influence policy makers.

Laughton edited the first two volumes in the NRS series of publications, State Papers Relating to the Defeatof the Spanish Armada (1894) as well as Vols. 32, 38, and 39 (Letters and Papers of Charles, Lord Barham, 1758–1813). He co-edited vols. 6 (Journal of Rear Admiral Bartholomew James, 1725–1728) and 31 (The Recollections of Commander James Anthony Gardner, 1775–1814).

As the author of over 900 entries in the Dictionary of National Biography, including virtually all the naval memoirs, he left an enduring legacy and stamped his imprimatur on the interpretation of Britain's past naval personalities for generations to come.

He was knighted in 1907, and in 1910 received the Chesney gold medal of the Royal United Service Institution as well as a testimonial (marking his 80th birthday) from the future George V and many celebrated admirals. As he had wished, when the time came his ashes were committed to the deep at the mouth of the Thames. One of his daughters, Dame Elvira [Vera] Laughton Mathews (1888–1959), was director of the Women's Royal Naval Service, 1939–47.

Further information may be obtained from the following works by former NRS secretary Professor Andrew Lambert: The Foundations of Naval History: John Knox Laughton, the Royal Navy, and the historical profession (1998), Letters and Papers of Professor Sir John Knox Laughton (2002; Vol. 143 in the NRS publications series), and the biographical entry on Laughton in The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (ODNB).

* '''Sir Julian Corbett (1854–1922)'''

A former barrister who became a distinguished writer on aspects of British naval history, and from 1902 a lecturer at the new Royal Naval War College at Greenwich, Sir Julian Corbett was one of the NRS's foremost early members, and edited several of the society's publications.

The son of a London architect, he attended Marlborough College and graduated with a first-class degree in law from Trinity College, Cambridge. He abandoned the Bar after a few years to travel and write both fiction and non-fiction. His biography of Sir Francis Drake (about whom he wrote two novels) appeared in the ''English Men of Action'' series during 1890.

His well-received ''Drake and the Tudor Navy'', based on extensive archival sources and informed by his appreciation of the nexus between state policy and the deployment of naval power, appeared in 1898. That same year he edited, at Laughton's urging, ''Papers Relating to the Spanish War'', 1585–87, volume 11 in the NRS series of publications.

A few years later he edited Sir William Slyngsbie's ''Relation of the Voyage to Cadiz 1596'', which appeared in ''The Naval Miscellany I'' edited by Laughton (Volume 20 in the NRS series). Other volumes edited by Corbett were ''Fighting Instructions, 1530–1816'' (series vol. 29), ''Views of the Battles of the Third Dutch War, Signals and Instructions'', 1776–1794 (series vol. 34), and the first two volumes of ''The Private Papers of George, 2nd Earl Spencer'' (series vols. 46 and 48).

In 1914, following publication of the second Spencer volume, he was awarded the Chesney gold medal by the Royal United Service Institution. Books he authored included ''The Successors of Drake'' (1900), ''England in the Mediterranean'', 1603–1714 (1904), ''England in the Seven Years' War'' (1907), ''The Campaign of Trafalgar'' (1910; reprinted 2005), and ''Maritime Operations in the Russo-Japanese War'', 1904–06 (2 vols., 1915). He also wrote influential pamphlets.

Admiral Sir John Fisher, as First Sea Lord (1904–10), solicited Corbett's endorsement of a number of innovations, including the dreadnought and the battle cruiser. Corbett advised on naval policy during the First World War, was knighted in 1917, and became the historian of the war's maritime conduct in his ''Naval Operations'' (3 vols., 1920–23), a controversial and difficult task.

More information about Sir Julian's life and career, and a list of further reading, can be found in Sir Geoffrey Callender's entry on Corbett (revised by James Goldrick) in the ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (ODNB).

* '''Admiral Sir Herbert Richmond (1871–1946)'''

Herbert Richmond was perhaps the most brilliant naval officer of his generation. In 1913 he edited the society's vol. 42, ''Papers relating to the Loss of Minorca''. He was a close friend of Sir Julian Corbett, and took over Corbett's task of editing ''The Private papers of George, 2nd Earl Spencer'', contributing vols 3 and 4 in 1924 (vols 58 and 59).

Richmond entered the navy in 1885 and rose swiftly, though his well known tendency to offer critical advice to his senior officers, as well as publishing critical articles, limited his naval career. He was a moving spirit in the founding of the ''Naval Review'' in 1912. Eventually in 1920 he was made Rear-Admiral, between 1923 and 1925 he was Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Station, after which he became the first Commandant of the new Imperial Defence College. In 1929 he was promoted to Admiral at which point he retired.

In addition to the society's volumes, Richmond had also written two fine studies: ''The Navy in the War of 1739–48'' (1920) and after his retirement, ''The Navy in India'' (1931). In 1934 he appointed to the Vere Harmsworth Chair of Imperial and Naval History at Cambridge, and two years later was elected as Master of Downing College, Cambridge.

See A.J. Marder, ''Portrait of an Admiral: the Life and Papers of Sir Herbert Richmond'' (1952); Barry Hunt, ''Sailor-Scholar: Admiral Sir Herbert Richmond 1871–1946'' (1982).

* '''Professor Michael Lewis (1890–1970)'''

Michael Lewis was a councillor and a vice-president of the NRS. He edited, with insight and humour, Sir William Henry Dillon's enjoyable and lengthy A Narrative of My Personal Adventures (1790–1839) that comprise Volumes 93 and 97 (1953–56) of the society's publications.

Like Sir John Knox Laughton, Sir Julian Corbett, and Sir Geoffrey Callender, Lewis was a member of ‘the Greenwich School’ of naval historians – to employ C. Northcote Parkinson's phrase. This ‘Greenwich School’ – members of the Admiralty's own teaching staff – dominated the writing and interpretation of naval history at a time when academic historians at the universities concerned themselves rather more with "turnips, spinning-jennies and constitutional progress" than with considerations of Britain's maritime past (see English Historical Review, Vol. 64, 1949, pp.&amp;nbsp;374–375).

Educated at Uppingham and at Trinity College, Cambridge, Lewis was in 1913 appointed an assistant master at the old Royal Naval College at Osborne, and served throughout the First World War in the Royal Marine Artillery. In 1922 he became assistant head of the history and English department at the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, and in 1934 the Admiralty appointed him professor of history and English at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, in succession to Sir Geoffrey Callender. He held that post until his retirement in 1955.

Initially a writer of fiction and light verse who contributed to Punch, Lewis from 1939 was a prolific and in many ways groundbreaking writer on naval history. His works, often highly original investigations of facets of the navy's story, include ''England’s Sea Officers'' (1939), ''British Ships and British Seamen'' (1942), ''The Navy of Britain'' (1948), ''The History of the British Navy'' (1959), ''A Social History of the Navy'', 1793–1815 (1960), ''The Spanish Armada'' (1960), ''Armada Guns'' (1961), ''Napoleon and his British Captives'' (1962), and ''The Navy in Transition'', 1814–64 (1965).

Professor Michael Arthur Lewis was a fellow of the Society of Arts (FSA), a fellow of the Royal Historical Society (FRHistS), and a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). An obituary, with photograph, appeared in ''The Times'' (2 March 1970, p.&amp;nbsp;12).

* '''Professor Christopher Lloyd (1906–1986)'''

Christopher Lloyd took a notable part in the organisation of the society, becoming administrative Secretary in 1949, then adding publications to his responsibilities in 1950. Between 1952 and 1962 he was full Secretary from 1952 to 1962. His first edited volume of five for the society was the second volume of the Keith papers (vol. 90), when he took over a project started in 1926 by W.G.Perrin, the Admiralty Librarian. Lloyd completed the third volume (vol. 96) in 1955. He also edited the fourth ''Miscellany'' volume in 1952, the ''Memoir of James Trevenen, 1760–1790'' (vol. 100, 1959) and ''The Health of Seamen'' in 1965 (vol. 107).

Christopher Lloyd was educated at Oxford, taught in Canada and then at the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, until 1945. He was then appointed a lecturer at the RNC Greenwich, where he taught until his retirement in 1966. In 1962 he was appointed professor of history. He was editor of the journal of the Society for Nautical Research in 1971.

His best-known books were ''The Navy and the Slave Trade'' (1949) and a general history, ''The British Seaman'' (1968). He also completed, with Jack Coulter, the third volume of ''Medicine and the Navy, 1200–1900'' (1961). This last volume was a successor to the first two volumes produced by Surgeon Commander John Keevil.

* '''Professor Nicholas Rodger (1949- )'''

Nicholas Rodger was honorary secretary of the society between 1976 and 1990 during which time he was an Assistant Keeper in the Public Record Office, where he started in 1974. In 1992 he was made Anderson fellow of the National Maritime Museum, created for him so that he could start the three-volume ''The Naval History of Britain''. In 1999 he became a senior lecturer in history at the University of Exeter, and in 2000 was given a personal chair as professor of naval history. In October 2008 he became a senior research fellow at All Souls College, Oxford.

Dr. Rodger edited a Naval Miscellany volume (vol. 125) and was one of the team of editors who assembled the documents for the Centenary volume, ''British Naval Documents, 1204–1960'' (vol. 131). He wrote ''The Admiralty'' (1979), followed by ''The Wooden World: an anatomy of the Georgian Navy'' (1986). In 1993 his third book was published: ''The Insatiable Earl: a life of the Fourth Earl of Sandwich 1718–1792''. The first volume of ''A Naval History of Britain'' appeared in 1997 ''The Safeguard of the Sea'': vol. 1 660–1649. The second volume, ''The Command of the Ocean'' 1649–1815, was published in 2004. Professor Rodger is now working on the third volume.

Professor Rodger has a D.Phil. from Oxford and is a fellow of the Royal Historical Society and of the Society of Antiquaries. In 2005 he was elected a fellow of the British Academy.

* '''Professor Andrew Lambert (1956- )'''

Andrew Lambert was honorary secretary of the society from 1996 until 2005 and has been a member of council for many years. He has edited one of the society's volumes (vol.143) ''Letters and Papers of Professor Sir John Knox Laughton, 1830–1915'' (2002).

He has taught in the Department of War Studies at King's College, London since 1991, having previously taught at the RMA, Sandhurst. Professor Lambert was given a chair in naval history at Kings in 1999 and since 2001 he has been Laughton Professor of Naval History. He is a fellow of the Royal Historical Society.

Professor Lambert has published prolifically on the nineteenth century. His books include ''Battleships in Transition: the creation of the Steam Battlefleet 1815–1960'' (1984); ''The Crimean War: British Grand Strategy: British Grand Strategy against Russia, 1853–1856'' (1990); ''The Last Sailing Battlefleet: Maintaining Naval Master 1815–1850'' (1991); ''The Foundations of Naval History: John Knox Laughton, the Royal Navy and the Historical Profession'' (1998); ''War at Sea in the Age of Sail'' (2000), Nelson: ''Britannia’s God of War'' (2004) and ''Admirals'' (2008). ''Franklin at the Gates of Hell: A Polar Tragedy'' is to appear in 2009. He also presented the television series ''War at Sea'' (BBC 2, 2004).

'''Palm-leaf manuscripts''' are [[manuscript]]s made out of dried palm leaves. Palm leaves were used as [[writing material]]s in the [[Indian subcontinent]] and in [[Southeast Asia]] dating back to the 5th century BCE,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cedar.buffalo.edu/~zshi/Papers/kbcs04_261.pdf |title=Digital Enhancement of Palm Leaf Manuscript Images using Normalization Techniques

One of the oldest surviving palm leaf manuscript is a Sanskrit [[Shaivism]] text from the 9th-century, discovered in [[Nepal]], now preserved at the Cambridge University Library.&lt;ref name=cupparameshplm&gt;[http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-01049-00001/9 Pārameśvaratantra (MS Add.1049.1) with images] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308183704/http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-01049-00001/9 |date=2016-03-08 }}, Puṣkarapārameśvaratantra, University of Cambridge (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Palm leaf manuscripts were written in [[ink]] on rectangular cut and cured palm leaf sheet. Each sheet typically had a hole through which a string could pass through, and with these the sheets were tied together with a string to bind like a book. A palm leaf text thus created would typically last between a few decades and about 600 years before it decayed due to dampness, insect activity, mold and fragility. Thus the document had to be copied onto new sets of dried palm leaves.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"/&gt;  The oldest surviving palm leaf Indian manuscripts have been found in colder, drier climates such as in parts of [[Nepal]], [[Tibet]] and [[central Asia]], the source of 1st-millennium CE manuscripts.&lt;ref name="aghosheia" /&gt;

The individual sheets of palm leaves were called ''Patra'' or ''Parna'' in Sanskrit (Pali/Prakrit: ''Panna''), and the medium when ready to write was called ''Tada-patra'' (or ''Tala-patra'', ''Tali'', ''Tadi'').&lt;ref name=aghosheia&gt;Amalananda Ghosh (1991), An Encyclopaedia of Indian Archaeology, BRILL Academic, {{ISBN|978-9004092648}}, pages 360-361&lt;/ref&gt; The famous 5th-century CE Indian manuscript called the [[Bower Manuscript]] discovered in [[Chinese Turkestan]], was written on [[birch-bark]] sheets shaped in the form of treated palm leaves.&lt;ref name=aghosheia/&gt;

With the spread of Indian culture to [[Southeast Asia]]n countries like as [[Indonesia]], [[Cambodia]], [[Thailand]], and the [[Philippines]], these nations also became home to large collections. Palm-leaf manuscripts called ''Lontar'' in dedicated stone libraries have been discovered by archaeologists at Hindu temples in [[Bali]] Indonesia and in 10th century Cambodian temples such as [[Angkor Wat]] and [[Banteay Srei]].&lt;ref&gt;Wayne A. Wiegand and Donald Davis (1994), Encyclopedia of Library History, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0824057879}}, page 350&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the oldest surviving Sanskrit manuscripts on palm leaves is of the ''Parameshvaratantra'', a [[Shaiva Siddhanta]] text of [[Hinduism]]. It is from the 9th-century, and dated to about 828 CE.&lt;ref name=cupparameshplm/&gt; The discovered palm-leaf collection also includes a few parts of another text, the ''Jñānārṇavamahātantra'' and currently held by the University of Cambridge.&lt;ref name=cupparameshplm/&gt;

With the introduction of [[printing press]]es in the early 19th century, the cycle of copying from palm leaves mostly came to an end. Many governments are making efforts to preserve what is left of their palm leaf documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asianart.com/articles/tamsuks/ |title=Conservation and Digitisation of Rolled Palm Leaf Manuscripts in Nepal |publisher=Asianart.com |date=2005-11-14 |accessdate=2013-11-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113113037/http://www.asianart.com/articles/tamsuks/ |archivedate=2013-11-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lac.org.tw/admin/ArticleFolder/2/75%E6%9C%9F/3643-75-15.pdf|title=論述貝葉經整理與編目工作|publisher=}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.laomanuscripts.net |title=Digital Library of Lao Manuscripts |publisher=Laomanuscripts.net |date= |accessdate=2013-11-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114063433/http://www.laomanuscripts.net/ |archivedate=2013-11-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on the design of regional alphabet scripts==

The rounded or diagonal shapes of the letters of many of the scripts of South India and Southeast Asia, such as [[Devanagari]], [[Nandinagari]], [[Telugu script]], [[Lontara alphabet|Lontara]], the [[Javanese script]], the [[Balinese alphabet]], the [[Odia alphabet]], the [[Burmese alphabet]], the [[Tamil script]] and others may have developed as adaptations to writing [[Indic scripts]] on palm leaves, as angular letters (such as [[Brahmi alphabet|Brahmi letters]]) tend to split the leaf.&lt;ref&gt;Sanford Steever, 'Tamil Writing'; Kuipers &amp; McDermott, 'Insular Southeast Asian Scripts', in Daniels &amp; Bright, ''The World's Writing Systems'', 1996, p. 426, 480&lt;/ref&gt;

Palm leaf manuscripts of [[Odisha]] include scriptures, pictures of [[Devadasi]] and various [[mudra]]s of the ''[[Kama Sutra]]''.

In 1997 The United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation ([[UNESCO]]) recognised the Tamil Medical Manuscript Collection as part of the [[Memory of the World Programme#Memory of the World Register|Memory of the World Register]].

=== Javanese and Balinese ===
{{redirect|Lontar manuscript|the manuscripts of the Bugi|Lontara}}
In Indonesia the palm-leaf manuscript is called '''lontar'''. The [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] word is the modern form of [[Old Javanese]] ''rontal''. It is composed of two Old Javanese words, namely ''ron'' "leaf" and ''tal'' "''Borassus flabellifer'', palmyra palm". Due to the shape of the palmyra palm's leaves, which are spread like a fan, these trees are also known as "fan trees". The leaves of the rontal tree have always been used for many purposes, such as for the making of plaited mats, [[palm sugar]] wrappers, water scoops, ornaments, ritual tools, and writing material. Today, the art of writing in ''rontal'' still survives in [[Bali]], performed by Balinese Brahmin as a sacred duty to rewrite [[Hindu texts]].

[[File:Arjunawiwaha canto 5.jpg|thumb|[[Bali]]nese palm-leaf manuscript of ''[[Arjunawiwaha|Kakawin Arjunawiwāha]]''.]]
Many old manuscripts dated from ancient [[Java]], [[Indonesia]], were written on rontal palm-leaf manuscripts. Manuscripts dated from the 14th to 15th century during the [[Majapahit]] period. Some were found even earlier, like the ''[[Arjunawiwaha]]'', the ''[[Smaradahana]]'', the ''[[Nagarakretagama]]'' and the ''[[Kakawin Sutasoma]]'', which were discovered on the neighboring islands of [[Bali]] and [[Lombok]]. This suggested that the tradition of preserving, copying and rewriting palm-leaf manuscripts continued for centuries. Other palm-leaf manuscripts include [[Sundanese language]] works: the ''[[Carita Parahyangan]]'', the ''[[Sanghyang siksakanda ng karesian]]'' and the ''[[Bujangga Manik]]''.

A  [[racialized]] society is a society where perceived race matters profoundly for life experiences, opportunities, and [[interpersonal relationship|interpersonal relationships]].

A racialized society can also be said to be "a society that allocates differential [[economic]], [[political]], [[social]], and even [[psychological]] rewards to groups along perceived racial lines; lines that are [[socially constructed]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Emerson | first1 = Michael O. | last2 = Smith | first2 = Christian | author-link2 = Christian Smith (sociologist) | contribution = Confronting the black-white racial divide | editor-last1 = Emerson | editor-first1 = Michael O. | editor-last2 = Smith | editor-first2 = Christian | editor-link2 = Christian Smith (sociologist) | title = Divided by faith: evangelical religion and the problem of race in America | page = 7 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 2000 | isbn = 9780195147070 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;{{cite web|last=Clark |first=David K. |title=BARRC Sociological Theory |url=http://www.bethel.edu/about-bu/reconciliation/position/sociological.html |publisher=[[Bethel University (Minnesota)|Bethel University]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121403450000/http://www.bethel.edu/about-bu/reconciliation/position/sociological.html |archivedate=January 1, 1970 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is argued that racial/ethnic identity are not separate or autonomous categories and what is called 'racial categories' in the United States are actually [[racialized]] ethnic categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Grosfoguel | first = Ramán | title = Race and ethnicity or racialized ethnicities?

United States society is  considered by some a racialized society in which divisions between the racial/ethnic groups are given. [[Critical race theory]] argues that [[racism]] is normal and is engrained [sic] in the fabric and system of the [[American society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spacrs.wordpress.com/what-is-critical-race-theory/ |title=What is critical race theory? |accessdate=11 March 2012 |publisher= Critical Race Studies, [[UCLA School of Public Affairs]] (via WordPress) }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Ladson-Billings | first = Gloria | title = Just what is critical race theory and what's it doing in a nice field like education? | journal = International Journal of Qualitative Studies in Education | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 7–24 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/095183998236863 | date = January 1998 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/095183998236863 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are ongoing racial disparities between races in the United States in employment, housing, religion, and [[race-conscious]] institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Shepherd | first1 = Gregory J. | last2 = St. John | first2 = Jeffrey | last3 = Striphas | first3 = Ted | title = Communication as ...:perspectives on theory | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | location = Thousand Oaks, California | year = 2006 | isbn = 9781412906586 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars argue a "privileged/non-privileged dynamic" exists.

It is often said that social interaction is infused with a privileged / non-privileged dynamic which is defined by racial identity — is very complex issue. Racialization hurts both the [[Reverse racism|privileged]] and the non-privileged, but hurts the non-privileged most.&lt;ref name=Clark /&gt;

Until the 1960s there was legal racial [[discrimination in the United States]]. The end of legal discrimination produced major improvements, but scarcely was successful in wiping the slate clean of the many legacies of more than three centuries of formalized state supported inequality. Even after the era of official social discrimination and segregation the lingering residual practices kept [[African American]]s in lower-caste status. Racial problems were viewed as the nation's "most important problem" and many observers felt the United States was in a state of racial crisis. Racially related issues, such as welfare, crime, segregation, "permissive judges", affirmative action, group based rights, difference-blind treatment, and government regulation and state neutrality with respect to group, have been the subject of strenuous political debate and legislation in the past three decades. 
Significant gaps between blacks and whites in most domains that measure the quality of life continue to exist. Effective standards designed to eliminate discrimination, often described as [[race-conscious]] remedies, have been intensely debated. Supporters argue that [[institutional racism]] is so deeply and subtly embedded in the fabric of American society that little would change if more proactive methods of eliminating discrimination had been used.&lt;ref name=Sears /&gt;

In [[music]], '''SATB''' is an [[Acronym and initialism|initialism]] for [[soprano]], [[alto]], [[tenor]], [[Bass (voice type)|bass]], defining the [[voice type]]s required by a [[choir|chorus or choir]] to perform a particular musical work. Pieces written for SATB (the most common combination, and used by most [[hymn tune]]s) can be sung by choruses of mixed genders, by choirs of men and boys, or by four soloists. 

{{anchor|other parts}}
There is a lack of general agreement on other initialisms/abbreviations. ''Tr'' for [[Boy soprano|Treble]], ''Mz'' (or similar) for [[Mezzo-soprano]], ''Ba'', ''Bar'' or ''Bari'' for [[Baritone]] are self-explanatory, while ''C'' could be taken for ''canto'', the highest part, or for [[Contralto]], usually implying a female alto(s) as opposed to a [[Countertenor]] (''Ct''). ''SCTB'' is commonly found in [[Romantic music|Romantic]] Italian opera choruses where the Alto singers portray a group of female protagonists on stage.{{fact|date=June 2015}}

''SATB div.'' ([[divisi]], or divided) denotes that one or more individual parts divide into two or more parts at some point in the piece, often sharing the same staff. A single choir with two of each voice type should be written ''SSAATTBB'', unless it is laid out for two identical choirs, in which case it is ''SATB/SATB''. Soloists are written in small type, e.g. ''satb/SATB''. In both these instances a space may be substituted for the slash (/). {{fact|date=June 2015}} &lt;!-- This might be someone's house style, but practice varies more than here suggested --&gt; Publishers usually include such descriptions in their catalogues of choral works, although many fail to provide sufficient detail, commonly omitting, for example, the term ''div.'' where it is required fully to describe the resources required by the composer. Also misleading can be the use of B for a Baritone part or S for an Mz part as for example in [[Charles Villiers Stanford|Stanford]]'s [[motet]] "Eternal Father" which, though marked SSATBB, is for one each of soprano, mezzo-soprano, alto, tenor, baritone and bass.

==Early music==
In [[early music]], particularly that of the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]], the use of the terms soprano, alto, tenor and bass for the voice parts should not be taken in the modern sense of defining which voices are to be used. This is because much 4-voice vocal music of the time possesses the narrower overall range typical of men's voice music with a countertenor on the top (soprano) part. Appropriate downward transposition based on [[chiavette]] should always be considered.

==Instrumental music==
''SATB'' can also refer to ensembles of four instruments from the same family, such as [[saxophone]]s ([[soprano saxophone|soprano]], [[alto saxophone|alto]], [[tenor saxophone|tenor]] and [[baritone saxophone|baritone]]) or [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]]s. Also, the individual contrapuntal [[Part (music)|parts]] of many instrumental compositions, particularly [[fugue]]s, such as those found in [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s "[[The Art of Fugue]]" and "[[The Musical Offering]]", may also be called ''SATB''.

The '''Science Museum at Wroughton''', near [[Swindon]], England, contains the large-object store of the [[Science Museum, London|Science Museum]] and the Science Museum Library &amp; Archives. It is part of the [[National Museum of Science and Industry|Science Museum Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aeroflight.co.uk/museums/science-museum-swindon.htm | title=Science Museum Swindon: Unofficial Museum Guide | publisher=aeroflight.co.uk | accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The Science Museum took ownership of the 545 acre former [[RAF Wroughton]] airfield in 1979, to be used as a storage facility for the largest objects of the Science Museum. A collection of approximately 26,000 objects is currently kept in six of the hangars, from the first hovercraft to [[MRI scanner]]s, and computers to (de-activated) nuclear missiles. The store is particularly notable for its extensive collection of vintage aircraft, road transport vehicles, agricultural machinery and industrial collections.

In 2016 the Science Museum at Wroughton started to be featured in [[The Grand Tour (TV series)|''The Grand Tour'']], a motoring entertainment show.  The show's three ex [[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|'Top Gear']] hosts use some of the roads surrounding the museum buildings as a vehicle test track each week.

==Access==
The object collections at Wroughton are not normally open to the public, however "research" visits to see specific objects in store can be booked by application. In the past there were regular open days when the public could view the collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/733137/Britain-Days-of-discovery.html |title=Britain: Days of discovery |publisher=Telegraph |date=2005-07-09 |accessdate=2016-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science Museum Library and Archives==
The Science Museum Library &amp; Archives collections are part of the Science Museum in London. Its holdings include original scientific, technical and medical works from the last 500 years. The Library is free to use and open to the public but appointments to visit have to be booked in advance. It is open on Fridays 10.00 - 17.00.

=== History of the Library &amp; Archives ===
The Science Museum Library was founded in 1883 as the Science Library of the South Kensington Museum. It was formed of collections from the South Kensington Educational Library and the library of the Museum of Practical Geology. In 1907 it moved to the Royal College of Science building. When the Science Museum gained its independence in 1909, the Science Library became its responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Wyatt, Nicholas | title = Science for the Nation | year = 2010 | publisher=Palgrave-Macmillan | isbn = 978-0-230-23009-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 the Library joined with Imperial College London to form the Imperial College &amp; Science Museum Libraries. Due to the increasing demand for space in South Kensington, about 85% of the collections and all of the archives moved to a specially adapted library building at Wroughton, Swindon in 2007. The London Library closed in February 2014 and all of its collections were moved to the Library in Wroughton &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/about_us/collections/science_library/visit_library_london.aspx |title=About Us : Access and registration |website=Sciencemuseum.org.uk |accessdate=2016-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The collections ===

The printed collections include rare books and first editions, journals from the 16th to the 20th centuries, Trade Literature, exhibition catalogues, British patents from 1617 - 1992 as well as over 85,000 books focussing on the history and social aspects of science, technology and medicine

The named archive collections include hold original archives of some of the most famous and influential individuals and companies in the fields of science, medicine, engineering and industry. These include personal papers, photographs, glass plate negatives, company records, technical drawings and other original manuscripts from famous figures and organisations such as the engineering drawings of [[Charles Babbage]] and [[Barnes Wallis]] as well as papers relating to [[Donald Campbell]] and Hooper's car building firm.

The MS archives are smaller collections of well over two thousand items, ranging in size from single items such as letters and notebooks to small collections comprising a number of items, which provide snapshots of the lives of those who created them. The material provides a wide ranging source of subject information across the science, design and technology disciplines, as well as insights into the day-to-day lives of individuals and families &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/about_us/collections/science_library.aspx |title=Dana Research Centre and Library |website=Sciencemuseum.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sheffield Archives''' (located in [[Sheffield]], [[South Yorkshire]], [[England]]) collects, preserves and lists records (or [[archives]]) relating to Sheffield and South Yorkshire and makes them available for reference and research.

Sheffield Archives is a joint service with [[Sheffield Local Studies Library]]. They are part of the Sheffield Libraries Archives and Information Service delivered by [[Sheffield City Council]]

== History of archive collecting in Sheffield ==

===Up to 1939===

[[Sheffield Central Library|Sheffield’s Central Library]] was officially opened in 1934. In planning it Mr J. P. Lamb, who was then City Librarian, gave considerable thought to the accommodation and expansion of the local history and 'special' collections (as they were then called). A large reading room was provided to accommodate readers and house the local collection of printed material; there were storage facilities for maps and special collections in an adjoining room and two small strongrooms in the basement, providing about 700 feet of shelving for manuscripts.

During the previous twenty-five years the beginnings of a local collection of archives had been brought together, particularly through the assistance of a Sheffield solicitor, T. Walter Hall, himself a competent antiquary and from 1910 to 1926 a co-opted member of the Libraries Committee. Through his good offices the Library in 1912 acquired the Jackson collection, consisting of many original documents and a large amount of genealogical material. This was followed by two fine solicitors' accumulations (Wheat and Tibbitts), subsequently added to, and a number of smaller groups. Finally in 1933, in anticipation of the opening of the new building, the Fairbank collection of several thousand draft maps and plans, accumulated by a local family of surveyors between c. 1740 and 1840, was given to the Library. About the same time the executors of Edward Carpenter, the socialist writer who had lived at Holmesfield near Sheffield, presented the Carpenter collection comprising Carpenter's library, editions of his works, and manuscript material. In 1926 the Library had been recognized by the Master of the Rolls as a repository for manorial records.

The nearest institutions collecting documents and archives at this time were at Leeds (the Yorkshire Archaeological Society and Leeds Public Libraries), Manchester (John Rylands Library) and Derby (Derby Public Library). Though the Yorkshire Archaeological Society aimed at covering the whole of Yorkshire, it was not very active in the southern part of the West Riding and the other three scarcely impinged on the Sheffield region. From the first Sheffield therefore aimed to cover an area roughly within thirty miles radius of the Town Hall, including North Derbyshire and South Yorkshire.

===1939 - 1945===
The outbreak of hostilities in 1939 and the heavy air-raids on Sheffield in December 1940 affected the development of the archive collections in several unfortunate ways. Staff shortages soon meant that only routine attention could be given them, and in December 1941 they were removed for safety to a comparatively rural branch library where premises had been specially strengthened to protect them. More disastrous, the Sheffield Union offices in West Bar, where the Guardians' records still remained, together with the surviving records of the old overseers of the poor, were completely destroyed by enemy action. At the same time business firms were turning out their old records for salvage; the Library does not appear to have taken any steps to save such records from destruction and much was undoubtedly lost at this period.

The war years were not, however, entirely devoid of interest, for 1942 saw the purchase of part of the antiquarian collection of Bacon-Frank of Campsall (Talbot correspondence), the gift of family records from Beauchief Hall and silver-plating records and catalogues of the firm of Thomas Bradbury &amp; Sons.

===1945 - 1960===
After the war the collections were brought back to the Central Library and the reading room, which had been closed for the duration, was re-opened in November 1947. A turning point came about a year later on 31 October 1948 when, with the City Librarian's active support, a meeting of the National Register of Archives was held at the Central Library with the late Lord Scarbrough in the chair; at the meeting it was decided to set up a South Yorkshire committee of the National Register.

Colonel G. E. G. Malet, the Registrar of the National Register, was faced with a particular South Yorkshire problem at this time. The great Fitzwilliam mansion of Wentworth Woodhouse was about to be let to the West Riding as a college. There was an immediate need to find a repository willing to receive the whole of the family archives (except the muniments of title) many of which lay stacked in the corridors there. The City Librarian and the Libraries committee agreed to accept them into custody on loan deposit and on 26 and 27 January 1949 three large furniture vans transported the archives to Sheffield. It is difficult to remember how they were housed until two new strong rooms with 1800 feet of shelving were made ready for use early the following year. During the summer of 1949 a document repairer was appointed and given a period of training at the Public Record Office.

Following the announcement in the press of the deposit of the Fitzwilliam archives, scholars from both sides of the Atlantic began to make their way to the Library, initially to study the Rockingham and Burke papers. Professor T. W. Copeland arrived in May 1949 and five Americans were working on the papers that summer. Two years later Chicago University Press undertook to sponsor a new and full edition of Edmund Burke's correspondence, with Professor Copeland as general editor. For the next 18 years the 'Burke factory' was working in part of the Sheffield Local History and Archives Department on this project.

The ten years following 1949 saw the deposit of several large family and estate archives, including the Duke of Norfolk's Sheffield and Worksop estate records, as well as other types of records. The full-time appointment of an archivist as the National Register of Archives, South Yorkshire committee's representative (working from the Central Library) for about eighteen months during 1953-4 was a great asset at this time. Early in 1956, as part of the City Libraries' centenary celebrations, a Guide to the Manuscript Collections was published.

===1960 - 1974===
By 1960 most large family collections were already in custody and in the following years a wider range of records was received from varied sources. Several smaller family collections came from London solicitors (through the British Records Association or privately). In 1962 came the first official deposit of parish records of the diocese of Sheffield and the same year the first deposit of Methodist chapel and circuit records. In 1964 the Library was recognized by the Bishop as the diocesan repository for parish records.

Documents from Sheffield solicitors' offices have been prominent from the start; in the 1960s several similar accumulations were received from solicitors over a wider field — Barnsley, Wath, Snaith and Sherburn-in-Elmet. Archives deposited by industrial firms increased during this period. In 1960 the Library was recognized as the official local repository for certain categories of public local records and a large deposit of colliery records was handed over by the National Coal Board as a result, making a very substantial modern addition (up to 1948) to older colliery records from private sources.

Further strong room accommodation became essential and a small room, 15 feet x 16 feet, was added in the Central Library in 1963 and a larger manuscript store, built onto one of the branch libraries was ready for use in 1969.

By the 1960s most counties had established record offices, the West Riding being one of the few exceptions. Working through the local committees of the National Register of Archives, the two city libraries of Leeds and Sheffield aimed at making some provision for records other than official county records in the north and south of the Riding, respectively.

===1974 - 1986===
In 1974, with the creation of a new (county) tier of local government for South Yorkshire, the South Yorkshire County Council established a county record office service.  For 12 years, until the abolition of the metropolitan county councils in 1986, the South Yorkshire County Record Office (SYCRO) based at Ellin Street in Sheffield, acquired material relating to the county.  This was in addition to the existing archive services at Sheffield and Doncaster.

===1986 - date===
In 1986, following abolition, the SYCRO collections were transferred to the custody of Sheffield City Council. The ‘county’ service was funded and managed under a joint arrangement between all four local authorities – Barnsley, Doncaster, Sheffield and Rotherham.  Sheffield Archives continued to acquire county archives from 1986. In 1989 the archives moved into a former car showroom premises on [[Shoreham Street]]. The building was converted to house all the documents from the Central Library.

== The collections ==

The records preserved by Sheffield Archives date from the 12th century to the present day and relate to Sheffield and the rest of South Yorkshire and parts of North [[Derbyshire]].

===Local Government records===
Local government records derive mainly from Sheffield City Council and its departments, including Council and Committee minutes, building plans and school records, and from superseded authorities such as Urban and Rural District Councils, Poor Law Unions, civil townships and the former South Yorkshire County Council. Sheffield was created a corporate borough in 1842 and a city in 1897. The old parish, which was coterminous with the new borough until boundary extensions took place in the 20th century, consisted of six townships.

There is a good series of rate books comprising continuous runs of collectors' books from 1755 for Sheffield township and from the 1780s for four of the other townships. From 1891 borough rate-books for the census years only have been retained. Valuations date from the 1820s and 1830s. These records were kept in the vestry halls of the several wards of the city and thus escaped the destruction by enemy action which befell the records stored in the Union offices in West Bar.

Vestry minutes for several townships from the early nineteenth century have also survived, together with some highway surveyors' records. All the records of the old poor law together with the Guardians' records for both the Sheffield and Ecclesall Unions were destroyed in the West Bar offices. Most of the old workhouse records have likewise disappeared. Apart from runs of Guardians' printed minutes, this important side of local life is very sparsely represented among the official records. A good deal of information about the old poor law can however be gleaned from private collections, especially solicitors' collections.

Practically all of the current council departments and directorates are represented in the Archives collections. Worthy of note are council and committee minutes from 1843 onwards; registers of children's homes from 1894; school records from many hundreds of schools, a full series of claims for damage and loss on account of the Sheffield flood of 1864 caused by the bursting of the Damflask reservoir, though to modern papers on the World Student games of 1991 and the recent urban renaissance project - Heart of the City.

Other public bodies whose records may be mentioned are the Doncaster and Mexborough Joint Hospital Board from 1900 - 1948, the Sheffield Gas Company from 1818, and the Coal Board's pre-vesting date records for this area.

===Public Records===
Local public records include Sheffield Quarter Sessions, Magistrate Courts and H.M. Coroners, health authorities and hospitals and records of once nationalised industries such as the National Coal Board for South Yorkshire and the Yorkshire Water Authority.

===Ecclesiastical records===
As the Diocesan Record Office for the Archdeaconry of Sheffield, Sheffield Archives holds records for most of the Anglican parishes within the area, including registers, and records of the Diocese itself. Also held are records of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Hallam and its parishes, and numerous records of other denominations such as Methodists and Quakers etc.

Sheffield also holds a cartulary of Beauchief Abbey, a Premonstratensian house formerly in Derbyshire, the site of which is now within the city of Sheffield. The cartulary was used extensively by Samuel Pegge (Historical account of Beauchief Abbey, 1801) but has never been published. Also emanating from the monastery is a small notebook or miscellany containing biblical texts and a note of an ordination in 1500. Both volumes are in the original bindings.

===Family and estate records===

====The Wentworth Woodhouse Collection====
The Wentworth Woodhouse Collection (Wentworth-Fitzwilliam family) include personal papers of statesmen such as the Earl of Strafford, 2nd Marquis of Rockingham and Edmund Burke.  The Wentworths had been at Woodhouse since the thirteenth century. Little however survives from any period prior to the early seventeenth century, except ancient deeds and some Gascoigne pedigrees which remain at Wentworth Woodhouse. The muniments may be said to begin properly with the period of Thomas Wentworth the great Earl of Strafford whose correspondence was preserved with care by the family. The archives of his son William, the 2nd earl, have not survived. Since his death in 1695 the estates have twice passed in the female line, first to Thomas Watson-Wentworth whose son, another Thomas, was created Marquis of Rockingham in 1746, and secondly in 1782 to the 4th Earl Fitzwilliam. Members of each of these families were deeply involved in the politics of the time. Much of their correspondence has survived, and forms, together with the correspondence of Edmund Burke, a prime source for the political history of the eighteenth century.

The Strafford correspondence comprises eleven letter books into which Wentworth's official correspondence was copied by his secretaries, and about 2,800 original letters, including a considerable number of his own letters to his family, servants and friends. Though by far the largest part of the correspondence dates from the last ten years of Wentworth's life (1631 - 1641), after his appointment as Lord Deputy of Ireland, there is a considerable amount of material even for the years up to 1628, before he held high office. There is naturally much correspondence with the king's ministers, Laud, Cottington, Portland and Secretary Coke, and, at the other end of the scale, many letters full of detail relating to the management of his estates and local affairs. Well-selected letters on national affairs were edited and published in 1739 by William Knowler; more recently Mr J. P. Cooper has published a volume in the Camden series (1973) of Wentworth papers 1597-1628. A vast amount of local interest and many letters from Wentworth's contemporaries remain virtually unknown.

The first Marquis of Rockingham copied selected correspondence into two vast letter books. It relates mainly to the York county elections of 1733 and 1741, the Stuart Rebellion of '45 and letters between him and his son while the latter was in Italy. The son succeeded his father as second Marquis in 1750 and a large amount of his correspondence survives for his two short periods as Prime Minister in 1765 - 1766 and January to July 1782, and for the intermediate period when he held the Whigs together in opposition. Some of these letters were published in 1852 by the Earl of Albemarle, strung together as Memoirs of the Marquis of Rockingham and his contemporaries. Two shortish but valuable studies have appeared since the muniments were deposited here, viz: The early career of Lord Rockingham 1730-1765 by the late Professor G. H. Guttridge, (1952), and Mr P. Langford's The first Rockingham Administration 1765-66, (1973). Rockingham is perhaps regarded as too colourless a figure to merit either a full-scale biography or an edition of his correspondence, though this view scarcely does his personality justice. For American history of the period and for Whig politics this section of the muniments remains of first class importance.

The labours of the Burke editors have now produced nine volumes of Edmund Burke's letters, about half of them from the Sheffield archives. These are virtually all letters from Burke. The bulk of the correspondence here, however, consists of letters addressed to him by a vast number of his contemporaries and relating to topics from America to India; of these the writers' names only are indexed.

The 4th Earl Fitzwilliam's correspondence covering the period 1782-1832, containing over 7,000 letters, has material relating to Ireland, to elections and to many local topics. Of particular interest are the papers concerning working class agitation from 1794 to 1819, ending with the Earl's dismissal from the Lord Lieutenancy of the West Riding at the time of Peterloo. His son, Lord Milton, also played a part in politics until he virtually retired on succeeding to the peerage in 1833. The Yorkshire election archives are extensive.

There is also a vast range of estate material relating to the Irish estates from 1707 and to the West Riding and Malton estates from the 1720s. The stewards' correspondence includes letters from John Carr the architect and there are a number of his original plans for many features in Wentworth House and Park. As with virtually all the great South Yorkshire families, collieries played an important part and are well represented in the Fitzwilliam muniments, up to and including the extensive opencast working on the estate during the last thirty years.

====Duke of Norfolk's Arundel Castle Manuscripts====
Archives of more exclusively estate interest are the Duke of Norfolk's Sheffield, Worksop, and Derbyshire estate archives ([[Arundel Castle]] manuscripts). The [[Duke of Norfolk|Dukes of Norfolk]] and their predecessors the Earls of Shrewsbury were lords of the manor of Sheffield (as the present Duke still is), of Worksop, and of [[Glossop]] and Glossopdale in Derbyshire. The manuscripts include detailed accounts and rentals (including the Shropshire estates) for the late Elizabethan period. The Sheffield archives are extensive, their main interest lying in the urban development of Sheffield in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, including collieries and markets. There is a series of the Sheffield agents' letters and diaries in the nineteenth century. The Worksop records cover in particular the eighteenth century when Worksop was a residence of the dukes. The Glossop records also refer mainly to the nineteenth century when the town became a prosperous manufacturing district and there are records of several turnpike trusts of the Glossop area.

====Wharncliffe Papers====
The [[Earls of Wharncliffe]], [[the Vernon-Wentworths]] and [[the Spencer Stanhopes]] have also deposited their records. Besides estate matters in Scotland, Yorkshire and (a few) Cornwall, they include much correspondence. The small number of letters from Lady Mary Wortley Montagu (about 40 in all) have been published by Professor R. Halsband, in the Complete Letters of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. A much more extensive group of letters forms basically the correspondence of the first Baroness Wharncliffe and her family, including her mother Lady Erne and her grandfather the 4th Earl of Bristol and spanning the years 1773 to 1845. Much is merely personal but much also concerns the political affairs in which Lord Wharncliffe was involved in the period c. 1820 - 1845, as a Tory. This correspondence remains as it was arranged by Lord Stuart of Wortley when he was preparing, with Caroline Grosvenor, the biography of The First Lady Wharndiffe, which was published in 1927. This work makes limited use of the letters. There is also a run of typed transcripts, made for Lord Stuart of Wortley, which includes originals no longer available.

Secondly, there is a long series of letters, 1856 - 1891, to the 1st Earl (3rd Baron) of Wharncliffe. He moved in the highest society of his day and took an interest in politics (Tory), the church and the arts. He was particularly active on behalf of the southern states in the American civil war and the [[Southern Independence Association]] in England. Among his correspondents were Lillie Langtry, Sir Samuel White Baker 'of the Nile', and novelists 'Rolf Boldrewood' and '[[Violet Fane]]'.

====Wilson Family====
A family of very different significance is the Wilson family of Sheffield, one member of which was H. J. Wilson, radical M.P. for the Holmfirth division of Yorkshire from 1885 to 1912. His voluminous political papers, docketed by himself, cover the period from 1870 to 1910. They relate to the political topics in which he was interested, including Ireland, South Africa and the control of the opium trade; and to Sheffield constituency politics over many years, including Lib-Lab relations at the beginning of this century. As the Sheffield Smelting Company the Wilsons ran a business for refining precious metal from metallic waste, the records of which form a separate archive. The correspondence of H. J. Wilson's aunt, Mrs Mary Anne Rawson, takes the family record back to the anti-slavery period, a topic in which she was much interested.

====Edward Carpenter====
The name of [[Edward Carpenter]] (1844-1929) has already been mentioned. Most of his correspondence was received after the publication of the Bibliography of Edward Carpenter by the City Libraries in 1949. It includes series of letters from [[Olive Schreiner]], [[Havelock Ellis|Havelock]] and [[Edith Ellis]], [[Henry Stephens Salt|Henry]] and Kate Salt (among others) as well as some of Carpenter's own letters and many from a host of friends in all parts of the world interested in socialism, philanthropy, eastern mysticism, sexual psychology, and the simple life at Holmesfield.

====Sheffield Literary and Philosophical Society====
Several other large groups of letters may be mentioned here, each forming part of composite collections. In the Sheffield Literary and Philosophical Society's (SLPS) collection is the correspondence of James Montgomery, Sheffield poet and editor of the Iris newspaper (1771-1854). His correspondents included a number of lesser literary figures of his period (examples are William Roscoe, William Carey, Dr [[John Aikin]], Barbara Hofland, Mrs Basil Montagu) and evangelical Christians on both sides of the Atlantic; his correspondence with Joseph Aston includes the period of Montgomery's trial and imprisonment in 1794. Also in the SLPS collection are letters to Henry Clifton Sorby, the Sheffield geologist, over the period 1844 - 1896.

====Hunter Archaeological Society====
Correspondence and diaries of Mrs Margaret Gatty and her daughter, Mrs Juliana H. Ewing, form part of the Hunter Archaeological Society's collection. Both were writers of children's books and Mrs Gatty did interesting work on algae; her correspondence includes letters from authorities in this field and Mrs Ewing's includes letters written by her from Fredericton in Canada and her correspondence with Randolph Caldecott, illustrator of her books (many of his adorned with pen and ink sketches). The period covered is 1830 - 1885.

====Clarke family of Noblethorpe====
Industry (particularly coal mining) and landowning naturally go together in many other family archives. Notable in this category are the Clarke family of Noblethorpe's estate and colliery records. This family worked some of the best Silkstone coal in South Yorkshire. Cumulatively their papers give a good picture of the coal trade as carried on by canal and the changeover to rail.

====Crewe Muniments====
Among the many collections of South Yorkshire deeds may be mentioned the Crewe muniments, including Bawtry deeds of the Lister family with references to wharves and trade on the river Idle.

===Business records===
The rich industrial history of the Sheffield area is represented in the large collections of business records, which cover iron and steel, silver plate, coal mining and cutlery firms to professional firms of solicitors, land surveyors, auctioneers and architects. Many of the city’s major industrial concerns have deposited their archives at Sheffield, notably:

The firm of Thomas Bradbury and Sons, silver platers, is represented by day books, ledgers, orders, correspondence, etc., going back to the 1780s. A particular feature of this collection is the fine series of early engraved catalogues of old Sheffield plate.

A collection of 29 massive ledgers of the South Yorkshire and North Derbyshire iron trade carried on by the syndicate of iron-masters of whom William Spencer was one, links up with material in the Spencer Stanhope collection. It was deposited by the Staveley Iron Works and covers the period 1690-1766. The ledgers give detailed information of many aspects of the iron trade and were unknown to Dr A. Raistrick when he wrote 'The South Yorkshire ironmasters, 1690-1750' (Economic History Review, 1939).

There is also one volume of Staveley furnace accounts, 1772-1806. The nail and file trade in Sheffield is represented by orders, correspondence, etc., of the firm of Joseph Bramall, originally of [[Oughtibridge]] and subsequently of Sheffield, from 1856 to about 1932. A sheep-shear makers, Burgon &amp; Ball, has records from its commencement in the 1860s; these include much relating to its Australian trade. The firm also had an agency for the sale of bicycles with rubber tyres in the eighteen-nineties and cars early in this century. The technical drawing office records of the Yorkshire Engine Company consist of engine plans and orders and there is also a series of photographs of many engines made by the firm. A selected series of over seventy sales ledgers of Arthur Balfour's (now Balfour Darwin's) illustrates the growth of the firm's trade in steel throughout the world from 1865 to about 1948. Spear &amp; Jackson, tool makers, have also deposited some records. The business of an eighteenth-century hardware (cutlery) merchant is represented by stock and account books of Walter Oborne of Sheffield and subsequently of Ravenfield. Cutlery manufacturing firms, mainly of the nineteenth century, are represented by small deposits of Thomas Nowill &amp; Co., Christopher Johnson &amp; Co., and Ibbotson Bros., and by some orders and correspondence of Joseph Rodgers &amp; Sons rescued from destruction in the 1930s. Reference has already been made to the Sheffield Smelting Company's extensive records. From Thurlstone, bordering on the textile district, have come records of a peculiar trade, the making of hair-cloth and bagging for oil presses, from about 1790-1820s; this archive contains a series of letters from an emigrant to Pittsburg, written to his relatives in Yorkshire.

===Trade Unions===
Trades Unionism, another aspect of industrial life, is represented by archives of the local branch of ASLEF (from 1880), the Sawmakers' Protection Society (from 1860), the Pen and Pocket Blade Forgers' and Smithers' Protection Society (from 1870), and the Table-blade Grinders Association (from 1907, on microfilm); not all the records however are continuous from the earliest dates.

===Solicitors===
The numerous deposits received from solicitors contain much relating to families, manors, estates and local public business. Notable items among them include records of the Heck and Wentbridge Railway, 1825–28, and some papers relating to the Snaith and Co wick Police Association, 1847-58 (Clark &amp; Co. of Snaith); records of the Sheffield-Wakefield Turnpike trust from 1741 (Wheat and Tibbitts collections); land society trust deeds (Parker collection); some seventeenth-century proceedings of the West Riding commission of sewers (Baxter collection).

===Fairbank Collection===
The Fairbank collection, mentioned earlier, containing the firm's draft maps and plans, and their field and survey books, covers the parish of Sheffield and many adjacent areas. As surveyors for local enclosures and turnpike roads, as well as for many private clients, they mapped manors, estates, street developments, single properties and even some collieries. One of their chief clients was the Duke of Norfolk's Sheffield agent, especially over the period from 1770 to 1801, and the Arundel Castle manuscripts include several hundreds of finished plans of various parts of the ducal estates in Sheffield. Together, these two collections must make Sheffield one of the best mapped towns at this period.

===Architectural Plans===
[[Architectural plan]]s have been received from the offices of several firms of architects and represent the work of local architects in the nineteenth and earlier twentieth centuries.

===Institutions and organizations===
Records have been deposited by a variety of different bodies such as political parties, trades unions, clubs, societies, charities, trusts and independent schools. Some are mentioned above.

===Individuals===
The letters, diaries and personal papers of many individuals from all walks of life have been deposited, including those as diverse as [[Edward Carpenter]], Mrs Gatty and [[David Blunkett]] MP.

===Maps===
A unique and vast accumulation of maps and surveys, mostly from the 18th and 19th centuries, in the Fairbank Collection, as well as enclosure, tithe and Ordnance Survey maps.

===Other records===
Photographs, including a series of aerial photographs, and audio recordings from Radio Sheffield.

The '''Social Sciences Citation Index''' ('''SSCI''') is a commercial [[citation index]] product of [[Clarivate Analytics]]. It was originally developed by the [[Institute for Scientific Information]] from the [[Science Citation Index]].

==Overview==
The SSCI citation database covers some 3,000 of the world's leading [[academic journals]] in the [[social sciences]] across more than 50 [[academic discipline|disciplines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Social Sciences Citation Index |url=http://scientific.thomson.com/products/ssci/ |accessdate=2008-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is made available online through the [[Web of Science]] service for a fee. The database records which articles are cited by other articles.

==Criticism==
[[Philip Altbach]] has criticised the Social Sciences Citation Index of favouring English-language journals generally and American journals specifically, while greatly underrepresenting journals in non-English languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Altbach|first=Philip |authorlink= Philip Altbach |year=2005 |article=Academic Challenges: The American Professoriate in Comparative Perspective |title=The Professoriate: Profile of a Profession |url= |location=Dortrecht |publisher=Springer |pages=147–165 |isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, economists [[Daniel B. Klein]] and Eric Chiang conducted a survey of the Social Sciences Citation Index and identified a bias against free market oriented research. In addition to an ideological bias, Klein and Chiang also identified several methodological deficiencies that encouraged the over-counting of citations, and they argue that the Social Sciences Citation Index does a poor job reflecting the relevance and accuracy of articles.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Klein and Eric Chiang. [http://econjwatch.org/articles/the-social-science-citation-index-a-black-box-with-an-ideological-bias The Social Science Citation Index: A Black Box—with an Ideological Bias?] ''Econ Journal Watch'', Volume 1, Number 1, April 2004, pp 134–165.&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Sponsa Christi is the Latin term for "[[Spouse of Christ]]"''
'''Sponsa Christi''' is an [[Apostolic Constitution]] issued by [[Pope Pius XII]] on the [[Feast of the Presentation]], November 21, 1950. It addresses the vocation of consecrated women and their mystical engagement with Christ.

==Characteristics of the consecrated life==
The first part of the constitution deals with the historical development of the vocation of virginity and the development of monastic women's monasteries from the congregations of consecrated virgins of the early church, and in particular the contemplative life. Pius XII. describes the characteristics of the consecrated life of women and explains: "Because of their consecration by the diocesan Bishop, they acquire a special bond with the Church, to which they devote their service, even if they remain in the world. Alone or in community they represent a special eschatological image of the heavenly bride and the future life, when the church will finally live the love of her bridegroom Christ in abundance.

For sacred virgins the service of the liturgy is essential. The Word of God and the liturgy are the sources from which the consecrated virgins are to draw, to know the will of God and to bind themselves to him in freedom and in love. In the same part, the Pope sets out the provisions governing nuns' examinations. With this constitution fixed rules for religious communities are established, furthermore, a guideline is given to the consecrated virgins living in the world.

Pope Pius cited ''Sponsa Christi'' in the March 25, 1954 encyclical ''Sacra Virginitas'' as showing the importance of the office consecrated men and women fulfill in the Church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://w2.vatican.va/content/pius-xii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_25031954_sacra-virginitas.html Pope Pius XII. ''Sacra Virginitas'', §3, March 25, 1954, Libreria Editrice Vaticana]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundations of Canon Law==
The second part specifies the statutes valid according to canon law:
*Article I. §§ 1-3 Establishment of religious orders for women
*Article II. §§ 1-3 Special Forms of Monastic Religious Life
*Article III. §§ 1-3 Affiliation and virgin consecration
*Article IV. §§ 1-5 Big and small papal examinations
*Article V. §§ 1-4 Commitment to the public celebration of the Liturgy of the Hours in chorus
*Article VI. §§ 1-3 Hierarchy and Order in Women's Monasteries
*Article VII. §§ 1-3 Authorization procedure by the Holy See
*Article VIII. §§ 1-3 Monastic work for the maintenance of the monasteries
*Article IX. Final provisions and exhortatio for strict compliance with these regulations

By the June 29, 2016 Apostolic Constitution ''Vultum Dei quaerere'' (On the contemplative life in the Women's Order) Pope Francis repealed the ''Statuta generalia Monialium'' (General statutes concerning nuns).

The '''Staatliches Filmarchiv der DDR''' ('''SFA''') ("State Film Archive of the GDR") was the central [[film archive]] of the GDR ([[East Germany]]). 

The archive, founded on 1 October 1955, was commissioned to collect, secure and make publicly accessible the results of the national film production. The first director was Rudolf Bernstein, previously director of the film distribution company [[Progress Film]].

The initial collection consisted of copies of films given to the East German government in 1954 by the [[Soviet Union]], comprising the remains of the collections of the former ''[[Reichsfilmarchiv]]'', the originals of which had been acquired by the Soviet army when it advanced into Berlin in 1945. Additionally the new film archive received copies of all films made in East Germany. For the better conservation and restoration of its film collections the archive possessed, among other facilities, a copying studio.

After the reunification of Germany the ''Staatliches Filmarchiv der DDR'' was incorporated on 3 October 1990 into the film collections of the ''[[Bundesarchiv]]'' ("German Federal Archives").

[[File:CGJung.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Carl Gustav Jung]]

'''''The Collected Works of C. G. Jung''''' is a [[book series]] containing the first collected edition, in English translation, of the major writings of Swiss psychiatrist [[Carl Jung|Carl Gustav Jung]]. The volumes were edited and translated from the original German by [[Gerhard Adler]] and [[R.F.C. Hull]], occasionally with assistance from others. Most were not written by Jung as books, but are collections of papers, essays, lectures, letters, etc. written by Jung from 1902 until his death in 1961, and compiled by editors from 1945 onward.&lt;ref name='PUPCat'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://press.princeton.edu/catalogs/series/bscwj.html | title = Collected Works of C.G. Jung | accessdate = 2014-01-15 | publisher = Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series contains revised versions of works previously published, works not previously translated, and new translations of many of Jung's writings. Several of the volumes are extensively illustrated; each contains an index and most contain a bibliography. Prior to Jung's death he supervised the revisions of the text, some of which were extensive.&lt;ref name='RoutledgeMain'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.taylorandfrancis.com/catalogs/jung_and_analytical_psychology_2013_online_catalog/4/ | title = Collected Works of C.G.

An enormous body of Jung's work still remains unpublished.&lt;ref name="PhilemonWorks"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://philemonfoundation.org/ |title=The Complete Works of C.G.

[[Princeton University Press]] published these volumes in the United States as part of its [[Princeton University Press#Bollingen Series|Bollingen Series]] of books. [[Routledge|Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul]] published them independently in the United Kingdom.

This article shows dates and titles for hardback (cloth) volumes in the catalog of the Princeton University Press, which also includes paperback and ebook versions.

This volume is a current record, through 1990, of all of C. G. Jung's publications in German and in English, replacing the 1979 edition. It records the initial publication of each original work by Jung, each translation into English, and all significant new editions, including paperbacks and publications in periodicals. The contents of the respective volumes of the ''Collected Works of C. G. Jung'' and the ''Gesammelte Werke'' (published in Switzerland) are listed in parallel to show the interrelation of the two editions. Jung's seminars are dealt with in detail. Where possible, information is provided about the origin of works that were first conceived as lectures. There are indexes of all publications, personal names, organizations and societies, and periodicals.&lt;ref name='Routledge'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.taylorandfrancis.com/catalogs/jung_and_analytical_psychology_2013_online_catalog/4/ | title = Collected Works of C.G.

==General Index (Volume 20)==
This volume is the general index to the eighteen published textual volumes in the ''Collected Works of C.G. Jung''. The comprehensive indexing goes beyond the volume indexes, and includes sub-indexes to important general topics, such as Alchemical Collections; Codices and Manuscripts; Freud; and the sub-indexing for the Bible arranged by book, chapter and verse.&lt;ref name='Routledge' /&gt;&lt;ref name='PUP20'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://press.princeton.edu/titles/1285.html | title = Collected Works of C.G.

The General Index, with the General Bibliography of C.G. Jung's Writings (Volume 19 of the ''Collected Works''), together complete the publication of the ''Collected Works of C.G. Jung'' in English.&lt;ref name='Routledge' /&gt;&lt;ref name='PUP20'/&gt;

'''''The Elements of Typographic Style''''' is the authoritative book on typography and style by Canadian [[Typography|typographer]], [[poet]] and [[translator]] [[Robert Bringhurst]]. Originally published in 1992 by [[Hartley &amp; Marks Publishers]], it was revised in 1996, 2001 (v2.4), 2002 (v2.5), 2004 (v3.0), 2005 (v3.1), 2008 (v3.2), and 2012 (v4.0). A history and guide to [[typography]], it has been praised by [[Hermann Zapf]], who said “I wish to see this book become the Typographers’ Bible.”&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Zapf, as cited on the back cover of the book in version 4.0, {{ISBN|978-0-88179-212-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonathan Hoefler]] and [[Tobias Frere-Jones]] consider it "the finest book ever written about typography," according to the FAQ section of their type foundry's website.&lt;ref name=TypographyCom&gt;{{cite web|title=Can you recommend any good books on typography?|url=http://www.typography.com/faq/question.php?faqID=60|website=www.typography.com|accessdate=2014-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its status as a respected and frequently cited resource, typographers and designers often refer to it simply as ''Bringhurst''.

The title alludes to ''[[The Elements of Style]]'', the classic guide to writing by [[William Strunk, Jr.|Strunk]] and [[E. B. White|White]].&lt;ref&gt;Foreword to version 3.1, p. 9, {{ISBN|0-88179-206-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Versus''' is an online comparison tool for [[mobile phone]]s, [[tablet computer|tablets]], [[camera]]s, [[camcorder]]s and cities. 
Versus aims to be the #1 destination to help users make informed buying decisions. It is the world’s first &amp; only multi-language all-algorithm and big data driven content provider generating fully automated natural text. With a keen focus on the user interface, the comparison platform turns raw data into natural language and simplifies complexity. In using Versus, consumers are able to view results in a simple and clear format, without ‘information overload’ and ultimately allowing users to digest complex product data quickly and efficiently.

Versus plans to add an additional 640 categories, to include [[real estate]], [[motorcycle]]s, [[food]], [[credit card]]s, [[bank]]s, [[plastic surgeon]]s and even people. Unlike similar sites, the comparisons do not include user reviews but are strictly based on technical specifications such as screen resolution and processing power; the site then presents the results pointing out why one should prefer a product over the other.&lt;ref name=TechCrunch&gt;{{cite web|title=VERSUS IO Aims To Compare Anything|url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/07/18/versus-io-aims-to-compare-anything-has-its-fanboy-filter-dialled-high/|publisher=TechCrunch|accessdate=11 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The service has been launched in April 2012 by a [[Germany|German]] startup, [[URGE IO]], and is currently available in 18 languages; it claims 500k monthly visits and a 60% page-view growth rate on a monthly basis.&lt;ref name=TheNextWeb&gt;{{cite web|title=Should you choose this one or that one?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1742">A number of medieval [[chronicle]]s of the [[history of Wales]] survive, 
notably the 9th century ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'' and the 10th century ''[[Annales Cambriae]]''. These early chronicles are written in Latin, while from the 12th century, some  are composed in [[Middle Welsh]]. The oldest surviving manuscripts of chronicles kept in the [[National Library of Wales]], [[Aberystwyth]] date to the 13th century.

The history of Wales becomes tangible from the 7th century. Accounts in the chronicles pertaining to [[Dark Age Wales]] of the 5th and 6th century, including [[Historical basis for King Arthur|early references to King Arthur]], [[Vortigern]], [[Maelgwn Gwynedd]] and others, may contain semi-legendary or semi-historical material, which however cannot be substantiated as historical with any certainty.

''[[Brut y Brenhinedd]]'' is the title given to Middle Welsh versions of [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]''. ''[[Brut y Tywysogion]]'' is a continuation of ''Historia Regum Britanniae'', covering the period of  682 to 1332. The ''[[Brenhinoedd y Saeson]]'' survives in 14th-century manuscripts and covers events from 682 to 1282.

The ''Annals of Owain Glyndwr'' give an account of the [[Glyndŵr Rising]], covering the period of 1400 to 1422.

'''Westminster 2010: Declaration of Christian Conscience''' is a [[Christian]] manifesto launched on [[Easter Sunday]] 2010 in the [[United Kingdom]]. It is modeled on the [[Manhattan Declaration: A Call of Christian Conscience|Manhattan Declaration]] in the [[United States]] and addresses the same three concerns: heterosexual marriage, the sanctity of human life, and freedom of conscience. The declaration states that marriage is "the only context for sexual intercourse".

Its signatories include the former [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[George Carey|Lord Carey]].

'''Yvon Robert''' (October 8, 1914 - July 12, 1971) was a [[French Canadian]] [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] who was best known to fans as '''Yvon "The Lion" Robert'''.

== Professional wrestling career ==
[[File:Portrait. Yvon Robert BAnQ P48S1P05653.jpg|thumb|right|Yvon Robert]]

=== American Wrestling Association (1932-1935) ===
Yvon Robert started wrestling in 1932 at age 17. He got his first stint in [[Boston]] with promoter [[Paul Bowser]]'s American Wrestling Association. He was trained by Emil Maupas. He was billed as '''The French Canadian Lion'''. He made his professional wrestling debut on April 4, 1932. During his early career, Robert feuded with wrestlers such as Rasputin, Joe Cox and Ernie Dusek.

=== National Wrestling Association (1935-1936) ===
In 1935, he made his [[National Wrestling Association]] (NWA) debut as '''Yvon "The Lion" Robert'''. It was a territory of [[World Boxing Association|National Boxing Association]] to sanction professional wrestling. He got his first big exposure after attacking [[World Heavyweight Championship (National Wrestling Association)|world champion]] [[Danno O'Mahony]] during a match. He left the promotion in 1936.

=== Montreal (1936-1944) ===
[[File:Snapshots. Taverne Yvon Robert. St. Gabriel &amp; St. Jacques BAnQ P48S1P05750.jpg|thumb|At his tavern in Montreal in 1940 with pictures of wrestlers, presumably himself on the wall.]]
In April 1936, he started wrestling in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]]. During his time with Montreal, he won the Montreal International Heavyweight Championship 16 times between 1936 and 1956. During 1943, he won the Montreal British Empire Heavyweight Championship.

=== American Wrestling Association (1936-1940) ===
Yvon returned to [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA) in July 1936. Just two weeks after his return, Yvon defeated Danno O'Mahony to win the [[AWA World Heavyweight Championship (Boston version)|AWA World Heavyweight Championship]] in Montreal, claiming his first World Title. He was recognized as the World Champion in [[New England]] and by the Montreal Athletic Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prowrestlinghistoricalsociety.com/awa-boston-world-heavyweight-championship.html|title=Title Lineages: AWA (Boston) World Heavyweight Championship}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert was stripped in December 1937 for not defending against [[Lou Thesz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/us/newengland/awa/ma-awa-h.html|title=American Wrestling Association World Heavyweight Title [Boston]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940, he left AWA for a second time.

=== National Wrestling Association (1940-1943) ===
In 1940, he started his second stint with NWA. In his second run with NWA, he got his biggest victory of his career on October 7, 1942. On this day, he beat [[Bill Longson|"Wild" Bill Longson]] to win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in Montreal, Quebec. On November 27, he lost the title to [[Bobby Managoff]] in [[Houston, Texas]]. In 1943, he left NWA.

=== Returning to Montreal (1944-1959) ===
He returned to Montreal, Quebec in 1944, and became a successful wrestler during this time. In 1948, he wrestled [[Gorgeous George]] to a draw at Montreal-record gate of $21,000 and broke that record within a year. In 1953, he formed a successful tag team with [[Whipper Billy Watson]] and won the Canadian Tag Team Championship. On November 12, Watson and Robert defeated Al Mills and Tiny Mills at a wrestling event held in Toronto with boxing champion [[Joe Louis]] as the special guest referee. On January 5, 1958, he teamed with Billy Wicks to defeat Corsica Joe and Corsica Jean in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] for the [[NWA World Tag Team Championship (Mid-America version)|Mid-America Tag Team Championship]], in what would be Robert's final title. In 1959, he came out of retirement.

__NOTOC__
The '''''Zhongwen Da Cidian''''', also known in [[English language|English]] as the '''''Encyclopaedic Dictionary of the Chinese Language''''', is an unabridged [[Chinese dictionary]], edited by [[Zhang Qiyun]] and others. The first edition had 40 volumes including its [[Chinese radical|radical]] index in volume 39 and [[stroke count|stroke]] index in volume 40. It was published from 1962 through 1968.

This encyclopedic dictionary includes 49,905 [[Chinese characters]] arranged under the traditional 214 [[Kangxi radicals]]. Each character entry shows the evolution of graphic forms (such as [[small seal script]]), gives pronunciations, and chronological meanings with sources. Words, phrases, and [[four-character idioms]] are given under the head character entry, arranged according to the number of [[stroke order|strokes]] in their components. "There are many phrases under some characters," note Teng and Biggerstaff (1971:133), for example, 3,417 under ''yi'' (一 "one") and 1,398 under ''huang'' (黄 "yellow").

Although the ''Zhongwen Da Cidian'' is based on the first edition 1960 ''[[Dai Kan-Wa Jiten]]'' ("Comprehensive Chinese–Japanese Dictionary") by [[Tetsuji Morohashi]],&lt;ref&gt;Paul Rouzer, ''A New Practical Primer of Literary Chinese'', Harvard University Press, {{ISBN|067402270X}}, p.&amp;nbsp;xix.&lt;/ref&gt; this work is not listed under works consulted. The ''Zhongwen Da Cidian'' was the best available reference work of Chinese until 1993, when the ''[[Hanyu Da Cidian]]'' ("Comprehensive Dictionary of Chinese") was completed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2240">The '''''Ökumenische Heiligenlexikon''''' (ÖHL) or '''''Ecumenical Lexicon of Saints''''' is an independent, [[ecumenical]], private internet project by Protestant priest, Joachim Schäfer, from Stuttgart, which aims to publish information on the lives of [[saint]]s and other "holy people".&lt;ref&gt;Joachim Schäfer: [http://www.heiligenlexikon.de/ Ökumenisches Heiligenlexikon]. Retrieved 21 Aug 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lexicon ==
The lexicon is the largest and most comprehensive online repository of information on saints and other people considered blessed or holy.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Bräunlein: [http://www.hsozkult.de/webreview/id/rezwww-55 ''Web-Rezension zu: Das ökumenische Heiligenlexikon.''] In: ''[[H-Soz-u-Kult]]'', 28 August 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The basis of the collection are sources that are generally accessible, especially reprinted church history works. One aim is to edit out conflicting and false information, without making any claim to be scholarly. [[Volunteering|Volunteers]] with relevant expertise help the project with information and check articles for correction.

The ''Ökumenische Heiligenlexikon'' is available on the [[World Wide Web|Internet]], [[CD ROM]]s and other electronic data devices. No book publications are planned.
