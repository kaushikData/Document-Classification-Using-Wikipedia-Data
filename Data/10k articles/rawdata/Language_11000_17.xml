== About ARGOsearch ==
ARGOsearch allows users to search recordings for spoken words, phone numbers and dates associated with a conversation, i.e. the audio recording, call notes, transcriptions, and meta-data.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.calltrunk.com/us/en/the-service/argo.html&lt;/ref&gt;

ARGOsearch is a spin-off from [[Calltrunk]] - a cloud-based call recording and call management business that provides services to consumers, SMBs and large enterprises. ARGOsearch was developed on Calltrunk's [[OpenVoice]] Platform.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.argosearch.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

== How it works ==
The ARGOsearch software, available for computers and mobile devices, enables users to record phone calls and search them for verbal information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://calltrunk.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120124092219/https://www.calltrunk.com/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-01-24 |title=Calltrunk |publisher=Calltrunk }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subscribers store spoken data from mobiles, land lines, [[Skype]] or a dictaphone, and upload them into an online storage bank. They can then search the recorded conversations for dates, times, words or phrases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tech/news/a377209/argosearch-conversation-search-engine-launches.html#ixzz2IpevFbQN |title=ARGOsearch conversation search engine launches - Tech News |publisher=Digital Spy}}&lt;/ref&gt; ARGOsearch's word indexation accuracy is around 80%.

ARGOsearch enables individuals and small companies to capture, store and search conversations in the way that large companies already can.&lt;ref name="Digital Spy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tech/news/a377209/argosearch-conversation-search-engine-launches.html#ixzz2IpfE9GKJ |title=ARGOsearch conversation search engine launches - Tech News |publisher=Digital Spy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ArgoSearch is currently free, though a [[OP3Nvoice]] spokesman said the company would eventually charge for it. It works in Web browsers and on the iPhone, and Android phones.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Boehret |first=Katherine |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304432704577349881132834906 |title=Keeping Close Track of Chats, Word for Word - WSJ.com |publisher=Online.wsj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ARGOsearch is available in beta in the US, UK and Australia.&lt;ref name="Digital Spy"/&gt;

'''Ammonite''' is the extinct [[Canaanite language]] of the [[Ammon]]ite people mentioned in the [[Bible]], who used to live in modern-day [[Jordan]], and after whom its capital [[Amman]] is named. Only fragments of their language survive - chiefly the 9th century BC [[Amman Citadel Inscription]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kchanson.com/ANCDOCS/westsem/citadel.html Amman Citadel Inscription]&lt;/ref&gt; the 7th-6th century BC Tell Siran bronze bottle, and a few [[ostraca]]. As far as can be determined from the small corpus, it was extremely similar to [[Biblical Hebrew]], with some possible [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] influence including the use of the verb ''‘bd'' (עבד) instead of the more common Biblical Hebrew ''‘śh'' (עשה) for "make". The only other notable difference with Biblical Hebrew is the sporadic retention of feminine singular ''-t'' (''’šħt'' "cistern" but ''‘lyh'' "high (fem.)".)

It was first described as a separate language in 1970 by Italian Orientalist [[:it:Giovanni Garbini|Giovanni Garbini]].{{sfn|Ahituv|1995}} Subsequently, a number of inscriptions previously identified as Hebrew, Phoenician, or Aramaic were reclassified, as a result of consensus around the similarity of the Amman Theatre Inscription, Amman Citadel Inscription, Tell Siren Bottle, Heshbon Ostraca, and Tell el-Mazer Ostraca.{{sfn|Aufrecht|1989|ps=:"The discovery of the Amman Theatre Inscription, Amman Citadel Inscription, Tell Siren Bottle, Heshbon Ostraca, and Tell el-Mazer Ostraca has opened a new chapter in the study of ancient Northwest Semitic inscriptions: the recognition and analysis of the language and script of ancient Ammon. These new discoveries, in turn, have prompted a reclassification of a number of epigraphic materials previously identified as Hebrew, Phoenician, or Aramaic."}}

According to ''[[Glottolog]]'', referencing Huehnergard &amp; Rubin (2011), Ammonite was not a distinct language from Hebrew.&lt;ref name="Glottolog2" /&gt;

The '''Ao languages''' or '''Central Naga languages''' are a small family of [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] spoken by the [[Ao Naga|Ao]] of north-central [[Nagaland]] in northeast [[India]]. Conventionally classified as "Naga", they are not clearly related to other [[Kuki-Chin–Naga languages|Naga languages]], and are conservatively classified as an independent branch of Sino-Tibetan, pending further research. There are around 607,000 speakers of the languages in total. 

Coupe (2012)&lt;ref&gt;Coupe, Alexander R. 2012. Overcounting numeral systems and their relevance to sub-grouping in the Tibeto-Burman languages of Nagaland. Language and Linguistics / Academica Sinica 13. 193-220.&lt;/ref&gt; considers the [[Angami–Pochuri languages]] to be most closely related to Ao as part of a wider ''Angami–Ao'' group.

==Languages==
The following languages are widely accepted as Ao languages:
*[[Chungli Ao language|Chungli Ao]]
*[[Mongsen Ao language|Mongsen Ao]]
*[[Sangtam language|Sangtam]] ('Thukumi')
*[[Yimchungrü language|Yimchungrü]] ('Yachumi')
*[[Lotha language|Lotha]] (Lhota)
There are also various undescribed Ao 'dialects,' including Yacham and Tengsa, which may turn out to be separate languages (see [[Mongsen Ao language|Mongsen Ao]]).

The following "Naga" languages spoken in and around [[Leshi Township]], Myanmar are classified as Ao languages ("Ao-Yimchungrü") by Saul (2005).&lt;ref name="Saul"&gt;Saul, J. D. 2005. ''The Naga of Burma: Their festivals, customs and way of life''. Bangkok, Thailand: Orchid Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Koki Naga language|Koki]]
*[[Makury language|Makury]]
*[[Long Phuri language|Long Phuri]]
*[[Para language|Para]]

The four languages above are listed as unclassified Kuki-Chin-Naga languages in ''Ethnologue''. Bruhn (2014:370) also surmises that [[Makury language|Makury]] may be an Ao language.

Bruhn (2014) uses the term ''Central Naga'' to refer to all of the languages above, and uses the ''Ao'' to refer to only two languages, namely Chungli Ao and Mongsen Ao. The internal structure of Bruhn's Central Naga group is as follows.
;Central Naga
*[[Lotha language|Lotha]]
*[[Sangtam language|Sangtam]]
*[[Yimchungrü language|Yimchungrü]]
*Ao
**[[Chungli Ao language|Chungli Ao]]
**[[Mongsen Ao language|Mongsen Ao]]

==Ao language cluster==
(''Note'': The Ao language cluster described here does not include the [[Lotha language|Lotha]], [[Sangtam language|Sangtam]], and [[Yimchungrü language|Yimchungrü]] languages.)

''[[Ethnologue]]'' lists the following varieties of Ao.
*Mongsen Khari
*Changki
*Chongli (Chungli)
*Dordar (Yacham)
*Longla

Chongli and Mongsen are nearly mutually unintelligibile.

[[Image:Nagaland in India.png|thumb|Location of Nagaland]]
Mills (1926) lists the Ao Naga tribes of Nagaland as speaking three languages: Chungli, Mongsen, and Changki. [[Chungli Ao]] and [[Mongsen Ao]] are spoken in majority of the Ao villages, whereas Changki speakers form the minor speakers.

[[Mongsen Ao]] is spoken primarily in the western part of Ao territory.

Changki Ao is spoken only in 3 villages - Changki, Japu and Longjemdang - which is poorly documented though reportedly related to Mongsen Ao. Some Changki speakers can fluently converse in both Mongsen and Chungli, but a Mongsen Ao cannot speak Changki or understand it, whereas a Chungli can hardly understand or speak Changki. Chungli Ao and Mongsen Ao are not mutually intelligible.&lt;ref&gt;Escamilla, R. M. (2012). ''An Updated Typology of Causative Constructions: Form-Function Mappings in Hupa (California Athabaskan), Chungli Ao (Tibeto-Burman), and Beyond.'' Unpublished PhD dissertation, U.C. Berkeley.&lt;/ref&gt;

The speech of each Ao village has its own distinctive characteristics. Many villages contain both Chungli and Mongsen speakers.

==Reconstruction==
Proto-Central Naga (Proto-Ao) has been reconstructed by Bruhn (2014).

Bruhn (2014:363) identifies the following four sound changes from [[Proto-Tibeto-Burman]] (PTB) to Proto-Central Naga (PCN) as sound changes that are characteristic of the Central Naga branch.
#PTB *-a(ː)w, *-əw, *-ow, *-u &gt; PCN *-u(ʔ) ‘back diphthong merger’
#PTB *-r &gt; PCN *-n ‘*r-coda nasalization’
#PTB *-s &gt; PCN *-t ‘*s-coda occlusivization’
#PTB *-i(ː)l, *‑al, *‑uːl &gt; PCN *‑ə(ʔ) ‘*l-rime erosion’

== Biography ==
Student in the [[University of Barcelona]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/135349 Auñamendi Eusko Entziklopedia: Arantxa Urretabizkaia Bejarano] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Urretabizkaia wrote the screenplays of:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0882088/Arantxa Urretabizkaia on IMDB]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''A los cuatro vientos'', (English title: To the Four Winds), 1987
# ''Zergatik panpox? (Basque - released as a film in 1985)
# ''Albaniaren konkista'', (Basque title: Albaniaren konkista), 1984.

In 1981 she also acted in ''La Fuga de Segovia'' film (English title: ''Escape from Segovia'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.unr.edu/depts/basqlib/basquefilm/filmsearchn.asp?p_name=Urretabizkaia,%20Arantxa Urretabizkaia on Basque Film Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Basque theatre company ''Agerre Teatroa'' adapted her novel «Zergatik Panpox?»  and performed in [[Madrid]] the resulting monologue, an interpretation by Maite Agirre of the feminine condition and [[fin de siècle]] solitude.

In 1988, the [[Basque Government]]'s Department of Culture and Tourism created the ''Premio de Merecimiento de las Letras Vascas'' and appointed Urretabizkaia a member to represent Basque cultural interests.

Some of her works has also been translated to [[German language|German]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Urretabizkaia eta Jimenez, ondo hartuak Alemanian |publisher=[[Berria]] |url=http://paperekoa.berria.info/kultura/2008-11-20/047/903/urretabizkaia_eta_jimenez_ondo_hartuak_alemanian_.htm |accessdate=2010-08-29 |language=basque |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716234446/http://paperekoa.berria.info/kultura/2008-11-20/047/903/urretabizkaia_eta_jimenez_ondo_hartuak_alemanian_.htm |archivedate=2011-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Billon''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɪ|l|ən}} is an [[alloy]] of a [[precious metal]] (most commonly [[silver]], but also [[mercury (element)|mercury]]) with a majority base metal content (such as [[copper]]).  It is used chiefly for making [[coin]]s, [[medal]]s, and [[token coin]]s.

The word comes from the [[French language|French]] ''bille'', which means "log".&lt;ref name=dic.com&gt;{{cite web|title = Billon|publisher= Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1). Random House, Inc.|url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/billon |accessdate= 2009-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Post-medieval , Coin (FindID 188060).jpg|thumb|Billon [[bawbee]] coin of [[James V of Scotland]].]]
The use of billon coins dates from [[ancient]] [[Ancient Greek|Greece]] and continued through the [[Middle Ages]]. During the sixth and fifth centuries BC, some cities on [[Lesbos]] used coins made of 60% copper and 40% silver. In both ancient times and the Middle Ages, leaner mixtures were adopted, with less than 2% silver content.&lt;ref name=tulane&gt;{{cite web| last = Harl| first = Dr. Kenneth| title = Early Medieval and Byzantine Civilization: Constantine to Crusades| publisher = tulane.edu| date = 1998-03-19| url = http://www.tulane.edu/~august/H303/currency/Diocletian.htm| accessdate = 2009-09-25| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091015203557/http://www.tulane.edu/~august/H303/currency/Diocletian.htm| archivedate = 2009-10-15| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eh.net&gt;{{cite web|last=Munro |first=John |title=Review of Earl J.

Billon coins are perhaps best known from the [[Roman Empire]], where progressive [[debasement]]s of the Roman ''[[denarius]]'' and the Roman provincial ''[[tetradrachm]]'' in the second century AD led to declining silver and increasing [[bronze]] content in these denominations of coins.  Eventually, by the third quarter of the second century AD, these coins were almost entirely bronze, with only a thin coating or even a wash of silver.&lt;ref&gt;Erik Christiansen, ''Coinage in Roman Egypt: The Hoard Evidence'' (Aarhus University Press, 2004) 135-141.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CCSID''' is an abbreviation used by [[IBM]] to mean "'''C'''oded '''C'''haracter '''S'''et '''Id'''entifier". It is a 16-bit number that represents a specific [[character encoding|encoding]] of a specific [[code page]]. For example, [[Unicode]] is a code page that has several encoding forms, like [[UTF-8]], [[UTF-16]] and [[UTF-32]].

==Difference between a code page and a CCSID==
The terms '''code page''' and '''CCSID''' are often used interchangeably, even though they are not synonymous. A code page may be only part of what makes up a CCSID. The following definitions, from IBM, help to illustrate this point, from glyph to CCSID and everything in between. 

A '''glyph''' is the actual physical pattern of pixels or ink that shows up on a display or printout. 

A '''character''' is a concept that covers all glyphs associated with a certain symbol. For instance, "F", "&lt;span style="font-weight: bold"&gt;F&lt;/span&gt;", "&lt;span style="font-style: italic"&gt;F&lt;/span&gt;", "&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;F&lt;/span&gt;", "&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;F&lt;/span&gt;", and "&lt;span style="font-family: Courier"&gt;F&lt;/span&gt;" are all different glyphs, but use the same character. The various modifiers (bold, italic, underline, color, and font) do not change the F's essential F-ness. 

A '''character set''' contains the characters necessary to allow a particular human to carry on a meaningful interaction with the computer.  It does not specify how those characters are represented in a computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-01.ibm.com/software/globalization/terminology/c.html|title=IBM Terminology - terms C|at="character set"|publisher=[[IBM]]|accessdate=2013-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This level is the first one to separate characters into various alphabets (Latin, Arabic, Hebrew, Cyrillic, and so on) or ideographic groups (Chinese, Korean, and so on). It corresponds to a "character repertoire" in the [[Character encoding#Unicode encoding model|Unicode encoding model]].

A '''code page''' represents a particular assignment of code point values to characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-01.ibm.com/software/globalization/terminology/c.html|title=IBM Terminology - terms C|at="code page", 3rd definition|publisher=[[IBM]]|accessdate=2013-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It corresponds to a "coded character set" in the [[Character encoding#Unicode encoding model|Unicode encoding model]]. A '''code point''' for a character is the computer's internal representation of that character in a given code page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-01.ibm.com/software/globalization/terminology/c.html|title=IBM Terminology - terms C|at="code point", 3rd definition|publisher=[[IBM]]|accessdate=2013-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many characters are represented by different code points in different code pages. Certain character sets can be adequately represented with single-byte code pages (which have a maximum 256 code points, hence a maximum of 256 characters), but many require more than that. Examples include [[JIS X 0208]] and [[Unicode]].

An '''encoding scheme''' is the byte format of a code page. It maps code point values to sequences of one or more byte values in a computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-01.ibm.com/software/globalization/cdra/appendix_a.html|title=IBM Character Data Representation Architecture - Appendix A. Encoding Schemes|publisher=[[IBM]]|accessdate=2013-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[UTF-8]] and [[UTF-16BE]] are two encodings of the same Unicode code page. In IBM's CDRA, this is typically represented with an ESID (Encoding Scheme IDentifier).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-01.ibm.com/software/globalization/cdra/chapter3.html#Header_35|title=IBM Character Data Representation Architecture, Chapter 3. CDRA Identifiers|at=section "Long-Form Identification"|accessdate=2013-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[#Extended Unix Code|EUC]] and [[ISO-2022]] are other examples of encoding schemes. 

A '''coded character set identifier (CCSID)''' contains all of the information necessary to assign and preserve the meaning and rendering of characters through various stages of processing and interchange. This information always includes at least one code page, but may include multiple code pages of differing byte-lengths. The CCSID also has an associated encoding scheme that governs how various code points are to be handled. This mechanism allows a program to recognize [[BiDi|bidirectional]] orientation, character shaping (mainly of Arabic characters), and other complex encoding information.

==Examples==
The following examples show how some CCSIDs are made up of other CCSIDs.

|}

All three of these variant [[Shift-JIS]] CCSIDs are [[Multi-byte character set|MBCS]] (multi-byte character sets). The SBCS (single byte character set) portion of each CCSID is different. The DBCS portion is the same across each CCSID. CCSID 5028 uses an updated code page 897 called CCSID 4993. CCSID 932 uses the original code page 897, which is CCSID 897. CCSID 942 uses a different SBCS from the other 2 CCSIDs, which is 1041.

Also notice how CCSID 5028 and 4993 are different by 4096 (1000 in hexadecimal) from the predecessor CCSID with the same code page identifier. This is a common way that CDRA denotes an upgraded CCSID.

There are a few reasons for this complexity:
* Many of the CCSIDs are used in IBM databases, like [[IBM DB2|DB2]], where a database field only supports an SBCS, DBCS or MBCS string. CCSIDs allow programs to differentiate between which one is being used.
* When characters are added or replaced, like the Euro currency sign introduction, you can know whether the stored strings support or do not support those character additions because a different CCSID is being used. This versioning is important for the integrity of the data.
* Increases reuse of resources among similar CCSIDs &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibm.com/software/globalization/cdra/chapter7.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3150">A '''campus tour''' is a tour of a [[college]] or [[university]]'s campus. Prospective students, their family members and other visitors take campus tours to learn about the college or university's facilities, as well as student life, culture on campus, academics, and programs offered by the institution. During these tours, prospective students are able to learn about the [[built environment]] and the overall look and feel of the institution. 

Campus tours are usually free, as they promote the institution and encourage prospective students to attend the school. Often, schools may give visitors T-shirts or other gifts for taking a tour.  

== Tours ==
These tours are normally [[Walking tour|walking tours]] for groups of 10 to 30 visitors, led by a [[tour guide]].  Campus tours are often preceded by an information session, presented by a member of the [[University and college admission|admissions staff]]. Many campus tours include a visit to a [[residence hall]] room and a classroom or [[lecture hall]]. At most schools, tours are led by students, although admissions office staff or other representatives of the school may also be tour guides.  Most universities offer accommodations for students with disabilities, such as alternatives to walking for someone who cannot walk easily.

For prospective students, the tour may be part of a larger campus visitation program.  Some schools provide overnight accommodation and meals, and students may sit-in on a class during their visit. Some programs pair a prospective student with a current student and allow the prospective student to shadow the current student for a day.

== Usefulness ==
Like similar [[sales techniques]] that rely on the unconscious [[saliency bias]], a pleasant campus tour – perhaps taken in good weather and with a gift presented at the end – is effective at making students want to enroll, and an unpleasant experience – such as a chance encounter with a grumpy staff member – can have the opposite effect.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/well/family/skipping-the-college-tour.html|title=Skipping the College Tour|last=Reischer|first=Erica|date=2017-04-26|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-04-29|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The tours tend to emphasize peripheral things, such as the quality of the physical plant, and do not give students a full and accurate idea of either what the school's educational qualities are or what it would be like to live in that community, rather than merely visiting it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As a result, a tour can cause a student to make choices that are not aligned with their long-term educational goals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* Online photographic tour

* The pharyngealized vowels correspond to the sequences of vowel + {{IPA|/r/}} in the standard language.{{sfnp|Khan|Weise|2013|p=237}}
* The non-native vowels are occasionally used in cognates of some Standard German words, such as ''brüder'' {{IPA|[ˈpʁyːtoˤ]}} ('brothers'). In other cases, they are pronounced the same as {{IPA|/ɪ, iː, ɛ, eː/}}.{{sfnp|Khan|Weise|2013|p=238}}

A '''composite film''' is a [[feature film]] whose [[screenplay]] is composed of two or more distinct stories. More generally, '''composite structure''' refers to an [[aesthetics|aesthetic principle]] in which the [[narrative structure]] relies on contiguity and linking rather than linearity. In a composite text or film, individual pieces are complete within themselves, yet they form a whole work that is greater than the sum of its individual parts.&lt;ref name="Dunn-Morris"&gt;Dunn, Morris (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The history of composite films begins with composite novels. The composite novel is a literary work composed of shorter texts that—though individually complete and autonomous—are interrelated in a coherent whole according to one or more organizing principles.

Although the composite-text aesthetic can be traced back through [[Frame story|framework-stories]] (such as the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' and ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]''), story cycles (such as the [[Arthurian]] stories), and sacred composites (such as the [[Bible]]), composite texts had specific precursors in the village sketch of nineteenth century Europe and America. Reflecting its roots in the framework-story and/or the cycle, a typical village sketch may feature an introductory story and a summary story, with individually titled internal stories that do not necessarily depend upon specific sequencing.

Twentieth century experimentation with the composite whole-text aesthetic, i.e., combining individual short stories into a whole-text narrative, began with [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Dubliners]]'' and [[Sherwood Anderson]]'s [[Winesburg, Ohio (novel)|Winesburg, Ohio]] and accelerated thereafter, but the composite novel remained controversial among readers, reviewers, and critics. Some wanted to call these works "[[novel]]s" while others wanted to call them "collections". To their authors, however, these works were clearly not just collections of stories. Joyce insisted that ''Dubliners'' was a planned, integrated whole text. [[William Faulkner]] fought both publishers and critics over the whole-text coherence of ''[[Go Down, Moses]]'', refusing to append "And Other Stories" to the book's title. Later, [[Maxine Hong Kingston]] and [[Tim O'Brien (author)|Tim O'Brien]] would wage similar battles over ''The Woman Warrior: Memoirs of a Childhood Among Ghosts'' (1976) and ''[[The Things They Carried]]'' (1990), respectively. By the end of the twentieth century, authors were announcing their whole-text intentions by insisting on such sub-titles as "A Novel in Stories", or simply "A Novel".&lt;ref name="Dunn-Morris" /&gt;

Composite novels have been referred to as a number of other genre-names including short story cycle, framed miscellany, multi-faceted novel, story-novel, short story blend, double-novel, short story compound, short story composite, composite, anthology novel, para novel, triptych, [[mosaic novel]], loose-leaf novel, and short story sequence.

== Titles ==
Within a composite film, the individual stories may or may not be titled. Most highly integrated composite films, such as ''[[Love Actually]]'', ''[[Traffic (2000 film)|Traffic]]'' etc., do not have individually titled components while more traditional composite films, such as ''[[Paris, je t'aime]]'', ''[[Coffee &amp; Cigarettes]]'', ''[[Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her]]'', ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]'' etc., do. Titling each component reinforces its autonomy and helps viewers experience it both individually and as part of the whole film.

== Unifying elements ==
Many different devices are used to connect the individual stories to each other and to the film in its entirety. Unifying elements include repeated images (such as coffee cups and ash trays in ''Coffee &amp; Cigarettes''), recurring characters (the women within ''Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her'' appear in at least one story other than their own), shared incidents (drug addiction in ''[[Requiem for a Dream]]''), common settings (the dark streets of ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]''), similar themes (the three women of ''[[The Hours (film)|The Hours]]''), a single protagonist (Tommy in ''[[The Fountain]]''), collective protagonists (a group of people like generations of a family, coworkers, a club etc.), etc.

== Story sequencing ==
The sequence in which the individual stories unfold is often significant to the overall meaning of the film. Component pieces can be arranged in a number of different ways (chronologically, thematically, geographically etc.) and each method produces different results.

== Composite film scores ==
In regards to issues with connectivity, it is important to consider the musical score of composite films. Much like visual repetition or thematic similarities, the score offers another medium through which stories can be linked. Rather than leaving viewers with content to process, decode, intellectualize and then react to, the film score can produce emotional reactions immediately, before viewers have a chance to analyze their own responses. There are three main categories of composite film scores:

===Unified score===
In a unified score, there is no discernible difference between the music playing during each story segment. For example, in ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]'', the highly stylized background music offers ambiance and contributes to the setting and does not vary between characters and stories.  In ''[[Love Actually]]'', pop music blares through happy moments, ballads wail during morose moments, and triumphant strings swell when all things are as they should be.
  
===Composite score===
In a composite score, the music within each individual segment is independent and distinct from the music within other segments. For example, in ''[[Paris, je t'aime]]'', each titled piece is accompanied by music that relates only to that single piece rather than the film as a whole. In this example, rather than linking the story lines, the music serves to further distinguish each neighborhood from the others.

===Theme and variation===
Theme and variation refers to a main theme that varies slightly by story segment. For example, in ''[[The Fountain]]'', one main theme appears in each character's story, but there are also variations on that theme specific to those individual characters (tribal drums accompany the conquistador in Mayan territory, etc.). In ''[[Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her]]'', the main theme throughout the film consists of somber classical guitar and accompanying piano, but within each individually titled segment, there are minor differences. Sultry horns are added to the banker's scenes, as she is having an affair, and as the detective investigates the death of her Hispanic friend, the music takes on a subtle Latin sound, etc.

'''Corporate jargon''', variously known as '''corporate speak''', '''corporate lingo''', '''business speak''', '''business jargon''', '''management speak''', '''workplace jargon''', '''corporatese''' or '''commercialese''', is the [[jargon]] often used in large [[corporation]]s, [[bureaucracy|bureaucracies]], and similar workplaces.&lt;ref name="Garner2009-2"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Bryan A. Garner]]|title=[[Garner's Modern American Usage]]|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sd3byNeBdR4C|accessdate=21 March 2013|edition=3rd|date=28 July 2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-987462-0|pages=168–69|chapter=Commercialese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WSJ"/&gt; The use of corporate jargon is criticised for its lack of clarity as well as for its tedium, making meaning and intention opaque and understanding difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/comment/going-forward-corporatese-should-be-confined-to-the-dustbin-20170316-guzxvi.html|title=Going forward, corporatese should be confined to the dustbin|last=Linnell|first=Garry|date=17 March 2017|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tone is associated with managers of large corporations, business management consultants, and occasionally government. Reference to such jargon is typically derogatory, implying the use of long, complicated, or obscure words, abbreviations, [[euphemism]]s, and acronyms. For that reason some of its forms may be considered as an [[argot]].&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;"corporate argot" in [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB116165746415401680 The Jargon Jumble: Kids Have 'Skeds,' Colleagues, 'Needs'], ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', 24 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these words may be actually new inventions, designed purely to fit the specialized meaning of a situation or even to "[[spin doctor|spin]]" negative situations as positive situations.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

'''Marketing speak''' is a related label for wording styles used to promote a product or service to a wide audience by seeking to create the impression that the vendors of the service possess a high level of sophistication, skill, and technical knowledge. Such language is often used in [[marketing]] [[press releases]], [[advertising copy]], and prepared statements read by executives and politicians.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

== Examples ==
{{See also|Glossary of business and management terms|List of buzzwords}}

Many terms have straightforward meanings in other contexts (e.g., leverage in physics, picked up with a well-defined meaning in finance), but are used more loosely in business speak. For example, ''[[deliverable]]'' is used to refer to anything that has to be done by a certain date to be verified by another party.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The phrases ''going forward'' or ''moving forward'' make a confident gesture towards the future, but are generally vague on timing, which usually means it can be removed from a sentence with little or no effect on its overall meaning.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Legal terms such as "[[Chapter 11]]" can be used without explaining what they are about: for example, Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code is about [[Bankruptcy in the United States|US bankruptcy]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

'''David Kellogg Lewis''' (September 28, 1941&amp;nbsp;– October 14, 2001) was an [[American philosopher]]. Lewis taught briefly at [[UCLA]] and then at [[Princeton University|Princeton]] from 1970 until his death.  He is also closely associated with [[Australia]], whose philosophical community he visited almost annually for more than thirty years. He made contributions in [[philosophy of language]], [[philosophy of mind]], [[philosophy of probability]], [[metaphysics]], [[epistemology]], [[philosophical logic]], and [[aesthetics]]. He is probably best known for his controversial [[modal realism|modal realist]] stance: that (i) [[Possible World|possible worlds]] exist, (ii) every possible world is a concrete entity, (iii) any possible world is causally and spatiotemporally isolated from any other possible world, and (iv) our world is among the possible worlds.

== Early life and education ==
Lewis was born in [[Oberlin, Ohio|Oberlin]], [[Ohio]], to John D. Lewis, a Professor of Government at [[Oberlin College]], and Ruth Ewart Kelloggs Lewis, a distinguished medieval historian. The formidable intellect for which he was known later in his life was already manifest during his years at [[Oberlin High School (Ohio)|Oberlin High School]], when he attended college lectures in [[chemistry]]. He went on to [[Swarthmore College]] and spent a year at [[Oxford University]] (1959–1960), where he was tutored by [[Iris Murdoch]] and attended lectures by [[Gilbert Ryle]], [[H.P. Grice]], [[P.F. Strawson]], and [[J.L. Austin]]. It was his year at Oxford that played a seminal role in his decision to study philosophy, and which made him the quintessentially [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] philosopher that he would soon become. Lewis went on to receive his Ph.D from [[Harvard]] in 1967, where he studied under [[W.V.O. Quine]], many of whose views he came to repudiate. It was there that his connection with [[Australia]] was first established when he took a seminar with [[J.J.C. Smart]], a leading Australian philosopher. "I taught David Lewis," Smart would say in later years, "Or rather, he taught me."

== Early work on convention ==
Lewis's first monograph was &lt;cite&gt;''Convention: A Philosophical Study''&lt;/cite&gt; (1969), which is based on his doctoral dissertation and uses concepts of [[game theory]] to analyze the nature of social conventions; it won the [[American Philosophical Association]]'s first Franklin Matchette Prize for the best book published in philosophy by a philosopher under 40 years old. Lewis claimed that social conventions, such as the convention in most states that one drives on the right (not on the left), the convention that the original caller will re-call if a phone conversation is interrupted, etc., are solutions to so-called "'co-ordination problems'". Co-ordination problems were at the time of Lewis's book an under-discussed kind of game-theoretical problem; most of the game-theoretical discussion had circulated around problems where the participants are in conflict, such as the [[prisoner's dilemma]].

Co-ordination problems are problematic, for, though the participants have common interests, there are several solutions. Sometimes, one of the solutions may be "'salient'", a concept invented by the game-theorist and economist [[Thomas Schelling]] (by whom Lewis was much inspired). For example, a co-ordination problem that has the form of a meeting may have a salient solution if there is only one possible spot to meet in town. But in most cases, we must rely on what Lewis calls "precedent" in order to get a salient solution. If both participants know that a particular co-ordination problem, say "which side should we drive on?" has been solved in the same way numerous times before, both know that both know this, both know that both know that both know this, etc. (this particular state Lewis calls [[common knowledge (logic)|common knowledge]], and it has since been much discussed by philosophers and game theorists), then they will easily solve the problem. That they have solved the problem successfully will be seen by even more people, and thus the convention will spread in the society. A convention is thus a behavioural regularity that sustains itself because it serves the interests of everyone involved. Another important feature of a convention is that a convention could be entirely different: one could just as well drive on the left; it is more or less arbitrary that one drives on the right in the USA, for example.

Lewis's main goal in the book, however, wasn't simply to provide an account of convention but rather to investigate the "platitude that language is ruled by convention" (&lt;cite&gt;Convention&lt;/cite&gt;, p.&amp;nbsp;1.) The last two chapters of the book (&lt;cite&gt;Signalling Systems&lt;/cite&gt; and &lt;cite&gt;Conventions of Language&lt;/cite&gt;; cf. also "Languages and Language", 1975) make the case that the use of a language in a population consists of conventions of truthfulness and trust among members of the population. Lewis recasts in this framework notions as those of truth and analyticity, claiming that they are better understood as relations between sentences and a language, rather than as properties of sentences.

== Counterfactuals and modal realism ==
&lt;!-- Missing image removed: [[Image:DavidLewis.jpg|thumb|David Lewis]] because is politician --&gt;

Lewis went on to publish &lt;cite&gt;Counterfactuals&lt;/cite&gt; (1973), which contained an analysis of [[counterfactual conditionals]] in terms of the theory of [[possible worlds]]. According to Lewis, what makes a statement of the form
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Had I made that shot our team would have won the game."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
true is that in any world where I make the shot but the world is otherwise as similar as possible to the actual one, our team wins the game. If there is a world maximally similar to ours where I make the shot but our team still loses, the counterfactual is false. This treatment of counterfactuals is a variation or generalization of the one published by [[Robert Stalnaker]] a few years earlier, and consequently this kind of treatment is called the [[Counterfactual conditional#Possible world semantics|Stalnaker-Lewis theory]].

===Realism about possible worlds===
What made Lewis's views about counterfactuals controversial is that whereas Stalnaker treated possible worlds as imaginary entities, "made up" for the sake of theoretical convenience, Lewis adopted a position his formal account of counterfactuals did not commit him to, namely [[modal realism]]. According to this view as Lewis formulated it, when we speak of a world where I made the shot that in this world I missed, we are speaking of a world just as real as this one, and although we say that in that world I made the shot, more precisely it is not I but a ''[[counterpart theory|counterpart]]'' of mine that was successful.

He had already proposed this view in some of his earlier papers: "Counterpart Theory and Quantified Modal Logic" (1968), "Anselm and Actuality" (1970), and "Counterparts of Persons and their Bodies" (1971). The theory was widely considered implausible, but Lewis urged that it should be taken seriously. Most often the idea that there exists an infinite number of causally isolated universes, each as real as our own but different from it in some way, and that furthermore that alluding to objects in this universe as necessary in order to explain what makes certain counterfactual statements true but not others, meets with what Lewis calls the "incredulous stare" (Lewis, OPW, 2005, pg. 135-137). Lewis defends and elaborates his theory of extreme modal realism, while insisting that there is nothing extreme about it, in &lt;cite&gt;[[On the Plurality of Worlds]]&lt;/cite&gt; (1986). Lewis acknowledges that his theory is contrary to common sense, but believes that its advantages far outweigh this disadvantage, and that therefore we should not be hesitant to pay this price.

According to Lewis, "actual" is merely an indexical label we give to a world when we locate ourselves in it. Things are [[logical truth|necessarily true]] when they are true in all possible worlds. (Note that Lewis is not the first one to speak of possible worlds in this context. [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] and [[C.I. Lewis]], for example, both speak of possible worlds as a way of thinking about possibility and necessity, and some of [[David Kaplan (philosopher)|David Kaplan]]'s early work is on the counterpart theory. Lewis's original suggestion was that all possible worlds are equally concrete, and the world in which we find ourselves is no more real than any other possible world.)

=== Criticisms ===
This theory has faced a number of criticisms. In particular, it is not clear how we could know what goes on in other worlds. After all, they are causally disconnected from ours; we can't look into them to see what is going on there.&lt;ref&gt;Stalnaker, ''Inquiry'', p. 49: "But if other possible worlds are causally disconnected from us, how do we know anything about them?"&lt;/ref&gt; A related objection is that, while people are concerned with what they could have done, they are not concerned with what some people in other worlds, no matter how similar to them, do. As [[Saul Kripke]] once put it, a presidential candidate could not care less whether someone else, in another world, wins an election, but does care whether he himself could have won it (Kripke 1980, p.&amp;nbsp;45). A more basic criticism is that introducing so many entities into our [[ontology]] violates the maxim of [[Occam's razor]], which tells us not to multiply theoretical entities beyond what is necessary to explain the facts our theories aim to explain.

Possible worlds are employed in the work of [[Saul Kripke]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Naming and Necessity|"Naming and Necessity", In Semantics of Natural Language, edited by D. Davidson and G. Harman. 1980 (1972) Dordrecht; Boston: Reidel.]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and many others, but not in the concrete sense propounded by Lewis. While none of these alternative approaches has found anything near universal acceptance, very few philosophers accept Lewis's particular brand of modal realism.

=== Influence ===
At Princeton, Lewis was a mentor of young philosophers, and trained dozens of successful figures in the field, including several current Princeton faculty members, as well as people now teaching at a number of the leading philosophy departments in the U.S. Among his most prominent students are [[Robert Brandom|Bob Brandom]] at the University of Pittsburgh, [[L.A. Paul]] at the University of North Carolina, [[Cian Dorr]] and [[David Velleman]] at NYU, [[Peter Railton]] at Michigan, and [[Joshua Greene (psychologist)|Joshua Greene]] at Harvard. His direct and indirect influence is evident in the work of many prominent philosophers of the current generation.

== Later life and death ==

Lewis suffered from severe [[diabetes]] for much of his life, which eventually grew worse and led to [[kidney]] failure. In July 2000 he received a [[kidney transplant]] from his wife Stephanie. The transplant allowed him to work and travel for another year, before he died suddenly and unexpectedly from further complications of his diabetes, on October 14, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=David Kellogg Lewis |quote= David Kellogg Lewis, a metaphysician and a philosopher of mind, language and logic at Princeton University, died on Sunday at his home in Princeton, N.J. He was 60. The cause was heart failure, Princeton University said. Mr. Lewis was once dubbed ''a mad-dog modal realist'' for his idea that any logically possible world you can think of actually exists. He believed, for instance, that there was a world with talking donkeys.  |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 20, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since his death a number of posthumous papers have been published, on topics ranging from truth and causation to philosophy of physics. &lt;cite&gt;''Lewisian Themes''&lt;/cite&gt;, a collection of papers on his philosophy, was published in 2004.

'''Digital video''' is an electronic representation of moving visual images ([[video]]) in the form of encoded [[digital data]]. This is in contrast to [[analog video]], which represents moving visual images with [[analog signal]]s. Digital video comprises a series of [[digital image]]s displayed in rapid succession.

Digital video was first introduced commercially in 1986 with the [[D1 (Sony)|Sony D1]] format{{cn|date=June 2018}}, which recorded an uncompressed [[standard definition]] [[component video]] signal in digital form. In addition to uncompressed formats, popular [[Data compression|compressed]] digital video formats today include [[H.264]] and [[MPEG-4]]. Modern interconnect standards for digital video include [[HDMI]], [[DisplayPort]], [[Digital Visual Interface]] (DVI) and [[serial digital interface]] (SDI).

Digital video can be copied with no degradation in quality. In contrast, when analog sources are copied, they experience [[generation loss]]. Digital video can be stored on digital media such as [[Blu-ray Disc]], on [[computer data storage]] or [[streaming video|streamed]] over the [[Internet]] to [[end user]]s who watch content on a [[desktop computer]] screen or a digital [[smart TV]]. In everyday practice, digital video content such as [[TV show]]s and [[movie]]s also includes a [[digital audio]] soundtrack.

==History==
Starting in the late 1970s to the early 1980s, several types of [[video production]] equipment that were digital in their internal workings were introduced. These included [[time base corrector]]s (TBC){{efn|For example the [[Thomson-CSF]] 9100 Digital Video Processor, an internally all-digital full-frame TBC introduced in 1980.}} and [[digital video effects]] (DVE) units.{{efn|For example the [[Ampex]] ADO, and the [[Nippon Electric Corporation]] (NEC) DVE.}} They operated by taking a standard analog [[composite video]] input and digitizing it internally. This made it easier to either correct or enhance the video signal, as in the case of a TBC, or to manipulate and add effects to the video, in the case of a DVE unit. The digitized and processed video information was then converted back to standard analog video for output.

Later on in the 1970s, manufacturers of professional video broadcast equipment, such as [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] (through their [[Fernseh]] division) and [[Ampex]] developed prototype digital [[videotape recorder]]s (VTR) in their research and development labs. Bosch's machine used a modified [[1 inch type B videotape]] transport, and recorded an early form of [[CCIR 601]] digital video. Ampex's prototype digital video recorder used a modified [[2 inch Quadruplex videotape]] VTR (an Ampex AVR-3), but fitted with custom digital video electronics, and a special "octaplex" 8-head headwheel (regular analog 2" Quad machines only used 4 heads). Like standard 2" Quad, the audio on the Ampex prototype digital machine, nicknamed by its developers as "Annie", still recorded the audio in analog as linear tracks on the tape. None of these machines from these manufacturers were ever marketed commercially.

Digital video was first introduced commercially in 1986 with the Sony [[D-1 (Sony)|D1]] format, which recorded an uncompressed [[standard definition]] [[component video]] signal in digital form. Component video connections required 3 cables and most [[television]] facilities were wired for composite NTSC or PAL video using one cable. Due this incompatibility and also due to the cost of the recorder, D1 was used primarily by large [[television network]]s and other component-video capable video studios.

In 1988, Sony and Ampex co-developed and released the [[D-2 (video)|D2]] digital videocassette format, which recorded video digitally without compression in [[ITU-601]] format, much like D1. But D2 had the major difference of encoding the video in composite form to the NTSC standard, thereby only requiring single-cable composite video connections to and from a D2 VCR, making it a perfect fit for the majority of television facilities at the time. D2 was a successful format in the [[television broadcast]] industry throughout the late '80s and the '90s. D2 was also widely used in that era as the master tape format for mastering [[laserdiscs]].{{efn|Prior to D2, most laserdiscs were mastered using analog [[1" Type C videotape]]}}

D1 &amp; D2 would eventually be replaced by cheaper systems using [[video compression]], most notably Sony's [[Digital Betacam]]{{efn|Digital Betacam is still heavily used as an [[electronic field production]] (EFP) recording format by professional television producers}} that were introduced into the network's [[television studio]]s. Other examples of digital video formats utilizing compression were Ampex's [[DCT (videocassette format)|DCT]] (the first to employ such when introduced in 1992), the industry-standard [[DV]] and MiniDV and its professional variations, Sony's [[DVCAM]] and Panasonic's [[DVCPRO]], and [[Betacam SX]], a lower-cost variant of Digital Betacam using [[MPEG-2]] compression.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

One of the first digital video products to run on personal computers was ''PACo: The PICS Animation Compiler'' from The Company of Science &amp; Art in Providence, RI, which was developed starting in 1990 and first shipped in May 1991. PACo could stream unlimited-length video with synchronized sound from a single file (with the ".CAV" [[file extension]]) on CD-ROM. Creation required a Mac; playback was possible on Macs, PCs, and Sun [[SPARCstation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CoSA Lives: The Story of the Company Behind After Effects |url=http://www.motionworks.com.au/2009/11/cosa-lives/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227132422/http://motionworks.com.au/2009/11/cosa-lives/ |archive-date=2011-02-27 |access-date=2009-11-16 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[QuickTime]], [[Apple Computer]]'s multimedia framework appeared in June 1991. [[Audio Video Interleave]] from [[Microsoft]] followed in 1992. Initial consumer-level content creation tools were crude, requiring an analog video source to be digitized to a computer-readable format. While low-quality at first, consumer digital video increased rapidly in quality, first with the introduction of playback standards such as [[MPEG-1]] and [[MPEG-2]] (adopted for use in television transmission and [[DVD]] media), and then the introduction of the [[DV]] tape format allowing recordings in the format to be transferred direct to digital video files using a [[FireWire]] port on an editing computer. This simplified the process, allowing [[non-linear editing system]]s (NLE) to be deployed cheaply and widely on [[desktop computer]]s with no external playback or recording equipment needed.

The widespread adoption of digital video and accompanying compression formats has reduced the bandwidth needed for a [[high-definition video]] signal (with [[HDV]] and [[AVCHD]], as well as several commercial variants such as [[DVCPRO]]-HD, all using less bandwidth than a standard definition analog signal). These savings have increased the number of channels available on [[cable television]] and [[direct broadcast satellite]] systems, created opportunities for [[spectrum reallocation]] of [[terrestrial television]] broadcast frequencies, made [[tapeless camcorder]]s based on [[flash memory]] possible among other innovations and efficiencies.&lt;!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]--&gt;

==Overview ==

Digital video comprises a series of orthogonal bitmap [[digital image]]s displayed in rapid succession at a constant rate. In the context of video these images are called '''[[film frame|frames]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;In fact the still images correspond to frames only in the case of progressive scan video. In interlaced video they correspond to fields. See section about interlacing for clarification&lt;/ref&gt;  The rate at which frames are displayed in is measured in '''frames per second (FPS)'''. Since every frame is an orthogonal bitmap digital image it comprises a raster of '''[[pixel]]s'''. If it has a width of '''W''' pixels and a height of '''H''' pixels it is said that the '''frame size''' is W''x''H. Pixels have only one property, their color. The color of a pixel is represented by a fixed number of bits. The more bits the more subtle variations of colors can be reproduced. This is called the '''[[color depth|color depth (CD)]]''' of the video.

An example video can have a '''duration (T)''' of 1 hour (3600''sec''), a frame size of 640x480 ''(WxH)'' at a color depth of 24 ''bits'' and a frame rate of 25''fps''. This example video has the following properties:
* '''pixels per frame''' = 640 * 480 = 307,200
* '''bits per frame''' = 307,200 * 24 = 7,372,800 = 7.37 ''Mbits''
* '''bit rate (BR)''' = 7.37 * 25 = 184.25 '''''Mbits/sec'''''
* '''video size (VS)'''&lt;ref&gt;the term ''video size'' is used instead of just ''size'' in order to avoid confusion with the ''frame size''&lt;/ref&gt; = 184 ''Mbits/sec'' * 3600 ''sec'' = 662,400 ''Mbits'' = 82,800 ''Mbytes'' = 82.8 '''''Gbytes'''''

The most important properties are ''bit rate'' and ''video size''. The formulas relating those two with all other properties are:

 BR = W * H * CD * FPS
 VS = BR * T = W * H * CD * FPS * T
 (units are: BR in bit/s, W and H in pixels, CD in bits, VS in bits, T in seconds)

while some secondary formulas are:
 ''pixels_per_frame'' = W * H
 ''pixels_per_second'' = W * H * FPS
 ''bits_per_frame'' = W * H * CD

===Interlacing===
In interlaced video each ''frame'' is composed of two ''halves of an image''. The first half contains only the odd-numbered lines of a full frame. The second half contains only the even-numbered lines. Those halves are referred to individually as ''fields''. Two consecutive fields compose a full frame. If an interlaced video has a frame rate of 15 frames per second the field rate is 30 fields per second. All the properties and formulas discussed here apply equally to interlaced video but one should be careful not to confuse the fields per second rate with the frames per second rate.

===Properties of compressed video===
The above are accurate for [[uncompressed video]]. Because of the relatively high bit rate of uncompressed video, [[video compression]] is extensively used. In the case of compressed video each frame requires a small percentage of the original bits. Assuming a [[compression algorithm]] that shrinks the input data by a factor of '''CF''', the bit rate and video size would equal to:

 BR = W * H * CD * FPS / CF
 VS = BR * T / CF

Note that it is not necessary that all frames are equally compressed by a factor of CF. In practice they are not, so CF is the ''average'' factor of compression for ''all'' the frames taken together.

The above equation for the bit rate can be rewritten by combining the compression factor and the color depth like this:

 BR = W * H * ( CD / CF ) * FPS

The value '''(CD / CF)''' represents the '''average bits per pixel (BPP)'''. As an example, if there is a color depth of 12 bits/pixel and an algorithm that compresses at 40x, then BPP equals 0.3 (12/40). So in the case of compressed video the formula for bit rate is:

 BR = W * H * BPP * FPS

The same formula is valid for uncompressed video because in that case one can assume that the "compression" factor is 1 and that the average bits per pixel equal the color depth.

===Bit rate and BPP===
By its definition, [[bit rate]] is a measure of the rate of information content of the digital video stream. In the case of uncompressed video, bit rate corresponds directly to the quality of the video. (Bit rate is proportional to every property that affects the [[video quality]].) Bit rate is an important property when transmitting video because the transmission link must be capable of supporting that bit rate. Bit rate is also important when dealing with the storage of video because, as shown above, the video size is proportional to the bit rate and the duration. Bit rate of uncompressed video is too high for most practical applications. [[Video compression]] is used to greatly reduce the bit rate. BPP is a measure of the efficiency of compression. A true-color video with no compression at all may have a BPP of 24 bits/pixel. [[Chroma subsampling]] can reduce the BPP to 16 or 12 bits/pixel. Applying [[jpeg]] compression on every frame can reduce the BPP to 8 or even 1 bits/pixel. Applying video compression algorithms like [[MPEG1]], [[MPEG2]] or [[MPEG4]] allows for fractional BPP values.

====Constant bit rate versus variable bit rate====
As noted above, BPP represents the ''average'' bits per pixel. There are compression algorithms that keep the BPP almost constant throughout the entire duration of the video. In this case, we also get video output with a [[Constant bitrate|constant bit rate (CBR)]]. This CBR video is suitable for real-time, non-buffered, fixed bandwidth video streaming (e.g. in videoconferencing). As not all frames can be compressed at the same level, because quality is more severely impacted for scenes of high complexity, some algorithms try to constantly adjust the BPP. They keep it high while compressing complex scenes and low for less demanding scenes. This way, one gets the best quality at the smallest average bit rate (and the smallest file size, accordingly). When using this method, the [[Variable Bit Rate|bit rate is variable]] because it tracks the variations of the BPP.

==Technical overview==

Standard [[film stock]]s such as [[16 mm film|16 mm]] and [[35 mm film|35 mm]] record at 24 [[frame rate|frames per second]]. For video, there are two frame rate standards: [[NTSC]], which shoot at 30/1.001 (about 29.97) frames per second or 59.94 fields per second, and [[PAL]], 25 frames per second or 50 fields per second. Digital video cameras come in two different image capture formats: [[Interlaced video|interlace]]d and deinterlaced / [[progressive scan]]. Interlaced cameras record the image in alternating sets of lines: the odd-numbered lines are scanned, and then the even-numbered lines are scanned, then the odd-numbered lines are scanned again, and so on. One set of odd or even lines is referred to as a "field", and a consecutive pairing of two fields of opposite parity is called a ''frame''. Deinterlaced cameras records each frame as distinct, with all scan lines being captured at the same moment in time. Thus, interlaced video captures samples the scene motion twice as often as progressive video does, for the same number of [[frame rate|frames per second]]. Progressive-scan camcorders generally produce a slightly sharper image. However, motion may not be as smooth as interlaced video which uses 50 or 59.94 fields per second, particularly if they employ the 24 frames per second standard of film.

Digital video can be copied with no degradation in quality. No matter how many generations of a digital source is copied, it will still be as clear as the original first generation of digital footage. However a change in parameters like frame size as well as a change of the digital format can decrease the quality of the video due to new calculations that have to be made. Digital video can be manipulated and edited to follow an order or sequence on an NLE, or [[non-linear editing]] workstation, a computer-based device intended to edit video and [[sound recording|audio]]. More and more, videos are edited on readily available, increasingly affordable consumer-grade computer hardware and software. However, such editing systems require ample disk space for video footage. The many video formats and parameters to be set make it quite impossible to come up with a specific number for how many minutes need how much time.

Digital video has a significantly lower cost than 35&amp;nbsp;mm film. In comparison to the high cost of [[film stock]], the tape stock (or other electronic media used for digital video recording, such as [[flash memory]] or [[hard disk drive]]) used for recording digital video is very inexpensive. Digital video also allows footage to be viewed on location without the expensive chemical processing required by film. Also physical deliveries of tapes and broadcasts do not apply anymore. [[Digital television]] (including higher quality [[High Definition Television|HDTV]]) started to spread in most developed countries in early 2000s. Digital video is also used in modern [[mobile phone]]s and [[Video teleconference|video conferencing]] systems. Digital video is also used for [[Internet]] distribution of media, including [[streaming video]] and [[peer-to-peer]] movie distribution. However even within Europe are lots of TV-Stations not broadcasting in HD, due to restricted budgets for new equipment for processing HD.

Many types of [[video compression]] exist for serving digital video over the internet and on optical disks. The file sizes of digital video used for professional editing are generally not practical for these purposes, and the video requires further compression with codecs such as Sorenson, H.264 and more recently Apple ProRes especially for HD. Probably the most widely used formats for delivering video over the internet are MPEG4, Quicktime, Flash and Windows Media, while MPEG2 is used almost exclusively for DVDs, providing an exceptional image in minimal size but resulting in a high level of CPU consumption to decompress.

{{As of|2011}}, the highest resolution demonstrated for digital video generation is 35 [[megapixel]]s (8192 x 4320). The highest speed is attained in industrial and scientific [[high speed camera]]s that are capable of filming 1024x1024 video at up to 1 million frames per second for brief periods of recording.

==Interfaces and cables==

Many interfaces have been designed specifically to handle the requirements of uncompressed digital video (from roughly 400 Mbit/s to 10 Gbit/s):

*[[HDMI|High-Definition Multimedia Interface]]
*[[Digital Visual Interface]]
*[[Serial Digital Interface]]
*[[DisplayPort]]
*[[Digital component video]]
*[[Unified Display Interface]]
*[[IEEE 1394|FireWire]]
*[[Universal Serial Bus|USB]]

The following interface has been designed for carrying [[Moving Picture Experts Group|MPEG]]-Transport compressed video:
* [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]]-[[Asynchronous serial communication|ASI]]
Compressed video is also carried using [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]]-[[Internet Protocol|IP]] over [[Ethernet]]. Two approaches exist for this:
* Using [[Real-time Transport Protocol|RTP]] as a wrapper for video packets
* 1-7 [[MPEG transport stream|MPEG Transport Packets]] are placed directly in the [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] packet

Alternative methods of carrying video over IP include:
* [[Network Device Interface]]

[[File:Boreal pine forest after fire.JPG|thumb|350px|Succession after [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]]: a [[boreal forest]] one year (left) and two years (right) after a [[wildfire]].]]

'''Ecological succession''' is the process of change in the [[species]] structure of an [[community (ecology)|ecological community]] over time. The time scale can be decades (for example, after a wildfire), or even millions of years after a [[mass extinction]].&lt;ref name="SahneyBenton2008"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/275/1636/759.full.pdf |author1=Sahney, S.  |author2=Benton, M.J. | year=2008 | title=Recovery from the most profound mass extinction of all time | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.1370 | volume = 275 | pages = 759–65|format=PDF | pmid=18198148 | issue=1636 | pmc=2596898}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The community begins with relatively few [[Pioneer species|pioneering plants and animals]] and develops through increasing complexity until it becomes stable or [[self-perpetuating]] as a [[climax community]]. The "engine" of succession, the cause of ecosystem change, is the impact of established species upon their own environments. A consequence of living is the sometimes subtle and sometimes overt alteration of one's own environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Virtual Nature Trail at Penn State New Kensington|url=http://www.psu.edu/dept/nkbiology/naturetrail/succession.htm|publisher=The Pennsylvania State University|accessdate=Oct 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a phenomenon or process by which an [[Community (ecology)|ecological community]] undergoes more or less orderly and predictable changes following a [[disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]] or the initial colonization of a new habitat. Succession may be initiated either by formation of new, unoccupied habitat, such as from a [[lava flow]] or a severe [[landslide]], or by some form of [[disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]] of a community, such as from a [[fire]], severe [[windthrow]], or [[logging]]. Succession that begins in new habitats, uninfluenced by pre-existing communities is called [[primary succession]], whereas succession that follows disruption of a pre-existing community is called [[secondary succession]].

Succession was among the first theories advanced in [[ecology]]. Ecological succession was first documented in the Indiana Dunes of Northwest Indiana and remains at the core of ecological science.&lt;ref name="southshorejournal.org"&gt;Smith, S. &amp; Mark, S. (2009). The Historical Roots of the Nature Conservancy in the Northwest Indiana/Chicagoland Region: From Science to Preservation. The South Shore Journal, 3. {{cite web|url=http://www.southshorejournal.org/index.php/issues/volume-3-2009/83-journals/vol-3-2009/75-the-historical-roots-of-the-nature-conservancy-in-the-northwest-indianachicagoland-region-from-science-to-preservation |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101021140/http://www.southshorejournal.org/index.php/issues/volume-3-2009/83-journals/vol-3-2009/75-the-historical-roots-of-the-nature-conservancy-in-the-northwest-indianachicagoland-region-from-science-to-preservation |archivedate=2016-01-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Precursors of the idea of ecological succession go back to the beginning of the 19th century. The French naturalist [[Adolphe Dureau de la Malle]] was the first to make use of the word ''succession'' concerning the vegetation development after forest clear-cutting. In 1859 [[Henry David Thoreau]] wrote an address called "The Succession of Forest Trees"&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/successionfores00thorgoog#page/n6/mode/2up The succession of forest trees, and wild apples]. Archive.org. Retrieved on 2014-04-12.&lt;/ref&gt; in which he described succession in an oak-pine forest. "It has long been known to observers that squirrels bury nuts in the ground, but I am not aware that any one has thus accounted for the regular succession of forests."&lt;ref&gt;Thoreau, H. D. (2013). Essays: A Fully Annotated Edition (J. S. Cramer, Ed.). New Haven, Connecticut: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The Austrian botanist [[Anton Kerner von Marilaun|Anton Kerner]] published a study about the succession of plants in the [[River Danube|Danube]] river basin in 1863.&lt;ref name=Bazzaz&gt;{{cite book|last=Bazzaz|first=F. A.|title=Plants in changing environments|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=UK|isbn=9 780521 398435|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===H. C. Cowles===
[[File:Indiana dunes.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The Indiana Dunes on Lake Michigan, which stimulated Cowles' development of his theories of ecological succession]][[Henry Chandler Cowles]], at the [[University of Chicago]], developed a more formal concept of succession. Inspired by studies of [[Denmark|Danish]] dunes by [[Eugen Warming]], Cowles studied [[vegetation]] development on sand dunes on the shores of [[Lake Michigan]] (the [[Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore|Indiana Dunes]]). He recognized that vegetation on dunes of different ages might be interpreted as different stages of a general trend of vegetation development on dunes (an approach to the study of vegetation change later termed space-for-time substitution, or [[chronosequence]] studies). He first published this work as a paper in the ''Botanical Gazette'' in 1899 ("The ecological relations of the vegetation of the sand dunes of Lake Michigan"). In this classic publication and subsequent papers, he formulated the idea of primary succession and the notion of a [[sere (ecology)|sere]]—a repeatable sequence of community changes specific to particular environmental circumstances.&lt;ref name="southshorejournal.org" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/news/henry-chandler-cowles/?ar_a=1 | title=Henry Chandler Cowles | publisher=National Geographic | accessdate=25 June 2014 | author=Schons, Mary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gleason and Clements===
From about 1900 to 1960, however, understanding of succession was dominated by the theories of [[Frederic Clements]], a contemporary of Cowles, who held that seres were highly predictable and deterministic and converged on a climatically determined stable [[climax (biology)|climax community]] regardless of starting conditions. Clements explicitly analogized the successional development of ecological communities with ontogenetic development of individual organisms, and his model is often referred to as the pseudo-organismic theory of community ecology. Clements and his followers developed a complex taxonomy of communities and successional pathways.

[[Henry Gleason]] offered a contrasting framework as early as the 1920s. The Gleasonian model was more complex and much less deterministic than the Clementsian. It differs most fundamentally from the Clementsian view in suggesting a much greater role of [[Stochastic process|chance factors]] and in denying the existence of coherent, sharply bounded community types. Gleason argued that species distributions responded individualistically to environmental factors, and communities were best regarded as artifacts of the juxtaposition of species distributions. Gleason's ideas, first published in 1926, were largely ignored until the late 1950s.

Two quotes illustrate the contrasting views of Clements and Gleason. Clements wrote in 1916:

{{quote|The developmental study of vegetation necessarily rests upon the assumption that the unit or climax formation is an organic entity. As an organism the formation arises, grows, matures, and dies. Furthermore, each climax formation is able to reproduce itself, repeating with essential fidelity the stages of its development.|Frederic Clements&lt;ref name=Clements&gt;Clements, Frederic E. (1916) ''Plant succession: an analysis of the development of vegetation''&lt;/ref&gt;}}
while Gleason, in his 1926 paper, said:
{{quote|An association is not an organism, scarcely even a vegetational unit, but merely a coincidence.|Henry Gleason&lt;ref&gt;Gleason, Henry A.(1926) The individualistic concept of the plant association. The Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Gleason's ideas were, in fact, more consistent with Cowles' original thinking about succession. About Clements' distinction between [[primary succession]] and [[secondary succession]], [[Henry Chandler Cowles|Cowles]] wrote (1911):

{{quote|This classification seems not to be of fundamental value, since it separates such closely related phenomena as those of erosion and deposition, and it places together such unlike things as human agencies and the subsidence of land.|Henry Cowles&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry C. Cowles|Cowles, Henry C.]] (1911) The causes of vegetational cycles. Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 1 (1): 3-20 [https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2560843]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Modern era===
A more rigorous, data-driven testing of successional models and community theory generally began with the work of [[Robert Whittaker]] and [[John Curtis (biologist)|John Curtis]] in the 1950s and 1960s. Succession theory has since become less monolithic and more complex. [[Connell–Slatyer model of ecological succession|J. Connell and R. Slatyer]] attempted a codification of successional processes by mechanism. Among British and North American ecologists, the notion of a stable [[climax vegetation]] has been largely abandoned, and successional processes have come to be seen as much less deterministic, with important roles for historical [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingency]] and for alternate pathways in the actual development of communities. Debates continue as to the general predictability of successional dynamics and the relative importance of equilibrial vs. non-equilibrial processes. Former Harvard professor F. A. Bazzaz introduced the notion of ''scale'' into the discussion, as he considered that at local or small area scale the processes are stochastic and patchy, but taking bigger regional areas into consideration, certain tendencies can not be denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bazzaz|first=F. A.|title=Plants in changing environments|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=UK|isbn=9 780521 398435|pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factors==

The trajectory of successional change can be influenced by site conditions, by the character of the events initiating succession (perturbations), by the interactions of the species present, and by more [[stochastic]] factors such as availability of colonists or seeds or [[weather]] conditions at the time of disturbance. Some of these factors contribute to predictability of succession dynamics; others add more [[probability|probabilistic]] elements. Two important perturbation factors today are [[Human impact on the environment|human actions]] and [[climatic change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bazzaz|first=F. A.|title=Plants in changing environments|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=UK|isbn=9 780521 398435|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, communities in early succession will be dominated by fast-growing, well-[[biological dispersal|dispersed]] species ([[opportunist]], [[fugitive]], or [[r-selected]] life-histories). As succession proceeds, these species will tend to be replaced by more competitive ([[k-selected]]) species.

Trends in [[ecosystem]] and community properties in succession have been suggested, but few appear to be general. For example, [[species diversity]] almost necessarily increases during early succession as new species arrive, but may decline in later succession as competition eliminates opportunistic species and leads to [[Competitive exclusion principle|dominance by locally superior competitors]]. [[Primary production|Net Primary Productivity]], [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]], and [[trophic level|trophic]] properties all show variable patterns over succession, depending on the particular system and site.

Ecological succession was formerly seen as having a stable end-stage called the [[Climax community|climax]], sometimes referred to as the 'potential vegetation' of a site, and shaped primarily by the local climate. This idea has been largely abandoned by modern ecologists in favor of nonequilibrium ideas of ecosystems dynamics. Most natural ecosystems experience disturbance at a rate that makes a "climax" community unattainable. [[Climate change]] often occurs at a rate and frequency sufficient to prevent arrival at a climax state. Additions to available species pools through range expansions and [[Introduced species|introductions]] can also continually reshape communities.

The development of some ecosystem attributes, such as [[pedogenesis|soil properties]] and [[nutrient cycles]], are both influenced by community properties, and, in turn, influence further successional development. This feed-back process may occur only over centuries or millennia. Coupled with the [[stochastic]] nature of disturbance events and other long-term (e.g., climatic) changes, such dynamics make it doubtful whether the 'climax' concept ever applies or is particularly useful in considering actual vegetation.

==Types==

===Primary, secondary and cyclic succession===
[[File:Secondary Succession.png|thumb|400px|An example of Secondary Succession by stages: &lt;br /&gt;
1. A stable deciduous forest community&lt;br /&gt;
2. A disturbance, such as a wild fire, destroys the forest&lt;br /&gt;
3. The fire burns the forest to the ground&lt;br /&gt;
4. The fire leaves behind empty, but not destroyed, soil&lt;br /&gt;
5. Grasses and other herbaceous plants grow back first&lt;br /&gt;
6. Small bushes and trees begin to colonize the area&lt;br /&gt;
7. Fast growing evergreen trees develop to their fullest, while shade-tolerant trees develop in the understory &lt;br /&gt;
8. The short-lived and shade intolerant evergreen trees die as the larger deciduous trees overtop them. The ecosystem is now back to a similar state to where it began.]]

{{main|Primary succession|Secondary succession|Cyclic succession}}
Successional dynamics beginning with colonization of an area that has not been previously occupied by an ecological community, such as newly exposed rock or sand surfaces, lava flows, newly exposed glacial tills, etc., are referred to as primary succession. The stages of primary succession include pioneer plants (lichens and mosses), grassy stage, smaller shrubs, and trees. Animals begin to return when there is food there for them to eat. When it is a fully functioning ecosystem, it has reached the climax community stage. For example, parts of [[Acadia National Park]] in Maine went through primary succession.
[[File:Secondary succesion cm01.jpg|thumb|left|''Secondary succession'': trees are colonizing uncultivated fields and meadows.]]

Successional dynamics following severe disturbance or removal of a pre-existing community are called secondary succession. Dynamics in secondary succession are strongly influenced by pre-disturbance conditions, including soil development, seed banks, remaining organic matter, and residual living organisms. Because of residual fertility and pre-existing organisms, community change in early stages of secondary succession can be relatively rapid. In a fragmented old field habitat created in eastern Kansas, woody plants "colonized more rapidly (per unit area) on large and nearby [[Landscape ecology#Patch and mosaic|patches]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Cook, W.M. |author2=Yao, J.|author3= Foster, B.L.|author4=Holt, R.D. |author5=Patrick, L.B.|title=Secondary succession in an experimentally fragmented landscape: Community patterns across space and time|url=http://naldc.nal.usda.gov/catalog/37947|publisher=The U.S. Department of Agriculture|accessdate=2013-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondary succession is much more commonly observed and studied than primary succession. Particularly common types of secondary succession include responses to natural disturbances such as fire, flood, and severe winds, and to human-caused disturbances such as logging and agriculture. As an example, secondary succession has been occurring in Shenandoah National Park following the 1995 flood of the Mormon River, which destroyed plant and animal life. Today, plant and animal species are beginning to return.

===Seasonal and cyclic dynamics===
Unlike secondary succession, these types of vegetation change are not dependent on [[disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]] but are periodic changes arising from fluctuating species interactions or recurring events. These models modify the [[climax community|climax concept]] towards one of dynamic states.

===Causes of plant succession===

[[Autogenic succession]] can be brought by changes in the soil caused by the organisms there. These changes include accumulation of organic matter in litter or humic layer, alteration of soil nutrients, or change in the pH of soil due to the plants growing there. The structure of the plants themselves can also alter the community. For example, when larger species like trees mature, they produce shade on to the developing forest floor that tends to exclude light-requiring species. Shade-tolerant species will invade the area.

[[Allogenic succession]] is caused by external environmental influences and not by the vegetation. For example, soil changes due to erosion, leaching or the deposition of silt and clays can alter the nutrient content and water relationships in the ecosystems. Animals also play an important role in allogenic changes as they are pollinators, seed dispersers and herbivores. They can also increase nutrient content of the soil in certain areas, or shift soil about (as termites, ants, and moles do) creating patches in the habitat. This may create regeneration sites that favor certain species.

Climatic factors may be very important, but on a much longer time-scale than any other. Changes in temperature and rainfall patterns will promote changes in communities. As the climate warmed at the end of each ice age, great successional changes took place. The tundra vegetation and bare glacial till deposits underwent succession to mixed deciduous forest. The greenhouse effect resulting in increase in temperature is likely to bring profound Allogenic changes in the next century. Geological and climatic catastrophes such as volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, avalanches, meteors, floods, fires, and high wind also bring allogenic changes.

===Mechanisms===

In 1916, [[Frederic Clements]] published a descriptive theory of succession and advanced it as a general ecological concept.&lt;ref name=Clements/&gt; His theory of succession had a powerful influence on ecological thought. Clements' concept is usually termed classical [[ecological theory]].
According to Clements, succession is a process involving several phases:&lt;ref name=Clements/&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2016}}

# Nudation: Succession begins with the development of a bare site, called Nudation (disturbance).&lt;ref name=Clements/&gt;
# Migration: It refers to arrival of [[propagule]]s.&lt;ref name=Clements/&gt;
# Ecesis: It involves establishment and initial growth of vegetation.&lt;ref name=Clements/&gt;
# Competition: As vegetation becomes well established, grow, and spread, various species begin to compete for space, light and nutrients.&lt;ref name=Clements/&gt;
# Reaction: During this phase autogenic changes such as the buildup of humus affect the habitat, and one plant community replaces another.&lt;ref name=Clements/&gt;
# Stabilization: A supposedly stable climax community forms.&lt;ref name=Clements/&gt;

==Seral communities==

[[File:Schleienloecher2-1- C.jpg|thumb|A [[hydrosere]] community]]

A seral community is an intermediate stage found in an ecosystem advancing towards its [[climax community]]. In many cases more than one seral stage evolves until climax conditions are attained.&lt;ref&gt;Michael G. Barbour and William Dwight Billings (2000) ''North American Terrestrial Vegetation'', Cambridge University Press, 708 pages {{ISBN|0-521-55986-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-55986-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''[[prisere]]'' is a collection of seres making up the development of an area from non-vegetated surfaces to a climax community. Depending on the substratum and climate, different seres are found.

==Changes in animal life==
Succession theory was developed primarily by botanists. The study of succession applied to whole [[ecosystems]] initiated in the writings of [[Ramon Margalef]], while [[Eugene Odum]]’s publication of ''The Strategy of Ecosystem Development'' is considered its formal starting point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bazzaz|first=F. A.|title=Plants in Changing Environments|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9 780521 398435|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animal life also exhibit changes with changing communities. In lichen stage the fauna is sparse. It comprises few mites, ants and spiders living in the cracks and crevices. The fauna undergoes a qualitative increase during herb grass stage. The animals found during this stage include nematodes, insects larvae, ants, spiders, mites, etc. The animal population increases and diversifies with the development of forest climax community. The fauna consists of invertebrates like slugs, snails, worms, millipedes, centipedes, ants, bugs; and vertebrates such as squirrels, foxes, mice, moles, snakes, various birds, salamanders and frogs.

==Microsuccession==

Succession of [[micro-organisms]] including [[fungi]] and [[bacteria]] occurring within a microhabitat is known as microsuccession or serule. This type of succession occurs in recently disturbed communities or newly available habitat, for example in recently dead trees, animal droppings, exposed glacial till, etc. Microbial communities may also change due to products secreted by the bacteria present. Changes of pH in a habitat could provide ideal conditions for a new species to inhabit the area. In some cases the new species may outcompete the present ones for nutrients leading to the primary species demise. Changes can also occur by microbial succession with variations in water availability and temperature. Theories of [[macroecology]] have only recently been applied to [[microbiology]] and so much remains to be understood about this growing field. A recent study of microbial succession evaluated the balances between [[stochastic]] and deterministic processes in the bacterial colonization of a salt marsh [[chronosequence]]. The results of this study show that, much like in macro succession, early colonization ([[primary succession]]) is mostly influenced by stochasticity while secondary succession of these bacterial communities was more strongly influenced by deterministic factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dini-Andreote |first1=Francisco |last2=Stegen |first2=James |last3=Dirk van Elsas |first3=Jan |last4=Falcão Salles |first4=Joana|title=Disentangling mechanisms that mediate the balance between stochastic and deterministic processes in microbial succession|journal=PNAS |date=17 March 2015 |volume=112 |issue=11 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/112/11/E1326 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1414261112|pmc=4371938 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climax concept==
According to classical [[ecological theory]], succession stops when the sere has arrived at an equilibrium or steady state with the physical and biotic environment. Barring major disturbances, it will persist indefinitely. This end point of succession is called climax.

===Climax community===
{{main|Climax community}}

The final or stable community in a sere is the ''climax community'' or ''climatic vegetation''. It is self-perpetuating and in equilibrium with the physical habitat. There is no net annual accumulation of organic matter in a climax community. The annual production and use of energy is balanced in such a community.

===Characteristics===

* The vegetation is tolerant of environmental conditions.
* It has a wide diversity of species, a well-drained spatial structure, and complex food chains.
* The climax ecosystem is balanced. There is equilibrium between [[gross primary production]] and total respiration, between energy used from sunlight and energy released by decomposition, between uptake of nutrients from the soil and the return of nutrient by litter fall to the soil.
* Individuals in the climax stage are replaced by others of the same kind. Thus the species composition maintains equilibrium.
* It is an index of the climate of the area. The life or growth forms indicate the climatic type.

===Types of climax===

; Climatic Climax: If there is only a single climax and the development of climax community is controlled by the climate of the region, it is termed as climatic climax. For example, development of Maple-beech climax community over moist soil. Climatic climax is theoretical and develops where physical conditions of the substrate are not so extreme as to modify the effects of the prevailing regional climate.
; Edaphic Climax: When there are more than one climax communities in the region, modified by local conditions of the substrate such as soil moisture, soil nutrients, topography, slope exposure, fire, and animal activity, it is called ''edaphic climax''. Succession ends in an edaphic climax where topography, soil, water, fire, or other disturbances are such that a climatic climax cannot develop.
; Catastrophic Climax: Climax vegetation vulnerable to a catastrophic event such as a wildfire. For example, in [[California]], [[chaparral]] vegetation is the final vegetation. The wildfire removes the mature vegetation and decomposers. A rapid development of herbaceous vegetation follows until the shrub dominance is re-established. This is known as catastrophic climax.
; Disclimax: When a stable community, which is not the climatic or edaphic climax for the given site, is maintained by man or his domestic animals, it is designated as Disclimax (disturbance climax) or anthropogenic subclimax (man-generated). For example, overgrazing by stock may produce a desert community of bushes and cacti where the local climate actually would allow grassland to maintain itself.
; Subclimax: The prolonged stage in succession just preceding the climatic climax is ''subclimax''.
; Preclimax and Postclimax: In certain areas different climax communities develop under similar climatic conditions. If the community has life forms lower than those in the expected climatic climax, it is called ''preclimax''; a community that has life forms higher than those in the expected climatic climax is ''postclimax''. Preclimax strips develop in less moist and hotter areas, whereas Postclimax strands develop in more moist and cooler areas than that of surrounding climate.

===Theories===

There are three schools of interpretations explaining the climax concept:

* Monoclimax or Climatic Climax Theory was advanced by [[Frederic Clements|Clements]] (1916) and recognizes only one climax whose characteristics are determined solely by climate (climatic climax). The processes of succession and modification of environment overcome the effects of differences in topography, parent material of the soil, and other factors. The whole area would be covered with uniform plant community. Communities other than the climax are related to it, and are recognized as subclimax, postclimax and disclimax.
* Polyclimax Theory was advanced by Tansley (1935). It proposes that the climax vegetation of a region consists of more than one vegetation climaxes controlled by soil moisture, soil nutrients, topography, slope exposure, fire, and animal activity.
* Climax Pattern Theory was proposed by Whittaker (1953). The climax pattern theory recognizes a variety of climaxes governed by responses of species populations to biotic and abiotic conditions. According to this theory the total environment of the ecosystem determines the composition, species structure, and balance of a climax community. The environment includes the species responses to moisture, temperature, and nutrients, their biotic relationships, availability of flora and fauna to colonize the area, chance dispersal of seeds and animals, soils, climate, and disturbance such as fire and wind. The nature of climax vegetation will change as the environment changes. The climax community represents a pattern of populations that corresponds to and changes with the pattern of environment. The central and most widespread community is the climatic climax.

The theory of [[alternative stable states]] suggests there is not one end point but many which transition between each other over ecological time.

==Forest succession==
[[File:Forest succession depicted over time.png|thumb|400px]]
The forests, being an ecological system, are subject to the species succession process.&lt;ref&gt;McEvoy, Thom, ''Positive Impact Forestry'', p 32 "Species Succession and Tolerance", Island Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; There are "opportunistic" or "pioneer" species that produce great quantities of seed that are disseminated by the wind, and therefore can colonize big empty extensions. They are capable of germinating and growing in direct sunlight. Once they have produced a ''[[closed canopy]]'', the lack of direct sun radiation at soil makes it difficult for their own seedlings to develop. It is then the opportunity for [[shade-tolerant]] species to become established under the protection of the pioneers. When the pioneers die, the shade-tolerant species replace them. These species are capable of growing beneath the canopy, and therefore, in the absence of catastrophes, will stay. For this reason it is then said the [[Stand level modelling|stand]] has reached its climax. When a catastrophe occurs, the opportunity for the pioneers opens up again, provided they are present or within a reasonable range.

An example of pioneer species, in forests of northeastern North America are ''Betula papyrifera'' ([[White birch]]) and ''Prunus serotina'' ([[Black cherry]]), that are particularly well-adapted to exploit large gaps in forest canopies, but are intolerant of shade and are eventually replaced by other [[shade-tolerant]] species in the absence of disturbances that create such gaps.

Things in nature are not black and white, and there are intermediate stages. It is therefore normal that between the two extremes of light and shade there is a gradient, and there are species that may act as pioneer or tolerant, depending on the circumstances. It is of paramount importance to know the tolerance of species in order to practice an effective [[silviculture]].

'''Endaural phenomena''' are [[sound]]s that are [[hearing (sense)|heard]] without any external [[acoustics|acoustic]] stimulation. Endaural means "in the [[ear]]". Phenomena include transient [[ringing (medicine)|ringing]] in the ears (that sound like [[sine tones]]), [[white noise]]-like sounds, and subjective [[tinnitus]]. Endaural phenomena need to be distinguished from [[otoacoustic emission]]s, in which a person's ear emits sounds. The emitter typically cannot hear the sounds made by his or her ear. Endaural phenomena also need to be distinguished from [[sound|auditory]] [[hallucination]]s, which are sometimes associated with [[psychosis]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9328">{{Contract law}}
An '''exclusion clause''' is a [[Contractual Term|term]] in a [[contract]] that seeks to restrict the rights of the parties to the [[contract]].

Traditionally, the district [[court]]s have sought to limit the operation of exclusion clauses. In addition to numerous [[common law]] rules limiting their operation, in [[England and Wales Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999]]. The [[Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977]] applies to all contracts, but the [[Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999]], unlike the [[common law]] rules, do differentiate between [[contract]]s between businesses and [[contract]]s between business and [[consumer]], so the [[law]] seems to explicitly recognize the greater possibility of exploitation of the [[consumer]] by businesses.

==Types of Exclusion Clause==
There are various methods by which a party may seek to exclude or mitigate liability by use of a contractual term:

* '''True exclusion clause:''' The clause recognizes a potential [[breach of contract]], and then excuses liability for the [[breach of contract|breach]]. Alternatively, the clause is constructed in such a way it only includes reasonable care to perform duties on one of the parties.
* '''Limitation clause:''' The clause places a limit on the amount that can be claimed for a [[breach of contract]], regardless of the actual loss.
* '''Time limitation:''' The clause states that an action for a claim must be commenced within a certain period of time or the cause of action becomes extinguished.

==Term Must be Incorporated==
The [[court]]s have traditionally held that exclusion clauses only operate if they are actually part of the [[contract]]. There seem to be three methods of incorporation:

* '''Incorporation by signature:''' according to ''[[L'Estrange v Graucob]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1934] 2 KB 394&lt;/ref&gt; if the clause is written on a document which has been signed by all parties, then it is part of the [[contract]]. If a document has not been signed, any exception clause which it contains will only be incorporated if the party relying on the clause (the 'proferens') can show that he took reasonable steps to bring it to the attention of the other party before the contract was made. In somewhat of a contradiction, that is not to say that the proferens actually has to show that the other person read the clause or understood it (except where the clause is particularly unusual or onerous). It is not even necessary to show that the attention of that particular person was actually drawn to it. It is somewhat like the 'reasonable man' test in tort: the party trying to rely on the clause needs to take reasonable steps to bring it to the attention of the reasonable person.
* '''Incorporation by notice:''' the general rule, as provided in ''[[Parker v SE Railway]]''&lt;ref&gt;(1877) 4 CPD 416&lt;/ref&gt; is that an exclusion clause will have been incorporated into the [[contract]] if the person relying on it took reasonable steps to draw it to the other parties' attention. ''[[Thornton v Shoe Lane Parking]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1971] 2 WLR 585&lt;/ref&gt; seems to indicate that the wider the clause, the more the party relying on it will have had to have done to bring it to the other parties' attention. The notice must be given before formation of the [[contract]] as illustrated in ''[[Olley v Marlborough Court Ltd]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[1949] 1 All ER 127&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Incorporation by previous course of dealings:''' according to ''[[McCutcheon v David MacBrayne Ltd]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1964] 1 WLR 125&lt;/ref&gt; terms (including exclusion clauses) may be incorporated into a [[contract]] if course of dealings between the parties were "regular and consistent". What this means usually depends on the facts, however, the [[court]]s have indicated that equality of bargaining power between the parties may be taken into account.

==Judicial Control of Exclusion Clauses==

===Strict Literal Interpretation===
For an exclusion clause to operate, it must cover the [[breach of contract|breach]] (assuming there actually is a breach of contract). If there is, then the type of liability arising is also important. Generally, there are two varieties of [[Legal liability|liability]]: [[strict liability]] (liability arising due to a state of affairs without the party at breach necessarily being at fault) and liability for [[negligence]] (liability arising due to fault).

The [[court]]s have a tendency of requiring the party relying on the clause to have drafted it properly so that it exempts them from the liability arising, and if any ambiguity is present, the courts usually interpret it strictly against the party relying on the clause.

As espoused in ''Darlington Futures Ltd v Delco Australia Pty Ltd'',&lt;ref&gt;(1986) 161 CLR 500&lt;/ref&gt; the meaning of an exclusion clause is construed in its ordinary and natural meaning in the context. Although we construe the meaning much like any other ordinary clause in the [[contract]], we need to examine the clause in light of the contract as a whole. Exclusion clauses should not be subject to a strained construction in order to reduce the ambit of their operation.&lt;ref&gt;[1986] HCA 82&lt;/ref&gt; The judge in ''[[R&amp;B Customs Brokers Co Ltd v United Dominions Trust Ltd]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1988] 1 All ER 847&lt;/ref&gt; refused to allow an exemption clause, of which did cover the nature of the [[implied term]], on the grounds that it did not make specific and explicit reference to that [[Contractual Term|term]].&lt;ref&gt;The term in question was the implied term as to fitness-to-purpose pursuant to the Sale of Goods Act 1979 s14(3).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contra Proferentem===
If, after attempting to construe an exclusion clause (or indeed any other contractual term) in accord with its ordinary and natural meaning of the words, there is still ambiguity then (if the clause was imposed by one party upon the other without negotiation) the [[contra proferentem]] rule applies. Essentially this means that the clause will be construed against the interests of the person who proposed its inclusion. that is to say, [[wiktionary:contra|''contra'']] (against) the [[wiktionary:proferens|''proferens'']] (proposer).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|82|1986|litigants=Darlington Futures Ltd v Delco Australia Pty Ltd |parallelcite=(1986) 161 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 500 |courtname=auto |date=16 December 1986}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Contractual Term|terms]] of [[negligence]], the [[court]]s have taken the approach that it is unlikely that someone would enter into a [[contract]] that allows the other party to evade fault based [[Legal liability|liability]]. As a result, if a party wishes exempt his liability for negligence, he must make sure that the other parties understand that. The decision in ''Canada SS Lines Ltd v. The King''&lt;ref&gt;[1952] AC 192&lt;/ref&gt; held that:
* If the exclusion clauses mention "negligence" explicitly, then liability for negligence is excluded.
* If "negligence" is not mentioned, then liability for negligence is excluded only if the words used in the exclusion clause are wide enough to exclude liability for negligence. If there is any ambiguity, then the contra proferentem rule applies.
* If a claim on another basis can be made other than that of negligence, then it covers that basis instead.

In [[Australia]], the ''four corners rule'' has been adopted in preference over the idea of a "fundamental breach".&lt;ref name="Sydney City Council v West"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|68|1965|litigants=Sydney City Council v West (Ticket case) |parallelcite=(1965) 114 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 481 |courtname=auto |date=16 December 1965}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The court will presume that parties to a contract will not exclude liability for losses arising from acts not authorised under the contract. However, if acts of negligence occur during authorised acts, then the exclusion clauses shall still apply;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|44|1954|litigants=Davis v Pearce Parking Station Pty Ltd}}: Clear words are necessary to exclude liability for negligence.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TNT v May &amp; Barker"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|46|1966|litigants=Thomas National Transport (Melbourne) Pty Ltd v May &amp; Baker (Australia) Pty Ltd |parallelcite=(1966) 115 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 353 |courtname=auto |date=10 August 1966}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

If the contract is for the carriage of goods, if the path is deviated from what was agreed, any exclusion clauses no longer apply.&lt;ref name="TNT v May &amp; Barker"/&gt;

In Australia, exclusion clauses have been recognised as valid by the High Court. They do not apply in cases of deliberate breach.

==Statutory Control==
Even if terms are incorporated into the [[contract]] and so would be effective, there are various statutory controls over the types of [[Contractual Term|term]]s that may have legal effect. The [[Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977]] renders many exemption clauses ineffective. The [[Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999]] provide further [[Consumer Protection|protection for consumers]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9530">The '''Financial Interest and Syndication Rules''', widely known as the '''fin-syn''' rules, were a set of rules imposed by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] in the [[United States]] in 1970. The FCC sought to prevent the [[Big Three television networks]] from monopolizing the broadcast landscape by preventing them from owning any of the programming that they aired in [[prime time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Business of Media: Corporate Media and the Public Interest|author=D. Croteau|author2=W. Hoynes|publisher=Pine Forge Press|location=[[Thousand Oaks, California]]|page=85|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rules also prohibited networks from airing [[broadcast syndication|syndicated programming]] they had a financial stake in. The rules changed the power relationships between networks and [[television producer]]s, who often had to agree to exorbitant profit participation in order to have their shows aired. Some argue the rules brought about a golden era of independent television production by companies such as [[MTM Enterprises]] (''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'') and [[Norman Lear]]'s [[Tandem Productions]] (''[[All in the Family]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Television Will Be Revolutionized|author=Amanda D. Lotz|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York City, New York|pages=85–86|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue the rules made the work of independent television production companies much more difficult because smaller companies could never afford the deficit financing required unless they received network assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE FINANCIAL INTEREST AND SYNDICATION RULES|url=http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode=financialint|author=Matthew McAllister|publisher=[[Museum of Broadcast Communications]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversial from the very beginning, the fin-syn rule was relaxed slightly during the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Business of Media: Corporate Media and the Public Interest|author=D. Croteau|author2=W. Hoynes|publisher=Pine Forge Press|location=[[Thousand Oaks, California]]|page=91|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the severe changes in the television landscape, such as the rise of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network and [[cable television]], the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules were abolished completely in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Business of Media: Corporate Media and the Public Interest|author=D. Croteau|author2=W. Hoynes|publisher=Pine Forge Press|location=Thousand Oaks, California|pages=100–101|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the repeal of fin-syn that ultimately made newer broadcast networks such as [[UPN]] and [[The WB]] financially interesting for their highly vertically integrated parent media conglomerates [[Paramount Pictures]] ([[Viacom (original)|Viacom]]) and [[Time Warner]], respectively.

On average, the number of shows that have been broadcast during prime time by the three main networks ([[CBS]], [[NBC]] and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]) per season has ranged between 63 and 75 shows between the 1987-88 and 2001-02 seasons. In the 1987-88 season, out of a total of 66 primetime shows that were broadcast, there were no such shows in which the network was either a producer or a co-producer. This number rose steadily to the point that during the 1992-93 season, there were about six shows out of a total of 67 shows produced or co-produced by the network; however as a result of the repeal of the fin-syn rules, this figure jumped to 11 the following year, whilst the total number of shows was barely 73. For the 2001-02 season, this figure rose to 20 shows that were network produced – a change from 0%, to 9%, to 15% and from there to 20% – over two decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=On Hollywood : the place, the industry|author=Allen J. Scott|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=[[Princeton, New Jersey]]|isbn=978-0-691-11683-9|page=66|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, each of the five major networks has an affiliated syndication company:
* [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] – [[Disney-ABC Domestic Television]]
* [[CBS]] – [[CBS Television Distribution]]
* [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] – [[20th Television]]
* [[NBC]] – [[NBCUniversal Television Distribution]]
* [[The CW]] – [[Warner Bros. Television Distribution]]/CBS Television Distribution

Closely related to fin-syn, the [[Prime Time Access Rule]] sought to strengthen local and independent producers by preventing [[network affiliate|affiliates]] from airing network programming during much of the early evening hours. This rule was eliminated on August 30, 1996.

==Deficit financing==
Before the fin-syn rules, the networks attained greater control and less risk by forcing [[production company|production companies]] to deficit finance their programs while also demanding a percentage of the syndication revenues.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} [[Deficit financing]] is an arrangement in which the network pays the studio that makes a show a [[Television licence|license fee]] in exchange for the right to air the program. The license fee is in exchange for the right to air an episode a few times (as a first-run and [[rerun]] episode), and does not cover the complete cost of production. The studio remains in ownership of the show. Before the fin-syn rules were established, networks would put into practice "profit participation." With this, they gained greater control and avoided the risks by forcing the production companies to deficit finance their programs. Such practice led multiple production companies into financial hardships. Independent producers and those not signed with major working studios were hit the hardest because most of the profit revenue went to the networks. Author [[Amanda D. Lotz]] explains in her book ''The Television Will Be Revolutionized'' that, by the mid-1960s, the networks gained as much as 91% of the programming revenue from profit participation. It was at that point that the government stepped in and got involved with the fin-syn rules in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Television Will Be Revolutionized|author=Amanda D. Lotz|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York City, New York|page=85|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deficit financing minimized the substantial risks and costs of developing programs for the networks while initially affording the studios considerable benefits as well. In successful cases, the studio receives a large return on its investment when it re-sells the show in a combination of syndication windows because the sales provide nearly pure profit: no additional work typically goes into the program and the network receives none of the payment.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} However, if the show is cancelled by the network before producing enough episodes to be syndicated, or if no syndication buyers want the show, the production company must absorb the difference between the cost of production and the original license fee, which can now amount to millions of dollars for each season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Television Will Be Revolutionized|author=Amanda D. Lotz|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York City, New York|pages=83–85|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2004}}, most [[reality television]] producers believe that deficit financing will never be financially viable because the vast majority of reality production companies are too small to wait long enough for the big payoff. Instead of syndication, producers have been covering gaps between license fees and rising production costs by selling shows' formats to foreign territories and developing integrated marketing deals with advertisers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reality Gets Reworked for Prime|author=Christopher Lisotta|periodical=Television Week|volume=23|issue=33|pages=40–41|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Television Will Be Revolutionized|author=Amanda D. Lotz|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York City, New York|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rule changes==
The fin-syn rules created two well-defined periods that might be considered characteristics of the [[multi-channel transition]]. First; rise of independent studios that provided a competitive environment. Second; [[The Walt Disney Company]], Viacom, [[News Corporation]] and Time Warner made purchases that combined studios and networks to create new kinds of corporate entities.

Throughout the 1970s into the mid-1990s, the fin-syn rules broke a few network-era norms that created programming well before the adjustments to the multi-channel transition. This also led to the creation of a fluid competitive environment between network and studios, however this did not last long.

In 1983, the FCC had received demands from the networks to end the fin-syn rules. In 1991, these had officially materialized, and the agency's commissioners voted to eliminate the rules in 1993. After the rules were eliminated, networks began populating their schedules with new shows purchased from studios owned by the network.

Throughout all this, the audience began to have more choices and control over entertainment options, and networks were pressured to offer fewer reruns to keep viewers' attention, leading networks to create programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Television Will Be Revolutionized|author=Amanda D.

'''Gail Hareven''' (born 1959 [[Jerusalem]]) is an [[Israelis|Israeli]] author.

==Biography==
Gail Hareven studied at [[Ben-Gurion University of the Negev]] and [[Shalom Hartman Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = http://www.ithl.org.il/page_13438|url = http://www.ithl.org.il/page_13438|website = www.ithl.org.il|access-date = 2016-02-03|last = BSmart}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Her work appears in [[The New Yorker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = The Slows|url = http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/05/04/the-slows|newspaper = The New Yorker|date = 2009-05-04|access-date = 2016-02-03|issn = 0028-792X|first = Gail|last = Hareven}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has published eleven books. In 2002, she was awarded the [[Sapir Prize for Literature]] for ''The Confessions of Noa Weber'', about the struggle between feminist ideology and yearning for love and spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forward.com/articles/103319/gail-hareven-s-confessional/ Gail Hareven’s Confessional]&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Confessions of Noa Weber'' is her first book translated into English.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/1933633689 The Confessions of Noa Weber]&lt;/ref&gt;
It won the 2009 [[Best Translated Book Award]] for the Hebrew to English translation by Dalya Bilu. According to one literary critic, "Hareven's insights into desperate yearning are so dead on and painfully astute, the experience can be eviscerating. That the work is also witty and compelling will leave American readers, encountering Hareven for the first time, almost certainly pining for more."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=102515201 'Confessions' Of A Woman Obsessed]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Hareven was an artist-in-residence at [[Mount Holyoke College]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtholyoke.edu/news/stories/5684080 MHC Hosts Renowned Author Gail Hareven ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = MHC Hosts Renowned Author Gail Hareven|url = https://www.mtholyoke.edu/media/mhc-hosts-renowned-author-gail-hareven|website = Mount Holyoke College|access-date = 2016-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gesamtbedeutung''' ([[German language|German]] for "general meaning", {{IPA-de|ɡəˈzamtbəˌdɔʏtʊŋ}}), in [[linguistics]], is the general meaning of the various uses of a [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] element. The Gesamtbedeutung of a language's [[past tense]], for instance, might be conceived as "distance from the present". This meaning might later be generalized to refer to events both temporally distant (e.g. ''the box was empty'') as well as separated in terms of reality or likelihood (e.g. ''the box might be empty'', ''if the box were empty...'', ''the box could be empty'', etc.)

In [[Japanese language|Japanese]], for example, the tense system has been  reduced to a system of "past", "non-past", and "probable", where the latter two tenses share the Gesamtbedeutung of abstraction from the real. The past tense refers to events which are complete and definite, whereas the non-past refers to virtually everything else, including present and future events. The probable tense functions in much the same way as the non-past, but with a stronger sense of separation from the present reality. 

For another example, consider the [[English language|English]] word endings "-ing" and "-er". Both share a Gesamtbedeutung of [[agent (grammar)|agency]] (as opposed to that of [[patient (grammar)|patienthood]], represented by such [[morpheme]]s as "-ed" and "-ee"). One who is ''driving'' is, by definition, a ''driver''. Though differing in grammatical function, these two morphemes share a common Gesamtbedeutung.

'''ILF Samanvay''', initiated by the [[India Habitat Centre]], is a one-of-its-kind Indian Languages Festival held annually in [[New Delhi]]. The first Samanvay was held in 2011.&lt;ref name="thehindu"&gt;{{citation |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/Edition-3-of-Samanvay-Indian-languages-festival-will-begin-from-Oct-24/articleshow/23823224.cms |title=Edition 3 of Samanvay Indian languages festival will begin from Oct 24 |publisher=The Hindu |date=9 October 2013 |accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ILF Samanvay was conceived in 2011 as an annual celebration of writing in Indian languages. The festival has aimed at generating dialogue across Indian languages at various levels and has emerged as the only literature festival dedicated exclusively to Indian languages.

==2011 inaugural==
The inaugural edition (2011) tried to explore the problem of bringing various literatures under the master signifier, "Indian" and the mysterious bond that makes these various literatures at once distinct and collective. In 2012, the festival moved on to highlight and discover the heritage of Indian languages through the strain of Boli, Baani, Bhasha:  Gaon, Kasba, Shehar.  Even in 2013 the theme Jodti Zubanein, Judti Zubanein: Language Connections aimed at -discussing the various kinds of dialogues across the 'regional' languages and their multifaceted interaction with the 'national' languages - Hindi and English. In 2014, Samanvay highlighted ‘Translation/Transnation’
focus on Indian languages which have a transnational presence.

The first four editions of the festival featured 20 languages presented by more than 150 Writers including some of the contemporary masters like [[Sitakant Mahapatra]], Ratan Thiyam, [[K. Satchidanandan]], [[Ashok Vajpeyi]], Sheen Kaaf Nizam, Girish Kasaravalli,
Udaya Narayana Singh, Nabarun Bhattacharya, Rajendra Yadav, Mangalesh Dabral,
Yumlembam Ibomcha, Arjun Deo Charan, Anupam 
Mishra, [[Gulzar]], [[Jerry Pinto]], [[Ketan Mehta]], [[Mahesh Bhatt]], Mukul Kesavan,
[[Piyush Mishra]], [[Ravish Kumar]], Sharada Sinha, Sanjay Kak, [[Shashi Deshpande]],
[[Kavita Krishnan]],  [[Vrinda Grover]], [[Kancha Ilaiah]],
[[Alok Rai]], K. Sivareddy, [[Manoranjan Byapari]], Nirupama Dutt, Rooprekha Verma,
Sylvanus Lamare, [[Tenzin Tsundue]], Viveka Rai Harrish Iyer, [[Namvar Singh]], [[Swanand Kirkire]],
Vinay Pathak, [[Arunava Sinha]] and [[Varun Grover]].

==Awards==
The festival bestows two major awards:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://ilfsamanvay.org/vision/ |title=Samanvay for India |accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://literaryjewels.wordpress.com/2011/12/18/samanvay-ihc-indian-languages-festival-2011 |title=Samanvay: IHC Indian Languages’ Festival, 2011 |accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The Vani-Samanvay Distinguished Translator Award
*The ILF ''Samanvay Bhasha Samman'' which is given to recognise the best book written in the last five years in any of the focal languages of the festival in any given year. This award was a lifetime achievement award till 2014, but was changed to a book award in 2015. Tamil Writer Perumal Murugan's Mathorubhagan (One Part Woman) has been named for the ILF Samanvay Bhasha Samman 2015. 
'''ILF Samanvay 2015: Insider/Outsider: Writing India's Dreams and Realities'''

This year from 26 to 29 November, '''India Habitat Centre (IHC)''' will celebrate the '''5thedition''' of its
'''Indian Languages Festival – Samanvay 2015'''. The festival, which has over the years become a must-attend for the Capital's Art &amp; Culture aficionados, has expanded its scope to engage a wider range of audience by bringing into its panels, multi-level interpretations of the central theme,  '''‘Insider/Outsider: Writing India’s Dreams and Realities’.''' The languages that will be explored in detail at ILF Samanvay. 2015 languages are Tamil, Bangla, Marathi and Dogri.

==Overall design and logo==

Amid rampant instability of thought and violence infecting communication, ILF ''Samanvay'' aspires
to thrive as a space for relevant reflection and uninhibited celebration of the inherent companionship of Indian linguistic cultures. Its overall design, including that of all its intellectual, physical and virtual sites, thus evokes India's cultural destiny vis-à-vis its multiple political aspirations on the one hand and the future of humanity at large on the other. Hence, the festival design reflects the concerns and responsibility of the Indian writers, artists and other creative thinkers towards creating a condition and environment to bring the multi-centred country into a cultural camaraderie rather than any attempt
at homogenisation.

The ILF Samanvay logo is the visual embodiment of the above design concept. While the curious
interweaving of straight lines and curves in the scripting of the term ‘Samanvay’ has from its inception reflected the continuum of tradition and modernity that the festival emphasises, it is branded as ILF Samanvay in its fifth year, considering its one-of-its-kind status in the country as a festival bringing Indian languages together. ''The revised logo marks the directional integrity in the organisation of the festival.''

==Riyas Komu==
Artist Riyas Komu who conceptualised the new visual expression of the ILF Samanvay logo says: "In our times characterized by fragile thoughts and volatile expressions, an Indian languages festival such as ''Samanvay'' must live and present itself as a profound space for thinking. It must be a site to reflect on the past, present and future of humanity and nature at large. Hence, the attempt here has been to create a ''head space'' that represents the thoughtscape embedded in Indian languages.  Again, as we need an insignia for thinkers who can make relevant changes, the red dot becomes the mark of  that awareness.  The seven colours of the spectrum, capable of forming white light on their merger, are laid in a seed form in the line above the lettering of Samanvay in the logo. Another indication of the 'coming together' inherent in the festival, this linear mandala also  intimates one of the possibility of playing with each of these colours in specific contexts within the frame of the festival."

The festival will open with Education Thinker, Prof. Aijaz Ahmad discussing the possibility of evolving a methodology for language and literary studies in the country. Prof. Ahmad's  inaugural lecture, ‘'''The Languages  of a Union’''', will highlight how in India, political unity does not automatically give us, or requires of us, literary or linguistic unity. He would discuss the significance of examining  the hierarchical relations existing among languages and traditions, and the need to develop a system of education that profoundly addresses the question of multilingualism.

==2015==
The deliberations at Samanvay 2015 will unfold with a session paying tributes to the late '''RK Laxman and his matchless legacy'''. Cartoonist Unny, Outlook Chief Editor Krishna Prasad, and cartoon researcher and writer, Christel Devadawson will together unravel the complex field of Indian cartooning while looking at Laxman's unique contribution to shaping its sensibilities. This session on the opening evening will lead the discourse of ‘Insider/Outsider’ forward into the main festival sessions.

The central theme of Samanvay 2015, '''Insider/Outsider''': '''Writing India's Dreams and Realities,'''
evokes the liminality of the writer/creative artist/inventor in a given context. A creative act necessitates an individual to move out of a certain state of being, into an experimental space where she has to play out her ideas and desires into comprehensible forms. This transition makes every writer a liminal
being, an '''insider/outsider'''. Yet, some writers and artists become more of insiders and some others more of outsiders to the existing patterns. The subtitle suggests how writers who understand the in-between space of uncertainty, the transitory status that makes one neither here nor there, bring out the dreams and realities of a complex space such as India. It also points to the need for an artist to remain
tentative, and resist fixities.

Day 2 of Samanvay will focus on a thematic exploration of '''‘Insider/Outsider’''' in the contemporary socio-political and cultural context of India. Day 3 will feature sessions on the focal languages of Samanvay 2015, and Day 4 will attempt to expand the theme with the futuristic vision which the festival embodies.

Various workshops, volunteer sessions, conversations, book exhibitions and performances will also be an integral part of Samanvay 2015. Its democratic and inclusive spirit gets amply reflected in a special session on Day 2, which is completely designed by the student volunteers of Samanvay. This one-hour session titled '''Inside the Exile''' will feature readings by Tibetan writers followed by a Q&amp;A to explore the Insider/Outsider aspects of being Tibetans in India. This session, among others, has ensured more youth participation in the organization of the festival. At Samanvay, the workshop sessions are not supplementary but are integral to the exploration of languages outside of the verbal realm, too. On
Day 3, a translation workshop has been planned with exercises that would lead to a publication. Avadhesh Kumar Singh, Dean of School of Translation Studies at IGNOU will be in charge of this.

==2015 summary==
Spread over four days with multiple events, ILF Samanvay 2015 will ensure that the theme is carried on to extra-literary and epistemic fields too. The sessions concerning the child's position vis-a-vis writing and publishing in the country; gender and sexuality; media and language; the architectural, ecological and cultural continuities and discontinuities that make the city of Delhi etc. are cases in point. The Art Appreciation workshop by the renowned cultural critic Sadanand Menon is a major value addition in this regard.

Talking about the festival, '''Rakesh Kacker, Festival Director Samanvay &amp; Director - India Habitat Centre''' , says, “One does not necessarily have to recognise language as a basic instinct to properly appreciate its role as an organic part of human existence. Civilizations have been formed and continue to take shape around languages, uniting and dividing in swift strokes. This, precisely, is the theme we would explore in India Habitat Centre’s fifth annual Indian Languages’ Festival, Samanvay. In an increasingly globalised world the alienation that writers often face for their lingual and cultural choices is now a much hackneyed subject in the area of literary discourse. Here at Samanvay, we invite you to partake in the discussions that would take this conversation one step forward.”

Elaborating further, '''Rizio Yohannan Raj,''' Creative Director, ILF Samanvay says, ''“Samanvay'' is a relevant call to reawaken the Indian genius for cultural cooperation in our times. A dynamic yet nuanced
initiative to facilitate genuine camaraderie at the intersections of Indian languages, the festival celebrates the diversities embedded in the transnational matrix of the country. Through multiple verbal as well as transverbal media, and various modes of translation, ''Samanvay'' interprets ''Indian Languages'' beyond ''word-limits'' and explores the socio-historical connections among the idioms of literature, visual arts, music, performance. Towards fulfilling this larger vision of creativity and
institutionalising its enterprise, ''Samanvay’s'' inclusive framework presents workshops, freewheeling conversations, focussed discussions, public readings, exhibitions, performances. The festival theme for
2015, “Insider/Outsider: Writing India’s Dreams and Realities” emphasises the liminality of the creative individual in any given context, and all the sessions explore this notion quite intensely, thus lending the festival an organic as well as sustainable design.”

== AWARDS ==

'''ILF Samanvay Bhasha Samman 2015'''

Tamil writer Peruman Murugan's novel '''''Madhorubhagan''''' has bagged the fourth ''ILF Samanvay Bhasha Samman'', the prestigious annual award instituted by the IHC Indian Languages Festival Samanvay.  The award for 2015 was decided by an eminent jury chaired by K. Satchidanandan, and included as its other members  Sachin Ketkar, Manglesh Dabral, Mitra Phukan and Arundhati Subramaniam. The Jury selected ''Madhorubhagan'' after a detailed process of inviting nominations from five focal languages of ILF Samanvay 2015– Tamil, Marathi, Bangla, Dogri and Mizo. These nominations were then screened by the Award Advisors and a final selection was made by the Jury from the final
shortlist.

Jury Chair K Satchidanandan says:

"Perual Murugan's ''Madhorubhagan'' (One Part Woman) is a rooted and passionate work of fiction that narrates with searing intensity and unsparing clarity the story  of  a relationship caught between the dictates of social convention and the tug of personal anxieties. This historian of the Kongu region of Tamilnadu has brought into play his lyrical imagination, linguistic skill and  lexical knowledge in this honest exploration of the tyranny of caste and the pathology of a community.  Inspired by local folklore and history, this great work of fiction dreams of a secular future for communities in India that remain hostage to the ways of the past. It is an imaginative contribution by a versatile writer and scholar to the collective struggle for a new India free from the oppression of caste and enslaving conventions."

Responding to the award announcement Perumal Murugan gave this statement:

{{quote|''The Samanvay Award for Madhorubhagan is a modern recognition given to Tamil, a classical language with a long and unbroken literary tradition. This recognition, bestowed on my language at an unfortunate moment, will, I hope, be a shining gem rather than an unsightly wart. I wholeheartedly thank everyone who made this possible. Constrained by force of circumstance to act as the shadow of Perumal Murugan, I feel honoured by this award. I dedicate the Samanvay Award to the lotus feet of the almighty lord Madhorubhagan.''|P. Murugan, 27 Sep. 2015}}

The IHC Director who is also the Festival Director of ILF Samanvay says: ‘It gives the IHC great pleasure to announce the ILF Samanvay Bhasha Samman for Perumal Murugan. The Tamil literary canon has been expanded with the induction of the series of novels and short stories that Perumal Murugan has written. ''Madhorubhagan'' occupies pride of place in this canon. This award for ''Madhorubhagan''  is a recognition of how a writer and his insider-outsider act of writing could serve the society and connect its histories with its contemporary realities and dreams.”

Perumal Murugan is a well-known Tamil writer and poet. He has written nine novels and four
collections each of short stories and poetry. Three of his novels have  been translated into English to wide critical acclaim: ''Seasons of the Palm,'' which was shortlisted for the prestigious Kiriyama Prize in 2005, ''Current Show'' and ''One part  woman.'' He has received awards from the Tamil Nadu government as well as from Katha Books.

The ''ILF Samanvay Bhasha Samman'' has undergone a makeover this year. Till last year, named Samanvay Bhasha Samman, this honour was bestowed on an eminent writer who had contributed significantly to the growth of one or more Indian languages. Last year, the third Samanvay Bhasha Samman 2014 was conferred upon [[Ashok Vajpeyi]], the well-known author, scholar, critic and poet for his lifelong contribution to Hindi Literature in particular and Indian Literature in general. The second Samanvay Bhasha Samman 2013 was conferred upon veteran  Gujarati  author Chandrakant  Topiwala  for "his lifetime contribution to  Gujarati and Indian literature; for his commitment for independence and objectivity in cultural life; for standing against the authoritarian forces in contemporary Indian society and broadening the scope of human empathy through an extraordinary body of work."

The inaugural award in 2012 had been conferred upon the legendary Odiya writer Sitakant Mahapatra for "his lifetime contribution to Odiya and Indian literature; for extraordinary efforts in generating dialogue across Indian languages through creative and administrative activism, for emancipation of dialects and oral traditions and for unrelenting advocacy of plurality of idea and expression."

==Fifth year==
In this fifth year of India Habit Centre's Indian Languages Festival Samanvay, as part of the rethinking of the festival as a significant and enduring space to facilitate growth, development of connections of Indian languages in the contemporary times,  it was decided that every year, an important literary work in one of the focal languages of the festival, should be given the award, as such a scheme is more aligned to the vision and mission of the ILF Samanvay. Hence, the Award has been named ILF Samanvay Bhasha Samman, and from a cluster of five languages from the five regions of the country—Tamil, Bangla, Dogri, Marathi and Mizo— nominations were called from a large panel of publishers, academicians, critics/writers. Works—Poetry Fiction Creative non-fiction; e.g. Autobiographies, Travelogues, Memoirs, etc.—published in the last 5 years in these languages were considered. To begin the process, each language's advisers suggested 5 critics/writers, 5 academicians, and 5 publishers who sent in their nominations in an elaborate format prepared for this purpose. Each nominator sent 3 nominations, and filled up the questionnaire  in justification of the nomination.

Criteria for nominations specified that the book should:

i) Preferably have been translated in any other Indian Language. This criterion, however, is NOT mandatory.

ii) Have been published between Jan 2010—Dec 2014.

iii) Be considered significant in the particular language.

iv) Have brought a breakthrough in the literary scenario of that particular language.

v) Have extended the frontiers of language and style vi) be not just commercial but aesthetically rich.

vi) Have some social and/or literary substance to it.

vii) Challenge established norms.

viii) Have brought a shift in the canon.

ix) Have made a considerable impact on the language it has been written in.

x) The advisers are free to add books over and above the nominations received per language.

===Shortlisting===

The advisers of Bangla, Dogri, Marathi and Tamil shortlisted 2 books per language. Though nominations were received from Mizo, the advisors did not recommend any for the award. Each panel of advisors of the four languages prepared a critical justification for the members of the jury explaining their choice for the 2 books shortlisted. From among these 8 nominations the jury members chose Perumal Murugan's ''Madhorubhagan''.

== Vani-Samanvay Distinguished Translator Award ==

The commitment of ILF Samanvay to the development of a democracy of Indian languages 
is asserted by the announcement of a major Award for a distinguished translator, and a couple of interesting prizes for young writers.  In the wake of Tamil Writer Peruman Murugan's novel '''''Madhorubhagan''''' (One Part Woman) bagging the fourth ''ILF Samanvay Bhasha Samman'', the festival organisers have announced yet another much-awaited and relevant annual award which ILF Samanvay has instituted in collaboration with Vani Foundation: '''Vani-Samanvay Distinguished Translator Award.'''

Scheduled from 26 to 29 November 2015, ILF Samanvay 2015 has expanded its scope to engage a wider section of the society.  It is as part of enlarging its mandate that a national level award for a distinguished translator who has contributed in a sustained and quality manner towards direct
exchanges between two Indian languages, has been instituted. This award will be given as part of the activities initiated by ILF Samanvay every year. The India Habitat Centre and Vani Foundation have jointly conceptualised this award in view of the lack of recognitions encouraging direct exchanges between Indian languages without a mediating language. This award is hoped to encourage contemporary translators in the linguistically diverse sub-continent with a rich history of literary
exchange.

The award is worth INR 1,00,000 (Rupees One lakh) and as far as possible this award will consider translators directly translating between two Indian languages and have sustained this activity for a
considerable period of time and produced a remarkable body of work. The jury of the award include writers Namita Gokhale, Ashok Vajpeyi, Rizio Yohannan Raj, IHC Programmes Director Vidyun Singh, NBT Director and writer Rita Choudhury, and writer-scholar Rita Kothari.

Announcing the institution of Vani-Samanvay Distinguished Translator Award, the Director
of India Habitat Centre, Rakesh Kacker said: "I am delighted that this award has fructified in a very short period. Thanks and Congratulations to all who have made this happen. The addition of this award to ILF Samanvay's range of activities will help to enrich the festival and its institutional mission.  It would also strengthen the important work of translation and help different linguistic groups in the country to communicate meaningfully with one another."

Arun Maheshwari, the Chairman of Vani Foundation, that has co-founded the Award, said on the occasion: "Our country's rich cultural diversity and its expression into arts and literature have been
largely unexplored. Vani Foundation was established with the mission of not only re-discovering these idioms, but also connecting Indian languages with one another and with the world. We found congruence of energy and vision with the new team at ILF ''Samanvay'' and
therefore feel proud to announce ''Vani-Samanvay Distinguished Translator Awa''rd. The award is committed to celebrate the unsung heroes of Indian translation fraternity, especially those who have
tirelessly dedicated themselves to not only translating between two languages, but also bridging two cultures."

The Vani-Samanvay Distinguished Translator award is in keeping with the great emphasis ILF Samanvay has laid on translation this year. The festival has initiated a collaborative translation project with the School of Translation Studies and Training, IGNOU, besides three festival panels dedicated exclusively to look at various issues concerning translation in the county.

==Poetry contest==

===HIR-PITHARA youth poetry contest===

As part of expanding its mandate, and reaching out to nurture the creativity of the young speakers of different Indian languages in the Delhi-NCR region, ILF Samanvay has also announced an interesting  youth poetry contest as part of the festival: The HIR-PITHARA YOUTH POETRY CONTEST. The mascot of this poetry contest is the resplendent figure of HIR—the ageless, androgynous, itinerant storyteller.(Mascot attached)

Speaking of Hir, Rizio Yohannan Raj, Creative Director of ILF Samanvay said: "Hir (Pronounced ‘heer’) is a quintessential ''insider-outsider'', true to the time and the theme-zone wherein hir arrives at ILF Samanvay in Delhi. Hir is a child-adult of the future, and begins hir travel mid-way, in classic medias
res, at ILF Samanvay. Hir is pronoun and noun at once; Hir is a child's self-expression as well as an adult's quest for meaning. Hir represents the ‘samanvay’ of the self and the other in our fragmented times. Red-robed, Hir is the self-same heart of pure revolution and ardent love. In the coming days, we shall see Hir extending travel from Delhi to different time zones, varied spacescapes, carrying hir
‘Pithara’ , gathering creative voices from among the young and the young at heart of the country. Inspired by the 9-year old Adel Tushar Kumar's uninhibited painting of a storyteller, Hir is given hir current form by the ILF Samanvay team. Hir Stories are going to be a regular feature of Y'': The ILF Samanvay Blog.''"

ILF Samanvay 2015 invites poetry submissions for the HIR-PITHARA poetry contest 2015 in all Indian languages. One can submit any number of poems in one’s original language, on the theme
"Insider/Outsider’.  The length of poem has to be limited to one A4 size page, and has to be separately submitted in the specified format, along with a translation in either English or Hindi.

This journey of Hir in the context of IL F Samanvay through the historical city of Delhi is to map, mainstream and celebrate Delhi's hidden pockets of creativity.  Poetry submissions can either be made online in the requisite format available on www.ilfsamanvay.org or dropped at the ''Hir-Pitharas'' (Poetry bags) kept  at the IHC campus in Lodhi Road and in select locations. The hard copy submission must mark the name, age, address and affiliation of the participant. Details will be available online at
the ILF Samanvay website from Tuesday, 20 October.

The last date of submission is 5 Nov 2015. Seven poets from different languages will be selected and they will be invited to read their prize-winning entry at the theme session of ILF Samanvay 2015 on 27 Nov 2015 evening, along with senior poets from different languages.

ILF Samanvay invites young people in the city to write poetry in their own languages and reclaim the lost vitality of a region that inspired many a poet and artist to make monumental works of beauty for
generations to cherish.

Announcement of winners: 18 November

The '''Iwaidjan''' or '''Yiwaidjan languages''' are a small [[language families|family]] of [[non-Pama–Nyungan]] [[Australian Aboriginal languages]] spoken in the [[Cobourg Peninsula]] region of Western [[Arnhem Land]].

In 1997 [[Nicholas Evans (linguist)|Nicholas Evans]] proposed an [[Arnhem Land languages|Arnhem Land family]] that includes the Iwaidjan languages, though their inclusion is not accepted in Bowern (2011).&lt;ref&gt;Bowern, Claire. 2011. ''[http://anggarrgoon.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/austlangs-masterlanguagelist-dec2011.xlsx How Many Languages Were Spoken in Australia?]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Garig and Ilgar are two almost identical dialects.&lt;ref&gt;Evans (1998): pp. 115, 144.&lt;/ref&gt; Manangkari may be a dialect of Maung.&lt;ref&gt;Evans (1998): pp. 115–116.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dixon (2002) considers Warrkbi demonstrated, but Iwaidjic (Warrkbi-Maung) and Iwaidjan to be speculative. He predicts that working out the histories of the languages will be a "profound challenge", regardless of whether they are a genealogical family or a language area.

[[Marrgu language|Marrgu]] and [[Wurrugu language|Wurrugu]], previously lumped in with Iwaidjan, have little in common with it and may turn out to be a separate family.

==Status==
Iwaidja is spoken by about 150 people in the community of [[Minjilang]] on [[Croker Island]],&lt;ref name="e115"&gt;Evans (1998): p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; alongside [[English language|English]], [[Kunwinjku language|Kunwinjku]] and Maung.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Maung is primarily spoken in the community of [[Warruwi]] on [[Goulburn Island]], and it too has about 150 speakers.&lt;ref name="e115"/&gt; Both languages are still being learnt by children.&lt;ref name="e115"/&gt;

All the other Iwaidjan languages are close to [[language death|extinction]]. {{As of|1998|alt=In 1998}}, Amurdak had three remaining speakers, Garig and Ilgar three speakers between them.&lt;ref name="e115"/&gt;

Maung lacks the two [[flap consonant|flapped]] [[lateral consonant|laterals]],&lt;ref name="e118"&gt;Evans (1998): p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; which are quite unusual among Australian languages. Also unusual is the [[velar consonant|velar]] [[approximant consonant|approximant]] {{IPA|/ɰ/}}, which is an areal feature shared with [[Tiwi language|Tiwi]] and [[Kunbarlang language|Kunbarlang]].&lt;ref&gt;Evans (1998): p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

The vocabularies of all the Iwaidjan languages contain [[loanword]]s from [[Macassarese language|Macassarese]] and [[Malay language|Malay]],&lt;ref name="e116"&gt;Evans (1998): p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; both [[Malayo-Polynesian languages]] from [[Indonesia]]. Iwaidja and Maung have also borrowed heavily from [[Kunwinjku language|Kunwijku]],&lt;ref name="e116"/&gt; another Australian language of the [[Gunwingguan languages|Gunwingguan]] family.

While the Iwaidjan languages share a number of features with other non-Pama–Nyungan language families, it is uncertain which they are closest related to.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Ross has proposed that they form part of an [[Arnhem Land languages|Arnhem Land family]].

'''Joan Margaret Marbeck''' (born 26 June 1944, [[Malacca City]], [[Malaysia]]), a Malaysian scholar specializing in the study of [[Portuguese-based creole languages | Malay-Portuguese Creole language]] [[Kristang language| Kristang]]  in Malaysia and other countries ([[Singapore]], [[Australia]], [[Macau]]).

== Biography ==
She received a pedagogical education. In the years 1965-1990, she used to work in a number of schools and colleges in Malaysia.

She takes active measures to revive Kristang. She lectures on Kristang at the invitation of a number of world universities and public organizations ([[Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro]], 1997, Eurasian Association in Singapore, 2011; [[University of Malaya]], 2014) &lt;ref&gt;"Sharing our History". - "The new Eurosian", January-March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;. She publishes dictionaries and phrase books, translates poetry and songs into this language, tries to introduce  Kristang to be studied  in primary schools in places where the Creole population lives, especially in Malacca &lt;ref&gt; "Championing Kristang" - "The New Sunday Times", 12 Sept 2004&lt;/ref&gt;.

She was an organizer of the conference "On the Conservation and Development of the Malayo-Portuguese Creole Language and Heritage in Malaysia" (January 1996), the initiator of the establishment in 2010 a department of the life of the Eurasian community in the Peoples Museum Melaka&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.malaysia-traveller.com/peoples-museum-melaka.html |title=Peoples Museum Melaka - Muzium Rakyat |publisher=Malaysia-traveller.com |date=2018-08-08 |accessdate=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the holding of a seminar on Kristang in cooperation with the Corporation of Malacca Museums in December 2011 and the International Conference on Creole Languages in June 2012 in Malacca (in cooperation with the [[Federal University of Rio de Janeiro]]).
  
In conjunction with the 500th anniversary of the conquest of Malacca by Portuguese (1511) she produced and published in 2012 a set of three books: "The Commemorative Dictionary of Serani", "Speak Serani" and "Serani Songs". Earlier, Kristang was called Serani, and Joan Marbeck believes that it is necessary to return that name. In Kuala Lumpur, in 2014, she opened courses to study the Kristang.{{fact|date=December 2018}}

Having musical education, he writes musicals too. In 1994, she was invited to write and stage the musical "Saint [[Francis Xavier]] - the main saint of India" in conjunction with the centenary of the [[Church of St. Francis Xavier (Melaka)| Church of St. Francis Xavier]] in Malacca &lt;ref&gt;Anthea de Lima. "Crusader for Kristang". - "Her World", October, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2009, she wrote and presented to the competition of the Lusophone Festival in Macau a monoplay in Kristang 'Seng Marianne' (Without Marianne). In December 2010, in Kuala Lumpur with the sponsorship of the Brazilian Embassy, her musical "Kazamintu na Praiya" (A Wedding on the Beach) in Kristang was staged &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/lifestyle/features/2011/11/27/mind-your-language/|title=Mind your language - Features - The Star Online|website=www.thestar.com.my|accessdate=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''languages of the [[African Union]]''' are [[language]]s used by citizens within the [[member states of the African Union]] (AU). For languages of the institution, see [[African Union#Languages|African Union: Languages]].

==Overview==
The African Union has defined a number of languages as working languages including [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] as well as [[Languages of Africa|African languages]] if possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.au.int/en/sites/default/files/ConstitutiveAct_EN.pdf |title=Constitutive Act of the African Union |publisher=African Union |format=PDF |accessdate=4 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130706133134/http://www.au.int/en/sites/default/files/ConstitutiveAct_EN.pdf |archivedate=6 July 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The prominence of Arabic in many African countries is due to the [[Muslim conquest of the Maghreb|Arab expansion into Africa]] from the 7th century, with subsequent [[Arabization]] of local populations. [[Indo-European languages]] were introduced during the [[Colonisation of Africa|European colonisation]] from the 15th century. 

In 2001, the AU created the [[African Academy of Languages]] (ACALAN) to [[Language policy|harmonize the various languages]] across the continent and [[Language revival|safeguard]] any that are on the verge of becoming [[extinct language|extinct]]. To that end, the AU declared 2006 the Year of African Languages.&lt;ref name="Year of African Languages"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200606210733.html |title=Ethiopia: AU Launches 2006 As Year of African Languages |accessdate=2006-09-30 |year=2006 |publisher=AllAfrica.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Year of African Languages 2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.uct.ac.za/depts/praesa/YoAL.htm |title=The Year of African Languages (2006) - Plan for the year of African Languages - Executive Summary |accessdate=2006-09-30 |author=Project for the Study of Alternative Education in South Africa |year=2006 |publisher=Project for the Study of Alternative Education in South Africa |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20060923084909/http://web.uct.ac.za/depts/praesa/YoAL.htm |archivedate=2006-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 2006 also marked Ghana's 55th anniversary since it founded the [[Bureau of Ghana Languages]] originally known as [[Bureau of Ghana Languages|Gold Coast Vernacular Literature Bureau]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35982">This is a partial list of [[loanwords]] in [[English language]], that were borrowed or derived, either directly or indirectly, from [[Malay language]]. Many of the words are decisively Malay or shared with other [[Malayan languages]] group, while others obviously entered Malay both from related [[Austronesian languages]] and unrelated languages of India and China. Some may also not directly derived from Malay into English, but through other languages, in particular, that of European powers that have exercised significant influence in the [[Maritime Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bartlett|1954|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The adoption of various Malay terms began with contact between European powers and classical [[Malay sultanate]]s in the 16th century and accelerated in the 19th century with the advent of British colonisation in the region. Many of the earliest borrowing can be found in the accounts of early voyages during the [[age of discovery]], when traders and travellers brought back products and objects of natural history from Maritime Southeast Asia which became known by their native names. Over the time, with the flowering of English literature dealing with subjects native to the region, other words used to denote things and notions of [[Malay world]] and [[Malay culture|culture]], have also made their way into English.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bartlett|1954|pp=40–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''logic of information''', or the ''logical theory of information'', considers the information content of logical [[sign (semiotics)|sign]]s and expressions along the lines initially developed by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]].  In this line of work, the concept of information serves to integrate the aspects of signs and expressions that are separately covered, on the one hand, by the concepts of [[denotation]] and [[extension (semantics)|extension]], and on the other hand, by the concepts of [[connotation]] and [[comprehension (logic)|comprehension]].

Peirce began to develop these ideas in his lectures "On the Logic of Science" at [[Harvard University]] (1865) and the [[Lowell Institute]] (1866).

It is a major [[Bamileke language]], and is located in an area where [[sacred king]]ship played a pivotal role in government, justice, and diplomacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Warnier|first=Jean-Pierre|date=2015|title=Review of "Nation of Outlaws, State of Violence: Nationalism, Grassfields Tradition, and State Building in Cameroon" by Meredith Terretta|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/592097/pdf|journal=African Studies Review|volume=58|pages=255–257|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feldman-Savelsberg|first=Pamela|date=1995|title=Cooking inside: Kinship and Gender in Bangangté Idioms of Marriage and Procreation|jstor=645968|journal=American Ethnologist|series=3|volume=22|pages=483–501|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern history of the Bamileke area, which was a German colony placed under French trusteeship by the League of Nations in 1919, is closely associated with the nationalist movement of the [[Union des populations du Cameroun|Union des Populations du Cameroun]] (UPC), which developed primarily in the coastal hinterland (Bassa) and the western highlands (Bamileke).

=== Scholarship on the Bamileke cluster ===
Medumba is part of the Eastern Group of the [[Bamileke languages|Bamileke]] Cluster, which also include [[Fe'fe' language|Fe'fe']], [[Ghomala' language|Ghomálá']], [[Kwa’ language|Kwa']], and [[Nda’nda’ language|Nda'nda']]. The Bamileke cluster — along with Ngemba, Nkambe and Nun — is part of the [[Eastern Grassfields languages|Eastern Grassfields]] subgroup which, together with the [[Ring languages]] and the [[Southwest Grassfields languages|Southwest Grassfields]] languages, constitute the [[Grassfields languages|Grassfield Bantu]] grouping. {{Grassfields Bantu languages}}
Medumba figures prominently in linguistic research on the Bamileke cluster, partly because of the high quality of the work done by Jan Voorhoeve in the 1960s and 1970s, including work on (in chronological order):
* morpheme structure constraints (Voorhoeve 1965&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;)
* personal pronouns (Voorhoeve 1967&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;)
* noun classes (Voorhoeve 1967&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and 1969&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Voorhoeve|first=Jan|date=1969|editor-last=Voorhoeve|editor-first=Jan|editor2-last=de Wolf|editor2-first=Paul|title=Benue-Congo noun class systems: Bangangte|trans-title=|url=|journal=|location=West African Linguistic Society (Africka - Studiecentrum) Leiden|volume=|pages=17–19|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
* tone of nouns (Voorhoeve 1971&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;)
* traditional Bamileke narratives (Voorhoeve 1976&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Contes Bamileke|last=Voorhoeve|first=Jan|publisher=Musée Royal de L'Afrique Centrale|year=1976|isbn=|series=Annales - Série In.8 - Sciences Humaine no. 89|location=Tervuren, Belgium|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

E.|location=|pages=57–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

This work was pursued by L. Hyman in the 1980s, on the closely related language Fe'fe' (add refs). It was re-invigorated in the early 2010s by research groups at Boston University (lead by C. O'Connor) and at the University of British Columbia (lead by R.-M.  Déchaine). Some of these publications include:

Also notable are the scholarly contributions of Medumba speaker-linguists, including (in chronological order):

Recent work on Medumba is part of a more general push towards documenting the languages of Africa, in the face of rising levels of language endangerment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/973733564|title=Africa's endangered languages : documentary and theoretical approaches|others=Kandybowicz, Jason,, Torrence, Harold,|isbn=9780190256340|location=New York, NY|oclc=973733564}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cameroon — along with Nigeria, Sudan, and Ethiopia — is reported to have one of the highest language mortality rates in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Okal|first=Bernad Odoyo|date=2014|title=Benefits of Multilingualism in Education |journal=Universal Journal of Educational Research|volume=2|issue=3 |page=228 |doi=10.13189/ujer.2014.020304}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=How Kenya Stands to Lose More than 10 Tribes|last=Opala|first=K.|date=6 March 2002|work=Daily Nation |publisher=Nation Media Group|location=Nairobi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Literacy and orthography ===
Efforts to develop a Medumba orthography date back to the beginning of the 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Swαndα Mə́dʉmbà: Lexique Français-Mə́dʉmbà (4500 mots) et 260 expression françaises-mə́dʉmbà|last=Tchana|first=Thomas|publisher=Comite de langue bamileke medujba, Production du CEPOM|year=2009|isbn=|location=Bangangte, Cameroon|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are associated with the following milestones:
* '''1926''': Protestant missionaries develop an orthography for use in primary schools to facilitate the penetration of the Christian Bible in the region.
* '''1957''': The French administration prohibits the use of local languages in the territories of the Union Française.
* '''1973''', 20 December: CEPOM (''Comité de Langue pour l'Etude et la Production des Œuvres Bamiléké-Medumba'') is created; its mission is to promote research on Medumba and develop literacy materials.
*

Currently, educational materials, literature and dictionaries for the language are produced by CEPOM, based in Bangangte. The combined output of missionary and CEPOM work has produced more that 80 publications on Medumba language and culture; these are published in French, English, and Medumba. Over time, publications in Medumba  have used six different orthographies:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bird|first=Stephen|date=2001|title=Orthography and identity in Cameroon|url=|journal=Written Language &amp; Literacy|volume=4|issue=2|pages=131–162|doi=10.1075/wll.4.2.02bir|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1926''': published in a collection of 12 songs
* '''1945''': published in a book on religious history (''Nu Yawe Nsi'') and a syllabary
* '''1967''': publication of the New Testament (''Kàn nswe'') and ''Tshô Pangante''
* '''1973''': publication of ''Cam Medumba'' and ''zi'te nkite''.
* '''1979''': publication of ''Mbwog NkUd MedUmbA'' and ''Tons, Textes''…
* '''1985''', 2 February: adoption of the current orthography at the 4th CEPOM Council

In addition to simplex consonants, Medumba has numerous complex consonants, and these are represented as [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] or [[Trigraph (orthography)|trigraphs]]; see Table 2. Nasals, stops, and fricatives can be labliazed; in the orthography this is represented as a CW digraph. [[Stop consonant|Stops]] and [[Fricative consonant|fricatives]] can be [[Prenasalized consonant|pre-nasalized]]; in the orthography this is represented as an NC digraph or an NCW trigraph.

Orthographic conventions for tone-marking are as follows:
* High-tone is not marked
* Low-tone is marked as a grave accent on the vowel, e.g. '''à'''
* Rising Low-High is marked as a hatcheck on a single vowel, e.g. '''ɛˇ'''
* Falling High-Low is marked as circumflex on a single vowel, e.g. '''ʉ̂''' 
Recent developments in digital literacy have had an impact on Medumba. For example, a seven-language electronic calendar — in French, English, and the five national languages (Medumba, Ghomala, Yemba, Meta, Kom) — sends information on time and date to an LCD screen via a VGA controller. The calendar has been developed as a way of mitigating the impact of language competition, and with the specific goal of raising the profile and prestige of the national languages in a context of language endangerment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tchahou Tchendjeu|first=A.

== Segments ==
Initial research on the Medumba segment inventory was conducted by Voorhoeve in the early 1960s, and published in Voorhoeve (1965).&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; He identified15 [[vowel]]s and 40 [[consonant]]s. Not described by Voorhoeve (1965) are the plain and pre-nasalized bilabial trills /B/, /ᵐB/, which occur most often before central vowels /ʉ, ə/, which brings the total number of consonants to 42.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olson|first=Kenneth S.|last2=Meynadier|first2=Yohann|date=2015|title=On Medumba Bilabial Trills and Vowels|url=http://www.internationalphoneticassociation.org/icphs-proceedings/ICPhS2015/Papers/ICPHS0522.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the International Phonetic Association|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following two subsections survey the vowel and consonant inventory.

=== Vowels: 15 vowels ===
Medumba has a 10 simplex vowels, and 5 complex vowels ([[diphthong]]s).

==== Simple vowels ====
Table 3 gives the inventory of simple vowels, which include 5 [[Close vowel|closed]] (high) vowels /i, ʉ, u, ɪ, ʊ/ and 5 non-closed (non-high) /e, ə, o, a, ɑ/.  See (1-10) for examples.

=== Consonants: 42 consonants ===
The canonical morpheme in Medumba is a single [[syllable]], either an [[Open syllable|open CV syllable]] or a [[Syllable|closed CVC syllable]] (Voorhoeve 1965:319).&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Voorhoeve|first=Jan|last2=|date=|year=1965|title=The Structure of the Morpheme in Bamileke (Bangangté dialect)|url=|journal=Lingua|volume=13|pages=319–334|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This morpheme structure constraint has consequences for the consonant inventory. Indeed, a notable property of Medumba is that the number of [[Contrastive distribution|contrastive]] consonants differs according to whether one considers consonants in [[Syllable|onset]] position (i.e., consonants that begin a '''C'''V or '''C'''VC syllable) or consonants in coda position (i.e. consonants that end a CV'''C''' syllable). Below, the consonant inventory is introduced, and the distributional differences between coda (C2) and onset (C1) consonants are described.

Medumba has 42 consonants, of which 18 are simplex consonants and 24 are complex consonants.

==== Simplex consonants ====
Table 5 gives the inventory of the 18 simplex consonants (Voorhoeve 1965); they are displayed according to [[place of articulation]] ([[Labial consonant|labial]], [[Alveolar consonant|alveolar]], [[Palatal consonant|palatal]], [[Velar consonant|velar]], [[Glottal stop|glottal]]), and [[manner of articulation]] ([[Nasal consonant|nasal stop]], [[Stop consonant|oral stop]], [[Fricative consonant|fricative]]). There are 4 [[Nasal consonant|nasals]] [m, n], ɲ, ŋ], 4 voiced stops [b, d, j, g], 4 voiceless stops [t, c, k, ʔ]), and 2 voiced fricatives (v, z) and 3 voiceless fricatives (f, s, ʃ). Dashes (--) indicate gaps in the consonant inventory.

** but [p] occurs as an [[allophone]] of /b/
* there is a voiceless palatal fricative /'''ʃ'''/ (with limited distribution), but no counterpart voiced palatal fricative '''*/ʒ/'''

** but [ɣ] occurs as a release in the /ᵑg/~[ᵑgˠ] alternation, and [x] occurs as a release in the /ᵑk/~[ᵑkˣ] alternation

==== Complex consonants ====
Table 6 gives the inventory of the  24 [[Co-articulated consonant|complex consonants]] found in Medumba (Voorhoeve 1965:326, section 3.1.9); they are displayed according to the primary place of articulation (labial, alveolar, palatal and velar) and the nature of the [[secondary articulation]] (labialized, pre-nasalized, and pre-nasalized labialized). This includes 8 [[Labialization|labialized]] consonants ('''Cᵂ'''), 10 [[Prenasalized consonant|pre-nasalized]] consonants ('''ᴺC'''), and 6 pre-nasalized labialized stops ('''ᴺCᵂ'''). Complex consonants only occur in onset position; see the next section for exemplification.

==== Final consonants ====
Of the 40 consonants found in Medumba, only 7 can be coda consonants: the 3 nasal stops /m, n, ŋ/, the 3 counterpart voiced oral stops /b, d, ɡ/, and the glottal stop /ʔ/. See Table 7 for the list of coda consonants, ordered according to place of articulation (labial, alveolar, velar, glottal), and manner of articulation (nasal stop, oral stop). (16-18) present examples of nasals in coda posit. (19-22) present examples of oral stops in coda position, which display allophonic variation conditioned by the right-edge context.

==== Initial consonants ====
Table 8 presents the inventory of onset consonants and their allophones. The only consonant excluded from onset position is the glottal stop /ʔ/. All other consonants occur in onset position, so  there are 39 possible onset consonnants. In onset position, nasals may be plain ('''C''') or labialized ('''Cᵂ'''). All other consonant types (voiced plosives, voiceless plosives, fricative) occur as plain ('''C'''),  labialized ('''Cᵂ'''), pre-nasalized ('''ᴺC'''), or pre-nasalized and labialized ('''ᴺCᵂ'''). In addition, onset consonants display allophonic variation that is conditioned by the following vowel. Examples are given below, as follows:
* onset '''labials'''; see (23-29)
* onset '''alveolars'''; see (30-38)
* onset '''palatals'''; see (39-49)
* onset '''velars'''; see (50-59)

=== Phonological processes affecting segments ===

==== Vowel insertion ====
Consonant-final words — which are generally CVC because of the size constraint that favours CV or CVC words —are often augmented by a final vowel. This process of vowel insertion happens in one of two contexts: (i) before a pause; (ii) at then end of a sentence. The quality of the inserted vowel is conditioned by the final consonant: if the final C is a glottal stop, then the inserted vowel is schwa; elsewhere, the inserted vowel is a copy of the stem vowel. Examples illustrating vowel insertion are given in xx-yy.

        (adapted from Voorhoeve 1965:332)

==== Consonant mutation ====
Consonants in onset position surface with different variants. This consonant allophone, a form of consonant mutation, is conditioned by the following vowel. There are seven conditioning contexts, as follows:
# the non-closed vowels
# the closed vowels
# the high front vowel /i/
# the high non-front vowels /ʉ/ and /u/
# the high central (non-front, non-back) vowel /ʉ/
# the high back vowel /u/
# the vowels /o/ and /ə/
Table 9 lists these seven contexts, along with the set of segments and phonological class that they target, the effect that they have, and the allophonic alternation that they condition.

== Tone ==
Medumba is famous for the extent to which tone shapes grammar. Although having only a two-tone contrast, namely High (H) and Low (L), surface tone melodies are conditioned by a variety of lexical, morphological and syntactic factors:

# lexically specified level Low (L) and High (H) tone
# morphologically derived falling (HL) and rising (HL) contour tones
# syntactically conditioned downstep, where H is produced at a lower pitch than a preceding H tone

=== Two tones: high versus low ===
Medumba is described  as a two-level tone system with low (L) and high (H) tones; examples are given in Table 16. Observe that the L/H contrast is found with all Lexical (open) class categories; this includes verbs, nouns and prepositions. Likewise, Functional (closed-class) categories show an L/H contrasts; this includes verbal F-categories (C, T, and Aspect) and nominal F-categories (Dem, Det, Pl). [Describe examples; also give minimal pairs]

==== Tone contrasts with verbs ====
Verb stems come in two shapes, CV and CVC, with each one contrasting Low and High tone. See (1-5) for examples of High/Low tone contrast with CV stems, and (6-6) for examples of High/Low tone contrast with CVC stems.

In principle, given the possibility of a stem bearing associated with one of four tone melodies — namely L(L), L(H), H(L) and H(H) for nouns and L or H for verbs — one expects to find a four-way tone contrast for a given segmental base (either CV or CVC). No such examples are attested within a given word-class, but there is one instance elf a 4-way contrast across word-classes. In addition, there are a few three-way contrasts for a given noun base, and numerous many four-way tone contrasts with the same base, if one looks at tone melodies across word-classes.
* CV ''tɔ,'' which has L(H), H(L) and H(H) stems
* CVC ''m-vɛd'', which has L(L) 
* CVC ''lɛn'', to, and mvdd.
Examples are given in (1-3).

=== Falling and rising tones ===
In addition to level high and low tones, Medumba exhibits falling (HL) and rising (LH) contour tones. These contour tones are morphologically derived from  floating H tones that occur as affixes preceding or following the stems they associate with. These floating tones make themselves known by docking to tone-bearing units (TBUs) associated with  L-tone, thus forming a tone contour. [DESCRIBE EXAMPLES; add LH examples]

 (identify source)

=== Downstep ===
Medumba shows downstep, where H is produced at a lower pitch than an immediately preceding H tone; downstep is represented as (ꜜ). Downstep is viewed as resulting from a floating Low tone that shifts the pitch level of a following High tone one step lower than the preceding High tone.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Voorhoeve|first=Jan|date=1971|title=Tonology of the Bamileke Noun|url=|journal=Journal of African Languages|volume=10|pages=44–53|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Downstep is syntactically conditioned in that it occurs at phrasal boundaries:
* Downstep occurs between Subject and following Verb,
* Downstep occurs between Verb and following Complement
* Downstep occurs between Noun and following Complement
[GIVE EXAMPLES]

== Morphology ==

=== Affixation ===
Medumba has several affixes including:
* the suffix -''te'', which attaches to verbs to derive the counterpart iterative form ('to verb regularly or repetitively'). While many -te forms have a counterpart base to which the may or may not transparently related (1-10), many of them seem to be frozen forms, for which the underived no longer exists (11-22).
* homorganic nasal prefixal N-, which is found in two contexts:
** it  attaches to verbs to derive nouns
** it attaches to verbs to derive non-initial verbs (e.g. after an auxiliary or the non-initial verb of serial verb construction)
* suffixal H-tone
* prefixal H-tone

===Tonal inflection ===

==== Nominal tone classes: LL, HH, HL, LH ====
Tone on Nouns: {LL, HH, HL, LH}: Voorhoeve introduced a non-segment tone in order to distinguish two different low tone noun groups and two different high tone noun groups. For instance, naʔ and mfən both bear a segment low tone, but their tonal realization is different in the context such as ''mə jən mfən ___''. For instance, naʔ in ''mə jən mfən '''naʔ''' (I saw the child of the cow)'' bears a non-low tone, whereas mfen in ''mə jən mfən'' '''''mfən''''' ''(I saw the child of the chief)'' bears a low tone. He proposed a four-way distinction, L(L), L(H), H(L), and H(H) to account for the nominal tone groups (Voorhoeve 1971:44-53). Examples are given in Table 10.

==== Verbal tone classes: L, H ====
Tone on Verbs: {L, H}: The radical of the verb has only one tonal contrast, which is a Low and High contrast.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Voorhoeve|first1=Jan|date=1974|title=Locatives in Bangangte-Bamileke|journal=Studies in African Linguistics|volume=5|issue=2|page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Franich|first=Kathryn|date=2014|title=Contour Tones and Prosodic Structure in Medumba|url=https://journals.linguisticsociety.org/proceedings/index.php/BLS/article/viewFile/3135/2853|journal=Annual Meeting of the Berkeley Linguistics Society|volume=40|pages=102–124|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tone of radical may be realized differently in different contexts. For instance, a low tone verb that has a nasal prefix has a different tone from its non-prenasalized counterpart. Examples are provided to illustrate this phenomenon.

The examples above show that the Low tone radical is realized as a high tone if the verb is prenasalized, whereas it is realized as a low-mid tone if the verb is not prenasalized. The High tone radical is realized as mid tone regardless of prenasalization. This effect is also found in Bamileke-FeʔFeʔ.

===  Noun classes  ===
Voorhoeve identifies two characteristics of noun classes that surface in Medumba:&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Voorhoeve|first=Jan|last2=|date=|year=1968|title=Noun Classes in Bamileke|url=|journal=Lingua|volume=21|pages=584–593|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Systems of pairings between singular and plural prefixes
* Concording nominal and prenominal prefixes
Voorhoeve also assumes that pronominal prefixes exist within the noun class system, with these prefixes consisting of inherent tone morphemes such as the left-edge floating tone. The added prenominal tone creates a tonal difference between singular and plural noun class pairs, with generation of the plural form created by the singular.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Noun classes can be detached by singular and plural pairs.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.lingref.com/cpp/acal/44/paper3129.pdf|title=Interspeaker Variation in Noun Class Realization in Medumba, a Grassfields Language|last=Goldman|first=Nora|last2=Orman|first2=Will|last3=Paquette|first3=Elodie|last4=Franich|first4=Kathryn|last5=Hawkes|first5=Rachel|last6=Ngabeu|first6=Ariane|last7=O'Connor|first7=Catherine|work=Selected Proceedings of the 44th Annual Conference on African Linguistics|publisher=Cascadilla Proceedings Project|year=2015|isbn=|editor-last=Kramer|editor-first=Ruth|location=Somerville, MA|pages=98–109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voorhoeve ascertains that the nasal prefix serves as a distinguishing factor between singular and plural noun pairs. As seen in Table 19, this nasal prefix does not surface in all constructions, especially with singular nouns that are already nasal word-initially.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Other noun classes in Medumba, however, exhibit derivation from [[Proto-Bantu language|Proto-Bantu]] noun classes, which had a strict parallel between singular and plural classes.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In comparing [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] systems of Bamileke languages, Medumba behaves independently from the expected system. Compared to Proto-Bantu noun classes, there seems to be a noun class merger in Medumba.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This merger occurs through the compression of various Proto-Bantu noun classes into a generalized noun class in Medumba. This can be seen in Table 13.

Proto-Bantu noun classes typically assign particular words to certain noun classes, but this is not exhibited in Medumba. This would imply the dissolution of strict noun classes like the ones found in Proto-Bantu, as the set noun classes are merging into one class, albeit still maintaining a noun class-like form.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The flexibility of noun classes in Medumba could be correlated with inflectional morphemes acting as the noun class system, with these morphemes surfacing as left-edge floating tones.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anghelescu|first=Andrei|date=2010|title=Tonology of the Disyllabic Medumba Noun|url=https://linguistics.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2016/07/Andrei-Anghelescu-Tonology-of-the-Disyllabic-Medumba-Noun-April-9.pdf|journal=Boston University|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loan words are normally inserted into unrestricted noun classes. /látr&lt;s&gt;í&lt;/s&gt;/, the loan word for "light" from English, can either be viewed as a mass noun or not, depending on the speaker. In the case of Medumba, this allows for any noun class to take a loan word.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In looking at interspeaker variation on the addition of loan words in Medumba noun classes, the instability of a formal noun class allows flexibility with speakers of various dialects This could be due to disagreement on how to lexicalize a new loan word between the various dialects. One such example is the loan word for "light", /látr&lt;s&gt;í&lt;/s&gt;/. While one speaker chose to pluralize /látr&lt;s&gt;í&lt;/s&gt;/ as /ndátr&lt;s&gt;í&lt;/s&gt;/, the other speaker refused to pluralize /látr&lt;s&gt;í&lt;/s&gt;/ as they believed it was a mass noun.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Younger speakers of Medumba are beginning to use forms of words that do not account for noun class, such as the first person possessive form /jɔm/. The first person possessive form normally varies depending on the noun it is possessing, such as in /látr&lt;s&gt;í&lt;/s&gt; -ɔm/ (my light) or /ndátr&lt;s&gt;í&lt;/s&gt; -t͡ʃɔm/ (my lights). It is unknown as to how much younger speakers know about noun classes and agreement.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Pronouns: simplex, possessive, complex, reciprocal ===
Bamileke distinguishes four sets of [[personal pronoun]]s: simplex, possessive, complex, and reciprocal.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Voorhoeve|first=Jan|date=1967|title=Personal Pronouns in Bamileke|url=|journal=Lingua|volume=17|pages=421–430|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Simplex pronouns ====
Simplex pronouns are differentiated according to syntactic position: 
* subject forms are V, CV, or CVC, and surface with Low tone or High tone 
* object forms are V, CV, or CVC, and surface with Low toner or High tone 
* elsewhere forms occur as indirect object, object of P, or in non-argument position (e.g. when topicalized by ''kí'' or focus-marked by ''á'')

Almost all plural pronouns often begin with ''b''-, which is a marker of plurality; see Table 15. The only exception to this is the 2pl pronoun ''jin'', which is the elsewhere form (i.e. it is used with indirect objects, objects of prepositions, and for topicalization and focalization).

Medumba has a rich inventory of temporal and aspectual auxiliaries, and makes productive use of serial verb constructions. [Give examples]

==== Tense-marking ====
Medumba has finely articulated temporal contrasts, with up to 9 distinct past tense auxiliaries, and 5 distinct future tense auxiliaries.&lt;ref&gt;Mucha, Anne. 2016. Temporal interpretation and cross-linguistic variation. A formal semantic analysis of temporal and aspectual reference in Hausa and Medumba. PhD dissertation, Potsdam University, 249pp. https://ids-pub.bsz-bw.de/frontdoor/index/index/docId/5424&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mucha|first=Anne|date=2017|title=Past interpretation and graded tense in Medumba|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11050-016-9128-1|journal=Natural Language Semantics|volume=25|pages=1–52|doi=10.1007/s11050-016-9128-1|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Bracketed clause-typing ====
Medumba makes use of numerous clause-typing particles that occur at the beginning or end of the sentence: they are used to mark yes/no questions, content questions, relative clauses, as well as embedded clauses. In addition, there are two forms of negation, according to whether negation has scope over  VP or CP: VP-scope negation is contrastive (e.g. He bought some books, but he did not sell pens); CP-scope negation denies the truth of a proposition ''p'' (e.g. NOT-p = it is not the case that ''p'').

=== DP: nominal syntax ===

==== Associative N of NP construction ====
Associative noun constructions, which usually translated as 'Noun&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; of Noun&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;', as in ''bǎm'' ''mɛ́n'' (‘belly of the child’), are analyzed with a [[floating tone]] interposed between the two nouns. The  presence of this floating tone is reflected by the tone melodies borne by the nouns that precede or follow it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Danis|first=Nick|last2=Barnes|first2=Jonathan|last3=O'Connor|first3=Catherine|date=2012|title=Downstep and Contour Formation in Medumba: A Prosodic Account|url=http://www.lingref.com/cpp/acal/42/paper2755.pdf|journal=Selected Proceedings of the 42nd Annual Conference on African Linguistics: African Languages in Context|volume=|pages=23–31|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This associative tone, first hypothesized by Jan Voorhoeve, may be high or low depending on the class and tone pattern of the preceding noun. The tone may lower the pitch-level of Noun&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (a phenomenon called down step); or it may combine with the final vowel of Noun&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, resulting in a (rising LH or falling HL) contour tone.

For example, in (1), the first line represents the theorized underlying tonal melody of the two nouns, with the L tone associative marker in bold. The second line shows the two tones which are actually pronounced at the surface, with the pitch level shown in brackets (a very low pitch followed by a mid-range pitch). Likewise in (2), the first line shows the theoretical tonal melody of what at the surface are pronounced as a LH contour on Noun&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and a down-stepped high tone on Noun&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus, in brackets we see a slash indicating a rise from low to high pitch, and a mid-level line indicating a mid-range pitch.

Examples (3) to (6) illustrate the realization of the associative in contexts where Noun&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is L-tone and Noun&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is H-tone. Whether or not Noun&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is theorized to be followed by a floating L or H tone has no effect on the surface form (i.e., the difference between (3) and (5), and (4) and (6)). What does have an effect is the tone of the associative marker—in (3) and (5) it is H, while in (4) and (6) it is L, resulting in an LH contour on Noun&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.

The effect that the associative tone has on either of the two nouns may be dependent on which floating tones accompany those nouns, which in turn is decided by their noun class. Examples (7) to (10) illustrate the realization of the associative in contexts where Noun&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is H-tone and Noun&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is H-tone. As with (3) to (6), in examples (7) and (9) we can see that the floating tone following the noun has no effect on the surface form—if the associative marker is H, then the surface form will always be two level H tones, or else an HL contour followed by an H tone, varying by speaker or dialect. In the case of (8) and (10), the floating tone which follows the noun does have a perceptible effect. In (8), the surface form is either an H tone followed by an L tone, or else an HL contour followed by a L tone (again, varying by speaker or dialect). However, in (10) the only available choice is a H tone followed by down-stepped H, demonstrating that the theorized underlying tones do have an effect on the pitch at which tones are actually pronounced.

==== Post-nominal and pre-nominal demonstratives ====
Medumba [[demonstratives]] (the equivalent of English "this" or "that") include three elements:&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kouankem|first=Constantine|date=|year=2013|title=Determiner phrase structure and concord in Medumba|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.2989/02572117.2013.793941|journal=South African Journal of African Languages|volume=33|issue=1|pages=59–64|doi=10.2989/02572117.2013.793941|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* a noun (N); 
* a demonstrative (Dem), which shows [[noun class]] with the noun; 
* an obligatory "adverbial locative reinforcer" (Loc)
The normal ([[Markedness|unmarked]]) order or demondtratives is postnominal, yieding [Noun-Dem-Loc]. Divergence from this canonical order is possible, so that [Dem-N-Loc] is also attested, and yields a [[Focus (linguistics)|contrastive focus]] reading, where the noun is contrasted with other deictic alternatives (''this'' man, as opposed to that man).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Combining Nouns with Adjectives, Numerals and Demonstratives ====
Within the DP, there are 8 possible word order variations, taking into account the order of nouns, adjectives, demonstratives, and numerals. These are divided by Kouankem (2011) into post-nominal and pre-nominal variations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Kouankem|first=Constantine|title=On the Syntax of the Medumba Determiner Phrase|date=2011|degree=PhD|publisher=University of Yaounde I|url=|place=Yaoundé|doi=|type=|chapter=|docket=|oclc=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The possible word orders are (where N = noun; A = adjective; Dem = demonstrative; and Num = number):

=== AP: adjectival syntax ===
There are three kinds of adjective classes in Medumba, which differ in their order relative to the noun they modify. [GIVE EXAMPLES] &lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==== Pure adjectives ====
There are a limited number of pure adjectives.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; These are further divided into two classes. Class 1 pure adjectives always appear before their noun. Class 2 pure adjectives typically appear after the noun, but can appear before the noun in a contrastive context. [GIVE EXAMPLES]

==== Nominal adjectives ====
[GIVE EXAMPLES]

==== Verbal adjectives ====
[GIVE EXAMPLES]

=== PP: Prepositional Syntax ===
Medumba has four locative prepositions: ''mbàŋ'' (next to), ''mʙəә́'' (in front of), ''ɲàm'' (behind), and ''nùm'' (on).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Animacy Constraints on Prepositional Objects in Medumba, a Grassfields Language|last=Hawkes|first=Rachel|last2=Paquette|first2=Elodie|last3=Goldman|first3=Nora|last4=Ngabeu|first4=Ariane|last5=O'Connor|first5=Catherine|work=Selected Proceedings of the 44th Annual Conference on African Linguistics|publisher=Cascadilla Proceedings Project|year=2015|isbn=|editor-last=Kramer|editor-first=Ruth|location=Somerville, MA|pages=122–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there are several strategies for forming prepositional phrases  involving overt prepositions or “locative specifications”, there are no overt locative prefixes which correspond to the Bantu locative classes (16), (17), and (18) (pa-, ku-, and mu- respectively).&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; However, there is a &lt;nowiki&gt;''covert''&lt;/nowiki&gt; prefix in the form of a floating H tone whose presence may be detected in certain contexts by its effects on the pitch of surrounding tones, which Voorhoeve hypothesizes that it may be the remnant of those locative classes. The interpretation of a noun marked with this tone is variable and context dependent, generally corresponding to prepositions like on, at, or in. [Give examples]

== Conventions for presenting Medumba language data ==
The following conventions are used to present Medumba language data
* symbols in square brackets […] give the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] form
* examples in italic give the Medumba [[orthography]]
* example sentences used the following format
** line 1: orthography
** line 2: IPA transcription
** line 3: morpheme breakdown (called a "gloss" by linguists)
** line 4: translation
Thus, example (1) is presented as follows:
 Orthography:  (1) a. '''''me''' kem men''                                 (2) ''a''. '''''bag''' jen men''

 Translation:        'I saw the child'                                 'We saw the child'
 
 Orthography:      b.  '''''me''' ke? jen men''                                b. '''''bag''' ke? jen men''
 IPA:
 Gloss:                1sg NEG see child                                1pl NEG see child
 Translation:          'I did not see the child'                        'We did not see the child'
 
 Orthography:      c.  '''me'''  do          jen men                       c.  '''''bag''' do jen men''
 IPA: 
 Gloss:                1st Past.Recent see child                         1pl Past.Recent see child       
 Translation:          'I just saw the child'                           'We just saw the child'
 
 Orthography:      d.  '''''me''' ke  njen men''                               d.  '''''bag''' ke  njen men''
 IPA:
 Gloss:               1sg ?? see  child                                 1pl ?? see  child

== Biography ==
Mohammad Mokhtari was born in [[Mashhad]]. He graduated from [[Ferdowsi University of Mashhad]] in 1969, majoring in Persian Language and Literature. He married in 1972 and had two sons.

In 1973, Mokhtari joined the literary foundation of Ferdowsi’s [[Shahnameh]] and soon became a member of its scientific committee. From 1979 until the beginning of the [[Iranian Cultural Revolution|Cultural Revolution]], Mokhtari taught at the School of Dramatic Arts (today’s School of Cinema and Theatre) of [[University of Tehran]].

In 1981, he was the secretary of the Iranian Writers’ Association for one year. He was arrested in 1982 for political reasons and imprisoned for two years and at this time he was also permanently banned from working for the Iranian government. From 1986, he was on the editorial board of the Donya-ye Sokhan magazine. He also had close ties with other publications such as Takapu. Mokhtari played a key role in the re-opening of the Iranian Writers’ Association. He was a long-time member of the Association and a central figure in the Third Iranian Writers’ Association. According to friends and acquaintances, he worked eagerly for the achievement of the goals of the Association, and followed its projects with patience and perseverance; his constructive and helpful criticism proved vital for the Association (Asr-e No). He also played a crucial part in the writing and publication of a letter, dated October 15, 1994, in which 134 writers stated their objection to censorship and restraints on the freedom of expression. Mokhtari was a successful researcher and respected poet and he had published several books of poetry, as well as a book on mythology.

=== Death ===
On December 3, 1998, Mr. Mokhtari left his house for shopping and never returned. The next day, police officers of Aminabad found an [[unidentified decedent|unidentified body]] in an uninhabited area of Aminabad, on the estate of a cement factory, near the road to Firuzabad (near Tehran City). There was nothing to help identify the body, other than a pen and a piece of paper. The body was transferred to the police station’s forensic team. On December 10 (the [[Human Rights Day|International Human Rights Day]]), one week after his disappearance, the body was identified at the morgue and his family remarked that there appeared to be bruising around his neck.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/11/world/writer-missing-in-iran-raising-fear-of-killings.html?action=click&amp;module=Search&amp;region=searchResults%230&amp;version=&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fquery.nytimes.com%2Fsearch%2Fsitesearch%2F%3Faction%3Dclick%26region%3DMasthead%26pgtype%3DHomepage%26module%3DSearchSubmit%26contentCollection%3DHomepage%26t%3Dqry372%23%2FMohammad%2BMokhtari%2F|title = Writer Missing In Iran, Raising Fear of Killings|date = December 11, 1998|accessdate = December 28, 2014|website = The New York Times|publisher = |last = Jehl|first = Douglas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died on December 3, 1998 of suffocation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; His death came only a few days after the death of Iranian political activists, [[Parvaneh Eskandari Forouhar]] and her husband, [[Dariush Forouhar]] and the assassination of writer [[Mohammad-Ja'far Pouyandeh]]. The [[Ministry of Intelligence|Iranian Ministry of Intelligence]] later denied responsibility for the Mokhtari death&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.payvand.com/news/09/dec/1079.html|title = Parastoo Forouhar Banned From Leaving Iran|date = December 8, 2009|accessdate = December 28, 2014|website = Payvand Iran News|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and claimed a "foreign network" may have assassinated him.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

He has also written an introduction to Western Painting the first volume of which was published by Kalachuvadu under the title மேற்கத்திய ஓவியங்கள். A contributor to several Indian newspapers and literary magazines, several volumes of his essays have also been collated and published, the most notable ones being Agrahaarathil Periyar (அக்கிரகாரத்தில் பெரியார்) and Thirumbichendra Tharunam (திரும்பிச் சென்ற தருணம்).He is one of the Advisories in awards panel of [[The_Tamil_Literary_Garden|Tamil literary garden]] organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tamilliterarygarden.com/judges|title=Judges - Tamil literary garden |publisher=Tamil Literary Garden|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Krishnan presently lives with his wife Revathi in [[New Delhi]] and their only son Siddharth works in Google in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.westlandbooks.in/author_detail.php?author_id=345|title=P A Krishnan|publisher=Westland books|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tiger Claw Tree follows the vicissitudes of a Tenkalai [[Iyengar]] family in South India.&lt;ref name="Muddy"&gt;{{cite news|title='The Muddy River' is a mirror of political fiction|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/the-muddy-river-is-a-mirror-of-political-fiction/217473-40-101.html|accessdate=|newspaper=IBN Live|date=3 January 2012|location=India}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its center is the matriarch Ponna who is taking her last stand both against death and her failing memory. Her confused memories about long forgotten family anecdotes are both family history and impetus for events in the personal history of her children grandchildren and great grand children. The last of these are Kannan and Nambi who bring the story into the latter half of the last century and whose personal tragedies are set against the larger canvas of regional and national histories. Although an engaging family saga it rises above that genre by exploring the validity of ideas and their personal betrayal against the tragic backdrop of the nightmare that is History.
The title is drawn from a A.K.Ramanujan translation of a famous Sangam poem  from the anthology Ainkurunuru (Poem 142). Author adds a pithy coda to this little gem of a poem : "Each person has a tree within himself, to some the birds may not come at all. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Tigerclaw-Tree-P-Krishnan/dp/9380658621|website=Amazon|title=The Tiger Claw Tree}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Krishnan's second novel Muddy River drops the grand raconteurial ambition of narrating stories spanning a century and Instead chooses to focus on one  man's story  against the backdrop of Indian bureaucracy and modern day politics.&lt;ref name="Muddy"/&gt; Drawn largely from his personal experience as an Executive Director of Vigilance in a public sector company, the novel follows Ramesh Chandran in his quest to rescue a kidnapped Engineer from the hands of Assamese Militants. The novel adopts a more complicated narrative strategy than Tiger Claw as it tracks in parallel the authorial ambitions of Ramesh Chandran as he attempts to weave his own life story that is part adventure, part bureaucratic nightmare and part personal tragedy into a complex novel. Self-referential and ambitious Muddy river attempts to blur the lines between fiction and reality, between narrator and the narration in the hope that these erasures will bring forth a more meaningful reality for its present and future readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Muddy-River-P-Krishnan/dp/9380658567/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=|website=Amazon|title=The Muddy river}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PROMT is headquartered in [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia and also has offices in Moscow, Russia, San Francisco, the USA and Hamburg, Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.promt.com/company/profile/ |title=PROMT team |publisher=Promt.com |date= |accessdate=November 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Except the system of machine translation PROMT also delivers its own solutions on the basis of the [[Translation memory]] technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.promt.com/company/technology/translation_memory/ |title=Translation Memory |publisher=Promt.com |date= |accessdate=November 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The company was founded in St.-Petersburg in 1991 by the former employees of laboratory of engineering linguistics of [[Herzen University]]. Svetlana Sokolova is the head of the company from its first day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.quintura.com/2008/06/25/renova-capital-to-acquire-promt-machine-translation-software-company/ |title=Quintura blog » Blog Archive » Renova Capital To Acquire PROMT Machine Translation Software Company |publisher=Blog.quintura.com |date= |accessdate=November 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 6, 1998 PROMT launches the first Russian web service [[:ru:Translate.ru|Translate.ru]], intended for translation of the text or a web pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://translate.ru.siteaero.com/ |title=Translate.ru |publisher=Translate.ru.siteaero.com |date=March 6, 1998 |accessdate=November 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has an English version Online-Translator http://www.online-translator.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.online-translator.com/about.aspx?prmtlang=en |title=PROMT - Free Online Translator and dictionary - English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese (Brazilian) and Russian languages |publisher=Online-translator.com |date= |accessdate=November 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997 PROMT together with the French company Softissimo develops a number of products for the western market called [[Reverso (language tools)|Reverso]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reverso.softissimo.com/en/reverso-promt |title=End-users products : Translation Software : Reverso Promt |publisher=Reverso Softissimo |date= |accessdate=November 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 the company controlling stake has been redeemed by [[Renova Group]]. The sum of transaction is not disclosed, but according to Renova, the total amount of the world market of a translation service for the companies valued in 2007 at $9–10 billion, PROMT sales are 2% from this sum, that is $180–200 million. Hence by evaluations of one of observers of the market, who wanted to remain unnamed, cost of the packet acquired by "Renova" is no more than $20–40 million.&lt;ref&gt;http://eng.cnews.ru/news/top/printEn.shtml?2008/06/25/306445 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420084240/http://eng.cnews.ru/news/top/printEn.shtml?2008%2F06%2F25%2F306445 |date=April 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
PROMT translation is a [[rule-based machine translation]] (RBMT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.translationautomation.com/details/promt-9.0-product-family.html |title=promt-9.0-product-family &amp;#124; details &amp;#124; TAUS - Enabling better translation |publisher=Translationautomation.com |date= |accessdate=November 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; RBMT is a machine translation system based on linguistic information about source and target languages basically retrieved from (bilingual) dictionaries and grammars covering the main semantic, morphological, and syntactic regularities of each language respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Natural Language Processing |url=http://language.worldofcomputing.net/machine-translation/rule-based-machine-translation.html |title=Rule Based Machine Translation |publisher=Language.worldofcomputing.net |date=December 13, 2009 |accessdate=November 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having input sentences (in some source language), an RBMT system generates them to output sentences (in some target language) on the basis of morphological, syntactic, and semantic analysis of both the source and the target languages involved in a concrete translation task.

At the end of 2010 of PROMT provided the Hybrid technology of translation leverages the strengths of [[Statistical machine translation]] and rule-based translation methodologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.svarogcapital.com/news/?id=43 |title=News / Svarog capital |publisher=Svarogcapital.com |date=October 4, 2010 |accessdate=November 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approaches differ in a number of ways:

'''Rules post-processed by statistics:''' Translations are performed using a rules based engine. Statistics are then used in an attempt to adjust/correct the output from the rules engine.

'''Statistics guided by rules:''' Rules are used to pre-process data in an attempt to better guide the statistical engine. Rules are also used to post-process the statistical output to perform functions such as normalization. This approach has a lot more power, flexibility and control when translating.

'''Philippine Hokkien''' ({{zh|c=咱儂話|poj=Lán-lâng-ōe|l=our people's language}}), is the variant of [[Hokkien]] as spoken by about 98.7% of the [[Chinese Filipino|ethnic Chinese population of the Philippines]]. A mixed version that involves this language with [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] and [[Philippine English|English]] is [[Hokaglish]].

==Terminology==
The term ''Philippine Hokkien'' is used when differentiating the variety of Hokkien spoken in the Philippines from those spoken in Taiwan, China, and other [[Southeast Asia]]n countries.
{{cleanup|reason=copyediting and citation needed|date=April 2013}}
There are various terms that native to the speaker itself used:
* '''咱儂話''' (Hokkien: lán-lâng-ōe [lán-lâng-uē]; Mandarin: zánrénhuà) -- literally means "our own people's speech", it mostly refers to Philippine Hokkien.
* '''閩南語''' (Hokkien: bân-lâm-gí; Mandarin: mǐnnányǔ) -- literally means "Southern Min language" or "Ban Lam Gi" or "Minnan language", this refers to the variant spoken in Quanzhou, Zhangzhou, Xiamen and Taiwan  (in Taiwan and Mainland China).
* '''台語''' (Hokkien: tâi-gí; Mandarin: tái-yǔ) and '''台灣話''' (Hokkien: tâi-oân-ōe [tâi-uân-uē]; Mandarin: táiwanhuà) --  literally means "Taiwanese language", this refers to Taiwanese Hokkien.
* '''厦門話''' (Hokkien: ē-mn̂g-ōe [ē-mn̂g-uē]; Mandarin: xiamenhua)--literally means ''Xiamen Speech'' refers to Min Nan spoken in  Xiamen City in Fujian, Mainland China.
* '''泉州話''' (Hokkien: choân-chiu-ōe [tsuân-chiu-uē] ; Mandarin: quánzhōuhuà)--literally means ''Quanzhou Speech'' refers to Min Nan spoken in Quanzhou City and other City Like Shishi City, Nan-an City,An-xi City Jinjiang City, Hui-an City, Ying-chun City, Dehua City and Tong-an City in Fujian, Mainland China.
* '''漳州話''' (Hokkien: chiang-chiu-ōe [tsiang-chiu-uē]; Mandarin: zhāngzhōuhuà)--literally means ''Zhangzhou Speech'' refers to Min Nan spoken in Zhangzhou City and other City Like Longyan City, Zhangping City, and Dongshan City in Fujian, Mainland China.
* '''福建話''' (Hokkien: hok-kiàn-ōe [hok-kiàn-uē]; Mandarin: fújiànhuà) -- literally means "Fujianese language", this refers to all Fujianese varieties in Taiwan and Mainland China, however this term is a misnomer because in Fujian, China there are many other languages like Min Dong and Min Zhong.

In the Philippines, all terms are used interchangeably to refer to Philippine Hokkien.

==Classification==
Philippine Hokkien is generally similar to the Hokkien dialect spoken in [[Jinjiang, Fujian|Jinjiang]] and [[Quanzhou]], however, the Hokkien dialect spoken in [[Xiamen]], also known as ''[[Amoy dialect|Amoy]]'' ({{zh|c=廈門話}}), is considered the standard and prestigious form of Hokkien. Minor differences with other Hokkien dialects in Taiwan, China, or throughout Southeast Asia only occur in terms of vocabulary.

==Geographic spread==
Hokkien is spoken by ethnic Chinese throughout the [[Philippines]]. Major metropolitan areas that have a significant number of Chinese include [[Metro Manila]], [[Metro Cebu]] and [[Metro Davao]]. Other cities which also substantial Chinese populations in [[Angeles City]], [[Bacolod City]], [[Cagayan de Oro]], [[Dagupan City]], [[Dumaguete City]], [[Ilagan, Isabela|Ilagan]], [[Iloilo City]], [[Legazpi, Albay|Legaspi]], [[Naga, Camarines Sur|Naga City]], [[Tacloban City]], [[Vigan]] and [[Zamboanga City]].

==Sociolinguistics==
[[File:Chinese Filipino Language.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Languages spoken by Chinese Filipinos at home]]
Only 12.2% of all ethnic Chinese have a [[varieties of Chinese]] as their mother tongue. Nevertheless, the vast majority (77%) still retain the ability to understand and speak Hokkien as a second or third language.&lt;ref name="autogenerated19"&gt;Teresita Ang-See, "Chinese in the Philippines", 1997, Kaisa, pg. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the emergence of China as a regional power in the late 1990s, speaking Hokkien, Mandarin, Cantonese and other Chinese varieties was seen as old-fashioned and awkward, with the younger generation of Chinese Filipinos opting to use either [[English language in the Philippines|English]], [[Filipino language|Filipino]] or [[Philippine languages|various other regional languages]] as their [[first language]]s.

Recent developments showing the rise of a politically and economically stronger China eventually led to the newly found elegance and style now associated with speaking Hokkien and other Chinese varieties. Hence, there is a stronger clamour for instructors who can produce students fluent in Hokkien and Mandarin. Many young parents are also shifting to using Hokkien at home as their children's first language.

==Education==
Around 120 Chinese Filipino educational institutions exist throughout the Philippines, with the vast majority being concentrated in [[Metro Manila]]. These schools primarily differ from others in the Philippines with the presence of Chinese-language subjects.

These schools were previously under direct supervision of the [[Republic of China (Taiwan)]] [[Ministry of Education (Republic of China)|Ministry of Education]] until 1976 when ''[[Presidential Decree]] 176 of 1973'' (sometimes called the "Filipinization" decree) of former [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]] placed all foreign schools under the authority of the [[Department of Education (Philippines)|Department of Education]]. The decree effectively halved the time allotted for Chinese subjects, while Tagalog became a required subject, and the [[medium of instruction]] shifted from [[Mandarin Chinese]] to English.

===Curriculum===
Chinese Filipino primary and secondary schools typically feature Chinese subjects added to the standard curriculum prescribed by the Department of Education. The three core Chinese subjects are Chinese Grammar ({{zh|c=華語|p=huáyǔ|poj=hoâ-gí|l=[[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]]}}), Chinese Composition ({{zh|c=綜合|p=zònghé|poj=chong-ha̍p}}), and Chinese Mathematics ({{zh|c=數學|p=shùxué|poj=sò͘-ha̍k}}). Other schools may offer additional subjects such as [[Chinese calligraphy]] ({{zh|c=毛筆|p=máobǐ|poj=mô͘-pit}}), [[History of China|history]], [[Geography of China|geography]], and [[Culture of China|culture]], all integrated in all the three core Chinese subjects in accordance with PD № 176. All Chinese subjects are taught in Mandarin Chinese, and in some schools, students are prohibited from speaking English, Filipino, or even Hokkien during these classes.

Presently, the Ateneo de Manila University, under their Chinese Studies Programme  offers Hokkien 1 (Chn 8) and Hokkien 2 (Chn 9) as electives.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.admu.edu.ph/ls/soss/chinese-studies&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, [[Chiang Kai Shek College]] offers Fookien Classes in their CKS College Language Center.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cksc.edu.ph/language-center-footer&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and formation==
Philippine Hokkien developed during successive centuries of the Chinese Filipinos being in the Philippines.

Starting from the early 19th century, Chinese migrants from [[Fujian]] province, specifically from [[Quanzhou]] eventually eclipsed those from [[Guangdong]] province, establishing Hokkien as the primary variety of Chinese spoken in the Philippines.

As ethnic Chinese began to associate with Filipinos and learn Tagalog and English, they began to use native terms used to refer to items that are found only in the Philippine milieu. Also, since most Chinese migrants from Fujian are businessmen and merchants, many have been using colloquialisms and slang words, rather than grammatically correct scholarly jargon. Both result to the current preponderance of English, Tagalog, and Fujian colloquialisms in Philippine Hokkien.

==Orthography==
In some situations, Philippine Hokkien is written in the [[Latin alphabet]]. The [[Chinese Congress on World Evangelization]] –Philippines, an international organization of [[Overseas Chinese]] Christian churches, use a [[romanization|romanization system]] based predominantly on the [[Pe̍h-ōe-jī]] (POJ) system. The origins of this system and its extensive use in the Christian community have led to it being known by some modern writers as "Church Romanization" (Kàu-hōe Lô-má-jī; 教會羅馬字); often abbreviated to ''Kàu-lô'' (教羅). There is some debate on whether "Pe̍h-ōe-jī" or "Church Romanization" is the more appropriate name. During the 19th century, Pe̍h-ōe-jī was used extensively in Chinese Filipino churches and as a result, many Chinese Filipinos were literate in  this system. Since 2006, the  [[Taiwanese Romanization System]] also known as "Tâi-lô", which is derived from Pe̍h-ōe-jī has been officially promoted by Taiwan's Ministry of Education. Due to the extensive Taiwanese influence on Chinese education in the Philippines such as the use of Taiwanese textbooks and materials which contain [[traditional Chinese characters]], Chinese Filipinos and ethnic Filipinos alike who formally study the language nowadays may use a version of Tâi-lô.

In general, [[Min Nan]] has 7 to 9 tones, and [[tone sandhi]] is extensive. There are minor variations between the [[Quanzhou]] and [[Zhangzhou]] tone systems. [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Taiwanese]] tones follow the schemes of [[Amoy]] or [[Quanzhou]], depending on the area of [[Taiwan]]. Both [[Amoy]] and [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Taiwanese]] Min Nan typically has 7 tones; the 9th tone is used only in special or foreign loan words. [[Quanzhou]] is the only Min Nan dialect with 8 tones, of which the 6th tone is present. The Philippine Min Nan dialect follows the 8 tones and tone sandhi of [[Quanzhou]] because many of the Chinese Filipino who speak Min Nan in the Philippines have ancestors from [[Quanzhou]] (Fujian) in [[China]].

==Differences from other Hokkien variants==
Philippine Hokkien is largely derived from the Hokkien dialect spoken in [[Quanzhou]]. However, it gradually absorbed influences from both Standard Amoy and Zhangzhou variants.

Although Philippine Hokkien is generally mutually comprehensible with any [[Hokkien]] variant, including [[Taiwanese Hokkien]], the numerous English and Filipino loanwords as well as the extensive use of colloquialisms (even those which are now unused in China) can result in confusion among Hokkien speakers from outside of the Philippines. In Cebu and Dumaguete for example, instead of Tagalog, Cebuano words are incorporated. In Iloilo and Bacolod, Hiligaynon words are incorporated. While in Central Luzon, Kapampangan and Pangasinan words are incorporated.

===Similarities with either Quanzhou and Zhangzhou variants===
Most speakers of Philippine Hokkien have their origins in Quanzhou and Zhangzhou, hence the influence of the Hokkien variants spoken in these areas.
* The use of -iak suffix where other variants have -ek [-ik], e.g. 色 siak or sek [sik], 綠色 lia̍k-siak or lia̍k-sek [lia̍k-sik], etc.
* The use of -i suffix where other variants have -u, e.g. 語 gí/gú, 做菜 chí/chú [tsí/tsú], etc.
* The use of -uiⁿ [-uinn] suffix where other variants have -eng [-ing] or -oaiⁿ [-uainn], e.g. 最先 suiⁿ [suinn], 高 kûiⁿ [kûinn], etc.
* The use of -oang [-uang] suffix where other variants have -ong, e.g. 風   hoang [huang], etc.

===Similarities with Standard Xiamen (Amoy) variant===
Since the Standard Xiamen (Amoy) variant is considered the most [[prestige dialect|prestigious variant]] of Hokkien and is the spoken variant of the educated residents of Quanzhou and Zhangzhou, elements of this variant occasionally seep into Philippine Hokkien, such as the following:
* The use of -ng suffix where other variants have -uiⁿ [-uinn], e.g. 門 mng, 飯 png, 酸 sng, etc.
* The use of -e suffix where other variants have -oe, e.g. 火 he, 未 be, 地 tē, 細 sè.
* The use of -oe [-ue] suffix where other variants have -oa [-ua], e.g. 話 ōe [ūe], 花 hoe [hue], 瓜 koe [kue].
* The use of -iuⁿ [-iunn] suffix where other variants have -iauⁿ [iaunn]), e.g. 羊 iûⁿ [iûnn], 丈 tiūⁿ [tiūnn], 想 siuⁿ [siunn].
* The use of -iong suffix where other variants have -iang, e.g. 上 siāng, 香 hiang.

===Use of colloquialisms===
Philippine Hokkien (as well as Southeast Asian Hokkien) uses a disproportionately large amount of colloquial words as compared to the Hokkien variants used in China and Taiwan. Many of the colloquialisms are themselves considered dated (specifically, pre-World War II) in China but are still in use among Hokkien-speaking Chinese Filipinos.

* am-cham [am-tsam] (骯髒): dirty. Its equivalent in the Standard Xiamen dialect is "lāu-siông".
* chha-thâu [tshia-thâu] (車頭): chauffeur (literally, "car head", but used in China to refer to a ''headstock''). Its equivalent in the Standard Xiamen dialect is "chhia-hu [tshia-hu]" (車夫).
* chhiáⁿ-thâu-lō͘ [tshiánn-thâu-lōo] (請頭路): to work, to get employed. Its equivalent in the Standard Xiamen dialect is "chòe-kang [tsuè-kang]" (揣工).
* chhiú-siak [tshiú-siak] (首饰): jewelry. Its equivalent in the Standard Xiamen dialect is "chu-pó [tsu-pó]" (珠寶).
* khan-chhiú [khan-tshiú] (牽手): to marry. Its equivalent in the Standard Xiamen dialect is "kiat-hun" (結婚).
* liām-chúi [liām-tsúi](淋水): to baptise. Its equivalent in the Standard Xiamen dialect is "sóe-lé [sué-lé]" (洗禮).
* pēⁿ-chhù/pīⁿ-chhù [pēnn-tshù/pīnn-tshù] (病厝): hospital (literally, "sick house"). Its equivalent in the Standard Xiamen dialect is "i-ìⁿ [i-ìnn]" (醫院).
* pēⁿ-īⁿ/pīⁿ-īⁿ [pēnn-īnn/pīnn-īnn] (病院): hospital (literally, "sick house"). Its equivalent in the Standard Xiamen dialect is "i-ìⁿ [i-ìnn]" (醫院).
* sio̍k (俗): cheap, economical. Its equivalent in the Standard Xiamen dialect is "piān-gî" (便宜).
* siong-hó (相好): friend (literally, "good acquaintance"). Its equivalent in the Standard Xiamen dialect is "pêng-iú [pîng-iú]" (朋友).
* Tn̂g-soaⁿ [Tn̂g-suann] (唐山): China, derived from the term ''[[Names of China#Tang|Tangshan]]''. Its equivalent in the Standard Xiamen dialect is "Tiong-kok" (中國).
* tōa-o̍h [tuā-o̍h] (大學): university or college. Also found in [[Penang Hokkien]]. Its equivalent in the Standard Xiamen dialect is "tāi-ha̍k" (大學).

===Loanwords from English, Spanish, Portuguese and Philippine languages===
Philippine Hokkien, like other Southeast Asian variants of Hokkien (e.g. [[Singaporean Hokkien]], [[Penang Hokkien]], [[Southern Malaysian Hokkien|Johor Hokkien]] and [[Medan Hokkien]]) absorbed several indigenous and English words and phrases which are usually only found (or are more important) in its new milieu. These "borrowed" words are never used in written Hokkien, for which [[Standard Written Chinese|Mandarin characters]] are used.
* ba-su: cup
* chhe-ke [tshe-ke]: check
* ka-mú-ti: sweet potato
* o-pi-sin: office
* pan-sit: stir-fried noodles in Chinese Filipino cuisine
* sap-bûn (雪文): soap (though this sounds similar to the Tagalog ''sabón'', is '''not''' borrowed from that language. In [[Taiwanese language|Taiwanese]], which is a variant of Hokkien that is not influenced by Tagalog, it is pronounced as ''sap-bûn''. Etymologically speaking, perhaps both Taiwanese and Tagalog ultimately derive ''sap-bûn''/''sabon'' from the Romance languages that had brought the concept of soap to them, such as [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''sabão'' and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''jabón'' respectively).

A '''phonetic algorithm''' is an [[algorithm]] for [[index (publishing)|indexing]] of [[word]]s by their [[pronunciation]]. Most phonetic algorithms were developed for use with the [[English language]]{{fact|date=September 2017}}; consequently, applying the rules to words in other languages might not give a meaningful result.

They are necessarily{{fact|date=September 2017}} complex algorithms with many rules and exceptions, because English [[spelling]] and pronunciation is complicated by historical changes in pronunciation and words [[loanword|borrowed]] from many [[language]]s.

Among the best-known phonetic algorithms are:

* [[Soundex]], which was developed to encode surnames for use in censuses. Soundex codes are four-character strings composed of a single letter followed by three numbers.
* [[Daitch–Mokotoff Soundex]], which is a refinement of Soundex designed to better match surnames of Slavic and Germanic origin. Daitch–Mokotoff Soundex codes are strings composed of six numeric digits.
* [[Cologne phonetics]]: This is similar to Soundex, but more suitable for German words.
* [[Metaphone]], [[Double Metaphone]], and [http://www.amorphics.com/ Metaphone 3] which are suitable for use with most English words, not just names. Metaphone algorithms are the basis for many popular [[spell checkers]].
* [[New York State Identification and Intelligence System]] (NYSIIS), which maps similar [[phonemes]] to the same letter. The result is a string that can be pronounced by the reader without decoding.
* [[Match Rating Approach]] developed by Western Airlines in 1977 - this algorithm has an encoding and range comparison technique.
* [[Caverphone]], created to assist in data matching between late 19th century and early 20th century electoral rolls, optimized for accents present in parts of New Zealand.

== Common uses ==
* [[Spell checkers]] can often contain phonetic algorithms. The [[Metaphone]] algorithm, for example, can take an incorrectly spelled word and create a code. The code is then looked up in directory for words with the same or similar Metaphone. Words that have the same or similar Metaphone become possible alternative spellings.
* [[Search engine technology|Search]] functionality will often use phonetic algorithms to find results that don't match exactly the term(s) used in the search. Searching for names can be difficult as there are often multiple alternative spellings for names. An example is the name [[wikt:Claire|Claire]]. It has two alternatives, Clare/Clair, which are both pronounced the same. Searching for one spelling wouldn't show results for the two others. Using [[Soundex]] all three variations produce the same Soundex code, C460. By searching names based on the Soundex code all three variations will be returned.

'''Sapé''' a.k.a. '''Kaliana''' is a nearly extinct language spoken along the Paragua and Karuna rivers. In 2008 a few elderly speakers were found. Sape is one of the most poorly attested extant languages in [[South America]], and may be a [[language isolate]]. There is, however, no linguistic data on the language.&lt;ref&gt;Harald Hammarström, 2010, 'The status of the least documented language families in the world'.

In [[human sexuality]], '''Service-oriented''' is a term  used in the [[BDSM]] community to refer to a relationship dynamic where the focus is on how the [[submissive]] can contribute resources to the [[dominant (BDSM)|dominant]] partner, and provide for some of their needs or advance their goals. Often, this will include domestic service, such as household chores, but can also include such things as chauffeuring or valet services. These relationships may also include [[Romantic love|romantic]] feelings or sexual activity, depending on the specific relationship dynamic chosen.

A common example of such a relationship would be one in which the submissive and dominant were romantically attracted and the submissive is [[Collar (BDSM)|collared]] to the dominant, indicating that they are "in service" to that dominant. The collar may well be predicated on certain performance levels or the usefulness of that submissive in specific areas. If those things were to change or dissipate the couple may remain romantically linked but often the collar will be removed.

For the submissive in such a relationship, the collar is seen as a status symbol signifying the approval and acknowledgement of a person they wish to serve. They often take great pleasure and pride in their status and relationship.

For the dominant, the benefits are practical as well as emotional. Many take great pleasure in being 'served' in this manner, and having the additional resources available is of immense utility.

{{About|[[handwriting]]|other uses|Slant (disambiguation)}}
'''Slant''' is the predominant angle of the [[Ballistic stroke|downward stroke]] in Western handwriting. A good basis for its estimation is the point of the handwritten curve where the velocity has its peak value in the
downward stroke. The [[polar distribution]] of the [[running angle]] along a handwritten trajectory is another good method for estimating the slant angle. Left-handed writing is often accompanied by a slant value which is larger than 90 degrees, i.e., it is bent backwards, to the left.

In [[Graphology]] slant can refer to either upstroke or downstroke values. These strokes can made in the upper, middle, lower, or any combination of those zones.

In [[handwriting recognition]], an [[affine transformation]] can be used to normalize handwritten input towards a population average or towards 90 degrees.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="940">'''TAUM''' (''Traduction Automatique à l'Université de Montréal'') is the name of a research group which was set up at the Université de Montréal in 1965. Most of its research was done between 1968 and 1980. 

It gave birth to the TAUM-73 and TAUM-METEO [[machine translation]] prototypes, using the [[Q-systems|Q-Systems]] programming language created by [[Alain Colmerauer]], which were among the first attempts to perform automatic translation through [[linguistics|linguistic]] analysis. The prototypes were never used in actual production.

The TAUM-METEO name has been erroneously used for many years to designate the [[METEO System]] subsequently developed by [[John Chandioux]].

'''Tabasaran''' (also written '''Tabassaran''') is a [[Northeast Caucasian languages|Northeast Caucasian language]] of the [[Lezgic languages|Lezgic]] branch. It is spoken by the [[Tabasaran people]] in southern part of the [[Russia]]n Republic of [[Dagestan]]. There are two main dialects: North (Khanag) and South Tabasaran. It has a literary language based on the Southern dialect, one of the official languages of Dagestan.

Tabasaran is an [[ergative language]]. The verb system is relatively simple; verbs agree with the subject in number, person and (in North Tabasaran) class. North Tabasaran has two [[noun class]]es (also dubbed with the term "[[grammatical gender]]"), whereas Southern Tabasaran has none (i.e. one fewer than North Tabasaran, because no noun classes means that all nouns belong to the same class).

==Geographical distribution==
It is spoken in the basin of Upper [[Rubas-nir]] and Upper [[Chirakh-nir]].

The '''Tikopia''' language is a [[Polynesian languages|Polynesian]] Outlier language from the island of [[Tikopia]] in the [[Solomon Islands]]. It is closely related to the [[Anuta language]] of the neighboring island of [[Anuta]].  Tikopian is also spoken by the Polynesian minority on [[Vanikoro]], who long ago migrated from Tikopia.

==Introduction==

===History===
Because of its remote and isolated location, Tikopia had few contacts with outside groups until well into the twentieth century. Tikopians
occasionally visited other islands, but these trips were limited by the large distances and great hazards involved in canoe ocean voyages. Contacts by Westerners began sporadically around the beginning of the nineteenth century, but in 1927, when Firth did his initial fieldwork in Tikopia, the indigenous culture was largely intact. The major contact agents were, first, missionaries and, later, labor recruiters. By the 1950s, all the Tikopians had become Christianized, and most of the native ritual practices had ceased. Much of the Tikopian life style has remained intact, but the forces of Westernization have been making inroads throughout the twentieth century (Lagace, 1974).

===Population===
Tikopia is a small remote volcanic island that has a population of 1,200 people. It is the southwest of the Solomon Islands. There are about seventy-five different languages that are spoken on the Solomon Islands. Out of these languages seventy-one are living and four are extinct. Out of the living languages five are institutional, twenty-four are developing, twenty-six are vigorous, eight are in trouble, and eight are dying. Linguists refer this language as a Samoic or a Polynesian Outlier language. Polynesian Outlier languages are a number of Polynesian societies that lie outside the main region of the Polynesian Triangle. Some linguists also believe that Tikopia and Anuta are the dialects of the same language.  There are approximately 3320 speakers that speak the Tikopian language. The Tikopian language, Tikopia-Anuta, is part of the Austronesian language family (Firth, 1985).

==Sound System==

===Consonants===
There are twelve consonant phonemes that this language uses.  They use the letters /f, k, l, m, n, p, r, s, t, v, w, ng/ and the glottal stop (Firth, 1985). There have been debates from different linguists on whether or not Tikopia uses l or r.  Elbert claims that Tikopia is a language that uses l but not r and he strongly believes this because he believed Tikopia was a colony of Samoa.  Raymond Firth said, “Dumont DʻUrville published a small dictionary in 1834 where 235 words were collected.”  R was the most dominant in that dictionary because it appeared in 50 words while l appeared in only 15.  The language changed in over a century and modernly more words are used with l.  Raymond Firths own work shows that both l and r phonemes are used.  Not too many words use the letter l and are actually rarely heard in native speakers (Firth, 1963).

===Vowels===
The vowel phonemes of this language are basic.  They use /a, e, i, o, u/.  The vowel length is similar to the consonant lengths.  Linguists do not interpret long vowels in writing so they use shortcuts like macrons (a line over the vowel indicating a longer length), but in Tikopia writing they use two identical juxtaposed vowels.  According to the Tikopia dictionary, “This has typographical simplicity, but may present a problem of interpretation as to where long vowel and rearticulation actually occur.

==Grammar==

===Basic Word Order===
The basic word order in Tikopia is Subject-Verb-Object, but sometimes they use the Verb-Subject-Object Typology (Firth, 1985).

===Reduplication===
Tikopia uses partial reduplication and it usually intensifies a verb to make it plural (Firth, 1985).  The suffix “nofo” is added to a verb and it makes the verb that is being acted upon by a subject plural, so it is acted upon by subjects.

==Vocabulary==

===Loanwords===
Throughout the history of the Tikopian language they made contact with the outside world.  During these times, there is a high chance that many words from other languages were borrowed and used in the language known as “loanwords”.  Some of these words are known as native to Tikopia, but the main sources of the borrowing words are from Anuta, Mota, Hawaiian, and most definitely English.
Words derived from English:
*Pakutini- “Pumpkin”
*Atamole- “Watermelon”
*Rais- “Rice”
*Pīni- “Beans”
*Poi- “Tinned Meat”
*Piksha- “Picture”
*Kastom- “Custom”
*Leta- “Letter”

==Endangerment==

===Materials===
Most of the recorded documents on this language come from the linguist Raymond Firth.  Tikopia did not have much documented until the twentieth century where Firth spent three trips to Tikopia.  In 1928 Firth spent a whole year on his first time to Tikopia; he revisited in 1952 for five more months and again in 1966.  Only one person had recorded documents before Firth in 1910, Reverend W. J. Durrad, and he stayed for a duration of 2 months.  With this valuable documentation, Raymond Firth was able to create a dictionary for the Tikopian language, Taranga Fakatikopia Ma Taranga Fakainglisi.  They also have a bible, limited YouTube videos and some song books.

===Vitality===
Tikopia is spoken throughout the Solomon Islands and is very well documented.  Raymond Firth spent a lot of his time making sure that Tikopia did not fall close to being extinct.  He created the dictionary with all his information and it was highly useful.  With his help Tikopia is nowhere near being extinct, therefore, according to ethnologue, Tikiopia is categorized as a developing language.

==Etymology==
Early mentions are ''"'''touron n.''' A tourist, usually an annoying one. —"Say wha?", [[The Washington Post]], September 20, 1987"''. In 1991 the term was cited in: ''"Over at U.S. 192 and State Road 535, westbound touron — (a combo of tourists and morons, according to a local dj) are constantly making sudden [[U-turn]]s from the left lane, causing oodles of rear-end wrecks. —"The Road Toad," [[Orlando Sentinel]], September 29, 1991"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tourists acting as ''Tourons'' can drive erratically. A common occurrence is to see vehicles stopped in the middle of the road at the very first sighting of [[deer]]. Drivers and occupants leave the vehicle to take pictures, backing traffic up for miles. The term is used as humor to defend against the usual aggravation of continued exposure to tourists by even local residents of tourist areas.&lt;ref name="Colorado" /&gt;

It has been argued that everyone is a ''touron'' outside their own home and away from familiar surroundings.&lt;ref name="Colorado" /&gt; Just being a traveler in a foreign location could make one a touron.&lt;ref name="The Great Touron King"&gt;{{cite web

You yourself have likely been a touron at one time or another.''" Tourists become touronic out of an innocent reaction to places they have never been due to a greater curiosity.&lt;ref name="The Great Touron King" /&gt;
