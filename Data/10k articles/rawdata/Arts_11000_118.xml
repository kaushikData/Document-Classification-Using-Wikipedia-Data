'''Adolf Iosifovich Charlemagne''', or '''Sharleman''' (Russian: Адольф Иосифович Шарлемань; 8 December 1826, [[Saint Petersburg]] - 31 January 1901, Saint Petersburg) was a Russian painter of historical, [[Genre art|genre]] and battle scenes. He was also the creator of a popular design for playing cards known as the "[[Russian playing cards#Design|Satin Deck]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukrcards.com.ua/poleznoe-show-5.html Brief biography] @ House of Cards.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
His father was the architect, {{ill|Iosif Ivanovich Charlemagne|ru|Шарлемань, Иосиф Иванович}}. His grandfather, the sculptor and decorative artist, Jean-Baptiste Charlemagne-Baudet (1734-1789), was originally from [[Rouen]] and had come to Russia to work for [[Catherine the Great]].&lt;ref name="R"&gt;[http://www.artsait.ru/art/sh/sharleman/main.htm Brief biography] @ Russian Paintings.&lt;/ref&gt; His brother, [[Iosif Iosifovich Charlemagne|Iosif]], also became an artist and architect.

He received his primary education at [[Saint Peter's School]], then enrolled at the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]], where he studied history painting with [[Fyodor Bruni]] and battle painting with [[Bogdan Willewalde]].&lt;ref name="R" /&gt; While there, he was awarded several silver and gold medals.

The last of these awards, in 1855, carried with it a stipend to study abroad. He went to Munich, where he studied with [[Alexander Kotzebue]], another battle painter. In 1859, he was named an "Academician" for his portrayals of [[Alexander Suvorov]] in the Swiss Alps. He then went to Paris and studied the paintings at [[Versailles]]. He returned to Saint Petersburg by way of Germany in 1861.

His first paintings after returning were for the [[Page Corps]], followed by ceiling murals at the [[Meshchersky|Meshchersky family]] mansion in Moscow.&lt;ref name="R" /&gt; In 1867, his portrayal of Catherine the Great in the workshop of [[Étienne Maurice Falconet]] earned him the title of Professor. It was acquired by Empress [[Maria Alexandrovna (Marie of Hesse and by Rhine)|Maria Alexandrovna]]. For the next twenty years, he worked prolifically to supply the demand for his images; many of which became illustrations in magazines. From 1871, he worked for the [[Goznak|Federal State Unitary Enterprise]], designing securities, bonds and other negotiables.&lt;ref name="R" /&gt;

'''''Akua'ba''''' are wooden ritual [[fertility]] [[doll]]s from [[Ghana]] and nearby areas. The best known ''akua'ba'' are those of the [[Ashanti people]], whose ''akua'ba'' have large, disc-like heads. Other tribes in the region (f.ex. [[Lobi people]]) have their own distinctive style of ''akua'ba''.

Traditionally, these dolls are carried on the back of women either hoping to [[pregnancy|conceive a child]], or to ensure the attractiveness of the child being carried. When not in active use, the ''akua'ba'' would be ritually washed and cared for.

Today, one is more likely to see a [[mass production|mass-produced]] ''akua'ba'' for sale as a souvenir than an heirloom in ritual use. Traditional use does, however, continue in some areas. The form of the ''akua'ba'' has also gained currency as a general symbol of good [[luck]].

'''Alberto Randegger''' (13 April 1832 – 18 December 1911) was an Italian-born composer, conductor and singing teacher, best known for promoting [[opera]] and new works of British music in England during the [[Victorian era]] and for his widely used textbook on singing technique.

==Life and career==
Randegger was born in [[Trieste]], [[Italy]], the son of musician mother and schoolteacher father. He met [[Giuseppe Verdi]] in Trieste, in 1850, and later became known as a great interpreter of Verdi's operas.&lt;ref&gt;"Alberto Randegger". ''The Musical Times and Singing Class Circular'', Vol. 40, No. 680, 1 October 1899, pp. 653-58&lt;/ref&gt; He was a pupil of Jean Lafont in piano and of [[Luigi Ricci (composer)|Luigi Ricci]] in composition.&lt;ref name="Colby, Williams 1914, p. 539"&gt;{{NIE |inline=1 |title=Randegger, Alberto |year=1914 |edition=2nd |volume=19 |page=539 |url=https://hdl.handle.net/2027/njp.32101064517277?urlappend=%3Bseq=615}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career===
His earliest compositions were masses and other pieces of church music and, with two other young pupils of Ricci, produced two [[ballet]]s and an [[opera]], ''Il Lazzarone,'' in 1852. In 1854 he composed another opera, ''Bianca Capello'', at [[Brescia]].&lt;ref name="Colby, Williams 1914, p. 539"/&gt; During this period, he also served as music director of theatres in [[Fiume]], [[Senigallia]], Brescia and [[Venice]].&lt;ref name=Grove&gt;Grove, George, et al. "Alberto Randegger". ''Grove Music Online''. ''Oxford Music Online''. Retrieved on 16 June 2008. (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;

Randegger began work in London as an organist at St. Paul's in [[Regent's Park]] from his arrival there, in 1854, until 1879.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Beginning in 1857, he conducted Italian opera at the [[St. James's Theatre]].&lt;ref name="Colby, Williams 1914, p. 539"/&gt;  He also became well known as a teacher of singing in [[London]], both privately and at the [[Royal College of Music]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Beginning in 1868, he was conductor at the Wolverhampton Festival.   The same year, he was appointed [[professor]] of singing at the [[Royal Academy of Music]],&lt;ref name="Colby, Williams 1914, p. 539"/&gt; where he was appointed a director and a member of the committee of management.  He continued teaching at both the College and the Academy until his death.&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt;  His notable pupils included sopranos [[Liza Lehmann]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Baker | first = Theodore | contribution = Lehmann, Liza | year = 1992 | title = Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Musicians, Eighth Edition | editor-last = Slonimsky | editor-first = Nicolas | pages = 1030–31 | place = New York | publisher = Schirmer Books | isbn = 0-02-872415-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greta Williams]]&lt;ref&gt;Wyndham, Henry Saxe &amp; L'Epine, Geoffrey (1915).

As a composer, in addition to his early works, Randegger wrote a [[comic opera]], ''The Rival Beauties'' (1864);&lt;ref name="Colby, Williams 1914, p. 539"/&gt; the vocal scenas Medea (1869); a musical play with dramatist [[W.

He also edited several collections of vocal music and collaborated with [[T. J. H. Marzials]] on the libretto for [[Arthur Goring Thomas]]'s opera ''[[Esmeralda (opera)|Esmeralda]]'' (1883).

===Carl Rosa and later years===
[[File:Alberto Randegger 001.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Randegger {{circa|1893}}]]
Randegger served as musical director of the [[Carl Rosa Opera Company]] from 1879 to 1885,&lt;ref name="Colby, Williams 1914, p. 539"/&gt; helping to revive interest in opera in England. In 1880, [[George Grove]] wrote: "The careful way in which the pieces are put on the stage, the number of rehearsals, the eminence of the performers and the excellence of the performers have begun to bear their legitimate fruit, and the Carl Rosa Opera Company bids fair to become a permanent English institution."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carlrosaopera.co.uk/history/index.asp Information from the Carl Rosa history page]&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the resignation of [[Julius Benedict]] in 1881, he also became conductor of the Norwich Musical Festival, which he directed until 1905.  There he conducted new works by Cowen, J. F. Barnett, Stanford, [[Alexander Mackenzie (composer)|Alexander Mackenzie]], Prout, Parry, [[Edward German]] and others, and at the 1905 Festival invited 14 British composers to conduct performances of their own works.&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt;  From 1885 to 1887, he also conducted [[Henry David Leslie|Henry Leslie]]'s Choir.  He conducted the Queen's Hall Choral Society and the first two seasons of symphony concerts at Queen's Hall from 1895 to 1897.&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt;   Finally, from 1887 to 1898, he conducted at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] and at the [[Royal Opera House]], where he became known for his performances of [[Wagner]], Verdi and [[Mozart]] operas.

Randegger's most important legacy, outside of his conducting, was a textbook entitled ''Singing'', published in 1879 by [[Novello &amp; Co]], which is still used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Johnson|first= Keith|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p174416|pure_url=yes}} |title=Alberto Randegger Biography| year=2006 |accessdate=21 May 2008 |publisher= ''Allmusic''}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1882, Randegger was elected an honorary member of the [[Royal Philharmonic Society]].

Randegger was married first to the actress [[Adeline Hayden Coffin|Adeline de Leuw]] whom he divorced in 1892 (and who later married [[Hayden Coffin]]), and on 11 March 1897 he married the American singer [[Louise Baldwin]] (her second marriage).&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1897/03/23/102059211.pdf NY Times article about Randegger's marriage to Baldwin, dated March 23, 1897]&lt;/ref&gt;

Randegger died at his home in London at the age of 79.

The '''''Apparition of Christ to the Virgin''''' is a painting by the Italian Renaissance master [[Filippino Lippi]], executed around 1493 and now housed in the [[Alte Pinakothek]] of [[Munich]], [[Germany]].

The work dates to around to the period after Lippi's return to [[Florence]] after his works in the [[Carafa Chapel]] at [[Rome]]. It is perhaps to be identified with the panel mentioned by the Renaissance art historian [[Giorgio Vasari]] in the church of  San Francesco al Palco of [[Prato]]. In the 19th century, [[Ludwig I of Bavaria]] acquired the paintings, which later, together with the other royal collections,  was included in the Alte Pinakothek.

==Description==
The painting portrays Mary kneeling under the God, shown in a golden disc amongst the clouds in the sky. She is flanked by the apparitions of the Angel of the Annunciation and the Virgin Mary. The unusual iconography was perhaps a precise request of the commissioners, who would be also referenced by the monastery on the hill at the left.

Mary, according to the preachings by [[Girolamo Savonarola]] which were popular in Florence at the time, is aged and with a dramatic expression on her face. Her larger figure is perhaps connected to the particular worship she received in the original location of the painting.

The landscape in the background is depicted using [[aerial perspective]], with echoes of the [[early Netherlandish paintings]] through Italian predecessors of Filippino, including his father [[Filippo Lippi]]. There are some small characters such as a few monks, depicted on a river view (perhaps the [[Bisenzio (river)|Bisenzio]] near Florence) commanded by rocky formations on the right. Far away is a misty city, identifiable most likely with Florence due to the presence of a large dome resembling that of  [[Cathedral of Florence|Santa Maria del Fiore]].

The panel has a [[predella]] with ''Christ Hold by an Angel and Six Saints''.

The Birmingham engravers enabled the expansion of the scope of illustrated books and magazines to include the works of artists such as [[J. M. W. Turner]], greatly increasing the exposure of contemporary art.&lt;ref name="Hartnell" /&gt;

==Members==
The existence of the Birmingham School as a distinctive group within the wider field of engraving was first recognised with the ''Exhibition of Engravings by Birmingham Men'' held at the [[Royal Birmingham Society of Artists]] in 1877. This exhibition featured work by the following engravers:&lt;ref name="Hill"&gt;{{Citation|last=Hill|first=Joseph|year=1907|title=The book makers of old Birmingham; authors, printers, and book sellers|publication-place=Birmingham|publisher=Printed at the Shakespeare Press for Cornish Bros.|pages=6–7|oclc=3773421}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Charles S. Roberts Awards''' (or '''CSR Awards''') was an annual award for excellence in the historical [[wargaming]] hobby. It was named in honor of [[Charles S. Roberts]] the "Father of Wargaming" who founded [[Avalon Hill]]. The award was informally called a "Charlie" and officially called a "Charles S. Roberts Award". ''[[The Wargamer (magazine)|The Wargamer]]'' magazine called it "very prestigious".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wargamer.com/article/2857/industry-news-voting-for-the-charles-s-roberts-award-now-open |title=Industry News: Voting for the Charles S Roberts Award Now Open |work=[[The Wargamer (magazine)|The Wargamer]] |author=Scott Parrino |date=15 April 2010 |accessdate=January 17, 2014 |quote=..the very prestigious Charles S Roberts Awards has started. |archiveurl=https://archive.is/6AqKU |archivedate=18 January 2014 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Created at the first Origins Game Convention in 1975, the awards were the "brainchild of Canadian hobbyist John Mansfield."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Evolution of Origins: The National Convention af Five |journal=[[Moves (magazine)|Moves]] |author1=John Prados |date=June 1979 |volume= |number=45 |page=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Mansfield, resident of [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]] and long time gamer, is manager of Pendragon Games &amp; Hobbies as of 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally the awards were the [[Origins Awards]] but were informally known as the ''Charles Roberts Awards''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Evolution of Origins: The National Convention af Five |journal=[[Moves (magazine)|Moves]] |author1=John Prados |date=June 1979 |volume= |number=45 |page=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was only in 1988 that Charles Roberts officially agreed to let his name be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alanemrich.com/CSR_pages/CSR_Awards_Home.htm |title=CSR Awards Authorization |publisher=CSR website |author=Charles S.

Fortress America was not considered a traditional historical wargame by the older members in the wargaming community. Prior to 2000, the awards were given at the [[Origins Game Fair]]. Since 2000, the awards were given at the [[World Boardgaming Championships]] (formerly "AvalonCon"). The Award was managed by the Charles S. Roberts Award Committee with winners chosen by votes submitted by fans.

The Awards also included the [[Charles Roberts Awards Hall of Fame]] which recognized game designers and producers that have made a significant and long lasting contribution to the contemporary board wargaming hobby.

The last year the awards were given was 2012.

The '''Comedy Theatre of Budapest''' ({{lang-hu|Vígszínház}}) is a theatre in [[Budapest]]. Starting in the turn of the 19th and 20th century as an opposition to the conservative [[National Theatre (Budapest)|National Theatre]], it became a pioneer institution of [[Hungary|Hungarian]] drama, and one of the oldest theatres of the city still in operation.

== The building ==

The Vígszínház was designed by architects [[Fellner &amp; Helmer|Ferdinand Fellner and Hermann Helmer]] who worked on over 47 state-of-the-art theatre buildings around [[Europe]]. Its construction was financed by the tripartite ownership consisting of Count István [[House of Keglević|Keglevich]], the writer [[Ferenc Szécsi]], and local businessman [[Gábor Faludi]]. I The destined area was a swampland before, but in the next few years it developed into the bourgeois [[Lipótváros]] district. The construction started in 1895 and lasted for one year, finishing on 1 May 1896. With 3 main tracts: the stage, including the flies; the lower seating tract; and the entry hall; the building exemplifies late historicism, featuring large sizes, an elevated driveway and baroque decorations, often using golden coloring. As a distinct feature from contemporary theatres, the Vígszínház featured three rows of box seats, large corridors and public areas supported by several wide stairs to answer the call of rising social life in the rapidly developing Budapest.

== History ==
[[File:H budapest vigszinhaz 2.jpg|180px|left|thumb|The Comedy Theatre in 1904]]
Mór Ditrói was the first director, coming from [[Cluj-Napoca|Kolozsvár]] (today Cluj-Napoca). He also brought his company of young actors, who were unknown to the Budapest audience at the time. They quickly created a unique and modern repertoire differing from the era's classical theatre, that featured both French comedies, contemporary Hungarian (starting the career of [[Ferenc Molnár]], [[Sándor Bródy (writer)|Sándor Bródy]], or [[Jenő Heltai]]), and foreign (like from [[Irwine Shaw]], [[Bertold Brecht]], [[Anton Chekhov]]) dramas. The Vígszínház provided starting ground and home for several of the biggest names of the theatrical world from the turn of the century, like [[Gyula Csortos]], [[Lili Darvas]], [[Lili Muráti]], [[Artur Somlay]], [[Klári Tolnay]] or [[Gyula Kabos]].

In the last days of [[World War II]], Jan 1 1945 the theatre was hit by bombshells, so the company moved to the ''Radius Movie Theatre'' in the Nagymező Street. The repairs began under the supervision of Oszkár Kaufmann. Along with other similar artistic institution, Vígszínház was nationalized in 1949 (before this time, it operated as a private theatre). It reopened in 1951 under the name ''Theatre of the People's Army''. Regaining its original name in 1960, Vígszínház became the main center of contemporary drama again, showing plays from Hungarian authors like Gábor Thurzó, [[Gyula Illyés]], [[István Örkény]], or classical 20th century authors like [[Arthur Miller]] or [[Friedrich Dürrenmatt]] . In 1973 they premiered the popular ''Képzelt riport egy amerikai popfesztiválról'' ([[An Imaginary Report on an American Rock Festival]]), resulting in several other musical productions under the supervision of [[Gábor Presser]]. The building underwent significant repairs in 1994.

With an average of 350.000 tickets sold each year, Vígszínház is still one of the most successful theatrical venues in Budapest.

== Pesti Színház ==

'''Pesti Színház Theatre''', the chamber theater of [[Vígszínház]], is located in the 5th district. (address: Váci str. 9) Its auditorium’s capacity is 538 persons.

Pesti Színház Theatre was built in 1840, based on the plans of architect [[József Hild]]. Now the building is protected by the law of National Monuments Inspectorate. Initially there was an elegant coffee house with marble columns in the tract opens to the Aranykéz street. The upper floors originally accommodated private apartments, but these were rebuilt for suites of Hotel National. In 1902 a new recostruction program began and the premises of Cinema Corso occupied the ground floor.

In 1936–37 the building was reconstructed again and the auditorium of the Corso Cinema was expanded. In World War II almost the whole building was destroyed. The restoration started only in 1945 and some years later the cinema was renamed to Bartók Hall.

From 1967 Pesti Színház Theatre is the chamber theatre of Vígszínház with the same company. Its a venue for plays with a more intimate atmosphere. The Pesti Színház Theatre also has several English and American successes, musicals and children-plays to its credit. The building was renovated in 2009 in a modern style.

'''Communications Update / Cast Iron TV''' was a weekly artist-run television series which ran on Manhattan [[cable TV]] [[Public-access television]] channel D from 1979&lt;ref name="escitnytimes"&gt;{{cite news|last=Schneider|first=Steven|title=Experimentation Shapes Cast Iron TV|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/14/arts/cable-tv-notes-experimentation-shapes-cast-iron-tv.html?n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fSubjects%2fT%2fTelevision#|accessdate=24 April 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=14 April 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;  through 1992.

Its initial aim was to provide an alternative source of information and an alternative approach to questions often slighted or ignored by broadcast TV.  Topics included video verité of the cable franchising process, home satellite TV, and third world views on communications control.&lt;ref&gt;McGowan, MaryAnne. (January 1983). "Cable Review Lounge". The Kitchen press release&lt;/ref&gt;

As the number of artist producers expanded, so did the style and subject matter of the shows, which ranged from political documentary to satire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Béar|first=Liza|title=Communications Update|url=http://communicationsupdate.blogspot.com/search?updated-max=2011-04-02T23%3A37%3A00-04%3A00&amp;max-results=7|accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Communications Update subsequently focused on works which explored the relationship between documentary and drama, not conforming to either but drawing from both.&lt;ref name="afterimage"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thomson|first=Pat|title=Independents on Television|journal=Afterimage|date=Summer 1983|volume=11|issue=10, 11|pages=28–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1983, the series was renamed Cast Iron TV to reflect its changing orientation as a forum for experimental video makers.  Programs in  the series included artists' segments commissioned or made specifically for the show,  as well as previously existing video works.&lt;ref name="escitnytimes" /&gt; Milli Iatrou coordinated the series for two years from 1984 to 1986.  [[Terese Svoboda]] followed her, continuing the series for four years until 1990 when Betsy Newman took over for two years until 1992.
Communications Update / Cast Iron TV was eventually considered to fall under the rubric of "alternative television"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thomson|first=Patrice|title=Television Art|journal=ARTCOM|date=Fall 1983|volume=6|issue=2|pages=56–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;  or "artists' television."

== History ==
In September 1979, [[Liza Bear]], cofounder of Avalanche magazine and of Send/Receive Satellite Network, initiated a 10-week series  entitled the "WARC Report" on the World Administrative Radio Conference then taking place in Geneva. Co-producers were Michael McClard and Willoughby Sharp in New York,  and Rolf Brand in Geneva. A slow-scan link for relaying images on phone lines was set up between Geneva and New York.  
The impetus for producing the series, according to Bear, was the fact that "the TV media was not covering communications issues and we felt that it had to be done."  When WARC ended, still concerned with public telecommunications policies and the uses of the new technology,  the program was renamed Communications Update; it continued to run in the same 7:30 pm, post-news time slot.&lt;ref name="artforum"&gt;{{cite journal|last=White|first=Robin|title=Great Expectations: Artists' TV Guide|journal=Artforum International|date=May 1982|volume=20|issue=10|pages=40–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After its initial season, Communications Update began to shift its emphasis.  Bear explains, "I didn't want to go on just becoming a lexicon or dictionary of new technology or new political policy problems."  While retaining its documentary mode, Communications Update began to develop as an outlet for programs made by individuals attempting to gain an "active role in the making of information as artists and citizens."&lt;ref name="afterimage"/&gt;

By 1982, the programs in the series had a broad range of styles and concerns from documentary to abstract fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hulser|first=Kathleen|title=Artists Gain Access to Cable|journal=Videography|date=January 1985|volume=10|issue=1|pages=70–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;    A lot of the shows attempted to expose the manipulation carried out by television.  For example, "The Very Reverend Deacon b. Peachy," by Ron Morgan and Milli Iatrou, was about a tele-evangelist newly arrived in New York who finds his moral intentions subverted by the economic imperatives of the medium and its technology.&lt;ref name="artforum"/&gt;

Several of the productions that originated on Communications Update / Cast Iron TV have been shown in video festivals in Bonn, Bologna and The Hague, as well as [[The Museum of Modern Art]], The American Museum of the Moving Image,&lt;ref name="escitnytimes"/&gt; [[The Kitchen]] and the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]].

'''Decalcomania''' (from the French ''décalcomanie'') is a decorative technique by which engravings and prints may be transferred to pottery or other materials. Today, the shortened version is "[[decal]]."

==Origins==
[[File:Decalcomania Advertisement by W. Atkinson &amp; Co.png|400px|thumb|Advertisement for the decalcomania process in the 1870 New York City directory.]]
Decalcomania was invented in England about 1750 and imported into the United States at least as early as 1865. Its invention has been attributed to [[Simon François Ravenet]], an engraver from France who later moved to England and perfected the process, which he called "''décalquer''" (derived from French ''papier de calque'', "tracing paper").{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} The first known use of the French term ''décalcomanie'', in [[Mary Elizabeth Braddon]]'s ''Eleanor's Victory'' (1863), was followed by the English ''decalcomania'' in an 1865 trade show catalog (''The Tenth Exhibition of the [[Massachusetts Charitable Mechanic Association]]''); it was popularized during the ceramic transfer craze of the mid-1870s. By ''c'' 1875 decalcomania designs printed in colored glazes were being applied to [[porcelain]], an extension of [[transfer-printing]], which had been developed in England since the late 18th century. The decalcomania was applied over an already-glazed surface and re-fired. The process began to be mechanized from the turn of the 20th century.

==Artists==
The [[Surrealist art|surrealist]] [[Oscar Domínguez]] referred to his work as "decalcomania with no preconceived object." He took up the technique in 1936, using [[gouache]] spread thinly on a sheet of paper or other surface (glass has been used), which is then pressed onto another surface such as a [[canvas]]. Dominguez used black gouache, though colours later made their appearance.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

German artist [[Max Ernst]] also practised decalcomania, as did [[Hans Bellmer]] and [[Remedios Varo]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

French surrealist [[Yves Tanguy]] used the technique in his 1936 works, ''Paysage I'' and ''Paysage II'', which were included in the [[Guggenheim Museum]]'s exhibition, "Surrealism: Two Private Eyes" (4 June – 12 September 1999, New York).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.guggenheim.org/publication/surrealism-two-private-eyes |title=Surrealism: Two Private Eyes |date=6 August 1999 |website=Guggenheim  |access-date=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Versions==
In the 1950s and early 1960s, [[King Features Syndicate]] marketed a set of decalcomanias bearing full-color pictures of characters from its [[comic strips]], including [[Flash Gordon]], [[the Katzenjammer Kids]], and [[Dagwood Bumstead]]. Intended for young children who might have difficulty pronouncing or reading the word "decalcomanias," these transfers were marketed as "Cockamamies," a deliberate mispronunciation. The term "cockamamy" or "cockamamie" has entered the English language with various slang meanings, usually denoting something that is wacky, strange or unusual. However, the expression "cockamamie" is attested by 1946, and reportedly as early as the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/cockamamie | title=Origin and meaning of cockamamie |website=Online Etymology Dictionary  |access-date=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fractals===
The production of decalcomanias has not been confined to art. At [[Yale University]] [[fingerpaint]] decalcomanias have been analysed for their tendency, when the process is repeated several times on the same paper, to generate [[fractal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://users.math.yale.edu/public_html/People/frame/Fractals/Panorama/Art/Decalcomania/Decalcomania.html |title=Fractal Geometry Panorama |website=Math, Yale University |access-date=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''French Gothic architecture''' is a style which emerged in France in 1140, and was dominant until the mid-16th century. The most notable examples are the great Gothic cathedrals of France, including [[Notre Dame Cathedral]], [[Chartres Cathedral]], and [[Amiens Cathedral]].  Its main characteristics were the search for verticality, or height, and the innovative use of [[flying buttress]]es and other architectural innovations to distribute the weight of the stone structures to supports on the outside, allowing unprecedented height and volume,  The new techniques also permitted the addition of larger windows, including enormous stained glass windows, which filled the cathedrals with light.  The French style was widely copied in other parts of northern Europe, particularly Germany and England.  It was gradually supplanted as the dominant French style in the mid-16th century by [[French Renaissance architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;Ducher, Robert, ''Caractéristique des Styles'' (1988), pages 46-54&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
French Gothic architecture was the result of the emergence in the 12th century of powerful French state centered in the [[Ile-de-France]]. During the reign of [[Louis VI of France]] (1081-1137),  Paris was the principal residence of the Kings of France, [[Reims]]  the place of coronation, and the [[Abbey of Saint-Denis]] became their ceremonial burial place.  The Abbot of Saint-Denis,  [[Suger]], was a counselor of Louis VI and Louis VII, as well as an historian.  He oversaw the reconstruction of the ambulatory of Saint-Denis, making it the first and most influential example of Gothic architecture in France.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé (2006), pg. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the later course of the [[Capetian dynasty]] (1180 to 1328), three Kings; [[Philip Augustus]] (1180-1223); [[Louis IX of France]] (1226-1270) and [[Philip le Bel]] (1285-1314) established France as the major economic and political power on the Continent. The period also saw the founding of the University of Paris or [[Sorbonne]].  It produced the high Gothic and the Flamboyant Gothic styles, and the construction of some of the most famous cathedrals, including [[Chartres Cathedral]], [[Reims Cathedral]], and [[Amiens Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé (2006), pg. 33-35&lt;/ref&gt;

===The rib vault===
The Gothic style emerged from innovative use of existing technologies, such as the pointed arch and the [[rib vault]].   The [[rib vault]] was known in the earlier Romanesque period, but it was not widely or effectively used until the Gothic period.  The crossed ribs of the vault carried the weight outwards and downwards, to clusters of supporting pillars and columns.  The earlier rib vaults, used at [[Sens Cathedral]] and [[Notre-Dame Cathedral]], had six compartments bordered by ribs and the crossing arch, which transferred the weight to alternating columns and pillars.  A new innovation appeared during the High Gothic: the four-part rib vault, which was used in [[Chartres Cathedral]], [[Amiens Cathedral]] and [[Reims Cathedral]].  The ribs of this vault distributed the weight more equally to the four supporting pillars below, and established a closer connection  between the nave and the lower portions of the church walls, and between the arcades below and the windows above. This allowed for greater height and thinner walls, and contributed to the strong impression of verticality given by the newer Cathedrals.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé (2006), page 34&lt;/ref&gt;

===The flying buttress===
The second major innovation of the Gothic style was the [[flying buttress]], which was first used at [[Notre Dame Cathedral]]. This transferred the thrust of the weight of the roof outside the walls, where it was countered by the weight of the buttress.  Heavy stone pinnacles were added to the top of the buttresses, to precisely counterbalance the thrust from inside the walls. The buttress allowed a significant reduction in the thickness of the cathedral walls, and permitted the use of larger windows in the interior of the church.   In churches such as [[Sainte Chapelle]], thanks to buttresses, the walls were made almost entirely of stained glass.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé (2006), page 34&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of rib-vaults and buttresses brought gradual changes to the interior structure of cathedrals.  Early Gothic cathedrals had the walls of the nave built in four levels,  a gallery with columns on the ground level; then the tribune, a gallery with windows; then the triforium, a row of smaller windows, and finally the high windows. just below the vaults.   During the high Gothic period, with the development of the four part rib vault and the flying buttress, the tribune was eliminated at Chartres and other new cathedrals, allowing taller windows and arcades. By the 15th century, at Rouen Cathedral, the triforium also disappeared, and the walls between the traverses were filled with high windows.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé (2006), pages 48-49&lt;/ref&gt;

===The portal and tympanum===
Another innovative feature of the French Gothic cathedral  was the design of the portal or entry, which by long Christian tradition faced west. The [[Basilica of St Denis]] had a triple portal, decorated with columns in the form of statues of apostles and saints around the doorways, and biblical scenes crowded with statuary over the doorways.  This  triple portal was adopted by all the major cathedrals.  A [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]]  over the portal, crowded with sculptural figures illustrating  a biblical story became a feature of Gothic cathedrals. Following the example of Amiens, the tympanum over the central portal traditionally depicted the [[Last Judgement]], the right portal showed the coronation of the Virgin Mary, and the left portal showed the lives of saints who were important in the diocese.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé (2006), page 35&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stained glass and the rose window===

Large [[stained glass]] windows and [[rose windows]] were another defining feature of the Gothic style.  Some Gothic windows, like those at Chartres, were cut into the stone walls. Other windows, such as those in the chapels of Notre-Dame and Reims, were in stone frames installed into the walls.  The most common form was an oculus, a small round window with two lancets, or windows with pointed arches, just below it.  The [[Rose window]] was the most famous type of the Gohtic style.  They were plead in the transepts and the portals to provide light to the nave. The largest rose windows were ten meters in diameter.  They had a framework of stone armatures often in an ornate floral pattern, to help them resist the wind.  Gothic windows were in a stone frame separate from the wall, not cut into the wall.

The early windows were made of pieces of tinted glass, touched up with grisaille painting, and held in place by pieces of lead that outlined the figures. As the windows grew larger, more intense colors were used.  After 1260, the colors became lighter, and the combination of  [[grisaille]] and pale shades of yellow became more common.  [[Chartres Cathedral]] and [[Le Mans Cathedral]] have some of the finest surviving original windows.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé (2006), page 52&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequence of Gothic styles==
The periods of French Gothic architecture are generally given as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Wenzler (2018), pgs. 31-17&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Early Gothic''' '''Transition''' or '''Primitive Gothic''' (1130-1230)
* '''High Gothic''' or '''Classic Gothic''' (1230-1330)
* '''[[Rayonnant]]'''  (14th Century)
* '''[[Flamboyant]]''' (15th Century)
* '''Late Gothic'''  (16th Century)

Because of the lengthy period of construction of Gothic Cathedrals, very few were built in a single style.  Most, like Notre Dame, have a combination of features constructed in several different periods, as well as features constructed after the Gothic age.

==Early Gothic Style - Saint-Denis, Sens, Senlis, and Notre Dame==

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The birthplace of the new style was the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]] in the [[Île-de-France]], not far north of Paris,  where in 1137 The [[Abbé Suger]] began the reconstruction of the [[Carolingian]]-era abbey church. He began building a new structure with two towers to the west of the original church, and then from  1140 to 1144  began to reconstruct the old church. Most of his modifications were traditional, but he made one remarkable innovation; he decided to create a new choir at the east end of the building, eliminating the traditional supporting walls of the old chapels, giving the interior a striking appearance of openness and greater height.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher, Robert, ''Caractéristique des Styles'' (1988), pages 46-54&lt;/ref&gt;

To achieve his aims, Suger's masons drew on the several new elements which evolved or had been introduced to Romanesque architecture: the [[pointed arch]]; the ribbed [[Vault (architecture)|vault]]; the [[ambulatory]] with radiating chapels; and the columns wrapped in the ribs which supported the vaults.   The builders constructed the walls of the church in four levels;  the [[Arcade (architecture)|arcades]], whose two rows of columns received the ribs of the ceiling vaults; the tribune above it, a gallery which concealed the massive contreforts or buttresses which pressed against the walls; the [[triforium]], another, narrower gallery;  and, just below the ceiling, the ''claire-voie'' or [[clerestorey]], where the windows were located.  All of these features had existed in the Romanesque period, but it was the first time had all been combined and the result differed  dramatically  from the previous Romanesque architecture.  Another innovation introduced by Suger was the use of columns in the form of statues of saints to decorate the portal of the church, adding a new element of verticality to the facade. This idea too was copied in new cathedrals.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé (2006), page 36&lt;/ref&gt;

The new style quickly became known to the builders of new cathedrals, notably [[Sens Cathedral]], the first Gothic Cathedral  (begun 1135); [[Senlis Cathedral]] (1160), and the most prominent of all, [[Notre Dame Cathedral]] in Paris (begun 1160). Their builders abandoned the traditional plans and introduced the new  Gothic elements.  The builders of Notre Dame went further by introducing the [[flying buttress]], heavy columns of support outside the walls connected by arches to the walls, which received and counterbalanced the thrust from the rib vaults of the roof.  This allowed the builders to construct higher walls and larger windows.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé (2006), page 36&lt;/ref&gt;

==High Gothic Cathedrals: Chartres, Bourges, Reims, Amiens==
&lt;gallery mode="packed" heights="200"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
From the end of the 12th century until the middle of the 13th century, the Gothic style spread from the cathedrals in Île-de-France to appear in other cities of northern France, notably  [[Chartres Cathedral]] (begun 1200); [[Bourges Cathedral]] (1195 to 1230), [[Reims Cathedral]] (1211–1275), and [[Amiens Cathedral]] (begun 1250);&lt;ref&gt;Ducher, ''Caractéristique des Styles'' (1988), pg. 48&lt;/ref&gt; The characteristic Gothic elements were refined to make the new cathedrals taller, wider, and more full of light. At Chartres, the use of the flying buttresses allowed the elimination of the tribune level, which allowed much higher arcades and nave, and larger windows. The pillars were made of a central column surrounded by four more slender columns, which reached up to support the arches of the vaulted ceiling. The [[rib vault]] changed from six to four ribs, simpler and stronger. The [[flying buttress]]es at Amiens and Chartes were strengthened by with an additional arch and with a supporting arcade, allowing even higher and walls and more windows. At Reims, the buttresses were given greater weight and strength by the addition of heavy stone pinacles on top. These were often decorated with statues of angels, and became an important decorative element of the High Gothic style. Another practical and decorative element, the gargoyle, appeared; it was an ornamental rain spout which channeled the water from the roof away from the building. At Amiens, the windows of the nave were made larger, and an additional row of clear glass windows (the claire-voie) flooded the interior with light. The new structural technologies allowed the enlargement of the transepts and the choirs at the east end of the cathedrals, creating the space for a ring of well-lit chapels.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher, ''Caractéristique des Styles'' (1988), pg. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rayonnant Gothic - Sainte-Chapelle and the rose windows of Notre Dame==

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The next period of French gothic architecture, from the second half of the 13th century until the 1370s, was termed ''Rayonnant'' ("Radiant"), describing the tendency  toward the use of more and more stained glass and less masonry in the design of the structure, until the walls seemed entirely made of glass.  The most celebrated example was the chapel of [[Sainte-Chapelle]], attached to the royal residence on the [[Palais de la Cité]].  An elaborate system of exterior columns and arches reduced the walls of the upper chapel to a thin framework for the enormous windows. The weight of each of the masonry gables above the [[archivolt]] of the windows also helped the walls to resist the thrust and to distribute the weight.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988), pg. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

Another landmark of the Rayonnant Gothic are the two rose windows on the north and south of the transept of [[Notre Dame Cathedral]], whereas earlier rose windows, like those of [[Amiens Cathedral]], were framed by stone and occupied only a portion of the wall, these two windows, with a delicate lacelike framework, occupied the entire space between the pillars.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988), pg. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flamboyant Gothic: Rouen Cathedral, Sainte-Chapelle de Vincennes==
&lt;gallery mode="packed" heights="200"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The Flamboyant Gothic style appeared in the second half of the 14th century. Its characteristic features were more exuberant decoration, as the nobles and wealthy citizens of mostly northern French cities competed to build more and more elaborate churches and cathedrals. It took its name from the sinuous, flame-like designs which ornamented windows. Other new features included the ''arc en accolade'', a window decorated with an arch, stone pinnacles and floral sculpture. It also featured an increase in the number of ''nervures'', or ribs, that supported and decorated each vault of the ceiling, both for greater support and decorative effect.  Notable examples of Flamboyant Gothic include the western facade of [[Rouen Cathedral]] and [[Sainte-Chapelle de Vincennes]] in Paris, both built in the 1370s; and the Choir of [[Mont Saint Michel Abbey]] (about 1448).&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé (2006), pg. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous examples of Gothic architecture are found in the [[Île-de-France]] and [[Champagne (province)|Champagne]], but other French regions created their own original versions of the style. The Angevin Gothic style in the province of [[Anjou]] features a vaults with elegant decorative ribs, as well as very ornate columns.  The style is found in the interior of [[Angers Cathedral]] (1032–1523), though many of the Gothic elements of the facade were replaced with Renaissance elements and towers. A very fine example of Angevin Gothic is found in the medieval Saint Jean Hospital in Angers, which now contains the Musée Jean-Lurçat, a museum of contemporary tapestries.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988) page 62&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Poitiers Cathedral]] in the historic province of [[Maine (province)|Maine]] also features a distinctive regional Gothic style. It was begun in 1162 under KingH [[Henry II of England]] and [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]]. Its distinctive features, like those of Angevin Gothic, include convex vaults with ribs in decorative designs.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988) page 62&lt;/ref&gt;

Burgundy also had its own version of Gothic, found in [[Nevers Cathedral]] (1211–1331), [[Dijon Cathedral]] (1280–1325), and [[Chalon Cathedral]] (1220–1522). The Burgundian Gothic tended to be more sober and monumental than the more ornate northern style, and often included elements of earlier romanesque churches on the same site.

The south of France had its own distinct variation of the Gothic style : the [[Southern French Gothic]]. A prominent example is [[Albi Cathedral]] in the [[Tarn Department]], built between 1282 and 1480. It was originally constructed as a fortress, then transformed into a church. Due to a lack of suitable stone, it was constructed almost entirely of brick, and is one of the largest brick buildings in the world.

==Gothic civil architecture==

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The largest civic building built in the Gothic style in France was the [[Palais des Papes]] (Palace of the Popes) constructed between 1252 and 1364, when the Popes fled the political chaos and wars enveloping Rome. Given the complicated political situation, it combined the functions of a church, a seat of government and a fortress.

In the 15th century, following the late Gothic or flamboyant period, some elements of Gothic decoration  borrowed from cathedrals began to appear in civil architecture, particularly in the region of [[Flanders]] in northern France, and in Paris. The Hôtel de Ville of [[Compiègne]] has an imposing  gothic bell tower, featuring a spire surrounded by smaller towers, and its windows are decorated with ornate ''accolades'' or ornamental arches. Similarly flamboyant town halls were found in [[Arras]], [[Douai]], and [[Saint-Quentin, Aisne]], and across the border in Belgium in [[Brussels]] and [[Bruges]]. Unfortunately many of the finest buildings were destroyed during World War I,  due to their proximity to the front lines.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988), page 64&lt;/ref&gt; 
   
Gothic features also appeared in the elaborate residences built by the nobility and wealthy bourgeoisie in Paris and other large cities.  examples include the [[Hôtel Cluny]] (now the [[Musée de Cluny – Musée national du Moyen Âge]]  in Paris, and particularly the palatial house built by merchant [[Jacques Cœur]] in [[Bourges]] (1440–50).  Another good example in Paris is the [[Tour Jean-sans-Peur]],  which features a Gothic watch tower and a flamboyant gothic ceiling.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
During the Middle Ages Prosperous French cities competed to build the largest cathedral or the highest tower. One of the drawbacks of French Gothic architecture was its immense cost; it required small armies of skilled craftsmen working intently for decades. Due to downturns in the economy, a notable number of French cathedrals were begun but never finished. They also sometimes suffered when the ambitions of the architects exceeded their technical skills. One example was [[Beauvais Cathedral]]. Its patrons and architects sought to build the tallest church in the world. with a vaulted choir 48 meters high, taller than its nearby competitor, [[Amiens Cathedral]], at 42 meters. Work began in 1225 but the roof of the vault was too heavy for the walls, and partially collapsed in 1272. They thickened the walls and rebuilt the vault and in 1569 they completed a tower, 72 meters high, which from 1569–1573  made Beauvais Cathedral the tallest structure in the world. However, in 1573, the new tower collapsed, fortunately without any casualties. The church remains today as it was, with the choir, some of the ambulatory, apse, some chapels, but no nave or tower.&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Bonnet-Laborderie, ''La Cathédrale de Beauvais: histoire et architecture'', La Mie-au-Roy, G.E.M.O.B., 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 1530s, the style of French religious and civil architecture also began to show the influence of the [[Italian Renaissance]].  [[Charles VIII of France]] and [[Louis XII of France]] had both participated in military campaigns in Italy, and had seen the new architecture there. Large numbers of Italian stonemasons had come to Paris to work on the new [[Pont Notre-Dame]] (1507–1512) and other construction sites. The [[Fontaine des Innocents]], built by sculptor [[Jean Goujon]] to celebrate the entrance of Henry II into Paris in 1549, was the first Renaissance monument in the city.  It was soon followed by the new facade of the Cour Carré of the [[Louvre]], also decorated by [[Jean Goujon]]. The new Paris [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hotel de Ville]]  (1533–1568) was also constructed in an Italianate rather than Gothic style.  Most important of all, the new [[Tuileries Palace]] by [[Philippe Delorme]], built for [[Catherine de' Medici]], begun in 1564, was inspired by Italian palaces.&lt;ref&gt;Texier (2012) page 26–27)&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious –buildings were slower to change. The Church of the Carmes-Deschaussé (1613–1620) on rue Vaugirard in Paris, and especially the church of [[St-Gervais-et-St-Protais]] by [[Salomon de Brosse]] (1615–21) with a facade based on the superposition of the three orders of classical architecture, represented the new model.  However, the Gothic style remained prominent in new churches.  The Church of [[Saint-Eustache, Paris|Saint Eustache]] in Paris, (1532–1640) which rivaled Notre-Dame in size, combined a gothic plan with renaissance decoration.

In the course of the 17th century, the French classical style of [[François Mansart]] began to dominate; then, under Louis XIV, the grand French classical style, practiced by [[Jules Hardouin-Mansart]], [[Louis Le Vau]], and [[Claude Perrault]], took center stage. Landmarks of the Gothic style, such as Notre-Dame, were modified with new interiors designed in the new style.  Following the new fashion of his patron, Louis XIV, the poet [[Molière]] ridiculed the Gothic style in a 1669 poem: "...the insipid taste of Gothic ornamentation, these odious monstrosities of an ignorant age, produced by the torrents of barbarism...".

During the [[French Revolution]], Gothic churches were symbols of the old regime and became targets for the Revolutionaries;  the cathedrals were nationalized, and stripped of ornament and valuables.  The statues of the Biblical figures on the facade of Notre-Dame were beheaded, under the false belief they were statues of the French Kings.  Under [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], the cathedrals were returned to the church, but were left in a lamentable state of repair.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
In the 13th century, the design of the ''chateau fort'', or castle, was modified, based on the Byzantine and Moslem castles the French knights had seen during the [[Crusades]].   The new kind of fortification was called Phillipienne, after [[Philippe Auguste]], who had taken part in the Crusades. The new fortifications were more geometric, usually square, with a high main ''donjon'' or tower, in the center, which could be defended even if the walls of the castle were captured.  The Donjon of the [[Chateau de Vincennes]], begun by [[Philip VI of France]], was a good example.  It was 52 meters high, the tallest military tower in Europe.

In the Phillipienne castle other towers, usually round  were placed at the corners and along the walls, close enough together to support each other.  The walls had two levels of walkways on the inside, an upper parapet with openings (''Crénaux'') from which soldiers could watch or fire  arrows on besiegers below; narrow openings  (''Merlons'') through which they could be sheltered as they fired arrows; and floor openings (''Mâchicoulis''), from which they could drop rocks, burning oil or other objects on the besiegers. The upper walls also had protected protruding balconies, ''Échauguettes'' and ''Bretéches'', from which soldiers could see what was happening at the corners or on the ground below.  In addition, the towers and walls were pierced with narrow vertical slits, called ''Meurtriéres'', through which archers could fire arrows. In later castles the slits took the form of crosses, so that archers could fire ''arbalètes'', or [[crossbows]], in different directions.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988), pgs. 66-67&lt;/ref&gt;

Castles were surrounded by deep moat, spanned by a single drawbridge.  The entrance was also protected by a grill of iron which could be opened and closed.    The walls at the bottom were often sloping, and protected with earthen barriers, to  One good surviving example is the [[Château de Dourdan]] in the Seine-et-Marne department, near [[Nemours]].&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé (2006), pg. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

After the end of the [[Hundred Years War]] (1337-1453), with improvements in artillery, the castles lost most of their military importance. They remained as symbols of the rank of their noble occupants;  the narrowing openings in the walls were often widened into the windows of bedchambers and ceremonial halls.   The tower of the Chateau of Vincennes became a royal residence.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé (2006), pg. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, portions of the Gothic walls and towers of the city of [[Carcasonne]] were restored, with some modification,  by [[Eugene Viollet-le-Duc]].  He also rebuilt the [[Château de Pierrefonds]], (1393-1407)  an unfinished medieval castle, making it into a neo-Gothic residence for [[Napoleon III]]. This project was incomplete when Napoleon III was overthrown in 1870, but can be visited today.

A large part of the Gothic architectural heritage of France, particularly the churches and monasteries, had been damaged or destroyed during the Revolution. Of the 300 churches in Paris in the 16th century, only 97 still were standing in 1800. The [[Basilica of St Denis]] had been stripped of its stained glass and monumental tombs, while the statues on the façade of the cathedral of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] had been beheaded and taken down. Throughout the country, churches and monasteries had been demolished or turned into barns, cafes, schools, or prisons. The first effort to catalog the remaining monuments was made in 1816 by Alexandre de Laborde, who wrote the first list of "Monuments of France". In 1831 interest in Gothic architecture grew even greater following the huge popular success of the romantic novel ''[[Notre-Dame de Paris (novel)|Notre-Dame de Paris]]'' by [[Victor Hugo]]. In 1832 Hugo wrote an article for the ''Revue des deux Mondes'' which declared war against the "massacre of ancient stones" and the "demolishers" of France's past. Louis Philippe declared that restoration of churches and other monuments would be a priority of his regime. In October 1830, the position of Inspector of Historical Monuments had been created by the Interior Minister, [[François Guizot]], a professor of history at the Sorbonne.  In 1833 Prosper Mérimée became its second Inspector, and by far the most energetic and long-lasting. He held the position for twenty-seven years.{{Sfn|Darcos|1998|pages=156–159}}

Under Louis Philippe,French Gothic architecture was officially recognized as a treasure of French culture.  Under Mérimée's direction, the first efforts to restore major Gothic monuments began. In 1835 The church of [[Saint-Séverin, Paris|Saint Séverin]] in Paris was among first to undergo restoration, followed in 1836 by  [[Sainte-Chapelle]],  which had been turned into a storage house for government archives after the Revolution,  The restoration of Saint-Chapelle as led by [[Félix Duban]] with [[Jean-Baptiste Antoine Lassus]] and a young [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]].   In 1843 Lassus and Viollet-le-Duc won the competition for restoration of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] &lt;ref&gt;Darcos (1988), page 156-9&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the rest of the 19th century, all of the major Gothic cathedrals of France underwent extensive restoration.

French Gothic architecture also experienced a modest  revival, largely confined to new churches. Neo-Gothic churches built in Paris included [[Sainte-Clotilde, Paris|Sainte-Clothilde]] by [[Theodore Ballu]] (1841–57);  and [[Saint-Laurent, Paris]] by Simon-Claude-Constant Dufeux (1862–65).  Jean=Baptiste  Lassus became the most prolific neo-Gothic architect in France, constructing Saint-Nicolas de Nantes (1840), Sacré-Coeur de Moulins (1849), Saint-Pierre de Dijon (1850), Saint-Jean-Baptiste de Belleville (1853) and the Église de Cusset (1855).{{sfn|Leniaud|2015}}   The [[Église Saint-Eugène-Sainte-Cécile|Saint-Eugene-Sainte-Cécile]] in Paris by Louis-Auguste Boileau and Adrien-Louis Lasson (1854–55) was the most innovative example of neo-Gothic;  it combined a traditional Gothic design with a modern iron framework.  [[Jules Verne]] was married in the church in 1857.&lt;ref&gt;Texier (2012), pgs. 78-79&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sculpture and Symbolism - the "Book for the Poor"==

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The Gothic cathedral was a ''liber pauperum'', literally a "book for the poor", covered with sculpture illustrating biblical stories, for the vast majority of parishioners who were illiterate. These largely illustrated stories from the Bible, but also included stories and figures from mythology and more complicated symbols taken from medieval philosophical and scientific teachings such as [[alchemy]].

The exteriors of Cathedrals and other Gothic churches were decorated with sculptures of a variety of fabulous and frightening [[grotesque (architecture)|grotesques]] or monsters, These included the [[gargoyle]], the [[chimera (mythology)|chimera]], the [[dragon]], the [[tarasque]], and others, taken largely from legend and mythology.  They were part of the visual message for the illiterate worshipers, symbols of the evil and danger that threatened those who did not follow the teachings of the church.&lt;ref&gt;Wenzler (2018), pages 97-99&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gargoyle]] also had a more practical purpose.  They were the rain spouts of the Cathedral; rainwater ran from the roof into lead gutters, then down channels on the flying buttresses to the mouths of the gargoyles.  The longer the gargoyle, the farther the water was projected from the walls, protecting the walls and windows from water damage.  Multiple numbers were used to distribute the water as widely as possible.

Amid all the religious figures, some of the sculptural decoration was devoted to illustrating medieval science and philosophy.  The porch of [[Notre Dame Cathedral]] in Paris and of [[Amiens Cathedral]] are decorated with similar small carved figures holding circular plaques with symbols of transformation taken from alchemy.  The central pillar of the central door of Notre Dame features a statue of a woman on a throne holding a scepter in her left hand, and in her right hand, two books, one open (symbol of public knowledge), and the other closed (esoteric knowledge), along with a ladder with seven steps, symbolizing the seven steps alchemists followed in their scientific quest of trying to transform ordinary metal into gold.&lt;ref&gt;Wenzler (2018), pages 97-99&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common feature of Gothic cathedrals was a design of a [[labyrinth]], usually found in stone on the floor in a central part of the Cathedral.  Inapired by the labyrinth in Greek legend constructed by King [[Minos]] as the home of the [[Minotaur]],  In Cathedrals, they were known as the "Path of Jerusalem" and symbolized the difficult and often roundabout path that a Christian sometimes had to follow in life to reach the gates of Paradise and salvation. Large labyrinths were originally found in [[Auxerre Cathedral]], [[Sens Cathedral]], [[Reims Cathedral]], and [[Arras Cathedral]], but these removed during various renovations in the 18th century.  The best surviving examples are in [[Chartres Cathedral]], in its original form,  and in [[Amiens Cathedral]], which was reconstructed in 1894.

==Sculpture==
The portal sculpture of [[Burgundy]] integrates Classical, literary elements with its 13th century Gothic style. In [[Auxerre]], two such examples of sculptures are upon the Cathedral of [[Saint-Étienne]] depicting [[Hercules]], a satyr, and a sleeping faun; the Chartres–[[Reims]] cathedral's north transept illustrates the biblical tale of [[David]] and [[Bathsheba]]. The [[Sens Cathedral]]'s "Coronation of the Virgin" reflects a similar relief cathedral on the [[Notre-Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]] in Paris, and was created in a workshop that made minor contributions to [[Spanish Gothic architecture]]&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, Paul. "Gothic Sculpture 1140–1300". {{ISBN|978-0300074529}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Notre-Dame-de-Lamourguier in [[Narbonne]]
* Sainte-Marie in [[Saint-Bertrand-de-Comminges]]
* [[Church of the Jacobins]] in Toulouse

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2839">In [[geometry]] and [[crystallography]], a '''glide plane''' (or '''transflection''') is a [[symmetry operation]] describing how a [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] in a plane, followed by a [[translation (mathematics)|translation]] parallel with that plane, may leave the [[crystal]] unchanged. 

Glide planes are noted by ''a'', ''b'' or ''c'', depending on which axis the glide is along.  There is also the ''n'' glide, which is a glide along the half of a diagonal of a face, and the ''d'' glide, which is along a fourth of either a face or space diagonal of the [[unit cell]]. The latter is often called the diamond glide plane as it features in the diamond structure.

==Formal treatment==
In [[geometry]], a '''glide plane operation''' is a type of [[isometry]] of the [[Euclidean space]]: the combination of a [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] in a plane and a [[translation (geometry)|translation]] in that plane. Reversing the order of combining gives the same result. Depending on context, we may consider a reflection a special case, where the translation vector is the zero vector.

The combination of a reflection in a plane and a translation in a perpendicular direction is a reflection in a parallel plane. However, a glide plane operation with a nonzero translation vector in the plane cannot be reduced like that. Thus the effect of a reflection combined with ''any'' translation is a glide plane operation in the general sense, with as special case just a reflection. The glide plane operation in the strict sense and the pure reflection are two of the four kinds of indirect [[Euclidean_group#Overview_of_isometries_in_up_to_three_dimensions|isometries in 3D]].

The [[isometry group]] generated by just a glide plane operation is an infinite [[cyclic group]]. Combining two equal glide plane operations gives a pure translation with a translation vector that is twice that of the glide plane operation, so the even powers of the glide plane operation form a translation group.

In the case of '''glide plane symmetry''', the [[symmetry group]] of an object contains a glide plane operation, and hence the group generated by it. For any symmetry group containing glide plane symmetry, the translation vector of any glide plane operation is one half of an element of the translation group. If the translation vector of a glide plane operation is itself an element of the translation group, then the corresponding glide plane symmetry reduces to a combination of [[reflection symmetry]] and [[translational symmetry]].

'''The Hours of Jeanne d'Evreux''' is an [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated]] [[book of hours]] in the [[Gothic art|Gothic]] style. According to the usual account, it was created between 1324 and 1328 by [[Jean Pucelle]] for [[Jeanne d'Evreux]], the third wife of [[Charles IV of France]]. It was sold in 1954 to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York where it is now part of the collection held at [[The Cloisters]] (accession number 54.1.2), and usually on display. The book is very lavishly decorated, mostly in [[grisaille]] drawings, and is a highly important example of an early royal book of hours, a type of book designed for the personal devotions of a wealthy lay-person, which was then less than a century old. It has been described as "the high point of Parisian court painting", showing "the unprecedentedly refined artistic tastes of the time".&lt;ref&gt;Codices, 210&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:6 Jean Pucelle, Hours of Jeanne d'Evreux. 1325-28, Metropolitan Museum, New-York.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Crucifixion of Jesus]]'' and ''[[Adoration of the Magi]]'']]

The book is very small: the size of each [[vellum]] [[recto and verso|folio]] or page is 3 5/8 x 2 7/16 in. (9.2 x 6.2&amp;nbsp;cm), and the overall size including the current replacement binding is 3 7/8 x 2 13/16 x 1 1/2 in. (9.9 x 7.2 x 3.8&amp;nbsp;cm).  There are 209 folios, with 25 full page miniatures, but many other [[historiated initial]]s and images in the borders of most pages, so that over 700 illustrations have been counted. Only ten folios have no decoration, just plain text, suggesting that the book was never entirely finished.&lt;ref&gt;Flinn, 260&lt;/ref&gt; The vellum is extremely thin, almost transparent, and the text by an unknown scribe is very finely written.&lt;ref&gt;Codices, 209; Harthan, 40&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The miniatures use a variety of [[grisaille]] drawing in pen known (or at least so called in an inventory that included this work) as "de blanc et noir" and [[tempera]] for the other colours. Using both grisaille and colour together is a technique known as “camaïeu gris”.  The full-page paintings include cycles of what are always the most commonly found phases of the [[Life of Christ]], the Passion and Infancy.  These illustrate the [[Hours of the Virgin]], which is found in some other books of hours, but most unusually they are arranged on facing pages showing a scene from the Passion on the left and from the Infancy on the right, with eight pairs of scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Codices, 209; Randall&lt;/ref&gt;  However such an arrangement is often found in the [[ivory]] [[diptych]]s that were being produced in great numbers in Paris at this period.&lt;ref&gt;Calkins, 248&lt;/ref&gt;  Another cycle shows nine scenes from the life of the Saint-King [[Louis IX of France]] decorating the office dedicated to him.  Saint Louis was the great-grandfather of both Queen Jeanne and her husband Charles IV, who were [[first cousin]]s.

The text is unusual in that the saints' days noted in the calendar, and those mentioned in the [[litany]], are clearly those of Paris, featuring all the otherwise obscure local saints one would expect, such as [[Clodoald|Saint Cloud]] and [[Germain of Paris|Saint Germain]].  However the rest of the text follows forms typical of hours written for members of the [[Dominican order]].  It is possible that two different models were accidentally used by the scribes, though this seems somewhat careless in a major royal commission.&lt;ref&gt;Flinn, 258&lt;/ref&gt;  But Queen Jeanne was especially close to the Dominicans, so the mixture of texts may be deliberate.&lt;ref&gt;Codices, 208&lt;/ref&gt;  Various mistakes in other parts of the book are corrected, which for appearance's sake they often are not in luxury books, but the calendar has no corrections, despite misspelling over 30 saints' names, and giving 15 the wrong feast days.&lt;ref&gt;Flinn, 258&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and authorship==
[[File:Louis hodinky.jpg|thumb|left|Saint Louis caring for victims of the plague]]
Although there are dissenting opinions, the book is generally believed to be the work of the leading Parisian illuminator, Jean Pucelle (or Jehan Pucele). It is usually identified with the book mentioned by Queen Jeanne in her will, in which she leaves to [[Charles V of France|Charles V]] "un bien petit livret d'oroisons que le roy Charles, dont Dieu l'ame, avoit faict faire pour Madame, que pucelle enlumina" ("a very small prayer book which King Charles, may God protect him, had made for Madame, which Pucelle illuminated").  The identification of the patrons, illuminator and the date assigned to the work all largely depend on identifying this book with the manuscript in New York, as does any clear conception of what Pucelle's personal style was.&lt;ref&gt;Flinn, 259.  Flinn dissents from this identification; Harthan, 44&lt;/ref&gt; However this refers to a [[prayer book]] not a book of hours, and it has been doubted that this imprecision would have been likely in such a context.  In addition none of Jeanne's [[heraldry]] appears in the book, unlike two other royal manuscripts made when she was queen, her Coronation Book and a [[breviary]].&lt;ref&gt;Flinn, 260; Harthan, 44&lt;/ref&gt;

On the conventional assumptions, the book was first owned by Queen Jeanne until her death in 1371, when it was left to the then king [[Charles V of France|Charles V]]. In 1380, an inventory of Charles V’s possessions mentions a Dominican Book of Hours that had belonged to Jeanne d’Evreux. This book is assumed to be one mentioned in an inventory from 1401-2 of the books of [[John, Duke of Berry]], who inherited many manuscripts from his brother’s collection. There the description matches the present book more closely than that in Queen Jeanne's will: "Item une petites heures de Nostre Dame, nommée Heures de Pucelle, enlumées de blanc et de noir, à la usaige des Prescheurs" ("Item: a little hours of [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Our Lady]], called the Hours of Pucelle, illuminated in black and white, in the Dominican usage").&lt;ref&gt;Harthan, 44&lt;/ref&gt;  If they are the same, between the inventories of Charles and Berry, the cover of the illuminated manuscript changed from a pearl-studded cover to a blue silk binding in 1402.  Its whereabouts are then unknown until it reappears in the 17th century, as the two [[coats-of-arms]] on the current leather [[bookbinding]] make it clear that it belonged to the French noble Louis-Jules de Châtelet and his wife Christine de Gleseneuve Bar, who married in 1618 and both died before 1672.&lt;ref&gt;Flinn, [http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/70010733 MMA], and see [[:fr:Louis-Jules du Châtelet|French Wikipedia biography]] of Louis-Jules de Châtelet&lt;/ref&gt;

The book then lacks a history until [[Alphonse de Rothschild]] of [[Geneva]] acquired it in the 19th century. At his death in 1900, it was left to his nephew [[Maurice de Rothschild]] in Paris. The Germans confiscated the book in 1940 during the [[World War II|occupation of France]] and sent it to [[Neuschwanstein|Neuschwanstein castle]] in Germany. It was restored to its owner in 1948 and Maurice de Rothschild sold it in 1954 to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].

===Pucelle===
There are several different manuscripts thought to be illuminated by Pucelle and his workshop, but they show some discrepancies with regards to his style. Florens Deuchler, who was the chairman of Medieval Art and The Cloisters of the Metropolitan Museum of Art from 1968 to 1972, was very sceptical about attributing The Hours of Jeanne d’Evreux to Jean Pucelle, as was Elizabeth Flinn of the MMA. In an article called ''Jean Pucelle- Facts and Fictions'' he says: "we call him Jean Pucelle, although we do not know who he was, whether he worked as a chef d’atelier – the master of a workshop- or whether he was just an enlumineur we hear of by chance more often than we hear of his many colleagues working in Paris."&lt;ref&gt;Deuchler&lt;/ref&gt;  There are a few other works that are claimed to be produced by the hand of Jean Pucelle, such as the [[Psalter of Bonne de Luxembourg|Prayer Book of Bonne of Luxembourg]], also located in the Metropolitan Museum of Art at The Cloisters, and the Belleville Breviary, that vary in style and quality.  Karen Gould states: “Pucelle is believed to have painted the entire manuscript [the Hours of Jeanne d’Evreux].”&lt;ref&gt;Gould&lt;/ref&gt;  Kathleen Morand is quite certain that “it [Hours of Jeanne d’Evreux] is also the only manuscript which we are certain was entirely executed by the hand of Pucelle.”&lt;ref&gt;Gould&lt;/ref&gt; Manuscripts such as the Prayer Book of Bonne of Luxembourg, are considered to be in the Pucelle style rather than by the master himself, while the Hours of Jeanne d’Evreux is thought to be by the master himself. The Metropolitan website currently uses the conventional attribution without any question marks indicating uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;See either link at bottom; Harthan and Codices are among the other sources who also follow the conventional view.&lt;/ref&gt;  If the book was not commissioned for Queen Jeanne, it is highly likely to have been commissioned for another queen of the [[House of Capet]], given the emphasis on Saint Louis and the crowned female donor portraits in the book.&lt;ref&gt;Harthan, 41&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commission==
[[File:Jeanne Évreux.jpg|thumb|left|[[Donor portrait]] of [[Jeanne d'Evreux]]; detail of the Annunciation miniature]]
Charles IV married Jeanne in 1325 and died in 1328, giving the dating for the book (Jeanne lived on for over 40 years, until 1371); it may have been a gift for the wedding or her coronation.&lt;ref&gt;Harthan, 44&lt;/ref&gt;  The Hours were made for her private use, to provide a text for the daily prayers she would read or recite at intervals throughout the day.  It is thought that Jean Pucelle was a member of the royal court workshop, working for Charles IV, and he was perhaps an Italian or at least had travelled to Italy, to judge by some elements of his work, including the Hours of Jeanne d’Evreux.  Deuchler states: "with the appearance of Pucelle’d name, there was an exciting new departure in Parisian courtly book illumination, which, as a matter of fact, would not have been possible without the contribution of Italy- to be more specific, without the aid of [[Duccio]]. The “Pucelle Style” shows solid trecento connections in its painterly skill and its familiarity with southern perspective as it existed in Sienese models."&lt;ref&gt;Deuchler&lt;/ref&gt;  Pucelle seems to have been the originator of the Italian influence in French manuscript illumination, and after his death, the Italian influence in Parisian art disappeared. Paintings by Duccio, especially the [[Maestà (Duccio)|Maestà]]   in [[Siena Cathedral]] and the [[Pulpit by Giovanni Pisano in Sant'Andrea, Pistoia]] can be directly related to elements of The Hours of Jeanne d’Evreux.  [[Strasbourg Cathedral]] and the its sculpture was also an influence on the book, as in the Passion Cycle, where specific details from the sculpture of the cathedral are borrowed by the manuscript.

==Style==
[[File:Evreux1.jpg|thumb|left|Text page]]
  
The hours are a classic masterpiece of Gothic illumination, and the architectural surrounds to many images show typical French Gothic architecture of the period.  Although it does not depict the typical flying buttress and gargoyles most commonly associated with the Gothic period, the 154 verso leaf from the Hours of Jeanne d’Evreux titled The Miracle of the Breviary, a cathedral with Gothic architecture  Elements such as the trifoils that can be found decorating the top part of the ornate roof are drawn in grisaille. Even more gothic aspects can be found in the two facing folios depicting Christ Carrying the Cross, on verso sixty one, and the Annunciation to the Shepherds (62 recto). The figures are constrained within a space that acts as a frame but resembles a Gothic cathedral or at least carries the same structural or architectural and stylistic elements.  [[Quatrefoil]]s, [[gargoyle]]s, [[crocket]]s are all elements that are most associated with the Gothic movement and can be found in both folios. To be more specific, the Hours of Jeanne d’Evreux, belongs to the stylistic conventions of the Northern Gothic tradition that was native to Jean Pucelle with which “he combined the elegance and refinement of the Parisian court style with the lively humour and observation of nature characteristic of northern France and Flanders”&lt;ref&gt;Gould&lt;/ref&gt;  while influenced by the Italians.

Close similarities to the sculpture of Strasbourg Cathedral have been noted, and Pucelle may have had an involvement there. According to Gould, “most of the connections with the Strasbourg sculpture appear in the Hours of Jeanne d’Evreux. The parallels with the Strasbourg sculpture occur in the Passion cycle in the Hours of Jeanne d’Evreux. Several of the motifs come from the Passion cycle occupying the tympanum of the central portal at Strasbourg.”&lt;ref&gt;Gould&lt;/ref&gt; Although, the relationship between Strasbourg Cathedral’s second register of the tympanum and the miniature of Christ Carrying the Cross is quite unnoticeable when initially examined,  “ the outstretched arm reaching to support the Cross in the miniature makes a visual connection with an unusual motif in the same scene”&lt;ref&gt;Gould&lt;/ref&gt;  of the second register. All of the figures can also be found in the Siena Maesta by [[Duccio]], and Portail de la Calende at [[Rouen Cathedral]].  Other similarities, especially ones concerned with the Hedroit Legend that are found in the Hours of Jeanne d’Evreux, can also be seen in the Hours of Yolande of Flanders. The facial features of the man whose wife forges the nails for Christ’s crucifixion at the request of Jews, are similar to the facial features of the crouching figure in the ''[[Christ Carrying the Cross]]'' (61 verso).

==Iconography==
[[File:Krist hodinkyEvreux.jpg|thumb|''[[Christ Carrying the Cross]]'' and the ''[[Annunciation to the Shepherds]]'']]
There are several iconographic features in the Hours of Jeanne d’Evreux that are worth mentioning. Portrayal of black Africans can be found at the beginning of the Passion cycle in two miniatures of the illuminated manuscript. The Passion cycle at Matins opens with the Betrayal, where Malchus, a crouching figure on the left side of the foreground, has features that ethnically differ from the rest of the figures in the image. Because by the time of Pucelle’s artistic bloom, Europeans were well aware and familiar with North and East African races and appearances, “the idea of depicting blacks as servants and specifically as tormenters of Christ had become part of the visual iconography of Western art from at least the 12th century.”&lt;ref&gt;Gould&lt;/ref&gt;  As the familiarity with black ethnicity heightened, so did the interest for realism, especially in the visual arts, which allowed for the depiction of characteristic features found in the specific African groups that have caught the attention of Western cultures at this point in time. The colour black is, traditionally, especially in Christianity, associated with sin and evil, which gave all the more reason and logic to depict Africans as the persecutors of Christ. “Although precedents for the depiction of Malchus as a black servant and of blacks persecuting Christ existed in Gothic art, in the early 14th century this iconography remained unusual.”&lt;ref&gt;Gould&lt;/ref&gt;

In the miniature of [[Christ Carrying the Cross]] (61 verso), from what appears to be outside of the frame [it's actually the arm of the man with the blue-tinted beard who is just behind and to Christ's left, as is obvious from the drapery], an arm reaches out to support the cross Christ is carrying at a diagonal angle. Connections can be made to the Hedroit Legend by comparing it to the Strasbourg tympanum where a woman, the wife of the smith who was asked to forge nails for Christ’s crucifixion, is holding the three nails she forged while reaching out to support the Cross. Another aspect that exhibits Pucelle’s familiarity with the Hedroit legend is the crouching figure on the left of the bas-de-page in Christ Carrying the Cross. The man is holding a hammer which can symbolize the nailing of Christ to the Cross, but it is also possible that the image is a reference to the husband of the woman who forged the nails for Christ’s crucifixion, and now he is subjected to carrying all the weight of the guilt he is presented with caused by his wife’s actions. 
[[File:5 Jean Pucelle Hours of Jeanne d'Evreux. 1325-28, Metropolitan Museum, New-York.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Entombment of Christ]]'' and the ''[[Flight to Egypt]]'']]

Folio 82 verso depicts the Entombment scene, which is heavily influenced by the Italian compositional approach while integrating Northern Gothic figures. A crouching figure, mourning Christ’s death with outstretched arms that hold the arm of Christ, resides in the foreground of the Entombment miniature. The figure wears a heavy robe that “obscures the articulation of the body”&lt;ref&gt;Gould&lt;/ref&gt; and is positioned to the right of the central axis. Both her gaze and gesture supporting the limp arm of Christ “lead the eye from the foreground to the middle ground and to the focal point of the composition, the faces of Christ and the Virgin,”&lt;ref&gt;Gould&lt;/ref&gt; while relieving the horizontal line of Christ’s recumbent body with her form. Judging from the foreground position, the fact that she is embracing Christ’s arm, and her rippled hair exposed by the fallen hood of her cloak, all of which are “compositional and iconographic attributes in accordance with Mary Magdalene’s active role in the Lamentation found in the visual arts and devotional literature”&lt;ref&gt;Gould&lt;/ref&gt;  the figure crouching in the foreground of the Entombment miniature is Mary Magdalene, of which the inclusion, according to Gerard Cames, is a Western innovation of the 12th century. The Annunciation page introduces a couple of compelling themes and symbols that are connected to the central miniature. On the outer bas-de-page margins, the musical angels and the animals, such as rabbits, ape, and squirrel, portrayed in the foreground “have an immediate relevance [to] minutely rendered allusions to fertility, the Fall of man, and Redemption”.&lt;ref&gt;Randall&lt;/ref&gt;  The Betrayal page presents us with a mock-tilt composition and “two riders mounted on a goat and a ram (both beasts of multiple sinful connotation), [which] are engaged in a joint action of evil intent as they charge the keg set on a post between them”.&lt;ref&gt;Randall&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hours of Jeanne d’Evreux today is not in its full original 14th-century state, yet remains in excellent condition, apart from some damages, especially to the opening calendar pages.&lt;ref&gt;Bonne, fig. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The scenes depicted in the two-bas-de-page facing pages at Matins, a mock tilt and a buffeting game were “rendered with great verve and skill, these scenes look simply like elaborate versions of the type of decoration customarily found at the beginning of devotional book at this period.”

Mixing and matching is the unavoidable process in the making of inner connections and the presentations of interculturalities. The majority of the works in intercultural theatre deal basically with thinking and doing around the themes, stories, pre-performative or performative concepts of Asian classical theatre or traditional performing arts forms and practices, mixing and matching the concepts or the ideas of the foreign.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0415092167 "Theatre world performance politics culture"]&lt;/ref&gt; After the well-known success of Peter Brook's production of the Mahabharata,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smith.edu/metamorphoses/issues/links/hellwegpeter.html "Metamorphoses"]&lt;/ref&gt; the trend has been evolving tremendously around the globe and many the cultural institutions of many governments have become directly interested in pushing the boundaries of intercultural senses and sensitivities by financially investing on new theatrical productions, university research, conferences and fellowships&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nuigalway.ie/about-us/news-and-events/news-archive "SUSI Grants"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== The three major groups of intercultural theatre ==

===Imitational theatre===
The intended audience is from the same culture, or a foreign audience from a different culture and the theater group, or the actors or performers, come from the same cultural background or from very diverse foreign cultural backgrounds. The production may imitate foreign styles, the production procedures may introduce new techniques, a new style of acting or a new style of presentation for a group of actors from various cultures or the same culture, the production may include foreign languages, costumes, scenic themes and other aspects. There are many examples of intercultural theatre groups, people, and institutions who are experimenting with various levels of mixing and matching of traditional or contemporary aspects of theatre training and presentations in this type of Imitational Theatre. 

After the global acceptance of renowned theatre director Peter Brook, many theatre directors went after Asian traditional theatre art forms and other Asian representational systems, in order to develop and portray their own theatre presentations using, or somehow capitalizing on the actor training systems and scenic representations belonging to those particular Asian theatres, such as the Noh theatre, Kathakali, Chinese opera etcetera. While Peter Brook was successful in his approach to a universally accepted vision of theatre-making through the Asian theatre systems --beyond the parameters of imitating different theatrical topics-- many other younger institutions or directorial approaches are kept within the parameters of imitations or comparisons, or only exchanges of physical exercises.

===Adaptive theatre===
There are two types of intercultural theatre within adapted theatre. One can consider "the norm" to represent what the audience of a certain culture expects/has typically been exposed to:

* '''Adapts to the norm''' - traditional style productions that have been consciously adapted to fit with the cultural expectations of the intended audience of another culture.
* '''Adapts away from the norm''' - the original culture dominates but it borrows foreign elements to enlarge the range of expression (e.g. [[TheatreWorks (Singapore)]] and [[Ong Keng Sen]]; [[International Centre for Theatre Research]] and [[Peter Brook]]; and [[The Bridge - Stage of the Arts#Betty Comden's article about the festival|The Bridge - Stage of the Arts]])

===Universal theatre===
The aim of universal theatre is to be recognized and accepted by audience members from a wide range of cultural backgrounds (e.g. [[Peter Brook#The Mahabharata|The Mahabharata, Peter Brook]], [http://www.performingarts.jp/e/data_art/other/p-10481.html Hiroshi Koike] [http://kikh.com/ Bridge Project- The Mahabharata],&lt;ref&gt;[http://pappa-tara.com "Performing Arts Institute"]&lt;/ref&gt; [http://barihochwald.com/ Bari Hochwald] [http://theglobaltheatreproject.org/ The Global Theatre Project],&lt;ref&gt;[http://theglobaltheatreproject.org "The Global Theatre Project"]&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.tfana.org/education/programs/world-theatre The World Theatre Project], [http://www.peoplestheatreproject.org/ People's Theatre Project] etc.)

==The sub-divisions of intercultural theatre==
Globalization supported in the developments of intercultural theatre in various directions and evolutions of point of views by the theatre practitioners, scholars, funders and producers(British Council, Fulbright, Ford foundation, [http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/Rockefeller-Foundation-Awards-1128 The Rockefeller foundation]) particularly using English language as the main medium of communication for knowing, acknowledging, debating, reasoning, considering, teaching, learning, writing, speaking, adapting, translating or transforming the one culture to the other culture in large contexts and in detailed micro contexts. Primarily the discourses of intercultural theatre practice developed out of the re-source influences of western theatre arts, western theoreticians and western theatre practitioners. (e.g. [http://www.odinteatret.dk/about-us/eugenio-barba.aspx%20 Eugenio Barba], [[Jerzy Grotowski]], [http://www.theworkcenter.org/ Thomas Richards], [[Peter Brook]], [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]],[http://www.phillipzarrilli.com/ Phillip Zarilli])

===American intercultural theatre===
*For many theatre cultures, American intercultural theatre has given the possibilities of new exchanges, experiments, researches and pioneer introductions of model attempts in theatre making. There are many directors, teachers or theatre artists began working with the sources of American point of views in the intercultural attempts and some of them are [http://rasaboxes.org/about/eca-biographies/ Richard Schechner], [http://www.phillipzarrilli.com/ Phillip Zarilli], Robert Wilson,Christian DuComb Phd, Prof.Esther Kim Lee, Ellen Stewart-La MaMa, Lee Breuer-Mabou Mines, Hugh Gittens, Anne Bogart, Phillip Glass etc.

===Australian intercultural theatre===

===British intercultural theatre===

===Canadian intercultural theatre===

==Non-Native English language speaking countries intercultural theatre==
*English is the primary medium of communication in the intercultural theatre scene worldwide and American English or British English used as the mother source language to make all transactions related with theatre training, teaching and performing. Many non English countries have welcomed the English language as the official medium for the citizens and thus opened possibilities of any business. The culture is also part of business in the sense of in-coming and out-going, travelling or transforming stories, experiences, music, histories and philosophies. The dramatic theories and the acting coaching is mainly developed by the American or European masters of contemporary theatre. The non native English language speaking cultures supported the new experiences, exchanges, experiments to present the new shows.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2898">The '''International Festival of Vodun Arts and Cultures''', also known as the '''Ouidah Festival''', was first held in [[Ouidah]], Benin in February 1993, sponsored by [[UNESCO]] and the government of Benin. It celebrated the transatlantic Vodun religion, and was attended by priest and priestesses from [[Haiti]], [[Cuba]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Brazil]] and the [[United States]], as well as by government officials and tourists from Europe and the Americas.{{sfn|Rush|2001|p=32}}
The festival was sponsored by the newly elected president of Benin, [[Nicéphore Soglo]], who wanted to rebuild the connection with the Americas and celebrate the restoration of freedom of religion with the return to democracy.{{sfn|Rahier|Hintzen|Smith|2010|p=183}}
Artists from Benin, Haiti, Brazil and Cuba were given commissions to make sculptures and paintings related to Vodun and its variants in Africa and the African diaspora.{{sfn|Rush|2001|p=32}}

The festival was mainly commercial in nature, aiming to attract tourists and gain attention from the international art market. However, [[Vodun art]] can still be efficacious when produced for sale, and the Vodun spirits were propitiated at the start of the festival.{{sfn|Rush|2001|p=33}}
The festival acknowledged the role of the Beninese in the slave trade, and was meant to serve a healing role and a welcoming home of the people of the African diaspora. It also tried counter the view of the [[Yoruba people]] and [[Yoruba religion]] as the main cultural origin of the diaspora, and affirm the central role of the [[Fon people]] and Vodun religion.{{sfn|Rahier|Hintzen|Smith|2010|p=184}}
Some of the art commissioned for the festival is displayed at sites in the city, including work by the Benin artists [[Cyprien Tokoudagba]], [[Calixte Dakpogan]], [[Theodore Dakpogan]], [[Simonet Biokou]], [[Dominique Kouas]], and [[Yves Apollinaire Pede]], and work of the African Diaspora artists [[Edouard Duval-Carrié]] (Haiti), José Claudio (Brazil) and [[Manuel Mendive]] (Cuba).{{sfn|Rush|2001|p=33}}

The '''Karyes Typikon''' ({{lang-sr|Карејски типик/Karejski tipik}}) was written for the [[Karyes, Mount Athos|Karyes]] cell on [[Mount Athos]] in 1199 by [[Saint Sava]], at the time a [[monk]] and later the first [[Serbs|Serbian]] [[Archbishop]]. It is basically a translation from a standard Greek ascetic typikon with some minor changes. It became a model for Serbian solitary or eremitical monasticism also outside of Mount Athos.&lt;ref name=Bogdanovic-Karejski&gt;{{harvnb|Bogdanović|1999|loc= Предговор, para. 13, Карејски типик}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is published along with the Catalog of Cyrillic manuscripts from the [[Hilandar monastery]] since 1908.

[[File:Les Frigos, Paris 31 December 2012.jpg|thumb|View of ''Les Frigos'' building]]
[[File:Les-Frigos.jpg|thumb|Alternative aerial view]]

'''Les Frigos''' is an artistic site for production and creation, located at 19, [[rue des Frigos]] in the station district of the [[13th arrondissement of Paris|13th arrondissement]], [[Paris]], [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://untappedcities.com/2013/06/07/les-frigos-an-artist-squat-in-paris-13th-arrondissement/ | title=Les Frigos: An Artist Squat in Paris’ 13th Arrondissement | date=6 July 2013 | first=Kala | last=Court | website=uptapped cities | accessdate=24 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of the new [[Paris Rive Gauche]] development, between the [[National Library of France]] and [[Paris Diderot University]].

==History==
Originally a refrigerated railway depot built in 1921, it became an industrial wasteland starting in 1971, following the displacement of the "Halles de Paris" to the new [[Marché international de Rungis|International Market]] at [[Rungis]]. During the 1980s the building was occupied by new arrivals, artists and artisans, attracted by the great spaces and the quality of its thermal and sound insulation. The first occupants were [[squatter]]s, a mixture of artists and non-artists (including, notably, [[Ben Vautier|Ben]] and {{ill|Jérôme Mesnager|fr}}).{{fact|date=October 2016}} Rapidly, however, the successive occupants took to contracting for their occupation, and to paying rent. After the National Society of French Railways ([[SNCF]]), and following that the [[Réseau Ferré de France]], the [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Mairie de Paris]] became the legal owner of the building (starting from 31 December 2003). The storeys of the building have been converted into [[Artist studio|artists' studio]]s, [[music studio]]s, etc. Since then, despite the hazards, ownership changes and redevelopment of the neighbourhood, the place has remained a benchmark among new "territories" of [[contemporary art]].

==Occupants==
Over a hundred tenants work on the site, which includes ninety workshops. In 2010, rents for the premises equipped by the tenants ranged from around €500 to €2,700. Fifteen different professions carry out activities at Les Frigos, ranging from small firms to [[publishing house]]s, [[arts and crafts]], etc. There are artists, micro-companies and associations for managing rehearsal facilities for theatrical people or for musicians. This is the first location in France to have developed, by chance, a professional site for "vertical mixing", bringing together these various professions.{{fact|date=October 2016}} The wish of a great part of the tenants is to have the site legally positioned on the [[Paris Rive Gauche]] development programme for the 13th arrondissement.{{fact|date=October 2016}}

==The original ''Eagle'' comic==

These are the '''Dan Dare stories''' that appeared in the original [[Eagle (comic)|Eagle Comic]], which ran from 1950 to 1969 and featured the hero [[Dan Dare]]. The stories would often take place as parts of longer story arcs, and when this happened the stories are grouped together as such.  These storylines were reprinted by Hawk Books in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and as of May, 2009, the first ten stories have been reprinted again by [[Titan Books]].  The series of twelve hardbacks, each about 100 pages, splits ''Voyage to Venus'' and ''Operation Saturn'' across two volumes each.  After a brief hiatus, the following two stories, 'Man From Nowhere' and 'Rogue Planet' were released in 2008, with ''The Phantom Fleet'' and ''Safari in Space'' continuing publication into 2009..

Three stories (''Man From Nowhere'', ''Rogue Planet'', ''Reign of the Robots'') were reproduced in the early 1980s by [[Dragon's Dream]].  The first of these books was particularly notable because the front page panel with the Eagle logo was replaced with new artwork drawn by Dan Dare's creator [[Frank Hampson]].

''The original Eagle's run then came to an end when it was merged with the [[Lion (comic)|Lion Comic]].''

==2000AD==

Between 1977 and 1981 the Dan Dare character was revived to appear in the new [[2000 AD (comics)|2000AD]] comic. For the first 45 progs (issues) of the comic, "Dan Dare" was considered to be the "lead" strip, and hence held the coveted centre-spread position, thus allowing the first two pages of the strip to be printed in colour. From prog 46 to prog 58, Dare was moved to the front cover, a move that not only allowed the fan favourite [[Judge Dredd]] to take the centre spread, but which also meant that by dispensing with the traditional single-image cover, the comic could effectively have an extra page of content.

==The relaunched ''Eagle'' comic==

In 1982 Eagle was re-launched, with Dan Dare once again its flagship strip. The new character was the great-great-grandson of the original, with the only other surviving original character being the Mekon, although a descendent of Digby was later introduced.

*''Return of the Mekon'' issues 1-33

==Revolver==
In 1990, a strip entitled ''Dare'', written by [[Grant Morrison]] and drawn by [[Rian Hughes]], was serialized in ''[[Revolver Comic (UK)|Revolver]]''. It presented bleak and cynical characters and was a not-too-subtle satire of 1980s [[British politics]]. Spacefleet had been privatised, the Treens were subjected to racist abuse in urban ghettos, Digby was unemployed, Professor Peabody committed suicide, and Dare's mentor Sir Hubert Guest betrayed Dare to [[the Mekon]] and his quisling British Prime Minister, Gloria Munday (whose appearance and demeanour appear modelled on [[Margaret Thatcher]].) Ultimately, Dare destroys London, the Mekon and himself through a smuggled nuclear weapon.

==The Planet==
In 1996, ''The Planet'' published its first and only issue. Inside was a new and unfinished Dan Dare story, "Remembrance", drawn by [[Sydney Jordan]] featuring a slightly older Dare and apparently set some years after the original Eagle strips.

==Virgin Comics==
In 2008 [[Virgin Comics]] published a 7 issue Dan Dare [[mini-series]] written by [[Garth Ennis]], with art by [[Gary Erskine]]. The series is set several years after the original strips. Space Fleet has collapsed along with the UN due to nuclear war between China and America; Britain survived due to defensive shields made by Professor Peabody, and has become a world power again as a result with the [[Royal Navy]] taking Space Fleet's role. Peabody is the [[Home Secretary]] to a [[Prime Minister]] modelled on [[Tony Blair]], who has sold [[Earth]]'s defence out to [[The Mekon]] out of fear of overwhelming odds. Dare, assisted by Digby (who sacrifices himself in battle) leads a spirited defence of both Earth and his honourable principles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16720">In relativistic [[physics]], '''Lorentz symmetry''', named for [[Hendrik Lorentz]], is an equivalence of observation or observational symmetry due to [[special relativity]] implying that the laws of physics stay the same for all observers that are moving with respect to one another within an [[inertial frame]]. It has also been described as "the feature of nature that says experimental results are independent of the orientation or the boost velocity of the laboratory through space".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/29224 |title=Framing Lorentz symmetry |publisher=CERN Courier |date=2004-11-24 |accessdate=2013-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lorentz covariance''', a related concept, is a property of the underlying [[spacetime]] manifold.  Lorentz covariance has two distinct, but closely related meanings:

# A [[physical quantity]] is said to be Lorentz covariant if it transforms under a given [[group representation|representation]] of the [[Lorentz group]]. According to the [[representation theory of the Lorentz group]], these quantities are built out of [[scalar (physics)|scalar]]s, [[four-vector]]s, [[four-tensor]]s, and [[spinor]]s. In particular, a Lorentz covariant scalar (e.g., the [[space-time interval]])  remains the same under [[Lorentz transformation]]s and is said to be a ''Lorentz invariant'' (i.e., they transform under the [[trivial representation]]).
# An [[equation]] is said to be Lorentz covariant if it can be written in terms of Lorentz covariant quantities (confusingly, some use the term ''invariant'' here). The key property of such equations is that if they hold in one inertial frame, then they hold in any inertial frame; this follows from the result that if all the components of a tensor vanish in one frame, they vanish in every frame. This condition is a requirement according to the [[principle of relativity]]; i.e., all non-[[gravitation]]al laws must make the same predictions for identical experiments taking place at the same spacetime event in two different [[inertial frames of reference]].

On [[manifold]]s, the words [[covariance and contravariance of vectors|''covariant'' and ''contravariant'']] refer to how objects transform under general coordinate transformations. Both covariant and contravariant four-vectors can be Lorentz covariant quantities.

'''Local Lorentz covariance''', which follows from [[general relativity]], refers to Lorentz covariance applying only [[local symmetry|''locally'']] in an infinitesimal region of spacetime at every point. There is a generalization of this concept to cover [[Poincare covariance|Poincaré covariance]] and Poincaré invariance.

==Examples==

In general, the (transformational) nature of a Lorentz tensor{{clarify|this terminology should be introduced before use|date=March 2017}} can be identified by its [[tensor order]], which is the number of free indices it has. No indices implies it is a scalar, one implies that it is a vector, etc.  Some tensors with a physical interpretation are listed below.

The [[sign convention]] of the [[Minkowski metric]] η = [[diagonal matrix|diag]] (1, −1, −1, −1) is used throughout the article.

===Scalars===

;[[Spacetime interval]]:&lt;math&gt;\Delta s^2=\Delta x^a \Delta x^b \eta_{ab}=c^2 \Delta t^2 - \Delta x^2 - \Delta y^2 - \Delta z^2&lt;/math&gt;
;[[Proper time]] (for [[timelike]] intervals):&lt;math&gt;\Delta \tau = \sqrt{\frac{\Delta s^2}{c^2}},\, \Delta s^2 &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;
;[[Proper distance]] (for [[spacelike]] intervals):&lt;math&gt;L = \sqrt{-\Delta s^2},\, \Delta s^2 &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;
;[[Mass]]:&lt;math&gt;m_0^2 c^2 = P^a P^b \eta_{ab}= \frac{E^2}{c^2} - p_x^2 - p_y^2 - p_z^2&lt;/math&gt;
;Electromagnetism invariants:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  F_{ab} F^{ab} &amp;= \ 2 \left( B^2 - \frac{E^2}{c^2} \right) \\
  G_{cd} F^{cd} &amp;= \frac{1}{2}\epsilon_{abcd}F^{ab} F^{cd} = - \frac{4}{c} \left( \vec{B} \cdot \vec{E} \right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
;[[D'Alembertian]]/wave operator:&lt;math&gt;\Box = \eta^{\mu\nu}\partial_\mu \partial_\nu = \frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} - \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} - \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2} - \frac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2}&lt;/math&gt;

===Four-vectors===
;[[Displacement (vector)|4-displacement]]: &lt;math&gt;\Delta X^a = \left(c\Delta t, \vec{\Delta x}\right) = (c\Delta t, \Delta x, \Delta y, \Delta z)&lt;/math&gt;
;[[Four-position|4-position]]: &lt;math&gt;X^a = \left(ct, \vec{x}\right) = (ct, x, y, z)&lt;/math&gt;
;[[Four-gradient|4-gradient]]: which is the 4D [[partial derivative]]:{{paragraph}} &lt;math&gt;\partial^a = \left(\frac{\partial_t}{c}, -\vec{\nabla}\right) = \left(\frac{1}{c}\frac{\partial}{\partial t}, -\frac{\partial}{\partial x}, -\frac{\partial}{\partial y}, -\frac{\partial}{\partial z} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

== Lorentz violating models ==
{{See also|Modern searches for Lorentz violation}}

In standard field theory, there are very strict and severe constraints on [[Renormalization group#Relevant and irrelevant operators, universality classes|marginal and relevant]] Lorentz violating operators within both [[Quantum electrodynamics|QED]] and the [[Standard Model]]. Irrelevant Lorentz violating operators may be suppressed by a high [[cutoff (physics)|cutoff]] scale, but they typically induce marginal and relevant Lorentz violating operators via radiative corrections. So, we also have very strict and severe constraints on irrelevant Lorentz violating operators.

Since some approaches to [[quantum gravity]] lead to violations of Lorentz invariance,&lt;ref name="Mattingly"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.12942/lrr-2005-5|pmid=28163649|pmc=5253993|title=Modern Tests of Lorentz Invariance|year=2005|last1=Mattingly|first1=David|journal=Living Reviews in Relativity|volume=8|issue=1|pages=5|arxiv = gr-qc/0502097 |bibcode = 2005LRR.....8....5M }}&lt;/ref&gt; these studies are part of [[Phenomenological Quantum Gravity]]. Lorentz violations are allowed in [[string theory]], [[supersymmetry]] and [[Horava-Lifshitz gravity]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03434 Neutrino Interferometry for High-Precision Tests of Lorentz Symmetry with IceCube]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lorentz violating models typically fall into four classes:{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

* The laws of physics are exactly [[Lorentz covariant]] but this symmetry is [[spontaneously broken]]. In [[special relativity|special relativistic]] theories, this leads to [[phonon]]s, which are the [[Goldstone boson]]s. The phonons travel at ''less'' than the [[speed of light]].
* Similar to the approximate Lorentz symmetry of phonons in a lattice (where the speed of sound plays the role of the critical speed), the Lorentz symmetry of special relativity (with the speed of light as the critical speed in vacuum) is only a low-energy limit of the laws of physics, which involve new phenomena at some fundamental scale. Bare conventional "elementary" particles are not point-like field-theoretical objects at very small distance scales, and a nonzero fundamental length must be taken into account. Lorentz symmetry violation is governed by an energy-dependent parameter which tends to zero as momentum decreases.&lt;ref name="Gonzalez-MestresMoriond1995"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Properties of a possible class of particles able to travel faster than light |journal=Dark Matter in Cosmology |pages=645 |author=Luis Gonzalez-Mestres |date=1995-05-25 |arxiv=astro-ph/9505117 |bibcode=1995dmcc.conf..645G }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such patterns require the existence of a [[preferred frame|privileged local inertial frame]] (the "vacuum rest frame"). They can be tested, at least partially, by ultra-high energy cosmic ray experiments like the [[Pierre Auger Observatory]].&lt;ref name="Gonzalez-MestresICRC97"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Absence of Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin Cutoff and Stability of Unstable Particles at Very High Energy, as a Consequence of Lorentz Symmetry Violation |journal=Proceedings of the 25th International Cosmic Ray Conference (held 30 July - 6 August |author=Luis Gonzalez-Mestres |volume = 6|pages=113 |date=1997-05-26 |bibcode = 1997ICRC....6..113G|arxiv=physics/9705031}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The laws of physics are symmetric under a [[deformation theory|deformation]] of the Lorentz or more generally, the [[Poincaré group]], and this deformed symmetry is exact and unbroken. This deformed symmetry is also typically a [[quantum group]] symmetry, which is a generalization of a group symmetry. [[Deformed special relativity]] is an example of this class of models. The deformation is scale dependent, meaning that at length scales much larger than the Planck scale, the symmetry looks pretty much like the Poincaré group. Ultra-high energy cosmic ray experiments cannot test such models.
* [[Very special relativity]] forms a class of its own; if [[CP symmetry|charge-parity]] (CP) is an exact symmetry, a subgroup of the Lorentz group is sufficient to give us all the standard predictions. This is, however, not the case.

Models belonging to the first two classes can be consistent with experiment if Lorentz breaking happens at Planck scale or beyond it, or even before it in suitable [[preon]]ic models,&lt;ref name="Gonzalez-MestresCrete2013"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1051/epjconf/20147100062|title=Ultra-high energy physics and standard basic principles. Do Planck units really make sense?|journal=EPJ Web of Conferences|volume=71|pages=00062|year=2014|author=Luis Gonzalez-Mestres|url=http://www.epj-conferences.org/articles/epjconf/pdf/2014/08/epjconf_icnfp2013_00062.pdf|publisher=EPJ Web of Conferences (ICNFP 2013 Conference)|bibcode=2014EPJWC..7100062G}}&lt;/ref&gt; and if Lorentz symmetry violation is governed by a suitable energy-dependent parameter. One then has a class of models which deviate from Poincaré symmetry near the Planck scale but still flows towards an exact Poincaré group at very large length scales.  This is also true for the third class, which is furthermore protected from radiative corrections as one still has an exact (quantum) symmetry.

Even though there is no evidence of the violation of Lorentz invariance, several experimental searches for such violations have been performed during recent years. A detailed summary of the results of these searches is given in the Data Tables for Lorentz and CPT Violation.&lt;ref name="DataTables"&gt;

Lorentz invariance is also violated in QFT assuming non-zero temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laine|first=Mikko|last2=Vuorinen|first2=Aleksi|date=2016|title=Basics of Thermal Field Theory|url=https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-31933-9|journal=Lecture Notes in Physics|language=en-gb|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-31933-9|issn=0075-8450|arxiv=1701.01554}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ojima|first=Izumi|date=January 1986|title=Lorentz invariance vs. temperature in QFT|url=https://link.springer.com/10.1007/BF00417467|journal=Letters in Mathematical Physics|language=en|volume=11|issue=1|pages=73–80|doi=10.1007/bf00417467|issn=0377-9017|bibcode=1986LMaPh..11...73O}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/131197/proof-of-loss-of-lorentz-invariance-in-finite-temperature-quantum-field-theory/137133|title=Proof of Loss of Lorentz Invariance in Finite Temperature Quantum Field Theory|website=Physics Stack Exchange|access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Matilde Serao''' ({{IPA-it|maˈtilde seˈraːo}}; 7 March 1856 – 25 July 1927) was a Greek-born Italian [[journalist]] and [[novelist]]. She was the founder and editor of ''[[Il Mattino]]'', and she also wrote several novels.
She was nominated for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in four different years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=8411 |title=Nomination Database|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
She was born in the Greek city of [[Patras]] to an Italian father, Francesco Serao, and a [[Greeks|Greek]] mother, Paolina Borely.&lt;ref&gt;Romani, Gabriella (2006). "Matilde Serao (1856–1927)." In: ''Encyclopedia of Italian Literary Studies.'' New York: Routledge, p. 1735.&lt;/ref&gt; Her father had emigrated to Greece from [[Naples]] for political reasons.

She worked as a schoolmistress in [[Naples]], and later described those years of laborious poverty in the preface to a book of short stories called ''Leggende Napolitane'' (1881). She first gained renown as a result of the publishing of her ''Novelle'' in ''Il Piccolo'', a newspaper of [[Rocco de Zerbi]], and later by her first novel, ''Fantasia'' (1883), which definitely established her as a writer full of feeling and analytical subtlety.

She spent the years between 1880 and 1886 in [[Rome]], where she published her next five volumes of short stories and novels, all dealing with ordinary Italian, and especially Roman, life, and distinguished by great accuracy of observation and depth of insight: ''Cuore infermo'' (1881), ''Fior di passione'' (1883), ''La conquista di Roma'' (1885), ''La Virtù di checchina'' (1884), and ''Piccole anime'' (1883).

With her husband, [[Edoardo Scarfoglio]], she founded ''Il Corriere di Roma'', the first Italian attempt to model a daily journal along the lines of the Parisian press. The paper was short lived, and after its demise Serao established herself in Naples where she edited ''Il Corriere di Napoli''. In 1892 she co-founded ''[[Il Mattino]]'' with her husband, which became the most important and most widely read daily paper of southern Italy. She established and ran her own newspaper, "Il Giorno" in 1904 until her death. The stress of a journalistic career in no way limited her literary activity; between 1890 and 1902 she produced ''Il paese di cuccagna'', ''Il ventre di Napoli'', ''Addio amore'', ''All'erta sentinella'', ''Castigo'', ''La ballerina'', ''Suor Giovanna della Croce'', ''Paese di Gesù'', novels in which the character of the people is rendered with sensitive power and sympathetic breadth of spirit. Most of these have been translated into English.

She died in 1927 in Naples.

'''Method, Inc.''' is a global design firm with offices in [[San Francisco]], [[New York City]], and [[London]].

==History==
Method is an international strategic design firm focused at the intersection of brand, product, and service design. Method was created in 1999 by Kevin Farnham, David Lipkin, Patrick Newbery, Mike Abbink, and Meng Mantasoot. First started in San Francisco, Method's founding principle was to use multidisciplinary, multi-platform design thinking to create beautiful and extendable solutions. Method's goal was to be quick to adapt to new technology. Method has approximately 100 employees in 3 offices located in [[San Francisco]], [[New York City]], and [[London]]. 

In 1999, the opportunity to work together with [[Autodesk]] arose, launching Method. In 2000, Method expanded and opened its New York office in order to accommodate more work. Method's earliest clients were [[Autodesk]], [[Adobe Systems]], [[Gucci]], [[Palm, Inc.|Palm]], [[MoMA]], and [[Macromedia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://method.com Method.com]. Retrieved 1 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Their international presence was established in 2008 when Method opened its London office.&lt;ref&gt;Pacey, Emily (25 April 2008). [http://www.designweek.co.uk/news/method-opens-london-office/1138309.article "Method Opens London Office"]. ''[[Design Week]]'' (UK).&lt;/ref&gt;

Method was acquired by global product development company, [[GlobalLogic]], in September 2011. Together with GlobalLogic, Method provides design and engineering services at scale from over 30 locations across 12 countries.

==Notable work==
Method created the brand identity and initial set top box user interface for [[Over-the-top content|OTT]] startup, [[Boxee]], in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://method.com/#/productui/index/detail/CaseStudy/43 "Boxes"]. Method.com, 6 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The Boxee work has won the Graphis Gold Award for logo design.&lt;ref name="mawards"&gt;[http://method.com/about/awards "Award-Winning Work"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130807060646/http://method.com/about/awards |date=7 August 2013 }}. Method.com. Retrieved 6 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Boxee has since been named one of the top 5 Companies That Are Re-Inventing Media by The Huffington Post and named "America's Next Top Gadget" by Appletell.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenbaum, Steve (4 March 2009).

In 2007, Method launched and redesigned the website for the [[TED (conference)|TED (Technology, Entertainment, Design)]] Conferences. The conference is very exclusive, and previously only the select TED members had access to the [[TEDTalks]]. The website redesign has opened the talks presented at the conference to the public, and offers new browsing and social networking features. TED.com has since won awards from the [[The One Club|One Show]] Interactive, [[Webbys]], OMMA, ''[[HOW (magazine)|HOW]]'' Interactive, and Pixel, w3, and [[Communication Arts]] for Visual Design, Navigation/Structure, Technical Achievement, and Video Sharing.&lt;ref name="mawards"/&gt; TED was named one of the 50 Best Websites of 2010 by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, and has received praise from various media outlets, including ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Guardian]]'', and ''[[Design Week]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Time Staff (25 August 2010).

In 2009, Method worked with the founders of [[Aardvark]] to expand their services into an online offering. Previously, Aardvark was available via instant message and text message. The new website, vark.com, has an infographic that explains how Aardvark works in 3 steps and also encourages people to use the service with a test question.&lt;ref&gt;[http://method.com/#/work/case_studies/detail/case_studies/aardvark "Aardvark"].

"The Next Web. 28 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Method worked with Salesforce to design and develop a new multi-channel online broadcast experience for their 2014 Dreamforce conference. The analytics on the site far surpassed the goal, with 8 million unique viewers from all campaigns, 284k visits to Salesforce LIVE, 608k page views on Salesforce LIVE, and 20 minutes average view time (and 24 minutes average view time to the Channel 1 experience). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Salesforce|url = http://www.method.com/work/salesforce|website = Method|accessdate = 2015-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34244">[[File:Murales Rivera - Markt in Tlatelolco 3.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Mural by [[Diego Rivera]] showing the pre-Columbian [[Aztec]] city of [[Tenochtitlán]]. In the [[National Palace (Mexico)|Palacio Nacional]] in [[Mexico City]].]]
'''Mexican muralism''' was the promotion of [[mural]] painting starting in the 1920s, generally with social and political messages as part of efforts to reunify the country under the post [[Mexican Revolution]] government. It was headed by “the big three” painters, [[Diego Rivera]], [[José Clemente Orozco]] and [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]]. From the 1920s to about 1970s a large number of murals with nationalistic, social and political messages were created on public buildings, starting a tradition which continues to this day in [[Mexico]] and has had impact in other parts of the Americas, including the [[United States]] where it served as inspiration for the [[Chicano art movement]].

==Antecedents==
[[File:Bonampak mural. Room 1. Musicians and dancers.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Mural from [[Bonampak]].]]

[[Mexico]] has had a tradition of painting murals, starting with the [[Olmec]] civilization in the pre Hispanic period and into the colonial period, with murals mostly painted to evangelize and reinforce Christian doctrine.&lt;ref name="chicano"&gt;{{Cite thesis |type=PhD |chapter= |title=The Chicano Mural movement of the Southwest: Populist public art and Chicano political activism |author= John Eugene Kenny |year=2006 |publisher= University of New Orleans |oclc=3253092 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern tradition has its roots in the 19th century, with this use of political and social themes. The first Mexican mural painter to use philosophical themes in his work was [[Juan Cordero]] in the mid 19th century. Although he did mostly work with religious themes such as the cupola of the [[Santa Teresa la Antigua|Santa Teresa Church]] and other churches, he painted a secular mural at the request of [[Gabino Barreda]] at the [[Escuela Nacional Preparatoria]] (since disappeared).&lt;ref name="plasmo"&gt;{{cite news |title= Plasmó Juan Cordero primer mural en México con temas filosóficos |newspaper=NOTIMEX |location=Mexico City |date=May 27, 2008&lt;!--|918-917-9042--&gt;  |language=Spanish |trans-title=Juan Cordero plastered the first mural with philosophical themes in Mexico }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:José Guadalupe Posada, Calavera oaxaqueña, broadsheet, 1903.jpg|thumb|1903 broadsheet by [[José Guadalupe Posada]].]]

The latter 19th century was dominated politically by the [[Porfirio Díaz]] regime. This government was the first to push for the cultural development of the country, supporting the [[Academy of San Carlos]] and sending promising artists abroad to study. However, this effort left out indigenous culture and people, with the aim of making [[Mexico]] like [[Europe]].&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; [[Dr. Atl|Gerardo Murillo, also known as Dr. Atl]], is considered to be the first modern Mexican muralists with the idea that Mexican art should reflect Mexican life.&lt;ref name="sbcounty"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sbcounty.gov/museum/media/press-kit/contretas/contreras-media-kit-mural-tradition.pdf |title= The art of Ramón Contreras and the Mexican Muralists movement |publisher= San Bernardino County Museum  |accessdate=June 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Academy training and the government had only promoted imitations of European art.  Atl and other early muralists pressured the Diaz government to allow them to paint on building walls to escape this formalism.&lt;ref name="inehrm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inehrm.gob.mx/Portal/PtMain.php?pagina=exp-muralismo-en-la-revolucion-articulo |title=El muralismo y la Revolución Mexicana |author=) Luz Elena Mainero del Castillo |publisher=Instituto Nacional de Estudios Históricos de las Revoluciones de México |location=Mexico |year=2012 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Muralism asn the Mexican Revolution |accessdate=June 27, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514210135/http://www.inehrm.gob.mx/Portal/PtMain.php?pagina=exp-muralismo-en-la-revolucion-articulo |archivedate=May 14, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Atl also organized an independent exhibition of native Mexican artists promoting many indigenous and national themes along with color schemes that would later appear in mural painting.&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/hispanic_heritage/article-253341 |title= Populist art and the Mexican mural renaissance |work= Hispanic Heritage in the Americas -Latin American art |publisher= Britannica  |accessdate=June 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first modern Mexican mural, painted by Atl, was a series of female nudes using “Atlcolor” a substance Atl invented himself, very shortly before the beginning of the [[Mexican Revolution]] .&lt;ref name="dratl"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1205-dr-atl-and-the-revolution-in-mexico-s-art |title=Dr. Atl and the revolution in Mexico's art  |last1=Burton |first1=Tony |date=March 14, 2008 |issn=1028-9089 |publisher=Mexconnect newsletter |accessdate=June 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another influence on the young artists of the late Porfirian period was the graphic work of [[José Guadalupe Posada]], who mocked European styles and created cartoons with social and political criticism.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

The [[Mexican Revolution]] itself was the culmination of political and social opposition to [[Porfirio Díaz]] policies. One important oppositional group was a small intellectual community that included [[Antonio Curo]], [[Alfonso Reyes]] and [[José Vasconcelos]]. They promoted a populist philosophy that coincided with the social and political criticism of Atl and Posada and influenced the next generation of painters such as [[Diego Rivera]], [[José Clemente Orozco]] and [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]].&lt;ref name="mexconnect"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1064-mexican-muralists-the-big-three-orozco-rivera-siqueiros |title= Mexican muralists: the big three - Orozco, Rivera, Siqueiros.  |first=Rita |last=Pomade |date= May 5, 2007  |publisher=Mexconnect newsletter |issn=1028-9089 |accessdate=June 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These ideas gained power as a result of the [[Mexican Revolution]], which overthrew the Díaz regime in less than a year.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt; However, there was nearly a decade of fighting among the various factions vying for power. Governments changed frequently with a number of assassinations, including that of [[Francisco I. Madero]] who initiated the struggle. It ended in the early 1920s with one-party rule in the hands of the [[Álvaro Obregón]] faction, which became the [[Partido Revolucionario Institucional]] (PRI).&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; During the Revolution, Atl supported the Carranza faction and promoted the work of Rivera, Orozco and Siqueiros, who would later be the founders of the muralism movement. Through the war and until 1921, Atl continued to paint murals among other activities including teaching the Mexico’s next generation of artists and muralists.&lt;ref name="dratl"/&gt;

In 1921, after the end of the military phase of the Revolution, José Vasconcelos was appointed to head the [[Secretaría de Educación Pública]]. At the time, most of the Mexican population was illiterate and the government needed a way to promote the ideals of the Mexican Revolution. It was Vasconcelos’s idea have a government-backed mural program for this purpose.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; Similar to mural use in the pre Hispanic period and during the colonial period, the purpose of these murals were not simply aesthetic, but social, to promote certain ideals.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; These ideals or principles were to glorify the [[Mexican Revolution]] and the identity of [[Mexico]] as a mestizo nation, with the indigenous promoted as well as the Spanish.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;  The government began to hire the country’s best artists to paint murals, calling some of them home from Europe including [[Diego Rivera]].&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt; These initial muralists included Dr. Atl, [[Ramón Alva de la Canal]], [[Federico Cantú]] and others but the main three would be [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], [[José Clemente Orozco]] and [[Diego Rivera]]. His time as secretary was short but it set how muralism would develop. His image was painted on a tempera mural in 1921 by [[Roberto Montenegro]], but this was short lived. His successor at the Secretaría de Educación Pública ordered it painted out.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; The muralists differed in style and temperament, but all believed that art was for the education and betterment of the people. This was behind their acceptance of these commissions as well as their creation of the Syndicate of Technical Workers, Painters, and Sculptors.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt;

The first government sponsored mural project was on the three levels of interior walls of the old Jesuit institution [[San Ildefonso College|Colegio San Ildefonso]], at that time used for the [[Escuela Nacional Preparatoria]].&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; However, most of the murals in the Escuela National Preparatoria were done by José Clemente Orozco with themes of a mestizo Mexico, the ideas of renovation and the tragedies of the Revolution;&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; [[Fernando Leal (artist)|Fernando Leal]] painted ["dancers of Chalma"] "Los danzantes de Chalma", no earlier than 1922. Opposite that mural, [[Jean Charlot]] painted ''La conquista de Tenochtitlán'' (Conquest of Tenochtitlan) by Jean Charlot—invited by Leal.&lt;ref name="folgarait"&gt; {{cite book |title= Mural painting and Social Revolution in Mexico 1920-1940  |last= Folgariat |first= Leonard |year=1998 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |location= Cambridge |isbn=0-521-58147-8 |pages=42-46 }} &lt;/ref&gt; 

===After the mural project at the National Preparatory High School===
This project at the institution was followed by projects at the [[National Palace (Mexico)|Palacio Nacional]], the interior walls of the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]], the [[Chapingo Autonomous University|Escuela Nacional de Chapingo]] the Escuela Nacional de Medicina and the [[Secretariat of Public Education Main Headquarters|Secretaria de Educación Pública building]] among many others.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt;

The movement was strongest from the 1920s to the 1950s, which corresponded to the country’s transformation from a mostly rural and mostly illiterate society to an industrialized one. While today they are part of Mexico’s identity, at the time they were controversial, especially those with socialist messages plastered on centuries-old colonial buildings.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; One of the basic underpinnings of the nascence of a post revolutionary Mexican art was that it should be public, available to the citizenry and above all not the province of a few wealthy collectors.  The great societal upheaval made the concept possible as well as a lack of relatively wealthy middle class to support the arts.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; On this, the painters and the government agreed. One other point of agreement was that artists should have complete freedom of expression. This would lead to another element added to the murals over their development. In addition to the original ideas of a reconstructed Mexico and the elevation of Mexico’s indigenous and rural identity, many of the muralists, including the three main painters, also included elements of [[Marxism]], especially the struggle of the working class against oppression.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt;

The inception and early years of Mexico's muralist movement are often considered the most ideologically pure and untainted by contradictions between socialist ideals and government manipulation. This initial phase is referred to as the "heroic" phase while the period after 1930 is the "statist" phase with the transition to the latter phase caused by José Vasconcelos's resignation in 1924.&lt;ref name="Coffey 2002 7–38"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coffey|first=Mary|title=Muralism and The People: Culture, Popular Citizenship, and Government in Post-Revolutionary Mexico|journal=The Communication Review|year=2002|volume=5|pages=7–38|doi=10.1080/10714420212350}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar Mary Coffey describes those who "acknowledge a change but refrain from judgment about its consequences" as taking the soft line and those who see all murals after 1930 as "propaganda for a corrupt state" as taking a hard line.&lt;ref name="Coffey 2002 7–38"/&gt;  Another stance is that the evolution of Mexican muralism as having an uncomplicated relationship with the government and as an accurate reflection of avant-garde and proletariat sentiments. However, hard liners see the movement as complicit in the corrupt government's power consolidation under the guise of a socialist regime.&lt;ref name="Coffey 2002 7–38"/&gt;

Art historian Leonard Folgarait has a slightly different view. He marks 1940 as the end of the post-revolutionary period in Mexico as well as the renaissance era of the muralist movement.&lt;ref name="Leonard 1998 7"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leonard|first=Folgarait|title=Mural Painting and Social Revolution in Mexico, 1920-1940: Art of the New Order|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conclusion of the Lázaro Cárdenas administration (1934 – 1940) and the beginning of the Manuel Avila Camacho (1940 – 1946) administration saw the rise of an ultraconservative Mexico.&lt;ref name="Leonard 1998 7"/&gt;  The country’s policy was aimed at maintaining and strengthening a capitalist society.&lt;ref name="Leonard 1998 7"/&gt; Mural artists like the Big Three spent the post-revolutionary period developing their work based on the promises of a better future, and with the advent of conservatism they lost their subject and their voice.

The Mexican government began to distance itself from mural projects and mural production became relatively privatized. This privatization was a result of patronage from the growing national bourgeoisie. Murals were increasingly contracted for theaters, banks, and hotels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Bruce|title=Mexican Murals in Times of Crisis|year=2003|publisher=The University of Arizona Press|location=Tucson|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mexican populist art production from the 1920s to the 1950s is often grouped under the name of “Escuela Mexicana de Pintura (y Escultura) (Mexican School of Painting and Sculpture), coined in the 1930s by art historians and critics. The term is not well-defined as it does not distinguish among some important stylistic and thematic difference, there is no firm agreement which artists belong to it nor if muralism should be considered part of it or separate.&lt;ref name="anos30"&gt;{{cite news |title= Testigo de los anos 30 |author=James Oles |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=January 12, 2000 |page=1 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Witness to the 1930s }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="minima"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.arts-history.mx/artmex/tema3.html |title=Escuela Mexicana de Pintura y Escultura |publisher=Artes e Historia magazine |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title=Mexican School of Painting and Sculpting |accessdate=June 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not a school in the classic sense of the word as it includes work by more than one generation and with different styles that sometimes clash. However, it does involve a number of important characteristics. Mexican School mural painting was a combination of public ideals and artistic aesthetics “positioned as a constituent of the official public sphere.” &lt;ref name="Campbell 2003 55"&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Bruce|title=Mexican Murals in Times of Crisis|year=2003|publisher=University of Arizona Press|location=Tucson|isbn=0-8165-2239-1|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three formal components of official Mexican muralism are defined as:
1) Direct participation in official publicity and discourse&lt;ref name="Campbell 2003 71"&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Bruce|title=Mexican Murals in Times of Crisis|year=2003|publisher=University of Arizona Press|location=Tucson|isbn=0-8165-2239-1|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;
2) Reciprocal integration of the visual discourse of the mural to an array of communicative practices participant in defining official publicity (including a variety of scriptural genres, but also public speech, debate and provocative public “event”)&lt;ref name="Campbell 2003 71"/&gt;
3) The development and public thematizing of a social-realist aesthetic (albeit multiform in character) as the visual register for the public sense of the mural work and as the doxic, or unquestioned, limits for public dispute over the representational space of the mural image&lt;ref name="Campbell 2003 71"/&gt;
Most painters in this school worked in [[Mexico City]] or other cities in [[Mexico]], working almost uninterrupted on projects and/or as teachers, generally with support of the government. Most were concerned with the history and identity of [[Mexico]] and politically active. Most art from this school was not created for direct sale but rather for diffusion in both Mexico and abroad. Most were formally trained, often studying in Europe and/or in the Academy of San Carlos.&lt;ref name="minima"/&gt;  
[[File:Fragmento Mural Alfredo Zalce 5 057.jpg|thumb|180px|Mural by [[Alfredo Zalce]] at the state government palace in [[Morelia]].]]
A large quantity of murals were produced in most of the country from the 1920s to 1970, generally with themes related to politics and nationalism focused often on the [[Mexican Revolution]], mestizo identity and [[Mesoamerica]]n cultural history.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; These served as a form of cohesion among members of the movement.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; The political and nationalistic aspects had little directly to do with the Mexican Revolution, especially in the later decades. The goal was more to glorify it and its results as a means to legitimatize the post Revolution government.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; The other political orientation was that of [[Marxism]], especially class struggle. This was strongest in the early movement with Rivera, Orozco and Siqueiros all avowed communists.  The political messages became less radical but they remained firmly to the left.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; Much of the mural production glorified the indigenous aspect of Mexican culture, considering it an important factor in the creation of modern Mexico. This was added with the idea of reexamining the country’s history from a different perspective. One other aspect that most of the muralists shared was a rejection of the idea that art was only for the elite, but rather as a benefit for the masses.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt;

The murals took on monumental status because of where they were situated, mostly on the walls of colonial era government buildings and the themes that were painted.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; The mural painters of [[Mexico]] freely shared ideas and techniques as they were a closely knit group. However, the work of each was distinctive as the government did not set style and artists can generally be deduced without looking at signatures.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt; Techniques included the revival of old techniques such as the [[fresco]], painting on freshly plastered walls and [[encaustic painting|encaustic or hot wax painting]] .&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; Others used mosaics and high fire ceramics, as well as metal parts, and layers of cement.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; The most innovative of the artists was Siqueiros who worked with [[pyroxlene]], a commercial enamel and [[Duco]] (used to paint cars), resins, asbestos, old machinery and was one of the first to use airbrush for artistic purposes. He pored, sprayed, dripped and splattered paint for the effects they created haphazardly.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt;

==Los Tres Grandes==
[[File:RiveraMuralNationalPalace.jpg|thumb|Mural in the main stairwell of the National Palace by Diego Rivera]]
By far, the three most influential muralists from the 20th century are [[Diego Rivera]], [[José Clemente Orozco]], and [[David Siqueiros]], called “los tres grandes” (the three great ones).&lt;ref name="sbcounty"/&gt;&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; All believed that art was the highest form of human expression and a key force in social revolution.&lt;ref name="sbcounty"/&gt; Their work defined the movement taking over from Vasconcelos. It created a mythology around the [[Mexican Revolution]] and the Mexican people which is still influential to this day, as well as promote [[Marxism|Marxist]] ideals. At the time the works were painted, they also served as a form of catharsis over what the country had endured during the war.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; However, the three were different in their artistic expression. Rivera’s works were utopian and idealist, Orozco’s were critical and pessimistic and the most radical were those of Siqueiros, heavily focused on a scientific future.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt; The differences among the three have much to do with how each experienced the [[Mexican Revolution]]. Rivera was in Europe the entire time and did not fight. He never depicted the horrors of the war but what he perceived to be the social benefits from it. The other two did and both did express the horrors of war in their work.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; There was resentment to Rivera by the other two because of it, especially from Siqueiros.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;
[[File:La abolición de la esclavitud de Orozco.JPG|thumb|left|[[Miguel Hidalgo]] abolishing slavery by José Clemente Orozco]]
Of the three, Rivera was the most traditional in terms of painting styles, drawing heavily from European modernism. In his narrative mural images, Rivera incorporated elements of cubism&lt;ref name="Campbell 2003 55"/&gt; His themes were Mexican, often scenes of everyday life and images of ancient Mexico. He originally painted this in bright colors in the European style but modified it to more earthy tones to imitate indigenous murals. His greatest contribution is the promotion of Mexico’s indigenous past into how many people both inside and outside of the country view it.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt;

Orozco also began with a European style of expression. However his art developed into an angry denunciation of oppression especially by those he considered to be an evil and brutal rules class.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; His work was somber and dire, with emphasis on human suffering and fear of the technology of the future.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt; His work shows an "expressionist use of color, slashing lines, and parodic distortions of the human figure." &lt;ref name="Cambell 2003 55"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cambell|first=Bruce|title=Mexican Murals in Times of Crisis|year=2003|publisher=University of Arizona Press|location=Tucson|isbn=0-8165-2239-1|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like most other muralists, Orozco condemned the Spanish as destroyers of indigenous culture, but he did have kinder depictions such as that of a Franciscan friar tending to an emaciated indigenous period.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; Unlike other artists, Orozco never glorified the [[Mexican Revolution]], having fought in it, but rather depicted the horrors of this war. It caused many of his murals to be heavily criticized and even defaced.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt;
[[File:PolyforumSiqueiros05.jpg|thumb|View of the Polyforum Cultural Siqueiros in Mexico City]]
Siqueiros was the youngest and most radical of the three. He joined the [[Venustiano Carranza]] army when he was eighteen and experienced the Revolution from the front lines.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; Although all three muralists were communists, Siqueiros was the most dedicated, as evidenced by his portrayals of the proletarian masses. His work is also characterized with rapid, sweeping, bold lines and the use of modern enamels, machinery and other elements related to technology. His style showed a "futurist blurring of form and technique." His fascination with technology as it relates to art was exemplified when he emphasized the mass communications visual technology of photograph and motion picture in his eventual movement toward neorealism.&lt;ref name="Cambell 2003 55"/&gt; His radical politics made him unwelcome in [[Mexico]] and the [[United States]], so he did much of his work in [[South America]].&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt; However, his masterpiece is considered to be the [[Polyforum Cultural Siqueiros]], located in Mexico City.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;

The Big Three struggled to express their leftist leanings after the initial years painting murals under government supervision. These struggles with the post-revolution government lead the muralists to create a union of artists and produce a radical manifesto. [[José Vasconcelos]], the Secretary of Public Education under President [[Álvaro Obregón]] (1920–24) contracted Rivera, Siqueiros, and Orozco to pursue painting with the moral and financial support of the new post-revolutionary government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Richardson|first=William|title=The Dilemmas of a Communist Artist: Diego Rivera in Moscow, 1927-1928|journal=Mexican Studies|year=1987|volume=3|issue=1|pages=49–69|jstor=4617031|doi=10.2307/4617031}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vasconcelos, while seeking to promote nationalism and “raza cosmica,” seemed to contradict this sentiment as he guided the muralists to create works in a classic, European style. The murals became a target of Vasconcelos’s criticism when the Big Three departed from classical proportion and figure. Siqueiros was dissatisfied with the incongruity between the murals and the revolutionary concerns of the muralists, and he advocated discussion among the artists of their future works.

In 1922 the muralists founded the Union of Revolutionary Technical Workers, Painters, and Sculptors of Mexico. The Union then released a manifesto listing education, art of public utility, and beauty for all as the social goals of their future artistic endeavors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cambell|first=Bruce|title=Mexican Murals in Times of Crisis|year=2003|publisher=University of Arizona Press|location=Tucson|isbn=0-8165-2239-1|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After nearly a century since the beginning of the movement, Mexican artists still produce murals and other forms of art with the same “mestizo” message. Murals can be found in government buildings, former churches and schools in nearly every part of the country.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;&lt;ref name="crosscultural"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hubbard |first=Kathy |date=September 2010 |title= A CROSS-CULTURAL COLLABORATION: Using Visual Culture for the Creation of a Socially Relevant Mural in Mexico |journal=Art Education |volume=63 |issue=5 |pages=68–75 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One recent example is a cross cultural project in 2009 to paint a mural in the [[Traditional fixed markets in Mexico|municipal market]] of [[Teotitlán del Valle]], a small town in the state of [[Oaxaca]]. High school and college students from [[State of Georgia|Georgia]], [[United States]], collaborated with town authorities to design and paint a mural to promote nutrition, environmental protection, education and the preservation of [[Zapotec language]] and customs.&lt;ref name="crosscultural"/&gt;

Mexican muralism brought mural painting back to the forefront of Western art in the 20th century with its influence spreading abroad, especially promoting the idea of mural painting as a form of promoting social and political ideas.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; It offered an alternative to non-representational abstraction after [[World War I]] with figurative works that reflect society and its immediate concerns. While most Mexican muralists had little desire to be part of the international art scene, their influence spread to other parts of the Americas. Notable muralists influenced by Mexican muralism include [[Carlos Mérida]] of [[Guatemala]], [[Oswaldo Guayasamín]] of [[Ecuador]] and [[Candido Portinari]] of [[Brazil]] .&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

[[File:Fragmento Mural Alfredo Zalce 1 051.jpg|thumb|View of the mural in the Palacio de Gobierno]]
Rivera, Orozco, and Siqueiros all spent time in the United States. Orozco was the first to paint murals in the late 1920s at [[Pomona College]] in [[Claremont, California]], staying until 1934 and becoming popular with academic institutions.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sbcounty"/&gt; During the [[Great Depression]], the [[Works Progress Administration]] employed artists to paint murals, which paved the way for Mexican muralists to find commissions in the country.&lt;ref name="sbcounty"/&gt;  Rivera lived in the United States from 1930 to 1934. During this time, he put on an influential show of his easel work at the [[Museum of Modern Art]].&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sbcounty"/&gt; The success of Orozco and Rivera prompted U.S. artists to study in Mexico and opened doors for many other Mexican artists to find work in the country.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; Siqueiros did not fare as well. He was exiled to the US from Mexico in 1932, moving to [[Los Angeles]]. During this time, he painted three murals, but they were painted over.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sbcounty"/&gt; The only one of the three to survive, [[América Tropical: Oprimida y Destrozada por los Imperialismos|''América Tropical'']] (full name: ''América Tropical: Oprimida y Destrozada por los Imperialismos'', or ''Tropical America: Oppressed and Destroyed by Imperialism''&lt;ref&gt;Del Barco, Mandalit.  [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130519329 Revolutionary Mural To Return To L.A. After 80 Years.]  npr. October 26, 2010.  Retrieved June 19, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;), was restored by the [[Getty Conservation Institute]] and the América Tropical Interpretive Center opened to provide public access.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Christopher.

Retrieved June 19, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of mural as political message was transplanted to the United States, especially in the former Mexican territory of the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]]. It served as inspiration to the later [[Chicano]] muralism but the political messages are different.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; Revolutionary Nicaragua developed a tradition of muralism during the [[Sandinista]] period.&lt;ref&gt;David Kunzle, ''The Murals of Revolutionary Nicaragua, 1979-1992''.

The '''National Theatre''' ({{lang-sr|Народно позориште у Суботици}} / ''{{lang|sr-Latn|Narodno Pozorište u Subotici}}''; {{lang-hr|Narodno kazalište u Subotici}}; {{lang-hu|Népszínház}}) is a theater in [[Subotica]], [[Serbia]].

==Reconstruction==
[[File:Pozoriste Subotica - Rekonstrukcija.jpg|thumb|right|250px|National Theatre reconstruction, 2008]]
The original building of the theater, which was built in 1854 as the first monumental public building in Subotica, was razed with the purpose of reconstruction by City authorities in 2007, although it was declared a historic monument under state protection in 1983,{{cn|date=July 2012}} and in 1991 it was added to the National Register as a monument of an extraordinary cultural value.{{cn|date=July 2012}} An international campaign was organized both in Serbia and in Hungary to save the original building.{{cn|date=July 2012}} ICOMOS and INTBAU also protested against the decision, but with no avail.{{cn|date=July 2012}} According to some opinions, the old town center of Subotica was severely damaged visually by this action.{{cn|date=July 2012}} Some scanty remains of the destroyed building will be allegedly incorporated into the new theater.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1067">'''Open catalogue''' is an [[open content]] catalogue or [[free content]] catalogue, a structured database with information about products or other stored items in a standardized format. A catalogue implies [[categorization]] or classification of the items involved, and [[database normalization]] to increase the usability of the catalogue for searching &amp; finding, and comparing items within the same category on their main attributes. 

The term was first used by Dr. Martijn Hoogeveen of the [[Open University (Netherlands)]] for the [[Open ICEcat]] project, which resulted in an open catalogue for product information, often used by merchants as input for their [[mail-order catalogue]]. A DTD for  the [[Open Catalog Exchange Format]] is developed by Sergey Shvets and Dimitry Mitko.

'''Patentleft''' (also '''patent left''', '''copyleft-style patent license''' or '''open patent''') is the practice of licensing [[patent]]s (especially [[biological patent]]s) for [[royalties|royalty]]-free use, on the condition that adopters license related improvements they develop under the same terms. Copyleft-style licensors seek "continuous growth of a universally accessible technology commons" from which they, and others, will benefit.&lt;!-- quote pg 183 --&gt;&lt;ref name="biobazaar"&gt;{{cite book

''Patentleft'' is analogous to [[copyleft]], a license which allows distribution of a [[copyright]]ed work and derived works, but only under the same terms.

==Uses==
The [[Biological Innovation for Open Society]] (BiOS) project implemented a patentleft system to encourage re-contribution and collaborative innovation of their technology. BiOS holds a patented technology for transferring genes in plants, and licenses the technology under the terms that, if a license holder improves the gene transfer tool and patents the improvement, then their improvement must be made available to all the other license holders.&lt;ref&gt;John T. Wilbanks and [[Thomas J. Wilbanks]], "Science, Open Communication and Sustainable Development", 13 April 2010, "[http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/2/4/993/]"&lt;/ref&gt;

The open patent idea is designed to be practiced by [[consortium|consortia]] of research-oriented companies&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bios.net/daisy/bios/10/version/live/part/4/data Cambia Biosciences Initiative]&lt;/ref&gt; and increasingly by [[standards body|standards bodies]].  These also commonly use [[open trademark]] methods to ensure some compliance with a suite of compatibility tests, e.g. [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[X/Open]] both of which forbid use of the mark by the non-compliant.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

On October 12, 2001 the [[Free Software Foundation]] and Finite State Machine Labs Inc. (FSMLabs) announced a [[GNU General Public License|GPL]] - compliant open-patent license for FSMLabs' [[software patent]], {{Cite patent|US|5995745}}. Titled the Open RTLinux patent license Version 2, it provides for usage of this patent in accordance with the GPL.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gnu.org/press/2001-09-18-RTLinux.html FSF/FSMLabs press release for the RTLinux Open Patent License], October 12, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
Person A has a patent, and licenses it under a patentleft license.

Person B has two patents in her product and wants to use Person A's patents in that product. Person B also wants to charge royalties for her two patents. She decides to use Person A's patent, but now must license her patents, royalty-free, under the same terms as Person A's patent.

Person C has three patents in his product and wants to use Person B's two patents in that product, but doesn't want to use Person A's patent. Person C also wants to charge royalties for his three patents. He decides to use Person B's patent, but now must license his patents, royalty-free, under the same terms as Person A's patent.

The '''Prince Edward Island Council of the Arts''' (PEICA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About the Prince Edward Island Council of the Arts |url=http://peica.ca/about/ |archivedate=6 July 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706192916/http://peica.ca/about/ |date=6 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; established in 1974, provides vital support to the arts on [[Prince Edward Island]] and acts as the province's arts funding agency comparable to like organizations in other [[Canadian provinces|Canadian Provinces]]. Dedicated to ensuring that all Prince Edward Islanders enjoy the benefits of a healthy arts community, PEICA works to foster the development of the arts through advocacy, education, programs and services. The [[Lieutenant Governor of Prince Edward Island|Lieutenant-Governor of Prince Edward Island]] is the Patron for PEICA. 

PEICA is governed by a volunteer board of directors who are elected from members in good standing at the annual general meeting. Additional expertise is brought to the board through members-at-large from the arts and business communities, an executive director and support staff. PEICA Governance and By-Law documents set out the rules under which the board and the staff operate.

PEICA enjoys an arms-length relationship with the Department of Tourism and Culture of the [[Government of Prince Edward Island]], which contributes the majority of PEICA’s funding. These funds are administered by PEICA on the Department’s behalf, and are allocated to grant programs and services for artists and arts administrators.

The purpose of PEICA grant funding is to promote and support the creation and presentation of works of art, and to develop the capacity of artists and arts organizations throughout the Province. Grant proposals are adjudicated through process of peer assessment, thereby empowering the members of the arts community to determine the best investment of public arts funds in a fair and objective manner.

The Council works in partnership with the arts community of Prince Edward Island, the Council’s membership, the government and people of Prince Edward Island, to fulfill its mission to make the Arts integral to the lives of all Prince Edward Islanders.

PEI Arts offers grants up to maximum:

* Established Professional Artists: $8,000
* Emerging Professional Artists: $5,000

'''Separation of content and presentation''' (or '''separation of content and style''') is the [[separation of concerns]] design principle as applied to the authoring and presentation of content. Under this principle, visual and design aspects (presentation and style) are separated from the core material and structure (content) of a document.&lt;ref name="ALA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://alistapart.com/article/separationdilemma|title=Separation: The Web Designer’s Dilemma|work=[[A List Apart]]|accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| publisher = USPTO | last1 = Ferrel| first1 = P.J.| last2 = Meyer| first2 = R.F.| last3 = Millet| first3 = S.J.| last4 = Shewchuk| first4 = J.P.| last5 = Smith| first5 = W.W.| title = Method for delivering separate design and content in a multimedia publishing system| date = March 6, 2001|id=Patent #6199082}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{secondary source needed|date=June 2017}} A typical analogy used to explain this principle is the distinction between the human skeleton (as the structural component) and human flesh (as the visual component) which makes up the body's appearance. Common applications of this principle are seen in [[Web design]] ([[HTML]] and [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]])&lt;ref name="SFU"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cs.sfu.ca/CourseCentral/165/common/study-guide/content/css-separate.html|title=Separating Content and Appearance|work=[[Simon Fraser University]]|accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clark|first=Dave|year=2007|title=Content Management and the Separation of Presentation and Content|journal=Technical Communication Quarterly|volume=17|issue=1|pages=35–60|issn=1057-2252|doi=10.1080/10572250701588624}}&lt;/ref&gt; and markup language (see [[LaTeX]]).

== Use in Web design ==
This principle is not a rigid guideline, but serves more as [[best practice]] for keeping appearance and structure separate. In many cases, the [[Web design|design]] and [[Web development|development]] aspects of a project are performed by different people, so keeping both aspects separated ensures both initial production accountability and later maintenance simplification, as in the ''[[don't repeat yourself]]'' (DRY) principle.

== Use in writing ==

[[LaTeX]] is a document markup language that focuses primarily on the content and structure of a document. With this methodology, [[Academic writing|academic writings]] and publication can be structured and styled with minimal effort by the creator, and can be quickly reformatted for different purposes.

'''Soviet art''' is the [[visual art]] that was produced in the [[Soviet Union]].

==Soviet Avant-Garde art==

During the [[Bolshevik Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] a movement was initiated to put all arts to service of the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]]. The instrument for this was created just days before the [[October Revolution]], known as [[Proletkult]], an abbreviation for "Proletarskie kulturno-prosvetitelnye organizatsii" (Proletarian Cultural and Enlightenment Organizations). A prominent theorist of this movement was [[Aleksandr Bogdanov]]. Initially [[Narkompros]] (ministry of education), which was also in charge of the arts, supported Proletkult. However the latter sought too much independence from the ruling [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] of [[Bolsheviks]], gained negative attitude of [[Vladimir Lenin]], by 1922 declined considerably, and was eventually disbanded in 1932.
The ideas of Proletkult attracted the interests of [[Russian avantgarde]], who strived to  get rid of the conventions of "bourgeois art". Among notable persons of this movement was [[Kazimir Malevich]]. However the ideas of the avantgarde eventually clashed with the newly emerged state-sponsored direction of [[Socialist Realism]].

In search of new forms of expression, the Proletkult organisation was highly eclectic in its art forms, and thus was prone to harsh criticism for inclusion of such modern directions as [[impressionism]] and [[cubism]], since these movements existed before the revolution and hence were associated with "decadent bourgeois art".

Among early experiments of Proletkult was [[pragmaic aesthetic|pragmatic aesthetic]] of [[industrial art]], the prominent theoretist being [[Boris Arvatov]].

Another group was [[UNOVIS]], a very short-lived but influential collection of young artists led by [[Kasimir Malevich]] in the 1920s.

==Socialist realism==
{{Main|Socialist realism}}

Officially approved art was required to follow the doctrine of [[Socialist Realism]]. In the spring of 1932, the Central Committee of the Communist Party decreed that all existing literary and artistic groups and organizations should be disbanded and replaced with unified associations of creative professions. Accordingly, the Moscow and Leningrad Union of Artists was established on August 1932, which brought the history of post-revolutionary art to a close. The epoch of Soviet art began.&lt;ref&gt;Sergei V. Ivanov. ''Unknown Socialist Realism: The Leningrad School'', pp. 28–29. {{ISBN|5-901724-21-6}}, {{ISBN|978-5-901724-21-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The best known Soviet artists were [[Isaak Brodsky]], [[Alexander Nikolayevich Samokhvalov|Alexander Samokhvalov]], [[Boris Ioganson]], [[Aleksandr Deyneka]], [[Aleksandr Ivanovich Laktionov|Aleksandr Laktionov]], [[:ru:Непринцев, Юрий Михайлович|Yuri Neprintsev]] and other painters from Moscow and Leningrad School.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leningradartist.com/outline.htm ''Segei V. Ivanov.'' The Leningrad School of painting 1930 – 1990s. Historical outline.]&lt;/ref&gt; Moscow artist [[Aleksandr Gerasimov (painter)|Aleksandr Gerasimov]] during his career produced a large number of heroic paintings of [[Joseph Stalin]] and other members of the [[Politburo]]. [[Nikita Khrushchev]] later alleged that [[Kliment Voroshilov]] spent more time posing in Gerasimov's studio than he did attending to his duties in the People's Commissariat of Defense. Gerasimov's painting shows a mastery of classical representational techniques.

However, art exhibitions of 1935–1960 disprove the claims that artistic life of the period was suppressed by the ideology and artists submitted entirely to what was then called ‘social order’. A great number of landscapes, portraits, genre paintings and studies exhibited at the time pursued purely technical purposes and were thus free from any ideology. Thematic painting was also approached in a similar way.&lt;ref&gt;Vern G. Swanson, ''Soviet Impressionist Painting.'' Woodbridge, England: Antique Collectors' Club, 2008; p. 400.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the post-war period between the mid-1950s and 1960s, the [[:ru:Ленинградская школа живописи|Leningrad school]] was approaching its apex. Artists who had graduated from the Academy ([[Repin Institute of Arts]]) in the 1930s–50s were in their prime. They were quick to present their art, they strived for experiments and were eager to appropriate a lot and to learn even more. Their time and contemporaries, with all its images, ideas and dispositions found it full expression in portraits by [[:ru:Русов, Лев Александрович|Lev Russov]], [[:ru:Орешников, Виктор Михайлович|Victor Oreshnikov]], Boris Korneev, Semion Rotnitsky, Vladimir Gorb, Engels Kozlov, landscapes by [[:ru:Тимков, Николай Ефимович|Nikolai Timkov]], [[:ru:Овчинников, Владимир Иванович|Vladimir Ovchinnikov]], [[:ru:Осипов, Сергей Иванович|Sergei Osipov]], [[:ru:Семенов, Александр Михайлович|Alexander Semionov]], [[:ru:Семенов, Арсений Никифорович|Arseny Semionov]], Nikolai Galakhov, genre paintings by [[:ru:Позднеев, Николай Матвеевич|Nikolai Pozdneev]], [[:ru:Непринцев, Юрий Михайлович|Yuri Neprintsev]], Yevsey Moiseenko, Andrey Milnikov. Art of this period showed extraordinary taste for life and creative work.

In 1957, the first all-Russian Congress of Soviet artists took place in Moscow. In 1960, the all-Russian Union of Artists was organized. Accordingly, these events influenced the art life in Moscow, Leningrad and province. The scope of experimentation was broadened; in particular, this concerned the form and painterly and plastic language. Images of youths and students, rapidly changing villages and cities, virgin lands brought under cultivation, grandiose construction plans being realized in Siberia and the Volga region, great achievements of Soviet science and technology became the chief topics of the new painting. Heroes of the time – young scientists, workers, civil engineers, physicians – become the most popular heroes of paintings.

At this period, life provided artists with plenty of thrilling topics, positive figures and images. Legacy of many great artists and [[art movements]] became available for study and public discussions again. This greatly broadened artists’ understanding of the [[realist art|realist method]] and widened its possibilities. It was the repeated renewal of the very conception of [[Realism (arts)|realism]] that made this style dominates in the [[Russian art]] throughout its history. Realist tradition gave rise to many trends of [[Contemporary art|contemporary painting]], including painting from nature, "severe style" painting and decorative art. However, during this period [[impressionism]], [[postimpressionism]], [[cubism]] and [[expressionism]] also had their fervent adherents and interpreters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leningradschool.com/outline.htm ''Sergei V. Ivanov.'' The Leningrad School of painting 1930 – 1990s. Historical outline.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soviet Nonconformist Art==
{{Main|Soviet Nonconformist Art}}

The death of [[Joseph Stalin]] in 1953, and [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s [[Khrushchev Thaw|Thaw]], paved the way for a wave of liberalization in the arts throughout the [[Soviet Union]].  Although no official change in policy took place, artists began to feel free to experiment in their work, with considerably less fear of repercussions than during the Stalinist period.

In the 1950s Moscow artist [[Ely Bielutin]] encouraged his students to experiment with [[abstractionism]], a practice thoroughly discouraged by the [[Creative unions in the Soviet Union|Artists' Union]], which strictly enforced the official policy of [[Socialist Realism]].  Artists who chose to paint in alternative styles had to do so completely in private and were never able to exhibit or sell their work. As a result, [[Nonconformist Art]] developed along a separate path than the [[Official Art]] that was recorded in the history books.

[[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] magazine published two portraits by two painters, who to their mind, were most representative of Russian Arts of the period: it was Serov, an official Soviet icon and [[Anatoly Zverev]], an underground [[Russian avant-garde]] expressionist.  Serov's portrait of [[Vladimir Lenin]] and Zverev's selfportrait were associated by many with an eternal Biblical struggle of Satan and Saviour.  When Khrushchev learned about the publication he was outraged and forbade all contacts with Western visitors, closed down all semi legal exhibitions.  And of course Zverev was the main target of his outrage.

The [[Soviet Nonconformist Art#Lianozovo|Lianozovo Group]] was formed around the artist [[Oscar Rabin (artist)|Oscar Rabin]] in the 1960s and included artists such as [[Valentina Kropivnitskaya]], [[Vladimir Nemukhin]], and [[Lydia Masterkova]].  While not adhering to any common style, these artists sought to faithfully express themselves in the mode they deemed appropriate, rather than adhere to the propagandistic style of [[Socialist Realism]].

Tolerance of Nonconformist Art by the authorities underwent an ebb and flow until the ultimate collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991.  Artists took advantage of the first few years after the death of Stalin to experiment in their work without the fear of persecution.  In 1962, artists experienced a slight setback when [[Nikita Khrushchev]] appeared at the exhibition of the 30th anniversary of the Moscow Artist's Union at the [[Moscow Manege]] exhibition hall, an episode known as the [[Manege Affair]].  Among the customary works of [[Socialist Realism]] were a few abstract works by artists such as [[Ernst Neizvestny]] and [[Eli Beliutin]], which Khrushchev criticized as being "shit," and the artists for being "homosexuals."  The message was clear: artistic policy was not as liberal as everyone had hoped.

The history of late Soviet art has been dominated by politics and simplistic formulae. Both within the artworld and the general public, very little consideration has been given to the aesthetic character of the work produced in the USSR in the 1970s and 1980s. Instead, the official and unofficial art of the period usually stood in for either "bad" or "good" political developments.  A more nuanced picture would emphasize that there were numerous competing groups making art in Moscow and Leningrad throughout this period. The most important figures for the international art scene have been the Moscow artists Ilya Kabakov, Erik Bulatov, Andrei Monastyrsky, Vitaly Komar and Aleksandr Melamid.

The most infamous incident regarding nonconformist artists in the former Soviet Union was the 1974 [[Bulldozer Exhibition]], which took place in a park just outside Moscow, and included work by such artists as [[Oscar Rabin (artist)|Oscar Rabin]], [[Komar and Melamid]], [[Alexandr Zhdanov]], [[Nikolai Smoliakov]] and [[Leonid Sokov]].  The artists involved had written to the authorities for permission to hold the exhibition but received no answer to their request.  They decided to go ahead with the exhibition anyway, which consisted solely of unofficial works of art that did not fit into the rubric of [[Socialist Realism]].  The [[KGB]] put an end to the exhibition just hours after it opened by bringing in bulldozers to completely destroy all of the artworks present.  However, the foreign press had been there to witness the event, and the worldwide coverage of it forced the authorities to permit an exhibition of Nonconformist Art two weeks later in [[Izmailovsky Park]] in Moscow.

A few West European collectors, supported during the 60th and the 70th and until 1988 (the year of the Perestroika) many of the artists in the old Soviet Union. One of the leading collectors and philanthropists were the couple Kenda and Jacob Bar-Gera. The Bar-Gera Collection consists of some 200 works of 59 Soviet Russian artists of who did not want to embrace the official art directive of the post-Stalinist Soviet Union. Kenda and Jacob Bar-Gera, both are survivors of the holocaust, supported these partially persecuted artists by sending them money or painting material from Germany to the Soviet Union. Even though the Kenda and Jacob did not meet the artists in person, they bought many of their paintings and other art objects. The works were smuggled to Germany by hiding them in the suitcases of diplomats, traveling businessmen, and students, thus making the Bar-Gera Collection of Russian Non-Conformists among the largest of its kind in the world. Among others, the collection content works of Bachtschanjan Vagritsch, Jankilevskij Wladimir,Rabin  Oskar, Batschurin Ewganij, Kabakov Ilja, Schablavin Sergei, Belenok Piotr, Krasnopevcev Dimitrij, Schdanov Alexander, [[Igor Novikov (painter)|Igor Novikov]],
Bitt Galina, Kropivnitzkaja Walentina, Schemjakin Michail, Bobrowskaja Olga, Kropivnitzkij Lew,Schwarzman  Michail, Borisov  Leonid, Kropiwnizkij Jewgenij, Sidur  Vadim, Bruskin Grischa, Kulakov  Michail, Sitnikov  Wasili, and many others.

By the 1980s, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s policies of [[Perestroika]] and [[Glasnost]] made it virtually impossible for the authorities to place restrictions on artists or their freedom of expression.  With the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]], the new market economy enabled the development of a gallery system, which meant that artists no longer had to be employed by the state, and could create work according to their own tastes, as well as the tastes of their private patrons.  Consequently, after around 1986 the phenomenon of Nonconformist Art in the Soviet Union ceased to exist.

The '''St Albans Psalter''', also known as the '''Albani Psalter''' or the '''Psalter of Christina of Markyate''', is an English [[illuminated manuscript]], one of several [[psalter]]s known to have been created at or for [[St Albans Abbey]] in the 12th century.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1982"&gt;Rodney M. Thomson, ''Manuscripts from St. Albans Abbey, 1066-1235'', 2 vols (Woodbridge, published for the University of Tasmania by D. S. Brewer, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely considered to be one of the most important examples of English [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] book production; it is of almost unprecedented lavishness of decoration, with over forty full-page miniatures, and contains a number of iconographic innovations that would endure throughout the Middle Ages. It also contains the earliest surviving example of French literature, the ''Chanson de St Alexis'' or [[Vie de St Alexis]], and it was probably commissioned by an identifiable man and owned by an identifiable woman.  Since the early 19th century it has been owned by the church of [[St. Godehard, Hildesheim|St. Godehard]], but is now stored and administered at the nearby Dombibliothek (Cathedral Library). A single leaf from the manuscript is at the [[Schnütgen Museum]], [[Cologne]];&lt;ref&gt;Anton von Euw, ''Die Handschriften und Einzelblätter des Schnütgen-Museums Köln: Bestandskatalog'' (Cologne, 1997), no. 5 pp. 64-68.&lt;/ref&gt; one further leaf, and one further cutting, are missing from the volume, their whereabouts unknown.

== Contents ==
[[File:Psalm 136 Initial S.jpg|thumb|left|Psalm 136 Initial S]]
The manuscript as it survives in Hildesheim has 209 [[recto and verso|folios]] (i.e. 418 pages) of [[vellum]], which are numbered by a modern hand in Arabic numerals in the top right corner of the rectos, and there's an additional numbering of the miniatures at the bottom of their pages. A full page measures 27.6 x 18.4&amp;nbsp;cm. There are many signs that the pages have been trimmed down from their original size.  The binding is of leather, and medieval, although it was restored in modern times, perhaps the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abdn.ac.uk/stalbanspsalter/english/essays/codicology.shtml#provenance Aberdeen website: Codicology]&lt;/ref&gt;

The manuscript is composed of five physically separable parts:
*  I. (Quire 1; pp.&amp;nbsp;1–16) [http://www.abdn.ac.uk/stalbanspsalter/english/translation/trans002.shtml Calendar and computistical material]

(part of Quire 23; pp.&amp;nbsp;415–418) A bifolium with two full-page miniatures (pp.&amp;nbsp;416–417) depicting the [http://www.abdn.ac.uk/stalbanspsalter/english/translation/trans416.shtml Martyrdom of St Alban], and [http://www.abdn.ac.uk/stalbanspsalter/english/translation/trans417.shtml King David with musicians]

Scholarly opinion differs on many of the details, but there is general agreement that the psalter was created at [[St Albans Abbey]].The first editor [[Adolph Goldschmidt]] considered Roger († ante 1118), hermit and monk of St Albans, to be the scribe of the psalms. The hermit Roger, whose death anniversary (12th September) is recorded in the calendar, is likely to be identical with Roger d'Aubigny, a brother of abbot [[Richard d'Aubigny ]](1087-1119) and father of [[William d'Aubigny (died 1139)|William d'Aubigny (Pincerna)]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernhard Gallistl, ''„A book for Avicia?“ Der Eremit Roger im Psalter von St. Albans'', Concilium medii aevi, 21, 2018, pp. 01–52,[http://cma.gbv.de/dr,cma,021,2018,a,01.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;According to subsequent scholars the St Albans Psalter came into being only during the abbacy (1119-1146) of [[Geoffrey de Gorham]] or Gorron, and it was possibly owned by [[Christina of Markyate]] (c. 1098-c. 1155-1166), anchoress and later prioress of  [[Markyate]], or at least associated with her at some point after her death.&lt;ref name="kirchensculptur1"&gt;Adolph Goldschmidt, ''Der Albanipsalter in Hildesheim und seine Beziehung zur symbolischen Kirchensculptur des XII. Jahrhunderts'' (Berlin, G. Siemens, 1895).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. H. Talbot (ed. and trans.), ''The Life of Christina of Markyate, a Twelfth Century Recluse'' (Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1959); reprinted with addenda and corrigenda in the Oxford Medieval Texts series (1987); reprinted in the Medieval Academy Reprints for Teaching series, vol. 39 (Toronto, Buffalo, 1998); reprinted (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1960"&gt;Otto Pächt, C.

== Details of production ==

Within the accepted c.1120-c.1145 date-range, there is no firm scholarly consensus about the relative and absolute chronology of the creation of the five constituent parts. There are generally thought to be the work of at least six [[scribes]] and four artists in the volume, but there is disagreement about their identity, and who was responsible for what.

Published opinions until the 1960s were mostly that the manuscript was made before c.1125, or even before c.1123;&lt;ref name="kirchensculptur1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1960"/&gt; this was modified in the 1980s to the decade c.1120-1130;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1982"/&gt; while in the 1990s and 2000s several scholars have proposed dates in the 1130s.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bepler1"/&gt; Attributions dating the manuscript to after 1145, or after 1155, have not gained general acceptance.

The main units of text are:
* The main part of the [[calendar]] and computistical material (pp.&amp;nbsp;2–15)
* Two further feasts, added to the calendar
* A large number of feasts and [[obits]], added to the calendar
* The outer [[bifolium]] of the first [[Paper quire|quire]] of the Psalms (pp.&amp;nbsp;73–74, 91-92)
* The rest of the Psalms, [[Litany]], etc.
* The verse written on the pasted-in initial to [[Psalm 105]] (p.&amp;nbsp;285)
* The [[rubrics]] added in or next to most [[historiated initial]]s
* The obit of [[Roger the Hermit]], added to the calendar
* The texts of the quire containing the ''Chanson de St Alexis'' (pp.&amp;nbsp;57–72)
The last three listed are often said to have been written by the same scribe, identified by some as Abbot Geoffrey himself, giving a total of seven scribes. In addition, another 12th-century scribe corrected the text of the Psalms.&lt;ref&gt;''The St Albans Psalter (Albani Psalter)'' [Facsimile commentary by Jochen Bepler, Peter Kidd, and Jane Geddes] (Simbach am Inn, 2008), p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main units of decoration are:
* The calendar, with [[Labours of the Months]] in roundels, and the signs of the zodiac
* The full-page fully painted prefatory [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] containing the [[Life of Christ]] in thirty-seven miniatures, and one of St Martin, preceded by two of [[Adam and Eve]], and followed by one of King [[David]]
* A 'diptych' of two full-page miniatures depicting the Martyrdom of St Alban, and King David with musicians
* The Alexis quire, including the [[Psalm 1]] initial
* The pasted-in Psalm 105 initial
* All the other [[historiated initial]]s
The prefatory miniatures are usually said to be by the artist of the Alexis quire, the so-called [[Alexis Master]]
The majority of the historiated initials are usually said to have been painted by two artists, one of whom was the artist of the calendar and the final 'diptych'.

Since the late 1980s, talent shows have become a notable genre of [[reality television]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Redden|first=Guy|title=Exposing Lifestyle Television: The Big Reveal|year=2008|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|isbn=978-1-4094-9286-3|pages=129–144|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=YNJN-tolIwEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=%22talent+show%22&amp;ots=I7uqlYNPUs&amp;sig=jQ6A2VBPiX_e2DB63bJI0mzSx4o#v=onepage&amp;q=%22talent%20show%22&amp;f=false|chapter=Making Over the Talent Show}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as ''[[Notun Kuri]]'' (1976), ''[[Popstars]]'' (1999), ''[[Star Academy]]'' (2001), [[Idols (TV series)|''Idol'']] (2001), ''[[The X Factor]]'' (2004), ''[[So You Think You Can Dance]]'' (2005), ''[[Got Talent]]'' (2006), ''[[The Voice (TV series)|The Voice]]'' (2010), ''[[Rising Star (TV series)|Rising Star]]'' (2013), ''[[Tri Akkorda (Russian Talent Show)]] (2014)'' and ''[[The Four: Battle for Stardom]] (''2018'')'', which have been critical in catapulting some amateur artists to stardom and resulting in their commercially successful careers.

==Non-competitive talent shows for troubled youths==
Talent shows can be seen as a way to help boost the self-esteem, confidence, and assurance of youth. Some communities and companies see talent shows as a way to help prevent [[juvenile delinquency]] among children, teens, and young adults. As a result, these communities create programs such as ''Girls Only!''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Girls Only! Toolkit|url=http://www.sdcda.org/office/girlsonlytoolkit/toolkit/girls-only-toolkit.pdf|website=San Diego District Attorney's Office|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150528165206/http://www.sdcda.org/office/girlsonlytoolkit/toolkit/girls-only-toolkit.pdf|archivedate=2015-05-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[San Diego]] to promote the growth of these otherwise trouble youth to better the community. Such programs are created with the hope to prevent youth from the possibilities of entering delinquency or lives of crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Girls Only!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4381">[[File:Teatro Modena1.jpg|thumb|290px|Teatro Comunale di Modena, Auditorium]]
The '''Teatro Comunale di Modena''' (Community Theatre of Modena, but renamed in October 2007 as '''Teatro Comunale Luciano Pavarotti''') is an [[opera house]] in the town of [[Modena]], ([[Emilia-Romagna]] province), [[Italy]]. The idea for the creation of the present theatre dates from 1838, when it became apparent that the then-existing ''Teatro Comunale di via Emilia'' (in dual private and public ownership) was no longer suitable for staging opera.  However, this house had been the venue for presentations of all of the works of [[Donizetti]], [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]] and [[Rossini]] up to this time, and a flourishing operatic culture existed in Modena.

Under the Mayor of Modena in collaboration with the Conservatorio dell'Illustrissima Comunita (Conservatory of the Most Illustrious Community), architect Francesco Vandelli was engaged to design the ''Teatro dell'Illustrissima Comunita'', as the theatre was first called, "for the dignity of the city and for the transmission of the scenic arts".&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Lynn, p.191&lt;/ref&gt; Paid for in the manner typical of the time - from the sale of boxes - in addition to a significant gift from Duke Friedrich IV, Vandelli created a design for the new theatre combining ideas from those in [[Piacenza]], [[Mantua]], and [[Milan]], and it opened on 2 October 1841 with a performance of Gandini's ''Adelaide di Borgogna al Castello di Canossa'', an opera specially commissioned for the occasion.  

Meanwhile, in 1841, the ''Teatro Comunale di via Emilia'' was renamed as the ''Teatro Vecchio'' when the present theatre opened, although the ''Vecchio'' finally closed in 1859, the same year as Duke Friedrich V left Modena.  In turn, this caused another renaming and the ''Illustrissima'' became the ''Teatro Municipale''.
[[File:Paolo Monti - Servizio fotografico (Modena, 1973) - BEIC 6348647.jpg|thumb|Exterior. Photo by [[Paolo Monti]], 1973.]]

During the [[First World War]] the theatre was under the control of the army and between 1915 and 1923 it was closed and declared to be unsafe. While opera performances continued to be given elsewhere in the city, it was not until 1935 that a pit was created for the ''Municipale'' and, in the last years of the twentieth century, a complete restoration took place.  

The now-renamed ''Teatro Comunale'' (its original name had been restored in 1956) re-opened in December 1998 as a 900-seat auditorium with 112 boxes on four tiers plus a gallery.

Since its opening in 1841 the ''Comunale'' has presented all of the major works of the operatic repertory as well as many new and unfamiliar ones.  Today, its programming typically consists of about seven operas presented during the October to April season for two performances each and the theatre is a member of the Association of the Theatres of Emilia Romagna, thus working cooperatively with opera houses in the region on shared productions.

Following the September 2007 death of world famous opera tenor [[Luciano Pavarotti]], a native of the town and a lifelong resident, the Mayor of Modena has announced that the theatre was to be renamed for the singer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wtopnews.com/?nid=105&amp;sid=1240287  Ariel David, "World Mourns Italian Tenor Pavarotti", WTOPnews.com, 6 September 2007]: "Amid an outpouring of tributes....his northern Italian hometown of Modena, where he died at age 71 after a long battle with pancreatic cancer, said it would name the city's theater after its native son".&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Lost City of Z: A Tale of Deadly Obsession in the Amazon''''' is the debut non-fiction book by American author [[David Grann]]. The book was published in 2009, and recounts the activities of the British explorer [[Percy Fawcett]] who, in 1925, disappeared with his son in the Amazon while looking for an ancient lost city. For decades, explorers and scientists have tried to find evidence of his party, and of the "[[Lost City of Z]]".

Grann also recounts his own journey into the Amazon, by which he discovered new evidence about how Fawcett may have died. He learned that Fawcett may have come upon "Z" without knowing it.&lt;ref&gt;David Grann, ''Lost City of Z'', 2009, pp. 270–72&lt;/ref&gt; The book claims as many as 100 people may have died or disappeared (and are presumed dead) searching for Fawcett over the years; however, the more historically accurate toll was only one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/2017/04/the-lost-city-of-z-is-a-very-long-way-from-a-true-story-and-i-should-know/|title=The Lost City of Z is a very long way from a true story and I should know|last=Hemming|first=John|date=1 April 2017|website=The Spectator|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Lost City of Z'' was the basis of [[The Lost City of Z (film)|a 2016 feature film of the same name]], written and directed by [[James Gray (director)|James Gray]].

==Kuhikugu==
{{main|Kuhikugu}}
First in his 2005 article "The Lost City of Z" and later in the book he developed and published with the same title, David Grann reported on excavations by the archeologist [[Michael Heckenberger]] at a site in the Amazon Xingu region that might be the long-rumored lost city. The ruins were surrounded by several concentric, circular moats, with evidence of palisades that had been described in the folklore and oral history of nearby tribes. Heckenberger also found evidence of wooden structures and roads that cut through the jungle. [[Terra preta|Black Indian earth]] showed evidence that humans had added supplements to the soil to increase its fertility to support agriculture.

Perhaps most intriguing were the direct parallels between the site, referred to as [[Kuhikugu]], and tribes of the area. Pottery methods had remained nearly identical, and the tribes followed a diet that prohibited several sources of food—striking considering the long-held belief that such prohibitions would mean death in the harsh rainforest. Contemporary villages are laid out in patterns similar to those seen at three sites of the ancient cities.

Kuhikugu encompasses more than 20 settlements, each supporting as many as 5,000 people. Construction methods showed a sophisticated engineering. The structures were made of wood, supporting a society that flourished from approximately 200 A.D. until around 1600, according to carbon-dating data obtained from the moats and pottery. Their constructions included bridges across some of the great rivers of the Amazon. Their monuments extended horizontally, rather than being built as the pyramidal structures developed by the [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] or [[Inca Empire|Inca]] peoples.

The settlements and civilization of these people appeared to have lasted long enough for them to have had contact with Europeans. Many died due to new infectious diseases, which may have been carried by some of their usual indigenous trading partners, rather than directly by Europeans. The high rate of fatality of these epidemics disrupted the people and their society: in only a few years, they were so devastated by disease that they had virtually died out. The earliest [[Conquistador|conquistadors]] left records of their glimpses of this civilization, but by the time they tried to explore the rainforest again, the indigenous people were all but gone. The jungle was quickly reclaiming the land.&lt;ref&gt;Biello, David. (August 28, 2008). [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=lost-amazon-cities "Ancient Amazon Actually Highly Urbanized"], ''Scientific American.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''The Lost City of Z'' was reviewed by [[Rich Cohen]] in the Sunday ''[[New York Times Book Review]]'', who said it was "a powerful narrative, stiff lipped and Victorian at the center, trippy at the edges, as if one of those stern men of [[Joseph Conrad|Conrad]] had found himself trapped in a novel by [[Gabriel García Márquez|García Márquez]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Rich Cohen|Cohen, Rich]]. (February 26, 2009).[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/01/books/review/Cohen-t.html "On the Road to El Dorado."] ''The New York Times.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Critic [[Michiko Kakutani]] ranked it as one of the ten best books of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Kakutani, Michiko. (November 26, 2009). [https://www.nytimes.com/gift-guide/holiday-2009/giftguide-kakutani/list.html "Michiko Kakutani's Top 10 Books of 2009."] ''The New York Times.''&lt;/ref&gt; In her review, Kakutani wrote that it "is at once a biography, a detective story and a wonderfully vivid piece of travel writing that combines [[Bruce Chatwin]]esque powers of observation with a [[Evelyn Waugh|Waugh-like]] sense of the absurd. Mr. Grann treats us to a harrowing reconstruction of Fawcett’s forays into the Amazonian jungle, as well as an evocative rendering of the vanished age of exploration. . . . Suspenseful. . . Rollicking . . . Fascinating . . . It reads with all the pace and excitement of a movie thriller and all the verisimilitude and detail of firsthand reportage.”&lt;ref&gt;Kakutani, Michiko. (March 16, 2009). [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/17/books/17kaku.html "An Explorer Drawn to, and Eventually Swallowed by, the Amazon."] ''The New York Times.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Washington Post]]'' described it as "a thrill ride from start to finish."&lt;ref&gt;Arana, Marie. (March 6, 2009). [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/06/AR2009030602022.html "Lost in the Jungle."] ''Washington Post.''&lt;/ref&gt; The book appeared on several "best" and "notable books of the year" lists, including that of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', ''[[Washington Post]]'', ''[[Boston Globe]]'', ''Publisher's Weekly'', ''Sunday New York Times'', ''Christian Science Monitor'', ''Bloomberg'', the ''Providence Journal'', ''The Globe and Mail'', ''Evening Standard'', Amazon, and McClatchy Newspapers. [[Barnes &amp; Noble]] ranked ''The Lost City of Z'' as the single best nonfiction book of 2009.

At the same time, critics have pointed out inaccuracies and/or distortions by Grann. Writing for ''The Wall Street Journal'', [[Simon Winchester]] said the book was "captivating" but faulted Grann's credulity, especially when he imagined that he was seeing the ruins of "Z". Winchester writes, "Oh, please. It is all just too pat, too wanting in healthy skepticism."&lt;ref&gt;Winchester, Simon. (February 27, 2009). [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123569217402288043 "The Endless Allure of El Dorado."] ''Wall Street Journal.''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hugh Thomson (writer)|Hugh Thomson]] writes in ''The Washington Post'' that Grann's book is "a source of distortion, as it ignores or inflates much available material on Fawcett."&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, Hugh. "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2017/04/12/the-hero-of-the-lost-city-of-z-was-no-hero/ The hero of ‘The Lost City of Z’ was no hero]", ''[[Washington Post]],'' April 12, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Hemming (explorer)|John Hemming]] dismissed much of the book as hyperbolic in his review for ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'', concluding, "It is a pity that a writer as good as Grann chose to study this unimportant, disagreeable and ultimately pathetic man. It is an even greater pity that he decided to inflate and distort so much of this sad story." Hemming assails Grann for dabbling in the "green-hell" genre, where the jungle is depicted as offering some new lethal threat with each footstep. The review notes Grann's exaggerations of Fawcett's exploits. Hemming said that Grann's claim that Fawcett "helped redraw the map of South America" was a "staggering exaggeration", given the insignificance of his actual expeditions. He describes Grann as "totally wrong" about both Fawcett's beliefs about [[El Dorado]] and the current state of scholarship on the subject. Hemming said that "there is no excuse for [Grann's] fantasies" about the dangers of indigenous tribes and the depth of Fawcett's contact with them.&lt;ref&gt;Hemming, John. "Gung ho ho. 'Lost City of Z, The' by Grann, David (author)", ''The Times Literary Supplement''. June 05, 2009; pg. 7-8; Issue 5540.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
Galbraith regards the book as being needed due to media coverage of [[Tsutomu Miyazaki]] informing people about Japanese fandom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/new-titles/adult-announcements/article/29803-geek-speak-japanese-style--e2-80-98the-otaku-encyclopedia-e2-80-99-.html |title=Geek-Speak Japanese Style: ‘The Otaku Encyclopedia’|publisher=[[Publishers Weekly]]|date=2009-10-27 |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Scott Green regards ''The Otaku Encyclopedia'' as not being "disposable criticism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/42408 |title=AICN Anime - Gantz, Otaku Encyclopedia, New Imagi Astro Boy Footage, New Priest Casting, Battle Angel Sighting? Macross and More|publisher=[[Ain't It Cool News]]|date= |accessdate=2010-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mark Schilling, writing for ''[[The Japan Times]],'' regards the encyclopedia's goal as being to "supply facts about the objects of obsession, while opening windows into the mysterious culture that produced them.", saying that the book does not have enough "critical distance or analysis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fb20090726a1.html |title=The quirky terrain of an otaku mind |publisher=[[The Japan Times]]|date=2009-07-26 |accessdate=2010-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Ruh feels that although the book tries to be broad in its scope, it is written from a fan perspective and shows that Galbraith is primarily a "moe otaku".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ruh |first=Brian |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/brain-diving/otaku-where-art-thou/2010-12-14 |title=Otaku, Where Art Thou? - Brain Driving |work=Anime News Network |date=2010-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Vicar of Nibbleswicke''''' is a children's story written by [[Roald Dahl]] and illustrated by [[Quentin Blake]]. It was first published in London in 1991, after Dahl's death, by Century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/d/roald-dahl/vicar-of-nibbleswicke.htm|title=The Vicar of Nibbleswicke|work=fantasticfiction.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protagonist is a dyslexic [[vicar]], and the book was written to benefit the Dyslexia Institute in London (now Dyslexia Action), with Dahl and Blake donating their rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dyslexiaaction.org.uk/|title=Home - Dyslexia Action|work=dyslexiaaction.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==

The Reverend Robert Lee, the new vicar of Nibbleswicke, is suffering from a rare and acutely embarrassing condition: Back-to-Front Dyslexia, a fictional type of [[dyslexia]] that causes the sufferer to say the most important word (often being the verb) in a sentence backwards, creating comedic situations.  For example, instead of saying ''knits'', he will say ''stink''; ''god'' would be ''dog'' etc. It affects only his speech, and he doesn't realize he's doing it, but the [[parishioner]]s of Nibbleswicke are shocked and confused by his seemingly outrageous comments, especially the church's most generous benefactor, Miss Arabella Prewt, who does not take kindly to being called 'Miss Twerp'. However, thanks to the local doctor, a cure is found (walking backwards everywhere for the rest of his life), and the mild-mannered vicar can resume normal service.

The book contains a reference to Dahl's previous novel ''[[Esio Trot]]'', noting that its title is ''tortoise'' backwards.

'''Ward Memorial Hall''' is an 1880s [[theater]] building within the [[Northwestern Branch, National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers Historic District]], located in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]. It is part of the Milwaukee Soldiers Home complex, designated Building No. 41, on the present day Clement J. Zablocki VA Medical Center grounds.

The 900 seat [[theater]] was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1984, as part an effort to renovate and preserve it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://landmarkhunter.com/137442-ward-memorial-hall/|title=Ward Memorial Hall|publisher=Landmark Hunter.com|accessdate=2012-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Ward Memorial Hall was built in 1881-82 during a period of expansion for the [[Northwestern Branch, National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers Historic District|Northwestern Branch]] of the [[National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers]] facilities, originally the National Asylum for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers (1867−1873).  On its completion theatrical entertainment moved from the chapel in the 1869 Main Building.

[[File:General view of theater looking north toward the stage - National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers, Northwestern Branch, Ward Memorial Hall, 5000 West National Avenue, Milwaukee, HABS WI-360-B-15.tif|thumb|250px|Theater interior.]]
Prominent Milwaukee architect [[Henry C. Koch]] designed Ward Memorial Hall in the High Victorian [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] and [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque Revival style]]s, with a theater/meeting room, [[commissary]] store, restaurant, and railroad passenger station.&lt;ref name=habs&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/master/pnp/habshaer/wi/wi0600/wi0681/data/wi0681data.pdf LOC−HABS: History and description of Ward Memorial Hall]&lt;/ref&gt; This unusual combination of building uses was to serve the growing recreational needs of the Milwaukee Soldiers Home.&lt;ref name=habs/&gt; It has a wide veranda wrapping around three sides.

It is one of the oldest theaters in [[Wisconsin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soldiershome.org/theater|title=Our Buildings - Ward Memorial Hall|publisher=Soldiers Home.org|accessdate=2012-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Renaissance style" frescoes were designed by J. H. Harding and created under his supervision on the theater's ceiling.&lt;ref name=habs/&gt; They was covered over by a barrel vaulted ceiling when the theater was expanded, but still remain.  In 1888 a large [[stained glass window]] depicting General [[U. S. Grant]] depicted astride his horse was donated by the [[Grand Army of the Republic]], installed on second floor of the east façade, reconfiguring two preexisting windows.&lt;ref name=habs/&gt;

Gradually functions such as the train depot, post office, and store were moved to different structures and the theater facilities were expanded. In 1898 the theater space was entirely reconfigured to have a sloped floor, balcony, and boxes flanking the proscenium stage, and more fire exits.&lt;ref name=habs/&gt;

It was the Milwaukee Soldiers Home's venue for professional entertainments, including lectures, concerts, minstrel and theater companies, and regional [[vaudeville]] circuit productions. It has featured performers such as [[Will Rogers]], [[Sophie Tucker]], [[Ethel Merman]], [[Nat King Cole]], [[Liberace]], [[George Jessel (actor)|George Jessel]],  [[Bob Hope]], and [[Burns and Allen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMAAWP_Ward_Memorial_Hall_Milwaukee_WI|title=Ward Memorial Hall - Milwaukee, WI|publisher=Waymarking.com|accessdate=2012-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; After World War II, the theater gradually fell into disuse by resident veterans.&lt;ref name=habs/&gt;

==Conservation==
From 1981 through 1992 the Milwaukee Players, a local theater company, used the theater for rehearsals and offices.&lt;ref name=habs/&gt; A movement led by the Soldiers Home Foundation, Inc., the [[American Legion]], and other groups began to raise funds to renovate the theater in the early 1980s. Milwaukee native and famous performer [[Liberace|Wladziu "Walter" Liberace]] (1919-1987) offered limited help. When young in the 1920s he had performed at the theater, when visiting veterans with his mother.&lt;ref name=habs/&gt;

Ambitious fundraising efforts by the Soldiers Home Foundation floundered and currently Ward Memorial Hall sits vacant. The building is deteriorating, mainly due to water infiltration and lack of climate control.&lt;ref name=habs/&gt;

The Milwaukee Soldiers Home's vacant buildings, including Ward Memorial Hall, are on the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] List of 11 Most Endangered Historic Places.&lt;ref name=nthphd&gt;[http://www.preservationnation.org/issues/11-most-endangered/locations/national-soldiers-home.html  National Trust for Historic Preservation: National Soldiers Home Historic District], NTHP List of 11 Most Endangered Historic Places . accessed 12.1.2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2501">'''Zvi Raphaeli''' (b. Egypt 1924, d. 2005) was an Israeli impressionist painter. A rabbi by profession, he merged religion and art deftly in his paintings. He was educated in France from the age of three, and studied art at the [[École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts]] in Paris, and also at the [[Bezalel Academy of Art and Design]] in Jerusalem, Israel. He initially studied engineering but after losing many close relatives including his father and brother in World War II, Raphaeli decided to study to be an artist. He was a member of the [[French Resistance]] during World War II, and lived in Israel where he moved to, in 1945 at the age of 21. Later on in his life, he also lived in the United States.

== Art ==
He is known for his works of art in varied media, including oil and watercolor, depicting street scenes in Israel, scenes from Jewish life and festivities, and occasionally floral still subjects. Style: His primary medium of painting was oil on canvas, with a prominent [[impasto]] technique, that brings depth to the subject. In the 70's, Raphaeli made his stamp as an art critic as well, providing his critique to various other Israeli artists like Moshe Givati at the nationwide 'Summer ‘70 Exhibition' held at the Goldman Gallery, [[Haifa]]. Austrian born Israeli Art critic Theodore F. Meisels once wrote in the [[Jerusalem Post]]: "Still, one should watch out; Should Raphaely, who behind his beard is far younger than he looks, ever attempt to harmonize his two worlds, then this genuine painting 'Chassid' could develop into an Israeli Chagall....."

Raphaeli has also authored and illustrated the [[Haggadah]] (a Jewish text for "telling" from father to son, the story of deliverance of Jews from Egypt), in his version THE PESSACH HAGGADAH [Hardcover-1975, Miller Publication, 1975]
