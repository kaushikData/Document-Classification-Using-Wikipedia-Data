The '''1929 Barcelona International Exposition''' (also '''1929 Barcelona Universal Exposition''', or '''Expo 1929''', in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]: ''Exposició Internacional de Barcelona de 1929'') was the second [[World's fair|World Fair]] to be held in [[Barcelona]], the first one being in [[1888 Barcelona Universal Exposition|1888]]. It took place from 20 May 1929 to 15 January 1930 in [[Barcelona]], Catalonia, Spain.&lt;ref name="Facts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bie-paris.org/main/pages/files/expos/1929-bis.pdf |title=Barcelone 1929 |accessdate=27 September 2009 |language=French |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kAsB87k8?url=http://www.bie-paris.org/main/pages/files/expos/1929-bis.pdf |archivedate=30 September 2009 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was held on [[Montjuïc]], the hill overlooking the harbor, southwest of the city center, and covered an area of 118 hectares (291.58 acres) at an estimated cost of 130 million [[Spanish peseta|pesetas]] ($25,083,921 in United States dollars).&lt;ref name="Facts"/&gt; Twenty European nations participated in the fair, including Germany, Britain, Belgium, Denmark, France, Hungary, Italy, Norway, Romania and Switzerland. In addition, private organizations from the United States and Japan participated.&lt;ref name="Facts"/&gt; Latin American countries as well as the United States were represented in the ''[[Ibero-American Exposition of 1929|Ibero-Americana section]]'' in [[Sevilla]].

The previous [[1888 Barcelona Universal Exposition]] had led to a great advance in the city's economic, architectural and technological growth and development, including the reconstruction of the [[Parc de la Ciutadella]], the city's main public park. A new exposition was proposed to highlight the city's further technological progress and increase awareness abroad of modern Catalan industry. This new exhibition required the urban planning of Montjuïc and its adjacent areas and the renovation of public spaces, principally [[Plaça d'Espanya, Barcelona|Plaça d'Espanya]].

The exposition called for a great deal of urban development within the city,&lt;ref name="Buildings"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liceus.com/cgi-bin/tcua/0900.asp |title=La Exposición Internacional de Barcelona de 1929 |author=Francesc-Xavier Mingorance i Ricart |accessdate=27 September 2009 |language=Spanish |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kAsBWrg2?url=http://www.liceus.com/cgi-bin/tcua/0900.asp |archivedate=30 September 2009 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and became a testing-ground for the new architectural styles developed in the early 20th century. At a local level, this meant the consolidation of ''[[Noucentisme]]'', a classical style that replaced the ''[[Modernisme]]'' (in the same vein as [[Glasgow Style]] / [[Art Nouveau]] / [[Jugendstil]], etc.) predominating in [[Catalonia]] at the turn of the 20th century. Furthermore, it marked the arrival in Spain of international ''[[avant-garde]]'' tendencies, especially [[Rationalism (architecture)|rationalism]], as seen in the design of the Barcelona Pavilion, created by German [[Bauhaus]] architect [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]].&lt;ref name="Buildings"/&gt; The Exposition also allowed for the erection of several emblematic buildings and structures, including the [[Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya|Palau Nacional de Catalunya]],&lt;ref name="Buildings"/&gt; the [[Magic Fountain of Montjuïc|Font màgica de Montjuïc]],&lt;ref name="Buildings"/&gt; the [[Teatre Grec]],&lt;ref name="Buildings"/&gt; [[Poble Espanyol]], and the [[Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys]].&lt;ref name="Buildings"/&gt;

==Origin of the Exposition==
The idea of a new exhibition began to take shape in 1905, promoted by the architect [[Josep Puig i Cadafalch]], as a way of bringing out the new Plan of links designed by [[Léon Jaussely]]. It was initially proposed that the Exposition should be constructed in the area of the [[Besòs River]], but instead, in 1913, planners selected Montjuïc as the site. While originally planned for 1917, the exposition was delayed due to World War I.

Puig i Cadafalch's project was supported by the Fomento del Trabajo Nacional, especially Francesc d'Assis, one of its leaders, who took charge of negotiations with the various agencies involved in the project. Thus, in 1913 the organization created a joint committee for organizing the event, consisting of representatives of the National Labor Development and the City Council, be appointed commissioners of the organization Josep Puig i Cadafalch, Francesc Cambo and Joan Pitch i Pon.

In 1915, the committee presented a first draft by Puig i Cadafalch, which was divided into three specific projects, each commissioned to a team of architects. Puig i Cadafalch and Guillem Busquets reserved the area at the base of the mountain, Lluis Domenech i Montaner and Manuel Vega i March planned the area atop the mountain—designated the International Section, and Enric Sagnier and August Font i Carreras Miramar developed a Maritime Section.

[[File:Spain-Cinderella Stamp-1929 Barcelona Expo.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Promotional "[[Cinderella stamp]]" for the Barcelona International Exposition, 1929]]
The principal difficulty of the project was the amount of land required. The exposition would need at least 110 hectares, and the Barcelona City Council had only 26 by 1914. Thus, using an 1879 law, they resorted to land-expropriation. In 1917, development work began at Montjuïc, with assistant engineer Marià Rubio i Bellver. Landscaping was done by Jean-Claude Nicolas Forestier, who was assisted by Maria Rubio i Tudurí Nicolau. Their design was distinctly Mediterranean, with classical influences, combining the gardens with the construction of pergolas and terraces. Likewise, a [[funicular]] was built to allow access to the top of the mountain, as well as an [[aerial tramway|aerial tram]], which connected the mountain with the Port of Barcelona. However, the aerial tram did not open until 1931, after the fair was closed.

Construction, while somewhat delayed, was completed in 1923, but the introduction that year of the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera delayed the actual exposition, which finally occurred in 1929, coinciding with the Ibero-American Exhibition in Seville. Also, the delay made obsolete the goal of promoting electrical industry, so that in 1925 the event was renamed the International Exhibition in Barcelona. The change of objective led to the reorganization of the exhibition, so that it was devoted to three aspects: industry, the sports, and art. In this new period, the organization fell into the hands of Pere Domènech i Roura, the Marquis de Foronda, and Director of Works.

Further development of the event allowed for a great stylistic diversity in the buildings of various architects, some loyal to the ''Noucentisme'' prevailing at the time, others reflecting recurring historicist and eclectic trends that persisted since the late 19th century, with particular influence from the Spanish [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]], in particular the architecture of [[Santiago de Compostela]], in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]. Despite this diversity, most buildings—at least the official ones—had a common theme of monumentality and grandiosity. In contrast, buildings in the International Section, home to pavilions representing other countries and institutions, had a more contemporary aspect, parallel to the current state of the art of the period. This particularly included [[Art Deco]] and [[modernist architecture|rationalism]].

The exposition was opened by [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|King Alfonso XIII]] on 19 May 1929. Led by Mayor Darius Rumeu y Freixa, baron de Viver, and Manuel de Álvarez-Cuevas y Olivella, President of the Organizing Committee. It was attended by some 200,000 people in the general public and by many Catalan political, economic, and cultural figures, including the Prime Minister (and dictator) [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]].

In terms of cost, the exhibition lost money, with a deficit of 180 million pesetas. Its success was relative; during the event the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|stock market crashed]] in New York, on 29 October 1929, which reduced the number of participants in the event. At the social level, it was great success as it allowed for a large influx of people and achievements for the city of Barcelona, especially in the fields of architecture and urbanism.

{{wide image|BarcelonaExpositionPanorama.1929.ws.jpg|1000px|The Avenue of the Americas from ''Plaça d'Espanya''}}

==Exposition Center==
The Exposition Center, ''el recinte de l'Exposició'', was built to designs by Puig i Cadafalch with two different types of buildings: palaces, the sections devoted to the official competition; and flags, representing countries, institutions and companies. The exposition's main axis began at the ''Plaça d'Espanya'', where four large hotels were built, through the Avenue of Americas (now the ''[[Avinguda de la Reina Maria Cristina]]''), which housed the grand buildings of the Exposition, to the foot of the mountain, the site of the "Magic Fountain", the Palaces Alfonso XIII and Victoria Eugenia, and a monumental staircase.

The Avenue of the Americas was decorated with numerous fountains, as well as glass columns—illuminated by electricity—designed by Charles Buïgas, which caused a great sensation. On both sides of the avenue were the main buildings of the Exposition: Palace of Costumes; the Palace of Communications and Transport; and the Palace of Metallurgy, Electricity and Locomotion. Today, these buildings are used as exposition spaces in the Barcelona Trade Fair. Along the avenue was Mechanics Square (now the ''Plaça de l'Univers''), at the center of which stood the "Tower of Light", and the sculpture ''El Treball'', by Josep Llimona.

=== Plaça d'Espanya ===
The  Plaça d'Espanya was included in [[Ildefons Cerdà]]'s plan for the expansion of Barcelona, the [[Eixample]]. It was to be a major point of communication in the route between Barcelona and the towns of [[Baix Llobregat]]. After a first draft by the urbanized square Josep Amargós in 1915, the square was finally built to plans by Josep Puig i Cadafalch and Guillem Busquets, and then finished by Antoni Darder i Marsa. It was fully complete by 1926. They designed the square as a monumental [[Rotary (intersection)|rotary]], to be surrounded by a Baroque [[colonnade]]. The design was influenced by [[Bernini]]'s [[St. Peter's Square]] in Rome. Dividing the square from the Avenue of the Americas Ramon Reventós designed two bell{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}-towers, known as the [[Venetian Towers]], which were heavily influenced by [[St. Mark's Campanile]] in Venice.

At the center of the square another monumental fountain was built, designed by Josep Maria Jujol. Its ornate decoration is an allegory of Spain, surrounded by water. Three niches with sculptures symbolize the three principal rivers of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], the [[Ebro River|Ebro]], [[Guadalquivir River|Guadalquivir]], and [[Tagus River|Tagus]]. Around the central sculpture, three decorated columns symbolize Religion (a cross with [[Ramon Llull]], [[Teresa of Ávila|Saint Teresa of Jesus]], and [[Ignatius of Loyola|Saint Ignatius of Loyola]]), Heroism (a sword with [[Pelagius of Asturias]], [[James I of Aragon|James I]] and Isabella), and Arts ( a book with [[Ausias March]] and [[Miguel de Cervantes]]).

=== The Magic Fountain ===
[[File:Fuente Mágica Buïgas.JPG|thumb|The Magic Fountain in 2014]]
The famous [[Magic Fountain of Montjuïc]], designed by Carles Buïgas, was constructed in 1929 on Avinguda Maria Cristina at the foot of [[Montjuic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.secrethotels.eu/visiting-barcelona-on-a-budget/ |title= Visiting Barcelona on a Budget |publisher=secrethotels.eu |date=|accessdate=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and amazed the public with its light and water displays. Today, it is still an emblem of the Catalan capital, and musical lightshows are often performed there during the annual festival of [[La Mercè]], as well as during every weekend. It enchants the public with a backdrop of the [[Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya]]. Originally, [[The Four Columns|four columns]] were built in this location by Puig i Cadafalch to represent the [[Senyera|Catalan flag]], but these were removed by Spanish dictator Primo de Rivera's orders.

=== Official Sections ===
* The '''Communications and Transport Centre''': Designed by Félix de Azúa and Adolf Florensa in 1926, it was built in a neoclassical style inspired by the architecture of the French academy. It was one of the largest buildings of the Exposition, with an area of 16,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. With entrances onto the Plaza de España and Avenida de la Reina María Cristina, its structure is organised around a floor projecting out onto Plaza de España and supported by columnds. The Avenida's façade is in the form of a [[triumphal arch]], finished off with a group of sculptures including the figure of a '’Victoria'’. It is currently part of the Barcelona Trade Fair.&lt;ref&gt;M. Carmen Grandas, ''L'Exposició Internacional de Barcelona de 1929'', pp. 110–112.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''Clothing Centre''' (or Labour Centre): initially named the Centre of Pedagogy, Hygiene and Social Institutions, it was designed by Josep Maria Jujol and Andrés Calzada, and is located between the Plaza de España and the Avenida de la Reina María Cristina. With an area of 6,500 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, like the Communications and Transport Centre its structure had to be adapted to an elevated room supported on columns over the Plaza de España, with an irregularly shaped floor arrayed around a central space, with a large rotunda topped by an eastern-style [[dome]]. This building is also part of the Barcelona Trade Fair.
* The '''Centre for Metallurgy, Electricity and Motive Force''': the work of Amadeu Llopart and Alexandre Soler i March, this building has an area of 16,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. From its rectangular plan, a large [[polyhedron|polyhedral]] dome rises from its centre, with a [[Lantern (architecture)|lantern]] but no [[tholobate|drum]], possibly inspired by [[Bruno Taut]]'s glass pavilion, built for the [[Deutscher Werkbund]] in [[Cologne]]. The façade is notable for its large classical [[pediment]], decorated by Francesc d'Assís Galí's [[frescoes]] (he also painted the entrance hall's [[soffits]], together with [[Josep Obiols]] and [[Manuel Humbert]]). To either side of the building are large towers with allegorical sculptures by [[Enric Casanovas]]. This building is also part of the Barcelona Trade Fair.&lt;ref&gt;M. Carmen Grandas, ''L'Exposició Internacional de Barcelona de 1929'', pp. 120–122.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''Centre for Textile Arts''': designed by Joan Roig and Emili Canosa, this was situated between the Communications and Transport Centre and the Projection Centre, with its entrance on the Plaza del Universo. With an area of 20,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, it was dedicated to the [[textile industry]], with booths for Spanish, German, Austrian, French, Italian and Swiss companies. The central body of the building is in [[renaissance]] style, while the taller façade was neoclassical, with a balustrade [[castellated]] in the [[Plateresque]] style and two domed towers. Its interior housed an exhibition on silk, promoted by Germany and designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and interior designer Lilly Reich, the first example of the German architect's creative genius. He conceived a well-lit, open space, [[De Stijl|neoplasticist]] in structure, where a skilled use of space achieved a feeling of open space throughout the room. The 50th Anniversary Centre, belonging to the Barcelona Trade Fair, was built in its place.&lt;ref&gt;M. Carmen Grandas, ''L'Exposició Internacional de Barcelona de 1929'', pp. 112–115.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''Projection Centre''': designed by Eusebi Bona and Francisco Aznar, this building is situated between the Avenida de la Reina María Cristina, the Avenida Rius i Taulet and the Plaza del Universo. With an area of 10.000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, it had two floors, the first with a large showroom, with a stage and projection room, and various exhibition rooms. The building's façade is notable, in the classical, monumental style, decorated with sculptures by Joan Pueyo: four groups of [[caryatid]]s with bisons, four groups of [[sphinxes]] and two fountains, carved in artificial stone. Removed after the Exposition, the current Convention Centre was built in its place. Next to this building were the Exposition's offices, now a college (CEIP Jacint Verdaguer), designed by Juan Bruguera.
* The '''Alfonso XIII and Victoria Eugenia Centres''': originally named the Centres for Modern Art and Architecture, they were designed by Josep Puig i Cadafalch y Guillem Busquets, symmetrically located next to the Magic Fountain, at the foot of the [[Palau Nacional]]. These were the first buildings to be constructed, completed in 1923, when they housed the a Furniture and Interior Decoration Exposition as a trial run for the later event. Each had a surface area of 14,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, rectangular floors formed by quadrangular modules, and a set of four towers for each building, topped by pinnacles in the shape of [[pyramids]] and decorated with [[sgraffito]], representing [[Solomonic columns]] and plant motifs. The Alfonso XIII Centre was dedicated to Construction, while the Victoria Eugenia housed the representatives of countries without their own pavilions. It is currently part of the Barcelona Trade Fair.&lt;ref&gt;M. Carmen Grandas, ''L'Exposició Internacional de Barcelona de 1929'', pp. 132–135.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''[[Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya|Palau Nacional]]''': the main building of the Exposition, this was designed by Eugenio Cendoya and [[Enric Catà]], under the supervision of Pere Domènech i Roura, after Puig i Cadafalch and Guillem Busquets' initial plan was rejected. Built between 1926 and 1929, it has an area of 32,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Its classical style was inspired by the [[Spanish Renaissance]], and its floors are rectangular with two lateral sections and a square section behind, with a large elliptical dome in the central part. The cascades and jets of the Palace's staircase were also designed by Carles Buïgas, and nine large projectors were placed which to this day still send out intense beams of light which write the city's name in the sky.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} The inauguration ceremony was held in its Oval Hall, presided over by [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|Alfonso XIII]] and Queen [[Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg|Victoria Eugenia]]. The Palau Nacional was dedicated to an exhibition of [[Spanish art]] with more than 5,000 works from throughout Spanish territory. Various artists were involved in its decoration—in Novecento style, in contrast to the classical architecture—such as the sculptors [[Enric Casanovas]], [[Josep Dunyach]], [[Frederic Marès]] and [[Josep Llimona]], and painters [[Francesc d'Assís Galí]], [[Josep de Togores]], [[Manuel Humbert]], [[Josep Obiols]], [[Joan Colom i Agustí|Joan Colom]] and [[Francesc Labarta]]. As of 1934, it has housed the [[Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Carmen Grandas, ''L'Exposició Internacional de Barcelona de 1929'', pp. 135–143.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''City of Barcelona Pavilion''': a work designed by architect Josep Goday in the noucentist style. It hosted an exhibition about past, present and future of the host city. Located between the Plaza de los Bellos Oficios (today Plaça de Carles Buïgas), the Avenida de la Técnica (currently Carrer de la Guàrdia Urbana), the Avenida Rius i Taulet and the Alfonso XIII Centre, it covered an area of 2,115 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. It is a brick and Montjuic stone building. Its façade is decorated with several sculptures, allegories of Barcelona and its history, carved by sculptors Frederic Marès, Eusebi Arnau and Pere Jou. It is currently the [[Guàrdia Urbana de Barcelona]] headquarters.
* The '''Press Centre''': dedicated to the magazines and daily papers printed in Barcelona at that time, this building was designed by Pere Domènech i Roura. Located on Avenida Rius i Taulet, it currently houses the Guardia Urbana de Barcelona. With an area of 600 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, it has a basement and three floors, with several styles mixed in a historistic concept: [[neo-Mudéjar]], [[neo-Romanesque]], [[neo-Gothic]], etc. Domènech used various modernist elements, such as facebrick, iron and ceramics, being influenced by his father, Lluís Domènech i Montaner.
* The '''Centre for Decorative and Applied Arts''': located between calle Lérida and the Avenida de la Técnica, this building was designed by Manuel Casas and Manuel Puig and had an area of 12,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The building was organised around a central patio, covered by a rectangular glass structure; the rest of the building was in a French baroque style, with a monumental appearance. The façade displayed a set of receding and protruding shapes, from which two large towers topped with domes and lanterns stood out. In 1955, the [[Palau dels Esports de Barcelona]] (now the Barcelona Teatre Musical) was built in its place.
* The '''Graphical Arts Centre''': located on the Paseo de Santa Madrona, this was designed by [[Raimon Duran i Reynals]] and [[Pelai Martínez]], in a Noucentist style influenced by the [[Italian Renaissance]], particularly [[Filippo Brunelleschi]], [[Donato Bramante]] and [[Andrea Palladio]]. With an area of 4,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, it was dedicated to the graphical arts, particularly book printing. Entrance was via a staircase and two lateral ramps for vehicles, with a façade formed by arcaded galleries, with pavilions to the sides and a central drum over which a dome is elevated. Once again, the German exhibition designed by Mies van der Rohe and Lilly Reich stood out, composed of glass cabinets in geometric shapes. Since 1935 it has housed the Archeological Museum of Catalonia.&lt;ref&gt;M. Carmen Grandas, ''L'Exposició Internacional de Barcelona de 1929'', pp. 149–152.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''Centre of Agriculture''': designed by Josep Maria Ribas i Casas and Manuel Maria Mayol, it is located between Paseo de Santa Madrona and calle Lérida. With an area of 16,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, it is arranged around a central patio, with five rectangular naves and two arcaded galleries. Influenced by the Italian Renaissance—particularly by [[Lombardy]]—the façades of the various façades are covered by [[stucco]] and ceramincs, with several octagonal towers and triple arches. It is now known as the "Mercat de les Flors" (''Market of the Flowers'') and is occupied by the Theatre City, which includes the Theatre Institute, the [[Teatre Lliure]] Foundation, the Mercat de les Flors Municipal Theatre and the Fabià Puigserver Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;M. Carmen Grandas, ''L'Exposició Internacional de Barcelona de 1929'', pp. 154–155.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''Spanish Pavilion''': designed by Antoni Darder, with an area of 4,500 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, was designed for representatives from the Government and ministries. It consists of a central body and two symmetrical wings, with towers at each end. It was inspired by the Plateresque style, with semicircular arches and Corinthian columns. It was demolished after the Exposition.
* The '''Delegation Centre''': designed by Enric Sagnier i Villavecchia, it is located between the Avenida del Marqués de Comillas and the Avenida de Montanyans, opposite the Plaza de la Hidráulica (now the Plaza de Sant Jordi; the fountain of [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] and an equestrian statue of [[Saint George]] by Josep Llimona were located here). With an area of 2,350 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, it was dedicated to the representatives of provincial Spanish delegations. Designed in a Gothic-Plateresque style, the main façade was [[wikt:Special:Search/concave|concave]], with a central tower and two symmetrical wings with crenellated arches and towers at their extremes. The Royal shield and the shields of Catalonia, [[León, Spain|León]] and Barcelona were displayed on the façade.
* The '''Chemistry Centre''': designed by Antoni Sardà, this building was designed to display sports-related material, but at the last moment its function was changed in order to dedicated it to the [[chemical industry]]. With an area of 4,500 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, it was located in the Avenida de Montanyans, next to the Delegation Centre. Classically styled, the main façade was divided into three sections, the central section having a colonnaded entrance and a ribbed dome over a decagonal drum. From 1932 to 1962, when it was destroyed in a fire, it was the seat of Orphea Cinematographic Studios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bcn.es/publicacions/b_mm/ebmm61/bmm61_qc71.htm|title= Cronología de Montjuïc|accessdate= 25 October 2008 |author= Josep Maria Huertas }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''Royal Pavilion''': now known as Albéniz Palace, it housed the representatives of the Spanish Royal House. Located close to the Stadium, surrounded by spacious gardens, it was designed by Juan Moya in a baroque style inspired by the 18th-century French courts. The interior decoration is in the [[Empire style]], most notably the [[tapestries]] designed by [[Francisco Goya]] and a room of mirrors copied from [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]]. Extended in 1970 and decorated by [[Salvador Dalí]] paintings, it is currently used in certain ceremonies and public acts.
* The '''Centre for Modern Art''': designed by Antoni Darder in 1927, it had an area of 5,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and is located between the Royal Pavilion and the Centre of Missions. It formed part of the "Art in Spain" section, containing collections of paintings, sculpture, drawings and engravings from the 19th century. Rectangular in plan, its main façade had a central body and two symmetrical wings, with a central structure in the form of semicircular arches resembling the work of the Italian architect Filippo Juvara.
* The '''Centre of Missions''': designed by Antoni Darder, it had area of 5,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, dedicated to displaying the work of [[Mission (Christianity)|missionary]] institutions. The main façade was inspired by Romanesque churches, with semicircular arches built with semicircular arches with [[voussoir]]s, long, narrow windows and pentagonal tops. The building was rectangular in plan, with an octagonal dome inspired by the Italian Renaissance.
* The '''Southern Palace''': designed by Antoni Millàs, it was located in the Avenida Internacional (now the Avenida del Estadio). With an area of 26,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, it was rectangular in plan, with three naves covered by square modules with skylight-style openings. It was located in a place initially planned to hold an aviation field, which was never built.

As the [[Ibero-American Exposition of 1929]] was taking place simultaneously in Seville, no [[Hispanic America|Spanish American]] countries participated. From the remaining countries, the official participants were Austria, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Norway, Romania, Sweden, Switzerland and the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] (later [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]); most of these countries had their own pavilions, except for Austria, Czechoslovakia, Finland and Switzerland. Apart from these countries, Japan, the Netherlands, Portugal, the United Kingdom and the United States participated in an unofficial capacity. Each country had a week dedicated to it throughout the course of the event, with a highlight of the German week being the flight of the [[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin|Graf Zeppelin]] [[airship]] over Barcelona, on 16 May 1929.

[[File:Pabellón Alemania.jpg|thumb|250px|German pavilion.]]

* '''[[Barcelona Pavilion|German Pavilion]]''': this is considered to be one of its architect's master works, [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]]. It is one of the best examples of the [[International style (architecture)|international style]] of architecture due to its purity of form, its spatial concept and its intelligent use of structures and materials, which turned this pavilion into the quintessential piece of 20th-century architecture. In 1928 Mies was contracted to build the official German pavilion together with the Electricity Supply pavilion and several exhibits in the Official Section's buildings, with the collaboration of interior designer Lilly Reich. Rectangular in shape, it is elevated on a [[travertine]]-covered podium; the covering was supported on cross-shaped columns and load-bearing walls, with side walls of different materials ([[plaster]]-covered bricks, steel covered by green [[marble]] and Moroccan [[onyx]]). Its decoration was reduced to two ponds and a sculpture, ''La Mañana'', by [[Georg Kolbe]]. Demolished after the Exhibition, it was reconstructed between 1985 and 1987 in its original location by Cristian Cirici, Ignasi de Solà-Morales and Fernando Ramos, following Mies van der Rohe's plans.&lt;ref&gt;M. Carmen Grandas, ''L'Exposició Internacional de Barcelona de 1929'', pp. 125–131.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Belgian Pavilion''': designed by the architect Verhelle,&lt;ref&gt;The bibliography consulted does not state the first name of this architect, but it could well be Arthur Verhelle, who also created the Belgian Pavilion of the 1922 Exhibition in Rio de Janeiro. {{cite web|url= http://www.irismonument.be/fr.Saint-Gilles.Rue_Blanche.33.html|title=Rue Blanche 33|accessdate=7 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; this was next to the Spanish Pavilion. Rectangular in shape, it was inspired by the ''Hof von Busleyden'' in [[Mechelen]], built when [[Margaret of Austria, Duchess of Savoy|Margaret of Austria]] established the court there,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.es/preview/1970/07/17/pagina-5/33230854/pdf.html?search=pabell%C3%B3n%20de%20b%C3%A9lgica|title=Pabellones extranjeros en la Exposición|author=Buenaventura Bassegoda|accessdate= 7 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; notable for a [[watchtower]] twice the height of the building.
* '''Danish Pavilion''': designed by Tyge Hvass, this was a [[dihedral angle|dihedron]] of reddish wood with a gabled roof, evoking a typical Danish mountain house. The façade showed an embossed Danish flag, anchor, wheat sheaf and cog wheel, typical elements of the Danish economy.
* '''French Pavilion''': designed by [[Georges Wybo]], in a classical style with art deco elements, this was located next to the Alfonso XIII centre. It was a single-volume building in the shape of a [[cube]], with its roof formed by superimposed stepped rectangular sections, like a [[ziggurat]], with a sculpture at the front in the shape of a woman and the initials R. F. (''République Française'').
* '''Hungarian Pavilion''': designed by Dénes György and Nikolaus Menyhért, this was made up of two rectangular sections, with a tower over it in the shape of a [[Prism (geometry)|prism]]. An example of [[expressionism|expressionist]] architecture, the geometrical synthesis of its structure evoked the architecture of the [[Pre-Columbian era]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Carmen Grandas, ''L'Exposició Internacional de Barcelona de 1929'', p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Italian Pavilion''': designed by Piero Portaluppi, this was located between the Spanish and Swedish pavilions. It had a surface area of 4,500 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, in the shape of a U, a renaissance classical style and a monumental atmosphere. The façade had some columns with the [[Aquila (Roman)|eagle of the Roman Empire]], a [[frieze]] with the country's name and a fronton finished off with a statue of [[Minerva]].
* '''Norwegian Pavilion''': designed by Ole Lind Schistad, this was wooden like the Danish pavilion, with a similar likeness to mountain buildings, with shuttered windows and a sloped roof.
* '''Serbian, Croatian and Slovene Pavilion''': representing the country which would later be known as Yugoslavia, this was designed by the architect [[Dragiša Brašovan]] and located next to the Palau Nacional. Avant-garde in conception, it was a [[star]]-shaped building with the façade made from wooden strips arranged in horizontal black and white stripes.
* '''Romanian Pavilion''': designed by [[Duiliu Marcu]], this was a rectangular building with a tower to one side and a gabled roof, panelled with wood and stucco. The façade had a series of arches ending in a [[pergola]], with architectural elements characteristic of [[Transylvania]].
* '''Swedish Pavilion''': designed by Peder Clason, as with the other [[Scandinavia]]n buildings it was built of wood, rectangular and with a geometric structure within the avant-garde currents of the time, such as neoplasticism. Next to the entrance door was a [[Cone (geometry)|conical]] wooden tower, topped with three superimposed horizontal discs; it was named "Funkis", Swedish abbreviation for functionalism at the beginning of the 20th century. Both the building and the tower were dismantled after the Exhibition and reconstructed in [[Berga]], where the pavilion served as a school up until the [[Spanish Civil War]] when the building was demolished at the beginning of the 1960s. There is currently a project to rebuild the tower next to the Olympic Museum, near its original location.

=== Private pavilions ===
[[File:Pabellón Caixa.jpg|thumb|250px|Pavilion of the [[La Caixa|Barcelona Bank Savings and Pensions]].]]
[[File:Expo1929 PavelloTabacFilipines.jpg|thumb|250px|Pavilion of the [[Compañía General de Tabacos de Filipinas]].]]
* '''Pavilion of the [[La Caixa|Barcelona Bank Savings and Pensions]]''': located on Paseo de Santa Madrona, this was designed by Josep Maria Ribas i Casas and Manuel Maria Mayol. Eclectic in style, it presents structural solutions based on various different styles: the central section was inspired by Spanish palacial architecture of the 18th century, while the lateral parts are based on civil architecture of northern Italy and the [[loggia]]s are reminiscent of 19th century tastes in Mediterranean villas. Because of its raised location, terraces with illuminated fountains were located at its entrance. Since 1982 it has been the headquarters of the Cartographic Institute of Catalonia.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}
* '''Pavilion of the [[Compañía General de Tabacos de Filipinas]]''': located on Paseo de Santa Madrona, it was designed by Antoni Darder and constructed in 1928. The building is U-shaped, surrounded by gardens, and has a tower to one side and an octagonal dome over its central section. Darder followed the "art deco" style which was popular in the 1920s, with an intelligent distribution of internal space and a playful use of exterior volume. In 1932 it became the Forestier Municipal Kindergarten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bcn.es/publicacions/b_mm/ebmm61/bmm61_qc71.htm|title= Cronología de Montjuïc|accessdate= 25 October 2008 |author= Josep Maria Huertas}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''German Electricity Supply Pavilion (Electric Supplies Co.)''': designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Lilly Reich, it was located in Plaza de la Luz, between the Communications and Transport Centre and the Centre for Textile Arts. The company Electric Supplies Co. was in charge of supplying electricity for the entire Exhibition grounds. A rectangular single-volume building, similar to an industrial ship, it went almost unnoticed during the event, being one of Mies' least well-regarded works and one of the last in which he used brick walls, passing on to using glass from then on.&lt;ref&gt;M. Carmen Grandas, ''L'Exposició Internacional de Barcelona de 1929'', pp. 115–116.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Can Jorba''': the commercial company Jorba was presented in Can ("house of" in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]) Jorba, a small structure in the shape of the [[Eiffel Tower]] with the initials of the sponsoring brand built in: the J at the top and the A at the base of the tower.
* '''Pavilion of the Hydrographic Confederation of Ebro''': designed by Regino Borobio, this was one of the few Spanish buildings in an avant-garde style, being a building in the shape of a horizontal box with a tall signal tower.&lt;ref&gt;Ángel Urrutia, ''Arquitectura española del siglo XX'', p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Pavilion of the [[Hispano-Suiza]] Company''': designed by Eusebi Bona, it was located in the viewpoint opposite the Palau Nacional.
* '''Artists' Gathering Pavilion''': designed by Jaume Mestres i Fossas, its objective was to present the works of various Catalan artists who were not represented in the official section, for which reason it coexisted in private form. The building, in an art deco style, was octagonal with a stepped dome, while the interior distribution of space and decoration were rationalist in style, one of the few national examples of avant-garde type. Participating artists included [[Pablo Gargallo]], Josep Granyer, Josep Llorens i Artigas, Lluís Mercadé, Josep de Togores, Josep Obiols, Miquel Soldevila, Jaume Mercadé, etc., displaying paintings, sculpture, ceramics, furniture, jewellery, [[vitreous enamel|enamel]], [[weaving|woven]] rugs and other works of art, most of which fell within the sphere of art deco.&lt;ref&gt;Josep L. Roig, ''Historia de Barcelona'', p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other Exhibition works ==

=== Teatre Grec ===
[[File:TeatreGrecBarcelona.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Teatre Grec]].]]
The landscaping of Montjuic mountain left works like the [[Teatre Grec]], an open-air theatre inspired by ancient Greek theatres (particularly the [[Epidaurus]]), designed by Ramon Reventós. Located in the site of an old [[quarry]], it has a 460 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; semicircular area, with a diameter of 70 m and a 2,000 person capacity.&lt;ref&gt;M. Carmen Grandas, ''L'Exposició Internacional de Barcelona de 1929'', pp. 156–157.&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently the site of a summer festival in Barcelona, the [[Festival Grec de Barcelona|Festival Grec]].

The theatre is situated within Laribal Gardens, designed by Forestier and Rubió, where the famous "Cat Fountain" is located at the entrance to a building by Puig i Cadafalch which has been convertred into a restaurant (1925). There are many sculptures in the gardens, with works by Josep Viladomat, Enric Casanovas, [[Josep Clarà]], [[Pablo Gargallo]], Antoni Alsina, Joan Rebull, Josep Dunyach, etc. In the Miramar zone the Montjuic swimming pool was built, as well as a restaurant which in 1959 became the first [[RTVE]] studio in Barcelona.&lt;ref&gt;Josep L. Roig, ''Historia de Barcelona'', p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Estadi Olímpic ===
[[File:Estadio Olímpico.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys|Olympic Stadium]].]]
At the top of the hill, next to the International Section, the [[Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys|Olympic Stadium]] was built by Pere Domènech i Roura within the sports section. It had a surface area of 66,075 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a 62,000 person capacity, making it the second biggest stadium in Europe at the time, after [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]]. It contained fields for the practice of [[association football|football]] and other sports, as well as athletics tracks and installations for various other sports such as [[boxing]], gymnastics and fencing, as well as tennis courts and a swimming pool. The main façade was monumental in atmosphere, with a dome and a tall tower topped with a shrine. It was decorated with sculptures, most notably the "Horse riders making the Olympic salute", two [[bronze]] equestrian sculptures by Pablo Gargallo. The building was remodelled by the architects [[Vittorio Gregotti]], Frederic de Correa, Alfons Milà, [[Joan Margarit i Consarnau|Joan Margarit]] and [[Carles Buxadé]] for the [[1992 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Carmen Grandas, ''L'Exposició Internacional de Barcelona de 1929'', pp. 175–179.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Poble Espanyol ===
[[File:Poble1.JPG|thumb|250px|Entrance to the [[Poble Espanyol]], with a reproduction of the walls of [[Ávila, Spain|Ávila]].]]
One work which had great public success was the [[Poble Espanyol]] ("Spanish Town"), a small showground containing reproductions of different urban and architectural environments from the entire national territory, in an atmosphere which ranges from the [[Folklore|folkloric]] to the strictly [[Archaeology|archaeological]]. It was designed by the architects Ramon Reventós and Francesc Folguera, with the artistic advice of Miquel Utrillo and Xavier Nogués. The exhibition is divided into six regional areas: [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]] and [[Extremadura]], Basque Country and [[Navarre]], Catalonia, [[Valencia]] and the [[Balearic Islands]], Andalusia, [[Aragon]] and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], around a Grand Plaza and surrounded by walls (a replica of the walls of [[Ávila, Spain|Ávila]]). With a surface area of 20,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, it contains 600 buildings, of which 200 can be visited. Among the monuments reproduced some of the most notable are the [[Mudéjar]] belltower of [[Utebo]] ([[Zaragoza]]), the palaces of the marquis of Peñaflor ([[Seville]]) and of Ovando Solís ([[Cáceres, Spain|Cáceres]]), the cloister of Sant Benet de Bages and the Roman belltower of [[Taradell]].&lt;ref&gt;Josep L. Roig, ''Historia de Barcelona'', p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact of the Exhibition ==
[[File:Palau Reial Pedralbes.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Palau Reial de Pedralbes]].]]
Just as in 1888, the 1929 Exhibition had a great impact on the city of Barcelona at an urban level, not only in Montjuic district, since improvement and refurbishment works were carried out throughout the city: Tetuán, Urquinaona and Letamendi squares were landscaped; the Marina bridge was built; the [[Plaça de Catalunya, Barcelona|Plaça de Catalunya]] was urbanised; and the [[Avinguda Diagonal]] was extended to the west and the [[Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes]] to the southwest. Various public works were also carried out: street paving and sewer systems were improved, public bathrooms were installed and gas lighting was replaced with electricity. The tradition of ongoing fairs, the ''[[Fira de Barcelona]]'', was established.

At the same time, several buildings were remodelled, such as the City Hall, where [[Josep Maria Sert]] painted the ''Salón de Crónicas'', and the [[Generalitat of Catalonia|Generalitat]], where the [[flamboyant]] bridge over Bisbe street was built. The post office and the [[Barcelona Estació de França|Estació de França]] (France Station) were completed after having spent several years under construction. The [[Palau Reial de Pedralbes]] was also built as a residence for the royal family, designed by Eusebi Bona and Francesc Nebot. During this period the first skyscraper in Barcelona was also constructed: the Telefónica building on the corner of Fontanella and Portal del Ángel, designed by Francesc Nebot.

Finally, they improved the city's communications, with construction during the 1920s of the [[Barcelona El Prat Airport]], the removal of level crossings within the city, the improvement of links with the city's peripheral neighbourhoods, the Sarrià train being moved underground ([[Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya]]), the electrification of public trams and the extension of [[Barcelona Metro line 3|metro line 3]] to [[Sants-Montjuïc|Sants]], connecting the Plaza de España with the Exhibition district. The construction of all these public works lead to a great demand for workers, causing a large increase in immigration to the city from all parts of Spain. At the same time, the increase in population lead to the construction of various workers' districts with "cheap housing", such as the Aunós Group in Montjuic and the Milans del Bosch and Baró de Viver Groups in Besós.&lt;ref&gt;M. Carmen Grandas, ''L'Exposició Internacional de Barcelona de 1929'', p. 48-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Agent Orange Act of 1991''' establishes provisions for the [[National Academy of Sciences]] to analyze and summarize [[scientific evidence]] regarding presumptive [[military service]] exposure to [[defoliant]]s, [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxins]] and [[herbicide]]s, better known as [[Agent Orange]], during the [[Vietnam War]] [[era]]. The [[United States Statutes at Large|United States Statute]] endorses an observation of human medical conditions directly related to [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]], [[soft-tissue sarcoma]], [[chloracne]], and consistent [[Acneiform eruption|acneform]] diseases for [[military personnel]] who served in the [[overseas Vietnamese]] region. The [[Act of Congress]] ratifies a [[medical research]] compilation of voluntarily contributed [[blood]] and [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] [[Sampling (medicine)|samples]] provided by [[Vietnam veteran|Vietnam-era veterans]] serving in [[Southeast Asia]] between 1961 and 1975.

The H.R. 556 [[legislation]] was passed by the 102nd United States Congressional session and enacted into law by the [[Presidency of George H. W. Bush|41st President of the United States]] [[George H.W. Bush]] on February 6, 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=19283  |title= George Bush: "Statement on Signing the Agent Orange Act of 1991," February 6, 1991  |author1=Peters, Gerhard |author2=Woolley, John T |publisher = University of California - Santa Barbara |work= The American Presidency Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
=====''Agent Orange Study''=====
On December 6, 1979, the [[96th United States Congress]] passed the ''Veterans Health Programs Extension and Improvement Act of 1979'' which was enacted into law by United States President Jimmy Carter on December 20, 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-93/pdf/STATUTE-93-Pg1092.pdf |title=Veterans Health Programs Extension and Improvement Act of 1979 ~ P.L. 96-151 |date=December 20, 1979 |series=93 Stat. 1092 ~ House Bill 3892 |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; House Bill 3892 endorsed the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]] to conduct an [[Epidemiology|epidemiological]] study concerning [[Exposure assessment|human exposure]] and the adverse health effects of [[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]] and [[Phenoxy herbicide|phenoxy herbicides]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/96th-congress/house-bill/3892 |title=H.R. 3892 ~ Veterans Health Programs Extension and Improvement Act of 1979 |date=May 2, 1979 |series=P.L. 96-151 ~ 93 Stat. 1092 |publisher=Congress.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic substances]] [[Protocol (science)|protocol]] was subject to approval by the [[Office of Technology Assessment]] as stated in the provisions of the H.R. 3892 legislation.

The 96th United States Senate passed bill S. 2096 sanctioning the Agent Orange study to be conducted by the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/96th-congress/senate-bill/2096 |title=S. 2096 ~ Agent Orange Study of 1979 |date=December 20, 1979 |publisher=Congress.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 2, 1980, President Jimmy Carter vetoed the Senate bill due to the repetitive purpose of the Section 307a1 provisions as stated in House bill 3892.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/250557 |title=Jimmy Carter: "Message to the Senate Returning S. 2096 Without Approval," January 2, 1980 |author1=Peters, Gerhard |author2=Woolley, John T |publisher=University of California - Santa Barbara |work=The American Presidency Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Aleppo offensive (October–December 2015)''' was an [[Military operation|operation]] that started on 16 October when the Syrian Army launched a large-scale strategic [[Offensive (military)|offensive]] south of [[Aleppo]]. The main objective of the operation was to secure the Azzan Mountains, while also creating a larger [[Buffer zone|buffer-zone]] around the Syrian Government’s only highway leading to the provincial capital.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almasdarnews.com/article/breaking-syrian-army-and-hezbollah-launch-their-southern-aleppo-offensive-4-sites-captured/|title=Breaking: Syrian Army and Hezbollah Launch Their Southern Aleppo Offensive – 4 Sites Captured|author=Leith Fadel|work=Al-Masdar News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The objective was also reportedly to set conditions for an upcoming offensive to isolate rebel forces in [[Aleppo]] City and to relieve the long-standing siege of a pro-government enclave in Aleppo Province.&lt;ref name="Business Insider" /&gt;

Gen. [[Qasem Soleimani]] was reported to have personally led the drive deep into the southern Aleppo countryside where many towns and villages were taken by government forces. Gen. Soleimani was in command of the Syrian Arab Army's 4th Mechanized Division, Hezbollah, Harakat Al-Nujaba (Iraqi), Kataebat Hezbollah (Iraqi), Liwaa Abu Fadl Al-Abbas (Iraqi), and Firqa Fatayyemoun (Afghan/Iranian volunteers).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almasdarnews.com/article/reports-of-general-qassem-suleimani-being-severely-wounded-in-southern-aleppo-prove-false/|title=Reports of General Qassem Suleimani Being Severely Wounded in Southern Aleppo Prove False|author=Leith Fadel|work=Al-Masdar News|accessdate=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Syrian government's progress deep into the southern Aleppo countryside has been attributed in large part to the Iranian leadership during the offensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/11/syria-opposition-advance-hama-countryside.html|title=Can Syrian opposition defend both Hama and Aleppo at the same time? - Al-Monitor: the Pulse of the Middle East|publisher=Al-Monitor|accessdate=4 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010012802/http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/11/syria-opposition-advance-hama-countryside.html|archive-date=10 October 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparations==
The origins of the planning of the offensive in Aleppo could be traced back to Gen. [[Qasem Soleimani]]'s visit to [[Moscow]] in July 2015. Gen. Soleimani was reportedly sent to Syria by the [[Supreme Leader of Iran|supreme leader]] of [[Iran]] himself, [[Ali Khamenei]], in order to discuss military matters with his Russian counterparts and coordinate a joint escalation of forces in Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/10/06/us-mideast-crisis-syria-soleimani-insigh-idUSKCN0S02BV20151006|title=How Iranian general plotted out Syrian assault in Moscow|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One month before the offensive south of Aleppo, the military launched [[Kuweires offensive (September 2015–present)|another operation]] east of the city in an attempt to break the two-year siege of the Kuweyres military air base.

Major General Qasem Soleimani reportedly traveled from [[Latakia Governorate]]'s northeastern countryside to the Al-Safeera District of southern Aleppo in order to personally oversee the first phase of the large-scale offensive in the Azzan Mountains. Soleimani did not travel alone to Aleppo – he was escorted by a large convoy of armored vehicles that were largely made up of Iraqi [[Shi’i]] militiamen; these aforementioned fighters were tasked with carrying out the planned operations around the Aleppo Governorate's countryside. Major General Suleimani traveled to Syria on the night of 12 October, to meet with the Iranian and Russian military advisors overseeing the large-scale operations around the Aleppo Governorate's rural terrain. He was joined by six other senior military officers from the [[Iranian Revolutionary Guard]].&lt;ref name="leithfadel1" /&gt;

==The offensive==

===Syrian Government offensive===
At 10 A.M. (Damascus Time) on the morning of 16 October, the Syrian Arab Army (SAA) – in coordination with Hezbollah, the National Defense Forces (NDF), and Al-Ba'ath Battalions – launched their large-scale southern Aleppo offensive after almost one year of inactivity along this rural area in the Azzan Mountains. According to field reports from the provincial capital, the Syrian Armed Forces and Hezbollah captured four sites from the Islamist rebels of Jabhat Al-Shamiyah (Levantine Front), Harakat Ahrar Al-Sham, and the Free Syrian Army (FSA), killing a number of combatants in the process of their advance in the Aleppo Governorate's southern countryside.

On 17 October, government forces backed by Shi'ite militia captured several villages, along with the Defense Battalion Base and the farms surrounding it.&lt;ref name="baath"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almasdarnews.com/article/news-alert-syrian-army-and-hezbollah-advance-to-al-shughaydilah-in-southern-aleppo/|title=News Alert: Syrian Army and Hezbollah Advance to Al-Shughaydilah in Southern Aleppo|author=Leith Fadel|work=Al-Masdar News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; By the next day, the military was in control of five villages, while it was unclear who controlled al-Shgaydalah after a rebel-counterattack to retake it from the Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.syriahr.com/en/2015/10/the-violent-clashes-continue-in-the-southern-countryside-of-aleppo-and-the-regime-forces-advance-in-the-area-again/|title=The violent clashes continue in the southern countryside of Aleppo, and the regime forces advance in the area again|author=Master|publisher=Syrian Observatory For Human Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="victims"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.syriahr.com/en/2015/10/about-60-victims-killed-during-the-regime-forces-advancement-in-the-southern-countryside-of-aleppo/|title=About 60 victims killed during the regime forces’ advancement in the southern countryside of Aleppo|publisher=Syrian Observatory for Human Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt; The counterattack was carried out by Sham Revolutionary Brigades and Division 13, the latter a [[CIA]]-funded secular group, with videos showing a [[TOW missile]] attack destroying a bulldozer and later capturing a [[BMP-1]].&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/10/19/us-mideast-crisis-syria-aleppo-idUSKCN0SD16O20151019|title=Syrian rebels say they receive more weapons for Aleppo battle|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4SzO8wFuI0|title=Syria – FSA Division 13 aftermath of SAA bulldozer hit with BGM-71 TOW near Atbin, Hama 17/10|date=18 October 2015|publisher=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christopher Kozak of the [[Institute for the Study of War]] speculated that the assault was nothing more than a diversionary [[Military tactics|tactic]] intended to move rebel forces away from reopening the access to the Shi'ite towns of Nubl and al-Zahraa and cut the Aleppo–Turkey highway, their primary objective in his opinion.&lt;ref name="Business Insider" /&gt; The Syrian Army eventually launched [[Northern Aleppo offensive (2016)|an offensive]] in Northern Aleppo on 1 February 2016 and broke the three-year [[Siege of Nubl and Al-Zahraa|siege of the two towns]], effectively cutting the Aleppo–Turkey supply route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/02/syrian-army-encircles-aleppo-ceasefire-talks-fade-160203033045269.html|title=Syrian army encircles Aleppo as ceasefire talks fade|publisher=Al Jazeera}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hezbollah's main incentive in participating in the offensive is believed to be similar to their agenda elsewhere, securing Shi'ite villages. Their ultimate objective is believed to be reaching the villages of [[Kafriya]] and [[Al-Fu'ah]], thus lifting the siege imposed by [[Al-Nusra Front]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almasdarnews.com/article/hezbollah-determined-to-reach-al-fouaa-and-kafraya-in-idlib-17km-to-go/|title=Hezbollah Determined to Reach Al-Fou'aa and Kafraya in Idlib: 17&amp;nbsp;km to go|author=Leith Fadel|work=Al-Masdar News|accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With reportedly hundreds of square kilometers brought under government control within the span of the first month of the offensive, Al-Masdar concluded that the overall effectiveness of both the senior Iranian revolutionary guards on the ground as well as the close Russian air-support have been noted as part of the main array of factors leading to a revitalized advance by government forces.&lt;ref name="leithfadel7"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almasdarnews.com/article/syrian-army-and-hezbollah-capture-over-210km-of-territory-in-southern-aleppo/|title=Syrian Army and Hezbollah Capture Over 210&amp;nbsp;km of Territory in Southern Aleppo|author=Leith Fadel|work=Al-Masdar News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almasdarnews.com/article/syrian-army-and-hezbollah-advance-in-southern-aleppo-as-the-islamist-rebels-struggle-to-halt-the-onslaught/|title=Syrian Army and Hezbollah Advance in Southern Aleppo as the Islamist Rebels Struggle to Halt the Onslaught|author=Leith Fadel|work=Al-Masdar News|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Established in 1948, the '''Audio Engineering Society''' ('''AES''') draws its membership from engineers, scientists, other individuals with an interest or involvement in the [[professional audio]] industry. The membership largely comprises engineers developing devices or products for audio, and persons working in audio content production. It also includes [[acoustician]]s, [[audiologist]]s, academics, and those in other disciplines related to audio. The AES is the only worldwide professional society devoted exclusively to audio technology.

The Society develops, reviews and publishes engineering standards for the audio and related media industries, and produces the '''AES Conventions''', which are held twice a year alternating between Europe and the US. The AES and individual regional or national ''sections'' also hold ''AES Conferences'' on different topics during the year.

==History==
The idea of a society dedicated solely to audio engineering had been discussed for some time before the first meeting, but was first proposed in print in a letter by Frank E. Sherry, of Victoria, Texas, in the December 1947 issue of the magazine [[Audio (magazine)|''Audio Engineering'']]. A New York engineer and audio consultant, C.J. LeBel, then published a letter agreeing, and saying that a group of audio professionals had already been discussing such a thing, and that they were interested in holding an organizational meeting. He asked interested persons to contact him for details. The response was enthusiastic and encouraging. Fellow engineer [[Norman C. Pickering]] published the date for an organizational meeting, and announced the appointment of LeBel as acting chairman, and himself as acting secretary.

The organizational meeting was held at the RCA Victor Studios in New York City on February 17, 1948. Acting chairman Mr. LeBel spoke first, emphasizing the professional, non-commercial, independent nature of the proposed organization. Acting Secretary Norman Pickering then discussed the need for a professional organization that could foster an exchange of knowledge in this quickly-growing field. The group agreed to form the Audio Engineering Society, and confirmed the acting executive committee, which consisted of John D. Colvin, C. J. LeBel, C. G. McProud, Norman C. Pickering and Chester O. Rackey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=November 1973 | title = How it All Began | journal = Journal of the Audio Engineering Society | volume =  21 | issue = Nr 21 | pages =35, 37, 39, 41 | url = http://www.aes.org/aeshc/AES_How-It-All-Began.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first AES technical membership meeting followed on March 11, with about 3500 attendees. The guest speaker at the first meeting was [[Harry F. Olson]], a prominent engineer and scientist at [[RCA]] and author of ''[[Acoustical engineering (book)|Acoustical Engineering]]'', who spoke on ''Problems of High-Fidelity Reproduction''.

==Membership==
From its New York beginnings, the AES has grown worldwide and as of October 31, 2010 had 14215 members, 4306 of whom are classified as students.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Members elect a Board of Governors and officers, who jointly set policy and procedures for the Society. The AES is a tax-exempt, 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation headquartered in New York.

==Journal==&lt;!--[[JAES]] redirects here--&gt;
The AES publishes a peer-reviewed journal, the ''Journal of the Audio Engineering Society'' (JAES).

==Conventions and conferences==
The AES produces two conventions each year as well as a number of topic-specific conferences. The fall convention is in North America and the Spring convention is in Europe. The first convention was in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aes.org/events/conventions/ |title=AES Conventions |access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical Council==
23 Technical Committees advise the AES Technical Council&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aes.org/technical |title=AES Technical Council and Committees |accessdate=2011-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; on emerging trends and areas of interest in the audio engineering community. The Committee meetings, held at Conventions, are open to participation by members and non-members alike, and are the venue for planning workshops, seminars and conferences in specific technical areas.

==Standards==
The AES has been involved in setting technical standards for audio since 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aes.org/aeshc/docs/aeshist/standards.hist/digital.standards/history-of-aes-digital-audio-eng-standardization.html |title=History of AES Digital Audio Engineering Standardization |accessdate=2015-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AES Standards Committee (AESSC), through a consensus system open to anyone materially affected by such standards, develops and publishes a number of standards on the subject of analog and digital audio recording, transmission, and/or reproduction. Notable standards include:

* [[AES3]] (also commonly known as AES/EBU) for digital audio interconnection
* [[AES10]] (also commonly known as MADI) for multichannel digital audio interconnection
* [[AES11]] for digital audio synchronization
* [[AES31]] file exchange format
* [[AES42]] for digitally interfaced microphones
* [[AES47]], [[AES51]] and [[AES53]] for sending AES3 digital audio data over [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] networks
* [[AES48]] on interconnections; grounding and EMC practices; and shields of connectors in audio equipment containing active circuitry
* [[AES64]] for coarse-groove mechanical audio recordings
* [[AES67]] for [[audio over IP]] interoperability

AESSC also provides input to [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] for development and revision of international standards in audio engineering.

AES does not charge for participation in the standards process, but does charge non-members for online copies of published standards.  Printed copies are available for a charge to both members and non-members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aes.org/standards |title=AES Standards |accessdate=2011-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gold Medal recipients==
The AES Gold Medal is the Society's highest honor, and given in recognition of outstanding achievements, sustained over a period of years, in the field of Audio Engineering. The award was established in 1971; it was formerly known as the John H. Potts Memorial Award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aes.org/awards/nominations/guidelines.cfm About the Audio Engineering Society. ''Award Guidelines'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there are several German sections of the AES and there is no formal connection to the [[Verband Deutscher Tonmeister]], the goals and activities of both organizations are closely related and there are several instances of double memberships, e.g. in the persons of Benjamin Bernfeld,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aes.org/aeshc/docs/jaes.obit/JAES_V59_12_PG1002.pdf Obituary for Benjamin Bernfeld 1928–2011]&lt;/ref&gt; Gerhard Steinke&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aes.org/technical/heyser/aes122.cfm Gerhard Steinke]&lt;/ref&gt; and Günther Theile.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hauptmikrofon.de/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=59&amp;Itemid=68 hauptmikrofon.de]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BRIXMIS logo.jpg|thumb|160x160px|BRIXMIS emblem]]
'''The British Commanders'-in-Chief Mission to the Soviet Forces in Germany''' ('''BRIXMIS''') was a [[Military liaison missions| military liaison mission]] which operated behind the [[Iron Curtain]] in [[East Germany]] during the [[Cold War]]. 

BRIXMIS existed from 1946 – shortly after the end of the Second World War – until the eve of the reunification of Germany in 1990.  Created by an agreement to exchange military missions, the stated object of BRIXMIS –  and the Soviet equivalent in the [[British Zone]], SOXMIS – was "to maintain Liaison between the Staff of the two Commanders-in-Chief and their Military Governments in the Zones".{{sfnp|Gibson|2012|p=223}}

This liaison was undertaken by 31 members – 11 officers and no more than 20 others – appointed to each mission. These liaison staff were issued passes allowing freedom of travel and circulation, with the exception of certain restricted areas, within each other's zone. Such "tours", as they became known, were conducted in uniform and in clearly identifiable vehicles. Nevertheless, although never openly stated, this liaison role also presented an ideal opportunity for the gathering of military intelligence through reconnaissance and surveillance and the occasional 'borrowing' of military matériel. This opportunity was fully exploited by both sides.

BRIXMIS was ideally placed to "test the temperature" of Soviet intentions from its privileged position behind the Iron Curtain. However, and perhaps more importantly, it offered a channel for communication between West and East via its secondary but significant role of liaison – the initial reason for its establishment.

== History ==
Following the establishment of the four [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] zones of control in [[Germany]] after the Second World War, it became clear that some mechanism was needed to facilitate liaison between the occupying military governments, particularly between those of the Western Allies and the [[Soviet Union]]. The exchange of military liaison missions appeared to offer a convenient solution.

[[File:BRIXMIS shoulder flash.jpg|left|150px|thumb|Flash worn on the upper arm by uniformed BRIXMIS personnel]]
The reciprocal agreement establishing the first of these, between the British and Soviet zones – the [[Robertson-Malinin Agreement]] –  was reached on 16 September 1946 between the respective [[Chief of staff (military)|chiefs of staff]]. Subsequent agreements in 1947 led to the exchange of similar missions between the Soviet zone and those controlled by [[FMLM| French]] and [[USMLM| US]] forces, although the British–Soviet arrangement was significantly larger than either of the others, with 31 individuals allowed passes in each case.{{efn-lr|The terms of the Noiret-Malinin Agreement allowed the French Mission to hold 18 passes, and the Huebner-Malinin Agreement restricted the US to just 14.}}

The British Mission comprised members of the British Army, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force who conducted uniformed liaison activities in marked cars and in two [[de Havilland Canada DHC-1 Chipmunk|Chipmunk]] light aircraft – the latter ostensibly to allow aircrew to maintain crew currency while posted to the Mission. 

BRIXMIS maintained a permanent presence in its nominal home, the Mission House in [[Potsdam]], East Germany, but its actual headquarters and operational centre were in [[West Berlin]]. These were located in London Block, a part of the Olympic Stadium complex which housed the military government of the British Sector of Berlin. The original Potsdam Mission House at Wildpark was in fact damaged during anti-British disturbances in 1958, and a new one (34 Seestrasse) was provided by the Soviet authorities, together with a sum of money in reparation.{{sfnp|Geraghty|1996|pp=74–75}}

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File: BRIXMIS number plate.jpg|thumb|BRIXMIS number plate, with Russian words "{{lang|ru|Британская военная миссия}}" (lit. British Military Mission) below.]] --&gt;
Although symbolically highly significant, the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]] in 1989 simply returned the situation to what it had been before its erection in 1961, and the need for liaison and the gathering of intelligence became no less pressing. The agreements therefore remained in place until 2 October 1990, when all three were suspended on the eve of [[German reunification|Germany's reunification]].{{sfnp|Gibson|2012|p=198}}

While BRIXMIS formally disbanded on 31 December 1990, a small number of its staff remained to conduct similar operations covertly and without the quasi-diplomatic immunity of the Robertson-Malinin Agreement during the course of the next three years. The rationale for this 'son-of-BRIXMIS' unit is as curious as the paradox of the liaison-spying roles of the previous 45 years. In 1990, the fact remained that the West could not be certain that the Soviet Union would fully withdraw from the now united Germany.{{sfnp|Gibson|2012|p=199}}

== Liaison ==
Other than via the occasional formal message, most official liaison consisted of formal events attended by both sides. Such events included, for example, a parade on the Queen's birthday, receptions at the Mission House,  and a [[Remembrance Day]] religious service at the [[Stahnsdorf]] War Graves cemetery, just south of Berlin. There were also regular wreath-laying visits to the British memorials at the former concentration camps of [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]], [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]], and [[Ravensbrück concentration camp| Ravensbrück]].{{sfnp|Williams|2006|p=5}}

Informal contact was maintained through parties – usually in celebration of some one-off event – to which members of SERB, the Soviet External Relations Branch,{{efn-lr|SERB controlled the issue of passes and was responsible for the maintenance of the Mission House in Potsdam. It also acted as the clearing house and point of contact for all official business between the Chief of BRIXMIS and the Soviet armed forces.}} were also invited. 

Members of the Mission holding a full "touring"’ pass could also go on what were known as "cultural tours", in which tourers and their families could stay, usually for several nights, in hotels of some of the main cities of East Germany. Such trips offered excellent opportunities for getting to know members of the Soviet and East German armed forces (and civilians) who might not have otherwise been met in the course of normal duties.{{sfnp|Williams|2006|p=8}}

==Intelligence gathering==
The liaison agreement allowed staff to travel throughout the respective zones of control with only limited restrictions on movement.  Some areas remained restricted on a permanent basis, whereas others were subject to temporary restriction, with processes established to notify respective missions when these were imposed.{{efn-lr|The reasons for the imposition of temporary restrictions were always of great interest, and means were found to ensure that those already out on tour could be informed of their whereabouts whilst still being able to deny having had the chance to be told about them.}}

[[File:Missions prohibited sign.jpg|left|thumb|Typical sign intended to prevent Missions from entering prohibited areas in East Germany]] 
Whilst these were to a large extent respected, there were also many unnotified "Missions prohibited" signs around most military installations, which were invariably ignored and even at times taken home as souvenirs. Tours found in places where they were not supposed to be were usually pursued and, if caught, arrested and detained for a while at the nearest ''Kommandatura''.{{efn-lr|As the Missions refused to acknowledge the authority of either the East German Army (NVA) or police (''[[Volkspolizei]]'' or "VoPo") the tour officer always insisted on dealing only with the local Soviet ''Kommandant'' (garrison commander).}} The main risk to persistent offenders was that they might be declared ''persona non grata'' and have their passes withdrawn – a complete waste of the expensive specialist training they had undergone before being posted to BRIXMIS.

This freedom of movement throughout East Germany allowed the collection of intelligence on [[Warsaw Pact]] forces, particularly those of the Soviet Union and East Germany, which included force disposition and movement, orders of battle, equipment and professional standards. The configuration of liaison teams was established in the initial agreement and remained in place throughout the life of the programme. These were made up of a tour officer, a tour [[non-commissioned officer|NCO]] and a driver, all of whom in later years received similar training.  Their ground operations tours were conducted in cars, reconnoitring either on an ad-hoc basis or as directed by [[Defence Intelligence]] in London.  Such tours could take a number of days with the teams being entirely self-sufficient, cooking their own meals and sleeping in the countryside either in the vehicle, as the driver always had to, or, as the other two normally did, in bivouacs or one-man tents. Once they had left Potsdam, they were entirely out of contact with their headquarters, and therefore left to their own devices to deal with any unforeseen circumstances, whether they be problems or opportunities.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Sov guard takes aim.jpg|thumb|A Soviet guard takes aim at a Mission Tour]] --&gt;Incidents of open hostility to tourers – such as being physically attacked or shot at, or having the vehicle deliberately rammed – were infrequent, but they did nevertheless happen occasionally.{{sfnp|Geraghty|1996|pp=76–78}} What was very common, however, was the tailing of crews by so-called "narks" – members of the East German State Security Service ([[Stasi]]). A combination of superior equipment, driving skills and the ever-increasing knowledge of the local terrain possessed by the BRIXMIS crews meant, however, that they could usually be shaken off.{{sfnp|Geraghty|1996|pp=82–83}}

The British Mission was almost entirely overt, in that all personnel operated in uniform and in marked vehicles, although there were occasions when the officer and tour NCO would leave the driver in the vehicle and explore on foot, while deliberately concealing any obvious evidence of their military identity.{{efn-lr|When searching through rubbish tips for discarded items of interest, for example, they removed all badges from outer garments and left anything in the car which might be incriminating if dropped, including their passes.{{sfnp|Gibson|2012|pp=69–70}}}} The reciprocal Soviet Mission to the British zone operated in a more covert manner, however, in that it also had an [[agent handling]] capability.{{sfnp|Geraghty|1996|pp=38–39}} 

BRIXMIS was also noted for many technical intelligence coups,{{sfnp|Geraghty|1996|pp=291–303}} including:  	 
* Secretly bringing a [[Yak-28|Yak-28P]] ''Firebar''{{'}}s Skip Spin (Oryel-D) [[radar]] and [[Tumansky R-11|Tumansky R-11 AF2-300]] jet engines back to [[Farnborough Airfield|Farnborough]] for inspection after it crashed into the Stössensee lake on the [[River Havel]] in Berlin.
* Measuring the calibre of the [[30 mm automatic cannon 2A42|30mm gun]] of the then brand-new [[BMP-2]] [[armoured personnel carrier]], by pressing a lunchtime apple into it and taking an impression.
* Stealing [[reactive armour]] from a Russian tank, for analysis.

==Vehicles==
[[File:BRIXMIS Opel Kapitän stuck in snow 1958.jpg|left|thumb|BRIXMIS Opel Kapitän stuck in the snow, Winter 1957–8]]
The BRIXMIS contingent used [[Opel Kapitän]] cars in the 1950s, followed by [[Opel Admiral]] cars and their later replacement, the [[Opel Senator]], converted to four-wheel drive in the UK.  However, the operational need for a vehicle with a higher degree of cross-country performance than the mainly on-road Opel Senator led them to acquire a number of extensively modified Range-Rover vehicles. These proved to be fragile and expensive to run and maintain in Germany. With this in mind, they acquired a single [[Mercedes-Benz G-Class]] for trials purposes in 1980–81.  After extensive evaluation, they adopted the Geländewagen as the general tour vehicle, and in various models, it lasted in service until they ceased operations in 1990. An ex-BRIXMIS G-Wagen is on display at the [http://www.militaryintelligencemuseum.org/ Military Intelligence Museum] at Chicksands, England.
[[File:DHC-1 Chipmunk St-Rambert 01.jpg|thumb|[[de Havilland Chipmunk]] T10 – a type used for photo-reconnaissance missions by BRIXMIS]]

BRIXMIS also exercised the British legal right under the [[Potsdam Agreement]] to use the airspace over both [[West Berlin|West]] and [[East Berlin]], as well as the air corridors to and from [[West Germany]] to the city.  Two [[de Havilland Chipmunk]] T10s were based at [[RAF Gatow]] and RAF aircrew posted to BRIXMIS had access to them for the conduct of photographic [[Aerial reconnaissance|reconnaissance flights]] within the designated airspace; a radius of 12 nautical miles within the Berlin Control Zone (BCZ) from the Berlin Air Safety Centre (BASC) located in West Berlin.

After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Chipmunk reconnaissance flights soon ceased and the two Chipmunks were flown to [[RAF Laarbruch]], in Western Germany to await disposal action.  Chipmunk WB466 was flown back to Berlin and was donated to the Allied Museum in Berlin, where it remains on display today.&lt;ref &gt;{{Cite web

'''Bhishma Ashtami''' (Bhishmashtami) is a [[Hindu]] festival dedicated to [[Bhishma]] of the great Indian epic ''[[Mahabharata]]''. It is believed that Bhishma, also known as 'Ganga Putr Bhism' or 'Bhishma Pitamaha', departed from his soul on this chosen day. This occurred during the propitious 'Uttarayan period'; that is, the daytime of devas. Bhishma Ashtami is observed during the month of [[Magha (month)|Magha]] in the [[Hindu calendar]]. It corresponds to the months of January–February.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hindu-blog.com/2009/01/bhisma-ashtami-bhismashtami.html|title=Bhisma Ashtami 2018 date – Importance of Bhisma Ashtami Snan - Tarpan - Vrat|website=www.hindu-blog.com|access-date=2017-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Bhishma Ashtami is a minor holiday observed in [[Bengal]] and parts of southern India in remembrance of Bhishma, a warrior who fought and died in the [[Kurukshetra War]], the battle which fills so many pages of the [[Mahabharata]]. Bhishma was the son of [[Shantanu]], who had given his son a boon in that he would be allowed to choose his own day of death. Bhishma had taken an oath not to marry and that he would ever remain faithful to his father's throne.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KDU30Ae4S4cC&amp;pg=PA114&amp;dq=bhishma+ashtami&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiX5Lzu2rnTAhVKOSYKHeBpCrYQ6AEIIjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=bhishma%20ashtami&amp;f=false|title=Religious Celebrations: An Encyclopedia of Holidays, Festivals, Solemn Observances, and Spiritual Commemorations|last=Melton|first=J.

The anniversary of Bhishma Pitamah's death is observed during Magha Shukla Ashtami{{clarify|date=May 2017}}. The day is known as Bhishma Ashtami and indisputably the death anniversary of Bhishma Pitamah. According to the legend associated with the day, Bhishma waited for 58 days before leaving his body. Bhishma Pitamah left his body on the auspicious day of Uttarayana, i.e. on the day when the Lord Surya started moving towards Northward after completing six month period of Dakshiyana.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.drikpanchang.com/festivals/bhishma-ashtami/info/bhishma-pitamah-death-time.html|title=Death Anniversary of Bhishma Pitamah {{!}} Death Chronology of Bhishma Pitamah|last=LLP|first=Adarsh Mobile Applications|website=www.drikpanchang.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is the day Bhishma decided to leave his body. The day Bhishma left his body known as Bhishma Ashtami (Magha Shukla Ashtami). He has special boon of death as per his will (Ichha Mrityu) from his father. Hence, despite lying on a bed of arrows he continued in that position and then left his body on Sankranti. Hindus believe that the one who dies during Uttarayana goes to heaven.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b2iyCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT30&amp;dq=bhishma+ashtami&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwixxLHPmcHTAhUL0YMKHahoAQ8Q6AEINDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=bhishma%20ashtami&amp;f=false|title=Hindu Prayers, Gods and Festivals|last=Tumuluru|first=Kamal Kumar|date=2015-04-23|publisher=Partridge Publishing|isbn=9781482847079|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Steps to Follow the Performance of  'Bhishma Ashtami Pujan'==
* People observe the ritual of ‘Ekodishta Shraddha’ in the honor of Bhishma. According to the belief, only those devotees whose fathers are not alive anymore can perform this ritual. However, some communities do not follow this and believe that anyone can perform the ‘pooja’.
* People visit the nearby river banks and do the ‘Tarpan’ ritual in order to bring peace to Bhishma Pitamah’s soul. They also honor their ancestors through the same ritual.
* People take holy dips in the [[Ganga river]] and offer boiled rice and sesame seeds in order to come out of the cycle of life and death and purify their souls.
* Devotees observe fast during the day and perform ‘Arghyam’ and chant ‘Bhishma Ashtami mantra’ to seek the deity’s blessings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pandit.com/bhishma-ashtami-rituals-in-india/|title=Bhishma Ashtami rituals in India - Pandit.com|website=www.pandit.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Boston Cyberarts Festival''' used to be the largest festival of digital art,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.massculturalcouncil.org/conference/bios_07.html|title=Creative Economy|publisher=Massachusetts Cultural Council 2009|accessdate=2009-02-11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208222932/http://www.massculturalcouncil.org/conference/bios_07.html|archivedate=8 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; performance and film created using new technology in the USA.  Around 22,000 people attended the festival in 2007 where they witnessed the work of over 200 artists from all over the world.

The festival took place once every two years in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], USA usually spanning the last week of April and the first week in May. The festival was first held on 1 – 15 May 1999, and the last festival took place on 22 April – 8 May 2011. The Festivals were organized by Boston Cyberarts Inc, a non-profit arts organization.

{{As of|2013}}, the director of Cyberarts is George Fifield, who was one of the original cofounders of the organization. Boston Cyberarts, Inc. continues to exist as a non-profit arts organization, but has redirected its energies to promoting the arts and technology year-round, rather than biennially.  The most visible continuing effort is the Boston Cyberarts Gallery, which used to be the Axiom Center for New and Experimental Media.  The gallery was and is located in the [[Jamaica Plain]] neighborhood of Boston, in the [[Green Street (MBTA station)|Green Street]] station building on the [[MBTA]] [[Orange Line (MBTA)|Orange Line]] rapid transit line.

The online presence of the past Boston Cyberarts Festivals, including online exhibits, is archived and still accessible free of charge.&lt;ref name=Archive&gt;{{cite web|last=Boston Cyberarts, Inc.|title=Boston Cyberarts Festival Archive|url=http://bostoncyberarts.org/boston-cyberarts-festival-archive/|work=Boston Cyberarts|publisher=Boston Cyberarts, Inc.|accessdate=8 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130414083550/http://bostoncyberarts.org/boston-cyberarts-festival-archive/|archivedate=14 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
The festival was located in Boston, Massachusetts. The festival usually featured a central headquarters where visitors could get information about the events and also attend the opening night party. Massachusetts had arguably the densest population of digital artists in the US, making Boston the high-technology cultural center of the country.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}  The festival’s events were held in Boston’s art galleries, museums, universities, and public spaces.  For those unable to attend the festival physically, there were virtual festival events held on the internet.

===First event===
Around 22,000 people attended the Festival in 2007 where they witnessed the work of over 200 artists from all over the world. Events and exhibitions took place at 81 Festival events organized by over 60 arts organizations in Boston. The events featured:
* Visual art
* Animation
* Video
* Music
* Film
* Dance
* Installations
* Lectures
* Conferences; and
* Discussions

Boston Cyberarts Inc also presented its own exhibitions and performances during the Festival. For example, at the Computer Museum they presented the exhibition ‘Mind into Matter’, co-curated by Festival director George Fifield and Francine Koslow Miller. This was the first international survey of digital [[sculpture]]. Over 100 events took place organized by 60 cultural and education institutions, including [[museum]] and [[art museum|gallery]] exhibitions and visual arts programming.

==Art==
The art work at the festival has been produced using computers; often alongside more traditional mediums such as paint, photography, film, musical instruments or dance and performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bostoncyberarts.com/apropos/apropos_artworks.php?hash=5210782f91b5057afb873947d330abe2|title=Browse Artists &amp; Artworks descriptions|accessdate=2009-02-21}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival celebrates international art and the wealth of artistic talent in its home region of Massachusetts, United States.

==Awards==
In 2007, the Boston Cyberarts Festival received the following awards:
* The [[Commonwealth Award]]. This is the State’s highest honor in the arts, humanities and sciences. This award recognizes an individual or group that has created economic activity, created jobs or generated income through arts and culture. The Awards are given every two years by the [[Massachusetts Cultural Council]] (MCC), and are chosen by a committee of cultural and business leaders from a pool of nominations received from across the State.

[[File:Traces brunes sur une bague de roulement.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The inner race of this roller [[bearing (mechanical)|bearing]] has been [[roller burnishing|burnished]] by the bearing's rollers.]]

'''Burnishing''' is the [[deformation (engineering)|plastic deformation]] of a surface due to [[friction|sliding contact]] with another object. Visually, burnishing smoothens the texture of a rough surface and makes it shinier. Burnishing may occur on any sliding surface if the contact stress locally exceeds the [[yield (engineering)|yield strength]] of the material.

==Mechanics==
[[File:Bille gorge.png|thumb|right|220px|A ball carves a channel through a flat plate.]]
The action of a hardened ball against a softer, flat plate illustrates the process of burnishing. If the ball is pressed directly into the plate, stresses develop in both objects around the area where they contact. As this normal force increases, both the ball and the plate's surfaces deform.

The deformation caused by the hardened ball increases with the magnitude of the force pressing against it. If the force on it is small, when the force is released both the ball and plate's surface will return to their original, undeformed shape. In this case, the stresses in the plate are always less than the yield strength of the material, so the deformation is purely elastic. Since it was given that the flat plate is softer than the ball, the plate's surface will always deform more.

If a larger force is used, there will also be plastic deformation and the plate's surface will be permanently altered. A bowl-shaped indentation will be left behind, surrounded by a ring of raised material that was displaced by the ball. The stresses between the ball and the plate are described in more detail by [[Hertzian contact stress|Hertzian stress theory]].

Dragging the ball across the plate will have a different effect than pressing.  In this case, the force on the ball can be decomposed into two component forces: one normal to the plate's surface, pressing it in, and the other tangential, dragging it along. As the tangential component is increased, the ball will start to slide along the plate. At the same time, the normal force will deform both objects, just as with the static situation. If the normal force is low, the ball will rub against the plate but not permanently alter its surface. The rubbing action will create friction and heat, but it will not leave a mark on the plate. However, as the normal force increases, eventually the stresses in the plate's surface will exceed its yield strength. When this happens the ball will plow through the surface and create a trough behind it. The plowing action of the ball is burnishing. Burnishing also occurs when the ball can rotate, as would happen in the above scenario if another flat plate was brought down from above to induce downwards loading, and at the same time to cause rotation and translation of the ball, or in the case of a ball bearing.

[[File:Contacts.png|thumb|right|Upon magnification, two flat plates touch only at a few asperities.]]
Burnishing also occurs on surfaces that conform to each other, such as between two flat plates, but it happens on a microscopic scale. Even the smoothest of surfaces will have imperfections if viewed at a high enough magnification. The imperfections that extend above the general form of a surface are called [[Asperity (materials science)|asperities]], and they can plow material on another surface just like the ball dragging along the plate. The combined effect of many of these asperities produce the smeared texture that is associated with burnishing.

==Effects on mechanical components==
Burnishing is normally undesirable in mechanical components for a variety of reasons, sometimes simply because its effects are unpredictable. Even light burnishing will significantly alter the surface finish of a part. Initially the finish will be smoother, but with repetitive sliding action, grooves will develop on the surface along the sliding direction. The plastic deformation associated with burnishing will harden the surface and generate compressive residual stresses. Although these properties are usually advantageous, excessive burnishing leads to sub-surface cracks which cause [[spalling]], a phenomenon where the upper layer of a surface flakes off of the bulk material.

Burnishing may also affect the ''performance of a machine''. The plastic deformation associated with burnishing creates greater heat and friction than from rubbing alone. This reduces the efficiency of the machine and limits its speed. Furthermore, plastic deformation alters the form and geometry of the part. This reduces the precision and accuracy of the machine. The combination of higher friction and degraded form often leads to a runaway situation that continually worsens until the component fails.

To prevent destructive burnishing, sliding must be avoided, and in rolling situations, loads must be beneath the spalling threshold. In the areas of a machine that slide with respect to each other, roller bearings can be inserted so that the components are in rolling contact instead of sliding. If sliding cannot be avoided, then a lubricant should be added between the components. The purpose of the lubricant in this case is to separate the components with a lubricant film so they cannot contact. The lubricant also distributes the load over a larger area, so that the local contact forces are not as high. If there was already a lubricant, its film thickness must be increased; usually this can be accomplished by increasing the viscosity of the lubricant.

==In manufacturing==
Burnishing is not always bad. If it occurs in a controlled manner, it can have desirable effects. Burnishing processes are used in manufacturing to improve the size, shape, surface finish, or surface hardness of a workpiece. It is essentially a forming operation that occurs on a small scale. The benefits of burnishing often include combatting [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]] failure, preventing [[corrosion]] and stress corrosion, texturing surfaces to eliminate visual defects, closing porosity, creating surface compressive [[residual stress]].

There are several forms of burnishing processes, the most common are roller burnishing and ball burnishing (a subset of which is also referred to as ballizing). In both cases, a burnishing tool runs against the workpiece and plastically deforms its surface. In some instances of the latter case (and always in ballizing), it rubs, in the former it generally rotates and rolls. The workpiece may be at ambient temperature, or heated to reduce the forces and wear on the tool. The tool is usually hardened and coated with special materials to increase its life.

Ball burnishing, or ballizing, is a replacement for other bore finishing operations such as grinding, honing, or polishing. A ballizing tool consists of one or more over-sized balls that are pushed through a hole. The tool is similar to a [[Broaching (metalworking)|broach]], but instead of cutting away material, it plows it out of the way.&lt;ref name=tmeh /&gt;

Ball burnishing is also used as a deburring operation. It is especially useful for removing the burr in the middle of a through hole that was drilled from both sides.&lt;ref name=tmeh&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bakerjian, Ramon |author2=Cubberly, W. H. |title=Tool and manufacturing engineers handbook |publisher=Society of Manufacturing Engineers |location=Dearborn, Mich |year=1989 |pages=45–7 to 45-11 |isbn=0-87263-351-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ball burnishing tools of another type are sometimes used in CNC milling centres to follow a ball-nosed milling operation: the hardened ball is applied along a zig-zag toolpath in a holder similar to a ball-point pen, except that the 'ink' is pressurised, recycled lubricant. This combines the productivity of a machined finish which is achieved by a 'semi-finishing' cut, with a better finish than obtainable with slow and time-consuming finish cuts. The feedrate for burnishing is that associated with 'rapid traverse' rather than finish machining.

Roller burnishing, or surface rolling, is used on cylindrical, conical, or disk shaped workpieces. The tool resembles a roller bearing, but the rollers are generally very slightly tapered so that their envelope diameter can be accurately adjusted. The rollers typically rotate within a cage, as in a roller bearing. Typical applications for roller burnishing include hydraulic system components, shaft fillets, and sealing surfaces.&lt;ref name=kalpakjian&gt;{{cite book |title=Manufacturing Processes for Engineering Materials |last=Kalpakjian |first=Serope  |author2=Steven R. Schmid |year=2003 |publisher=Pearson Education |isbn=81-7808-990-4 |pages=152 |oclc=66275970 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Very close control of size can be exercised.

Burnishing also occurs to some extent in machining processes. In turning, burnishing occurs if the cutting tool is not sharp, if a large negative [[rake angle]] is used, if a very small depth of cut is used, or if the workpiece material is gummy. As a cutting tool wears, it becomes more blunt and the burnishing effect becomes more pronounced. In grinding, since the abrasive grains are randomly oriented and some are not sharp, there is always some amount of burnishing. This is one reason the grinding is less efficient and generates more heat than turning. In drilling, burnishing occurs with drills that have lands to burnish the material as it drills into it. Regular twist drills or straight fluted drills have 2 lands to guide them through the hole. On burnishing drills there are 4 or more lands, similar to reamers.

The '''Carnaval de Ponce''' (English: Ponce Carnival), officially '''Carnaval Ponceño''', is an annual celebration held in [[Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponce]], [[Puerto Rico]]. The celebration lasts one week and it ends on the day before [[Ash Wednesday]]. Thus, it is generally held in February and sometimes in March. It is one of the oldest carnivals of the [[Western Hemisphere]], dating back to 1858.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.letsgotoponce.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=155&amp;Itemid=81 ''Ponce Carnival Goes International In its 150th Anniversary Edition.''

== Costumes and masks ==
[[Image:Vejigante mask.svg|160px|left|thumb|Illustration of a vejigante mask]]
One of the traditions of the Carnaval is the appearance of the "[[vejigante]]s", which is a colorful costume traditionally representing the [[devil]] or, simply, evil. Vejigantes carry blown cow [[bladder]]s with which they make sounds and hit carnival attendees throughout the processions. 

The traditional vejigante masks of the Ponce carnival are made of paper mache and are characterized by the presence of multiple horns. The mask was developed by Ponce artisans in the early part of the 20th century. They are made from newsprint paper mixed with homemade glue and paint. Sophisticated Ponce carnival masks are sought after by mask collectors and masks from Ponce have become a symbol of Puerto Rico at large.&lt;ref&gt;Antonio R. Gomez and Margarita Diaz.

The '''Delaware State Fair''' is the annual [[state fair]] for the state of [[Delaware]]. It is held in [[Harrington, Delaware|Harrington]]. The fair is a ten-day event at the end of July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Delaware State Fair|url=http://www.delawarestatefair.com/|accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Delaware State Fair - 2012 (7681707622).jpg|thumb|right|The midway of the Delaware State Fair in 2012]]
The first Delaware State Fair was held in [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]], with mentions of the "Delaware State Fair" being found in newspapers as far back as 1869.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Seventeenth Annual Exhibition of the Pennsylvania State Agricultural Society|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/44276585/|work=The Harrisburg Telegraph |location=Harrisburg, Pennsylvania |date=September 29, 1869 |access-date=2017-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1878, the Delaware State Fair was moved to [[Fairview Park Fair Grounds]] in [[Dover, Delaware|Dover]] and held September 24–27.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Eastern Shore Jottings|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/52212425/|work=The Times |location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |date=July 17, 1878 |access-date=2017-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opening speaker of the 1878 Delaware State Fair was [[Daniel Henry Chamberlain]], former [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Governor of South Carolina]], as well as guest speakers [[J. Proctor Knott]], at the time a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] representing [[Kentucky's 4th congressional district]], and [[Samuel S. Cox]], then Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives representing [[New York's 6th congressional district]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=untitled|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/52212548/|work=The Times |location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |date=August 2, 1878 |access-date=2017-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Delaware State Fair|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/58964009/|work=The Charlotte Observer |location=Charlotte, North Carolina |date=August 6, 1878 |access-date=2017-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917, the state fair moved to [[Elsmere, Delaware|Elsmere]] where the Delaware State Fair Association had purchased property and built a fairgrounds within the town limits, in the area of the current Filbert, Birch, and Dover Avenues. The fairgrounds included racetracks, agricultural exhibits, and stages for various entertainment acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Town History and Photos|url=http://elsmere.delaware.gov/faq/town-history-and-photos/|work=The Town of Elsmere, Delaware|accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first fair on the current grounds was held in 1920 and was known as the [[Kent County, Delaware|Kent]] and [[Sussex County, Delaware|Sussex County]] Fair. It lasted four days and was held on {{convert|30|acre|m2}}. Today the fairgrounds encompass over {{convert|300|acre|km2}} and feature concerts, wrestling, rodeo, races, agricultural exhibits, slot machines, a midway, and other typical state fair demonstrations and events. The property also hosted a [[Donald Trump]] rally for his [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|presidential campaign]] on April 22, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bittle|first=Matt|title=Trump wows crowd in Harrington|work=Delaware State News|location=Dover, DE|date=April 22, 2016|url=https://delawarestatenews.net/government/trump-wows-crowd-in-harrington/|accessdate=March 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''EuroSTAR Conference''' is the premier and largest gathering of [[Europe]]an [[software testing]] professionals. EuroSTAR Conference 2018 will take place in the Hague, Netherlands from November 12 to November 15, 2018.

==History of EuroSTAR==
The first EuroSTAR [[Business conference|conference]] took place in [[London]] in October 1993 as a sister conference of (US-based) STAR Conferences organised by [[William C. Hetzel]] and Gelperin in conjunction with the [[British Computer Society]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.testingreferences.com/testinghistory.php|title=Testing References - The History of Software Testing|last=Meerts|first=Joris|website=www.testingreferences.com|access-date=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''EuroSTAR''' stands for '''Euro'''pean '''S'''oftware '''T'''esting '''A'''nalysis &amp; '''R'''eview.

EuroSTAR is a pan-European software testing conference and takes place in a different European city each year. Cities visited so far include London (1993, 1995) [[Brussels]] (1994, 1997) [[Amsterdam]] (1996, 2003, 2012), [[Edinburgh]] (1997, 2002), [[Munich]] (1998), [[Barcelona]] (1999), [[Copenhagen]] (2000, 2005, 2010, 2017), Manchester (2006, 2011), Stockholm (2001, 2007, 2009), [[Cologne]] (2004), [[The Hague]] (2008), [[Dublin]] (2014) and Maastricht (2015). The annual conference has been the origin of many notable milestones in the history of software testing including the introduction of the W-Model by Paul Herzlich in 1993,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.softwaretestingtimes.com/2010/04/v-model-to-w-model-w-model-in-sdlc.html|title=V Model to W Model {{!}} W Model in SDLC Simplified|website=Software Testing Times|access-date=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; the foundation of Dutch Special Interest Group in Software Testing (SIGIST) TestNet at EuroSTAR 1996 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.testnet.org/testnet/download/common/20161023_historie-testnet-voor-website-v0-10.pdf|title=History of TestNet|last=Philip|first=Harro|date=2016-10-23|work=TestNet|access-date=2016-10-23|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  and the foundation of the Test Lab (2009) which has since become a focal point at many international conferences on software testing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Proceedings at EuroSTAR have been cited in many publications on software testing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=54UKereAdJ4C&amp;pg=PA50&amp;lpg=PA50&amp;dq=EuroSTAR+Conference&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ox7cyr4yy-&amp;sig=Xwj-L8hOooqKX6A0Ad35OoWM2Ww&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiozNrKo-XTAhVEFMAKHcuzBwI4PBDoAQhAMAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=EuroSTAR%20Conference&amp;f=false|title=Risk-based E-business Testing|last=Gerrard|first=Paul|last2=Thompson|first2=Neil|date=2002-01-01|publisher=Artech House|isbn=9781580535700|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=3Pq5BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA527&amp;lpg=PA527&amp;dq=EuroSTAR+Conference&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=z_EugzpKjI&amp;sig=eURLD3tKZwEpLjiMAuVNwVwLBD8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiozNrKo-XTAhVEFMAKHcuzBwI4PBDoAQhaMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=EuroSTAR%20Conference&amp;f=false|title=Computational Science and Its Applications -- ICCSA 2013: 13th International Conference, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, July 24-27, 2013, Proceedings|last=Murgante|first=Beniamino|last2=Misra|first2=Sanjay|last3=Carlini|first3=Maurizio|last4=Torre|first4=Carmelo M.|last5=Nguyen|first5=Hong-Quang|last6=Taniar|first6=David|last7=Apduhan|first7=Bernady O.|last8=Gervasi|first8=Osvaldo|date=2013-06-22|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783642396434|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=hJdCVEjSSb0C&amp;pg=PA544&amp;lpg=PA544&amp;dq=EuroSTAR+Conference&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bt9m-bOSBa&amp;sig=z-_ExBGikhGMFVinlC2g1ovfSZA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiozNrKo-XTAhVEFMAKHcuzBwI4PBDoAQhEMAU#v=onepage&amp;q=EuroSTAR%20Conference&amp;f=false|title=Software Testing: A Guide to the TMap Approach|last=Pol|first=Martin|last2=Teunissen|first2=Ruud|last3=Veenendaal|first3=Erik van|date=2002-01-01|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=9780201745719|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=WnQM6rulf74C&amp;pg=PA76&amp;dq=EuroSTAR+Conference&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiNnPKdpeXTAhVMK8AKHW8QAnoQ6AEISjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=EuroSTAR%20Conference&amp;f=false|title=Formal Methods and Testing: An Outcome of the FORTEST Network.

The '''European Youth Capital''' (abbreviated '''EYC''') is the title awarded to a [[Europe]]an city for the period of one year, during which it is given the chance to showcase, through a multi-faceted programme, its youth-related cultural, social, political and economic life and development.&lt;ref name="EYC main"&gt;
{{Cite web|url=http://www.youthforum.org/CAPITAL/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=63&amp;Itemid=68 |title=ABOUT THE EYC |publisher=www.youthforum.org/CAPITAL |accessdate=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 
European Youth Capital is an initiative by the [[European Youth Forum]], and the first capital was chosen in 2009. Since 2014, the [[Congress of the Council of Europe|Congress of Local and Regional Authorities]] of the [[Council of Europe]] is an official endorsing partner the European Youth Capital title. The current, capital for the 2018 calendar year is [[Cascais]].

==Goals==
The European Youth Capital aims in promoting intra-European co-operation between young people. Among the most important aspects of the institution is the betterment of everyday life of the youth in the city selected as youth capital, not just for the duration of the festivities, but in the long term.&lt;ref name="EYC general information"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.youthforum.org/CAPITAL/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=73:about&amp;catid=35 |title=General Information |publisher=www.youthforum.org/CAPITAL |accessdate=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, participation of the youth in the design and implementation of the plans for each capital of youth is encouraged by the EYC.&lt;ref name="EYC general information" /&gt; Ensuring that the youth are informed and actively involved in society and given opportunities for a better future is also a priority for the EYC initiative.&lt;ref name="EYC main" /&gt; Tourism and increased international prestige are some of the additional benefits of being named European Youth Capital.&lt;ref name="EYC main" /&gt;

{{Campaignbox Expedition of the Thousand}}

The '''Expedition of the Thousand''' (Italian ''Spedizione dei Mille'') was an event of the Italian [[Risorgimento]] that took place in 1860. A corps of volunteers led by [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] sailed from Quarto, near [[Genoa]] (now [[Quarto dei Mille]]) and landed in [[Marsala]], [[Sicily]] in order to conquer the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]], ruled by the [[Spanish Bourbons]].

The project was an ambitious and risky venture aiming to conquer, with a thousand men, a kingdom with a larger regular army and a more powerful navy. The expedition was a success and concluded with a [[plebiscite]] that brought [[Naples]] and Sicily into the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]], the last territorial conquest before the creation of the [[Kingdom of Italy]] on 17 March 1861.

The sea venture was the only desired action that was jointly decided by the "four fathers of the nation" [[Giuseppe Mazzini]], Giuseppe Garibaldi, [[Victor Emmanuel II]], and [[Camillo Cavour]], pursuing divergent goals. However, the Expedition was instigated by [[Francesco Crispi]], who utilized his political influence to bolster the [[Italian unification]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[Christopher Duggan (historian)|Christopher Duggan]]|title=Creare la nazione. Vita di Francesco Crispi|publisher=Laterza|date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The various groups participated in the expedition for a variety of reasons: for Garibaldi, it was to achieve a united Italy; to the Sicilian bourgeoisie, an independent Sicily as part of the kingdom of Italy, and for common people, land distribution and the end of oppression.

==Background==
The events of the Expedition took place within the overall process of the [[Italian unification|unification of Italy]], which was largely orchestrated by [[Camillo Benso, conte di Cavour|Camillo Cavour]], Prime Minister of [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Sardinia-Piedmont]], as his life's work.  After the annexation of the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]], the Duchies of [[Duchy of Modena|Modena]] and [[Duchy of Parma|Parma]] and the [[Romagna]] to [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Piedmont]] in March 1860, Italian nationalists set their sights on the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, which comprised all of southern mainland Italy and Sicily, as the next step toward their dream of unification of all Italian lands.

In 1860 Garibaldi, already the most famous Italian revolutionary leader, was in [[Genoa]] planning an expedition against Sicily and Naples, with the covert support of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;Del Boca, ''Maledetti Savoia''&lt;/ref&gt;  Sicilian leaders, among them [[Francesco Crispi]], were discontented with Neapolitan rule over the island.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}  Moreover, Britain was worried by the approaches of the Neapolitans towards the [[Russian Empire]] in the latter's attempt to open its way to the [[Mediterranean Sea]]; the strategic importance of the Sicilian ports was also to be dramatically increased by the opening of the [[Suez Canal]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} It has been also suggested (by Lorenzo del Boca, among the others) that British support for Garibaldi's expedition was spurred by the necessity to obtain more favourable economic conditions for Sicilian [[sulphur|sulfur]], which was needed in great quantities for munitions. &lt;ref&gt;Lorenzo Del Boca, ''Maledetti Savoia'', see chapter ''Il copyright inglese''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Search for a casus belli===
The Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont needed a presentable [[casus belli]] in order to attack the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. This was needed for the House of Savoy, which however never gave any declaration of war against the Bourbon kingdom, a necessary condition, since this was among the requirements presented to Cavour. The only occurrence that would have satisfied this requirement was an uprising from within. Such an event would have felt the alienation of the people to the dynasty that ruled in Naples and, particularly, the inability of Francis of Bourbon, to ensure, in forms acceptable public policy in their domains. Sicily, as shown by the history of the past decades, was fertile ground, and the liberal south, especially those returning after an amnesty granted by the young King, who worked in this direction for some time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Interlanguage link multi|Gigi Di Fiore|it}}, ''I vinti del Risorgimento'', Utet, Torino, 2004, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Interlanguage link multi|Giacinto de' Sivo|it}}, ''Storia delle Due Sicilie 1847–1861'', Edizioni Trabant, 2009, p. 331.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Red Shirts===
In March 1860, exile Rosolino Pilo exhorted Giuseppe Garibaldi to take charge of an expedition to liberate [[Southern Italy]] from Bourbon rule.&lt;ref name=NBR/&gt; At first, Garibaldi was against it, but eventually agreed.&lt;ref name=NBR&gt;{{cite book|title=Risorgimento In Modern Italian Culture |first=Norma |last=Bouchard |year=2005 |place=Cranbury}}&lt;/ref&gt; By May 1860, Garibaldi had collected 1,089 volunteers for his expedition to Sicily.&lt;ref name=GMT&gt;{{cite book|title=Garibaldi and the Thousand |first=George Macaulay |last=Trevelyan |year=1912 |place=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest number of volunteers came from [[Lombardy]] (434 volunteers),&lt;ref name=LRS&gt;{{cite book|title=Garibaldi: Invention of a Hero |first=Lucy |last=Riall |year=2007 |place=Yale University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RRR/&gt; Other significant numbers of volunteers came from ''occupied'' [[Veneto|Venetia]] (194 volunteers),&lt;ref name=RRR&gt;{{cite book|title=Garibaldis "Zug der Tausend" in der Darstellung der deutschen Presse |first=Ronald |last=Richter |year=2011 |place=Frankfurt}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Genoa]] (156 volunteers),&lt;ref name=JSC&gt;{{cite book|title=The Conradian: Vol.32-33 |last=Joseph Conrad Society |year=2007 |place=United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tuscany]] (78 volunteers).&lt;ref name=RRR/&gt; There were about 45 Sicilian volunteers&lt;ref name=EOS&gt;{{cite book|title=Events in Sicily |first=Aldo |last=Gelso |year=2009 |place=USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 46 [[Kingdom of naples|Neapolitan]] volunteers—but only 11 from [[Rome]] and the [[Papal States]].&lt;ref name=JGR&gt;{{cite book|title=Garibaldi |first=Jasper Godwin |last=Ridley |year=1976 |place=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty three (33) foreigners joined the expedition,&lt;ref name=GMT/&gt; amongst them [[István Türr]] and three other [[Hungarians]] and fourteen (14) Italians from the [[Trentino]] of the [[Austrian Empire]].&lt;ref name=GMT/&gt; The majority of the volunteers were [[students]] and [[artisans]] from the lower classes.&lt;ref name=NBR/&gt;&lt;ref name=RRR/&gt;

The 1,089 volunteers were poorly armed with dated muskets&lt;ref name=GMT/&gt; and were dressed in a minimalist uniform—consisting of a red shirt and grey trousers.&lt;ref name=OWC&gt;{{cite book|title=Garibaldi and Italian unity |first=Osborne William |last=Chambers |year=1864 |place=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the night of 5 May, a small group led by [[Nino Bixio]] "seized" two steamships in [[Genoa]] from the Rubattino shipping company (which the ships were actually secretly granted by the company, but done in such approach to prevent taking any responsibility by [[plausible deniability]]) in order to transport the volunteers to Sicily. They took the two ships, which they had renamed ''Il Piemonte'' and ''Il Lombardo'', to the nearby rocks at [[Quarto dei Mille]], [[Genoa]], where the volunteers (including [[Francesco Crispi|Francesco Crispi's]] wife, Rosalia) embarked for Sicily.&lt;ref name=LRS/&gt;

===Landing in Sicily===
[[File:Francesco Crispi.jpg|thumb|[[Francesco Crispi]]]]
The ships landed at [[Marsala]], on the westernmost point of Sicily, on 11 May, with the help of British ships present in the harbour to deter the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] ships.&lt;ref&gt;These were: ''Stromboli'' (steam corvette), ''Valoroso'' (brigandine), ''Partenope'' (sail frigate) and the armed steamer ''Capri''. The British had the two gunboats ''Argus'' and ''Intrepid''.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Lombardo'' was attacked and sunk only after the disembarkation had been completed, while the ''Piemonte'' was captured. The landing had been preceded by the arrival of [[Francesco Crispi]] and others, who had the task of gaining the support of the locals for the volunteers.

On 14 May, at [[Salemi]], Garibaldi announced that he was assuming [[dictatorship of Garibaldi|dictatorship over Sicily]] in the name of King [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel II]] of Sardinia.

===Calatafimi and Palermo===
{{main article|Battle of Calatafimi}}
The ''Mille'' won a first battle at [[Battle of Calatafimi|Calatafimi]] against around 2,000 Neapolitan troops on 15 May. The battle boosted the morale of the ''Mille'' and, at the same time, depressed the Neapolitans, who were poorly led by their often corrupted higher officers, and started to feel themselves abandoned.  Having promised land to every male who volunteered to fight against the Bourbons the ranks of the ''Mille'' enlarged to 1,200 with local men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wZg4ecXXmNYC|title=Sicily and the Unification of Italy: Liberal Policy and Local Power, 1859-1866|last=Riall|first=Lucy|date=1998-03-12|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=|isbn=9780191542619|location=|pages=71|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 May, with the help of a popular insurrection, the ''Mille'' laid siege to [[Palermo]], the island's capital. The city was defended by some 16,000 men, but these were under the confused and timid direction of general [[Ferdinando Lanza]], aged 75 (probably one of the Neapolitan officers bribed with English money).{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

While two columns of Garibaldines attacked the perimeter, part of the population, strengthened by 2,000 prisoners liberated from the local jails, rose against the garrison. When his troops were driven back from most of their positions, Lanza ordered them to bombard the city for three days, causing the deaths of 600 civilians. By 28 May Garibaldi controlled much of the city and declared the Bourbon authority deposed. The following day a desperate Neapolitan counteroffensive was driven back, and Lanza asked for a truce. However, when a reinforcement party of well equipped and well trained troops arrived in the city, the situation became very serious for Garibaldi, who was saved only by Lanza's decision to surrender. Through the mediation of a British admiral, an armistice was signed and the Neapolitan fleet abandoned the port.

===Neapolitan retreat and Battle of Milazzo===
{{Main article|Battle of Milazzo (1860)}}
[[Image:Battle of Milazzo.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;[[Lithograph]] of Garibaldi and his [[Redshirts (Italy)|Red Shirts]] at the [[Battle of Milazzo (1860)|Battle of Milazzo]].]]

The Bourbon troops were ordered to retreat eastwards and evacuate the island. An insurrection that had broken out in [[Catania]] on 31 May, led by [[Nicola Fabrizi]], was crushed by the local garrison, but the order to leave for [[Messina]] meant that this Neapolitan tactical success would have no practical results.

At the time only [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]], [[Augusta, Sicily|Augusta]], [[Milazzo]] and [[Messina]] remained in royal hands in Sicily. In the meantime Garibaldi issued his first law. A levy failed to muster more than 20,000 troops, while the peasants, who hoped to an immediate relief from the grievous conditions to which they were forced by the landowners, revolted in several localities. At [[Bronte, Catania|Bronte]], on 4 August 1860, Garibaldi's friend [[Nino Bixio]] bloodily repressed one of these revolts with two battalions of Redshirts.

The pace of Garibaldi's victories had worried Cavour, who in early July sent him a proposal of immediate annexation of Sicily to Piedmont. Garibaldi, however, refused vehemently to allow such a move until the end of the war. Cavour's envoy, La Farina, was arrested and expelled from the island. He was replaced by the more malleable [[Agostino Depretis]], who gained Garibaldi's trust and was appointed as pro-dictator.

On 25 June 1860, King [[Francis II of the Two Sicilies]] had issued a constitution. However, this late attempt to conciliate his moderate subjects failed to rouse them to defend the regime, while liberals and revolutionaries were eager to welcome Garibaldi.

At the time, Garibaldi had created the ''Esercito Meridionale'' ("Southern Army"), reinforced by other volunteers from Italy and some regular Piedmontese soldiers disguised as "deserters". The Neapolitans had mustered some 24,000 men for the defence of Messina and the other fortresses.

On 20 July Garibaldi attacked Milazzo with 5,000 men. The Neapolitan defence was gallant, but again the absence of coordination and the refusal of Marshal Clary, commander-in-chief of the army in the island, to send reinforcements from Messina granted the Mille another victory. Six days later Clary surrendered the city of Messina to Garibaldi, leaving only 4,000 in the citadel and other forts. The other strongholds surrendered by the end of September.

===Landing and conquest in Calabria===
On 19 August Garibaldi's men disembarked in [[Calabria]], a move opposed by Cavour, who had written the Dictator a letter urging him to not cross the [[strait of Messina|strait]]. Garibaldi, however, disobeyed, an act which had the silent approval of King Victor Emmanuel.

The Bourbons had some 20,000 men in Calabria, but, apart from some episodes like that of [[Reggio Calabria]], which was conquered at high cost by Bixio on 21 August, they offered insignificant resistance, as numerous units of the Bourbon army disbanded spontaneously or even joined Garibaldi's ranks. On 30 August a conspicuous Sicilian army, led by general Ghio, was officially disbanded at [[Soveria Mannelli]], while only minor and dispersed units continued the fight. The Neapolitan fleet behaved in a similar way.

===The end===
{{Main article|Battle of Volturnus (1860)}}

King Francis II was thus forced to abandon [[Naples]] and entrench himself in the formidable fortress of [[Gaeta]], while a last stand was set up on the [[Volturno]] river, north of Naples. On 7 September Garibaldi took possession of Naples with little harm (he entered the city by train), hailed as a liberator by the population.

In the meantime the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] invaded the [[Papal States]] conquering [[Central Italy]] ([[Lazio]] excluded) through few battles such as the [[Battle of Castelfidardo]], and entered the [[Kingdom of Two Sicilies]] joining [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]].

In the indecisive [[Battle of the Volturnus (1860)|Battle of the Volturnus]] (1 and 2 October&lt;ref&gt;Effective date of the end of the fightings is debated.&lt;/ref&gt;), Garibaldi, with a force of 24,000 men, was not able to conclusively defeat the Neapolitan Army (about 25,000 men). Only the arrival of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Sardinian]] army obliged the last organized Bourbon force to entrench in Gaeta.

A few days later (21 October) a [[plebiscite]] confirmed the annexation of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies to the Kingdom of Sardinia by an overwhelming majority.

The end of the expedition is traditionally set with the famous meeting in [[Teano]]&lt;ref&gt;Other sources (including Del Boca) set the location of the meeting at {{Interlanguage link multi| Taverna della Catena|it}}, in territory of the modern ''[[comune]]'' of [[Vairano Patenora]].&lt;/ref&gt; (northern [[Campania]]) between Victor Emmanuel and Garibaldi (26 October 1860). Others assign instead the end of the campaign to the King's entrance into Naples on 7 November.

However, the military campaign was not yet fully completed, as Francis II [[Siege of Gaeta (1860)|held out in Gaeta]] until February of the next year, when he finally surrendered to the [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Sardinian]] army led by [[Enrico Cialdini]], and left for exile in the [[Papal States]]. Shortly thereafter, in March 1861, the new Kingdom of Italy (''Regno d'Italia'') was formally established.

Garibaldi asked the King to remain in the former Two Sicilies for a year as dictator. He also asked that his officers be integrated in the new Italian Army. When Victor Emmanuel refused to grant the dictator his request but agreed to integrate the men and officers, he returned to [[Caprera]].

==Legacy==
[[Image:Lmille.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Giuseppe Barboglio]], a '''[[Expedition of the Thousand#The Red Shirts|Red Shirt]]''' volunteer of the ''Thousand'', wearing the '''Marsala Medal''']]

The Expedition of the Thousand has traditionally been one of the most celebrated events of the [[Risorgimento|Italian Risorgimento]], the process of the unification of Italy.

In the following years, the rise of local resistance (the so-called ''[[Brigandage in Southern Italy after 1861|brigantaggio]]'' or brigandage), required at one point the presence of some 140,000 Piedmontese troops to maintain control of the former Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. Traditionally, the handling of the ''brigantaggio'' has received a negative judgement by Italian historians, in strict contrast with the heroism attributed to Garibaldi and his followers; the English historian [[Denis Mack Smith]],&lt;ref&gt;Denis Mack Smith, ''Italy and Its Monarchy''.&lt;/ref&gt; for example, points out the deficiencies and reticence of the sources available for the period 1861-1946,&lt;ref&gt;[[Denis Mack Smith]], ''I re d'Italia'', [[RCS MediaGroup|Rizzoli]], 1990&lt;/ref&gt; but the same historian also pointed out the backwardness of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies at the time of the unification.&lt;ref&gt;Italy: a modern history – Denis Mack Smith –University of Michigan – 1959 – page 3 [https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.185092/2015.185092.Italy-A-Modern-History#page/n13/mode/2up]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"This difference between North and South was fundamental. A peasant from Calabria had little in common with one from Piedmont, and Turin was infinitely more like Pans and London than Naples and Palermo, for these two halves were on quite different levels of civilization. Poets might write of the South as the garden of the world, the land of Sybaris and Capri, and stay-at-home politicians sometimes believed them; but in fact most southerners lived in squalor, afflicted by drought, malaria, and earthquakes. The Bourbon rulers of Naples and Sicily before 1860 had been staunch supporters of a feudal system glamorized by the trappings of a courtly and corrupt society. They had feared the traffic of ideas and had tried to keep their subjects insulated from the agricultural and industrial revolutions of northern Europe. Roads were scanty or nonexistent, and passports necessary even for internal travel. In the 'annus mirabilis' of 1860 these backward regions were conquered by Garibaldi and annexed by plebiscite to the North." —''Italy: a modern history'', Denis Mack Smith, page 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The expedition, moreover, obtained the support of the powerful great landowners of southern Italy in exchange for the promise that their properties be left intact in the upcoming political settlement. Numerous Sicilian peasants, however, had joined the Mille hoping instead for a redistribution of the land to the people working it. The consequences of this misunderstanding became evident at Bronte.

==History==

=== 1983–2011 ===
The Festival Fringe Society of Perth was established in 1983 and was the forerunner to the Fringe World Festival. The Society held an annual Fringe Festival up until 1988 at which time the organisation decided to move the Fringe from summer to spring and to re-brand it as Artrage, an annual festival dedicated to the presentation of alternative independent arts – a format that was followed until the organisation's 25th 'Silver' Festival Anniversary in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Silver Artrage Festival launches with a bang...and Burlesque!|url=http://www.australianstage.com.au/200809171883/news/perth/silver-artrage-festival-launches-with-a-bang...and-burlesque.html|accessdate=29 April 2015|publisher=Australian Stage|date=18 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after this time Artrage began consulting with stakeholders and the wider arts community in Perth around the idea of reintroducing a genuine independent 'fringe' to the Perth summer. This led to the presentation of a pilot Fringe program in February 2011, staged in the newly purchased De Parel Spiegeltent in the Perth Cultural Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Romaro|first1=Ashryn|url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/news/27002/Perth-Fringe-Festival-2011|accessdate=29 April 2015|publisher=Faster Louder|date=18 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pilot Festival featured 23 events at six venues and there were 12,000 tickets sold. The success of this pilot Festival gave Artrage the encouragement and confidence that there was enough appetite for a full Festival to be delivered the following year.

=== 2012 ===
The 2012 Festival was the first full Fringe World Festival, held from 26 January to 19 February. The Festival presented over 200 events running across 40 traditional and non-traditional venues in Perth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=First details revealed for Perth's Fringe World Festival in January 2012|url=http://www.theaureview.com/news/first-details-revealed-for-perths-fringe-world-festival-in-january-2012|accessdate=3 October 2013|newspaper=The AU Review|author=Mark Dragham}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free and ticketed attendance was over 150,000 and box office sales was over $1&amp;nbsp;million.

=== 2013 ===
The 2013 Festival extended one week more than in 2012 and was held from 25 January to 24 February.

The majority of events in the 2011–2013 Fringe World Festivals were held in Northbridge and the Perth CBD, but more specifically at several pop-up performance venues (including De Parel Spiegeltent) in the [[Perth Cultural Centre]].

=== 2014 ===
In 2014 Fringe World revealed that it would be expanding its presence in Northbridge with another site of venues to be held in [[Russell Square, Perth]], which would be transformed into The Pleasure Garden for the Festival's duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fringe adds second site for festival|url=https://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/-/wa/19769988/fringe-adds-second-site-for-festival/accessdate=2013-11-21|newspaper=The West Australian|date=11 November 2013|author=Holly Richards}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2014 Festival was held from 24 January to 23 February and featured 1,788 participating artists, 418 free and ticketed events, 80 venues, free and ticketed attendance of over 370,000 and box office sales of over $3.2million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bevis|first1=Stephen|title=Fringe makes big impact|url=https://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/entertainment/a/24669013/fringe-makes-big-impact/|accessdate=29 April 2015|publisher=The West Australian|date=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''GOES-T''' is the third of the next generation of weather satellites operated by the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA), giving sequence to the GOES system. The next satellites of the series ([[GOES-16]], [[GOES-17]], T, and [[GOES-U|U]]) will extend the availability of the [[Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite|GOES]] satellite system until 2036. The satellite will be built by [[Lockheed Martin]], it will be based on the [[Lockheed Martin A2100|A2100A]] platform and will an expected useful life of 15 years (10 operational after five years in orbit replacement).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goes-r.gov/mission/mission.html Mission overview]; GOES-R.

The '''Global Game Jam''' ('''GGJ''') is an annual distributed [[Game Jam|game jam]]. Inspired by the [[Nordic Game Jam]], and created by [[Susan Gold]], [[Ian Schreiber]],  [[Gorm Lai]] and [[Foaad Khosmood]], originally developed under the [[IGDA|International Game Developers Association]] Education SIG to bring together the elements of creativity, collaboration and experimentation. At each site, participants gather to develop ideas, form small groups, create new, creative, innovative games, and present them to their peers and the global community, all in a limited time span. As of 2013, GGJ is managed by Global Game Jam Incorporated.&lt;ref name="About"&gt;http://globalgamejam.org/about&lt;/ref&gt;. Current and past board directors include the founders [[Elonka Dunin]], [[Lindsay Grace]] and [[Zuraida Buter]]. In January 2018, GGJ generated teams in 803 sites in 108 countries, who over the course of one weekend created 8,606 games.&lt;ref&gt;https://globalgamejam.org/news/our-final-transmission-ggj18&lt;/ref&gt; The Global Game Jam carries a registered trademark.

== Participants ==

Participants in the Global Game Jam are of all skill levels and in various fields. Everyone from professional game developers to educators to artists and designers is welcome to participate.&lt;ref name = 'Kotaku_1'&gt;{{cite web|last1=Serrels|first1=Mark|title=Game Jam: Saving The Australian Games Industry In 48 Hours|url=http://www.kotaku.com.au/2011/02/game-jam-saving-the-australian-games-industry-in-48-hours|website=kotaku|accessdate=23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the jam begins, participants come up with game ideas, before pitching those ideas to each other and forming teams to work together on a project.&lt;ref name = 'FAQ'&gt;Basic Questions. http://www.globalgamejam.org/wiki/basic-questions#ggj Retrieved 2/14/2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Event organization ==

[[File:GGJ LA 2015.JPG|thumb|An image from the Global Game Jam in Los Angeles 2015]]
Groups wishing to host a jam site must fulfill certain requirements. Their location must have Internet access for everyone involved, access to development resources such as an [[Integrated development environment|IDE]], possibly preinstalled at the location, an event coordinator, beverages and nearby food access, round-the-clock availability of the location, and security for belongings.&lt;ref name = 'FAQ' /&gt;

At each site, the Global Game Jam runs continuously for 48 hours in each time zone, beginning at 5:00 PM on the start date, and ending at 5:00 PM two days later. The recommended schedule includes a short planning and team creation period, followed by development time until 3:00 PM on the final day. The last few hours are set aside for teams to present their creation to each other. However, sites are not required to follow this schedule.&lt;ref name = 'GGJ'&gt;http://globalgamejam.org&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the event participants are given a theme, such as “Extinction” in the 2011 Jam. Participants are asked to create a game that in some way relates to this theme. Additionally, participants are given a list of “achievements”, also referred to as diversifiers.&lt;ref name=ggj_diversifiers&gt;{{cite web |title=Global Game Jam Diversifiers |url=http://globalgamejam.org/global-game-jam-diversifiers |website=Official Global Game Jam Website |accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are designed to drive creative development by adding a unique or limiting factor to their a game’s design. Examples include “Both Hands Tied Behind My Back”, in which a game should be designed to be played without the player’s hands&lt;ref name=SG13_FDG&gt;{{cite conference |url=https://www.academia.edu/3435554/Promoting_Game_Accessibility_Experiencing_an_Induction_on_Inclusive_Design_Practice_at_the_Global_Games_Jam |title=Promoting Game Accessibility: Experiencing an Induction on Inclusive Design Practice at the Global Games Jam |first1=Michael |last1=Scott |first2=Gheorghita |last2=Ghinea |format=pdf |conference=Proceedings of the Inaugural Workshop on the Global Games Jam |publisher=Society for Advancing the Study of Digital Games |pages=17–20 |doi=10.13140/RG.2.1.5193.6481 |date=14 May 2013 |accessdate=January 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SG14_FIE&gt;{{cite conference |url=https://www.academia.edu/7260905/Promoting_Inclusive_Design_Practices_at_the_Global_Game_Jam_A_Pilot_Evaluation |title=Promoting Inclusive Design Practices at the Global Game Jam: A Pilot Evaluation |first1=Michael |last1=Scott |first2=Gheorghita |last2=Ghinea |format=pdf |conference=Proceedings of the 2014 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference |publisher=IEEE |pages=1–4 |doi=10.1109/FIE.2014.7044162 |date=22 October 2014 |accessdate=January 1, 2016|arxiv=1409.5260 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, or “Picasso Lives”, in which game art must be [[Cubism|cubist]] in style.&lt;ref name=ggj_diversifiers /&gt;

&lt;!-- Bolding not necessary per [[WP:SBE]] !--&gt;An [[insurgency]] began in [[Iraq]] after the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|2003 US-led invasion]], and lasted throughout the ensuing [[Iraq War]] (2003–2011).
The [[Iraqi insurgency (2003–06)|first phase of the insurgency]] began shortly after the 2003 invasion and prior to the establishment of the new Iraqi government. From around 2004 to May 2007, the insurgency primarily targeted the [[Multi-National Force – Iraq]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meeting Resistance: New Doc Follows Iraqis Fighting U.S. Occupation of Their Country |publisher=Democracy Now! |url=http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=07/10/18/1419205 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113204643/http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=07%2F10%2F18%2F1419205 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=13 November 2007 |accessdate=1 August 2008 |df= }} "Know Thine Enemy" | New York Times |21 October 2007 "Meeting Resistance is directed by journalists Molly Bingham and Steve Connors. In a video op-ed for the New York Times, they cite Pentagon reports between 2004 and '07 to claim 74% of attacks by Iraqi insurgents target American-led occupation forces. They also cite a recent BBC/ABC poll which found 100% of Iraqis polled disapproved of attacks on Iraqi civilians."&lt;/ref&gt; while latterly, [[Iraqi security forces]], seen, by Iraqi insurgents, as [[Collaborationism|collaborators]] with the coalition, were also targeted.

With the full-scale eruption of the [[Sectarian violence in Iraq (2006–07)|sectarian civil war]] in February 2006, many militant attacks in American-controlled central Iraq were directed at the [[Iraqi police]] and [[new Iraqi Army|military forces]] of the [[Al Maliki I Government|Iraqi government]]. The attacks continued during the transitional [[reconstruction of Iraq]], as the Iraqi government tried to establish itself. Civil war violence decreased in late 2008 and the insurgency continued through the [[Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq|American withdrawal]] from Iraq in 2011. After the withdrawal in December 2011, [[Iraqi insurgency (2011–13)|a renewed wave of sectarian and anti-government insurgency]] swept Iraq, causing thousands of casualties in 2012. Increasing violence in 2013 raised fears of another civil war.

The insurgents in Iraq have been composed of a [[Private militias in Iraq|diverse mix of militias]], foreign fighters, all-Iraqi units or mixtures opposing the American-led Multi-National Force – Iraq and the post-2003 [[Iraqi government]]. During the height of the Iraq War in 2006 to 2008, the fighting involved both armed conflict against the American-led military coalition, as well as [[Sectarian violence in Iraq|sectarian violence]] among the different ethnic groups within the population. The insurgents were involved in [[asymmetric warfare]] and a [[attrition warfare|war of attrition]] against the American-supported Iraqi government and American forces in central Iraq, while conducting coercive tactics against rivals or other militias. Iraq's deep sectarian divides have been a major dynamic in the insurgency, with support for the insurgents varying among different segments of the population.

==Background==
{{main|2003 invasion of Iraq}}
The [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] (19 March – 1 May 2003) began the [[Iraq War]], or ''Operation Iraqi Freedom'', in which a combined force of troops from the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and [[Poland]] invaded Iraq and toppled the government of [[Saddam Hussein]] within 21 days of major combat operations. The invasion phase consisted of a conventionally fought war which concluded with the capture of the Iraq capital [[Baghdad]] by U.S. forces.

Four countries participated with troops during the initial invasion phase, which lasted from 19 March to 9 April 2003. These were the United States (148,000), United Kingdom (45,000), Australia (2,000), and Poland (194). [[Multi-National Force – Iraq|Thirty-six other countries]] were involved in its aftermath. In preparation for the invasion, 100,000 U.S. troops were assembled in [[Kuwait]] by 18 February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/02/18/sprj.irq.deployment/index.html|title=U.S. has 100,000 troops in Kuwait | work=CNN | date=18 February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States supplied the majority of the invading forces, but also received support from [[Peshmerga|Kurdish irregulars]] in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]].

The invasion was preceded by an [[air strike]] on the Presidential Palace in Baghdad on 19 March 2003. The following day coalition forces launched an incursion into [[Basra Province]] from their massing point close to the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border. While the special forces launched an amphibious assault from the [[Persian Gulf]] to secure [[Basra]] and the surrounding petroleum fields, the main invasion army moved into southern Iraq, occupying the region and engaging in the [[Battle of Nasiriyah]] on 23 March. Massive air strikes across the country and against Iraqi command and control threw the defending army into chaos and prevented an effective resistance. On 26 March the [[173rd Airborne Brigade]] was [[Operation Northern Delay|airdropped]] near the northern city of [[Kirkuk]] where they joined forces with [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] rebels and fought several actions against the [[Iraqi army]] to secure the northern part of the country.

The main body of coalition forces continued their drive into the heart of Iraq and met with little resistance. Most of the Iraqi military was quickly defeated and Baghdad was occupied on 9 April. Other operations occurred against pockets of the Iraqi army including the capture and occupation of Kirkuk on 10 April, and the attack and capture of [[Tikrit]] on 15 April. [[Iraqi President]] Saddam Hussein and the central leadership went into hiding as the coalition forces completed the occupation of the country.

On 1 May, an end of major combat operations was declared, ending the invasion stage of the Iraq War and beginning the [[military occupation]] period and the Iraqi insurgency against coalition forces.

===First phase of insurgency (2003–06)===
{{main|Iraqi insurgency (2003–06)}}
[[File:TallAfar.jpg|thumb|U.S. Army [[M1A2 Abrams]] tanks patrol the streets of Tal Afar, Iraq in February 2005.]]
The Iraqi insurgency of 2003–06 erupted following the invasion of Iraq and the toppling of Saddam Hussein's rule in May 2003. The armed insurgent opposition to the United States-led [[Multi-National Force – Iraq|multinational force in Iraq]] and the post-2003 Iraqi government lasted until early 2006, when it deteriorated into a sectarian civil war, the most violent phase of the Iraq War.

===Sectarian civil war (2006–2008)===
{{main|Sectarian violence in Iraq (2006–08)}}
Following the U.S.-launched 2003 invasion of Iraq, the situation deteriorated, and by 2007, the [[communal violence|intercommunal violence]] between Iraqi [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] and [[Shi'a Islam|Shi'a]] factions was described by the [[National Intelligence Estimate]] as having elements of a civil war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Elements of 'civil war' in Iraq|quote=A US intelligence assessment on Iraq says "civil war" accurately describes certain aspects of the conflict, including intense sectarian violence.|date=2 February 2007|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/world/middle_east/6324767.stm|journal=[[BBC News]] | accessdate=2 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 10 January 2007 address to the American people, President [[George W.

In October 2006, the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR) and the [[Politics of Iraq|Iraqi government]] estimated that more than 370,000 Iraqis had been displaced since the 2006 [[al-Askari Mosque bombing (2006)|bombing]] of the [[al-Askari Mosque]], bringing the total number of Iraqi [[refugee]]s to more than 1.6&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/news/NEWS/452fa9954.html|title=UNHCR – UNHCR worried about effect of dire security situation on Iraq's displaced|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|work=UNHCR}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2008, the UNHCR raised the estimate of refugees to a total of about 4.7&amp;nbsp;million (~16% of the population). The number of refugees estimated abroad was 2 million (a number close to CIA projections&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/iz.html|title=The World Factbook|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and the number of internally displaced people was 2.7&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=UNHCR-04084&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/iraq?page=briefing&amp;id=4816ef534 UNHCR – Iraq: Latest return survey shows few intending to go home soon].

==Conflict parties==
The Iraqi [[insurgency]] is composed of at least a dozen major organizations and perhaps as many as 40 distinct groups. These groups are subdivided into countless smaller [[covert cell|cells]]. The Washington-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) estimates that less than 10% of insurgents are non-Iraqi foreign fighters.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|first1=Brian|last1=Whitaker|first2=Ewen|last2=MacAskill|title=Report attacks 'myth' of foreign fighters|work=The Guardian|date=23 September 2005|url=https://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1576666,00.html|accessdate=21 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Chief of the British General Staff, General Sir [[Richard Dannatt, Baron Dannatt|Richard Dannatt]], speaking in September 2007,

[[File:Deadliest Roadside Bombing.jpg|thumb|below|A roadside bombing in Iraq on 3 August 2005]]
Because of its clandestine nature, the exact composition of the Iraqi insurgency is difficult to determine, but the main groupings are:
* [[Ba'athism|Ba'athists]], the supporters of [[Saddam Hussein]]'s former administration including army or intelligence officers, whose ideology is a variant of [[Pan-Arabism]].
* [[Iraqi nationalism|Iraqi nationalists]], Iraqis who believe in a strong version of Iraqi [[self-determination]]. These policies may not necessarily espouse a [[Pan-Arab]] ideology, but rather advocate the country's [[territorial integrity]] including [[Kuwait]] and [[Khūzestān Province|Khuzestan]]. Historical figures of this movement include the pre-Ba'athist leader of Iraq [[Abd al-Karim Qasim]] and his government.
* Iraqi [[Salafi]] [[Islamism|Islamists]], the indigenous armed followers of the Salafi movement, as well as any remnants of the [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] [[Ansar al-Islam]]: individuals with a Salafi-only policy opposed to non-Salafis though not aligned to one specific ethnic group. Though opposed to the U.S.-led invasion, these groups are not wholly sympathetic towards the former Ba'ath Party as its members included non-Salafis.
* [[Shi'a]] militias, including the southern, [[Iran]]-linked [[Badr Organization]], the [[Mahdi Army]], and the central-Iraq followers of [[Muqtada al-Sadr]]. These groups neither advocate the dominance of a single ethnic group, nor the traditional ideologies behind the Iraqi state (e.g. these particular Shi'as do not support the capture of Khuzestan or other border areas with Iran, but rather promote warm relations with Iran's Shi'a government).
* Foreign Islamist volunteers, including those often linked to [[al Qaeda]] and largely driven by the Salafi/Wahhabi doctrine (the two preceding categories are often lumped as "[[jihad]]ists");
* Possibly some socialist revolutionaries (such as the [[Iraqi Armed Revolutionary Resistance]], which claimed one attack in 2007).
* [[Non-violent resistance]] groups and political parties (not part of the armed insurgency).

===Arab Nationalist===

====Ba'athists====
{{further|Ba'ath Party (Iraqi-dominated faction)|Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Iraq Region}}
[[File:Flag of the Ba'ath Party.svg|thumb|[[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Iraq Region|Ba'ath Party]] flag]]
The Ba'athists include former [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Iraq Region|Ba'ath Party]] officials, the [[Fedayeen Saddam]], and some former agents of the Iraqi intelligence elements and security services, such as the [[Iraqi Intelligence Service|Mukhabarat]] and the [[Special Security Organization]]. Their goal, at least before the capture of Saddam Hussein, was the restoration of the former Ba'athist government to power. The pre-war organization of the Ba'ath Party and its militias as a cellular{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} structure aided the continued pro-Saddam resistance after the fall of Baghdad, and Iraqi intelligence operatives may have developed a plan for [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]] following the toppling of Saddam Hussein from power.

Following Saddam's capture, the Ba'athist movement largely faded; its surviving factions were increasingly shifting to either nationalist factions (Iraqi, though not Pan-Arab, such as the ideology of the pre-Ba'athist regime), or Islamist (Sunni or Shia, depending on the actual faith of the individual, though Ba'ath Party policy had been secular, and many of its members were atheist).

As the goal of restoring the Ba'ath Party to power was seemingly out of reach, the alternative solution appeared to be to join forces with organisations who opposed the U.S.-led invasion. Many former Ba'athists had adopted an [[Islamist]] façade to attract more credibility within the country, and perhaps gain support from outside Iraq. Others, especially following the January 2005 elections, became more interested in politics.
&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:Fedayeen-Saddam.jpg|thumb|Fedayeen Saddam, irregular soldiers loyal to the former Iraqi Ba'athist regime.]] --&gt;

The fall of Baghdad effectively ended the existence of the [[Fedayeen Saddam]] as an organized paramilitary. Several of its members died during the war. A large number survived, however, and were willing to carry on the fight even after the fall of Saddam Hussein from power. Many former members joined guerrilla organizations that began to form to resist the U.S-led coalition in Iraq. By June, an insurgency was underway in central and northern Iraq, especially in an area known as the [[Sunni Triangle]]. Some units of the Fedayeen also continued to operate independently of other insurgent organizations in the Sunni areas of Iraq. On 30 November 2003, a U.S. convoy traveling through the town of [[Samarra]] in the [[Sunni Triangle]] was ambushed by over 100 Iraqi guerillas, reportedly wearing trademark Fedayeen Saddam uniforms.

Following the execution of [[Saddam Hussein]], Deputy Leader of the Iraqi-cell of the [[Ba'ath Party (Iraqi-led faction)|Iraqi-led Ba'ath Party]] and former Vice President of Iraq [[Izzat Ibrahim ad-Douri]] became a leading candidate to succeed him as Leader of the Iraqi Ba'ath Party. Ad-Douri had taken over the running of the Iraqi Ba'ath Party following Saddam Hussein's capture in 2003 and had been endorsed by a previously unknown group calling itself [[Baghdad Citizens Gathering]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070102091923/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/12/31/africa/ME_GEN_Jordan_Saddam_Execution.php A group of Iraqi Ba'athists pledges allegiance to Saddam's fugitive deputy, naming him leader] ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'', 31 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1167467631042&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |title=Jordan Baathists pledge loyalty to Saddam deputy |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917213547/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1167467631042&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull |archivedate=17 September 2011 |publisher=''[[Jerusalem Post]]'' |date=31 January 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 January 2007 the website of the banned Iraqi Ba'ath Party confirmed that he was new leader of the party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6226977.stm Saddam aide is new Ba'ath leader] [[BBC News]], 3 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-28895025_ITM|title=Wanted: the iceman: the last of Saddam's inner circle still at liberty continues to taunt his would-be captors with frequent sightings and leads a ruthless band of Ba'athist insurgents|work=Access My Library|date=1 December 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070109072329/http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-28895025_ITM|archivedate=9 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their reasons for opposing the Coalition vary from a rejection of the Coalition presence as a matter of principle to the failure of the multinational forces to fully restore [[public services]] and to quickly restore complete [[sovereignty]].

One notable leader of the insurgency among nationalist Sunni is former aide to Saddam Hussein and a former [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Iraq Region|regional Ba'ath Party]] Organiser [[Mohammed Younis al-Ahmed al-Muwali]] who has been crossing the border between Iraq and Syria disbursing funds, smuggling weaponry and organising much of the fighting in the central area of Iraq.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

One former minister in the interim government, [[Aiham Alsammarae|Ayham al-Samarai]], announced the launch in 2005 of "a new political movement, saying he aimed to give a voice to figures from the legitimate Iraqi resistance. 'The birth of this political bloc is to silence the skeptics who say there is no legitimate Iraqi resistance and that they cannot reveal their political face,' he told a news conference."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aljazeerah.info/News%20archives/2005%20News%20Archives/June/29%20n/Iraqis%20Unhappy%20with%20the%20Bush%20vow%20to%20stay%20on.htm Iraqis Unhappy with the Bush vow to stay on]. aljazeerah.info News archives {{Dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear what became of this movement.

===Sunni Militias===
Examples of Sunni Islamist groups include [[Mujahideen Shura Council (Iraq)|Mujahideen Shura Council]], the [[Islamic Army in Iraq]], [[al-Qaeda in Iraq]], the [[United Jihad Factions Council]] and [[Jaish al-Rashideen]]. The [[Army of the Men of the Naqshbandi Order]] are also a Sunni/Sufi Islamist organisation but are also Iraqi and Arab Nationalist in orientation.

Hard-line clerics and remaining underground cells of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] in Iraq have helped provide support for the indigenous [[Insurgent|militant]] [[Islamist]] movement.&lt;ref name="MBI"&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iraq/iip.htm |title=Iraqi Islamic Party |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date= |accessdate=26 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supportive of this strand is the founder of the ultra-conservative and Wahabbi [[Association of Muslim Scholars]], Sheikh [[Hareth Al-Dhari]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

===Shia Militias===
The Shia militias have presented [[Nouri al-Maliki]] with perhaps the greatest conundrum of his administration given [[Mahdi Army#October 2006 battle|the capture]] of [[Amarah]]. American officials have pressed him hard to disarm the militias and rid the state security forces of their influence.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes-10-20&gt;{{cite news|title=Attack on Iraqi City Shows Militia's Power|date=20 October 2006|publisher=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/20/world/middleeast/21iraqcnd.html?ex=1318996800&amp;en=a542d37a1dff56f9&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss | first=Kirk | last=Semple | accessdate=27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Badr Organization====
One major Shia militia in Iraq is the [[Badr Organization]], the military wing of the [[Supreme Islamic Council of Iraq]]. The group is currently based in [[Karbala, Iraq]], and is also active in areas throughout southern Iraq. The group was formed by the Iranian Government to fight the Saddam Hussein-controlled Iraq during the [[Iran–Iraq War]]. Originally, the group consisted of Iraqi exiles who were banished from Iraq during the reign of Saddam Hussein. After the war ended in 1988, the organization remained in Iran until Saddam Hussein was overthrown during the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. Following the invasion, the brigade then moved into Iraq, became members of the new Iraq Army, and aided coalition forces in insurgents.

Colonel Derek Harvey told Reuters "that the U.S. military detained Badr assassination teams possessing target lists of Sunni officers and pilots in 2003 and 2004 but did not hold them. Harvey said his superiors told him that 'this stuff had to play itself out' – implying that revenge attacks by returning Shi'ite groups were to be expected. He also said Badr and ISCI offered intelligence and advice to U.S. officials on how to navigate Iraqi politics."&lt;ref&gt;Ned Parker, [https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/mideast-crisis-iraq-militias/ "Torture by Iraqi militias: The report Washington did not want you to see"] Reuters, Dec 14, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter published by the Coalition in February 2004, an insurgent believed to be Zarqawi wrote that jihadis should start an open sectarian war so that Sunnis would mobilize against what would otherwise be a secret war being waged by Shia. The author only specifically pointed to assassinations carried out by the Badr Brigade as an example of this secret war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://2001-2009.state.gov/p/nea/rls/31694.htm "Zarqawi Letter"] State Dept. archives&lt;/ref&gt;

Jerry Burke, an adviser to the Iraqi Interior Ministry, told Musings on Iraq that his plan to surveil and stop suspected Badr Brigade death squads in the special police forces was rejected when it got to an American Flag (General) Officer.&lt;ref&gt;Joel Wing, [http://musingsoniraq.blogspot.com/2012/02/from-bad-to-worse-how-militias-moved.html "Part two of an interview with Jerry Burke] ''Musings on Iraq'', Feb 13, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2005, the group and their leaders in the Supreme Islamic Council of Iraq participated in [[Iraqi legislative election, December 2005|parliament elections]], under the pro-Shiite coalition known as the [[United Iraqi Alliance]], and managed to get 36 members into the Iraqi Parliament.

The Badr organization supports the government of Nouri Al-Maliki.

====Muqtada al-Sadr====
Supporters of the young Shi'a [[cleric]] [[Muqtada al-Sadr]] are largely impoverished men from the Shi'a urban areas and slums in Baghdad and the southern Shi'a cities.&lt;ref name=al-Sadr_supporter_demographics&gt;{{cite news |first=Jack |last=Fairweather |title=Sadr City slum divided over firebrand cleric as calm returns |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/04/14/wirq214.xml |work=Telegraph.co.uk |publisher=Telegraph Group|date=14 April 2004 |accessdate=6 October 2006 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mahdi Army]] area of operation stretches from [[Basra]] in the south to the [[Sadr City]] section of [[Baghdad]] in central Iraq (some scattered Shi'a militia activity has also been reported in [[Baquba]] and [[Kirkuk]], where Shi'a minorities exist).{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

During his group's active militant phase, Al-Sadr enjoyed wide support from the Iraqi people according to some polls. A poll by the [[Iraq Center for Research and Studies]] found that 32% of Iraqis "strongly supported" him and another 36% "somewhat supported" him, making him the second most popular man in Iraq, behind only Ayatollah Ali Al-Sistani.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} The Mahdi Army is believed to have around 60,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=View all comments that have been posted about this article. |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/10/AR2007011002581_pf.html |title=Intensified Combat on Streets Likely |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=11 January 2007 |accessdate=26 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nasrawi |first=Salah |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/iraq/2003467318_iraqsaudi08.html |title=The Seattle Times: Iraq: Saudis reportedly funding insurgents |publisher=Seattletimes.nwsource.com |date=8 December 2006 |accessdate=26 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the December 2005 elections in Iraq, Al-Sadr's party got 32 new seats giving him substantial political power in the divided Iraqi Parliament. In January 2006, he used these seats to swing the vote for prime minister to [[Ibrahim Al-Jaafari]], giving Al-Sadr a legitimate stake in the new Iraqi government and allying Al-Jaafari with the cleric.

On 27 November 2006, a senior American intelligence official told reporters that the Iranian-backed group [[Hezbollah]] had been training members of the [[Mahdi Army]]. The official said that 1,000 to 2,000 fighters from the Mahdi Army and other Shia militias had been trained by Hezbollah in [[Lebanon]], and a small number of Hezbollah operatives have also visited Iraq to help with training.  [[Iran]] has facilitated the link between Hezbollah and the Shia militias in Iraq, the official said.  "There seems to have been a strategic decision taken sometime over late winter or early spring by [[Damascus]], [[Tehran]], along with their partners in ait Lebanese Hezbollah, to provide more support to Sadr to increase pressure on the U.S.," the American intelligence official said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/28/world/middleeast/28military.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin |title=Hezbollah Said to Help Shia Army in Iraq |author1=Michael R.

===Foreign participants===
When [[Operation Red Dawn|Saddam Hussein was captured]] in December 2003, several documents were found in his possession. One particular document, which was apparently written after he lost power, appeared to be a directive to his Ba'athist loyalists warning them to be wary of [[Islamist]] [[mujahideen]] and other foreign Arabs entering the country to join the insurgency. The directive supposedly shows Saddam having concerns that foreign fighters would not share the same objectives as Ba'ath loyalists (i.e. the eventual return of Saddam to power and the restoration of his regime). A U.S. official commenting on the document stressed that while Saddam urged his followers to be cautious in their dealings with other Arab fighters, he did not order them to avoid contact or rule out co-operation.  [[Bruce Hoffman]], a Washington counter-terrorism expert stated that the existence of the document underscores the fact that "this is an insurgency cut of many different cloths...[and] everybody's jockeying for their position of power in the future Iraq."  Many experts believe that fighters from other countries who have flocked to Iraq to join the insurgents are motivated by animosity toward the United States and the desire to install an Islamic state in place of the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Iraq Region|Ba'ath Party]]'s secular [[regime]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/01/15/1073877963219.html Saddam warning on Islamist forces], ''[[The Age]]'', 16 January 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign fighters are mostly Arabs from neighboring countries, who have entered Iraq, primarily through the porous desert borders of Syria and Saudi Arabia, to assist the Iraqi insurgency. Many of these fighters are [[Wahhabism|Wahhabi]] fundamentalists who see Iraq as the new "field of [[jihad]]" in the battle against U.S. forces. It is generally believed that most are freelance fighters, but a few members of [[Al-Qaeda]] and the related group [[Ansar al-Islam]] are suspected of infiltrating into the Sunni areas of Iraq through the mountainous northeastern border with [[Iran]]. The United States and its allies point to Jordanian-born Al-Qaeda in Iraq leader [[Abu&amp;nbsp;Musab&amp;nbsp;al-Zarqawi]] as the key player in this group. Zarqawi was considered the head of an insurgent group called [[Al-Tawhid Wal-Jihad]] ("Monotheism and Holy War") until his death on 7 June 2006, which according to U.S. estimates numbers in the low hundreds.

Usage of the term "foreign fighters" has received criticism as being Western-centric because, taken literally, the term would encompass all non-Iraqi forces, including Coalition forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.countercurrents.org/iraq-fisk301003.htm "This is a Resistance Movement, Whether We Like It or Not"] by Robert Fisk. Democracy Now, 30 October 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Zarqawi has taken to taunting the American forces about the irony of the term: "Who is the foreigner, O cross worshippers? You are the ones who came to the land of the Muslims from your distant corrupt land." (Communiqué of 10 May 2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalterroralert.com/pdf/0505/zarqawi0505-11.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050929211423/http://www.globalterroralert.com/pdf/0505/zarqawi0505-11.pdf |archivedate=29 September 2005 |title=Communiqué from "Al-Qaida's Jihad Committee in Mesopotamia" (Abu Musab al-Zarqawi)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zarqawi's group has since announced the formation of the Ansar platoon, a squad of Iraqi suicide bombers, which an AP writer called "an apparent bid to deflect criticism that most suicide bombers in Iraq are foreigners."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,160247,00.html Al Qaeda in Iraq to Recruit Locals for Attacks], [[Fox news]], 21 June 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

While it is not known how many of those fighting the U.S. forces in Iraq are from outside the country, it is generally agreed that foreign fighters make up a very small percentage of the insurgency. [[Major General]] [[Joseph Taluto]], head of the [[42nd Infantry Division (United States)|42nd Infantry Division]], said that "99.9 per cent" of captured Insurgents are Iraqi.&lt;ref&gt;Phil Sands, [http://archive.gulfnews.com/articles/05/06/09/168406.html 'Good and honest' Iraqis fighting US forces] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061013015804/http://archive.gulfnews.com/articles/05/06/09/168406.html |date=13 October 2006 }} 6 September 2005, 06:25 (UAE)&lt;/ref&gt; The estimate has been confirmed by the Pentagon's own figures; in one analysis of over 1000 insurgents captured in Fallujah, only 15 were non-Iraqi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/FK20Ak03.html "The Sunni-Shi'ite power play"], [[Pepe Escobar]], ''Asian Times'', 20 November 2004&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', information from military commanders engaging in battles around Ramadi exposed the fact that out of 1300 suspected insurgents arrested in five months of 2005, none were foreign, although [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[John Gronski]] stated that foreigners provided money and logistical support: "The foreign fighters are staying north of the [Euphrates] river, training and advising, like the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviets]] were doing in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/12/04/wirq04.xml&amp;sSheet=/portal/2005/12/04/ixportal.html " US Army admits Iraqis outnumber foreign fighters as its main enemy"] Telegraph 3 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2006, the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' reported, "It's true that foreign fighters are in Iraq, such as [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]]. But they are a small minority of the insurgents, say administration critics. Most Iraqi mujahideen are Sunnis who fear their interests will be ignored under Iraq's Shia-dominated government. They are fighting for concrete, local political goals – not the destruction of America."  The paper quoted University of Michigan history professor [[Juan Cole]]: "If the Iraqi Sunni nationalists could take over their own territory, they would not put up with the few hundred foreign volunteers blowing things up, and would send them away or slit their throats."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Grier, "Is war in Iraq a shield against attacks at home?" ''Christian Science Monitor'' (18 September 2006) p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the Washington-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) concluded that foreign fighters accounted for less than 10% of the estimated 30,000 insurgents and argued that the U.S. and Iraqi Governments were "feeding the myth" that they comprised the backbone of the insurgency.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"/&gt;

Despite the low numbers of foreign fighters their presence has been confirmed in several ways and Coalition forces believe the majority of suicide bombings are believed to be carried out by non-Iraqi foreigners.  [[Kenneth Katzman]], a Middle East expert with the [[Congressional Research Service]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecssr.ac.ae/CDA/en/ProfileBank/ViewProfile/0,1421,1250-00,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080428105410/http://www.ecssr.ac.ae/CDA/en/ProfileBank/ViewProfile/0%2C1421%2C1250-00%2C00.html |archivedate=28 April 2008 |title=View Profile |publisher=ECSSR |date= |accessdate=26 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; stated in June 2005: "I still think 80 percent of the Insurgents, the day to day activity, is Iraqi – the roadside bombings, mortars, direct weapons fire, rifle fire, automatic weapons fire...[but] the foreign fighters attract the headlines with the suicide bombings, no question."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/w-me/2005/jun/30/063006836.html |title=Foreigners Blamed for Iraq Suicide Attacks |publisher=''Las Vegas Sun'' |date=30 June 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930030154/http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/w-me/2005/jun/30/063006836.html |archivedate=30 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2005, Iraqi and U.S. forces conducted a counter-insurgency operation in the predominantly [[Iraqi Turkmen|Turkmen]] town of [[Tal Afar]]. According to an [[Associated Press|AP]], report, an Iraqi Army Captain claimed that Iraqi forces arrested 150 non-Iraqi Arabs (Syria, Sudan, Yemen and Jordan) in the operation;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/9173345/from/RL.1/ |title=AP report |publisher=MSNBC |date=8 September 2005 |accessdate=26 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the American army claimed 20% of arrests were foreign combatants,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2005/09/mil-050911-rferl03.htm "Iraq: Operation In Tal Afar A Success, But For How Long?"], Radio Free Iraq&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Donald Rumsfeld]] on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] confirmed that foreign combatants were present.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051225211747/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/middle_east/july-dec05/iraq_9-21.html "Violence Escalates In Iraq"], PBS, 21 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all accounts of the battle mention these arrests,&lt;ref&gt;For example, this [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/10/AR2005091001308_pf.html Washington Post report] doesn't, although, this [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/02/AR2005090202250.html Washington Post report] refers to foreign fighters amongst the insurgents in Tal Afar.&lt;/ref&gt; and U.S. Army commander Colonel [[H. R. McMaster]] said the "vast majority" of Insurgents captured there were "Iraqis and not foreigners."&lt;ref name="english.aljazeera.net"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/FFFE08A7-D75C-45F5-AB51-206EA2D48668.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051219024830/http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/FFFE08A7-D75C-45F5-AB51-206EA2D48668.htm |archivedate=19 December 2005 |title=Iraqi troops sweep through Tal Afar |date=11 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iraqi journalist Nasir Ali claimed that there were "very few foreign combatants" in Tal Afar and charged "Every time the US army and the Iraqi government want to destroy a specific city, they claim it hosts Arab fighters and Abu Musab al-Zarqawi."&lt;ref name="english.aljazeera.net"/&gt;

There are allegations that the U.S. government has attempted to inflate the number of foreign fighters in order to advance the theory that the insurgency is not a local movement.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} U.S. Army Specialist Tony Lagouranis spoke about his job identifying many of the bodies after the assault on [[U.S. occupation of Fallujah|Fallujah]]:

====Foreign fighter nationality distribution====
In July 2007, the [[Los Angeles Times]] reported that 45% of all foreign militants targeting U.S. troops and Iraqi civilians and security forces are from Saudi Arabia; 15% are from Syria and Lebanon; and 10% are from North Africa. 50% of all Saudi fighters in Iraq come as suicide bombers. In the six months preceding that article, such bombings have killed or injured 4,000 Iraqis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fairuse.100webcustomers.com/fairenough/latimesA98.html|title=Saudis' role in Iraq insurgency outlined|publisher=[[LATimes]]|date=July 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223180041/http://fairuse.100webcustomers.com/fairenough/latimesA98.html |archivedate=23 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Abu Musab al-Zarqawi====
{{Further|Al-Qaeda in Iraq}}
The extent of Zarqawi's influence is a source of much controversy. Zarqawi was reported killed in action in March 2004 in "a statement signed by a dozen alleged insurgent groups".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Joel Roberts |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/03/05/iraq/main604191.shtml |title=Rebels: Top Iraq Terrorist Dead, Statement Says Al-Zarqawi Not Behind Recent Bombings Or Letter |publisher=CBS News |date=4 March 2004 |accessdate=26 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001021221/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/03/05/iraq/main604191.shtml |archivedate=1 October 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His Jordanian family then held a funeral service on his behalf, although no body was recovered and positively identified. Iraqi leaders denied the presence of Zarqawi in Fallujah prior to the U.S. attack on that city in November 2004. Zarqawi's existence was even questioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/FJ15Ak02.html |title=Asia Times – Asia's most trusted news source for the Middle East |publisher=Atimes.com |date=15 October 2004 |accessdate=26 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Involvement of Zarqawi in significant terrorist incidents was not usually proven, although his group often claimed it perpetrated bombings. As al-Qaeda is an "opt-in" group (meaning everyone who agrees to some basic Wahhabi moral tenets and the fundamental goals may consider himself a member), it is most likely that "Al-Qaeda in Iraq" is a loose association of largely independent cells united by a common strategy and vision, rather than a unified organization with a firm internal structure.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

It is not known whether American is serious in its animosity towards Iraq, because of the big support Iran is offering to America in its war in Afghanistan and in Iraq. Hence, it is necessary first to exaggerate the Iranian danger and to convince America and the west in general, of the real danger coming from Iran...". The document then outlines 6 ways to incite war between the two nations. Iraqi national security adviser [[Mowaffak al-Rubaie]] said the document, shows [[al-Qaeda in Iraq]] is in "pretty bad shape."

He told her that; "The Americans were constantly saying that the mujahideen in Iraq were led by foreigners... So, the Iraqi insurgents went to Zarqawi and insisted that an Iraqi be put in charge."  She continued by stating; "But as I saw in coming weeks, Zarqawi remained the insurgents' hero, and the most influential member of their council, whatever [[Abu Nour|Nour]]/[[Abdullah Rashid|Rashid]]'s position... At various times, I heard my captors discussing changes in their plans because of directives from the council and Zarqawi."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0821/p01s01d-woiq.html |title=Hostage: The Jill Carroll Story – Part 6 • Reciting Koranic verses |website=csmonitor.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901234407/http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0821/p01s01d-woiq.html |archivedate=1 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Schism between foreign fighters and native insurgency====
Large-scale terrorist attacks against civilians carried out by foreign fighters, as well as the interpretation of Islam that they attempt to impose on the local population in areas under their control, have increasingly turned Iraqis against them, in some cases breaking out into open fighting between different groups in the insurgency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A28105-2004Oct12.html |title=Insurgent Alliance Is Fraying in Fallujah |publisher=washingtonpost.com |date=13 October 2004 |accessdate=26 March 2010 | first=Karl | last=Vick}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/world/displaystory.cfm?story_id=5213863 |title=Arab world, Iraq and al-Qaeda &amp;#124; Unfamiliar questions in the Arab air |publisher=Economist.com |date=24 November 2005 |accessdate=26 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130210050711/http://www.worldthreats.com/middle_east/Foreign%20Fighters%20Reviled.htm W O R L D T H R E A T S – Foreign Fighters Now Reviled by Fallujah Residents]&lt;/ref&gt; There are signs that local Islamist insurgent groups have also increasingly caused the population to turn against them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cole |first=Juan |url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2004/05/22/najaf/index1.html |title="Najaf is dying" – Page 2 |publisher=Salon.com |date=22 May 2004 |accessdate=26 March 2010}}{{Dead link|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A18911-2004May11.html |title=Some in Najaf Protest Sadr |publisher=washingtonpost.com |date= 12 May 2004|accessdate=26 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsday.com/news/nationworld/world/wire/sns-ap-iraq-protest,0,2250615.story?coll=sns-ap-world-headlines |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040512151950/http://www.newsday.com/news/nationworld/world/wire/sns-ap-iraq-protest%2C0%2C2250615.story?coll=sns-ap-world-headlines |archivedate=12 May 2004 |title=Thousands March in Iraq Protesting Al-Sadr |date=11 May 2004 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/international.cfm?id=482652004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040610184938/http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/international.cfm?id=482652004 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=10 June 2004 |title=The Scotsman |publisher=Thescotsman.scotsman.com |date= |accessdate=26 March 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opinions differ on how broad this schism is. Terrorism expert [[Jessica Stern]] warned that; "In the run-up to the war, most Iraqis viewed the foreign volunteers who were rushing in to fight against America as troublemakers, and Saddam Hussein's forces reportedly killed many of them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ksg.harvard.edu/news/opeds/2003/stern_terrorism_nyt_082003.htm |title=Jessica Stern in the New York Times: How America Created a Terrorist Haven |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030827151002/http://www.ksg.harvard.edu/news/opeds/2003/stern_terrorism_nyt_082003.htm |archivedate=27 August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; This opinion contradicts Iraqi scholar [[Mustapha Alani]], who says that these foreigners are increasingly welcomed by the public, especially in the former Ba'athist strongholds north of Baghdad.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

While some have noted an alliance of convenience that existed between the foreign fighters and the native Sunni insurgents, there are signs that the foreign militants, especially those who follow Zarqawi, are increasingly unpopular among the native fighters. In the run-up to the December 2005 elections, Sunni fighters were warning al-Qaeda members and foreign fighters not to attack polling stations. One former Ba'athist told Reuters; "Sunnis should vote to make political gains. We have sent leaflets telling al-Qaeda that they will face us if they attack voters."  An unnamed Sunni leader was quoted commenting on Zarqawi; "Zarqawi is an American, Israeli and Iranian agent who is trying to keep our country unstable so that the Sunnis will keep facing occupation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1520703/Abu-Musab-al-Zarqawi.html|title=Abu Musab al-Zarqawi|date=9 June 2006|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By early 2006, the split between the Sunni groups and the Zarqawi-led foreign fighters had grown dramatically, and Sunni forces began targeting al-Qaeda forces for assassination. One senior intelligence official told the ''Telegraph'' that Zarqawi had fled to Iran as a result of the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Poole |first=Oliver |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/02/06/wirq06.xml |title=Insurgents turning against al-Qaeda in Iraq |publisher=Telegraph |date=6 February 2006 |accessdate=26 March 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to al-Qaeda killings in Iraq, Sunni insurgents in al-Anbar province led by former Ba'athist intelligence officer Ahmed Ftaikhan formed an anti-al-Qaeda militia called the Anbar Revolutionaries. All of the militia's core members have relatives who have been killed by al-Qaeda in Iraq, and they have sought to prevent foreign jihadis from entering the country.

===Iranian influence===
An estimated 150 Iranian intelligence officers, plus members of Iran's [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps]], are believed to be active inside Iraq at any given time.&lt;ref name=wp20070125&gt;Dafna Linzer – [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/25/AR2007012502199.html Troops Authorized to Kill Iranian Operatives in Iraq] – The Washington Post&lt;/ref&gt; For more than a year, U.S. troops have detained and recorded fingerprints, photographs, and DNA samples from dozens of suspected Iranian agents in a catch and release program designed to intimidate the Iranian leadership.&lt;ref name=wp20070125 /&gt; Iranian influence is felt most heavily within the Iraqi Government, the ISF, and Shiite militias.

Interrogation of members from the Asaib Ahl al Haq network revealed that the group had received substantial Iran-based training in explosives technology; arms and munitions; and some cases of advice. All this is alleged by the U.S. military to have taken place through the [[Quds force]] of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.&lt;ref&gt;Sgt. Sara Wood, USA

Although the [[Coalition Provisional Authority|CPA]] enforced a 1987 law banning unions in public enterprises, trade unions such as the [[Iraqi Federation of Trade Unions]] (IFTU) and Iraq's [[Union of the Unemployed]] have also mounted effective opposition to the Coalition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=David |last=Bacon |url=http://www.fpif.org/commentary/2004/0407upsurge.html |title=Iraq's Labor Upsurge Wins Support from U.S. Unions |work=FPIF Commentary |date=28 July 2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040803074552/http://www.fpif.org/commentary/2004/0407upsurge.html |archivedate=3 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, no trades unions support the armed insurgents, and unions have themselves been subject to attacks from the insurgents.

==Tactics==
{{Main|Tactics of the Iraqi insurgency}}
The '''tactics of the Iraqi insurgency''' vary widely. The majority of militant elements use car bombs, kidnappings, hostage-taking, shootings and other types of attacks to target Iraqis and U.S. forces with little regard for civilian casualties.
[[File:IraqiInterpreter.jpg|thumb|Interpreters, mostly [[Iraqi American]]s on patrol with U.S. troops, became frequent targets of insurgents during the war]]

==Awareness of American public opinion==
A single study has compared the number of insurgent attacks in Iraq to supposedly negative statements in the U.S. media, release of public opinion polls, and geographic variations in access to international media by Iraqis. The purpose was to determine if there was a link between insurgent activity and media reports. The researchers' study suggested it may be possible that insurgent attacks spiked by 5 to 10% after increases in the number of negative reports of the war in the media. The authors believe this may possibly be an "emboldenment effect" and speculated that "insurgent groups respond rationally to expected probability of US withdrawal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Radha |last=Iyengar |first2=Jonathan |last2=Monten |title=Is There an "Emboldenment" Effect?

==Iraqi public opinion==
A series of several polls have been conducted to ascertain the position of the Iraqi public further on [[Al Qaeda in Iraq]] and the U.S. presence. Some polls have found the following:
* Polls suggest the majority of Iraqis disapprove of the presence of Coalition forces.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/27/AR2006092701435.html |title=Poll: Iraqis Back Attacks on U.S. Troops |publisher=washingtonpost.com |date= 27 September 2006|accessdate=26 March 2010 | first=Barry | last=Schweid}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A majority of both Sunnis and Shi'as want an end to the U.S. presence as soon as possible, although Sunnis are opposed to the Coalition soldiers being there by greater margins.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050204012321/http://zogby.com/news/ReadNews.dbm?ID=957 Survey Finds Deep Divisions in Iraq; Sunni Arabs Overwhelmingly Reject Sunday Elections; Majority of Sunnis, Shias Favor U.S. Withdrawal, New Abu Dhabi TV / Zogby Poll Reveals]. Zogby International, 28 January 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Polls suggest the vast majority of Iraqis support attacks on insurgent groups with 80% supporting US attacks on Al-Qaeda.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7299569.stm Polls suggest Iraqi's "Optimistic"] BBC&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Analysis By Gary Langer |url=http://abcnews.go.com/PollingUnit/story?id=7058272&amp;page=1#.UE9a1tWgSSo |title=Dramatic Advances Sweep Iraq, Boosting Support for Democracy – ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=16 March 2009 |accessdate=7 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Directly after the invasion, polling suggested that a slight majority supported the US invasion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130126110354/http://www.indianexpress.com/storyOld.php?storyId=22949 Most Iraqis in Baghdad welcome US: NDTV poll] The Indian Express&lt;/ref&gt; However polls conducted in June 2005 suggest that there is some sentiment towards Coalition armies being in Iraq. A 2005 poll by British intelligence said that 45% of Iraqis support attacks against Coalition forces, rising to 65% in some areas, and that 82% are "strongly opposed" to the presence of Coalition troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/10/23/wirq23.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2005/10/23/ixworld.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409123953/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2005%2F10%2F23%2Fwirq23.xml&amp;sSheet=%2Fnews%2F2005%2F10%2F23%2Fixworld.html |archivedate= 9 April 2008 |title=Sean Rayment, Defence Correspondent |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=13 March 2010 |accessdate=26 March 2010 |location=London |first=Charles |last=Moore |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Demands for U.S. withdrawal have also been signed on by one third of Iraq's Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Abdel-Wahed Tohmeh, [http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=15&amp;ItemID=8138 83 MPs Ask al-Jaafari to Put a Timetable for the Withdrawal of Foreign Troops] {{webarchive |url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091001195457/http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=15&amp;ItemID=8138 |date=1 October 2009 }}. 22 June 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; These results are consistent with a January 2006 poll that found an overall 47% approval for attacks on U.S.-led forces. That figure climbed to 88% among Sunnis. Attacks on Iraqi security forces and civilians, however, were approved of by only 7% and 12% of respondents respectively. Polls conducted between 2005 and 2007 showed 31–37% of Iraqi's wanted US and other Coalition forces to withdraw once security was restored and that 26–35% wanted immediate withdrawal instead.&lt;ref name="WorldPublicOpinion"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/pdf/sep06/Iraq_Sep06_rpt.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005203935/http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/pdf/sep06/Iraq_Sep06_rpt.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date= 5 October 2006 |title=The Iraqi Public on the U.S.&amp;nbsp;Presence and the Future of Iraq |format=PDF |publisher=World Public Opinion |date=27 September 2006 |accessdate=23 November 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbcpoll"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/19_03_07_iraqpollnew.pdf Iraq Poll] conducted by D3&amp;nbsp;Systems for the BBC, ABC News, ARD German TV and USA Today.

==Scope and size of the Insurgency==
{{Further|Casualties of the conflict in Iraq since 2003|Iraq Body Count project}}
The most intense Sunni insurgent activity takes place in the cities and countryside along the Euphrates River from the Syrian border town of [[Al-Qa'im (town)|al-Qaim]] through [[Ramadi]] and [[Fallujah]] to [[Baghdad]], as well as along the Tigris river from Baghdad north to [[Tikrit]]. Heavy guerrilla activity also takes place around the cities of Mosul and [[Tal Afar]] in the north, as well as the "[[Triangle of Death (Iraq)|Triangle of Death]]" south of Baghdad, which includes the "-iya" cities of Iskandariya, Mahmudiya, Latifiya, and Yusufiya. Lesser activity takes place in several other areas of the country. The insurgents are believed to maintain a key supply line stretching from Syria through al-Qaim and along the Euphrates to Baghdad and central Iraq, the Iraqi equivalent of the [[Ho Chi Minh trail]]. A second "ratline" runs from the Syrian border through Tal Afar to Mosul.
[[File:Iraqcontrol.JPG|thumb|right|Provincial control of Iraq in September 2011 {{legend|green|Coalition control}}]]
Although estimates of the total number of Iraqi guerrillas varies by group and fluctuates under changing political climate, the latest assessments put the present number at between 3,000 and 7,000 fighters along with numerous supporters and facilitators throughout the Sunni Arab community. At various points U.S. forces provided estimates on the number of fighters in specific regions. A few are provided here (although these numbers almost certainly have fluctuated):
* Fallujah (mid-2004): 2,000–5,000 In a November 2004 operation, the Fallujah insurgency has been destroyed or dispersed, but had staged a comeback in 2005, albeit not to former strength, in the course of 2005–2008 the remainder of the insurgency was defeated in Fallujah and the rest of Al-Anbar province.
* [[Samarra]] (August 2011): 1,000+
* [[Baquba]] (August 2011 ): 1,000+
* Baghdad (August 2011): 2,000+
Guerilla forces operate in many of the cities and towns of [[al-Anbar]] province, due to mostly ineffective Iraqi security forces in this area. There was extensive guerrilla activity in [[Ramadi]], the capital of the province, as well as [[Al-Qa'im (town)|al-Qa'im]], the first stop on an insurgent movement route between Iraq and Syria. In 2006, reports suggested that the Anbar capital Ramadi had largely fallen under insurgent control along with most of the Anbar region, and that as a result the United States had sent an extra 3,500 marines to reestablish control of the region. In the early part of 2007 the insurgency suffered serious setbacks in Ramadi after they were defeated in the Second Battle of Ramadi in the fall of 2006. With the help of the [[Anbar Salvation Council]], incidents fell from an average of 30 attacks per day in December 2006 to an average of fewer than four in April 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/asection/la-fg-kidcops7may07,1,648855.story?coll=la-news-a_section |title=A ragtag solution with real results – Los Angeles Times |publisher=Latimes.com |date=7 May 2007 |accessdate=26 March 2010 |first=Chris |last=Kraul |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605161954/http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/asection/la-fg-kidcops7may07%2C1%2C648855.story?coll=la-news-a_section |archivedate= 5 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baghdad is still one of the most violent regions of the country, even after the 2007 troop surge more than two-thirds of the violence that takes place in Iraq happens in Baghdad even though the Iraqi Government is in firm control of the entire city. Suicide attacks and car bombs are near daily occurrences in Baghdad. The road from Baghdad to the city airport is the most dangerous in the country, if not the world. Iraqi security and police forces had also been significantly built up in the capital and, despite being constantly targeted, had enjoyed some successes such as the pacification of [[Haifa Street]], which however subsequently saw a massive surge of insurgent activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.bellsouth.net/s/editorial.dll?pnum=1&amp;bfromind=1057&amp;eeid=4934130&amp;_sitecat=1505&amp;dcatid=0&amp;eetype=article&amp;render=y&amp;ac=1&amp;ck=&amp;ch=ne&amp;s=in|title=AT&amp;T |publisher=Home.bellsouth.net |date=1 January 1985 |accessdate=26 March 2010}}{{Dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; and after the failed Coalition [[Operation Together Forward]] fell under Sunni insurgent control. The U.S. and Iraqi Forces scored many decisive victories in 2007 during the U.S. troops surge when they launched Operation Law and Order and Operation Phantam Thunder which broke the back of the insurgency and has since the saw a mass reduction in violence by 80 percent since then.

As time passed the insurgent grasp on Mosul has strengthened and by mid-2007 insurgents had control of most neighborhoods on the west bank of the Tigris, with the exception of the few Coalition bases scattered throughout the city and their immediate surroundings. Kurdish peshmerga-forces are in control of the East bank neighborhoods, mostly populated by fellow Kurds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuxomuhYvHQ&amp;mode=related&amp;search= |title=Iraqi Mujahideen in Control of Mosul |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=26 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent intelligence suggests that the base of foreign paramilitary operations has moved from Anbar to the religiously and ethnically mixed [[Diyala Governorate|Diyala province]]. By July 2007 Diyala had fallen under almost total Insurgent control, and had become the headquarters for the Sunni-dominated [[Islamic State of Iraq]], which has issued a proclamation declaring the regional capital Baqubah its capital.

In response to a law allowing for the partitioning of Iraq into autonomous regions, members of the Mutayibeen Coalition (''[[Khalf al-Mutayibeen]]''&lt;ref name="memri171006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/1910.htm|title=Islamist Websites Monitor No. 8|publisher=MEMRI|date=17 October 2006|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- alternate spelling: "Helf" Alternate trans.: "Mutayibeen Alliance"?

Similar parades were held two days later in several towns across western Iraq, two of which occurred within two miles of U.S. military bases.

By October 2006, small radicalized militias had seemed to overshadow the larger and more organized Sunni groups which had composed the insurgency previously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/18/AR2006101801865.html |title=Militias Splintering into Radicalized Cells |publisher=washingtonpost.com |date= 19 October 2006|accessdate=26 March 2010 | first=Sudarsan | last=Raghavan}}&lt;/ref&gt; As disagreements emerged in pre-existing groups for reasons ranging from the rift in the Sunni forces between foreign and Iraqi fighters, competition between Mahdi Army and Badr Brigade, and anger over various decisions such as Muqtada al Sadr's agreement to join the political process, dozens of insurgency groups sprung up across the country, though particularly in Baghdad where the U.S. army has listed 23 active militias. Residents have described the capital as being a patchwork of militia run fiefs.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} As a result of the insurgency's splintering nature, many established leaders seemed to lose influence.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} This was particularly illustrated on 19 October, when members of the Mahdi army briefly seized control of Amarah. The attack, while demonstrating the influence of the Madhi army, is believed to have originated as a result of contention between local units of the Madhi army and the allegedly Badr brigade run security forces, and the timing suggested that neither Al Sadr nor his top commanders had known or orchestrated the offensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Burns|first1=John, F.|title=Precarious Cease-Fire in Amara Holds|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/22/world/middleeast/22iraq.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=21 December 2015|agency=The New York Times|date=22 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the height of the war, insurgents launched hundreds of attacks each month against Coalition forces. Overtime, insurgency groups moved to more sophisticated methods of attack such as [[Explosively formed penetrator]]s, and [[Far-infrared laser|infrared lasers]], which cannot be easily jammed. These attacks contributed to the rate of civilian casualties which in turn reduced Iraq's public safety as well as the reliability of infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fareedzakaria.com/articles/newsweek/082205.html |author= Fareed Zakaria |title= Don't Make Hollow Threats |date= 22 August 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060317010823/http://www.fareedzakaria.com/articles/newsweek/082205.html |archivedate=17 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 29 January 2009 4,235 U.S. soldiers, 178 British soldiers and 139 soldiers from other nations (allied with the coalition) have died in Iraq. 31,834 U.S. soldiers had been wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://icasualties.org/oif/ |author1=Pat Kneisler |author2=Michael White |author3=Evan D. |publisher= Iraq coalition casualties count |title= Operation Enduring Freedom Fatalities |date= 29 January 2007 |accessdate= 23 September 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070922155006/http://icasualties.org/oif/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 22 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coalition forces do not usually release death counts. As such, the exact number of insurgents killed by the Coalition or Iraqi forces is unknown. Through September 2007 more than 19,000 insurgents were reported to have been killed in fighting with Coalition forces and tens of thousands of Iraqi "suspected civilians" were captured (including 25,000 detainees in U.S. military custody at the time), according to military statistics released for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Michaels |first=Jim |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2007-09-26-insurgents_N.htm |title=19,000 insurgents killed in Iraq since '03 |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=27 September 2007 |accessdate=26 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Jersey Boys''''' is a 2005 [[jukebox musical]] with music by [[Bob Gaudio]], lyrics by [[Bob Crewe]], and book by [[Marshall Brickman]] and [[Rick Elice]]. It is presented in a [[documentary film|documentary]]-style format that dramatizes the formation, success and eventual break-up of the 1960s [[rock 'n' roll]] group [[The Four Seasons (band)|The Four Seasons]]. The musical is structured as four "seasons", each narrated by a different member of the band who gives his own perspective on its history and music. Songs include "[[Big Girls Don't Cry (The Four Seasons song)|Big Girls Don't Cry]]", "[[Sherry (song)|Sherry]]", "[[December 1963 (Oh, What A Night)]]", "[[My Eyes Adored You]]", "[[Stay (Maurice Williams song)|Stay]]", "[[Can't Take My Eyes Off You]]", "[[Working My Way Back to You]]" and "[[Rag Doll (The Four Seasons song)|Rag Doll]]", among others. The title refers to the fact that the members of The Four Seasons are from [[New Jersey]] and are male.

The musical ran on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] from 2005 to 2017, and since its debut it has been on two North American national tours and two national tours of The UK and Ireland. There have been productions of the show in London's [[West End theatre|West End]], Las Vegas, Chicago, Toronto, Melbourne and other Australian cities, Singapore, South Africa, The Netherlands, Japan, Dubai, and China.  ''Jersey Boys'' won four 2006 [[Tony Awards]] including Best Musical, and the 2009 [[Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Musical]].

==Development==
In the early 2000s, [[Bob Gaudio]], an original [[The Four Seasons (band)|Four Seasons]] member, sought to make a musical from the discography of the band. He hired book writers [[Rick Elice]] and [[Marshall Brickman]], and director [[Des McAnuff]] (at the suggestion of [[Michael David (producer)|Michael David]] of Dodger Theatricals). Brickman suggested creating a show about the band's history, instead of repurposing their songs for an independent story the way [[ABBA]] did with ''Mamma Mia!''.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"&gt;{{cite news | last=Pressley | first=Nelson | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/02/AR2009100200243.html | title=Stages: Frankie Valli, the 'Jersey Boys' Soprano, Still Happy to Take a Bow | newspaper=[[Washington Post]] | date=October 5, 2009 | accessdate=February 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brickman was drawn to the project because: "It's a classic American story. It's rags to riches, and back to rags."&lt;ref name="nytimes2005"&gt;{{cite news |authorlink=Mark Rotella | last = Rotella | first = Mark | title = Straight Out of Newark | publisher = NYtimes.com | date = October 2, 2005 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/02/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/02njBOYS.html?pagewanted=all | accessdate = February 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Little was known to the public about the group's history prior to the premiere of the musical, because the magazines of the era didn't write much about them. &lt;ref name="nytimes2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="metro"&gt;{{cite web | last = Murphy | first = T. Michelle | title = The boys behind 'Jersey Boys' | publisher = metro.usm | date = January 18, 2012 | url = http://www.metro.us/newyork/entertainment/article/1074863--the-boys-behind-jersey-boys--page0 | accessdate = February 1, 2013 }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In their research, Brickman and Elice were surprised to find that the members had prison records, which might have prevented their music from being played if it had been publicized when they were active.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"/&gt;&lt;ref name="metro"/&gt; According to Gaudio, "Back then, things were a little clean-cut, don't forget, so the idea of our story getting out was horrifying to us."&lt;ref name="telegraphUK"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1582547/West-Ends-Jersey-Boys-musical-has-Mafia-links.html | title= West End's Jersey Boys musical has Mafia links | date=March 23, 2008 | accessdate=February 1, 2013 | last=Nikkhah | first=Roya | publisher=The Telegraph }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other bands of the time projected street-tough images, but The Four Seasons cleaned themselves up in order to be palatable for mainstream listeners.&lt;ref name="nytimes2005"/&gt;

Brickman and Elice also used material from interviews with surviving Four Seasons members Gaudio, [[Frankie Valli]] and [[Tommy DeVito (musician)|Tommy DeVito]]. While the Four Seasons as a group made headlines, as individuals they did not receive much press due to groups like [[the Beatles]] receiving the attention.&lt;ref name="baltimore jewish times"&gt;{{cite web | last = Klickstein | first = Mathew | title = The Jewish 'Jersey Boys' | publisher = jewishtimes.com | date = September 14, 2016 | url = http://jewishtimes.com/52028/the-jewish-jersey-boys/news/ | accessdate = September 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Brickman noted that each member had his own perspective on what happened during their tenure as a group. Of the three, they approached DeVito last, who told them, "Don't listen to those guys. I'll tell you what really happened." Elice said that getting DeVito's version was a "eureka moment" and the contradiction in their stories ended up being incorporated in the musical for a [[Rashomon effect]].&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"/&gt;&lt;ref name="philly article"&gt;{{cite web | last = Darrow | first = Chuck | title = Writer tells how 'Jersey Boys' became Broadway stars | publisher = philly.com | date = September 29, 2010 | url = http://articles.philly.com/2010-09-29/entertainment/24977242_1_brickman-and-elice-jersey-boys-bob-crewe/2 | accessdate = February 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The writers were also contacted by family members of the late [[Boss (crime)|mob boss]] [[Gyp DeCarlo]] to ensure that he would be portrayed respectfully.&lt;ref name="telegraphUK"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.seattlepi.com/ae/article/Broadway-musical-Jersey-Boys-strikes-a-popular-1257944.php | title=Broadway musical 'Jersey Boys' strikes a popular nostalgic chord | last=Adcock | first=Joe | date=December 6, 2007 | accessdate=February 1, 2013 | publisher=Seattle P.I.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dcpa201411/&gt;

Although Gaudio was part of the initial development team, he wasn't involved in the creative process during tryouts, and only met the cast once the show had premiered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Bacalzo | first = Dan | last2 = Portantiere | first2 = Michael | title = Front &amp; Center | publisher = theatermania.com | date = October 2005 | url = http://www.theatermania.com/new-york-city-theater/news/10-2005/front-and-center_6952.html | accessdate = February 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaudio, Valli and DeVito had decided to step back from the show's creative process because they lacked objectivity, and they left it to Brickman, Elice and McAnuff to take the story to the stage.&lt;ref name="metro"/&gt; However, Gaudio and Valli still had final say on whether to end the show if they didn't like it.&lt;ref name="philly article"/&gt;

==Productions==
''Jersey Boys'' premiered at the [[La Jolla Playhouse]] at [[University of California, San Diego]], in an out-of-town tryout on October 5, 2004, and ran through January 16, 2005&lt;ref&gt;[[Simonson, Robert]] and Hernandez, Ernio.[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/96082.html Playbill News: "Seasons in the Sun: Jersey Boys Opens on Broadway Nov. 6"] playbill.com, November 6, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Christian Hoff]], [[David Norona]], Daniel Reichard and [[J.

The musical began previews on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] on October 4, 2005, and officially opened on November 6, 2005, at the [[August Wilson Theatre]]. The cast starred John Lloyd Young as Frankie Valli, Christian Hoff as Tommy DeVito, Daniel Reichard as Bob Gaudio and J. Robert Spencer as [[Nick Massi]]. The musical is directed by [[Des McAnuff]], the then-artistic director at La Jolla Playhouse, with choreography by [[Sergio Trujillo]], and music technical design by composer and conductor [[Deborah Hurwitz]]. The Broadway production had 38 previews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibdb.com/production.php?id=394781|title=Jersey Boys Official IBDB listing|publisher=The Broadway League}}&lt;/ref&gt; It reached its 4093rd performance on September 22, 2015, making it the 12th longest-running show on Broadway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/jersey-boys-surpasses-miss-saigon-on-long-run-list-tonight-363662 | website=Playbill.com | title=''Jersey Boys'' Surpasses ''Miss Saigon'' on Long-Run List Tonight | date=September 22, 2015 | accessdate=September 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable cast replacements include [[Andy Karl]] and [[Richard H. Blake]] as Tommy DeVito, [[Sebastian Arcelus]] as Bob Gaudio and [[Ryan Molloy]], who originated the role in the West End production, as Frankie Valli. The Broadway production closed on January 15, 2017 after 4,642 performances, with [[Mark Ballas]] as the final Frankie Valli.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/JERSEY-BOYS-Sets-Closing-Date-After-11-Years-DANCING-WITH-THE-STARS-Mark-Ballas-Will-Be-Final-Frankie-Valli-20160906 " 'Jersey Boys' Sets Closing Date After 11 Years; DANCING WITH THE STARS' Mark Ballas Will Be Final Frankie Valli"] broadwayworld.com, September 6, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ew.com/article/2016/09/06/jersey-boys-closing-broadway-january-2017 " 'Jersey Boys' ending 11-year Broadway run] ew.com, September 6, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The first national U.S. tour of the musical began on December 10, 2006, at the [[Curran Theatre]] in [[San Francisco]] and went on to play in 38 cities. ''Jersey Boys'' played at the [[Forrest Theatre]] in [[Philadelphia]], where it broke the box office record eight times before moving on to a return engagement in Boston.&lt;ref&gt;[http://broadwayworld.com/article/JERSEY_BOYS_Actor_Hujabre_Injured_in_Philadelphia_Run_Set_to_Return_127_20101206 "Jersey Boys Actor Hujabre Injured in Philadelphia Run; Set to Return 12/7] broadwayworld.com, December 6, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007, while the first national tour continued (with Steve Gouveia from the original Broadway cast as Nick Massi), a second company debuted at the Curran and ended as an open-ended run at [[Chicago]]'s [[CIBC Theatre|Bank of America Theatre]], beginning on October 5, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/111684.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011174824/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/111684.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 11, 2007 |title=Jersey Boys Begins Chicago Run Oct. 5 |publisher=Playbill, Inc. |accessdate=January 18, 2008 |date=October 5, 2007 |author=Hernandez, Ernio }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Chicago cast appeared on stage in the [[59th Primetime Emmy Awards|2007 Emmy Awards]] in a tribute to HBO's ''[[The Sopranos]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://edition.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/TV/09/16/emmy.night/index.html | title='Sopranos' goes out on high note | date=September 17, 2007 | accessdate=February 1, 2013 | first=Todd | last=Leopold | website=Cnn.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; A special holiday return engagement played at the Curran Theatre from November 20 through December 30, 2007, starring Rick Faugno as Frankie Valli, Andrew Rannells as Bob Gaudio, Bryan McElroy as Tommy DeVito and Jeff Leibow as Nick Massi.

==Synopsis==

===Act I===
;Spring
"[[Ces soirées-là]]", a modern pop-rap song that was released in 2000, is performed. Tommy DeVito arrives, introduces himself and explains how the song is a cover of The Four Seasons' "[[December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night)]]". He offers to tell the story of the band, explaining how he started out with the group "The Variety Trio" with his brother Nick DeVito and friend Nick Massi, eventually discovering teenager Frankie Castelluccio and taking him under his wing, teaching him everything he knows ("The Early Years: A Scrapbook"). During these early years Nick Massi helped train Frankie to sing, Tommy went in and out of prison, Frankie changed his last name to Valli, Tommy and Frankie developed a good relationship with mob boss Gyp DeCarlo, and Frankie fell in love with and married Mary Delgado. Musically, the band was still struggling and kept changing their name and sound but without any dramatic success. One day friend and fellow Jersey boy [[Joe Pesci]] comes up to Tommy and says that he knows a singer-songwriter who'd make the perfect fourth for their band: Bob Gaudio.

;Summer
Bob Gaudio takes over the narration, telling the audience that no matter what Tommy says, he wasn't plucked from obscurity by him, since he already had a hit single with "[[Short Shorts]]". Bob goes with [[Joe Pesci]] to see the band perform, and is immediately impressed by Frankie's voice. Bob performs a song he'd just written: "Cry for Me" on piano, which Frankie, Nick Massi and then Tommy joining in with vocals, bass and guitar respectively. They negotiate an agreement, though Tommy is at first skeptical that Bobby (then still a teenager) will be good for the band. The band eventually gets a contract with producer Bob Crewe but only to sing back-up ("Backup Sessions"). Crewe insists that the band has an "identity crisis" and needs to make a firm decision on a name and a sound. The band name themselves after The Four Seasons bowling alley, and Bobby writes them three songs that finally propel them to stardom: "[[Sherry (song)|Sherry]]", "[[Big Girls Don't Cry (The Four Seasons song)|Big Girls Don't Cry]]" and "[[Walk Like a Man (The Four Seasons song)|Walk Like a Man]]". In the wake of their success, Bob also chalks up a personal first by losing his virginity ("[[December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night)]]"). The band's success means that they tour a lot more, along the way discovering the girl band [[The Angels (American group)|The Angels]] ("[[My Boyfriend's Back (song)|My Boyfriend's Back]]"). Unfortunately, the constant touring strains Frankie's marriage to Mary, and they eventually divorce ("[[My Eyes Adored You]]"). The band continues to enjoy chart successes ("[[Dawn (Go Away)]]") until after a concert the band is approached by a loan shark out to claim money owed by Tommy ("Walk Like a Man (reprise)").

===Act II===
; Fall
Nick Massi, taking over as Narrator, explains that Bob was so focused on the band's musical success and future that he couldn't see that the band had been in trouble for some time. Tommy's been racking up debts, and a forgotten bill during a previous tour lands the band in jail over the weekend, which strains things between Tommy and Bob ("[[Big Man in Town]]"). Nick observes that Tommy became jealous of Frankie's success and closeness with Bobby, and attempted to seduce Frankie's new girlfriend Lorraine. The two never confronted each other about it, but the old friendship was not what it used to be. When the loan shark approaches the band for the $150,000 owed by Tommy, Frankie goes to Gyp DeCarlo for help despite Tommy's insistence that he doesn't need it ("[[Beggin']]"). The band, Gyp, and the loan shark come to agreement: Tommy is to be "sequestered" in Las Vegas where the mob can keep an eye on him, and the band will willingly cover the debt, along with an additional half a million in unpaid taxes that Tommy kept hidden from the group. At this time, Nick declares that he's tired of everything and wants out, despite Frankie and Bob trying to convince him to stay ("[[Stay (Maurice Williams song)|Stay]]/[[Let's Hang On!]]").

; Winter
Frankie takes over narration, explaining that though he owes Tommy a great deal, he's aware that their relationship wasn't ideal, and he never understood why Nick decided to leave. Frankie and Bob find replacements to keep the band a quartet ("[[Opus 17 (Don't You Worry 'Bout Me)]]") until Bobby announces that he's never been comfortable in the spotlight and that Frankie should be a single, i.e. Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons. In his personal life, Frankie's relationship with his daughter Francine is strained and he breaks up with girlfriend Lorraine ("[[Bye, Bye, Baby (Baby, Goodbye)]]"). Frankie continues to have success thanks to Bobby's songs, and hits jackpot with "[[C'mon Marianne]]" and the almost-never-released "[[Can't Take My Eyes Off You]]" which Bobby fights to get airplay for. Along with the success of "[[Working My Way Back to You]]", Frankie and Bobby finally finish paying off Tommy's debts, and Frankie's life is good until his daughter Francine dies from a drug overdose ("Fallen Angel")

; Finale
Bob Crewe describes The Four Seasons' 1990 induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], which reunited the original four members on stage one last time ("[[Rag Doll (Four Seasons song)|Rag Doll]]"). Each member takes a moment to address the audience in turn, explaining his pride at having been with the band and briefly notes what he did afterwards ("[[Who Loves You (song)|Who Loves You]]").

===Instrumentation===
The score for ''Jersey Boys'' requires a small orchestra with nine musicians: three keyboards, guitar, bass, drums, two woodwind players, and trumpet. The first woodwind player doubles on alto and tenor saxophone, clarinet, flute, and oboe. The second woodwind part doubles on tenor and baritone sax, clarinet, and bass clarinet. The trumpet also doubles on flugelhorn.

==Critical response==
[[Ben Brantley]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, "THE CROWD GOES WILD. I'm talking about the real, mostly middle-aged crowd at the August Wilson Theater, who seem to have forgotten what year it is or how old they are or, most important, that John Lloyd Young is not Frankie Valli.

==Charity performances==
The [[West End theatre|West End]] cast of ''Jersey Boys'' appeared as a guest act for the [[Royal Variety Performance]] 2008, which was staged at the [[London Palladium]] on December 11 in the presence of senior members of the [[British Royal Family|Royal family]]. The Royal Variety Performance is a gala event held annually at a major British theatre, to raise money for the [[Entertainment Artistes' Benevolent Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eabf.org.uk/RVP-PressRelease08.pdf Press release announcing acts for the 2008 Royal Variety Performance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203044946/http://www.eabf.org.uk/RVP-PressRelease08.pdf |date=December 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, The [[West End theatre|West End]] cast of ''Jersey Boys'' performed a show, with the profits going to [[Children In Need]]. The show ended with [[Pudsey Bear]] joining in to sing a medley, and raised £60,150 for the charity. In 2009 the cast also appeared as a guest act for [[Children In Need]].

''Jersey Boys'' Chicago has been honored two years in a row at the Broadway Cares event for being the top fundraiser in the Tour category. In 2008, ''Jersey Boys'' Chicago raised $220,000 for BC/EFA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://broadwayworld.com/article/Photo_Coverage_GYPSY_OF_THE_YEAR_2008_Backstage_20081210 |title=Gypsy of the Year 20 – |website=Broadwayworld.com |date= |accessdate=May 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For every ticket sold for every Broadway performance in the month of October 2010, $1 was donated to the ''[[VH1 Save the Music Foundation]]''. ''Jersey Boys'' aimed to raise funds to restore one full music education program in a New York City school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.okmagazine.com/2010/09/today-were-loving-jersey-boys-vh1-save-the-music/ OK Magazine talks about Jersey Boys Broadway and VH1 Save the Music Foundation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926073730/http://www.okmagazine.com/2010/09/today-were-loving-jersey-boys-vh1-save-the-music/ |date=September 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The show eventually raised $43,521, enough to restore the instrumental music education program at PS 85 in the Bronx.&lt;ref name=vh1&gt;[http://www.vh1savethemusic.com/node/5477 Jersey Boys at www.vh1savethemusic.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207023436/http://www.vh1savethemusic.com/node/5477 |date=December 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plans were made to donate additional funds raised to a second ''VH1 Save The Music Foundation'' grant recipient school.&lt;ref name=vh1/&gt;

==The Boys in Concert==
Four actors of the original Broadway production, Christian Hoff, Michael Longoria, Daniel Reichard and J. Robert Spencer, launched a concert tour titled ''The Boys in Concert'' in 2010. Frankie Valli, Bob Gaudio, Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice sued the production, claiming that it "steals songs, stage elements and copyrighted logo" that imply that it is an authorized spin-off of ''Jersey Boys''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Valli, Gaudio, Elice &amp; Rice File Suit Against former JERSEY BOYS Stars for Unauthorized 'Boys in the Concert' Tour | publisher = BroadwayWorld | date = April 2, 2010 | url = http://broadwayworld.com/article/Valli-Guido-Ellis-Rice-File-Suit-Against-former-JERSEY-BOYS-Stars-for-Unauthorized-Boys-in-the-Concert-Tour-20100412 | accessdate = February 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production was rebranded as ''The 4 Hitmen'', and Hoff, Longoria, Reichard and Spencer counter-sued, claiming that the accusations were false, and alleging the use of "bully tactics" in an "effort to injure the livelihood and the reputations" of the actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Hoff, Longoria, Reichard, and Spencer Counter-Sue JERSEY BOYS Producers and Four Seasons | publisher = BroadwayWorld | date = July 13, 2010 | url = http://broadwayworld.com/article/Hoff-Longoria-Reichard-and-Spencer-CounterSue-JERSEY-BOYS-Producers-and-Four-Seasons-20100713 | accessdate = February 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 23, 2010, Valli and company dropped the original suit, on the condition that the name of the performance is changed to distance itself from ''Jersey Boys''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Valli, Gaudio, Elice &amp; Rice Drop Suit Against JERSEY BOYS Stars for Unauthorized 'Boys In Concert' Tour | publisher = BroadwayWorld | date = September 23, 2010 | url = http://broadwayworld.com/article/Valli-Gaudio-Elice-Rice-Drop-Suit-Against-JERSEY-BOYS-Stars-for-Unauthorized-Boys-In-Concert-Tour-20100923 | accessdate = February 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of February 2013, this production is still active, and is named ''The Midtown Men''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://themidtownmen.com/ The Midtown Men - official website] - accessed on February 1, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The [[HBO]] series ''[[The Sopranos]]'' made several nods to ''Jersey Boys''.  For example:
*[[Frankie Valli]] played Mob captain [[Rusty Millio]], one of a group of just-released prison felons referred to the show's fictional journalists as "the Class of 2004".&lt;ref name="Bill Keveney, Bill"&gt;{{cite news|work=USA Today|date=March 25, 2004 |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/people/2004-03-25-frankie-valli_x.htm|title=Valli's 'Sopranos' role 'rings true'
|author= Bill Keveney, Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In ''[[The Sopranos]]'' episode, "[[The Ride (The Sopranos)|The Ride]]" (May 7, 2006), [[List of characters from The Sopranos – friends and family#Marianucci Gualtieri|Marianucci Gaultieri]] accompanies several other Green Grove Retirement Home residents on a bus trip to see ''Jersey Boys''.
*And the [[The Sopranos (season 6)|Season 6]] episode, "[[Walk Like a Man (The Sopranos)|Walk Like a Man]]" (May 6, 2007), is [[Walk Like a Man (The Sopranos)#Title reference|titled after]] the Four Seasons' [[Walk Like a Man (The Four Seasons song)|1963 song]].&lt;ref name="Bill Keveney, Bill"/&gt;

An '''[[independence referendum]]''' was held in the [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic|Lithuania]] on 9 February 1991.&lt;ref name=NS&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen]] &amp; Philip Stöver (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p1201 {{ISBN|978-3-8329-5609-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was approved by 93.2% of voters. The number of voters voting "yes" was 76.5% of all registered voters, far exceeding the threshold of 50%.&lt;ref name=DN&gt;Nohlen &amp; Stöver, p1210&lt;/ref&gt; Independence had been declared on 11 March 1990,&lt;ref&gt;Nohlen &amp; Stöver, p1189&lt;/ref&gt; and was achieved in August 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Nohlen &amp; Stöver, p1190&lt;/ref&gt;

The independence of the Republic of Lithuania was recognized by the United States on 2 September 1991. On 6 September 1991, the Soviet Union itself did the same.

{{citations needed|date=September 2014}}
'''Martín Garatuza''' (born 1601, [[Puebla]], [[Mexico]]) was a famous trickster whose frauds and escapes became legendary in colonial [[New Spain]] and whose name has passed into Spanish language, folklore and literature.

Garatuza, whose real name was Martín de Villavicencio Salazar, came to the attention of the authorities in Puebla in 1640 for posing as a priest without having been ordained. He played this role with great pomp, offering his hand to be kissed, hearing confessions, and saying mass. In this way he travelled through much of New Spain, gaining his living fraudulently.

In 1642 he was arrested in [[Nejapa de Madero|Nejapa]], [[Oaxaca]] by the [[Inquisition]], accused of saying mass without being ordained. He managed to escape, but a few months later he turned himself in to the Inquisition in Mexico City. He soon talked his way out of detention, being granted a leave of 40 days to return to Puebla for health reasons. Naturally, he used this opportunity to escape again and continue his escapades.

He was apprehended a third time and condemned to appear in an [[auto de fe]] "as a penitent, with a green candle in his hands, a rope about his neck, a white hood on his head". He was to receive 200 lashes and was sentenced to the galleys of [[Ternate|Terrenate]] for five years without pay. The auto de fe was held March 30, 1648 in Mexico City. Thereafter he left New Spain to complete his sentence and was never heard from again.

The expression "¿En qué pararán estas misas, Garatuza?" (What will end these masses, Garatuza?) has passed into the language. It refers to a difficult position a person finds himself in through the consequences of his own actions. The word ''gartusa'' (note the variant spelling) has several meanings as a noun. There is a card game of that name. The word can also mean the use of cajolery and flattery to gain one's ends, and it is the name of a feint in fencing.

[[Vicente Riva Palacio]] (1832–96) wrote the novel ''Martín Gartuza''. There is also a Mexican movie based on this novel (1935). In 1986 a Mexican telenovela of the same name was broadcast.

He is remembered in Mexico as a humorous character, one who lived by his wits but did not use violence.

[[File:Изображение 1175.jpg|thumb|Azerbaijani youth celebrating Novruz.]]
'''[[Nowruz|Novruz]] in [[Azerbaijan]]''' ({{lang-az|Novruz Bayramı}}) is a traditional holiday, which celebrates the New Year, and the coming of Spring. When Azerbaijan was part of the [[Soviet Union]], celebration of Novruz was generally unofficial, and at times even prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=What exactly is Novruz Bayram|periodical=Azerbaijan Today|last=Waters|first=Zena|issue=12|accessdate=2009-03-22|url=http://www.azerbaijantoday.az/ARCHIVE/12/life1.html|date=April–May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently in Azerbaijan, [[Novruz]] is treated as an official public holiday. In accordance with Article 105 of the Labour Code of Azerbaijan passed in 2006, workers receive five days off for Novruz.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.deloitte.com/dtt/cda/doc/content/December_2006%20Tax%20and%20Legal%20News(2).pdf|periodical=Tax and Legal News|publisher=[[Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu]]|date=December 2006|accessdate=2009-03-22|title=Public Holidays in Azerbaijan}}&lt;/ref&gt; After neighbouring Iran, Azerbaijan hosts the longest observance and amount of public days related to Novruz, with thus a total (including weekend) of 7 days.&lt;ref name="Azerbaijan 2010 Bank Holidays"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bank-holidays.com/holidays.php?annee=2010&amp;id_pays=16 |title=Azerbaijan 2010 Bank Holidays |publisher=Bank-holidays.com |accessdate=2010-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Novruz customs and celebration==
Usually preparation for Novruz begins a 
month prior to the festival. Each of forthcoming 4 weeks is devoted to one of the four elements and called accordingly in Azerbaijan. Each Tuesday people celebrate the day of one of the four elements - water, fire, earth and wind.&lt;ref name=nowaze&gt;[http://www.azerembassy-kuwait.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=167:international-day-of-nowruz-21-march-&amp;catid=8:news-a-events&amp;Itemid=37 International Day of Nowruz- 21 March] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513014137/http://www.azerembassy-kuwait.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=167:international-day-of-nowruz-21-march-&amp;catid=8:news-a-events&amp;Itemid=37 |date=2011-05-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; People do house cleaning, plant trees, make new dresses, paint eggs, make national pastries such as [[shekerbura]], [[pakhlava]], shorgoghal and a great variety of [[Azerbaijani cuisine|national cuisine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.trend.az/news/official/chronicle/1657130.html Azerbaijan marks Novruz holiday ]&lt;/ref&gt; Wheat is fried with kishmish ([[raisins]]) and [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]] (govurga). As a tribute to pre-Islamic [[Zoroastrian]] beliefs, every Tuesday during four weeks before the holiday children jump over small bonfires and candles are lit. On the holiday eve the graves of relatives are visited and tended.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.everyculture.com/A-Bo/Azerbaijan.html Azerbaijani traditions]&lt;/ref&gt;

Different ancient traditional games and shows such as “Kos-kosa” (symbolizes the coming of spring), “Khidir Ilyas” (the symbol of fertility and blossom), fortune telling, etc. are held at musical gatherings take place at Novruz holiday. Folk singers sing songs, the wrestlers test their strength. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.azernews.az/nation/51095.html&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://azeriamerica.com/Events_files/AzeriHolidays.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Novruz is a family holiday. In the evening before the holiday the whole family gathers around the holiday table laid with various dishes to make the New Year rich. The holiday goes on for several days and ends with festive public dancing and other entertainment of folk bands, contests of national sports. In rural areas crop holidays are marked.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studentsoftheworld.info/sites/arts/3559.php Studentsoftheworld - Azeri Traditions]&lt;/ref&gt;

The decoration of the festive table is khoncha, a big silver or copper tray with [[Semeni|Samani]], green shoots from wheat seeds placed in the centre and candles and dyed eggs by the number of family members around it. The table should be set, at least, with seven dishes.&lt;ref name=nowaze /&gt;

'''Old Settler's Music Festival''' is an annual [[music festival]] held since 1988. The festival dates for 2019 are April 11th to the 14th in Tilmon Texas, just southeast of Lockhart, Texas.  As one of Central Texas' signature music events, the festival features acoustic jazz and blues, bluegrass, local favorites, and award-winning artists from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kxan.com/dpp/news/local/old-settlers-music-festival-amps-up KXAN]&lt;/ref&gt;  Camping, arts and crafts, food and drink are available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austin360.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/music/entries/old_settlers_music_festival/ Austin American Statesman]&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival is represented at numerous music events including the International Folk Alliance Conference, the Americana Music Festival &amp; Conference, South By South West, the International Bluegrass Music Festival's World of Bluegrass, and the International Music Festival Conference.

==History==
The Old Settler's Bluegrass Festival was first held in Old Settler's Park in Round Rock, Texas. After the park flooded during a festival weekend, the organizers moved the festival first to Stone Mountain Events Center in Dripping Springs, Texas, and later to the Salt Lick BBQ Pavilion and Camp Ben McCulloch in Driftwood, Texas. In 2018, the festival moved to it's forever home on 145 acres of rolling meadows and tree covered campgrounds. The new location is just a cd's worth of listening from Austin. The name of the festival was modified to Old Settler's Music Festival in 2000.

Old Settler’s already has been widely recognized for its contribution to Central Texas culture; with over 30 bands performing for 16,000 roots-music fans each year, it’s considered among the major events that help the region sustain its status as the “live music capital of the world.” And now, as it plants roots of its own on its new 45-acre property, Old Settler’s cements its status as the sole roots music and camping festival in the Central Texas area.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31218">The years before 1975 featured the '''pre-1975 North Indian Ocean cyclone seasons'''. Each season was an ongoing event in the annual cycle of [[tropical cyclone]] formation. The North Indian tropical cyclone season has no bounds, but they tend to form between April and December, peaks in May and November. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northern [[Indian Ocean]]. Below are the most significant cyclones in the time period. Because much of the North Indian coastline is near sea level and prone to flooding, these cyclones can easily kill many with storm surge and flooding. These cyclones are among the deadliest on earth in terms of numbers killed.

===1721 Madras cyclone===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}

It was a [[cyclone]] which struck the city of [[Madras]] (now Chennai) in the [[Madras Presidency]] on 13 and 14 November 1721. The cyclone was one of the most severe in the history of the city and destroyed bridges and even suburban villages. The damages were high and three ships of the [[British East India Company]] were lost. The Island Bridge connecting [[Fort St George]] with [[The Island, Chennai|The Island]] was badly damaged as a result of the cyclone.

===1737 Calcutta Cyclone===
On 7 October 1737, a [[natural disaster]] struck the city of [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] (modern-day Kolkata) in [[India]].  For a long time this was believed in [[Europe]] to have been the result of an [[earthquake]], but it is now believed to have been a [[tropical cyclone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/world/most_destructive.php |title=Earthquakes with 50,000 or More Deaths |date=March 29, 2010 |publisher=USGS |accessdate=6 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091102112417/http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/world/most_destructive.php |archivedate=November 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bilham"&gt;[http://cires.colorado.edu/~bilham/gif_images/1737Calcutta.pdf] Bilham, The 1737 Calcutta Earthquake and Cyclone Evaluated, Bull. Seism. Soc. Amer. 84(5), 1650–1657, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Joshua Moore]], the duties collector for the [[British East India Company]] in Calcutta, wrote in his official report that a storm and flood had destroyed nearly all the thatched buildings and killed 3,000 of the city's inhabitants.  Other reports from merchant ships indicated an earthquake  and [[tidal surge]] were to blame, destroying 20,000 ships in the harbor and killing 300,000 people.  It should be noted that the population of Calcutta at the time was around 3,000–20,000.&lt;ref name="bilham"/&gt;&lt;ref name="freel"/&gt;

Although there seems to be little evidence for the popular figure of 300,000 deaths&lt;ref&gt;[http://cires.colorado.edu/~bilham/1737Earthquake.html colorado.edu, ''Background to the 1737 "event" '']&lt;/ref&gt; or for the existence of an earthquake at all, it is this number that shows up in popular literature.&lt;ref name="freel"&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Quake+sleuth+%27saves%27+300%2c000+lives.+%28seismologist+Roger+Bilham...-a015187013 ''Quake sleuth 'saves' 300,000 lives.'']&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, the figure of 3,000 is only an estimation of the number of deaths inside the city itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdmumbai.gov.in/cycdisasters.htm Cyclone Related Disasters] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051025071035/http://www.imdmumbai.gov.in/cycdisasters.htm |date=October 25, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This apparent incongruity in the data suggests a possible mix-up with the numbers for the 1839 Coringa cyclone mentioned in this article, which also suggest 20,000 sunk ships and 300,000 fatalities. Both of these figures may stem from the 300,000 figure in the 1737 super cyclone in the West Bengal region, as neither one has similar numbers, according to the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100605095539/http://ncrmp.gov.in/ncrmp/AnnIIb.html National Cyclone Risk Mitigation Project's site].

===November 1867 Great Calcutta cyclone===
The anemometer in the city was blown away during the cyclone.  A lack of storm surge minimized the overall damage from this system.&lt;ref name="Calc"/&gt;

===October 1874 Bengal cyclone===
This severe cyclone killed 80,000&amp;nbsp;people and caused significant damage.&lt;ref name="disasterorissa"/&gt;

===October 1876 Backergunge cyclone===
{{main article|Great Backerganj Cyclone of 1876}}

===June 1885 Aden cyclone===
A cyclone had formed near the [[Laccadive Islands]] on May 24, {{convert|555|km|mi}} west of southern India.  The SS Mergui encountered the cyclone off the Horn of Africa, {{convert|400|km|mi}} east of [[Socotra]] on June 1 and reported it stronger than the tropical cyclone which struck Calcutta in 1864.  Just before midnight on the night of June 1, the Diomed reported winds of hurricane force and a pressure of {{convert|984|mb|inHg}}.  The ship Peshawar reported a westerly hurricane at the east end of the Gulf of Aden towards midnight on the night of June 2.  At noon on June 3, the Tantallon reported a pressure of {{convert|943|mb|inHg}} near 12.5N 45.5E.  On June 3, the German [[corvette]] Augusta, the French dispatch boat Renard, and the British ship SS Speke Hall were lost in the storm in the [[Gulf of Aden]].  The system continued westward and shrank in scale as it moved into the entrance of the [[Red Sea]], crossing the coast of [[Djibouti]].&lt;ref name="OmanTC"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Weather|volume=57|pages=247–255|date=July 2002|title=Monsoon Tropical Cyclones: Part 2|author=David Membery|number=7|publisher=[[Royal Meteorological Society]]|doi=10.1256/004316502760195911|bibcode = 2002Wthr...57..246M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1885 Odisha cyclone===
An intense cyclone struck Odisha.&lt;ref name="Orissa"/&gt;
it killed one person.

===June 1890 Muscat cyclone===
This system formed off the west coast of India during the first week of June and moved northwest towards the [[Arabian peninsula]].  Approaching the [[Gulf of Oman]], strong winds and heavy rains affected Sur during the afternoon on June 4.  Rain spread west that evening towards Muscat, where winds increased to hurricane-force from the north-northeast early on June 5.  The eye of the storm made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] at Sohar at dusk on June 5, eventually dissipating well inland.  Heavy rains fell at the hospital in Muscat, where {{convert|11.24|in|mm}} were recorded.  This led to flooding which took several hundred lives.  Several thousand date trees were uprooted by the storm's winds and carried away by its floods.  Several homes were leveled in Muscat and Mutrah.  Fifty perished from downing near the coast or being buried by debris.  Overall, 727&amp;nbsp;people lost their lives.&lt;ref name="OmanTC"/&gt;

A cyclone originating over the Arabian Sea left 500&amp;nbsp;fatalities in Bahrain.&lt;ref name="longshore"/&gt;

===May 1959 Salalah cyclone===
This system first became a [[low-pressure area]] near the Laccadive Islands on May 19, tracking northwest towards the Arabian peninsula.  The system made landfall at Raysut on May 24.  At Salalah, skies clouded over on May 23 as the pressure fell significantly.  Winds turned northerly before midnight that night.  At 1 a.m. on May 24 the peak of the storm's winds arrived.   [[Maximum sustained wind]]s were estimated at {{convert|70|kn|km/h}} and the pressure at Salalaha fell to {{convert|968|mb|inHg}}.  Many vessels offshore, including two large passenger ships, went to pieces.  Five buildings collapsed and several roofs were blown away by the cyclone.  Salalah recorded {{convert|82|mm|in}} of rain at their airport.  A total of 141&amp;nbsp;lives from the ship Samha were taken during this tempest.&lt;ref name="OmanTC"/&gt;

==1960s==

===1960===
[[File:1960 North Indian Ocean cyclone season summary map.png|thumb|right|Track map of all storms during the 1960 season]]
{{Main article|1960 North Indian Ocean cyclone season}}
Fifteen depressions developed during the course of the 1960 season, with five becoming cyclonic storms. The majority of activity took place in the Bay of Bengal, with eleven cyclones forming there. The season's first storm formed over the Arabian Sea on May 10. Though it remained over water for its entire existence, several vessels encountered the storm and reported hurricane-force winds as well as a pressure of 974 mbar (hPa; 28.77 inHg). The deadliest and most intense cyclone of the season was Severe Cyclonic Storm Ten, which killed 14,174 in East Pakistan in early November. Attaining peak winds estimated at 150&amp;nbsp;km/h (90&amp;nbsp;mph) and a pressure of 966.7 mbar (hPa; 28.55 inHg), it struck just three weeks after the previous system devastated the same area. Producing a 6.1&amp;nbsp;m (20&amp;nbsp;ft) storm tide that swept 16&amp;nbsp;km (10&amp;nbsp;mi) inland, several coastal islands were completely submerged. An estimated 200,000–300,000 were left homeless in the wake of the two storms. These systems marked the start of an unusually active period of cyclones impacting East Pakistan, culminating ten years later with the 1970 Bhola cyclone that killed 300,000–500,000 people. During the course of the season, several depressions impacted India, each producing heavy rain. Collectively, these systems killed 125 people.

;May Salalah cyclone
On May 19, a tropical disturbance formed over the Laccadive Islands, before tracking northwest towards the Arabian peninsula.  The system achieved cyclone intensity on May 22.  A [[United States Weather Bureau]] research flight flew into the {{convert|12|nmi|km}}-wide eye of the hurricane-strength system, and found a central pressure of {{convert|947|mb|inHg}}.  A ship {{convert|111|km|mi}} west of the system reported winds of {{convert|68|kn|km/h}}.  At Salalah, a strong northerly wind set in during the morning of May 25.  Later in the day, winds increased to [[gale]] force and a [[dust storm|sandstorm]] reduced visibility to {{convert|400|m|ft}}.  Later in the day of May 26 winds again increased to [[gale]] force and another sandstorm reduced visibility to {{convert|500|m|ft}}.  As winds increased to {{convert|60|kn|km/h}} the sandstorm became more severe, with visibility restricted to {{convert|50|m|ft}}.  Late on the night of the 26th, winds shifted to northeast and heavy rains fell across the region through the morning hours.  Skies remained cloudy with periods of rain into May 28.  A total of {{convert|230|mm|in}} was recorded at Salalah.&lt;ref name="OmanTC"/&gt;

The [[1970 Bhola cyclone]] was a devastating [[tropical cyclone]] that struck [[East Pakistan]] (now [[Bangladesh]]) and [[India]]'s [[West Bengal]] on November 12, 1970. It was the deadliest tropical cyclone ever recorded, and one of the deadliest [[natural disaster]]s in modern times.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60F16F7355F11738DDDAB0A94D9415B808BF1D3&amp;scp=2&amp;sq=east%20pakistaon%20cyclone%20deaths&amp;st=cse Disaster; East Pakistan: Cyclone May Be The Worst Catastrophe of Century] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111185714/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60F16F7355F11738DDDAB0A94D9415B808BF1D3&amp;scp=2&amp;sq=east%20pakistaon%20cyclone%20deaths&amp;st=cse |date=2013-11-11 }}" (pay article), ''The New York Times'', November 22, 1970, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; Up to 500,000&amp;nbsp;people lost their lives in the storm, primarily as a result of the [[storm surge]] that flooded much of the low-lying islands of the [[Ganges Delta]]. This cyclone was the sixth cyclonic storm of the [[1970 North Indian Ocean cyclone season]], and also the season's strongest, reaching a strength equivalent to a [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 3 hurricane]].

The cyclone formed over the central [[Bay of Bengal]] on November 8 and travelled north, intensifying as it did so. It reached its peak with winds of 185&amp;nbsp;km/h (115&amp;nbsp;mph) on November 12, and made landfall on the coast of East Pakistan that night. The storm surge devastated many of the offshore islands, wiping out villages and destroying crops throughout the region. In the most severely affected [[Upazilas of Bangladesh|Thana]], [[Tazumuddin Upazila|Tazumuddin]], over 45% of the population of 167,000 was killed by the storm.

The [[Pakistan]]i government was severely criticized for its handling of the relief operations following the storm, both by local political leaders in East Pakistan and in the international media. The opposition [[Awami League]] gained a [[landslide victory]] in the province, and continuing unrest between East Pakistan and the central government triggered the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]], which concluded with the creation of the country of Bangladesh.

'''Ramzi bin al-Shibh''' ({{lang-ar|رمزي بن الشيبة}}, {{transl|ar|''Ramzī bin ash-Shībah''}}; also [[transliteration|transliterated]] as '''bin al-Shaibah''') (born May 1, 1972&lt;ref name="indictment"&gt;[http://www.usdoj.gov/ag/moussaouiindictment.htm Indictment of Zacarias Moussaoui], with supporting conspirators, Ramzi bin al-Shibh and Mustafa al-Hawsawi. Filed in the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia]].&lt;/ref&gt;) is a Yemeni citizen being held by the U.S. as an [[enemy combatant]] detainee at [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay]] in Cuba. He is accused of being a "key facilitator for the [[September 11 attacks]]" in 2001 in the United States.&lt;ref name=odni14&gt;

In the mid-1990s, bin al-Shibh moved as a student to [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]], where he allegedly became close friends with [[Mohamed Atta]], [[Ziad Jarrah]] and [[Marwan al-Shehhi]]. Together, they are suspected of forming the [[Hamburg cell]] and becoming central perpetrators of the September 11 attacks. He was the only one of the four who failed to obtain a U.S. visa; he is accused of acting as an intermediary for the hijackers in the United States, by wiring money and passing on information from key [[al-Qaeda]] figures. After the attacks, bin al-Shibh was the first to be publicly identified by the U.S. as the "[[20th hijacker]]", of whom there have been several more possible candidates.

Bin al-Shibh has been in United States custody since he was captured on September 11, 2002, in [[Karachi|Karachi, Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;He was captured after a gun battle in Karachi with the Pakistani ISI and the CIA's Special Activities Division a year after the attacks.&lt;/ref&gt; He was held by the CIA in [[black sites]] in [[Morocco]] before being transferred to Guantanamo Bay in September 2006. Finally charged in 2008 before a military commission, he and several others suspected in the 9/11 attacks went to trial beginning in May 2012.

==Early life==
Ramzi bin al-Shibh was born in [[Hadhramaut]] province in [[Yemen]].&lt;ref name="odni14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mcdermott-p39"&gt;{{cite book |title=Perfect Soldiers |author=McDermott, Terry |publisher=Harper |year=2005 |pages=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was young, his family moved to a [[working class|working-class]] neighborhood in the capital, [[Sana'a]].&lt;ref name="mcdermott-p41"&gt;{{cite book |title=Perfect Soldiers |author=McDermott, Terry |publisher=Harper |year=2005 |pages=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, his father died. He was cared for by his older brother, Ahmed, and his mother.&lt;ref name="mcdermott-p41"/&gt;

In 1987, while still in high school, bin al-Shibh worked part-time as a clerk for the International Bank of Yemen.&lt;ref name="mcdermott-p42"&gt;{{cite book |title=Perfect Soldiers |author=McDermott, Terry |publisher=Harper |year=2005 |pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued working there until 1995.&lt;ref name="chapter5"/&gt;

Bin al-Shibh applied for a U.S. [[Visa (document)|visa]] in 1995, but his request was denied.&lt;ref name="chapter5"/&gt; He went to Germany, where he requested [[political asylum]], claiming that he was a political refugee from [[Sudan]]. He lived in [[Hamburg]] until 1997, when the judge refused his asylum request.&lt;ref name="chapter5"/&gt;

Bin al-Shibh returned to the [[Hadramaut]] region of Yemen. A short while later he received a German [[visa (document)|visa]] under his real name.&lt;ref name="chapter5"/&gt; While he was in Germany, bin al-Shibh used the name '''Ramzi Omar'''. In 1997, bin al-Shibh met [[Mohamed Atta]] at a [[mosque]]; he was the leader of the [[Hamburg cell]].&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2257456.stm |title=Ramzi Binalshibh: al-Qaeda suspect |publisher=BBC |date=September 14, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; For two years, Atta and bin al-Shibh were roommates in Germany.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;

==Al Qaeda training==
In late 1999, bin al-Shibh traveled to [[Kandahar]] in [[Afghanistan]], where he received training at [[al Qaeda]] camps. He met others involved in planning the [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;

==Attempts to come to the United States==
Original plans for the 9/11 attacks called for bin al-Shibh to be one of the hijacker pilots, along with three other members of the [[Hamburg cell]], including [[Mohamed Atta]], [[Marwan al-Shehhi]], and Ziad Jarrah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Perfect Soldiers |author=McDermott, Terry |publisher=Harper |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; From Hamburg, bin al-Shibh applied to take flight training in the United States. At that time, he also applied to Aviation Language Services, which provides language training for student pilots.&lt;ref name="moussaoui-march7"&gt;[http://cryptome.org/usa-v-zm-030706-02.htm ''Zacarias Moussauoi v. the United States''], trial testimony on March 7, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Bin al-Shibh applied for an entry visa to the United States, four times, and was refused each time. He made visa applications in Germany on May 17, 2000, and again in June, on September 16, and October 25, 2000.&lt;ref name="indictment"/&gt;&lt;ref name="moussaoui-march7"/&gt;

According to the [[9/11 Commission]], this refusal of a visa was motivated by general concern by U.S. officials at the time that people from Yemen, which was struggling economically, would illegally overstay their visit and seek work in the United States. His friend, [[Zakariyah Essabar]], was also denied visas. After failing to gain a visa to enter the United States, bin al-Shibh took on a "coordinator" role in the plot, serving as a link between Atta in the United States and [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]] in [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name="lateline"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/stories/s689774.htm |title=Al-Jazeera reporter speaks on terrorist plans |date=September 30, 2002 |publisher=Lateline / ABC (Australia)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cbs-20030305"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/10/09/60II/main524947.shtml |title=The Mastermind |date=March 5, 2003 |publisher=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connections to 9/11 attacks==

===Saeed al-Ghamdi===
According to the ''[[al-Jazeera]]'' reporter [[Yosri Fouda]]'s documentary, ''Top Secret: The Road to September 11'', three weeks prior to the attacks, [[Saeed al-Ghamdi]] is believed to have used the name "Abdul Rahman" to message bin al-Shibh online (who was posing as a girlfriend), writing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The first semester commences in three weeks. Two high schools and two universities. ... This summer will surely be hot ...19 certificates for private education and four exams. Regards to the professor. Goodbye.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This was said to be a reference to two military targets and two civilian, and 19 hijackers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/meast/09/12/alqaeda.911.claim/index.html http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/meast/09/12/alqaeda.911.claim/index.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060220124318/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/meast/09/12/alqaeda.911.claim/index.html |date=February 20, 2006 }}, CNN&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mohamed Atta===
Bin al-Shibh later said that [[Mohamed Atta]] had phoned him on the morning of August 29.

&lt;blockquote&gt;He said, 'A friend of mine gave me a puzzle and I want you to help me out.' I said to him, 'Is this the time for puzzles, Mohamed?' He said, 'Yes, I know, but no one else but you could help me.' He said, 'Two sticks, a dash and cake with a stick down. What is it?' I said, 'Did you wake me up just to tell me this?' As it turns out, two sticks is the number 11. A dash is a dash. And cake with a stick down is the number nine. And that was September 11.&lt;ref&gt;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0209/14/smn.09.html http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0209/14/smn.09.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Ziad Jarrah===
In August 2000, [[Ziad Jarrah]] tried to enroll bin al-Shibh in a [[Florida]] flight school.&lt;ref name="indictment"/&gt;

===Marwan al-Shehhi===
Bin al-Shibh sent money via [[wire transfer]] on September 25, 2000, to [[Marwan al-Shehhi]] in Florida.&lt;ref name="indictment"/&gt;

===Zacarias Moussaoui===
In August 2001, bin al-Shibh sent approximately $14,000 to [[Zacarias Moussaoui]], using the alias ''Ahad Sabet'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/LAW/08/07/inv.moussaoui.stolen.id/index.html |title=Motion: 9/11 conspiracy suspect may have used ID of Arizona doctor |date=August 7, 2002 |publisher=CNN |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111124454/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/LAW/08/07/inv.moussaoui.stolen.id/index.html |archivedate=November 11, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; a few days after receiving transfer of $15,000 from [[Hashim Abdulrahman]] in the [[United Arab Emirates]].&lt;ref name="indictment"/&gt;

===20th hijacker===
Bin al-Shibh was the first to be publicly identified by the United States as the "20th hijacker," someone who was thought to have been tasked to fill out the single missing slot among the four terrorist five-person teams. This spot was never filled. [[United Flight 93]] had four hijackers, not five, which is believed in part to have led to the success of the passenger revolt. The passengers likely caused the crash of the plane near [[Shanksville]], [[Pennsylvania]].

==Videos==
After January 14, 2002, bin al-Shibh was featured among five suspected al-Qaeda members on videos delivering what [[United States Attorney General]] [[John Ashcroft]] described as "[[martyrdom]] messages from [[suicide terrorism|suicide terrorists]]." [[NBC News]] said that the five videos had been recorded after the September 11 attacks.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

On September 8, 2006, al-Qaeda released a video that shows Osama bin Laden and some of the 9/11 hijackers. The tape identifies bin al-Shibh as the "coordinator of the 9/11 attacks" in its [[English language|English]] subtitles.&lt;ref name=NYDailyNews&gt;{{cite news|title=Video shows Osama and killers |publisher=New York Daily News |date=September 8, 2006 |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/450616p-379142c.html }} {{dead link|date=June 2016 |fix-attempted=yes|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video shows bin al-Shibh and other hijackers training in [[kickboxing]], as well as disarming and concealing weapons at a [[terrorist training camp]] in or near [[Kandahar, Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name=NYDailyNews /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Al-Qa'ida releases film showing Bin Laden with the hijackers |work=Belfast Telegraph |date=September 8, 2006 |url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/story.jsp?story=705570}} {{dead link|date=March 2017 |fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==FBI Most Wanted Terrorist List==
On January 17, 2002, the [[FBI]] published the first '''Most Wanted Terrorists Seeking Information''' list (now known as the [[FBI Seeking Information - War on Terrorism list|FBI's "Seeking Information - War on Terrorism" list]]). They identified the five wanted terrorists, about whom little was known but who were suspected of plotting additional terrorist attacks in martyrdom operations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/mostwant/seekinfo/seek.htm Most Wanted Terrorists Seeking Information], January 17, 2002, (dead link)&lt;/ref&gt; (see current version displaying photos of five terrorists on the remaining martyrdom videos FBI list, as of June 2006)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/terrorinfo/terseekinfomartyr.htm Martyrdom Messages/video, Seeking Information Alert] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805042335/https://www.fbi.gov/terrorinfo/terseekinfomartyr.htm |date=August 5, 2009 }} video clips published by the FBI January 17, 2002, and photos of remaining 5 terrorists, FBI archival after September 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Ramzi bin al-Shibh was one of the four men among the five whose names were known.

The other three are still featured in compiled video clips, in order of appearance, [[Muhammad Sa'id Ali Hasan]], [[Abdul Rahim Jenko|Abd al-Rahim]], and [[Khalid Ibn Muhammad al-Juhani]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/mpg/persons.mpg FBI Seeking Information - War on Terrorism, Martyrdom Messages/video Seeking Information Alert], VIDEO 2 minutes 11 seconds, mpg (29.1 mb)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mfile.akamai.com/6066/rm/www.fbi.gov/mpg/persons.rm FBI Seeking Information - War on Terrorism, Martyrdom Messages/video Seeking Information Alert], VIDEO 2 minutes 11 seconds, rm (229 kb - stream)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/mpg/persons_asf.asf FBI Seeking Information - War on Terrorism, Martyrdom Messages/video Seeking Information Alert], VIDEO 2 minutes 11 seconds, asf (371 kb - stream)&lt;/ref&gt; The fifth was identified a week later as ''Abderraouf Jdey'', alias ''Al-Rauf bin al-Habib bin Yousef al-Jiddi''.

Ashcroft said the five videotapes, shown by the FBI without sound, had been recovered from the rubble of the home of [[Mohammad Atef]] outside [[Kabul, Afghanistan]]. Ashcroft called upon people worldwide to help "identify, locate and incapacitate terrorists who are suspected of planning additional attacks against innocent civilians." The sound was left out to guard against the possibility that the messages contained signals for other terrorists. Ashcroft added that an analysis of the audio suggested "the men may be trained and prepared to commit future suicide terrorist acts." Ashcroft said not much was known about any of them except bin al-Shibh.

==Other attacks==
Ramzi bin al-Shibh is suspected of having been involved in the 2000 [[USS Cole bombing|USS ''Cole'' bombing]], and the 2002 [[Ghriba synagogue bombing]] in [[Tunisia]].&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;

==Capture and detention==
{{wikisource|CSRT Summary of Evidence memo for Ramzi Binalshibh}}

Bin al-Shibh was captured in Pakistan on September 11, 2002, after a gun battle in [[Karachi]] with the Pakistani [[Inter-Services Intelligence|ISI]] and the [[CIA]]'s [[Special Activities Division]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/17/AR2007121702151.html&lt;/ref&gt; On September 14, 2002, he was transferred to the United States. CIA officers transported him by [[extraordinary rendition]] to a secret [[black site]] in [[Morocco]] for [[interrogation]]. The CIA admitted in August 2010 that it has video tapes of these interrogations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/cia-tapes-prove-morocco-rendition/story-e6frg6so-1225907071320 |title=CIA tapes prove Morocco rendition |date=August 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/clara-gutteridge/new-cia-interrogation-tap_b_686897.html |work=Huffington Post |first=Clara |last=Gutteridge |title=New CIA Interrogation Tapes Hint at Legal 'Loophole' Allowing the US to Outsource Torture |date=October 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/south/09/16/alqaeda.pakistan/ |title=Binalshibh to go to third country for questioning |publisher=CNN |date=September 17, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His profile was removed from the FBI Seeking Information wanted list by October 17, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20021017112003/http://www.fbi.gov/terrorinfo/terseekinfo.htm FBI Seeking Information archive], Internet Archive Wayback Machine, October 17, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Bin al-Shibh was held by the U.S. at an undisclosed CIA-led location until September 2006. On September 6, 2006, [[U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]] announced that bin al-Shibh and thirteen other CIA-held, [[high-value detainees]] had been transferred to [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]].

Bin al-Shibh is also wanted by German courts; he had shared a [[Hamburg]] apartment with [[Mohamed Atta]], the suspected ringleader of the [[September 11 attacks|September 11]] hijackers. In 2005, the USA denied a German request for bin al-Shibh's [[extradition]]. In an earlier extradition and trial, [[Abdelghani Mzoudi]], a 9/11 suspect, was acquitted of German charges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://file.wikileaks.org/file/us-cia-redcell-exporter-of-terrorism-2010.pdf CIA Red Cell Memorandum - 2 Feb 2010], CIA Red Cell Memorandum on United States "exporting terrorism"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegations===
The allegations prepared for the first 558 captives whose status was examined by Combatant Status Review Tribunals (CSRT), between August 2004 and January 2005, were broken into two sections: those that established a connection to [[terrorism]], and those that established hostile activity. The allegations were numbered, and were generally only one or two sentences in length.

The allegations against Ramzi bin al-Shibh are as follows:

{{quote|On the morning of 11 September 2001, four airliners traveling over the United States were hijacked. The flights hijacked were: [[American Airlines Flight 11]], [[United Airlines Flight 175]], [[American Airlines Flight 77]], and [[United Airlines Flight 93]]. At approximately 8:46 a.m., American Airlines Flight 11 crashed into the North Tower of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]], resulting in the collapse of the tower at approximately 10:25 a.m. At approximately 9:03 a.m., United Airlines Flight 175 crashed into the South Tower of the World Trade Center, resulting in the collapse of the tower at approximately 9:55 a.m. At approximately 9:37., American Airlines Flight 77 crashed into the southwest side of [[the Pentagon]] in [[Arlington, Virginia|Arlington Virginia]]. At approximately 10:03 a.m. United Airlines Flight 93 crashed in Stoney Creek Township Pennsylvania. These crashed and subsequent damage to the World Trade Center and the Pentagon resulted in the deaths of 2972 persons in [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Virginia]], and [[Pennsylvania]].

According to court transcripts and evidence from ''[[United States v. Zacarias Moussaoui]]'', the detainee was closely associated with three of the hijackers responsible for the "9/11" attacks, [[Mohamed Atta]], [[Marwan al-Shehhi]] and Ziad Jarrah, while they lived in [[Hamburg]] during the late 1990s and early 2000. The detainee, Atta and Shehhi are known to have lived at or frequented on particular address during the same time period, 54 Marienstrasse, Hamburg, Germany 21073.

Airline and immigration records indicate that from November 1999 through February 2000, the detainee, Mohamed Atta, Marwan al-Shehhi and Ziad Jarrah all traveled from Germany to Pakistan.

[[Saif al-Adel|Sayf al-Adl]] is a senior al Qaida military commander with a long-term relationship with [[Usama bin Laden]]; Sayf al-Adl's role in the organization has been as a trainer, military leader, and key member of Usama bin Laden's security detail.

The diary of Sayf al-Adl was recovered during a raid in [[Saudi Arabia]] in 2004. The diary details the detainee's involvement in the 11 September 2001 terrorist plot and subsequent attack. The detainee is listed as a "highly professional [[jihadist]]" along with "9/11 hijackers", Mohamed Atta and Ziad Jarrah. The diary states that the three were briefed on an operation involving aircraft by [[Abu Hafs]], a senior al Qaida planner. The detainee, Mohamed Atta, and Ziad Jarrah subsequently met with Usama bin Laden about the plan. Following the meeting, al Qaida began arrangements for the detainee, Mohamed Atta and Ziad Jarrah to receive pilot training. The detainee handled administrative details for the "9/11 hijackers" while they were in the United States and the detainee served as an al Qaida Europe based liaison.

The detainee was identified in a video tape of potential suicide operatives.

The detainee attempted to obtain a United States visa on four occasions from May 2000 to November 2000 for the purpose of attending flight school in the United States. Each application was rejected by ''{{sic}}'' [[United States Department of State]].

The detainee attempted to enroll in the Florida Flight Training School, where 9/11 hijacker Ziad Jarrah was a student. The detainee put down a 2,350 United States dollars ''{{sic}}'' deposit for flight training.

Ziad Jarrah repeatedly attempted to assist the detainee's travel to the United States and enrollment in the Florida flight training center.

The detainee attempted to enroll at the ''{{sic}}'' Florida-based aviation language school.

The detainee, while in Germany, wired 9/11 hijacker Marwan al-Shehi, who was in the United States 2708.33 ''{{sic}}'' United States dollars ''{{sic}}'' on 13 June 2000 via [[MoneyGram]].

The detainee, while in Germany, wired 9/11 hijacker Marwan al-Shehhi, who was in the United States) ''{{sic}}'' 1760.61 ''{{sic}}'' United States dollars on 26 July 2000 via [[Western Union]].

The detainee, while in Germany, wired 9/11 hijacker Marwan al-Shehhi who was in the United States) ''{{sic}}'' 4,118.13 ''{{sic}}'' United States dollars on 25 September 2000 via Western Union.

in June 2002, the detainee was personally interviewed by [[Yosri Fouda]], an investigative journalist for [[Al-Jazeera]] television. The interview took place over the course of 48 hours in [[Karachi, Pakistan]]. Also present at the meeting was [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]], a senior al Qaida planner. Fouda conducted the interview in person with both the detainee and KSM. The detainee and KSM detailed how the 9/11 attacks were planned and executed during the course of the interview. KSM identified the detainee as the coordinator of the 9/11 attacks. The detainee displayed items he claimed were "souvenirs" of the 9/11 attacks. The items included: an air navigation map of the American eastern seaboard, flight simulator CD-Roms and Boeing manuals and a flight instruction book the detainee claimed had 9/11 hijacker Mohamed Atta's handwritten notes. The detainee stated Mohamed Atta left them in the Hamburg, Germany, apartment he shared with the detainee. The detainee stated that he later met with Atta in July, 2001 in [[Madrid|Madrid, Spain]], to finalize the operational details of the 9/11 plot. The detainee stated he received a phone call on 29 August 2001 from Atta that gave the date for the 9/11 attacks. After learning this, the detainee ordered active al Qaida cells in Europe and elsewhere to evacuate and then he fled to Pakistan.

An unsigned letter found at the detainee's point of capture, and addressed to the detainee, asks follow on questions related to the detainee's Al-Jazeera interview detailing the 9/11 attacks.

An article from the London ''[[Sunday Times]]'' published on 8 September 2002 listed excerpts from a 112 page document entitled "The Reality of the New Crusaders' War". The detainee passed the document to Al-Jazeera Yosri Fouda with a request for the document to be translated into English and entered into the [[Library of Congress]]. According to the London ''Sunday Times'' the document is al Qaida's written attempt to justify the 9/11 attacks through [[Islam]]ic teaching.

The London ''Sunday Times'' article published on 8 September 2002 listed excerpts from "The Reality of the New Crusaders' War" which contained statements from Taliban leader Mullah [[Mohammed Omar]] and Usama bin Laden which encourages [[jihad]] in service of the ousted [[Taliban]] regime.

The detainee was captured in a safe house. Items also recovered at the safe house at the time of the detainee's capture were high explosives, sheet explosives, a large quantity of improvised detonation devices, passports for Usama bin Laden's family members, a handwritten note to a senior al Qaida operative, identification cards for a senior al Qaida operative, identification cards for [[Ahmed al-Haznawi]], a 9/11 hijacker, and contact information for several known al Qaida operatives.

Documents captured in a raid of a separate al Qaida safe house were identical to documents captured alnong with the detainee. The documents included training manuals, security information and combat related subjects.

Letters and personal effect of a senior al Qaida operative were discovered in the safe house where the detainee was arrested.

Letters found at the detainee's point of capture detailed a plan to egress Pakistan with [[forgery|forged]] identification. This plan was in conjunction with a senior al Qaida operative.

A letter captured on an al Qaida courier detailed a senior al Qaida operative's instructions to the detainee to identify operatives to send to the United States or United Kingdom.

The detainee wired approximately 15,000 United States dollars to Zacharias Moussaoui while Moussaoui was enrolled in pilot training.}}

==Habeas petition==
On June 12, 2008, the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled, in ''[[Boumediene v. Bush]]'' (2008), that detainees had the right to access the federal court system in ''[[habeas]]'' challenges to their detention. It ruled that the [[Military Commissions Act of 2006]], which had restricted their exercise of habeas corpus outside the military commission system, was unconstitutional in this respect. The first 22 captives who had pending [[habeas corpus|habeas]] petitions in 2006 when the Act was passed, were allowed to re-initiate their petitions in August 2008.&lt;ref name=HabeasAmendedandOtherFactualReturnsFiledAugust2008&gt;

==Guantanamo military commission==
Bin al-Shibh and four other captives classified as [[high value detainees]] ([[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]], [[Mustafa al-Hawsawi]], [[Ammar al-Baluchi]] and [[Walid Bin Attash]]) were charged in [[Guantanamo military commission]]s in Spring 2008. The men triggered controversy when they announced that they did not want US-appointed attorneys and they planned to boycott their commissions. The military commissions, as authorized by President [[George W. Bush]], did not permit suspects to forgo legal representation, to act as their own attorneys, or to boycott their commissions. The commissions authorized by the [[Military Commissions Act of 2006]], did authorize suspects to serve as their own attorneys.

The other four men eventually agreed to attend their commissions. Bin al-Shibh, however, has continued to refuse to attend. His appointed attorneys had expressed concern about him and his state of mental health. The top-secret location of [[camp 7 (Guantanamo)|Camp 7]], where the high-value detainees are held, had been off limits to military attorneys. The individual detainees are hooded when they travel from the camp to their commission hearings.

[[Suzanne Lachelier]] offered to wear a hood in order to be taken to him, but the camp authorities initially refused. She finally gained approval in 2008 to visit al-Shibh, together with her co-counsel. They traveled in a windowless van, which was used to transport prisoners. She was the first defense lawyer to visit Camp 7.

The judge presiding over the commission's pre-trial motions ordered bin al-Shibh and Mustafa al-Hawsawi to undergo [[competency evaluation (law)|mental competency hearings]]. On December 8, 2008, [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]] told the judge that he and the other four men who had been indicted wished to confess and plead guilty; however, the plea would be delayed until after the competency hearings for bin al-Shibh and Hawsawi. All five men wanted to make their pleas together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Top 9/11 suspects to plead guilty |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7770856.stm |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=December 8, 2008 |accessdate=December 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the lawyers of Bin al-Shibh argued that he may be unfit to stand trial and participate in his own defense. They have asked that the proceedings against him and his four co-accused be stayed until his mental state is determined. They say he has been prescribed [[psychotropic]] drugs of the sort that are used to treat [[schizophrenia]]. Bin al-Shibh claims that he is mentally fit, has denounced his lawyers, and says that he wants to represent himself before the commissions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/news/2011/05/31/ramzi-bin-al-shibh "Ramzi bin al-Shibh"], Human Rights Watch, 31 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, the US began the trials of al-Shibh and the other four 9/11 defendants.

On January 31, 2014, [[Carol Rosenberg]], reporting in the ''[[Miami Herald]]'', wrote that Pohl had to delay al-Shibh's trial again, because the panel of three military psychiatrists who tried to determine whether he was mentally competent to stand trial had not been able to reach a conclusion.&lt;ref name=MiamiHerald2014-01-31&gt;

{{Wikisourcepar2|Rogers_Plan|Rogers Plan (1969)}}
The '''Rogers Plan''' (also known as '''Deep Strike''')&lt;ref&gt;Herbert I. London. [https://books.google.com/books?id=gVVLAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Rogers+Plan Military Doctrine and the American Character: Reflections on AirLand Battle], 1984, p. 48, {{ISBN|0-88738-614-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was a framework proposed by [[United States Secretary of State]] [[William P. Rogers]] to achieve an end to belligerence in the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] following the [[Six-Day War]] and the continuing [[War of Attrition]]. The plan was publicly proposed in a December 9, 1969 speech at an Adult Education conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Foreign+Relations/Israels+Foreign+Relations+since+1947/1947-1974/9+Statement+by+Secretary+of+State+Rogers-+9+Decemb.htm |title=Statement by Secretary of State Rogers- 9 December 1969 |publisher=[[Foreign Affairs Minister of Israel|Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RabinovichShakedp10"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Itamar Rabinovich|author2=Haim Shaked|title=From June to October: The Middle East Between 1967 And 1973|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vNQ3K5HfiHAC&amp;pg=PA192|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-1-4128-2418-7|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The December 1969 speech followed the failure of the [[Jarring Mission]] to negotiate an implementation plan for [[UN Security Council Resolution 242]] among the principals in the Six-Day War.

Some of the points included in Rogers' ten-point paper called for the following:
* Negotiations under [[Gunnar Jarring]]'s auspices following procedures used in the 1949 meetings on Rhodes;
* Israeli withdrawal from Egyptian territory occupied in the war;
* A binding commitment by Israel and Egypt to maintain peace with each other
* Negotiations between Israel and Egypt for agreement on areas to be demilitarized, measures to guarantee free passage through the Gulf of Aqaba, and security arrangements for Gaza;&lt;ref name="Morris2011p354" /&gt;

== Stalemate and complications in negotiations ==
Failure of the [[Jarring Mission]] and the mediated peace talks reflected a long-standing stalemate between Israel and Egypt. Whereas Israel demanded a formal recognition of its sovereignty, gained via direct peace talks with Egypt, Egypt would only agree to offer a peace sponsored by the third-party United Nations (this would allow Egypt to avoid political fallout from the Arab nations, which were strongly opposed to recognition of Israel). In addition to this peace, Israel would return all land to Egypt.&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;Smith 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Both parties viewed the conflicting interests as a stalemate only to be resolved via military intimidation.&lt;ref name="smith" /&gt; Whereas the US government view hoped to use promises of arms to gain Israeli concessions on land, Israel desired arms to secure the land it refused to give up.&lt;ref name="smith" /&gt;

Negotiations leading up to Rogers' plan were complicated not only by hostilities between Israel and Egypt, but also by the differing philosophies adopted by the Soviet Union and the United States in approaching the negotiations. Soviet strategy during the peace talks had been to "bring the Egyptians with them every step of the way. American strategy was wholly different. There was never any question of trying to persuade the Israelis to endorse each American move as it was made. To secure Israel's agreement the Americans calculated that they would first have to have that of Egypt and the Soviet Union".&lt;ref name="search.ebscohost.com"&gt;[http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=hia&amp;AN=H000321093.01&amp;site=ehost-live]&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, though both Israeli Prime Minister [[Golda Meir]] and Israeli Ambassador to the United States [[Yitzhak Rabin]] had conferred with U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] in the last few months of 1969, Rogers' speech was viewed as a surprise.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

[[Israel]] rejected the plan on December 10, 1969, calling it "an attempt to appease [the Arabs] at the expense of Israel. The Soviets dismissed it as "one-sided" and "pro-Israeli." President Nasser rejected it because it was a separate deal with Israel even if [[Egypt]] recovered all of [[Sinai]].&lt;ref name="Morris2011p354"&gt;{{cite book|author=Benny Morris|title=Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881–1998|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jGtVsBne7PgC|date=25 May 2011|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-78805-4|page=354|quote=The Israeli cabinet publicly rejected the plan in communiques issued on December 10 and 22, calling it "an attempt to appease [the Arabs] at the expense of Israel." ...But it was Egypt and the USSR who in fact definitively shot down the plan.

Nasser rejected a separate deal with Israel (even if he recovered all of Sinai) as well as demilitarization of the peninsula after Israeli withdrawal, freedom of maritime passage for Israeli vessels, and various security arrangements—all stipulated in the Rogers Plan as part of the quid pro quo. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=REPORT OF THE SECRETARY-GENERAL UNDER SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 331 (1973) OF 20 APRIL 1973|url=https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/AB8F787D075D3588052565540073C865|publisher=UNITED NATIONS, Security Council|ref=S/10929|date=18 May 1973|quote=THE SEARCH FOR A SETTLEMENT from 1967 to date|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407091644/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/AB8F787D075D3588052565540073C865|archivedate=7 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Six-Day War (1967) and the War of Attrition (1967–1970) ==
In an unsuccessful attempt to draw the UN intervention following the cease-fire which ended the Six Day War, the Egyptians launched a new round of artillery duels with Israeli forces.&lt;ref name="smith" /&gt; While Secretary Rogers pursued his peace plan, Pres. [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] of Egypt, with the assistance of three brigades of Soviet troops,&lt;ref&gt;''Confronting the Costs of War'', Michael N. Barnett, p. 125, Princeton University Press, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; rapidly escalated the [[War of Attrition]] against Israeli forces at the [[Suez Canal]] in an attempt to inflict maximum casualties on Israeli forces.

== Aftermath: historical implications ==
On June 1970, Rogers initiated a ceasefire plan, sometimes called the Second Rogers Plan&lt;ref name="knesset.gov.il"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Rogers Plan- an American peace plan for the Middle East.|url=http://www.knesset.gov.il/lexicon/eng/rogers_eng.htm|publisher=The Israeli Knesset (parliament) site|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morris 2011 p. 360&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RabinovichShakedp14"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Itamar Rabinovich|author2=Haim Shaked|title=From June to October: The Middle East Between 1967 And 1973|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vNQ3K5HfiHAC&amp;pg=PA192|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-1-4128-2418-7|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt accepted the ceasefire plan. Israel eventually accepted it, which had resulted in the right-wing [[Gahal]] party leaving [[Golda Meir]]'s [[Fifteenth government of Israel|government]] in August 1970. The acceptance had resulted in the August 7, 1970, "in place" cease-fire.

According to the cease-fire agreement, both sides were required not to change "the military status quo within zones extending 50 km to the east and west of the cease-fire line." Although forbidden in the ceasefire agreement, Egypt immediately moved anti-aircraft batteries into the zone. By October there were about 100 SAM sites in the zone, and Rogers made no diplomatic effort to secure their removal. He thus had little credibility in Israel, and the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]] eventually occurred.

Israeli military assertiveness resulted in a political setback with the United States, but Nasser had gained a respite that enabled him to consolidate his missile defense systems that had grown out from the war.&lt;ref name="Smith 2006 p. 318"&gt;Smith 2006 p. 318&lt;/ref&gt; Nasser also used the negotiations as a way of opening the lines of communication with the United States to counter his growing reliance on the Soviet Union. The PLO was shocked and angered by the agreement, which led for Habash and Hawatmah attempts to overthrow [[King Hussein]]. The actions led to the [[Black September in Jordan|Black September]], a civil war that broke out in Jordan on September 16, 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 2001 p. 320&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1971, Rogers initiated a plan for an interim agreement across the Canal, which is sometimes called the "Third Rogers Plan."&lt;name="knesset.gov.il" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morris 2011 p. 389&lt;/ref&gt;

Nixon's National Security Advisor [[Henry Kissinger]] is to the right of Nixon.]]

No breakthrough occurred, even after Sadat, in a surprise move, suddenly expelling Soviet advisers from Egypt and again signaled to Washington his willingness to negotiate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Camp David Accords: A Case of International Bargaining |author=Shibley Telhami |publisher=Columbia International Affairs Online |url=http://www.ciaonet.org/casestudy/tes01/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 28 February 1973, during a visit in [[Washington, D.C.]], Meir agreed with [[Henry Kissinger]]'s peace proposal based on "security versus sovereignty:" [[Israel]] would accept Egyptian sovereignty over all [[Sinai]], and [[Egypt]] would accept Israeli presence in some of Sinai strategic positions.&lt;ref name="Rabin1996p215" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kissinger2011p252" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kumaraswamy2013p105" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Parker2001p64" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Spiegel1986p237" /&gt;

Sadat continued the trend by both standing by the Rogers Plan and kicking out the pro-Soviet group of Ali Sabry in April 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=3012270 |pages=3–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unlikely, however, that the United States viewed the relations the same way since the State Department's focus was competition with the Soviet Union, as opposed to regional conflicts.&lt;ref name="Smith 2006 p. 318" /&gt; The resolution also exacerbated the divisions between Kissinger and Rogers, and the Middle Eastern countries saw that the goals of American foreign policy were different. Kissinger did not want to involve the Soviet Union or any Arab countries friendly to them; in hopes they would turn to the United States and reject the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 2006 p. 320&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel used that in hopes of preventing all peace talks, which could have resulted in getting greater land capitulations from Arab countries due to Israel's military strength.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 2006 p.320&lt;/ref&gt; Nasser forestalled any movement toward direct negotiations with Israel. In dozens of speeches and statements, Nasser posited the equation that any direct peace talks with Israel were tantamount to surrender.&lt;ref name="RabinovichShakedp192"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Itamar Rabinovich|author2=Haim Shaked|title=From June to October: The Middle East Between 1967 And 1973|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vNQ3K5HfiHAC&amp;pg=PA192|publisher=Transaction Publishers |isbn=978-1-4128-2418-7 |page=192|quote=In dozens of speeches and statements, Nasser posited the equation that any direct peace talks with Israel were tantamount to surrender.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5335">The '''Roller Coaster Yard Sale''', sometimes referred to as the '''Roller Coaster Fair''', is an outdoor [[second-hand]] sale held annually for three days beginning the first Thursday in October. It takes place along several US and state routes in southern [[Kentucky]] and northern middle [[Tennessee]].

==Event description and history==
The event was started by Sarah Ann Bowers in 1986. The reason that Bowers started the event is that she wanted to improve the beautiful Cordell Hull Highway (KY Routes 63 &amp; 90 in Barren County) and needed to prove that the road was very well traveled in the area.&lt;ref name="Cordel Hull Highway"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fleamarket.about.com/od/multimileyardsaleevents/p/Roller-Coaster-Yard-Sale-Kentucky-And-Tennessee.htm|title=Roller Coaster Yard Sale - Kentucky and Tennessee|author=Leah French|work=About.com Home|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, over 140,000 travelers visited the area from miles around just to take in yard sales along the specific routes.

In 2002, the yard sale routes extended into [[Clay County, Tennessee|Clay]], [[Overton County, Tennessee|Overton]], and [[Pickett County, Tennessee|Pickett]] counties in [[Middle Tennessee]]. Soon after that US 127 in [[Clinton County, Kentucky]] and [[Kentucky Route 90]] from Clinton County through Burkesville to Glasgow and Cave City, Kentucky were added to the Roller Coaster Fair itinerary to make the event go completely around the [[Dale Hollow Lake]] area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1697&amp;dat=20031002&amp;id=bikqAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NkgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3626,155813|title=Park City Daily News - Google News Archive Search|work=google.com|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current [[Garage sale|yard sale]] route for this event, in terms of mileage, in the present day, totals about 159 miles (255&amp;nbsp;km), covering five counties in Kentucky and three counties in Tennessee.

== Design ==

The Rolling Stars and Planets are spherical art objects, standardized in size and basic material, but individually designed by each artist. The globes are painted, or designed as objects.
The circumfluent frame, concepted by Ledersberger-Lehoczky, consist of ring-shaped [[Aluminium]]-hoops with a diameter of about 100&amp;nbsp;cm. This frame is associated with the orbits of [[Celestial bodies]]. It provides the reservation of the artworks and allaviates the moving.

The inner Parts with a diameter of about 75&amp;nbsp;cm have been designed by the artist individually using themes like [[Astronomy]], [[Astrology]], [[Mythology]] and [[Legend]]s.

== Development ==

In Autumn 2008 Ledersberger-Lehoczky and István Jankovics organized an [[Symposium]] in the ''Gothard Observatorium of Astrophysics'' of the [[Eötvös Loránd University]] in [[Szombathely]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gothard.hu/observatory/observatory-en.html GAO Szombathely] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306194539/http://www.gothard.hu/observatory/observatory-en.html |date=2009-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main Theme was "Men in space". During this event sculptures of five sculptors have been shown. During the "Planetra Science Congress" 2008 in [[Münster]] Ledersberger-Lehoczky presented an art project which was decided to accompany the Year of Astronomy 2009.

A collective action with individual designed sphere-objects was arranged during a meeting in Vienna between Günther Frank and Elisabeth Ledersberger-Lehoczky. Günther Frank suggested the moving of the globes in public spaces.

In the Year of Astronomy 2009 25 visual artists, many of them members of the Austrian association of professional art in Vienna and Graz, designed spherical paintings and objects. The artists used techniques like [[Painting]], [[Collage]] or Object Art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.aon.at/art-bv/team.htm Austrian association of professional art] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402064643/http://members.aon.at/art-bv/team.htm |date=2010-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adapted to each globe painting the executing artist made a description, in which he declared his technique and the matter of his artwork.

The first event started on April 4, 2009 in front of the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum|Kunsthistorischen Museum]] in Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;TV-report in [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]]-Vienna&lt;/ref&gt; The artists rolled their artworks around the [[Maria Theresia]]-monument.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waa.at/bericht/2009/04/20090402-05-100hrs/20090404nhm.html Rolling Stars and Planets event in front of the Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Report in ORF, April 4th 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009 the ''BiondekBühne Theater- und Tanzwerkstatt'' in [[Baden]] near Vienna created a [[choreography]] for a group of 14 dancers, the "Ladies-First-Ladies". This choreografy concerned with the Rolling Stars and Planets was shown in Baden and in Linz while this City was [[European Capital of Culture]].
The performancers ''SF - SlowForward'' showed the choreography "Breath of the Cosmos", which had been especially created for the Rolling Stars and Plandets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waa.at/bericht/2009/04/20090402-05-100hrs/20090404nhm.html Slow Forward: Breath of the Cosmos (Dancing Planets) April 4th 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Linz September 3, 2009&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.aon.at/art-bv/Dokumente/Rolling_Stars_Linz0309.pdf SlowForward in Linz September 3rd 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100508032848/http://members.aon.at/art-bv/Dokumente/Rolling_Stars_Linz0309.pdf |date=2010-05-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Salvatore''' "'''Sam'''" '''Giancana''' (né '''Giangana'''; June 15, 1908 &amp;ndash; June 19, 1975),&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave|2651|Sam Giancana (Original name: Salvatore Giancana)|accessdate=October 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Sicilian American]] [[mobster]], notable as being boss of the criminal [[Chicago Outfit]] from 1957–1966. His nicknames were "Mooney", "Momo", "Sam the Cigar", and "Sammy".

==Early life==
Giancana was born Salvatore Giangana, in [[West Town, Chicago|The Patch]] on Chicago's West Side, to Italian [[Sicily#Demographics|Sicilian]] immigrants from [[Partanna]], in the [[province of Trapani]]. His father, Antonino (later simplified to Antonio) Giangana, owned a pushcart and later briefly owned an [[Italian ice]] shop, which was later firebombed by [[Organized crime|criminal]] rivals of his son.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

==Criminal career==
Sam Giancana joined the 42 Gang, a juvenile street crew working for [[political boss]] [[Joseph Esposito (mobster)|Joseph Esposito]]. (The name of the 42 Gang came from associating themselves with [[Ali Baba]] and the 40 Thieves. They thought they were one better, hence 42). Giancana soon developed a reputation for being an excellent [[crime scene getaway|getaway driver]], a high earner, and a vicious killer. After Esposito's murder, in which Giancana was allegedly involved, the 42 Gang was transformed into a ''de facto'' extension of the [[Chicago Outfit]].  The Outfit was initially wary of the 42ers, thinking they were too wild.  However, Giancana's reputation gained him the notice of Outfit leaders such as [[Frank Nitti|Frank "The Enforcer" Nitti]], [[Paul Ricca|Paul "The Waiter" Ricca]], and [[Tony Accardo|Tony "Joe Batters" Accardo]]. He was arrested for the first time during 1925, for auto theft. He soon graduated to "triggerman", and by the age of 20 had been the prime subject of three murder investigations, but was never tried for any of them.&lt;ref name=Biography&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/sam-giancana-9542088|title=Sam Giancana on Biography.com|website=biography.com|accessdate=May 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the late 1930s, Giancana became the first 42er to join the Chicago Outfit. From the early 1940s through the 1950s, he controlled most of the illegal gambling, illegal liquor distribution, and numerous other political rackets in Louisiana through longtime friend H.A. (Hol) Killian. Killian controlled the majority of the liquor license issuance by his associations with longtime business associate Carlos Marcello from New Orleans.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==Family==
Giancana married Angelina DeTolve, the daughter of immigrants from the Italian region of [[Basilicata]], on September 23, 1933. They had three daughters, Antoinette, Bonnie, and Francine. His wife died during 1954, leaving him to raise his daughters. Giancana never remarried and was known as a good family man, despite frequent infidelities. All of the Giancana daughters have married at least once. {{as of|1984}}, at least one daughter, Antoinette, had taken the "Giancana" name again following her divorce.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Giancana1984|Giancana 1984]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rise to power==
During 1945, after serving a sentence at the [[Federal Correctional Complex, Terre Haute]], [[Indiana]] (during which time he told his children he was away "at college"), Giancana made a name for himself by convincing Accardo, then the Outfit's underboss, to stage a take-over of Chicago's [[African-American]] "[[Numbers game|policy]]" (lottery) pay-out system for The Outfit. Giancana's crew is believed to have been responsible for convincing Eddie Jones to quit his [[Racket (crime)|racket]] and leave the country. Giancana's crew was also responsible for the murder on August 4, 1952 of African-American gambling boss [[Theodore Roe]]. Both Jones and Roe were major [[South Side, Chicago|South Side]] gambling bosses. However, Roe had refused to surrender control of his operation as the Outfit had demanded, and on June 19, 1951, Roe fatally shot Lennard "Fat Lennie" Caifano, a [[made man]] of Giancana's crew.&lt;ref&gt;Ron Chepesiuk, ''Black Gangsters of Chicago'', Barricade Books, 2007. Page 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the South Side "policy"-game takeover by the Outfit was not complete until another Outfit member, [[Jackie Cerone|Jackie "the Lackey" Cerone]], scared "Big Jim" Martin to Mexico with two bullets to the head that did not kill him. When the lottery money started rolling in for the Outfit after this gambling war, the amount that this game had produced for the Outfit was in the millions of dollars a year and brought Giancana further notice. It is believed to have been a major factor in his being "anointed" as the Outfit's new boss when Accardo resigned from being the front boss to becoming ''[[consigliere]]'', during 1957.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Roemer1995|Roemer 1995]], pp.125-129.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was generally understood that Accardo and Ricca still had the real power. Giancana was required to consult Accardo and Ricca on all important Outfit affairs.  No major business transactions, and certainly no "[[contract killing|hits]]," were performed without Accardo and Ricca's approval.

Giancana was present at the Mafia's 1957 [[Apalachin meeting]] at the [[Upstate New York]] estate of [[Joseph Barbara (mobster)|Joseph Barbara]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Giancana1984|Giancana 1984]], pp. 190, 195-197.&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, [[Buffalo crime family|Buffalo crime boss]] [[Stefano Magaddino]] and Giancana were overheard by wiretap saying the meeting should have occurred in the Chicago area. Giancana claimed that the Chicago area was "the safest place in the world" for a major underworld meeting because he had several police chiefs on his payroll. If the syndicate ever wanted to hold a meeting in or around Chicago, Giancana said, they had nothing to fear because they had the area "locked up tight".&lt;ref name="MafEnc"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Mafia Encyclopedia |last=Sifakis |first=Carl |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1987 |publisher=Facts on File |location=New York City |isbn=0-8160-1856-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some journalists claimed that Giancana and his Chicago crime syndicate "played a role" in [[John F. Kennedy]]'s victory in the [[United States presidential election, 1960|1960 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| url = http://www.slate.com/id/91350/| last = Greenberg| first = David| title = Was Nixon Robbed?| journal = [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]| date = October 16, 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/oct/07/michaelellison Sinatra was 'go-between for Mafia and JFK']". ''The Guardian.'' October 7, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alleged CIA connections==
It is widely reputed and partially corroborated by the [[Church Committee]] hearings, that during the [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] administration, the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) recruited Giancana and other mobsters to assassinate [[Fidel Castro]]. Giancana reportedly said that the CIA and the Cosa Nostra were "different sides of the same coin".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Giancana1992|Giancana 1992]], p.215.&lt;/ref&gt; Documents released in 2017 showed the Sam Giancana connection to the CIA and to [[Robert Maheu]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

[[Judith Exner]] claimed to be the mistress of both Giancana and JFK, and that she delivered communications between the two regarding Fidel Castro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Exner File. (Judith Campbell Exner, John F. Kennedy's mistress) |author=Michael O'Brien |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-58170292.html |publisher=[[Washington Monthly]] |date=1999-12-01 |accessdate=2008-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311060259/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-58170292.html |archivedate=March 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Giancana's daughter, Antoinette Giancana, has stated her belief that her father was performing a scam to pocket millions of dollars of CIA funding.&lt;ref&gt;Television documentary ''Mafia Women'', [[Discovery Channel]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Documents released during 1997 revealed that some Mafiosi worked with CIA on assassination attempts against Castro.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.udel.edu/leipzig/texts2/cnn03077.htm CIA offered money to Mafia]. Retrieved December 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; CIA documents released during 2007 confirmed that during the summer of 1960, CIA recruited ex-FBI agent Maheu to meet with the West Coast representative of the Chicago mob, [[John Roselli|Johnny Roselli]]. When Maheu contacted Roselli, Maheu hid the fact that he was sent by CIA, instead portraying himself an advocate for international corporations. He offered to pay $150,000 to have Castro killed, but Roselli refused any pay. Roselli introduced Maheu to two men he referred to as "Sam Gold" and "Joe". "Sam Gold" was Sam Giancana; "Joe" was [[Santo Trafficante, Jr.]], the [[Tampa]]/[[Florida]] /[[Miami]] syndicate boss and one of the most powerful mobsters in prerevolution Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;[http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/national/familyjewels/20070626_ciaandmob.pdf Memorandum for the Director of Central Intelligence, Subject: Roselli, Johnny], November 19, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; Glenn Kessler of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' explained: "After Fidel Castro led a revolution that toppled the government of [[Fulgencio Batista]] in 1959, CIA was desperate to eliminate Castro. So, the agency sought out a partner equally worried about Castro—the Mafia, which had lucrative investments in Cuban casinos."&lt;ref name=Kessler&gt;{{cite news|last=Kessler|first=Glenn|title=Trying to Kill Fidel Castro|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/26/AR2007062601467.html|accessdate=May 23, 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=June 27, 2007|authorlink=Glenn Kessler (journalist)|location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the declassified CIA "[[Family jewels (Central Intelligence Agency)|Family Jewels]]" documents, Giancana and Trafficante were contacted during September 1960, about the possibility of an assassination attempt by a go-between from CIA, Maheu, after Maheu had contacted Roselli, a Mafia member in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] and Giancana's number-two man. Maheu had presented himself as a representative of numerous international businesses in Cuba that were being expropriated by Castro. He offered $150,000 for the "removal" of Castro through this operation (the documents suggest that neither Roselli, Giancana, nor Trafficante accepted any sort of payments for the job). According to the files,  Giancana was who suggested using poison pills that could be used to dose Castro's food and drink. These pills were given by CIA to Giancana's nominee, Juan Orta, whom Giancana presented as being a corrupt official in the new Cuban government and who had access to Castro. After six attempts to introduce the poison into Castro's food, Orta abruptly demanded to be relieved from the mission, giving the job to another, unnamed participant. Later, a second attempt was done by Giancana and Trafficante using Anthony Verona, the commander of the Cuban Exile Junta, who had, according to Trafficante, become "disaffected with the apparent ineffectual progress of the Junta". Verona requested $10,000 in expenses and $1,000 worth of communications equipment. However, how much work was performed for the second attempt is unknown, as the entire program was cancelled soon thereafter due to the [[Bay of Pigs invasion]] during April 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = CIA tried to get Mafia to kill Castro | author = Steve Holland and Andy Sullivan | url = http://uk.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUKN2623180820070626 | publisher = Reuters | date = 2007-06-27 | accessdate = 2008-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = "Family Jewels" Archive | author = Thomas Blanton | url = http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB222/index.htm | publisher = [[National Security Archive]] | date = 2007-06-26 | accessdate = 2008-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MSNBC2007-06-27&gt;{{cite web | title = CIA opens the book on a shady past Declassified ‘family jewels’ detail assassination plots, break-ins, wiretaps | author = Alex Johnson | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19438161/ | publisher = [[MSNBC]] | date = 2007-06-27 | accessdate = 2008-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, Giancana, according to the "Family Jewels", asked Maheu to wire the room of his then-mistress [[Phyllis McGuire]], whom he suspected of having an affair with comedian [[Dan Rowan]]. Although documents suggest Maheu acquiesced, the device was not planted due to the arrest of the agent who had been given the task of planting the device. According to the documents, [[Robert F. Kennedy|Robert Kennedy]] prohibited the prosecution of the agent and of Maheu, who was soon linked to the wire attempt, at CIA's request.&lt;ref name=MSNBC2007-06-27 /&gt; Giancana and McGuire, who had a long-lasting affair, were originally introduced by [[Frank Sinatra]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Giancana1984|Giancana 1984]] pp.259-284, 287-293, 347-348.&lt;/ref&gt; During part of the affair, according to Sam's daughter Antoinette, McGuire had a concurrent affair with President Kennedy.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Giancana1984|Giancana 1984]] p.179.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Downfall==
Giancana's behavior was too high-profile for Outfit preferences and attracted too much federal scrutiny. He also refused to share his lavish profits from offshore casinos in [[Iran]] and Central America with his subordinates. Both of these factors resulted in much resentment among the Outfit's rank-and-file.
Giancana was the subject of many hours of wiretaps. On one, he was heard to say, "We're whacking a lot of the wrong guys lately."

When Giancana was called before a grand jury during 1966, he was ordered{{by whom|date=August 2016}} to stay silent, which put him in prison for more than a year. Meanwhile, Giancana was deposed as operational boss by Ricca and Accardo, and replaced by [[Joseph Aiuppa|Joseph "Joey Doves" Aiuppa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Carl Sifakis|title=The Mafia Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jgCpxTpPCPcC|year=2005|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-0-8160-6989-7|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=jgCpxTpPCPcC&amp;pg=PA6 6]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International gambling success and dispute with the Outfit==

After arriving in Mexico, Giancana managed to make money from various gambling operations, among them in Iran.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

When Tony Accardo demanded that he give a share of the profits to The Outfit, Giancana refused, claiming that he did it all by himself and outside the Outfit's jurisdiction. In response, Accardo asked someone to "explain him the facts of life. And I mean ''life''." Giancana, however remained adamant and refused to pay.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Roemer, ''Accardo: The Genuine Godfather''&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=February 2014}}

After his release from prison, Giancana relocated to [[Cuernavaca]], [[Mexico]] in order to avoid further [[grand jury]] questioning.&lt;ref name="The Spokesman-Review; June 21, 1975"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Crime boss' death linked to his discomfiture to mob |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&amp;dat=19750621&amp;id=3ztOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Le0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5271,1807055&amp;hl=en |newspaper=The Spokesman-Review |volume=93 |issue=38 |location=Spokane, Washington |page=16 |date=June 21, 1975 |access-date=October 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Los Angeles Times; November 21, 2014"&gt;{{cite news |last=Glionna |first=John M. |date=November 21, 2014 |title=Sam Giancana's daughter aims to cash in on gangster's memorabilia |url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-sam-giancana-auction-20141120-story.html |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |access-date=October 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was arrested by Mexican authorities on July 19, 1974 and deported to the United States.&lt;ref name="The Spokesman-Review; June 21, 1975"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Los Angeles Times; November 21, 2014"/&gt; He arrived back in Chicago on July 21, 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Branigan|title=A History of Chicago's O'Hare Airport|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zRM7U2umBtcC|year=2011|publisher=The History Press|isbn=978-1-60949-434-6|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=zRM7U2umBtcC&amp;pg=PA134 134]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Giancana had another meeting with the Outfit with no resolution. The Outfit requested he give them a share of his money, and he refused.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Death==
After Giancana's return to the U.S., the police detailed officers to guard his house in [[Oak Park, Illinois]]. However, on the night of June 19, 1975, shortly before he was scheduled to appear before the [[Church Committee]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/program.pl?ID=240608|title=Giancana Killed|publisher=[[CBS News]]|date = June 20, 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was investigating CIA and Cosa Nostra [[collusion]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=m2pPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wiQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6699%2C5312620|title=Murder Most Foul|newspaper=[[Times-News (Hendersonville, North Carolina)|The Times-News]]|date=December 31, 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; someone recalled the police detail guarding his property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Underworld Histories|title= Chicago|publisher= [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A gunman later entered Giancana's basement kitchen and shot him in the back of the head as he was frying [[sausage and peppers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Congress|1983|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tmURAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%221147+S.Wenonah%22&amp;dq=%221147+S.Wenonah%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=T1––S5–rGoLGrAf0iLHbCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAQ 182]}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Giancana fell to the floor, the gunman turned him over and shot him six more times in the face and neck. Investigators suspected the murderer was someone known to Giancana because, due to his heart condition, he would not eat rich foods and was therefore cooking for another.

Giancana was interred next to his wife, Angelina, in a family mausoleum at [[Mount Carmel Cemetery (Hillside)|Mount Carmel Cemetery]], in [[Hillside, Illinois]].&lt;ref name=burialcoord&gt;Giancana family mausoleum location: {{Coord|41.8642299|N|87.914274|W|scale:1500|display=inline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within days of Giancana's murder, [[Michael J. Corbitt]], the police chief of [[Willow Springs, Illinois|Willow Springs]] and a mobster associate, was told by Chicago Outfit's ''[[Caporegime|capo]]'' Salvatore Bastone that "[...] Sam sure loved that little guy in Oak Park [...] [[Anthony Spilotro|Tony Spilotro]]. Yeah, he was fuckin' crazy about him. Sam put Tony on the fuckin' map, thought he was gonna be a big fuckin' man someday. Did you know that after [[Marshall Caifano]] got out of Vegas, it was Sam who wanted Tony Spilotro out there? Even lately, with all the problems with the [[Skimming (casinos)|skim]] and all, Sam always stood behind the guy. Tony was over to Sam's house all the time. He lived right by there. Did you know Tony even figured out a way where he could get in through the back of Sam's place without anybody seeing him? He'd go through other people's yards, go over fences, all sorts of shit."&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Corbitt, ''Double Deal: The Inside Story of Murder, Unbridled Corruption, and the Cop who was a Mobster, 2003. Page 196.&lt;/ref&gt; When Corbitt asked for the reason for the murder, Bastone quipped, "There's never just one reason for shit like what happened to Sam. There's a million of 'em. Let's just say that Sam should've remembered what happened to [[Bugsy Siegel]]."&lt;ref name="Corbitt 2003, page 196"&gt;Corbitt (2003), page 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other theories===
Although long time associate Dominic "Butch" Blasi was with Giancana the night he was murdered and was questioned by police as a suspect, neither the FBI nor Giancana's daughter Antoinette consider him Giancana's killer.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Giancana1984|Giancana 1984]], p.367.&lt;/ref&gt; Hitman [[Nicholas Calabrese]] told the FBI during the 2000s that he knew that Tony Accardo was part of the killing, and [[Angelo J. LaPietra|Angelo LaPietra]] got rid of the gun which used a [[suppressor]] made by [[Frank Calabrese, Sr.]] and Ronnie Jarret.&lt;ref&gt;''Family Secrets: The Case That Crippled the Chicago Mob&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theory was that [[Santo Trafficante, Jr.]], the boss of the [[Trafficante crime family]], ordered Giancana's murder due to fears he was going to testify about the Mafia's involvement in the CIA plots to kill [[Cuba]]n leader [[Fidel Castro]]. Although Trafficante would have needed permission from Outfit bosses [[Tony Accardo]] and [[Joseph Aiuppa]], Giancana's murder coincided with the discovery of the decomposing remains of [[Johnny Roselli]] in an oil drum floating off Miami, Florida, whose body had been shot and chopped up before being dumped in the sea. The killing was suspected of being committed on the orders of Trafficante.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite news | first = G. | last = C. | title = Deep Six for Johnny | url = http://jfk.hood.edu/Collection/Weisberg%20Subject%20Index%20Files/R%20Disk/Roselli%20John/Item%2008.pdf | publisher = ''[[Time (Magazine)|Time]]''| pages = 23–25| date=  August 23, 1976  | quote =  Alameda Fratianno was Roselli's protégé because Roselli introduced Fratiano to NY mob he was responsible for Fratiano's actions who was an informant therefore death is of consequence.
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite rumours that the CIA may have killed Giancana because of his links to the agency, former CIA Director [[William Colby]] has been quoted as saying, "We had nothing to do with it".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Godwin1978|Godwin 1978]], p.145.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Scarborough Shoal standoff''' refers to tensions between [[China]] (PRC) and the [[Philippines]] which began on April 8, 2012 over the [[Philippine Navy]] apprehension of eight mainland Chinese fishing vessels in the disputed [[Scarborough Shoal]].&lt;ref name=inqtimeline /&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Scarborough Shoal Landsat.jpg|thumb]]
The [[Scarborough Shoal]] is claimed by both [[China]] and the [[Philippines]]. Taiwan also claims the shoal as part of its territory. On April 8, 2012, a [[Philippine Navy]] surveillance plane spotted eight Chinese fishing vessels anchored in the waters of Scarborough shoal. ''[[BRP Gregorio del Pilar (PF-15)|BRP Gregorio del Pilar]]'' was sent on the same day by the Philippine Navy to survey the vicinity of the shoal, and confirmed the presence of the fishing vessels and their ongoing activities. On April 10, 2012, ''BRP Gregorio del Pilar'' came to inspect the catch of the fishing vessels. The Filipino inspection team claimed that they discovered illegally collected [[coral]]s, [[giant clam]]s and live [[shark]]s inside the first vessel boarded by the team. ''BRP Gregorio del Pilar'' reported that they attempted to arrest the Chinese fishermen but were blocked by Chinese maritime surveillance ships, [[Haijian 75|China Marine Surveillance 75]] (''Zhongguo Haijian 75'') and [[Haijian 84|China Marine Surveillance 84]] (''Zhongguo Haijian 84''). Since then, tensions have continued between the two countries.&lt;ref name=inqtimeline&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/36003/scarborough-shoal-standoff-a-historicaltimeline|title=Scarborough shoal standoff: A timeline|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/32341/ph-chinese-naval-vessels-in-scarborough-shoal-standoff|title=PH, Chinese naval vessels in Scarborough Shoal standoff|author=Tina G.

==Reactions and related incidents==
* In 2012, an unsuccessful call was made in the Philippines to [[boycott]] goods [[made in China]] by the [[Albay]] Governor [[Joey Salceda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/37179/albay-gov-renews-call-for-boycott-of-china-products|title=Albay gov renews call for boycott of China products|author=Mar S. Arguelles|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the same year, U.S. Pinoys for Good Governance, together with the Vietnamese community in  [[Florida]] also called for the boycott of Chinese goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/41565/filipinos-vietnamese-in-us-close-ranks-boycott-chinese-products|title=Filipinos, Vietnamese in US close ranks: Boycott Chinese products|author=Elton Lugay|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cyber attack exchanges===
Hackers suspected to be from China, defaced the website of the [[University of the Philippines]] on April 20, 2012. The hackers left a message claiming, "We come from China! Huangyan Island is Ours". On April 21 "[[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous #Occupy Philippines]]" retaliated and attacked the China University Media Union website, defacing its homepage with an image of a [[Guy Fawkes]] mask.  The hacker said, "Chinese government is clearly retarded. Scarborough Shoal is ours!". The website of the University of the Philippines was back online at the same day. After the attacks, Philippine President [[Benigno Aquino III]]'s deputy spokesperson Abigail Valte said that it didn't appear that the attacks would have any negative effect on the talks by Manila and Beijing to find a diplomatic solution to the standoff, and urged both Filipinos and Chinese to refrain from escalating tensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/34379/hackers-bring-ph-china-dispute-to-cyberspace|title=Hackers bring PH-China dispute to cyberspace|author=Christine O. Avendaño|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philippine websites of Official Gazette, the Presidential Communications Development and Strategic Planning Office, and the Presidential Museum and Library were also defaced in April. On May 4, hackers defaced the websites of ''[[The Philippine Star]]'' newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/breaking-news/2012/05/05/philippine-news-website-hacked-219811|title=Breaking News|work=Sun.Star|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philippine fruit exports to China===
China has imposed stricter regulations on its import of Philippine bananas, as a shipload of [[banana]]s was rejected in May, allegedly due to its failure to pass quarantine tests. According to Philippine banana exporters, China's move was related to the standoff in the Scarborough shoal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.inquirer.net/57081/banana-exports-to-be-hit-by-scarborough-dispute–-industry-insider Banana exports to be hit by Scarborough dispute– industry insider | Inquirer Business&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interaksyon.com/article/31100/new-weapon-in-scarborough-standoff-bananas|title=New weapon in Scarborough standoff: Bananas|work=InterAksyon.com|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; China also ordered stiffer inspections over Philippine [[pineapple]]s and other fruits coming from the country.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/36217/china-travel-agencies-suspend-trips-to-philippines|title=China travel agencies suspend trips to Philippines|author=Christopher Bodeen|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suspension of tours to the Philippines===
Most Chinese travel agencies suspended tours to the Philippines due to the standoff over the Scarborough shoal. Tourists from China make about 9% of total arrivals to the Philippines according to the Philippine [[Department of Tourism (Philippines)|Department of Tourism]]. 

The state-owned [[China Travel Service]], Shanghai Tourism Bureau and [[Ctrip|Ctrip.com]] suspended all tours to the Philippines indefinitely citing the anti-Chinese sentiment in the country and for the safety of Chinese nationals.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-18015538 | work=BBC News | title=China travel agencies suspend Philippine tours | date=10 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has caused a boost in tourism revenues for Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam, where Chinese tourists now{{When|date=October 2016}} choose to go instead.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===May 11 Philippine protests===
Filipinos organized a protest near the Chinese Consulate in Manila against China's policies in the Scarborough shoal on May 11. However, this was short-lived as just a fraction of the 1,000 people expected turned up to participate in the protest. 

China deployed police near the Philippine Embassy in Beijing where about 200 protesters were reported. The protest in Beijing ended peacefully. The Chinese embassy in Manila advised Chinese nationals to stay off the streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-18030805 | work=BBC News | title=Protest in Philippines over South China Sea stand-off | date=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taiwan also released a similar advisory to its residents staying in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/257805/news/nation/taiwanese-in-phl-urged-to-keep-safe-at-anti-china-protests-in-manila|title=Taiwanese in PHL urged to keep safe at anti-China protests in Manila|work=GMA News Online|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="beijingptst"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/china/2012-05/12/content_25367605.htm|title=Protest over Huangyan Island dispute held in Beijing|author=段亚英|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===May 11 Hong Kong protests===
[[Hong Kong]] activists organized a protest on May 11, to reiterate China's claim over the Scarborough shoal near the Philippine Consulate in Hong Kong. The protesters sent an open letter to the authorities claiming that the Scarborough shoal has been a Chinese territory since 1279 during the [[Yuan Dynasty]]. They also accuse the Philippines in inciting anti-China demonstration among FIlipinos and disrupting Chinese fishermen in the shoal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinapost.com.tw/china/local-news/hong-kong/2012/05/11/340696/HK-activists.htm HK activists protest against Scarborough Shoal standoff - The China Post&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===May 12 Beijing protests===
Five protesters unfurled banners in front of the Philippine embassy in Beijing reading, "Huangyan Island will always belong to China" and "Keep your hands off Huangyan Island". The protest did not take long and the protesters were dispersed by the police by noon.&lt;ref name="beijingptst" /&gt;

===Fishing ban===
The Chinese government unilaterally imposed a [[fishing ban]] in the [[South China Sea]], where the Scarborough shoal lies, lasting from May 16 to August 1. Since 1999, China has been imposing the annual summer fishing ban, which covers fishermen, regardless of nationality. Mono-layer [[gillnets]], and [[hook and line fishing]] is not covered by the ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interaksyon.com/article/31840/china-bans-fishing-in-scarborough-shoal-other-parts-of-south-china-sea-starting-may-16|title=China bans fishing in Scarborough Shoal, other parts of South China Sea, starting May 16|work=InterAksyon.com|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Philippines does not recognize the Chinese fishing ban but has imposed its own fishing ban. The Filipino fishing ban lasted from May 16 to July 15 and the [[Philippine Coast Guard]] will ban Filipino fishermen from the shoal. President Benigno Aquino III insisted that the ban was for the preservation of the marine resources. [[Fish aggregating device]]s were installed in the municipal waters of [[Santa Cruz, Zambales|Santa Cruz]], [[Candelaria, Zambales|Candelaria]], [[Masinloc, Zambales|Masinloc]], [[Palauig, Zambales|Palauig]] and [[Iba, Zambales|Iba]] in [[Zambales]], as well as in [[La Union (province)|La Union]], [[Ilocos Sur]] and [[Ilocos Norte]] to ensure the livelihoods of affected Filipino fishermen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/9264697/Philippines-and-China-to-impose-fishing-bans-amid-standoff.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Philippines and China to impose fishing bans amid standoff | date=14 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=807755&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=63|title=Suspek|work=philstar.com|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of June 26, fishing vessels, together with paramilitary ships, are still in Scarborough shoal despite the Chinese fishing ban still effect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://businessmirror.com.ph/home/nation/29108-chinese-fishing-boats-paramilitary-ships-still-staying-at-scarborough-shoal Chinese fishing boats, paramilitary ships still staying at Scarborough Shoal&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Faeldon's planned protest===

Former [[Marines (military)|Marine]] [[Captain (naval)|Capt.]] [[Nicanor Faeldon]], planned to lead a group of fishermen to the Scarborough shoal as a protest to assert the Philippines' claim over the shoal. Faeldon also considered planting a Philippine flag on the shoal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/-depth/05/17/12/ex-rebel-soldier-leads-voyage-scarborough-shoal|title=Ex-rebel soldier leads voyage to Scarborough Shoal|author=Tessa Jamandre, Vera Files|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 18, President Aquino, called Faeldon to dissuade him from pushing through his trip. According to Faeldon, even though his plan push through, his group does not intend to plant a flag, as opposed to earlier reports, or to fish in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/37405/china-on-high-alert-over-faeldon-trip|title=China on high alert over Faeldon trip|author=Tina G.

===Continued Chinese presence===
Philippines claimed that under a 2012 deal mediated by the United States, China and the Philippines promised to withdraw their forces from the shoal until a deal over its ownership could be reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/04/13/1572446/philippine-diplomat-china-dont-turn-shoal-island|title=Philippine diplomat to China: Don't turn shoal into island|work=philstar.com|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Philippines "complied with the agreement" and withdrew.  China, however, did not abide by the agreement and maintained its presence at the shoal, effectively militarizing it.

By July 2012, China had erected a barrier to the entrance of the shoal, according to the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=DFA: China boats blocking PHL vessels from Panatag Shoal  |author=Michaela Del Callar |url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/265889/news/nation/dfa-china-boats-blocking-phl-vessels-from-panatag-shoal |newspaper=GMA News |date=18 July 2012 |accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Indonesia scrambles to end ASEAN rift over sea |author=Jim Gomez |url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/asia/2012/07/18/indonesia-scrambles-end-asean-rift-over-sea/zh9BrI0Bj4WH4FQT2QY5hP/story.html |newspaper=Associated Press |date= 18 July 2012|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=China has the Philippines on the ropes |last = Keating|first = Joshua|authorlink = Joshua Keating |url=http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/09/04/china_has_the_phillipines_on_the_ropes |newspaper=[[Foreign Policy]] |date=4 September 2012 |accessdate=16 September 2012}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, vessels belonging to the [[China Marine Surveillance]] and Fisheries Law Enforcement Command have been observed in the nearby disputed shoal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=3 Chinese government vessels spotted at Scarborough Shoal — DFA |author=Fat Reyes |url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/45761/3-chinese-government-vessels-spotted-at-scarborough-shoal-dfa |newspaper=Global Nation Inquirer |date=27 July 2012 |accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Chinese government vessels have been turning away Filipino vessels sailing to the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=3 Chinese ships seen in Scarborough - PCG |url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/regions/09/12/12/3-chinese-ships-seen-scarborough-pcg |newspaper=ABS-CBN News |date=12 September 2012 |accessdate=16 September 2012 |location=Manila, Philippines }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the Philippines has stated that it would be preparing to resend vessels to the shoal, in what has been described as a "cold standoff".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Navy ships ready to sail back to Scarborough Shoal |author=Tarra Quismundo |url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/48044/navy-ships-ready-to-sail-back-to-scarborough-shoal |newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=25 August 2012 |accessdate=16 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By January 2014, China continued to maintain a presence within the shoal, among heightened tensions regarded a new law which requires non-Chinese fishing boats to seek permission from China when in the South China Sea, however Philippine fishing boats were able to fish around the shoal without Chinese interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Romero |first=Alexis |date=26 January 2014 |title=Pinoy fishermen defy new Chinese fishing rules in Panatag Shoal  |url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2014/01/26/1283092/pinoy-fishermen-defy-new-chinese-fishing-rules-panatag-shoal |newspaper=Philippine Star |location=Manila |accessdate=12 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of China's continued presence on the Shoals as a justification for the United States's recent "rebalance" to the region has provoked mixed opinions: an article in [[Foreign Policy]] identified increased Chinese patrols of the Shoals as a reason for why China's accusation that the US pivot was stoking tensions in the South China Sea was "patently false"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Keck|first1=Zachary|title=Don’t Blame US Pivot for South China Sea Row|url=http://thediplomat.com/2014/08/dont-blame-us-pivot-for-south-china-sea-row/|publisher=The Diplomat|date=August 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Amitai Etzioni]] has writes of China's dispute over the Shoals as a reason for Washington's military buildup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Etzioni |first=Amitai |date=26 April 2014 |title=Obama’s "Rebalancing": A Fig Leaf |url=http://thediplomat.com/2014/04/obamas-rebalancing-a-fig-leaf/ |newspaper=The Diplomat |access-date=5 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International reaction==
* {{AUS}} – Australian Foreign Minister [[Bob Carr]], while in Shanghai on May 12th, urged claimant nations to conform to international conventions and law for resolution, saying "We don't take a side on the various claims over the South China Sea. But we do, given our interest in the South China Sea, and given the fact that a large proportion of our trade travels through it, we do call on governments to clarify and pursue those claims and accompanying maritime rights in accordance with international law including the U.N. Law of the Sea Convention."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/258071/news/nation/australia-urges-un-law-of-the-sea-approach-to-south-china-sea-claims|title=Australia urges UN Law of the Sea approach to South China Sea claims|work=GMA News Online|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* {{MYS}} – Malaysian [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Prime Minister]] [[Najib Razak]] stated that his country supports the Philippines' call for a "peaceful resolution" through a "multilateral solution" to the Scarborough shoal conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/38389/malaysia-too-wants-peace-in-panatag-shoal|title=Malaysia too wants peace in Panatag Shoal|author=Jerry E.

* {{RUS}} – Russia's Ambassador to Manila, Nikolay Kudashev, reiterated that Russia supports a bilateral solution among the claimant countries and opposes the involvement of other nations in the South China Sea disputes. Kudashev also noted that Russia is not a party to the Scarborough shoal dispute and that his country wants to ensure [[freedom of navigation]] in the South China Sea. Kudashev also stated that "The [[UNCLOS]] (United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea) would provide a good and solid basis."&lt;ref&gt;[http://mb.com.ph/node/360014/ru Russia Against Meddling | Manila Bulletin]&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{flag|Taiwan}} – Former Taiwanese [[President of Taiwan|President]] [[Ma Ying-jeou]] stated his hope that the conflict will be solved in a "peaceful manner", but also reiterating that Taiwan "will still continue to uphold sovereign claims over the South China Sea".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=809152&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=63|title=Civic leader apologizes to JPE, impeach court|work=philstar.com|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*{{US}} – The United States on Tuesday, June 14, 2011, indicated its support for the Philippines amid the escalating tensions over the disputed [[Spratly Islands]] in the South China Sea. US Ambassador [[Harry K. Thomas, Jr.|Harry Thomas]] said, "I want to assure you that on all sectors, we, the United States, are with the Philippines, ... The Philippines and the United States are strategic treaty allies. We are partners.

==ITLOS involvement==
{{See also|International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea|Philippines v. China}}

The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) is an [[intergovernmental organization]] created by the mandate of the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea#UNCLOS III|Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea]], with responsibility for the regulation of seabed mining beyond the limits of national jurisdiction, and with the power to settle disputes between party states. 

In June 2013 the Philippines decided to bring the territorial row before the ITLOS after it had "exhausted all political and diplomatic avenues for a peaceful negotiated settlement of its maritime dispute with China", saying that it would ask the tribunal to declare China's claims as "invalid". China formally rejected the arbitration proceedings initiated by the Philippines. According to Annex VII of the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] (UNCLOS), however, China's refusal would not necessarily impede the proceedings.&lt;ref name=rappler2013-06-25&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/32120-thomas-mensah-arbitral-tribunal|title=Top maritime judge to hear PH case vs China|date=June 25, 2013|publisher=rappler.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014 it was reported that China had offered mutual withdrawal from the shoal and other inducements if the Philippines would refrain from submitting a formal pleading, and that the Philippine position was, "With what's on the table, there's not enough."&lt;ref name=rappler2014-02-26&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/51558-china-derail-philippines-memorial-itlos|title=China offers PH 'carrot' to quit case|date=February 26, 2014|publisher=rappler.com]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heightened tensions in 2016==
Having observed boat activity at the shoal that could have signaled preparation for development activity, the U.S. "flew three different air patrols near Scarborough ..., including on April 19 and 21", 2016, and talked of and reportedly were considering other reactions in light of generally higher tensions in the [[Territorial disputes in the South China Sea|Spratlys and the region]]. The U.S. flights did observe the 12-mile territorial limit from the shoal.&lt;ref&gt;Lubold, Gordon, and

The '''Sports Racer Series''' is an [[Australia]]n [[motor racing]] series for competitors racing naturally aspirated small-engined (under 1.6 litres of engine capacity) [[Sports car racing|prototype sports cars]]. The series eligibility is something of a polyglot collection of existing racing cars and racing categories, featuring Group 2C [[Supersports|Supersport]] racing cars, which in itself is an amalgamation of the former Clubman or Sports 1300 regulations with some newer motorcycle engined cars built specifically for Supersports, and a group of Category 6 sports cars produced by West, Minetti, Radical, Lincspeed and ADR,&lt;ref name=SRS&gt;[http://www.sportsracer.com.au/attachments/003_2010%20Sports%20Racer%20Series%20-%20Sporting%20Regulations%20-%20Final.pdf]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; many of which formerly raced as Prototype Sports Cars, or Protosports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amrs.net.au/tsnews.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106221340/http://www.amrs.net.au/tsnews.htm |archivedate=2010-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawing from so many different sources, entry was likely to be diverse, and was briefly in 2010. The first race meeting for the new category was held at the [[2010 Clipsal 500]] V8 Supercar race meeting. By 2011 the majority of the grid were Wests.

After two events, the third round of the series was cancelled and no further events appear likely to take place. The series stumbled heavily in its first season. Radical drivers left the series and established their own championship in 2011. A more modest series was held in 2011. Wests made up the bulk of the field.

The '''Summer Shakespeare Festival''' (Czech: ''Letní shakespearovské slavnosti'', Slovak: ''Letné shakespearovské slávnosti'') takes place in the courtyard of Burgrave Palace at [[Prague Castle]]. The festival was originally initiated by [[Václav Havel]]. The performances are also presented at [[Špilberk]] in [[Brno]] and at [[Bratislava Castle]] in [[Bratislava]]. The organizers closely cooperate with [[Martin Hilský]], who translated most of the staged plays.

So far, the most acclaimed was the performance of ''[[King Lear]]'' in 2002. In 2004, director [[Martin Huba]] was selected for an ambitious project, a performance of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' such as that one evening Capulets would be Slovaks and Monteks Czechs and the next day vice versa. The project failed, Huba said to the media that even though the dialogs translated by [[Ľubomír Feldek]] and Martin Hilský were perfect, they somehow did not fit together. In the end, the only Slovak-speaking character was the Nurse, performed by [[Emília Vášáryová]].

== Selected performances ==

* 2002 – ''King Lear'' (Lear: [[Jan Tříska]], directed by Martin Huba) 
* 2003 – ''[[Hamlet]]'' (Hamlet: [[Jiří Langmajer]], directed by Lucie Bělohradská)  
* 2004 – ''Romeo and Juliet'' (Romeo: Jiří Hájek / Ladislav Hampl, [[Juliet Capulet|Juliet]]: Kateřina Čapková / [[Zuzana Vejvodová]], Nurse: [[Emília Vášáryová]], directed by Martin Huba)   
* 2005 – ''[[Twelfth Night, or What You Will]]'' (Viola: Jitka Schneiderová / Zuzana Vejvodová, Olivia: [[Linda Rybová]] / Hana Ševčíková, Feste: Jiří Langmajer / [[Miroslav Táborský]], Malvolio: [[Alois Švehlík]] / Jan Vlasák, directed by Viktor Polesný)
* 2006 – ''[[Othello]]'' (Othello: Michal Dlouhý / Martin Zahálka, [[Iago]]: Oldřich Navrátil, [[Desdemona (Othello)|Desdemona]]: [[Lucie Vondráčková]] / Zuzana Vejvodová, directed by Petr Kracik)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1666">The '''Tainan fake panda incident''' refers to an incident at a private zoo in [[Tainan]], [[Taiwan]], where a [[sun bear]] was painted black and white and falsely presented to visitors as a [[Giant Panda]].  The bear was first unveiled on 24 December 1987, and quickly drew skepticism as experts were not permitted to enter the enclosure, and the pattern of spots on the fur appeared to change.  The Tainan District Prosecutors Office sent investigators on December 31, suspecting fraud.  By 3 January 1988, officials from the Council of Agriculture, and zoology experts from [[National Taiwan University]] and [[Normal University]] determined the animal was not a true panda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title="Selling Genuine Panda"(賣點100－真假熊-{}-猫))|year=1989|publisher=Yuan-Liou Publishing (遠流出版)|isbn=9789573201878|pages=41–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This incident made popular the use of the term "(giant) cat bear" [''(dà)māoxióng'', (大)貓熊] instead of "(giant) bear cat" [''(dà)xióngmāo'', (大)熊貓] to refer to pandas in Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;http://projectgen-y.com/2015/3a/misniwan/index.php/name/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Boy from Oz''''' is a [[jukebox musical]] based on the life of singer and songwriter [[Peter Allen (musician)|Peter Allen]], featuring songs written by him. The original book is by [[Nick Enright]], with a revised book by Martin Sherman. Premiering in Australia in 1998 starring [[Todd McKenney]], the musical opened in a revised version on Broadway in 2003 with [[Hugh Jackman]] in the title role.

==Plot==
=== Act I ===
The musical begins with Australian performer Peter Allen recalling his life story, coming to terms with who he was ("The Lives of Me"). Afterwards, we go back to Allen's childhood in Tenterfield, Australia, where a young boy named Peter Woolnough is performing in local bars for money ("When I Get My Name in Lights"). Peter grows up and joins with Chris Bell to become the Allen Brothers, and they perform in Australian Bandstand ("Love Crazy"). After great success in Australia, the Allen Brothers perform in a Hong Kong Hilton hotel to Chinese businessmen. One evening, another person is watching them from the bar: the legendary Judy Garland. Peter convinces Judy to perform with them ("All I Wanted Was the Dream"), and Judy takes Peter to be the opening act in her concert in New York ("Only an Older Woman").

While in New York, Peter is introduced to Judy's daughter, [[Liza Minnelli|Liza]], and they fall in love ("Best That You Can Do"). There are rumors of Peter's homosexuality, and Judy warns Liza of this ("Don't Wish Too Hard"). Liza gives no attention to her warning and marries Peter ("Come Save Me"). 

Peter makes some mistakes, and at one of his all night parties Liza walks in on him ("Continental American"), further fueling her suspicions that he is gay. Liza is working hard to get her career going ("She Loves to Hear the Music"), in contrast to Peter's excessive lifestyle. Judy dies, and Peter honors her ("Quiet Please, There's a Lady on Stage"). Liza's world comes crashing down as a result of her mother's death.

Liza confronts Peter on his alleged homosexuality, and their marriage ends ("I'd Rather Leave While I'm in Love"). Peter returns to Australia but realizes that he is not who people thought he was ("Not the Boy Next Door").

=== Act II ===
Back in the US, Peter has gone solo and comes to terms with his bisexuality ("Bi-Coastal"). He meets the hardworking fashion model Gregory Connell. Greg does not want to be a part of Peter's life in show business, but he falls in love with Peter ("If You Were Wondering"). They soon get discovered by music producer [[Dee Anthony]], and he gets them a gig at the [[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana]] in New York ("Sure Thing Baby"). Peter's career takes off, and he wins an Oscar for [[Arthur's Theme]], in addition to recording songs that were covered by artists [[Olivia Newton-John]] and [[Frank Sinatra]]. Peter gives his best performance in the [[Radio City Music Hall]] with [[The Rockettes]] ("Everything Old is New Again"), and is surprised to know his mother is also in love.

Greg becomes stricken with [[AIDS]], and even though Peter tries to help him carry on, he succumbs to his illness ("Love Don't Need a Reason"). Peter also becomes sick with AIDS, but Greg's spirit urges him to carry on ("I Honestly Love You"). Liza offers her support to Peter, and they both realize they had successful lives and careers without each other ("You and Me").

Peter returns to Australia for a triumphant performance ("I Still Call Australia Home") and tries to tell his mother about his illness, but he can't find a way to tell her ("Don't Cry Out Loud").

Peter succumbs to his disease, and he reflects on his life realizing he has no regrets as he passes away ("Once Before I Go"), but not before going out in style with a farewell performance ("I Go to Rio").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theatre-musical.com/boyfromoz/synopsis.html |title=The Boy from Oz: Synopsis |website=Stacy's Musical Village |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415060054/http://www.theatre-musical.com/boyfromoz/synopsis.html |archivedate=April 15, 2012 |accessdate=November 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production history==
===Original Australian production===
''The Boy from Oz'' had its world premiere, directed by [[Gale Edwards]], at [[Her Majesty's Theatre, Sydney]], Australia, on 5 March 1998 and toured Brisbane, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth, playing to over 1.2 million theatre patrons. It ran for a total 766 performances over two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.audiomastermind.com/detail-the_boy_from_oz-14567.html |title=The Boy From Oz... in Oz |website=Audiomastermind.com |accessdate=November 13, 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726041520/http://www.audiomastermind.com/detail-the_boy_from_oz-14567.html |archivedate=July 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production starred showman [[Todd McKenney]] as Peter Allen and [[Divinyls]] frontwoman [[Chrissy Amphlett]] as [[Judy Garland]], Angela Toohey as Liza Minnelli and introduced [[Mathew Waters]] as Young Peter Allen.

===Broadway===
''The Boy from Oz'' began previews on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]  at the [[Imperial Theatre (Broadway)|Imperial Theatre]] on 16 September 2003 and opened on 16 October 2003. It closed on 12 September 2004, at the end of [[Hugh Jackman]]'s contract. It was adapted for the American audience by playwright [[Martin Sherman]], who removed some of the Australian terms (such as "jackaroo") and expanded the role of U.S. characters Garland and Minnelli. The musical played 32 previews and 365 performances. Directed by Philip William McKinley, with choreography by Joey McKneely, it starred Jackman as Peter Allen, [[Isabel Keating]] as [[Judy Garland]], [[Stephanie J. Block]] as [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Beth Fowler]] as Marion Woolnough, [[Jarrod Emick]] as Peter's lover Greg Connell, and [[John Hill (actor)|John Hill]] as [[Mark Herron]] (Judy's husband). Jackman won the 2004 [[Tony Award]] for Best Leading Actor in a Musical and the [[Drama Desk Award]] for Outstanding Actor in a Musical, and Keating won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Featured Actress in a Musical. The show also received nominations for four other Tony Awards, including Best Musical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=13424 |title=The Boy from Oz |website=[[Internet Broadway Database]] |accessdate=November 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ben Brantley]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' panned the show, calling it an "indisputably bogus show", but praised Jackman's performance.&lt;ref name="NYTReview"&gt;{{cite news |last=Brantley |first=Ben |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/17/movies/theater-review-flash-of-70-s-sequins.html  |title=Theater Review; Flash Of 70's Sequins |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 17, 2003 |accessdate=November 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The musical recouped its investment of $8.25 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Green |first=Jesse |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/05/theater/newsandfeatures/05GREE.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;position= |title=Theater: Debriefing; Eight Days a Week |newspaper=The New York Times |date=September 5, 2004 |accessdate=November 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australian arena tour===
''The Boy from Oz'' returned to Australia from 3 August 2006 to 10 September 2006 in a new production especially designed for the arena stage (audiences of over 10,000 people), called ''Boy from Oz Arena Spectacular''.  Directed by [[Kenny Ortega]], [[Hugh Jackman]] reprised his New York role as Peter Allen. He was joined by Australian actresses [[Chrissy Amphlett]] and Angela Toohey, reprising their roles as [[Judy Garland]] and [[Liza Minnelli]].

==Reviews==
The Broadway production received favorable reviews. In his review for ''The New York Times'', [[Ben Brantley]] wrote, "His limbs twirling like the blades of a windmill, Mr. Jackman channels the energy that was Allen with a rejuvenating life force all his own. And you don’t feel — as you so often do with such interpretations — that your memories of the prototype have been blurred. This is a performance that, against the odds, holds on to its integrity."&lt;ref name="NYTReview"/&gt;

[[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']], writing about the Australian arena tour, said, "When he first performed the role on Broadway in 2003, Hugh Jackman’s charisma, vitality and breezy confidence onstage far outshone the narrative or emotional scope of the by-the-numbers biomusical of singer-songwriter Peter Allen. The scales have been tipped even further toward the performer in this pumped-up reconfiguration of the show, playing state capitals in venues of 10,000 seats or more. It’s as much a concert platform for a returning local boy made good in Hollywood as it is a life story of Peter Allen. And that’s no bad thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://variety.com/2006/legit/reviews/the-boy-from-oz-1200514370/ |title=The Boy from Oz |first=David |last=Rooney |date=6 August 2006 |magazine=Variety |accessdate=November 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:West Hartford, Connecticut health care reform town hall meeting, 2009-09-02.jpg|thumb|A town hall meeting in [[West Hartford, Connecticut]]]]
'''Town hall meetings''', also referred to as '''town halls''' or '''town hall forums''', are a way for local and national politicians to meet with their constituents, either to hear from them on topics of interest or to discuss specific upcoming legislation or regulation. During periods of active political debate, town halls can be a locus for protest and more active debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rop.org/halfway-through-rops-reflections-on-town-hall-madness/|title=Halfway through: ROP's Reflections on Town Hall Madness - Rural Organizing Project|date=2009-08-27|newspaper=Rural Organizing Project|access-date=2017-02-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite their name, town hall meetings need not take place in a town hall. They are commonly held in a range of venues, including schools, libraries, municipal buildings, and churches. A number of officials have also experimented with digital formats for town halls. Town hall meetings organized by national politicians are often held in a variety of locations distributed across a voting district so that elected representatives can receive feedback from a larger proportion of constituents.

Historically, no specific rules or guidelines have defined a town hall meeting.&lt;ref name="Real"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2A35hJAR7u0C&amp;dq|title=Real Democracy: The New England Town Meeting and How It Works|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0226077963|last1=Bryan|first1=Frank M.|accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any event that allows constituent participation with a politician may be called a town hall, including gatherings in person, group phone calls, or events on Internet platforms such as Facebook or Twitter. Attendees use town halls to voice their opinions and question [[elected official]]s, [[political candidate]]s, and public figures.&lt;ref name="Anup"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5Exv7fHk5V4C&amp;pg=PT650|title=Presidential Campaigns, Slogans, Issues, and Platforms|last2=Hammond|first2=Scott John|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|others=|year=2012|isbn=9780313380938|edition=2d|series=|volume=|location=|page=|pages=|at=|language=|chapter=|type=|format=|bibcode=|doi=|oclc=|id=|quote=|ref=|author-mask=|last1=Roberts|first1=Robert North|authorlink1=|authorlink2=|editor1-first=|editor1-last=|editor1-link=|trans-title=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|accessdate=|origyear=|trans-chapter=|chapterurl=|laysummary=|laydate=|lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Williamson"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LOQVCpi8FBMC&amp;pg=PA150&amp;dq=town+hall+political+event&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZZNIUeDFL-mxiQLZqICQDg&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=town%20hall%20political%20event&amp;f=false|title=How to Run for Political Office and Win|last2=|first2=|publisher=Atlantic Publishing Company|others=|year=2010|isbn=9781601384089|edition=|series=|volume=|location=|page=|pages=150–151|at=|language=|chapter=|type=|format=|bibcode=|doi=|oclc=|id=|quote=|ref=|author-mask=|last1=Williamson|first1=Melanie|authorlink1=|authorlink2=|editor1-first=|editor1-last=|editor1-link=|trans-title=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|accessdate=|origyear=|trans-chapter=|chapterurl=|laysummary=|laydate=|lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to [[town meetings]], a type of [[Direct democracy|direct democratic]] rule that originated in colonial [[New England]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dorchesteratheneum.org/page.php?id=54|title=Dorchester Atheneum|website=www.dorchesteratheneum.org|access-date=2017-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; attendees do not [[vote]] on issues during town hall meetings.

In the [[United States]], town halls are a common way for national politicians to connect or reconnect with their constituents during recesses, when they are in their home districts away from [[Washington DC|Washington, DC]].

== History ==
Town hall meetings can be traced back to the [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial era]] of the United States and to the 19th century in Australia.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The introduction of television and other new media technologies in the 20th century led to a fresh flourishing of town hall meetings in the United States as well as experimentation with different formats in the United States and other countries, both of which continue to the present day.

=== United States ===
Town hall meetings are meant to resemble the New England [[town meeting]] that originated in the 17th century.  However, participants in town hall meetings do not actually vote or make legally binding decisions as town meeting voters do.
 
Some political organizations track publicized town hall events by politicians across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.legistorm.com/townhall.html Town Hall Events for national congresspeople, Legistorm]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1858 debates between [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Stephen A. Douglas|Stephen Douglas]] in some respects resembled a modern town hall meeting, although the candidates did not take questions from the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/history-town-hall-debate-180960705/|title=The History of the Town Hall Debate|last=Mansky|first=Jackie|newspaper=Smithsonian|access-date=2017-02-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Not until the twentieth century did presidential candidates commonly campaign in person.   Gradually, especially from the 1990s onward, presidential town hall meetings have become nearly as common as [[Stump speech (politics)|stump speeches]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maggs|first=John|year=2004|title=The Format That Saved Clinton|url=|journal=National Journal|volume=|pages=2996|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Nixon's 1968 U.S. Presidential campaign staged nine live televised question and answer sessions using a ground-breaking theatre-in-the-round format broadcast with a live studio television audience and local residents directly asking questions of the candidate.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre_in_the_round#History_of_theatre-in-the-round&lt;/ref&gt; The producer of Nixon's "Man in the Arena" &lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFeWFjbeEQ8&lt;/ref&gt; live town-hall programs was Roger Ailes &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nixonfoundation.org/2017/05/roger-ailes-nixons-television-man/&lt;/ref&gt;, who later went to on start FOX News &lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ailes&lt;/ref&gt;. Ailes' use of a direct voter-to-candidate question-and-answer format served as the blueprint for subsequent and now ubiquitous town hall candidate formats and even multiple-candidate debates.

Another step in the development of the modern town hall meeting came on March 16, 1977, when [[Jimmy Carter|President Carter]] attended a televised town hall meeting in [[Clinton, Massachusetts]], that was "modeled after" a real town meeting but did not include binding votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1977/03/16/the-making-of-a-presidential-trip/98647be3-b69a-4b91-a852-5232e2109f02/|title=The Making of a Presidential Trip|last=Walsh|first=Edward|newspaper=Washington Post|access-date=2017-09-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Bill Clinton]] made town hall meetings a part of his presidential campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U44JMDQO8IoC&amp;amp;pg=PA173&amp;amp;dq=%22town+hall+meeting%22+president&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwiIpbqE1rzKAhUH2T4KHR-4A00Q6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=%22town%20hall%20meeting%22%20president&amp;amp;f=false|title=Politics, Discourse, and American Society: New Agendas|last=Hart|first=Roderick P.|last2=Sparrow|first2=Bartholomew H.|date=2001-01-01|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9780742500716|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interest in town halls fluctuates depending on the level of public interest in the topics being discussed. Controversial or confusing issues that are prominently discussed in the news have led to more town halls being held.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/13/us/politics/affordable-care-act-sensenbrenner-republicans.html|title=Angry Town Hall Meetings on Health Care Law, and Few Answers|last=Kaplan|first=Thomas|date=2017-02-13|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=2017-02-18|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 2000s, town halls held by political candidates have announced and enforced rules on crowd behavior and the scope of questions that may be asked.&lt;ref name="Anup" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Williamson" /&gt;

; 21st century meetings
;: ''Detailed article: [[List of significant United States town hall meetings]]''
In 2009, [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]] groups opposed to the proposed [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|health care reform legislation]] began attending town halls to express their disagreement with the legislation. The large and vocal crowds led some representatives to cancel or scale back their town hall events. Representative [[Brian Baird]] canceled his live town hall meetings after receiving death threats, choosing to hold a telephone conference call with his constituents instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=|title=The Tea Party at the Election|url=http://archives.cerium.ca/IMG/pdf/Zachary_Courser_-_The_Tea_Party_at_the_Election.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Town hall meetings by teleconference or online grew in popularity. Obama held some as sitting President, starting in 2011. Federal agencies have held town halls on Twitter since at least 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.digitalgov.gov/2015/12/18/twitter-town-hall-tips-from-the-va/|title=Twitter Town Hall Tips from the VA|date=2015-12-18|website=DigitalGov|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.digitalgov.gov/2013/10/16/twitter-chats-for-federal-agencies/|title=Twitter Chat Guidance for Federal Agencies|date=2013-10-16|website=DigitalGov|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some politicians have held AMAs on Reddit, which have similar formats.

In 2017, constituents opposed to repeal of that same [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|health care act]] began attending town halls to express their disagreement with abolishing the legislation. In districts where elected representatives have not scheduled town halls, some constituents have publicly petitioned for meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gazette.com/protesters-will-hold-town-hall-meeting-for-gardner-but-hell-be-absent/article/1597323|title=Protesters will hold town hall meeting for Gardner, but he'll be absent|newspaper=Colorado Springs Gazette|access-date=2017-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.wbfo.org/post/rally-seeks-town-hall-meeting-collins|title=Rally seeks town hall meeting with Collins|last=Moran|first=Jay|access-date=2017-02-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creative requests for town hall meetings include humorous flyer&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.commondreams.org/news/2017/02/21/voters-shame-cowardly-reps-town-halls-hosted-cardboard-cut-outs|title=Voters Shame Cowardly Reps with Town Halls Hosted by Cardboard Cut-Outs|newspaper=Common Dreams|access-date=2017-02-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sticker campaigns&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mediaite.com/online/missing-stickers-placed-on-milk-cartons-after-lawmaker-dodges-town-halls/|title=‘Missing’ Stickers Placed on Milk Cartons After Lawmaker Dodges Town Halls|website=www.mediaite.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Indivisible Martin|title=Dear Brian Mast - from the People of Martin County|date=2017-02-18|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YytB-QesZ58|accessdate=2017-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some constituents have held mock town halls, using a cardboard cutout or [[Empty chair debating|empty chair]], to stand in for elected representatives who decline to meet with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chron.com/news/politics/texas/article/ted-cruz-town-hall-houston-congress-10947876.php|title=Constituents host 'Texas Town Hall without Ted Cruz'|newspaper=Houston Chronicle|access-date=2017-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.9news.com/news/local/politics/cory-gardners-cory-gardner-less-town-hall/410860626|title=Cory Gardner's Cory Gardner-less town hall|last=TEGNA|newspaper=KUSA|access-date=2017-02-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Australia ===
Australian town hall meetings have been held by state politicians since at least the 19th century.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/legislativepower00quicrich|title=The legislative powers of the commonwealth and the states of Australia, with proposed amendments|last=Quick|first=John|last2=Australia|date=1919-01-01|publisher=Melbourne, Vic. : C.

=== Canada ===
Canadian town halls have been forums for provincial politicians to discuss issues of the day since at least the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|jstor=10.3138/9781442672833|title=Changing Health Care in Canada: The Romanow Papers, Volume 2|date=2004-01-01|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=9780802086181|editor-last=Forest|editor-first=Pierre-Gerlier|doi=10.3138/9781442672833|editor-last2=Marchildon|editor-first2=Gregory P.|editor-last3=Mclntosh|editor-first3=Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1993 elections, televised town hall meetings were one of a number of initiatives mainstream media adopted to center ordinary citizens at the heart of their campaign coverage. These efforts, which also included panels of voters to offer comment in print and on radio shows, have been collectively praised as an "international best practice."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ward|first=Ian|year=1995|title=Bringing the voters back in: A Canadian model for Australia?|url=|journal=Australian Studies of Journalism|volume=4|pages=29–49|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Japan ===

Town hall meetings, alternately referred to as タウンミーティング (''taunmiitingu'') and with the English-language phrase "town meeting," have been held in Japan since the late 1970s. In 1979 [[Shunichi Suzuki (governor)|Shunichi Suzuki]], then governor of [[Tokyo]], held a town hall meeting, its name and format inspired by President Carter's 1977 televised town hall. In subsequent years, media conglomerate [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]] has organized town hall meetings with both Japanese and foreign politicians. Various governmental agencies have also held town halls, including the Cabinet Office (National Dialogue of the Town Meeting Koizumi Cabinet), Ministry of Foreign Affairs (ODA Town Meeting), and the Ministry of the Environment (Septic Town Meeting), among others. Political parties, such as the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|LDP]], [[Democratic Party of Japan|Democratic Party]], [[Komeito]], and [[Japanese Communist Party]], also hold town hall meetings.

The format extends beyond governmental administration and political parties. Other examples include the Athlete Town Meeting held by the [[Japanese Olympic Committee]], the JAXA Town Meeting held by the [[JAXA|Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]], and the Intellectual Property Town Meeting held by the [[Japan Patent Attorneys Association]].

==Format==

The purpose of town hall meetings is for local and regional officials to hear the community's views on public issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://participedia.net/en/methods/new-england-town-meetings |title=New England Town Hall Meetings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been no specific rules or guidelines for holding a town hall meeting.&lt;ref name="Real"/&gt; The format of the meetings can vary. Usually, the person holding the meeting (e.g. member of Congress) makes some opening remarks. Sometimes others (e.g. local leaders) will address the audience, as well. The main part of a town hall meeting tends to occur when the floor is opened up to questions and comments from the audience. Attendees generally present ideas, voice their opinions, ask questions of the public figures, elected officials, or political candidates at the town hall.&lt;ref name="Anup" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Williamson" /&gt;  Sometimes, the town hall meeting is televised or recorded. In recent years, town halls held by political candidates have announced and enforced rules on crowd behavior and the scope of questions that may be asked.&lt;ref name="Anup" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Williamson" /&gt;

If the turnout is large, and if the objective of the particular town hall meeting is to give as many people as possible an opportunity to speak, then the attendees can be broken down into smaller discussion groups. Each smaller group, in that case, appoints someone to summarize discussion of their group.

Some have explored alternative formats for town hall meetings, such as an “electronic town hall”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01405348?LI=true |title=Minerva: An electronic town hall | doi=10.1007/BF01405348 | volume=3 |journal=Policy Sciences |pages=457–474 | last1 = Etzioni | first1 = Amitai}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Congress Foundation commissioned a report on online town hall meetings, which found they grew in size and importance starting in the mid-2000s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.congressfoundation.org/projects/town-hall/online-town-hall-meetings-exploring-democracy-in-the-21st-century Online Town Hall Meetings - Exploring Democracy in the 21st Century]. Congress Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Venues===
Despite the name town hall, meetings need not take place in a town hall. They commonly take place in a range of venues, including: schools, libraries, municipal buildings, churches, etc. Generally they are held in a public space and there is no charge to attend. In a given district, town hall meetings that are organized by the district's congressional representative are often held in a variety of places across the district.

== Other uses of the term ==
The term "town hall meeting" is also used to describe informal corporate gatherings held to share information such as business results or personnel changes.&lt;ref&gt;Example: [http://www.allbusiness.com/its-time-for-a-town-hall-meeting-11550341-1.html It's Time for A Town Hall Meeting], All Business.&lt;/ref&gt;
