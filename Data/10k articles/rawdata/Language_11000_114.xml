An '''arms race''',  in its original usage, is a competition between two or more [[State (polity)|states]] to have the best armed forces. Each party competes to produce more [[weapon]]s, larger [[military]], superior [[military technology]], etc. in a [[technological escalation]].

International conflict specialist [[Theresa Clair Smith]], defines the term as "the participation of two or more nation-states in apparently competitive or interactive increases in quantity or quality of war material and/or persons under arms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Theresa Clair|title=Arms Race Instability and War|journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution|year=1980|issue=2|pages=253–284|url=http://jcr.sagepub.com/content/24/2/253.full.pdf+html|doi=10.1177/002200278002400204|volume=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is also used to describe any long-term escalating competitive situation where each competitor focuses on out-doing the others.

==Examples==

===Pre-First World War naval arms race===
{{main|Anglo-German naval arms race|World War I naval arms race (disambiguation)|South American dreadnought race}}
[[File:Battleship building scatter graph 1905 onwards.png|thumb|right|The size and power of battleships grew rapidly before, during, and after World War I: a result of competitive shipbuilding among a number of naval powers, brought to an end by the [[Washington Naval Treaty]]|upright=1.8]]

From 1897 to 1914, [[anglo-German naval arms race|a naval arms race between the United Kingdom and Germany]] took place. British concern about rapid increase in German naval power resulted in a costly building competition of ''[[Dreadnought]]''-class ships. This tense arms race lasted until 1914, when the war broke out. After the war, a new arms race developed among the victorious Allies, which was temporarily ended by the [[Washington Naval Treaty]].

In addition to the British and Germans, contemporaneous but smaller naval arms races also broke out between Russia and the Ottoman Empire; the Ottomans and Greece; France and Italy; the United States and Japan; and [[South American dreadnought race|Brazil, Argentina, and Chile]].

===Nuclear arms race===
{{main|Nuclear arms race}}
A nuclear arms race developed during the [[Cold War]], an intense period between the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]] and some other countries. This was one of the main causes that began the cold war, and perceived advantages of the adversary by both sides (such as the "[[missile gap]]" and “[[bomber gap]]”) led to large spending on armaments and the stockpiling of vast nuclear arsenals. [[Proxy war]]s were fought all over the world (e.g. in the [[Middle East conflict|Middle East]], [[Korean War|Korea]], [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]) in which the superpowers' conventional weapons were pitted against each other.  After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] and the end of the Cold War, tensions decreased and the nuclear arsenal of both countries were reduced.

==Other uses==
More generically, the term "arms race" is used to describe any competition where there is no absolute goal, only the relative goal of staying ahead of the other competitors in rank or knowledge. An arms race may also imply futility as the competitors spend a great deal of time and money, yet end up in the same situation as if they had never started the arms race.  

An [[evolutionary arms race]] is a system where two populations are [[evolution|evolving]] in order to continuously one-up members of the other population. This concept is related to the [[Red Queen's Hypothesis]], where two organisms co-evolve to overcome each other but each fails to progress relative to the other interactant.

In technology, there are close analogues to the arms races between parasites and hosts, such as the arms race between [[computer virus]] writers and [[antivirus software]] writers, or [[spam (electronic)|spammers]] against [[Internet service provider]]s and [[E-mail]] software writers.

[[File:Crow's-nest (PSF).png|thumb|right|Manning the crow's nest.]]

'''Barrelman''' is in reference to a person who would be stationed in the barrel of the [[foremast]] or [[crow's nest]] of an oceangoing vessel as a [[navigational]] aid. In early ships the crow's nest was simply a [[barrel]] or a basket lashed to the tallest mast. Later it became a specially designed platform with protective railing.

== History ==
According to a popular naval legend, the term derives from the practice of [[Viking]] sailors, who carried [[crow]]s or [[raven]]s in a cage secured to the top of the mast. In cases of poor visibility, a crow was released, and the navigator plotted a course corresponding to the bird's flight path because the crow invariably headed towards the nearest land.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navy.mil/navydata/traditions/html/navyterm.html#crow navy.mil]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some naval scholars have found no evidence of the masthead crow cage and suggest the name was coined simply because the lookout platform resembled a crow's nest in a tree.&lt;ref name=druett&gt;[http://joan-druett.blogspot.ca/2011/02/crows-nest.html Joan Druett, "Crows Nest", ''World of the Written World'', February 13, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;  As ships grew in size and complexity, that station came to be mounted on the highest [[Mast (sailing)|mast]] of the oceangoing vessel, and it came to be known as the ''crow's nest''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nautilus571.com/naval_terms.htm Naval Terms] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928083943/http://www.nautilus571.com/naval_terms.htm |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The simplest construction to providing a lookout and setting course direction for the ship was to lash a barrel to the mast. A member of the crew experienced in the matters of navigation was charged with manning this perch and came to be [[colloquially]] known as a barrelman.

In [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] the term ''barrelman'' was synonymous with the word ''scunner''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritage.nf.ca/dictionary/azindex/pages/3977.html Newfoundland Dictionary] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603225807/http://www.heritage.nf.ca/dictionary/azindex/pages/3977.html |date=June 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rarhi, Bangali, Varendri, Jharkhandi and Sundarbani are not dialects, they are sub groups of Bengali-Assamese languages. Sylheti, Chittagonian and Rajbanshi are languages. Sylheti and Chittagonian are classified as Bangic languages and Rajbanshi is classified as a Kamarupic language. Also except Rarhi none of those groups and languages are linguistically Bengali dialects.|date=August 2018}}

(''the name with *'''bold letter''' are considered as Bengali dialects by some people. Note that except Rarhi and Jharkhandi other groups are not [[linguistics|linguistically]] classified as Bengali dialects. Some also consider Sylheti and Chittagonian as separate languages.)]]
'''The dialects of the [[Bengali language]] (বাংলা উপভাষাসমূহ ''Bangla Upobhashashomuho'')''' are part of the [[List of Eastern Indo-Aryan languages|Eastern]] [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] language group of the [[Indo-European language family]] widely spoken in the [[Bengal]] region of [[South Asia]]. Although the spoken dialects of Bengali are [[mutually intelligible]] with neighbouring dialects, they sometimes lack [[mutual intelligibility]] with the Standard Bengali language and sometimes would not be understood by a native speaker of Standard Bengali. However, the '''[[Standardized language|Standard Bengali]]''' emerges from the West-Central or [[Rarhi dialect]] spoken mainly in [[Kolkata]] and [[Nadia district|Nadia]] districts.

Bengali dialects can be thus classified along at least two dimensions: spoken vs. literary variations, and [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige]] vs. regional variations.

==Classifications==
[[Suniti Kumar Chatterji]] and [[Sukumar Sen (linguist)|Sukumar Sen]] classified Bengali Dialects in 5 classes by their [[phonology]] &amp; [[pronunciation]]&lt;ref name="IJL2001"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Indian Journal of Linguistics|date=2001|volume=20|page=79|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0yxhAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Rarhi|publisher=Bhasa Vidya Parishad.|language=en}} NB Barendra refers to Varendri&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;বাংলা ভাষা ও উপভাষা, সুকুমার সেন, আনন্দ পাবলিশার্স {{full citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. They are:

1. '''[[Rarhi dialect]]''': This dialect is spoken in the much Southern part of [[West Bengal]]. Spoken form [[Presidency Division]], [[Murshidabad]], [[Hooghly district|Hooghly]] &amp; [[Bardhaman|Eastern Burdwan]] are fallen under this dialect.

2. '''[[Bangali dialect]]''': Bangali is the most widely spoken dialect of Bengali language. Spoken form of [[Khulna Division]], [[Barisal Division]], [[Dhaka Division]], [[Mymensingh Division]], [[Comilla Division]] and [[Tripura]] are fallen under '''Bangali''' dialect.

3. '''[[Varendri dialect]]''': This variety is spoken in [[Malda district|Malda]], [[South Dinajpur]] &amp; much of [[Rajshahi Division]] (previously part of [[Varendra]] or Barind division).

4. '''[[Jharkhandi dialect]]''': Jharkhandi is spoken in western most districts like [[Bardhaman|Burdwan]], [[Bankura]], [[Midnapur|Medinipur]] &amp; [[Purulia]] in [[West Bengal]] and it is the dialect of Bengali spoken in [[Santhal Pargana division]] and [[Kolhan division]] in [[Jharkhand]] and its nearby Bengali spoken regions.

5. '''[[Rajbanshi dialect]]''': This dialect is spoken in [[Rangpur Division]] of [[Bangladesh]] &amp; northernmost district of West Bengal like [[North Dinajpur]], [[Jalpaiguri]], [[Coochbehar]] &amp; it's nearby Bengali spoken areas.

6. '''[[Sundarbani dialect]]''': Some linguists have also mentioned this.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.satkhira.gov.bd/site/page/f63bad83-1c4a-11e7-8f57-286ed488c766/a/a&lt;/ref&gt; Dialect of [[Satkhira District]] &amp; [[24 Parganas]] district don't share the common features of both [[Bangali dialect|Bangali]] &amp; [[Rarhi dialect|Rarhi]] dialects. So that this dialect is classified as a unique dialect.

In addition to the six above, there is also [[Sylheti language|Sylheti]], which is considered by some as a dialect while others consider it as a separate language due to the history of the [[Greater Sylhet]] region and the fact that the language has had its own script in the past. Secondly, there is the [[Chittagonian language]] which is also does not fit the other categories due to it being equally similar to both the [[Bengali language]] and the [[Rohingya language]].

==Spoken and literary variants==
More than other languages of South Asia, Bengali exhibits strong [[diglossia]] between the formal, written language and the vernacular, spoken language. Two styles of writing, involving somewhat different vocabularies and syntax, have emerged :&lt;ref name="daniul"&gt;{{cite book |last=Huq |first=Mohammad Daniul |year=2012 |chapter=Chalita Bhasa |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Chalita_Bhasa |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="daniul1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Huq |first=Mohammad Daniul |year=2012 |chapter=Sadhu Bhasa |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Sadhu_Bhasa |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Shadhubhasha'' (সাধুভাষা) is the written language with longer verb inflections and a more Sanskrit-derived (তৎসম ''tôtshôm'') vocabulary (সাধু ''shadhu'' = 'chaste' or 'sage'; ভাষা ''bhasha'' = 'language'). Songs such as India's national anthem ''[[Jana Gana Mana]]'' (by [[Rabindranath Tagore]]) and national song ''[[Vande Mātaram]]'' (by [[Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay]]) were composed in Shadhubhasha, but its use is on the wane in modern writing.
# ''Choltibhasha'' (চলতিভাষা ) or ''Cholitobhasha'' (চলিতভাষা), a written Bengali style that reflects a more colloquial idiom, is increasingly the standard for written Bengali (চলিত ''cholito'' = 'current' or 'running'). This form came into vogue towards the turn of the 19th century, in an [[orthography]] promoted in the writings of [[Peary Chand Mitra]] (''Alaler ghare dulal'', 1857),&lt;ref name="alal"&gt;{{cite book |last=Huq |first=Mohammad Daniul |year=2012 |chapter=Alaler Gharer Dulal |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Alaler_Gharer_Dulal |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pramatha Chowdhury (''Sabujpatra'', 1914) and in the later writings of [[Rabindranath Tagore]]. It is modelled on the dialect spoken in the districts bordering the lower reaches of the [[Hooghly River]], particularly the [[Shantipur]] region in [[Nadia district]], West Bengal. This form of Bengali is sometimes called the "Nadia standard".&lt;ref name="morshed"&gt;{{cite book |last=Morshed |first=Abul Kalam Manjoor |year=2012 |chapter=Dialect |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Dialect |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spoken Bengali exhibits far more variation than written Bengali. Formal spoken Bengali, including what is heard in news reports, speeches, announcements, and lectures, is modelled on Choltibhasha. This form of spoken Bengali stands alongside other spoken dialects, or ''Ancholik Bangla'' (আঞ্চলিক বাংলা) (i.e. 'regional Bengali'). The majority of Bengalis are able to communicate in more than one dialect – often, speakers are fluent in Choltibhasha, one or more Ancholik dialect, and one or more forms of ''Gramyo Bangla'' (গ্রাম্য বাংলা) (i.e. 'rural Bengali'), dialects specific to a village or town.

To a non-Bengali, these dialects may sound or look vastly different, but the differences are mostly in phonology and vocabulary, and not so much a grammatical one, one exception is the addition of grammatical gender in some eastern dialects. Many dialects share features with the so-called ''Shadhu Bhasha'' or "pure language", which was the written standard until the 19th century. Comparison of Bengali dialects gives us an idea about archaic forms of the language as well.

During standardisation of Bengali in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the cultural elite were mostly from the regions of [[Kolkata]], [[Hooghly (town)|Hooghly]], [[Howrah]], [[North 24 Parganas]] and [[Nadia District|Nadia]]. What is accepted as the standard form today in both West Bengal and Bangladesh is based on the West-Central dialect. While the language has been standardised today through two centuries of education and media, variation is widespread, with many speakers familiar with or fluent in both their socio-geographical variety as well as the standard dialect used in the media.

==Regional dialect differences==
Dialectal differences in Bengali manifest themselves in three forms: [[standardised dialect]] vs. regional dialect, literary language vs. colloquial language and lexical (vocabulary) variations. The name of the dialects generally originates from the district where the language is spoken.

While the standard form of the language does not show much variation across the Bengali-speaking areas of South Asia, regional variation in spoken Bengali constitutes a [[dialect continuum]]. Mostly speech varies across distances of just few miles and takes distinct forms among the religious communities. Apart from the present dialects, there are a few more which have disappeared. For example, 'Bikramapuri', Sātagāiyã' (this is the name used in [[East Bengal]] for the dialect of South-western Rarh region). The present dialects of Bengali are listed below with an example sentence meaning:

::English translation: "A man had two sons." (M=male indicated i.e. A man had two sons, P= person indicated, without gender, i.e. A person had two sons)

::Bengali Shadhubhasha: "æk bektir duiṭi putrô chhilô." (P)

===West Central dialects===

These dialect are mostly spoken in and around the [[Hooghly River|Bhagirathi River]] basin, in West Central Bengal. The standard form of the colloquial language (''Choltibhasha'') has developed out of the [[Nadia district|Nadia]] dialect.

::[[Nadia District|Nadia]]/''Choltibhasha'' Standard: æk jon loker duţi chhele chhilo. (M)

::[[Kolkata]]: æk jon loker duţo chhele chhilo. (M)

===Eastern Dialects===

::[[Manikganj District|Manikganj]]: æk zoner duiđi saoal asilo. (P)

::[[Mymensingh District|Mymensingh]]: æk zôner dui put asilo. (P)

::[[Munshiganj District|Munshiganj]] ([[Bikrampur]]): æk jôner duiđa pola asilo. (P)

::[[Comilla District|Comilla]]: æk bæđar/zôner dui put asilo. (P)

::[[Noakhali District|Noakhali]] ([[Sandwip]]): egga mainsher duga hut/hola asilo.

::[[Noakhali]] ([[Feni District|Feni]]): egga mainsher duga hut:
hut/hola asilo. (P)

::[[Noakhali]] (Hatia): egga mainsher duga hut/hola asilo. (P)

::[[Noakhali]] (Ramganj): egga mainsher duga hut/hola asilo. (P)

::[[Chittagong District|Chittagong]]: ugga mainshôr dugga fua asil. (P)

::[[Sylhet District|Sylhet]]: ex betar dugu fua aslo (M)

::[[Moulvibazar District|Moulvibazar]] ex betar duita fua asil (M)

===South Bengal dialects===

::[[Chuadanga District|Chuadanga]] : æk jon lokir duiţo seile silo. (M)

::[[Khulna District|Khulna]]: æk zon manshir dui soal silo. (P)

::[[Jessore District|Jessore]]: æk zoner duđe soal sêlo. (P)

::[[Barisal District|Barisal]] (Bakerganj): æk bedar dugga pola alhe. (P)

::[[Faridpur District|Faridpur]]: kero mansher dugga pola silo. (P)

::[[Satkhira District|Satkhira]]: æk loker duđi sabal selo.

::[[Kushtia District|Kushtia]]: æk mansher duđi seile silo.

===North Bengal dialects===

This dialect is mainly spoken in the districts of [[North Bengal]]. These are the only dialects in Bangladesh that pronounce the letters চ, ছ, জ, and ঝ as affricates {{IPA|[tʃ]}}, {{IPA|[tʃʰ]}}, {{IPA|[dʒ]}}, and {{IPA|[dʒʱ]}}, respectively, and preserve the breathy-voiced stops in all parts of the word, much like Western dialects (including Standard Bengali). The dialects of Rangpur and Pabna do not have contrastive nasalised vowels.

::[[Dinajpur District, Bangladesh|Dinajpur]]: æk manusher dui chhaoa chhilô (P)

::[[Pabna District|Pabna]]: kono mansher dui chhaoal chhilô. (P)

::[[Bogra District|Bogra]]: æk jôn mansher dui chhara chhoul chhilô. (P)

::East [[Malda District|Malda]]: æk jhôn manuser duţa bêţa achhlô. (P)

::[[Rangpur District|Rangpur]]: æk zon mansher duikna bêţa asil. (P)

::[[Rajshahi District|Rajshahi]]: æk loker duida bæta chhilo. (P)

===Western Border dialects===

This dialect is spoken in the area which is known as Manbhum.

::[[Manbhumi]]: ek loker duţa beţa chhilô. (M)

::[[Purba Medinipur District|East Medinipur]]: gote loker duita toka thilo. (P)

The latter two, along with [[Kharia Thar language|Kharia Thar]] and [[Mal Paharia language|Mal Paharia]], are closely related to Western Bengali dialects, but are typically classified as separate languages. Similarly, [[Rajbangsi language|Rajbangsi]] and Hajong are considered separate languages, although they are very similar to North Bengali dialects. There are many more minor dialects as well, including those spoken in the bordering districts of [[Purnea]] and [[Singhbhum]] and among the tribals of the eastern Bangladesh like the [[Hajong people|Hajong]] and the [[Chakma people|Chakma]].

===Closely related languages===

::[[Assamese language|Assamese]]: manuh ezônôr duta putek asil.

::[[Hajong language|Hajong]]: ek zôn manôlôg duida pôla thakibar.

::[[Chakma language|Chakma]]: ek jônôtun diba poa el.

===Phonological variations===
There are marked dialectal differences between the speech of Bengalis living on the পশ্চিম ''Poshchim'' (western) side and পূর্ব ''Purbo'' (eastern) side of the [[Padma River]].

Bengali dialects include '''Eastern''' and '''Southeastern Bengali dialects''': The Eastern dialects serve as the primary colloquial language of the [[Dhaka]] district. In contrast to Western dialects where ট　{{IPA|/ʈ/}} and ড {{IPA|/ɖ/}} are unvoiced and voiced retroflex stops respectively, most Eastern and Southeastern dialects pronounce them as apical alveolar {{IPA|/t̠/}} and {{IPA|/d̠/}}, especially in less formal speech. These dialects also lack contrastive nasalised vowels or a distinction in approximant র {{IPA|/ɹ/}}, tap ড় {{IPA|/ɾ/}} and flap ঢ় {{IPA|/ɽ/}}, pronouncing them mostly as {{IPA|/ɾ/}}, although some speakers may realise র {{IPA|/ɹ/}} when occurring before a consonant or prosodic break. This is also true of the [[Sylheti language]], which has a lot in common with the [[Kamrupi dialect]] of Assam in particular, and is often considered a separate language. The Eastern dialects extend into Southeastern dialects, which include parts of Chittagong. The [[Chittagonian language|Chittagongian dialect]] has [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman influences]].

====Fricatives====
In the dialects prevalent in much of eastern Bangladesh ([[Barisal]], [[Chittagong]], and [[Dhaka]]), many of the stops and affricates heard in Kolkata Bengali are pronounced as [[Fricative consonant|fricatives]].

Poshchim Bengali (Western Bengali) [[postalveolar consonant|palato-alveolar]] affricates চ {{IPA|[tʃ]}}, ছ {{IPA|[tʃʰ]}}, জ {{IPA|[dʒ]}}, and ঝ {{IPA|[dʒʱ]}} correspond to Purbo Bengali (Eastern Bengali) চʻ {{IPA|[ts]}}~{{IPA|[tɕ]}}, ছ় {{IPA|[s]}}~{{IPA|[tsʰ]}}, জʻ {{IPA|[dz]}}~{{IPA|[z]}}, and ঝ় {{IPA|[z]}}. A similar pronunciation is also found in [[Assamese language|Assamese]], a related language across the border in India.

The aspirated velar stop খ {{IPA|[kʰ]}} and the aspirated labial stop ফ {{IPA|[pʰ]}} of Poshchim Bengali correspond to খ় {{IPA|[x]}}~{{IPA|[ʜ]}} in some and ফ় {{IPA|[ɸ]}}~{{IPA|[f]}} in many dialects of Purbo Bengali. 

Many Purbo Bengali dialects share phonological features with Assamese, including the debuccalisation of শ {{IPA|[ʃ]}} to হ {{IPA|[h]}} or খ় {{IPA|[x]}}.

====Tibeto-Burman influence====
The influence of [[Tibeto-Burman languages]] on the phonology of Purbo Bengali (Bangladesh) is seen through the lack of nasalised vowels, an alveolar articulation for the [[Retroflex consonant|Retroflex]] [[Stop consonant|stops]] ট {{IPA|[ʈ]}}, ঠ {{IPA|[ʈʰ]}}, ড {{IPA|[ɖ]}}, and ঢ {{IPA|[ɖʱ]}}, resembling the equivalent phonemes in languages such as [[Thai language|Thai]] and [[Lao language|Lao]] and the lack of distinction between র {{IPA|[ɹ]}} and ড়/ঢ় {{IPA|[ɽ]}}. Unlike most languages of the region, some Purbo Bengali dialects do not include the breathy voiced stops ঘ {{IPA|[ɡʱ]}}, ঝ {{IPA|[dʑʱ]}}, ঢ {{IPA|[ɖʱ]}}, ধ {{IPA|[d̪ʱ]}}, and ভ {{IPA|[bʱ]}}. Some variants of Bengali, particularly Chittagonian and Chakma Bengali, have contrastive [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]; differences in the pitch of the speaker's voice can distinguish words. In dialects such as [[Hajong language|Hajong]] of northern Bangladesh, there is a distinction between ''উ'' and ''ঊ'' , the first corresponding exactly to its standard counterpart but the latter corresponding to the Japanese {{IPA|[ü͍]}} sound {{Audio|Ja-U.oga|''listen''}}. There is also a distinction between ''ই'' and ''ঈ'' in many northern Bangladeshi dialects. ''ই'' representing the {{IPAblink|ɪ}} sound whereas ''ঈ'' represents a {{IPAblink|i}}.

'''Bornholmsk''' is a [[Danish dialects|Danish dialect]] spoken on the island of [[Bornholm]] in the [[Baltic Sea]]. It was originally part of the [[Scanian dialects|East Danish dialect]] continuum, which includes the dialects of southern Sweden, but became isolated in the Danish dialect landscape after 1658, when [[Sweden]] annexed [[Skåne]], [[Halland]] and [[Blekinge]].&lt;ref&gt;Rendahl, A. C. (2001). Swedish dialects around the Baltic Sea. The Circum-Baltic languages: typology and contact, ed. by Östen Dahl and Maria Koptjevskaja-Tamm, 137-178.&lt;/ref&gt;

The language is more generally spoken than written, despite the existence of several Bornholmsk-Danish dictionaries and a regular Bornholmsk article in the local newspaper. Even words that are never used in Standard Danish are spelled according to the standard orthography.

The dialect is endangered, as the inhabitants of Bornholm have been shifting to standard Danish over the past century.&lt;ref&gt;http://rudar.ruc.dk:8080/bitstream/1800/6898/1/Projekt%20dialekt%20Marianne%20Mortensen.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Inge Lise Pedersen. 2003. Traditional dialects of Danish and the de-dialectalization 1900-2000. International Journal of the Sociology of Language. Volume 2003, Issue 159, Pages 9–28, ISSN (Online) 1613-3668&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kristensen, K., &amp; Thelander, M. (1984). On dialect levelling in Denmark and Sweden. Folia linguistica, 18(1-2), 223-246.&lt;/ref&gt; "Bevar Bornholmsk" is an organization whose purpose is to preserve Bornholmsk. Its main organization is KulturBornholm, the editor of books with CDs with the text in Bornholmsk.

== Dialects ==
The small island has only about 40,000 inhabitants, yet the language is divided into five main dialects, not counting standard Danish. As an example, ''eye'' would be spelled ''iva'' in some regions, but elsewhere it would be ''øja'', which is quite close to the Danish word ''øje''.

The northern part of the island would have more influence by Swedish than the rest of the island, due to the relatively large number of Swedish immigrants on those shores closest to Sweden. The differences are actually large enough so that the north-Bornholm dialect is called ''Allinge-svensk'' ("Allinge-Swedish") in Danish – ''Âlinga-svænsk'' in Bornholmsk.

== Danish or Swedish?==

Like in the case of the closely related [[Scanian dialects|Scanian]] dialect spoken in Southern Sweden, the question whether the dialect is Danish or Swedish cannot be separated from the political and ideological burden attached to language as an ethnic marker. Therefore, Danes from other parts of the country may accuse people from Bornholm for speaking Swedish as a kind of insult (using derogatory nicknames like ''reservesvensker'', "auxiliary Swede").

From a linguistic point of view, the [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian languages]] form a [[Dialect continuum|continuum]], and the dialects of [[Skåne]] and [[Bornholm]] are a natural bridge between "sjællandsk" (the dialect of [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]]) and "götamål" (the dialect of [[Götaland]]). One may define "Danish" and Swedish" in two different ways:
# historically: Danish is the part of the dialect continuum that has certain sound changes in common like the weakening of plosives (see below) or certain innovations in the vocabulary.
# sociolinguistically: Danish is the part of the dialect continuum that has Standard Danish as its written standard ([[Dachsprache]]).
According to both criteria, Bornholmsk is indeed a Danish dialect (whereas Scanian would be Swedish according to the second one).

Bornholmsk has indeed many phonetical features in common with Swedish (most of them archaisms, though, which are irrelevant for the classification of the dialect). Yet, in most cases where the vocabularies of Swedish and Danish differ, Bornholmsk stands with Danish.

==Phonology ==
===Sound system===
An official standardised orthography of Bornholmsk does not exist since Standard Danish is taught in schools and is the language of all public communication. However, dialect texts use a simplified phonetical alphabet (invented by K.J. Lyngby in the 19th century and also employed in Espersen's dictionary of Bornholmsk):

A stressed syllable always contains either a long vowel or a long consonant (like in Swedish, but unlike Standard Danish, where there are no long consonants). Bornholmsk does not have the [[stød]] characteristic of most varieties of Danish, but on the other hand, it does not have the musical accent characteristic of Swedish and Norwegian either.

===Phonetic development ===
In the list, there is special emphasis on the developments that set Bornholmsk apart from Standard Danish. For the sake of convenience, Old Norse (i.e. Old Icelandic) forms have been quoted instead of Old Danish forms.

== Morphology ==
===Nominal inflection===

Bornholmsk has retained three distinct [[grammatical genders]], like [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] or [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], and unlike standard [[Danish language|Danish]] or [[Swedish language|Swedish]]. The gender inflection exists not only in the definite article (like in [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and certain Danish dialects), but also in the adjectives:

''-er'' is the old ending of the masculine nominative still extant in German (''-er''), Icelandic (''-ur'') and Faroese (''-ur''), but lost in the other Scandinavian dialects (except for certain old phrases like Danish ''en ungersvend'', originally ''en unger svend'', "a young fellow"). In Bornholmsk, it is used in all cases (since the dialect has not retained the Old Danish case flexion).

Masculine nouns normally have the plural ending ''-a'' - and this is also the case when the singular ends in a vowel (where Standard Danish would have ''-er''), e.g. ''skâwwa'' "woods" (sg. ''skâww''), ''tima'' "hours" (sg. ''tima''). Feminine nouns have ''-er'' or, when they end in a vowel in the singular, ''-ar''. Neuter nouns have zero ending, and the definite article of the neuter plural is ''-en'', e.g. ''huz'' "houses", ''huzen'' "the houses" (sg. ''huz'')

===Pronouns===

Bornholmsk has an [[enclitic]] form of the personal pronoun that is unknown in the other Danish dialects, namely masculine ''-iń'' "him" and feminine ''-na'' "her". They originate from the old accusatives ''hann'' and ''hana'' still used in Icelandic, whereas the Scandinavian languages, apart from dialects of for example [[Swedish language|Swedish]], normally use the old dative form for the oblique case (Danish ''ham'', ''hende'', Swedish ''honom'', ''henne''). These enclitic forms also occur in spoken Norwegian, where ''-n'' is masculine and ''-a'' is feminine. Colloquial and dialectal Swedish has them as well: jag har sett'n/sett'na "I have seen him/her".

===Verbal conjugation ===
Until the 20th century, Bornholmsk inflected the verbs in number, e.g. ''jâ bińńer'' "I bind" ~ ''vi bińńa'' "we bind", ''jâ bânt'' "I bound" ~ ''vi bonne'' "we bound". Spoken Danish gave up this inflection in the 18th century already, even though it was still practiced in the literary language until it was officially cancelled in 1900 (''jeg binder'' ~ ''vi binde'').

Bornholmsk also has special endings for the 2nd person, when a pronoun follows immediately after the ending, namely ''-st'' in the singular and ''-en'' in the plural:
: ''såstu-na'' "did you see her" (SD ''så du hende'')
: ''gån i'' "are you going" (SD ''går I'')
: ''varren så goa'' "here you are" (SD ''vær så god, værsgo''; lit. "be so good/kind")

''Ligstenen ...''&lt;br /&gt;
det er sådan en stor, flad sten, den er tre gange så stor som bordet her, vel. Og den ligger ved vejen som kommer ovre fra Klinteby og går over imod Kodal til. Og der gik jo altså sagnet i gamle dage - for Klintebyboerne, de hørte med til Ibsker sogn og Ibsker Kirke, så når de døde, de skulle blive båret til Ibsker, så bar de den på sådan en bærer. Og så hvilede de dér på - på Ligstenen. Og så havde de jo mad i kurven, brændevinsflasker med, selvfølgelig. De skulle jo have sig en slurk at styrke sig på. Og så vandrede de videre, for de måtte jo ikke sætte kisten på jorden.&lt;br /&gt;
''Man kunne jo tro at de underjordiske holdt til på de steder...''&lt;br /&gt;
Ja - det gjorde de, de gamle troede på det der, som - ja det gjorde de. Og det – rakkeren, han boede jo altid derude. Det var jo ham som flåede de selvdøde kreaturer og slagtede heste og sådan noget - han måtte jo ikke bo på indmarken, han skulle bo på lyngen. Han havde sådan en gammel lynghytte derude. Far, han kunne huske det, sagde han - vidste hvor han havde boet. Og - så når han gik til alters, så måtte han ikke drikke - for den gangen drak de jo af samme bæger, alle sammen, men han skulle drikke af foden på bægeret - han måtte ikke drikke på det der, han var jo ... &lt;br /&gt;
''uren ...''&lt;br /&gt;
ja, han var uren, ja. da han kom til Svaneke en gang og skulle handle - så - og dengang fik de jo gerne altid en snaps når de kom ind til købmanden og skulle handle. Så kom der jo den der - sådan rakker og ja - og så - hvad, de skænkede jo bare i det samme glas til alle sammen. Og så - han fik jo en slurk, og så skulle den næste have. Derfor sagde han så: "Jeg skal fandme ikke drikke af det glas som han har drukket af."

''The corpse stone ...''&lt;br /&gt;
it is like a large, flat stone, three times this table, I gather. And it lies on the road that comes from Klinteby and goes to Kodal. Well, there was this legend in old days – you know, the people of Klinteby used to belong to the parish of Ibsker and the church of Ibsker, so when the dead were going to be carried to Ibsker, they would carry it on such a carrier. And they would rest there on the Corpse Stone. And then they would have food in the basket – bottles of snaps. of course- After all, they would need a sip to strengthen themselves. And then, they would carry on, for they weren't supposed to set the coffin on the ground.&lt;br /&gt;
''You'd think, the people of the underground would live in such places...''&lt;br /&gt;
Yes, they did, the old ones believed in that stuff, yes, they did. And it – the horse butcher, he always lived there, you know. He was the one that skinned the self-dead cattle and butchered horses and stuff. He wasn't supposed to live in the in-field, you know, he had to live on the heath. he had like an old heath hut out there. Dad, he remembered it, he said, knew where he had lived. And – when he went to the communion, he wasn't supposed to drink – for at that time, they all drank from the same cup, you know, but he had to drink from the foot of the cup – he wasn't supposed to drink on it, he was, you know ... &lt;br /&gt;
''unclean...''&lt;br /&gt;
yes, he was unclean, he was. So once he came to Svaneke and went shopping – you know, they would always take a little snaps when they visited the grocer at that time. So, this, this butcher came and, then, what happened? They poured in the same glass for everybody, you know. And he had a sip, and then the next was supposed to drink. So, he said: "Damn it, I  won't drink from that glass he drank from."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11890">A '''carbon diet''' refers to reducing the impact on [[climate change]] by reducing [[greenhouse gas]] production specifically, [[CO2]] production. In today’s society, humans produce CO2 in every day activities such as driving, heating, [[deforestation]] and the burning of [[fossil fuels]] such as coal, oil and gas. It has been found that carbon dioxide from the burning of coal, [[natural gas]], and oil for electricity and heat is the largest single source of global greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref&gt;C. (2017, February 14). Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions Data. Retrieved February 26, 2017, from https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-data&lt;/ref&gt; For years, governments and corporations have been attempting to balance out their emissions by participating in [[carbon-offsetting]] — the practice in which they invest in renewable energy to compensate for the global-warming [[pollution]] that they produce. Despite these efforts the results are still far off and we continue to see growth in CO2 concentration. Now, a growing number of individuals are trying to make a reduction in the amount of CO2 that is being produced by participating in low carbon dieting. This small adjustment in household CO2 production has the potential to reduce emissions much more quickly than other kinds of changes and it deserves explicit consideration as part of climate policy.&lt;ref name= DIETZ/&gt; It can potentially help avoid “overshoot” of greenhouse gas concentration targets; provide a demonstration effect; reduce emissions at low cost; and buy time to develop new technologies, policies, and institutions to reach long-term greenhouse gas emission targets and to develop adaptation strategies.&lt;ref name= DIETZ&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1073/pnas.0908738106|title=Household actions can provide a behavioral wedge to rapidly reduce US carbon emissions|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=106|issue=44|pages=18452|year=2009|last1=Dietz|first1=T.|last2=Gardner|first2=G.

==Participating in carbon dieting==

Global carbon dioxide concentrations are beginning to rise on an annual basis. According to senior NASA scientist Roy Spencer, the reality of global warming should not be disputed and that we should instead turn our attention towards the growth per year. The past decade has produced nine of the eleven hottest years recorded this century.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, R.  (2000). New Study to Help Resolve Global Warming Controversy. (2000). Industrial Environment, 11(3), 1.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Kintigh Generating Station - Somerset, New York.jpg|thumb|Kintigh Generating Station - Somerset, New York]] The resulting buildup of carbon in areas such as the atmosphere, oceans, and soil contain a major threat to life. The threat of global warming has been an issue we have discovered due to high concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere but have not addressed as a global community. Not only is climate change an [[environmental issue]], it is also a humanitarian and economical one as well because of the massive global impact it has.&lt;ref name=KURTZ&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=20699648|title=The Low-Carbon Diet: How the Market Can Curb Climate Change|first=Joel|last=Kurtzman|date=1 January 2009|publisher=|volume=88|issue=5|pages=114–122}}&lt;/ref&gt; We continue to live our lives as if we are not at the forefront of the problem as politicians tell us that global warming is a natural occurrence instead of a man-made one. As human beings, we are the focal point of the problem. It is our duty to be the ones who salvage the remaining resources we have left for future generations. An idea that has been put forth by multiple carbon resource management agencies recently is the utilization of [[cap-and-trade]] market systems.&lt;ref name=KURTZ/&gt; With cap-and-trade systems, these agencies are able to trade permits for carbon sources so that the reservoirs are partitioned amongst various groups.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, D. M. (1998). Global warming: The controversy. Sea Technology, 39(2), 7. Retrieved from https://search.proquest.com/docview/198563948&lt;/ref&gt; Implementing such a system will result in a decrease of carbon dioxide emissions over time as long as it is utilized effectively from all parties involved. However, as long as there is economic growth there is lesser chance of governing bodies providing sufficient amounts of funding in order to repair the damage that has been done by pollution. The budget that governments allocate to resource preservation initiatives are far below the amount that needs to be allocated in order to see real change. It is estimated that the value of emissions permits will be roughly $60 billion a year in 2012 and will continue to increase up to $113 billion 2025.&lt;ref name=KURTZ/&gt;

There are many ways that individual households can participate in low carbon dieting. Reducing electricity expenditure by using energy efficient light bulbs and appliances can drastically shift the impact of CO2 emissions created by modern households. Common examples of alternate energy sources are hydro and wind systems as they are cleaner than natural gas and other alternate forms of energy production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2015.12.042|title=Carbon emissions reductions and technology gaps in the world's factory, 1990–2012|journal=Energy Policy|volume=91|pages=28|year=2016|last1=Zhang|first1=Ning|last2=Wang|first2=Bing|last3=Chen|first3=Zhongfei}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of hybrid cars have been a popular idea amongst car companies in order to provide customers with an option that is economically and environmentally appealing. A common behavior that severely impacts the environment is idling in a vehicle for long periods of time; leading to upwards of 17% of the gasoline being burned into the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;Withgott, Jay et al. (2017) Environment: The Science Behind The Stories. 3rd ed., Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, Pearson Canada Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Driving less and using alternate forms of transportation such as bicycles can also help reduce the impact of greenhouse gas emissions. Some other research conducted by the [[Center for Sustainable Systems]] at the University of Michigan found some interesting facts on the impact of CO2 in the [[United States]] and how to reduce CO2 emissions in U.S households. It was found that washing clothes on ‘cold’ reduces CO2 emissions by 1.2-14.9 pounds per laundry load, depending on washing machine type, hot water temperature, and electricity source. It was also found that eating all locally grown food for one year could save the greenhouse gas equivalent of driving 1,000 miles, while eating a vegetarian meal one day a week could save the equivalent of driving 1,160 miles. 
A vegetarian diet greatly reduces an individual’s [[carbon footprint]], but switching between different types of meat can have a major impact as well.  For example, replacing all beef consumption with chicken for one year leads to an annual carbon footprint reduction of 882 pounds of CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalency).&lt;ref&gt;U. (n.d.). Carbon Footprint Factsheet. Retrieved March 13, 2017, from http://css.snre.umich.edu/factsheets/carbon-footprint-factsheet&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate change mitigation policies tend to focus on the energy sector, while the livestock sector receives surprisingly little attention, despite the fact that it accounts for 18% of the greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref name=Stehfest&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1007/s10584-008-9534-6|title=Climate benefits of changing diet|journal=Climatic Change|volume=95|pages=83|year=2009|last1=Stehfest|first1=Elke|last2=Bouwman|first2=Lex|last3=Van Vuuren|first3=Detlef P.|last4=Den Elzen|first4=Michel G. J.|last5=Eickhout|first5=Bas|last6=Kabat|first6=Pavel}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been some research conducted by using an integrated assessment model finding a global food transition to less meat, or even a complete switch to plant-based protein food to have a dramatic effect on land use. Up to 2,700 Mha of pasture and 100 Mha of cropland could be abandoned, resulting in a large carbon uptake from regrowing vegetation. Additionally, methane and nitrous oxide emission would be reduced substantially.&lt;ref name=Stehfest/&gt; Some food choices supply energy more efficiently than others, for instance, 20 kilograms of feed must be provided to cattle in order to produce 1 kilogram of edible produce. If an organism is placed high on the trophic level the greater the loss of energy due to digestion and metabolism. A cow needs to eat a lot of food in order to maintain its body mass and muscle tissue, but the nutritional benefits of the food is diminished once it is digested and metabolized. A diet developed around plant based food items are seen as energy efficient as they utilize the Sun’s energy for photosynthesis. Based on an average 2,000 kcal diet, the high meat diet had 2.5 times as many greenhouse gas emissions than the average 2,000 kcal vegan diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1007/s10584-014-1169-1|pmid=25834298|title=Dietary greenhouse gas emissions of meat-eaters, fish-eaters, vegetarians and vegans in the UK|journal=Climatic Change|volume=125|issue=2|pages=179|year=2014|last1=Scarborough|first1=Peter|last2=Appleby|first2=Paul N.|last3=Mizdrak|first3=Anja|last4=Briggs|first4=Adam D. M.|last5=Travis|first5=Ruth C.|last6=Bradbury|first6=Kathryn E.|last7=Key|first7=Timothy J.|pmc=4372775}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The production of CO2 continues to be a global issue in relation to climate change. Although the research has only been conducted for certain countries thus far, these strategies to reduce CO2 emissions per household can be effective globally if acted upon.  The simplicity of carbon dieting in households and its potential for significant change needs to become an idea that is promoted around the world. If carbon dieting becomes a norm in households we could see a major change in greenhouse gas emissions and therefore a reduction in global warming.

== Key components of a carbon diet ==
A carbon diet is similar to a food diet.  It starts with assessing weight (measured in tonnes of carbon dioxide) and then determining where the ideal weight should be.  The following outlines the steps of a carbon diet:
* Calculate a [[carbon footprint]] to understand the amount of carbon dioxide emissions
* Measure the carbon footprint against peers (e.g., similar company size or for individuals, a national average)
* Determine the ideal carbon footprint
* Identify the source of the most significant carbon dioxide emissions &lt;ref&gt;Data and studies on CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from common goods and services are at [http://co2.homestead.com/files/carbon.htm CO2List.org]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reduce carbon dioxide emissions by starting with the most significant sources first

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6161">A '''catastrophic failure''' is a sudden and total [[failure]] from which recovery is impossible. Catastrophic failures often lead to [[Cascading failure|cascading systems failure]]. The term is most commonly used for [[structural failures]], but has often been extended to many other disciplines in which total and irrecoverable loss occurs. Such failures are investigated using the methods of [[forensic engineering]], which aims to isolate the cause or causes of failure.

For example, catastrophic failure can be observed in [[steam turbine#Two-flow rotors|steam turbine rotor]] failure, which can occur due to peak stress on the rotor; stress concentration increases up to a point at which it is excessive, leading ultimately to the failure of the disc.

In firearms, catastrophic failure usually refers to a rupture or disintegration of the barrel or receiver of the gun when firing it. Some possible causes of this are an [[out of battery|out-of-battery]] gun, an inadequate [[headspace (firearms)|headspace]], the use of incorrect ammunition, the use of ammunition with an incorrect [[propellant]] charge,&lt;ref name="hendrick"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hal W.

A failure of this type, known colloquially as a "kaboom", or "kB" failure, can pose a threat not only to the user(s) but even many bystanders.

In chemical engineering, [[thermal runaway]] can cause catastrophic failure.

Examples of catastrophic failure of engineered structures include:
* The [[Tay Rail Bridge disaster]] of 1879, where the center half mile of the bridge was completely destroyed while a train was crossing in a storm. The bridge was badly designed and its replacement was built as a separate structure upstream of the old.
* The failure of the [[South Fork Dam]] in 1889 released 4.8 billion US gallons (18 billion litres) of water and killed over 2,200 people (popularly known as the [[Johnstown Flood]]).
* The collapse of the [[St. Francis Dam]] in 1928 released 12.4 billion US gallons (47 billion litres) of water, resulting in a death toll of nearly 600 people.
* The collapse of the first [[Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940)|Tacoma Narrows Bridge]] of 1940, where the main deck of the road bridge was totally destroyed by dynamic oscillations in a {{convert|40|mph|kph}} wind.
* The [[De Havilland Comet#Comet disasters of 1954|De Havilland Comet disasters of 1954]], later determined to be structural failures due to [[Fatigue (material)|metal fatigue]] that had not been anticipated at the corners of square windows used by the Comet 1.
* The 62 [[Banqiao Dam]]s failure event in China in 1975, due to [[Typhoon Nina (1975)|Typhoon Nina]]. Approximately 86,000 people died from flooding and another 145,000 died from subsequent diseases, total of 231,000 deaths.
* The [[Hyatt Regency walkway collapse]] of 1981, where a suspended walkway in a hotel lobby in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], collapsed completely, killing over 100 people on and below the structure.
* The [[STS-51-L|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' disaster]] of 1986, in which an O-ring of a rocket booster failed, causing the external fuel tank to break up and making the shuttle veer off course, subjecting it to aerodynamic forces beyond design tolerances; the entire crew and vehicle were lost.
* The [[Nuclear reactor technology|nuclear reactor]] at the [[Chernobyl nuclear power plant|Chernobyl power plant]], which [[Chernobyl disaster|exploded in 1986]] causing the release of a substantial amount of [[radioactive]] materials.
* The collapse of the [[Warsaw radio mast]] of 1991, which had up to that point held the title of [[world's tallest structure]].
* The [[Sampoong Department Store collapse]] of 1995, which happened due to structural weaknesses, killed 502 people and injured 937.
* The [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks]] and subsequent fire at the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]] on September 11, 2001, weakened the floor [[joist]]s to the point of catastrophic failure.
* The [[STS-107|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'' disaster]] of 2003, where damage to a wing during launch resulted in total loss upon re-entry.

In [[linguistics]], '''coercion''' is a term applied to a process of reinterpretation that is triggered by a mismatch between the [[semantics|semantic]] properties of a selector and the [[semantics|semantic]] properties of the selected element.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lauwers|first1=P.|last2=Willems|first2=D.|title=Coercion: Definition and challenges, current approaches, and new trends|journal=Linguistics|date=2011|volume=49|issue=6|pages=1219–1235|url=http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/ling.2011.49.issue-6/ling.2011.034/ling.2011.034.xml?format=INT|accessdate=11 January 2015|doi=10.1515/ling.2011.034}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term was first used in the semantic literature by Marc Moens and [[Mark Steedman]], who adopted it on "loose analogy with type-coercion in programming languages".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Marc Moens|author2=Mark Steedman|title=Temporal Ontology and Temporal Reference|journal=Computational Linguistics|date=1988|volume=14|issue=2|pages=15–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the framework of the generative lexicon (a formal compositional approach to lexical semantics), Pustejovsky (1995:111) defines coercion as "a semantic operation that converts an argument to the type which is expected by a function, where it would otherwise result in a type error." "Coercion" in the Pustejovsky framework includes complement coercion and aspectual coercion.&lt;ref name=Pust1995&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pustejovsky|first1=James|title=The Generative Lexicon|date=1995|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of complement coercion is the sentence "I began the book", where the predicate "began" is assumed to be a selector which requires its complement to denote an event, but "a book" denotes an entity, not an event. So, on the coercion analysis, "begin" coerces "a book" from an entity to an event involving that entity, allowing the sentence to be interpreted to mean, e.g., "I began to read a book," or "I began to write a book." &lt;ref name=Pust1995/&gt;

An example of aspectual coercion involving temporal connectives is "Let's leave after dessert" (Pustejovsky 1995:230). Another example of aspectual coercion from psycholinguistics research includes sentences such as "The tiger jumped for an hour," where the prepositional phrase "for an hour" coerces the lexical meaning of "jump" to be iterative across the entire duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Piñango |first1=Maria |last2=Winnick |first2=Aaron |last3=Zurif |first3=Edgar |last4=Ullah |first4=Rashad |date=2006 |title=The Time Course of Semantic Composition: The Case of Aspectual Coercion |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10936-006-9013-z?LI=true |journal=Journal of Psycholinguistic Research |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=233–244 |doi= 10.1007/s10936-006-9013-z |access-date= July 18, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coercion is closely related to the notions of active zone, [[construal]]/[[conceptualization]], and [[syntactic]] [[Communication accommodation theory|accommodation]] known from various schools within the [[cognitive linguistics]] movement.

A '''deleted scene''' is [[footage]] that has been removed from the final version of a film or television show. 

A related term is '''extended scene''', the longer version of a scene that was shortened for the final version of the film. Often, extended scenes are included in collections of deleted scenes or are referred to as deleted scenes themselves, as is the case with for instance, ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'' and ''[[Serenity (2005 film)|Serenity]]''.

==Reasons for removal==
{{See also|Re-edited film}}
Scenes are often removed from films at the request of a studio or network, or to reduce running time or to improve narrative flow.

===Requests for alteration===
The studio or network planning to air or distribute it may be uncomfortable with a certain scene. It may ask for it be altered, removed, or replaced.

That is most common in the production of television series since networks and channels often must be mindful of how viewers, critics, or censors will react to programming. There may be a fear of losing ratings, being punished by fines or otherwise, or having trouble finding advertisers.

* The 2002 Fox series ''[[Firefly (television series)|Firefly]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s original pilot episode ("[[Serenity (Firefly episode)|Serenity]]", parts 1 and 2) had such a change made, with the original, less action-packed scene being replaced in the final cut of the episode but featuring on the later [[DVD]] box set release of the series, as one of several bonus features.&lt;ref&gt;Joss Whedon, audio commentary in ''Firefly, The Complete Series'' (DVD box set), 21st Century Fox, 2003
&lt;/ref&gt;

* A scene in the pilot of ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'' involved the destruction of a [[Boeing 747]]. Aired just a few months after the [[9/11 attacks]], the producers made some creative edits to cutout shots of the plane visibly exploding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | doi = 
  | id = 
  | isbn = 1-84357-034-3
  | page = 34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Running time===
Concerns about running time may also cause scenes to be removed or shortening.

In feature films, scenes may be cut to reduce the length of the film's theatrical cut. In television serials, however, running time becomes an even greater concern because of the strict timeslot limitations, especially on channels supported by advertisements, and there may be only 20 minutes of actual show per half-hour timeslot. Depending on the station and the particular format of the show, that may or may not include opening credits or closing credits; many ad-supported stations now "squish" the closing credits or force them into a [[split screen (film)|split-screen]] to show more advertising. Most programs are in either a half-hour or a one-hour timeslot. That forces producers of television serials to break up the [[act (theater)|acts]] in a manner that will (hopefully) make the viewer want to continue watching after the ad break and to avoid exceeding the stricter running time limits.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

===Disruption of narrative flow===
Though the quality of the initial and the final cuts of a film is subjective, a scene or version of a scene in a film may have an adverse effect on the film as a whole. It may slow the film down, provide unnecessary details or exposition, or even explain points that should be implied or said more subtly. It is common to remove such scenes at the editing level, but they may be released on the home video release, as a bonus feature.{{cn|reason=this could use some references to books that discuss the use of cutting materials in films|date=March 2017}}

There are at least a few examples, including a number of the deleted scenes on the DVD release of the sequel film ''[[Serenity (2005 film)|Serenity]]'' (in fact, the audio commentary on the DVD's deleted scenes collection quite often mentions the plot or the tension being disrupted or slowed by including a scene or too much [[exposition (literary technique)|expositional]] as the main reason for the scene's removal from the final theatrical cut. Another well known example is the [[Alien (film)#Post-production|cocoon sequence]] in the film ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]''. The scene added a lot of information about the fate of several crew members and new information on the life cycle of the creature, but it was ultimately deleted, as it was thought to slow down and to disrupt the tension of the end of the film.{{cn|reason=this could use some references to books that discuss the use of cutting materials in films|date=March 2017}}

===Animated Deleted Scenes===

==Formats==
Deleted or extended scenes may be in any of several different formats. They may or may not feature finished [[special effect]]s (especially in [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] films in which visual effects are more expensive), and the film quality may or may not be the same as in the rest of the film, but that may depend only on how much post-production editing was done.{{cn|reason=this could use some references to books that discuss the use of cutting materials in films|date=March 2017}}

Additionally, deleted scenes of animated films may not be in the form of a fully animated scene but instead be included in the form of an [[Storyboard#Animatics|animatic]] or a [[blooper]] form, as is the case with the deleted scenes on the DVD release of [[Pixar]]'s ''[[Toy Story]]'' and ''[[Finding Nemo]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Finding Nemo]]'', DVD, [[Pixar]], 2003&lt;/ref&gt;{{cn|date=March 2017}}

==Parody==

The DVD release for ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s feature film also featured not only a handful of regular deleted scenes but also two spoof "Really Deleted" scenes.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', DVD, Touchstone Pictures, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

''YTV''s ZAPX sometimes makes "deleted scenes" that are not genuine deleted scenes but random scenes of the movie with footage of the program's host, Simon, inserted into the clip, for that purpose.{{cn|reason=this could use some references to books that discuss the use of cutting materials in films|date=March 2017}}

On the DVD for ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'', [["Weird Al" Yankovic]] provides commentary of the deleted scenes and emphasizes that there are hours of film footage but that they were all removed for good reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/65353/uhf-25th-anniversary-edition/|title=UHF (Blu-ray)|author=|date=|website=DVD Talk|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elchin Ilyas oglu Afandiyev''' ({{lang-az|Elçin İlyas oğlu Əfəndiyev}}) is an [[Azerbaijan]]i writer, professor and politician who served as Deputy Prime Minister of Azerbaijan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/world-leaders-1/world-leaders-a/azerbaijan.html | title= CIA.

==Early years==
Afandiyev was born to the family of famous Azerbaijani writer [[Ilyas Afandiyev]] on May 13, 1943 in [[Baku]]. Since his early childhood, Elchin Afandiyev was surrounded by literature and an academic environment. Azerbaijani folklore and world literature played a significant role in Afandiyev's future career. He wrote his first novel when he was 16 years old, which was published in ''Azərbaycan gəncləri'' (''Azerbaijani Youth'') magazine in 1959. He completed his secondary education in 1960 and studied at [[Baku State University]], graduating in 1965 with a degree in philology. In 1968, he completed his post-graduate studies at the [[Nizami Ganjavi|Nizami]] Institute of the [[Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences]], writing a 500-page dissertation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adyazar.az/qezet/index.php?newsid=865 |title=Elçin Əfəndiyev. 24 yaşında 500 səhifəlik namizədlik dissertasiyası yazdım |trans-title=Elchin Afandiyev.

There have been about five million copies sold worldwide.

==Political career==
During Soviet rule, Afandiyev was a deputy in the [[National Assembly of Azerbaijan|Supreme Soviet of the Azerbaijan SSR]]. Since 1993, he has served as Deputy Prime Minister of Azerbaijan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Eastern Europe, Russia and Central Asia |last1= |first1= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2002 |publisher= Europa Publications Limited |location= United Kingdom |isbn= 1-85743-137-5 |page=119 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EPP3ti4hysUC&amp;pg=PA119 |accessdate= 2010-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a Deputy Prime Minister, he supervises various sectors of government activity such as sports and cultural relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.azernews.az/en/Sports/24979-Baku_hosts_CoE_sports_ministers_meeting |title=Baku hosts CoE sports ministers meeting |publisher=Azernews |date=2010-09-23 |accessdate=2010-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706131414/http://www.azernews.az/en/Sports/24979-Baku_hosts_CoE_sports_ministers_meeting |archivedate=2011-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://eng.tatar-inform.ru/news/2008/10/06/19923/ |title=Days of the Tatarstan culture take place in Baku |publisher= Tatar-inform |date=2008-10-06 |accessdate=2010-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also chaired the ''Vətən'' cultural organization, which focuses on cultural ties with other countries. He is also a member of several government committees and is a member of Education Committee under the [[President of Azerbaijan]].

A number of '''Ethiopian sign languages''' have been used in various Ethiopian schools for the deaf since 1971, and at the primary level since 1956. Ethiopian Sign Language, presumably a national standard, is used in primary, secondary, and—at [[Addis Ababa University]]—tertiary education, and on national television. The Ethiopian Deaf Community uses the language as a marker of identity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4973">The '''European Design Awards''', also known as the ED-Awards, are annual awards presented to European designers for outstanding work in the communication design field. The ED-Awards is a joint initiative of design magazines from across Europe and endorsed by&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ico-d.org/connect/events/events/836.php ico-D endorsed events]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Icograda|International Council of Design]].
The ED-Awards are judged by a panel of representatives (journalists and design critics) from fifteen European design magazines, while the winning submissions are featured in the ED-Awards Catalogue.

==Model==
The ED-Awards is different than other design awards schemes in the way that the jury comprises not of peers (designers), but of design journalists and critics – people who see and judge work for a living.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eyemagazine.com/blog/post/european-design-still-exploring Eye Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;
Further more, since the ED-Awards organisation is made up of design magazines, it provides an opportunity for everyone submitting work, to have it featured in a number of these media. A lot of stories and articles are being created through the submitted work every year.&lt;ref&gt;Pool, #21 March 2012, {{ISSN|0976-1659}}, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jury==

The jury consists of fifteen representatives from high-profile European design magazines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europeandesign.org/ed-awards/jury/ Jury]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Categories==

There are 35 award categories, in seven groups,&lt;ref&gt;[http://designcollector.net/european-design-awards-2013-call-for-entries/ Categories] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230231653/http://designcollector.net/european-design-awards-2013-call-for-entries/ |date=December 30, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; covering branding, packaging, exhibition design, typography, digital design, illustration and self-promotion, among others. There are also three special distinctions: Agency of the year, Best of show and Jury prize.

'''Finno-Ugric''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|f|ɪ|n|oʊ|ˈ|juː|ɡ|r|ɪ|k}} or {{IPAc-en|ˌ|f|ɪ|n|oʊ|ˈ|uː|ɡ|r|ɪ|k}}),&lt;ref&gt;Collins English Dictionary - Complete &amp; Unabridged 11th Edition. Retrieved September 04, 2012 from website: http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/Finno-Ugric&lt;/ref&gt; '''Finno-Ugrian''' or '''Fenno-Ugric''' is a traditional grouping of all languages in the [[Uralic languages|Uralic language family]] except the [[Samoyedic languages]]. Its commonly accepted status as a subfamily of Uralic is based on criteria formulated in the 19th century and is &lt;!-- "often" needs more than one single quote--&gt; criticized by some contemporary linguists.&lt;ref&gt;Tapani Salminen, "The rise of the Finno-Ugric language family." In Carpelan, Parpola, &amp; Koskikallio (eds.), ''Early contacts between Uralic and Indo-European: linguistic and archaeological considerations.'' Mémoires de la Société Finno-Ougrienne 242; Helsinki 2001. 385–396.[http://www.helsinki.fi/~tasalmin/tvarminne.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The three most-spoken Uralic languages, [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], and [[Estonian language|Estonian]], are all included in Finno-Ugric, although linguistic roots common to both branches of the traditional Finno-Ugric language tree ([[Finno-Permic languages|Finno-Permic]] and [[Ugric languages|Ugric]]) are distant.

The term ''Finno-Ugric'', which originally referred to the entire family, is sometimes used as a synonym for the term ''Uralic'', which includes the [[Samoyedic languages]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Tommola| first = Hannu| title = Mood in the Languages of Europe| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=o3L8oKcbZtoC&amp;pg=PA511| year = 2010| publisher = John Benjamins Publishing Company| isbn = 978-90-272-0587-2| page = 155| chapter = Finnish among the Finno-Ugrian languages }}&lt;/ref&gt; as commonly happens when a language family is expanded with further discoveries.

==Status==
The validity of Finno-Ugric as a genetic grouping is under challenge,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helsinki.fi/~tasalmin/kuzn.html Salminen, Tapani (2002): ''Problems in the taxonomy of the Uralic languages in the light of modern comparative studies'']; the clade has also been abandoned by ''[[Ethnologue]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; with some feeling that the [[Finno-Permic languages]] are as distinct from the [[Ugric languages]] as they are from the [[Samoyedic languages]] spoken in Siberia, or even that none of the Finno-Ugric, Finno-Permic, or Ugric branches has been established. Received opinion has been that the easternmost (and last-discovered) Samoyed had separated first and the branching into Ugric and Finno-Permic took place later, but this reconstruction does not have strong support in the linguistic data.

==Origins==
{{See also|Pre-Finno-Ugric substrate}}

Attempts at [[historical linguistics|reconstructing]] a Proto-Finno-Ugric [[protolanguage]], a common ancestor of all [[Uralic languages]] except for the [[Samoyedic languages]], are largely indistinguishable from [[Proto-Uralic]], suggesting that Finno-Ugric might not be a historical grouping but a geographical one, with Samoyedic being distinct by lexical borrowing rather than actually being historically divergent. It has been proposed that the area in which Proto-Finno-Ugric was spoken reached between the [[Baltic Sea]] and the [[Ural Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Campbell| first = Lyle| title = Historical linguistics: an introduction| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=EjXrrOJhex8C&amp;pg=PA405| year = 2004| publisher = MIT Press| isbn = 978-0-262-53267-9| page = 405 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the main set of evidence for the genetic proposal of Proto-Finno-Ugric has come from vocabulary. A large amount of vocabulary (e.g. the numerals "one", "three", "four" and "six"; the body-part terms "hand", "head") is only reconstructed up to the Proto-Finno-Ugric level, and only words with a Samoyedic equivalent have been reconstructed for Proto-Uralic. That methodology has been criticised, as no coherent explanation other than inheritance has been presented for the origin of most of the Finno-Ugric vocabulary (though a small number has been explained as old loanwords from [[Proto-Indo-European]] or its immediate successors). 

The Samoyedic group has undergone a longer period of independent development, and its divergent vocabulary could be caused by mechanisms of replacement such as [[language contact]]. (The Finno-Ugric group is usually dated to approximately 4000 years ago, the Samoyedic a little over 2000.) Proponents of the traditional binary division note, however, that the invocation of extensive contact influence on vocabulary is at odds with the grammatical conservatism of Samoyedic.

The consonant ''*š'' ([[voiceless postalveolar fricative]], {{IPA|[ʃ]}}) has not been conclusively shown to occur in the traditional Proto-Uralic lexicon, but it is attested in some of the Proto-Finno-Ugric material. Another feature attested in the Finno-Ugric vocabulary is that ''*i'' now behaves as a neutral vowel with respect to front-back vowel harmony, and thus there are roots such as ''*niwa-'' "to remove the hair from hides".&lt;ref name="PS"&gt;{{cite book| last = Sammallahti| first = Pekka| title = The Uralic languages – Description, history and foreign influences| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=TM2NQ78dP2wC&amp;pg=PA492| year = 1988| publisher = BRILL| isbn = 978-90-04-07741-6| pages = 478–554| chapter = Historical Phonology of the Uralic languages| editor = Denis, Sinor }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regular [[sound change]]s proposed for this stage are few and remain open to interpretation. Sammallahti (1988)&lt;ref name="PS"/&gt; proposes five, following Janhunen's (1981) reconstruction of Proto-[[Finno-Permic languages|Finno-Permic]]:
* [[Compensatory lengthening]]: development of long vowels from the cluster of vowel plus a particular syllable-final element, of unknown quality, symbolized by ''*x''
** Long [[open vowel|open]] ''*aa'' and ''*ää'' are then raised to [[Mid vowel|mid]] ''*oo'' and ''*ee'' respectively.
*** E.g. ''*ńäxli-'' → ''*ńääli-'' → ''*ńeeli-'' "to swallow" (→ Finnish ''niele-'', Hungarian ''nyel'' etc.)
* Raising of short ''*o'' to ''*u'' in open syllables before a subsequent ''*i''
* Shortening of long vowels in closed syllables and before a subsequent open vowel ''*a'', ''*ä'', predating the raising of ''*ää'' and ''*ee''
** E.g. ''*ńäxl+mä'' → ''*ńäälmä'' → ''*ńälmä'' "tongue" (→ [[Northern Sami language|Northern Sami]] ''njalbmi'', Hungarian ''nyelv'', etc.)
Sammallahti (1988) further reconstructs sound changes ''*oo'', ''*ee'' → ''*a'', ''*ä'' (merging with original ''*a'', ''*ä'') for the development from Proto-Finno-Ugric to Proto-Ugric. Similar sound laws are required for other languages as well. Thus, the origin and raising of long vowels may actually belong at a later stage,&lt;ref name="JH"&gt;Häkkinen, Jaakko 2009: Kantauralin ajoitus ja paikannus: perustelut puntarissa. – Suomalais-Ugrilaisen Seuran Aikakauskirja 92. http://www.sgr.fi/susa/92/hakkinen.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and the development of these words from Proto-Uralic to Proto-Ugric can be summarized as simple loss of ''*x'' (if it existed in the first place at all; vowel length only surfaces consistently in the [[Baltic-Finnic languages]].&lt;ref name="AA12"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;) The proposed raising of ''*o'' has been alternately interpreted instead as a lowering ''*u'' → ''*o'' in Samoyedic (PU *''lumi'' → ''*lomə'' → [[Proto-Samoyedic]] ''*jom'').&lt;ref name=JH/&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; notes a number of [[Derivational morphology|derivational]] innovations in Finno-Ugric, including ''*ńoma'' "hare" → ''*ńoma-la'', (vs. Samoyedic ''*ńomå''), ''*pexli'' "side" → ''*peel-ka'' → ''*pelka'' "thumb", though involving Proto-Uralic derivational elements.

==Structural features==
{{Main|Uralic languages#Typology|l1=Uralic languages § Typology}}
The Finno-Ugric group is not typologically distinct from Uralic as a whole: the most widespread structural features among the group all extend to the Samoyedic languages as well.

==Classification disputes==
{{main|Uralic languages#Classification}}
Modern linguistic research has shown that Volgaic languages is a geographical classification rather than a linguistic one, because the [[Mordvinic languages]] are more closely related to the [[Finno-Lappic languages]] than the [[Mari languages]].

The relation of the Finno-Permic and the Ugric groups is adjudged remote by some scholars. On the other hand, with a projected time depth of only 3,000 to 4,000 years, the traditionally accepted Finno-Ugric grouping would be far younger than many major families such as [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] or [[Semitic languages|Semitic]], and would be about the same age as, for instance, the [[Eastern Nilotic languages|Eastern]] subfamily of [[Nilotic languages|Nilotic]]. But the grouping is far from transparent or securely established. The absence of early records is a major obstacle. As for the Finno-Ugric [[Urheimat]], most of what has been said about it is speculation.

Some linguists criticizing the Finno-Ugric genetic proposal&lt;ref&gt;especially [[Angela Marcantonio]]&lt;/ref&gt; also question the validity of the entire Uralic family, instead proposing a [[Ural–Altaic languages|Ural–Altaic hypothesis]], within which they believe Finno-Permic may be as distant from Ugric as from Turkic. However, this approach has been rejected by nearly all other specialists in Uralic linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;For refutations, see e.g. Aikio 2003; Bakró-Nagy 2003, 2005; De Smit 2003; Georg 2003; Kallio 2004; Laakso 2004; Saarikivi 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common vocabulary==
{{main|Wiktionary:en:Appendix:Swadesh lists for Finno-Ugric languages|Swadesh lists for Finno-Ugric languages}}

===Loanwords===
One argument in favor of the Finno-Ugric grouping has come from [[loanword]]s. Several loans from the [[Indo-European languages]] are present in most or all of the Finno-Ugric languages, while being absent from Samoyedic; many others also must be for phonological reasons dated as quite old.

According to Häkkinen (1983) the alleged Proto-Finno-Ugric loanwords are disproportionally well-represented in Hungarian and the Permic languages, and disproportionally poorly represented in the Ob-Ugric languages; hence it is possible that such words have been acquired by the languages only after the initial dissolution of the Uralic family into individual dialects, and that the scarcity of loanwords in Samoyedic results from its peripheric location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|first=Kaisa|last=Häkkinen|year=1983|title=Suomen kielen vanhimmasta sanastosta ja sen tutkimisesta|language=Finnish|type=PhD|publisher=Turun yliopisto|ISBN=951-642-445-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Numbers===
The [[number system]]s among the Finno-Ugric languages are particularly distinct from the Samoyedic languages: only the numerals "2" and "5" have cognates in Samoyedic, while also the numerals, "1", "3", "4", "6", "10" are shared by all or most Finno-Ugric languages.

Below are the numbers 1 to 10 in several Finno-Ugric languages. Forms in ''italic'' do not descend from the reconstructed forms.

The number '2' descends in Ugric from a front-vocalic variant *kektä.

The numbers '9' and '8' in Finnic through Mari are considered to be derived from the numbers '1' and '2' as '10–1' and '10–2'. One reconstruction is *''yk+teksa'' and *''kak+teksa'' respectively, where *''teksa'' cf. ''deka'' is an Indo-European loan; notice that the difference between /t/ and /d/ is not phonemic, unlike in Indo-European. Another analysis is *''ykt-e-ksa'', *''kakt-e-ksa'', with *''e'' being the negative verb.

==People==
{{Main|Finno-Ugric peoples}}
The four largest groups that speak Finno-Ugric languages are [[Hungary|Hungarians]] (14.5 million), [[Finland|Finns]] (6.5 million), [[Estonia]]ns (1.1 million), and [[Mordvins]] (0.85 million). Three (Hungarians, Finns, and Estonians) inhabit independent nation-states, [[Hungary]], [[Finland]], and [[Estonia]], while the Mordvins have an autonomous [[Mordovia|Mordovian Republic]] within Russia. The traditional area of the indigenous [[Sami people]] is in Northern Fenno-Scandinavia and the [[Kola Peninsula]] in Northwest Russia and is known as [[Sápmi (area)|Sápmi]]. Some other Finno-Ugric peoples have autonomous republics in [[Russia]]: [[Karelians]] ([[Republic of Karelia]]), [[Komi peoples|Komi]] ([[Komi Republic]]), [[Udmurts]] ([[Udmurtia|Udmurt Republic]]), [[Mari people|Mari]] ([[Mari El|Mari El Republic]]), and [[Mordvins]] ([[Moksha people|Moksha]] and [[Erzya people|Erzya]]; [[Mordovia|Republic of Mordovia]]). [[Khanty people|Khanty]] and [[Mansi people|Mansi]] peoples live in the [[Khanty–Mansi Autonomous Okrug]] of Russia, while Komi-[[Permyaks]] live in [[Komi-Permyak Okrug]], which used to be an [[autonomous okrug]] of Russia, but today is a territory with special status within [[Perm Krai]].

===Population genetics===
The linguistic reconstruction of the Finno-Ugric language family has led to the postulation that the ancient Proto–Finno-Ugric people were ethnically related, and that even the modern Finno-Ugric-speaking peoples are ethnically related.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Sámuel Gyarmathi| title = Grammatical Proof of the Affinity of the Hungarian Language with Languages of Fennic Origin: (Gottingen Dieterich, 1799)| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=7rmgP02a_mkC| year = 1983| publisher = John Benjamins Publishing| isbn = 978-90-272-0976-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such hypotheses are based on the assumption that heredity can be traced through linguistic relatedness,&lt;ref&gt;[http://finland.fi/public/default.aspx?contentid=160056 Where do Finnish come from?]&lt;/ref&gt; although it must be kept in mind that [[language shift]] and ethnic admixture, a relatively frequent and common occurrence both in recorded history and most likely also in prehistory, confuses the picture and there is no straightforward relationship, if at all, between linguistic and genetic affiliation. Still, the premise that the limited community of speakers of a proto-language must have been ethnically homogeneous remains accepted.&lt;ref name=Janhunen2009/&gt;

Modern genetic studies have shown that the Y-chromosome [[haplogroup N (Y-DNA)|haplogroup N3]], and sometimes N2, is almost specific though certainly not restricted to Uralic or Finno-Ugric speaking populations, especially as high frequency or primary paternal haplogroup.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/ejhg/journal/v15/n2/abs/5201748a.html European Journal of Human Genetics – Abstract of article: A counter-clockwise northern route of the Y-chromosome haplogroup N from Southeast Asia towards Europe]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/AJHG/journal/issues/v74n4/40783/40783.web.pdf?erFrom=-1818203271335085617Guest Journals Home]&lt;/ref&gt; These haplogroups branched from [[haplogroup N (Y-DNA)|haplogroup N]], which probably spread north, then west and east from Northern China about 12,000–14,000 years before present from father [[haplogroup NO (Y-DNA)|haplogroup NO]] (haplogroup O being the most common Y-chromosome haplogroup in Southeast Asia).

'''Fringe time''' can be used to describe two [[dayparting|dayparts]] in American [[broadcast programming|television programming]]: the hour [[lead-in|leading into]] [[prime time]] ("early fringe"), and the program slot following [[late-night news|late local news]] ("late fringe" and "post-late fringe"). For the sake of clarity, this article focuses primarily on the early fringe; see the article on [[late night television]] for an in-depth discussion of the late fringe slots.

During the first two decades of American television, the early fringe was considered a part of prime time, which began programming a half-hour earlier than it did in the present day. In 1971, in an effort to loosen the hegemony the [[Big Three television networks]] had on [[television in the United States]], the [[Federal Communications Commission]] implemented two rules, the [[Financial Interest and Syndication Rules]] (fin-syn), which prohibited the networks from owning interests in syndicators; and the [[Prime Time Access Rule]], which prohibited networks from programming a one-hour slot in the evening hour, the slot now known as fringe time.

The intent of the new rules was to encourage individual station licensees to produce more local programming. In practice, this failed, and the slot was (and largely remains) dominated by [[broadcast syndication|syndicated programming]]. [[Game show]]s already airing in daytime on the Big Three networks quickly filled many of the new slots, ostensibly funneled through syndicators but produced on the same sets with most of the same personnel (except sometimes a different host) as their network counterparts, defeating much of the purpose of the new rule. One such program, ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'', has survived in syndication since that era, outlasting the show's network run. Sister program ''[[Jeopardy!]]'', after a failed attempt at syndication in 1974 near the end of its network run, returned as an independent show a decade later, with both it and ''Wheel'' being fringe time fixtures ever since.

Although during the early days of these new rules, local stations typically carried a hodge-podge of weekly shows, by the 1980s almost all fringe time programming was [[stripping (television)|stripped]] at least five and sometimes six days a week, a pattern that remains to the present day.

Other formats frequently used to fill fringe time include [[newsmagazine]]s (mostly syndicated entertainment-based programs) and off-network [[rerun]]s, usually [[sitcom]]s. Local news, occasionally seen in the time slot in the early years of television, has seen a renaissance in the time slot in the 21st century. Occasionally other formats more commonly seen in [[daytime television|daytime]] such as [[talk show]]s or [[court show]]s are used to program the slot, but because it leads into the network prime time lineups, these shows are expected to be highly rated and retain a large audience, and thus only the highest-rated shows in these genera (such as ''[[Judge Judy]]'') are ever used in this manner.

Both fin-syn and the Prime Time Access Rule have since been repealed; the networks, although they have reacquired most of the syndicators they were forced to spin off, have never resumed directly programming the fringe time slots they were forced to abandon.

[[Independent station (North America)|Independent stations]] and non-Big Three network affiliates, because they lack access to network late-night shows, have had to program both the early fringe and the late fringe with similar approaches.

The '''frog pond effect''' is the [[theory]] that individuals evaluate themselves as worse when in a group of higher performing individuals.

The frog pond effect is a part of the wider [[social comparison theory]].  It relates to how [[Self-evaluation motives|individuals evaluate themselves]] based on comparisons to other people around them, and is generally due to upward comparisons. Davis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davis|first1=James|title=The Campus as a Frog Pond: An Application of the Theory of Relative Deprivation to Career Decisions of College Men|year=1966|url=http://www.utexas.edu/law/journals/tlr/sources/Volume%2092/Issue%206/Sander/Final%20Sourcelist%20Sourcepull/Sander.fn035.frogpond.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; first noticed this effect when he discovered that students evaluated their performance as worse based on their peers from their school. MacFarland and Buehler&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=1995|last1=MacFarland|first1=Cathy|last2=Beuhler|first2=Roger|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/68/6/1055.html|title=Collective Self-Esteem as a Moderator of the Frog-Pond Effect in Reactions to Performance Feedback}}&lt;/ref&gt; theorized that the effect happens because individuals self-monitor within-group rather than compare across groups.  Individuals are affected by the frog pond effect the most when they come from an [[individualistic culture]], lack strong social connections, and have low collective [[self-esteem]].&lt;ref&gt;MacFarland and Beuhler, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''''Gemarkung''''' (also '''''Markung''''', in Switzerland also '''''Gemarchen''''', in Austria '''''[[Katastralgemeinde]]''''') is a parcel of land recorded in the [[cadastre]] in the countries of [[Germany]], [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]]. Gemarkung registers record the parcels' location, usage and geomorphology and the like qualities, however, the rights to the land (as property, or collateral liened by a mortgage) are kept in the Grundbuch ([[land register]]). A Gemarkung is made up of a number of, usually contiguous, plots of urban (''Grundstücke'') or rural land (''Flurstücke''). Between the levels of ''Flurstück'' and ''Gemarkung'' is often found the level of ''[[Flur]]'', usually a tract of open land or forest.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4281">'''Historic Colognian''' or '''Old Colognian''' is the spoken and written language of the city of [[Cologne]] in [[Germany]] from the 12th century to the 18th century, before the development of Modern Colognian. The German name for it is ''Altkölnisch''. This classification is primarily based on the research and publications, including a dictionary,&lt;ref&gt;Prof. Dr. Adam Wrede: ''Altkölnischer Sprachschatz'' [Old Colognian Vocabulary]. A first partial edition was published in 1928 in Bonn. The economic crisis, and World War II stopped the publication, which was not resumed. A planned continuation was interrupted by the unexpected death of Dr. Wrede, and is now halted after the collapse of the building of the [[Historical Archive of the City of Cologne|City Archives of Cologne]], which was where the manuscripts were kept.&lt;/ref&gt; of Prof. Dr. Adam Wrede (1875-1960), a linguist at the [[University of Cologne]]. He also published a dictionary of Modern Colognian,&lt;ref&gt;Prof. Dr. Adam Wrede: ''Neuer Kölnischer Sprachschatz'' [New Colognian Vocabulary], Three Volumes, 12th Ed. (Cologne: Greven-Verlag, 1999) {{ISBN|3-7743-0243-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is still having reprints today. It was Wrede who coined the term ''Altkölnisch''.

==History==
Since the middle of the 5th Century, Cologne was under the rule of the [[Franks]], who took over after almost 500 years of [[Roman Empire|Roman]] rule. The Franks brought their own language, which gradually replaced [[Latin]] as the common language of the residents. The Old Colognian language developed later than the 12th Century,&lt;ref&gt;Wrede: ''Neuer Kölnischer Sprachschatz'', Volume 2, page 74, top.&lt;/ref&gt; evolving from a mixture of the then old fashioned [[Ripuarian language|Ripuarian]] and [[Low Franconian]] dialects and [[Old High German]]. Old Franconian developed into a huge variety of dialects, including most of [[Middle High German]] and later [[Luxembourgish]], while [[Old Dutch|Old Low Franconian]] developed into [[Middle Low German]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Afrikaans]] and others. [[Old High German]] developed into [[New High German]] and [[Modern German]]. So Old Colognian was already influenced by High German in the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name="Wrede"&gt;Wrede: ''Neuer Kölnischer Sprachschatz''. Volume 3, page 332, top.&lt;/ref&gt;

Old Colognian was not a mere dialect. It was the language of the [[Electorate of Cologne]], spoken and written every day by both the ecclesiastical and secular authorities as well as the residents of the city and its surrounding area. So it was very well preserved through the Middle Ages and into the Modern times, with a rich variety arising from everyday use.&lt;ref name="Wrede" /&gt; Contemporary literature was written and later printed in Old Colognian. Beginning in the first half of the 16th century, even mundane literary sources exist.&lt;ref&gt;One of them, written in the 16th Century, is the so called “Weinsberg Book” (''Buch Weinsberg''), a kind of diary of a son of a Colognian patrician, [[:de:Hermann von Weinsberg|Hermann von Weinsberg]], who wrote about his own life from youth to adulthood. Most remarkably, with his writings, he placed himself with the kings and queens of his time, usually the only ones whose lives are documented by existing records, letters and reports.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 16th century, the influence of the [[New High German]] language increased in Cologne and along the [[Rhine River]], changing the way of writing used by the monasteries, authorities, and printers. But it did not affect the spoken language of the ordinary citizens. This is evident from the written accounts of the 18th Century, when Colognian was revived for the literature, and they show the development of Old Colognian into Modern Colognian, at least in its spoken form.

Towards the end of the 16th century, the Low Franconian writing system was gradually abandoned by printers and offices in favor of the developing New High German writing system. Since then, spoken and written languages diverged in Cologne, and documents written in Old Colognian have grown scarce.

'''8 September''' was declared international literacy day by [[UNESCO]] on 26 October 1966 at 14th session of UNESCO's General conference. It was celebrated for the first time in 1967. Its aim is to highlight the importance of [[literacy]] to individuals, communities and societies. Celebrations take place in several countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://en.unesco.org/commemorations/literacyday |title=International Literacy Day |accessdate=24 October 2018 |publisher=UNSECO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rationale ==
Some 775 million adults lack minimum literacy skills; one in five adults are still not literate and two-thirds of them are women;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uis.unesco.org/en/topic/literacy |title=Literacy  |accessdate=24 October 2018 |publisher=UNSECO Institute for Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt; 60.7 million children are out-of-school and many more attend irregularly or drop out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uis.unesco.org/sites/default/files/documents/fs46-more-than-half-children-not-learning-en-2017.pdf |title=More Than One-Half of Children and Adolescents Are Not Learning Worldwide |publisher=UNSECO Institute for Statistics |accessdate=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to UNESCO’s "Global Monitoring Report on Education for All (2006)",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/education/themes/leading-the-international-agenda/efareport/reports/2006-literacy/ |title=Global Education Monitoring Report |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=4 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150228023240/http://www.unesco.org/new/en/education/themes/leading-the-international-agenda/efareport/reports/2006-literacy/ |archive-date=28 February 2015 |dead-url=no |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[South Asia]] has the lowest regional adult [[literacy rate]] (58.6%), followed by [[sub-Saharan Africa]] (59.7%). Countries with the lowest literacy rates in the world are [[Burkina Faso]] (12.8%), [[Niger]] (14.4%) and [[Mali]] (19%). The report shows a clear connection between illiteracy and countries in severe [[poverty]], and between illiteracy and [[gender roles|prejudice against women]].

== Celebrations ==
Celebrations of International Literacy Day have included specific themes, in line with [[Education For All]] goals and other United Nations programs such as the [[United Nations Literacy Decade]]. The celebration's theme for 2007 and 2008 was “Literacy and Health”, with prizes awarded to organizations at the forefront of health education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/education/themes/education-building-blocks/literacy/literacy-prizes/unesco-king-sejong-prize/winners-2008/ |title=Winners 2008 &amp;#124; United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=4 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405170537/http://www.unesco.org/new/en/education/themes/education-building-blocks/literacy/literacy-prizes/unesco-king-sejong-prize/winners-2008/ |archive-date=5 April 2017 |dead-url=no |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was also the thematic emphasis of the 2007–2008 biennium of the United Nations Literacy Decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/education/themes/education-building-blocks/literacy/un-literacy-decade/ |title=UN Literacy Decade &amp;#124; United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization |publisher=UNESCO |date=31 December 2012 |accessdate=4 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405170426/http://www.unesco.org/new/en/education/themes/education-building-blocks/literacy/un-literacy-decade/ |archive-date=5 April 2017 |dead-url=no |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, International Literacy Day 2008 had a strong emphasis on Literacy and Epidemics with a focus on communicable diseases such as HIV, Tuberculosis and Malaria, some of the world's forefront public health concerns. For 2009–2010 the emphasis was placed on “Literacy and Empowerment”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/education/themes/education-building-blocks/literacy/literacy-prizes/2011/ |title=2011 &amp;#124; United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization |publisher=UNESCO |date=8 September 2011 |accessdate=4 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170314001702/http://www.unesco.org/new/en/education/themes/education-building-blocks/literacy/literacy-prizes/2011 |archive-date=14 March 2017 |dead-url=no |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with special consideration to Gender Equality and the empowerment of women. The theme of the 2011–2012 celebrations is “Literacy and Peace”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0021/002163/216302E.pdf |format=PDF |title=UNESCO International Literacy Prizes |website=Unesdoc.usesco.org |accessdate=4 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170328211848/http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0021/002163/216302E.pdf |archive-date=28 March 2017 |dead-url=no |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In medicine, an '''intertriginous''' area is where two skin areas may touch or rub together.  Examples of intertriginous areas are the [[axilla]] of the arm, the [[Perineum|anogenital region]], [[Breast shape|skin folds of the breasts]], and between digits.  Intertriginous areas are known to harbor large amounts of [[Aerobic organism|aerobic]] [[Coccus|cocci]] and aerobic [[Corynebacterium|coryneform]] bacteria which are both parts of normal [[skin flora]].

'''Iván Guzmán de Rojas''' (b. 1934 [[La Paz]]) is a [[Demographics of Bolivia|Bolivian]] research [[scientist]] and the creator of the multi-lingual translation system [[Atamiri]].&lt;ref name=Educabolivia&gt;{{cite web|title="Copuchando" con Ivan Guzman de Guzmán, el creador del primer sistema de traduccion automatica multilingüe|url=http://www.educabolivia.bo/educabolivia_v3/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2487:88620f31-eeb6-4bde-8b23-87ddab85c922&amp;catid=4:uso-pedagogico-y-tics&amp;Itemid=39|work=Educabolivia|publisher=Minesterio Educacion de Bolivia|accessdate=29 May 2012|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and academia==
Guzmán was born in [[La Paz]], Bolivia in 1934 to a [[Painting|painter]] from [[Potosí]], [[Cecilio Guzmán de Rojas]].  He studied at an American institute in the city and graduated in 1952.  While in high school, he became interested in science, primarily [[mathematics]] and [[physics]].&lt;ref name=Educabolivia /&gt;

He studied [[engineering]] at the [[Higher University of San Andrés]] and won a research scholarship to [[Germany]].  He remained in Europe for about ten years to deepen his knowledge of [[theoretical physics]], a branch of physics which applies [[mathematical models]].  Following his return to Bolivia in 1967, he promoted the establishment of a major of Basic Sciences at the Higher University of San Andrés.  He is the founder of the majors of Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry at the school and created the first research laboratory of applied chemistry.&lt;ref name=Educabolivia /&gt;

At the beginning of the 1970s, Guzmán left his academic career due to the University Revolution of 1970 and [[Hugo Banzer|Hugo Banzer's]] military [[Coup d'état|coup]].&lt;ref name=Educabolivia /&gt;

==Linguistic research==
In 1979, Guzmán began to study the [[algorithm]]ic properties of the [[syntax]] of the [[Aymara language]].  This research led to the development of the Atamiri System, software, based on the language, that allows multilingual translation of languages simultaneously.

In 1985, under the oversight of the [[Secretary General of the Organization of American States]], [[João Clemente Baena Soares]], Guzmán presented the first prototype of the Atamiri System in [[Washington, DC]].&lt;ref name=Atamiri&gt;{{cite web|title=Atamiri's History|url=http://www.atamiri.cc/en/AtamiriSolution/History/index.html|publisher=atamiri|accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By this time, it was able to simultaneously translate from English into French, Spanish, and German and from Spanish into French, English, and German.&lt;ref name=Atamiri /&gt;

Guzmán gave presentations and seminars in various countries around the world about his investigation of the engineering of language and the application of the Aymara language on Atamiri.  He also wrote various publications in respect to the language.

Guzmán led a research group called ''IGRAL'', which investigated language engineering.  The group began more work on the Atamiri system in 2001 and created ''Qopuchawi'', a multilingual messaging service with translations into 30 different languages.&lt;ref name=Atamiri /&gt; 

In 2007, he wrote the book ''Lógica aymara y futurología'',&lt;ref name="Open library"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lógica aymara y futurología|url=http://openlibrary.org/books/OL23715555M/L%C3%B3gica_aymara_y_futurolog%C3%ADa|work=[[Open library]]|publisher=Internet Archive|accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he referred to an algebraic tool applied to the computation which permits the imagination of a future scenario developed using his study of Aymara.&lt;ref name=Univision&gt;{{cite web|title=La lógica aymara facilita el avance de la futurología|url=http://foro.univision.com/t5/Bolivia/La-l%C3%B3gica-aymara-facilita-el-avance-de-la-futurolog%C3%ADa/td-p/208813567#axzz1s5dFOmbR|work=Foros|publisher=Univision Communications inc.|accessdate=29 May 2012|language=Spanish|date=28 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other positions==
Between 1989 and 1999 he served as the vice-president of the [[National Electoral Court of Bolivia]].&lt;ref name="Electoral court"&gt;Eighth Conference Of The Association Of Electoral Bodies Of South America, ''Declaration of Asuncion, Paraguay'', 24–25 August 1999 (By and on the Behalf of the National Electoral Courts of Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay and the Executive Secretariat (IIHR/CAPEL)).&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[psychology]], '''''jamais vu''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʒ|æ|m|eɪ|_|ˈ|v|uː}}; {{IPA-fr|ʒa.mɛ.vy}}), a [[French language|French]] borrowing meaning "never seen", refers to the [[phenomenon]] of experiencing a situation that one recognizes in some fashion, but nonetheless seems very unfamiliar.

==Overview==
Often described as the opposite of ''[[déjà vu]]'', ''jamais vu'' involves a sense of eeriness and the observer's impression of seeing the situation for the first time, despite rationally knowing that he or she has been in the situation before. ''Jamais vu'' is sometimes associated with certain types of [[aphasia]], [[amnesia]], and [[epilepsy]].

''Jamais vu'' is most commonly experienced when a person momentarily does not recognise a word or, less commonly, a person or place, that he or she knows.&lt;ref name="study" /&gt; This can be achieved by anyone by repeatedly writing [[Semantic satiation|or saying a specific word out loud]]. After a few seconds one will often, despite knowing that it is a real word, feel as if "there's no way it is an actual word".

The phenomenon is often grouped with ''[[déjà vu]]'' and [[tip of the tongue|''presque vu'', or ''tip of the tongue'']].

Theoretically, as seen below, a ''jamais vu'' feeling in a sufferer of a [[delirium|delirious]] disorder or intoxication could result in a delirious explanation of it, such as in [[Capgras delusion]], in which the patient takes a person known by him or her for a false [[Look-alike|double]] or impostor. If the impostor is the sufferer himself, the clinical setting would be the same as the one described as [[depersonalisation]]; hence, ''jamais vus'' of oneself, or of the very "reality of reality", are termed [[depersonalization]] and [[derealization]], respectively.

===Experiment===
A study by [[Chris Moulin]] of Leeds University asked 92 volunteers to write out "door" 30 times in 60 seconds. In July 2006 at the 4th International Conference on Memory in Sydney he reported that 68 percent of volunteers showed symptoms of ''jamais vu'', such as beginning to doubt that "door" was a real word. Dr Moulin believes that a similar brain fatigue underlies a phenomenon observed in some schizophrenia patients: that a familiar person has been replaced by an impostor. Dr Moulin suggests they could be suffering from chronic ''jamais vu''.&lt;ref name ="study" /&gt;

==Causes==
''Jamais vu'' can be caused by [[epileptic seizure]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epilepsy.com/Epilepsy/seizure_simplepartial "Epilepsy and seizure information for patients and health professionals — Simple Partial Seizures", retrieved 2011-09-08]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related phenomena ==
*''[[Déjà vu]]'': having the strong sensation that an event or experience currently being experienced, has already been experienced in the past, whether it has actually happened or not. In French, this literally means 'already seen', though in usage it is basically equivalent to ''déjà vécu'', "already lived".
* ''[[Tip of the tongue|Presque vu]]'': almost, but not quite, remembering something. It is also referred to as ''tip of the tongue''.

Steckley is reportedly the last known speaker of the [[Wyandot language|Wyandot (or Huron) language]], which he has studied for over thirty years.&lt;ref name=star/&gt; He is also interested in place names as derived from indigenous languages, and aims to correct common misconceptions regarding their original derivations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usitt.org/sightlines/v44/n07/stories/Toronto.html How Toronto Got Its Names] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720102358/http://www.usitt.org/sightlines/v44/n07/stories/Toronto.html |date=20 July 2008 }}, Sightlines, August 2004 Volume XLIV, Number 7 ([[United States Institute for Theatre Technology]], August 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

Steckley has become a deeply respected figure amongst the Wyandot. On his adoption into the Wyandot tribe in 1999, he was named ''Tehaondechoren'' ("he who splits the country in two").&lt;ref name=reist&gt;Reist, Michael, ''[http://www.northpeelmediagroup.com/sideroads/caledon/articleV2.php?columnId=250&amp;readArticle=bf65291e31fb7a379d0109a0e03023f4&amp;ArtSection=features&amp;ArtType=article Member of the tribe: Meet Boltonite John Steckley, author and honorary member of the Huron Tribe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100515165031/http://www.northpeelmediagroup.com/sideroads/caledon/articleV2.php?columnId=250&amp;readArticle=bf65291e31fb7a379d0109a0e03023f4&amp;ArtSection=features&amp;ArtType=article |date=15 May 2010 }}'', ''The Caledon Enterprise &amp; Erin Advocate'', 28 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt; He was also given the name "Hechon" by descendants of the Huron in [[Loretteville, Quebec City]], while teaching them their own historical language.&lt;ref name=reist/&gt; This was a name that had previously been given to [[Jean de Brébeuf]] (1593–1649), one of the [[North American Martyrs]], by his Huron and Wyandot followers.&lt;ref name=reist/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Huron Indians}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jules Gros-Gi Prijant.jpg|thumb|Jules Gros.]]  
'''Jules Marcel Gros''' (2 February 1890 &amp;ndash; 25 December 1992) was a Breton linguist specializing in the [[Breton language]]. He was born in [[Paris]].

Gros' studies began very early in the twentieth century, from his grandmother and other people in his village who were still [[unilingual]] Breton speakers. Gros authored ''Stylistique Trégorroise'' and various dictionaries of Breton. His books were used by a generation of students, and continue to be important as reference works cataloguing the speech patterns of the Breton language.

Gros died on 25 December 1992 in [[Trédrez-Locquémeau]].

}}The most widely spoken language in [[Japan]] is [[Japanese language|Japanese]], which is separated into a large number of [[Japanese dialects|dialects]] with [[Tokyo dialect]] considered standard Japanese.

In addition to the Japanese language, [[Ryukyuan languages]] are spoken in [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]] and parts of [[Kagoshima Prefecture|Kagoshima]] in the [[Ryukyu Islands]]. Along with Japanese, these languages are part of the [[Japonic languages|Japonic language family]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shimoji|first1=Michinori|editor1-last=Shimoji|editor1-first=Michinori|editor2-last=Pellard|editor2-first=Thomas|title=An Introduction to Ryukyuan Languages|date=2010|publisher=Research Institute for Languages and Cultures of Asia and Africa|location=Tokyo|isbn=9784863370722|page=2|url=http://lingdy.aacore.jp/jp/material/An_introduction_to_Ryukyuan_languages.pdf|accessdate=24 September 2016|chapter=Ryukyuan Languages: An Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they are separate languages, and are not [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] with Japanese, or with each other. All of the spoken Ryukyuan languages are classified by [[UNESCO]] as endangered.

In [[Hokkaido]], there is the [[Ainu language]], which is spoken by the [[Ainu people]], who are the indigenous people of the island. The Ainu languages, of which Hokkaido Ainu is the only extant variety, are isolated and do not fall under any language family. Ever since the Meiji period, Japanese has become widely used among the Ainu people and consequently Ainu languages have been classified critically endangered by [[UNESCO]].

In addition, languages such as [[Orok language|Orok]], [[Evenki language|Evenki]], and [[Nivkh language|Nivkh]] spoken in formerly Japanese controlled southern [[Sakhalin]] are becoming more and more endangered. After the [[Soviet Union]] took control of the region, speakers of these languages and their descendants migrated to mainland Japan and still exist but in small numbers.

Speakers of [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], and [[Zainichi Korean language|Zainichi Korean]], which stems from Korean, also reside in Japan.

== History==
Evidence shows that people inhabited Japan and its islands from the beginning of the [[Paleolithic|Palaeolithic Age]]. It is believed that these people spoke a language; however it is unknown what kind of language they might have spoken. Characters resembling written language have been found at [[Stone Age]] excavation sites; however there are differing opinions as to what language it may be.

Not until shortly after the turn of the second century did indications of language spoken appear in Chinese history books. [[Kanji|Chinese characters]] were adopted and records of spoken language were made in Japan. [[Hiragana]] and [[katakana]] characters were incorporated as a relatively accurate way to represent the sounds of Chinese characters.

=== Ryukyuan languages ===
Chinese characters were first introduced to [[Ryukyuan languages]] shortly into the 13th century. Details concerning the language before then are not well known. Fourteenth-century records indicate that gifts from [[Ryukyu Islands]] to China used hiragana, which indicates that these languages were tied to mainland Japanese at the time.

=== Ainu languages ===
There exist places in and around [[Tōhoku region|Tōhoku]] whose names were derived from Ainu languages. It is well known that people in [[Hokkaido]], [[Sakhalin|Karafuto]], and the [[Kuril Islands]] used [[Ainu language]]s, but it is also thought that people in the eastern part of mainland Japan once spoke these languages. According to 16th-century records, Ainu languages didn’t have an alphabet. Only from the 19th century did Ainu languages begin to use katakana.

=== Orok language ===
The [[Orok language]] emerged before the common era. Records show that they were used during the latter part of the [[Edo period]] in Hokkaido, Karafuto, and the Kuril Islands; however, there are only a few speakers still in existence.

=== Nivkh language ===
Like Orok, the [[Nivkh language]] was spoken in Hokkaido, Karafuto, and the Kuril Islands, but also along the [[Amur River]]. It is unknown whether speakers of Nivkh still remain in Japan.

=== European languages ===
Since [[Late Middle Japanese|the Middle Ages]], owing to visits from Europeans, Japanese has adopted a number of foreign words.

== Language classifications ==
The [[oral language]]s spoken by the native peoples of the insular country of [[Japan]] at present and during [[recorded history]] belong to either of two primary [[language family|phyla of human language]]:

* [[Japonic languages]]
** [[Japanese language]] (See also [[Japanese dialects]])
*** [[Hachijō dialects|Hachijo Japanese]]
*** Eastern Japanese
*** Western Japanese
*** Kyushu Japanese
** [[Ryukyuan languages]]
*** [[Northern Ryukyuan languages]]
**** [[Amami language|Amami]]
**** [[Kunigami language|Kunigami]]
**** [[Okinawa language|Okinawa]]
*** [[Southern Ryukyuan languages]]
**** [[Miyako language|Mikayo]]
**** [[Yaeyama language|Yaeyama]]
**** [[Yonaguni language|Yonaguni]]
* [[Ainu languages]]
** [[Ainu language|Hokkaido Ainu language]]
** [[Sakhalin Ainu language]] (extinct)
** [[Kuril Ainu language]] (extinct)
In addition to these two indigenous language families, there is [[Japanese Sign Language]], as well as significant minorities of ethnic [[Koreans in Japan|Koreans]] and [[Chinese people in Japan|Chinese]], who make up respectively about 0.5% and 0.4% of the country's population and many of whom continue to speak their ethnic language in private (see [[Zainichi Korean language|Zainichi Korean]]). There is also a notable history of use of ''[[Kanbun]]'' ([[Classical Chinese]]) as a language of literature and diplomacy in Japan, similar to the status of the [[Latin|Latin language]] in medieval Europe, which has left an indelible mark on the vocabulary of the Japanese language. ''Kanbun'' is a mandatory subject in the curricula of most Japanese [[secondary school]]s.

{{IPA notice}}
This article is about the phonology of [[Levantine Arabic]] also known as ''Shāmi'' Arabic, and its sub-dialects.

==Varieties==
As in most Arabic-speaking areas, the spoken language differs significantly between urban, rural and nomad populations. 
* In the Levant, nomads trace to various tribes of the [[Arabian Peninsula]], and their dialect is consequently close to [[Peninsular Arabic]] (Najdi). Note that although claiming a Bedouin ancestry sounds prestigious in the Levant, the Bedouin influence on this old sedentary area should not be overestimated. These dialects are not covered in detail here, as they are not specific to the area.
* The rural language is the one that changes most, and as in every old sedentary area, the changes are gradual, with more marked forms in extremal or isolated areas (e.g. general shift of {{IPAslink|k}} to {{IPAblink|tʃ}} in rural Palestinian, or conservation of the diphthongs {{IPA|/aj/}} and {{IPA|/aw/}} in the Lebanese mountains).
* The urban language spoken in the major cities is remarkably homogeneous, with a few shibboleths (markers) only to distinguish the various cities (see below). Levantine Arabic is commonly understood to be this urban sub-variety. Teaching manuals for foreigners provide a systematic introduction to this sub-variety, as it would sound very strange for a foreigner to speak a marked rural dialect, immediately raising questions on unexpected family links, for instance.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Yohanan Elihai, The olive tree dictionary: a transliterated dictionary of conversational Eastern Arabic (Palestinian). Washington, DC: Kidron Pub. 2004 ({{ISBN|0-9759726-0-X}})&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Urban Levantine Arabic ===
As mentioned above, the urban varieties are remarkably homogeneous throughout the whole area, compared to the changes the language undergo in rural populations. This homogeneity is probably inherited from the trading network among cities in the [[Ottoman Empire]]. It may also represent an older state of affairs. As a matter of facts, there is a current trend to diverge from this unity, the language of the cities taking on some of the features of their neighboring villages (e.g. Jerusalem used to say as Damascus {{IPA|[ˈnɪħna]}} ('we') and {{IPA|[ˈhʊnne]}} ('they') at the beginning of the 20th century, and this has moved to the more rural {{IPA|[ˈɪħna]}} and {{IPA|[ˈhʊmme]}} nowadays.).&lt;ref&gt;U. Seeger, Mediterranean Language Review '''10''' (1998), pp. 89-145.&lt;/ref&gt; The table below shows the main historical variants which have [[shibboleth]] role, most of the rest of the language remaining the same.

=== Rural subdialects ===
Rural Levantine Arabic can be divided into two groups of [[Mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] subdialects.&lt;ref&gt;Handbuch der arabische Dialekte - Jastrow &amp; Fischer - Harrassowitz verlag&lt;/ref&gt; Again, these dialect considerations have to be understood to apply mainly to rural populations, as the urban forms change much less.

* [[Syrian Arabic|Northern Levantine Arabic]], spoken in Lebanon, Northern Israel and Syria (except the Hauran area south of Damascus). It is characterized by:
:* a widespread pronunciation of {{IPA|/q/}} as {{IPAblink|ʔ}} (the Druze, however, retain the uvular {{IPAblink|q}}).
:* A strong tendency to pronounce long {{IPA|/aː/}} as {{IPAblink|ɛ|ɛː}} (''imala'') in a front phonemic context or {{IPAblink|o|oː}} (''tafkhim'') in a back phonemic context. This tendency is stronger as one goes northward. For instance, Damascus and Beirut only have final {{IPA|/aː/}} consistently pronounced as {{IPAblink|e}}, e.g. {{IPA|/ʃitaː/}} ('rain') is pronounced {{IPA|[ʃəte]}} . This feature may be used to distinguish Central from Northern Levantine.
:* A widespread realization of {{IPA|/dʒ/}} as {{IPAblink|ʒ}}, especially along the Mediterranean coast. This feature may be used to distinguish northwest (coastal, Nusayriyyah) from northeast (e.g. Aleppo, Idlib) Levantine Arabic where {{IPA|/dʒ/}} is realized as {{IPAblink|dʒ}}.
:* The second and third person plural pronominal suffixes end in {{IPA|/-n/}} : {{IPA|/-kun/}}, {{IPA|/-hun/}} (or {{IPA|/-hen/}} in Galilee).
:* The characteristic vowel of the imperative is long: {{IPA|/ˈuktub/}} &gt; {{IPA|[ktoːb]}}.
:* The first and third person singular imperfect are {{IPA|/bquːl/}} ('I say') and {{IPA|/bəquːl/}} ('he says') in Lebanon and Damascus instead of {{IPA|/baquːl/}} and {{IPA|/biquːl/}}, respectively, everywhere else, which may be used to further distinguish Central from Northern and Southern Levantine Arabic.

* [[South Levantine Arabic]], spoken in [[Israel]] and the [[Palestinian territories]] between Nazareth and Bethlehem, in the Syrian Hauran mountains, and in western Jordan.
:* Tafkhim is nonexistent there, and imala affects only the feminine ending {{IPA|/-ah/}} &gt; {{IPA|[e]}} after front consonants (and not even in Gaza where it remains {{IPA|/a/}}), while {{IPA|/ʃitaː/}} is {{IPA|[ʃɪta]}}.
:* In central Palestinian (Jaffa, West Bank, Nazareth, Tiberias) rural speech, {{IPA|/k/}} changes to {{IPAblink|tʃ}}, {{IPA|/q/}} changes to {{IPAblink|k}}, interdentals are conserved, and {{IPA|/dʒ/}} is pronounced {{IPAblink|dʒ}}. In southern Palestinian (Ashdod, Asqelon, Hebron countryside) as well as western Jordan and Syrian Hauran, {{IPA|/q/}} changes to {{IPAblink|ɡ}} and {{IPA|/k/}} changes to {{IPAblink|tʃ}} before front vowels. This latter feature resembles the North Arabian Bedouin dialects.

In Israel, apart from Galilee and the Negev, rural dialects are almost extinct, and this description gives is the pre-1948 state of affairs. Palestinian refugees in Jordan have brought with them their typical features, although they tend to adopt the emerging Jordanian urban speech.

To these typical, widespread subdialects, one could add marginal varieties such as:
* Outer South Levantine, spoken in the Gaza–Beersheva area in Israel and the Palestinian territories, as well as in cities east of the Dead Sea in Jordan (Karak, Tafilah), which display different Bedouin influences as compared to south Levantine. For instance, there, {{IPA|/k/}} never changes to {{IPAblink|tʃ}}. This reflects Hijazi or Sinai Bedouin Arabic pronunciation rather than that of North Arabian Bedouin dialects.
* Bedouin dialects proper, which on top of the above-mentioned features that influence the sedentary dialects, present typical stress patterns (e.g. gahawa syndrome) or lexical items.

NB. Hamza has a special treatment: at the end of a closed syllable, it vanishes and lengthens the preceding vowel, e.g. {{IPA|/raʔs/}} &gt; {{IPA|[raːs]}} (see [[compensatory lengthening]]). If followed by {{IPA|/i/}}, it is realized as {{IPA|[j]}}, {{IPA|/naːʔim/}} &gt; {{IPA|[naːjem]}}. These evolutions plead for a Hijazi origin of Levantine Arabic. Word initially, hamza is often realized as {{IPA|[h]}} in Southern Levantine.

'''Lishán Didán''' is a modern [[Judeo-Aramaic language|Jewish Aramaic language]], often called ''[[Neo-Aramaic languages|Neo-Aramaic]]'' or ''Judeo-Aramaic''. It was originally spoken in [[Iranian Azerbaijan]], in the region of [[Lake Urmia]], from [[Salmas]] to [[Mahabad]]. Most speakers now live in [[Israel]].

The name ''Lishán Didán'' means 'our language'; other variations are ''Lishanán'', 'our-language', and ''Lishanid Nash Didán'', 'the language of our selves'. As this causes some confusion with similarly named dialects ([[Lishana Deni]], [[Lishanid Noshan]]), scholarly sources tend simply to use a more descriptive name, like ''Persian Azerbaijani Jewish Neo-Aramaic''.

To distinguish it from other dialects of [[Jew]]ish Neo-Aramaic, Lishán Didán is sometimes called ''Lakhlokhi'' (literally 'to-you(f)-to-you(m)') or ''Galihalu'' ('mine-yours'), demonstrating a difference of prepositions and pronominal suffixes. Lishán Didán is written in the [[Hebrew alphabet]]. Spelling tends to be highly phonetic, and elided letters are not written.

== History==
Various Neo-Aramaic dialects were spoken across a wide area from [[Lake Urmia]] to [[Lake Van]] (in [[Turkey]]), down to the plain of [[Mosul]] (in [[Iraq]]) and back across to [[Sanandaj]] (in [[Iran]] again).

There are two major dialect clusters of Lishán Didán. The northern cluster of dialects centered on [[Urmia]] and [[Salmas]] in [[West Azarbaijan]], and extended into the Jewish villages of the Turkish province of [[Van Province|Van]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Studies in Neo-Aramaic|last=Heinrichs, Wolfhard|first=|publisher=Scholars Press.|year=1990|isbn=|location=Atlanta, Georgia|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The southern cluster of dialects was focused on the town of [[Mahabad]] and villages just south of [[Lake Urmia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yaure, L|first=|date=1957|title=A Poem in the Neo-Aramaic Dialect of Urmia|url=|journal=Journal of Near Eastern Studies|volume=16|issue=2|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dialects of the two clusters are intelligible to one another, and most of the differences are due to receiving loanwords from different languages: [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] languages especially.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lishan Didan, Targum Didan: Translation Language in a Neo-Aramaic Targum Tradition|last=Rees, M|first=|publisher=Gorgias Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=Piscataway, NJ|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the Jews of Urmia worked as peddlers in the cloth trade while others were jewelers or goldsmiths.  The degree of education for the boys was primary school with only some advancing their Jewish schooling in a [[Talmud]] yeshiva.  Some of these students earned their livelihood by writing talisman and amulets. There was a small girls school with only twenty pupils.  There were two main synagogues in Urmia, one large one and one smaller one.  The large synagogue was called the synagogue of Sheikh Abdulla.

The upheavals in their traditional region after the [[World War I|First World War]] and the founding of the State of [[Israel]] led most of the Azerbaijani Jews to settle in [[Tel Aviv]] and [[Jerusalem]] and villages in various parts of the country.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  By 1918, due to the assassination of the Assyrian Patriarch and the invasion of the Ottoman forces, many Jews were uprooted from their homes and fled.  The Jews settled in Tbilisi or emigrated to Israel.  Due to the persecution and relocation, Lishán Didán began to be replaced by the speech of younger generations by [[Modern Hebrew]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Most of the native Lishan Didan speakers, speak Hebrew to their children now.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Fewer than 5,000  people are known to speak Lishán Didan, and most of them are older adults, in their sixties, who speak Hebrew as well.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/country/il/languages|title=Israel - Languages|last=|first=|date=|website=Ethnologue|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language faces extinction in the next few decades.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Two texts in Barzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic|last=Mutzafi, H|first=|publisher=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Jewish Neo-Aramaic ==
There are five main dialect groups of Neo-Aramaic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haberl|first=Charles|date=|title=The Middle East and North Africa|url=|journal=Encyclopedia of the World's Endangered Languages|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
# Jewish Azerbaijani Neo-Aramaic (Lishan Didan)
# Trans-Zab Jewish Neo-Aramaic: Also referred to as Hulaula, located in Iranian Kurdistan.
# Inter-Zab Jewish Neo-Aramaic: Located between Greater Zab and Lesser Zab in the Erbil and the Sulaymaniyah regions.
# Central Jewish Neo-Aramaic: Located in upper Greater Zab and Erbil as well. 
# [[Lishana Deni]]: Located in Northern Mosul.

== Geographical Distribution ==

=== Jewish Dialects ===
Lishan Didan is called 'Jewish Azerbaijani Neo-Aramaic' by most scholars.  Its speakers lived in Northern Iran in the townships of Northern Persian Azerbaijan (specifically Urmia, official name Rizaiye and Salamas, official name Shahpur).  Lishan Didan, translated as 'our language' is often confused with other similar dialects called [[Lishanid Noshan]] (which is also referred to as Lishan Didan).  The term [[targum]] is often used to describe the different dialects called Lishan Didan as it is a traditional and common term for the Jewish Neo-Aramaic dialects.

Another Lishan Didan dialect is called Manuscript Barzani or Barzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic.  Manuscript Barzani was spoken in a community in Iraqi Kurdistan of the Rewanduz/Arbel region.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Arabic Elements in the Jewish Neo-Aramaic Texts of Nerwa and ʿAmādīya, Iraqi Kurdistan|last=Sabar, Y|first=|publisher=American Oriental Society|year=1984|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This dialect is also called 'Targum' as it follows distinct translation techniques used by [[Targum Onkelos]] and [[Targum Jonathan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Neo-Aramaic Languages|last=Jastrow, O|first=|publisher=Library of Congress Cataloging-in-Publication Data.|year=1997|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://iris.unito.it/retrieve/handle/2318/114497/205643/Mengozzi_JSS.pdf|title=That I Might Speak and the Ear Listen to me|last=Mengozzi, A|first=|date=2010|website=On Genres in Traditional Modern Aramaic Literature.|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the men of the Barzani family were Rabbi's and Torah scholars.  The Rabbi's would travel around Kurdistan in order to set up and maintain many [[Yeshiva]]'s in the towns of Barzan, Aqra, Mosul and Amediya.  Much literature (commentaries on religious text, poetry, prayers, ritual instructions) has been compiled and published by the members of the Barzani family and their community.

''*h'' has been retained in some words in Barzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic and other communities near Kurdistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Grammar of the dialects of vernacular Syriac: as spoken by the Eastern Syrians of Kurdistan, north-west Persia, and the Plain of Mosul|last=Maclean, A. J|first=|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1895|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following displays ''*h'' retention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A grammar of neo-Aramaic: The dialect of the Jews of Arbel|last=Khan|first=G|publisher=|year=1999|isbn=|location=Leiden, Brill|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}
This is different from Jewish Urmia dialect as this dialect has the unvoiced pharyngeal /ḥ/ while Barzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic has regular pharyngealization with the voiced pharyngeal /ς/.

=== Christian Dialects ===
Many scholars separate the dialects of Jewish Neo-Aramaic and Christian Neo-Aramaic because, as in almost all cases, both communities living side by side were unintelligible from one another.  Lishan Didan is part of a large Jewish Trans-Zab continuum with dialects similar to other Jewish Neo-Aamaic dialects, while the Christian community in Salamas (neighboring the Jewish community in Salamas) is similar to dialects in the areas of Van, Northern Hakkari and across the Turkish border (in Sara, Timur, Gawar, Jilu and Dez).  The Jews of Salamas lived in a small town called Kushneh Shahr which was a few miles away from Dilman which was the capital town of the district.  The Christians of Salamas lived in the larger cities of Khosrava and Dilman itself.

Another Christian community settled in Urmia after the local Kurds and Turkish army forced them to flee their homes.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Verbal System of North-Eastern Neo-Aramaic|last=Coghill, E.|first=|date=1999|citeseerx = 10.1.1.507.4492}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over ten thousand people died en route to Urmia.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  After additional trouble in Urmia, the Christian community left and settled in Ba‘quba near Baghdad.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the early 1930s some moved to Syria and lived near the Khabur river between Hassake and Ras el Ain.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The following displays examples of divergence in phonology, morphology, and lexicon between the Jewish and Christian Urmia dialects.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Neo-aramaic and Its Linguistic Context|last=Kahn, G and Lidia, N.|first=|publisher=Gorgias Press.|year=2015|isbn=|location=Piscataway, NJ|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intelligibility==
Lishán Didán, at the northeastern extreme of this area, is somewhat intelligible with the Jewish Neo-Aramaic languages of [[Hulaula language|Hulaula]] (spoken further south, in [[Kurdistan Province (Iran)|Iranian Kurdistan]]) and [[Lishanid Noshan]] (formerly spoken around [[Kirkuk]], [[Iraq]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Jewish Neo-Aramaic Dictionary|last=Sabar|first=Y|publisher=Harrossowitz Verlag|year=2002|isbn=|location=Wiesbaden, Germany|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the local Christian Neo-Aramaic dialects of [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]] are only mildly intelligible: Christian and Jewish communities living side by side developed completely different variants of Aramaic that had more in common with their co-religionists living further away than with their neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Jewish Neo-Aramaic dialect of Urmi|last=Kahn|first=Geoffrey|publisher=Georgias Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=Piscataway, NJ|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The topography in many of the dialects of Neo-Aramaic is so distinct that small villages, (like the town of Arodhin which consisted of two Jewish families), had their own dialect.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Phonology ==
Below is a general comparison of different Neo-Aramaic dialect differences in phonology:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/neo-aramaic|title=Neo-Aramaic|last=|first=|date=|website=Jewish Virtual Library|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Louise M. Antony''' is an American [[philosopher]] who is currently professor of philosophy at the [[University of Massachusetts, Amherst]]. Before joining the faculty at UMass Amherst in 2006, she taught at several other colleges and universities. She specializes in [[philosophy of mind]], [[epistemology]], [[feminist theory]], and [[philosophy of language]].

Besides for her academic work, she has also spoken out about the oppressive climate for women in philosophy; she wrote one of a series of articles in the New York Times' Opinionator column in the fall of 2013,&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite web|last=Antony|first=Louise|title=Academia's Fog of Male Anxiety|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/05/in-academia-a-fog-of-male-anxiety/|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she founded with [[Ann Cudd]] the Mentoring Project for Junior Women in Philosophy in 2011.&lt;ref name="KU"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mentoring Project Workshop|url=http://www.philosophy.ku.edu/mentoring-project/|publisher=University of Kansas|accessdate=25 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029111901/http://www.philosophy.ku.edu/mentoring-project/|archivedate=29 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 2015-2016 she served as president of the eastern division of the [[American Philosophical Association]].

==Early life and education==
Antony received a bachelor's in philosophy from [[Syracuse University]] in 1975,&lt;ref name=ver&gt;{{cite web|title=Veritas :: Louise Antony|url=http://veritas.org/speakers/louise-antony/|accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  after which she went to [[Harvard University]] for her doctorate, which she received in 1981.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; Her first academic position was at the [[University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign]], 1980-1981. She taught at [[Boston University]] from 1981-1983; [[Bates College]] from 1983-1986; [[North Carolina State University]] from 1986-1993; [[University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill]] from 1993-2000; and [[Ohio State University]] from 2000-2006.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web|last=Antony|first=Louise|title=UMass Philosophy - Faculty|url=http://www.umass.edu/philosophy/faculty/faculty-pages/antony.htm|publisher=University of Massachusetts, Amherst|accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She debated [[Christian apologist]] [[William Lane Craig]] in 2008 on the topic "Is God Necessary for Morality?".

==Research areas==
In her work on the philosophy of mind, Antony stakes out a middle ground between eliminative materialists like [[Daniel Dennett]] who deny the possibility of the existence of the mind, and groups such dualists and neutral monists - those who look for non-physical explanations of the mind.&lt;ref name=ip&gt;{{cite web|title=Louise Antony|url=http://www.informationphilosopher.com/solutions/philosophers/antony/|work=The Information Philosopher|publisher=Information Philosopher|accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antony is also a prominent proponent of analytic feminist philosophy, suggesting that earlier feminist philosophers overlooked the extent to which analytic philosophers had rejected the ideas of empiricists and rationalists, and thus misidentified analytic epistemology with empiricism.&lt;ref name=sep2&gt;{{cite web|last=Garry|first=Ann|title=Analytic Feminism|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/femapproach-analytic/|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Antony | first1 = Louise M. | title = Is psychological individualism a piece of ideology? | journal = [[Hypatia (journal)|Hypatia]] | volume = 13 | issue = 3 | pages = 157–174  | doi = 10.1111/j.1527-2001.1995.tb00742.x | date = August 1995 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
Antony has written a number of peer-reviewed papers, book reviews, and essays.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;  She has also edited and introduced three volumes: ''Philosophers Without Gods'' (Oxford University Press, 2007), a collection of essays by leading philosophers reflecting on their life without religious faith (3); ''Chomsky and His Critics'', with Norbert Hornstein (Blackwell Publishing Company, 2003);and, with Charlotte Witt, ''A Mind of One's Own: Feminist Essays on Reason and Objectivity'', (Westview Press, 1993), which was expanded in 2002 in a second edition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umass.edu/philosophy/faculty/faculty-pages/antony.htm Profile page: Louise Antony, University of Massachusetts, Amherst]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427095915/http://www.umass.edu/philosophy/faculty/faculty-pages/antony.htm |date=2014-04-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Portrait of Niccolò Machiavelli by Santi di Tito.jpg|thumb|[[Niccolò Machiavelli]]]]

'''Machiavellianism''' is defined as the political theory of Niccolò Machiavelli, especially the view that any means can be used if it is necessary to maintain power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Machiavellianism|title=Definition of MACHIAVELLIANISM|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word comes from the [[Italian Renaissance]] diplomat and writer [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], born in 1469, who wrote ''[[The Prince|Il Principe]]'' (''The Prince''), among other works.

In modern psychology, Machiavellianism is one of the [[dark triad]] personalities, characterized by a duplicitous interpersonal style, a cynical disregard for morality, a lack of empathy, and a focus on [[self-interest]] and personal gain.&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt;

==Political thought==
{{Main|Niccolò Machiavelli}}
After his exile from political life in 1512, Machiavelli took to a life of writing, which led to the publishing of his most famous work, ''The Prince.'' The book would become infamous for its recommendation for rulers to be ready to act in unscrupulous ways, such as resorting to deceit and cunning, political assassination, and the usage of fear as a means of keeping order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GF6X2ow__MgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=the+foundations+of+modern+political+thought&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiws8O47sLeAhXoYN8KHbA_AYUQ6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20foundations%20of%20modern%20political%20thought&amp;f=false|title=The Foundations of Modern Political Thought: Volume 1, The Renaissance|last=Skinner|first=Quentin|date=1978-11-30|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521293372|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 16th century, immediately following the publication of ''The Prince'', Machiavellianism was seen as a foreign plague infecting northern European politics, originating in Italy, and having first infected France. It was in this context that the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] of 1572 in Paris came to be seen as a product of Machiavellianism, a view greatly influenced by the [[Huguenot]] Innocent Gentillet, who published his ''Discours contre Machievel'' in 1576, which was printed in ten editions in three languages over the next four years.&lt;ref&gt;Anglo, 283 – see also the whole chapter&lt;/ref&gt; Gentillet held, quite wrongly according to Sydney Anglo, that Machiavelli's "books [were] held most dear and precious by our Italian and Italionized [''sic''] courtiers" in France (in the words of his first English translation), and so (in Anglo's paraphrase) "at the root of France's present degradation, which has culminated not only in the St Bartholomew massacre but the glee of its perverted admirers".&lt;ref&gt;Anglo, 286&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact there is little trace of Machiavelli in French writings before the massacre, not that politicians telegraph their intentions in writing, until Gentillet's own book, but this concept was seized upon by many contemporaries, and played a crucial part in setting the long-lasting popular concept of Machiavellianism.&lt;ref&gt;Anglo, Chapters 10 and 11; p. 328 etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

The English playwrights [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Christopher Marlowe]] incorporated this view into some of their works.  Shakespeare's Gloucester, later Richard III, refers to Machiavelli in ''[[Henry VI, Part III]]'', for instance:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;I can add colours to the chameleon,
Change shapes with Proteus for advantages,
And set the murderous Machiavel to school.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''[[The Jew of Malta]]'' (1589–90) "Machievel" in person speaks the Prologue, claiming not to be dead, but to have possessed the soul of (the Duke of) Guise, "And, now the Guise is dead, is come from France/ To view this land, and frolic with his friends" (Prologue, lines 3–4).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/901/901-h/901-h.htm Project Gutenberg ''Jew of Malta'' text]&lt;/ref&gt; Marlowe's last play, ''[[The Massacre at Paris]]'' (1593) takes the massacre, and the following years, as its subject, with [[Henry I, Duke of Guise|the Duke of Guise]] and [[Catherine de' Medici]] both depicted as Machiavellian plotters, bent on evil from the start.

The ''[[Anti-Machiavel]]'' is an 18th-century essay by [[Frederick the Great]], King of [[Prussia]] and patron of [[Voltaire]], rebutting ''The Prince'', and Machiavellianism. It was first published in September 1740, a few months after Frederick became king, and is one of many such works.

[[Denis Diderot]], the French philosopher, viewed Machiavellianism as "an abhorrent type of politics" and the "art of tyranny".&lt;ref&gt;Diderot, Denis (ascribed by Jacques Proust). "Machiavellianism." The Encyclopedia of Diderot &amp; d'Alembert Collaborative Translation Project. Translated by Timothy Cleary. Ann Arbor: Michigan Publishing, University of Michigan Library, 2004. Trans. of "Machiavelisme," Encyclopédie ou Dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers, vol. 9. Paris, 1765. Accessed 31 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==
{{Main|Machiavellian intelligence}}
Machiavellianism is also a term that some [[Social psychology|social]], forensic and [[Personality psychology|personality]] psychologists use to describe a person's tendency to be unemotional, and therefore able to detach themself from conventional morality and hence to [[deceive]] and [[Psychological manipulation|manipulate]] others. In the 1960s, Richard Christie and Florence L. Geis developed a test for measuring a person's level of Machiavellianism  (sometimes referred to as the ''Machiavelli test'').&lt;ref&gt;Christie, R., and F. L. Geis. (1970) "How devious are you? Take the Machiavelli test to find out." ''Journal of Management in Engineering'' 15.4: 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Their ''Mach&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;IV'' test, a twenty-statement personality survey, became the standard self-assessment tool of Machiavellianism. People scoring high on the scale (''high Machs'') tend to endorse statements such as, "Never tell anyone the real reason you did something unless it is useful to do so," (No. 1) but not ones like, "Most people are basically good and kind" (No. 4), "There is no excuse for [[lie|lying]] to someone else," (No. 7) or "Most people who get ahead in the world lead clean, moral lives" (No. 11). Using their scale, Christie and Geis conducted multiple experimental tests that showed that the interpersonal strategies and behavior of "High Machs" and "Low Machs" differ.&lt;ref name=basic&gt;Christie, R. &amp; Geis, F. (1970) "Studies in Machiavellianism". NY: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Their basic results have been widely replicated.&lt;ref name=McIlwain&gt;McIlwain, D. 2003. Bypassing empathy: mapping a Machiavellian theory of mind and sneaky power. In Individual Differences In Theory Of Mind, eds. B. Repacholi and V. Slaughter. Macquarie Monographs in Cognitive Science. NY: Psychology Press. 39-68.&lt;/ref&gt; Measured on the ''Mach&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;IV'' scale, males are, on average, slightly more Machiavellian than females.&lt;ref name="basic"/&gt;&lt;ref name=instrument&gt;Gunnthorsdottir, A., McCabe, K. &amp; Smith, V. 2002 "Using the Machiavellianism instrument to predict trustworthiness in a bargaining game". Journal of Economic Psychology 23, 49-66&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motivation===
A 1992 review described Machiavellian motivation as related to cold [[selfishness]] and pure instrumentality, and those high on the trait were assumed to pursue their motives (e.g. sex, achievement, sociality) in duplicitous ways. More recent research on the motivations of high Machs compared to low Machs found that they gave high priority to money, [[Power (social and political)|power]], and competition and relatively low priority to community building, self-love, and family concerns. High Machs admitted to focusing on unmitigated achievement and winning at any cost.&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt;

===Abilities===
Due to their skill at interpersonal manipulation, there has often been an assumption that high Machs possess superior intelligence, or ability to understand other people in social situations. However, research has firmly established that Machiavellianism is unrelated to [[IQ]]. Furthermore, studies on [[emotional intelligence]] have found that high Machiavellianism actually tends to be associated with low emotional intelligence as assessed by both performance and questionnaire measures. Both [[empathy|emotional empathy]] and emotion recognition have been shown to have negative correlations with Machiavellianism. Additionally, research has shown that Machiavellianism is unrelated to a more advanced [[theory of mind]], that is, the ability to anticipate what others are thinking in social situations. If high Machs actually are skilled at manipulating others, this appears to be unrelated to any special cognitive abilities as such.&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt;

=== Relations with other personality traits ===
Machiavellianism is one of the three personality traits referred to as the [[dark triad]], along with [[narcissism]] and [[psychopathy]]. Some psychologists consider Machiavellianism to be essentially a subclinical form of psychopathy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Social Intelligence|last=Goleman |first=Daniel|authorlink=Daniel Goleman|year= 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; although recent research suggests that while Machiavellianism and psychopathy overlap, they are distinct personality constructs.&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt; Psychopathy differs from Machiavellianism in impulsivity and a lack of self control.&lt;ref name=Dark_Triad&gt;Paulhus, D. L. &amp; Williams, K. M. 2002. "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Delroy_Paulhus/publication/222828329_The_Dark_Triad_of_Personality_Narcissism_Machiavellianism_and_Psychopathy/links/59d735c6a6fdcc52acae2c10/The-Dark-Triad-of-Personality-Narcissism-Machiavellianism-and-Psychopathy.pdf The Dark Triad of personality: Narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy]". Journal of Research in Personality 36 (2002) 556–563.&lt;/ref&gt;Machiavellianism has been found to be negatively correlated with [[Agreeableness]] (''r'' = −0.47) and [[Conscientiousness]] (''r'' = −0.34), two dimensions of the [[Big five personality traits|Big Five]] personality model (NEO-PI-R).&lt;ref name=Dark_Triad/&gt; However, Machiavellianism correlates more highly with the [[Honesty-humility]] dimension of the six-factor [[HEXACO model]] than with any of the Big Five dimensions.&lt;ref name=handbook&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Individual Differences in Social Behavior|year=2009|publisher=The Guilford Press|location=New York/London|isbn=978-1-59385-647-2|pages=257–273|author=Jones, Daniel N.|author2=Paulhus, Delroy L.|editor=Leary, Mark R. |editor2=Hoyle, Rick H|chapter=Chapter 7.  Machiavellianism}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Machiavellianism has also been located within the [[interpersonal circumplex]], which consists of the two independent dimensions of agency and communion. Agency refers to motivation to succeed and to individuate the self, whereas communion refers to motivation to merge with others and to support group interests. Machiavellianism lies in the quadrant of the circumplex defined by high agency and low communion.&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt; Machiavellianism has been found to lie diagonally opposite from a circumplex construct called ''self-construal'', a tendency to prefer communion over agency. This suggests that people high in Machiavellianism do not simply wish to achieve, they wish to do so at the expense of (or at least without regard to) others.&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt;

===Game theory===

In 2002, the Machiavellianism scale of Christie and Geis was applied by behavioral [[game theory|game theorists]] Anna Gunnthorsdottir, [[Kevin McCabe (economist)|Kevin McCabe]] and [[Vernon L. Smith]]&lt;ref name="instrument"/&gt; in their search for explanations for the spread of observed behavior in experimental games, in particular individual choices which do not correspond to assumptions of material self-interest captured by the standard [[Nash equilibrium]] prediction. It was found that in a [[trust (social sciences)|trust]] game, those with high MACH-IV scores tended to follow [[homo economicus]]' equilibrium strategies while those with low MACH-IV scores tended to deviate from the equilibrium, and instead made choices that reflected widely accepted moral standards and [[social preferences]].

===Dimensionality===

Although there have been myriad proposed factor structures, two dimensions emerge most consistently within factor-analytic research - differentiating Machiavellian views from tactics.&lt;ref name="Fehr, Samsom, and Paulhus, 1992"&gt;Fehr, B.; Samsom, D.; and Paulhus, D.

Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Mach-IV scale is unable to reliably capture the two dimensions, a 10-item subset of the scale known as the Two-Dimensional Mach-IV (TDM-V), reproduces the views and tactics dimensions across countries, genders, sample types, and scale category length.&lt;ref name="Monaghan, C., Bizumic, B., &amp; Sellbom, M., 2016"&gt;Monaghan, C., Bizumic, B., &amp; Sellbom, M.

Personality and Individual Differences, 130, 161–173. https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2018.03.047.&lt;/ref&gt; The views dimension appears to capture the neurotic, narcissistic, pessimistic, and distrustful aspects of Machiavellianism, while the tactics component captures the more unconscientious, self-serving, and deceitful behavioural aspects (phenotypically similar to psychopathy). Although no research has so far identified the causal direction of the two-dimensions, it is likely that the views generate and validate the use of Machiavellian tactics.

==In the workplace==
{{Main|Machiavellianism in the workplace}}
Machiavellianism in the [[workplace]] is the employment of cunning and duplicity in a business setting. It is an increasingly studied phenomenon. The root of the concept of Machiavellianism is the book ''The Prince'' by Machiavelli which lays out advice to rulers how to govern their subjects. Machiavellianism has been studied extensively over the past 40 years as a personality characteristic that shares features with [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] [[leadership]], and morally bankrupt tactics. It has in recent times been adapted and applied to the context of the workplace and organizations by many writers and academics. The Machiavellian typically only manipulates on occasions where it is necessary to achieve the required objectives.&lt;ref name=Kessler&gt;Kessler, SR; Bandeiii, AC; Spector, PE; Borman, WC; Nelson, CE; and Penney, LM 2010. Reexamining Machiavelli: A three dimensional model of Machiavellianism in the workplace. Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 40, 1868–1896&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oliver James (psychologist)|Oliver James]] identifies Machiavellianism as one of the dark triadic personality traits in the workplace, the others being narcissism and psychopathy.&lt;ref&gt;James O Office Politics: How to Thrive in a World of Lying, Backstabbing and Dirty Tricks (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

A new model of Machiavellianism based in organizational settings consists of three factors:&lt;ref name=Kessler/&gt;
* maintaining [[Power (social and political)|power]]
* harsh management tactics
* manipulative behaviors

The presence of Machiavellianism in an organisation has been positively correlated with [[counterproductive workplace behaviour]] and [[workplace deviance]].&lt;ref name=Kessler/&gt;

'''Madeleine d'Arsant de Puisieux''' (1720–1798), was a French writer and active [[feminist]].

''La Femme n'est pas inférieure à l'homme'' that Puisieux published in 1750.
]]

== Life ==
Madeleine de Puisieux, was born in Paris on November 28, 1720. Although not much is known about her early life, Puisieux worked to become a published author. In 1745, she achieved her goal and with the help of her friend, [[Denis Diderot]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Story of Civilization Volume 9:The Age of Voltaire|last=Durant|first=Will|publisher=Simon&amp;Schuster|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=624, 675–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; she published one of her first works entitled ''Les Caractères'' sometime in the year 1750.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Madeleine de Puisieux: ethical egoism in the search for happiness|last=Kinsey|first=Susan|publisher=Columbia University|year=1978|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Puisieux also published one of her most famous works later that year entitled, ''[[:fr:La femme n'est pas inférieure à l'homme|La Femme n'est pas inférieure à l'homme]]'' ("Woman is not inferior to man"). This was a publication of a previously anonymous piece where Puisieux translated and brought up topics in the book about the equality of sexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Studies in Eighteenth-century Culture. Vol. 44|last=Hayes|first=Julie|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She based these questions found in the 1405 publication, ''[[The Book of the City of Ladies|La Cité des dames]] (''The City of ladies'')''  by [[Christine de Pizan|Christine de Pisan]]. The following year, it was republished under the title ''[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b8622084d Le Triomphe des dames] (''The Triumph of the ladies.) It is sometimes debated whether Puisieux's future husband [[:fr:Philippe-Florent de Puisieux|Philippe-Florent de Puisieux]] (1713–1772) helped Puisieux with the translations used in the final publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Writers of the French Enlightenment|last=Spencer|first=Samia|publisher=Farmington Hills|year=2005|isbn=0-787681318|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born on November 28, 1713 and died in October 1772, Philippe was the French ambassador to [[Switzerland]]. Among other formalities, he was also a well-known lawyer at the Paris parliament. In the year 1750, Madeleine de Puisieux met and fell in love with Philippe-Florent de Puisieux, eventually marrying him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Madame de Puisieux, moraliste et romancière(1720-1798)|last=Garnier|first=Camille|publisher=Indiana University|year=1978|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Achievements ==
Throughout her relationships, Puisieux had no children. She however did seek opportunities to help the younger generation of girls by publishing advice books for girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Conduct Books for Girls in Enlightenment France|last=Berenguier|first=Nadine|publisher=|year=|isbn=1409478580|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This made her name a well-known one among the population as Puisieux wanted to encourage girls to know about gender equality with feminism as her platform of teaching.

With the wide known success of her works, Puisieux was recognized by the late, [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]]. After his death in 1774, she settled down with her husband and was awarded a state pension in 1795.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Death ==
On April 12, 1798, Madeleine de Puisieux died in her hometown in Paris at the age of 78 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Diderot et Madame de Puisieux|last=Laborde|first=Alice|publisher=ANMA Libri|year=|isbn=0-915838-54-0|location=Saratoga|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship with Denis Diderot ==
Madeleine de Puisieux had a relationship with longtime and fellow philosopher, art critic, [[Denis Diderot]] from 1746 to 1755. During that time she was a mistress. Although never married, she was the kept woman to Diderot during their time together. In that time, they worked together on some of Puisieux's works as he helped get the works published. Puisieux was not the only mistress to Diderot. She shared the title with [[Sophie Volland]], and [[Mme de Maux]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Naim Frashëri''' (25 May 1846 &amp;ndash; 20 October 1900) was an [[Albanians|Albanian]] poet, writer and one of the most prominent patriots of the [[Albanian National Awakening|Albanian national movement for independence from the Ottoman Empire]]. He is widely regarded as the national poet of [[Albania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cornis-Pope|first=Marcel|title=History of the literary cultures of East-Central Europe: junctures and disjunctures in the 19th and 20th centuries|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|year=2004|series=History of the Literary Cultures of East-central Europe|volume=2|pages=291|isbn=90-272-3453-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5pAwqsSyTlsC&amp;pg=PA291}}&lt;/ref&gt; He authored 22 works.

==Early life and career==
Naim Frashëri was born in 1846 in [[Frashër]], a village of 1500 residents in the [[Vilayet of Janina]]. He was one of eight children of Halit bey (1797–1859) and Emine Hanım (1814–1861).&lt;ref name="Gawrych13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Elsie2005-67"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Elsie|title=Albanian Literature: A Short History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ox3Wx1Nl_2MC&amp;pg=PA67|year=2005|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-84511-031-4|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gawrych13"/&gt; His paternal family traditions held that they were descendants of [[timar]] holders that hailed from the [[Berat]] region before going to live in Frashër.&lt;ref name="Gawrych13"/&gt; While their mother Emine Hanım (1814–1861)&lt;ref name="Elsie2005-67"/&gt; was descended from [[Imrahor Ilyas Bey]], a distinguished 15th century Ottoman Albanian commander from the Korçë area.&lt;ref name="Gawrych13"/&gt; Kristo Frashëri, an Albanian historian member of the family points out that the first Frashëri documented was an Albanian merchant in Thessaloniki.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Frashëri|first=Kristo|title=Frashëri, shkëlqimi dhe rrënimi i tij: vështrim i shkurtër

Naim spent his childhood in Frashër, where he began learning [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Arabic]]. As a member of a family which gave him a strong [[Bektashi]] upbringing he spent a part of his time in a Bektashi tekke. After the death of their parents the family moved to [[Ioannina]] in 1865. The oldest of brothers, Abdyl (b. 1839), became the family head at the age of 22 and started working as a merchant.&lt;ref name="Elsie2005"/&gt; That year Naim and Sami enrolled in the [[Zosimaia School|Zosimaia secondary school]].&lt;ref name="Elsie2005-70"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Elsie|title=Albanian Literature: A Short History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ox3Wx1Nl_2MC&amp;pg=PA70|year=2005|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-84511-031-4|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gawrych1326"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|pp=13, 26.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The education there provided Naim with the basics of a classical education along Western lines.&lt;ref name="Gawrych13"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p= [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=wPOtzk-unJgC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=The+crescent+and+the+eagle:+Ottoman+rule,+Islam+and+the+Albanians,+1874-1913+Saadi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=AGWHSK5Fc0&amp;sig=JBGVpFnzKAt-JJkvSL9d-2oQbqc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiO6suMwtbNAhWEi5QKHX6DBI8Q6AEIMTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20crescent%20and%20the%20eagle%3A%20Ottoman%20rule%2C%20Islam%20and%20the%20Albanians%2C%201874-1913%20Saadi&amp;f=false 13].}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from languages he learned in the Zosiamaia (Ancient and Modern Greek, French and Italian), Naim took private lessons in Persian, Turkish and Arabic from two important local Bektashi.&lt;ref name="Elsie2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Qosja2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rexhep Qosja|title=Porosia e madhe: monografi mbi krijimtarinë e Naim Frashërit [The Great Instruction]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qM47MwAACAAJ|year=2000|pp=34-42|isbn=9789992713372}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frashëri showed interest in Bektashism, [[Persian poetry]] and [[Age of Enlightenment]]. Robert Elsie states that "His education in Janina made of him a prime example of a nineteenth-century Ottoman intellectual equally at home in both cultures, the Western and the Oriental".&lt;ref name="Elsie2005"/&gt; 

After he finished his studies in 1870, Naim worked for a few months at the press office in Istanbul (1870) but was forced to return to his home village because of tuberculosis. The climate of Frashër helped Naim and soon he started work in the Ottoman bureaucracy as a clerk in Berat and later in Saranda (1872-1877).&lt;ref name="Shuteriqi1971"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dhimitër S.

An Albanian magazine ''[[Drita (magazine)|Drita]]'' appeared in 1884 under the editorship of [[Petro Poga]] and later [[Pandeli Sotiri]] with Naim Frashëri being a behind the scenes editor as Muslim Albanians were not allowed by Ottoman authorities to write in Albanian at that time.&lt;ref name="Skendi146"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gawrych88"/&gt; Naim Frashëri and other Albanian writers like his brother Sami Frashëri would write using pseudonyms in Poga's publication.&lt;ref name="Skendi146"&gt;{{harvnb|Skendi|1967|p=146.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gawrych88"/&gt; Due to a lack of education material Naim Frashëri, his brother Sami and several other Albanians wrote textbooks  in the Albanian language during the late 1880s for the [[Mësonjëtorja|Albanian school in Korçë]].&lt;ref name="Gawrych88"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p=88.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to [[Faik Konitza]] in 1887, Frashëri expressed sentiments regarding the precarious state of the Ottoman Empire that the best outcome for Albanians was a future annexation of all of Albania by [[Austria-Hungary]].&lt;ref name="Skendi268"&gt;{{harvnb|Skendi|1967|p=268.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1900 Naim Frashëri died in Istanbul. During the 1950s the Turkish government allowed for his remains to be sent and reburied in Albania.&lt;ref name="Gawrych200"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p=200.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence and Recognition==

'''Namlish''' (a [[portmanteau]] of the words '''Namibian''' and '''English''') is a form of [[English language|English]] spoken in [[Namibia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.namibian.org/travel/misc/namlish.html www.namibian.org] Namlish&lt;/ref&gt; English is the country's official language since independence in 1990. Because it is the second or third language for the majority of the Namibians, local usage can vary significantly from usage elsewhere in the [[English-speaking world]]. [[Namibian English]], or Namlish, shares many similarities with [[South African English]], having been influenced both by [[Afrikaans]] and indigenous [[African languages]].

==Literal translations==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2010}}
Namlish comes from literal translations, mostly from Oshiwambo, [[Kavango languages]] and Afrikaans, but occasionally from Damara, Herero or other tribal languages. Namlish is generally spoken by the Oshiwambo and Kavango speaking people. In the Oshiwambo language, the "l" and "r" are exchanged. In Kavango, they are not exchanged.
* Example 1: "I'm coming now" comes from the Afrikaans saying "Ek kom nou," as well as the Oshiwambo saying, "Onde ya paife."
* Example 2: When people are greeting another, they occasionally say "yes sir" which is translated exactly from the Afrikaans saying, "ja meneer."
* Example 3: Namlish speakers often use only the present continuous, or [[present progressive]] aspect of a verb at times when native English speakers would employ the present simple. This is due, in part, to direct translation from Oshiwambo and Kavango to English. In Oshiwambo and Kavango, the verb form remains the same in either case. Whenever someone wants to indicate possession of anything, he or she "is having" that particular object. The same goes for use of the past continuous tense in the place of the simple past.
* Example 4: When people ask time they often say "how late is it?" which is translated from Afrikaans "Hoe laat is dit?" and German "Wie spät ist es?".
* Example 5: Some of the Oshiwambo speaking people would say "Led" instead of "Red".
* Example 6: When asking how you are doing, Namibians would say, "Whatz up" which comes from the word "weni" from Kavango.

==Some observations==
* Many Namibians repeat single-word responses twice, e.g. "Hi hi", "Fine fine" and "Sharp sharp" are all common responses in casual conversation.
* Upon asking ''How are you?'' Namlish speakers will greet you with ''Yes!'' or  ''Yebo!'' ''Yebo'' comes from Zulu, which is an emphatic "yes" said throughout southern Africa.
* Directions can be very vague: ''That side'' is usually the answer.
* ''This one'' and  ''that one'' are frequently used to talk about children and elderly people.
* 'I'm coming now now', 'I'm coming just now', 'I'm coming now now', 'I'm coming right now': All rather vague variations regarding time. Each repetition of the word "now" represents a closer approximation of the typical English "now". Three repetitions of the word is generally the most you will hear. It usually means a minute or less before the activity in question begins. 
* "I'm coming" can mean numerous things. Usually, it means "I'm leaving and coming back within 5 minutes or not at all". Whereas "I'm coming now now" means "I'm coming right back now for sure".
* The word "somehow" is used to describe an event that was all-right, average, or unexceptional. When asked about a day, weekend, holiday, etc., Namibians often respond by saying it was "somehow". (Namibians frequently use, as in this instance, an adverb in place of an adjective. Another example of this is the use of the word "better". When asked about an exam, the response is often simply, "Better". What it is better than is never specified.)
* Whenever asking "How are you?", nearly always the answer is "fine".
* When talking about something small, Namibians use "ka..." (kaboy: small/little boy, kathing: something small in size).
* Words like "kutja" (pronounced as kusha) or Kama/kamastag are used instead of "apparently".
* First names and surnames become confused, e.g. Peter Smith can be referred to as Mr. Peter, not Mr. Smith.

==Pronunciation==
As Namlish is its own dialect of English, it has its own pronunciation of English words. For instance, ''clothes'' is almost always pronounced with two syllables. Even [[Hifikepunye Pohamba]] (Namibia’s former president) pronounces it this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1960">'''Nasal emission''' is the abnormal passing of oral air through a [[palatal cleft]], or from some other type of [[Velopharyngeal inadequacy|velopharyngeal inadequacy (VPI)]], during the production of a [[consonant]] that requires a buildup of oral [[air pressure]] for proper [[pronunciation]], such as /p/ or /s/.  The escaping air tends to reduce the oral air pressure and impede the proper production of the consonant.  Secondary effects sometimes noted with nasal emission are the development of improper compensatory pronunciation habits, including using a very soft voice that uses less breath pressure.  Nasal emission can be detected by a number of simple techniques, such as looking for the fogging of a mirror held under the [[nares]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asha.org/about/publications/leader-online/archives/2006/060207/060207c.htm Kummer, A. W. (2006, Feb. 7). Resonance disorders and nasal emission: Evaluation and treatment using "low tech" and "no tech" procedures. The ASHA Leader, 11(2), 4, 26.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118233907/http://asha.org/about/publications/leader-online/archives/2006/060207/060207c.htm |date=2009-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or measured more definitively by means of a nasal [[pneumotachograph]], as in the [http://www.microtronics-nc.com/Perci-sar.htm Perci-Sar] system or the [https://web.archive.org/web/20081205010711/http://www.glottal.com/Products/NVS.htm#NE2 NEM system] system from [http://www.glottal.com Glottal Enterprises].

The measurement of nasal emission in consonants is linked with the measurement of nasalance in vowels under the term [[nasometry]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4307">'''Nation’s school''' ({{lang-tr|Millet mektebi}}) was the name of a campaign of series of courses offered to adults to learn the [[Latin alphabet]] in Turkey in 1929–1932.

==Background==
{{main|Turkish alphabet}}
The alphabet of the [[Ottoman Empire]], just like the many other Islamic countries, was the [[Arabic alphabet]]. This alphabet was incapable of reproducing some vowels in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. Being the script of [[Quran]], it was considered to be unalterable.  However, [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]], the founder of the Turkish Republic, decided in 1928 to adopt Latin alphabet. The [[Turkish alphabet]], actually extended Latin alphabet, has 29 letters, missing the letters "Q", "W", and "X". The other 23 letters are identical to those in the Latin alphabet. There are also [[Umlaut (linguistics)|umlaut]] versions of "O", "U" and "I" as well as "Ç", "Ş" and "Ğ".

==Alphabet reform==
{{see|Atatürk's Reforms}}
In June 1928, Atatürk asked [[Mustafa Necati]], the Minister of [[Ministry of National Education (Turkey)|National Education]] to form a committee to adopt the Latin alphabet. On 9 August 1928, Atatürk announced that the Latin alphabet would replace the Arabic alphabet.  On 1 November 1928, the [[3rd Parliament of Turkey|parliament]] passed the law of the new Turkish alphabet as Act no 1353, and on 11 November 1928, the [[5th government of Turkey|government]] decided to establish the "nation’s school". The project started on 24 November 1928. These schools were actually series of short courses for the adults. According to [[Falih Rıfkı Atay]], a member of the committee, learning of the Latin alphabet was more difficult for the literate people, who already used Arabic alphabet than for the illiterate people.&lt;ref&gt;Refik Halit Karay:''Çankaya'',{{ISBN|975-6461-05-5}} p 482&lt;/ref&gt; He added that if the rate of literacy was not so low, the alphabet reform would be impossible.

==First day of the campaign==
[[File:Ataturk-20 September 1928.jpg|thumb|upright|Atatürk introducing the new [[Turkish alphabet]] in [[Kayseri]]. ]]
[[File:Sivas_Turkish_alphabet.jpg|thumb|Atatürk introducing Turkish alphabet in [[Sivas]]. ]]

The first example of the Nation’s school was set in [[Dolmabahçe Palace]]. Beginning by 1 January 1929, many schools were opened all over the country. Mustafa Necati, who was responsible for these schools, died on the very same day the schools opened due to appendicitis. He is now considered as one of the pioneers of the Turkish alphabet.

==School regulations== 
According to regulations, these schools were compulsory for everybody in the age group of 14–45 years. Two courses per week were offered to women while four courses a week were available for men. The duration was 2–4 months depending on the prior education of the participants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ansiklopedim.info/?p=4518 Online encyclopaedia {{tr icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; The courses were also offered to prisoners. In the 1930s, most villages had no schools. For these villages mobile teaching teams were formed. All particioants were expected to pass a final exam to obtain a certificate. The top scoring participant of each school received a signed photo of Atatürk and a book of the Turkish constitution.&lt;ref name="s"&gt;[http://www.serenti.org/millet-mektepleri/ Serenti page {{tr icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

Atatürk, who earned the title ''başöğretmen'' (literally "head teacher") actively participated in the Nation’s school program, and taught the new alphabet at his travels.

==Conclusion==
In the first year, the number of schools, actually classrooms, was 20,487, and the number of participants was 1,075,500. 485,632 men and  111,378 women received certificates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inkilap.info/2007/08/halkin-egitilmesi-sorunu.html Turkish reform page {{tr icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the term in the 1930s, the total number of the graduates reached 1,217,144.&lt;ref name="s"/&gt;

==Commemoration==
Beginning by 1981, 24 November, being the start day of the project, is  commemorated each year as "Teacher's day" in Turkey.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1699">A '''perlocutionary act''' (or '''perlocutionary effect''') is a [[speech act]], as viewed at the level of its consequences, such as persuading, convincing, scaring, enlightening, inspiring, or otherwise affecting the listener.{{what|reason=still incomplete|date=September 2016}} This is contrasted with [[locutionary act|locutionary]] and [[illocutionary act|illocutionary]] acts (which are levels of description, rather than classifications of speech acts).&lt;ref&gt;Austin, John L. (1962), ''[[How to Do Things with Words]]'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 101: "Saying something will often, or even normally, produce certain consequential effects upon the feelings, thoughts, or actions of the audience, or of the speaker, or of other persons: and it may be done with the design, intention, or purpose of producing them."&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the notion of illocutionary act, which describes the linguistic function of an utterance,{{what|date=September 2016}} a perlocutionary effect is in some sense external to the performance. It may be thought of, in a sense, as the effect of the illocutionary act via the locutionary act. Therefore, when examining perlocutionary acts, the effect on the hearer or reader is emphasized. 

As an example, consider the following utterance: "By the way, I have a CD of [[Debussy]]; would you like to borrow it?" Its illocutionary function is an ''offer'', while its intended perlocutionary effect might be to impress the listener, or to show a friendly attitude, or to encourage an interest in a particular type of music.

'''Piyadasa Sirisena''' was a [[Ceylon]]ese pioneer novelist, patriot, journalist, temperance worker and independence activist.&lt;ref name="as"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Savanadasa  |first=Jagath C  |date= 8 June 2011 |title=Piyadasa Sirisena - patriot par excellence  |url=http://archives.dailynews.lk/2011/06/08/art03.asp |magazine=Daily News online}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the author of some of the  bestselling [[Sinhalese language|Sinhalese]] novels in early 20th century. A follower of [[Anagarika Dharmapala]], Siresena was the most popular novelist of the era and most  of his novels were on nationalistic and patriotic themes. Piyadasa Sirisena used the novel as a medium through which to reform society and became one of the leaders in mass communication in the early part of the 20th century. Piyadasa Sirisena is widely considered as the father of Sinhalese novel.&lt;ref name="as"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ondln"&gt;{{Cite paper |last=Herath |first=H M Mervyn  |date=30 August 2003 |title=Birth Anniversary tomorrow : Piyadasa Sirisena - pioneer novelist and patriot |url=http://archives.dailynews.lk/2003/08/30/fea05.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his novel were reprinted even in the 21st century.

==Life and career==
Piyadasa Sirisena was born in 1875, in the countryside village called Athuruwella in Induruwa located three kilometers south of [[Bentota]] in [[Galle District]]. Sirisena was from a middle class influential family in the area.&lt;ref name="abds"&gt;{{Cite paper |date=May 22, 2017 |title=A tribute to amass communicator and national revivalist |url=http://www.island.lk/index.php?page_cat=article-details&amp;page=article-details&amp;code_title=165524}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main source of living in that area was the agriculture. He moved to Colombo after getting employment in a furniture establishment at a younger age. Piyadasa Sirisena who was inspired by Anagarika Dharmapala, was interested in the movement of [[Sinhalese Buddhist nationalism]]. The wide range of Piyadasa Sirisena's skills made him a prolific thinker and writer during the early years of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="sdgj"/&gt; His impact on the revival of nationalism through his writings remains unrivaled in the modern history of Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name="sdgj"&gt;{{Cite paper |date=27 May 2012 |title=Pioneer in national revival movement |url=http://archives.sundayobserver.lk/2012/05/27/spe07.asp |journal=Sunday Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sirisena began his career by making contributions to publications of Irvin Gunawardena who was a businessman.&lt;ref name="abds"/&gt; The publication-‘Situmina’ was first published in 1895 and subsequently Sirisena contributed articles of ‘Sarasavi Sandaresa‘ news paper edited by a leading journalist of that era known as Hemendra Sepala Perera. It was Perera who laid the platform for Piyadasa Sirisena to launch his distinguished literary career which impacted Ceylonese society to a larger extent.&lt;ref name="abds"/&gt; Piyadasa Sirisena published the Sinhalese newspaper "Sinhala Jathiya" in 1905. He also served as the editor of the 'Sinhala Baudhaya' published by the [[Mahabodhi Society]] at one time. In most of his literary and journalistic work, the core theme was nationalism and revival of Buddhism. Ceylon at this time had a increasing number of literate citizens who were well aware of their political rights and their ancient Buddhist heritage. 

It was through 'Sarasavi Sandaresa' that Piyadasa Sirisea was able to produce his first novel Roslin and Jayatissa. He wrote over twenty novels out of which the first was Jayatissa and Rosalyn. It was the most successful novel of Sirisena’ novels as it was sold more than 25,000 copies in two editions.&lt;ref name="penr"/&gt; None of Sinhala novels of that period had been as successful as Jayatissa and Rosalyn. 
Piyadasa Sirisena also was the first novelist in the country to produce detective stories. He wrote five of detective novels and one of them "Dingiri Menika" was made into a highly successful [[List of Sri Lankan films of the 1950s|film in the mid 1950s]].&lt;ref name="ding"&gt;{{Cite paper |last=Vidyatilaka |first=Dr.B.G.A.|date=20 May 2018 |title=Dingiri Menika Novel Celebrates 100 years |url=http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2018/05/20/arts/dingiri-menika-novel-celebrates-100-years |journal=Sunday Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides novels he was also a poet of exceptional talent. Most of the numerous poems he wrote were on Buddhist, nationalist and historical themes that invoked patriotic feelings in the readers mind. In addition to these Piyadasa Sirisena wrote books which included philosophical views.

Piyadasa Sirisena had to undergo two jail terms during his life time, both after [[1915 Sinhalese-Muslim riots|Sinhalese Muslim riots]] that took place in 1915 and 1918. His work as an Buddhist and independence activist always attracted suspicion of British Ceylon government. His first jail term was in 1916 and lasted 60 days when then government imposed Marshal law during the Sinhala-Muslim riots of that year which led to the imprisonment of many fellow patriots like [[D. S. Senanayake]], [[F. R. Senanayake]], the Hewavitharana brothers, [[Don Baron Jayatilaka|Sir D B Jayatilleke]] etc.&lt;ref name="penr"&gt;{{Cite paper |date=31 August 2011 |title=Piyadasa Sirisena wielded pen in the cause of freedom |url=http://archives.dailynews.lk/2011/08/31/fea03.asp |journal=Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial- at- bar which he faced was for provocation. He had written an editorial in his newspaper in which it was alleged that Sirisena had encouraged the people to rise against the government. But the government prosecutors failed to prove the charges and Sirisena was released with a fine.

The colonial British governments' policy on liquor and the spread of liquor consumption as a result in Ceylon was a cause of growing displeasure among the Sinhalese Buddhists of the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="ondln"/&gt; An anti-liquor campaign gently took shape and within a short time it had the support of the many leading Buddhists of the country. This soon formed a Temperance movement that conducted several anti-liquor campaigns in different parts of the country. Buddhist leaders such as Anagarika Dharmapala, Dr. [[W. A. de Silva]], [[Arthur V. Dias]] and [[Walisinghe Harischandra]] took part in theses campaigns. Piyadasa Sirisana also took part as an active protester against liquor and soon became a leading figure of the Ceylonese Temperance movement. He used his Sinhala Jathiya newspaper to urge people against the habit of liquor. He also used his oratorical skills to popularize and move forward their temperance movement, whenever anti-liquor meetings were held in various parts of the country.&lt;ref name="abds"/&gt;

Sirisena was a tireless worker who slept only four hours a day.&lt;ref name="sdgj"/&gt; He was married to Cecilia and had a family of nine children. He was the head of a printing establishment with 40 employees, who all depended on his success as a literary figure. After rendering a yeoman service to his motherland Piyadasa Sirisena died on May 22, 1946 at the age 71 years. [[Sri Lanka Post]] issued a postage stamp to commemorate his services to the country in 1979.&lt;ref name="post"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://picclick.co.uk/1979-Sri-Lanka-Stamp-FDC-Piyadasa-Sirisena-132611650751.html |title=1979 Sri Lanka Stamp FDC - Piyadasa Sirisena Commemoration - 22/5/1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works (selection)==
Piyadasa Sirisena was a skilled writer of both prose and verse in Sinhala and used the novel as an tool of educating the masses.&lt;ref name=b&gt;Peace at Last in Paradise, Ananda Guruge,pg 201&lt;/ref&gt; His objective was to raise their awareness of the lost glory of the [[Sinhalese people]]. His first novel on a happy marriage with Jayatissa and Rosalin as the main characters was a bestseller by any standard in [[Sri Lanka]]. He was also a journalist and his newspaper called the “Sinhala Jatiya” (Sinhala Nation) reinforced the message of his novels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.island.lk/index.php?page_cat=article-details&amp;page=article-details&amp;code_title=5852 |title=135th Birth Anniversary Heroes of Lanka: Piyadasa Sirisena |date=September 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following are some of his notable works.

'''Manuel Ricardo Palma Soriano''' (February 7, 1833 &amp;ndash; October 6, 1919) was a [[Peru]]vian author, scholar, librarian and politician. His [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] is the ''[[Tradiciones peruanas]]''.&lt;ref name="Palma 1893"&gt;{{cite book

== Biography ==
According to the official account, Manuel Ricardo Palma y Carrillo was born on February 7, 1833, in Lima, inscribed as the son of Pedro Ramón Palma and Guillerma Carrillo y Pardos, possibly his grandmother. On April 6, 1837, his father married Dominga Soriano y Carrillo, Guillerma's daughter. However, the documentary evidence shows many contradictions that was pointed out by Monsignor [[Salvador Herrera Pinto]] who relying on oral traditions and written testimonies concludes that Ricardo Palma was born in the town of Talavera, [[Andahuaylas Province|province of Andahuaylas]], [[Apurímac Region]].

His family was living in Lima after migrating from the province. His mother was a mestiza with African roots. His parents separated when he was still young. He was educated at a Jesuit school and attended the University of San Carlos on an irregular basis.  He suspended his studies to perform voluntary service in the Peruvian navy for six years.

From a young age, he dabbled in politics as a member of the liberal camp. In 1860 he was believed to have participated in a failed plot against president [[Ramón Castilla]] which resulted in an  exile to [[Chile]] from which he returned in October 1862.  He made a trip to Europe in 1864-1865 and when he returned to Lima in 1865 he became involved again in political affairs and public service until 1876. He held the positions of Consul of Peru in [[Pará]], [[Brazil]], Senator for the Loreto and official in the Ministry of War and Navy.

The [[War of the Pacific]] (1879–1883) between Chile and Peru disrupted Palma's life and resulted in the virtually complete destruction of his own library as well as that housed in the [[Biblioteca Nacional del Perú|National Library of Peru]]. After the war, Palma was named the director of the National Library, a post he held until his retirement in 1912. Palma successfully took on the task of rebuilding the National Library that was ransacked by the occupation forces of the [[Chilean army]] in 1881 following the battle of Lima during the War of the Pacific. Palma was able to bring the National Library back from the ashes so that it regained its previous stature and became recognized once again as one of the top libraries in South America. It was through his personal friendship with the then Chilean president [[Domingo Santa María]] that Palma was able to recover an estimated 10,000 books from Chilean hands, as well as many other works which were recovered through his own personal efforts.

With his lover Clemencia Ramínez in 1872, he had his son [[Clemente Palma]], who became a prominent writer of fantastic tales, usually horror stories, that were influenced by [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. In 1876, he married Cristina Román y Olivier with whom he had seven children: Félix Vital, Angélica, Ricardo, Peregrina Augusta, Cristina, Cristián and Renée Cristina. His daughter [[Angélica Palma]] was also a writer and a member of the early feminist movement in Peru.

== Literary Work ==

Ricardo Palma published his first verses and became the editor of a political and satiric newssheet called ''El Diablo'' (The Devil) at 15.

During his early years, Ricardo Palma composed romantic dramas (which he later repudiated) and poetry. His first book of verse, ''Poesías'' (Poems), appeared in 1855. He gained an early reputation as a historian with his book on the activities of the [[Spanish Inquisition]] during the period of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] (''Anales De La Inquisicion De Lima: Estudio Historico'', 1863).

He also wrote for the satirical press of Peru where he distinguished himself as a prolific columnist and one of the bastions of Peruvian political satire in the nineteenth century. He collaborated with the satirical sheet ''El Burro'' (The Donkey) and became later one of the principal contributors to the satirical magazine ''La Campana'' (The Bell). Later he founded the magazine ''La Broma'' (The Joke).  He was also a regular contributor to serious publications such as ''El Mercurio'', ''El Correo'', ''La Patria'', ''El Liberal'', ''Revista del Pacífico'' and ''Revista de Sud América''. He was further active as a foreign newspaper correspondent during the [[War of the Pacific]].
[[File:Ricardo Palama en Bogotá.JPG|thumb|Statue of Palma in [[Bogotá]].]]
Palma's literary reputation rests upon his creation and development of the [[literary genre]] known as ''tradiciones'', short stories that mix history and fiction, written both to amuse and educate, according to the author's declared intention. It was by creatively using poetic license and by deviating from "pure" history that Palma gained his large South American readership. His ''Tradiciones peruanas'' span several centuries, with an emphasis on earlier colonial and republican times in Peru.

The ''Tradiciones'' were published from 1872 to 1910 in a series of volumes, some of which are freely available on the internet (see the bottom of this page for links).&lt;ref name="Palma 1893"/&gt; There are also many different editions and selections of the ''Tradiciones'' commercially available.  The ''Tradiciones peruanas'' do not meet formal historical standards of accuracy or reliability sufficiently to be considered "history," but Palma never intended them to be read as "pure" history. Since they are primarily historical fiction, they should be understood and enjoyed as such.

The author's opinion, the opinions of the other primary sources or oral narrators of the stories he collects and transmits, as well as hearsay, play a large role in his stories. One of the best-known of the ''Tradiciones'', especially within American Spanish literature classes, is "La camisa de Margarita".[http://es.wikisource.org/wiki/La_camisa_de_Margarita].

Some of the ''Tradiciones peruanas'' have been translated into English under the title ''The Knights of the Cape and Thirty-seven Other Selections from the Tradiciones Peruanas of Ricardo Palma'' (ed. by Harriet de Onís, 1945) and more recently under the title ''Peruvian Traditions'' (ed. by Christopher Conway and translated by Helen Lane, Oxford University Press, 2004).

The ''Tradiciones peruanas'' are recognised as a considerable contribution to Peruvian and South American literature. Some critics have classified the ''Tradiciones'' as part of nineteenth-century Romanticism.

Palma's ''Tradiciones en Salsa Verde'' were published posthumously. These stories are similar to the ''Tradiciones peruanas'' but, because of their bawdy nature, they were not published during Palma's lifetime for fear of shocking the sedate Lima establishment.

Throughout his life, Ricardo Palma published various articles and books on history, the results of his own historical research such as the ''Anales De La Inquisicion De Lima: Estudio Historico'' (1863) and ''Monteagudo y Sánchez Carrión'' (1877). He was a noted linguistic scholar and wrote a number of works on the subject including the ''Neologismos y americanismos'' and ''Papeletas lexográficas''. He campaigned for recognition by the [[Real Academia Española]] of the Latin-American and Peruvian contributions to the [[Spanish language]].

==Personal letters==

In 1999, a well-known London auction house announced the sale of a batch of 50 letters that Ricardo Palma had written to an Argentinian friend. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Peru persuaded the National Library of Peru to participate in the auction. It had been more than 50 years since Peru had bought cultural heritage abroad. Today these letters are kept at the National Library of Peru. Ricardo Palma University has recently published the letters of Palma in three volumes (2005–2007).

'''Seb Seliyer''' (lit.

The language has largely converged on [[Mazandarani language|Mazandarani]], but core vocabulary remains Indic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iranica.com/articles/gypsy-ii Encyclopedia Iranica] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402100935/https://www.iranica.com/articles/gypsy-ii |date=2015-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2827">'''Speedtalk''' is a fictional [[constructed language]] and key [[plot device]] in [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s novella ''[[Gulf (novella)|Gulf]]'' (1949). Speedtalk is a [[Engineered language|logic-based language]] with complex [[syntax]], minimal [[vocabulary]], and a rich [[phoneme]] inventory (written with letters such as [[œ]], [[ħ]], [[ø]], and [[ʉ]]); it would make both communication and thought more efficient and precise. A single phoneme indicates a word, so a "word" indicates a sentence.  In the only example given, a "word" means "''The far horizons draw no nearer.''"

==Examples of Speedtalk==
Two untranslated conversations appear in the story:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"œnɪe ʀ ħøg rylp"&lt;br&gt;
"nU"&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
"tsʉmaeq?"&lt;br&gt;
"nø!"&lt;br&gt;
"zUlntsɨ."&lt;br&gt;
"ɨpbitʹ New Jersey."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Attempts at creating Speedtalks==
{{original research|section|date=August 2017}}

As the idea is outlined but not developed in Heinlein's work, many [?who?] have attempted to create languages embodying Speedtalk's principles.  

[[Mark Rosenfelder]]'s [[Zompist.com#Language Construction Kit|Language Construction Kit]] has a section on Speedtalk entitled [http://www.zompist.com/kitlong.html#howmany How many words do you need?].  He highlights the main problems with Speedtalk:
* [[Basic English]] claims to have reduced English to 850 basic words, but only by exploiting English-speakers' extensive vocabulary of homonyms and idioms
* The built-in redundancy of natural languages allows utterances to be understood in spite of not being clearly heard

This first point has been made somewhat irrelevant by the comments of Ben Sandler in his article "[https://web.archive.org/web/20000503004430/http://fatmac.ee.cornell.edu/%7Eben/speedtalk.html Speedtalk]"{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}, demonstrating a system by which many thousands of meaningful sounds can be created. As such, some have attempted to construct similar languages. [[Ithkuil]], in particular, comes close to this ideal, with the vast majority of its morphemes being a single syllable, and sometimes even a single [[phoneme]], in length. However, the author of the language states that this was not the language's primary purpose; the conciseness of its meaningful units was meant to foster "maximal communication of cognitive intent in the most efficient manner; a somewhat different purpose, in which brevity ''per se'' is irrelevant."&lt;ref&gt;"FAQs: Is Ithkuil an attempt to create a working version of Robert Heinlein’s Speedtalk language? Is conciseness the primary purpose of Ithkuil?" John Quijada. http://ithkuil.net/faqs.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trace''' ({{lang-fr|trace}}) is one of the most important concepts in [[Derridian deconstruction]]. In the 1960s, [[Jacques Derrida]] used this word in two of his early books, namely ''[[Writing and Difference]]'' and ''[[Of Grammatology]]''. 

==Overview==
In French, the word ''trace'' has a range of meanings similar to those of its English equivalent, but also suggests meanings related to the English words "track", "path", or "mark". In the preface to her [[translation]] of ''[[Of Grammatology]]'', [[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak]] wrote "I stick to 'trace' in my translation, because it 'looks the same' as Derrida's word; the reader must remind himself of at least the track, even the [[spoor_(animal)|spoor]], contained within the French word".&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Derrida, ''[[Of Grammatology]]'', trans. [[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak]] (Baltimore &amp; London: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1976), Translator's Preface, p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the meaning of a [[Sign (semiotics)|sign]] is generated from the difference it has from other signs, especially the other half of its [[Binary opposition|binary pairs]], the sign itself contains a trace of what it does not mean, [[i.e.]] bringing up the concepts of woman, normality, or speech may simultaneously evoke the concepts of man, abnormality, or writing. Derrida does not positively or strictly define trace, and denies the possibility of such a project. Indeed, words like "[[différance]]", "[[Archi-writing|arche-writing]]", "[[pharmakos]]/pharmakon", and especially "specter", carry similar meanings in many other texts by Derrida. His refusal to apply only one name to his concepts is a deliberate strategy to avoid a set of metaphysical assumptions that, he argues, have been central to the history of European thought.

Trace can be seen as an always contingent term for a "mark of the absence of a presence, an always-already absent present", of the 'originary lack' that seems to be "the condition of thought and experience". Trace is a contingent unit of the critique of language always-already present: "language bears within itself the necessity of its own critique".&lt;ref&gt;''The Languages of Criticism and The Sciences of Man: the Structuralist Controversy,'' ed. by Richard Macsey and Eugenio Donato (Baltimore, 1970), p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt; Deconstruction, unlike analysis or interpretation, tries to lay the inner contradictions of a text bare, and, in turn, build a different meaning from that: it is at once a process of destruction and construction. Derrida claims that these contradictions are neither accidental nor exceptions; they are the exposure of certain "[[metaphysics of presence|metaphysics of pure presence]]", an exposure of the "transcendental signified" always-already hidden inside language.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary of Media and Communication "transcendent signified".[http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199568758.001.0001/acref-9780199568758-e-2825] Oxford University Press: 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This "[[always already|always-already]] hidden" contradiction is trace.

== [[Metaphysics]] and logocentrism; &lt;i&gt;différance&lt;/i&gt; and trace ==

One of the very many difficulties of expressing Jacques Derrida's project ([[deconstruction]]) in simple terms is the enormous scale of it. Just to understand the context of Derrida's theory, one needs to be acquainted intimately with philosophers, such as, [[Socrates]]–[[Plato]]–[[Aristotle]], [[René Descartes]], [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Emmanuel Levinas]], [[Edmund Husserl]], [[Martin Heidegger]] and others. Some have tried to write simplified versions of this theory, such as &lt;i&gt;Deconstruction for Beginners&lt;/i&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Powell, James and Lee, Joe, ''Deconstruction for Beginners'' (Writers &amp; Readers Publishing, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Deconstructions: A User's Guide&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Royle, ''Deconstructions: A User's Guide'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; but their attempts have moved away from the original. The best way to learn about deconstruction is to read Derrida's own work; nonetheless, this short exposition of the relationship between "trace" and the Derrida's project may help orient his readers.

Derrida's philosophy is chiefly concerned with metaphysics, although he does not define it rigorously, and takes it to be "the [[science]] of presence". In his own words:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The history of metaphysics, like the history of the West, is the history of these metaphors and metonymies. Its matrix—if you will pardon me for demonstrating so little and for being so elliptical in order to bring me more quickly to my principal theme—is the determination of being as presence in all the senses of this word. It would be possible to show that all the names related to fundamentals, to principles, or to the center have always designated the constant of a presence--- [[Theory_of_forms#Forms|eidos]], [[arché]], [[telos]], energia, [[ousia]], [[aletheia]], [[Phenomenology_(philosophy)#Transcendental_phenomenology_after_the_Ideen_(1913)|transcendentality]], consciousness, or conscience, God, man, and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;"Sign, Structure &amp; Play in Human Sciences," in ''The Languages of Criticism and The Sciences of Man: the Structuralist Controversy,'' ed. by Richard Macsey and Eugenio Donato (Baltimore, 1970), p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Derrida finds the root of this metaphysics, which he calls "metaphysics of pure presence", in logos, which is internal to language itself. He calls this "[[logocentrism]]", which is a tendency towards definitive [[truth-value]]s through forced closure of structures. In his belief, it is the structure of language itself that forces us into metaphysics, best represented through truth-values, closures, speech as valorized by [[Socrates]] in ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]''. In fact, according to Derrida, Logocentrism is so all-pervasive that the mere act of opposing it cannot evade it by any margin. On the other hand, Derrida finds his Nietzschean hope (his own word is "[[Nietzschean_affirmation#Derridean_interpretation|affirmation]]") in heterogeneity, contradictions, absence etc. To counter the privileged position of the speech (&lt;i&gt;[[Langue_and_parole#Parole|parole]]&lt;/i&gt;) or the phonè, he puts forward a new science of grammé or the unit of writing: grammatology.

Unlike [[structuralism|structuralists]], Derrida does not see language as the one-to-one correspondence between [[signified and signifier]];&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed critique of the structuralist project, read ''[[Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences|Sign, Structure, and Play in Human Sciences]]'', at [http://hydra.humanities.uci.edu/derrida/sign-play.html]&lt;/ref&gt; to him, language is a play of identity and difference, an endless chain of signifiers leading to other signifiers. In spite of all the logocentric tendencies towards closure and truth-values, language, or text for that matter, always contradicts itself. This critique is inherent in all texts, not through a presence, but an absence of a presence long sought by logocentric visions. Influenced by some aspects of Freudian psycho-analysis, Derrida presents us the strategy of deconstruction, an amalgamation of Heidegger's concept of &lt;i&gt;[[Heideggerian_terminology#Destruktion|Destruktion]]&lt;/i&gt; and Levinas's concept of the Other.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Of Grammatology,'' p. 70, "I relate this concept of &lt;i&gt;trace&lt;/i&gt; to what is at the center of the latest work of Emmanuel Levinas and his critique of [[Emmanuel_Levinas#Philosophy|ontology]]: relationship to the illeity as to the [[alterity]] of a past that never was and can never be lived in the originary or modified form of presence. Reconciled here to a Heideggerian intention,–as it is not in Levinas's thought–this notion signifies, sometimes beyond Heideggerian discourse, the undermining of an ontology which, in its innermost course, has determined the meaning of being as presence and the meaning of language as the full continuity of speech. ... This deconstruction of presence accomplishes itself through the deconstruction of consciousness, and therefore through the irreducible notion of the trace (&lt;i&gt;[[Spur_(disambiguation)#In_other|Spur]]&lt;/i&gt;), as it appears in both Nietzschean and Freudian discourse."&lt;/ref&gt; 

Deconstruction as a strategy tries to find the most surprising contradictions in texts, unravel them, and built upon this; instead of finding the truth, the closure, or the steadfast meaning, it finds absence of presence, [[Free_play_(Derrida)|freeplay]] of meanings etc. . It is this absence of presence that is described as 'trace' by Derrida. However, he treats the word cautiously, and terms it thus only as a contingency measure, because the traditional meaning of the word 'trace' is a part of the scheme Derrida wants to uncloak.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Of Grammatology,'' p. 61, "The value of the transcendental arche [origin] must make its necessity felt before letting itself be erased. The concept of the arche-trace must comply with both the necessity and the erasure....The trace is not only the disappearance of origin,.....it means that the origin did not even disappear, that it was never constituted except reciprocally by a non-origin, the trace, which thus becomes the origin of the origin. From then on, to wrench the concept of the trace from the classical scheme which would derive it from a presence or from an originary non-trace and which would make of it an empirical mark, one must indeed speak of an originary trace or arche-trace."&lt;/ref&gt; 

===&lt;i&gt;Différance&lt;/i&gt;===

By the virtue of trace, signifiers always simultaneously differ and defer from the illusive signified. This is something Derrida calls "&lt;i&gt;différance&lt;/i&gt;". According to Derrida, "&lt;i&gt;Différance&lt;/i&gt; is the non-full, non-simple "origin"; it is the structured and differing origin of differences".&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Derrida, ''Speech and Phenomena: and other essays on Husserl′s theory of signs,'' trans. David Allison (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1973), p.141.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, [[language]] is labyrinthine, inter-woven and inter-related, and the threads of this labyrinth are the differences, traces. Along with "supplement", trace and &lt;i&gt;différance&lt;/i&gt; convey a picture of what language is to Derrida. All these terms are part of his strategy; he wants to use trace to "indicate a way out of the closure imposed by the system...".&lt;ref&gt;''Speech and Phenomena,'' p.141.&lt;/ref&gt; Trace is, again, not presence but an empty simulation of it: &lt;blockquote&gt;
The trace is not a presence but is rather the [[Simulacra_and_Simulation#Definition|simulacrum]] of a presence that dislocates, displaces, and refers beyond itself. The trace has, properly speaking, no place, for effacement belongs to the very structure of the trace. . . . In this way the metaphysical text is understood; it is still readable, and remains read.&lt;ref&gt;''Speech and Phenomena,'' p.156.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; It is essentially an "antistructuralist gesture",&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Derrida, "Letter to A Japanese Friend," in ''Derrida and Différance,'' ed. David Wood and Robert Bernasconi (Warwick: Parousia), 1985, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; as he felt that the "Structures were to be undone, decomposed, desedimented".&lt;ref&gt;''Derrida and Différance,'' p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Trace, or difference, is also pivotal in jeopardizing strict dichotomies:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[I]t has been necessary to analyze, to set to work, within the text of the history of philosophy, as well as within the so-called literary text,..., certain marks, shall we say,... that by analogy (I underline) I have called undecidables, that is, unities of simulacrum, "false" verbal properties (nominal or semantic) that can no longer be included within philosophical (binary) opposition, resisting and disorganizing it, without ever constituting a third term, without ever leaving room for a solution in the form of speculative dialectics.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Derrida, ''Positions,'' trans. Alan Bass (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1981), p. 42-43.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Trace is also not linear or chronological in any sense of the word,
"This trace relates no less to what is called the future than what is called the past, and it constitutes what is called the present by the very relation to what it is not, to what it absolutely is not; that is, not even to a past or future considered as a modified present".&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Derrida, ''Writing and Difference,'' trans. Alan Bass (London &amp; New York: Routledge, 1978), p. 394.&lt;/ref&gt;
Trace is a contingent strategy, a ''&lt;i&gt;[[Structure,_Sign,_and_Play_in_the_Discourse_of_the_Human_Sciences#Bricolage|bricolage]]&lt;/i&gt;'' for Derrida that helps him produce a new concept of writing (as opposed to the Socratic or Saussurean speech), where "The interweaving results in each 'element' - phoneme or grapheme - being constituted on the basis of the trace within it of the other elements of the chain or system. This interweaving, this textile, is the text produced only in the transformation of another text".&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Derrida, ''Positions,'' trans. Alan Bass (Chicago &amp; London: University of Chicago Press, 1981), p. 387-88.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Heideggerian Dasein and Derridian trace ==
{{Tone|section|date=March 2017}}
Derrida's concept of "trace" is quite similar to [[Martin Heidegger]]'s concept of [[Dasein]], although from different perspectives. Here, we see the relationship between Heideggerian [[existentialism]] and the Derridian concept of "trace", which, in turn, will also work as an indicator of a very close relationship between existentialism and deconstruction.

Derrida's first indebtedness to Heidegger lies in his use of the notion of ''[[sous rature]]'' ('under erasure'). To write 'Under erasure' is to write a word, cross it out, and then print both word and deletion. The word is inaccurate (which itself is an inaccurate word), hence the cross, yet the word is necessary, hence the printing of the word. This is one of the principal strategies of Derrida: "(possibility) of a discourse which borrows from a heritage the resources necessary for the deconstruction of that heritage itself".&lt;ref&gt;''Writing and Difference,'' p. 416&lt;/ref&gt; This is similar to the concept of bricolage coined by anthropologist Lèvi-Strauss. Derrida himself explains:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Lèvi-Strauss will always remain faithful to this double-intention: to preserve as an instrument that whose truth-value he criticizes, conserving.....all these old concepts, while exposing....their limits, treating them as tools which can still be of use. No longer is any truth-value [or rigorous meaning] attributed to them; there is a readiness to abandon them if necessary if other instruments should appear more useful. In the meantime, their relative efficacy is exploited, and they are employed to destroy this old machinery to which they belong and of which they themselves are pieces.&lt;ref&gt;''Structuralist Controversy,'' p. 254-55.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
However, now that we are done discussing this Derridian strategy, let us get back to the concept of sous rature. To understand it properly, we need to learn about [[Heidegger]]'s existentialist theories. In doing so, we will also explore the link between existentialism and [[structuralism]]. Heidegger said that the possibility of 'being', or what he called "Dasein" (meaning being-there), is the presupposition behind any definition, any defined entity. He comes to this decision through the general problem of definition: if anything is to be defined as an entity, then the question of Being, in general, have to be answered affirmatively at first.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, ''The Question of Being,'' trans. William Kluback and Jean T. Wilde, bilingual edition (New York, 1958).&lt;/ref&gt; Before we can think and decide that something exists, we must acknowledge the fact that anything can be. This Being is not an answer to a question, as it predates any thought, or possibility of thought: if the subject of your thought "exists", then the Being is always-already there. Yet, Heidegger refuses the metaphysicality of the word "Being", and tries to keep it to the human realm by crossing it out. When Heidegger puts "Being" before all concepts, he is trying to put an end to a certain trend of Western philosophy that is obsessed about the origin, and by the same token, the end. Putting "Being" under erasure is an attempt by Heidegger to save his concept of "Being" from becoming the metaphysical origin and the eschatological end of all entities. Yet, by making "Dasein" or "Being" his master-word, his function-word, Heidegger, nonetheless, fails to do so. Heidegger's concept of "Dasein" is similar to the Structuralist concept of the 'signified'. To put it simply, in Structuralism, all signifiers are directly connected to an extra-linguistic signified, the invariable ones. To 'mean' anything, a signifier must presuppose a signified already-always outside it. This is what Derrida terms as the "transcendental signified": as a signified, it belongs to the realm of language, but by being invariable, and by refusing any movement, it remains outside it [A word, if immovable, can mean nothing, or even exist. Only when an endless chain of other [[Sign (linguistics)|signifiers]], other words, hints, get associated with it, it finally acquires meaning ('Camel' is understandable only when it is thinly associated with many related words, such as 'animal', 'desert', 'cigarette', 'long neck etc). In other words, language is this movement]. Dasein, by being under the erasure, claims to remain in the realm of physicality, but by being prior and anterior to any entity, and any thought, it remains outside them. In short, Heidegger's idea of "Dasein" fails to overcome the metaphysical trap. Derrida takes almost a similar strategy. But in his case, he puts the concept of "trace" under erasure. Trace, unlike "Dasein", is the absence of the presence, never itself the Master-word; it is the radically "other", it plays within a certain structure of difference. To Derrida, sign is the play of identity and difference; half of the sign is always "not there", and another half "not that" [We define everything negatively, a chair is 'not' a table, 'not' five-legged, one-legged, 'not' animate, 'not' of flesh. For detailed discussion, check [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]. The sign never leads to the extra-linguistic thing, it leads to another sign, one substituting the other playfully inside the structure of language. We do not feel the presence of a thing through a sign, but through the absence of other presences, we guess what it is. To Derrida, trace and not "being-there", difference and not-identity, create meaning inside language. This is the main difference between Heideggerian Dasein and Derridian trace.

In [[computer programming]], '''whitespace''' is any [[character (computing)|character]] or series of characters that represent horizontal or vertical [[space (punctuation)|space]] in [[typography]]. When rendered, a whitespace character does not correspond to a visible mark, but typically does occupy an area on a page. For example, the common whitespace symbol {{unichar|0020|SPACE|html=}}, also [[ASCII]] 32, represents a [[Space (punctuation)|blank space]] punctuation character in text, used as a [[word divider]] in Western [[writing system|script]]s.

== Overview ==
[[File:Punctuation-Spaces.svg|thumb|left|upright|Relative widths of various spaces in [[Unicode]]]]

With many keyboard layouts, a horizontal whitespace character may be entered through the use of a {{keypress|spacebar}}. Horizontal whitespace may also be entered on many keyboards through the use of the {{keypress|TAB}} key, although the length of the space may vary. Vertical whitespace is a bit more varied as to how it is encoded, but the most obvious in typing is the {{Keypress|Enter}} result which creates a 'newline' code sequence in applications programs. Older keyboards might instead say {{keypress|Return}}, abbreviating the typewriter keyboard meaning 'Carriage-Return' which generated an electromechanical return to the left stop (CR code in ASCII-[[Hexadecimal|hex]] &amp;amp;0D;) and a line feed or move to the next line (LF code in ASCII-hex &amp;amp;0A;); in some applications these were independently used to draw text cell based displays on monitors or for printing on tractor-guided printers&amp;mdash;which might also contain reverse motions/positioning code sequences allowing text-based output devices to achieve more sophisticated output. Many early computer games used such codes to draw a screen (e.g. [[Kingdom of Kroz]]), and word processing software would use this to produce printed effects such as bold, underline, and strikeout.

The term "whitespace" is based on the resulting appearance on ordinary [[paper]]. However they are coded inside an application, whitespace can be processed the same as any other character code and programs can do the proper action as defined for the context in which they occur.

== Definition and ambiguity ==
The most common whitespace characters may be typed via the [[space bar]] or the [[tab key]]. Depending on context, a line-break generated by the return or [[enter key]] may be considered whitespace as well.

===Unicode===
The table below lists the twenty-five characters defined as whitespace ("WSpace=Y", "WS") characters in the [[Unicode]] Character Database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unicode.org/versions/latest/|title=The Unicode Standard|publisher=Unicode Consortium}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seventeen use a definition of whitespace consistent with the algorithm for [[Unicode character property#Bidirectional writing|bidirectional writing]] ("Bidirectional Character Type=WS") and are known as "Bidi-WS" characters. The remaining characters may also be used, but are not of this "Bidi" type.

== Whitespace and digital typography ==

===On-screen display===
[[Text editors]], [[word processor]]s, and [[desktop publishing software]] differ in how they represent whitespace on the screen, and how they represent spaces at the ends of lines longer than the screen or column width. In some cases, spaces are shown simply as blank space; in other cases they may be represented by an [[interpunct]] or other symbols. Many different characters (described below) could be used to produce spaces, and non-character functions (such as margins and tab settings) can also affect whitespace.

===Variable-width general-purpose space===
In computer [[character encoding]]s, there is a normal '''general-purpose space''' (Unicode character U+0020) whose width will vary according to the design of the typeface. Typical values range from 1/5 em to 1/3 em (in digital typography an [[Em (typography)|em]] is equal to the nominal size of the font, so for a 10-point font the space will probably be between 2 and 3.3 points). Sophisticated fonts may have differently sized spaces for bold, italic, and small-caps faces, and often compositors will manually adjust the width of the space depending on the size and prominence of the text.

In addition to this general-purpose space, it is possible to encode a space of a specific width. See the table below for a complete list.

===Hair spaces around dashes===
[[Em dash]]es used as parenthetical dividers, and [[en dashes]] when used as word joiners, are usually set continuous with the text.&lt;ref&gt;Usage of the different dash types is illustrated, e.g., in ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]'', &amp;sect;&amp;sect; 6.80, 6.83–6.86&lt;/ref&gt; However, such a dash can optionally be surrounded with a '''hair space''', U+200A, or '''[[thin space]]''', U+2009. The hair space can be written in HTML by using the [[numeric character reference]]s &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#x200A;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#8202;&lt;/code&gt;, or the named entity &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;hairsp;&lt;/code&gt;, but is not universally supported in browsers yet, {{as of|lc=y|2016|post=.}}{{which|date=February 2018}} The [[thin space]] is named entity &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;thinsp;&lt;/code&gt; and numeric references &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#x2009;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#8201;&lt;/code&gt;. These spaces are much thinner than a normal space (except in a [[Monospaced font|monospaced (non-proportional) font]]), with the hair space being the thinner of the two.

===Formatting values of quantities===
The [[International System of Units|International System of Units (SI)]] prescribes inserting a space between a number and a [[unit of measurement]] and between units in compound units. A thin space should be used as thousands separator. See [[Space (punctuation)#Unit symbols and numbers|unit symbols and numbers]].

== Computing applications ==
===Programming languages===

In [[programming language]] syntax, spaces are frequently used to explicitly separate [[token (parser)|tokens]]. Runs of whitespace characters (beyond the first) occurring within [[source code]] written in computer [[programming language]]s (outside of strings and other quoted regions) are ignored by most languages; such languages are called ''[[free-form language|free-form]]''. In a few languages, including [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], [[occam (programming language)|occam]], [[ABC (programming language)|ABC]], and [[Python (programming language)|Python]], whitespace and indentation are used for syntactical purposes. In the satirical language called [[Whitespace (programming language)|Whitespace]], whitespace characters are the only valid characters for programming, while any other characters are ignored.

Still, for most programming languages, excessive use of whitespace, especially ''trailing whitespace'' at the end of lines, is considered a nuisance. However correct use of whitespace can make the code easier to read and help group related logic.

The [[C language]] defines whitespace characters to be "space, horizontal tab, new-line, vertical tab, and form-feed".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1548.pdf Section 6.4, paragraph 3&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] network protocol requires different types of whitespace to be used in different parts of the protocol, such as: only the space character in the [[HTTP status|status]] line, CRLF at the end of a line, and "linear whitespace" in header values.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation
| title=Hypertext Transfer Protocol—HTTP/1.1 | rfc=2616
| chapter=2.2 Basic Rules
| authors=R. Fielding
|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Command line user interfaces===
In commands processed by [[command processor]]s, e.g., in scripts and typed in, the space character can cause problems as it has two possible functions: as part of a command or parameter, or as a parameter or name [[Delimiter|separator]]. Ambiguity can be prevented either by prohibiting embedded spaces, or by enclosing a name with embedded spaces between quote characters.

===Markup languages===
Some markup languages, such as [[SGML]], preserve whitespace as written.

Web markup languages such as [[XML]] and [[HTML]] treat whitespace characters specially, including space characters, for programmers' convenience. One or more space characters read by conforming display-time processors of those [[markup language]]s are collapsed to 0 or 1 space, depending on their semantic context. For example, double (or more) spaces within text are collapsed to a single space, and spaces which appear on either side of the "&lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;" that separates an attribute name from its value have no effect on the interpretation of the document. Element end tags can contain trailing spaces, and empty-element tags in XML can contain spaces before the "&lt;code&gt;/&gt;&lt;/code&gt;". In these languages, unnecessary whitespace increases the file size, and so may slow network transfers. On the other hand, unnecessary whitespace can also inconspicuously mark code, similar to, but less obvious than comments in code. This can be desirable to prove an [[Copyright infringement|infringement]] of license or copyright that was committed by [[copying and pasting]].

In XML attribute values, sequences of whitespace characters are treated as a single space when the document is read by a parser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#AVNormalize |title=3.3.3 Attribute-Value Normalization |work=Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Fifth Edition) |publisher=World Wide Web Consortium}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whitespace in XML element content is not changed in this way by the parser, but an application receiving information from the parser may choose to apply similar rules to element content. An XML document author can use the &lt;code&gt;xml:space="preserve"&lt;/code&gt; attribute on an element to instruct the parser to discourage the downstream application from altering whitespace in that element's content.

In most [[HTML element]]s, a sequence of whitespace characters is treated as a single ''inter-word separator'', which may manifest as a single space character when rendering text in a language that normally inserts such space between words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/text.html#h-9.1 |title=9.1 Whitespace |work=W3CHTML 4.01 Specification |publisher=World Wide Web Consortium}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conforming HTML renderers are required to apply a more literal treatment of whitespace within a few prescribed elements, such as the &lt;code&gt;pre&lt;/code&gt; tag and any element for which [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] has been used to apply &lt;code&gt;pre&lt;/code&gt;-like whitespace processing. In such elements, space characters will not be "collapsed" into inter-word separators.

In both XML and HTML, the [[non-breaking space]] character, along with other non-"standard" spaces, is not treated as collapsible "whitespace", so it is not subject to the rules above.

===File names===
Such usage is similar to multiword file names written for operating systems and applications that are confused by embedded space codes&amp;mdash;such file names instead use an [[underscore]] (_) as a word separator, as_in_this_phrase.

Another such symbol was {{unichar|2422|Blank symbol}}. This was used in the early years of computer programming when writing on coding forms. Keypunch operators immediately recognized the symbol as an "explicit space".&lt;ref name="Mackenzie_1980"/&gt; It was used in [[BCDIC]],&lt;ref name="Mackenzie_1980"/&gt; [[EBCDIC]],&lt;ref name="Mackenzie_1980"/&gt; and [[ASCII-1963]].&lt;ref name="Mackenzie_1980"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5247">'''Williams Sassine''' (1944, [[Kankan]], [[Guinea]] – February 9, 1997, [[Conakry]], Guinea) was a [[Guinea]]n novelist who wrote in French. His father was [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] [[Christian]] and his mother was a Guinean of [[Muslim]] heritage.

Sassine was an expatriate African writer in France after leaving Guinea when it received independence under [[Sékou Touré]]. As a [[novelist]] he wrote of marginalized characters, but he became more optimistic on Touré's death. His 1979 novel ''Le jeune homme de sable'' has been regarded as among the best 20th-century African novels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nigeriavillagesquare1.com/BOOKS/africabest-fiction.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Few of his works have been translated into English, but ''Wirriyamu'' was published in an English translation in 1980. As an [[Editing|editor]] he remained critical of Touré as chief editor for the [[satire|satirical]] paper ''[[Le Lynx]]''.  Some of Sassine's works have been translated into English, Spanish and Russian.
