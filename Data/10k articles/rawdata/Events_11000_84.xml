The '''168 Film Project''' is a Christian film festival.

The contest starts with the random assignment of verses based on a theme from the [[Scripture#Christianity|scriptures]].  Writing and preproduction is the next phase, followed by exactly one week (168 hours) to shoot and edit a finished film.  If the film is on time and at or under the required total run time, then it is eligible for awards. Worldwide, over 750 short films have been produced for the competition from 2003 to 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/mar/01/local/la-me-beliefs1-2010mar01|title=A film festival for the faithful|last=Morris|first=Naomi|date=1 March 2010|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|accessdate=2 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the '''1986 Black Sea incident''' on 13 March the American [[cruiser]] {{USS|Yorktown|CG-48|6}} and the [[destroyer]] {{USS|Caron|DD-970|6}}, claiming the right of [[innocent passage]], entered the Soviet [[territorial waters]] near the southern [[Crimean Peninsula]]. The warships passed within six miles of the Soviet coast, where they were soon confronted by the Soviet [[frigate]] {{ship|Russian frigate|Ladny||2}}.&lt;ref name="Aceves1"&gt;{{harvnb|Aceves|p=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commander of ''Ladny'' notified the U.S. warships that they had violated Soviet territorial waters and requested that they depart immediately.&lt;ref name="Aceves1"/&gt; The U.S. warships confirmed receipt of the warning but did not change course.&lt;ref name="Aceves1"/&gt; The Soviet command placed its [[Black Sea]] air and naval forces on combat readiness and dispatched border guard vessels and naval aircraft to intercept the U.S. warships.&lt;ref name="Aceves1"/&gt;

''Yorktown'' and ''Caron'' stayed in Soviet territorial waters for roughly two hours.&lt;ref name="Aceves1"/&gt; The situation de-escalated when the U.S. ships left; diplomatic repercussions continued for several weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author =Rob McLaughlin | title =United Nations Naval Peace Operations in the Territorial Sea| publisher =Martinus Nijhoff Publishers | year = 2009| page = 121| isbn =9004174796}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
"The Rules of Navigation and Sojourn of Foreign Warships in the Territorial Waters and Internal Waters and Ports of the USSR", enacted by the [[Soviet Council of Ministers]] in 1983, acknowledged the right of innocent passage of foreign warships only in restricted areas of Soviet territorial waters in the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]], [[Sea of Okhotsk]] and the [[Sea of Japan]].&lt;ref name="Aceves2"&gt;{{harvnb|Aceves|p=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were no [[sea lanes]] for innocent passage in the Black Sea.&lt;ref name="Aceves2"/&gt; The United States, starting from 1979, conducted a [[freedom of navigation]] program as the U.S. government believed that many countries were beginning to assert jurisdictional boundaries that far exceeded traditional claims. The program was implemented because diplomatic protests seemed ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Aceves|p=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. actions in the Black Sea were challenged by the Soviet Union several times prior to the 1986 incident, particularly on 9 December 1968, August 1979 and on 18 February 1984.&lt;ref name="Aceves2"/&gt;

== Incident ==
On 10 March 1986, the {{sclass-|Ticonderoga|cruiser|2}} USS ''Yorktown'', accompanied by the {{sclass-|Spruance|destroyer|2}} USS ''Caron'', entered the Black Sea via the [[Turkish Straits]].&lt;ref name="Butler"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iilj.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Butler-Innocent-Passage-and-the-1982-Convention-1987.pdf|title=The Black Sea Affair |author=W.E. Butler|publisher =''[[American Journal of International Law]]''|date=April 1987|accessdate=7 Sep 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their entrance was observed by a {{sclass2-|Krivak|frigate|2}}, ''Ladny'', which was ordered to continue observation.&lt;ref name="Butler"/&gt; On 13 March ''Yorktown'' and ''Caron'' entered the Soviet [[territorial waters]] and sailed west along the southern [[Crimean Peninsula]], approaching within six miles of the coast.&lt;ref name="Butler"/&gt; Having entered from the direction of [[Feodosia]], the US warships sailed for two hours and 21 minutes.&lt;ref name="Butler"/&gt; Both American warships also confronted the Soviet border guard vessels ''Dozorny'' and ''Izmail''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://pogranichnik.ru/mchpv/korabli-mchpv/25-let-pskr-dozorniy.html|title=25 лет ПСКР "Дозорный"|publisher=Pogranichnik.ru|language=Russian|accessdate =27 Jan 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commander of ''Ladny'', Captain Zhuravlev, reported the incident to his superiors.&lt;ref name="Izvestiya"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://izvestia.ru/news/374013| script-title=ru:Морская эпопея "Известий" |publisher =''[[Izvestiya]]''|author=Вячеслав Лукашин|language=Russian| date=20 Apr 2012|accessdate =7 Sep 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[Izvestiya]]'' editor Vyacheslav Lukashin, at the time of the incident the Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Navy [[Vladimir Chernavin]] knew that the order for the U.S. warships to proceed into Soviet waters was given by the U.S. Secretary of Defense [[Caspar Weinberger]] with the consent of [[Ronald Reagan]].&lt;ref name="Izvestiya"/&gt;

== Aftermath ==

=== Soviet protest ===
The [[Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] held two press conferences concerning the incident.&lt;ref name="Butler"/&gt; The U.S. [[charge d'affaires]], Richard Combs, was summoned to the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs to receive the Soviet protest.&lt;ref name="Aceves1"/&gt; The Soviet Union stated that the U.S. violation of its territorial waters "was of a demonstrative, defiant nature and pursued clearly provocative aims".&lt;ref name="Aceves1"/&gt; [[Vladimir Chernavin]] affirmed that "the innocent passage of foreign warships through the territorial waters of the USSR is permitted only in specially authorized coastal areas which have been announced by the Soviet government [and] there are no such areas in the Black Sea off the coast of the Soviet Union".&lt;ref name="Aceves1"/&gt;

=== U.S. stance ===
Replying to the Soviet [[note verbale]] about the incident, the U.S. stated that "the transit of the USS ''Yorktown'' and USS ''Caron'' through the claimed Soviet territorial sea on March 13, 1986, was a proper exercise of the right of [[innocent passage]], which [[international law]], both [[Customary international law|customary]] and conventional, has long accorded ships of all states".&lt;ref name="EMC"&gt;{{cite book | author =J. Ashley Roach | author2 =Robert W. Smith | title =Excessive Maritime Claims | edition =Third| publisher =Martinus Nijhoff Publishers | year =2012 | page =234 | isbn =9004217738}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[U.S. Department of State]]'s instructions to the American embassy in the Soviet Union noted the U.S. "would not want to lend any validity to a Soviet position that their domestic law was at all relevant in determining U.S. navigational rights under international law".&lt;ref name="EMC"/&gt; An article in the ''[[American Journal of International Law]]'' argued in 1987 that "the course of the American warships indicated on a map published in Izvestiia confirms that the passage of the vessels was a lateral one" and that "at no time did they take a course that could be construed as expressing an intention to enter the [[internal waters]] or ports of the USSR".&lt;ref name="Butler"/&gt;

In the subsequent [[1988 Black Sea bumping incident|incident of 1988]], the same USS ''Yorktown'' and USS ''Caron'', while claiming innocent passage again in the Black Sea, were bumped by the Soviet vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://articles.philly.com/1988-02-13/news/26243991_1_soviet-ships-soviet-coast-soviet-protest| title =Soviet, U.S. Ships Bump In Black Sea |publisher =[[Philadelphia Media Network]]| author=Mark Thompson|date=13 Feb 1988|accessdate =6 Sep 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''2004–05 NHL season''' was the [[National Hockey League]]'s [[List of NHL seasons|88th]] season of operation. The entire 1,230-game schedule, that was set to begin in October, was officially canceled on February 16, 2005 due to an unresolved [[lockout (industry)|lockout]] that began on September 16, 2004. The [[2004–05 NHL lockout|loss of the 2004–05 season]]'s games made the NHL the first North America professional sports league to lose an entire season of games because of a [[Labor relations|labor]] dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=1992793 | title=Lockout over salary cap shuts down NHL | agency=Associated Press | date=February 16, 2005 | accessdate=August 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time since [[1918–19 NHL season|1919]], when a [[Spanish flu]] pandemic canceled the playoffs, that the [[Stanley Cup]] was not awarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2005/SPORT/02/16/nhl.season/ | title=NHL cancel remainder of the season |publisher=CNN | date=February 16, 2005 | accessdate=August 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This canceled season was later acknowledged with the words "2004–05 Season Not Played" engraved on the Cup.&lt;ref name="2004–05Recognized"&gt;{{cite web|title=Strike Up The Bands: The Stanley Cup is Stripped of a Ring; Cancelled 2004–05 Season Recognized |url=http://www.hhof.com/html/newsSCbands.shtml |publisher=[[Hockey Hall of Fame]] |accessdate=February 19, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820015012/http://www.hhof.com/html/newsSCbands.shtml |archivedate=August 20, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]], 388 NHL players were on teams overseas at some point during the season, spread across 19 European leagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iihf.com/news/iihfpr8704.htm | title=Lockout list ends at 388 NHL players in Europe as of February 25 | publisher=[[International Ice Hockey Federation|IIHF]] | date=February 25, 2005 | accessdate=August 15, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070808230401/http://www.iihf.com/news/iihfpr8704.htm  |archivedate = August 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these players had a contract clause to return to the NHL when the league started up again, even if it was during the current season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2004/10/13/MNGGR98QV81.DTL&amp;type=printable | title=Lots of talking, little listening |work=San Francisco Chronicle | last=McKeon | first=Ross | page=A-16 | date=October 13, 2004 | accessdate=August 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Key rule changes which would dominate after the lockout were established as a result of a meeting between the NHL and its top minor league, the [[American Hockey League]]. On July 5, 2004, the AHL announced publicly the 2004–05 rule changes, many of which were passed as a result of the NHL's recommendation for experimentation.

== Stanley Cup controversy ==
As a result of the lockout, no Stanley Cup champion was crowned for the first time since the flu pandemic in [[1918–19 NHL season|1919]]. This was controversial among many fans, who questioned whether the NHL had exclusive control over the Cup. A website known as freestanley.com (since closed) was launched, asking fans to write to the Cup trustees and urge them to return to the original pre-NHL Challenge Cup format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=115156&amp;hubname= | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929162525/http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=115156&amp;hubname= | archivedate=September 29, 2007 | title=Lockout Reminds Lowe of Gretzky Deal | publisher=[[The Sports Network|TSN]] | date=February 16, 2005 | accessdate=July 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adrienne Clarkson]], then Governor General of Canada, alternately proposed that the Cup be presented to the top women's hockey team in lieu of the NHL season, but this idea was so unpopular with NHL fans, players, and officials that the [[Clarkson Cup]] was created instead. Meanwhile, a group in Ontario, also known as the "Wednesday Nighters", filed an application with the Ontario Superior Court, claiming that the Cup trustees had overstepped their bounds in signing the 1947 agreement with the NHL, and therefore must award the trophy to any team willing to play for the cup regardless of the lockout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=2036537|title=Amateurs taking NHL to court to play for Cup|publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=October 13, 2007|date=April 13, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 7, 2006, a settlement was reached in which the trophy could be awarded to non-NHL teams in the event the league does not operate for a season, but the dispute lasted so long that, by the time it was settled, the NHL had resumed operating for the [[2005–06 NHL season|2005–06 season]], and the Stanley Cup went unclaimed for the 2004–05 season.&lt;ref name="Non-NHL teams"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=153935&amp;hubname= | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071216083200/http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=153935&amp;hubname= | archivedate=December 16, 2007 | title=Court:Non-NHL teams could vie for Cup|publisher=[[The Sports Network|TSN]] | date=February 7, 2006 | accessdate=July 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''2017 Brussels Summit''' of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) was the 28th [[NATO summit|formal meeting]] of the [[heads of state]] and [[heads of government]] of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]], held in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]], on 25 May 2017.

==Agenda==
There had been multiple competing agendas leading up to the summit, with [[Southern Europe]]an members concerned with security in [[North Africa]] and the [[Middle East]] and the [[European migrant crisis]] and [[Eastern Europe]]an members concerned more about [[Russia]]′s policies. There was also concern about the [[Russia–Turkey relations]]hip. [[Donald Trump]], the [[President of the United States]], urged the NATO members to meet the 2014 agreement to seek to spend at least two percent of their [[gross domestic product]] on defense.&lt;ref name="Star"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Joanna|title=Justin Trudeau heads to Europe for NATO and G7 summits, where Trump's 'fireworks' remain an expectation|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2017/05/22/justin-trudeau-heads-to-europe-for-nato-and-g7-summits-where-trumps-fireworks-remain-an-expectation.html|publisher=[[Toronto Star|The Star]]|accessdate=23 May 2017|location=Ottawa|date=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to at least one senior [[White House]] official, Donald Trump had expressed interest in inviting Russia to the [[43rd G7 summit|G7 summit]] and was considering leaving the NATO alliance.&lt;ref name="France24"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crowther|first1=Philip|title=Trump threatens to quit NATO: White House official|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20170518-white-house-official-trump-threatens-leave-nato-usa-g7-russia|publisher=[[France 24]]|accessdate=23 May 2017|date=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/25/trump-demands-europe-pay-toward-nato-excoriating-speech-brussels/|title=Trump demands Europe pay more toward Nato in excoriating speech at Brussels summit|date=25 May 2017|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the opening ceremony of the new NATO headquarters building, President Trump gave a speech which did not mention Article 5 of the [[North Atlantic Treaty]], surprising [[H. R. McMaster]], the [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]], [[James Mattis]], the [[United States Secretary of Defense]], and [[Rex Tillerson]], the [[United States Secretary of State]], who had approved a different speech that explicitly included the [[collective security]] commitment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Glasser|first1=Susan B.|authorlink=Susan B.

==Accomplishments==
NATO was set to become a full member of the Global Coalition, alongside NATO pledging to increase its support to the Coalition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NATO to be full member of global coalition against IS: Chief

The Alliance leaders agreed to submit national action plans by December, which were to set out how members intend to meet the pledge to spend at least two percent of their GDP on defense by 2024.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NATO nations agree to submit action plans|url=http://www.kalb.com/content/news/NATO-nations-agree-to-submit-action-plans-424428774.html|publisher=KALB|date=25 May 2017|accessdate=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Montenegro]], represented by the prime minister [[Duško Marković]], joined the meeting, days before it was to officially become a member of the organization on 5 June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Montenegro to join NATO on June 5|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/region.php?yyyy=2017&amp;mm=05&amp;dd=25&amp;nav_id=101370|publisher=B92|date=25 May 2017|accessdate=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility of NATO membership was said to remain open to other states.

==Aftermath==
A few days after, also following a [[43rd G7 summit|G7 meeting]], German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] told a crowd in a [[Bavaria]]n beer hall that "we Europeans must really take our fate into our own hands – of course in friendship with the United States of America, in friendship with Great Britain and as good neighbors wherever that is possible also with other countries, even with [[Russia]]. But we have to know that we must fight for our future on our own, for our destiny as Europeans."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-politics-merkel-idUSKBN18O0JK After summits with Trump, Merkel says Europe must take fate into own hands] [[Reuters]], 29 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/05/28/thanks-to-trump-germany-says-it-cant-rely-on-america-what-does-that-mean/|title=Thanks to Trump, Germany says it can't rely on the United States.

==Future summits==
The next major summit (29th) was to take place in [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]] in 2018. However, Germany, France, the Netherlands and Denmark have reportedly led a drive to block it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Germany seeks to block NATO summit in Turkey: report|url=http://www.dw.com/en/germany-seeks-to-block-nato-summit-in-turkey-report/a-39057780|accessdate=9 June 2017|work=DW|date=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 Oct. 2017 the NATO Secretary General announces that the 29th summit would be on 11 and 12 July 2018 in Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= NATO Secretary General announces dates for 2018 Brussels Summit  |url=https://www.nato.int/cps/ic/natohq/news_147856.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

__NOTOC__
Year '''463 BC''' was a year of the [[Roman calendar|pre-Julian Roman calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Priscus and Helva''' (or, less frequently, '''year 291 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 463 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

=== By place ===
==== Rome ====
* The Senate and People of Rome appoint Gaius Aemilius Mamercus interrex.
==== Greece ====
* In [[Athens]], the democratic statesman [[Ephialtes]] and the young [[Pericles]] attempt to get the oligarchic [[Kimon]] [[ostracized]] for allegedly receiving bribes. Kimon is charged by Pericles and other democratic politicians with having been bribed not to attack the King of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] (who may have been suspected of covertly helping the Thasian rebels). Though Kimon is acquitted, his influence on the Athenian people is waning.
* [[Themistocles]], who is in exile, approaches the Persian King [[Artaxerxes I]] seeking [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] help in regaining power in Athens. Artaxerxes is unwilling to help him, but instead gives him the [[satrapy]] of [[Magnesia Prefecture|Magnesia]].
* After a two year siege, [[Thasos]] falls to the Athenians under Kimon who compels the Thasians to destroy their walls, surrender their ships, pay an indemnity and an annual contribution to Athens.

The '''Australian Festival of Chamber Music''' (AFCM) is a nine-day international festival focused on [[chamber music]] held in [[Townsville]], North Queensland commencing on the last Friday in July. The AfCM also incorporates a Winterschool for emerging artists.&lt;ref name=Profile&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afcm.com.au/about.shtml |title=AFCM Official Webpage – About the Festival – Festival Profile |accessdate=10 January 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820184129/http://www.afcm.com.au/about.shtml |archivedate=20 August 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 20 to 30 chamber musicians from around Australia and the world converge on Townsville, each year to perform and teach emerging artists.

The festival was founded in July 1991 and has been held annually ever since.&lt;ref name="Profile" /&gt; In 2015 it celebrated its 25th anniversary. It is the largest festival dedicated to chamber music in the southern hemisphere.&lt;ref name="team"&gt;"Dynamic team gears up". ''[[Townsville Bulletin]]'' "The Guide". Published 20 November 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;24&lt;/ref&gt;

The AFCM is presented in partnership with all three levels of government as well as several commercial, tourism, regional development, and educational, organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afcm.com.au/partners.shtml |title=AFCM Official Webpage – Support the Festival – Partners |accessdate=10 January 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070107211636/http://www.afcm.com.au/partners.shtml |archivedate=7 January 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival's [[Patronage|patron]] is [[Paul de Jersey]], [[Governor of Queensland]].

==History==
The festival was founded in 1990 for a 1991 premiere by Professor Ray Golding, the then Vice-Chancellor of [[James Cook University]] and [[Theodore Kuchar]] who continued as the artistic director for the next 16 years until 2006. The festival began conservatively focusing on the more contemporary music of the [[Classical period (music)|classical]] and [[Romanticism|romantic periods]], over the first five years Kuchar started inserting works of [[Béla Bartók|Bartok]], [[Ernest Bloch|Bloch]], [[Bohuslav Martinů|Martinu]], [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich]], expanding the musical depth for enthusiasts while maintaining the popular appeal.&lt;ref name="directions"&gt;Matthew Westwood: "MATP Festival to tackle new directions". ''[[The Australian]]'' Features, Published 4 July 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;14&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival has tried to avoid a perception that it is only there for cultivated southerners, for example in 2005 for the first time the AFCM had a presence at a [[North Queensland Cowboys|Cowboys]] football match and in 2006 increased publicity focusing locally.&lt;ref name=directions /&gt;

In 2007 the AFCM gained a new Artistic Director in [[Piers Lane]] AO. Lane, an Australian, is a leading international pianist who is based in London;&lt;ref&gt;Isis Stuckenschmidt 'New AFCM director cases the joint. [[Townsville Bulletin]], Published 28 October 2006 p.&amp;nbsp;5&lt;/ref&gt; The 2007 programme involved vocalists and more variety than previous years to appeal to a broader audience, taking a "lifestyle approach" and focussing on music, wine and food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Minikas |first=Lisa |url=http://www.citylifemagazine.com.au/Townsville/online_magazines/07mar/online.html |title=David Pratt To Hollywood &amp; Back |publisher=[[Media in Townsville|City Life]] |date=March 2007 |page=17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829041647/http://www.citylifemagazine.com.au/Townsville/online_magazines/07mar/online.html |archivedate=29 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Audience==
At the 2006 festival about 10,000 tickets were issued with five concerts sold out,&lt;ref&gt;Townsville Sun Australian Festival of Chamber Music roundup. Published 12 July 2006, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; outperforming all previous years and 2005 by 20%; it had pre-sold 1200 tickets for one concert alone (Symphony Under the Stars at Queens Gardens)&lt;ref&gt;Leonie Johnson: "Music lovers in tune with festival". ''[[Townsville Bulletin]]'', Published 10 July 2006 p.&amp;nbsp;7&lt;/ref&gt; and had an average audience size of about 750 people. About 50% of audience numbers were from interstate or international guests to Townsville.&lt;ref&gt;Isis Stuckenschmidt: "Festival set to end on right note". ''[[Townsville Bulletin]]'', Published 8 July 2006 p.&amp;nbsp;13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Winterschool==
During the festival master classes are held for around 30 music students attending the Winterschool by the artists who also have a full schedule of performances.

== Day off activities ==
Each year the Festival has a "day-off" during which festival patrons have an opportunity to hear chamber music but in more unusual settings.

=== Orpheus Island Cruise ===
The Orpheus Island Cruise has been one of the highlights for festival patrons. En-oute to Orpheus Island, whales have been often cited in the waters around the Palm Island group. Upon llanding,patrons had the opportunity to enjoy the secluded beach and adjacent national park before settling down for a short performance from festival artists. The tour first took place in 2013 and was repeated in 2016.

==Outback Tour==
From 2002 to 2010, the Outback Tour brought some of the best music in the world to some of the most isolated places in the world. In 2006 enthusiastic music lovers, join six musicians (including [[didgeridoo]] player [[William Barton (musician)|William Barton]]) in a five-day tour of [[Regions of Queensland#North West|Outback Australia]], visiting [[Cloncurry, Queensland|Cloncurry]], Ernest Henry Mine, [[Mount Isa]], [[Normanton, Queensland|Normanton]] and [[Karumba, Queensland|Karumba]] focusing on fine food and music and masterclasses with hands on experience of the Queensland mining industry and communities.

'''Bachelor and Spinsters  Balls (B&amp;S)''' events are hosted regularly in [[rural]] [[Australia]], known locally as "''B &amp; S Balls''" or simply "''B&amp;S's''".

They are staged for young (18 years and over) [[spinster]]s and [[bachelor]]s and traditionally the couples dress up in formal wear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=BACHELOR AND SPINSTER'S BALL BRINGS RURAL AUSSIES TOGETHER,  YOUNG MEN IN TUXES, TRUCKS LOOK FOR PRECIOUS FEW COUNTRY WOMEN |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AK&amp;s_site=ohio&amp;p_multi=AK&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0F62BCDF94EA1E40&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |work=[[Akron Beacon Journal]] |date=19 September 2002 |accessdate=2008-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Large volumes of cheap [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] such as beer, spirits, [[Bundaberg Rum]] and [[Jim Beam]] can be consumed. The activities usually start at night and run until morning, but from mid-afternoon people will start to arrive and the partying/drinking will begin. [[Country music]] is often featured at these events.

Historically the event was centered on country people trying to find a partner, but in modern times the focus has shifted to having a good time and meeting up with new and old friends, some of whom can live many hours away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Having a ball! |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/having-a-ball/2005/08/02/1122748636541.html |work=[[The Age]] |date=3 August 2005 |accessdate=2008-11-19 | location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has changed the atmosphere of the events to such a degree that the dress code is relaxed and many do not wear formal gear, preferring to dress in clothes from [[opportunity shop]]s. Even when they are wearing formal attire, today most of the men (and some of the women) sport [[Akubras]], [[boots]] and [[R. M. Williams]] gear. Some people go in fancy dress, for example, school girls, nurses, clowns or lawn bowlers.

It is not unusual for the modern B&amp;S's to be run by [[Pickup truck#The Australian ute|ute]] enthusiasts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Looking For Love, Outback Style; Young Aussies Find Partners At B&amp;S Dance |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/190125981.html?dids=190125981:190125981&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=SEP+22%2C+2002&amp;author=Emma+Tinkler&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post&amp;desc=Looking+For+Love%2C+Outback+Style%3B+Young+Aussies+Find+Partners+At+B%26S+Dance&amp;pqatl=google |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=22 September 2002 |accessdate=2008-11-19 | first=Emma | last=Tinkler}}&lt;/ref&gt; following minor [[Ute Muster]]s. Ute drivers at the B&amp;S Balls sometimes perform stunts, such as driving their utes at dusk and throw flames from the exhausts and do [[Doughnut (driving)|circle work]]. Circle work, usually banned, is where the utes are driven in tighter and tighter circles. [[Food dye]] is a regular sight at a B&amp;S and is normally thrown on people (even when it is banned). A B&amp;S Virgin (a person who is attending for the first time) is often marked with the word "Virgin".

After the event people usually sleep in their [[swag (bedroll)|swag]] on the back of their ute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Australian Woman's Survival Guide |last=Balwyn |first=Mia |year=2007 |publisher=Murdoch Books |isbn=978-1-921259-96-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6zj50XXo9RIC&amp;pg=PA135&amp;dq=%22Bachelor+and+Spinster+Ball%22+ |accessdate=2008-11-19 |page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually the committee supplies something for dinner and breakfast the next day. Some committees run a 'recovery' where the ball goers move to a different location to continue drinking, having fun and sometimes participating in competitions.

Tickets can cost anything from [[Australian dollar|AU$]]80 to AU$110 and usually include all you can drink, dinner and sometimes breakfast as well as little gifts such as ear tags, hats, stickers and sometimes [[condom]]s and [[lubricant]]. People will travel many kilometres to attend the balls, and the profits made from them go to charities and organizations such as the [[Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia]], [[Red Cross]] and the [[Australian Cancer Council]], as well as local charities of the specific area.

Today the future of B&amp;S balls are in jeopardy as rising insurance costs take their toll and more young people from country areas move to cities. However thousands of people make the effort to drive for many hours to support something that they love and wish to continue for future generations. There are many websites dedicated to the future of balls.

In 2009 as part of the [[Q150]] celebrations, the Bachelor and Spinster Balls were announced as one of the [[Q150 Icons]] of Queensland for its role as an "event and festival".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://statements.qld.gov.au/statement/id/64301|title=PREMIER UNVEILS QUEENSLAND’S 150 ICONS|last=Bligh|first=Anna|authorlink=Anna Bligh|date=10 June 2009|website=|publisher=[[Queensland Government]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170524033717/http://statements.qld.gov.au/statement/id/64301|archive-date=24 May 2017|dead-url=|access-date=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Campaignbox Crusades Battles}}
In the '''Battle of Azaz''' forces of the [[Crusader States]] commanded by King [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem]] defeated Aq-Sunqur il-Bursuqi's army of [[Seljuk Turks]] on 11 June 1125 and raised the [[siege]] of the [[town]]. (One authority says the battle was fought on June 13.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smail|1995|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

==Background==
[[Joscelin I of Edessa]] had captured [[Azaz]] in northern [[Syria]] from the [[atabeg]] of [[Halab|Aleppo]] in 1118. The next year the [[Crusade]]rs under [[Roger of Salerno]] were severely defeated at the [[Battle of Ager Sanguinis]], and King [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem]] was captured while patrolling in [[County of Edessa|Edessa]] in 1123.

==Prelude==
In 1124 Baldwin II was released, and almost immediately he laid [[siege]] to [[Aleppo]] on October 8, 1124. This caught the attention of il-Bursuqi, the Seljuk atabeg of [[Mosul]]. Il-Bursuqi marched south to relieve the siege of Aleppo, which was nearing the point of surrender in January 1125 after a three-month siege. In spite of the city being "the greatest prize the war could offer",&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smail|1995|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baldwin cautiously withdrew without a fight.

==Battle==
Later, il-Bursuqi (who had received troops also by [[Toghtekin]] of Damascus) besieged the town of Azaz, to the north of Aleppo, in territory belonging to the [[County of Edessa]].{{sfn|Ibn al-Athir|2010|p=258}} Baldwin II, [[Leo I, Prince of Armenia|Leo I]] of [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Armenia]], Joscelin I, and [[Pons of Tripoli|Pons]] of [[County of Tripoli|Tripoli]], with a force of 1,100 [[knight]]s from their respective territories (including knights from [[Principality of Antioch|Antioch]], where Baldwin was regent), as well as 2,000 [[infantry]], met il-Bursuqi outside Azaz, where the Seljuk atabeg had gathered his much larger force.{{sfn|Verbruggen|1997|p=6}}{{sfn|Ibn al-Athir|2010|p=258}} Baldwin [[feigned retreat|pretended to retreat]], thereby drawing the Seljuks away from Azaz into the open where they were surrounded. After a long and bloody battle, the Seljuks were defeated and their camp captured by Baldwin, who took enough [[looting|loot]] to [[ransom]] the prisoners taken by the Seljuks (including the future [[Joscelin II of Edessa]]).{{sfn|Ibn al-Athir|2010|p=258}}

==Aftermath==
Al Bursuqi retired to Aleppo, leaving his son Masud as governor and crossed the [[Euphrates]] to [[Mosul]], where he gathered troops to renew the fight.{{sfn|Ibn al-Athir|2010|p=258}} Apart from relieving Azaz, this victory allowed the Crusaders to regain much of the influence they had lost after their defeat at Ager Sanguinis in 1119. Baldwin planned to attack Aleppo as well, but Antioch, which passed to [[Bohemund II of Antioch|Bohemund II]] when he came of age in 1126, began to fight with Edessa and the plan fell through. Aleppo and Mosul were united under the much stronger ruler [[Imad ad-Din Zengi|Zengi]] in 1128, and Crusader control of northern Syria began to dwindle.

===Casualties===
The number of Muslim troops killed was more than 1,000, according to [[Ibn al-Athir]].{{sfn|Ibn al-Athir|2010|p=258}} [[William of Tyre]] gave 24 dead for the Crusaders and 2,000 for the Muslims. [[Fulcher of Chartres]] suggested 5 [[emir]]s and 2,000 soldiers dead, while [[Matthew of Edessa]] estimated 15 emirs and 5,000 troops killed.

The '''Bugojno group''' ({{Lang-hr|Bugojanska skupina}}) was the name of a [[Croat]]ian paramilitary formation which was infiltrated into [[Yugoslavia]] on June 20, 1972 to raise a rebellion against the socialist Yugoslav government.

== Background ==
The Bugojno group was organized by the [[Croatian Revolutionary Brotherhood]] (''Hrvatsko revolucionarno bratstvo'' or HRB). The HRB was formed in [[Australia]] in 1961 and was active in [[Europe]] and the [[United States]]. The founding principle of the HRB was the separation of Croatia from Yugoslavia, and the reestablishment of the [[Independent State of Croatia]] through violence.

== Operation Phoenix ==
After the suppression of the [[Croatian Spring]] movement in 1971, the HRB believed that there existed in Croatia a political climate which would support the beginning of an armed rebellion. After short preparations, the HRB organized their personnel, weapons and funding to support an initial group to start a rebellion. Most of the fighters and money came from [[Australia]] while the armed training was done in [[West Germany]]. After a short preparation in [[Austria]], the 19-member group traveled through [[Dravograd]] into Yugoslavia by truck (the driver of which later reported them to police), on June 20, 1972. The [[Territorial Defense (Yugoslavia)|Yugoslav territorial defense]] units soon began a massive search to find them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The insurgents were armed with [[M16 rifle|M-16]] and [[Heckler &amp; Koch G3|HK G-3]] rifles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cimmerians.org/home/next-operation/completed-operations/op-FRONTIER-CYCLONE|title=op FRONTIER CYCLONE 18aug12 - Cimmerians Airsoft Association|website=www.cimmerians.org|access-date=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group was named after the Bosnian town of [[Bugojno]], as their goal was to reach the mountain of [[Raduša (mountain)|Raduša]] south of the town. The operation was called "Phoenix" by the Croatian militants, while the [[Counter-insurgency|counterinsurgency]] operation carried out by the Yugoslav forces bore the codename "Raduša 72".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.balcanicaucaso.org/aree/Bosnia-Erzegovina/Arrivederci-al-lago-di-Rama-173693|title=Arrivederci al lago di Rama|last=Caucaso|first=Osservatorio Balcani e|work=Osservatorio Balcani e Caucaso|access-date=2017-10-27|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Main actions ===
The Yugoslav Army had no [[special forces]] at its disposal, and relied exclusively on some 30,000 poorly trained [[Conscription|conscript soldiers]] and reservists units for the search.&lt;ref name="JL"/&gt; The first clash with the security forces took place on June 25 at the edge of a wood near [[Gornji Vakuf-Uskoplje|Uskoplje]] (Gornji Vakuf). The group successfully drove back a team of 30 Yugoslav troops and policemen, killing the officer in charge, captain Miloš Popović, and a soldier. Two other soldiers were wounded. The group, however, fled in disarray as their own commander, Adolf Andrić, was also killed in the action. Three other members were caught over the next 24 hours. Although forced to hide, the insurgents managed to regroup near [[Rama Lake (Bosnia and Herzegovina)|Ramsko Lake]]. Cornered once more by 1,000 territorial defense soldiers, the rebels were dispersed and compelled to seek shelter among the civilian population. During the withdrawal, one unit of the territorial defense was ambushed by the militants in a forest clearing near their hideout, a cave in the surroundings of Rumboci, a village on the northern shores of Ramsko Lake, in the region of Bukovac. Nine Yugoslav soldiers were killed, one of them after being captured. The paramilitaries headed for [[Sinj]] and [[Imotski]], in Croatia, where they became decimated in a series of ambushes and counter-ambushes with Yugoslav forces.&lt;ref name="JL"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thebosniatimes.ba/clanak/6503|title=SUKOB SA USTAŠKIM TERORISTIMA NA RADUŠI  (III) Posljednja Vejsilova želja prije strijeljanja bila je da se napije vode ispred Begove džamije|last=Times|first=The Bosnia|website=thebosniatimes.ba|language=en|access-date=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of an informer the Bugojno group was eventually apprehended by July 24.

== Aftermath ==
The Yugoslav losses were 13 killed in action and 14 wounded. Of the 19 members of the group, 15 were killed, 10 in action, whilst 5 were summarily executed after having surrendered. The last four members of the group were captured, tried and sentenced on December 21, 1972. Ludvig Pavlović, who was a minor, was sentenced to 20 years in prison, and the remaining three were executed by firing squad on March 17, 1973, at the Police headquarters in [[Sarajevo]].&lt;ref name="JL"/&gt;  Pavlović was released from prison in 1990 and was killed in controversial circumstances during the [[Yugoslav Wars]] on September 18, 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hercegovina.info/vijesti/vijesti/sjecanje-na-covjeka-koji-je-sanjao-o-slobodnoj-hrvatskoj-drzavi|title=Sjećanje na čovjeka koji je sanjao o slobodnoj hrvatskoj državi|website=www.hercegovina.info|language=hr-HR|access-date=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christmas in August''' (formerly known as "Savage Christmas") is an annual tradition in [[Yellowstone National Park]].  The celebration includes decorating Christmas trees, singing Christmas carols, and gift exchanges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yellowstone.net/125th.htm|title=Yellowstone: 125 Anniversary|accessdate=Apr 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
According to the local legend, in the early part of the 20th century a freak blizzard stranded visitors and their stagecoach at the [[Old Faithful Inn]].  Rather than lament the fact that they were snowbound in a hotel, the guests decided to celebrate Christmas, since it looked like Christmas outside.  Some stories place this blizzard as happening "shortly after the turn of the [20th] century"&lt;ref name = "savage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/upload/YS9%283%29.pdf|title=Savage Christmas: "...the best of times"|work= Yellowstone Science: A quarterly publication devoted to the natural and cultural resources Volume 9 Issue 3|last=Quinn|first=Leslie|date = Summer 2001|accessdate = April 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others specify the blizzard occurred in 1939&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/weather/climate/usa/parks/wyellows.htm|title=Yellowstone National Park|work=USAToday|date= Aug 23, 1999|accessdate=Apr 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some place it in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalparkstraveler.com/2008/12/national-park-system-quiz-34-christmas-parks|title=National Park System Quiz 34: Christmas in the Parks|work=National Parks Traveler|accessdate= Apr 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some stories date the blizzard to the 19th century, prior to the creation of the Old Faithful Inn.&lt;ref name = "savage" /&gt;  There is no historical record recording that a blizzard ever hit Yellowstone on or around August 25 of any given year.  In fact, between 1904 and 1941, the most snow that Yellowstone received on any given day in August was 1.8&amp;nbsp;inches on August 18, 1932.&lt;ref name = "savage" /&gt; Interviews with older employees indicate that the celebration was not held prior to the 1930s.&lt;ref name = "savage" /&gt;

==Historical origin==
While the actual origins to the Christmas in August story are unknown, Yellowstone's Information Specialist Leslie Quinn speculates that the origins are based upon three factors.  First, during the 1930s the celebration of [[Christmas in July]] was a popular celebration in the Rocky Mountains.  Second, August 25th is the anniversary of the National Park Service.  Third, there was an existing celebration in the park known as "Savage Days."&lt;ref name = "savage" /&gt;  Quinn discovered a 1966 article published by the Park's Recreation department titled, ""Christmas Comes Twice a Year—Once At Home and Once Up Here."  In the article, Gene "Mr. Yellowstone Music" Quaw, indicated that there was no Christmas in August celebration while he worked in Yellowstone during the 1920s and 1930s.  According to Quaw, there was a small Christmas in July celebration and that the employees would have an employee-only celebration called "Savage Days" wherein a park employee would dress as Santa Claus.

===Savage Days===
In 1977, park historian Aubrey L. Haines, indicated that the earliest reference in the 1947 employee handbooks was an indication that read "[[Old Faithful|O. F.]] Savages held annual celebration, 7/25."  According to the August 1, 1947 issue of ''Yellowstone's Weekly News'' the July 25th celebration had nothing to do with Christmas.  "The 'savages' (concessionaire employees) at Old Faithful held a gala affair on July 25 known as "Savage Day." Several floats were entered in the long parade up the main street at Old Faithful. The day concluded with a large masquerade ball in the evening."  Haines indicates that he remembered the celebrations going back to 1939 when he worked at Old Faithful as an Assistant District Ranger, but that nobody paid the employee-only celebration much attention.&lt;ref name = "savage" /&gt;

By 1953, however, the annual celebration known as "savage days" had become a parkwide celebration and had attracted the attention of the park concessioners and National Park Service as it interfered with service quality.&lt;ref name = "savage" /&gt;

===Savage Christmas===
1953 was the last year "Savage Days" were celebrated in Yellowstone National Park.  Starting in 1954, the park concessionaires made a concerted effort to merge Savage Days with the smaller "Christmas in July" celebration.  Trevor Povah, the head of Hamilton Stores, one of the park concessioners claims that the park concessioners deliberately created the story of a blizzard at the Old Faithful Inn to obfuscate the origins of a new celebration called "Savage Christmas."&lt;ref name = "savage" /&gt;  In 1955, the first publications came out mentioning "Savage Christmas."&lt;ref name = "savage" /&gt; From 1954–59, the celebration was held either on July 25 or August 25, but by 1959 August 25 became the permanent date.&lt;ref name = "savage" /&gt;  Quinn speculates that there were two reasons why the August 25th date prevailed over the July 25th one.  First, the tourist season in Yellowstone starts in May and ends at the end of August, by celebrating Christmas on August 25th, it became an end of the tourist season celebration.  Second, [[Warren Ost]], a bellhop at the Old Faithful Inn and founder of [[A Christian Ministry in the National Parks]] (ACMNP), had started a choir.  The choir held its first celebration on August 7, 1949.  Within two years, ACMNP was forming choirs at the Old Faithful, Mammoth Hot Springs, and Lake areas of the park with the intention of performing [[George Frideric Handel|Handel's]] [[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah.]]  Quinn reasons that having the Messiah, which was an annual tradition from the early 1950s through the 1990s, coincide with the Christmas celebration would have been a logical step.  "But with only a short season in which to prepare, an August date for the concert
would have been more reasonable, and this may have been a factor in the July-to- August switch."&lt;ref name = "savage" /&gt;  Delmar J. Sicard, III, the author who wrote the article "Christmas Comes Twice A Year—Once At Home And Once Up Here" noted that the Christmas celebrations "began to take on a more serious and formal aspect" with the arrival of ACMNP serminarians.&lt;ref name = "savage" /&gt;

The '''Congo Crisis''' ({{lang-fr|Crise congolaise}}) was a period of [[Crisis|political upheaval]] and [[war|conflict]] in the [[Republic of the Congo (Léopoldville)|Republic of the Congo]] (today the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]){{efn|Not to be confused with the neighbouring state known as the [[Republic of the Congo]], formerly the [[French Congo]], with its capital at [[Brazzaville]]. The state's name changed to the Democratic Republic of the Congo in August 1964.{{sfn|EISA|2002a}} }} between 1960 and 1965. The crisis began almost immediately after the Congo became independent from Belgium and ended, unofficially, with the entire country under the rule of [[Mobutu Sese Seko|Joseph-Désiré Mobutu]]. Constituting a series of [[civil war]]s, the Congo Crisis was also a [[proxy war|proxy conflict]] in the [[Cold War]], in which the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]] supported opposing factions. Around 100,000 people are believed to have been killed during the crisis.

A nationalist movement in the [[Belgian Congo]] demanded the end of colonial rule: this led to the country's independence on 30 June 1960. Minimal preparations had been made and many issues, such as [[federalism]], [[tribalism]], and [[ethnic nationalism]], remained unresolved. In the first week of July, [[Mutiny of the Force Publique|a mutiny]] broke out in the army and violence erupted between black and white civilians. Belgium sent troops to protect fleeing whites. [[State of Katanga|Katanga]] and [[South Kasai]] seceded with Belgian support. Amid continuing unrest and violence, the [[United Nations]] deployed [[United Nations Operation in the Congo|peacekeepers]], but UN Secretary-General [[Dag Hammarskjöld]] refused to use these troops to help the central government in [[Kinshasa|Léopoldville]] fight the secessionists. Prime Minister [[Patrice Lumumba]], the charismatic leader of the largest nationalist faction, reacted by calling for assistance from the Soviet Union, which promptly sent military advisors and other support.

The involvement of the Soviets split the Congolese government and led to an impasse between Lumumba and President [[Joseph Kasa-Vubu]]. Mobutu, in command of the army, broke this deadlock with a [[coup d'état]], expelled the Soviet advisors and established a new government effectively under his own control. Lumumba was taken captive and subsequently executed in 1961. A rival government of the "[[Free Republic of the Congo]]" was founded in the eastern city of [[Kisangani|Stanleyville]] by Lumumba supporters led by [[Antoine Gizenga]]. It gained Soviet support but was crushed in early 1962. Meanwhile, the UN took a more aggressive stance towards the secessionists after Hammarskjöld was killed in [[1961 Ndola United Nations DC-6 crash|a plane crash]] in late 1961. Supported by UN troops, Léopoldville defeated secessionist movements in Katanga and South Kasai by the start of 1963.

With Katanga and South Kasai back under the government's control, a reconciliatory compromise constitution was adopted and the exiled Katangese leader, [[Moïse Tshombe]], was recalled to head an interim administration while fresh elections were organised. Before these could be held, however, [[Maoism|Maoist]]-inspired militants calling themselves the "[[Simba rebellion|Simbas]]" rose up in the east of the country. The Simbas took control of a significant amount of territory and proclaimed a communist "People's Republic of the Congo" in Stanleyville. Government forces gradually retook territory and, in November 1964, Belgium and the United States [[Operation Dragon Rouge|intervened militarily]] in Stanleyville to recover hostages from Simba captivity. The Simbas were defeated and collapsed soon after. Following [[Democratic Republic of the Congo general election, 1965|the elections]] in March 1965, a new political stalemate developed between Tshombe and Kasa-Vubu, forcing the government into near-paralysis. Mobutu mounted a second coup d'état in November 1965, now taking personal control. Under Mobutu's rule, the Congo (renamed [[Zaire]] in 1971) was transformed into a dictatorship which would endure until his deposition in 1997.

==Background==

===Belgian rule===
{{main|Belgian Congo}}
[[File:Democratic Republic of the Congo in Africa.svg|thumb|left|The [[Belgian Congo]], today the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], highlighted on a map of Africa]]
[[Colonization of the Congo|Colonial rule in the Congo]] began in the late 19th century. [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold II]] of Belgium, frustrated by Belgium's lack of international power and prestige, attempted to persuade the Belgian government to support colonial expansion around the then-largely unexplored [[Congo Basin]]. The Belgian government's ambivalence about the idea led Leopold to eventually create the colony on his own account. With support from a number of Western countries, who viewed Leopold as a useful [[Buffer state|buffer]] between rival colonial powers, Leopold achieved international recognition for a personal colony, the [[Congo Free State]], in 1885.{{sfn|Pakenham|1992|pp=253–55}} By the turn of the century, however, the violence of Free State officials against indigenous Congolese and the ruthless system of economic extraction had led to intense diplomatic pressure on Belgium to take official control of the country, which it did in 1908, creating the [[Belgian Congo]].{{sfn|Pakenham|1992|pp=588–89}}

Belgian rule in the Congo was based around the "colonial trinity" (''trinité coloniale'') of [[Government|state]], [[Christianity|missionary]] and [[Privately held company|private company]] interests.{{sfn|Turner|2007|p=28}} The privileging of Belgian commercial interests meant that capital sometimes flowed back into the Congo and that individual regions became [[economic specialization|specialised]]. On many occasions, the interests of the government and private enterprise became closely tied and the state helped companies with [[strikebreaking]] and countering other efforts by the indigenous population to better their lot.{{sfn|Turner|2007|p=28}} The country was split into nesting, hierarchically organised administrative subdivisions, and run uniformly according to a set "native policy" (''politique indigène'')—in contrast to the British and the French, who generally favoured the system of [[indirect rule]] whereby traditional leaders were retained in positions of authority under colonial oversight. There was also a high degree of [[racial segregation]]. Large numbers of white immigrants who moved to the Congo after the end of [[World War II]] came from across the social spectrum, but were nonetheless always treated as superior to blacks.{{sfn|Turner|2007|p=29}}

During the 1940s and 1950s, the Congo experienced an unprecedented level of [[urbanisation]] and the colonial administration began various [[International development|development]] programmes aimed at making the territory into a "model colony".{{sfn|Freund|1998|pp=198–99}} One of the results of the measures was the development of a new middle class of Europeanised African "''[[évolué]]s''" in the cities.{{sfn|Freund|1998|pp=198–99}} By the 1950s the Congo had a [[wage labour]] force twice as large as that in any other African colony.{{sfn|Freund|1998|p=198}} The Congo's rich natural resources, including uranium—[[Belgian Congo in World War II#Uranium|much of the uranium]] used by the U.S. nuclear programme during World War II was Congolese—led to substantial interest in the region from both the [[Soviet Union]] and the United States as the [[Cold War]] developed.{{sfn|Borstelmann|1993|pp=92–93}}

===Politics and radicalisation===
An [[African nationalism|African nationalist movement]] developed in the Belgian Congo during the 1950s, primarily among the ''évolués''. The movement was divided into a number of parties and groups which were broadly divided on ethnic and geographical lines and opposed to one another.{{sfn|Freund|1998|p=199}} The largest, the ''[[Mouvement National Congolais]]'' (MNC), was a [[united front]] organisation dedicated to achieving independence "within a reasonable" time.{{sfn|Zeilig|2008|p=64}} It was created around a charter which was signed by, among others, [[Patrice Lumumba]], [[Cyrille Adoula]] and [[Joseph Iléo]], but others accused the party of being too moderate.{{sfn|Zeilig|2008|pp=64–65}} Lumumba became a leading figure within the MNC, and by the end of 1959, the party claimed to have 58,000 members.{{sfn|Zeilig|2008|p=76}}

[[File:Joseph Kasa-Vubu at the Belgo-Congolese Round Table Conference.jpg|thumb|upright|The leader of ABAKO, [[Joseph Kasa-Vubu]], who later became the independent Congo's first President]]
The MNC's main rival was the ''[[ABAKO|Alliance des Bakongo]]'' (ABAKO),{{efn|In most [[Bantu languages]], the [[prefix#Bantu languages|prefix]] ''ba-'' (or ''wa-'') is added to a human noun to form a plural. As such, ''Bakongo'' refers collectively to members of the [[Kongo people|Kongo ethnic group]].}} led by [[Joseph Kasa-Vubu]], who advocated a more radical ideology than the MNC, based around calls for immediate independence and the promotion of regional identity.{{sfn|Zeilig|2008|pp=65–66}} ABAKO's stance was more [[ethnic nationalism|ethnic nationalist]] than the MNC's; it argued that an independent Congo should be run by the [[Kongo people|Bakongo]] as inheritors of the pre-colonial [[Kingdom of the Kongo]].{{sfn|Zeilig|2008|p=66}} The ''[[CONAKAT|Confédération des Associations Tribales du Katanga]]'' (CONAKAT), a localist party led by [[Moïse Tshombe]], was the third major organisation; it advocated [[federalism]] and primarily represented the southern province of [[Katanga Province|Katanga]]. These were joined by a number of smaller parties which emerged as the nationalist movement developed, including the radical ''[[Parti Solidaire Africain]]'' (PSA), and factions representing the interests of minor ethnic groups like the ''[[Alliance des Bayanzi]]'' (ABAZI).{{sfn|Zeilig|2008|p=74}}

Although it was the largest of the African nationalist parties, the MNC had many different factions within it that took differing stances on a number of issues. It was increasingly polarised between moderate ''évolués'' and the more radical mass membership.{{sfn|Zeilig|2008|pp=82–83}} A radical faction headed by Iléo and [[Albert Kalonji]] split away in July 1959, but failed to induce mass defections by other MNC members. The dissident faction became known as the MNC-Kalonji (MNC-K), while the majority group became the MNC-Lumumba (MNC-L). The split divided the party's support base into those who remained with Lumumba, chiefly in the [[Kisangani|Stanleyville]] region in the north-east, and those who backed the MNC-K, which became most popular around the southern city of [[Lubumbashi|Élisabethville]] and among the [[Luba people|Luba ethnic group]].{{sfn|Zeilig|2008|pp=83–85}}

[[1959 Léopoldville Riots|Major riots broke out]] in [[Kinshasa|Léopoldville]], the Congolese capital, on 4 January 1959 after a political demonstration turned violent. The ''[[Force Publique]]'', the colonial [[gendarmerie]], used force against the rioters—at least 49 people were killed, and total casualties may have been as high as 500.{{sfn|Zeilig|2008|p=70}} The nationalist parties' influence expanded outside the major cities for the first time, and nationalist demonstrations and riots became a regular occurrence over the next year, bringing large numbers of black people from outside the ''évolué'' class into the independence movement. Many blacks began to test the boundaries of the colonial system by refusing to pay taxes or abide by minor colonial regulations. The bulk of the ABAKO leadership was arrested, leaving the MNC in an advantageous position.{{sfn|Zeilig|2008|pp=70–73}}

These developments led to the white community also becoming increasing radicalised. Some whites planned to attempt a ''[[coup d'état]]'' if a black majority government took power.{{sfn|Zeilig|2008|p=70}} As law and order began to break down, white civilians formed [[militia]] groups known as ''Corps de Voluntaires Européens'' ("European Volunteer Corps") to police their neighbourhoods. These militias frequently attacked blacks.{{sfn|Zeilig|2008|p=79}}

===Independence===
In the fallout from the Léopoldville riots, the report of a Belgian parliamentary [[working group]] on the future of the Congo was published in which a strong demand for "internal autonomy" was noted.{{sfn|Zeilig|2008|p=76}} [[August de Schryver]], the Minister of the Colonies, launched a high-profile [[Congolese Round Table Conference|Round Table Conference]] in [[Brussels]] in January 1960, with the leaders of all the major Congolese parties in attendance.{{sfn|Zeilig|2008|p=88}} Lumumba, who had been arrested following riots in Stanleyville, was released in the run-up to the conference and headed the MNC-L delegation.{{sfn|Zeilig|2008|p=87}} The Belgian government had hoped for a period of at least 30 years before independence, but Congolese pressure at the conference led to 30 June 1960 being set as the date.{{sfn|Zeilig|2008|p=88}} Issues including [[federalism]], [[Ethnic nationalism|ethnicity]] and the future role of Belgium in Congolese affairs were left unresolved after the delegates failed to reach agreement.{{sfn|Zeilig|2008|pp=89–91}}

[[File:De Congolese leider Patrice Loemoemba in Brussel, Bestanddeelnr 910-9741.jpg|thumb|[[Patrice Lumumba]], leader of the MNC-L and first Prime Minister, pictured in [[Brussels]] at the [[Congolese Round Table Conference|Round Table Conference]] of 1960]]

Belgians began campaigning against Lumumba, whom they wanted to marginalise; they accused him of being a [[communism|communist]] and, hoping to fragment the nationalist movement, supported rival, ethnic-based parties like CONAKAT.{{sfn|Zeilig|2008|pp=90–91}} Many Belgians hoped that an independent Congo would form part of a federation, like the [[French Community]] or British [[Commonwealth of Nations]], and that close economic and political association with Belgium would continue.{{sfn|Zeilig|2008|pp=93–94}} As independence approached, the Belgian government organised Congolese [[Belgian Congo general election, 1960|elections in May 1960]]. These resulted in an MNC [[relative majority]].{{sfn|Zeilig|2008|p=87}}

The proclamation of the independent [[Republic of the Congo (Léopoldville)|Republic of the Congo]], and the end of colonial rule, occurred as planned on 30 June 1960. In a ceremony at the ''[[Palais de la Nation (Kinshasa)|Palais de la Nation]]'' in Léopoldville, [[Baudouin of Belgium|King Baudouin]] gave a speech in which he presented the end of colonial rule in the Congo as the culmination of the Belgian "[[civilising mission]]" begun by Leopold II.{{sfn|Zeilig|2008|p=96}} After the King's address, Lumumba [[Congolese Independence Speech|gave an unscheduled speech]] in which he angrily attacked [[colonialism]] and described independence as the crowning success of the [[African nationalism|nationalist movement]].{{sfn|Zeilig|2008|pp=96–100}} Although Lumumba's address was acclaimed by figures such as [[Malcolm X]], it nearly provoked a [[diplomatic incident]] with Belgium; even some Congolese politicians perceived it as unnecessarily provocative.{{sfn|Zeilig|2008|p=100}} Nevertheless, independence was celebrated across the Congo.{{sfn|Zeilig|2008|pp=100–01}}

Politically, the new state had a [[semi-presidential system|semi-presidential constitution]], known as the ''Loi Fondamentale'', in which executive power was shared between President and Prime Minister in a system known as ''bicephalisme''.{{sfn|EISA|2002a}} Kasa-Vubu was proclaimed President, and Lumumba Prime Minister, of the Republic of the Congo.{{sfn|Zeilig|2008|p=91}} Despite the objections of CONAKAT and others, the constitution was largely centralist, concentrating power in the central government in Léopoldville, and did not devolve significant powers to provincial level.{{sfn|Zeilig|2008|p=102}}

==Beginning of the crisis==

===''Force Publique'' mutiny, racial violence and Belgian intervention===
Despite the proclamation of independence, neither the Belgian nor the Congolese government intended the colonial social order to end immediately. The Belgian government hoped that whites might keep their position indefinitely.{{sfn|Zeilig|2008|p=102}} The Republic of the Congo was still reliant on colonial institutions like the ''[[Force Publique]]'' to function from day to day, and white technical experts, installed by the Belgians, were retained in the broad absence of suitably qualified black Congolese replacements (partly the result of colonial restrictions regarding higher education).{{sfn|Zeilig|2008|p=102}} Many Congolese people had assumed that independence would produce tangible and immediate social change, so the retention of whites in positions of importance was widely resented.{{sfn|Zeilig|2008|p=103}}

{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote="Independence brings changes to politicians and to civilians. But for you, nothing will be changed&amp;nbsp;... none of your new masters can change the structure of an army which, throughout its history, has been the most organized, the most victorious in Africa. The politicians have lied to you."|source=Extract from [[Émile Janssens]]' speech to the ''Force Publique'' on 5 July 1960{{sfn|Zeilig|2008|p=103}}}}
Lieutenant-General [[Émile Janssens]], the Belgian commander of the ''Force Publique'', refused to see Congolese independence as marking a change in the nature of command.{{sfn|Zeilig|2008|p=103}} The day after the independence festivities, he gathered the black [[non-commissioned officer]]s of his Léopoldville garrison and told them that things under his command would stay the same, summarising the point by writing "Before Independence = After Independence" on a blackboard. This message was hugely unpopular among the rank and file—many of the men had expected rapid promotions and increases in pay to accompany independence.{{sfn|Zeilig|2008|p=103}} On 5 July 1960, [[Mutiny of the Force Publique|several units mutinied]] against their white officers at Camp Hardy near [[Mbanza-Ngungu|Thysville]]. The insurrection spread to Léopoldville the next day and later to garrisons across the country.{{sfn|Gondola|2002|p=118}}

Rather than deploying Belgian troops against the mutineers as Janssens had wished, Lumumba dismissed him and renamed the ''Force Publique'' the ''[[Armée Nationale Congolaise]]'' (ANC). All black soldiers were promoted by at least one rank.{{sfn|Zeilig|2008|p=104}} [[Victor Lundula]] was promoted directly from [[sergeant-major]] to [[major-general]] and head of the army, replacing Janssens.{{sfn|Gondola|2002|p=118}} At the same time, [[Mobutu Sese Seko|Joseph-Désiré Mobutu]], an ex-sergeant-major and close personal aide of Lumumba, became Lundula's deputy as army [[chief of staff]].{{sfn|Renton|Seddon|Zeilig|2007|p=113}} The government attempted to stop the revolt—Lumumba and Kasa-Vubu intervened personally at Léopoldville and Thysville and persuaded the mutineers to lay down their arms—but in most of the country the mutiny intensified. White officers and civilians were attacked, white-owned properties were looted and white women were raped.{{sfn|Gondola|2002|p=118}} The Belgian government became deeply concerned by the situation, particularly when white civilians began entering neighbouring countries as refugees.{{sfn|Gondola|2002|p=119}}

[[File:ANC soldiers on roadside.jpg|thumb|left|''Force Publique'' soldiers in Léopoldville in 1960]]
Lumumba's stance appeared to many Belgians to justify their prior concerns about his radicalism.{{sfn|Zeilig|2008|p=104}} On 9 July, Belgium deployed paratroopers, without the Congolese state's permission, in [[Kabalo]] and elsewhere to protect fleeing white civilians.{{sfn|Zeilig|2008|p=105}} The Belgian intervention divided Lumumba and Kasa-Vubu; while Kasa-Vubu accepted the Belgian operation,{{sfn|Gondola|2002|p=119}} Lumumba denounced it and called for "all Congolese to defend our republic against those who menace it."{{sfn|Zeilig|2008|p=105}} At Lumumba's request, white civilians from the port city of [[Matadi]] were evacuated by the [[Belgian Navy]] on 11 July. Belgian ships then bombarded the city; at least 19 civilians were killed. This action prompted renewed attacks on whites across the country, while Belgian forces entered other towns and cities, including Léopoldville, and clashed with Congolese troops.{{sfn|Gondola|2002|p=119}} The Belgian government subsequently announced that it would provide for Belgian bureaucrats back in the metropole, triggering an exodus of most of the Congo's 10,000 European civil servants and leaving the administration in disarray.{{sfn|Young|1966|p=35}} Engulfed by the disorder spreading throughout the country, most of the government ministries were unable to function.{{sfn|Young|2015|p=334}}

===Katanga and South Kasai secessions===
{{main|State of Katanga|South Kasai}}
[[File:Flag of Katanga.svg|thumb|[[Flag of Katanga|Flag]] of the secessionist [[State of Katanga]], declared in 1960]]
On 11 July 1960, Moïse Tshombe, the leader of CONAKAT, declared the Congo's southern [[Katanga Province|province of Katanga]] independent as the State of Katanga, with Élisabethville as its capital and himself as President.{{sfn|Nugent|2004|p=85}} The mineral-rich Katanga region had traditionally shared closer economic ties with the [[Copperbelt]] of neighbouring [[Northern Rhodesia]] (then part of the [[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland|Central African Federation]]) than with the rest of the Congo,{{sfn|Nugent|2004|p=85}} and because of its economic importance it had been administered separately from the rest of the country under the Belgians.{{sfn|Turner|2007|p=28}} CONAKAT furthermore contended that Katangese people were ethnically distinct from other Congolese. The secession was partly motivated by the Katangese separatists' desire to keep more of the wealth generated by the province's mining operations and to avoid sharing it with the rest of the Congo.{{sfn|Nugent|2004|pp=85–86}} Another major factor was what CONAKAT held to be the disintegration of law and order in the central and north-eastern Congo. Announcing Katanga's breakaway, Tshombe said "We are seceding from chaos."{{sfn|Struelens|1978|p=48}}

[[File:Tshombe with Operation Unokat casualty cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The President of secessionist Katanga, [[Moïse Tshombe]]]]
The major mining company in Katanga, the {{lang|fr|[[Union Minière du Haut Katanga]]}} (UMHK), had begun supporting CONAKAT during the latter days of Belgian rule amid worries that the MNC might seek to nationalise the company's assets after independence. UMHK was largely owned by the {{lang|fr|[[Société Générale de Belgique]]}}, a prominent [[holding company]] based in Brussels that had close ties to the Belgian government. Encouraged by the UMHK, the Belgian government provided military support to Katanga and ordered its civil servants in the region to remain in their posts.{{sfn|Nugent|2004|p=86}} Tshombe also recruited [[mercenary|mercenaries]], mainly whites from South Africa and the Rhodesias, to supplement and command Katangese troops.{{sfn|Mockler|1986|p=117}} Although supported by the Belgians, Katanga never received formal [[diplomatic recognition]] from any country.{{sfn|Nugent|2004|p=97}} The Katangese secession highlighted the "fundamental weakness" of the central government in Léopoldville, which had been the chief advocate of a unified state.{{sfn|Nugent|2004|p=86}}

Less than a month after the Katangese secession, on 8 August, a section of the region of [[Kasai region|Kasai]] situated slightly to the north of Katanga also declared its autonomy from the central government as the [[South Kasai|Mining State of South Kasai]] ({{lang|fr|Sud-Kasaï}}) based around the city of [[Mbuji-Mayi|Bakwanga]].{{sfn|Nugent|2004|p=86}} South Kasai was much smaller than Katanga, but was also a mining region. It was largely populated by the [[Luba people|Luba ethnic group]], and its president, [[Albert Kalonji]], claimed that the secession was largely sparked by persecution of the Baluba in the rest of the Congo.{{sfn|Nugent|2004|p=86}} The South Kasai government was supported by {{lang|fr|[[Forminière]]}}, another Belgian mining company, which received concessions from the new state in return for financial support.{{sfn|Nugent|2004|p=86}} Without control over Katanga and South Kasai, the central government was deprived of approximately 40 percent of its revenues.{{sfn|Young|1966|p=35}}

===Foreign reaction and UN intervention===
{{see also|United Nations Operation in the Congo}}
Disquiet about Belgium's support for the secessionist states led to calls within the [[United Nations]] (UN) to remove all Belgian troops from the country. The [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary General]] of the UN, [[Dag Hammarskjöld]], believed that the crisis would provide the organisation with a chance to demonstrate its potential as a major [[peacekeeping]] force and encouraged the sending of a multinational contingent of peacekeepers to the Congo under UN command.{{sfn|Freund|1998|p=201}} On 14 July, the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] adopted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 143|Resolution 143]], calling for total Belgian withdrawal from the Congo and their replacement with a UN-commanded force.{{sfn|Gendebien|1967|p=159}}

[[File:Swedish UN-soldier in Congo.jpg|thumb|A Swedish peacekeeping soldier in the Congo. The [[United Nations|UN]] deployed troops from a variety of nations during [[United Nations Operation in the Congo|ONUC]].]]
The arrival of the [[United Nations Operation in the Congo]] (ONUC) was initially welcomed by Lumumba and the central government who believed the UN would help suppress the secessionist states.{{sfn|Zeilig|2008|pp=110–11}} ONUC's initial mandate, however, only covered the maintenance of law and order. Viewing the secessions as an internal political matter, Hammarskjöld refused to use UN troops to assist the central Congolese government against them; he argued that doing so would represent a loss of impartiality and breach Congolese sovereignty.{{sfn|Zeilig|2008|p=116}} Lumumba also sought the assistance of the United States government of [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], which refused to provide unilateral military support.{{sfn|Gibbs|1991|pp=92–93}} Frustrated, he turned to the Soviet Union, which agreed to provide weapons, logistical and material support. Around 1,000 Soviet military advisors soon landed in the Congo.{{sfn|Zeilig|2008|p=116}} Lumumba's actions distanced him from the rest of the government, especially Kasa-Vubu, who feared the implications of Soviet intervention. The Americans also feared that a Soviet-aligned Congo could form the basis of a major expansion of communism into central Africa.{{sfn|Zeilig|2008|p=116}}

With Soviet support, 2,000 ANC troops launched a major offensive against South Kasai.{{sfn|Zeilig|2008|p=114}} The attack was extremely successful, but during the course of the offensive, the ANC became involved in infighting between the Baluba and [[Lulua people|Bena Lulua]] ethnic groups.{{sfn|Zeilig|2008|p=114}} and perpetrated a number of large massacres of Luba civilians.{{sfn|Zeilig|2008|p=114}} Around 3,000 were killed.{{sfn|Haskin|2005|p=26}} The violence of the advance caused an exodus of thousands of Baluba civilians who fled their homes to escape the fighting.{{sfn|Haskin|2005|p=33}}

The involvement of the Soviet Union alarmed the United States. The American government under Eisenhower, in line with Belgian criticism, had long believed that Lumumba was a communist and that the Congo could be on track to become a strategically placed Soviet [[client state]]. In August 1960, [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) agents in the region reported to their agency that "Congo [is] experiencing [a] classic communist&amp;nbsp;... takeover" and warned that the Congo might [[Cuban Revolution|follow the same path as Cuba]].{{sfn|Turner|2007|p=32}}

==Political disintegration==

===Central government split and first Mobutu coup===
[[File:College of Commissioners.jpg|thumb|Kasa-Vubu with the members of the College of Commissionaires-General, installed by Mobutu in September 1960|left]]
Lumumba's appeal for Soviet support split the government and led to mounting pressure from Western countries to remove him from power. In addition, both Tshombe and Kalonji appealed to Kasa-Vubu, who they believed to be both a moderate and federalist, to move against Lumumba's centralism and resolve the secession issue.{{sfn|Nzongola-Ntalaja|2007|p=108}} Meanwhile, Mobutu took effective control of the army, routing foreign aid and promotions to specific units and officers to secure their allegiance.{{sfn|Renton|Seddon|Zeilig|2007|p=113}}

On 5 September 1960, Kasa-Vubu announced on national radio that he had unilaterally [[Dissolution of the Lumumba Government|dismissed Lumumba]], using the massacres in South Kasai as a pretext and with the promise of American backing.{{sfn|Nzongola-Ntalaja|2007|p=108}} [[Andrew W. Cordier|Andrew Cordier]], the American UN representative in the Congo, used his position to block communications by Lumumba's faction and to prevent a coordinated MNC-L reaction to the news.{{sfn|Zeilig|2008|p=119}} Both chambers of Parliament, however, supported Lumumba and denounced Kasa-Vubu's action.{{sfn|Nzongola-Ntalaja|2007|p=108}} Lumumba attempted to dismiss Kasa-Vubu from his position, but could not get support for this, precipitating a constitutional crisis.{{sfn|Nzongola-Ntalaja|2007|p=108}} Ostensibly in order to resolve the deadlock, Joseph-Désiré Mobutu launched a bloodless coup and replaced both Kasa-Vubu and Lumumba with a College of Commissionaires-General (''Collège des Commissaires-généraux'') consisting of a panel of university graduates, led by [[Justin Marie Bomboko|Justin Bomboko]].{{sfn|Nzongola-Ntalaja|2007|p=109}} Soviet military advisors were ordered to leave.{{sfn|Zeilig|2008|p=117}} Allegedly, the coup was intended to force the politicians to take a cooling-off period before they could resume control. In practice, however, Mobutu sided with Kasa-Vubu against Lumumba, who was placed under house arrest, guarded by Ghanaian UN troops and an outer ring of ANC soldiers.{{sfn|Nzongola-Ntalaja|2007|pp=109–10}} Kasa-Vubu was re-appointed President by Mobutu in February 1961. From the coup onwards, Mobutu was able to exert considerable power in Congolese politics behind the scenes.{{sfn|Gendebien|1967|p=78}}{{sfn|Zeilig|2008|p=117}}

[[File:Mobutu and Kasa-Vubu in 1961.jpg|thumb|Colonel Mobutu (left) pictured alongside President Kasa-Vubu in 1961]]
Following Kasa-Vubu's reinstatement, there was an attempted rapprochement between the Congolese factions. Tshombe began negotiations for the end of the secession and the formation of a [[confederal]] Congo. Although a compromise agreement was reached, it was prevented from taking effect as negotiations broke down amid personal animosity between Kasa-Vubu and Tshombe.{{sfn|Nugent|2004|p=87}} An attempted reconciliation in July 1961 led to the formation of a new government, led by [[Cyrille Adoula]], which brought together deputies from both Lumumbist and South Kasai factions but also failed to bring a reconciliation with Katanga.{{sfn|Nugent|2004|p=87}}

Members of the MNC-L fled to Stanleyville where, led by [[Antoine Gizenga]], they formed [[Free Republic of the Congo|a rebel government]] in November 1960 in opposition to the central government in Léopoldville.{{sfn|Nugent|2004|p=87}}{{sfn|Gendebien|1967|p=87}} The Gizenga government was recognised by some states, including the Soviet Union and China, as the official government of the Congo and could call on an approximate 5,500 troops compared to the central government's 7,000.{{sfn|Haskin|2005|p=30}} Faced with UN pressure, the Gizenga government however collapsed in January 1962 after Gizenga was arrested.{{sfn|Gendebien|1967|p=205}}

===Killing of Lumumba===
[[File:Protestno zborovanje v Mariboru ob umoru kongovskega predsednika Patricea Lumumbe 1961 (3).jpg|thumb|Pro-Lumumba demonstrators in [[Maribor]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] in February 1961|left]]
Lumumba escaped house arrest and fled eastwards towards Stanleyville where he believed he could rally support. Pursued by troops loyal to Mobutu, he was captured at [[Ilebo|Port Francqui]] on 1 December 1960 and flown back to Léopoldville with his hands bound.{{sfn|Zeilig|2008|pp=120–22}} Despite UN appeals to Kasa-Vubu for [[due process|due legal process]], the Soviet Union denounced the UN as responsible for the arrest and demanded his release. A meeting of the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] was called on 7 December 1960 to consider Soviet demands that the UN seek Lumumba's immediate release, his restoration to the head of the Congolese government and the disarming of Mobutu's forces. The pro-Lumumba resolution was defeated on 14 December 1960 by a vote of 8–2. Still in captivity, Lumumba was tortured and transported to [[Mbanza-Ngungu|Thysville]] and later to Katanga, where he was handed over to forces loyal to Tshombe.{{sfn|Zeilig|2008|p=122}} On 17 January 1961, Lumumba was executed by Katangese troops near Élisabethville.{{sfn|Nzongola-Ntalaja|2007|p=111}}

News of the execution, released on 13 February, provoked international outrage.{{sfn|Haskin|2005|p=29}} The Belgian Embassy in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] was attacked by protesters in [[Belgrade]], and violent demonstrations occurred in [[London]] and [[New York City|New York]].{{sfn|BBC|2005}} Shortly thereafter seven Lumumbists, including the first President of [[Orientale Province]], [[Jean-Pierre Finant]], were executed in South Kasai for "crimes against the Baluba nation". Gizenga's soldiers then shot 15 political prisoners in retaliation, including Lumumba's dissident Minister of Communications, [[Alphonse Songolo]].{{sfn|Young|2015|p=331}}

===United Nations escalation and the end of the Katangese secession===
Since its initial resolution of July 1960, the UN had issued further resolutions calling for the total withdrawal of Belgian and mercenary forces from Katanga in progressively stronger terms. By 1961, ONUC comprised nearly 20,000 men.{{sfn|Nzongola-Ntalaja|2007|p=94}} Although their mandate prevented them from taking sides, ONUC had a mandate to arrest foreign mercenaries wherever they encountered them. In September 1961, an attempt to detain a group of Katangese mercenaries without violence during [[Operation Morthor]] went wrong and turned into a fire-fight.{{sfn|Boulden|2001|p=35}}{{efn|A similar mission, [[Operation Rum Punch]], had taken place a few weeks earlier and had resulted in the successful arrest of around 40 mercenaries without violence.{{sfn|Boulden|2001|p=35}} }} ONUC's claim to impartiality was undermined in mid-September when a company of Irish UN troops were captured by numerically superior Katangese forces following a [[Siege of Jadotville|six-day siege]] in [[Likasi|Jadotville]].{{efn|The Irish were compelled to surrender when their ammunition and supplies ran out. None were killed. The Katangese, though victorious, suffered hundreds of casualties.{{sfn|Whelan|2006|pp=8, 12}} }} Katanga proceeded to hold the Irishmen as prisoners of war, a development that deeply embarrassed the UN mission and its proponents.{{sfn|Whelan|2006|pp=8, 60–62}}

On 18 September 1961 Hammarskjöld flew to [[Ndola]], just across the border in [[Northern Rhodesia]], to attempt to broker a [[cease-fire]] between UN and Katangese forces. [[1961 Ndola United Nations DC-6 crash|His aircraft crashed]] before landing at [[Ndola Airport]], killing him and everybody else on board.{{sfn|Boulden|2001|p=36}} In stark contrast to Hammarskjöld's attempts to pursue a moderate policy in the Congo, his successor [[U Thant]] supported a more radical policy of direct involvement in the conflict.{{sfn|Boulden|2001|p=36}} Katanga released the captured Irish soldiers in mid-October as part of a cease-fire deal in which ONUC agreed to pull its troops back—a propaganda coup for Tshombe.{{sfn|Whelan|2006|pp=8, 60–62}} Restated American support for the UN mission, and the [[Kindu atrocity|murder of ten Italian UN pilots]] in [[Kindu|Port-Émpain]] in November 1961, strengthened international demands to resolve the situation.{{sfn|Boulden|2001|p=36}} In December 1961, South Kasai was finally overrun by ANC troops and Kalonji was arrested, ending the South Kasai secession.

[[File:Kongo 1961 map en.png|thumb|left|Map of the factions in the Congo in 1961]]
[[United Nations Security Council Resolution 169|Resolution 169]], issued in November 1961, called for ONUC to respond to the deteriorating human rights situation and prevent the outbreak of full-scale civil war. The resolution "completely rejected" Katanga's claim to statehood and authorised ONUC troops to use all necessary force to "assist the Central Government of the Congo in the restoration and maintenance of law and order".{{sfn|UN Resolution 169}} The Katangese made further provocations and, in response, ONUC launched Operation Unokat to dismantle Katangese roadblocks and seize strategic positions around Élisabethville. Faced with international pressure, Tshombe signed the Kitona Declaration in December 1962 in which he agreed in principle to accept the authority of the central government and state constitution and to abandon any claim to Katangese independence.{{sfn|Boulden|2001|p=38}} Following the declaration, however, talks between Tshombe and Adoula reached a deadlock, while Katangese forces continued to harass UN troops. Diminishing support and Belgium's increasing reluctance to support Katanga demonstrated that the state could not survive indefinitely.{{sfn|Boulden|2001|p=36}} On 11 December 1962, Belgian Foreign Minister [[Paul-Henri Spaak]] declared that the Belgian government would support the UN or the central Congolese government should they attempt to end the Katangese secession through force.{{sfn|Packham|1996|p=194}}

On 24 December 1962, UN troops and Katangese gendarmes clashed near Élisabethville and fighting broke out. After attempts to reach a ceasefire failed, UN troops launched [[Operation Grandslam]] and occupied Élisabethville, prompting Tshombe to leave the country. A ceasefire was agreed upon soon thereafter. Indian UN troops, exceeding their orders, then occupied Jadotville, preventing Katangese loyalists from regrouping.{{sfn|Boulden|2001|p=40}} Gradually, the UN overran the rest of the Katanga and, on 17 January 1963, Tshombe surrendered his final stronghold of [[Kolwezi]], effectively ending the Katangese secession.{{sfn|Boulden|2001|p=40}}

===Attempted political reconciliation===
[[File:Reconciliation stamp, Congo Léopoldville 1963.jpg|thumb|A 1963 [[postage stamp]] commemorating the "reconciliation" of the political factions in the Congo after the end of the Katangese secession]]
Following the end of the Katanga secession, political negotiations began to reconcile the disparate political factions.{{sfn|EISA|2002a}} The negotiations coincided with the formation of an [[émigré]] political group, the ''Conseil National de Libération'' (CNL), by dissident Lumumbists and others in neighbouring [[Republic of the Congo|Congo-Brazzaville]].{{sfn|Haskin|2005|p=36}} The negotiations culminated in the creation of a new, revised constitution, known as the [[Luluabourg Constitution]], after [[Kananga|the city]] in which it was written, to create a compromise balance of power.{{sfn|EISA|2002a}} The new constitution increased [[presidential system|the power of the presidency]], ending the system of joint consultation between President and Prime Minister, and appeased federalists by increasing the number of provinces from six to 21 while increasing their autonomy.{{sfn|Nzongola-Ntalaja|2007|p=36}}{{sfn|EISA|2002a}} The constitution also changed the name of the state from the Republic of the Congo to Democratic Republic of the Congo.{{sfn|EISA|2002a}} It was ratified in [[Republic of the Congo (Léopoldville) constitutional referendum, 1964|a constitutional referendum]] in June 1964 and Parliament was dissolved to await new elections.{{sfn|EISA|2002a}} Kasa-Vubu appointed Tshombe, the exiled Katangese leader, as interim Prime Minister.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1994|p=74}} Although personally capable, and supported as an anti-communist by Western powers, Tshombe was denounced by other African leaders such as [[Hassan II of Morocco|King Hassan II of Morocco]] as an imperialist puppet for his role in the Katangese secession.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1994|pp=73–74}}

Under Tshombe's interim government, fresh elections were scheduled for 30 March and the rebellion broke out in the central and eastern parts of the Congo.{{sfn|EISA|2002a}}

==Kwilu and Simba rebellions==
{{main|Simba Rebellion}}
The period of political crisis had led to widespread disenchantment with the central government brought in by independence. Demands for a "second independence" from [[kleptocracy]] and political infighting in the capital grew.{{sfn|Freund|1998|p=202}} The "second independence" slogan was taken up by [[Maoism|Maoist-inspired]] Congolese revolutionaries, including [[Pierre Mulele]] who had served in the Lumumba government. The political instability of the Congo helped to channel wider discontentment into outright revolt.{{sfn|Verhaegen|1967|p=348}}

[[File:Kongo 1964 map en.png|thumb|left|Map showing the territory controlled by the Simba (red) and Kwilu (yellow) rebels, 1964]]
Disruption in the rural Congo begun with agitation by Lumumbists, led by Mulele, among the [[Pende people|Pende]] and [[Ambundu|Mbundu peoples]].{{sfn|Freund|1998|p=202}}{{sfn|Nugent|2004|p=88}} By the end of 1963, there was unrest in regions of the central and eastern Congo. The [[Kwilu Rebellion]] broke out on 16 January 1964 in the cities of [[Idiofa]] and [[Gungu]] in [[Kwilu District|Kwilu Province]].{{sfn|Verhaegen|1967|p=346}} Further disruption and uprisings then spread to [[Kivu]] in the east and later to [[Kalemie|Albertville]], sparking further insurrection elsewhere in the Congo and the outbreak of the larger [[Simba Rebellion]].{{sfn|Fox|de Craemer|Ribeaucourt|1965|p=78}}{{sfn|Verhaegen|1967|p=346}} The rebels began to expand their territory and rapidly advance northwards, capturing Port-Émpain, Stanleyville, [[Isiro|Paulis]] and [[Lisala]] between July and August.{{sfn|Verhaegen|1967|p=346}}

The rebels, who called themselves "Simbas" (from the [[Swahili language|Kiswahili]] word for "[[lion]]"), had a populist but vague ideology, loosely based on communism, which prioritised equality and aimed to increase overall wealth.{{sfn|Verhaegen|1967|p=349}} Most of the active revolutionaries were young men who hoped that the rebellion would provide them with opportunities which the government had not.{{sfn|Verhaegen|1967|p=350}} The Simbas used [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] to initiate members and believed that, by following a moral code, they could become invulnerable to bullets.{{sfn|Verhaegen|1967|p=352}} Magic was also very important to the rebels who also made extensive use of [[witchcraft#Africa|witchcraft]] to protect themselves and also demoralise their ANC opponents.{{sfn|Verhaegen|1967|pp=352–54}} As they advanced, the rebels perpetrated numerous massacres in the territory they captured in order to remove political opposition and terrorise the population.{{sfn|Verhaegen|1967|p=355}} ONUC was in the process of withdrawing when the rebellions started and had only 5,500 personnel, most whom were deployed in the eastern part of the country and stranded by the conflict. Straggling Western missionaries retreated to their respective embassies, which in turn requested UN assistance.{{sfn|Horn|Harris|2001|p=310}} A small force of peacekeepers was assembled and subsequently dispatched to the Kwilu region to retrieve fleeing missionaries.{{sfn|Horn|Harris|2001|p=312}} Rescue operations continued throughout March and April and resulted in the successful recovery of over 100 missionaries.{{sfn|Horn|Harris|2001|p=316}}

[[File:Laissez-Passer of the People's Republic of the Congo-Stanleyville.jpg|thumb|Official pass issued by the People's Republic of the Congo]]
The rebels founded a state, the People's Republic of the Congo&lt;!--Do not link to [[People's Republic of the Congo]] which is about the state in Congo-Brazzaville---&gt; (''République populaire du Congo''), with its capital at Stanleyville and [[Christophe Gbenye]] as President. The new state was supported by the Soviet Union and China, which supplied it with arms, as did various African states, notably [[Tanzania]].{{sfn|Gleijeses|1994|p=81}} It was also supported by Cuba, which sent a team of over 100 advisors led by [[Che Guevara]] to advise the Simbas on tactics and doctrine.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1994|p=81}} The Simba rebellion coincided with a wide escalation of the Cold War amid the [[Gulf of Tonkin incident]] and it has been speculated that, had the rebellion not been rapidly defeated, a full-scale American military intervention could have occurred [[Vietnam War|as in Vietnam]].{{sfn|Gleijeses|1994|p=85}}

===Suppression and Belgian and American intervention===
{{see also|Operation Dragon Rouge}}
After its early string of successes, the Simba rebellion began to encounter local resistance as it encroached on areas outside of the MNC-L's old domain. The People's Republic also suffered from a lack of coherent social and economic policy, contributing to an inability to administer its own territory.{{sfn|Young|1966|p=40}} From the end of August 1964 the rebels began to lose ground to the ANC. Albertville and Lisala were recaptured in late August and early September.{{sfn|Verhaegen|1967|p=347}} Tshombe, backed by Mobutu, recalled many of his former mercenaries from the Katangese secession to oppose the Simba.{{sfn|Mockler|1986|pp=116–17}} Mercenaries, led by [[Mike Hoare|"Mad Mike" Hoare]] and mostly whites from central and southern Africa, were formed into a unit known as 5 Commando ANC.{{sfn|Mockler|1986|pp=118–19}} The unit served as the spearhead of the ANC, but were known for widespread unsanctioned killing, torture, looting and mass rapes in recaptured rebel areas.{{sfn|Nzongola-Ntalaja|2007|p=135}} In a press interview, Hoare himself described his men as "appalling thugs".{{sfn|Gleijeses|1994|p=79}} The mercenaries were also materially supported by the CIA.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1994|p=80}}

[[File:Dragonrouge1.jpg|thumb|Belgian paratroopers on [[Bangoka International Airport|Stanleyville airfield]] shortly after the operation]]

In November 1964, the Simbas rounded up the remaining white population of Stanleyville and its environs. The whites were held hostage in the Victoria Hotel in the city to use as bargaining tools with the ANC. In order to recover the hostages, Belgian [[1st Parachute Battalion (Belgium)|parachute troops]] were flown to the Congo in American aircraft to intervene. On 24 November, as part of [[Operation Dragon Rouge]], Belgian paratroopers landed in Stanleyville and quickly secured the hostages.{{sfn|Nzongola-Ntalaja|2007|p=136}} In total, around 70 hostages and 1,000 Congolese civilians were killed but the vast majority were evacuated.{{sfn|Nzongola-Ntalaja|2007|p=138}} The Belgian troops were only under orders to liberate the hostages, rather than push the Simbas out of the city, but the attack nevertheless "broke the back of the eastern insurrection, which never recovered."{{sfn|Nzongola-Ntalaja|2007|p=136}} The Simba leadership went into exile in disarray and severe disagreement; Gbenye was shot in the shoulder by his general after dismissing him.{{sfn|Young|1966|p=40}} Meanwhile, the Belgian paratroopers and the civilians returned to their country. In the aftermath of the intervention, Belgium itself was publicly accused of [[neocolonialism]].{{sfn|Nzongola-Ntalaja|2007|pp=138–39}}

As a result of the intervention, Tshombe lost the support of Kasa-Vubu and Mobutu and was dismissed from his post as prime minister in October 1965. Soon after ''Dragon Rouge'', ANC and mercenary troops captured Stanleyville, putting an end to the Simba rebellion. Pockets of Simba resistance continued to hold out in the eastern Congo, most notably in [[South Kivu]], where [[Laurent-Désiré Kabila]] led a Maoist cross-border insurgency which lasted until the 1980s.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1994|pp=84–85}}

==Second Mobutu coup d'état==
In the scheduled [[Democratic Republic of the Congo general election, 1965|March 1965 elections]], Tshombe's ''[[Congolese National Convention|Convention Nationale Congolaise]]'' (CONACO) won a large majority of the seats, but a large part of his party soon defected to form the new ''[[Congolese Democratic Front (Democratic Republic of the Congo)|Front Démocratique Congolais]]'' (FDC), making the overall result unclear as CONACO controlled the Chamber of Deputies while the FDC controlled the Senate. Kasa-Vubu, attempting to use the situation to block Tshombe, appointed an anti-Tshombe leader, [[Évariste Kimba]] of the FDC, to be prime minister-designate in November 1965, but the largely pro-Tshombe Parliament refused to ratify the appointment. Instead of seeking a compromise candidate, Kasa-Vubu again unilaterally declared Kimba to be Prime Minister, which was again rejected, creating a political deadlock. With the government in near-paralysis, Mobutu seized power in a bloodless coup, ostensibly to stop the impasse, on 25 November 1965.{{sfn|EISA|2002b}}

Under the auspices of a ''régime d'exception'' (the equivalent of a [[state of emergency]]), Mobutu assumed sweeping, almost absolute, power for five years, after which, he claimed, democracy would be restored.{{sfn|Nugent|2004|p=233}} Mobutu's coup, which promised both economic and political stability, was supported by the United States and other Western governments, and his rule initially met widespread popularity.{{sfn|Nugent|2004|p=233}} He increasingly took other powers, abolishing the post of Prime Minister in 1966 and dissolving Parliament in 1967.{{sfn|Nugent|2004|p=233}}

==Aftermath and legacy==
{{see also|Zaire}}
[[File:Mobutu Nixon closeup.png|thumb|Mobutu with [[Richard Nixon]] at the [[White House]] in 1973]]

Once established as the sole source of political power, Mobutu gradually consolidated his control in the Congo. The number of provinces was reduced, and their autonomy curtailed, resulting in a highly centralised state. Mobutu increasingly placed his supporters in the remaining positions of importance.{{sfn|Nugent|2004|p=233}} In 1967, to demonstrate his legitimacy, he created a party, the ''[[Popular Movement of the Revolution|Mouvement Populaire de la Révolution]]'' (MPR), which until 1990, was the nation's only legal political party under Mobutu's new constitution.{{sfn|Nugent|2004|p=233}} In 1971, the state was renamed [[Zaire]] and efforts were made [[Authenticité (Zaire)|to remove all colonial influences]]. He also nationalised the remaining foreign-owned economic assets in the country, including the UMHK which became ''[[Gécamines]]''.{{sfn|Nugent|2004|pp=234–35}} Despite initial successes, by the time of its disestablishment  Mobutu's rule was characterised by widespread [[cronyism]], corruption and economic mismanagement.{{sfn|Nugent|2004|pp=236–39}}

In the years after the Congo Crisis, Mobutu was able to remove many opposition figures from the crisis who might threaten his control. Tshombe was sent into a second exile in 1965 after being accused of treason.{{sfn|Zeilig|2008|p=140}} Between 1966 and 1967, [[Kisangani Mutinies|two mutinies in Stanleyville]] broke out involving up to 800 Katangese gendarmes and former mercenaries of Tshombe.{{sfn|Haskin|2005|pp=39–40}} The mutinies were eventually repressed. In 1967, Tshombe was sentenced to death ''[[Trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' and the same year was kidnapped in an [[aeroplane hijacking]] and held under arrest in Algeria. His death in 1969, allegedly from natural causes, has provoked speculation that the Mobutu government may have been involved.{{sfn|Zeilig|2008|p=140}} Mulele was also lured back to the Congo from exile by the promise of an amnesty but was tortured and murdered.{{sfn|Haskin|2005|p=40}}

===Political legacy===
The issues of federalism, ethnicity in politics and state centralisation were not resolved by the crisis and partly contributed to a decline in support for the concept of the state among Congolese people.{{sfn|Turner|2007|p=185}} Mobutu was strongly in favour of centralisation and one of his first acts, in 1965, were to reunify provinces and abolish much of their independent legislative capacity.{{sfn|Turner|2007|p=117}} Subsequent loss of faith in central government is one of the reasons that the Congo has been labeled as a [[failed state]], and has contributed violence by factions advocating ethnic and localised federalism.{{sfn|Turner|2007|p=185}}{{efn|Separatist movements in Katanga [[Katanga insurgency|have continued]] since the end of the Crisis. In the 1970s, two conflicts, known as [[Shaba I]] and [[Shaba II|II]], led by the ''[[Front for the National Liberation of the Congo|Front National pour la Libération du Congo]]'' (FNLC), attempted to use the chaos of the neighbouring [[Angolan Civil War]] to secede.{{sfn|Haskin|2005|pp=40–41}} After 2000, a further secessionist movement, led by the warlord [[Gédéon Kyungu Mutanga]] and his militia ''[[Mai Mai Kata Katanga|Kata Katanga]]'' ("Secede Katanga"), have attempted to defeat government forces and proclaim regional independence.{{sfn|BBC|2013}}}} Local insurgencies continued in the eastern Congo into the 1980s and left a legacy of instability along the Congo's eastern borders.{{sfn|Nugent|2004|pp=88–89}}

Laurent-Désiré Kabila, who had led an anti-Mobutu insurrection during the crisis, succeeded in deposing Mobutu in 1997. His son, [[Joseph Kabila]], is the incumbent president of the restored Democratic Republic of the Congo.{{sfn|Nugent|2004|p=393}} Following the fall of Mobutu, Antoine Gizenga founded a political party, the ''[[Unified Lumumbist Party|Parti Lumumbiste Unifié]]'' (PALU), and [[Democratic Republic of the Congo general election, 2006|was elected]] Prime Minister in 2006.{{sfn|Le Soir|2007}}

The Congo Crisis holds great significance in the [[collective memory]] of the Congolese people.{{sfn|De Goede|2015|p=587}} In particular, Lumumba's murder is viewed in the context of the memory as a symbolic moment in which the Congo lost its dignity in the international realm and the ability to determine its future, which has since been controlled by the West.{{sfn|De Goede|2015|pp=587–588}} Many Congolese view the problems of the crisis as unresolved, and believe that the Congo's self-determination has yet to be secured from Western machinations. The latter notion has largely shaped the political aspirations of a substantial number of Congolese.{{sfn|De Goede|2015|p=589}}

===Historical controversy===
The presentation of the Congo Crisis, and particularly the role of Western intervention, has been controversial and academics have accused various governments of distortion.{{sfn|Gibbs|1996|p=453}} In Belgium, allegations of Belgian complicity in the killing of Lumumba led to a state-backed enquiry and subsequent official apology for "moral responsibility", though not direct involvement, in the assassination in 2001.{{sfn|BBC|2001}} In the United States, the multi-volume official history of the American foreign service, ''[[Foreign Relations Series|Foreign Relations of the United States]]'', was accused by academics of being deliberately misleading about American involvement in the crisis and in the installation of Mobutu.{{sfn|Gibbs|1996|p=453}}
&lt;!---Should only be added if sources can be found:
===In popular culture===
The Congo Crisis has also featured in Western popular culture. [[Daniel Carney]]'s 1977 book, ''[[The Wild Geese (Carney novel)|The Wild Geese]]'', adapted into [[The Wild Geese|a film of the same name]] the year after, is set in the aftermath of the Congo Crisis as a fictionalised Congolese dictator, closely based on Mobutu, attempts to annihilate his former political opponents using mercenaries.  It is also mentioned in the 1989 song "[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]" by [[Billy Joel]].---&gt;

==International importance==
The turmoil of the Congo Crisis destabilised Central Africa and helped to ignite the [[Portuguese Colonial War]], especially the [[Angolan War of Independence|war of independence in neighbouring Angola]].{{sfn|Meredith|1984|pp=281–82}} Angolan nationalists had long had close ties with the Congo where many had lived as exiles. The ''[[National Liberation Front of Angola|União dos Povos de Angola]]'' (UPA),{{efn|The UPA was renamed the ''Frente Nacional de Libertação de Angola'', or FNLA, in 1962.{{sfn|Meredith|1984|p=283}}}} an Angolan nationalist organisation which drew support from the Angolan Bakongo, was supporting ABAKO politicians who had hopes of rebuilding the Kingdom of Kongo, altering the borders established during the colonial period.{{sfn|Meredith|1984|pp=282–83}} Believing that the independence of Congo was the first stage in this process, the UPA launched the [[Baixa de Cassanje revolt]] in 1961, igniting the conflict in Angola that would last until 1974.{{sfn|Meredith|1984|pp=281}} The Congolese, later Zairian, governments continued to provide support to Angolan rebels and even participated directly in the subsequent [[Angolan Civil War]].{{sfn|Meredith|1984|p=297}}

{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote="The Congo crisis revealed in one fell swoop the true nature of the powers which shaped large parts of the post-war world. The crisis showed ''in actual practice'' the true nature, not only of the former colonial powers, but also of the United Nations, of the recently independent countries united in what was called the Afro-Asian bloc, as well as of Moscow".|source= Sociologist [[Ludo De Witte]]{{sfn|De Witte|2002|p=181}}}}
The crisis caused the newly independent African states to reconsider their allegiances and internal ties. In particular, it led to the division of African states into factions. Moderate-leaning states joined the [[Brazzaville Group]], which called for a degree of unity between Francophone African states and the maintenance of ties with France.{{sfn|Turner|2007|p=149}} Radical states joined the [[Casablanca Group]] which called for a Pan-African federation.{{sfn|Turner|2007|p=149}} The chaotic violence of the crisis and the fate of the country's whites, many of whom entered Northern and [[Southern Rhodesia]] as refugees, contributed to the widespread belief among whites there that black nationalist politicians were not ready to govern, and prompted fears that immediate majority rule in Rhodesia might lead to a similar situation. After negotiations with Britain repeatedly broke down, Southern Rhodesia's predominantly white government [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|declared independence unilaterally]] in 1965.{{sfn|Wood|2005|pp=101, 471}}

The Katangese secession would prove to be politically influential in Africa. During the [[Chadian Civil War (1965–79)|Chadian Civil War]] between 1965 and 1979, the ''[[FROLINAT|Front de Libération Nationale du Tchad]]'' (FROLINAT) explicitly rejected secessionism in its bid to remove the southern-backed government of [[François Tombalbaye]] following the experience of the Katanga secession, officially stating that "there will be no Katanga in Chad".{{sfn|Nugent|2004|p=98}} In the [[Nigerian Civil War]], between 1967 and 1970, the [[Igbo people|ethnically Igbo]] region of [[Biafra]] seceded from [[Nigeria]], which it accused of privileging the interests of northern ethnic groups and discriminating against the Igbo. The secessions of Biafra and Katanga have frequently been compared in academic writing.{{sfn|Nugent|2004|p=82}} Unlike Katanga, Biafra achieved limited official international recognition and rejected the support of Western multinational companies involved in the local oil industry. Biafra was defeated in 1970 and re-integrated into Nigeria.{{sfn|Nugent|2004|pp=89, 96–97}}

'''Evacuation Day''' on November 25 marks the day in 1783 when British troops departed from [[History of New York City|New York City]] on [[Manhattan|Manhattan Island]], after the end of the [[American Revolutionary War]]. After this [[British Army]] evacuation, General [[George Washington]] triumphantly led the [[Continental Army]] from his former headquarters, north of the city, across the [[Harlem River]], south down [[Manhattan]], through the town to [[Battery Park|The Battery]] at the foot of Broadway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Toast To Freedom: New York Celebrates Evacuation Day|year=1984|publisher=Fraunces Tavern Museum|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last shot of the war was reportedly fired on this day, as a British gunner fired a cannon at jeering crowds gathered on the shore of [[Staten Island]], as his ship passed through [[the Narrows]] at the mouth of [[New York Harbor]]. The shot fell well short of the shore.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypl.org/branch/staten/index2.cfm?Trg=1&amp;d1=962&amp;template=timeline3 Staten Island on the Web: History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument and flags.jpg|thumb|alt=The column of the Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument, topped by a bronze urn, among trees, with a modern American and POW/MIA flagstaff adjoining.|[[Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument]], [[Wallabout Bay]], [[East River (New York)|East River]], (now [[Fort Greene Park]]), [[History of New York City|New York]]-[[History of Brooklyn|Brooklyn]]]]

Following the devastating losses at the [[Battle of Long Island]] on August 27, 1776, General [[George Washington]] and the [[Continental Army]] retreated across the [[East River (New York)|East River]] by benefit of both a retreat and holding action by well-trained [[Maryland Line]] troops at [[Gowanus Canal|Gowanus Creek and Canal]] and a night fog which obscured the barges and boats evacuating troops to Manhattan Island.&lt;ref&gt;Field, Thomas Warren. ''The Battle of Long Island: With Connected Preceeding Events, and the Subsequent American Retreat'' Long Island Historical Society, 1869, page 250&lt;/ref&gt; On September 15, 1776, the British flag replaced the American atop Fort George, where it was to remain until Evacuation Day.

Washington's Continentals subsequently withdrew north and west out of the town and following the [[Battle of Harlem Heights]] and later action at the river forts of [[Battle of Fort Washington|Fort Washington]] and [[Battle of Fort Lee|Fort Lee]] on the northwest corner of the island along the [[Hudson River]] on November 16, 1776, evacuated [[Manhattan Island]]. They headed north for [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]], fought a delaying action at [[Battle of White Plains|White Plains]], and retreated across New Jersey in the [[New York and New Jersey campaign]].

For the remainder of the [[American Revolutionary War]], much of what is now [[City of Greater New York|Greater New York]] was under [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British control]]. [[History of New York City (1665–1783)|New York City]] (occupying then only the southern tip of Manhattan, up to what is today Chambers Street), became, under [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Admiral of the Fleet Richard Howe, Lord Howe]] and his brother [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|Sir William Howe, General of the British Army]], the British political and military center of operations in [[British America|British North America]]. [[David Mathews]] was [[Mayors of New York City|Mayor of New York]] during the British occupation. Many of the civilians who continued to reside in town were [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]].&lt;ref&gt;Calhoon, Robert M. "Loyalism and neutrality" Chapter 29, p. 235. Greene, Jack P. and Pole, J.R. ''A Companion of the American Revolution'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 21, 1776, the city suffered a [[Great Fire of New York (1776)|devastating fire]] of uncertain origin after the evacuation of Washington's [[Continental Army]] at the beginning of the British Army occupation. With hundreds of houses destroyed, many residents had to live in makeshift housing built from old ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Homberger |first1=Eric|title=The Historical Atlas of New York City, Second Edition: A Visual Celebration of 400 Years of New York City's History|date=2005|publisher=Macmillan |isbn=978-0-8050-7842-8|page=56|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q8EgsHmSEAsC&amp;pg=PA56}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, over 10,000 Patriot soldiers and sailors died through deliberate neglect on [[Prisoners in the American Revolutionary War|prison ships]] in New York waters ([[Wallabout Bay]]) during the British occupation—more Patriots died on these ships than died in every single battle of the war, combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stiles |first=Henry Reed |author-link=Henry Reed Stiles|title=Letters from the Prisons and Prison-ships of the Revolution |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B20FAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |publisher=Thomson Gale (reprint) |date=1865 |isbn=978-1-4328-1222-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dring, Thomas and Greene, Albert.

==Event history==

===British evacuation from New York===
In mid-August 1783, [[Sir Guy Carleton]], then the last [[British Army]] and [[Royal Navy]] commander in the former [[British America|British North America]], received orders from his superiors in London for the evacuation of New York. He informed the President of the [[Confederation Congress]] that he was proceeding with the subsequent withdrawal of refugees, liberated slaves, and military personnel as fast as possible, but that it was not possible to give an exact date because the number of refugees entering the city recently had increased dramatically (more than 29,000 [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] refugees eventually were evacuated from the city).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uelac.org/Loyalist-Ships/Loyalist-Ships.php|title=UELAC.org - Loyalist Ships|website=www.uelac.org|language=en|access-date=August 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Grasso, Dr. Joan S. ''The American Revolution on Long Island'' Arcadia Publishing, 2016, page 110 &lt;/ref&gt; The British also evacuated over 3,000 [[Black Loyalist]]s, former slaves they had liberated from the Americans, to [[Nova Scotia]], East [[Florida]], the [[Caribbean]], and [[London]],&lt;ref&gt; Lanning, Michael Lee. ''African Americans in the Revolutionary War'' page 161.&lt;/ref&gt; and refused to return them to their American slaveholders and overseers as the provisions of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] had required them to do. The [[Black Loyalist#Black Brigade|Black Brigade]] were among the very last to depart.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cCMbE4KKlX4C&amp;pg=PA139|title=Encyclopedia of African American History, 1619-1895: From the Colonial Period to the Age of Frederick Douglass Three-volume Set|last=Finkelman|first=Paul|date=April 6, 2006|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=9780195167771|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carleton gave a final evacuation date of 12:00 noon on November 25, 1783. An anecdote by [[Alexander Anderson (illustrator)|Alexander Anderson]] told of a scuffle between a British officer and the proprietress of a boarding house, as she defiantly raised her own American flag before noon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CmMSAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA235|title=Hours with the Living Men and Women of the Revolution: A Pilgrimage|last=Lossing|first=Benson John|date=1889|publisher=Funk &amp; Wagnalls|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the departure of the British, the city was secured by American troops under the command of General [[Henry Knox]].&lt;ref name=Margino&gt;[http://www.nypl.org/blog/2014/11/24/evacuation-day-new-york-holiday Margino, Megan.

Entry into the city under General [[George Washington]] was delayed until after a British flag which could be seen still flying had been removed: a British [[Union Flag]] had been nailed to a flagpole at [[Fort Amsterdam|Fort George]] on [[The Battery (Manhattan)|the Battery]] at the southern tip of Manhattan as a final act of defiance, and the [[Greasy pole|pole was greased]]. After a number of men attempted to tear down the British colors, wooden cleats were cut and nailed to the pole and, with the help of a ladder, an army veteran, John Van Arsdale, was able to ascend the pole, remove the flag, and replace it with the [[Flag of the United States|Stars and Stripes]] before the British fleet had completely sailed out of sight.{{sfnp|Riker|1883|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8BQvAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA16 pp. 16–18]}}&lt;ref name = "Hood 2004 6"&gt;Hood, C. 2004, p. 6.

===Aftermath===
A week later, on December 4, at [[Fraunces Tavern]], at Pearl and Broad Streets, General Washington formally said farewell to his officers with a short statement, taking each one of his officers and official family by the hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Today in History – December 4: Goodbye to General Washington|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/today-in-history/december-04#goodbye-to-general-washington|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Washington headed south, being cheered and fêted on his way at many stops in [[New Jersey]] and [[Pennsylvania]]. By December 23, he arrived in [[Annapolis, Maryland]], where the [[Confederation Congress]] was then meeting at the [[Maryland State House]] to consider the terms of the Treaty of Paris. At their session in the Old Senate Chamber, he made a short statement and offered his sword and the papers of his commission to the President and the delegates, thereby [[George Washington's resignation as commander-in-chief|resigning as commander-in-chief]].

The British [[Fort Amsterdam|Fort George]] at Bowling Green was demolished in 1790, and in that year the Battery Flagstaff was built on newly reclaimed land on the Battery, called the "churn", operated by William and then Lois Keefe; this was replaced in 1809, and demolished about 1825.

John Van Arsdale is said to have been a regular flag-raiser at the early commemorations.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 

[[Washington Irving]] described a September 1804 visit to the commemorative flagpole, as "The standard of our city, reserved, like a choice handkerchief, for days of gala, hung motionless on the flag-staff, which forms the handle to a gigantic [[Butter churn|churn]]," in his ''A History of New York''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PrFEAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA183|title=A History of New-York, from the Beginning of the World to the End of the Dutch Dynasty: In Two Volumes|last=Irving|first=Washington|date=January 1, 1830|publisher=Carey &amp; Lea|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=183|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Scudder's American Museum]] / [[Barnum's American Museum]] held what it claimed was the original 1783 Evacuation Day flag until the museum's burning in 1865, and flew it on Evacuation Day and the Fourth of July.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=R3MUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA285&amp;lpg=PA285&amp;dq=1783+#v=onepage&amp;q=1783&amp;f=false History of the Flag of the United States of America], p. 285-86 (1880)(reporting that the flag was destroyed in the 1865 fire of Barnum's)&lt;/ref&gt;

Before it was a national holiday, Thanksgiving was proclaimed at various dates by state governors – as early as 1847, New York held Thanksgiving on the same date as Evacuation Day, a convergence happily noted by [[Walt Whitman]], writing in the ''[[Brooklyn Eagle]]''. The observance of the date was also diminished by the [[Thanksgiving Day (United States)|Thanksgiving Day Proclamation]] by 16th President [[Abraham Lincoln]] on October 3, 1863, that called on Americans "in every part of the United States, and also those who are at sea and those who are sojourning in foreign lands, to set apart and observe the last Thursday of November next as a day of thanksgiving."&lt;ref name="lincoln"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Lincoln|first=Abraham|authorlink=Abraham Lincoln|url=http://showcase.netins.net/web/creative/lincoln/speeches/thanks.htm|title=Proclamation of Thanksgiving|date=October 3, 1863|publisher=Abraham Lincoln Online|accessdate=September 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, Thursday fell on November 26.

He said last evening:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;''“Early in June I made an application for permission to raise the flag on the Fourth, and I received a reply from President Clausen, on June 5 giving me permission to participate in the raising of the flag by the employes of the Park Department. Now any tramp can participate in the raising of the flag if he stands by and looks on, and that was the kind of permission that was given to me. If this was not a snub and an insult, I’d like to know what is. When my great-grandfather hauled down the British flag and hoisted the American colors I’d like to know where Mr. Clausen’s great-grandfather was and what he was doing.''&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;''Later even this tramp permission was revoked. To-day I received another letter from Mr. Clausen informing, me that instead of my participating with the Park Department employees in hoisting the flag, that ceremony would be performed by the [[Veteran Corps of Artillery of the State of New York|Veteran Corps of Artillery]], [[Veteran Corps of Artillery of the State of New York|Military Society of the War of 1812]].''&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;''“I saw the hand of [[Asa Bird Gardiner]] behind all this. He tried to do me out of I my privileges before, and he has succeeded now. The Veteran Corps was really wiped out in 1872 and in 1892 Mr. Gardiner was instrumental in organizing the present one. He wanted me and C. B. Riker to join, but we refused.''&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;''In former years the Anderson Post, the Anderson Zouaves, the Anderson Girls, and the Camp Sons of Veterans used to go with me and assist me in the ceremony of raising the flag and now even the tramp permission of participating with employees has been revoked.''&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;''I am going to consult with Mr. Riker about this matter and I shall probably be somewhere near the flag raising Wednesday morning. I think they will hear from me before then.”''&lt;/p&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it appears that neither he nor any Veterans' organization associated with the Van Arsdale-Riker family or the Anderson Zouaves took part in the ceremony after this time. In 1901, Forbes raised the flag at the dedication of [[Bennett Park (New York City)|Bennett Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I6c_AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA232|title=The Church Eclectic|date=1904|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the warming of relations with Britain immediately preceding [[World War I]], the observance all but disappeared.

The [[Sons of the Revolution]] fraternal organization continues to hold an annual 'Evacuation Day Dinner' at [[Fraunces Tavern]].

===21st century and renewed efforts===
Though little celebrated in the previous century, the 225th anniversary of Evacuation Day was commemorated on November 25, 2008, with searchlight displays in New Jersey and New York at key high points.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.nj.com/njv_mark_diionno/2008/11/giant_light_show_to_illuminate.html NJ.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.revolutionarynj.org/newsEvents/revolutionary-war-beacons.php RevolutionaryNJ.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027122223/http://www.revolutionarynj.org/newsEvents/revolutionary-war-beacons.php |date=October 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hvpress.net/news/125/ARTICLE/5692/2008-11-11.html HVpress.net] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723151007/http://www.hvpress.net/news/125/ARTICLE/5692/2008-11-11.html |date=July 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The searchlights are modern commemorations of the bonfires that served as a beacon signal system at many of these same locations during the revolution. The seven New Jersey Revolutionary War sites are Beacon Hill in [[Summit, New Jersey|Summit]],&lt;ref name="beacon"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.beaconhillclub.org/|title=Beacon Hill Club|accessdate=September 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[South Mountain Reservation]] in South Orange, [[Fort Nonsense (Morristown, New Jersey)|Fort Nonsense]] in Morristown, [[Washington Rock State Park|Washington Rock]] in Green Brook, the [[Navesink Twin Lights]], [[Battle of Princeton|Princeton]], and [[Ramapo Mountain State Forest]] near Oakland.

The renaming of a portion of [[Bowling Green (New York City)|Bowling Green]], a street in [[Lower Manhattan]] to Evacuation Day Plaza was proposed by Arthur R. Piccolo, the chairman of the Bowling Green Association, and James S. Kaplan of the Lower Manhattan Historical Society. The proposal was initially turned down by the [[New York City Council]] in 2016 because the Council's rules for street renaming specify that a renamed street must commemorate a person, an organization, or a cultural work. However, with the support of Councilwoman Margaret Chin, and after supporters of the renaming pointed to streets and plazas named after "Do the Right Thing Way", "Diversity Plaza", "Hip Hop Boulevard", and "[[Ragamuffin parade|Ragamuffin Way]]", the council reversed its decision and approved the renaming of the street on February 5, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Plagianos|first1=Irene|title=Bowling Green To Be Co-Named 'Evacuation Day Plaza'|url=https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160210/financial-district/bowling-green-be-co-named-evacuation-day-plaza|agency=www.DNAinfo.com|publisher=DNAinfo.com: Breaking News, Local Neighborhood News|date=February 10, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630180812/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160210/financial-district/bowling-green-be-co-named-evacuation-day-plaza|archivedate=June 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt012916/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6510">'''Explo '72''' was an evangelistic conference sponsored by [[Campus Crusade for Christ]], planned and directed by Paul Eshleman. Explo '72 has been called the most visible event of the 1970s [[Jesus movement]],&lt;ref name="Sabatino_1999"&gt;{{cite book |last=Di Sabatino |first=David |title=The Jesus People Movement: An Annotated Bibliography and General Resource |series=Bibliographies and Indexes in Religious Studies |volume=49 |year=1999 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=[[Westport, CT]] |isbn=0-313-30268-5 |pages=16–17 |chapter=The Spiritual Sixties and the Jesus People Movement }}&lt;/ref&gt; and came to be associated with the same, even though its primary attendees were not directly involved in that movement.&lt;ref name="NYT_19720612"/&gt;

It was held in various locations in [[Dallas, Texas]] from June 12 to June 17, 1972, with a nightly gathering in the [[Cotton Bowl (stadium)|Cotton Bowl]]. Its goal was to gather 100,000 high school and college students together to train them in personal [[evangelism]], with a vision toward world evangelism, and to encourage attendees to seek some form of Christian service career.

==Background==
Attendance at the daytime conference was estimated at 80,000, with about 95% from a white background,&lt;ref name="NW_79_25"/&gt; fewer than 3000 black attendees,&lt;ref name="CYTY_16_20"/&gt; and an international representation of 75 countries.&lt;ref name="LIFE_72_25"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Rallying For Jesus: 80,000 jam Dallas for a Crusade called Explo '72 |date=1972-06-30 |journal=[[Life (magazine)|Life]] |volume=72 |issue=25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these were middle class high school and college students.&lt;ref name="NW_79_25"/&gt;

The daily schedule included evangelism classes and seminars in the daytime, with hands-on exercises in the afternoon. Nightly events at Cotton Bowl features bands, well known preachers,&lt;ref name="NYT_19720612"/&gt; and pro players from various sporting teams.&lt;ref name="CYTY_16_14"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Explo '72: The Long Haul |journal=[[Christianity Today]] |date=1972-04-14 |volume=16 |issue=14 |page=38 |issn=0009-5753}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Billy Graham]] spoke on six different occasions during the event including the final event which was a public, eight-hour-long, [[Christian music festival]] on Saturday, June 17, 1972. Dubbed "The Christian Woodstock", the event drew an estimated attendance between 100,000 and 200,000. ''Newsweek'' described the crowds as being "militant Christians."&lt;ref name="NW_79_25"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Woodward |first=Kenneth L. |title=The Christian Woodstock |page=52 |journal=[[Newsweek]] |volume=79 |issue=25 |date=1972-06-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Featured artists were [[Love Song (band)|Love Song]], [[Larry Norman]], [[Randy Matthews]], [[The Archers (musical group)|The Archers]], [[Children of the Day]], [[Johnny Cash]], and [[Kris Kristofferson]].  The festival was held on a huge open swath of land just north of downtown Dallas that had been cleared for construction of the Woodall Rodgers Freeway.  The excavation for this highway linking Interstate 35 and US75 would forever obliterate the festival site.  Portions of this event were recorded and released on the 1972 album Jesus Sound Explosion.  Included on the album were performances by artists as diverse as Johnny Cash, Andrae Crouch and The Disciples, Willa Dorsey, The Speer Family, and Armageddon Experience.

Many conservative Christian groups were critical of Explo '72 for its ecumenical involvement with both Protestant and Roman Catholic ministries, and for its use of rock music. The event attracted Jesus movement fringe groups, including the [[Children of God (cult)|Children of God]] and the [[Christian World Liberation Front]].&lt;ref name="NYT_19720612"&gt;{{cite news |last=Fiske |first=Edward B. |title=A 'Religious Woodstock' Draws 75,000 |pages=A1, A19.5 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |volume= |issue= |date=1972-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CYTY_16_20"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Plowman |first=Edward E. |title='Godstock' in Big D |journal=[[Christianity Today]] |date=1972-07-07 |volume=16 |issue=20 |pages=31–32 |issn=0009-5753}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
The long-term impact of Explo '72 is difficult to measure. The most obvious and lasting effect was the influence of [[Jesus music]], which would later be more commonly called [[Contemporary Christian Music]]. At least one critic credits the event with spawning the entire [[Christian music industry]].&lt;ref name="JJT_RBW_2000"&gt;{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=John J. |authorlink=John J. Thompson |title=Raised by Wolves |year=2000 |publisher=ECW Press |isbn=978-1-55022-421-4 |pages=79, 147–151, 234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maynard Pittendreigh]], who attended the event as a recent high school graduate, did a limited study when working on his Master of Divinity degree in which he analyzed the long-term effects of large scale evangelistic events.  Gathering information from churches from South Carolina that had sent youth groups to the event, he was able to demonstrate that more than 60% of those participants had entered the ordained ministry, were engaged in theological training, or had become missionaries.

David Hill Scott, writing for the May, 2005, edition of ''[[Christianity Today]]'', documented the effects Explo '72 had on [[Pope John Paul II]].  As a cardinal in Poland, the future Pope was heavily influenced toward evangelistic efforts by Joe Losiak, a Polish American student who had attended Explo '72 and introduced its concepts to Roman Catholic officials in Poland.

[[File:Logotipo Festival Internacional Cervantino - (Guanajuato) 07.JPG|thumbnail|right|Emblem of the festival in the streets of Guanajuato]]
-The '''Festival Internacional Cervantino''' (FIC),  popularly known as ''El Cervantino'', takes place each fall in the [[Guanajuato, Guanajuato|city of Guanajuato]], located in central [[Mexico]].  This is a small colonial-era city with history of having a large cultural scene. The origins of the festival are from the mid 20th century, when short plays by [[Miguel de Cervantes]] called ''[[entremés|entremeses]]'' (singular ''entremés'') were performed in the city’s plazas. In 1972, this was expanded with federal support to include more events to add a more international flavor. Since then, FIC has grown to become the most important international artistic and cultural event in Mexico and [[Latin America]], and one of four major events of its type in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Festival Internacional Cervantino:Visiones de un mismo escenario|last = |first = |publisher = CONACULTA|year = 2012|isbn = |location = Mexico City|pages = 15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sicgob"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sic.gob.mx/ficha.php?table=festival&amp;table_id=335|title= Festival Internacional Cervantino |work= Sistema de Información Cultural |publisher= CONACULTA |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |accessdate=September 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="38th"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundaciontelevisa.org/cultura/festival-internacional-cervantino-38a-edicion-2010.html |title=38 Festival Internacional Cervantino se suma a los festejos del Bicentenario y Centenario de nuestro país |publisher=Fundación Televisa |location=Mexico |trans-title=38th Festival Internacional Cervantino sums up the festivities of the Bicentennial and Centennial of our country |language=Spanish |accessdate=September 10, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110702065438/http://www.fundaciontelevisa.org/cultura/festival-internacional-cervantino-38a-edicion-2010.html |archivedate=July 2, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="acercade"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festivalcervantino.gob.mx/Facebook/About |title=Acerca del Festival Internacional Cervantino 2011 |publisher=Festival Internacional Cervantino |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=About the Festival International Cervantino 2011 |accessdate=September 10, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926022411/http://www.festivalcervantino.gob.mx/Facebook/About |archivedate=September 26, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a member of the [[European Festivals Association]] and the [[Asian Association of Theater Festivals]]&lt;ref name="sicgob"/&gt; In addition to government support, there are also private sponsors such as [[Telmex]], [[Televisa]] and [[Microsoft]].&lt;ref name="38th"/&gt;

The city of Guanajuato, where the Festival takes place, has historically had a large cultural scene in relation to its size. The richness of the mines in colonial times started a tradition of theaters and other cultural venues to satisfy the desires of the middle and upper classes. The city has a tradition of hosting musical, theatrical and dance events not only in its numerous theaters but also in its many small plazas with benches.&lt;ref name="ficmexconnect"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/623-the-festival-internacional-cervantino-in-guanajuato |title= The Festival Internacional Cervantino in Guanajuato |first=Ana |last=Cervantes |date=January 1, 2001 |publisher=Mexconnect newsletter |issn=1028-9089 |accessdate=September 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, Enrique Ruelas of the [[University of Guanajuato]] began to put on an annual event called the Entremeses de Miguel de Cervantes Saaevedra, short plays written by the author of [[Don Quixote]]. These plays are still part of the annual Festival. In 1972, he founded the Coloquio Cervantino from June to September to expand the annual Entremeses event.&lt;ref name="acercade" /&gt;  Ruelas's efforts came to the attention of the federal government through actress [[Dolores del Río]]. While in the city of Guanajuato, she came across the Entremeses being performed at the Plaza San Roque and was fascinated.  Around the same time, former president [[Luis Echeverría]] had attended cultural festivals in Europe and was interested in doing something similar in Mexico. Through Echeverría's cousin, Del Río relayed what she had seen in Guanajuato.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Festival Internacional Cervantino: Visiones de un mismo escenario|last = |first = |publisher = CONACULTA|year = 2012|isbn = |location = Mexico City|pages = 31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; The federal government then established the foundation for an international cultural festival, originally proposing it for [[Acapulco]]. However, the tradition of the Entremeses was the main reason why Guanajuato was eventually chosen, meshing the two ideas to produce the modern event for the first time in 1972 with performances by artists from fourteen countries including Mexico. For this reason, this year is considered the foundation of the event.&lt;ref name="acercade"/&gt;

The Festival in its current form was a governmental effort, with the 1972 edition attracting interest solely because of the influence of the politicians promoting it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Festival Internacional Cervantino: Visiones de un mismo escenario|last = |first = |publisher = CONACULTA|year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = 19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Cervantino had its greatest growth from 1976 to 1982, during the presidency of [[José López Portillo]] because of the efforts of his wife, Carmen Romano, who promoted it abroad.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Festival Internacional  Cervantino: Visiones de un mismo escenario|last = |first = |publisher = CONACULTA|year = 2012|isbn = |location = Mexico City|pages = 15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It quickly gained the attention of noted artists, with Berlin Philharmonic director [[Herbert von Karajan]] offering to appear at no cost.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Initially the city of Guanajuato had difficulties in hosting the event due to the lack of infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Festival Internacional Cervantino:Visiones de un mismo escenario|last = |first = |publisher = CONACULTA|year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = 16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elizabeth II]] and the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]] attended the event in 1975.  By decree, an organizing committee was set up in 1976 under the Secretaría de Educación Pública, the state and city of Guanajuato and the University of Guanajuato to invite artists from Mexico and abroad. Some of the first invited by this committee were [[Mario Moreno Cantinflas]] and [[Dolores del Río]]. This committee is still in charge today, working with the [[Consejo Nacional para la Cultura y las Artes]], el [[Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes]] and the Instituto de Cultura de [[Guanajuato]]. In 1978, [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos]] and [[Queen Sofía of Spain|Sofía of Spain]] attended as guests of honor.&lt;ref name="acercade" /&gt;

Initially, the city of Guanajuato was only the host, with local artistic groups not participating in the event. However, efforts were soon made to lobby for their inclusion, especially by the Universidad de Guanajuato, and now artists from this university and other parts of the city and state regularly appear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Festival Internacional Cervantino:Visiones de un mismo escenario|last = |first = |publisher = CONACULTA|year = 2012|isbn = |location = Mexico City|pages = 96–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s to the present===
Since 1982, the festival has diminished somewhat in size, mostly because of reduced funding. Another issue that arose was that the festival had become very popular with backpackers, who slept in the streets and caused problems for local residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Festival Internacional Cervantino: Visiones de un mismo escenario|last = |first = |publisher = CONACULTA|year = 2012|isbn = |location = Mexico City|pages = 51}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it remained a very important event, attracting notable acts and up to 140 journalists to cover it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Festival Internacional Cervantino: Visiones de un mismo escenario|last = |first = |publisher = CONACULTA|year = 2012|isbn = |location = Mexico City|pages = 102}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, these included [[Lazar Berman]], [[Mercedes Sosa]], the [[New York Philharmonic]], [[Joan Baez]], [[Gilbert Bécaud]], [[Mario Lavista]], [[Guillermo Velázquez]], [[Los Leones de la Sierra de Xichú]], the [[National Ballet of Canada]], [[Alwin Nikolais|Nikolais Dance Theater]], the [[Bolshoi Ballet]], [[Sankai Juku]], [[Theater Scena STU]] (Poland) and the [[Marionette Theatre of Hungary]].&lt;ref name="acercade"/&gt;

In 1989, the city became a [[World Heritage Site]] which allowed most of the city’s colonial and late 19th-century architecture, including its theatres, to be restored.&lt;ref name="ficmexconnect"/&gt;

During the 1990s, the festival featured acts such as the [[Guitar Trio of Amsterdam]], [[Voices of Change]], the [[Vienna Quintet]], [[Guadalupe Pineda]], [[Krzysztof Jakowicz]], [[Krystyna Borucinska]], [[Kronos Quartet]], [[Madredeus]], the [[Open Theater of Belgrade]], the [[Lindsay Kemp]] Company and the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]].&lt;ref name="acercade"/&gt;

In the 2000s, the custom of having Mexican states and foreign countries and regions as “special guests” began. In 2001, the invited region was [[Oceania]] along with [[Veracruz]]. Acts featured during those years included [[Hélène Grimaud]], [[Eugenio Toussaint]], [[Juan Fornell and Los Van Van]], the [[Vienna Symphony|Vienna Symphony Virtuosi]], [[Enrique Bunbury]], [[Los Tigres del Norte]], [[Panteón Rococó]], [[Meno Fortas]] and [[Les 7 doigts de la main]].&lt;ref name="acercade"/&gt;

The city was declared the Cervantino Capital of America in 2005, which prompted the federal government to issue a commemorative silver coin.&lt;ref name="acercade"/&gt;

However, problems with the lack of funds and organizational issues brought the event to a crisis by 2006. There were structural and financial changes made during the rest of that decade, and by 2010, the Festival was able to recuperate much of its former status, attracting major artists from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Festival Internacional Cervantino: Visiones de un mismo escenario|last = |first = |publisher = CONACULTA|year = |isbn = |location = Mexico City|pages = 51–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, problems with large crowds of mostly young people, drinking in public remains a problem, especially for the local populace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Festival Internacional Cervantino:Visiones de un mismo escenario|last = |first = |publisher = CONACULTA|year = 2012|isbn = |location = Mexico City|pages = 69–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 38th edition of the Festival in 2010 was dedicated to [[Celebration of Mexican political anniversaries in 2010|Mexico’s Bicentennial of Independence and Centennial of the Revolution]]. Three states, [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Michoacán]] and [[Querétaro]], along with three countries, [[Argentina]], [[Colombia]] and [[Chile]], were the special guests as they celebrated their bicentennials in the same year.&lt;ref name="acercade" /&gt; The 2010 version had 3,161 artists from 31 countries, with special emphasis on traditional Mexican music and dance.&lt;ref name="38th" /&gt;

The 2011 version brought together 2,800 artists from 29 countries, in genres such as classical and folk music to [[techno]], open-air theatre, expositions, recent plays and other works from the 20th century by well-known writers.&lt;ref name="farenheit"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fahrenheitmagazine.com/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=1930:festival-internacional-cervantino-2011&amp;lang=es |title=Festival Internacional Cervantino 2011 |date=June 22, 2011 |publisher=Fahrenheit Magazine |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |accessdate=September 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is dedicated to the environment, with a theme of “The Gifts of Nature” and special guests [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[Sweden]], [[Norway]] and [[Nayarit]].&lt;ref name="anunican"&gt;{{cite news |title= Anuncian en Guanajuato programa del Festival Cervantino 2011  |url= http://www.informador.com.mx/cultura/2011/301663/6/anuncian-en-guanajuato-programa-del-festival-cervantino-2011.htm |newspaper=El Informador |location=Guadalajara, Mexico |date=June 22, 2011 |accessdate=September 10, 2011 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Announce in Guanajuato the program of the Festival Cervantino 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="noruegaen"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.noruega.org.mx/News_and_events/Cervantino-2011/Noruega-en-el-Festival-Cervantino-2011/ |title= Noruega en el Festival Cervantino |year=2011 |publisher= Embajada Real de Noruega en México |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Norway at the Festival Cervantino |accessdate=September 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists include The [[Oslo Camerata]], [[Geir Henning Braaten]], [[Knut Reiersrud]], [[Mari Boine]],&lt;ref name="noruegaen" /&gt; a dramatization of ''[[Il Postino]]'' by [[Pablo Neruda]],&lt;ref name="ilpostino"&gt;{{cite news |title= El Cervantino rendirá homenaje a Daniel Catán con la obra Il Postino |url= http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/cultura/66318.html |newspaper=El Universal |location=Mexico City |date=September 6, 2011 |accessdate=September 10, 2011 |language=Spanish |trans-title=The Cervantino pay homage to Daniel Catán with the work Il Postino }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Saint Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra]] focusing on 19th century Russian music, especially [[Tchaikovsky]],&lt;ref name="orqsanpete"&gt;{{cite news |title= La Orquesta de San Petersburgo viene al Cervantino |url= http://eleconomista.com.mx/entretenimiento/2011/09/07/orquesta-san-petersburgo-viene-cervantino |agency=Notimex |newspaper=El Economista |location=Mexico City |date=September 7, 2011 |accessdate=September 10, 2011 |language=Spanish |trans-title=The Orchestra of Saint Petersburg comes to the Cervantino }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="musicarusa"&gt;{{cite news |title= Música rusa presente en el Festival Cervantino |url= http://www.aztecanoticias.com.mx/notas/cultura/70665/musica-rusa-presente-en-el-festival-cervantino |newspaper=Azteca Noticias |location=Mexico City |date=September 7, 2011 |accessdate=September 10, 2011 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Russian music present at the Festival Cervantino }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[DeMUG Baroque Ensemble]], and an exhibition of [[Oaxaca]]n painter [[Francisco Toledo]] in the Museo del Pueblo.&lt;ref name="mostraran"&gt;{{cite news |title= Mostrarán en Festival Cervantino de Guanajuato obras inéditas de Toledo |url= http://www.e-oaxaca.mx/noticias/oaxaca-en-la-red/6012-mostraran-en-festival-cervantino-de-guanajuato-obras-ineditas-de-toledo.html |agency=La Jornada |newspaper=e-Oaxaca Noticias |location=Oaxaca |date=August 19, 2011 |accessdate=September 10, 2011 |language=Spanish |trans-title=The Festival Cervantino of Guanajuato will show unedited Works by Toledo}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 event cost 122 million pesos to set up, with most of the money coming from [[CONACULTA]] and the rest from the state of [[Guanajuato]], the [[University of Guanajuato]] and the [[Guanajuato, Guanajuato|city of Guanajuato]].&lt;ref name="anunican" /&gt;

The 2014 performance was opened by [[taiko]] drumming group [[Tokyo Dagekidan]], a performance attended by Japan's Prince [[Fumihito, Prince Akishino|Fumihito Akishino]] and his wife [[Kiko, Princess Akishino|Kiko]].&lt;ref name=guardiola&gt;{{cite news |author= Andrés Guardiola |title= Percusiones niponas y luz en el cielo inauguran el Cervantino |newspaper=Excelsior |location=Mexico City |date=October 9, 2014 |url= http://www.excelsior.com.mx/expresiones/2014/10/09/986059|accessdate=April 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=efenews&gt;{{cite news |title= Arranca Festival Cervantino con presencia del príncipe de Japón, Akishino: MÉXICO CERVANTINO |newspaper=EFE News Service |location=Madrid |date=October 9, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The events happen in the forty nine theatres, plazas and other venues in the city, with satellite events in other plazas in the state and other cities in the country.&lt;ref name="38th"/&gt; The Festival in the city of Guanajuato takes advantage of these numerous venues, indoor and outdoor which include the [[Teatro Juárez]], the [[Teatro Principal (Guanajuato)|Teatro Principal]], the [[Cervantes Theater|Teatro Cervantes]], the Patio of the Faculty of Industrial Relations, the State Auditorium, the Plaza San Roque, the Esplanade of the [[Alhóndiga de Granaditas|Alhondiga]], the [[Teatro de Minas]], the [[La Valenciana Church (San Cayetano)|Valenciana Church]] and the [[Ex-Hacienda of San Gabriel de Barrera]]. In addition, seven museum spaces are used for exhibitions such as those of photography.&lt;ref name="ficmexconnect"/&gt;

The event represents a tourist and economic windfall for the city, which brought in 423 million pesos in 2010, a 57% increase over 2009 with hotel occupancy alone up 39%. The total number of visitors in 2010 is estimated at 179,000, with 463,000 tickets to events sold. In addition to the events in Guanajuato proper, there were another 125,000 attendees to related activities in 37 cities and seventeen states in Mexico.&lt;ref name="derrama"&gt;{{cite news |title= Creció derrama económica del Festival Internacional Cervantino |url= http://www.elporvenir.com.mx/notas.asp?nota_id=444468 |newspaper=El Porvenir |location=Mexico City |date=November 8, 2010 |accessdate=September 10, 2011 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Economic windfall from the Festival Internacional Cervantino grew }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of events==
Being named after Spanish writer [[Miguel de Cervantes]], the Festival has a special emphasis on artistic creations in the Spanish language, with the original tradition of performing this writer’s “entremeses” plays upheld by the University Theater of Guanajuato. The international aspect is to create a space for discovery and exchange.&lt;ref name="sicgob"/&gt; The [[Ballet Folklorico de Mexico]] under [[Amalia Hernández]] has performed every year since the beginning.&lt;ref name="acercade"/&gt; Acts have been booked from all parts of the world of a wide variety from classical music, Mexican folk dance, [[Chinese variety art|Chinese acrobats]] and more.&lt;ref name="ficmexconnect"/&gt; The event attracts artists from all over the world each year in order to present typical aspects of culture from each country.&lt;ref name="acercade"/&gt; Acts include those from genres such as opera, music, dance, theatre, street spectaculars, visual arts, film and literature along with various academic events.&lt;ref name="farenheit"/&gt; The Festival has an agreement with the [[MUTEK|MUTEK Festival of Montreal]] with the aim of presenting newer acts to the audiences in Mexico especially in the field of electronic music.&lt;ref name="38th"/&gt;

==Other aspects==
In 2010, the Presea FIC was instituted to recognize the work of Mexican and foreign artists for their contributions to culture. The prize is symbolized by a statue designed by Vicente Rojo, which is awarded during the opening ceremonies. The first was awarded to [[Luis Herrera de la Fuente]].&lt;ref name="acercade"/&gt;&lt;ref name="farenheit"/&gt;

To promote a link between culture and technology, the Festival and Microsoft México sponsor a Technology Pavilion at the Mesón de San Antonio. It is planned to contain an Internet café with large lounge chairs and wireless services for those with mobile devices.&lt;ref name="tecnologia"&gt;{{cite news |title= El Festival Cervantino presenta pabellón tecnológico |url= http://www.informador.com.mx/cultura/2010/241997/6/el-festival-cervantino-presenta-pabellon-tecnologico.htm |newspaper=El Informador |location=Guadalajara, Mexico |date=October 17, 2010 |accessdate=September 10, 2011 |language=Spanish |trans-title=The Festival Cervantino presents technology pavilion }}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft sponsors a set of academic lectures about what’s new in technology and art, games and everyday life.&lt;ref name="jovenes"&gt;{{cite press release |title= El Festival Internacional Cervantino centra su mirada en actividades dedicadas a los jóvenes |publisher=CONACULTA |date=August 3, 2011 |url= http://www.conaculta.gob.mx/sala_prensa_detalle.php?id=14798 |language=Spanish |trans-title=The Festival Internacional Cervantino centers its gaze in activities for youth |accessdate=September 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the festival is set up to attract young people from children to university age.  The Cervantino Program for Youth sponsors programs for this age group as well as other activities.&lt;ref name="jovenes"/&gt;  It has an annual Artistic Creativity Contest for Youth put on in collaboration with the [[Edinburgh International Festival]] and [[The Anglo Mexican Foundation]].&lt;ref name="presentan"&gt;{{cite news |title= Presentan el programa del festival Cervantino dedicado a los jóvenes |url= http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2011/08/04/cultura/a06n3cul |newspaper=La Jornada |location=Mexico City |date=August 4, 2011 |page=6 |accessdate=September 10, 2011 |language=Spanish |trans-title=The program of the Festival Cervantino dedicated to youth is presented}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two activities in 2010 were a contest of photos taken with cell phones and another contest of short electronic music pieces, both of which were launched over the Internet. Winners received trips to the [[Edinburgh International Festival]], the first and largest international cultural event of its type in the world.&lt;ref name="38th"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jovenes"/&gt; A number of performers and academic activities are scheduled with young audiences in mind. These include rock and electronic music concerts with dance and theater events. In 2011, these included German electronic music groups [[Moonbootica]] and [[Schlachthofbronx]] sponsored by the [[Goethe Institute]] and rock musicians [[Sierra León]], [[Finde]], [[El Otro Yo]] and [[Rubick]] .&lt;ref name="jovenes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="presentan"/&gt;  Theatre for youth include [[Vivarium Studio]] performing L éffet de Serge, [[Mauricio García Lozano]] and [[Teatro Farfullero]] presenting La pequeña habitación al final de la escalera and [[Circo Aereo]] and [[Les Objets Volants]], a [[Finns|Finnish]]/French group with acrobats, comedians and other circus performers.

In 2011, the Festival scheduled its first Art Book Fair, focusing on books about the visual and theatrical arts.&lt;ref name="farenheit"/&gt;

Based on the program sponsored by the [[Lucerne Festival]], the Cervantino Academy’s purpose is to train professional level instrumentalists in classical and contemporary music.&lt;ref name=42nd&gt;{{cite book |title= Programa 42nd Festival Internacional Cervantino |year=2014 |publisher= Secretaría de Educación Pública, State of Guanajuato and CONACULTA |page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aflores&gt;{{cite news |author=Alondra Flores |title= Jóvenes músicos reciben clases magistrales de célebres invitados al festival Cervantino |newspaper=La Jornada |location=Mexico City |date=October 17, 2014 |page=6 |url= http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2014/10/17/cultura/a06n1cul |accessdate=March 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The program sponsors individual students, classes, workshops, practice sessions and concerts, including at the Festival Cervantino, both by small ensembles as well as in an orchestra.

The program has invited maestros from both Mexico and abroad, including [[Irvine Arditti]], [[Steve Schick]], [[Norio Sato]] and [[Salvatore Sciarrino]].&lt;ref name=42nd/&gt;&lt;ref name=aflores/&gt;&lt;ref name=reforzar&gt;{{cite news |title= El Cervantino busca reforzar repertorio contemporáneo con Academia |newspaper=El Informador |location=Guadalajara |date=October 11, 2014 |url= http://www.informador.com.mx/cultura/2014/553394/6/el-cervantino-busca-reforzar-repertorio-contemporaneo-con-academia.htm |accessdate=March 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The program attracts students from various countries in Latin America, including [[Guatemala]], Brazil, Cuba, and [[Bolivia]] as well as Mexico.&lt;ref name=aflores/&gt;&lt;ref name=reforzar/&gt;

==Festival events for audiences outside of Guanajuato==
Prior Festival events and shows related to artists scheduled to perform in upcoming festivals are shown through the Festival’s television, radio and website. A channel called TV FIC or Canal Cervantino was created on channel 157 of [[Cablevision (Mexico)|Cablevision]] to broadcast archived footage of past festivals and performances by those scheduled to perform the upcoming year.&lt;ref name="38th"/&gt;&lt;ref name="acercade"/&gt; [[Microsoft]] sponsors the Festival’s web page as well as an online radio station called Radio FIC which offers online archives of music, video and photographic works, as well as a various types of informative material.&lt;ref name="38th"/&gt;

Most of the events related to the Festival occur in Guanajuato, but some events such as dance, plays and concerts are presented live or are transmitted to other areas of the country. These include national and international acts.&lt;ref name=balvarez&gt;{{cite news |author=Benjamin Alvarez |title= Más allá de Guanajuato |newspaper=Terra Noticias |url= http://deportes.terra.com.mx/mas-alla-de-guanajuato,aa166cfb8ebf8410VgnCLD200000b2bf46d0RCRD.html |accessdate=March 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=criterio&gt;{{cite news|title=Festival Cervantino llegará a todos los estados del país |newspaper=Criterio |location=Hidalgo |date=October 11, 2014 |url=http://www.criteriohidalgo.com/notas.asp?id=269173 |accessdate=March 15, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402103234/http://www.criteriohidalgo.com/notas.asp?id=269173 |archivedate=April 2, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Más Allá de Guanajuato (Beyond Guanajuato) program to bring Cervantino cultural events to other parts of the country, free to the public.

The Ruelos Project, named after the founder of the Entremeses Cervantinos, was created in 2014 to pair artists with disadvantaged communities. The Festival provides logistical support but the actors and support staff are locals with that thirty participants in each event.&lt;ref name="42nd p128–129}"&gt;{{cite book |title= Programa 42nd Festival Internacional Cervantino |year=2014 |publisher= Secretaría de Educación Pública, State of Guanajuato and CONACULTA |pages=128–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project is based on the original Entremeses Cervantinos done by Enrique Ruelos starting in the 1950s which relied on community participation to produce plays such as those by Shakespeare but modified to the local culture. The performances are planned and executed with communities where there are high levels of crime and family instability and violence, mostly in the state of Guanajuato.&lt;ref name=createatro&gt;{{cite news |author=Sonia Avila |title= El Festival Internacional Cervantino crea teatro comunitario |newspaper=Excelsior |location=Mexico City |date=April 29, 2014 |url= http://www.excelsior.com.mx/expresiones/2014/04/29/956368  |accessdate=March 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have also worked with prison populations.&lt;ref name=cereso&gt;{{cite news |title= Internos del Cereso escenifican a Hamlet |newspaper= Union Guanajuato/El Universal |location=Guanajuato/Mexico City |date=October 24, 2014 |url= http://www.unionguanajuato.mx/articulo/2014/10/24/cultura/internos-del-cereso-escenifican-hamlet  |accessdate=March 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Folly Theatre''' was a [[London]] theatre of the late 19th century, in William IV Street, near [[Charing Cross]], in the [[City of Westminster]]. It was converted from the house of a religious order, and became a small theatre, with a capacity of 900 seated and standing. The theatre specialised in presenting [[music hall]], [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]] and [[opera bouffe]]. The [[Beefsteak Club]] had quarters above the theatre.

As a stock company, under the direction first of Alexander Henderson and [[Lydia Thompson]] and then of [[John Lawrence Toole]], the theatre was significant for beginning the professional careers of many [[Victorian era]] actors, writers and actor-managers. The theatre was demolished in 1895, possibly due to disturbance caused to the neighbouring [[Charing Cross Hospital]].

==History==

===Early years===
The building opened as the ''Lowther Rooms''&lt;ref&gt;Named for the nearby popular ''Lowther Arcade'', a covered market for fancy goods, some 250 feet long and considered at that time ''one of the sights of London'' in [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=45140 ''Charing Cross, the railway stations, and Old Hungerford Market'', Old and New London: Volume 3 (1878), pp. 123-134] accessed: 16 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; in 1840. It was the residence of the ''[[Oratory of Saint Philip Neri|Fathers of the London Oratory of St. Philip Neri]]'' from 1848–56 and was used for lectures.  Here, in 1850, [[John Henry Newman]] delivered his ''Lectures on Anglican Difficulties'', after his conversion to Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newmanreader.org/works/anglicans/volume1/index.html ''Certain Difficulties Felt by Anglicans in Catholic Teaching'' John Henry Newman] accessed 11 Oct 2007&lt;/ref&gt; On the departure of the religious order, which moved to the ''[[Brompton Oratory]]'', the hall became ''Woodin's Polygraphic Hall'' in 1855, where William S. Woodin gave monologue entertainments.&lt;ref name=Lloyd&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Toole.htm ''Toole's Theatre-Polygraphic Hall-Charing Cross Theatre-The Folly'' (Arthur Lloyd)] accessed 11 Oct 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1869, the building was converted to a small [[Music hall]] and playhouse called the ''Royal Charing Cross Theatre'' and, in 1872 was renamed the '''Charing Cross Theatre''' and was advertised as the Theatre Royal, Charing Cross, in 1874-75.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianlondon.org/entertainment/follytheatre.htm "Victorian London - Entertainment and Recreation" from VictorianLondon.org] accessed 11 Oct 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  The theatre opened on 19 June 1869 with [[W. S. Gilbert]]'s  [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]] of ''[[Norma (opera)|Norma]]'', called ''[[The Pretty Druidess]]'', on the bill,&lt;ref name=Druidess&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/other_gilbert/pretty_druidess/review.html Review of the theatre's opening night,] ''[[The Times]]'' (republished at the Gilbert and Sullivan Archive)&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1870 it held Gilbert and [[Frederic Clay]]'s ''[[The Gentleman in Black]]''.  In 1872, it hosted J. S. Clarke's revival of [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan|Sheridan]]'s ''[[The Rivals]]'', featuring Mrs Stirling in the role that was to make her famous as ''[[Mrs Malaprop]]''.&lt;ref name=theatre&gt;[http://www.victorianweb.org/mt/theaters/pva234.html ''Theatres in Victorian London'' Philip V. Allingham (The Victorian Web)] accessed 11 Oct 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  The name ''[[Charing Cross Music Hall]]'' was also adopted in the late 1880s by the brothers Carlo and Giovanni Gatti for their ''Gatti's-Under-the-Arches Music hall''.  This became the Hungerford Music Hall in 1883, later returning to the former name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collectbritain.co.uk/personalisation/object.cfm?uid=014EVA000000000U04008000 ''Advertisement for the Grand Star Company for Xmas at the Charing Cross Music Hall'' Collect Britain (British Library)] accessed 11 Oct 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Folly Theatre===
After some rebuilding, by architect [[Thomas Verity]], the theatre was renamed ''The Folly Theatre'' in 1876, when it was bought by Alexander Henderson, and it became a [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]] house, with his wife, [[Lydia Thompson]], in the lead roles. The first piece was a successful burlesque of ''Blue Beard''.&lt;ref&gt;Gänzl, Kurt. ''Lydia Thompson, Queen of Burlesque'' (2002) Routledge {{ISBN|0-415-93766-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1877, ''Up the River, or the Strict Kew-Tea'', by [[H. B. Farnie]] and [[Robert Reece]] played at the theatre&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.operetta-research-center.org/main.php?task=archart&amp;cat=4&amp;sub_cat=10&amp;id=00090 Information from the Operetta Research Center] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727081746/http://www.operetta-research-center.org/main.php?task=archart&amp;cat=4&amp;sub_cat=10&amp;id=00090 |date=27 July 2011 }} accessed 11 Oct 2007&lt;/ref&gt; as did a Farnie and Reece adaptation of Offenbach called ''The Creole''.&lt;ref name=Adams&gt;Adams, William Davenport. ''A Dictionary of the Drama (1904)'' 1904 Chatto &amp; Windus, London&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1878, the theatre had a tremendous success with [[Violet Cameron]] in [[Robert Planquette]]'s ''[[Les cloches de Corneville]]'', adapted by Farnie and Reece, which (after transferring to the [[Globe Theatre (Newcastle Street)|Globe Theatre]] and returning to the Folly), held the record for long runs in [[musical theatre]] for a decade. [[Florence St. John]] got her start in the piece on tour and then in the theatre. Farnie and Reece's burlesque ''Stars and Garters'' then played. Reece's successful burlesque, ''Carmen; or Sold for a Song'', and [[Sydney Grundy]]'s ''After Long Years'' both played at the theatre in 1879.  [[T. W. Roberton]]'s ''Dublin Bay'' played here in 1880.&lt;ref name=Adams/&gt; The theatre was described in ''[[Charles Dickens, Jr.|Dickens Dictionary of London]]'' (1879) as ''A little bandbox of a place, very prettily fitted up, and with a decided speciality for burlesque and opera bouffe''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianlondon.org/entertainment/follytheatre.htm Charles Dickens (Jr.), ''Dickens's Dictionary of London'', 1879] accessed 11 Oct 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Farr Florence.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Florence Farr]] at the theatre]]
On 7 November 1879, [[John Lawrence Toole]] (1830-1906) took over the management, with a stock company.  Presentations included [[farces]], burlesques and travesties of popular plays, beginning with [[Henry James Byron|H. J. Byron]]'s ''A Fool and His Money''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1_MgAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA118&amp;lpg=PA118&amp;dq=%22toole's+theatre%22+london&amp;source=web&amp;ots=RswaSeZitb&amp;sig=1nXzaz8MkEHRr1BPfdbu6LkOdb0 MacMichael, J.

He spent much of the next few years touring, but also produced plays at the theatre, including [[Arthur Wing Pinero]]'s ''Hester's Mystery'' (1880) and Byron's ''Upper Crust and Auntie'' (1880),&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1880/04/26/98896595.pdf NY Times review of ''The Upper Crust and Auntie'' 26 April 1880] accessed 11 Oct 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Dion Boucicault]]'s play, ''Dot'', starring Toole, was produced here in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.kent.ac.uk/library/special/Programmes/boucprog.htm Information from the play's programme] accessed 11 Oct 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toole's Theatre===
In 1882, after further rebuilding, Toole re-opened the theatre as '''Toole's Theatre''', becoming the first actor to have a [[West End theatre]] named after him.&lt;ref name=Timesobit&gt;Obituary: John Lawrence Toole, ''[[The Times]]'', 31 July 1906, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;  Noted actress [[Florence Farr]] (1860-1917) began her professional career with an apprenticeship at Toole's theatre, débuting with a juvenile role in Byron's ''Uncle Dick's Darling'', in 1882.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://drum.umd.edu/dspace/handle/1903/1530 | author = Boisseau, Robin Jackson | title = The Women of the Abbey Theatre, 1879-1925 | publisher = University of Maryland | date = 2004-05-05 | accessdate = 2007-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1883, ''Stage Dora; or, Who Killed Cock Robin'', a burlesque by [[F. C. Burnand]] of Sardou's ''Fédora'', premiered at Toole's, starring Toole.  Burnand's ''Paw Claudian'' (1884) was a burlesque of the 1883 costume (Byzantine) drama 'Claudian' by Henry Herman and W. G. Wills.  ''Mr. Guffin’s Elopement'' and ''The Great Tay-Kin'', two shows with words by [[Arthur Law (playwright)|Arthur Law]] and music by [[George Grossmith]], starring Toole, played at the theatre in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grossmith|first=George|year=1888|title=A Society Clown: Reminiscences|location=Bristol/London|publisher=Arrowsmith}} Chapter 8 [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/books/grossmith/gg08.html Available online here]&lt;/ref&gt;  The last play by [[John Maddison Morton]] to be produced in his lifetime, a three-act farcical comedy called ''Going It'', played at Toole's in 1885 and kept the house in a continual roar of laughter.&lt;ref&gt;[[Clement Scott|Scott, Clement]], "Biographical Introduction" to [[John Maddison Morton|Morton, John Maddison]], ''Plays for Home Performance''. London: Ward, Lock and Co., 1889, p. xiv.&lt;/ref&gt; Pinero's ''Girls and Boys'' played here in 1885, as did ''[[Billee Taylor]]'' in  1886 and ''The Butler'', by [[Herman Charles Merivale]], starring Toole, also in 1886. ''Pepita'', an operetta by [[Charles Lecocq]], premiered at the theatre in 1888.  ''The Don'', by Merivale, also starred Toole in 1888.&lt;ref name=Adams/&gt;

[[File:Bungalowtoole.jpg|left|350px]]''The Bungalow'', by Fred Horner, played at the theatre in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.21citizen.org.uk/catalogues/evanion/results.asp?key=Toole's+Theatre&amp;source=showlist.asp&amp;type=Heading&amp;searchtype=&amp;id=234 Notices and posters for Toole's Theatre pieces]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ibsen's Ghost'', a one-act parody on ''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]'', starring [[Irene Vanbrugh]] and Toole, was [[J. M. Barrie]]'s first London play, running for just 27 performances at Toole's Theatre from 30 May 1891. In 1892, Toole directed the première of Barrie's first hit play, ''Walker, London'', which ran for 497 performances.&lt;ref name=Pan&gt;[http://www.c20th.com/ppjmbarrie.htm Peter Pan exhibition site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070220200635/http://www.c20th.com/ppjmbarrie.htm |date=20 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toole retired in 1893, due to increasing ill health, brought on by the deaths within a few years of his family.  His last piece was ''Thoroughbred'' by Ralph Lumley, and upon his retirement [[Rutland Barrington]] replaced him in the role.&lt;ref&gt;Barrington, Rutland (1908).  ''Rutland Barrington: A Record of 35 Years' Experience on the English Stage, By Himself'', p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;  The theatre was taken over by [[Violet Melnotte]], who had made her début at the Folly Theatre in October 1876 as ''Fezz'' in ''[[Bluebeard]]'' with Lydia Thompson's Company.  She had many interests and at the same time was building the [[Duke of York's Theatre]], with her husband [[Frank Wyatt (singer)|Frank Wyatt]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/whowaswho/M/MelnotteViolet.htm ''Violet Melnotte (1855-1935)'' D'Oyly Carte, Who Was Who (Boise State University)] accessed 11 Oct 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The lease expired in 1895 and plans were drawn up by [[Charles J. Phipps|C. J. Phipps]] to  rebuild the theatre, but they were opposed, apparently because the noise at the theatre disturbed patients at the [[Charing Cross Hospital]].&lt;ref name=Lloyd/&gt;  The theatre was demolished in 1896&lt;ref&gt;Earl, John and Michael Sell.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10893">[[File:Hen chicken.jpg|thumb|Forced molting typically involves the removal of food and/or water from poultry for an extended period of time to reinvigorate egg-laying.]]
'''Forced molting''', sometimes known as '''induced molting''', is the practice by some poultry industries of artificially provoking a flock to [[Molting|molt]] simultaneously, typically by withdrawing food for 7–14 days and sometimes also withdrawing water for an extended period.  Forced molting is usually implemented when egg-production is naturally decreasing toward the end of the first egg-laying phase.  During the forced molt, the birds cease producing eggs for at least two weeks, which allows the bird's reproductive tracts to regress and rejuvenate. After the molt, the hen's egg production rate usually peaks slightly lower than the previous peak, but egg quality is improved. The purpose of forced molting is therefore to increase egg production, egg quality, and profitability of flocks in their second or subsequent laying phases, by not allowing the hen's body the necessary time to rejuvenate during the natural cycle of feather replenishment. 

The practice is controversial.  While it is widespread in the US, it is prohibited in the EU.&lt;ref name="Wigley"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ciwf.org.uk/includes/documents/cm_docs/2013/s/salmonella.pdf|publisher=Compassion in World Farming|title=Salmonella|author=Wigley, P.|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Commercial hens usually begin laying eggs at 16–20 weeks of age, although production gradually declines soon after from approximately 25 weeks of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hyline.com/Redbook/Performance/Gray_All.pdf|title=Performance Records of Hy-Line Grey |accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that in many countries, by approximately 72 weeks of age, flocks are considered economically unviable and are slaughtered after approximately 12 months of egg production,&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ciwf.org.uk/farm_animals/poultry/egg_laying_hens/default.aspx |title=Compassion in World Farming - Egg laying hens |publisher=Ciwf.org.uk |accessdate=August 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; although chickens will naturally live for 6 or more years. However, in some countries, rather than being slaughtered, the hens are force molted to re-invigorate egg-laying for a second, and sometimes subsequent, laying phase.

Forced molting simulates the natural process where [[chicken]]s grow a new set of [[feather]]s in the Autumn, a process generally accompanied by a sharp reduction or cessation of egg production. Natural molting is stimulated by shortening day lengths combined with stress (of any kind). Before confinement housing with artificial lights was the norm, the Autumn molt caused a seasonal scarcity of eggs and high market prices. Farmers attempted to pamper their flocks to prevent the molt as long as possible, to take advantage of the high prices. Modern controlled-environment confinement housing has the opposite problem; the hens are not normally presented with sufficient stress or cues to go into molt naturally. However, after laying almost daily for nearly a year, their rate of egg production declines, as does the quality of the [[eggshell]] and the egg contents. In addition, the hens are overweight.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

It is sometimes claimed that forced molting is an artifact of modern intensive farming, but the practice predates the [[vertical integration]] of the poultry industry by decades; former Head of the Poultry Science Department at the University of Maryland, [[Morley A. Jull]] prescribes a precise molting program in his 1938 book, ''[[Poultry]] [[Husbandry]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jull, M.A.|title=Poultry Husbandry|edition=2|year=1938|publisher=McGraw-Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
For a complete recovery of the reproductive tract, the hen's body weight must drop by 30 to 35 percent during the forced molt. This is typically achieved by withdrawing the hen's feed for 7–14 days, sometimes up to 28 days.&lt;ref name="Molino et al., (2009)"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Molino, A.B. |author2=Garcia, E.A. |author3=Berto, D.A. |author4=Pelícia, K. |author5=Silva, A.P. |author6=Vercese F.|year=2009|title=The effects of alternative forced-molting methods on the performance and egg quality of commercial layers|journal=Brazilian Journal of Poultry Science|volume=11|pages=109–113 |doi=10.1590/s1516-635x2009000200006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This induces the birds to lose their feathers, cease to lay eggs and lose body-weight.&lt;ref name="Webster, (2003)"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Webster, A.B.|year=2003|title=Physiology and behavior of the hen during induced moult|journal=Poultry Science|volume=82|pages=992–1002|doi=10.1093/ps/82.6.992|pmid=12817455}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Duncan2010"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Duncan, I.J. |editor2=Hawkins, P.|year=2010|title=The Welfare of Domestic Fowl and Other Captive Birds|volume=9|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some programs combine feed withdrawal with a period of water withdrawal. Most programs also restrict the amount of lighting to provide a daylight period that is too short to stimulate egg production, providing a simulated autumn, the natural time of molt and minimum egg production.  

Forced molting programs sometimes follow other variations. Some do not eliminate feed altogether, but may induce a molt by providing a low-density diet (e.g. grape pomace, cotton seed meal, [[alfalfa]] meal)&lt;ref name="Patwardhan and King, (2011)"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Patwardhan, D.  |author2=King, A.|year=2011|title=Review: feed withdrawal and non feed withdrawal moult|journal=World's Poultry Science Journal|volume=67|pages=253–268|doi=10.1017/s0043933911000286}}&lt;/ref&gt; or dietary manipulation to create an imbalance of a particular nutrient(s). The most important among these include manipulation of minerals including [[sodium]], [[calcium]], [[iodine]] and [[zinc]], with full or partially reduced dietary intakes.&lt;ref name="Khan et al., (2011)"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Khan, R.U. |author2=Nikousefat, Z. |author3=Javdani, M. |author4=Tufarelli, V. |author5=Laudadio, V. |year=2011|title=Zinc-induced moulting: production and physiology|journal=World's Poultry Science Journal|volume=67|pages=497-506|doi=10.1017/S0043933911000547}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These alternative methods of forced molting have not been widely used by the egg industries.&lt;ref name="Duncan2010" /&gt; 
 
In 2003, more than 75% of all flocks in the US were molted.&lt;ref name="Yousaf and Chaudhry, (2008)"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Yousaf, M. |author2=Chaudhry, A.S.|year=2008|title=History, changing scenarios and future strategies to induce moulting in laying hens|journal=World's Poultry Science Journal|volume=64|pages=65–75|doi=10.1017/s0043933907001729}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mortality==
Some birds die during forced molting and it has been recommended that the flock must be managed so that mortality does not exceed 1.25% over the 1–2 weeks of (nearly complete) feed withdrawal, compared to a 0.5% to 1.0% monthly mortality in a well-managed flock under low-stress conditions.&lt;ref name="North1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=North, M.O.  |author2=Bell, D.D.|title=Commercial Chicken Production Manual|edition=4|year=1990|publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold|pages=438}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternative methods of forced molting which do not use total food withdrawal, e.g. creating a dietary mineral imbalance, generally result in lower mortality rates.&lt;ref name="Duncan2010" /&gt;

== Controversy ==
Temporary starvation of the hens is considered by many to be inhumane as well as a form of animal cruelty, and is the main objection of critics and opponents of the practice.

Forced molting increases plasma [[corticosterone]] which, along with related hormones, decreases the levels of circulating [[lymphocyte]]s and other [[leukocyte]]s, thereby reducing the effectiveness of the bird's immune system.  This means that birds being force molted become susceptible to disease, particularly ''[[Salmonella]]'' infections, and may produce contaminated eggs thereby compromising public health.&lt;ref name="Santos2015"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Santos, I.C.L. |author2=Teixeira, R.S.C. |author3=Lopes, E.S. |author4=Albuquerque, A.H. |author5=Rocha e Silva, R.C. |author6=Salles, R.P.R. |author7=Maciel, W.C. |year=2015|title=Experimental infection of Salmonella Enteritidis in quails submitted to forced molting by feed fasting|journal=Revista Brasileira de Ciência Avícola|volume=17|issue=1|pages=31–36 |doi=10.1590/1516-635x170131-36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hald"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hald, T. |author2=Nørrung, B. |author3=Chriél, M.|year=2010|title=Scientific opinion on a quantitative estimation of the public health impact of setting a new target for the reduction of Salmonella in laying hens|journal=EFSA Journal|volume=8|issue=4|pages=1546|doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2010.1546}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Webster2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepoultrysite.com/articles/489/nonfeed-withdrawal-molting/|author=Webster.

''The Cincinnati Enquirer'', August 14, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a month-long classical music education summer institute for gifted [[String instrument|string]] players aged 10 to 25 from China, the United States, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Europe and around the world. The academy began with a focus on strings only, founded by violinist [[Kurt Sassmannshaus]], and added a piano department in 2013. Faculty come to Beijing for the academy from music schools in Asia, America, and Europe.

Academy students focus only on performing [[chamber music]] and [[Solo (music)|solo]] repertoire. The academy takes place in a hotel complex outside of Beijing. Students and faculty perform daily concerts at the academy and several concerts in downtown Beijing throughout the month.&lt;ref&gt;Blomster, Wes. "Young String Players at the Great Wall."

The first Illinois State Fair was celebrated in 1853 in Springfield.  In that first year, the admission fee was 25 cents.  The fair moved to Chicago in 1855.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite news

The first State Fairs, in Illinois and other states, were created and organized by farmers in order to compare notes with their colleagues and distinguish between good and bad advice.
[[File:Illinois State Fair.jpg|thumb|The Illinois State Fair - from Farm Home Newspaper 1916]]

During the years after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the rules of agricultural judging became standardized, and more and more farmers began to show their farm products.  Increasing knowledge of genetics inspired the breeding and showing of [[purebred]] farm animals at both [[county fair]]s and the Illinois State Fair.

In the first half of the 20th century, the [[internal combustion engine]] revolutionized life on the American farm, with manufacturers of [[agricultural machinery]] eagerly taking advantage of occasions like the Illinois State Fair to demonstrate their new products.

The Illinois State Fair was held almost every summer during this more than 150-year-long period.  On a few occasions it was suspended.  In 1893, for example, the organizers of the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago prepared to offer a larger lineup of agricultural products and machinery, so the Illinois State Fair canceled itself for one year.

The Illinois State Fair, like many state fairs, moved during the first 40 years of its life, 1853–92, from place to place.  It was celebrated as far north as [[Freeport, Illinois|Freeport]] and as far south as [[Du Quoin, Illinois|Du Quoin]]. In 1894, the State of Illinois began to use a {{convert|156|acre|km2|sing=on}} parcel of land on the northern boundary of Springfield, which became the heart of the permanent Illinois State Fairgrounds.  A grandstand and racetrack were built, and the first [[dirt track racing|auto races]] were held at the [[Illinois State Fairgrounds Racetrack]] in 1910.  The fairground site was expanded to its current {{convert|366|acre|km2|sing=on}} dimensions in 1924.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;

During 1895, the Dome Building was constructed on the grounds. The building's huge glass dome, the world's second largest unsupported dome at 222 feet in diameter, had been part of the 1893 Chicago World's Fair. It was purchased for $69,000, taken down in Chicago and reassembled at the state fairgrounds. The building could accommodate 10,000 people and housed horticultural displays and National Guard offices. In 1917, about 1,500 soldiers waiting to go to war were temporarily housed in the Dome Building. On August 17, the building caught fire. Within 30 minutes after the fire was discovered, the huge glass dome came crashing down. At the time of the fire the building was valued at $300,000, but insured for only $20,000, and as a result, the remains of the building were later demolished. Apparently the soldiers were not to blame for the fire nor were any injured by it.

There was no state fair during the period 1942-1945 because the fairgrounds were used as a U.S. Army Air Force supply depot. According to one historian, in the fall of 1943 more than 1,000 Chinese military personnel were trained on the grounds.

==Present==
Starting with the end of World War II, the growth of productivity in agriculture began to reduce the number of jobs in American farming, both as a percentage of total population and in absolute numbers.  State fairs began to transition themselves from agricultural trade shows to entertainment operations.

In Illinois, the State Fair Grandstand, originally built as a place to watch harness racing (and still used for that purpose as of 2015) became a venue for concerts and recitals.  The "state fair circuit" became a recognized part of the overall live-music industry for many performers, especially but not exclusively in [[country music]].  Noted concerts held at The Grandstand include [[The Who]], performing as an opening act for [[The Association]] in 1968.

Agricultural show operations, competitions, and judging continued in Springfield, but many State Fairgoers in 2015 were attending the fair to watch parades and spectacles, enjoy the festival rides, listen to music, or drink beer in one of numerous "beer tents."

The Illinois State Fairgrounds now contains more than 100 permanent buildings.  In addition, participants set up countless pavilions and trailers during the period the State Fair is in operation.  The Illinois State Fair is operated by the [[Illinois Department of Agriculture]], which states in the state's official "Illinois Blue Book" that the purpose of the State Fair is to "showcase Illinois agriculture and offer wholesome family entertainment."  &lt;ref&gt;"Illinois Blue Book: 2005-2006", page 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Illinois State Fairgrounds Racetrack|Illinois State Fairgrounds]] are also used as a venue for other competitive and entertainment operations throughout the year, such as [[motorcycle]] and car racing, [[horse show]]s, and [[rodeo]]s.

Reported attendance at the Illinois State Fair was approximately 650,000 in 2003, 671,333 in 2004, 672,615 in 2005, approximately 705,000 in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;Jason George, "A blue ribbon for attendance", Chicago Tribune August 20, 2006, page 15.&lt;/ref&gt; 737,052 in 2008,&lt;ref name="Robert"/&gt; 918,435 in 2012,&lt;ref name="Doran"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://agrinews-pubs.com/Content/News/Latest-News/Article/Ag-heritage--entertainment-highlight-Illinois-State-Fair-/8/6/10915 |title=Ag heritage, entertainment headline Illinois State Fair |work=AgriNewsIllinois |accessdate=2014-08-08 |format=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 961,142 in 2013.&lt;ref name="Doran"/&gt;  After a change in attendance count methodology, reported State Fair attendance dropped sharply.  Attendees totaled 411,547 in 2015, 347,855 in 2016, 401,648 in 2017, and 369,144 in 2018.&lt;ref name="SJR"/&gt;

==Cultural references==
The Illinois State Fair played a key role in the popularization of the [[corn dog]], starting in 1946.

The fair has long been noted for its annual [[butter sculpture|butter cow]], a life-size animal formed of pure butter applied to an [[armature (sculpture)|armature]] by a sculptor wielding an oversized [[palette knife]].  Among the butter cow's more [[irony|ironic]] admirers was author [[David Foster Wallace]], who covered the 1993 Illinois State Fair for ''[[Harper's]]''; his report on the yellow bovine, and other Fair sights, is reprinted in ''[[A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again]]'' (1997).

The Illinois State Fair was featured on the [[NBC]]-TV show ''[[The Great American Road Trip]]'' in July 2009.

'''''Imaginary Friends''''' is a play by [[Nora Ephron]]. It includes songs with music by [[Marvin Hamlisch]] and lyrics by [[Craig Carnelia]]. This was Ephron's first stage play.&lt;ref name=curtain/&gt;

==Plot==
Writers [[Lillian Hellman]] and [[Mary McCarthy (author)|Mary McCarthy]] reunite in hell and reflect on their decades-long antagonistic relationship. Dating back to their first meeting at a conference at [[Sarah Lawrence College]] in 1948, it came to a head in 1980 when McCarthy, in a television interview with [[Dick Cavett]], asserted, "every word she writes is a lie, including 'and' and 'the'". Hellman subsequently sued McCarthy for [[slander]]. As the play progresses, the two women recall, among other things, Hellman's 1952 testimony before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]]; McCarthy's childhood abuse by an uncle; and their romantic involvements: McCarthy with [[Philip Rahv]] and Hellman with [[Dashiell Hammett]]. Throughout it all, McCarthy accuses Hellman of repeatedly presenting fiction as fact, while Hellman insists McCarthy always portrays fact as fiction.

==Productions==
Directed by [[Jack O'Brien (director)|Jack O'Brien]], choreographed by [[Jerry Mitchell]], and starring [[Cherry Jones]] as McCarthy, [[Swoosie Kurtz]] as Hellman, and [[Harry Groener]] as all the men in their lives, the play had its world premiere at the [[Old Globe Theatre]] in [[San Diego]], where it ran from September 21 through November 3, 2002.

The production transferred to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], opening at the [[Ethel Barrymore Theatre]] on December 12, 2002. It closed on February 16, 2003 after 76 performances and 20 previews.

==Critical reception==
In his ''CurtainUp'' review of the San Diego production, Gordon Osmond called it "an uncomfortable cross between [[vaudeville]] and conventional [[musical comedy]]." He observed, "From its outset Act II shows that the production has been hijacked by Mr. Hamlisch and select members of his [[Chorus line|troupe of gypsies]]. The plays breaks out into a rash of stand-alone and largely incongruous musical numbers, which seem concocted for the sole purpose of filling up a record album designed perhaps to defray the production's undoubtedly daunting costs . . . [W]e have a desiccated trial scene which didn't happen in life and shouldn't, in its present form, have happened on stage. The finale consists of an off-stage [[Catfight|cat fight]] between the stuffed doll [[alter ego]]s of Hellman and McCarthy. Having two women of wit, wisdom and letters slug it out physically, albeit offstage, is not just imaginary, it's artistically misguided, pandering to that segment of the audience which doesn't for a moment understand the substance and potential of the play." He concluded, "''Imaginary Friends'' has the feel of a work by a new playwright who was recently quoted as saying that she 'got a taste of the freedom that theater offered . . .' What the playwright failed to recognize is that the theatre has its own rules; e.g., thematic and stylistic consistency." &lt;ref name=curtain&gt;Osmond, Gordon. [http://www.curtainup.com/imaginaryfriends.html "CurtainUp California Review" ] curtainup.com, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

In his review of the Broadway production, [[Ben Brantley]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said it "isn't a show that leaves you gasping at its daring or chuckling over its cleverness. In chronicling a feud between two politically engaged, exceptionally feisty women within a literary world of men, Ms. Ephron makes her points dutifully, clearly and repetitively . . . In trying to appeal to both those who are and those who are not familiar with the play's high-brow heroines, the show winds up sacrificing its dramatic energy to [[Cliff Notes]]-like expositions disguised in [[masque]]rade costumes . . . Mr. Hamlisch's songs, with lyrics by [[Craig Carnelia]], are tuneful, [[jingle]]like numbers that add little in period flavor or character definition. And some of them simply slow things down to no purpose." &lt;ref&gt;[http://theater2.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?res=9805E0DA133AF930A25751C1A9649C8B63 ]''New York Times''{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing for ''Talkin' Broadway'', Matthew Murray noted Nora Ephron "has a thrillingly theatrical concept that she simply hasn't taken to its furthest extremes. This being her first play, that is perhaps understandable, and ''Imaginary Friends'' is never incompetent or boring. It does manage to be exciting occasionally, but less often than it should be . . . What Ephron gets right is her depiction of Lillian Hellman and Mary McCarthy as [[avatar]]s for the diametrically opposed (maybe) deities of 'fiction' and 'fact.' . . . When ''Imaginary Friends'' tackles that aspect of the story, presenting its scenes with the flair and creativity only theatre can allow, the play is at its best . . . These moments . . . are theatrically astute and emotionally honest . . . Scenes that give us greater insight into the characters are always the most successful and entertaining." He called the songs "the most puzzling component" of the play, commenting, "While the songs don't slow down or detract from the action, they do not particularly enhance it."  He concluded, "What is missing, and would probably have made the show more effective, is the literary music created by McCarthy and Hellman. For the most part, their writings - as lyrical and incisive as one is apt to find - are missing from the play, and the contributions of Hamlisch and Carnelia are a poor substitute. Late in the show, when we're reminded of the real legacy these women leave behind in the impressive volume of material each produced, it becomes all too obvious that ''Imaginary Friends'' is weaker for its absence. Given what is present, Nora Ephron could have quite a theatre career ahead of her . . . However, she would be expected to correct her lapses in judgment here in the future; if the addition of the songs was her idea, she should think twice next time and let her characters sing all on their own." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkinbroadway.com/world/ImFriends.html "Theatre Review. 'Imaginary Friends'"] ''Talkin' Broadway'', December 12, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and nominations==
Craig Carnelia was nominated for the [[Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Lyrics]] but lost to [[Marc Shaiman]] and [[Scott Wittman]] for ''[[Hairspray (musical)|Hairspray]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibdb.com/advancesearchaward.asp ''Imaginary Friends''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219011248/http://www.ibdb.com/advancesearchaward.asp |date=December 19, 2013 }} Internet Broadway Database&lt;/ref&gt; The play was also chosen as one of the ten best plays of the 2002-03 New York theatre season by ''The Best Plays Theatre Yearbook'', where critic Charles Wright wrote “Ephron’s characterization captures the tension of women defying expectations when literature was a men’s club and entry appeared—at times—to depend less on talent than on personal association with a man of established position. . . . At a time when deceptive rhetoric permeated the American ether, Ephron offered a play about prevarication and truth-telling in public discourse—and delivered a message of skepticism about the objectivity of “truth” and the credibility of those with easiest access to the media.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/55139647|title=The best plays of 2002-2003|date=2004|publisher=Limelight Editions|others=Jenkins, Jeffrey Eric.|isbn=0879103035|edition= 84th |location=[New York]|oclc=55139647}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Irena's Vow''''' is a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] play recounting the story of [[Irena Gut]], a Polish nurse who, at the risk of her life, saved twelve [[Jew]]s during [[World War II]] in [[Nazi Germany|German]]-[[occupied Poland]].&lt;ref name=playbill/&gt;

==Production history==
The play opened at Broadway's [[Walter Kerr Theatre]] at 219 West 48th Street (between Broadway and 8th Avenue) on 29 March 2009,&lt;ref name=polestar&gt;"''Przysięga Ireny''" ("Irena's Vow"), ''Gwiazda Polarna'' (Pole Star), vol. 100, no. 7 (March 28, 2009), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; after having premiered off-Broadway at the Baruch Performing Arts Center in September 2008. The ninety-minute play opened at the Kerr Theatre with the same cast from off-Broadway.&lt;ref name=playbill&gt;Andrew Gans, [http://www.playbill.com/news/article/124530.html "Feldshuh to Return to Broadway in March in Irena's Vow"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225003521/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/124530.html |date=2008-12-25 }}, playbill.com, 22 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The play was written by [[Dan Gordon (screenwriter)|Dan Gordon]], based on conversations that he had held with Irene Gut-Opdyke (''née'' [[Irena Gut]]). Gordon "captures... peculiarly Polish elements: the heroine's irony and sense of humor in the face of catastrophe." He deftly draws the historic backdrop to Irena's story and creates a suspenseful narrative and "enthralling dialog."&lt;ref name=polestar/&gt;

The title role is played by [[Tovah Feldshuh]]. Appearing in other roles are Sandi Carroll, [[Tracee Chimo]], Steven Hauck, Scott Klaven, [[Peter Reznikoff]], Thomas Ryan, Gene Silvers, John Stanisci and [[Maja Wampuszyc]].

''Irena's Vow'' is directed by Michael Parva. Scenic design is by Kevin Judge; lighting design, David Castaneda; costume design, Astrid Brucker; sound design and music composition, Quentin Chiappetta; and projection design, Alex Koch.&lt;ref name=polestar/&gt;&lt;ref name=playbill/&gt;

On June 16, 2009 it was announced that ''Irena's Vow'' will close on June 28.  At the time of its closure, it will have played 21 previews and 105 regular performances.&lt;ref&gt;Gans, Andrew.[https://archive.is/20120907082649/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/130282 "Irena's Vow to Close on Broadway June 28,"] playbill.com, June 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==
After [[Poland]] was invaded by [[German invasion of Poland|Germany]] and the [[Soviet invasion of Poland|Soviet Union]] in September 1939, [[Irena Gut]], a Polish [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] nurse nineteen year old at the outbreak of [[World War II]], was captured by the Soviet Army. After escaping, she was caught in a German [[łapanka|roundup]] to be used as a [[slave labor]]er.&lt;ref name=polestar/&gt;

Eventually she became the housekeeper to a German army major. After she witnessed the gruesome fate of [[Jew]]s in German-occupied Poland, Gut resolved at the risk of her life to conceal a dozen Jews threatened by the German [[Holocaust]] extermination program. The penalty that the Germans imposed on any Pole found to be harboring or otherwise aiding Jews was death.&lt;ref name=polestar/&gt;

One day Gut's employer discovered that she was concealing Jews in his house. Gut begged him to spare them; he agreed to, and never betrayed them or her. Gut became the German officer's mistress. Before the [[Red Army]] arrived, she fled with the people that she was protecting into the forest. After the war, suspected falsely by some of having collaborated with the Germans, she emigrated to the United States.&lt;ref name=polestar/&gt;

'''James Adams Ekin''' (August 31, 1819&amp;ndash;March 27, 1891) was a [[Union Army]] officer in the [[American Civil War]]. He achieved fame as a member of the military commission trying the conspirators involved with the assassination of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]].

==Early life==
Ekin was born August 31, 1819 in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], to James and Susan Burling (Bayard) Ekin.  His mother was a daughter of [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] Stephen A. Bayard of the [[Continental Army]].  He served an apprenticeship as a steamboat builder, which eventually led to his first career as a steamboat builder in Pittsburgh.

==Civil War==
At the outbreak of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Ekin enlisted April 25, 1861 in the 12th Pennsylvania Infantry (a 3-month regiment) as a [[1st Lieutenant#U.S. Army.2C U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Air Force|lieutenant]] and was assigned regimental quartermaster.  Ekin mustered out with the regiment on August 5, 1861 at [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]].  He was subsequently promoted [[Captain (United States)|captain]] and assistant quartermaster August 7, 1861 and served in the Quartermaster's Department.  Ekin and was promoted to [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] February 15, 1864, then promoted again to [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] August 2, 1864.  He was [[brevet (military)|brevetted]] in the regular army [[Major (United States)|major]], lieutenant colonel, colonel and [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]], all on March 13, 1865.  In addition to his volunteer ranks, Ekin was made a captain in the regular army March 13, 1863, lieutenant colonel and deputy quartermaster general July 29, 1865.

==Lincoln assassination trial==
Despite his excellent service in the Army quartermaster department, Ekin is remembered largely for his participation as a member of the [[Military tribunals in the United States|military tribunal]] that heard the case against eight conspirators in the [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|assassination]] of President Lincoln.

==Post-war service==

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image: jerry klein.jpg|200 px|right|thumb|Jerry Klein of WMAL 630 AM Radio]] --&gt;
On November 26, 2006, radio host Jerry Klein of [[WMAL (AM)|WMAL 630 AM]] (covering [[Washington DC]], Northern [[Virginia]] and [[Maryland]]) had a program that was "focused on public reaction to the removal of six [[imam]]s, or [[Islam]]ic religious leaders, from a [[US Airways]] flight."&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{cite news|title=In U.S., fear and distrust of Muslims runs deep | author=Bernd Debusmann | publisher=Reuters|date=February 25, 2007|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSARM55127020070225}} Retrieved on Dec. 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; (See ''[[Flying Imams controversy]]''). In an effort to gauge his audience's reaction, he said that force should be applied to ensure that all [[Islam in the United States|Muslims in America]] wear "identifying markers. ...I'm thinking either it should be an [[armband|arm band]], a [[Star and crescent#Use by Muslims|crescent moon]] arm band, or it should be a crescent moon [[tattoo]]. ...If it means that we have to round them up and do a tattoo in a place where everybody knows where to find it, then that's what we'll have to do."&lt;ref name="reuters"/&gt;

The response was overwhelming and "the phone lines jammed instantly". Klein later stated that "The switchboard went from empty to totally jammed within minutes. There were plenty of callers angry with me, but there were plenty who agreed."&lt;ref name="reuters"/&gt; While some callers said he was "off his rocker", others insisted that his statement did not go far enough, calling for [[Population transfer|forced mass exile]]: "Not only do you tattoo them in the middle of their forehead but you ship them out of this country... they are here to kill us." Others called for Muslims to be placed in [[internment camps]]: "You have to set up [[Internment of Japanese Americans|encampments like during World War Two with the Japanese]] and [[German American internment|Germans]]."&lt;ref name="reuters"/&gt;

At the end of the program, Klein revealed that his remarks had been a hoax, saying, "I can't believe any of you are sick enough to have agreed for one second with anything I said. For me to suggest to tattoo marks on people's bodies, have them wear armbands, put a crescent moon on their driver's license on their passport or birth certificate is disgusting. It's beyond disgusting ... because basically what you just did was show me how the German people allowed what happened to the Jews to happen ... We need to separate them, we need to [[Identification in Nazi camps#Numbers|tattoo their arms]], we need to make them wear the [[Yellow badge|yellow Star of David]], we need to put them in [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]], we basically just need to kill them all because they are dangerous."&lt;ref name="reuters"/&gt; A week later, Klein also expressed surprise at how much international media coverage the story got. "You should know that I've received email from around the world, interview requests from the [[BBC]] and [[Channel 4]] in [[England]]".&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|title=At least in America they understand the notion of cultural difference |date=December 11, 2006 |publisher=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/Columnists/Column/0,,1969165,00.html |author=Gary Younge |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212004349/http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2006/dec/11/comment.religion |archivedate=2008-02-12 }} Retrieved Dec. 19, 2006.

'''Joseph Oliver Carter''' (December 20, 1835 – February 27, 1909), known professionally as Joseph O. Carter, was also known as J. O. Carter and Joe Carter.  He was a life-long friend, confidant, and legal advisor to Queen [[Liliʻuokalani]], serving on her Privy Council of State. During the reign of King Kalākaua, Carter was Acting Commercial Agent for Japan, and served two terms as representative in the [[Legislature of the Kingdom of Hawaii]]. He was president of [[C. Brewer &amp; Co.]] in Honolulu.  Although he served in the [[Provisional Government of Hawaii]] after the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii, he was an opponent to annexation by the United States.  Carter was trustee of many large estates in Hawaii, and was one of the first directors of the [[Bishop Museum]].  Hawaii diplomat [[Henry A. P. Carter]] was his brother, and [[Governor of Hawaii|Territorial Governor of Hawaii]] [[George R. Carter]] was his nephew.

== Early life and family background ==
He was born December 20, 1835, in a grass house in Honolulu, the first of six children of Massachusetts sea captain Joseph Oliver Carter (1802–1850) and his wife Hannah Trufant Lord (1809–1898).&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news|last1=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|title=Joseph O.

Lib. of Congress.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Governor of Hawaii|Territorial Governor of Hawaii]] [[George R. Carter]], son of Joseph's brother [[Henry A. P. Carter]] (1837–1891), no one in the family was named Joseph Oliver Carter Sr., and the only Jr. was a grandson of the sea captain.{{sfn|Carter|1915|p=4}} Sons Henry and Samuel Morrill Carter (1838–1893) were also born in Honolulu. Son Alfred Wellington Carter (1840–1890) was born aboard the ship Caliope off the coast of Tahiti. Their two youngest children Frederick William Carter (1842–1860), and Catherine Rebecca Carter Lewers (1844–1924) were born in Honolulu.{{sfn|Carter|1915|p=4}}

Governor Carter recalled being told by his uncle Joseph that after his birth in Honolulu, he and his mother Hannah accompanied Capt. Carter on a trip to [[Hong Kong]] where the young Joseph was baptized by a British sea captain.{{sfn|Carter|1915|pp=6–7}}  On November 28, 1859, he wed Mary Ladd,  daughter of William Ladd who formed the sugar cane partnership [[Ladd &amp; Co.]]. Mrs. Carter was a lady-in-waiting to Liliʻuokalani. The couple had six children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|title=Foreign Office Notice|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82016412/1892-08-29/ed-1/seq-2/|accessdate=October 7, 2017|work=The Daily Bulletin|date=August 29, 1892|location= Honolulu, Hawaiian Islands|via=Chronicling America: Historic American Newspapers.

He served two terms with the House of Representatives in the [[Legislature of the Kingdom of Hawaii]], for sessions April 30 – July 29, 1872 and January 8 – 20, 1873.{{sfn|Lydecker|1918|pp=123–124}} During the 1874 [[Honolulu Courthouse riot]] provoked by the Legislative Assembly electing Kalākaua over [[Queen Emma of Hawaii|Queen Emma]], former representative Carter sustained injuries when he became a target of mob harassment and violence while helping to rescue legislators.

== Adviser to Liliʻuokalani and annexation ==

He managed Liliʻuokalani's personal real estate holdings and had been her friend and confidant for years before she ascended to the throne on January 29, 1891.

Liliʻuokalani's proposed [[Proposed 1893 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii|1893 Constitution]] provoked protests, but Carter advised against her cabinet's suggestion of requesting American intervention to maintain civil order. He prepared a proclamation signed by the Queen and her cabinet that promulgation of a new constitution had been abandoned,{{sfn|Alexander|1896|pp=40–42}} but it was not enough to stave off the overthrow and installation of a provisional local government. Carter counseled her to resign under protest, and on January 17 she temporarily ceded her power to the United States.{{sfn|Alexander|1896|p=66}} Following the overthrow, Carter was part of a group sent to Washington D.

President [[Grover Cleveland]] attempted a restoration of the monarchy, with the stipulation that Liliʻuokalani grant amnesty to everyone responsible.

The '''Kendal Mountain Festival''' is an annual festival held in the town of [[Kendal]], Cumbria on the edge of the [[Lake District|English Lake District]] in the UK. It is one of the most diverse festivals of its kind in the world, attracting film premières from around the globe. Filmmakers, TV producers, adventurers, top brands, athletes and speakers gather to take part in four days of the films, talks, books and exhibitions covering all aspects of mountain and adventure sports culture. It is also the main social event for outdoor enthusiasts in the UK.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The [[British Mountaineering Council]] states that it "is by far the largest and most varied event of its type in Europe and it's the main social event for outdoor enthusiasts in the UK."&lt;ref name=bmc&gt;[http://www.thebmc.co.uk/Feature.aspx?id=3918 "Kendal Mountain Festival 2010"], thebmc.co.uk. Retrieved 5 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

At the heart of Kendal's programme is the mountain film competition, attracting film premières from around the world. Over 70 films are screened (from 300+ entries) with twelve prizes available. The genres represented include culture, drama, wildlife and environmental documentaries, as well as a lecture programme.

Other events include art exhibitions, literature events, including the Boardman Tasker Prize for Mountain Literature, the 'Adventure Film Academy' for aspiring film-makers, photography events, competitions, specialist sports nights (Bike, Snowsports, Free-Flight, Underground and Endurance Sports) and the KMF for Schools programme (Film Active).

Extra expenditure into the local economy generated by the Kendal Mountain Festival has been independently calculated to be in excess of £2m.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

The Festival has even been cited by the ''[[Sunday Times]]'' as one of the reasons young people are attracted to Kendal as a place to live.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The Kendal Mountain Festival 'mission' is 'to inspire more people to explore, enjoy and represent mountains, wilderness and their cultures'.

After [[World War II]], Italian war widows began a movement to reconcile nations that had participated in the war, on both sides.&lt;ref name=Schrijvers/&gt; In 1950, they organized a visit of families of those who had died in the war to several sites, including the Monte Cassino Abbey, where the original Lamp of Brotherhood was placed.

This initiative grew and by the late 1950s it had become the World Organization of the Lamp of Brotherhood (''Opera Mondiale della Lampada della Fraternità''), a subsidiary of the [[Pontificia Commissione di Assistenza]] led by Bishop [[Ferdinando Baldelli]].&lt;ref name=Ellison&gt;{{cite book |title=Ralph Ellison |first=Arnold |last=Rampersad |publisher=Knopf Doubleday |date=2007 |isbn=9780307267320 |quote=Fanny went with some trepidation to the headquarters of the Pontificia Opera di Assistenza,...At stake was a job with a subsidiary group, the Lampada della Fraternità, or the Lamp of Brotherhood, which had been founded in 1950 to serve the families of soldiers killed in Italy and abroad.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schrijvers/&gt;&lt;ref name=CNP/&gt; A ceremony was held in the partially re-built Monte Cassino in 1956, in which Lamps were given to representatives of many nations. Each country that received a Lamp was intended to create a national ''Lampada'' organization, which was to have custody of the Lamp.

===Vancouver Lamp===
The Vancouver Lamp arrived in Vancouver through the participation of Air Vice Marshal Ken Guthrie&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sturgeon.ab.ca/guthrie/guthrie.htm Air Vice Marshal Kenneth M. Guthrie]&lt;/ref&gt; in the original Lamp service in 1956. Guthrie said that he and his wife were the only representatives from North America at this Lamp-giving ceremony and it was placed in their custody.

No "Lampada" organization was started in North America, and so the Lamp remained in the custody of Ken and Kay Guthrie. The Lamp was a focal point at a ceremony in [[Sainte-Agathe-des-Monts|Sainte-Agathe, Quebec]] in 1959.  A Mrs. Stockdale, National President of the [[Silver Cross Mother|Mothers of the Silver Cross Association]] laid the Lamp at the base of the Cenotaph.  The Guthries brought the Lamp to Vancouver in 1964. There, the Lamp has been a focal point of the annual [[Battle of Britain]] ceremony at the Air Force Garden of Remembrance in [[Stanley Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legionbcyukon.ca/content/battle-britain-ceremony-sept-15 |title=Battle of Britain Ceremony Sept 15 |date=5 Sep 2013 |publisher=Royal Canadian Legion BC/Yukon Command |accessdate=26 Jan 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report was made public on 16 December 2011, after being tabled in the [[Parliament of Sri Lanka|parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=President Releases LLRC Report To Parliament, The UN And Public|url=http://www.thesundayleader.lk/2011/12/18/president-releases-llrc-report-to-parliament-the-un-and-public/|newspaper=The Sunday Leader|date=18 December 2011|accessdate=29 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The commission concluded that the [[Sri Lanka Armed Forces|Sri Lankan military]] didn't deliberately target civilians but the rebel [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] (LTTE) repeatedly violated international [[humanitarian law]].&lt;ref name=CBS161211&gt;{{cite news|title=Sri Lankan commission: Civilians weren't targeted |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-501712_162-57344039/sri-lanka-war-commission-rules-out-willful-attacks/ |newspaper=[[Associated Press]]/[[CBS News]] |date=16 December 2011 }}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the commission the military gave the "highest priority" to protecting civilians whereas the Tamil Tigers had had "no respect for human life".&lt;ref name=BBC161211&gt;{{cite news|title=Sri Lanka MPs receive controversial civil war report|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-16214783|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=16 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commission admitted that civilians had been killed by the Sri Lankan military, albeit accidentally, contradicting the government's line that there were zero civilian casualties.&lt;ref name=SMH191211&gt;{{cite news|last=Doherty|first=Ben|title=Sri Lanka war report lays blame on both sides|url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/sri-lanka-war-report-lays-blame-on-both-sides-20111218-1p0sg.html|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commission did, however, receive some eyewitness evidence alleging abuse by the military which warranted further investigation and, if necessary, the prosecution of perpetrators.&lt;ref name=AJ201111&gt;{{cite news|title=Sri Lanka war probe calls for new inquiry|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2011/11/201111201146094228.html|newspaper=[[Al Jazeera]]|date=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commission acknowledged that hospitals had been shelled, resulting "considerable civilian casualties", but it did not say who was responsible for the shelling.&lt;ref name=BBC161211/&gt; The commission blamed Sinhalese and Tamil politicians for causing the civil war: the Sinhalese politicians failed to offer a solution acceptable to the Tamil people and the Tamil politicians fanned [[Sri Lankan Tamil militant groups|militant separatism]].&lt;ref name=SMH191211/&gt;

The commission has been heavily criticised by international human rights groups, the [[Report of the Secretary-General's Panel of Experts on Accountability in Sri Lanka|UN Panel of Experts]] and others due its limited mandate, alleged lack of independence and its failure to meet minimum international standards or offer protection to witnesses.&lt;ref name=BBC161211/&gt;&lt;ref name=C4161211&gt;{{cite news|title=Sri Lankan civilians 'not targeted', says report|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/sri-lankan-civilians-werent-targeted-says-report|newspaper=Channel 4 News|date=16 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These critics believed that the Sri Lankan government was using the commission as a tool to prevent an independent international investigation of [[Alleged war crimes during the Sri Lankan Civil War|alleged abuses]].&lt;ref name=FL031211&gt;{{cite journal|last=RADHAKRISHNAN|first=R.

==Background==
Tensions between the [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] and [[Sri Lankan Tamil people|Tamil]] communities in Sri Lanka turned into a full-scale war between the Sri Lankan government and LTTE in 1983. In 2002, government and the LTTE signed a Norwegian-mediated ceasefire. Both LTTE and the government resumed fighting in 2006, and the government officially backed out of the ceasefire in 2008. After a violent last few months, in May 2009, the government killed LTTE leader [[Velupillai Prabhakaran]] and declared an end to the civil war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sri Lanka Profile|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-12004081|publisher=BBC|accessdate=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the end of the war, international pressure mounted on the government to inquire into the final stages of the civil war, in which it was alleged thousands of civilians, possibly as many as 40,000, were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the Secretary-General's Panel of Experts on Accountability In Sri Lanka|url=https://www.un.org/News/dh/infocus/Sri_Lanka/POE_Report_Full.pdf|publisher=[[United Nations]]|date=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of the entire war, between 60,000 and 100,000 deaths.&lt;ref name="ABC200509"&gt;{{cite news | title = Up to 100,000 killed in Sri Lanka's civil war: UN | url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/05/20/2576543.htm | newspaper = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC Australia]] | date = 20 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sri Lanka|url=. http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/srilanka/index.html?scp=1-spot&amp;sq=sri%20lanka&amp;st=cse|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were calls to look into the root causes of the civil war and meaningful reconciliation. The [[Sri Lankan government]] rejected calls for an independent ''international'' inquiry but instead on 15 May 2010, nearly a year after the end of the civil war, President Rajapaksa appointed the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission to look back at the conflict Sri Lanka suffered for 26 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sri Lanka: President appoints Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission|url=http://reliefweb.int/node/354905|publisher=ReliefWeb|date=17 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its secretariat was established at the [[Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute of International Relations and Strategic Studies]] in [[Colombo]]. Hearings of the commission, which commenced on 11 August 2010, were public and open to media, unless the witness requested otherwise. The LLRC issued some interim recommendations on 13 September 2010. Time limit to produce the final report was extended twice, until 15 November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Reddy|first=B. Muralidhar|title=Reconciliation panel's term extended|url=http://www.hindu.com/2010/11/09/stories/2010110962020700.htm|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=9 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hearings were held in Colombo and in former conflict affected areas such as [[Batticaloa]], [[Jaffna]], [[Kilinochchi]], [[Mannar, Sri Lanka|Mannar]] and [[Vavuniya]]. Field visits were conducted to the former war zone and detention centres where surrendered [[Tamil Tiger]] combatants were held. After analysing over 1,000 oral and 5,000 written submissions it had received, the commission presented its 388-page final report to the President on 15 November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=LLRC report tabled in Parliament: "Security Forces had not deliberately targeted civilians in the NFZs" - LLRC|url=http://www.priu.gov.lk/news_update/Current_Affairs/ca201112/20111216llrc_report_tabled_parliament.htm|date=16 December 2011|accessdate=29 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was made public on 16 December 2011.

==The report==

===Summary===
The report provides a detailed analysis of the oral and written representations made to the commission. The 1st chapter gives an introduction to the report and the methodology the commission has used. 2nd chapter is devoted to the 2002 Ceasefire Agreement (CFA). There the commission analyses its background, political and security dimensions and the impact. The commission also tries to evaluate the CFA's effectiveness and the causes which led to its eventual collapse. The next chapter provides an insight into the security forces operations in [[Eastern Theater of Eelam War IV|Eastern]] and [[Northern Theater of Eelam War IV|Wanni]] [[Theater (warfare)|theater]]s, with a note about the casualty figures of both security forces and the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] (LTTE). Chapter 4 deals with the Humanitarian law issues pertaining to the conflict. This includes hundreds of eyewitness reports and clarifications of the incidents brought to light. There is also an evaluation of the Sri Lanka experience in the context of allegations of violations of [[International humanitarian law]] (IHL). Here, the commission concludes that security forces had not deliberately targeted civilians during the final stages of war, but civilian casualties had occurred under unavoidable circumstances. The commission also casts doubts about the authenticity of [[Channel 4]] videos.

Chapter 5 deals with the human rights issues arising from the conflict. It analyses the alleged "white van" abductions, unlawful arrests, arbitrary detention and involuntary disappearances. This chapter goes into details of the instances where such incidents have occurred, and places the blame on certain paramilitary groups who allegedly hold the responsibility. Next 2 chapters are devoted to land issues regarding the returning [[Sri Lankan IDP camps|Internally Displaced Persons]] (IDPs) and [[restitution]]/compensatory relief paid out to persons who are affected by the conflict. Chapter 8 talks about the [[Sociology of race and ethnic relations|post war reconciliation]] and alleviating the grievances of affected groups, especially the [[Sri Lankan Tamil people]], in broad terms. The ninth and the final chapter summarizes the principle observations and recommendations made by the commission.&lt;ref&gt;http://slembassyusa.org/downloads/LLRC-REPORT.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

 | quote = "What needs to be done for reconciliation and nation-building is that the State has to reach out to the minorities and the minorities, in turn must, re-position themselves in their role ''vis'' a ''vis'' the State and the country. There must be willingness on the part of all political parties to give up adversarial politics and have consensual decision-making on national issues. In order to meet the challenges of this opportunity there has to be courage and political will on the part of all political parties."

*The 2002 ceasefire agreement (CFA) which was signed between the Sri Lankan government and LTTE, although brought about a short lived respite to the country, was unstable and eventually unproductive.
*Conceptual flaws and the untenable dual roles of the [[Politics of Norway|Government of Norway]], as facilitator of the peace process and the head of the [[Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission]] paved the way to its failure.
*The military strategy of the [[Sri Lanka Armed Forces]] during [[Eelam War IV]] is satisfactory. It gave the highest priority to the protection of civilian population.
*Security Forces had not deliberately targeted civilians in the No Fire Zones (NFZs), which were declared in the final stages of the war.
*Given the complexity of the situation and based on the [[Proportionality (law)|Principle of Proportionality]], commission concluded that the Security Forces were confronted with an unprecedented situation where no other choice was possible other than returning fire into the NFZs in reply to the incoming fire, and all "feasible precautions" that were practicable in the circumstances had been taken. Determining and obtaining of a re-construction of all the conditions under which the "combat action" took place would be "next to impossible".
*The Commission is satisfied, on a careful consideration of all the circumstances that shells had in fact fallen on hospitals causing damage and resulting in civilian casualties. But evidence submitted is equivocal in nature and does not warrant a definitive conclusion that one party or the other was responsible for the shelling.
*Government of Sri Lanka with the co-operation of the aid agencies, has taken all possible steps in getting food, medical supplies and other essential items across to the entrapped civilians. However, there appears to have been a paucity of medicines and the medical facilities appear to have been inadequate.
*LTTE was engaged in grave violations of core principles of International humanitarian law (IHL) by using civilians as [[human shield]]s, placing and using military equipment in civilian centres, shooting at civilians trying to escape into safe areas, conscripting young children to engage in combat etc.
*Absence of a proper verification process during the final stages of the war has contributed to the unverified sweeping generalizations of a highly speculative nature, as regards casualty figures.
*There are a number of shortcomings in the existing IHL regime pertaining to internal conflicts involving states and non state armed groups.
*Technical ambiguities, electronic tampering and the artificial construction of the 'blood effect' in the 3 separate videos (originally in [[3GP and 3G2|3GP]] format) that appears in [[Channel 4]] documentary ''[[Sri Lanka's Killing Fields]]'', cast significant doubts on their authenticity, leading to questions on whether the incidents are 'real' or 'staged'.
*There was an alarmingly large number of representations made in front of the commission alleging abductions, unlawful arrests, arbitrary detention and involuntary disappearances, regarding which no official action has been taken.
*Programmes in rehabilitation centers for ex-LTTE combatants are conducted in a professional and caring manner.
*The grievances of the [[Sri Lankan Tamil people|Tamil community]] has been a root cause for the ethnic conflict.
*Along with an independent judiciary and a transparent legal process, strict adherence to the [[rule of law]] is a [[sine qua non]] for peace and stability of the country.
*An independent and permanent Police Commission is a pre-requisite to guarantee the effective functioning of the [[Sri Lanka Police Service|Police service]].
*While the distribution of meaningful powers to the periphery is essential, there are powers which form the core responsibilities of the state and which cannot be so devolved, and need to be retained and exercised by the government at the centre.

 | quote = "The process of reconciliation requires a full acknowledgement of the tragedy of the conflict and a collective act of contrition by the political leaders and civil society, of both [[Sinhalese people|Sinhala]] and [[Sri Lankan Tamil people|Tamil]] communities. The conflict could have been avoided had the southern political leaders of the two main political parties acted in the national interest and forged a consensus between them to offer an acceptable solution to the Tamil people. The Tamil political leaders were equally responsible for this conflict which could have been avoided had the Tamil leaders refrained from promoting an armed campaign towards [[Tamil Eelam|secession]], acquiescing in the violence and terrorist methods used by the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam|LTTE]] against both the Sinhala and Tamil people, and failing to come out strongly and fearlessly against the LTTE, and their atrocious practices."

*Further investigations should be carried out regarding four particular incidents which caused death or injury to civilians, on possible implication of the security forces.
*Necessary investigations should be carried out into specific allegations of disappearances after surrender/arrest, and where such investigations produce evidence of any unlawful act on the part of individual members of the [[Sri Lanka Army|Army]], the wrongdoers should be prosecuted and punished.
*Take due account on surrendered LTTE cadres against whom investigations reveal [[prima facie]] material for prosecution.
*IHL regime should take into account the grey areas in the existing legal framework applicable to internal conflicts involving states and non state armed groups.
*A professionally designed household survey should be conducted covering all affected families in all parts of the island to ascertain firsthand the scale and the circumstances of death and injury to civilians, as well as damage to property during the period of the conflict.
*Institute an independent investigation into Channel 4 videos.
*A special commissioner should be appointed to investigate alleged disappearances and provide material to the [[Attorney General of Sri Lanka|Attorney general]] to initiate criminal proceedings as appropriate.
*Death certificates should be issued and monetary recompense should be provided where necessary. Steps should be taken to effectively implement the amendment to the Registration of Deaths Act (2006).
*Appoint an independent advisory committee to monitor and examine detention and arrest of persons under any regulations made under the Public Security Ordinance or the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA).
*Domestic legislation should be framed to specifically criminalize enforced or involuntary disappearances.
*Prepare a centralized and comprehensive database containing a list of detainees and make that available to their next of kin.
*All illegal armed groups should be disarmed.
*Grant the legal ownership of land to those who have been resettled.
*In instances where there is prima facie evidence of conscription of children as combatants (by both LTTE and [[Tamil Makkal Viduthalai Pulikal|TMVP]]), any such alleged cases should be investigated and offenders must be brought to justice.
*Increased employment opportunities should be provided to those in the former conflict affected areas.
*An inter-agency task force mandated to addressing the needs of vulnerable groups like women, children, elderly and disabled, must be established.
*Investigate and inquire into alleged incidents of serious violations of human rights including the [[2006 Trincomalee massacre]] and the [[2006 Trincomalee massacre of NGO workers|2006 massacre of 17 aid workers]].
*The land policy of the governments should not be an instrument to effect unnatural changes in the demographic pattern of a given province.
*A National Land Commission (NLC) should be established in order to propose appropriate future national land policy guidelines.
*All political parties should arrive at a bipartisan understanding on national land policy and recognize it as a national issue. Land policy should not be used as a tool to gain narrow political advantage.
*The role and capacity of the Rehabilitation of Persons, Properties and Industries Authority (REPPIA) should be reviewed, giving its primary focus in providing compensatory relief for persons affected by the conflict. Ex-LTTE combatants and next of kin should also be considered eligible for compensatory relief.
*Involvement of the security forces in civilian activities in [[North Eastern Province (Sri Lanka)|North Eastern Province]] should be phased out. Private lands should be used giving reasonable time lines.
*A proper investigation should be carried out on the alleged involvement of [[Vinayagamoorthy Muralitharan]] ''alias'' Karuna Amman and [[Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan]] ''alias'' Pillayan in the [[1990 massacre of Sri Lankan Police officers]].
*A full investigation should be done on the alleged acts of extortion committed by members of the [[Eelam People's Democratic Party]] (EPDP).
*Steps should be taken to neutralise the activities of a gang led by a person called Major Seelan in connection with offences of abduction, extortion and robbery using the security forces facilities as a cover.
*Units of the Attorney General's department should be set up in the provinces to guide and advise the Police regarding criminal investigations, prosecutions and other matters touching upon the criminal justice system.
*An independent Public Service Commission should be established without delay to ensure that there is no political interference in the public service.
*A good-faith effort should be taken to develop a consensus on power devolution, building on what exists – both, for maximum possible devolution to the periphery, as well as power sharing at the centre.
*Learning of each other's languages should be made a compulsory part of the school curriculum.
*All Government offices should have Tamil-speaking officers at all times. Police Stations should have bi-lingual officers on a 24-hour basis.
*A proactive policy should be implemented to encourage mixed schools serving children from different ethnic and religious backgrounds.
*Government should engage with the so-called 'hostile diaspora groups' constructively and address their concerns.
*[[Sri Lanka Matha|National anthem]] should be sung simultaneously in two languages to the same tune.
*Laws should be strictly enforced on the instances of [[hate speech]] that contributes to communal disharmony.
*A separate event should be set apart on the National Day (4 February) to express solidarity and empathy with all victims of the tragic conflict and pledge the collective commitment to ensure that there should never be such blood-letting in the country again.

===Figures===
*Casualty figure of Sri Lanka armed forces during the [[Eelam War IV]], from 26 July 2006 (operation to recapture of the Mavil Aru reservoir), to 18 May 2009 (formal declaration of the cessation of hostilities), stands at 5,556 killed, 28,414 wounded and 169 missing in action.
*During the same perid, LTTE had lost 22,247 cadres of which 11,812 had been identified by name. Among the combatants identified by name, 4,264 belonged to the period from January 2009 to May 2009.
*Civilian officials who made representations to the commission indicated that they were not in a position, under the circumstances of conflict, to carry out any assessment of civilian casualties. Consequently, no estimated or verified figures of civilian casualties are available in the report.
*Records of the Ministry of Health indicates that from January to June 2009, government hospitals in the [[Northern Province, Sri Lanka|Northern Province]] have recorded 1,353 deaths after admission. Further 106 deaths of patients happened after being transferred to hospitals outside the conflict area. Vavuniya Base Hospital has registered a total of 870 deaths during the same period. Of these, 257 deaths have been registered as due to firearm and blast injuries.
*Report points out 474 instances of involuntary disappearances since 2006.&lt;ref name="daylim"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailymirror.lk/news/15724-llrc-had-over-passed-their-mandate-jhu.html | title=LLRC had over passed their mandate: JHU | publisher=Daily Mirror | date=December 27, 2011 | accessdate=December 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
In October 2010 the government established the Inter-Agency Advisory Committee headed by the then attorney general [[Mohan Peiris]] to implement the LLRC's interim recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Govt. says it endorsed adoption of LLRC recommendations|url=http://www.ft.lk/2011/02/04/govt-says-it-endorsed-adoption-of-llrc-recommendations/|newspaper=[[Daily FT]]|date=4 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the recommendations remain largely unimplemented.&lt;ref name=TNA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jayawardene|first=Kishali Pinto|title=The 'whitewash' of the LLRC's recommendations|url=http://sundaytimes.lk/120129/Columns/focus.html|newspaper=[[Sunday Times (Sri Lanka)]]|date=29 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The LLRC Report and our options for recociliatio|url=http://www.island.lk/index.php?page_cat=article-details&amp;page=article-details&amp;code_title=46526#|newspaper=The Island|location=Sri Lanka|date=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Letter on Sri Lanka to Permanent Representatives of Human Rights Council Member and Observer States|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/02/02/letter-sri-lanka-permanent-representatives-human-rights-council-member-and-observer-|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]|date=2 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LLRC's final report admits that there had been no progress in the implementation of its interim recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Radhakrishnan|first=R.

On March 13, 2012, the Sri Lankan government released a statement on the formulation of an action plan to implement the recommendations of LLRC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Action Plan for LLRC Implementation Soon|url=http://www.priu.gov.lk/new|publisher=The Official Website of the Government of Sri Lanka|accessdate=27 April 2012}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a study by the Colombo-based think tank [[Verité Research]], only 20 percent of the commission’s 189 actionable recommendations have been implemented, with 57% of the cases being described as "partial implementation" and 22% of the cases being described as "poor" in progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/world/%E2%80%9CLanka-fulfilled-only-11--of-pledges-to-UNHRC-and-20-of-pledges-to-LLRC%E2%80%9D-says-study/2016/07/03/article3512016.ece|title="Lanka fulfilled only 11 % of pledges to UNHRC and 20% of pledges to LLRC", says study|last=Balachandran|first=P.K.|date=3 July 2016|website=[[The New Indian Express]]|publisher=|access-date=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of commission==
The LLRC has been criticized by international human rights groups, the [[Report of the Secretary-General's Panel of Experts on Accountability in Sri Lanka|UN Panel of Experts]] and others due its limited mandate, alleged lack of independence and its failure to meet minimum international standards or offer protection to witnesses.&lt;ref name=BBC110810&gt;{{cite news|title=Sri Lankan war inquiry commission opens amid criticism|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-10934663|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=11 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UN&gt;{{cite book|title=Report of the Secretary-General's Panel of Experts on Accountability in Sri Lanka|publisher=[[United Nations]]|url=https://www.un.org/News/dh/infocus/Sri_Lanka/POE_Report_Full.pdf|date=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These critics argued that the commission was primarily set up to examine the failure of the 2002 ceasefire and had no explicit mandate to examine the [[Alleged war crimes during the Sri Lankan Civil War|alleged war crimes]] committed by both sides during the final months of the civil war.&lt;ref name=BBC110810/&gt;&lt;ref name=HRW270510&gt;{{cite web|title=Letter to Secretary Clinton on the Sri Lanka's Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC)|url=https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/05/27/letter-secretary-clinton-sri-lankas-lessons-learnt-and-reconciliation-commission-llr|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]|date=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the Sri Lankan government rejected the UN's war report calling it "fundamentally flawed" and "patently biased".&lt;ref name=BBC130411&gt;{{cite news|last=Haviland|first=Charles|title=Sri Lanka rejects secret UN war report as 'flawed'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-13069063|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to criticism, previous commissions of inquiry established by the Sri Lankan government had failed to achieve anything other than delaying criminal investigations and had been plagued by government interference.&lt;ref name=BBC110810/&gt;

The independence of the commission has been questioned due to the fact its members were appointed by the Sri Lankan government, one of the parties accused of committing war crimes. Most of its members were retired senior government employees.&lt;ref name=ICG141010/&gt; Some even held senior government positions during the final stages of the war when they publicly defended the conduct of the government and military against allegations of war crimes.&lt;ref name=ICG141010/&gt; H.

The commission was seen as a tool to discredit the opposition [[United National Party]] whose leader [[Ranil Wickramasinghe]] was [[Prime Minister of Sri Lanka|Prime Minister]] when the ceasefire agreement with the LTTE was signed in 2002.{{Citation needed|reason=Seen by who?|date=January 2014}} The [[BBC]] was banned from covering the proceeding.&lt;ref name="sundal1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thesundayleader.lk/2010/09/19/bbc-banned-from-northern-hearings/ | title=BBC banned from Northern hearing | publisher=The Sunday Leader | date=19 September 2010 | accessdate=31 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction to report==

===Sri Lanka===
The report was generally received well within Sri Lanka,{{Citation needed|reason="Generally" is pretty vague. According to word of mouth or publications?|date=January 2014}} although some aspects of the report were criticized by various political groups and figures.

The [[Tamil National Alliance]] (TNA), the largest political party representing the Sri Lankan Tamils, criticised the report for categorically failing to "effectively and meaningfully deal with issues of accountability" and called its findings an offence against the dignity of the war victims.&lt;ref name=hindu&gt;{{cite news|last=Radhakrishnan|first=R. K.|title=TNA wants accountability mechanism for Sri Lanka|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article2729067.ece|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TNA has called on the international community to establish a "mechanism for accountability" in order to bring to book the perpetrators of war crimes.&lt;ref name=hindu/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=TNA demands internationally mandated mechanism for war-crimes accountability|url=http://www.tamilnet.com/art.html?catid=13&amp;artid=34720|newspaper=[[TamilNet]]|date=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with [[The Sunday Leader]] TNA leader [[R. Sampanthan]] expressed his disappointment of the report stating: "on the particular issue of accountability with regard to violation of international humanitarian laws and international human rights laws by the Sri Lankan Government."&lt;ref name="sunsd1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thesundayleader.lk/2011/12/25/disappointed-and-unhappy-the-tna-on-the-llrc-report/ | title=Disappointed And Unhappy: The TNA On The LLRC Report | publisher=The Sunday Leader | date=December 25, 2011 | accessdate=December 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said that the report has not done justice for the many thousands of victims of the war. According to TNA MP [[M. A. Sumanthiran]] the LLRC had contradicted itself by maintaining that it had no mandate to investigate into any incident and yet clearing of the armed forces of deliberately targeting civilians.&lt;ref name=SL181211&gt;{{cite news|last=Abeywickrema|first=Mandana Ismail|url=http://www.thesundayleader.lk/2011/12/18/tna-finds-contradictions-in-llrc-report/|title=TNA Finds Contradictions In LLRC Report|newspaper=[[The Sunday Leader]]|date=18 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; “How can the LLRC come to such a conclusion without investigating into the matter”, Sumanthiran queried.&lt;ref name=SL181211/&gt; The TNA subsequently issued a 115-page analytical response to the LLRC report in which it concluded that the LLRC had "failed to fulfill the expectations of the Tamil community" and that it did "not address important questions of accountability; was designed to shield civilian and military leaders responsible for serious crimes from blame; and evinces the Sri Lankan State’s unwillingness to acknowledge and address issues of accountability".&lt;ref name=TNA&gt;{{cite web|title=TNA Analytical Response to the LLRC Report|url=https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B0vgVMXCVudFMzFmNDBkYmMtNGIxNy00MjExLWFjNGYtZjEwZTk3OTQ2NGVm/edit?pli=1|publisher=[[Tamil National Alliance]]|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Radhakrishnan|first=R.

[[Jathika Hela Urumaya]], a Sinhalise national group, claimed that LLRC had over passed their mandate and had failed to look into the 9,878 civil assassinations carried out by the LTTE.&lt;ref name="daylim"/&gt;

[[Doctor (title)|Dr.]] [[Dayan Jayatilleka]], former Sri Lankan ambassador to France, commenting on the report stated "Though not without flaws and lacuna, LLRC report does not disappoint, and reaches high standards, ranking with the best reports emanating over the decades from official and semi-official/autonomous Sri Lankan commissions, reviews and probes. It is a serious, thoughtful, carefully written and constructed text, striking in its fair-mindedness and balance. It deserves constructive engagement with, by all concerned Sri Lankan citizens and those in the world community who are concerned about and with Sri Lanka."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://groundviews.org/2011/12/21/llrc-report-reason-reform-roadmap/ | title=LLRC Report: Reason, reform, roadmap | publisher=Groundviews | date=December 21, 2011 | accessdate=December 31, 2011 | author=Jayatilleka, Dayan}}&lt;/ref&gt; He pointed out two factual inaccuracies in the report. The first one being that the 2002 CFA was the result and in the context of the military weakness of the Sri Lankan state. He explained, this had in fact not been the case as at that time, [[Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol (Sri Lanka)|LRRP]] missions were taking down the Tiger command structure and followed and not preceded the disastrous Agni Kheela operation and the devastating [[Bandaranaike Airport attack]]. Second one is that LLRC Report draws a veil of silence over the lopsided post-tsunami relief mechanism (PTOMS) which was negotiated at the tail end of the presidency of [[Chandrika Kumaratunga]].

Editorial of "The Island" — the Sri Lankan English language daily — named "LLRC shows the way" (19 December 2011) compared the LLRC report with the [[Report of the Secretary-General's Panel of Experts on Accountability in Sri Lanka]] saying, "Unlike the UN Secretary General's advisory panel which took cover behind a wall of secrecy and hurriedly put together a report of sorts--which has been made out to be a UN document--based on mere unsubstantiated allegations and LTTE propaganda, the LLRC has ensured transparency in the process of inquiry and presented both sides of the story complete with its observations and recommendations."&lt;ref name="islned"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.defence.lk/new.asp?fname=20111219_03 | title=LLRC shows the way - Island Editorial | publisher=Ministry of Defence (Sri Lanka) | work=The Island | date=December 19, 2011 | accessdate=January 1, 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303225826/http://www.defence.lk/new.asp?fname=20111219_03 | archivedate=March 3, 2016 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Editorial of "The Sunday Times" — the Sri Lankan English language daily — named "Heed LLRC's call to save Rule of Law" noted that while "the commission was not something the Government had in mind in the flush of its military victory over the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in May 2009", it "quite correctly placed much of the blame for this polarization on politicians who were looking to bolster their vote base by whipping up the communal drum". It also stated that "This LLRC report is not to be taken lightly due to both international and domestic pressure for good governance. This report is in a completely different league."&lt;ref name="sundatms"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sundaytimes.lk/111218/Editorial.html | title=Heed LLRC's call to save Rule of Law | publisher=The Sunday Times | date=December 18, 2011 | accessdate=January 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{IND}} - While welcoming the public release of the LLRC report, an official spokesperson of [[Ministry of External Affairs (India)|India’s External Affairs Ministry]] expressed hope that Sri Lanka would act decisively and with vision on devolution of powers and genuine national reconciliation.&lt;ref name=MEA251211&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission of Sri Lanka|url=http://www.mea.gov.in/mystart.php?id=100518810|publisher=[[Ministry of External Affairs (India)|Indian Ministry of External Affairs]]|date=25 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="colna"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.colombopage.com/archive_11B/Dec25_1324836822CH.php | title=India welcomes LLRC report, expects Sri Lanka to act decisively with vision on reconciliation | publisher=Colombo Page | date=December 25, 2011 | accessdate=December 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spokesperson concluded that "It is important to ensure that an independent and credible mechanism is put in place to investigate allegations of human rights violations, as brought out the LLRC, in a time-bound manner".&lt;ref name=MEA251211/&gt;

{{ZAF}} - The [[Department of International Relations and Cooperation]] issued as statement on 30 January 2012 noting the release of the final report and its positive recommendations.&lt;ref name=DIRC300112&gt;{{cite web|title=South African Government position on the Report of the Commission of Inquiry on Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation (LLRC) in Sri Lanka|url=http://www.dfa.gov.za/docs/2012/sri0130.html|publisher=[[Department of International Relations and Cooperation]]|date=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the statement noted that the report failed to address in detail "the question of holding those people responsible for human rights violations to account".&lt;ref name=DIRC300112/&gt; The [[South African government]] urged the Sri Lankan government to implement the reports recommendations "speedily".&lt;ref name=DIRC300112/&gt;

{{UK}} - [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] Minister [[Alistair Burt]] issued a statement to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on 12 January 2012 welcoming the publication of the report but expressing disappointment at the report’s findings and recommendations on accountability.&lt;ref name=FCO120112&gt;{{cite web|title=Foreign Office Minister responds to report on the conflict in Sri Lanka|url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/news/latest-news/?view=PressS&amp;id=714679782|publisher=[[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]]|date=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TN130112&gt;{{cite news|title=UK disappointed with LLRC’s recommendations on accountability|url=http://www.tamilnet.com/art.html?catid=13&amp;artid=34786|newspaper=[[TamilNet]]|date=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement went on to say "Like many others, we feel that these leave many gaps and unanswered questions...we note that many credible allegations of violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law, including from the UN Panel of Experts report, are either not addressed or only partially answered".&lt;ref name=FCO120112/&gt; The [[Government of the United Kingdom|British Government]] would, according to the statement, work with international partners, including relevant international organisations, to achieve lasting peace and reconciliation in Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name=FCO120112/&gt;

{{UNO}} - [[UN Secretary-General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]] welcomed the public release of LLRC report and hoped "that the Sri Lankan Government will move forward on its commitments to deal with accountability...in good faith as an essential step towards reconciliation and lasting peace in the island country".&lt;ref name="slbc"/&gt;&lt;ref name=UN171211&gt;{{cite web|title=Sri Lanka: Ban voices hope Government will take steps on accountability|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=40767&amp;Cr=Lanka&amp;Cr1=|publisher=UN News Centre|date=17 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 19th session of the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] [[Navi Pillay]], [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|UN High Commissioner for Human Rights]], welcomed the report's publications and noted that it makes important recommendations.&lt;ref name=OHCHR&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Rights Council 19th Session United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Introduction of Annual Report 2011|url=http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11896&amp;LangID=E|publisher=[[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]]|date=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Pillay believed that the report fell "short of the comprehensive accountability process recommended by the Secretary-General’s Panel of Experts" and she went on the urge the UNHRC to discuss the report.&lt;ref name=OHCHR/&gt;

{{USA}} - Commenting on the report, deputy spokesperson of the [[United States Department of State]] [[Victoria Nuland]] expressed concern that it "does not fully address all the allegations of serious human rights violations that occurred in the final phase of the conflict".&lt;ref name=State191211&gt;{{cite web|title=Daily Press Briefing|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2011/12/178982.htm#SRILANKA|publisher=[[United States Department of State]]|date=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="colpus"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.colombopage.com/archive_11B/Dec20_1324356964CH.php | title=United States urges Sri Lanka to go beyond implementing LLRC recommendations | publisher=Colombo Page | date=December 20, 2011 | accessdate=December 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She therefore urged the Sri Lankan government not only to fulfil all of the LLRC's recommendations but also to address the accountability issues that the report did not cover.&lt;ref name=State191211/&gt; On the issue of an independent, international probe into the final phase of the war, Nuland stated that the position of the USA remains that "it is better for Sri Lankans to take these issues themselves and address them fully...let’s see what they are willing to do going forward".&lt;ref name=State191211/&gt;&lt;ref name=TN201211&gt;{{cite news|title=US wants to see 'LLRC gaps' filled domestically by Colombo|url=http://www.tamilnet.com/art.html?catid=13&amp;artid=34719|newspaper=[[TamilNet]]|date=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human rights groups===
Following the release of the report, Amnesty International noted that the LLRC report "acknowledges serious human rights problems in Sri Lanka but falls short of fully addressing the war crimes and crimes against humanity committed during the final phases of the conflict".&lt;ref name=AI161211&gt;{{cite web|title=Sri Lanka Report Falls Short|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/sri-lanka-report-falls-short-2011-12-16|publisher=[[Amnesty International]]|date=16 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="amnas"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thesundayleader.lk/2011/12/18/un-studying-llrc-report/ | title=UN Studying LLRC Report | publisher=The Sunday Leader | date=December 18, 2011 | accessdate=December 31, 2011 | author=Rutnam, Easwaran}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Amnesty the report ignores the "serious evidence of war crimes, crimes against humanity and other violations of the laws of war by government forces".&lt;ref name=AI161211/&gt; Amnesty urged the Sri Lankan authorities to take the report's recommendations seriously but concluded that, based on previous experience, "effective investigation and prosecution of all wrongdoers...is very unlikely without the active support of the international community".&lt;ref name=AI161211/&gt;

Human Rights Watch has condemned the LLRC report for disregarding the worst abuses by government forces, rehashing long-standing recommendations and failing to advance accountability for victims of Sri Lanka’s civil armed conflict.&lt;ref name=HRW161211&gt;{{cite web|title=Sri Lanka: Report Fails to Advance Accountability|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2011/12/16/sri-lanka-report-fails-advance-accountability|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]|date=16 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=LLRC has failed, IC should call for International Investigation: HRW|url=http://www.tamilnet.com/art.html?catid=13&amp;artid=34707|newspaper=[[TamilNet]]|date=17 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; HRW has stated that the "serious shortcomings" of the report highlighted "the need for an international investigative mechanism into the conflict as recommended by the United Nations Secretary-General’s Panel of Experts".&lt;ref name=HRW161211/&gt;

The International Crisis Group welcomed the public release of the LLRC report but noted that it failed in a crucial task - "providing the thorough and independent investigation of alleged violations of international humanitarian and human rights law that the UN and other partners of Sri Lanka have been asking for".&lt;ref name=ICG221211&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement on the Report of Sri Lanka's Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission|url=http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/publication-type/media-releases/2011/asia/statement-on-the-report-of-sri-lanka-s-lessons-learnt-and-reconciliation-commission.aspx|publisher=[[International Crisis Group]]|date=22 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121021719/http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/publication-type/media-releases/2011/asia/statement-on-the-report-of-sri-lanka-s-lessons-learnt-and-reconciliation-commission.aspx|archivedate=21 January 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC231211&gt;{{cite news|title=ICG welcomes war panel report|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sinhala/news/story/2011/12/111223_llrc_icg_npc.shtml|newspaper=[[BBC]] Sinhala|date=23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ICG urged the international community to establish an independent international investigation in 2012.&lt;ref name=ICG221211/&gt;

===Others===
In an [[Op-ed|opinion piece]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' the members of the UN Secretary-General's Panel of Experts on Accountability in Sri Lanka ([[Marzuki Darusman]], Steven R. Ratner and Yasmin Sooka) criticised the LLRC report for ignoring or playing down their report's conclusions and for characterising the civilian deaths as a consequence of the army’s response to Tamil Tiger shelling or cross-fire.&lt;ref name=NYT020312&gt;{{cite news|title=Revisiting Sri Lanka's Bloody War|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/03/opinion/revisiting-sri-lankas-bloody-war.html?scp=2&amp;sq=Sri%20Lanka&amp;st=cse|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=2 March 2012|author=Marzuki Darusman|author2=Steven Ratner|author3=Yasmin Sooka}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also criticised the report's recommendations that the army and the attorney general carry out further investigation as these organisations had ignored "governmental abuses for decades".&lt;ref name=NYT020312/&gt; Noting that the Sri Lankan government had failed to implement prior commissions recommendations and its "unwillingness to take concrete steps", they concluded that the only way for the truth to be exposed is for the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] "to create an independent investigative body to determine the facts and identify those responsible".&lt;ref name=NYT020312/&gt;

The [[Global Tamil Forum]] (GTF), an umbrella group for [[Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora]] groups, has welcomed the report's publications, stating that its findings "only serve to emphasise the importance of establishing an international, independent accountability mechanism to investigate whether Government forces and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) breached any international law, committed war crimes and crimes against humanity in the last months of the war".&lt;ref name=GTF241211&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Tamil Forum on LLRC|url=http://globaltamilforum.org/userfiles/file/GTF%20Press%20Statement%2024%20Dec%202011%20-%20Global%20Tamil%20Forum%20on%20LLRC.pdf|publisher=[[Global Tamil Forum]]|date=24 December 2011}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The GTF acknowledged some the report's judgements and recommendations but noted that some of its conclusions on the prosecution of the conflict contradicted many of the findings of the UN Panel of Experts.&lt;ref name=GTF241211/&gt;

Editor-in-Chief of [[The Hindu]] — the Indian English-language daily — [[N. Ram]] in his 22 December 2011 editorial stated that the report has established a key fact — that there were "considerable" civilian casualties in the final stages of the military operation to crush the LTTE. The editorial went into detail that "Given the ethnic polarisation in Sri Lanka, these recommendations seem painfully insufficient. Even so, this is Sri Lanka's first attempt at introspection about the war. If the government is serious about reconciliation and learning lessons from the past, it must make a start by acting on the LLRC's recommendations."&lt;ref name="thehindu"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/article2735656.ece | title=Experiment with truth | publisher=[[The Hindu]] | date=December 22, 2011 | accessdate=January 1, 2012 | author=Ram, N.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commenting on the LLRC report, Col. R. Hariharan, a retired Military Intelligence officer of the [[Indian Army]] and a columnist of [[South Asia Analysis Group]], said that "LLRC report is constructive and covers almost all issues that relate to aberrations in governance, lack of transparency and the need to take speedy action on restoring confidence among Tamil minority."&lt;ref name="eura"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.eurasiareview.com/30122011-sri-lanka-making-llrc-report-meaningful-analysis/ | title=Sri Lanka: Making LLRC Report Meaningful – Analysis | publisher=Eurasia Review | work=Col. R. Hariharan | date=December 30, 2011 | accessdate=December 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also added "The report provides badly needed breathing space for the government, as the Commission has done a fairly good job if one goes by the President’s mandate given to it. The well written report analyses in detail the reasons for past and present discontent of Tamils and has drawn the government attention to a number issues that had triggered Tamil insurgency."  
In an opinion piece in ''The New York Times'' journalist Namini Wijedasa describes the report as "largely an apologia for the [[Sri Lanka Army|army]]" in respect of the events in the final stages of the civil war.&lt;ref name=NYT301211&gt;{{cite news|last=Wijedasa|first=Namini|title=Sri Lanka’s Ghosts of War|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/31/opinion/sri-lankas-ghosts-of-war.html?_r=2|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Wijedasa, whilst the report makes sensible recommendations, exposes the grave atrocities committed by the LTTE and demonstrates that the government forces shelled the No Fire Zones, it only admits that civilians were killed by [[crossfire]] and blames the LTTE for most of the casualties.&lt;ref name=NYT301211/&gt; Wijedasa concludes that "Sri Lankans no longer need to pretend that the army didn’t shell zones where civilians were encouraged to gather [by the army], or subscribe to the fantasy that no innocents died when shells landed on or near hospitals".&lt;ref name=NYT301211/&gt;

Expressing his support to the LLRC, [[Australian Labor Party]] member of the [[Victorian Legislative Assembly]] [[Telmo Languiller]] said that LLRC report covers all relevant ground and sets the framework for practical reconciliation in Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name="danln2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailynews.lk/2011/12/31/news02.asp | title=LLRC report covers all relevant ground - Australian MP | publisher=Daily News | date=December 31, 2011 | accessdate=December 31, 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211222453/http://www.dailynews.lk/2011/12/31/news02.asp | archivedate=February 11, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Namini Wijedasa, a Sri Lankan journalist, called the report "an apologia for the army".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wijedasa|first=Namini|title=Sri Lanka’s Ghosts of War|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/31/opinion/sri-lankas-ghosts-of-war.html?ref=srilanka|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in the final weeks when the government took violent measures to defeat the LTTE, the commission only admitted, "civilian casualties had in fact occurred in the course of crossfire".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Perera|first=Amrith Rohan|url=http://slembassyusa.org/downloads/LLRC-REPORT.pdf.|title=Report of the COMMISSION OF INQUIRY ON LESSONS LEARNT AND RECONCILIATION |work=Report of the Commission of Inquiry on the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==UN Human Rights Council 19th session==
Report by Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission became the basis for the discussion on Sri Lanka at the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] 19th session in March 2012. The council adopted a resolution on promoting reconciliation and accountability in Sri Lanka, urging the Sri Lankan government to implement constructive recommendations made in the LLRC report.&lt;ref name="ohchr1"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=12001&amp;LangID=E | title=Human Rights Council adopts seven texts on Sri Lanka, Adequate Housing, Right to Food, and extends the mandate on Cultural Rights | work=[[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] | date=March 22, 2012 | accessdate=March 23, 2012 | location=[[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution welcomed the constructive recommendations contained in the report and noted with concern that the report did not adequately address serious allegations of violations of international law.&lt;ref name="AdaDerana"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=17470 | title=Two crucial amendments to Lankan resolution, India instrumental | date=March 23, 2012 | agency=Ada Derana | accessdate=March 23, 2012 | location=[[Colombo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two last-minute changes to the resolution, pressed by India, made it "unobtrusive" in nature and "non-judgemental" in approach.&lt;ref name="indiaexpress"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/india-votes-against-sri-lanka-but-sugarcoats-us-resolution/927163/0 | title=India votes against Sri Lanka but sugarcoats US resolution | work=[[The Indian Express]] | date=March 22, 2012 | accessdate=March 23, 2012 | author=Roy, Shubhajit | location=[[New Delhi]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; These amendments gave the government of Sri Lanka a [[veto]] over any future recommendations by the OHCHR.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/un-human-rights-body-to-vote-on-resolution-calling-for-sri-lanka-war-crimes-probes/2012/03/22/gIQAP9cETS_story.html | title=UN rights body approves resolution pressing Sri Lanka to conduct credible war crime probes | work=[[Washington Post]] | date=March 22, 2012 | agency=[[Associated Press]] | accessdate=March 23, 2012 | location=[[Geneva]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was no reference to [[Alleged war crimes during the Sri Lankan Civil War|alleged war crimes]] or an international investigation, as called for by human rights groups.&lt;ref name="asiatimes"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/NC24Df01.html | title=Sri Lanka unfazed by UN rights resolution | work=[[Asia Times]] | date=March 23, 2012 | accessdate=March 23, 2012 | author=Perera, Amantha | location=[[Colombo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Marco Polo''''' is an [[opera]] by the Chinese-born composer [[Tan Dun]] set to an English [[libretto]] by [[Paul Griffiths (writer)|Paul Griffiths]]. It premiered in [[Munich]] on 7 May 1996. Described variously as an "opera within an opera"&lt;ref&gt;G. Schirmer&lt;/ref&gt; and a "fantasia on an epic journey",&lt;ref&gt;Smith (December 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; the multi-layered storyline is loosely based on the journey of [[Marco Polo]] from Venice to China. In the opera, Marco Polo becomes two characters: Marco, who represents the real person and is sung by a mezzo-soprano, and Polo who represents his memory and is sung by a tenor. The work is scored for vocal soloists, a chorus of 20 and a large orchestra of both modern and medieval European instruments as well as instruments from the cultures that Marco Polo passed through on his journey, including [[sitar]], [[pipa]], [[Sheng (instrument)|sheng]], [[tabla]] and [[Music of Tibet|Tibetan]] horns and bells. ''Marco Polo'' won the 1998 [[Grawemeyer Award (Music Composition)|Grawemeyer Award for Music Composition]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://grawemeyer.org/music/previous-winners/1998-tan-dun.html grawemeyer.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005205913/http://grawemeyer.org/music/previous-winners/1998-tan-dun.html |date=2011-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mariamne''''' is a 1725 French [[tragedy]] by [[Augustin Nadal]] based around the [[Herodian dynasty]]. Nadal was encouraged to produce the play after his rival [[Voltaire]]'s play [[Mariamne (Voltaire play)|on the same story]] had failed after only one performance the previous year (1724). However, at the play's February 1725 premiere at the [[Comédie-Française]], the audience booed its opening scenes and demanded that Voltaire's play be put on instead.

Nadal was convinced his own ''Mariamne'' had failed because of Voltaire's ''"brigue horrible et scandaleuse"'' that set Paris against it, and said so in the preface to the printed play, accusing him of bringing a cabal into the audience at the premiere to disrupt it. This gave Voltaire the opportunity to reply under a [[pseudonym]] with withering compliments ("Lettre de M. Thieriot à M. l'Abbé Nadal", 1725), commiserating with Nadal, that it was solely the machinations of Voltaire's intrigues "that one hears it said so scandalously that you are the worst versifier of the century and the most tiresome writer."&lt;ref&gt;''"qu’on entend dire si scandaleusement que vous êtes le plus mauvais versificateur du siècle, et le plus ennuyeux écrivain."''&lt;/ref&gt; Voltaire's fine-honed savagery inspired Nadal to excise the uncomplimentary remarks about Voltaire in his prefaces when he came to collect and publish the plays in 1736 with others of his poems, in three small volumes. But it is in Voltaire's response that the abbé Nadal is remembered.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7691">'''Overbilling''' (sometimes spelled as '''over-billing''') is the practice of charging more than is legally or ethically acceptable on an invoice or bill.

==Overview==

===Contractors and professionals===
Overbilling in the medical industry can occur when doctors seek to overcharge the government or an insurance company for the actual services provided to their patients or by charging for services not provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5WUxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8aQFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1298,3846318&amp;dq=overbilling&amp;hl=en |publisher=''[[Montreal Gazette]]'' |accessdate=July 8, 2013 |title=Over-billing isn't the Rx |date=March 10, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overbilling in the legal industry can occur with both large institutional clients and smaller, individual companies or personal clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thestar.com.my/story.aspx?file=%2f2008%2f6%2f20%2fnorth%2f21602917&amp;sec=North |title=Beware of over-billing by lawyers, says CAP |date=June 20, 2008 |accessdate=July 8, 2013 |publisher=''The Star Online''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overbilling can be an issue in the consultancy and [[information technology]] industries as well. Stephen Northcutt, Cynthia Madden, and Cynthia Welti wrote that overbilling occurs more often within larger companies where there is less of a personal connection between employees or contractors and the firm being billed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=387 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aC857RycBD0C&amp;pg=PA387&amp;dq=overbilling&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rFnbUd6hNYWWrgGXuYC4Cw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=overbilling&amp;f=false |title=IT Ethics Handbook:: Right and Wrong for IT Professionals |author1=Stephen Northcutt |author2=Cynthia Madden |author3=Cynthia Welti  |last-author-amp=yes |accessdate=July 8, 2013 |date=2004 |publisher=Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institutional overbilling===
Overbilling can occur when larger institutions or governments create errors in their calculations of how much various individuals may owe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://seattletimes.com/avantgo/2017356005.html |publisher=''[[Seattle Times]]'' |accessdate=July 8, 2013 |date=January 28, 2012 |title=DOT identifies overbilling of Highway 520 tolls |author=Mike Lindblom}}&lt;/ref&gt; Banks and credit card providers can also overbill clients, or indirectly facilitate overbilling through the method by which they allow vendors to charge a client after the client has accented to having their card billed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mqjfZ5X2rgcC&amp;pg=PA130&amp;dq=overbilling&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rFnbUd6hNYWWrgGXuYC4Cw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=overbilling&amp;f=false |page=130 |title=Personal Finance in Singapore |author=Chwee Huat Tan |publisher=NUS Press |year=2001 |accessdate=July 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that overbilling is rampant enough in some industries that employees that refuse to overbill risk their jobs due to a lack of economic foresight or acuity in management policies or business plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YQx6FzVFkqMC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=overbilling&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=a2fbUYqONIfBqAHw3YHACg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=overbilling&amp;f=false |page=42 |accessdate=July 8, 2013 |date=2007 |title=The Cheating Culture: Why More Americans Are Doing Wrong to Get Ahead |author=David Callahan |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laws==
Overbilling clients can constitute an example of [[breach of contract]] and result in fines, lawsuits, or prison time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7ha4rMsqIMwC&amp;pg=PA150&amp;dq=overbilling&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zlnbUZKcKofnqwGNoYGYDA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=overbilling&amp;f=false |page=150 |accessdate=July 8, 2013 |title=Contemporary Security Management |author=John Fay |year=2006 |publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ywZ3cmqbSLUC&amp;pg=PT67&amp;dq=overbilling&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rFnbUd6hNYWWrgGXuYC4Cw&amp;redir_esc=y |author=Darlene Ricker |accessdate=July 8, 2013 |date=August 1994 |title=Greed, Ignorance, &amp; Overbilling |page=ff |publisher=''[[ABA Journal]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overbilling can also be a part of U.S. [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]] schemes and other organized crime activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZdAb_PiNkM0C&amp;pg=SA4-PA18&amp;dq=overbilling&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CVrbUfiNLcTurQHg0oGICw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=overbilling&amp;f=false |pages=4–18 |title=Civil RICO Practice Manual |accessdate=July 8, 2013 |author=Paul A. Batista |year=2007 |publisher=Aspen Publishers Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some individuals that have been convicted of overbilling were done so under the charge of mail fraud, or under the ''[[False Claims Act]]'' in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ipvh76CryVoC&amp;pg=PA116&amp;dq=overbilling&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CVrbUfiNLcTurQHg0oGICw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=overbilling&amp;f=false |pages=116–117 |title=Crime: Computer Viruses to Twin Towers |accessdate=July 8, 2013 |author=H. Thomas Milhorn |publisher=Universal-Publishers |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leonard Vona wrote that, "Overbilling schemes differ from false billing schemes in that the vendor is a real vendor and actual goods or services are provided. The real vendor typically commits the scheme in collusion with a company employee. The real vendor over charges the company and an accounts payable manager approves the vendor invoice for payment. The vendor can commit the scheme without internal collusion by taking advantage of known internal control weaknesses." He also wrote that overbilling can occur via fictitious charges, inflated prices, inflating the quantity on a statement above the actual quantity delivery, providing sub-standard products, charging for goods or services a vendor knows a company does not need, charging too much, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O0x7nzdk6gEC&amp;pg=PT96&amp;dq=overbilling&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rFnbUd6hNYWWrgGXuYC4Cw&amp;redir_esc=y |title=Fraud Risk Assessment: Building a Fraud Audit Program |author=Leonard W. Vona |accessdate=July 8, 2013 |date=2012 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-overbilling practices==
Overbilling is a part of many fraud audit infrastructures employed by large companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e0xUdMHkGbIC&amp;pg=PA169&amp;dq=overbilling&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rFnbUd6hNYWWrgGXuYC4Cw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=overbilling&amp;f=false |page=169 |accessdate=July 8, 2013 |date=2011 |title=The Fraud Audit: Responding to the Risk of Fraud in Core Business Systems |author=Leonard W. Vona |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt; Computer programs and software is often used to screen a company's finances to check for overbilling or symptoms of overbilling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2VLLMXzh26wC&amp;pg=PT171&amp;dq=overbilling&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CVrbUfiNLcTurQHg0oGICw&amp;redir_esc=y |accessdate=July 8, 2013 |title=Computer Aided Fraud Prevention and Detection: A Step by Step Guide |author=David Coderre |year=2009 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overbilling has been the focus of several infamous scandals, such as the [[Worldcom#Accounting scandals|Worldcom scandal]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/telecom/2002-07-03-wcom-overbilling.htm |date=March 7, 2002 |accessdate=July 8, 2013 |publisher=''[[USA Today]]'' |title=Overbilling issue may add to WorldCom's trouble}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the bankruptcy of [[W.

'''Paper Sun''' is a single by British band [[Def Leppard]] from their 9th album [[Euphoria (Def Leppard album)|Euphoria]]. It charted at #11 on the [[US Mainstream Rock]] Charts. It failed to chart elsewhere however. It is included on the second disc of the compilation album [[Rock of Ages: The Definitive Collection]].

Lyrically the song is about the [[Omagh bombing]] which occurred on August 15, 1998.
After being omitted from tour set lists since the Euphoria World Tour in 2000, the song has now been returned to Def Leppard's set list for their [[Def Leppard World Tour 2015|2015 World Tour]] with Tesla and Styx.

'''Paris–Rouen''', '''''Le Petit Journal'' Horseless Carriages Contest''' (''Concours du 'Petit Journal' Les Voitures sans Chevaux''), was a pioneering city-to-city [[Auto racing|motoring competition]] in 1894 which is sometimes described as the world's first competitive motor race.

The contest was organised by the newspaper ''[[Le Petit Journal (newspaper)|Le Petit Journal]]'' and run from Paris to [[Rouen]] in France on 22 July 1894. It was preceded by four days of vehicle exhibition and qualifying events that created great crowds and excitement. The eight {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} qualifying events started near the Bois de Boulogne and comprised interwoven routes around Paris to select the entrants for the main {{convert|126|km|mi|abbr=on}} event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6130110/f1.image Le petit journal, publication of 20 December, column 1, Article 8]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first driver across the finishing line at Rouen was "''[[Count|le Comte]]'' [[Jules-Albert de Dion|de Dion]]" but he did not win the main prize because his steam vehicle needed a 'stoker' and was thus ineligible. The fastest petrol powered car was a {{convert|3|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}} [[Peugeot]] driven by [[Albert Lemaître]]. The premier prize, the 5,000 franc ''Prix du Petit Journal'', for 'the competitor whose car comes closest to the ideal' was shared equally by manufacturers [[Panhard et Levassor]] and [[Peugeot|Les fils de Peugeot frères]] ("The sons of Peugeot brothers"), with vehicles that were 'easy to use'.&lt;ref name="8W"&gt;[http://forix.autosport.com/8w/bdb.html Forix, Autosport, 8W – Welcome to Who?

===Organisation===
In 1894, [[Pierre Giffard]], editor of  ''[[Le Petit Journal (newspaper)|Le Petit Journal]]'', organised the world's first motoring competition from Paris to Rouen to publicise his newspaper, to stimulate interest in motoring and to develop French motor manufacturing. Sporting events were a tried and tested form of publicity stunt and circulation booster. The paper promoted it as "Le Petit Journal Competition for Horseless Carriages" (''Le Petit Journal Concours des Voitures sans Chevaux'') that were "not dangerous, easy to drive, and cheap during the journey", the main prize being for "the competitor whose car comes closest to the ideal". The "easy to drive" clause effectively precluded from the prizes any vehicles needing a travelling mechanic or technical assistant such as a stoker.&lt;ref name="8W"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LPJ 19 Dec 1893"&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k613010m Gallica, Online Archive, ''Le Petit Journal'' 19 December 1893 – Announcement]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Le Petit Journal'' announced prize money totalling 10,000 [[French franc#French Empire and Restoration|gold franc]]s – 5,000 for first place, 2,000 for second, 1,500 for third; 1,000 for fourth, and 500 for fifth. The main prize was for the first eligible vehicle across the finish line in Rouen.&lt;ref name="LPJ 19 Dec 1893"/&gt;

===Entrants===
:''See [[Paris–Rouen (motor race)#List of entrants|full list of 102 entrants]]''
One-hundred and two people paid the 10 franc entrance fee. They ranged from practical manufacturers like [[Peugeot]], [[Panhard]], [[de Dion-Bouton]], and [[Serpollet]] to amateur owners and 'over-ambitious concepts'. Seventy-eight entrants did not show up for qualifying on 18 July, these included some 25 powered by unfamiliar and improbable technologies such as "gravity" – nine; "compressed air" – five; "automatic" – three; electricity – three; gas – three; hydraulics – two; liquid, pedals, propellers, and levers. Additionally, 19 petrol-powered designs and 26 steam-powered cars, quadricycles, and tricycles did not show up at the qualifying event.&lt;ref name="8W"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cent Ans"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Quali"/&gt;

===Qualifying===
Qualifying was held from 19–21 July 1894, and was preceded by a public exhibition of 26 cars to [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]] on 18 July. Journalists reported great crowds and excitement throughout the routes, and at [[Précy-sur-Oise]] they finished through a triumphal arch. On 19 July, 26 cars lined the side of the [[Porte Maillot|Boulevard Maillot]], stretching to the [[Bois de Boulogne]], each parked {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on}} apart until, at 8:00 am, the first car led off, followed at 15-second intervals by the others. The {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} qualifying event had to be completed in under three hours to be eligible to start the main event, the {{convert|126|km|mi|abbr=on}} race from Paris to Rouen; 21 were selected for the main event.&lt;ref name="8W"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Quali"&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k613222b Gallica, Online Archive, ''Le Petit Journal'' 18 July 1894 – Selection around Paris]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CC Org"&gt;[http://www.cc-organisation.com/CC-Organisation.com/Course_Paris_-_Rouen.html CC Organisation – Course Paris-Rouen]&lt;/ref&gt;

Qualifying was used as a major publicity tool for both the event and the newspaper ''for our readers who want to see the cars on the roads around Paris''. The 22 vehicles were split into five groups who completed complex interwoven tours of Paris and its environs, including [[Mantes-la-Jolie]], [[Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], [[Flins-sur-Seine]], [[Poissy]], [[Triel-sur-Seine]], [[Rambouillet]], [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]], [[Dampierre-en-Yvelines]], [[Corbeil-Essonnes]], [[Palaiseau]], [[Précy-sur-Oise]], [[Gennevilliers]] and [[L'Isle-Adam, Val-d'Oise]]. The groups were carefully balanced to ensure each included petrol and steam, a Peugeot, a Panhard &amp; Levassor, and different seating. ''Le Petit Journal'', on the morning of the event, still officially expected Lemoigne and his gravity-powered vehicle to participate, although he was included as an additional member of group five.&lt;ref name="Quali"/&gt;

The '''Patriotic Nigras''' (also known by the initialism '''PN''') are a group of [[griefer]]s in the online world of ''[[Second Life]]''.&lt;ref name="GLS"&gt;{{cite conference | first = Julian | last = Dibbell | authorlink = Julian Dibbell | title = Sympathy for the Griefer:MOOrape, Lulz cubes, and Other Lessons from the First 2 Decades of Online Sociopathy | publisher = [http://www.glsconference.org/2008/index.html Games, Learning and Society 4.0] | date = 2008-07-11 | location = [[Madison, Wisconsin]] | url = http://hosted.mediasite.com/hosted4/Viewer/?peid=9d1cf257-52ff-4704-9cb5-37de2ecca35b | accessdate = 2008-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the PN are known mainly for the disruption of ''Second Life'' and its users, they have also established themselves on the [[video sharing]] website [[YouTube]], where they have posted videos of their activities including server raids. Their method of attack ranges from [[trolling]] a group or individual to the manipulation of the in-game scripting engine, where they perform such activities as showering their targets with boxes covered in [[internet meme]]s and [[shock images]]. These boxes then produce storms of graphical [[Particle system|particles]] that block the victim's vision. They have also created avatars similar to those of the residents being harassed and destroyed them in gruesome ways to simulate a virtual death.&lt;ref name="new sci"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Giles | first1 = Jim | authorlink = Jim Giles (reporter) | year = 2007 | title = Serious Grief | url = | journal = [[New Scientist]] | volume = 9 | issue = 1-7| pages = 52–53 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Patriotic Nigras have also caused the crashing of several ''Second Life'' regions (or "simulators") by using [[self-replicating]] objects that overload the processing power of the computer running them.&lt;ref name="GLS" /&gt;&lt;ref name=dibbell&gt;Dibbell, Julian.

Properly characterizing the Patriotic Nigras has proven difficult for critics and researchers who have observed their activities from within their raids and from afar. The group has been described as a nonpolitical online terrorist group whose central motivation is described by the term "[[lulz]]".&lt;ref name=backe&gt;Bäcke, Maria.

Whatever the true character and affiliations of the group, it has provoked commentary by critics and internet culture writers since its formation in 2005, and it has been listed as one of the central figures in the [[griefer]] culture of Second Life.&lt;ref name=arthur&gt;Arthur, Charles.

==History==

===Habbo Hotel===
[[File:Anti-furry protesters near AC 2007.jpg|thumb|Anti-[[Furry fandom|furry]] protesters at [[Anthrocon|Anthrocon 2007]] wear afro wigs and Armani suits, and carry a sign saying "Pool is Closed" in reference to Patriotic Nigras raids on Habbo Hotel.]]

{{main|Habbo#Habbo_raids}}
The origin of the Patriotic Nigras has been traced by cyber-rights researcher [[Peter Ludlow]] to the [[4chan#/b/|/b/ imageboard]] of the website [[4chan]] where board members decided in late 2005 to [[Habbo#Habbo raids|"raid" Habbo Hotel]], a popular avatar-based [[social networking]] game. The raid took the form of numerous [[African-American|black]] men presenting avatars with outsize [[afro]]s and [[Armani]] suits&lt;ref name=webber/&gt; blocking access to the virtual pool and telling other users that "[[Pool's closed due to AIDS|the pool is closed because of AIDS]]." From this raid, according to Ludlow, emerged the Patriotic Nigras and their [[Internet meme]] slogan "[[Pool's closed|Pool's Closed]]."&lt;ref name=jenkins&gt;[[Peter Ludlow|Ludlow, Peter]]. ''[http://henryjenkins.org/2010/04/watching_the_watchers_power_an.html Watching the Watchers: Power and Politics in Second Life (Part One)]''. [[Henry Jenkins|Henryjenkins.org]]. 9 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of the first raid has led the Patriotic Nigras to perform raids on the [[Habbo Hotel]] during subsequent years. The 2006 anniversary raid was organized at the /i/ imageboard of the website [[7chan]].&lt;ref name=vichot/&gt; The format of these raids is always the same with the use of avatars that look like black men with afros, and with the group sometimes attempting to offend users by forming images with the avatars such as [[swastika]]s.&lt;ref name=vichot/&gt;

===Second Life===
The Second Life phase of the group's activities began in early 2006 when an anonymous user known as "[[Mudkip]]s Acronym"&lt;ref name=fink/&gt; reposted on 4chan a question originally posed at [[eBaum's World]] regarding whether or not Second Life "was raidable." There were 143 Patriotic Nigras members as of September 2007, of which around 35–60 were active.&lt;ref name="new sci" /&gt; The response to "Mudkips Acronym"'s challenge was rapid and the group soon established itself as a fixture on Second Life. As of 2008, the Patriotic Nigras were said to operate hundreds, if not thousands, of Second Life accounts.&lt;ref&gt;Girard, Nicole. [http://www.macnewsworld.com/story/social-networking/59401.html "Griefer Madness: Terrorizing Virtual Worlds"]. ''MacNews''. Accessed August 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

By mid-2006, a number of Second Life users had had enough of the PN's antics and a Second Life member named "Kalel Venkman" formed a counter-griefer vigilante group named the Justice League Unlimited. With avatars donning the skins of superheroes like [[Superman]] and [[Wonder Woman]], the Justice League Unlimited established monitors in many areas of [[Second Life]] and zealously reported any untoward behavior to the Linden Lab administrators. The zeal with which they executed their duties, however, proved to be problematic and they were soon banned from areas such as [[FurNation]] for excessive vigilantism. According to cyber-rights researcher, Peter Ludlow, the Justice League Unlimited's anti-PN efforts also became problematic as the close association between 4chan users and Patriotic Nigras led to the unwarranted harassment of many users who were 4channers only and not members of the PN.&lt;ref name=jenkins/&gt;

In February 2007, the group gained media coverage after an attack on the Second Life headquarters of politician [[John Edwards]] in which the Patriotic Nigras attacked with their avatars bearing "[[George W. Bush|Bush]] 08" buttons and defaced Edwards's structure with [[feces]], [[Marxist]]/[[Leninist]] posters, and obscenity.&lt;ref&gt;Fulco, Ivan.

The room was invaded by flying [[penis|penises]].&lt;ref&gt;Giles, Jim.

Pp.28–29. 1 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This incident was also attributed to the "Room 101" group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Pink penis attack on Second Life chat show |date=2006-12-22 |work=[[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]] |url= http://www.metro.co.uk/news/article.html?in_article_id=30420&amp;in_page_id=34 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Room 101 vs. Anshe Chung.

[[File:Shoopedlife.png|thumb|Titlescreen of the ShoopedLife client]]
The Patriotic Nigras were at first tolerated by the producers of Second Life, Linden Lab, but after the John Edwards attack they began to crack down and now take efforts to find and ban griefers on sight. To fight back, the Patriotic Nigras found ways to bypass the bans Linden Lab typically employs.&lt;ref name="new sci" /&gt; New Media critics have described the Patriotic Nigras' antagonistic relationship with Linden Lab as arising in reaction to the company's player-monitoring policies (described as part of a broadly [[Michel Foucault|Foucaultian]] institutionalized control apparatus).&lt;ref name=backe2&gt;Bäcke, Maria and Francisco J. Ricardo, ed. "Self, Setting, and Situation in Second Life." ''Literary Art in Digital Performance: Case Studies in New Media Art and Criticism''. [[Continuum International Publishing Group]]. Pp.111, 133. 2009. {{ISBN|9780826436801}}&lt;/ref&gt; To further their aims on Second Life, the PN developed a modified Second Life client called ShoopedLife that allowed them to bypass many of the hardware-banning methods typically used by [[Linden Lab]] to prevent persistent griefers from accessing Second Life. Reacting against this, the Justice League Unlimited formed close associations with Linden Lab administrators, going so far as to monitor when administrators were available for contact so that griefing could be rapidly halted.&lt;ref name=jenkins/&gt;

As Patriotic Nigras countermeasures intensified the situation, Justice League Unlimited suspicions concerning Patriotic Nigras connections to 4chan deepened and Second Life players received bans for nothing more than their association with 4chan. This finally culminated in the closing of [[Woodbury University]]'s [[Woodbury University#Woodbury University in Second Life|virtual campus]], and led thereafter to an escalation of factional maneuvers between the Woodbury group and the Justice League Unlimited&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bakioglu|first1=Burcu|title=Governance in Virtual Worlds: Grief Play, Hacktivism &amp; LeakOps in Second Life|ssrn=2179886|accessdate=2014-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; who characterized all opponents as PN sympathizers.&lt;ref name=jenkins/&gt; In a series of multi-directional infiltrations, personal information including the [[Real life#Distinct from internet|real life]] names of "Kalel Venkman," several Woodbury group members, writers for [[The Alphaville Herald]], and Patriotic Nigras leader "Mudkips Acronym" was published online. In August 2007, "Mudkips Acronym" resigned in fear that this information would be used to compromise his security,&lt;ref name="new sci" /&gt; and by mid-2008, the Justice League Unlimited had been disbanded following embarrassing revelations of the nature of their relationship with Linden Lab and their efforts to "[[Doxing|dox]]" Second Lifers suspected of connections to the PNs through the collection of extensive dossier-style information.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Ludlow|Ludlow, Peter]]. ''[http://henryjenkins.org/2010/04/watching_the_watchers_power_an_1.html Watching the Watchers: Power and Politics in Second Life (Part Two)]''.

Beginning in 2002, and continuing after the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], large-scale '''protests against the Iraq War''' were held in many cities worldwide, often coordinated to occur simultaneously around the world.  After the biggest [[February 15, 2003 anti-war protest|series of demonstrations, on February 15, 2003]], ''[[New York Times]]'' writer [[Patrick Tyler]] claimed that they showed that there were [[Second Superpower|two superpowers]] on the planet: the United States and worldwide [[public opinion]].&lt;ref name="Tyler"&gt;{{cite news

These demonstrations against the war were mainly organized by [[List of anti-war organizations|anti-war organizations]], many of whom had been formed in [[Protests against the invasion of Afghanistan|opposition to the invasion of Afghanistan]]. In some [[Arab]] countries demonstrations were organized by the [[Sovereign state|state]]. Europe saw the biggest mobilization of protesters, including a rally of three million people in Rome, which is listed in the [[Guinness Book of Records]] as the largest ever anti-war rally.&lt;ref name="Guinness"&gt;{{cite web

According to the [[France|French]] academic [[Dominique Reynié]], between January 3 and April 12, 2003, 36 million people across the globe took part in almost 3,000 protests against the Iraq war.&lt;ref name="Socialist Worker J3 to A12"/&gt;

In the United States, even though pro-war demonstrators have been quoted as referring to anti-war protests as a "vocal minority",&lt;ref name="vocal minority"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/15/AR2007091500826.html Dueling Demonstrations As Thousands March to Capitol to Protest Iraq Conflict, 189 Arrested; War Supporters Take on 'Vocal Minority'] Michelle Boorstein, V.

Retrieved August 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scope and impact in the United States ==

A March 2003 Gallup poll conducted during the first few days of the war showed that 5% of the population had protested or made a public opposition against the war compared to 21% who attended a rally or made a public display to support the war.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070213210656/http://www.aei.org/docLib/200701121_roody2.pdf Public Opinion and the war in Iraq] P. 177&lt;/ref&gt;  An ABC news poll showed that 2% had attended an anti-war protest and 1% attended a pro-war rally. The protests made 20% more opposed to the war and 7% more supportive.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070213210656/http://www.aei.org/docLib/200701121_roody2.pdf Public Opinion and the war in Iraq] P. 178&lt;/ref&gt;  A Fox News poll showed that 63% had an unfavorable view of the protesters, just 23% had a favorable view.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;  According to Pew Research, 40% said in March 2003 that they had heard "too much" from people opposed to the war against 17% who said "too little".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070213210656/http://www.aei.org/docLib/200701121_roody2.pdf Public Opinion and the war in Iraq] P. 179&lt;/ref&gt;

Some observers have noted that the protests against the Iraq War have been relatively small-scale and infrequent compared to [[protests against the Vietnam War]]. One of the most often cited factors for this is the lack of [[conscription]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/31/opinion/31observer.html?scp=4&amp;sq=protesters&amp;st=nyt Op-ed]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines07/0321-03.htm |title=AP article |publisher=Commondreams.org |date=2007-03-21 |accessdate=2013-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218184019/http://www.commondreams.org/headlines07/0321-03.htm |archivedate=2013-02-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prior to the invasion of Iraq ==
These protests are said to be the biggest global peace protests before a war actually started; the [[peace movement]] is compared with the movement caused by the [[Vietnam War]].

=== September 2002 ===
On September 12, 2002, U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] spoke to the [[United Nations General Assembly]]. Outside the United Nations building, over 1,000 people attended a protest organized by Voter March and No Blood for Oil.

On September 24, [[Tony Blair]] released a document describing Britain's case for war in Iraq. Three days later, an anti-war rally in London drew a crowd of at least 150,000.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_politics/2285861.stm&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 29, roughly 5,000 anti-war protesters converged on Washington, D.C. on the day after an anti-[[International Monetary Fund]] protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dc.indymedia.org/front.php3?article_id=33026&amp;group=webcast |title=Indymedia DC |accessdate=2017-03-30 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021117173500/http://dc.indymedia.org/front.php3?article_id=33026&amp;group=webcast |archivedate=November 17, 2002 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== October 2002 ===
On October 2, the day President Bush signed into law Congress' joint resolution authorizing the war,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/10/20021002-7.html |title=President, House Leadership Agree on Iraq Resolution |publisher=Georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov |date=2002-10-02 |accessdate=2009-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; a small-scale protest was held in Chicago, attended by a crowd of roughly 1,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swamppolitics.com/news/politics/blog/2008/03/obamas_big_2002_antiwar_speech.html |title=Obama's 'big' 2002 anti-war speech wasn't big then |publisher=Swamppolitics.com |date=2008-03-25 |accessdate=2009-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; who listened to speeches by Jesse Jackson and then-Illinois State Senator [[Barack Obama]]. Obama's statement, "I am not opposed to all wars. I'm opposed to dumb wars," was barely noted at the time, but became famous during the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008|2008 Democratic presidential primaries]] when the Obama camp used it to demonstrate his courage and good judgment on the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gonyea |first=Don |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=88988093 |title=NPR story |publisher=Npr.org |date= |accessdate=2009-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 7, Bush delivered a major speech justifying the invasion of Iraq at the [[Cincinnati Museum Center at Union Terminal]].  Outside, approximately 3000 people gathered to protest the coming war.  Later, a few hundred protesters blocking the Museum Center exits were dispersed by mounted police, and six people were arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nuclearresister.org/nr131/131bushprotesters.html |title=The Nuclear Resister, November 4, 2002 |publisher=Nuclearresister.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 26, protests took place in various cities across the world. Over 100,000 people took part in a protest in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]. 50,000 people took part in a demonstration in San Francisco. Both protests were called by the [[ANSWER Coalition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Profile: Protests Against A Possible War In Iraq Taking Place Around The Country|url=https://www.npr.org/programs/atc/transcripts/2002/oct/021026.brand.html|website=npr.org|accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 31, [[Halloween 2002 anti-war protest|around 150 protests]] took place across the United Kingdom, including [[Critical Mass (cycling)|Critical Mass]] bike rides, occupations, and mass demonstrations in [[Brighton]], [[Manchester]], Glasgow and London. Protests also took place in the US.&lt;ref name="Halloween Protest"&gt;{{cite web

=== November 2002 ===
On November 9, demonstrations were held against the war at the end of the first [[European Social Forum]] in Florence, Italy.  According to the organizers, 1,000,000 people were in attendance.  Local authorities put attendance at 500,000.&lt;ref&gt;

On Saturday, November 16, in Canada an anti-war demonstration of about 2,000 people occurred at [[Queen's Park (Toronto)|Queen's Park]] in Toronto.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2002"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2002/11/16/protest_021116.html |title=Canadian activists stage anti-war rallies |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=2002-11-17 |accessdate=2009-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2002/11/17/protests_021117.html |title=Protesters brave cold to condemn war against Iraq |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=2002-11-18 |accessdate=2009-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rabble1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rebick |first=Judy |url=http://www.rabble.ca/news/war-stories |title=War Stories |publisher=rabble.ca |date=2002-11-11 |accessdate=2009-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="canadiansagainstwar1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canadiansagainstwar.org/links/38-peace-groups-in-canada |title=Peace Groups in Canada |publisher=Canadiansagainstwar.org |date=2002-11-17 |accessdate=2009-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725134311/http://www.canadiansagainstwar.org/links/38-peace-groups-in-canada |archivedate=2011-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 17, a large anti-war coalition held a peace march in Vancouver marching from Peace Flame Park as part of a Cross-Canada Day of Action. In [[Vancouver]], about 3,000 people gathered in the rain. Washington must take any complaints against foreign governments to the United Nations, they said. Many accused the White House of targeting Saddam Hussein in order to try to take control of valuable oil reserves.
About 1,000 marched through a shower of ice pellets in Montreal, and about 500 showed up in a blur of white snow on Parliament Hill. Rallies were held in several other cities, including [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], [[Winnipeg]] and [[Edmonton]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rabble1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="canadiansagainstwar1"/&gt;

===January 2003===
On January 16, 2003, protests were held worldwide in opposition to a war with Iraq, including in Turkey, Egypt, Pakistan, Japan, Belgium, the Netherlands, Argentina, and the United States, where Americans attended a rally in Washington, D.C. The [[United States Park Police|U.S. Park Police]], which oversees activities on the [[National Mall]], stopped providing estimates of crowd size after being threatened with lawsuits by the organizers of the [[Million Man March]], but said that protest organizers only had a permit for 30,000 demonstrators.

[[Image:ProtestJan18DC.jpeg|thumb|January 18 peace protest in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
On January 18, anti-war demonstrations, focusing particularly but not exclusively on the expected war with Iraq, took place in villages, towns, and cities around the world, including Tokyo, Moscow, Paris, London, Dublin, Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Cologne, Bonn, [[Gothenburg]], Florence, Oslo, Rotterdam, Istanbul and Cairo. In New Zealand, thousands rallied in [[Dunedin]] and [[Christchurch]], while in [[Auckland]] protesters rallied at the Devonport naval base on January 28, opposing the deployment of the frigate [[HMNZS Te Mana]] to the Gulf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rising NZ opposition to war |url=http://www.socialistworkerarchive.net.nz/~server/Socialist_Worker_NZ_Archive/Socialist_Worker_Monthly_Review_(2003)_files/SWMR%20%234.pdf |date=February 2003 |work=Socialist Worker Monthly Review |accessdate=4 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}{{dead link|date=September 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Not in Our Name|NION]] and [[Act Now to Stop War and End Racism|ANSWER]] jointly organized protests in Washington, D.C. and San Francisco. Other protests took place all over the United States, including various smaller places such as [[Lincoln, Nebraska]].

Upwards of 50,000 people demonstrated in San Francisco. The day started with a waterfront rally at 11 am, followed by a march down [[Market Street (San Francisco, California)|Market Street]] to the civic center.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Huge-protests-for-peace-Tens-of-thousands-in-2678876.php#item-44548, http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Peaceful-S-F-crowd-protests-stance-on-Iraq-At-2633972.php&lt;/ref&gt;

In Seattle, a surprise turnout on a sunny Saturday saw over 45,000 people (Organizer and observers reports)  march from the Seattle Center (after several speeches) to King Street Station-the local media all came up with nonsensical crowd numbers, from 200 up to 1,500 people. People were still vacating the starting point at the Seattle Center while the front of the march was piling up at King Street Station, the terminal point of the march; Over 5 miles of solid people-as was evidenced by one aerial photo courtesy KING-TV, showed the true scope of the march. Most of the media downplayed the numbers by taking photos at the front of the parade, on flat ground-which usually showed just a few hundred people. For some reason there was no speaker awaiting to what would have been a crowd of possibly 50,000 people-it simply ended...casual shoppers and walkers joining the crowd-the largest march of any kind in Seattle's history at the time (surpassed by the [[Women's March in Seattle]] in 2017).

In Washington, "at least tens of thousands",&lt;ref name="CNN J18"&gt;{{cite news

On February 15, millions of people protested, in approximately 800 cities around the world. Listed by the 2004 ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'' as the largest protest in human history, protests occurred among others in the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, Germany, Switzerland, Republic of Ireland, the United States, Canada, Australia, South Africa, Syria, India, Russia, South Korea, Japan, and even [[McMurdo Station]] in [[Antarctica]]. Perhaps the largest demonstration this day occurred in London, with up to one million protestors gathering in Hyde Park; speakers included the Reverend Jesse Jackson, London mayor [[Ken Livingstone]], and Liberal Democrat leader [[Charles Kennedy]].&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1422289/Protest-has-rattled-Number-10-say-march-organisers.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first1=Sandra | last1=Laville | first2=Barbie | last2=Dutter | title=Protest has rattled Number 10, say march organisers | date=February 17, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2767761.stm | work=BBC News | title=Anti-war rally makes its mark | date=February 19, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large demonstration, also attended by perhaps around a million, took place in Barcelona.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt;

On March 8, three separate marches converged on [[Manchester Town Hall]], UK. Official estimates put the number of participants at 10,000 (although this was disputed by organisers), making it the biggest political demonstration in the city since the [[Peterloo Massacre]] in 1819.&lt;ref name="M8"&gt;{{cite news

On March 15, Spanish and Italian cities showed some of the largest turnouts against their governments' pro-war stance, with more than 400,000 protesters in Milan, more than 300,000 in Barcelona forming a mile-long human chain,&lt;ref name="M15 Barcelona"&gt;{{cite news|title=Centenares de miles de manifestantes contra la guerra de Irak |url=http://es.news.yahoo.com/030315/159/2lx9c.html |publisher=[[Yahoo!]] News |date=March 15, 2003 |accessdate=2007-01-11 |language=Spanish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040412011709/http://es.news.yahoo.com/030315/159/2lx9c.html |archivedate=April 12, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and more than 120,000 in [[Madrid]].&lt;ref name="M15 Madrid"&gt;{{cite web

Many of the protests were said to be smaller than those in the same cities a month ago; exceptions were Montreal, which upped its turnout to 200,000 and Dublin where 130,000 demonstrated. The Montreal turnout may have been related to solidarity against American [[anti-French sentiment]], which was a common theme for many of the protesters.&lt;ref name="M15 Montreal"&gt;{{cite news

On March 19, across the United Kingdom tens of thousands of school students staged walkouts.

In Birmingham 4,000 (BBC estimate) striking school students held a demonstration which ended at [[Victoria Square, Birmingham|Victoria Square]]. Though there were some reports of some students throwing coins, West Midlands police said that the protests were "buoyant rather than boisterous" and no arrests were made.  The demonstration later moved on to Cannon Hill Park. The son of [[Philip Hunt, Baron Hunt of Kings Heath|Lord Hunt]], a junior health Minister who quit his job over the march, was amongst the students in attendance.&lt;ref name="M19 1"&gt;{{cite news

In Manchester, 300 (eye-witness Stop the War estimate){{citation needed|date=March 2012}} secondary school children, Further Education students and university students met at Albert Square at 12 noon. They marched to the BBC studios where they sat down in the road at around 1pm and blocked the traffic for over an hour where their numbers grew to around 1000 demonstrators. They were filmed by anti-war activists and video clips were distributed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fjt7lHCICkw |title=YouTube videos of Manchester demonstration |publisher=Youtube.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The students then marched around the city centre and ended up back at Albert Square at about 4pm where they remained demonstrating in front of the Town Hall for some hours.

In Germany, students staged a massive walkout. In London, a massive demonstration was held in front of the [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]].

=== March 21, 2003 ===
Demonstrations were organized for a second day in a row in various US cities including Seattle, Portland, Oregon, Chicago, Atlanta, Georgia, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. In the last two cities, demonstrators closed parts of the city to traffic.

There were protests in Washington, D.C.. In Chicago, protesters disrupted traffic by closing down [[Lake Shore Drive]]. [[CNN]] reported that a march of over a thousand protesters in Atlanta, Georgia passed by their headquarters, upset over that network's coverage of the war. Canada likewise experienced numerous anti-war protests over the weekend. Crowds of anti-war demonstrators took to the streets of Montreal and Toronto. [[Calgary]] held three days of protests (20 March – 22nd), culminating in a march which surrounded the government building and American consulate. In the Italian city of Naples 10,000 anti-war protesters marched towards a [[NATO]] base in Bagnoli.

Media reports state at least 20,000 school pupils protesting in Hamburg, Germany. After the protest march, conflicts between police and protesters broke out in front of a US building in Hamburg. Protesters who were pushed back by the police began to throw stones, who in turn reacted with [[water cannon]]s. There have since been serious discussions about [[police abuses]] in Hamburg, and political ramifications may follow.  In the afternoon, 50,000 people protested peacefully in Leipzig following traditional prayers for peace in the city's Nikolai Church. Prayers for peace and subsequent large demonstrations at that church every Monday ('Montagsdemos') helped bring down the [[German Democratic Republic|GDR]] government in East Germany in 1989. The weekly demonstrations, supported by churches, trade unions and other civic organizations, began again in January 2003 in protest to the impending invasion of Iraq. Protest marches in the afternoon were also reported in the German cities of Berlin and [[Freiburg]]. In Rome, Milan, Turin and other Italian cities, thousands of pupils and schoolteachers stayed away from school to protest against the Iraq war. The teachers union reported that 60 percent of all schools were closed. The strike had been planned weeks ago as a signal against a school reform bill, but was converted to an anti-war protest. 400 anti-war protesters tried to enter the Australian parliament in Canberra to speak to the prime minister, but were stopped by police. In the Indian state of [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Maoism|Maoist]] protesters attacked shops selling [[Coca-Cola]] and US soft drinks. Protests in front of US buildings and in fast food shops were also held in Indonesia. In Egypt, 12,000 students of two universities in Cairo protested as well as 3,000 people in the Thai capital Bangkok. In Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 150 people threw stones at the United States consulate.

=== March 25, 2003 ===
Some people demonstrated in Syria against the United States, United Kingdom and Israel. This protest was endorsed by the Syrian government. In the [[Islam]]ic country of [[Bangladesh]], 60,000 people demonstrated. Media also reports protests in front of the South Korean parliament building, linked to plans to bring South Korean forces into the war.

=== March 27, 2003 ===
Hundreds of protesters participated in a [[civil disobedience]] in New York City. In a "die-in" organized by the M27 Coalition (an ad-hoc group of various anti-war organizations and individuals), 215 people were arrested after blocking traffic on 5th Avenue near the [[Rockefeller Center]], protesting the cooperation between U.S. media and the government.  Protesters also blocked traffic at various sites around the city in a coordinated protest with the theme of "No Business As Usual." Protests also took place across the UK. About 250 students (Police estimate) marched on the US embassy in central London. 200 people (South Wales Police estimate) brought [[Cardiff]] city centre traffic to a standstill leading to at least six arrests. There was a lunchtime anti-war demonstration on the Humber bridge in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] which involved some friction between motorists and protesters. In [[Derry]], up to a dozen anti-war protesters stormed the [[Raytheon]] defense technologies company building staging a sit-in until removed by police. Thousands joined a protest in [[Manchester]].&lt;ref name="M27 New York City"&gt;{{cite news

In Bogotá, Colombia there were violent conflicts in front of the US consulate. Protest marches and demonstrations happened also in Algiers, Algeria and in [[Bahrain]], the [[Palestinian territories]], South Korea, Indonesia and Pakistan. In Australia the police prevented protest marches. In Germany, protests by schoolchildren continued. In New Delhi and elsewhere in India, over 20,000 protested against the war.

{{Main|2003 Port of Oakland dock protest}}
In Oakland, California, police fired [[rubber bullet]]s and [[flexible baton round|beanbags]] at protesters and dockworkers outside the port, injuring at least a dozen demonstrators and six longshoremen standing nearby. Protestors were protesting the Iraq War related action performed by [[American President Lines]] and defense contractor [[Stevedoring Services of America]]. Most of the 500 demonstrators were dispersed peacefully, but a crowd of demonstrators was blocking traffic on private property near the port and failed to disperse after police warnings. The Oakland Police Chief said demonstrators also threw objects and bolts at the police, and said the use of weapons was necessary to disperse the crowd. He indicated that the rubber bullets were used to respond to direct illegal action and the longshoremen were caught in the crossfire. A dockworker spokesman reported that police gave two minutes to disperse, then opened fire rather than making arrests. Demonstrators also claim that the police took direct aim at them, rather than firing in the air or at the ground. Thirty-one people were arrested. Demonstrators regrouped and marched to the Oakland Federal Building. In New York, United States, protesters targeted the [[Carlyle Group]], an investment firm with deep connections to the war. About 20 protesters were arrested in a planned civil disobedience, but police then also surrounded and arrested close to 100 people who were simply watching the protest from across the street.&lt;ref name="A7 PeaceWatch"&gt;{{cite web

Following the period of combat in March–April 2003, both protests and armed combat experienced a temporary decline in intensity. Protests against the war as a whole continued, often on the occasion of anniversaries of the war and visits by members of the Bush administration to foreign cities. Within the United States, general anti-war protests were joined by protests focusing on particular issues or strategies including: opposition to torture and abuse (such as that in the [[Abu Ghraib prison]]), calls for withdrawal of members of the [[Coalition of the willing|coalition from Iraq]], [[counter-recruitment]], support for military resisters such as Lt. [[Ehren Watada]], and opposition to military and corporate contractors. The largest protests during this period have been national, multi-issue mobilizations such as those on August 30, 2004, and April 29, 2006. [[Black bloc]] elements were present during some of the protests.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/7563356@N08/3377938160/ https://www.flickr.com] Image of black bloc members during Iraq War Protest in Washington, D.C., March 21, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

A small number of protests occurred in the wake of the Wednesday night speech, including one in Boston which resulted in 6 arrests for blocking traffic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2007/01/14/6_arrested_in_antiwar_protest/ 6 arrested in antiwar protest], ''Boston Globe'', January 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Organizers from [[MoveOn.org]] and TrueMajority.org each received reports of some 500–600 protests that were held nationwide on January 11.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democracyinaction.org/dia/organizationsORG/truemajority/event/distributedEventSearch.jsp?distributed_event_KEY=242&amp;zip=33604&amp;miles=800 TrueMajority] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070323153820/http://www.democracyinaction.org/dia/organizationsORG/truemajority/event/distributedEventSearch.jsp?distributed_event_KEY=242&amp;zip=33604&amp;miles=800 |date=2007-03-23 }} ("600 posted events").

A march took place from the White House to the Capitol on September 15, 2007. It was organized by Veterans for Peace and the Answer Coalition. Volunteers were recruited for a civil disobedience action, which included a [[die-in]]. Volunteers signed up to take on the name of a soldier or civilian who died because of the war, and lay down around the Peace Monument.&lt;ref name="pephost"&gt;[http://www.pephost.org/site/PageServer?pagename=S15_homepage Three days until the Sept. 15 March to Stop the War!] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911181342/http://www.pephost.org/site/PageServer?pagename=S15_homepage |date=September 11, 2007 }} pephost.org.

Thousands of anti-war protesters marched through Washington, D.C. on the fifth anniversary of the U.S.-led [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], some splattering red paint on government offices and scuffling with police. Protesters, including many veterans, demanded the arrests of President George W. Bush, Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] and Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]] as war criminals. Others hurled balloons full of paint at a military recruiting station and smeared it on buildings housing defense contractors [[Bechtel]] and [[Lockheed Martin]].&lt;ref name="cnn19mar08"&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/03/19/anti.war.protests/index.html Protesters march on Iraq anniversary].

Several other protests took place during the days leading up to the five-year anniversary of the Iraq War. On March 7, in [[Washington, D.C.]] for example, several churches held services to pray for the safety of U.S. troops and an end to the war.  In the afternoon the churchgoers marched to the [[Hart Senate Office Building]] with the intention of asking U.S. Senators to discontinue U.S.-funded terrorism.  At least forty of the protesters were arrested as they entered the building and began praying for peace.&lt;ref name="Paceebene"/&gt;

Thousands of protesters marched from the Mall in Washington D.C. to the grounds of the Pentagon, and then to the Crystal City district of Arlington, Virginia.  This area of Arlington is the home to offices of several defense contractors, such as [[KBR (company)|KBR]] and [[General Dynamics]].  Protesters carried mock coffins representing the victims of U.S. conflicts and placed them in front of the office buildings.

== History ==

Singing and consuming alcohol have been practised together from ancient times,{{when|date=September 2018}} but the written evidence is fragmentary until the 16th century. In [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s [[Henry IV, Part 1|''Henry IV'']], Hal and [[Falstaff]] discuss drinking and playing the "tongs and the bones". There are depictions of pub singing in paintings by Teniers (1610–1690) Brouwer (1605/6-1638) and [[Jan Steen]] (1625/5-1656).

=== 1800 to 1950 ===

The 1830 Beer Act abolished the levy on beer and within a single year 400 new pubs opened and within 8 years there were 46,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.oldcannonbrewery.co.uk/5.html |title=History |date=2007-01-10 |access-date=2018-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070110215128/http://www.oldcannonbrewery.co.uk/5.html |archivedate=10 January 2007 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number peaked in the 1870s and declined after 1900. By the 1850s, an increasing number of student songs and commercial song-books were published across Europe. The most famous was the ''Scottish Students' Song Book'' by [[John Stuart Blackie]] (1809–1895).  The mixture of traditional songs with hints of erotic humour continues to this day.  The Irish tradition also benefited from the compilation of O'Neill's ''Music of Ireland'', a compilation of 1,850 pieces of Irish session and dance music, published initially by [[Francis O'Neill]] (1848–1936) in 1903.

One of the most popular drinking songs, "[[Little Brown Jug (song)|Little Brown Jug]]," dates from the 1860s. By 1908 [[Percy Grainger]] had begun to record folk singers, but not in their natural habitat—the pub. In 1938 [[A.L. Lloyd]] persuaded his employers at the [[BBC]] to record the singers in the Eel's Foot pub in Eastbridge, [[Suffolk]].

At The Eel's Foot, 1939–47, the songs performed included: "False Hearted Knight", "The Dark-Eyed Sailor", "The Princess Royal", "The [[Foggy Dew (English song)|Foggy Dew]]", "Underneath Her Apron", "Pleasant and Delightful", "The Blackbird." Surprisingly, one of the songs was "Poor Man's Heaven" an American IWW song ([[Industrial Workers of the World]]), dating from about 1920. The oldest singer there was William "Velvet" Brightwell (1865–1960). In 1947 the BBC made more recordings there and broadcast them as "Anglia Sings" on 19 November 1947. Almost all of the participants were in their 50s and 60s. Six years later the first folk club opened in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], and the average age was in the 20s.

== Instruments ==
[[File:Nash-session.jpg|thumb|Various instruments being played at a pub session]]

The [[fiddle]] has predominated since the 17th century. The [[Diatonic button accordion#Melodeon|melodeon]] became popular in the 1890s. By the 1950s the [[accordion]] took over, particularly in Scotland. By the 1960s the [[guitar]] was the instrument most frequently heard in a pub. Nowadays so many people can afford instruments that ensemble playing is the norm. [[Celtic music|Celtic]] tunes are popular, even in England, however English music is enjoying a large revival currently, due in part to 'new-folk' artists playing traditional English music, such as Bellowhead and Eliza Carthy. Some people go to folk festivals simply in order to play along with others in the beer tent.

=== Choosing an instrument ===

Each session has its own informal rules as to which instruments are acceptable and in what number. Some sessions may have a strict "'traditional' instruments only" rule whereas others will accept anyone who shows up to play with any instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/marjorie-freimuth/an-outsiders-guide-to-a-d_b_9556002.html |title=An Outsider's Guide to a Dublin Pub Session |last=Freimuth |first=Marjorie |date=2016-04-18 |website=Huffington Post |language=en-US |access-date=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''traditional'' is used loosely as sessions themselves are a relatively recently revived phenomenon and some instruments considered 'traditional,' such as the [[bouzouki]] are in fact relatively new to the genres played at a session. It is wise to ask about what is expected at a particular session before bringing a non-'traditional' instrument.

Generally there can be an unlimited number of [[fiddle]]s, [[flute]]s, [[accordion]]s and [[tin whistle]]s. The [[bodhrán]] is common in Irish sessions, but many sessions prefer that only one person play the bodhrán at a time. [[Uilleann pipes]] are common in Irish sessions, but the more commonly known [[Great Highland Bagpipe]]s are never used in a session, because they drown out other instruments. [[Mandolin]]s, [[banjo]]s, [[cittern]]s and [[bouzouki]]s are welcome in moderation. [[Guitar]]s and [[Appalachian dulcimer|dulcimers]] are frequently allowed in sessions without strict "'traditional' instruments only" rules.

== Etiquette ==
There are "open sessions", when anyone who wishes can play, and "closed sessions", where the playing is restricted to a group. The general rules are fairly simple, but depend on the kind of session. In general, pub sessions are not places for learning an instrument. It is expected that those taking part have attained competence in playing their instrument. Some sessions are wholly instrumental while others will engage the crowd with singing. It is customary to introduce oneself to the other participants before joining in. There will usually be a leader or oldest member who sets the tone and keeps the session running smoothly; often leader(s) do not appear to be leaders at all.  Occasionally, even the leaders of a session may not realize that they lead.

Practically, however, there are always leaders at a session, by the nature of human dynamics.  Some sessions follow a round-robin structure, others have a more free-for-all approach, and the leader(s) of a session should be observed to see how this particular session is run.  Due to freeform nature of the session, there is always an element of serendipity and there is an atmosphere of anticipation and an expectation of tolerance from all present.

It is frowned upon when one openly criticises people who know only one song or only a few tunes.  Sessions are occasions to be enjoyed by all participants and if others are accepted members of the group, it's not up to one person (other than the leaders of the session) to decide that they are not welcome.

== Legal considerations ==
In England and Wales the [[Licensing Act 2003]] came into force in 2005. It could be interpreted as meaning that any performer would be obliged to give prior notification to police, fire brigade and environmental health. Following much lobbying by various groups, the law settled down to allow "spontaneous" events and religious events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.randomdestination.co.uk/ChippenhamMorris/license.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515224528/http://www.randomdestination.co.uk/ChippenhamMorris/license.htm |archivedate=15 May 2006 |df=dmy-all}} License&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Respiratory failure''' results from inadequate [[gas exchange]] by the [[respiratory system]], meaning that the arterial oxygen, carbon dioxide or both cannot be kept at normal levels. A drop in the oxygen carried in blood is known as [[hypoxemia]]; a rise in arterial [[carbon dioxide]] levels is called [[hypercapnia]]. Respiratory failure is classified as either Type I or Type II, based on whether there is a high carbon dioxide level. The definition of respiratory failure in clinical trials usually includes increased respiratory rate, abnormal blood gases (hypoxemia, hypercapnia, or both), and  evidence of increased work of breathing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tulaimat|first1=A|last2=Patel|first2=A|last3=Wisniewski|first3=M|last4=Gueret|first4=R|title=The validity and reliability of the clinical assessment of increased work of breathing in acutely ill patients.|journal=Journal of critical care|date=August 2016|volume=34|pages=111–5|pmid=27288621|doi=10.1016/j.jcrc.2016.04.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The normal [[partial pressure]] reference values are: oxygen [[Blood gas tension|Pa]][[Oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] more than {{convert|80|mmHg|kPa|abbr=on}}, and carbon dioxide [[Blood gas tension|Pa]][[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] lesser than {{convert|45|mmHg|kPa|abbr=on}}.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==Cause==

Several types of condition can potentially result in respiratory failure:

*Conditions which reduce the [[ventilation (physiology)|flow of air]] into and out of the lungs, including physical obstruction by [[foreign bodies]] or [[mass effect (medicine)|masses]], and reduced breathing ability due to drugs or changes to the chest wall.
*Conditions which impair the lungs' blood supply. These include [[thromboembolism|thromboembolic conditions]] and conditions which reduce the output of the [[right heart]], such as [[right heart failure]] and some [[myocardial infarction|myocardial infarctions]].
*Conditions which limit the ability of the lung tissue to [[gas exchange|exchange]] oxygen and carbon dioxide between the blood and the air within the lungs. Any disease which can damage the lung tissue can fit into this category. The most common causes are (in no particular order) [[lower respiratory tract infection|infections]], [[interstitial lung disease]], and [[pulmonary oedema]].

==Diagnosis==

===Type 1===
Type 1 respiratory failure is defined as a [[hypoxemia|low level of oxygen in the blood (hypoxemia)]] without an increased level of [[hypercapnia|carbon dioxide in the blood (hypercapnia)]], and indeed the P&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; may be normal or low. It is typically caused by a ventilation/perfusion ([[V/Q]]) mismatch; the volume of air flowing in and out of the lungs is not matched with the flow of blood to the lungs. The basic defect in type 1 respiratory failure is failure of oxygenation characterized by:

:::{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|P&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || decreased (&lt; {{convert|60|mmHg|kPa|abbr=on}})
|-
| P&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || normal or decreased (&lt;{{convert|50|mmHg|kPa|abbr=on}})
|-
| P&lt;sub&gt;A-a&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || increased
|}

This type of respiratory failure is caused by conditions that affect [[Oxygenation (medical)|oxygenation]] such as:
* Low ambient oxygen (e.g. at high altitude)
* Ventilation-perfusion mismatch (parts of the lung receive oxygen but not enough blood to absorb it, e.g. [[pulmonary embolism]])
* Alveolar hypoventilation (decreased [[respiratory minute volume|minute volume]] due to reduced respiratory muscle activity, e.g. in acute [[neuromuscular disease]]); this form can also cause type 2 respiratory failure if severe
* Diffusion problem (oxygen cannot enter the capillaries due to parenchymal disease, e.g. in [[pneumonia]] or [[Acute respiratory distress syndrome|ARDS]])
* Shunt (oxygenated blood mixes with non-oxygenated blood from the venous system, e.g. [[Right-to-left shunt|right to left shunt]])

===Type 2===
Hypoxemia (PaO2 &lt;8kPa) with hypercapnia (PaCO2 &gt;6.0kPa).

The basic defect in type 2 respiratory failure is characterized by:

:::{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|P&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || decreased (&lt; {{convert|60|mmHg|kPa|abbr=on}})
|-
| P&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || increased (&gt; {{convert|50|mmHg|kPa|abbr=on}})
|-
| P&lt;sub&gt;A-a&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || normal
|-
|pH || decreased
|}

Type 2 respiratory failure is caused by inadequate alveolar ventilation; both oxygen and carbon dioxide are affected.  Defined as the buildup of carbon dioxide levels (P&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) that has been generated by the body but cannot be eliminated. The underlying causes include:
* Increased airways resistance ([[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], [[asthma]], suffocation)
* Reduced breathing effort (drug effects, brain stem lesion, extreme obesity)
* A decrease in the area of the lung available for gas exchange (such as in [[chronic bronchitis]])
* Neuromuscular problems ([[Guillain–Barré syndrome]],&lt;ref name="Burt 475–479"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burt|first=Christiana C.|author2=Arrowsmith, Joseph E. |title=Respiratory failure|journal=Surgery (Oxford)|date=1 November 2009|volume=27|issue=11|pages=475–479|doi=10.1016/j.mpsur.2009.09.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[motor neuron disease]])
* Deformed (kyphoscoliosis), rigid ([[ankylosing spondylitis]]), or [[flail chest]].&lt;ref name="Burt 475–479"/&gt;

==Treatment==
[[Image:VIP Bird2.jpg|thumb|right|140 px|Mechanical ventilator]]
Treatment of the underlying cause is required. [[Endotracheal intubation]] and [[mechanical ventilation]] are required in cases of severe respiratory failure (PaO2 less than 50 mmHg). [[Respiratory stimulant]]s such as [[doxapram]] are rarely used, and if the respiratory failure resulted from an [[overdose]] of [[sedative]] drugs such as [[opioid]]s or [[benzodiazepines]], then the appropriate [[antidote]] ([[naloxone]] or [[flumazenil]], respectively) will be given.

There is tentative evidence that in those with respiratory failure identified before arrival in hospital, [[continuous positive airway pressure]] can be useful when started before conveying to hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bakke|first1=SA|last2=Botker|first2=MT|last3=Riddervold|first3=IS|last4=Kirkegaard|first4=H|last5=Christensen|first5=EF|title=Continuous positive airway pressure and noninvasive ventilation in prehospital treatment of patients with acute respiratory failure: a systematic review of controlled studies.|journal=Scandinavian Journal of Trauma, Resuscitation and Emergency Medicine|date=22 November 2014|volume=22|issue=1|pages=69|pmid=25416493|doi=10.1186/s13049-014-0069-8|pmc=4251922}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''São João Theatre''' ({{lang-pt|Teatro São João}}), commonly referred to as the ''São João National Theatre'' is a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[theatre]] and concert venue in [[Freguesia (Portugal)|civil parish]] of [[Cedofeita, Santo Ildefonso, Sé, Miragaia, São Nicolau e Vitória]], in the [[Concelho|municipality]] of [[Porto]], in [[Norte Region, Portugal|northern]] [[Portugal]].

[[File:Teatro de São João 2.jpg|thumb|left|An idyllic view of the theatre and square]]
The primitive theatre was constructed at the end of the 18th century (1796) by Italian [[Vicente Mazzoneschi]], and inaugurated on 13 May 1798, as the ''Teatro do Príncipe'' (''Prince's Theatre'').&lt;ref name="SIPA"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.monumentos.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=5524 |title=Teatro de São João (IPA.00005524/PT011312140059) |publisher=SIPA – Sistema de Informação para o Património Arquitectónico |editor=SIPA |location=Lisbon, Portugal |language=Portuguese |first=Isabel |last=Sereno |first2=João |last2=Santos |year=1994 |accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was named in honour of the prince-regent [[John VI of Portugal|John VI]], who later became King. The construction firm of Francisco de Almada Mendonça was charged with the project, and produced a four-story building with its principal facade decorated with the royal coat-of-arms under an inscription.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

But, on 11 April 1908, there was a fire, destroying the theatre interior, and a new structure was built on its former site.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; Before its destruction, the theatre had a markedly horseshoe-shaped plan. Its rounded ceiling was painted by Joaquim Rafael and had in 1856 received a new painting by Paulo Pizzi.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; The building included four rows of booths, with the booth for the royal family located centrally on the second floor.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; The large atrium, and the corridors large supported by access from large staircases.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; Along the second floor was a magnificent concert hall.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; Generally, the theatre had excellent acoustics.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; The stage wall was painted by Sequeira, but was later replaced in 1825 by paintings contracted to the Spaniard João Rodrigues, and later, Palucci. Until 1838, the theatre was lit by tallow candles, and later by similar candles lit by oil.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

On 11 April 1908, the Civil Governor nominated a commission to promote the construction of a new theatre.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; 

A competition opened on October 8, presided by engineer [[Basílio Alberto de Sousa Pinto]], [[Xavier Esteves]], [[Casimiro Jerónimo de Faria]], architect [[José Marques da Silva]] and the director of public works, Isidro de Campos, whom immediately denounced the conditions of the tender. A new competition was announced a week later, based on slight alterations to the original provisions.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; Preliminary project proposals were accepted on 22 February 1910.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; It was Marques da Silva who obtained the first prize and [[João de Moura Coutinho de Almeida d'Eça]], the runner-up. Before the competition was held, the winning project was designated to Moura Coutinho, then director of the ''Direcção das Obras Públicas'' (''Directorate of Public Works'') in Braga.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; The winning project was approved on 6 May, during a municipal session, with the work awarded to the company Soconstroi.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; 

Work began in 1911 under the direction of Porto architect José Marques da Silva. The inner, horseshoe-shaped concert hall included a ceiling painted by the artists José de Brito and Acácio Lino, while the entrance hall was decorated with sculptural work by [[Henrique Araújo Moreira]], [[Diogo de Macedo]] and [[José Fernandes de Sousa Caldas]]. On the main facade, of sober design, are four reliefs representing four feelings: ''[[Kindness]]'', ''[[Suffering|Pain]]'', ''[[Hatred]]'' and ''[[Love]]'', created by Diogo de Macedo and Sousa Caldas. The building was complete in 1918. Its inauguration was held on 7 March 1920, with the presentation of [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s [[Aida]].&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

A projection area was constructed in 1932, and the theatre began to operate a cinema, then designated ''São João Cine''.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

On 26 February 1982, the building was designated a ''Imóvel de Interesse Público'' (''Property of Public Interest''), under Decree 28/82 (Diário da República, Série 1, 47).&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

In 1992, the theatre was acquired by the State from the family of Pinto da Costa.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; At that time, the work on the installation of security features and public services were undertaken on site.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; These were elaborated the following year with upgrades to dressing rooms, the stage, washrooms and remodelling of the electrical systems, which included the installation of an electrical generator.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

Two years later (23 November) a proposal was issued by the DRPorto, to reclassify the Theatre as a Portuguese National Monument.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; Following a period of remodelling, the theatre began to function regularly, under the designation the ''Teatro Nacional de São João'' (''São João National Theatre'').&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; In addition to general cleaning, the work included the consolidation and restoration of the exterior facades, recuperation of the decorative sculptures, treatment of surfaces in pigmented mortar and the installation of new woods and iron.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; 

During the course of this transition, attempts to reclassify the institution continued; on 22 April 1996, a dispatch by the Vice-President of IPPAR, devolved to the DRPorto its proposal for reformulation.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; On 12 September 2005, a new proposal was issued by that entity.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; This new proposal was favourably accepted by the deliberative council of [[IGESPAR]] (the successor to IPPAR), which also proposed that no special protection area should be needed, owing to the sites inclusion with the broader Historical Zone of Porto (an area already designated).&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; The process was ratified by the ''Secretário de Estado da Cultura'' (Secretary of State for Culture'')'' on 14 October 2010.&lt;ref name="SIPA" /&gt;

==Architecture==
[[File:Porto Teatro de Sao Joao.JPG|thumb|The main entranceway along the narrower facades, with three porticos, doorways and Neoclassical pilasters]]
[[File:64386 10150619590304143 1932033358 n (7874717548).jpg|thumb|The pediment of the lateral facades]] 
The theatre is centrally located in Porto, occupying a complete block, in front of the ''Praça da Batalha'', between the ''Rua de Augusto Rosa'' (on its left) and the ''Travessa do Cativ'' (on its right), with the ''Rua do Cativo'' to the rear.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

The rectangular plan is covered in tile roofing, with its principal facade found on one of the two smaller sides, framed laterally by rustic cornerstones and accentuated by capricious urns and garlands.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; The "noble floor" with three arches on steeped pilasters is inscribed under columns with broad shafts and Ionian capitals, while the doors of the lodges are topped by interrupted pediments.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

Three loggias exist on extended balconies, over sills in the thickness of the walls and interconnected by a balcony running on 4 strong consoles in the same alignment as the ordering columns.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; The arches have a shutter in support and transition to the entablature, which opens a frieze corresponding to a mezzanine of three openings and bas-reliefs alluding to the human passions ("Pain", "Hate", "Kindness" and "Love"), subtitled on the architrave.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; Above, the denticulated cord ends at the frieze and the beginning of a strong cornice based on rebound corbels, which are dense, in a repetitive rhythm that runs throughout the building.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; Crowning the facade is the gable, rising over a high platform, with rhythmic fenestration and formal, ornamented balustrades. The lateral facades are symmetrical.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; On the ground floor, there are 3 arched doorways (topped by a running balcony and supported by 4 consoles), flanked by 2 small doors, with an interrupted curvilinear pediment.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; Here, 3 doors (that are repeated in the two successive upper floors) with balconies and sills, are interspersed between four, embedded Ionic pilasters.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; The set is flanked by strong masks, on intermediate floor, on which a window opens at the top, with small gap at the bottom.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; Corresponding to the stage area, there are high, open slits; in this area, the body of the theatre rises above the entablature, accompanying the broken forms or gables, underlined by the frame and ornamental strip.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; 

===Interior===
On the ground floor, the vestibule occupies the whole width of the building, with access through the 3 doors of the main facade and lateral entranceways.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; From this space you can access the corridors leading to the audience seating or, to the side, the stairs to the upper floors.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; The avant-foyer and foyer are located on the first floor and occupy the entire width of the building, with two rooms for a restaurant and smoking room.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; With its double height, corresponding to the main hall and facade, the interior is profusely decorated along the windows and balustrades, with a wide oculus on the transition doors to the "avant-foyer".&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; The two floors correspond to the first-order royal boxes, and, on the second floor, the second-order boxes.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; The "avant-foyer" and "foyer" allow circulation with its balconies. On the last floors are the galleries and the amphitheater, forming a single group of places, but with different accesses (one at the level of the lower floors and another at the level of the highest).&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; On the first floor of the amphitheater is a storage room and a paint shop.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; From the ground floor, the stairs lead to the galleries and amphitheatres, by two direct, exterior entrances, along the lateral facades.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; The layout of the horseshoe-shaped hall holds 1328 seats, including the 6 large boxes, with one at the height of the first floor, intended as an alternative to a royal box.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; Between the audience and the stage is the orchestra pit, with independent entrances from the side facades.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; The stage and dressing rooms have side and rear entrances, that can be divided by a metallic cloth.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

'''''The House of Martin Guerre''''' is a musical written by [[Leslie Arden]] (music, lyrics &amp; co-book) and [[Anna Theresa Cascio]] (co-book). It is inspired by the 16th century French peasant [[Martin Guerre]].  It was first produced by Theatre Plus under the direction of Duncan McIntosh in Toronto (1993) at the Jane Mallett Theatre.&lt;ref name="Atkey, Mel 2006"&gt;Atkey, Mel. (2006) Broadway North: The Dream of a Canadian Musical Theatre Natural Heritage/Natural History Inc. {{ISBN|1-897045-08-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It won the 1994 [[Dora Mavor Moore Award]].&lt;ref&gt;http://northernriver.com/houseofmartinguerre.html&lt;/ref&gt; It was then developed further by the Canadian theatrical producer [[Livent]] and went on to be produced by Chicago’s [[Goodman Theatre]] in 1996. It was directed by [[David Petrarca]] and received the Best Musical 1996 Jefferson Award.{{fact|date=November 2012}} [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']] said the show was “so fresh, so resoundingly complete and rewarding, that there is talk her first major show may yet land on Broadway”.&lt;ref name="Atkey, Mel 2006"/&gt;  In 1997, it was once again produced in Toronto by the Canadian Stage Company again directed by David Petrarca. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.stage-door.org/reviews/canstg97.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  Arden was nominated with a [[Floyd S. Chalmers Canadian Play Award|Chalmers Award]] for her work.

In 2018, it was performed in concert at the Charlottetown Festival in Prince Edward Island, starring Adam Brazier, Joseé Boudreau, Rebecca Poff and Craig Fair. Narration was provided by Julain Molnar, who originated the role of Bertrande. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://confederationcentre.com/news/complete-ensemble-announced-for-the-house-of-martin-guerre/|title=Complete Ensemble Announced For The House of Martin Guerre – Confederation Centre of the Arts|website=confederationcentre.com|language=en-CA|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
...In 1991, she began working on the Martin Guerre story, creating music and lyrics at the same time.  The story is famous, a 16th-century tale of a young French peasant farm boy who was forced into an arranged marriage. The unhappy Martin Guerre deserted his wife Bertrande and baby son, returning eight years later to assume his position as head of the family and heir to the Guerre land. According to legend, Bertrande readily accepted her husband, who had apparently been transformed into a loving and caring partner. Four years later, however, she suddenly denounced him as an impostor, and he was jailed and sent to trial.

Friedman Theatre]] and played a limited run until 12 December 2010; it featured the original cast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playbill.com/events/event_detail/18839-Pitmen-Painters-The-at-Samuel-J-Friedman-Theatre Playbill Listing]&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Pitmen Painters'' opened in London's West End in October 2011 at the Duchess Theatre. The Canadian premiere of ''The Pitmen Painters'' ran in February 2012 at Theatre Aquarius in [[Hamilton, Ontario]].

== Background ==
Hall learnt about the group from a ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' article by [[Martin Wainwright]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/oct/27/arts.artsnews?INTCMP=SRCH Pitmen Painters get royal seal of approval]&lt;/ref&gt;  This encouraged him to buy the book "Pitmen Painters: The Ashington Group 1934-1984" by [[William Feaver]] about the group, on which the play is loosely based.  

== Other productions ==
A February 2014 production by United Players at the Jericho Theatre in [[Vancouver]] sold out many of its performances. A Spanish adaption "Mineros" has been performed at the Metropolitan Theater in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

'''V-Day''', February 14, is a global activist movement to end [[violence against women]] and girls started by author, playwright and activist [[Eve Ensler]]. It has been co-ordinated by a [[501(c)(3)]] organization since 1998 which allows royalty-free performances of ''[[The Vagina Monologues]]'' to be held for charity every February 14. Ensler has been quoted as saying that it was women's reactions to the play that inspired her and her colleagues to launch V-Day. The 'V' in V-Day stands for Victory, Valentine and Vagina.

== About V-Day ==
In 1998, a non-profit charity, "V-Day", was incorporated with the intent of using performances of ''The Vagina Monologues'' to raise money to benefit female victims of violence and sexual abuse. Since its inception, the movement has expanded its use of art and activism to include screenings and reading — most notably of the documentary ''[[Until The Violence Stops]]'' (2004) and the compilation ''A Memory, Monologue, A Rant, and a Prayer''. Marches and festivals that have been held as part of the movement include UNTIL THE VIOLENCE STOPS: NYC (June 2006), and the ten-year anniversary V TO THE TENTH at the Louisiana Superdome and New Orleans Arena in 2008.

Beginning in early 2001, V-Day activities expanded to the international stage, with V-Day hosting leadership summits for women in Afghanistan and a gathering of activists in Rome. V-Day also launched the Karama program in the Middle East and coordinated community briefings on the missing and murdered women of Juarez, Mexico. In some societies where [[censorship]] forbids performances of ''The Vagina Monologues'', events revolve around other works developed by V-Day, including the book ''A Memory, a Monologue, a Rant, and a Prayer'', an anthology of writings about violence against women. V-Day included the first ever all [[transgender]] version of ''The Vagina Monologues'' in 2004, with a performance by eighteen notable [[transwomen]] under the mentoring of [[Jane Fonda]] and [[Andrea James]] of [[Deep Stealth Productions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deepstealth.com/vday/ |title=Deep Stealth and V-Day 2004 Performance of Vagina Monologues}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consistent growth of the movement led to 5,400 events in 1,500 locations taking place in 2010 alone. It was then estimated that $80 million had been raised since the movement's inception with over 12,000 community-based anti-violence programs and safe houses in [[Democratic Republic of Congo|The Congo]], [[Haiti]], [[Kenya]], [[Egypt]] and [[Iraq]] receiving funding.

== Mission ==
According to its website, V-Day's vision is "''a world where women live safely and freely''."  They aim to tackle issues such as [[rape]] and [[Battery (crime)|battery]] of women, [[incest]], [[female genital mutilation]] and [[human trafficking]] of female sex slaves.

The organization seeks to strengthen existing anti-violence efforts by raising money and consciousness, and to lay the groundwork for new educational and protective legislative endeavours for women throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vday.org/contents/vday/aboutvday/mission |title=Mission |accessdate=2008-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515075252/http://www.vday.org/contents/vday/aboutvday/mission |archivedate=May 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; V-Day's work is grounded in four core beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vday.org/about/four-core-beliefs.html|title=Four Core Beliefs|publisher=V-Day|accessdate=2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; These stated as:

*Art has the power to transform thinking and inspire people to act. 
*Lasting social and cultural change is spread by ordinary people doing extraordinary things. 
*Local women best know what their communities need and can become unstoppable leaders. 
*One must look at the intersection of race, class, and gender to understand violence against women.

== V-Day campaigns ==
There are two types of V-Campaigns: The College Campaign and the Community Campaign.

Through these V-Day campaigns, local volunteers and college students produce annual benefit performances of ''The Vagina Monologues'', ''A Memory, A Monologue, A Rant and A Prayer'' and ''Any One of Us: Words From Prison''. They also offer screenings of the V-Day documentary ''Until The Violence Stops'' and the PBS documentary ''What I Want My Words to Do to You'', and conduct Spotlight Campaign Teach-Ins and V-Men workshops, to raise awareness and funds for anti-violence groups within their communities.

Each year V-Day spotlights a particular group of women who are experiencing violence with the goal of putting a worldwide media spotlight on this area and to raise funds to aide groups who are addressing it. For example, V-Day advocated for change throughout the Congo in 2007 by launching the ''Stop Raping Our Greatest Resource: Power To The Women and Girls of the Democratic Republic of Congo'' campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vday.org/drc|title=City of Joy|publisher=V-Day|accessdate=2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 spotlight focused on the women and girls of Haiti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vday.org/spotlight2011|title=2012 Women and Girls of Haiti|publisher=V-Day|accessdate=2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this year, the efforts in the Congo led to the opining of the survivors community [[City of Joy (city)|City of Joy]] in collaboration with Fondation Panzi and UNICEF. Located in Bukavu, the facilities provide 180 Congolese women per year with group therapy, self-defense training, sexuality education, ecology / horticulture education and cultural events.

With the support of Eve Ensler and the publicity from the V-Day campaign, [[One Billion Rising]], a global protest to end violence and promote justice and gender equality, was founded on February 14, 2012, the fifteenth V-Day. The name described a [[United Nations|UN]] and [[World Health Organization|WHO]] estimate for the number of women in the world who are likely to be raped or beaten at least once.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/womens-blog/2013/dec/09/one-billion-rising-2014-campaign-end-violence-against-women-justice|title=One Billion Rising: The 2014 campaign to end violence against women|first=Eve|last=Ensler|publisher=The Guardian|date=2013-12-09|accessdate=2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project urges women and men to dance and rise up in opposition to violence. It has reached over 200 countries in regions such as North Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, with actions in each area dependent on local circumstances, traditions, and religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nytlive.nytimes.com/womenintheworld/2015/05/25/happy-birthday-eve-ensler/|title=Happy Birthday Eve Ensler|publisher=Women In The World in association with The New York Times|date=2015-05-25|accessdate=2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feminist.com/violence/vday33.html|title=Until the Violence Stops: V-Day Launches One Billion Rising|publisher=V-Day Column|date=2012-02-14|accessdate=2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
In the early 2000s, some right wing critics attacked V-Day for "hijacking the occasion of [[Valentine's Day]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.browndailyherald.com/2014/11/17/janus-forum-sexual-assault-event-sparks-controversy/|publisher=Brown Daily Herald|title=Janus Forum sexual assault event sparks controversy|first1=Camilla|last1=Brandfield-Harvey|first2=Caroline|last2=Kelly|date=2014-11-17|accessdate=2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; These conservative critics argued that feminists should not be admonishing people to consider rape, incest and violence on an occasion designed to celebrate love and romance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/003/728syqcj.asp|title=The V-Day Chronicles|publisher=The Weekly Standard|first=Rachel|last=DiCarlo|date=2004-02-12|accessdate=2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individualist feminist [[Wendy McElroy]] stated that "V-Day embodies the same double standard and dishonesty that has characterized most feminist pronouncements for decades" and urged people to "take back Valentines Day".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://liberator.net/articles/McElroyWendy/takevd.html|title=Take Back Valentine's Day!|first=Wendy|last=McElroy|date=2002-02-15|accessdate=2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

One critique came from Clara Eugenia Rojas in her 2005 publication "The ‘V-Day’ March in Mexico: Appropriation and Misuse of Local Women’s Activism."  Following the murders of the women in [[Juarez, Mexico]], V-Day became involved with this cause.  Rojas, a local feminist activist, noted that immediately following the discovery of the bodies, there was little that she nor anyone else could do to draw attention to the injustice and need for change.  After five years of local activists attempting to promote awareness about the violence, V-Day finally put a spotlight on the incident and made it a global issue.  Rojas, although grateful for the global exposure to the incident, believes that V-Day came too late to make much difference and that they were involved for the wrong reasons, i.e., publicity.  Rojas also critiques the movement for sidelining the local feminists who were originally attached to this incident and failing to include them in organization or implementation of the march.&lt;ref&gt;The ‘V-Day’March in Mexico: Appropriation and Misuse of Local Women’s Activism. "National Women’s Studies Association Journal" 17:217-227&lt;/ref&gt;

Another critique comes from the [[LGBT]] (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender) community. In her article "Queerness, Disability, and The Vagina Monologues”, Kim Hall explained her dissatisfaction with the V-Day movement and more specifically ''The Vagina Monologues'' on an exclusionary basis.  Hall believes that the play excludes issues of violence against intersex individuals and perpetuates heterosexism and [[ableism]], or prejudice against people with disabilities. After this critique was published, many performances of ''The Vagina Monologues'' began advocating for the Intersex Society of North America by providing literature at the plays and urging the audience to donate.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Kim Q. 2005. “Queerness, Disability, and The Vagina Monologues.” Hypatia 20:100-119.&lt;/ref&gt;
