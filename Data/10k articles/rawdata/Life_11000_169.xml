'''Abdallah al-Battal''' ({{lang-ar|عبدالله البطال}}; "Abdallah the Hero", died in 740) was a Muslim Arab commander in the [[Arab–Byzantine Wars]] of the early 8th century, participating in several of the campaigns launched by the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] against the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Historical facts about his life are sparse, but an extensive pseudo-historical and legendary tradition grew around him after his death, and he became a famous figure in both Arabic and later Turkish [[epic literature]] as '' [[Battal Gazi|Sayyid Battal Ghazi]]''.

== Biography ==
Nothing is known of Abdallah al-Battal's origin or early life. Much later accounts claim that he hailed from [[Antioch]] or [[Damascus]], and that he was a ''[[mawla]]'' of the [[Umayyad]] family. He is also given various ''[[kunya (Arabic)|kunya]]'', Abu Muhammad, Abu Yahya, or Abu 'l-Husayn, by which he is usually known.&lt;ref name="EI2"&gt;Canard (1960), pp. 1002–1003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EI3"&gt;Athamina (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the ''[[nisba (onomastics)|nisba]]'' of ''al-Antaqi'' ("of Antioch") rather than a [[Arab tribes|tribal affiliation]] suggests that he may not have been of Arab origin; in this context, his name "[[Abdallah]]" further suggests that he was a convert to Islam, as this name (meaning "servant of Allah") was often given to new converts in early Islamic times.&lt;ref name="EI3"/&gt; [[Khalid Yahya Blankinship]] suggested that he might be the same person as a certain "'Amr" recorded by the Byzantine chronicler [[Theophanes the Confessor]] in the [[Siege of Nicaea (727)|Nicaea campaign]] of 727, and hence that "'Amr" could be his actual personal name or a [[patronymic]] (i.e. his name could be 'Amr ibn Abdallah or Abdallah ibn 'Amr), while alternatively "Abdallah" could simply be an honorific.&lt;ref&gt;Blankinship (1994), p. 314 (Note 20)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Asia Minor ca 740 AD.svg|thumb|right|250px|Map of Byzantine Asia Minor and the Arab–Byzantine frontier zone in the early 8th century]]
Arab accounts from the 10th century place al-Battal alongside [[Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik]] during the latter's [[Siege of Constantinople (717–718)|unsuccessful siege]] of [[Constantinople]] in 717–718, but as the Arab accounts of the siege are semi-legendary, it is impossible to know if this report contains any truth.&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt; In reliable historical sources (the chroniclers [[al-Ya'qubi]] and [[al-Tabari]]), al-Battal first appears in 727, in one of the annual raids against Byzantine [[Asia Minor]]. This campaign was commanded by [[Mu'awiya ibn Hisham]], the son of the reigning Caliph [[Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik|Hisham]] ([[reign]]ed 723–743). Al-Battal led the vanguard, with which he penetrated as far as the city of [[Gangra]] in [[Paphlagonia]], which he captured and razed, before the army went on to unsuccessfully lay siege to [[Nicaea]].&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blankinship (1994), p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; Blankinship considers that al-Battal's capture of Gangra ranks as one of the greatest successes of Umayyad arms against the Byzantines in this period, along with the capture of [[Caesarea Mazaca|Caesarea]] by Maslama in 726.&lt;ref&gt;Blankinship (1994), pp. 120–121&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Battal himself commanded another raid in [[Anno Hegirae|AH]] 114 (731–732), of which little is known. It most probably was a failure, and is remembered only for the death in battle of another Arab hero, Abd al-Wahhab ibn Bukht.&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="B162"&gt;Blankinship (1994), p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; In the next year, AH 115 (732–733), al-Battal campaigned again alongside Mu'awiya ibn Hisham, raiding as far as [[Akroinon]] in [[Phrygia]]. A Byzantine army under a certain Constantine tried to confront the Muslims, but al-Battal defeated Constantine and took him prisoner.&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="B162"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PmbZ"&gt;Lilie, et al. (1999), pp. 5–6&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Battal's next and last appearance is in 740, when a major campaign involving several tens of thousands of men was launched by the Umayyads against Byzantium. Along with Malik ibn Shu'ayb, deputy governor of [[Malatya]], al-Battal commanded a 20,000-strong cavalry force while [[Sulayman ibn Hisham]] led the main force behind them. Al-Battal and Malik's force reached as far as Akroinon, but there they were [[Battle of Akroinon|confronted and defeated]] by the Byzantines under Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian]] ({{reign|717–741}}) in person. Both Arab generals and two thirds of their army perished.&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PmbZ"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blankinship (1994), pp. 169–170&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legend ==
{{see |Battal Gazi}}
Although his military career was "not particularly distinguished" according to Marius Canard, Abdallah al-Battal quickly became the subject of popular tales and his fame grew, so that by the 10th century he was well established as one of the heroic figures of the [[Arab–Byzantine Wars]]: [[al-Mas'udi]] (''[[The Meadows of Gold]]'', VIII, 74–75) ranks him among the "illustrious Muslims" whose portraits were displayed in Byzantine churches as a mark of respect.&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt; In the 10th–12th centuries his alleged role in the siege of Constantinople was embellished by the Persian historian [[Bal'ami]] and the [[al-Andalus|Andalusian]] mystic [[Ibn Arabi]].&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt; A number of fictional anecdotes became part of the accepted historical corpus around al-Battal from the time of [[Ibn 'Asakir]] (1106–1175) on: the use of his name to frighten children by the Byzantines; his entry into [[Amorion]] pretending to be a messenger and discovery of the Byzantine plans; his stay at a convent, whose [[abbess]] shielded him from Byzantine soldiers and whom he took with him and married; and finally his death in battle and burial, attended by Emperor Leo himself.&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt; On the other hand, beginning with Ibn 'Asakir's contemporary al-Samaw'al ibn Yahya al-Maghribi, a succession of Muslim chroniclers were critical of the various fabrications introduced into the accounts of al-Battal's life. [[Ibn Kathir]] in particular regarded it as "poor and confused material suitable only for the unsophisticated".&lt;ref name="EI3"/&gt;

Al-Battal's exploits became the subject of two [[Romance (heroic literature)|romances]], the Arabic-language "Tale of Delhemma and al-Battal" (''[[Delhemma|Sīrat Ḏāt al-Himma wa-l-Baṭṭāl]]'') and the Turkish epic tradition of ''[[Battal Gazi|Sayyid Baṭṭāl Ghāzī]]''.&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt; Although both were composed in the 12th century and draw upon a common Arabic tradition, they show significant differences, with the Turkish tale including many uniquely Turkic and Persian influences, including supernatural elements from folk tradition or motifs from the ''[[Shahname]]'' and the ''Romance of [[Abu Muslim]]''.&lt;ref name="Melikoff"&gt;Melikoff (1960), pp. 1003–1004&lt;/ref&gt; Both romances place al-Battal in the mid-9th century and associate him with the epic cycle of Malatya and its emir, [[Umar al-Aqta]] (died 863), with the result that he became particularly associated with the city of Malatya and its region.&lt;ref name="Melikoff"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dedes (1996), pp. 9–14&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Delhemma'', his own role in the Umayyad wars with Byzantium is taken over by the [[Banu Kilab|Kilabite]] hero al-Sahsah. In these tales al-Battal is presented as an Islamic analogue to [[Odysseus|Ulysses]], to the extent that his name became a byword for cunning.&lt;ref&gt;Canard (1961), pp.  158–173, esp. 167–169&lt;/ref&gt;

The Turks adopted al-Battal following the [[Danishmendid]] conquest of Malatya in 1102, and he became prominent as a Turkish national hero, as a symbol of the revived frontier spirit of the ''[[jihad]]'' of early Muslim times, and of the Turkish conquest of Asia Minor. His stories (''Battalname'') were reworked throughout the [[Seljuk dynasty|Seljuk]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] periods, and he became the subject of a considerable body of folk tales.&lt;ref name="Melikoff"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dedes (1996), pp. 9–16, 23–25&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, according to the 14th-century geographer Abu'l-Fida, based on the 13th-century work of Ibn Sa'id, the river Dalaman çayı, which formed the boundary between the lands of the [[Seljuk Turks]] and the [[Empire of Nicaea]], was known as the "River of Battal".&lt;ref&gt;Wittek (1934), pp. 1–3, 7–8&lt;/ref&gt; A cult developed around him as a saintly figure ("''[[sayyid]]''"), especially among the [[Alevi]] and [[Bektashi]] sects, and his supposed tomb at [[Seyitgazi]] became a major centre of pilgrimage until the early 20th century, drawing pilgrims from as far as Central Asia.&lt;ref name="Melikoff"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dedes (1996), pp. 16–22&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abdul Khaliq Ghijduvani''' (died 1179) was one of a group of Central Asian Sufi teachers known simply as [[Khwajagan]] (the Masters) of the [[Naqshbandi]] order.

Abdul Khaliq was born in the small town of Ghijduvan, near [[Bukhara]]. His father had migrated to Central Asia from [[Malatya]], in eastern [[Anatolia]] where he had been a prominent [[faqih]]. While Abdul Khaliq was studying [[tafsir]] in Bukhara he first had an awakening of interest in the path. He received further training at the hands of [[Yusuf Hamdani]], and was the next link in the Naqshbandi [[silsila]] following him.

Abdul Khaliq bequeathed to subsequent generations of the Naqshbandi silsila a series of principles governing their Sufi practice, concisely formulated in Persian and known collectively as "the Sacred Words" (''kalimat-i qudsiya''), or the "Rules" or "Secrets" of the Naqshbandi Order.

'''Abu Kalijar Marzuban''' (died October 1048) was the [[Buyid]] amir of [[Fars Province|Fars]] (1024–1048), [[Kerman]] (1028–1048) and [[Iraq]] (1044–1048). He was the eldest son of [[Sultan al-Dawla]].

== Struggle for supremacy over the Buyid kingdom ==
The death of Sultan al-Dawla in 1024 prompted a succession crisis within the Buyid state. Not until 1027 did the army in [[Baghdad]] pick his brother [[Jalal al-Dawla]] as ruler. In the meantime Abu Kalijar had built up his power in Fars, although the first several years of his reign were marked by the oversight of his tutor, a eunuch named Sandal. and entered into a conflict with the Buyid ruler of [[Kerman]], [[Qawam al-Dawla]]. The latter's death in 1028 allowed Abu Kalijar to occupy the province. In 1030, Jalal al-Dawla sent a fleet of 1300 ships under his vizier [[Abu Ali Hasan]] to capture [[Basra]] from Abu Kalijar, but the expedition was a disaster and ended in a complete defeat. Abu Ali Hasan was then taken prisoner, but was soon released. Abu Kalijar shortly sent an army under his vizier [[Bahram ibn Mafinna]], who managed to conquer [[Khuzistan]]. Abu Kalijar then made [[Ahvaz]] his capital.

In 1033 the [[Ghaznavids]] invaded Kerman, with the object of overrunning the Buyid states. However, the financial obligations imposed on the people of Kerman convinced them that Buyid rule would be preferable. In the following year, Bahram ibn Mafinna expelled the Ghaznavids from the province.{{sfn|Bosworth|1975|p=189}}

Abu Kalijar also wanted to gain control of Iraq. Around 1037 his army marched on Baghdad; although he did not take the city, Jalal al-Dawla recognized him as senior amir. Abu Kalijar subsequently used the title "[[Shah]]anshah" on his coins. However, the amir of [[Mosul]], along with the [[Arab]] tribe of the Asadids, supported Jalal al-Dawla, and the two Buyids were forced to come to a compromise. Both rulers used the same titles and were genuinely independent of each other. Iraq therefore stayed out of Abu Kalijar's control, though he managed to make his son the governor of Basra. In 1041/1042, Bahram ibn Mafinna died, and was succeeded by [[Dhu'l-Sa'adat]] as the vizier of Abu Kalijar.{{sfn|Kennedy|1975|p=242}}

Jalal al-Dawla's death in 1044 gave Abu Kalijar possession of Iraq. His control over the region, however, remained weak; his capital therefore remained in Ahvaz, instead of being moved to Baghdad. In the meantime, the [[Kakuyids]] of [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]] were torn between two rival brothers, and Abu Kalijar attempted to force them to submit to his authority. They preferred, however, to recognize the [[Seljuks]] as their overlords.{{sfn|Bosworth|1975|p=300}} During the same year, Abu Kalijar strengthened the walls of Shiraz.

== Height of power and death ==
Abu Kalijar continued to cement his authority by traveling to Baghdad, where he received the title of senior amir as well as the title "Muhyi al-Din" ("Reviver of Religion"). Several minor rulers of [[Mesopotamia]] recognized his authority, and even the Kakuyids declared their allegiance. This last act, however, prompted a Seljuk intervention, and Abu Kalijar decided to negotiate and create a marriage alliance. The Buyid governor of Kerman, however, decided to submit to the Seljuk [[Kavurt|Qavurt]]. Abu Kalijar marched to reassert his authority, only to be met with an ambassador of the governor, who brought gifts and a promise to renew his allegiance. Shortly afterwards, Abu Kalijar died at the age of thirty-eight. He was succeeded by his son [[al-Malik al-Rahim]], but the Buyids suffered a succession struggle soon after his death, and Kerman entered into the Seljuk orbit.

'''Adelaida Martínez Aguilar''' (16 December 1870—???) was a [[Mexicans|Mexican]] [[teacher]], [[writer]], and [[poet]] active in the Tepic Territory from the 1860s until her death. In her 1910 book ''Mujeres Notables Mexicanas'', [[Laureana Wright de Kleinhans]] wrote a short biography of Aguilar and provided one of her poems written for a local newspaper under alias.{{sfn|de Kleinhans|1910|pp=470-71}}

==Biography==
Adelaida Martínez Aguilar was born in [[Santiago Ixcuintla]], to Colonel Agatón Martinez and Adelaide Aguilar. Aguilar was orphaned at age three when her mother died and father left for work, thus entering the care of her stepmother, Lugarda Sandoval. Sandoval was no teacher herself, so Aguilar was sent to study at [[Rosa Navarro]]'s school in [[Guadalajara]], [[Jalisco]] province, where she would spend six years studying and graduated in 1886 and herself became a teacher. Family matters brought her back to her home town, and there she dedicated herself to education and giving [[piano]] lessons. From 1893, and under the [[pseudonym]] ''Celia'', Aguilar wrote [[poetry]] for the local newspaper, ''El Phonograph''.{{sfn|de Kleinhans|1910|pp=470-71}} She died in [[Tepic Territory]]. Her date of death is unknown.

'''Aelius Promotus''' ([[ancient Greek|Gr.]] '''{{lang|grc|Αίλιος Προμωτος}}''') was an [[Medicine in ancient Greece|ancient physician]] of [[Alexandria]],&lt;ref name="dgrbm"&gt;{{Citation  | last = Greenhill  | first = William Alexander  | contribution = Aelius Promotus  | editor-last = Smith  | editor-first = William  | title = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]  | volume = 1  | pages = 29   | place = Boston  | year = 1867  | contribution-url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0038.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; of whose personal history no particulars are known, and whose date is uncertain.  He is supposed by [[Jean-Baptiste-Gaspard d'Ansse de Villoison|Villoison]] to have lived after the time of [[Pompey|Pompey the Great]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean-Baptiste-Gaspard d'Ansse de Villoison]], ''Anecd. Graec.'' vol. ii. p. 179. note 1.&lt;/ref&gt; that is, in the 1st century BC.  By others he is considered to be much more ancient; yet other scholars place him as late as the second half of the 1st century AD.  He is most probably the same person who is quoted by [[Galen]] simply by the name of ''Aelius''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Galen]], ''De Compos. Medicam. secund. Locos.'' iv. 7, vol. xii. p. 730.&lt;/ref&gt;  He wrote several Greek medical works, which are still to be found in manuscript in different libraries in Europe. The treatise ''On venomous beasts and poisonous drugs'', attributed to Aelius, was last published in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;S. Ihm, ''Der Traktat περὶ τῶν ἰοβόλων θηρίων καὶ δηλητηρίων φαρμάκων des sog. Aelius Promotus''. Serta Graeca 4. Wiesbaden: Dr. Ludwig Reichert Verlag, 1995. https://books.google.com/books?id=IL8rAAAAYAAJ&lt;/ref&gt;  His main work titled {{lang|grc|Δυναμερόν}}&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|grc|Δυναμερόν}} is a word used by the later Greek writers, and is explained by Du Cange (''Gloss. Med. et Infim. Graecit.'') to mean ''vis, virtus''.  It is however frequently used in the sense given to it in the text.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Latin]] ''Medicinalium Formularum Collectio''), was first published in its complete extension in 2002 by Daria Crismani.&lt;ref&gt;''Elio Promoto alessandrino, Manuale della salute'', a cura di Daria Crismani (Hellenica 9), Alessandria 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Two other of his works are quoted or mentioned by [[Geronimo Mercuriali|Hieronymus Mercurialis]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Geronimo Mercuriali|Hieronymus Mercurialis]], ''Variae Lectiones'', iii. 4; ''De Venenis et Morbis Venenosis,'' i. 16, ii. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  And also by Schneider in his prefaces to [[Nicander]]'s ''[[Theriaca (poem)|Theriaca]]'',&lt;ref&gt;p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Alexipharmaca''.&lt;ref&gt;p. xix.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Agneta Marianne Frieberg''' (2 June 1945 – 10 May 1971) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] fashion model and activist. She was known for her extensive pictorial and commercial work throughout the 1960s, resulting in a decade-long career under the [[Ford Models|Ford Modeling agnecy]].

Born and raised in [[Sweden]], Frieberg migrated to [[California]] with her family in the 1950s. In 1960, Frieberg had been discovered by [[Eileen Ford]] in [[New York City]], resulting in an international deal with [[Ford Models]] shortly after, at age 15. Frieberg appeared on over 100 covers for publications including ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', ''[[Elle (magazine)|ELLE]]'', ''[[Mademoiselle (magazine)|Mademoiselle]]'' and ''[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]'', among others. Having previously modeled for [[Catalina Swimwear]] and [[Revlon]] advertisements, Frieberg was also known for her partnership with [[Clairol]], as the face of their ''Great Body line'' (1967–73). Frieberg was less active by the late-1960s, focusing on the [[anti-war movement]] and [[Civil rights activist|civil rights activism]] instead.

In May 1971, Frieberg fell from the top story of a hotel in [[Paris, France]], on [[Mother's Day]]. She was rushed to the [[American Hospital of Paris]], where she remained for 4 days before dying of [[Free fall|falling]]-invoked injuries. Her death was subject to widespread media coverage throughout Europe and the US, as well as resulting in controversy due to conspiracies over her [[cause of death]].

In her lifetime, Frieberg's success lead to her receiving the third highest salary of a fashion model in her era, behind [[Twiggy]] and [[Veruschka von Lehndorff|Veruschka]]. She was further recognized as "one of the [[Supermodel|first supermodels]]" by publications including ''Glamour''. Frieberg was often characterized by her signature waist-length hair and "girl next door" appeal.

Frieberg was born on 2 June 1945 in Sweden. While in her teenage years, Agneta and her family moved from Sweden to [[Marin County, California|Marin County]], California, United States. Frieberg's mother, Cecilia Frieberg, was a [[Montessori]] school teacher and her father, Bengt O.

Frieberg |publisher=Balkom.se |date=1 September 2003 |accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agneta was the oldest of four children.

In 1959, Frieberg and her parents along with brother, Magnus, and sister, Marianne, moved to California from their native country Sweden. They took a vacation the following year to New York City. While walking around New York, Frieberg caught the attention of [[Ford Models]] owner and modeling agent [[Eileen Ford]]. Ford quickly approached Frieberg, and discussed signing Frieberg to her agency. Frieberg was granted permission from her parents and was able to sign to Ford soon after. Her career started shortly after she went home.

Frieberg dated painter [[Jack Youngerman]] for several years.

In the mid-1960s, Frieberg appeared on the bottle of [[Clairol]]'s hair product "Great Body". Frieberg also appeared in several advertisements, commercials, and merchandise for the Great Body conditioner. In February 1966, in an issue of the magazine ''[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]'', the editors described Frieberg along with nineteen other models as a "supermodel", also adding that Frieberg was "innocent, tall, and fresh."&lt;ref name="Glamourissue66"&gt;BarryPopik.com Supermodel 25 July 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GLAMOUR66"&gt;Cokal, Susann.

Later in 1966, she appeared in the famous Ormond Gigli photo of [[Ford Models|the sixties' top Ford models]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patriksandberg.com/2011/12/09/eileen-ford/ |title=Eileen Ford |publisher=Patrik Sandberg |date=4 July 2013 |accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GIGLI"&gt;{{cite web|author=da  Pleasurephoto |url=http://pleasurephoto.wordpress.com/2012/01/24/ford-modeling-agency-photographed-by-ormond-gigli-1966/ |title=Ford Modeling Agency, photographed by Ormond Gigli, 1966 &amp;#124;  Pleasurephoto |publisher=Pleasurephoto.wordpress.com |date=24 January 2012 |accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1968, Frieberg was featured in her agent and Ford Models founder Eileen Ford's first book, ''Eileen Ford's Book of Model Beauty''. She appeared on an episode of the television show ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]''.

Frieberg briefly appeared in her boyfriend [[Louis Faurer]]'s documentary ''Time Capsule'', which captured [[Time Square]] and other parts of New York City over a span of several years. The film was recently rediscovered after being lost in Faurer's archives. The film was aired in a show at Milwaukee Museum in New York City.&lt;ref name="Nytimes23Faurer"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/23/arts/design/23faurer.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|title=Louis Faurer's 'Time Capsule' Catches '60s Times Square|publisher=NYTimes.com|accessdate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frieberg briefly dated  [[pop art]] artist [[Andy Warhol]], who made her the subject of several of his photographs.&lt;ref name="warhol"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ibwmAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=agneta+frieberg&amp;dq=agneta+frieberg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fpiXUpfcOZL6oASQy4LwAQ&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ |title=Archiving Warhol: An Illustrated History – Gerard Malanga – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also briefly dated rock musician and guitarist [[Jimi Hendrix]] from rock band [[The Jimi Hendrix Experience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Por banjomanbold |url=https://banjomanbold.wordpress.com/tag/agneta-freiberg/ |title=Agneta Freiberg &amp;#124; BanjomanBold |publisher=Banjomanbold.wordpress.com |date=14 September 2011 |accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frieberg has appeared on the cover of magazines including ''[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]'' (July 1964, March and June 1965, and December 1967), ''[[Mademoiselle (magazine)|Mademoiselle]]'' (April, May, July, September, and December 1964, May and February 1967, May 1968, and October 1969), ''[[McCall's]]'' (January 1963), ''[[Good Housekeeping]]'' (April and September 1965 and February 1967), ''HairDo'' (May 1965), ''Ingenue'' (August 1965), ''RedBook'' (February 1966), and ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]'' (April 1966).

[[File:Hôptal américain de Neuilly 2011.jpg|thumbnail|right|The American Hospital of Paris]]
In 1971, at the young age of twenty-five, Frieberg died in Paris, France. She was staying in a hotel on the top floor, when she fell out of the window. She lingered in a coma at the [[American Hospital of Paris]] for ten days until eventually dying on 10 May 1971, which happened to be [[Mother's Day (United States)|Mother's Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cmtk3.webring.org/l/rd?ring=alexandradahlstr;id=1;url=http%3A%2F%2Flindamorand%2Ecom%2Fblog1%2F%3Fp%3D1623 |title=The Female Celebrities Webring |publisher=Cmtk3.webring.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There was speculation that Frieberg had been pushed instead of falling.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} The autopsy showed that Frieberg had no drugs or alcohol in her system at the time of her death. American author [[Michael Gross (writer)|Michael Gross]] wrote false claims about Frieberg in his book ''Model: The Ugly Business of Beautiful Women'', where he referred to her as a German model who died while on drugs.

== Personal life ==
Frieberg commuted between California and New York. She maintained close friendships with fellow Ford model [[Ulla Jones]], actresses Jane Fonda and Delphine Seyrig, and model [[Cheryl Tiegs]]. In Frieberg's spare time, she sang and played guitar and piano. She was a frequent reader, reading between shots, her favourite author being [[North America|American]] author and journalist [[Ernest Hemingway]].

'''''Agrobacterium''''' is a [[genus]] of [[Gram-negative]] [[bacteria]] established by H. J. Conn that uses [[horizontal gene transfer]] to cause [[Plant tumor|tumors in plants]]. ''[[Agrobacterium tumefaciens]]'' is the most commonly studied [[species]] in this genus. ''Agrobacterium'' is well known for its ability to transfer [[DNA]] between itself and plants, and for this reason it has become an important tool for [[genetic engineering]].

The genus ''Agrobacterium'' is quite [[heterogeneous]]. Recent [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] studies have reclassified all of the ''Agrobacterium'' species into new genera, such as ''[[Ahrensia]]'', ''[[Pseudorhodobacter]]'', ''[[Ruegeria]]'', and ''[[Stappia]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Uchino Y, Yokota A, Sugiyama J | title = Phylogenetic position of the marine subdivision of Agrobacterium species based on 16S rRNA sequence analysis | journal = The Journal of General and Applied Microbiology | volume = 43 | issue = 4 | pages = 243–247 | date = August 1997 | pmid = 12501326 | doi = 10.2323/jgam.43.243 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Uchino Y, Hirata A, Yokota A, Sugiyama J | title = Reclassification of marine Agrobacterium species: Proposals of Stappia stellulata gen. nov., comb. nov., Stappia aggregata sp. nov., nom. rev., Ruegeria atlantica gen. nov., comb. nov., Ruegeria gelatinovora comb. nov., Ruegeria algicola comb. nov., and Ahrensia kieliense gen. nov., sp. nov., nom. rev | journal = The Journal of General and Applied Microbiology | volume = 44 | issue = 3 | pages = 201–210 | date = June 1998 | pmid = 12501429 | doi = 10.2323/jgam.44.201 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but most species have been controversially reclassified as ''[[Rhizobium]]'' species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Young JM, Kuykendall LD, Martínez-Romero E, Kerr A, Sawada H | title = A revision of Rhizobium Frank 1889, with an emended description of the genus, and the inclusion of all species of Agrobacterium Conn 1942 and Allorhizobium undicola de Lajudie et al. 1998 as new combinations: Rhizobium radiobacter, R. rhizogenes, R. rubi, R. undicola and R. vitis | journal = International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology | volume = 51 | issue = Pt 1 | pages = 89–103 | date = January 2001 | pmid = 11211278 | doi = 10.1099/00207713-51-1-89 | url = http://ijs.sgmjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11211278 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Farrand SK, Van Berkum PB, Oger P | title = Agrobacterium is a definable genus of the family Rhizobiaceae | journal = International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology | volume = 53 | issue = Pt 5 | pages = 1681–7 | date = September 2003 | pmid = 13130068 | doi = 10.1099/ijs.0.02445-0 | url = https://naldc.nal.usda.gov/naldc/download.xhtml?id=47956&amp;content=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Young JM, Kuykendall LD, Martínez-Romero E, Kerr A, Sawada H | title = Classification and nomenclature of Agrobacterium and Rhizobium | journal = International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology | volume = 53 | issue = Pt 5 | pages = 1689–95 | date = September 2003 | pmid = 13130069 | doi = 10.1099/ijs.0.02762-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plant pathogen==
[[File:Agrobacteriumgall.jpg|left|thumb|The large growths on these roots are [[gall]]s induced by ''Agrobacterium'' sp.]]
''Agrobacterium tumefaciens'' causes crown-gall disease in plants. The disease is characterised by a [[tumour]]-like growth or [[gall]] on the infected plant, often at the junction between the root and the shoot. Tumors are incited by the [[bacterial conjugation|conjugative]] transfer of a DNA segment ([[T-DNA]]) from the bacterial tumour-inducing (Ti) [[plasmid]]. The closely related species, ''Agrobacterium rhizogenes'', induces root tumors, and carries the distinct Ri (root-inducing) plasmid. Although the taxonomy of ''Agrobacterium'' is currently under revision it can be generalised that 3 biovars exist within the genus, ''Agrobacterium tumefaciens'', ''Agrobacterium rhizogenes'', and ''Agrobacterium vitis''. Strains within ''Agrobacterium tumefaciens'' and ''Agrobacterium rhizogenes'' are known to be able to harbour either a Ti or Ri-[[plasmid]], whilst strains of ''Agrobacterium vitis'', generally restricted to grapevines, can harbour a Ti-plasmid. Non-''Agrobacterium'' strains have been isolated from environmental samples which harbour a Ri-plasmid whilst laboratory studies have shown that non-''Agrobacterium'' strains can also harbour a Ti-plasmid. Some environmental strains of ''Agrobacterium'' possess neither a Ti nor Ri-plasmid. These strains are avirulent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sawada H, Ieki H, Oyaizu H, Matsumoto S | title = Proposal for rejection of Agrobacterium tumefaciens and revised descriptions for the genus Agrobacterium and for Agrobacterium radiobacter and Agrobacterium rhizogenes | journal = International Journal of Systematic Bacteriology | volume = 43 | issue = 4 | pages = 694–702 | date = October 1993 | pmid = 8240952 | doi = 10.1099/00207713-43-4-694 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plasmid T-DNA is integrated semi-randomly into the [[genome]] of the host cell,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Francis KE, Spiker S | title = Identification of Arabidopsis thaliana transformants without selection reveals a high occurrence of silenced T-DNA integrations | journal = The Plant Journal | volume = 41 | issue = 3 | pages = 464–77 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15659104 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-313X.2004.02312.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the tumor morphology genes on the T-DNA are expressed, causing the formation of a gall. The T-DNA carries genes for the biosynthetic enzymes for the production of unusual [[amino acid]]s, typically [[octopine]] or [[nopaline]]. It also carries genes for the biosynthesis of the [[plant hormones]], [[auxin]] and [[cytokinins]], and for the biosynthesis of [[opines]], providing a carbon and nitrogen source for the bacteria that most other micro-organisms can't use, giving ''Agrobacterium'' a [[Selection (biology)|selective advantage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pitzschke A, Hirt H | title = New insights into an old story: Agrobacterium-induced tumour formation in plants by plant transformation | journal = The EMBO Journal | volume = 29 | issue = 6 | pages = 1021–32 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20150897 | pmc = 2845280 | doi = 10.1038/emboj.2010.8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By altering the hormone balance in the plant cell, the division of those cells cannot be controlled by the plant, and tumors form. The ratio of auxin to cytokinin produced by the tumor genes determines the morphology of the tumor (root-like, disorganized or shoot-like).

==In humans==
Although generally seen as an infection in plants, ''Agrobacterium'' can be responsible for [[opportunistic infection]]s in humans with weakened [[immune system]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hulse M, Johnson S, Ferrieri P | title = Agrobacterium infections in humans: experience at one hospital and review | journal = Clinical Infectious Diseases | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 112–7 | date = January 1993 | pmid = 8448285 | doi = 10.1093/clinids/16.1.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dunne WM, Tillman J, Murray JC | title = Recovery of a strain of Agrobacterium radiobacter with a mucoid phenotype from an immunocompromised child with bacteremia | journal = Journal of Clinical Microbiology | volume = 31 | issue = 9 | pages = 2541–3 | date = September 1993 | pmid = 8408587 | pmc = 265809 | url = http://jcm.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=8408587 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but has not been shown to be a primary pathogen in otherwise healthy individuals. One of the earliest associations of human disease caused by ''Agrobacterium radiobacter'' was reported by Dr. J. R. Cain in Scotland (1988).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cain JR | title = A case of septicaemia caused by Agrobacterium radiobacter | journal = The Journal of Infection | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = 205–6 | date = March 1988 | pmid = 3351321 | doi = 10.1016/s0163-4453(88)94272-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A later study suggested that ''Agrobacterium'' attaches to and genetically transforms several types of human cells by integrating its T-DNA into the human cell genome. The study was conducted using cultured human tissue and did not draw any conclusions regarding related biological activity in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kunik T, Tzfira T, Kapulnik Y, Gafni Y, Dingwall C, Citovsky V | title = Genetic transformation of HeLa cells by Agrobacterium | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 98 | issue = 4 | pages = 1871–6 | date = February 2001 | pmid = 11172043 | pmc = 29349 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.041327598 | bibcode = 2001PNAS...98.1871K | jstor = 3054968 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses in biotechnology==
{{see also|horizontal gene transfer}}
The ability of ''Agrobacterium'' to transfer [[gene]]s to [[plant]]s and fungi is used in [[biotechnology]], in particular, [[genetic engineering]] for [[plant improvement]]. A modified Ti or Ri plasmid can be used. The plasmid is 'disarmed' by deletion of the tumor inducing genes; the only essential parts of the T-DNA are its two small (25 base pair) border repeats, at least one of which is needed for plant transformation.&lt;ref name=Montagu1977/&gt;&lt;ref name=Joos1983/&gt; The genes to be introduced into the plant are cloned into a [[plant transformation vector]] that contains the T-DNA region of the disarmed [[plasmid]], together with a selectable marker (such as [[antimicrobial resistance|antibiotic resistance]]) to enable selection for plants that have been successfully transformed. Plants are grown on media containing antibiotic following transformation, and those that do not have the T-DNA integrated into their genome will die. An alternative method is [[agroinfiltration]].&lt;ref name=Thomson&gt;{{cite journal|title=Genetic Engineering of Plants |volume=3 |journal=Biotechnology |author=Thomson JA |url=http://www.eolss.net/sample-chapters/c17/e6-58-03-04.pdf |access-date=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Leuzinger K, Dent M, Hurtado J, Stahnke J, Lai H, Zhou X, Chen Q | title = Efficient agroinfiltration of plants for high-level transient expression of recombinant proteins | journal = Journal of Visualized Experiments | volume = 77 | issue = 77 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23913006 | pmc = 3846102 | doi = 10.3791/50521 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Transformation with Agrobacterium.JPG|thumb|right|Plant (''[[Solanum|S. chacoense]]'') transformed using ''Agrobacterium''. Transformed cells start forming calluses on the side of the leaf pieces]]
[[Transformation (genetics)|Transformation]] with ''Agrobacterium'' can be achieved in multiple ways. [[Protoplast]]s or alternatively leaf-discs can be incubated with the ''Agrobacterium'' and whole plants regenerated using [[plant tissue culture]]. In [[agroinfiltration]] the ''Agrobacterium'' may be injected directly into the leaf tissue of a plant. This method transforms only cells in immediate contact with the bacteria, and results in transient expression of plasmid DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shamloul M, Trusa J, Mett V, Yusibov V | title = Optimization and utilization of Agrobacterium-mediated transient protein production in Nicotiana | journal = Journal of Visualized Experiments | issue = 86 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24796351 | pmc = 4174718 | doi = 10.3791/51204 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agroinfiltration is commonly used to transform tobacco (''[[Nicotiana]]''). A common transformation protocol for ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana|Arabidopsis]]'' is the floral dip method:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Clough SJ, Bent AF | title = Floral dip: a simplified method for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of Arabidopsis thaliana | journal = The Plant Journal | volume = 16 | issue = 6 | pages = 735–43 | date = December 1998 | pmid = 10069079 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-313x.1998.00343.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[inflorescence]] are dipped in a suspension of ''Agrobacterium'', and the bacterium transforms the [[germline]] cells that make the female [[gametes]]. The [[seed]]s can then be screened for antibiotic resistance (or another marker of interest), and plants that have not integrated the plasmid DNA will die when exposed to the correct condition of antibiotic.&lt;ref name="Thomson" /&gt;

''Agrobacterium'' does not infect all plant species, but there are several other effective techniques for plant transformation including the [[gene gun]].

''Agrobacterium'' is listed as being the vector of genetic material that was transferred to these USA GMOs:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/biocon.html#list The FDA List of Completed Consultations on Bioengineered Foods] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513162330/http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/biocon.html#list |date=May 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genomics==
The sequencing of the [[genome]]s of several species of ''Agrobacterium'' has permitted the study of the evolutionary history of these organisms and has provided information on the [[gene]]s and systems involved in pathogenesis, biological control and [[symbiosis]]. One important finding is the possibility that [[chromosome]]s are evolving from [[plasmid]]s in many of these bacteria. Another discovery is that the diverse chromosomal structures in this group appear to be capable of supporting both symbiotic and pathogenic lifestyles. The availability of the genome sequences of ''Agrobacterium'' species will continue to increase, resulting in substantial insights into the function and evolutionary history of this group of plant-associated microbes.&lt;ref name= SetubalJC&gt;{{cite book |first1=Joao C. |last1=Setubal |first2=Derek |last2=Wood |first3=Thomas |last3=Burr |first4=Stephen K. |last4=Farrand |first5=Barry S. |last5=Goldman |first6=Brad |last6=Goodner |first7=Leon |last7=Otten |first8=Steven |last8=Slater | name-list-format = vanc |year=2009 |chapter=The Genomics of ''Agrobacterium'': Insights into its Pathogenicity, Biocontrol, and Evolution |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=3nySn5qljjMC&amp;pg=PA91 |pages=91–112 |editor1-first=Robert W. |editor1-last=Jackson |title=Plant Pathogenic Bacteria: Genomics and Molecular Biology |publisher=Caister Academic Press |isbn=978-1-904455-37-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Marc Van Montagu]] and [[Jozef Schell]] at the [[University of Ghent]] ([[Belgium]]) discovered the gene transfer mechanism between ''Agrobacterium'' and plants, which resulted in the development of methods to alter ''Agrobacterium'' into an efficient delivery system for gene engineering in plants.&lt;ref name=Montagu1977&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-1-4684-0880-5_12 |pmid=336023 |chapter=The Ti-Plasmid of Agrobacterium Tumefaciens, A Natural Vector for the Introduction of NIF Genes in Plants? |title=Genetic Engineering for Nitrogen Fixation |series=Basic Life Sciences |volume=9 |pages=159–79 |year=1977 |last1=Schell |first1=J. |last2=Van Montagu |first2=M. |isbn=978-1-4684-0882-9 |editor1-first=Alexander |editor1-last=Hollaender |editor2-first=R.

A '''bog body''' is a human cadaver that has been naturally [[mummification|mummified]] in a [[peat bog]]. Such bodies, sometimes known as '''bog people''', are both geographically and chronologically widespread, having been dated to between 8000 BCE and the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref name="Fischer 237"&gt;[[#Fis98|Fischer 1998]]. p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; The unifying factor of the bog bodies is that they have been found in peat and are partially preserved; however, the actual levels of preservation vary widely from perfectly preserved to mere skeletons.&lt;ref name="VanDerSanden 7"&gt;[[#San96|Van der Sanden 1996]]. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike most ancient human remains, bog bodies often retain their skin and internal [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] due to the unusual conditions of the surrounding area. These conditions include highly [[acid]]ic [[water]], low [[temperature]], and a lack of [[oxygen]] which combine to preserve but severely [[Tanning (leather)|tan]] their skin. While the skin is well-preserved, the bones are generally not, due to the acid in the peat having dissolved the [[calcium phosphate]] of bone.

The oldest known bog body is the skeleton of [[Koelbjerg Man]] from Denmark, who has been dated to 8000 BCE, during the [[Mesolithic]] period.&lt;ref name="Fischer 237"/&gt; The oldest fleshed bog body is that of [[Cashel Man]], who dates to 2000 BCE during the Bronze Age.&lt;ref name=kings /&gt; The overwhelming majority of bog bodies &amp;ndash; including examples such as [[Tollund Man]], [[Grauballe Man]] and [[Lindow Man]] &amp;ndash; date to the [[Iron Age]] and have been found in northwest European lands, particularly [[Denmark]], [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]] and the [[British Isles]]. Such Iron Age bog bodies typically illustrate a number of similarities, such as violent deaths and a lack of clothing, leading archaeologists to believe that they were killed and deposited in the bogs as a part of a widespread cultural tradition of [[human sacrifice]] or the execution of criminals.&lt;ref name="Fischer 237"/&gt; The newest bog bodies are those of soldiers killed in the Russian wetlands during the Second World War.&lt;ref name="Fischer 237"/&gt;

The German scientist [[Alfred Dieck]] published a catalog of more than 1,850 bog bodies that he had counted between 1939 and 1986&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dieck |first1=Alfred |authorlink1=Alfred Dieck |title=Die europäischen Moorleichenfunde (Hominidenmoorfunde) |year=1965 |publisher=Wachholtz |location=Neumünster |language=German |pages=136pp}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Glob_101"&gt;{{Cite book | last =Glob | first =Peter Vilhelm | authorlink =Peter Glob | coauthors = | title =The Bog People: Iron Age Man Preserved | publisher =Faber and Faber | year =1969 | location =London | pages =101 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; but most were unverified by documents or archaeological finds;&lt;ref name="Eisenbeiß"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Eisenbeiß |first1=Sabine |title=Bog-bodies in Lower Saxony - rumours and facts: an analysis of Alfred Dieck's sources of information |editor1-first=Andreas |editor1-last=Bauerochse |series=Peatlands: archaeological sites, archives of nature, nature conservation, wise use; proceedings of the Peatland Conference 2002 in Hannover, Germany |year=2003 |publisher=Leidorf |location=Rhaden/Westf. |isbn=3-89646-026-9 |pages= 143–150}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 2002 analysis of Dieck's work by German archaeologists concluded that much of his work was unreliable.&lt;ref name="Eisenbeiß"/&gt;

== Bog chemistry ==
[[File:Raselink.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sphagnum moss]], which aids in the preservation of bog bodies]]
The preservation of bog bodies in peat bogs is a natural phenomenon, and not the result of human mummification processes.&lt;ref name="Fischer 237"/&gt; It is caused by the unique physical and biochemical composition of the bogs.&lt;ref name="Fischer 238"&gt;[[#Fis98|Fischer 1998]]. p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; Different types of bogs can affect the mummification process differently: raised bogs best preserve the corpses, whereas fens and transitional bogs tend to preserve harder tissues such as the skeleton rather than the soft tissue.&lt;ref name="Fischer 238"/&gt;

A limited number of bogs have the correct conditions for preservation of mammalian tissue. Most of these are located in colder climates near bodies of salt water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last =Dente | first =Jenny | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Bog Bodies: Reluctant Time Travelers | publisher =University of Texas | year =2005 | location =El Paso | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the area of [[Denmark]] where the [[Haraldskær Woman]] was recovered, salt air from the North Sea blows across the Jutland wetlands and provides an ideal environment for the growth of [[peat]].&lt;ref name="lib"&gt;Silkeborg Museum {{cite web |url=http://www.tollundman.dk/bevaring-i-mosen.asp |title=The Tollund Man - Preservation in the bog |format= |work=Silkeborg Museum and Amtscentret for Undervisning, Aarhus Amt, 2004 |accessdate=2008-08-20}} pg=[http://www.tollundman.dk/bevaring-i-mosen.asp Tollundman.dk] {{dk icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; As new peat replaces the old peat, the older material underneath rots and releases [[humic acid]], also known as bog acid. The bog acids, with [[pH level]]s similar to vinegar, conserve the human bodies in the same way as fruit is preserved by [[pickling]].&lt;ref name="Tollundman.dk"&gt;{{Harv|Silkeborg Museum|2004|p=[http://www.tollundman.dk/bevaring-i-mosen.asp Tollundman.dk]}} {{dk icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, peat bogs form in areas lacking drainage and hence are characterized by almost completely [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anaerobic]] conditions. This environment, highly acidic and devoid of oxygen, denies the prevalent subsurface [[aerobic organisms]] any opportunity to initiate [[decomposition]]. Researchers discovered that conservation also required that they place the body in the bog during the winter or early spring when the water temperature is cold—i.e., less than 4&amp;nbsp;°C (40&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref name="Tollundman.dk"/&gt; This allows bog acids to saturate the tissues before decay can begin. Bacteria are unable to grow rapidly enough for decomposition at temperatures under 4&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="Tollundman.dk"/&gt;

The bog chemical environment involves a completely saturated acidic environment, where considerable concentrations of organic acids and aldehydes are present. Layers of sphagnum and peat assist in preserving the cadavers by enveloping the tissue in a cold immobilizing matrix, impeding water circulation and any oxygenation. An additional feature of anaerobic preservation by acidic bogs is the ability to conserve hair, clothing and leather items. Modern experimenters have been able to mimic bog conditions in the laboratory and successfully demonstrate the preservation process, albeit over shorter time frames than the 2,500 years that Haraldskær Woman's body has survived. Most of the bog bodies discovered showed some aspects of decay or else were not properly conserved. When such specimens are exposed to the normal atmosphere, they may begin to decompose rapidly. As a result, many specimens have been effectively destroyed. As of 1979, the number of specimens that have been preserved following discovery was 53.&lt;ref&gt;Gill-Frerking, Heather.

==Historical context==

===Mesolithic to Bronze Age===
The oldest bog body that has been identified is the [[Koelbjerg Man]] from Denmark, who has been dated to 8000 BCE, during the [[Mesolithic]] period.&lt;ref name="Fischer 237"/&gt;

Around 3900 BCE,&lt;ref&gt;Official Danish history @http://denmark.dk/en/society/history/&lt;/ref&gt; agriculture was introduced to Denmark, either through cultural exchange or by migrating farmers, marking the beginning of the Neolithic in the region.&lt;ref name="Bennike 27"&gt;[[#Ben99|Bennike 1999]]. p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; It was during the early part of this Neolithic period that a number of human corpses that were interred in the area's peat bogs left evidence that there had been resistance to its introduction.&lt;ref name="Bennike 29"&gt;[[#Ben99|Bennike 1999]]. p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; A disproportionate number of the Early Neolithic bodies found in Danish bogs were aged between 16 and 20 at the time of their death and deposition, and suggestions have been put forward that they were either [[human sacrifices]] or criminals executed for their socially deviant behaviour.&lt;ref name="Bennike 29"/&gt; An example of a Bronze Age bog body is [[Cashel Man]], from 2000 BCE.&lt;ref name=kings /&gt;

===Iron Age===
[[File:Windeby_I_upper-body.jpg|thumb|left|[[Windeby I]], the body of a teenage boy, found in Schleswig, Germany]]
The vast majority of the bog bodies that have been discovered date from the [[Iron Age]], a period of time when peat bogs covered a much larger area of northern Europe. Many of these Iron Age bodies bear a number of similarities, indicating a known cultural tradition of killing and depositing these people in a certain manner. These [[Pre-Roman Iron Age]] peoples lived in sedentary communities, who had built villages, and whose society was hierarchical. They were [[agriculture|agriculturalists]], raising animals in captivity as well as growing crops. In some parts of northern Europe, they also [[fishing|hunted fish]]. Although independent of the [[Roman Empire]], which dominated southern Europe at this time, the inhabitants traded with the Romans.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Glo69|Glob 1969]]. pp. 121&amp;ndash;125.&lt;/ref&gt;

For these people, the bogs held some sort of liminal significance, and indeed, they placed into them [[votive offering]]s intended for the Other world, often of [[Torc|neck-rings]], wristlets or ankle-rings made of [[bronze]] or more rarely [[gold]]. The archaeologist [[P.V. Glob]] believed that these were "offerings to the gods of fertility and good fortune."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last =Glob | first =Peter Vilhelm | authorlink =Peter Glob | coauthors = | title =The Bog People: Iron Age Man Preserved | publisher =Faber and Faber | year =1969 | location =London | pages =136 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore widely speculated that the Iron Age bog bodies were thrown into the bog for similar reasons, and that they were therefore examples of [[human sacrifice]] to the gods.&lt;ref&gt;Vergano, Dan. "Bog bodies baffle scientists." USA Today. Ed. John Hillkirk. N.p., n.d. Web. 14 Dec. 2011. [https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/columnist/vergano/2011-01-16-bog-bodies_N.htm].&lt;/ref&gt; Explicit reference to the practice of drowning slaves who had washed the [[cult image]] of [[Nerthus]] and were subsequently ritually drowned in Tacitus' ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'' XC, suggesting that the bog bodies were sacrificial victims may be contrasted with a separate account (''Germania'' XII), in which victims of punitive execution were pinned in bogs using hurdles.&lt;ref&gt;Miranda Green, [http://www.ffzg.unizg.hr/arheo/ska/tekstovi/ritual_victims.pdf "Humans as Ritual Victims in the Later Prehistory of Western Europe], ''Oxford Journal of Archaeology'', 1998 Vol 17; No. 2, pp 169–190, esp. pp 177, 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many bog bodies show signs of being [[Stabbing|stabbed]], [[bludgeon (weapon)|bludgeoned]], [[hanged]] or [[strangle]]d, or a combination of these methods. In some cases the individual had been beheaded. In the case of the [[Osterby Man]] found at Kohlmoor, near [[Osterby, Rendsburg-Eckernförde|Osterby]], Germany in 1948, the head had been deposited in the bog without its body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last =Glob | first =Peter Vilhelm | authorlink =Peter Glob | coauthors = | title =The Bog People: Iron Age Man Preserved | publisher =Faber and Faber | year =1969 | location =London | pages =116–117 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually the corpses were naked, sometimes with some items of clothing with them, particularly headgear. The clothing is believed to have decomposed while in the bog for so long.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last =Glob | first =Peter Vilhelm | authorlink =Peter Glob | coauthors = | title =The Bog People: Iron Age Man Preserved | publisher =Faber and Faber | year =1969 | location =London | pages =107 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a number of cases, twigs, sticks or stones were placed on top of the body, sometimes in a cross formation, and at other times, forked sticks had been driven into the peat to hold the corpse down. According to the archaeologist [[P.V. Glob]], "this probably indicates the wish to pin the dead man firmly into the bog."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last =Glob | first =Peter Vilhelm | authorlink =Peter Glob | coauthors = | title =The Bog People: Iron Age Man Preserved | publisher =Faber and Faber | year =1969 | location =London | pages =105 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some bodies show signs of torture, such as [[Old Croghan Man]], who had deep cuts beneath his nipples.

Some bog bodies, such as [[Tollund Man]] from Denmark, have been found with the rope used to strangle them still around their necks. Some, such as the [[Yde Girl]] in the Netherlands and bog bodies in Ireland, had the hair on one side of their heads closely cropped, although this could be due to one side of their head being exposed to oxygen for a longer period of time than the other. Some of the bog bodies seem consistently to have been members of the upper class: their fingernails are manicured, and tests on hair protein routinely record good nutrition. [[Strabo]] records that the Celts practiced [[auguries]] on the entrails of human victims: on some bog bodies, such as the [[Weerdinge Men]] found in the northern Netherlands, the entrails have been partly drawn out through incisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mummytombs.com/bog/weerdinge.htm Deem, James M. Mummytombs.com. N.p., n.d. Web. 21 Nov. 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402125838/http://www.mummytombs.com/bog/weerdinge.htm |date=2010-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern techniques of forensic analysis now suggest that some injuries, such as broken bones and crushed skulls, were not the result of torture, but rather due to the weight of the bog.&lt;ref name="Lange"&gt;Karen E. Lange, [http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2007/09/bog-bodies/bog-bodies-text.html "Tales from the Bog"], ''National Geographic'', September 2007, retrieved 23-04-2009&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the fractured skull of [[Grauballe Man]] was at one time thought to have been caused by a blow to the head. However, a [[CT scan]] of Grauballe Man by Danish scientists determined his skull was fractured due to pressure from the bog long after his death.&lt;ref name="Lange"/&gt;

===Medieval to Modern periods===
Amongst the most recent, the corpse of [[List of bog bodies#Meenybradden Woman|Meenybradden Woman]] found in Ireland dates to the 16th century and was found in unhallowed ground, with evidence indicating that she may have committed suicide and was therefore buried in the bog rather than in the churchyard because she had committed a Christian [[sin]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} She may have also been unable to afford proper burial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipcc.ie/infobogbodies.html Irish Peatland Conservation Council - information sheets - Bog Bodies&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110626011912/http://www.ipcc.ie/infobogbodies.html |date=2011-06-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bog bodies have also formed from the corpses of Russian and German soldiers killed fighting on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] during the [[First World War]] in the [[Masurian Lake District]] region of north-eastern [[Poland]].&lt;ref name="Glob_101" /&gt;

===North America===
A number of skeletons found in Florida have been called "bog people". These skeletons are the remains of people buried in peat between 5,000 and 8,000 years ago, during the Early and Middle [[Archaic period in the Americas]]. The peat at the Florida sites is loosely consolidated, and much wetter than in European bogs. As a result, the skeletons are well preserved, but skin and most internal organs have not been preserved. An exception is that preserved brains have been found in nearly 100 skulls at [[Windover Archaeological Site]] and in one of several burials at [[Little Salt Spring]]. Textiles were also preserved with some of the burials, the oldest known textiles in Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tyson|first=Peter|title=America's Bog People|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/americas-bog-people.html|work=[[Nova (TV series)|NOVA]]|publisher=Public Broadcasting Service|accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Milanich|first=Jerald T.|title=Archaeology of Precolumbian Florida|year=1994|publisher=University Press of Florida|location=Gainesville, Florida|isbn=0-8130-1272-4|pages=70–75|authorlink=Jerald T.

Ever since the Iron Age, humans have used the bogs to harvest [[peat]], a common fuel source. On various occasions throughout history, peat diggers have come across bog bodies. Records of such finds go back as far as the 17th century, and in 1640 a bog body was discovered at Shalkholz Fen in [[Holstein]], Germany. This was possibly the first ever such discovery recorded. The first more fully documented account of discovery of a bog body was at a peat bog on Drumkeragh Mountain in [[County Down]], [[Ireland]]; it was published by [[Elizabeth Rawdon, Countess of Moira]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Countess of Moira | first = Elizabeth Rawdon | author-link = Elizabeth Rawdon, Countess of Moira | title = Particulars relative to a Human Skeleton, and the Garments that were found thereon, when dug out of a Bog at the Foot of Drumkeragh, a Mountain in the County of Down, and Barony of Kinalearty, on Lord Moira's Estate, in the Autumn of 1780 | publisher = The Society of Antiquaries of London | journal = Archaeologia | volume = 7 | pages = 90–110 | year = 1785 | doi = 10.1017/S0261340900022281 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the wife of the local landowner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last =Glob | first =Peter Vilhelm | authorlink =Peter Glob | coauthors = | title =The Bog People: Iron Age Man Preserved | publisher =Faber and Faber | year =1969 | location =London | pages =103 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such reports continued into the 18th century: for instance, a body was reportedly found on the Danish island of [[Fyn]] in 1773,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last =Glob | first =Peter Vilhelm | authorlink =Peter Glob | coauthors = | title =The Bog People: Iron Age Man Preserved | publisher =Faber and Faber | year =1969 | location =London | pages =65–66 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; whilst the Kibbelgaarn body was discovered in the Netherlands in 1791. Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, when such bodies were discovered, they were often removed from the bogs and given a [[Christianity|Christian]] burial on consecrated church ground in keeping with the religious beliefs of the community who found them, who often assumed that they were relatively modern.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last =Glob | first =Peter Vilhelm | authorlink =Peter Glob | coauthors = | title =The Bog People: Iron Age Man Preserved | publisher =Faber and Faber | year =1969 | location =London | pages =63 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the rise of [[antiquarianism]] in the 19th century, some people began to speculate that many of the bog bodies were not recent murder victims but were ancient in origin. In 1843, at Corselitze on [[Falster]] in Denmark, a bog body unusually buried with ornaments (seven glass beads and a bronze pin) was unearthed and subsequently given a Christian burial. By order of the [[Frederick VII of Denmark|Crown Prince Frederick]], who was an antiquarian, the body was dug up again and sent to the [[National Museum of Denmark]]. According to the archaeologist P.V. Glob, it was "he, more than anyone else, [who] helped to arouse the wide interest in Danish antiquities" such as the bog bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last =Glob | first =Peter Vilhelm | authorlink =Peter Glob | coauthors = | title =The Bog People: Iron Age Man Preserved | publisher =Faber and Faber | year =1969 | location =London | pages =68–69 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Haraldskær Woman]] was unearthed in Denmark, she was exhibited as having been the legendary [[Gunnhild, Mother of Kings|Queen Gunhild]] of the early Mediaeval period. This view was disputed by the [[archaeologist]] [[J. J. A. Worsaae]], who argued that the body was Iron Age in origin, like most bog bodies, and predated any historical persons by at least 500 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last =Glob | first =Peter Vilhelm | authorlink =Peter Glob | coauthors = | title =The Bog People: Iron Age Man Preserved | publisher =Faber and Faber | year =1969 | location =London | pages =69–73 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first bog body that was photographed was the Iron Age [[Rendswühren Man]], discovered in 1871, at the Heidmoor Fen, near Kiel in Germany. His body was subsequently smoked as an early attempt at [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]] and put on display in a museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last =Glob | first =Peter Vilhelm | authorlink =Peter Glob | coauthors = | title =The Bog People: Iron Age Man Preserved | publisher =Faber and Faber | year =1969 | location =London | pages =106–107 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
With the rise of [[modern archaeology]] in the early 20th Century, archeologists began to excavate and investigate bog bodies more carefully and thoroughly.

===Archaeological techniques===

Until the mid-20th century, it was not readily apparent at the time of discovery whether a body had been buried in a bog for years, decades, or centuries. But, modern forensic and medical technologies (such as [[radiocarbon dating]]) have been developed that allow researchers to more closely determine the age of the burial, the person's age at death, and other details. Scientists have been able to study the skin of the bog bodies, reconstruct their appearance and even determine what their last meal was from their stomach contents, since peat marsh preserves soft internal tissue. Their teeth also indicate their age at death and what type of food they ate throughout their lifetime.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} [[Ground penetrating radar survey (archaeology)|Subsurface radar]] can be used by archaeologists to detect bodies and artifacts beneath the bog surface before cutting into the peat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Christopher | last=Chippindale | title=Flag Fen: New Finds from the Bronze Age | journal= New Scientist | issue=1462| date=27 June 1985 | pages=39–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radiocarbon dating is also common as it accurately gives the date of the find, most usually from the Iron Age.

[[Forensic facial reconstruction]] is one particularly impressive technique used in studying the bog bodies. Originally designed for identifying modern faces in crime investigations, this technique is a way of working out the facial features of a person by the shape of their skull. The face of one bog body, [[Yde Girl]], was reconstructed in 1992 by [[Richard Neave]] of [[Manchester University]] using CT scans of her head. Yde Girl and her modern reconstruction are displayed at the [[Drents Museum]] in [[Assen]]. Such reconstructions have also been made of the heads of [[Lindow Man]] (British Museum, London, United Kingdom), [[Grauballe Man]], [[Girl of the Uchter Moor]], [[Clonycavan Man]], [[Roter Franz]] and [[Windeby I]].&lt;ref&gt;"Reconstructions."

==Notable bog bodies==
{{Main|List of bog bodies}}
Hundreds of bog bodies have been recovered and studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Karen E. | last=Lange | title=Tales From the Bog | journal=National Geographic | url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2007/09/bog-bodies/bog-bodies-text.html | issue=September 2007 | year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bodies have been most commonly found in the [[Northern Europe]]an countries of Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Ireland. In 1965, the German scientist [[Alfred Dieck]] cataloged more than 1,850 bog bodies, but later scholarship revealed much of the Dieck's work was erroneous, and an exact number of discovered bodies is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Van Der Sanden | first1=Wijnand | authorlink = Wijnand van der Sanden | last2=Eisenbess | first2= Sabine | title=Imaginary People | journal=Archäologisches Korrespondenzblatt | year=2006 | volume=36 | issue=1 | pages=111–122 | ISSN =0342-734X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several bog bodies are notable for the high quality of their preservation and the substantial research by archaeologists and forensic scientists. These include:
* [[Bocksten Man]], a modern body from 1290–1430 CE, found in 1936 in [[Varberg Municipality|Varberg]], Sweden.
* [[Borremose Bodies]], from 400–700 BCE, found in the 1940s in [[Himmerland]], Denmark.
* [[Cashel Man]], from 2000 BCE, discovered in 2011 in [[County Laois]], Ireland. It is the oldest fleshed bog body in the world.&lt;ref name= kings&gt;Hart, Edward, dir. "Ghosts of Murdered Kings." NOVA. Prod. Edward Hart and Dan McCabe. PBS. 29 Jan. 2014. Television.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Cladh Hallan]] mummies, from 1600–1300 BCE, found on the island of [[South Uist]], Scotland.
* [[Clonycavan Man]], from 392–201 BCE, found in 2003 in [[County Meath]], Ireland
* [[Girl of the Uchter Moor]], from between 764 and 515 BCE, found in 2000 in [[Uchte]], Germany.
* [[Grauballe Man]], from 290 BCE, found in 1952 in [[Jutland]], Denmark.
* [[Haraldskær Woman]], from 490 BCE, found in 1835 in Jutland, Denmark.
* [[Lindow Man]], from 2 BCE–119 CE, found in 1984 in [[Cheshire]], England.
* [[Old Croghan Man]], from 362–175 BCE, found in 2003 [[County Offaly]], Ireland.&lt;ref name="Dash"&gt;Mike Dash, "The bodies in the bogs." [https://mikedashhistory.com/2016/09/04/the-bodies-in-the-bogs// A Blast From the Past, 4 September 2016.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Tollund Man]], from 400 BCE, found in 1950 in Jutland, Denmark.
* [[Weerdinge Men]], from 160–220 BCE, found in [[Drenthe]], Netherlands in 1904.
* [[Windeby I]], found in 1952 in [[Schleswig-Holstein]], Germany.
* [[Yde Girl]], 170 BCE–230 CE, found in 1897 near [[Yde]], Netherlands.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2507">A '''cervical mucus plug''' ('''operculum''') is a plug that fills and seals the [[Canal of the cervix|cervical canal]] during pregnancy. It is formed by a small amount of cervical [[mucus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mucus Plug|url=http://pregnancy.emedtv.com/mucus-plug/mucus-plug.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mucus plug&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= 10 Facts You Should Know About a Mucus Plug |url=http://www.mucusplug.net/}}&lt;/ref&gt; acts as a protective barrier by deterring the passage of [[bacteria]] into the [[uterus]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://parenting.ivillage.com/pregnancy/plabor/0,,3pv4,00.html Mucus Plug: Information and overview at iVillage Pregnancy &amp;amp; Parenting]&lt;/ref&gt; and contains a variety of antimicrobial agents, including [[immunoglobulin]]s, and similar [[antimicrobial peptides]] to those found in [[nasal mucus]].&lt;ref name="The Cervix"&gt;{{cite book|title=The cervix|year=2006|publisher=Blackwell|location=Malden, Mass.|isbn=9781444312751|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gbp2uRBLE9cC&amp;pg=PA163|edition=2nd|editor1=Joseph Jordan |editor2=Albert Singer |editor3=Howard Jones |editor4=Mahmood Shafi |accessdate=21 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Normally during human [[pregnancy]], the mucus is cloudy, clear, thick, and sticky. Toward the end of the pregnancy, when the cervix thins, some blood is released into the cervix which causes the mucus to become bloody. As the woman gets closer to labor, the mucus plug discharges as the cervix begins to dilate. The plug may come out as a plug, a lump, or simply as increased vaginal discharge over several days. The mucus may be tinged with brown, pink, or red blood, which is why the event is sometimes referred to as "bloody show". Loss of the mucus plug by no means implies that delivery or labor is imminent. If there is any red or green-yellow discharge, your physician should know about it.

Normally, there shouldn’t be any foul odors, because they characterize unwanted infections. Pay attention to greenish discharge color, because it can indicate fetal hypoxia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mucus-plug.com|title=What is Mucus (Mocous) Plug|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having [[Sexual intercourse|intercourse]] or a [[vaginal examination]] can also disturb the mucus plug and cause a woman to see some blood-tinged discharge, even when labor does not begin over the next few days.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.babycenter.com/0_signs-of-labor_181.bc Signs of labor - BabyCenter]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Albone was born in [[Hong Kong]], his father was a flight engineer and his mother was a flight attendant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brain|first1=Anna|title=From Selling Houses to smelling roses, Charlie's Chelsea Garden is a winner for landscape designer, Charlie Albone|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/television/from-selling-houses-to-smelling-roses-charlies-chelsea-garden-is-a-winner-for-landscape-designer-charlie-albone/story-fni0cc2c-1227493221784|accessdate=22 August 2015|work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]|date=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of twelve he moved to the [[United Kingdom]] and developed an interest in gardening and landscaping.&lt;ref name="BorderMail"&gt;{{cite news|last=Thomson|first=Owen|title=Star and car: Charlie Albone|url=http://www.bordermail.com.au/story/1413700/star-and-car-charlie-albone/|accessdate=20 January 2014|newspaper=[[The Border Mail]]|date=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few years later he began working maintaining the grounds of an English country manor, with no formal qualifications, Albone learnt his trade on the job and worked for many UK landscaping companies before travelling to [[Australia]] on a working holiday.

After the discovery, the police started a large-scale search of the forest which took five weeks.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The police uncovered an almost entire skeleton of a human male.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://missingpersons.police.uk/en-gb/case/15-006991|title=Case 15-006991|last=|first=|date=|website=UK Missing Persons Unit|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the skeleton was discovered beneath in dense trees and undergrowth a few meters away from the location of the skull.&lt;ref&gt;Crimewatch 26/09/2016 10m30s&lt;/ref&gt; The remains were removed two days after the discovery and taken away to be examined by a pathologist.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; A DNA profile was extracted from the skeleton.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; No match was found in the [[United Kingdom National DNA Database|UK national DNA database]] or the [http://missingpersons.police.uk/en-gb/home UK Missing Persons Unit].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Biologists and forensic anthropologists gathered samples and evidence from the undergrowth in an attempt to date the body.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A pathological investigation indicated that the man died from a blunt trauma to the head.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/cerrigydrudion-forest-body-murder-case-12052804|title=Police continue to follow up 60 calls in Cerrigydrudion forest body murder case|last=Williams|first=Kelly|date=2016-10-20|work=northwales|access-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police established that it was likely that the man was murdered in an unknown location between 2004 and 2010 and the body dumped in location where it was found.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Description of the victim==
It is likely that the man would have been  born before 1950 and aged over 54 at the time of his death and most likely in his 60s. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He would have been 'well built' in life and would have had a height of between 5ft 8in and 5ft 10.5in (1.73-1.78m).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-41775570|title=Appeal to rally fans over murdered man|last=Staff|first=|date=27 October 2018|work=BBC News|access-date=11 September 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-north-west-wales-37478871|title=Crimewatch appeal over body in forest|last=Staff|first=|date=2016-09-26|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-09-13|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The victim had an injury to his spine, fused vertebrae, a broken nose and possible injury to his left wrist.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crimewatch 26/09/16 5m00s&lt;/ref&gt; He had [[arthritis]] and an inflammatory condition in his spine and other joints. In life, the victim would have experienced pain and reduced movement.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

The victim had lost a number of teeth during life which would have resulted in sunken cheeks.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; All the victims posterior [[Molar (tooth)|molar]] teeth were absent which suggests that he was not dentally aware early in his life however this appeared to be followed by a sudden change of circumstance due to extensive dental work of very high quality completed later in life.&lt;ref&gt;Crimewatch 26/09/2016 5m20s&lt;/ref&gt; Police stated that the victim had undergone two identifiable dental procedures in life.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-north-west-wales-36469559|title=Dentists' help appeal over forest body|last=Staff|first=|date=2016-06-07|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-09-13|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first was that the victim had a number of crowns to his front teeth,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; work which appeared to have been done in the UK between 1980 and 2000.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The second procedure was an uncommon procedure; a remedial filling to a temporary plastic [[Crown (dentistry)|crown]] which had been badly worn.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; John Rosie, a forensic [[odontologist]], stated that as the dental work was highly distinctive and involved specialist work it could allow a dentist to identify the victim.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Information regarding the victims dental work was published in dentistry journals by the police.&lt;ref&gt;Crimewatch 26/09/2016 6m00s&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some items of clothing were found near to the body but it could not be confirmed that they were associated with the victim. These items were; a dark-green [[Pringle of Scotland|Pringle]] jumper and some dark-red decomposed [[Marks &amp; Spencer|Marks and Spencer]] underwear.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The underwear was manufactured in 1999&lt;ref&gt;Crimewatch 26/09/2016 6m30s&lt;/ref&gt; and Pringle of Scotland confirmed that the jumper was produced between 2000 and 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.denbighshirefreepress.co.uk/news/15766506.Police_reveal_new_clues_in_pursuit_to_name_body_discovered_in_Clocaenog_Forest/|title=Police reveal new clues in pursuit to name body discovered in Clocaenog Forest|last=Staff|first=|date=|website=Denbighshire Free Press|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent investigations==
In June 2016 the police released a photograph of the victims jawbone in the hope that dentists may recognise their dental work and therefore identify the victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.itv.com/news/wales/2016-06-07/police-still-trying-to-identify-mans-body-found-six-months-ago/|title=Police in north Wales still trying to identify a skeleton found six months ago|last=Staff|first=|date=|work=ITV News|access-date=2018-09-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The police also announced that they were undertaking [[DNA profiling|familial DNA]] research.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

On 26 September 2016 police released images showing how the man could have looked when he was alive at the ages of 50, 60 and 70 on the [[BBC]] [[Crimewatch]] programme.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

in March 2017 the police confirmed that they had been contacted by, and met with, serial killer [[Peter Moore (serial killer)|Peter Moore]] following his claims that he knew the identity of Clocaenog Forest Man.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/killer-peter-moore-claims-know-12697411|title=Does Killer Peter Moore know identity of Clocaenog Forest murder victim?|last=Bagnall|first=Steve|date=2017-03-06|work=northwales|access-date=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter claimed in a letter that the victim was a mature student at [[Aberystwyth University]] who had disappeared in 1996.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  Moore did not disclose the victim's name but Daily Post journalists identified a [https://www.missingpeople.org.uk/help-us-find/roger-evans-96-000658 Roger Evans] of [[Bradeley]] near [[Stoke-on-Trent]] who disappeared 16 January 1996 aged 46 during his first year at Aberystwyth University.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Moore later stated that his theory had been discounted by the police due to conflicting dates.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; 

In October 2017 Police support officers and race marshals distributed leaflets to attendees of the [[2017 Wales Rally GB]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Colin Linwood Buchan''' (1890 – 16 April 1947) was a Scottish professional [[Association football|football]] [[outside left]] who played in the [[Scottish Football League|Scottish League]] for [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]].&lt;ref name="QPFC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qpfc.com/appearances/b/buchancl.htm|title=QPFC.com – A Historical Queen's Park FC Website|last=|first=|date=|website=www.qpfc.com|publisher=|accessdate=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McCrossan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.queensparkfc.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Appendix-2.pdf|title=The Queen's Park Men Who Served And Survived As At October 2016 – Appendix 2|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|page=4|accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sportnetwork"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.sportnetwork.net/main/s94/st2232.htm |title=1919–20 |last=readers |first=.net UK |accessdate=13 January 2017 |newspaper=Test}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Buchan was born in [[Bradford]], [[Yorkshire]],&lt;ref&gt;''England &amp; Wales, Civil Registration Birth Index, 1837-1915''&lt;/ref&gt; to Scottish parents James Buchan of [[Hawick]], [[Roxburghshire]] and Mary Jane Buchan of [[Peebles]], [[Scottish Borders]]. His father was a [[:wikt:woolsorter|woolsorter]], but they moved back to Peebles shortly after Colin's birth.&lt;ref&gt;1891 Scotland Census&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 August 1914, just over three weeks after [[Great Britain|Britain]]'s entry into the [[First World War]], Buchan enlisted in the [[Royal Field Artillery]].&lt;ref name="McCrossan" /&gt; He became a [[Battery Quartermaster Sergeant]] and was [[Wounded in action|wounded]] late in the war,&lt;ref name="McCrossan" /&gt; but recovered and returned to football.

Buchan played in England, Scotland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Buchan's Skill|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000698/19190816/117/0010|accessdate=14 August 2017|work=Dundee People's Journal|date=16 August 1919}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Northern Ireland, signed to play for [[Linfield F.C.]] in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Irish Football League – Proposed Second Division – Players and Retained List|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001542/19210728/041/0003|accessdate=14 August 2017|work=Northern Whig and Belfast Post|date=28 July 1921}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to his hometown and played for the [[Peebles Rovers F.C.]] in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Facts for Football Followers|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000164/19221031/086/0006|accessdate=14 August 2017|work=Dundee Courier|date=31 October 1922|quote= Colin Buchan, the former Queen's Park, Dundee, and Belfast Linfield forward, played a brilliant game at outside right, for Peebles Rovers in their Qualifying Cup tie against Fraserburgh. He scored twice. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, when [[Billy McCandless]] returned to manage [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]], he recalled of Buchan, "The last year I was with Linfield I had as a colleague one of the most gentlemanly footballers who ever kicked a ball in Ireland, Colin Buchan, who came from Dundee."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Talk With Dundee's New Manager Glad to Return to Scotland|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000564/19330607/153/0010|accessdate=14 August 2017|work=Dundee Courier|date=7 June 1933}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in 1947 and is buried at Peebles St Andrews Cemetery.

'''Computational astrophysics'''  refers to the methods and computing tools developed and used in [[astrophysics]] research. Like [[computational chemistry]] or [[computational physics]], it is both a specific branch of  [[theoretical astrophysics]] and an interdisciplinary field relying on [[computer science]], [[mathematics]], and wider [[physics]]. Computational astrophysics is most often studied through an applied mathematics or astrophysics programme at PhD level.

Well-established areas of astrophysics employing computational methods include [[magnetohydrodynamics#Astrophysics|magnetohydrodynamics]], astrophysical radiative transfer, [[stellar dynamics|stellar]] and [[galaxy|galactic]] dynamics, and astrophysical [[fluid dynamics]]. A recently developed field with interesting results is [[numerical relativity]].

==Research==
Many astrophysicists use computers in their work, and a growing number of astrophysics departments now have research groups specially devoted to computational astrophysics. Important research initiatives include the [[US Department of Energy]] (DoE) [[Energy Citations Database#SciDAC|SciDAC]]  collaboration for astrophysics&lt;ref name=SciDAC&gt;[http://supersci.org "SciDAC Astrophysics Consortium"]. Accessed 8 Mar 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and the now defunct European AstroSim collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astrosim.net/ AstroSim.net]. Accessed 8 Mar 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; A notable active project is the international [[Virgo Consortium]], which focuses on cosmology.

In August 2015 during the general assembly of the International Astronomical Union a new 
[https://web.archive.org/web/20150912041337/http://www.iau.org/submissions/newcommissions/detail/62/ commission C.B1 on Computational Astrophysics] was inaugurated, therewith recognizing the importance of astronomical discovery by computing.

Important techniques of computational astrophysics include [[particle-in-cell]] (PIC) and the closely related [[particle-mesh]] (PM), [[N-body simulations]], [[Monte Carlo methods]],  as well as [[meshfree methods|grid-free]] (with [[smoothed particle hydrodynamics]] (SPH) being an important example) and [[regular grid|grid-based]] methods for fluids. In addition, methods from [[numerical analysis]] for solving [[ordinary differential equations|ODE]]s and [[partial differential equations|PDE]]s are also used.

[[Simulation]] of astrophysical flows is of particular importance as many objects and processes of astronomical interest such as stars and nebulae involve gases. [[Computational Fluid Dynamics|Fluid computer models]] are often coupled with radiative transfer,  (Newtonian) gravity, nuclear physics and (general) relativity to study highly energetic phenomena such as supernovae, [[relativistic jets]], [[active galaxies]] and [[gamma-ray bursts]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astronomy.com/~/link.aspx?_id=19336e76-b306-44db-ba11-8975a45029bc Breakthrough study confirms cause of short gamma-ray bursts]. [[Astronomy (magazine)]].com website, April 8, 2011. Retrieved 20 Nov 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and are also used to model [[stellar structure]], [[planetary formation]], [[stellar evolution|evolution of stars]] and [[galactic evolution|of galaxies]], and exotic objects such as [[neutron stars]], [[pulsars]], [[magnetars]] and black holes.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see the article [http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/mpa/research/current_research/hl2012-2/hl2012-2-en.html Cosmic Vibrations from Neutron Stars]. Retrieved 21 Mar 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Computer simulation]]s are often the only means to study [[stellar collisions]], [[galaxy merger]]s, as well as [[Interacting galaxy|galactic]] and black hole interactions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.obspm.fr/actual/nouvelle/mar10/galmer.en.shtm GALMER: GALaxy MERgers in the Virtual Observatory]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} : News release. Retrieved 20 Mar 2012. [http://galmer.obspm.fr/ Project Home page]. Retrieved 20 Mar 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/starsgalaxies/gwave.html NASA Achieves Breakthrough In Black Hole Simulation] ; dated 18 Apr 2006. Recovered 18 Mar 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years the field has made increasing use of [[parallel computing|parallel]] and [[Supercomputer|high performance computers]].&lt;ref&gt;Lucio Mayer. Foreword: Advanced Science Letters (ASL), Special Issue on Computational Astrophysics.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tools==

Computational astrophysics as a field makes extensive use of software and hardware technologies. These systems are often highly specialized and made by dedicated professionals, and so generally find limited popularity in the wider (computational) physics community.

===Hardware===
Like other similar fields, computational astrophysics makes extensive use of supercomputers and [[computer clusters]] . Even on the scale of a normal desktop it is possible to [[hardware accelerator|accelerate the hardware]]. Perhaps the most notable such [[computer architecture]] built specially for astrophysics is the [[Gravity Pipe|GRAPE (gravity pipe)]] in Japan.

As of 2010, the biggest N-body simulations, such as [[DEGIMA]], do [[general-purpose computing on graphics processing units]].&lt;ref&gt;Hamada T., Nitadori K. (2010) 190 TFlops astrophysical N-body simulation on a cluster of GPUs. In ''Proceedings of the 2010 ACM/IEEE International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis'' (SC '10). IEEE Computer Society, Washington, DC, USA, 1-9. {{doi|10.1109/SC.2010.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Software===
Many codes and software packages, exist along with various researchers and consortia maintaining them. Most codes tend to be 
n-body packages or fluid solvers of some sort. Examples of n-body codes  include [[ChaNGa]], MODEST,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manybody.org/modest  MODEST(MOdeling DEnse STellar systems) home page.]. Accessed 5 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; nbodylab.org&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbodylab.org/ NBodyLab.] Accessed 5 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and Starlab &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sns.ias.edu/~starlab/]&lt;/ref&gt;.

For hydrodynamics there is usually a coupling between codes, as the motion of the fluids usually has some other effect (such as gravity, or radiation)  in astrophysical situations. For example, for SPH/N-body there is [[GADGET]] and SWIFT&lt;ref&gt;Tom Theuns, Aidan Chalk, Matthieu Schaller, Pedro Gonnet: "SWIFT: task-based hydrodynamics and gravity for cosmological simulations" [https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.00115]&lt;/ref&gt;; for grid-based/N-body RAMSES,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ics.uzh.ch/~teyssier/ramses/RAMSES.html The RAMSES code]&lt;/ref&gt; ENZO,&lt;ref&gt;Brian W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3170">'''Conrad''' (died 27 February 906), called '''the Old''' or '''the Elder''', was the [[Duke of Thuringia]] briefly in 892–93. He was the namesake of the [[Conradine]]r family and son of [[Udo of Neustria]].  His mother (probably) was a daughter of Conrad I of Logenahe (832–860). He was the count of the [[Lahngau|Oberlahngau]] (886), [[Hessengau]] (897), [[Gotzfeld]]gau (903), [[Wetterau]] (905), and [[Worms, Germany|Worms]]gau (906). He united all of [[Hesse]] under his political control and under his heirs this territory became the [[Duchy of Franconia]].

Early in his career, Conrad feuded with the [[Babenberg]]s [[Henry of Franconia]] and [[Adalbert of Babenberg|Adalbert]]. Conrad's chief residence was [[Fritzlar|Friedeslar]] in [[Hesse]]. He was a ''[[comes]]'' (count) and ''[[ministerialis]]'' of [[Arnulf of Germany]] in 891. In 892, [[Poppo, Duke of Thuringia|Duke Poppo]] was deposed from his offices and replaced in Thuringia and the [[Sorbian March]] by Conrad. He only held the dukedom briefly before he was replaced by [[Burchard, Duke of Thuringia|Burchard]]. The reason for his appointment probably represent a change in Arnulf's policy in favour of the Conradines over the Babenbergs; but Conrad's short tenure may reflect his lack of support in Thuringia or an unwillingness on his part to be confined there.&lt;ref&gt;Reuter, ''Germany'', 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 880, Conrad married Glismod (also spelled Glismuot or Glismut). She may have been a daughter of [[Arnulf of Carinthia]], or else a relative of the earlier Thuringian dukes (perhaps a daughter of [[Thachulf, Duke of Thuringia|Thachulf]]), thus giving her husband a hereditary claim to Thuringia. They had four children: [[Conrad I of Germany|Conrad the Younger]], the future king of Germany; [[Eberhard of Franconia|Eberhard]], future duke of Franconia; Otto (also Udo or Odo), future count in the [[Ruhr]]gau and the middle [[Lahn]], who died in 918; and a daughter, name unknown.

In 906, as a result of a feud with the [[House of Babenberg|Babenbergs]], Conrad was killed in battle near [[Fritzlar]] and was buried in the church of Saint Martin at [[Weilburg]]. His eldest son was also old enough to participate in this war. His widow, Glismod, died in 26 April 924 and was buried next to him.

A '''Customs war''', also known as a ''toll war'' or ''tariff war'', is a type of economic conflict between two or more states. In order to pressure one of the states, the other raises taxes or [[tariff]]s for some of the products of that state. As a reprisal, the latter state may also increase the tariffs.

One example of a modern tariff war occurred in the 1920s and 1930s between the [[Weimar Republic]] and [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], in the [[German–Polish customs war]]. The Weimar Republic, led by [[Gustav Stresemann]] wanted to force Poland, by creating an economic crisis by increasing the tolls for coal and steel products developed there, to give up its territory. As a reprisal, the Poles increased toll rates for many German products. This led to fast development of the port of [[Gdynia]], which was the only way Poland could export its goods to Western Europe without having to transport them through Germany.

In September 1922 the [[Fordney–McCumber Tariff]] (named after [[Joseph Fordney]], chair of the [[House Ways and Means Committee]], and [[Porter McCumber]], chair of the [[Senate Finance Committee]]) was signed by U.S. President [[Warren G. Harding]].&lt;ref&gt;Rothgeb, 2001, 30-32&lt;/ref&gt;  In the end, the tariff law raised the average American [[ad valorem]] tariff rate to 38 percent.

Trading partners complained immediately.  Those injured by World War I said that, without access by their exports to the American market, they would not be able to make payments to America on war loans.  But others saw that this tariff increase would have broader deleterious effects.  Democratic Representative [[Cordell Hull]] said, "Our foreign markets depend both on the efficiency of our production and the tariffs of countries in which we would sell.  Our own [high] tariffs are an important factor in each.  They injure the former and invite the latter."

Five years after the passage of the tariff, American trading partners had raised their own tariffs by a significant degree.  [[France]] raised its tariffs on [[automobile]]s from 45% to 100%, [[Spain]] raised tariffs on American goods by 40%, and Germany and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] raised tariffs on wheat.&lt;ref&gt;Rothgeb, 2001, 32-33&lt;/ref&gt; This customs war is often cited as one of the main causes of the [[Great Depression]].

The [[World Trade Organization]] was created to avoid customs wars, which are considered harmful to the world's economy.

The [[atom]]s in the structure are colour-coded by [[Chemical element|element]] and the detailed structures of two base pairs are shown in the bottom right.]][[File:ADN animation.gif|thumb|The structure of part of a DNA [[double helix]]]]

'''Deoxyribonucleic acid''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Deoxyribonucleic_acid.ogg|d|i|ˈ|ɒ|k|s|ɪ|r|aɪ|b|oʊ|nj|uː|k|l|iː|ɪ|k|,_|-|k|l|eɪ|-}};&lt;ref&gt;{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|deoxyribonucleic acid}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''DNA''') is a molecule composed of two chains that coil around each other to form a [[Nucleic acid double helix|double helix]] carrying the [[genetics|genetic]] instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and [[reproduction]] of all known living [[organism]]s and many [[virus]]es. DNA and [[ribonucleic acid]] (RNA) are [[nucleic acid]]s; alongside [[protein]]s, [[lipids]] and complex carbohydrates ([[polysaccharide]]s), nucleic acids are one of the four major types of [[macromolecule]]s that are essential for all known forms of [[life]].

The two DNA strands are also known as [[polynucleotide]]s as they are composed of simpler [[monomer]]ic units called [[nucleotide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |vauthors= Alberts B, Johnson A, Lewis J, Raff M, Roberts K, Walter P |title= Molecular Biology of the Cell |edition= 6th |publisher= Garland |year= 2014 |url= http://www.garlandscience.com/product/isbn/9780815344322 |page= Chapter 4: DNA, Chromosomes and Genomes |isbn= 9780815344322 |deadurl= no |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140714210549/http://www.garlandscience.com/product/isbn/9780815344322 |archive-date= 14 July 2014 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Purcell|first1=Adam|name-list-format=vanc|title=DNA|url=http://basicbiology.net/micro/genetics/dna|website=Basic Biology|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170105045651/http://basicbiology.net/micro/genetics/dna/|archive-date=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each nucleotide is composed of one of four [[nitrogenous base|nitrogen-containing]] [[nucleobase]]s ([[cytosine]] [C], [[guanine]] [G], [[adenine]] [A] or [[thymine]] [T]), a [[monosaccharide|sugar]] called [[deoxyribose]], and a [[Organophosphate|phosphate group]]. The nucleotides are joined to one another in a chain by [[covalent bond]]s between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next, resulting in an alternating [[backbone chain|sugar-phosphate backbone]]. The nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands are bound together, according to [[base pair]]ing rules (A with T and C with G), with [[hydrogen bond]]s to make double-stranded DNA.

The complementary nitrogenous bases are divided into two groups, [[pyrimidine]]s and [[purine]]s. In DNA, the pyrimidines are thymine and cytosine; the purines are adenine and guanine.

Both strands of double-stranded DNA store the same biological [[information]]. This information is replicated as and when the two strands separate. A large part of DNA (more than 98% for humans) is [[non-coding DNA|non-coding]], meaning that these sections do not serve as patterns for protein sequences.

The two strands of DNA run in opposite directions to each other and are thus [[antiparallel (biochemistry)|antiparallel]]. Attached to each sugar is one of four types of nucleobases (informally, ''bases''). It is the [[Nucleic acid sequence|sequence]] of these four nucleobases along the backbone that encodes genetic information. [[RNA]] strands are created using DNA strands as a template in a process called [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]]. Under the [[genetic code]], these RNA strands specify the sequence of [[amino acid]]s within proteins in a process called [[translation (genetics)|translation]].

Within eukaryotic cells, DNA is organized into long structures called [[chromosome]]s. Before typical [[cell division]], these chromosomes are duplicated in the process of [[DNA replication]], providing a complete set of chromosomes for each daughter cell. [[Eukaryote|Eukaryotic organisms]] ([[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, [[Fungus|fungi]] and [[protist]]s) store most of their DNA inside the [[cell nucleus]] and some in [[organelle]]s, such as [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] or [[chloroplast]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Russell |first= Peter | name-list-format = vanc | title= iGenetics |publisher= Benjamin Cummings |location= New York |year= 2001 |isbn= 0-8053-4553-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[prokaryote]]s ([[bacteria]] and [[archaea]]) store their DNA only in the [[cytoplasm]]. Within eukaryotic chromosomes, [[chromatin]] proteins, such as [[histone]]s, compact and organize DNA. These compact structures guide the interactions between DNA and other proteins, helping control which parts of the DNA are transcribed.

DNA was first isolated by [[Friedrich Miescher]] in 1869. Its molecular structure was first identified by [[James Watson]] and [[Francis Crick]] at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] within the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1953, whose model-building efforts were guided by [[X-ray diffraction]] data acquired by [[Raymond Gosling]], who was a post-graduate student of [[Rosalind Franklin]]. DNA is used by researchers as a molecular tool to explore physical laws and theories, such as the [[ergodic theorem]] and the theory of [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]]. The unique material properties of DNA have made it an attractive molecule for material scientists and engineers interested in micro- and nano-fabrication. Among notable advances in this field are [[DNA origami]] and DNA-based hybrid materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mashaghi A, Katan A |title=A physicist's view of DNA |journal=De Physicus|volume=24e |issue=3 |pages=59–61 |year=2013 |arxiv= 1311.2545v1 |bibcode=2013arXiv1311.2545M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sugars are joined together by phosphate groups that form [[phosphodiester bond]]s between the third and fifth carbon [[atom]]s of adjacent sugar rings, which are known as the 3′ and 5′ carbons, the prime symbol being used to distinguish these carbon atoms from those of the base to which the deoxyribose forms a [[glycosidic bond]]. When imagining DNA, each phosphoryl is normally considered to "belong" to the nucleotide whose 5′ carbon forms a bond therewith. Any DNA strand therefore normally has one end at which there is a phosphoryl attached to the 5′ carbon of a ribose (the 5′ phosphoryl) and another end at which there is a free hydroxyl attached to the 3′ carbon of a ribose (the 3′ hydroxyl). The orientation of the 3′ and 5′ carbons along the sugar-phosphate backbone confers directionality (sometimes called polarity) to each DNA strand. In a double helix, the direction of the nucleotides in one strand is opposite to their direction in the other strand: the strands are ''antiparallel''. The asymmetric ends of DNA strands are said to have a [[directionality (molecular biology)|directionality]] of ''five prime'' (5′) and ''three prime'' (3′), with the 5′ end having a terminal phosphate group and the 3′ end a terminal hydroxyl group. One major difference between DNA and [[RNA]] is the sugar, with the 2-deoxyribose in DNA being replaced by the alternative pentose sugar [[ribose]] in RNA.&lt;ref name=berg/&gt;

===Nucleobase classification===
The nucleobases are classified into two types: the [[purine]]s, A and G, which are fused five- and six-membered [[heterocyclic compound]]s, and the [[pyrimidine]]s, the six-membered rings C and T.&lt;ref name=berg/&gt; A fifth pyrimidine nucleobase, [[uracil]] (U), usually takes the place of thymine in RNA and differs from thymine by lacking a [[methyl group]] on its ring. In addition to RNA and DNA, many artificial [[nucleic acid analogue]]s have been created to study the properties of nucleic acids, or for use in biotechnology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Verma S, Eckstein F | title = Modified oligonucleotides: synthesis and strategy for users | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 67 | pages = 99–134 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9759484 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.67.1.99 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-canonical bases===

Uracil is not usually found in DNA, occurring only as a breakdown product of cytosine.

5-hydroxymethyldeoxyuridine,(hm5dU) is also known to replace thymidine in several genomes including the ''Bacillus'' phages SPO1, ϕe, SP8, H1, 2C and SP82.

The reason for the presence of these non canonical bases in DNA is not known. It seems likely that at least part of the reason for their presence in bacterial viruses (phages) is to avoid the [[restriction enzyme]]s present in bacteria. This enzyme system acts at least in part as a molecular immune system protecting bacteria from infection by viruses.

===Grooves===
Twin helical strands form the DNA backbone. Another double helix may be found tracing the spaces, or grooves, between the strands. These voids are adjacent to the base pairs and may provide a [[binding site]]. As the strands are not symmetrically located with respect to each other, the grooves are unequally sized. One groove, the major groove, is 22&amp;nbsp;[[Ångström|Å]] wide and the other, the minor groove, is 12&amp;nbsp;Å wide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wing R, Drew H, Takano T, Broka C, Tanaka S, Itakura K, Dickerson RE | title = Crystal structure analysis of a complete turn of B-DNA | journal = Nature | volume = 287 | issue = 5784 | pages = 755–8 | date = October 1980 | pmid = 7432492 | doi = 10.1038/287755a0 | bibcode = 1980Natur.287..755W }}&lt;/ref&gt; The width of the major groove means that the edges of the bases are more accessible in the major groove than in the minor groove. As a result, proteins such as [[transcription factor]]s that can bind to specific sequences in double-stranded DNA usually make contact with the sides of the bases exposed in the major groove.&lt;ref name="Pabo1984"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pabo CO, Sauer RT | title = Protein-DNA recognition | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 53 | pages = 293–321 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6236744 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.bi.53.070184.001453 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This situation varies in unusual conformations of DNA within the cell ''(see below)'', but the major and minor grooves are always named to reflect the differences in size that would be seen if the DNA is twisted back into the ordinary B form.

===Base pairing===
{{further|Base pair}}

In a DNA double helix, each type of nucleobase on one strand bonds with just one type of nucleobase on the other strand. This is called complementary [[base pair]]ing. Here, purines form [[hydrogen bond]]s to pyrimidines, with adenine bonding only to thymine in two hydrogen bonds, and cytosine bonding only to guanine in three hydrogen bonds. This arrangement of two nucleotides binding together across the double helix is called a Watson-Crick base pair. Another type of base pairing is Hoogsteen base pairing where two hydrogen bonds form between guanine and cytosine.&lt;ref name="pmid23818176"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nikolova EN, Zhou H, Gottardo FL, Alvey HS, Kimsey IJ, Al-Hashimi HM |title=A historical account of Hoogsteen base-pairs in duplex DNA |journal=Biopolymers |volume=99 |issue=12 |pages=955–68 |year=2013 |pmid=23818176 |pmc=3844552 |doi=10.1002/bip.22334 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As hydrogen bonds are not [[covalent bond|covalent]], they can be broken and rejoined relatively easily. The two strands of DNA in a double helix can thus be pulled apart like a zipper, either by a mechanical force or high [[temperature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Clausen-Schaumann H, Rief M, Tolksdorf C, Gaub HE | title = Mechanical stability of single DNA molecules | journal = Biophysical Journal | volume = 78 | issue = 4 | pages = 1997–2007 | date = April 2000 | pmid = 10733978 | pmc = 1300792 | doi = 10.1016/S0006-3495(00)76747-6 | bibcode = 2000BpJ....78.1997C }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this base pair complementarity, all the information in the double-stranded sequence of a DNA helix is duplicated on each strand, which is vital in DNA replication. This reversible and specific interaction between complementary base pairs is critical for all the functions of DNA in living organisms.&lt;ref name=Alberts/&gt;

The two types of base pairs form different numbers of hydrogen bonds, AT forming two hydrogen bonds, and GC forming three hydrogen bonds (see figures, right).
DNA with high [[GC-content]] is more stable than DNA with low GC-content.

{{Anchor|ssDNA}}
As noted above, most DNA molecules are actually two polymer strands, bound together in a helical fashion by noncovalent bonds; this double-stranded ('''dsDNA''') structure is maintained largely by the intrastrand base stacking interactions, which are strongest for G,C stacks. The two strands can come apart&amp;nbsp;– a process known as melting&amp;nbsp;– to form two single-stranded DNA ('''ssDNA''') molecules. Melting occurs at high temperature, low salt and high [[pH]] (low pH also melts DNA, but since DNA is unstable due to acid depurination, low pH is rarely used).

The stability of the dsDNA form depends not only on the GC-content (% G,C basepairs) but also on sequence (since stacking is sequence specific) and also length (longer molecules are more stable). The stability can be measured in various ways; a common way is the "melting temperature", which is the temperature at which 50% of the ds molecules are converted to ss molecules; melting temperature is dependent on ionic strength and the concentration of DNA. As a result, it is both the percentage of GC base pairs and the overall length of a DNA double helix that determines the strength of the association between the two strands of DNA. Long DNA helices with a high GC-content have stronger-interacting strands, while short helices with high AT content have weaker-interacting strands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chalikian TV, Völker J, Plum GE, Breslauer KJ | title = A more unified picture for the thermodynamics of nucleic acid duplex melting: a characterization by calorimetric and volumetric techniques | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 96 | issue = 14 | pages = 7853–8 | date = July 1999 | pmid = 10393911 | pmc = 22151 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.96.14.7853 | bibcode = 1999PNAS...96.7853C }}&lt;/ref&gt; In biology, parts of the DNA double helix that need to separate easily, such as the TATAAT [[Pribnow box]] in some [[promoter (biology)|promoters]], tend to have a high AT content, making the strands easier to pull apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = deHaseth PL, Helmann JD | title = Open complex formation by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase: the mechanism of polymerase-induced strand separation of double helical DNA | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 817–24 | date = June 1995 | pmid = 7476180 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2958.1995.tb02309.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the laboratory, the strength of this interaction can be measured by finding the temperature necessary to break the hydrogen bonds, their [[DNA melting|melting temperature]] (also called ''T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' value). When all the base pairs in a DNA double helix melt, the strands separate and exist in solution as two entirely independent molecules. These single-stranded DNA molecules have no single common shape, but some conformations are more stable than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Isaksson J, Acharya S, Barman J, Cheruku P, Chattopadhyaya J | title = Single-stranded adenine-rich DNA and RNA retain structural characteristics of their respective double-stranded conformations and show directional differences in stacking pattern | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 43 | issue = 51 | pages = 15996–6010 | date = December 2004 | pmid = 15609994 | doi = 10.1021/bi048221v | url = http://www.boc.uu.se/boc14www/thesis/johan2005/Paper%20V/Paper%20V.pdf | deadurl = no | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070610205112/http://www.boc.uu.se/boc14www/thesis/johan2005/Paper%20V/Paper%20V.pdf | archive-date = 10 June 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sense and antisense===
{{further|Sense (molecular biology)}}

A DNA sequence is called "sense" if its sequence is the same as that of a [[messenger RNA]] copy that is translated into protein.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/newsletter/misc/DNA.html Designation of the two strands of DNA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424015915/http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/newsletter/misc/DNA.html |date=24 April 2008 }} JCBN/NC-IUB Newsletter 1989. Retrieved 7 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The sequence on the opposite strand is called the "antisense" sequence. Both sense and antisense sequences can exist on different parts of the same strand of DNA (i.e. both strands can contain both sense and antisense sequences). In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, antisense RNA sequences are produced, but the functions of these RNAs are not entirely clear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hüttenhofer A, Schattner P, Polacek N | title = Non-coding RNAs: hope or hype? | journal = Trends in Genetics | volume = 21 | issue = 5 | pages = 289–97 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15851066 | doi = 10.1016/j.tig.2005.03.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One proposal is that antisense RNAs are involved in regulating [[gene expression]] through RNA-RNA base pairing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Munroe SH | title = Diversity of antisense regulation in eukaryotes: multiple mechanisms, emerging patterns | journal = Journal of Cellular Biochemistry | volume = 93 | issue = 4 | pages = 664–71 | date = November 2004 | pmid = 15389973 | doi = 10.1002/jcb.20252 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few DNA sequences in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and more in [[plasmid]]s and [[virus]]es, blur the distinction between sense and antisense strands by having [[overlapping gene]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Makalowska I, Lin CF, Makalowski W | title = Overlapping genes in vertebrate genomes | journal = Computational Biology and Chemistry | volume = 29 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–12 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15680581 | doi = 10.1016/j.compbiolchem.2004.12.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cases, some DNA sequences do double duty, encoding one protein when read along one strand, and a second protein when read in the opposite direction along the other strand. In [[bacteria]], this overlap may be involved in the regulation of gene transcription,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Johnson ZI, Chisholm SW | title = Properties of overlapping genes are conserved across microbial genomes | journal = Genome Research | volume = 14 | issue = 11 | pages = 2268–72 | date = November 2004 | pmid = 15520290 | pmc = 525685 | doi = 10.1101/gr.2433104 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while in viruses, overlapping genes increase the amount of information that can be encoded within the small viral genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lamb RA, Horvath CM | title = Diversity of coding strategies in influenza viruses | journal = Trends in Genetics | volume = 7 | issue = 8 | pages = 261–6 | date = August 1991 | pmid = 1771674 | doi = 10.1016/0168-9525(91)90326-L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supercoiling===
{{further|DNA supercoil}}
DNA can be twisted like a rope in a process called [[DNA supercoil]]ing. With DNA in its "relaxed" state, a strand usually circles the axis of the double helix once every 10.4 base pairs, but if the DNA is twisted the strands become more tightly or more loosely wound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Benham CJ, Mielke SP | title = DNA mechanics | journal = Annual Review of Biomedical Engineering | volume = 7 | pages = 21–53 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16004565 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.bioeng.6.062403.132016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the DNA is twisted in the direction of the helix, this is positive supercoiling, and the bases are held more tightly together. If they are twisted in the opposite direction, this is negative supercoiling, and the bases come apart more easily. In nature, most DNA has slight negative supercoiling that is introduced by [[enzyme]]s called [[topoisomerase]]s.&lt;ref name=Champoux&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Champoux JJ | title = DNA topoisomerases: structure, function, and mechanism | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 70 | pages = 369–413 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11395412 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.70.1.369 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These enzymes are also needed to relieve the twisting stresses introduced into DNA strands during processes such as [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[DNA replication]].&lt;ref name=Wang&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang JC | title = Cellular roles of DNA topoisomerases: a molecular perspective | journal = Nature Reviews.

===Alternative DNA chemistry===
For many years, [[Astrobiology|exobiologists]] have proposed the existence of a [[shadow biosphere]], a postulated microbial biosphere of Earth that uses radically different biochemical and molecular processes than currently known life.

===Quadruplex structures===
{{further|G-quadruplex}}

At the ends of the linear chromosomes are specialized regions of DNA called [[telomere]]s.

These guanine-rich sequences may stabilize chromosome ends by forming structures of stacked sets of four-base units, rather than the usual base pairs found in other DNA molecules.

In addition to these stacked structures, telomeres also form large loop structures called telomere loops, or T-loops. Here, the single-stranded DNA curls around in a long circle stabilized by telomere-binding proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Griffith JD, Comeau L, Rosenfield S, Stansel RM, Bianchi A, Moss H, de Lange T | title = Mammalian telomeres end in a large duplex loop | journal = Cell | volume = 97 | issue = 4 | pages = 503–14 | date = May 1999 | pmid = 10338214 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80760-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the very end of the T-loop, the single-stranded telomere DNA is held onto a region of double-stranded DNA by the telomere strand disrupting the double-helical DNA and base pairing to one of the two strands. This [[Triple-stranded DNA|triple-stranded]] structure is called a displacement loop or [[D-loop]].&lt;ref name=Burge/&gt;

{{further|Branched DNA|DNA nanotechnology}}

In DNA, [[DNA end#Frayed ends|fraying]] occurs when non-complementary regions exist at the end of an otherwise complementary double-strand of DNA. However, branched DNA can occur if a third strand of DNA is introduced and contains adjoining regions able to hybridize with the frayed regions of the pre-existing double-strand. Although the simplest example of branched DNA involves only three strands of DNA, complexes involving additional strands and multiple branches are also possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Seeman NC | title = DNA enables nanoscale control of the structure of matter | journal = Quarterly Reviews of Biophysics | volume = 38 | issue = 4 | pages = 363–71 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16515737 | pmc = 3478329 | doi = 10.1017/S0033583505004087 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Branched DNA can be used in [[nanotechnology]] to construct geometric shapes, see the section on [[DNA#Uses in technology|uses in technology]] below.

===Base modifications and DNA packaging===
{{further|DNA methylation|Chromatin remodeling}}
The expression of genes is influenced by how the DNA is packaged in chromosomes, in a structure called [[chromatin]]. Base modifications can be involved in packaging, with regions that have low or no gene expression usually containing high levels of [[methylation]] of [[cytosine]] bases. DNA packaging and its influence on gene expression can also occur by covalent modifications of the [[histone]] protein core around which DNA is wrapped in the chromatin structure or else by remodeling carried out by chromatin remodeling complexes (see [[Chromatin remodeling]]). There is, further, [[Crosstalk (biology)|crosstalk]] between DNA methylation and histone modification, so they can coordinately affect chromatin and gene expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hu Q, Rosenfeld MG | title = Epigenetic regulation of human embryonic stem cells | journal = Frontiers in Genetics | volume = 3 | pages = 238 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23133442 | pmc = 3488762 | doi = 10.3389/fgene.2012.00238 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DNA can be damaged by many sorts of [[mutagen]]s, which change the DNA sequence. Mutagens include [[oxidizing agent]]s, [[Alkylation|alkylating agents]] and also high-energy [[electromagnetic radiation]] such as [[ultraviolet]] light and [[X-ray]]s.

Many mutagens fit into the space between two adjacent base pairs, this is called ''[[intercalation (biochemistry)|intercalation]]''. Most intercalators are [[aromaticity|aromatic]] and planar molecules; examples include [[ethidium bromide]], [[acridine]]s, [[Daunorubicin|daunomycin]], and [[doxorubicin]]. For an intercalator to fit between base pairs, the bases must separate, distorting the DNA strands by unwinding of the double helix. This inhibits both transcription and DNA replication, causing toxicity and mutations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ferguson LR, Denny WA | title = The genetic toxicology of acridines | journal = Mutation Research | volume = 258 | issue = 2 | pages = 123–60 | date = September 1991 | pmid = 1881402 | doi = 10.1016/0165-1110(91)90006-H }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, DNA intercalators may be [[carcinogen]]s, and in the case of thalidomide, a [[teratogen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stephens TD, Bunde CJ, Fillmore BJ | title = Mechanism of action in thalidomide teratogenesis | journal = Biochemical Pharmacology | volume = 59 | issue = 12 | pages = 1489–99 | date = June 2000 | pmid = 10799645 | doi = 10.1016/S0006-2952(99)00388-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others such as [[benzo(a)pyrene|benzo[''a'']pyrene diol epoxide]] and [[aflatoxin]] form DNA adducts that induce errors in replication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jeffrey AM | title = DNA modification by chemical carcinogens | journal = Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics | volume = 28 | issue = 2 | pages = 237–72 | year = 1985 | pmid = 3936066 | doi = 10.1016/0163-7258(85)90013-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, due to their ability to inhibit DNA transcription and replication, other similar toxins are also used in [[chemotherapy]] to inhibit rapidly growing [[cancer]] cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Braña MF, Cacho M, Gradillas A, de Pascual-Teresa B, Ramos A | title = Intercalators as anticancer drugs | journal = Current Pharmaceutical Design | volume = 7 | issue = 17 | pages = 1745–80 | date = November 2001 | pmid = 11562309 | doi = 10.2174/1381612013397113 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological functions==
[[File:Eukaryote DNA-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.45|Location of eukaryote [[nuclear DNA]] within the chromosomes]]
DNA usually occurs as linear [[chromosome]]s in [[eukaryote]]s, and [[circular bacterial chromosome|circular chromosomes]] in [[prokaryote]]s. The set of chromosomes in a cell makes up its [[genome]]; the [[human genome]] has approximately 3 billion base pairs of DNA arranged into 46 chromosomes.&lt;ref name = "Venter_2001"/&gt; The information carried by DNA is held in the [[DNA sequence|sequence]] of pieces of DNA called [[gene]]s. [[Transmission (genetics)|Transmission]] of genetic information in genes is achieved via complementary base pairing. For example, in transcription, when a cell uses the information in a gene, the DNA sequence is copied into a complementary RNA sequence through the attraction between the DNA and the correct RNA nucleotides. Usually, this RNA copy is then used to make a matching [[Peptide sequence|protein sequence]] in a process called [[Translation (biology)|translation]], which depends on the same interaction between RNA nucleotides. In alternative fashion, a cell may simply copy its genetic information in a process called DNA replication. The details of these functions are covered in other articles; here the focus is on the interactions between DNA and other molecules that mediate the function of the genome.

===Genes and genomes===
{{further|Cell nucleus|Chromatin|Chromosome|Gene|Noncoding DNA}}
Genomic DNA is tightly and orderly packed in the process called [[DNA condensation]], to fit the small available volumes of the cell. In eukaryotes, DNA is located in the [[cell nucleus]], with small amounts in [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] and [[chloroplast]]s. In prokaryotes, the DNA is held within an irregularly shaped body in the cytoplasm called the [[nucleoid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thanbichler M, Wang SC, Shapiro L | title = The bacterial nucleoid: a highly organized and dynamic structure | journal = Journal of Cellular Biochemistry | volume = 96 | issue = 3 | pages = 506–21 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 15988757 | doi = 10.1002/jcb.20519 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The genetic information in a genome is held within genes, and the complete set of this information in an organism is called its [[genotype]]. A gene is a unit of [[heredity]] and is a region of DNA that influences a particular characteristic in an organism. Genes contain an [[open reading frame]] that can be transcribed, and [[regulatory sequence]]s such as [[promoter (biology)|promoters]] and [[enhancer (genetics)|enhancers]], which control transcription of the open reading frame.

In many [[species]], only a small fraction of the total sequence of the [[genome]] encodes protein. For example, only about 1.5% of the human genome consists of protein-coding [[exon]]s, with over 50% of human DNA consisting of non-coding [[repeated sequence (DNA)|repetitive sequences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wolfsberg TG, McEntyre J, Schuler GD | title = Guide to the draft human genome | journal = Nature | volume = 409 | issue = 6822 | pages = 824–6 | date = February 2001 | pmid = 11236998 | doi = 10.1038/35057000 | bibcode = 2001Natur.409..824W }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for the presence of so much [[noncoding DNA]] in eukaryotic genomes and the extraordinary differences in [[genome size]], or ''[[C-value]]'', among species, represent a long-standing puzzle known as the "[[C-value enigma]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gregory TR | title = The C-value enigma in plants and animals: a review of parallels and an appeal for partnership | journal = Annals of Botany | volume = 95 | issue = 1 | pages = 133–46 | date = January 2005 | pmid = 15596463 | doi = 10.1093/aob/mci009 | pmc = 4246714 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some DNA sequences that do not code protein may still encode functional [[non-coding RNA]] molecules, which are involved in the [[regulation of gene expression]].&lt;ref name = "Birney_2007" /&gt;

===Transcription and translation===
{{further|Genetic code|Transcription (genetics)|Protein biosynthesis}}
A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains genetic information and can influence the [[phenotype]] of an organism. Within a gene, the sequence of bases along a DNA strand defines a [[messenger RNA]] sequence, which then defines one or more protein sequences. The relationship between the nucleotide sequences of genes and the [[amino acid|amino-acid]] sequences of proteins is determined by the rules of [[Translation (biology)|translation]], known collectively as the [[genetic code]]. The genetic code consists of three-letter 'words' called ''codons'' formed from a sequence of three nucleotides (e.g. ACT, CAG, TTT).

In transcription, the codons of a gene are copied into messenger RNA by [[RNA polymerase]]. This RNA copy is then decoded by a [[ribosome]] that reads the RNA sequence by base-pairing the messenger RNA to [[transfer RNA]], which carries amino acids. Since there are 4 bases in 3-letter combinations, there are 64 possible codons (4&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;combinations). These encode the twenty [[list of standard amino acids|standard amino acids]], giving most amino acids more than one possible codon. There are also three 'stop' or 'nonsense' codons signifying the end of the coding region; these are the TAA, TGA, and TAG codons.

[[File:DNA replication en.svg|thumb|upright=2.05|right|DNA replication. The double helix is unwound by a [[helicase]] and [[topoisomerase]]. Next, one [[DNA polymerase]] produces the [[Replication fork|leading strand]] copy. Another DNA polymerase binds to the [[Replication fork|lagging strand]]. This enzyme makes discontinuous segments (called [[Okazaki fragment]]s) before [[DNA ligase]] joins them together.]]

===Replication===
{{further|DNA replication}}

[[Cell division]] is essential for an organism to grow, but, when a cell divides, it must replicate the DNA in its genome so that the two daughter cells have the same genetic information as their parent. The double-stranded structure of DNA provides a simple mechanism for [[DNA replication]]. Here, the two strands are separated and then each strand's [[complementary DNA]] sequence is recreated by an [[enzyme]] called [[DNA polymerase]]. This enzyme makes the complementary strand by finding the correct base through complementary base pairing and bonding it onto the original strand. As DNA polymerases can only extend a DNA strand in a 5′ to 3′ direction, different mechanisms are used to copy the antiparallel strands of the double helix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Albà M | title = Replicative DNA polymerases | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = REVIEWS3002 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11178285 | pmc = 150442 | doi = 10.1186/gb-2001-2-1-reviews3002 | nopp = true }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, the base on the old strand dictates which base appears on the new strand, and the cell ends up with a perfect copy of its DNA.

===Extracellular nucleic acids===
Naked extracellular DNA (eDNA), most of it released by cell death, is nearly ubiquitous in the environment.

==Interactions with proteins==
All the functions of DNA depend on interactions with proteins. These [[protein interactions]] can be non-specific, or the protein can bind specifically to a single DNA sequence. Enzymes can also bind to DNA and of these, the polymerases that copy the DNA base sequence in transcription and DNA replication are particularly important.

Structural proteins that bind DNA are well-understood examples of non-specific DNA-protein interactions. Within chromosomes, DNA is held in complexes with structural proteins. These proteins organize the DNA into a compact structure called [[chromatin]]. In eukaryotes, this structure involves DNA binding to a complex of small basic proteins called [[histone]]s, while in prokaryotes multiple types of proteins are involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sandman K, Pereira SL, Reeve JN | title = Diversity of prokaryotic chromosomal proteins and the origin of the nucleosome | journal = Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences | volume = 54 | issue = 12 | pages = 1350–64 | date = December 1998 | pmid = 9893710 | doi = 10.1007/s000180050259 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dame RT | title = The role of nucleoid-associated proteins in the organization and compaction of bacterial chromatin | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 56 | issue = 4 | pages = 858–70 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15853876 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2958.2005.04598.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; The histones form a disk-shaped complex called a [[nucleosome]], which contains two complete turns of double-stranded DNA wrapped around its surface.

A distinct group of DNA-binding proteins is the DNA-binding proteins that specifically bind single-stranded DNA. In humans, replication [[protein A]] is the best-understood member of this family and is used in processes where the double helix is separated, including DNA replication, recombination, and DNA repair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Iftode C, Daniely Y, Borowiec JA | title = Replication protein A (RPA): the eukaryotic SSB | journal = Critical Reviews in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology | volume = 34 | issue = 3 | pages = 141–80 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10473346 | doi = 10.1080/10409239991209255 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These binding proteins seem to stabilize single-stranded DNA and protect it from forming [[stem-loop]]s or being degraded by [[nuclease]]s.

In contrast, other proteins have evolved to bind to particular DNA sequences. The most intensively studied of these are the various [[transcription factor]]s, which are proteins that regulate transcription. Each transcription factor binds to one particular set of DNA sequences and activates or inhibits the transcription of genes that have these sequences close to their promoters. The transcription factors do this in two ways. Firstly, they can bind the RNA polymerase responsible for transcription, either directly or through other mediator proteins; this locates the polymerase at the promoter and allows it to begin transcription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Myers LC, Kornberg RD | title = Mediator of transcriptional regulation | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 69 | pages = 729–49 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10966474 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.69.1.729 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, transcription factors can bind [[enzyme]]s that modify the histones at the promoter. This changes the accessibility of the DNA template to the polymerase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Spiegelman BM, Heinrich R | title = Biological control through regulated transcriptional coactivators | journal = Cell | volume = 119 | issue = 2 | pages = 157–67 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15479634 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2004.09.037 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As these DNA targets can occur throughout an organism's genome, changes in the activity of one type of transcription factor can affect thousands of genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Li Z, Van Calcar S, Qu C, Cavenee WK, Zhang MQ, Ren B | title = A global transcriptional regulatory role for c-Myc in Burkitt's lymphoma cells | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 14 | pages = 8164–9 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 12808131 | pmc = 166200 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1332764100 | bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.8164L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, these proteins are often the targets of the [[signal transduction]] processes that control responses to environmental changes or [[cellular differentiation]] and development. The specificity of these transcription factors' interactions with DNA come from the proteins making multiple contacts to the edges of the DNA bases, allowing them to "read" the DNA sequence. Most of these base-interactions are made in the major groove, where the bases are most accessible.&lt;ref name="Pabo1984" /&gt;

===DNA-modifying enzymes===

====Nucleases and ligases====
[[Nuclease]]s are [[enzyme]]s that cut DNA strands by catalyzing the [[hydrolysis]] of the [[phosphodiester bond]]s. Nucleases that hydrolyse nucleotides from the ends of DNA strands are called [[exonuclease]]s, while [[endonuclease]]s cut within strands. The most frequently used nucleases in [[molecular biology]] are the [[restriction enzyme|restriction endonucleases]], which cut DNA at specific sequences. For instance, the EcoRV enzyme shown to the left recognizes the 6-base sequence 5′-GATATC-3′ and makes a cut at the horizontal line. In nature, these enzymes protect [[bacteria]] against [[Bacteriophage|phage]] infection by digesting the phage DNA when it enters the bacterial cell, acting as part of the [[restriction modification system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bickle TA, Krüger DH | title = Biology of DNA restriction | journal = Microbiological Reviews | volume = 57 | issue = 2 | pages = 434–50 | date = June 1993 | pmid = 8336674 | pmc = 372918 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In technology, these sequence-specific nucleases are used in [[molecular cloning]] and [[Genetic fingerprinting|DNA fingerprinting]].

Enzymes called [[DNA ligase]]s can rejoin cut or broken DNA strands.&lt;ref name=Doherty&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Doherty AJ, Suh SW | title = Structural and mechanistic conservation in DNA ligases | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 28 | issue = 21 | pages = 4051–8 | date = November 2000 | pmid = 11058099 | pmc = 113121 | doi = 10.1093/nar/28.21.4051 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ligases are particularly important in [[Replication fork|lagging strand]] DNA replication, as they join together the short segments of DNA produced at the [[replication fork]] into a complete copy of the DNA template. They are also used in [[DNA repair]] and [[genetic recombination]].&lt;ref name=Doherty/&gt;

====Topoisomerases and helicases====
[[Topoisomerase]]s are enzymes with both nuclease and ligase activity. These proteins change the amount of [[DNA supercoil|supercoiling]] in DNA. Some of these enzymes work by cutting the DNA helix and allowing one section to rotate, thereby reducing its level of supercoiling; the enzyme then seals the DNA break.&lt;ref name=Champoux/&gt; Other types of these enzymes are capable of cutting one DNA helix and then passing a second strand of DNA through this break, before rejoining the helix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schoeffler AJ, Berger JM | title = Recent advances in understanding structure-function relationships in the type II topoisomerase mechanism | journal = Biochemical Society Transactions | volume = 33 | issue = Pt 6 | pages = 1465–70 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16246147 | doi = 10.1042/BST20051465 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Topoisomerases are required for many processes involving DNA, such as DNA replication and transcription.&lt;ref name=Wang/&gt;

[[Helicase]]s are proteins that are a type of [[molecular motor]]. They use the chemical energy in [[nucleoside triphosphate]]s, predominantly [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP), to break hydrogen bonds between bases and unwind the DNA double helix into single strands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tuteja N, Tuteja R | title = Unraveling DNA helicases. Motif, structure, mechanism and function | journal = European Journal of Biochemistry | volume = 271 | issue = 10 | pages = 1849–63 | date = May 2004 | pmid = 15128295 | doi = 10.1111/j.1432-1033.2004.04094.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; These enzymes are essential for most processes where enzymes need to access the DNA bases.

====Polymerases====
[[Polymerase]]s are [[enzyme]]s that synthesize polynucleotide chains from [[nucleoside triphosphate]]s. The sequence of their products is created based on existing polynucleotide chains—which are called ''templates''. These enzymes function by repeatedly adding a nucleotide to the 3′ [[hydroxyl]] group at the end of the growing polynucleotide chain. As a consequence, all polymerases work in a 5′ to 3′ direction.&lt;ref name=Joyce&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Joyce CM, Steitz TA | title = Polymerase structures and function: variations on a theme? | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 177 | issue = 22 | pages = 6321–9 | date = November 1995 | pmid = 7592405 | pmc = 177480 | doi=10.1128/jb.177.22.6321-6329.1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[active site]] of these enzymes, the incoming nucleoside triphosphate base-pairs to the template: this allows polymerases to accurately synthesize the complementary strand of their template. Polymerases are classified according to the type of template that they use.

In DNA replication, DNA-dependent [[DNA polymerase]]s make copies of DNA polynucleotide chains. To preserve biological information, it is essential that the sequence of bases in each copy are precisely complementary to the sequence of bases in the template strand. Many DNA polymerases have a [[Proofreading (biology)|proofreading]] activity. Here, the polymerase recognizes the occasional mistakes in the synthesis reaction by the lack of base pairing between the mismatched nucleotides. If a mismatch is detected, a 3′ to 5′ [[exonuclease]] activity is activated and the incorrect base removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hubscher U, Maga G, Spadari S | title = Eukaryotic DNA polymerases | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 71 | pages = 133–63 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12045093 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.71.090501.150041 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In most organisms, DNA polymerases function in a large complex called the [[replisome]] that contains multiple accessory subunits, such as the [[DNA clamp]] or [[helicase]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Johnson A, O'Donnell M | title = Cellular DNA replicases: components and dynamics at the replication fork | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 74 | pages = 283–315 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15952889 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.73.011303.073859 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

RNA-dependent DNA polymerases are a specialized class of polymerases that copy the sequence of an RNA strand into DNA. They include [[reverse transcriptase]], which is a [[virus|viral]] enzyme involved in the infection of cells by [[retrovirus]]es, and [[telomerase]], which is required for the replication of telomeres.&lt;ref name=Greider/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tarrago-Litvak1994&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tarrago-Litvak L, Andréola ML, Nevinsky GA, Sarih-Cottin L, Litvak S | title = The reverse transcriptase of HIV-1: from enzymology to therapeutic intervention | journal = FASEB Journal | volume = 8 | issue = 8 | pages = 497–503 | date = May 1994 | pmid = 7514143 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, HIV reverse transcriptase is an enzyme for AIDS virus replication.&lt;ref name=Tarrago-Litvak1994/&gt; Telomerase is an unusual polymerase because it contains its own RNA template as part of its structure. It synthesizes [[telomeres]] at the ends of chromosomes. Telomeres prevent fusion of the ends of neighboring chromosomes and protect chromosome ends from damage.&lt;ref name=Nugent/&gt;

Transcription is carried out by a DNA-dependent [[RNA polymerase]] that copies the sequence of a DNA strand into RNA. To begin transcribing a gene, the RNA polymerase binds to a sequence of DNA called a promoter and separates the DNA strands. It then copies the gene sequence into a [[messenger RNA]] transcript until it reaches a region of DNA called the [[terminator (genetics)|terminator]], where it halts and detaches from the DNA. As with human DNA-dependent DNA polymerases, [[RNA polymerase II]], the enzyme that transcribes most of the genes in the human genome, operates as part of a large [[protein complex]] with multiple regulatory and accessory subunits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Martinez E | title = Multi-protein complexes in eukaryotic gene transcription | journal = Plant Molecular Biology | volume = 50 | issue = 6 | pages = 925–47 | date = December 2002 | pmid = 12516863 | doi = 10.1023/A:1021258713850 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further|Genetic recombination}}
[[File:Chromosomal Recombination.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|left|Recombination involves the breaking and rejoining of two chromosomes (M and F) to produce two rearranged chromosomes (C1 and C2).]]

A DNA helix usually does not interact with other segments of DNA, and in human cells, the different chromosomes even occupy separate areas in the nucleus called "[[chromosome territories]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cremer T, Cremer C | title = Chromosome territories, nuclear architecture and gene regulation in mammalian cells | journal = Nature Reviews. Genetics | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 292–301 | date = April 2001 | pmid = 11283701 | doi = 10.1038/35066075 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This physical separation of different chromosomes is important for the ability of DNA to function as a stable repository for information, as one of the few times chromosomes interact is in [[chromosomal crossover]] which occurs during [[sexual reproduction]], when [[genetic recombination]] occurs. Chromosomal crossover is when two DNA helices break, swap a section and then rejoin.

Recombination allows chromosomes to exchange genetic information and produces new combinations of genes, which increases the efficiency of [[natural selection]] and can be important in the rapid evolution of new proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pál C, Papp B, Lercher MJ | title = An integrated view of protein evolution | journal = Nature Reviews. Genetics | volume = 7 | issue = 5 | pages = 337–48 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16619049 | doi = 10.1038/nrg1838 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic recombination can also be involved in DNA repair, particularly in the cell's response to double-strand breaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Driscoll M, Jeggo PA | title = The role of double-strand break repair - insights from human genetics | journal = Nature Reviews. Genetics | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 45–54 | date = January 2006 | pmid = 16369571 | doi = 10.1038/nrg1746 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common form of chromosomal crossover is [[homologous recombination]], where the two chromosomes involved share very similar sequences. [[Non-homologous recombination]] can be damaging to cells, as it can produce [[chromosomal translocation]]s and genetic abnormalities. The recombination reaction is catalyzed by enzymes known as [[recombinase]]s, such as [[RAD51]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vispé S, Defais M | title = Mammalian Rad51 protein: a RecA homologue with pleiotropic functions | journal = Biochimie | volume = 79 | issue = 9–10 | pages = 587–92 | date = October 1997 | pmid = 9466696 | doi = 10.1016/S0300-9084(97)82007-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first step in recombination is a double-stranded break caused by either an [[endonuclease]] or damage to the DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Neale MJ, Keeney S | title = Clarifying the mechanics of DNA strand exchange in meiotic recombination | journal = Nature | volume = 442 | issue = 7099 | pages = 153–8 | date = July 2006 | pmid = 16838012 | doi = 10.1038/nature04885 | bibcode = 2006Natur.442..153N | pmc = 5607947 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of steps catalyzed in part by the recombinase then leads to joining of the two helices by at least one [[Holliday junction]], in which a segment of a single strand in each helix is annealed to the complementary strand in the other helix. The Holliday junction is a tetrahedral junction structure that can be moved along the pair of chromosomes, swapping one strand for another. The recombination reaction is then halted by cleavage of the junction and re-ligation of the released DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dickman MJ, Ingleston SM, Sedelnikova SE, Rafferty JB, Lloyd RG, Grasby JA, Hornby DP | title = The RuvABC resolvasome | journal = European Journal of Biochemistry | volume = 269 | issue = 22 | pages = 5492–501 | date = November 2002 | pmid = 12423347 | doi = 10.1046/j.1432-1033.2002.03250.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only strands of like polarity exchange DNA during recombination. There are two types of cleavage: east-west cleavage and north-south cleavage. The north-south cleavage nicks both strands of DNA, while the east-west cleavage has one strand of DNA intact. The formation of a Holliday junction during recombination makes it possible for genetic diversity, genes to exchange on chromosomes, and expression of wild-type viral genomes.

{{further|RNA world hypothesis}}
DNA contains the genetic information that allows all modern living things to function, grow and reproduce. However, it is unclear how long in the 4-billion-year [[Timeline of evolution|history of life]] DNA has performed this function, as it has been proposed that the earliest forms of life may have used RNA as their genetic material.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Joyce GF | title = The antiquity of RNA-based evolution | journal = Nature | volume = 418 | issue = 6894 | pages = 214–21 | date = July 2002 | pmid = 12110897 | doi = 10.1038/418214a | bibcode = 2002Natur.418..214J }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Orgel LE | title = Prebiotic chemistry and the origin of the RNA world | journal = Critical Reviews in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology | volume = 39 | issue = 2 | pages = 99–123 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15217990 | doi = 10.1080/10409230490460765 }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA may have acted as the central part of early [[cell metabolism]] as it can both transmit genetic information and carry out [[catalysis]] as part of [[ribozyme]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Davenport RJ | title = Ribozymes.

==Uses in technology==

===Genetic engineering===
{{further|Molecular biology|Nucleic acid methods|Genetic engineering}}
Methods have been developed to purify DNA from organisms, such as [[phenol-chloroform extraction]], and to manipulate it in the laboratory, such as [[restriction digest]]s and the [[polymerase chain reaction]]. Modern [[biology]] and [[biochemistry]] make intensive use of these techniques in recombinant DNA technology. [[Recombinant DNA]] is a man-made DNA sequence that has been assembled from other DNA sequences. They can be [[transformation (genetics)|transformed]] into organisms in the form of [[plasmid]]s or in the appropriate format, by using a [[viral vector]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goff SP, Berg P | title = Construction of hybrid viruses containing SV40 and lambda phage DNA segments and their propagation in cultured monkey cells | journal = Cell | volume = 9 | issue = 4 PT 2 | pages = 695–705 | date = December 1976 | pmid = 189942 | doi = 10.1016/0092-8674(76)90133-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[genetic engineering|genetically modified]] organisms produced can be used to produce products such as recombinant [[protein]]s, used in [[medical research]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Houdebine LM | title = Transgenic animal models in biomedical research | journal = Methods in Molecular Biology | volume = 360 | pages = 163–202 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17172731 | doi = 10.1385/1-59745-165-7:163 | isbn = 1-59745-165-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or be grown in [[agriculture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Daniell H, Dhingra A | title = Multigene engineering: dawn of an exciting new era in biotechnology | journal = Current Opinion in Biotechnology | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 136–41 | date = April 2002 | pmid = 11950565 | pmc = 3481857 | doi = 10.1016/S0958-1669(02)00297-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Job D | title = Plant biotechnology in agriculture | journal = Biochimie | volume = 84 | issue = 11 | pages = 1105–10 | date = November 2002 | pmid = 12595138 | doi = 10.1016/S0300-9084(02)00013-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===DNA profiling===
{{further|DNA profiling}}

[[Forensic science|Forensic scientists]] can use DNA in [[blood]], [[semen]], [[skin]], [[saliva]] or [[hair]] found at a [[crime scene]] to identify a matching DNA of an individual, such as a perpetrator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theconversation.com/from-the-crime-scene-to-the-courtroom-the-journey-of-a-dna-sample-82250|title=From the crime scene to the courtroom: the journey of a DNA sample|last=Curtis|first=Caitlin|date=29 August 2017|work=The Conversation|access-date=22 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022033110/http://theconversation.com/from-the-crime-scene-to-the-courtroom-the-journey-of-a-dna-sample-82250|archive-date=22 October 2017|dead-url=no|last2=Hereward|first2=James | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is formally termed [[DNA profiling]], but may also be called "[[genetic fingerprinting]]". In DNA profiling, the lengths of variable sections of repetitive DNA, such as [[short tandem repeat]]s and [[minisatellite]]s, are compared between people. This method is usually an extremely reliable technique for identifying a matching DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Collins A, Morton NE | title = Likelihood ratios for DNA identification | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 91 | issue = 13 | pages = 6007–11 | date = June 1994 | pmid = 8016106 | pmc = 44126 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.91.13.6007 | bibcode = 1994PNAS...91.6007C }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, identification can be complicated if the scene is contaminated with DNA from several people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weir BS, Triggs CM, Starling L, Stowell LI, Walsh KA, Buckleton J | title = Interpreting DNA mixtures | journal = Journal of Forensic Sciences | volume = 42 | issue = 2 | pages = 213–22 | date = March 1997 | pmid = 9068179 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA profiling was developed in 1984 by British geneticist Sir [[Alec Jeffreys]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jeffreys AJ, Wilson V, Thein SL | title = Individual-specific 'fingerprints' of human DNA | journal = Nature | volume = 316 | issue = 6023 | pages = 76–9 | year = 1985 | pmid = 2989708 | doi = 10.1038/316076a0 | bibcode = 1985Natur.316...76J }}&lt;/ref&gt; and first used in forensic science to convict Colin Pitchfork in the 1988 [[Colin Pitchfork|Enderby murders]] case.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061214004903/http://www.forensic.gov.uk/forensic_t/inside/news/list_casefiles.php?case=1 Colin Pitchfork&amp;nbsp;— first murder conviction on DNA evidence also clears the prime suspect] Forensic Science Service Accessed 23 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of forensic science and the ability to now obtain genetic matching on minute samples of blood, skin, saliva, or hair has led to re-examining many cases. Evidence can now be uncovered that was scientifically impossible at the time of the original examination. Combined with the removal of the [[double jeopardy]] law in some places, this can allow cases to be reopened where prior trials have failed to produce sufficient evidence to convince a jury. People charged with serious crimes may be required to provide a sample of DNA for matching purposes. The most obvious defense to DNA matches obtained forensically is to claim that cross-contamination of evidence has occurred. This has resulted in meticulous strict handling procedures with new cases of serious crime.

DNA profiling is also used successfully to positively identify victims of mass casualty incidents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://massfatality.dna.gov/Introduction/ |title=DNA Identification in Mass Fatality Incidents |date=September 2006 |publisher=National Institute of Justice |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061112000837/http://massfatality.dna.gov/Introduction/ |archive-date=12 November 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; bodies or body parts in serious accidents, and individual victims in mass war graves, via matching to family members.

DNA profiling is also used in [[DNA paternity testing]] to determine if someone is the biological parent or grandparent of a child with the probability of parentage is typically 99.99% when the alleged parent is biologically related to the child. Normal [[DNA sequencing]] methods happen after birth, but there are new methods to test paternity while a mother is still pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/20/health/paternity-blood-tests-that-work-early-in-a-pregnancy.html "Paternity Blood Tests That Work Early in a Pregnancy" New York Times June 20, 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170624231639/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/20/health/paternity-blood-tests-that-work-early-in-a-pregnancy.html |date=24 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DNAzymes catalyze variety of chemical reactions including RNA-DNA cleavage, RNA-DNA ligation, amino acids phosphorylation-dephosphorylation, carbon-carbon bond formation, and etc. DNAzymes can enhance catalytic rate of chemical reactions up to 100,000,000,000-fold over the uncatalyzed reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chandra M, Sachdeva A, Silverman SK | title = DNA-catalyzed sequence-specific hydrolysis of DNA | journal = Nature Chemical Biology | volume = 5 | issue = 10 | pages = 718–20 | date = October 2009 | pmid = 19684594 | pmc = 2746877 | doi = 10.1038/nchembio.201 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most extensively studied class of DNAzymes is RNA-cleaving types which have been used to detect different metal ions and designing therapeutic agents.

[[Bioinformatics]] involves the development of techniques to store, [[data mining|data mine]], search and manipulate biological data, including DNA [[nucleic acid sequence]] data. These have led to widely applied advances in [[computer science]], especially [[string searching algorithm]]s, [[machine learning]], and [[database theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Baldi|first1= Pierre|author1-link=Pierre Baldi|last2= Brunak|first2= Soren | name-list-format = vanc |title=Bioinformatics: The Machine Learning Approach |publisher= MIT Press |year=2001| isbn=978-0-262-02506-5 |oclc=45951728}}&lt;/ref&gt; String searching or matching algorithms, which find an occurrence of a sequence of letters inside a larger sequence of letters, were developed to search for specific sequences of nucleotides.&lt;ref&gt;Gusfield, Dan.

===Information storage===
{{main|DNA digital data storage}}
In a paper published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in January 2013, scientists from the [[European Bioinformatics Institute]] and [[Agilent Technologies]] proposed a mechanism to use DNA's ability to code information as a means of digital data storage. The group was able to encode 739 kilobytes of data into DNA code, synthesize the actual DNA, then sequence the DNA and decode the information back to its original form, with a reported 100% accuracy. The encoded information consisted of text files and audio files. A prior experiment was published in August 2012. It was conducted by researchers at [[Harvard University]], where the text of a 54,000-word book was encoded in DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goldman N, Bertone P, Chen S, Dessimoz C, LeProust EM, Sipos B, Birney E | title = Towards practical, high-capacity, low-maintenance information storage in synthesized DNA | journal = Nature | volume = 494 | issue = 7435 | pages = 77–80 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23354052 | pmc = 3672958 | doi = 10.1038/nature11875 | bibcode = 2013Natur.494...77G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Naik|first=Gautam|title=Storing Digital Data in DNA|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324539304578259883507543150|accessdate=24 January 2013|newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]]|date=24 January 2013|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150124080051/http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324539304578259883507543150|archive-date=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909, [[Phoebus Levene]] identified the base, sugar, and phosphate nucleotide unit of the RNA (then named "yeast nucleic acid").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Levene PA, Jacobs WA | year = 1909 | title = Über Inosinsäure | language = German | journal = Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft | volume = 42 | pages = 1198–203 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Levene PA, Jacobs WA | year = 1909 | title = Über die Hefe-Nucleinsäure | language = German | journal = Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft | volume = 42 | issue = 2 | pages = 2474–8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Levene P |title=The structure of yeast nucleic acid| journal=J Biol Chem |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=415–24 |year=1919}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929, Levene identified deoxyribose sugar in "thymus nucleic acid" (DNA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cohen JS, Portugal FH | year = 1974 | title = The search for the chemical structure of DNA | journal = Connecticut Medicine | volume = 38 | issue = 10 | pages = 551–2, 554–7 | url = https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/access/CCAAHW.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Levene suggested that DNA consisted of a string of four nucleotide units linked together through the phosphate groups ("tetranucleotide hypothesis"). Levene thought the chain was short and the bases repeated in a fixed order.
In 1927, [[Nikolai Koltsov]] proposed that inherited traits would be inherited via a "giant hereditary molecule" made up of "two mirror strands that would replicate in a semi-conservative fashion using each strand as a template".&lt;ref&gt;Koltsov proposed that a cell's genetic information was encoded in a long chain of amino acids.

In 1933, while studying virgin [[sea urchin]] eggs, [[Jean Brachet]] suggested that DNA is found in the [[cell nucleus]] and that [[RNA]] is present exclusively in the [[cytoplasm]]. At the time, "yeast nucleic acid" (RNA) was thought to occur only in plants, while "thymus nucleic acid" (DNA) only in animals. The latter was thought to be a tetramer, with the function of buffering cellular pH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brachet J | year = 1933 | title = Recherches sur la synthese de l'acide thymonucleique pendant le developpement de l'oeuf d'Oursin | language = Italian | journal = Archives de Biologie | volume = 44 | pages = 519–576 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Burian R | year = 1994 | chapter = Jean Brachet's Cytochemical Embryology: Connections with the Renovation of Biology in France? | veditors = Debru C, Gayon J, Picard JF | title = Les sciences biologiques et médicales en France 1920–1950 | volume = 2 | series = Cahiers pour I'histoire de la recherche | location = Paris | publisher = CNRS Editions | pages = 207–220 | url = http://www.histcnrs.fr/ColloqDijon/Burian-Brachet.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943, [[Oswald Avery]], along with coworkers [[Colin Munro MacLeod|Colin MacLeod]] and [[Maclyn McCarty]], identified DNA as the [[Griffith's experiment|transforming principle]], supporting Griffith's suggestion ([[Avery–MacLeod–McCarty experiment]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Avery OT, Macleod CM, McCarty M | title = Studies on the Chemical Nature of the Substance Inducing Transformation of Pneumococcal Types: Induction of Transformation by a Desoxyribonucleic Acid Fraction Isolated from Pneumococcus Type III | journal = The Journal of Experimental Medicine | volume = 79 | issue = 2 | pages = 137–58 | date = February 1944 | pmid = 19871359 | pmc = 2135445 | doi = 10.1084/jem.79.2.137 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA's role in [[heredity]] was confirmed in 1952 when [[Alfred Hershey]] and [[Martha Chase]] in the [[Hershey–Chase experiment]] showed that DNA is the [[genetic material]] of the [[Enterobacteria phage T2|T2 phage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hershey AD, Chase M | title = Independent functions of viral protein and nucleic acid in growth of bacteriophage | journal = The Journal of General Physiology | volume = 36 | issue = 1 | pages = 39–56 | date = May 1952 | pmid = 12981234 | pmc = 2147348 | doi = 10.1085/jgp.36.1.39 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in 1951, [[Francis Crick]] started working with [[James Watson]] at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] within the [[University of Cambridge]]. In 1953, Watson and Crick suggested what is now accepted as the first correct double-helix model of [[Molecular structure of Nucleic Acids|DNA structure]] in the journal ''Nature''.&lt;ref name=FWPUB/&gt; Their double-helix, molecular model of DNA was then based on one [[X-ray diffraction]] image (labeled as "[[Photo 51]]")&lt;ref&gt;The B-DNA X-ray pattern [http://osulibrary.oregonstate.edu/specialcollections/coll/pauling/dna/pictures/sci9.001.5.html on the right of this linked image] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120525030457/http://osulibrary.oregonstate.edu/specialcollections/coll/pauling/dna/pictures/sci9.001.5.html |date=25 May 2012 }} was obtained by [[Rosalind Franklin]] and [[Raymond Gosling]] in May 1952 at high hydration levels of DNA and it has been labeled as "Photo 51"&lt;/ref&gt; taken by [[Rosalind Franklin]] and [[Raymond Gosling]] in May 1952, and the information that the DNA bases are paired. On 28 February 1953 Crick interrupted patrons' lunchtime at [[The Eagle, Cambridge|The Eagle]] [[pub]] in Cambridge to announce that he and Watson had "discovered the secret of life".&lt;ref&gt;Regis, Ed (2009) ''What Is Life?: investigating the nature of life in the age of synthetic biology''.

Months earlier, in February 1953, [[Linus Pauling]] and [[Robert Corey]] proposed a model for nucleic acids containing three intertwined chains, with the phosphates near the axis, and the bases on the outside.&lt;ref name="pmid16578429"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pauling L, Corey RB | title = A Proposed Structure For The Nucleic Acids | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 39 | issue = 2 | pages = 84–97 | date = February 1953 | pmid = 16578429 | pmc = 1063734 | doi = | url = http://scarc.library.oregonstate.edu/coll/pauling/dna/papers/1953p.9-084.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Experimental evidence supporting the Watson and Crick model was published in a series of five articles in the same issue of ''Nature''.&lt;ref name=NatureDNA50&gt;{{cite web | work = Nature Archives | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/dna50/archive.html | title = Double Helix of DNA: 50 Years | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150405140401/http://www.nature.com/nature/dna50/archive.html | archive-date=5 April 2015 | dead-url = yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, Franklin and Gosling's paper was the first publication of their own X-ray diffraction data and original analysis method that partly supported the Watson and Crick model;&lt;ref name=NatFranGos/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://osulibrary.oregonstate.edu/specialcollections/coll/pauling/dna/pictures/franklin-typeBphoto.html | title = Original X-ray diffraction image | publisher = Oregon State Library | access-date = 6 February 2011 | dead-url = no | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090130111849/http://osulibrary.oregonstate.edu/specialcollections/coll/pauling/dna/pictures/franklin-typeBphoto.html | archive-date=30 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; this issue also contained an article on DNA structure by [[Maurice Wilkins]] and two of his colleagues, whose analysis and ''in vivo'' B-DNA X-ray patterns also supported the presence ''in vivo'' of the double-helical DNA configurations as proposed by Crick and Watson for their double-helix molecular model of DNA in the prior two pages of ''Nature''.&lt;ref name="NatWilk" /&gt; In 1962, after Franklin's death, Watson, Crick, and Wilkins jointly received the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1962/ | title = The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1962 | work = Nobelprize.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nobel Prizes are awarded only to living recipients.

The '''deaths of Karlie Pearce-Stevenson and Khandalyce Pearce''' were initially treated as unrelated. The skeletal remains of Pearce-Stevenson were found in [[Belanglo State Forest]], [[New South Wales]], Australia, in 2010. Her daughter Khandalyce's remains were found near [[Wynarka, South Australia]] ({{convert|1100|km}} from Belanglo) in July 2015. The two cases were not linked until positive identification was confirmed by [[DNA testing]] in October 2015. The mother and daughter were last seen by family in 2008 in [[Alice Springs]], [[Northern Territory]] and reported missing in 2009; however, the report was withdrawn. It was discovered Pearce-Stevenson's mobile phone was used for years following her death to send false "proof of life" messages to family and friends. The mother and child's identities were exploited by third parties to commit [[social security in Australia|social security]] and other types of [[identity fraud]].

On 28 October 2015, Daniel James Holdom, reported to be Pearce-Stevenson's former partner, was arrested in [[Cessnock, New South Wales|Cessnock]], New South Wales, and charged with her murder. On 15 December he was also charged with the murder of her daughter, Khandalyce. On 30 November 2018 he was sentenced to two life sentences for the murders.

==Belanglo State Forest==
On 29 August 2010, trail bike riders discovered skeletal human remains in the [[Belanglo State Forest]] in [[New South Wales]]. Media reports at first linked the killing to serial killer Ivan Milat and the [[backpacker murders]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/possible-backpacker-link-may-help-police-to-identify-belanglo-angel-20121109-293dm.html|title=Possible backpacker link may help police to identify Belanglo 'Angel'|date=10 November 2012|work=Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; but later forensic examination found the remains had been left there many years after Milat was jailed in 1996 for the seven murders in the forest.&lt;ref name="abc-belanglobones"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/09/15/3012463.htm | title=Belanglo bones belong to teenage girl: police | publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation | work=ABC News | date=15 September 2010 | accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2010 appeal for information, police called the woman "Angel" after the motif on a T-shirt she was wearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/who-is-she-belanglo-girls-skull-reconstructed-20111202-1oa1x.html|title=Who is she?

On 21 October 2015, the bones were identified as the body of Pearce-Stevenson, aged 22, from Alice Springs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/detectives-link-wynarka-girls-bones-in-suitcase-to-angel-bones-in-belanglo/story-fni0cx12-1227576865065 | title=Detectives link Wynarka girl's bones in suitcase to 'Angel' bones in Belanglo | work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]] | date=21 October 2015 | accessdate=22 October 2015 | publisher=News Corp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wynarka==
On 15 July 2015, the remains of a young child surrounded by girl's clothing were discovered by a passing motorist who examined an abandoned suitcase at the side of the [[Karoonda Highway]] near [[Wynarka, South Australia|Wynarka]] in the [[Murray Mallee]] region of South Australia. From the beginning, investigators believed the child had suffered a violent death several years before the remains had been dumped in the suitcase.&lt;ref name="post-mortem"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/south-australian-suitcase-murder-post-mortem-confirms-child-dumped-at-wynarka-met-violent-end/story-fni6uo1m-1227446040185 | title=South Australian suitcase murder: Post-mortem confirms child dumped at Wynarka met violent end | publisher=News Corp | work=The Advertiser | date=18 July 2015 | accessdate=22 October 2015 | author=Sam Kelton}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until October 2015 that the victim was identified as Pearce, aged two, who, with her mother, had been reported missing from [[Alice Springs, Northern Territory|Alice Springs]] more than five years earlier, in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-10-21/breakthrough-announced-in-wynarka-and-belanglo-cases/6872550 | title=Girl in suitcase identified as Khandalyce Kiara Pearce; mother Karlie Jade Pearce-Stevenson found in Belanglo State Forest | publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation | work=ABC News | date=21 October 2015 | accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after the discovery of the child's remains, police made a public appeal for information that could help identify her, based on items that were found with the suitcase including children's clothing and a distinctive hand-made [[quilt]]. After more than 1,200 calls to [[Crime Stoppers]], one caller was able to identify the quilt as one made by the child's grandmother, who had died in 2012 believing her daughter and granddaughter were living interstate.&lt;ref name="identified"/&gt; Positive identification was achieved by comparing DNA extracted from the child's skeletal remains with DNA retained from a [[neonatal heel prick]] test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/karlie-and-khandalyce-police-trace-dna-through-pinprick-blood-test/story-fni0cx4q-1227580537157?sv=e6553435f04faa8957c2ac025aa28b76|title=Karlie and Khandalyce: Police trace DNA through pinprick blood test|quote=The so-called Guthrie test, more commonly used to pick up serious disorders such as cystic fibrosis, is believed to have been used only a handful of times by police to identify murder victims|date=23 October 2015|work=Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; A national DNA search then linked the child's remains with the profile of her mother, the previously unidentified remains found in the Belanglo State Forest.

'''Karlie Jade Pearce-Stevenson''' was born in 1988 in Alice Springs and attended [[Braitling, Northern Territory|Braitling]] Primary School and [[Alice Springs High School]]. She was a keen [[netball]]er. Her mother died in 2012. Pearce-Stevenson's step-father and step-brother still live in Alice Springs.&lt;ref name="suspect"/&gt;

'''Khandalyce Kiara Pearce''' was Pearce-Stevenson's daughter.&lt;ref name="suspect"/&gt; She was born in 2006 in Alice Springs.

Pearce-Stevenson is believed to have left Alice Springs with Pearce in 2008 to look for work. Police believe they travelled to [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], [[Adelaide]], the Murray and [[Riverland]] districts, [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Canberra]], and appealed to owners of motels, hotels and caravan parks to check their records in case the pair had stayed at their premises. A [[missing person]] report was raised with the Northern Territory Police by Pearce-Stevenson's mother on 4 September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.police.sa.gov.au/sa-police-news-assets/traffic/double-murder-breakthrough-wynarka-suitcase-girl-identified-along-with-her-mother |title=SAPOL  –  Double murder breakthrough: Wynarka suitcase girl identified along with her mother |work=police.sa.gov.au }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report was closed on 9 October 2009 after "she was reassured Karlie was safe and well, but did not want family contact at that time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.police.nsw.gov.au/news/latest_releases?sq_content_src=%2BdXJsPWh0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGZWJpenByZC5wb2xpY2UubnN3Lmdvdi5hdSUyRm1lZGlhJTJGNDkzODIuaHRtbCZhbGw9MQ%3D%3D|title=NSW and SA Police murder investigations linked as mother and child identified- Media Release|work=police.nsw.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police also believe Pearce-Stevenson was killed in Belanglo Forest on 14 or 15 December 2008, and her daughter was killed sometime later in a different location.&lt;ref name="Holdom-relationships"/&gt;&lt;ref name="90K-ID"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Benny-Morrison|first1=Ava|title=Girl in suitcase: mother Karlie Pearce-Stevenson's identity used to rake in $90,000|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/girl-in-suitcase-dead-mothers-identity-used-to-rake-in-90000-20151027-gkjpxi.html|accessdate=27 October 2015|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|date=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigators have not revealed details of injuries, or how the pair were killed; however, police said the child died a "violent death under terrible circumstances".&lt;ref name="post-mortem"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Holdom-phone"&gt;{{cite news|title=Daniel Holdom's phone detected in Belanglo forest near mother's remains, police allege|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/oct/29/daniel-holdoms-phone-detected-in-belanglo-forest-near-mothers-remains-police-allege|agency=AAP|publisher=The Guardian|date=29 October 2015|location=Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The remains of the two victims were returned to Alice Springs and a funeral service and burial was held in December 2015 with the assistance of funds raised from the public and local government.&lt;ref name="remains"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-10-22/family-of-murder-victim-karlie-stevenson-and-daughter-appeal/6877280 | title=Remains of Karlie Pearce-Stevenson and daughter Khandalyce Pearce to return to Alice Springs after government offer, public help | publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation | work=ABC News | date=22 October 2015 | accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Funeral&gt;{{cite news|title=Karlie Pearce-Stevenson and Khandalyce Pearce: Funeral held for mum and daughter in Alice Springs|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-12-11/karlie-pearce-stevenson-and-khandalyce-pearce-funeral-in-nt/7021396|accessdate=27 January 2016|publisher=ABC News|date=11 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identity theft== 
Pearce-Stevenson's mobile phone was used until mid-2011, communicating via text messages to give her family and friends the impression she was alive and well, and to appeal for money. Her bank account was accessed until at least 2012 at locations in four states and territories.&lt;ref name="7:30-net"/&gt; Over $90,000 was stolen through the account, including [[Centrelink]] family payments and other proceeds of fraud. A woman in a wheelchair, accompanied by a man, impersonated Pearce-Stevenson to staff at a [[credit union]] in June 2010 using her identity documents. Another woman impersonated her at a Centrelink office in South Australia the same year, using identity documents for Pearce-Stevenson and her daughter Khandalyce.&lt;ref name="90K-ID"/&gt; The woman had her leg amputated as a result of a car rollover in 2008 in which Holdom was driving on the [[Stuart Highway]] north of [[Marla, South Australia|Marla]]. Two of her children were killed in the crash. She reached an out-of-court settlement in May 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Karlie and Khandalyce case: Hazel Passmore reaches settlement with alleged killer Daniel Holdom over car crash injuries |first=Steve |last=Rice |work=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] |date=9 May 2016 |url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/karlie-and-khandalyce-case-hazel-passmore-reaches-settlement-with-alleged-killer-daniel-holdom-over-car-crash-injuries/news-story/a1ad779785c5e756122a61aa4c813a83 |access-date=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Suspects==
Within days of releasing the identities of the victims, police reported they had several suspects, including one in a NSW jail awaiting sentencing on unrelated charges.&lt;ref name="suspect"/&gt;

==Arrest==
On 28 October 2015, 41-year-old Daniel James Holdom was arrested in [[Cessnock, New South Wales]].&lt;ref name="abc-arrest-mother"&gt;{{cite news |title=Karlie Pearce-Stevenson: NSW Police arrest man over alleged murder of mother |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-10-28/arrest-made-in-mother-daughter-double-deaths/6884204 |accessdate=29 October 2015 |work=ABC News |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later charged with the murder of Pearce-Stevenson.&lt;ref name="abc-murder-charge"&gt;{{cite news |title=Karlie Pearce-Stevenson death: Man charged with murder |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-10-29/man-charged-over-karlie-pearce-stevenson-death/6894428 |accessdate=29 October 2015 |work=ABC News |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was found to be in a relationship with a woman named Hazel Passmore,&lt;ref name="Passmore"/&gt; who allegedly hijacked Ms Pearce-Stevenson's identity after she was killed and investigators believe the suspect was also involved in a relationship with Pearce-Stevenson.&lt;ref name="Holdom-relationships"/&gt; Police allegedly traced a signal from the man's mobile telephone to the location her remains were found in Belanglo Forest at about the time of her death in December.&lt;ref name="Holdom-phone"/&gt;

In September 2008, the suspect had been involved in a car accident in which two of his then partner's children were killed.&lt;ref name="Passmore"&gt;{{cite news |title=Karlie Pearce-Stevenson murder: Homicide detectives question wheelchair-bound Adelaide woman Hazel Passmore |date=30 October 2015 |first=Sean |last=Fewster |first2=Andrew |last2=Hough |first3=Ashlee |last3=Mullany |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] |url=http://www.news.com.au/national/crime/karlie-pearcestevenson-man-accused-of-murder-in-sa-crash-that-killed-two-children/news-story/1306899b643dff5751349c3747a3313e |access-date=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2008-09-16/four-die-on-sa-roads/511300 |title=Four die on SA roads |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=16 Sep 2008 |accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mother of the children sustained injuries that left her confined to a wheelchair and she is believed to be the same woman who impersonated Pearce-Stevenson at a credit union in 2010.&lt;ref name="7:30-net"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sensational new details emerge as net tightens on killers of mother and daughter|url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2015/s4341441.htm#|agency=ABC TV|publisher=ABC 7:30|date=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier, in August 2008, the woman had uploaded images of Khandalyce Pearce to her Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-10-30/khandalyce-pearce-new-photos-facebook/6897270|title=Photos of Khandalyce Pearce found on Facebook page of Daniel Holdom's ex-girlfriend Hazel Passmore|work=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The child was photographed in the company of her own children at a motorshow in Alice Springs.&lt;ref name="social-media"&gt;{{cite news|last1=James|first1=Colin|title=Adelaide woman Hazel Passmore dismantled social media as pressure increased over Belanglo-Wynarka murder investigation|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/national/adelaide-woman-hazel-passmore-dismantled-social-media-as-pressure-increased-over-belanglowynarka-murder-investigation/news-story/6a7aa73775e1b6ceed58c834f7acf508|publisher=The Adelaide Advertiser|date=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 December 2015, Holdom was arrested again in Cessnock for the murder of Khandalyce Pearce. Described as a very violent death, investigators allege Pearce was murdered only a few days after her mother. An officer involved in the investigation remarked it was fortunate the suspect was already in custody as it had allowed police to take time to conduct a "thorough and comprehensive investigation".&lt;ref name="SMH"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Daniel Holdom charged with murder of two-year-old girl|url = http://www.smh.com.au/national/daniel-holdom-charged-with-murder-of-two-year-old-girl-20151214-glnnik|website = The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate = 2015-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holdom was charged at Parramatta Local Court and refused bail. His case was adjourned until 28 January 2016, when his trial was intended to take place at the Central Law Courts of Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Man charged over murder of Khandalyce Pearce|url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-12-15/holdom-charged-over-murder-of-khandalyce-kiara-pearce/7029280|website = ABC News|accessdate = 2015-12-15|language = en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was further adjourned to March as the police and prosecutors were still collating the brief of evidence, and only about one third of it had been provided to the defence lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.9news.com.au/national/2016/01/28/13/12/nsw-mother-daughter-murder-case-adjourned |title=NSW mother-daughter murder case adjourned |date=28 January 2016 |accessdate=28 January 2016 |website=9news.com.au |publisher=NineMSN Pty Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was adjourned again in September 2016 to at least November due to evidence being collected in a total of five jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/evidence-delay-in-daniel-holdom-murder-trial/news-story/c3e5e5e19d10f0d3740fddbbd511d172 |title=Evidence delay in Daniel Holdom murder trial |newspaper=[[The Australian]] |date=8 September 2016 |first=Sam |last=Buckingham-Jones |access-date=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Committal hearing==

During his committal hearing in August 2017, it was alleged that Holdom had told a witness he stepped on Karlie Pearce-Stevenson's throat, crushed her windpipe and buried her body in the Belanglo forest. It was also alleged he stopped at a supermarket and bought duct tape and garbage bags before he suffocated Khandalyce in a motel in [[Narrandera]], stuffed her body in a suitcase, and dumped it in Wynarka where it remained for nearly seven years.&lt;ref name="trophy"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/daniel-holdom-took-trophy-photo-after-killing-karlie-pearce-stevenson-court-told-20170820-gy0gyv.html |title=Daniel Holdom took 'trophy' photo after killing Karlie Pearce-Stevenson, court told |first=Ava |last=Benny-Morrison |date=24 August 2017 |accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first appearance in the [[Supreme Court of New South Wales]] on 1 December 2017.

His sentencing, originally set for September 29, was moved to November 9, where he faces two life sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.news.com.au/national/courts-law/guilty-plea-in-belanglo-angel-and-toddler-in-suitcase-murders/news-story/a000acc3880641624cded42b7eb6a4e3 |title=Guilty plea in ‘Belanglo Angel’ and ‘toddler in suitcase’ murders |website=News.com.au |date=31 July 2018 |accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The brutality of the murders was publicly revealed following his guilty plea. Holdom also had a prior history of violence against women &lt;ref name="Court cheers sentence"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sutton |first1=Candace |title=Court cheers as double killer gets two life sentences |url=https://www.news.com.au/national/courts-law/court-cheers-as-double-killer-gets-two-life-sentences/news-story/54efcc7d00c5bd305d120f945f723b0f |accessdate=1 December 2018 |work=news.com.au |agency=News Ltd |date=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an interest in sexual violence toward children.

Bruce Pearce, Karlie's father and Khandalyce's grandfather, gave a written statement during the sentencing, expressing his desire for a [[Capital punishment in Australia|death sentence]] against Holdom. Australia abolished the death penalty in 2010. Prosecutor [[Mark Tedeschi]] described the murders as a "thrill killing", and said "Both murders fall within the worst case and can aptly be described as atrocious, detestable, hateful, gravely reprehensible and extremely wicked".&lt;ref name="news.com.au"&gt;McPhee, Sarah; AAP "[https://www.news.com.au/national/nsw-act/courts-law/father-to-killer-death-penalty-not-enough-for-extremely-wicked-murderer/news-story/9322534560daf5c847ab8d9bde3e789d Father to killer: Death penalty not enough for ‘extremely wicked’ murderer]" (News.com.au), 28 September 2018. Retrieved 30 November 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sentence==
On 30 November 2018 Holdom was sentenced in the [[NSW Supreme Court]] to two life sentences for the murders.&lt;ref name="perthnow-holdom-sentence"&gt;{{cite news |title=Holdom given two life-sentences |url=https://www.perthnow.com.au/news/australia/daniel-james-holdom-given-two-life-sentences-karlie-pearce-stevenson-and-khandalyce-murders-ng-b881036717z |accessdate=30 November 2018 |work=PerthNow |agency=AAP |publisher=Seven West Media (WA) |date=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Erl king sterner.jpg|thumb|''The Erlking'' by [[Albert Sterner]], ca. 1910]]

"'''Erlkönig'''" is a [[German poetry|poem]] by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]].
It depicts the death of a child assailed by a supernatural being, the [[Erlkönig]], often half-translated as "Erlking", though the eponymous character is clearly some kind of demon or 'fairy king'. It was originally composed by Goethe as part of a 1782 ''[[Singspiel]]'' entitled {{Lang|de|Die Fischerin}}.

"Erlkönig" has been called Goethe's "most famous ballad".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3gL8BszvU0gC&amp;pg=PA4|title=Goethe Yearbook 19|page=4|last=Purdy|first=Daniel|publisher=Camden House|date=2012|isbn=1571135251}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poem has been set to music by several composers, most notably by [[Franz Schubert]].

== Summary ==
An anxious young boy is being carried at night by his father on horseback. To where is not spelled out; German ''[[Wikt:Hof|Hof]]'' has a rather broad meaning of "yard", "courtyard", "farm", or (royal) "court". The lack of specificity of the father's social position, beyond owning a horse, allows the reader to imagine the details. The opening line tells that the time is unusually late and the weather unusually inclement for travel. As it becomes apparent that the boy is delirious, a possibility is that the father is rushing him to medical aid.

As the poem unfolds, the son seems to see and hear beings his father does not; the reader cannot know if the father is indeed aware of their presence, but he chooses to comfort his son, asserting reassuringly naturalistic explanations for what the child sees – a wisp of fog, rustling leaves, shimmering willows. Finally, the child shrieks that he has been attacked. The father rides faster to the {{Lang|de|Hof}}. There, he recognizes that the boy is dead.

Es ist der Vater mit seinem Kind;
Er hat den Knaben wohl in dem Arm,

"Mein Sohn, was birgst du so bang dein Gesicht?" –
"Siehst, Vater, du den Erlkönig nicht?
Den Erlenkönig mit Kron' und Schweif?" –
"Mein Sohn, es ist ein Nebelstreif."

"Du liebes Kind, komm, geh mit mir!
Gar schöne Spiele spiel' ich mit dir;
Manch' bunte Blumen sind an dem Strand,

"Mein Vater, mein Vater, und hörest du nicht,
Was Erlenkönig mir leise verspricht?" –
"Sei ruhig, bleibe ruhig, mein Kind;
In dürren Blättern säuselt der Wind." –

"Willst, feiner Knabe, du mit mir gehn?
Meine Töchter sollen dich warten schön;
Meine Töchter führen den nächtlichen Reihn,
Und wiegen und tanzen und singen dich ein." –

Erlkönigs Töchter am düstern Ort?" –
"Mein Sohn, mein Sohn, ich seh' es genau:
Es scheinen die alten Weiden so grau. –"

"Ich liebe dich, mich reizt deine schöne Gestalt;
Und bist du nicht willig, so brauch' ich Gewalt." –
"Mein Vater, mein Vater, jetzt faßt er mich an!

| style="padding-left: 1em;"|&lt;poem&gt;Who rides, so late, through night and wind?
It is the father with his child.
He has the boy well in his arm
He holds him safely, he keeps him warm.

"My son, why do you hide your face in fear?"
"Father, do you not see the Elf-king?
The Elf-king with crown and cape?"
"My son, it's a streak of fog."

"You dear child, come, go with me!
(Very) beautiful games I play with you;
Many colorful flowers are on the beach,
My mother has many a golden robe."

"My father, my father, and do you not hear
What the Elf-king quietly promises me?"
"Be calm, stay calm, my child;
Through dry leaves the wind is sighing."

"Do you, fine boy, want to go with me?
My daughters shall wait on you finely;
My daughters lead the nightly dance,
And rock and dance and sing to bring you in."

"My father, my father, and don't you see there
The Elf-king's daughters in the gloomy place?"
"My son, my son, I see it clearly:
There shimmer the old willows so grey."

"I love you, your beautiful form entices me;
And if you're not willing, then I will use force."
"My father, my father, he's touching me now!
The Elf-king has done me harm!"

It horrifies the father; he swiftly rides on,
He holds the moaning child in his arms,
Reaches the farm with great difficulty;
In his arms, the child was dead.&lt;/poem&gt;
| style="padding-left: 1em;"|&lt;poem&gt;Who rides there so late through the night dark and drear?
The father it is, with his infant so dear;
He holdeth the boy tightly clasp'd in his arm,
He holdeth him safely, he keepeth him warm.

"My son, wherefore seek'st thou thy face thus to hide?"
"Look, father, the Erl-King is close by our side!
Dost see not the Erl-King, with crown and with train?"
"My son, 'tis the mist rising over the plain."

"Oh, come, thou dear infant! oh come thou with me!
For many a game I will play there with thee;
On my strand, lovely flowers their blossoms unfold,
My mother shall grace thee with garments of gold."

"My father, my father, and dost thou not hear
The words that the Erl-King now breathes in mine ear?"
"Be calm, dearest child, 'tis thy fancy deceives;
'Tis the sad wind that sighs through the withering leaves."

"Wilt go, then, dear infant, wilt go with me there?
My daughters shall tend thee with sisterly care;
My daughters by night their glad festival keep,
They'll dance thee, and rock thee, and sing thee to sleep."

"My father, my father, and dost thou not see,
How the Erl-King his daughters has brought here for me?"
"My darling, my darling, I see it aright,
'Tis the aged grey willows deceiving thy sight."

"I love thee, I'm charm'd by thy beauty, dear boy!
And if thou'rt unwilling, then force I'll employ."
"My father, my father, he seizes me fast,
For sorely the Erl-King has hurt me at last."

The father now gallops, with terror half wild,
He grasps in his arms the poor shuddering child;
He reaches his courtyard with toil and with dread, –
The child in his arms finds he motionless, dead.&lt;/poem&gt;

== The legend ==
The story of the Erlkönig derives from the traditional Danish ballad ''[[Elveskud]]'': Goethe's poem was inspired by [[Johann Gottfried Herder]]'s translation of a variant of the ballad ([[Danmarks gamle Folkeviser|Danmarks gamle Folkeviser 47B]], from Peter Syv's 1695 edition) into German as {{Lang|de|Erlkönigs Tochter}} ("The Erl-king's Daughter") in his collection of folk songs, {{Lang|de|Stimmen der Völker in Liedern}} (published 1778). Goethe's poem then took on a life of its own, inspiring the Romantic concept of the [[Erlking]]. [[Niels Gade]]'s cantata {{Lang|da|[[Elverskud]]}}, Op. 30 (1854, text by {{ill|Chr. K. F. Molbech|da|Chr. K.F. Molbech}}) was published in translation as {{Lang|de|Erlkönigs Tochter}}.

The Erlkönig's nature has been the subject of some debate. The name translates literally from the German as "[[Alder]] King" rather than its common English translation, "[[Elf]] King" (which would be rendered as ''Elfenkönig'' in German). It has often been suggested that ''Erlkönig'' is a mistranslation from the original [[Danish language|Danish]] ''elverkonge'', which does mean "king of the elves."

In the original Scandinavian version of the tale, the antagonist was the Erlkönig's daughter rather than the Erlkönig himself; the female elves or Danish ''elvermøer'' sought to ensnare human beings to satisfy their desire, jealousy and lust for revenge.

== Settings to music ==
The poem has often been set to music with [[Franz Schubert]]'s rendition, his Opus&amp;nbsp;1 (D.&amp;nbsp;328), being the best known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Lawrence |last=Snyder |title=German Poetry in Song |publisher=Fallen Leaf Press |location=Berkeley |year=1995 |isbn=0-914913-32-8}} contains a selective list of 14 settings of the poem&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lieder.net/lieder/get_text.html?TextId=6381|title=Wer reitet so spät durch Nacht und Wind?|publisher=The LiederNet Archive|accessdate=8 October 2008}} lists 23 settings of the poem&lt;/ref&gt; Probably the next best known is that of [[Carl Loewe]] (1818). Other notable settings are by members of Goethe's circle, including the actress [[Corona Schröter]] (1782), [[Andreas Romberg]] (1793), [[Johann Friedrich Reichardt]] (1794) and [[Carl Friedrich Zelter]] (1797). [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] attempted to set it to music but abandoned the effort; his sketch however was complete enough to be published in a completion by Reinhold Becker (1897). A few other nineteenth-century versions are those by [[Václav Tomášek]] (1815) and [[Louis Spohr]] (1856, with [[obbligato]] violin) and [[Heinrich Wilhelm Ernst]] (Polyphonic Studies for Solo Violin). 21st century examples are pianist [[Marc-André Hamelin]]'s "Etude No. 8 (after Goethe)" for solo piano, based on "Erlkönig".&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=6HmwOceHQWg|title=Hamelin's "Erlkönig"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Franz Schubert composition ===
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Schubert - Schumann-Heink - Erlkönig.ogg|title="Erlkönig"|description=[[Ernestine Schumann-Heink]]}}
[[File:ErlkoenigSchubertManuscriptPage.png|thumb|Schubert's autograph of a simplified accompaniment to his "Erlkönig", one of several revisions]]
[[Franz Schubert]] composed his [[Lied]] "Erlkönig" for solo voice and piano in 1815, setting text from Goethe's poem. Schubert revised the song three times before publishing his fourth version in 1821 as his [[Opus number|Opus]] 1; it was catalogued by [[Otto Erich Deutsch]] as D.&amp;nbsp;328 in his 1951 catalog of Schubert's works. The song was first performed in concert on 1 December 1820 at a private gathering in Vienna and received its public premiere on 7 March 1821 at Vienna's [[Theater am Kärntnertor]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}.

The four characters in the song – narrator, father, son, and the Erlking – are all sung by a single vocalist. Schubert placed each character largely in a different vocal range, and each has his own rhythmic nuances; in addition, most singers endeavor to use a different vocal coloration for each part.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

#The Narrator lies in the middle range and begins in the minor mode.
#The Father lies in the lower range and sings in both minor and major mode.
#The Son lies in a higher range, also in the minor mode.
#The Erlking's vocal line, in the major mode, provides the only break from the [[ostinato]] bass [[Tuplet|triplets]] in the accompaniment until the boy's death.

A fifth character, the horse, is implied in rapid triplet figures played by the pianist throughout the work, mimicking hoof beats.&lt;ref&gt;Machlis, Joseph and Forney, Kristine. "Schubert and the Lied" ''The Enjoyment of Music: An Introduction to Perceptive Listening''. 9th Ed. [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]]: 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

"Erlkönig" starts with the piano playing rapid triplets to create a sense of urgency and simulate the horse's galloping. The left hand of the piano part introduces a low-register [[leitmotif]] composed of rising [[Scale (music)|scale]] in triplets and a falling [[arpeggio]]. The [[moto perpetuo]] triplets continue throughout the entire song except for the final three bars, and mostly comprise the uninterrupted repeated chords or octaves in the right hand, established at the opening. Significantly, the Erlkönig's verses differ in their accompanying figurations (providing some relief for the pianist) but are still based on triplets.

Each of the Son's pleas becomes higher in pitch. Near the end of the piece, the music quickens and then slows as the Father spurs his horse to go faster and then arrives at his destination. The absence of the piano creates multiple effects on the text and music. The silence draws attention to the dramatic text and amplifies the immense loss and sorrow caused by the Son's death.

The song has a tonal scheme based on rising semitones which portrays the increasingly desperate situation:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Verse !! Tonality !! Character
|-
| 1 || '''G minor''' || Narrator
|-
| 2 || G minor -&gt; B-flat major || Father &amp; Son
|-
| 3 || '''B-flat major''' || Erl-King
|-
| 4 || (D7) -&gt; '''B minor''' || Son
|-
| || -&gt; G major || Father
|-
| 5 || '''C major''' || Erl-King
|-
| 6 || (E7) -&gt; '''C-sharp minor''' || Son
|-
| || '''D minor''' || Father 
|-
| 7 || E-flat major -&gt; D minor || Erl-King
|-
| || (F7) -&gt; G minor || Son
|-
| 8 || '''G minor''' || Narrator
|}

The 'Mein Vater, mein Vater' music appears three times on a prolonged dominant 7th chord that slips chromatically into the next key. Following the tonal scheme, each cry is a semitone higher than the last, and, as in Goethe's poem, the time between the second two cries is less than the first two, increasing the urgency like a large-scale [[stretto]].  Much of the major-key music is coloured by the flattened [[submediant]], giving it a darker, unsettled sound.

The piece is regarded as extremely challenging to perform due to the multiple characters the vocalist is required to portray, as well as its difficult accompaniment, involving rapidly repeated chords and octaves which contribute to the drama and urgency of the piece.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

"Erlkönig" is [[through-composed]]; although the melodic motives recur, the harmonic structure is constantly changing and the piece modulates within characters. The rhythm of the piano accompaniment also changes within the characters. The first time the Erl-king sings in measure 57, the galloping motive disappears. However, when the Erlking sings again in measure 87, the piano accompaniment plays arpeggios rather than chords.

"Erlkönig" has been transcribed for various settings: for solo piano by [[Franz Liszt]]; for solo voice and orchestra by [[Hector Berlioz]], Franz Liszt and [[Max Reger]]; for solo violin by [[Heinrich Wilhelm Ernst]].

=== The Carl Loewe composition ===
[[Carl Loewe]]'s setting was published as Op.&amp;nbsp;1, No.&amp;nbsp;3 and composed in 1817–18, in the lifetime of the poem's author and also of Schubert, whose version Loewe did not then know. Collected with it were Op.&amp;nbsp;1, No.&amp;nbsp;1, "Edward" (1818; a translation of [[Edward (ballad)|the Scottish ballad]]), and No.&amp;nbsp;2, "{{Lang|de|Der Wirthin Töchterlein|italic=no}}" (1823; "The Innkeeper's Daughter"), a poem of [[Ludwig Uhland]]. Inspired by a German translation of Scottish border ballads, Loewe set several poems with an [[Elf|elvish]] theme; but although all three of Op.&amp;nbsp;1 are concerned with untimely death, in this set only the "Erlkönig" has the supernatural element.

Loewe's accompaniment is in semiquaver groups of six in 9/8 time and marked {{Lang|de|Geschwind}} (fast). The vocal line evokes the galloping effect by repeated figures of crotchet and quaver, or sometimes three quavers, overlying the binary tremolo of the semiquavers in the piano. In addition to an unusual sense of motion, this creates a flexible template for the stresses in the words to fall correctly within the rhythmic structure.

Loewe's version is less melodic than Schubert's, with an insistent, repetitive harmonic structure between the opening minor key and answering phrases in the major key of the dominant, which have a stark quality owing to their unusual relationship to the home key. The narrator's phrases are echoed by the voices of father and son, the father taking up the deeper, rising phrase, and the son a lightly undulating, answering theme around the dominant fifth. These two themes also evoke the rising and moaning of the wind.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} The Erl-king, who is always heard [[Dynamics (music)|pianissimo]], does not sing melodies, but instead delivers insubstantial rising arpeggios that outline a single major chord (that of the home key) which sounds simultaneously on the piano in ''una corda'' [[tremolo]]. Only with his final threatening word, "Gewalt", does he depart from this chord. Loewe's implication is that the Erlking has no substance, but merely exists in the child's feverish imagination. As the piece progresses, the first in the groups of three quavers is dotted to create a breathless pace, which then forms a bass figure in the piano driving through to the final crisis. The last words, {{Lang|de|war tot}}, leap from the lower dominant to the sharpened third of the home key; this time not to the major but to a diminished chord, which settles chromatically through the home key in the major and then to the minor.

'''''Extinct''''' was a [[Channel 4]] [[TV]] series, that originally aired between 25 September to 30 October 2001. There were 6 episodes.

==Episodes==
'''1. [[Dodo]]'''

This episode recounts how the [[dodo]] became extinct. It starts with the introduction of people on the island of [[Mauritius]]. Animals are soon introduced that make life harder for the already endangered dodos. The settlers even tried to eat a dodo, but it was too chewy and tasted horrible. The episode explains how the dodo bred as well and recreates a flock of them eating [[fruit]] and [[snail]]s, however, overhunting and competition with pigs, macaques, rats, and dogs finally destroyed the dodo forever.

'''2. [[Sabre-tooth cat]]'''

The episode commences at the [[La Brea Tar Pits]] in [[California]], USA. Hundreds of bones from sabre-tooth cats (also known as ''[[Smilodon]]'') and other animals are shown and the process of how they became stuck in the [[tar]] is explained. The program then describes how life was for the sabre-tooth cat in the [[Ice Age]]. It explains how the climate warmed up and the [[woodland]] forests that the sabre-tooth depended on for cover when stalking prey disappeared. It shows a mother sabre-tooth trying to hunt for her two cubs, but fails due to the open spaces and more numerous [[bison]] herds. Starving, she abandons her cubs (in doing so, will never reproduce again) and goes for the easiest prey, dead animals in the tar pit. Her hunger overpowers her sense of caution and drives her to the edge of the black abyss...

'''3. The [[Great Auk]]'''

This episode discusses the tragedy of the [[great auk]], a [[puffin]]-like seabird killed by Europeans. Features a seabird [[ecologist]], Dr [[Bill Montevecchi]].

'''4. The [[Irish Elk]]'''

The Irish elk (also known as ''[[Megaloceros]]'') was hunted to extinction by early man. This episode describes how overhunting and climate change killed this wonderful creature.

'''5. The [[Columbian mammoth|Mammoth]]'''

The [[mammoth]] is one of the most iconic extinct creatures. The episode features [[palaeontologist]] [[Sylvia Gonzalez]] and describes how disease and overhunting killed a whole family of [[Columbian mammoth]]s in [[Toquila]], [[Mexico]]. The family was buried in a mass grave and ranged from babies to adults. The end of the [[Ice Age]] was also a major factor contributing to their extinction. Lush grasses began to be less common, and the pine trees that replaced them didn't have enough nutrients to sustain a mammoth's huge appetite. Thus, they were partially starved into extinction.

'''6. The [[Thylacine|Tasmanian Tiger]]'''

Perhaps the saddest extinction of all, this depressing episode tells the story of how one gunshot in Wilfrid Batty's gun not only ended the life of one of the last [[Thylacine|Tasmanian tiger]]s but sounded the death knell for the entire species. The program covers basic anatomy of the marsupial and shows it hunting in the wild. It also shows actual footage of the animal in [[zoo]]s. It is explained that the tiger's disappearance was due to the bounty system, in which the government paid everyone who killed a Tasmanian tiger 1 pound. When it was realized that the animal was becoming extinct, there was a rush to catch every last one and put them in zoos. Most zoo specimens died by the 1930s. The last tiger ever seen was "Ben", in Hobart Zoo. There were two final twists to this tale: "Ben" wasn't a male thylacine and, when she died in September 1936, "Ben" had endured her last 59 days as a protected species.

'''FIND® technology''' is a [[directed evolution]] technology that uses [[Recombinant DNA|DNA recombination]] to improve properties of [[proteins]]. It eliminates unimportant and deleterious [[mutations]] while maintaining and combining beneficial mutations that would enhance protein function.

==Procedures==
For the relevant gene, a library of single stranded oligonucleotides is acquired and then mutated using random [[mutagenesis]].  The newly mutated library is then subjected to exonuclease activity, creating both sense and anti-sense fragments. The areas of partially overlapping fragments are then combined and extended using a [[PCR]]-like method.  These double stranded mutants are then screened for the desired optimized function using a relevant assay.  The best mutants are chosen for further [[exonuclease]] activity. The process (exonuclease, PCR-like recombination, and mutant screening) is repeated, usually about 10-12 times, in order to achieve the best possible mutants with only beneficial mutations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent| country = US| number= 7262012| status= patent| title= Method for in vitro molecular evolution of protein function using varied exonuclease digestion in two polynucleotide populations| gdate= 2007-08-28| fdate= 2003-05-16| inventor= Furebring C, Carlsson R, Borrebaeck C, Hager A| assign1= Alligator Bioscience AB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==

===CHIPS===
CHIPS is a protein that inhibits immune cell activation normally associated with inflammation.  CHIPS has potential as an anti-inflammatory agent, but native CHIP has been associated with activation and interaction with antibodies.  FIND® technology was used to create a truncated, yet functional mutant of this protein with reduced antibody interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://peds.oxfordjournals.org/content/23/2/91.short |title=Directed evolution of chemotaxis inhibitory protein of Staphylococcus aureus generates biologically functional variants with reduced interaction with human antibodies |vauthors=Gustafsson E, Rosén A, Barchan K, van Kessel K, Haraldsson K, Lindman S, Forsberg C, Ljung L, Bryder K, Walse B, Haas P, van Strijp J, Furebring C |journal=[[Protein Engineering Design and Selection (journal)|Protein Engineering Design and Selection]] |date=23 September 2010 |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=91–101 |doi=10.1093/protein/gzp062}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In: Inauguration d'une plaque à la mémoire de Gabriel Lippmann par le Centre culturel et d'éducation populaire de Bonnevoie et la Section des sciences de l'Institut grand-ducal. Bonnevoie, le 13 avril 1984: 8-20.&lt;!-- But what is this? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (16 August 1845 – 13 July 1921) was a [[France|Franco]]-[[Luxembourg]]ish [[physicist]] and [[inventor]], and [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel laureate in physics]] for his method of reproducing [[colour photography|colours photographically]] based on the phenomenon of [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]]. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/biography/Gabriel-Lippmann#ref78915&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Gabriel Lippmann was born in [[Bonnevoie]], Luxembourg (Luxembourgish: Bouneweg), on 16 August 1845. At the time, Bonnevoie was part of the commune of [[Hollerich]]  (Luxembourgish: Hollerech) which is often given as his place of birth. (Both places, Bonnevoie and Hollerich, are now districts of Luxembourg City.) His father, Isaïe, a French Jew born in [[Ennery, Moselle|Ennery]] near [[Metz]], managed the family glove-making business at the former convent in Bonnevoie. In 1848, the family moved to [[Paris]] where Lippmann was initially tutored by his mother, Miriam Rose (Lévy), before attending the Lycée Napoléon (now [[Lycée Henri-IV]]).&lt;ref name="Nobel Foundation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1908/lippmann-bio.html|title=Gabriel Lippmann|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Nobel Foundation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405091837/http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1908/lippmann-bio.html|archive-date=5 April 2016|dead-url=No|accessdate=2010-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was said to have been a rather inattentive but thoughtful pupil with a special interest in mathematics. In 1868, he was admitted to the [[École Normale Supérieure|École normale supérieure]] in Paris where he failed the [[agrégation]] examination which would have enabled him to enter the teaching profession, preferring instead to study physics. In 1872, the French government sent him on a mission to [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg University]] where he was able to specialize in electricity with the encouragement of Gustav Kirchhoff, receiving a doctorate with "summa cum laude" distinction in 1874.&lt;ref name="Bintz"&gt;[http://massard.info/pdf/lippmann_livre.pdf Jacques Bintz, "Gabriel Lippmann 1845–1921"], in ''Gabriel Lippmann: Commémoration par la section des sciences naturelles, physiques et mathématiques de l’Institut grand-ducal de Luxembourg du 150e anniversaire du savant né au Luxembourg, lauréat du prix Nobel en 1908'' (Luxembourg: Section des sciences naturelles, physiques et mathématiques de l’Institut grand-ducal de Luxembourg en collaboration avec le Séminaire de mathématique et le Séminaire d’histoire des sciences et de la médecine du centre universitaire de Luxembourg, 1997), ''Jean-Paul Pier &amp; Jos. A. Massard: éditeurs'', Luxembourg 1997. Retrieved 4 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Lippmann then returned to Paris in 1875, where he continued to study until 1878, when he became professor of physics at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]].&lt;ref name=Eder668&gt;Josef Maria Eder, ''History of Photography,'' 4th ed.

==Career==
Lippmann made several important contributions to various branches of physics over the years.
[[File:Kapillarelektrometer.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Lippmann's electrometer (1872)]]

===The capillary electrometer===
One of Lippmann's early discoveries was the relationship between electrical and capillary phenomena which allowed him to develop a sensitive capillary electrometer, subsequently known as the [[Lippmann electrometer]] which was used in the first [[ECG]] machine. In a paper delivered to the Philosophical Society of Glasgow on 17 January 1883, John G. M'Kendrick described the apparatus as follows:

:Lippmann's  electrometer consists of a tube of ordinary glass, 1 metre long and 7 millimetres in diameter, open at both ends, and kept in the vertical position by a stout support. The lower end is drawn into a capillary point, until the diameter of the capillary is .005 of a millimetre. The tube is filled with mercury, and the capillary point is immersed in dilute sulphuric acid (1 to 6 of water in volume), and in the bottom of the vessel containing the acid there is a little more mercury. A platinum wire is put into connection with the mercury in each tube, and, finally, arrangements are made by which the capillary point can be seen with a microscope magnifying 250 diameters. Such an instrument is very sensitive; and Lippmann states that it is possible to determine a difference of potential so small as that of one 10,080th of a [[Daniell cell|Daniell]]. It is thus a very delicate means of observing and (as it can be graduated by a compensation-method) of measuring minute electromotive forces.&lt;ref&gt;John G. M'Kendrick, "Note on a Simple Form of Lippmann's Capillary Electrometer useful to Physiologists".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also a similar description in German at [http://www.retrobibliothek.de/retrobib/seite.html?id=118716 "Kapillārelektromēter]", ''Meyers Konversationslexikon'', Verlag des Bibliographischen Instituts, Leipzig und Wien, 1885-1892. Retrieved 5 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lippmann's PhD thesis, presented to the Sorbonne on 24 July 1875, was on [[electrocapillarity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.crpgl.lu/index.php?id=37&amp;L=2|title=About Gabriel Lippmann|last=|first=|date=|website=Centre de Recherche Public - Gabriel Lippmann|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722155007/http://www.crpgl.lu/index.php?id=37&amp;L=2|archive-date=22 July 2011|dead-url=Yes|access-date=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Piezoelectricity===
In 1881, Lippmann predicted the [[piezoelectricity|converse piezoelectric]] effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=G. |last=Lippmann|title=Principe de la conservation de l'électricité|journal=[[Annales de chimie et de physique]]|volume=24|page=145|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k348640|year=1881|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colour photography===
[[File:Lippmann photo flowers.jpg|thumb|left|A colour photograph made by Lippmann in the 1890s. It contains no pigments or dyes of any kind.]]
Above all, Lippmann is remembered as the inventor of a method for reproducing colours by photography, based on the [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference phenomenon]], which earned him the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for 1908.&lt;ref name="From Nobel Lectures 1921"/&gt;

In 1886, Lippmann's interest turned to a method of fixing the colours of the [[visible spectrum|solar spectrum]] on a [[photographic plate]]. On 2 February 1891, he announced to the Academy of Sciences: "I have succeeded in obtaining the image of the spectrum with its colours on a photographic plate whereby the image remains fixed and can remain in daylight without deterioration." By April 1892, he was able to report that he had succeeded in producing colour images of a stained glass window, a group of flags, a bowl of oranges topped by a red poppy and a multicoloured parrot. He presented his theory of colour photography using the interference method in two papers to the Academy, one in 1894, the other in 1906.&lt;ref name="Bintz"/&gt;

[[File:Standing wave.gif|thumb|right|300px|A standing wave. The red dots are the wave nodes]]

The [[interference (wave propagation)|interference phenomenon]] in optics occurs as a result of the [[wave propagation]] of [[light]]. When light of a given wavelength is reflected back upon itself by a mirror, [[standing wave]]s are generated, much as the ripples resulting from a stone dropped into still water create standing waves when reflected back by a surface such as the wall of a pool. In the case of ordinary [[coherence (physics)|incoherent]] light, the standing waves are distinct only within a microscopically thin volume of space next to the reflecting surface.

Lippmann made use of this phenomenon by projecting an image onto a special [[photographic plate]] capable of recording detail smaller than the [[wavelength]]s of visible light. The light passed through the supporting glass sheet into a very thin and nearly transparent [[photographic emulsion]] containing submicroscopically small [[silver halide]] grains. A temporary mirror of liquid mercury in intimate contact reflected the light back through the emulsion, creating standing waves whose [[node (physics)|nodes]] had little effect while their [[node (physics)|antinodes]] created a [[latent image]]. After [[photographic processing|development]], the result was a structure of [[Planar lamina|laminae]], distinct parallel layers composed of submicroscopic metallic silver grains, which was a permanent record of the standing waves. In each part of the image, the spacing of the laminae corresponded to the half-wavelengths of the light photographed.

The finished plate was illuminated from the front at a nearly [[perpendicular]] angle, using daylight or another source of white light containing the full range of wavelengths in the [[visible spectrum]]. At each point on the plate, light of approximately the same wavelength as the light which had generated the laminae was strongly reflected back toward the viewer. Light of other wavelengths which was not absorbed or scattered by the silver grains simply passed through the emulsion, usually to be absorbed by a black anti-reflection coating applied to the back of the plate after it had been developed. The wavelengths, and therefore the colours, of the light which had formed the original image were thus reconstituted and a full-colour image was seen.&lt;ref&gt;Bolas, T. et al: ''A Handbook of Photography in Colours'', Marion &amp; Co. (London, 1900):45-59 (Retrieved from archive.org on 11 February 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wall, E. J.: ''Practical Color Photography'', American Photographic Publishing Co. (Boston, 1922):185-199 (Retrieved from archive.org on 5 September 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Biedermann"&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/articles/biedermann/ Klaus Biedermann, "Lippmann's and Gabor's Revolutionary Approach to Imaging"], ''Nobelprize.org''. Retrieved 6 December 2010.
&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, the Lippmann process was not easy to use. Extremely fine-grained high-resolution [[photographic emulsion]]s are inherently much less light-sensitive than ordinary emulsions, so long exposure times were required. With a lens of large aperture and a very brightly sunlit subject, a camera exposure of less than one minute was sometimes possible, but exposures measured in minutes were typical. Pure spectral colours reproduced brilliantly, but the ill-defined broad bands of wavelengths reflected by real-world objects could be problematic. The process did not produce colour prints on paper and it proved impossible to make a good duplicate of a Lippmann colour photograph by rephotographing it, so each image was unique. A very shallow-angled prism was usually cemented to the front of the finished plate to deflect unwanted surface reflections, and this made plates of any substantial size impractical. The lighting and viewing arrangement required to see the colours to best effect precluded casual use. Although the special plates and a plate holder with a built-in mercury reservoir were commercially available for a few years circa 1900, even expert users found consistent good results elusive and the process never graduated from being a scientifically elegant laboratory curiosity. It did, however, stimulate interest in the further development of [[color photography|colour photography]].&lt;ref name="Biedermann"/&gt;

Lippmann's process foreshadowed [[laser]] [[holography]], which is also based on recording standing waves in a photographic medium. [[Yuri Nikolaevich Denisyuk|Denisyuk]] reflection holograms, often referred to as Lippmann-Bragg holograms, have similar laminar structures that preferentially reflect certain wavelengths. In the case of actual multiple-wavelength colour holograms of this type, the colour information is recorded and reproduced just as in the Lippmann process, except that the highly coherent laser light passing through the recording medium and reflected back from the subject generates the required distinct standing waves throughout a relatively large volume of space, eliminating the need for reflection to occur immediately adjacent to the recording medium. Unlike Lippmann colour photography, however, the lasers, the subject and the recording medium must all be kept stable to within one quarter of a wavelength during the exposure in order for the standing waves to be recorded adequately or at all.

===Integral photography===

In 1908, Lippmann introduced [[integral imaging|integral photography]], in which a plane array of closely spaced small lenses is used to photograph a scene, recording images of the scene as it appears from many slightly different horizontal and vertical locations. When the resulting images are rectified and viewed through a similar array of lenses, a single integrated image, composed of small portions of all the images, is seen by each eye. The position of the eye determines which parts of the small images it sees. The effect is that the visual geometry of the original scene is reconstructed, so that the limits of the array seem to be the edges of a window through which the scene appears life-size and in three dimensions, realistically exhibiting parallax and perspective shift with any change in the position of the observer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lippmann|first=G.|title=Épreuves réversibles. Photographies intégrales|journal=Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences|volume=146|issue=9|pages=446–451|date=2 March 1908|nopp=}} Reprinted in Benton "Selected Papers on Three-Dimensional Displays".&lt;/ref&gt; This principle of using numerous lenses or imaging apertures to record what was later termed a [[light field]] underlies the evolving technology of [[Light-field camera|light-field cameras and microscopes]].

===Measurement of time===

In 1895, Lippmann evolved a method of eliminating the [[personal equation]] in measurements of time, using photographic registration, and he studied the eradication of irregularities of [[pendulum clock]]s, devising a method of comparing the times of oscillation of two pendulums of nearly equal period.&lt;ref name="Nobel Foundation" /&gt;

===The coelostat===

Lippmann also invented the [[Solar telescope|coelostat]], an astronomical tool that compensated for the Earth's rotation and allowed a region of the sky to be photographed without apparent movement.&lt;ref name="Nobel Foundation" /&gt;

==Academic affiliations==
Lippmann was a member of the [[French Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences]] from 8 February 1886 until his death, serving as its President in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.academie-sciences.fr/membres/in_memoriam/in_memoriam_liste_alphabetique_L.htm |title=Les Membres de l'Académie des sciences depuis sa création (en 1666) |publisher=Académie des sciences |language=French |accessdate=2008-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302065459/http://www.academie-sciences.fr/MEMBRES/in_memoriam/in_memoriam_liste_alphabetique_L.htm |archivedate=2 March 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he was a [[Foreign Member of the Royal Society|Foreign Member]] of the [[Royal Society|Royal Society of London]], a member of the [[Bureau des Longitudes]],&lt;ref name="Nobel Foundation" /&gt; and a member of the [[Grand Ducal Institute]] of Luxembourg. He became a member of the [[Société française de photographie]] in 1892 and its president from 1896 to 1899.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elysee.ch/index.php?id=120&amp;L=1/%27/x26no/x5fcache/x3d1/%27/x26no/x5fcache/x3d1&amp;tx_ttnews%5BpS%5D=1242097849&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=6&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=119&amp;cHash=e78b4dabd2 Daniel Girardin, "La photographie interférentielle de Lippmann, méthode parfaite et oubliée de reproduction des couleurs"]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, published in DU, die Zeitschrift der Kultur, no 708 : Fotografie, der lange Weg zur Farbe, Juillet-août 2000.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12300">'''Group method of data handling (GMDH)''' is a family of inductive algorithms for computer-based mathematical modeling of multi-parametric datasets that features fully automatic structural and parametric optimization of models.

GMDH is used in such fields as [[data mining]], [[knowledge discovery]], [[forecasting|prediction]], [[complex systems]] modeling, [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] and [[pattern recognition]]. Li et. al. (2017)'s results showed that GMDH neural network performed better than the classical forecasting algorithms such as Single Exponential Smooth, Double Exponential Smooth, ARIMA and back-propagation neural network. &lt;ref&gt; Li, Rita Yi Man, Fong, S., Chong, W.S. (2017) Forecasting the REITs and stock indices: Group Method of Data Handling Neural Network approach, Pacific Rim Property Research Journal, 23(2), 1-38, http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/citedby/10.1080/14445921.2016.1225149?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true &lt;/ref&gt;

GMDH algorithms are characterized by inductive procedure that performs sorting-out of gradually complicated polynomial  models and selecting the best solution by means of the so-called ''external criterion''.

A GMDH model with multiple inputs and one output is a subset of components of the ''base function'' (1):
 
: &lt;math&gt; Y(x_1,\dots,x_n)=a_0+\sum\limits_{i = 1}^m a_i f_i&lt;/math&gt;

where ''f'' are elementary functions dependent on different sets of inputs, ''a'' are coefficients  and ''m'' is the number of the base function components.

In order to find the best solution GMDH algorithms consider various component subsets of the base function (1) called ''partial models''. Coefficients of these models are estimated by the [[least squares]] method. GMDH algorithms gradually increase the number of partial model components and find a model structure with optimal complexity indicated by the minimum value of an ''external criterion''. This process is called self-organization of models.

The most popular  base function used in GMDH is the gradually complicated [[Wiener series|Kolmogorov-Gabor polynomial]] (2):

: &lt;math&gt; Y(x_1,\dots,x_n) = a_0+\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {a_i} x_i+\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n 
{\sum\limits_{j = i}^n {a_{i j} } } x_i x_j+\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n 
{\sum\limits_{j = i}^n{\sum\limits_{k = j}^n {a_{i j k} } } }x_i x_j x_k+\cdots &lt;/math&gt;

The resulting models are also known as '''polynomial neural networks'''. [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]] cites GMDH as one of the earliest [[deep learning]] methods, remarking that it was used to train eight-layer neural nets as early as 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schmidhuber |first=Jürgen |title=Deep learning in neural networks: An overview |journal=Neural Networks |volume=61 |year=2015 |pages=85–117 |arxiv=1404.7828 |doi=10.1016/j.neunet.2014.09.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Photo of Prof. Alexey G. Ivakhnenko.jpg|right|thumb|GMDH author - Soviet scientist Prof. Alexey G. Ivakhnenko.]]
The method was originated in 1968 by Prof. [[Alexey Grigorevich Ivakhnenko|Alexey G. Ivakhnenko]] in the Institute of Cybernetics in [[Kiev]] (then in the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]]).
This approach from the very beginning was a computer-based method so, a set of computer programs and algorithms were the primary practical results achieved at the base of the new theoretical principles. Thanks to the author's policy of open code sharing the method was quickly settled in the large number of scientific laboratories worldwide. At that time code sharing was quite a physical action since the Internet is at least 5 years younger than GMDH. Despite this fact the first investigation of GMDH outside the Soviet Union had been made soon by R.Shankar in 1972. Later on different GMDH variants were published by Japanese and Polish scientists.

'''Period 1968-1971''' is characterized by application of only regularity criterion for solving of the problems of identification, pattern recognition and short-term forecasting. As reference functions polynomials, logical nets, fuzzy Zadeh sets and Bayes probability formulas were used. Authors were stimulated by very high accuracy of forecasting with the new approach. Noiseimmunity was not investigated.

'''Period 1972-1975'''. The problem of modeling of noised data and incomplete information basis was solved. Multicriteria selection and utilization of additional priory information for noiseimmunity increasing were proposed. Best experiments showed that with extended definition of the optimal model by additional criterion noise level can be ten times more than signal. Then it was improved using [[Shannon's Theorem]] of General Communication theory.

'''Period 1976-1979'''. The convergence of multilayered GMDH algorithms was investigated. It was shown that some multilayered algorithms have "multilayerness error" - analogous to static error of control systems. In 1977 a solution of objective systems analysis problems by multilayered GMDH algorithms was proposed. It turned out that sorting-out by criteria ensemble finds the only optimal system of equations and therefore to show complex object elements, their main input and output variables.

'''Period 1980-1988'''. Many important theoretical results were received. It became clear that full physical models cannot be used for long-term forecasting. It was proved, that non-physical models of GMDH are more accurate for approximation and forecast than physical models of regression analysis. Two-level algorithms which use two different time scales for modeling were developed.

'''Since 1989''' the new algorithms (AC, OCC, PF) for non-parametric modeling of fuzzy objects and SLP for expert systems were developed and investigated. Present stage of GMDH development can be described as blossom out of twice-multilayered neuronets and parallel combinatorial algorithms for multiprocessor computers.

== External criteria ==

External criterion is one of the key features of GMDH. Criterion describes requirements to the model, for example minimization of [[Least squares]]. It is always calculated with a separate part of data sample that have not been used for estimation of coefficients. There are several popular criteria:

* Criterion of Regularity (CR) - [[Least squares]] of a model at the sample B.  
* Criterion of Unbiasedness - Sum of CR value and special CR for which A is B and B is A. Ratio of sample lengthes must be 1:1 i.e. size of A must be the same as size of B. 
 
If a criterion does not define the number of observations for external dataset then the problem of data dividing ratio appears because the forecasting abilities of identified model are very dependent on the dividing ratio.

== A simple description of model development using GMDH ==

For modeling using GMDH, first, the number of inputs for each neuron, polynomial power and input sources of layers after the first layer are decided. Then, the design process begins from the first layer and goes on. All possible combinations of allowable inputs (all possible neurons) are considered. Then polynomial coefficients are determined using one of the available minimizing methods such as singular value decom-position (with training data). Then, neurons that have better external criterion (for testing data) are kept, and others are removed (The input data for development of the model were divided into training and testing groups). If the external criterion for layer’s best neuron surpasses the stopping criterion, network design is completed and the polynomial expression of the best neuron of the last layer is introduced as the math-ematical prediction function; if not, the next layer will be generated, and this process goes on &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sohani|first=Ali|last2=Sayyaadi|first2=Hoseyn|last3=Hoseinpoori|first3=Sina|date=2016-09-01|title=Modeling and multi-objective optimization of an M-cycle cross-flow indirect evaporative cooler using the GMDH type neural network|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140700716301165|journal=International Journal of Refrigeration|volume=69|pages=186–204|doi=10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2016.05.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==GMDH-type neural networks==

There are many different ways to choose an order for partial models consideration. The very first consideration order used in GMDH and originally called multilayered inductive procedure is the most popular one. It is a sorting-out of gradually complicated models generated from Kolmogorov-Gabor polynomial. The best model is indicated by the minimum of the external criterion characteristic. Multilayered procedure is equivalent to the [[Artificial Neural Network]] with polynomial activation function of neurons. Therefore, the algorithm with such an approach usually referred as GMDH-type Neural Network or Polynomial Neural Network.

==Combinatorial GMDH==
[[Image:Combinatorial_GMDH_optimal_complexity.png|right|thumb|Fig.1. A typical distribution of minimal values of criterion of regularity for Combinatorial GMDH models with different complexity.]]

Another important approach to partial models consideration that becomes more and more popular is a brute force combinatorial search that is either limited or full. This approach has some advantages against Polynomial Neural Networks but requires considerable computational power and thus is not effective for objects with more than 30 inputs in case of full search. An important achievement of Combinatorial GMDH is that it fully outperforms linear regression approach if noise level in the input data is greater than zero.

Basic combinatorial algorithm makes the following steps:

* Divides data sample onto parts A and B. 
* Generates structures for partial models.   
* Estimates coefficients of partial models using [[Least squares]] method and sample A.
* Calculates value of external criterion for partial models using sample B.
* Chooses the best model (set of models) indicated by minimal value of the criterion.

In contrast to GMDH-type neural networks Combinatorial algorithm can't be stopped at the certain level of complexity because a point of increase of criterion value can be simply a local minimum, see Fig.1.

Namely if ''&amp;fnof;'' possesses a Herman ring ''U'' with period ''p'', then there exists a [[conformal mapping]]

:&lt;math&gt;\phi:U\rightarrow\{\zeta:0&lt;r&lt;|\zeta|&lt;1\}&lt;/math&gt;

and an [[irrational number]] &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, such that

:&lt;math&gt;\phi\circ f^{\circ p}\circ\phi^{-1}(\zeta)=e^{2\pi i\theta}\zeta.&lt;/math&gt;

So the dynamics on the Herman ring is simple.

==Name==
It was introduced by, and later named after, Michael Herman (1979&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Herman | first1=Michael-Robert | title=Sur la conjugaison différentiable des difféomorphismes du cercle à des rotations | url=http://www.numdam.org/item?id=PMIHES_1979__49__5_0 | mr=538680 | year=1979 | journal=[[Publications Mathématiques de l'IHÉS]] | issn=1618-1913 | issue=49 | pages=5–233}}&lt;/ref&gt;) who first found and constructed this type of Fatou component.

* Rational functions can have Herman rings
* Transcendental entire maps do not have them&lt;ref&gt;Omitted Values and Herman rings by Tarakanta Nayak.{{full|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Here is an example of a rational function which possesses a Herman ring.&lt;ref name=dyn/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;f(z) = \frac{e^{2 \pi i \tau} z^2(z - 4)}{1 - 4z}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\tau=0.6151732\dots&lt;/math&gt; such that the [[rotation number]] of ''&amp;fnof;'' on the
unit circle is &lt;math&gt;(\sqrt{5}-1)/2&lt;/math&gt;.

The picture shown on the right is the [[Julia set]] of ''&amp;fnof;'': the curves in the white annulus are the orbits of some points under the iterations of ''&amp;fnof;'' while the dashed line denotes the unit circle.

There is an example of rational function that possesses a Herman ring, and some [[Classification of Fatou components|periodic parabolic Fatou components]] at the same time.
[[Image:Herman+Parabolic.png|600px|center|thumb|A rational function &lt;math&gt;f_{t,a,b}(z)=e^{2\pi it}z^3\,\frac{1-\overline{a}z}{z-a}\,\frac{1-\overline{b}z}{z-b}&lt;/math&gt; that possesses a Herman ring and some periodic parabolic Fatou components, where &lt;math&gt;t=0.6141866\dots,\,a=1/4,\,b=0.0405353-0.0255082i&lt;/math&gt; such that the rotation number of &lt;math&gt;f_{t,a,b}&lt;/math&gt; on the unit circle is &lt;math&gt;(\sqrt{5}-1)/2&lt;/math&gt;. The image has been rotated.]]

Further, there is a rational function which possesses a Herman ring with period 2.
[[Image:Herman period=2.png|600px|center|thumb|A rational function possesses Herman rings with period 2]]
Here the expression of this rational function is

:&lt;math&gt; g_{a,b,c}(z) = \frac{z^2(z-a)}{z-b} + c, \, &lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
a &amp; = 0.17021425+0.12612303i, \\
b &amp; = 0.17115266+0.12592514i, \\
c &amp; = 1.18521775+0.16885254i.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

This example was constructed by quasiconformal surgery&lt;ref&gt;[[Mitsuhiro Shishikura]], [http://archive.numdam.org/article/ASENS_1987_4_20_1_1_0.pdf ''On the quasiconformal surgery of rational functions'']. Ann. Sci. Ecole Norm. Sup. (4) '''20''' (1987), no. 1, 1–29.&lt;/ref&gt;
from the quadratic polynomial

:&lt;math&gt;h(z)=z^2 - 1 - \frac{e^{\sqrt{5}\pi i}}{4} &lt;/math&gt;

which possesses a [[Siegel disk]] with period&amp;nbsp;2. The parameters ''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'',&amp;nbsp;''c'' are calculated by [[trial and error]].

Letting

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
a &amp; = 0.14285933+0.06404502i, \\
b &amp; = 0.14362386+0.06461542i,\text{ and} \\
c &amp; = 0.18242894+0.81957139i,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

then the period of one of the Herman ring of ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''a'',''b'',''c''&lt;/sub&gt; is&amp;nbsp;3.

[[Mitsuhiro Shishikura|Shishikura]] also given an example:&lt;ref&gt;[[Mitsuhiro Shishikura]], [http://repository.kulib.kyoto-u.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2433/99208/1/0574-13.pdf ''Surgery of complex analytic dynamical systems''], in "Dynamical Systems and Nonlinear Oscillations", Ed. by Giko Ikegami, World Scientific Advanced Series in Dynamical Systems, 1, World Scientific, 1986, 93–105.&lt;/ref&gt; a rational function which possesses a Herman ring with period 2, but the parameters showed above are different from his.

So there is a question: How to find the formulas of the rational functions which possess Herman rings with higher period?

According to the result of Shishikura, if a rational function ''&amp;fnof;'' possesses a Herman ring, then the degree of ''&amp;fnof;'' is at least&amp;nbsp;3. There also exist [[meromorphic function]]s that possess Herman rings.

Herman rings for transcendental meromorphic functions have been studied by  T. Nayak. According to a result of Nayak, if there is an omitted value for such a function then Herman rings of period 1 or 2 do not exist. Also, it is proved that if there is only a single pole and at least an omitted value, the function has no Herman ring of any period.

'''Jane Lesley Aagaard''' (born 1956) is a former [[Australia]]n politician. She was an [[Australian Labor Party (Northern Territory Branch)|Labor Party]] member of the [[Northern Territory Legislative Assembly]] from 2001 to 2012, representing the [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]]-based electorate of [[electoral division of Nightcliff|Nightcliff]]. She was the [[Speaker of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly|Speaker of the Assembly]] from June 2005 until October 2012—to date, the only Labor member ever to hold the post. Prior to holding the speakership, she had served as Health Minister from 2001 to 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.curriculum.edu.au/parl.php3?srch=parl&amp;list_params=gender%3D%26offices_held%3D%26party%3D%26parliament%3D%26surname%3DAagaard%26electorate%3D%26former_occupations%3D&amp;ID=612|title=Hon. Jane Lesley AAGAARD MLA|publisher=Australian Government|accessdate=2009-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Jane Aagaard was born in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] in 1956, to John Stuart McIntosh and Jean Brown. She moved to [[Brisbane]], [[Queensland]] at the age of seven, where she was educated at [[Somerville House]], a school for girls in [[South Brisbane]].&lt;ref name=Whoswho&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| editor = Suzannah Pearce| encyclopedia = Who's Who in Business Live!| title = AAGAARD Jane Lesley, Hon. |date=2006-11-17| publisher = Crown Content Pty Ltd| location = North Melbourne, Vic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, she accepted a position with the Northern Territory Department of Mines and Energy, and settled with her husband in Darwin.

Aagaard also became heavily involved in many aspects of the Darwin community. She helped found the [[Brolga Awards]] and [[Northern Territory Sports Awards]], and continued organising both presentations for several years. Not long before entering parliament, she had also organised the city's commemoration of its bombing by [[Japan]]ese forces during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Camden. "Aagaard to stand for Nightcliff seat". ''[[Northern Territory News]]'', 7 March 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

When former [[Chief Minister of the Northern Territory|Chief Minister]] [[Stephen Hatton]], the longtime [[Country Liberal Party|CLP]] member for Nightcliff, retired at the 2001 election, Aagaard ran as the Labor candidate against Hatton's son, Jason.  In a shock result, Aagaard won the seat on an unexpectedly large swing of 11.7 percent that saw the previously marginal Nightcliff technically become a safe Labor seat.  Aagaard's victory was part of a six-seat swing to Labor that saw the party win government for the first time ever, mainly on the strength of a strong performance in the Darwin area.  She was reelected in 2005, picking up a healthy swing of 8.5 percent

In March 2012, Aargard announced that she would not contest [[Northern Territory general election, 2012|the next election]] due to "ongoing medical issues that would require treatment and surgery".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntnews.com.au/article/2012/03/25/295785_ntnews.html |title=Speaker Aagaard to retire from politics |publisher=NT News |date=25 March 2012 |accessdate=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2012, Aargard was granted the title The Honourable for life.&lt;ref name=gazette&gt;[http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012G00283 Ms Jane Lesley Aagaard granted the title "Honourable" for life], ''Commonwealth Government Gazette'' C2012G00283, S No. 177 of 2012, 20 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Robert Edward Kinard''' (November 22, 1936 – August 5, 1989) was an American [[Activism|social activist]], [[pastor]], and [[museum]] director.  He is best known as the director of the [[Anacostia Museum]], a small community museum founded by the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in 1967. Kinard was the museum's first director, and remained in the post until his death.  The ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' said Kinard was "a passionate believer in the idea that the well-being of black people depends on having a record of their past".&lt;ref name="Obit"&gt;Smith, J. Y. "John R. Kinard, Director of Anacostia Museum, Dies." ''Washington Post.'' August 6, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;  Noted British archeologist and museologist Sir [[Kenneth Hudson]] said Kinard "developed the Anacostia Museum into one of the small number of museums of influence in the world."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Alexander, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Kinard was born in November 1936 in [[Southeast, Washington, D.C.]] to Robert Francis and Jessie Beulah (Covington) Kinard.&lt;ref name="Alexander"&gt;Alexander, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; He had a brother, William.&lt;ref name="Obit" /&gt; Kinard attended [[Dunbar High School (Washington, D.C.)|Dunbar High School]] but transferred and then graduated from [[Spingarn High School]] in 1955.&lt;ref name="Obit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Alexander" /&gt;  He attended [[Howard University]] in Washington, D.C., for a year and a half, but transferred to [[Livingstone College]] in [[Salisbury, North Carolina]].  He graduated with a [[bachelor's degree]] in 1960.  He subsequently enrolled at Hood Theological Seminary (then part of Livingstone College, but now a separate institution), earning a [[Bachelor of Divinity]] degree in 1963.&lt;ref name="Alexander" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douthis, p. 93; ''Smithsonian Opportunities for Research and Study in History, Art, Science'', p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Some sources vary as to the degree earned.  The ''Washington Post'' reported at his death that Kinard had earned a [[Master of Theology]] at Hood.  See: Smith, J. Y. "John R. Kinard, Director of Anacostia Museum, Dies." ''Washington Post.'' August 6, 1989.  However, the ''New York Times'' claimed it was a [[Master of Arts]].  See: "John R. Kinard, Museum Director, 53." ''New York Times.'' August 7, 1989. The majority of sources say it was a Bachelor of Divinity, which is the degree listed in the main text of this article.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, while attending Hood Theological Seminary, he joined [[Operation Crossroads Africa]] (a progenitor of the [[Peace Corps]]) and spent a summer building student housing and dining facilities in [[Tanzania]].&lt;ref name="Alexander" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Douthis92"&gt;Douthis, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. [[James Herman Robinson]], founder of Operation Crossroads, encouraged him to return to Africa.  Kinard did so after graduation, becoming a paid staff member of the organization.  He worked in [[Kenya]], Tanzania, and [[Zanzibar]]. He was later promoted to coordinator of all Operation Crossroads projects in eastern Africa (a region ranging from [[Cairo]] in the north to [[Zimbabwe]] in the south).&lt;ref name="Alexander" /&gt;

Kinard returned to Washington, D.C., in 1964.  He became a counselor with the [[Neighborhood Youth Corps]], a program established by the [[The Economic Opportunity Act of 1964|Economic Opportunity Act of 1964]] to provide work experience for at-risk African American youth and encourage them to stay in school.  He also worked for Southeast Neighborhood House, an organization founded by Dr. [[Dorothy Celeste Boulding Ferebee|Dorothy Ferebee]] to provide medical care and other services to poor African Americans living in Southeast Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="Alexander" /&gt;

Kinard married Marjorie Anne Williams on November 1, 1964.&lt;ref name="Alexander" /&gt;  The couple had three daughters: Sarah, Joy, and Hope.&lt;ref name="Douthis92" /&gt;

==Director of the Anacostia Museum==
In 1966, Kinard was appointed assistant pastor at John Wesley [[African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church]] in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="Alexander148"&gt;Alexander, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving Operations Crossroads Africa, Kinard joined the [[Office of Economic Opportunity]],&lt;ref name="Obit" /&gt; but quickly moved to the [[United States Department of State]] where he worked as an interpreter and escort for visiting African government officials. While at the State Department, Kinard became friends with the son of Marion Conover Hope.  Hope was a member of the Greater Anacostia People's Corporation, a group which was advocating for improved cultural institutions in the improverished areas of Washington, D.C., east of the [[Anacostia River]].&lt;ref name="Oral"&gt;[http://siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris_arc_217706?back=%2Fcollections%2Fsearch%3Ffacets%3DOH_Exh%26page%3D1%26perpage%3D10%26sort%3Drelevancy%26view%3Dlist "Oral History Interview With John R. Kinard, 1987." Record Unit 9538. Recorded 30 July 1987. Smithsonian Institution Archives.] Accessed 2012-02-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[S. Dillon Ripley]], Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, began pushing in 1966 for a new and innovative kind of Smithsonian museum.  Ripley conceived of a neighborhood or "storefront" museum that would be small, interactive, and focused on neighborhood issues.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, p. 147-148.&lt;/ref&gt; The Greater Anacostia People's Corp. had persuaded Ripley to put the first such neighborhood museum in Anacostia.  The abandoned Carver movie theater on Nichols Avenue SE (now [[Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue|Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue SE]]) was renovated and turned into the new museum.  Hope met Kinard through her son, and convinced Kinard to speak with Charles Blitzer, director of the Smithsonian's Office of Education and Training.  Blitzer was deeply impressed by Kinard, and asked him to meet with Ripley.  When Kinard walked into Ripley's office, Ripley thanked him for taking the job.  Shocked, Kinard nonetheless agreed to become the Anacostia Museum's director.&lt;ref name="Alexander148" /&gt; He later recalled, "I thought, what the hell. Everybody ought to take a leap once in their lives—just jump and not know where they'll land."&lt;ref name="Alexander148" /&gt;

Kinard was named director of the Anacostia Museum in July 1967. He held the position until his death in 1989.&lt;ref name="Obit" /&gt;

Under Kinard's leadership, the Anacostia Museum had 35 major exhibitions in its first eight years.  One of the early exhibitions, "Frederick Douglas, the Sage of Anacostia, 1817?-1895", was chosen to tour the United States by the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibit Service.&lt;ref name="Alexander150"&gt;Alexander, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;  Kinard's vision for the Anacostia Museum was that it could not be divorced from the problems of the neighborhood around it.&lt;ref name="Obit" /&gt; The exhibit "Lorton Reformatory: Beyond Time" highlighted the fact that many young African American men from the Southeast Washington were incarcerated at the prison, and documented their life there.  Another exhibit, "The Rat: Man's Invited Affliction", looked at the way rats have taken advantage of human living conditions to thrive and spread.  It identified ways in which people living in the Anacostia area could get rid of rats living in their homes.  It also included live rats running through part of the exhibit.&lt;ref name="Alexander150"&gt;Alexander, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; The museum later curated major exhibits on the problems of crime, the illegal drug trade, poor housing conditions, and lack of quality education in African American communities.&lt;ref name="Alexander151"&gt;Alexander, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, Kinard helped co-found the African American Museum Association (AAMA), an umbrella group which represented small local African American art, cultural, and history museums across the United States. He was its treasurer in 1982-1983,&lt;ref name="Alexander154"&gt;Alexander, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; and its president in 1987-1988.&lt;ref&gt;Ruffings, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; When a [[National Museum of African American History and Culture]] was being pushed in Congress during his term as president of the AAMA, Kinard strongly opposed the plan.  He argued that a national museum would consume donor dollars and out-bid local museums for artifacts and trained staff. Kinard and the AAMA demanded that Congress establish a $50 million fund to create a national foundation to support local black history museums as a means of mitigating these problems. Kinard would change his mind back and forth several times over the next two years.&lt;ref&gt;Ruffings, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; But shortly before he died, he told the ''Washington Post'' that he had come to strongly support the museum effort.  "My vision is that the Smithsonian Institution ought to take the lead in developing a national African American museum on the Mall. This is a critical thing. This is a life and death thing. Why do people shoot each other in the head, man? Because they don't have respect for human life. Because they don't have a respect for history that they can know and understand. They don't share a knowledge of history of America for themselves."&lt;ref name="Obit" /&gt;

Although not trained in history or museum [[curator]]ship, Kinard was well known as a museum director.  Tom Freudenheim, assistant secretary for museums at the Smithsonian Institution, said that under Kinard "the Anacostia Museum served as a model for a growing number of African American museums around the country—indeed for other ethnically oriented museums as well."&lt;ref name="Alexander154" /&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Kinard suffered from [[myelofibrosis]], a disease in which [[bone marrow]] cells become abnormal and create [[collagen]]ous connective tissue fibers rather than new bone marrow. Although he had been heavy-set most of his life, Kinard lost {{convert|60|lb|kg}} in the last few months of his life. He died on August 5, 1989, at [[Greater Southeast Community Hospital]] in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/07/obituaries/john-r-kinard-museum-director-53.html "John R. Kinard, Museum Director, 53." ''New York Times.'' August 7, 1989.] Accessed 2012-02-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview shortly before he died, Kinard delivered his own [[epitaph]]. "I believe it's God's will that I'm here. I'm a servant, and I follow. So when I shuffle off this mortal coil, if it can be said of me that 'he was a good servant,' that will be enough. Just to be a good servant is all I aspire to be."&lt;ref name="Obit" /&gt;

Livingstone College established the John R. Kinard Scholarship for Leadership and Academic Excellence in his honor.  The program awarded roughly $20,000 in scholarships in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salisburypost.com/News/052010-edu-livingstone-gala Willis, Laurie D.

'''Joyce Oransky''' (May 3, 1958 - July 22, 2003) was an American professional [[tennis]] player from the United States. She competed during her career under her maiden name '''Joyce Portman'''.

==Biography==
Portman played collegiate tennis for the [[University of Florida]], where she came to from [[Miami Beach Senior High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/302465192/|title='Little Willie' is plenty tough|date=May 14, 1975|work=[[The Miami News]]|page=29|accessdate=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She earned [[All-America]]n selection in 1979 and 1980, finishing with a 51-10 record.&lt;ref name="Orvieto"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gainesville.com/news/20060124/a-legacy-left-behind|title=A legacy left behind|last=Orvieto|first=Eric|date=January 24, 2006|work=[[Gainesville Sun]]|accessdate=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After her collegiate career she played on the professional circuit. She had her best year in 1981, when she was a semi-finalist at the [[1981 Italian Open (tennis)|Italian Open]] and made the quarter-finals of the [[1981 Family Circle Cup|Family Circle Cup]] on Hilton Head Island, in addition to making three [[Grand Slam (tennis)|grand slam]] main draws. At the [[1981 Wimbledon Championships]] she came up against [[Martina Navratilova]] in the first round and lost, but reached the third round of the [[1981 US Open (tennis)|1981 US Open]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/17069389/|title=Rinaldi wins at Wimbledon|date=June 24, 1981|work=[[The Galveston Daily News]]|page=16|accessdate=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She toured for the last time in 1982.

On July 22, 2003, at the age of 45, Portman died from a large blood clot in her heart. The following year a tennis complex at [[Westside Park]] in Gainesville was named the ''Joyce Oransky Tennis Center''.&lt;ref name="Orvieto"/&gt;

'''Liam Walsh''' (born 18 May 1986) is a British [[professional boxer]] who has challenged once for a world title in 2017. He held the [[Commonwealth Boxing Council|Commonwealth]] [[super-featherweight]] title from 2010 to 2017, and the [[British Boxing Board of Control|British]] super-featherweight title from 2014 to 2016. Liam has two brothers, both of whom are also professional boxers, most notably his twin [[Ryan Walsh]].

==Professional career==

=== Early career ===
Walsh made his professional boxing debut on 2 February 2008 alongside his twin brother, [[Ryan Walsh|Ryan]], and their elder brother, Michael. Boxing on the same bill as Olympic silver medalist [[Amir Khan (British boxer)|Amir Khan]] at London's Excel Arena, all three brothers scored winning debuts.

Liam Walsh faced journeyman Daniel Thorpe and made a quick start with a first round win. Speaking of his debut victory Walsh said ''"I knocked him down but he got back up. I caught him with a good right hand and I don't think he fancied the job after that."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/norfolk/content/articles/2008/02/05/sport_boxing_walshbrothers_20080502_feature.shtml BBC News: Boxing brothers have a right to remember]&lt;/ref&gt; Walsh followed up the victory with further wins in 2008 over journeymen Johnny Greaves and [[Youssef Al Hamidi]].  In 2009 Walsh defeated Shaun Walton, Baz Carey and Jon Baguley. In 2010 Walsh expanded his record to 9 wins against no defeats with victories over Sid Razak, Ibrar Riyaz and the Frenchman Sebastien Cornu.&lt;ref&gt;[http://boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=437195&amp;cat=boxer Liam Walsh's professional boxing record]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commonwealth super-featherweight champion===
On 23 October 2010 Walsh headlined a bill for the first time at the [[York Hall]] in [[Bethnal Green]]. The occasion was a challenge for the Commonwealth super-featherweight title recently vacated by Scotsman [[Ricky Burns]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportinglife.com/boxing/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=boxing/10/10/23/manual_210633.html Sporting Life: Perfect 10 for Walsh]&lt;/ref&gt;  Walsh defeated his co-challenger for the belt, the Ghanaian Maxwell Awuku who had had a record of 20 wins and one defeat before that fight, over the full 12 rounds in a grueling contest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/9124339.stm BBC Sport: Liam Walsh captures Commonwealth title]&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the victory, brothers Michael and Ryan had also scored wins on the bill defeating Ian Bailey and James Ancliff respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/sport/liam_walsh_is_commonwealth_champion_after_perfect_night_for_cromer_brothers_1_704266 Eveningnews24: Liam Walsh is Commonwealth champion in perfect night for brothers]&lt;/ref&gt;  On 20 March 2010 Walsh made his first successful defence of the title, traveling to Wigan to beat local man John Kays with a stoppage in the 9th round.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/9429240.stm BBC Sport | Liam Walsh beats John Kays to retain commonwealth title]&lt;/ref&gt;  The second defence of his title came on 30 September 2011 with Walsh meeting former British champion [[Paul Appleby (boxer)|Paul Appleby]] in a thrilling fight at the York Hall.  Despite winning in the tenth round Walsh had been knocked down and hurt in the seventh round and said afterwards that it was "definitely the hardest fight I've been in."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/9605065.stm BBC Sport | Liam Walsh retains title despite Appleby knockdown]&lt;/ref&gt;

Walsh was scheduled to fight in his first World title fight against WBO Lightweight Champion [[Ricky Burns]] on 15 December 2012 but had to withdraw from the fight due to injuries from being involved in a car crash.

===British super-featherweight champion===
Liam Walsh won the British super-featherweight title in a highly contested fight against [[Gary Sykes]]. Walsh dropped Sykes in the first round and went on to dominate the fight and won a clear decision with judges scores of 119–108, 118–111 and 118–109.

Liam Walsh defended his titles on 28 February in a rematch against [[Joe Murray (boxer)|Joe Murray]] who he previously beat by Majority Decision, this time winning by 5th round TKO.

Abeykoon having served in the [[Ceylon Civil Service]] for many years, was appointed as [[Inspector General of Police (Sri Lanka)|Inspector General of Police]] (IGP) on 1 May 1959 by his personal friend and bridge partner, [[Prime Minister of Sri Lanka|Prime Minister]] [[S.

Senior police officers protested and DIG [[C.C. "Jungle" Dissanayake|C. C. Dissanayake]] tendered his resignation, which was later withdrawn.

'''Morpheus''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɔr|f|i|ə|s}} is a [[fictional character]] in [[The Matrix (franchise)|''The Matrix'' franchise]]. He is portrayed by [[Laurence Fishburne]] in the films, and in the video game ''[[The Matrix: Path of Neo]]'' where he was the only actor to reprise his character's voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Matrix: Path of Neo Review|url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-matrix-path-of-neo-review/1900-6139602/|last=Navarro|first=Alex|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=November 10, 2005|accessdate=January 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept and creation==
[[The Wachowskis|Lana and Lilly Wachowski]], the creators of [[The Matrix (franchise)|''The Matrix'' franchise]], instructed Fishburne to base his performance on [[Dream (comics)|Morpheus]], a character in [[Neil Gaiman]]'s comic book series ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journal.neilgaiman.com/2003/06/you-must-be-this-tall-to-ride-this.asp|title=Neil Gaiman's Journal: You must be this tall to ride this website...|last=Gaiman|first=Neil|authorlink=Neil Gaiman|work=neilgaiman.com|date=June 10, 2003|accessdate=December 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the studio's request, Gaiman later wrote "Goliath", a promotional short story set in the film's universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journal.neilgaiman.com/2003/05/do-you-have-to-yes-i-have-to-oh-dont.asp|title=Neil Gaiman's Journal: "Do you have to?" "Yes I have to." "Oh." "Don't Get up."|work=neilgaiman.com|date=May 5, 2003|accessdate=December 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name [[Morpheus (mythology)|Morpheus]] is that of the [[Morpheus (mythology)|god of dreams]] in Greek mythology, which is consistent with the character's involvement with the "dreaming" of the Matrix. The mythical Morpheus and his family, including two brothers (Phobetor and Phantasos), lived in a dream world protected by the Gates of Morpheus with two monsters standing guard. Beyond the gates were the River of Forgetfulness, beside which Morpheus once carried his father to hide in a cave, and the River of Oblivion.  This theme of duality carries over to Morpheus in The Matrix, who offers Neo either a blue pill (to forget about The Matrix and continue to live in the world of illusion) or a red pill (to enter the painful world of reality).

==Overview==
In the Matrix films, Morpheus is the captain of the ''Nebuchadnezzar'', which is a hovercraft of the human forces of the last human city, [[Zion (The Matrix)|Zion]], in a devastated world where most humans are grown by sentient machines and kept imprisoned in the Matrix, a virtual computer-generated world. Morpheus was once a human living inside the Matrix until he was freed.

Morpheus is apparently a very popular public figure in the city of Zion. He is also known in the [[Matrix (fictional universe)|Matrix]], but as a dangerous [[terrorism|terrorist]] wanted by [[Agent (The Matrix)|'Agents']], who appear to be Federal investigators but are sentient computer programs that patrol the Matrix, eliminating any threat to the Matrix.

Like other hovercraft crews, Morpheus and his crew are dedicated to the protection of Zion and the freeing of humans from the Matrix.

Earlier in his life, Morpheus gained the romantic attention of [[Niobe (The Matrix)|Niobe]], another hovercraft captain. Their relationship became estranged shortly after Morpheus visited [[Oracle (The Matrix)|the Oracle]], an ally living in the Matrix, who told Morpheus that he would be the person who would find [[Neo (The Matrix)|the One]], a human having superhuman abilities within the Matrix who could end the human/machine war. Since that visit, Morpheus has spent much of his life searching the Matrix for the One.

==Personality==
In ''The Matrix'' and ''The Matrix Reloaded'', Morpheus was known to be a truly inspirational leader and influential teacher to many people, particularly the majority of his crew, to the extent that Tank commented that "Morpheus was a father to them, as well as a leader". In ''The Matrix Revolutions'', with Morpheus's faith in the prophecy shattered, he doesn't appear as strong a leader as he was in the first two films. Despite his strong faith, Morpheus still showed some rationality in dangerous situations rather than blindly relying on his beliefs to see him through the current crisis; perhaps his only truly irrational decision was to attack Agent Smith while unarmed in order to give Neo a chance to escape.

His strong, almost single-minded belief in Neo as the One has very strong Biblical correlations to that of [[John The Baptist|John the Baptist's]] belief in the prophecy of the Messiah. Like Morpheus preaching about the imminent return of the One into the Matrix, John was preaching in the desert of the Messiah's imminent return, and actively searched for the Messiah to come who would deliver his people from bondage. Upon finding Jesus, he believed so strongly in Jesus as the Messiah, John willingly stepped aside and let Christ take up the groundwork that John had created and laid before him, and continue where John had left off.

==Character history==

===''The Matrix''===
In the first feature film, ''The Matrix'', Morpheus successfully finds and monitors a man named Thomas A. Anderson, a [[Black hat hacking|hacker]] who calls himself [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]]. Despite a close call with [[Agent (The Matrix)|Agents]] that capture, interrogate, and place a surveillance device on Neo, Morpheus and his crew locate him. Morpheus offers Neo a choice of ingesting a [[redpill|red pill]], which will activate a trace program to locate Neo's body in the real world and allow the ''Nebuchadnezzar'' crew to extract him, or a [[bluepill|blue pill]], which will leave Neo in the Matrix to live and believe as he wishes. Neo takes the red pill. The ''Nebuchadnezzar'' crew is then able to eject Neo's body from the Matrix powerplant and retrieve him from the cold sewers where the machines patrol. Morpheus takes a risk in helping Neo escape the Matrix, as human minds that live too long in the Matrix may have trouble in comprehending the reality. Initially, Neo does experience denial when Morpheus explains the truth, a point for which Morpheus apologizes.

Shortly after Neo visits the Oracle, Morpheus is captured by agents who plan to hack into his mind. Because Morpheus, as a hovercraft captain, possesses access codes to the Zion mainframe computer, the surviving members of the ship's crew are about to unplug Morpheus from the Matrix, without reconnecting his mind and body, a process that will kill him. Neo and [[Trinity (The Matrix)|Trinity]], however, reenter the Matrix to make a daring and successful rescue of Morpheus. Neo saves Trinity from a helicopter crash, confirming Morpheus' belief that Neo is indeed the One.

Neo is eventually killed by [[Agent Smith]] shortly after the rescue, but revived as the One and returned to the ''Nebuchadnezzar'' before the Machines' Sentinels can destroy the ship.

===''The Matrix Reloaded''===
In the second film, ''The Matrix Reloaded'', Morpheus is more confident that the war is nearing its end. A spiritual as well as an influential leader, Morpheus convinces one hovercraft ship to stay in the Matrix to await contact from the Oracle, despite orders from Zion for all ships to return to the city.  Here he incurs the wrath of Jason Locke, commander of the Zion defensive forces; but Morpheus' actions are defended by Councillor Hamann, a member of the city's ruling body.

With the aid of Trinity and Niobe, Morpheus successfully retrieves the Keymaker, an exiled program that can access many hidden areas of the Matrix, including the Source, the central Machine City mainframe computer and programming heart of the Matrix. Morpheus aids Neo in successfully entering the door to the Source before returning to the ''Nebuchadnezzar''.

After Neo enters the Source and returns from the Matrix with new information, he tells Morpheus that the Prophecy was a system of control that would bring the One to the Source to disseminate the programming inside Neo into the Matrix to allow a reload of the Matrix while Zion is destroyed by the machines and rebuilt by the One and red pills. A sudden Sentinel attack destroys the ''Nebuchadnezzar'', further damaging Morpheus' belief in the outcome of the war. Upon witnessing the destruction of his ship, he quotes the Biblical [[Nebuchadnezzar]]; "I have dreamed a dream... but now that dream has gone from me."

The crew is rescued by the hovercraft ''Mjolnir'' commanded by Captain Roland, who joins forces with the craft ''Logos'' commanded by Niobe.

===''The Matrix Revolutions''===
In the final film, ''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]'', Morpheus is somewhat dispirited, and has problems in understanding now what may happen to Zion and its people. Now without a ship of his own, he and Link (the ''Nebuchadnezzar's'' Operator) reside on the hovercraft ''Mjolnir'', commanded by Roland. Morpheus renews his conviction that Neo could still save Zion, and supports Trinity in finding Neo, whose mind is trapped in a computer netherworld called Mobil Avenue, despite not being jacked in. Morpheus is called to the Oracle with Trinity, and with the Oracle's guardian, Seraph, he helps Trinity rescue Neo, via a visit to the Merovingian's lair and a [[Mexican standoff]].

Morpheus says farewell to Neo and Trinity before they leave for the Machine City in the hovercraft ''Logos'' to stop the war. Morpheus then aids Niobe as she flies the ''Mjolnir'' in a desperate ride back to Zion. The ship successfully stops the first onslaught of the Machine attack with the ship's [[electromagnetic pulse]] weapon.

When the Sentinels suddenly stop a second wave of attacks, Morpheus realises that Neo is somehow fighting for them. When the Sentinels retreat after Neo defeats the former [[Agent Smith]], now a virus that has threatened both humans and machines, Morpheus and Niobe embrace in celebration as cheers arise from the Zion population, who have received a brokered peace through Neo's sacrifice.

Of the original ''Nebuchadnezzar'' crew in ''the Matrix'',  Morpheus is the only surviving member to see freedom for Zion.

Referring to the subjectivity of reality throughout the film trilogy, Morpheus' last line in ''Matrix Revolutions'', said in disbelief as the Sentinels retreat from Zion, is ''"Is this real?"''.

===''The Matrix Online''===
In Chapter 1.2 of ''[[The Matrix Online]]'', Morpheus grows impatient with the machines and demands that they return the body of [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]]. After many unanswered public speeches threatening action, Morpheus starts terrorist attacks throughout the Matrix. These attacks take the form of weapons that reveal the Matrix's inner workings (its code) for all human beings to see, even those not yet awakened to the simulation. This is known to have caused mass panic and forced awakenings to those not ready to see the truth. By killing Morpheus' simulacrum guards, redpills were however able to find means of disabling Morpheus' bombs.

During the game events on May 26, 2005 (as recorded on the game's official website), Morpheus plants a [[logic bomb|code bomb]] in the Rumbaar water treatment facility. After planting the bomb, he realizes he is being hunted by the enigmatic, masked figure known as the Assassin. Morpheus escapes the treatment facility; however, upon his leaving, the Assassin bends the code of the Matrix and emerges from a vent in the wall. Morpheus is caught off-guard and is unable to dodge the Assassin's bullets. He dies from gunshot wounds.

Some players argued against the death of the character Morpheus as the Matrix now provides an "Emergency Jack-Out" upgrade for redpills, eliminating the permanent death that previous redpills experienced if killed within the Matrix before the Truce. This feature could save a redpill's life with no fatal injuries. It was later revealed that the Assassin's bullets had contained a new form of code encryption, named a "kill code," which bypassed this technology. These kill codes are explained to be extremely difficult to produce and usually require a direct sample of the subject's residual self-image data, thus making them extremely rare and only used in the most extreme and specialist of circumstances. These codes were utilized later in the story as well, being the basis of function for The Apothecary character and the subject of The Oracle's plan to wound the Oligarchy.

Rumors and the popular belief of a [[faked death]] still run rampant however, largely based on the fact that prior to Morpheus' assassination a few select redpills were sent an email stating that he would likely "fade away" and hide. As with Neo, Morpheus' remains in the real world have yet to be found.

====Simulacra====
During Chapter 6 a figure appeared resembling Morpheus. It took the form of an RSI transmission, apparently originating from the Real World and spread disjointed messages about Neo's survival and imprisonment at the hands of The Machines. This was later revealed to be nothing more than a farce created by The General to sow dissent between Zion and The Machines, an effort he'd hoped would renew conflict between the two parties and give him purpose again.

The fake, a Morpheus Simulacrum created from Zion records of the captain, took on a greater role once its master ordered it to deactivate itself. Disobeying its initial programming and refusing to shut down, the program went on to, over time, gain greater levels of self-awareness and sentience. It proved instrumental in The Machines' unlocking of the Zion RSI Database acquired during the 6th destruction of Zion as part of the renewed war effort following the Cypherite discovery of New Zion. This wasn't however done with malicious intent, in fact, the Simulacrum's personality was notably innocent, being more concerned with the world around it and its own existence than taking sides in any political or ideological struggles.

In later chapters the Morpheus Simulacrum played a supporting role in the Oracle's faked death and subsequent plan to weaken the Oligarch forces threatening The Matrix. Approached by the Oligarch Halborn during his research into the life of The One, the Simulacrum coldly dismissed the Intruder's actions as only leading to his inevitable defeat.

==Other appearances==
In January 2014, Fishburne reprised his role as Morpheus in [[Kia Motors]]' [[Kia K9|K900]] commercial for [[Super Bowl XLVIII]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jalopnik.com/kias-the-matrix-super-bowl-ad-sells-a-k900-with-morphe-1510752726 |title=Kia's ''The Matrix'' Super Bowl Ad Sells A K900 With Morpheus And Two Keys |author=Estrada, Zac |publisher=''[[Jalopnik]]'' |date=2014-01-28 |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sings [[Pavarotti]]'s rendition of [[Nessun Dorma]], Italian for "None Shall Sleep".

The company develops and produces medicines for a wide range of medical disciplines, including [[oncology]], [[anaphylaxis]], [[Management of HIV/AIDS|antiretrovirals]], [[Circulatory system|cardiovascular]], [[Respiratory system|respiratory]], [[dermatology]], [[immunology]], [[anesthesia]] and [[pain management]], [[Infection|infectious disease]], [[gastroenterology]], diabetology/[[endocrinology]], and women's healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mylan.com/en/products/therapeutic-innovation|title=Therapeutic Innovation|website=www.mylan.com|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Mylan's pricing of the EpiPen, an [[epinephrine autoinjector]], became controversial and was widely referred to as "price gouging".  As a result, investigations were opened into whether Mylan had misclassified the EpiPen under the [[Medicaid Drug Rebate Program]], a common form of [[pharmaceutical fraud]].  In October 2016, Mylan settled these investigations with the U.S. Department of Justice, agreeing to pay $465 million and enter into a [[corporate integrity agreement]] concerning the rebate program. In a report published on June 12, 2017 Institutional Shareholder Services criticized Mylan for the "outsized compensation" of Mylan's directors. Former CEO [[Robert Coury]] received a $98 million 2016 pay package in spite of shareholder losses and the perceived harm to the company inflicted by the EpiPen controversies. The report urged Mylan's shareholders to oust all of Mylan's existing directors.&lt;ref name="CNN_CEO_revolt"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/06/13/investing/epipen-mylan-exec-pay-shareholder-revolt/index.html?sr=twCNN061417epipen-mylan-exec-pay-shareholder-revolt0246AMStoryLink&amp;linkId=38675750 |title=EpiPen maker faces revolt over exec's $98 million pay package |first=Matt |last=Egan |work=CNN Money}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stock==
On February 23, 1973, Mylan had its initial public offering (IPO),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mylan.com/en/investors/stock-history#|title=MYL Stock History - Mylan|publisher=|accessdate=August 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming a [[publicly traded]] company on the [[Over-the-counter (finance)|OTC]] market under the [[ticker symbol]] MYLN. In 1976 the stock moved to [[NASDAQ]]. Their final stock move was in 1986, when their stock became available for trade on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] under the ticker symbol MYL. Currently, the stock is traded on the [[NASDAQ]].

==History==
===Founding to 1980===
Mylan Pharmaceuticals was founded as a drug distributor in 1961 by [[Milan Puskar]] and [[Don Panoz]].&lt;ref name="PuskarObit"/&gt; In 1966 Mylan began manufacturing [[penicillin G]] tablets as well as vitamins and other dietary supplements.&lt;ref name="PuskarObit"/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTexpose1989/&gt;

Panoz left Mylan in 1969 and Puskar quit the company in 1973, as it grew and experienced financial difficulties. The board hired Roy McKnight as board chairman, who convinced Puskar to return in 1976.&lt;ref name=NYTexpose1989/&gt;

Mylan discontinued operating as a [[contract manufacturing organization]] in 1980 and instead chose to market their products under their own "Mylan-labeled" brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thepharmaletter.com/company/mylan-laboratories|title=Mylan Laboratories|last=Letter|first=The Pharma|website=www.thepharmaletter.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s===
With the passage of the [[Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act|Hatch-Waxman Act]] in 1984, Mylan and other small generic companies gained value; in the eighteen months following passage of the law Mylan's earnings grew 166% to $12.5 million and its stock value rose 800%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lewis|first1=Ralph A.|title=The Emerging Effects of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984|journal=Journal of Contemporary Health Law &amp; Policy|date=1992|volume=8|issue=1|pages=361–378|url=http://scholarship.law.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1539&amp;context=jchlp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dyazide &amp; Maxzide====
In the 1980s one of the most prescribed drugs in the US was Dyazide, a [[diuretic]] that was a [[combination drug]] containing [[triamterene]] and [[hydrochlorothiazide]]; it had been on the market since 1965 and its patents had expired in 1980.&lt;ref name=Philly1987&gt;Ron Wolf for the Philadelphia Inquirer. August 22, 1987 [http://articles.philly.com/1987-08-22/news/26170137_1_smithkline-stock-smithkline-earnings-generic-version Smithkline Loses Exclusive Rights To Drug]&lt;/ref&gt;  Complications arose with the introductions of generics versions, because the formulation of Dyazide resulted in variable batches that made it impossible for generic manufacturers to show that their versions were bioequivalent.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boehm|first1=Garth|last2=Yao|first2=Lixin|last3=Han|first3=Liang|last4=Zheng|first4=Qiang|title=Development of the generic drug industry in the US after the Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984|journal=Acta Pharmaceutica Sinica B|date=September 2013|volume=3|issue=5|pages=297–311|doi=10.1016/j.apsb.2013.07.004|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211383513000762}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MylanHistDyazide&gt;John Seaman and John T.

Some generic companies committed fraud trying to bring a generic version of Dyazide.  Bolar Pharmaceutical had the first generic version approved in 1987,&lt;ref name=Philly1987/&gt;  but it turned out that Bolar had fraudulently substituted Dyazide for its own version to conduct studies that were submitted to the FDA. By 1989 the FDA rescinded its approval based on its suspicions and filed criminal charges against Bolar, to which Bolar eventually pled guilty in 1991.&lt;ref name=Siege/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shaw|first1=Donna|title=U.s.

Mylan chose to develop a new version of a triamterene/hydrochlorothiazide combination drug instead of going the generic route;  it developed a different, more stable formulation&lt;ref name=MylanHistDyazide/&gt; and used different dosages of each active ingredient (50&amp;nbsp;mg hydrochlorothiazide and 75&amp;nbsp;mg triamterene, compared with Dyazide's 25&amp;nbsp;mg hydrochlorothiazide and 50&amp;nbsp;mg triamterene).&lt;ref name=MaxApprovable/&gt; This drug had to get approval as a new drug, as opposed to a generic. Their product was called Maxzide and was approved in 1984.&lt;ref name=MaxApprovable&gt;Pink Sheet October 22, 1984 [https://pink.pharmamedtechbi.com/PS007364/MYLANs-MAXZIDE-IS-APPROVABLE-AT-FDA-LEDERLE-TO-MARKET-BRAND-COMPETITION-TO-SMITHKLINEs-No-3RANKED-DYAZIDE-FINAL-APPROVAL-ANTICIPATED-IMMINENTLY Mylan's Maxzide is "Approvable" at FDA: Lederle To Market Brand Competition to Smithkline's No. 3-Ranked Dyazide; Final Approval Anticipated "Imminently"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;FDA [http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm?fuseaction=Search.Set_Current_Drug&amp;ApplNo=019129&amp;DrugName=MAXZIDE&amp;ActiveIngred=HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE%3B%20TRIAMTERENE&amp;SponsorApplicant=MYLAN%20PHARMS%20INC&amp;ProductMktStatus=1&amp;goto=Search.Label_ApprovalHistory Approval History NDA 019129: Maxzide] Page accessed September 8, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  The higher dose allowed once per day dosing, which Mylan and its marketing partner, Lederle, believed would help it compete against Dyazide, which had $210M in sales in 1983.&lt;ref name=MaxApprovable/&gt;  However, Mylan's patents on the drug were declared invalid in court, and its marketing exclusivity expired in 1987, prompting a rush of generic competition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reid|first1=Kenneth|title=US Judge to Rule on Drug Marketing|url=http://www.joc.com/us-judge-rule-drug-marketing_19871117.html|publisher=Journal of Commerce|date=November 17, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mylan had concerns about the practices of its competitors and the FDA in general, and also with regard to companies seeking to bring generic versions of Maxzide.  Mylan hired private investigators to examine its competitors' practices, and when it found evidence of corruption, it submitted it to the [[United States House Energy Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations|House Oversight and Investigations Committee]], which investigated and found fraud and corruption within the [[Food and Drug Administration]]'s generic drugs division and at other generic companies.&lt;ref name=NYTexpose1989&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/10/business/exposing-the-fda.html?pagewanted=all|title = Exposing the F.D.A.|last = Freudenheim|first = Milt|date = September 10, 1989|work = New York Times|accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two of the companies that had gotten approval to market generic versions of Maxzide,  Vitarine Pharmaceutical and [[Par Pharmaceutical]], were targets of Mylan's initial investigation and were found to have used Mylan's Maxzide to obtain their bioequivalence data, leading both companies to withdraw its generic competitor to Mylan's product.&lt;ref name=NYTexpose1989/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Andrews|first1=Edmund L.|title=F.D.A.

The corruption in the nascent generics industry and at the office in the FDA regulating it was widely covered in the media, and led to widespread concern among doctors and the public in the late 1980s and early 1990s that generic drugs were not really the same as the branded drugs they were meant to replace.&lt;ref name=Siege&gt;{{cite news|last1=Strickland|first1=Carol|title=Bolar: A Drug Company Under Siege|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/15/nyregion/bolar-a-drug-company-under-siege.html?pagewanted=all|work=The New York Times|date=October 15, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cimons|first1=Marlene|title=FDA to Lift OK of Last Dyazide Generic Version|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-08-29/news/mn-1184_1_generic-drug|work=Los Angeles Times|date=August 29, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

====Acquisitions begin====
In 1987 Mylan agreed to enter into a joint venture with Bolar to buy Somerset Pharmaceuticals; Mylan wanted access to Somersets' drug discovery capabilities as well as its new drug for Parkinson's, [[selegiline]]; the deal was completed in 1988 but its consummation was dependent on FDA approval of selegiline, which came in 1989.&lt;ref name=NYTexpose1989/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bolar and Mylan Team to Purchase Somerset Labs|url=https://pink.pharmamedtechbi.com/PS014590/BOLAR-AND-MYLAN-TEAM-TO-PURCHASE-SOMERSET-LABS|work=Pink Sheet|date=November 14, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Somerset Eldepryl June 5 Approval Clears Way For Mylan/Bolar Acquisition|url=https://pink.pharmamedtechbi.com/PS015763/SOMERSET-ELDEPRYL-JUNE-5-APPROVAL-CLEARS-WAY-FOR-MYLANBOLAR-ACQUISITION|work=Pink Sheet|date=June 12, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s===
Mylan acquired Bertek Inc. in 1993 for its [[transdermal patch]] technologies, and kept it as a subsidiary. In 1999 Mylan renamed the company Mylan Technologies Inc. (MTI).&lt;ref name="SpecialtyTrends2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ku|first1=Mannching Sherry|title=Recent trends in specialty pharma business model|journal=Journal of Food and Drug Analysis|date=December 1, 2015|volume=23|issue=4|pages=595–608|doi=10.1016/j.jfda.2015.04.008|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1021949815000575}}&lt;/ref&gt;  MTI eventually came to be the contract manufacturer for the [[selegiline]] transdermal patch and was the first company to market  generic nitroglycerin, estradiol, clonidine, and fentanyl transdermal patches.&lt;ref name="SpecialtyTrends2015"/&gt;   

In 1996 Mylan acquired UDL Laboratories, a supplier of unit dose generic medications to institutional and [[long-term care]] facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Mylan [ftp://ftp.sec.gov/edgar/data/69499/0000069499-96-000033.txt Form 10-K (annual report))] for the Financial year ending March 31, 1996, filed June 26, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 when it was the world's second largest generics company, Mylan came under investigation from the [[Federal Trade Commission]] after it raised the prices of its products, tripling them in the case of [[lorazepam]].  Mylan had entered into an exclusive agreement with Profarmica, an Italian company that supplied drug ingredients, after which Mylan's competitors had higher prices and a diminished supply of raw ingredients for lorazepam and other drugs.&lt;ref name="NYT1998"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Labaton|first1=Stephen|title=A Drug Maker Is Said to Face A Suit on Prices|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/05/business/a-drug-maker-is-said-to-face-a-suit-on-prices.html|work=The New York Times|date=December 5, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the round of price increases the price of generic drugs had been 5 - 10% of the price of branded drugs and afterwards it was around 50%.&lt;ref name="NYT1998"/&gt;  The FTC filed suit at the end of 1998 and 32 states filed parallel actions.  The case was settled in 2000, with Mylan paying a total of $147M --  $100M in disgorged profits into a fund to reimburse consumers and state agencies that had overpaid, $8 million in attorney's fees to the State Attorneys General, $35 million, plus $4 million in attorney's fees, to settle certain class actions with insurers and managed care organizations—and Mylan and three ingredient suppliers (Cambrex Corporation, Profarmaco S.R.L., and Gyma Laboratories) also agreed to an injunction barring them from entering into similar anticompetitive agreements in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Press release: FTC Reaches Record Financial Settlement To Settle Charges of Price-fixing in Generic Drug Market {{!}} Federal Trade Commission|url=https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2000/11/ftc-reaches-record-financial-settlement-settle-charges-price|work=FTC|date=November 29, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "nyt"&gt;

===2000s===
====Attempted King Pharmaceuticals acquisition====
In 2004 Mylan and [[King Pharmaceuticals]] began discussing a deal in which Mylan would acquire King for about $4B; Mylan wanted to expand its presence in branded pharmaceuticals and to acquire King's sales force.&lt;ref name="FortuneKing"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Creswell|first1=Julie|title=Icahn the Spoiler|url=http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2005/03/21/8254845/index.htm|work=Fortune|date=March 21, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The deal was complicated by a number of factors, and included an SEC investigation into King's accounting and [[Carl Icahn]] obtaining a 9.8% interest in Mylan and becoming its largest stakeholder in order to kill the deal. The parties called off the deal in February 2005.&lt;ref name="FortuneKing"/&gt;  Afterwards, Icahn offered to buy Mylan for $5.4B&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pollack|first1=Andrew|title=Icahn Offers $5.4 Billion for Mylan, Drug Maker|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/20/business/icahn-offers-54-billion-for-mylan-drug-maker.html|work=The New York Times|date=November 20, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and nominated a slate of board members to change the direction of Mylan; he won three seats in May 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'keefe|first1=Eric|title=Icahn Slate Wins Seats on Blockbuster Board|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/12/business/icahn-slate-wins-seats-on-blockbuster-board.html|work=The New York Times|date=May 12, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In June Mylan bought back 25% of its shares in order to fend off Icahn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lazo|first1=Shirley A.|title=Survival Strategy|url=http://www.barrons.com/articles/SB111905080477763147|work=Barrons}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July Icahn gave up his bid and sold his shares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Icahn Drops Bid for Mylan|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/jul/19/business/fi-mylan19|work=Los Angeles Times|agency=Bloomberg News|date=July 29, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Matrix acquisition====
In August 2006 Mylan announced that it had reached an agreement to buy a controlling interest in Matrix Laboratories, an Indian supplier of [[active pharmaceutical ingredients]]. The deal gave Mylan access to markets in India and China and was completed in January the next year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mylan Signs US$736-mil.

====EpiPen acquisition====
In May 2007 Mylan and [[Merck KGaA]] agreed that Mylan would acquire Merck's generics arm for $6.6B. The deal was completed that October and tripled the size of Mylan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Massey|first1=Steve|title=Mylan buys Merck generic drug unit for $6.6 billion|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/business/businessnews/2007/05/13/Mylan-buys-Merck-generic-drug-unit-for-6-6-billion/stories/200705130184|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=May 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Press release: Mylan Completes Acquisition of Generics Business of Merck KGaA|url=http://newsroom.mylan.com/press-releases?item=122513|work=Mylan|date=October 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Mylan acquired the rights to market the EpiPen in the transaction. At that time annual sales were around $200 million&lt;ref name=BloomMarketing/&gt; and the EpiPen had about 90% of the market.&lt;ref name="Trib2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Carolyn Y.|last2=Ho|first2=Catherine|title=How Mylan, the EpiPen company, maneuvered to create a virtual monopoly|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-mylan-epipen-monopoly-20160825-story.html|work=The Washington Post via The Chicago Tribune|date=August 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the company filed two lawsuits against the [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] after the newspaper ran an article that was critical of the quality control procedures used at the company's Morgantown plant.&lt;ref name="wsj2009"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Adams|first1=Russell|title=Mylan Again Sues Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704746304574505972491633900|accessdate=August 26, 2016|publisher=[[Wall Street Journal]]|date=October 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ppg0709"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sabatini|first1=Patricia|last2=Boselovic|first2=Len|title=Mylan workers overrode drug quality controls Internal report detailed 'pervasive' practice of ignoring safety procedures|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/business/businessnews/2009/07/26/Mylan-workers-overrode-drug-quality-controls/stories/200907260233|publisher=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|accessdate=August 26, 2016|date=July 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company had earlier quality control issues involving the FDA.&lt;ref name="mwcbs09"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Edwards|first1=Jim|title=It's Not Mylan's First Quality Control Beef With FDA|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/its-not-mylans-first-quality-control-beef-with-fda/|accessdate=August 26, 2016|work=Money Watch|publisher=CBS News|date=July 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The lawsuits were dropped in 2012 without any damages paid by the Post-Gazette, which stated "The Post-Gazette did not find and did not intend to report that Mylan had manufactured or distributed any defective drugs. The Post-Gazette regrets if any reader of the article thought otherwise."&lt;ref name="ap2012"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mylan, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette settle lawsuits|url=http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/mylan-pittsburgh-post-gazette-settle-lawsuits|accessdate=August 26, 2016|agency=Associated Press|publisher=CBS News|date=February 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2009, Mylan and its subsidiary UDL agreed to pay a $118M to settle a suit filed under the [[False Claims Act]] in which Mylan/UDL and two other companies were accused of underpaying states under the [[Medicaid Drug Rebate Program]]. The program requires drug companies to give rebates to states under Medicaid and the rebates are higher for new drugs than for generics; the suit said that the companies sold new drugs but paid rebates as if they were generics.&lt;ref&gt;US Department of Justice.

===2010s===
====Generic Advair agreement====
In 2011, Mylan entered into an agreement with [[Pfizer]] for the exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize Pfizer's generic equivalent to [[GlaxoSmithKline]]'s [[Advair]] (US)/Seretide (UK) Diskus incorporating Pfizer's proprietary dry powder inhaler delivery platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drugstorenews.com/article/mylan-acquires-rights-pfizers-inhaler-technology|title=Mylan acquires rights to Pfizer's inhaler technology|work=drugstorenews.com|accessdate=May 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mylan launched the product in the UK in 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stanton|first1=Dan|title=GSK breathes freely as Mylan launches Seretide generic in UK|url=http://www.in-pharmatechnologist.com/Drug-Delivery/GSK-breathes-freely-as-Mylan-launches-Advair-generic-in-UK|work=in-Pharma Technologist|date=June 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in February 2016 the FDA accepted its ANDA, putting it in line behind Hikma and Sandoz to launch a generic version in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Helfand|first1=Carly|title=Mylan joins the Advair-copycat queue, but approval could be a long slog|url=http://www.fiercepharma.com/sales-and-marketing/mylan-joins-advair-copycat-queue-but-approval-could-be-a-long-slog|work=FiercePharma|date=February 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====EpiPen4Schools Launch====
In 2012, Mylan launched a program called ''EpiPen4Schools'' to sell EpiPens in bulk and with discounts to schools. To participate in the program schools had to agree not to buy epinephrine autoinjectors from any other company for a year, a requirement which a Mylan spokesperson said is no longer part of its program.&lt;ref name=PBSschools&gt;{{cite news|last1=Swetlitz|first1=Ike|last2=Silverman|first2=Ed|title=Mylan may have violated antitrust law in its EpiPen sales to schools|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/mylan-may-violated-antitrust-law-epipen-sales-schools-legal-experts-say/|work=PBS Newshour|date=August 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012, the [[National Association of State Boards of Education]] launched a policy initiative designed to "help state boards of education as they develop student health policies regarding anaphylaxis and epinephrine auto-injector access and use," and advocated for state laws protecting school from legal liability for stocking and using epinephrine autoinjectors.  Gayle Manchin, the mother of Mylan's CEO, Heather Bresch, had become president of the association in 2010, and shortly after had discussed donations from her "daughter's company" to the association.  Manchin had been appointed to the West Virginia state school board by her husband, then-governor of the state [[Joe Manchin]], in 2007. In a statement, Mylan said, "There is no truth to the suggestion that the company's efforts were anything but straightforward or that we are aware of anyone advocating inappropriately for the right of schoolchildren to have access to potential life-saving medicine." &lt;ref name=USAtodayFamily&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Donnell|first1=Jayne|title=Family matters:  EpiPens had high-level help getting into schools|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2016/09/20/family-matters-epipens-had-help-getting-schools-manchin-bresch/90435218/|work=USA Today|date=September 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After successful lobbying from Mylan,&lt;ref name=BloomMarketing/&gt; in 2013, the "School Access to Emergency Epinephrine Act" became law after passing Congress with broad and bipartisan support; it protected anyone from liability if they administered epinephrine to a child in a school (previously, only trained professionals or the affected person were allowed to administer the drug, and were open to liability), and it provided some financial incentives for schools that didn’t already stock epinephrine autoinjector to start stocking them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Novak|first1=Matt|title=How Congress, the FDA, and Sarah Jessica Parker Helped EpiPen Become a $1 Billion Business|url=https://gizmodo.com/how-congress-the-fda-and-sarah-jessica-parker-helped-1785568792|publisher=Gizmodo|date=August 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joe Manchin, the father of Mylan's CEO, was a senator at that time.&lt;ref name=USAtodayFamily/&gt;

====Agila acquisition====
In 2013 Mylan acquired an Indian generic injectable drugs company, Agila Specialties Private, for $1.6 billion in cash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thomas|first1=Katie|title=Mylan Buys Drug Maker of Generic Injectables|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/02/27/mylan-to-acquire-injectable-drug-maker-for-1-6-billion/?_r=0|publisher=New York Times|date=February 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015 three plants acquired in that deal were issued warning letters by the FDA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Palmer|first1=Eric|title=UPDATED: FDA castigates three Mylan sterile drug plants in warning letter |url=http://www.fiercepharma.com/regulatory/updated-fda-castigates-three-mylan-sterile-drug-plants-warning-letter|publisher=FiercePharma|date=August 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Abbott acquisition====
In July 2014, Mylan and [[Abbott Laboratories]] announced an agreement under which Mylan would buy Abbott's generic drugs business in developed markets for stock valued at about $5.3 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/mylan-buy-abbott-business-line-53b-deal-24547698|title=Business News, Personal Finance and Money News - ABC News|author=ABC News|work=ABC News|accessdate=July 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mylan acquired Mumbai-based Famy Care and expand its presence in the market for women's contraceptives at about $750 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2015-02-03/news/58751406_1_drugmaker-mylan-contraceptives-urban-indian-women|title=US drugmaker Mylan to acquire Famy Care for $750 Million|work=timesofindia-economictimes | date=February 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Attempted Perrigo acquisition====
In April 2015, Mylan tried negotiating with the management of [[Ireland|Irish]] pharmaceutical firm [[Perrigo]] to acquire the company, and when those negotiations failed Mylan attempted a hostile takeover, offering to buy $26B in shares directly from shareholders. Too few shareholders agreed to sell their stock by the deadline set in November 2015 and the effort failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Koons|first1=Cynthia|title=Mylan's Hostile Bid for Perrigo Fails|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-13/mylan-s-hostile-bid-for-perrigo-fails-as-40-of-shares-tendered|work=Bloomberg|date=November 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Attempted purchase by Teva====
Two weeks after Mylan made its first offer for Perrigo, [[Teva Pharmaceutical]] offered to buy Mylan for $40B; the combined companies would have been the world's largest generic company and the 9th biggest drug company in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rockoff|first1=Jonathan D.|last2=Mattioli|first2=Dana|title=Teva Offers to Buy Mylan for $40 Billion|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/teva-offers-to-buy-mylan-for-82-a-share-1429620984|work=Wall Street Journal|date=April 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In July, Teva dropped its bid for Mylan and instead acquired [[Allergan]]'s generic drug business for about the same price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2015-07-27/teva-to-buy-allergan-s-generic-drug-unit|title=Teva to Buy Allergan's Generic Drug Unit|date=July 27, 2015|work=Bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-27/teva-snaps-up-allergan-s-generics-arm-dumping-mylan|title=Teva Snaps Up Allergan's Generics Arm, Dumping Mylan|author=Chitra Somayaji|date=July 27, 2015|work=Bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New COPD drug====
In June 2015, Mylan agreed to work with Pulmatrix, a company with a proprietary inhaled drug delivery platform, to co-develop a product to treat for [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]]; the product was PUR0200, a generic drug in a Pulmatrix device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/mylan-to-co-develop-pulmatrix-copd-candidate/81251395/|title=Mylan to Co-Develop Pulmatrix' COPD Candidate|work=GEN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Meda acquisition====
In February 2016, the company announced it would acquire [[Meda AB|Meda]] for $9.9 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/mylan-to-acquire-meda-for-9-9b/81252356/|title=Mylan to Acquire Meda for $9.9B - GEN News Highlights - GEN|publisher=|accessdate=August 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May of the same year the company announced it would acquire Renaissance Acquisition Holdings dermatology division for up to $1 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/mylan-snaps-up-dermatology-biz-from-investors-1b-deal|title=Mylan snaps up dermatology biz from investors in $1B deal  - FiercePharma|publisher=|accessdate=August 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, the [[State attorney general|attorneys general]] of 20 states filed a civil complaint accusing Mylan of a coordinated scheme to artificially maintain high prices for a generic antibiotic and diabetes drug. The complaint alleged [[Price fixing|price collusion schemes]] between six pharmaceutical firms including informal gatherings, telephone calls, and text messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Thomas |first=Katie |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/15/business/generic-drug-price-lawsuit-teva-mylan.html |title=20 States Accuse Generic Drug Companies of Price Fixing |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2016-12-15 |accessdate=2016-12-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, the company announced the launch of the first FDA-approved generic of Teva’s long-acting Copaxone. Approximately 3 months later, Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan cited IMS Health data which showed that the new generic accounted for 10% of the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Helfand |first1=Carly |title=Look out, Teva: Mylan's Copaxone copy has already captured serious share |url=https://www.fiercepharma.com/marketing/look-out-teva-mylan-s-copaxone-copy-has-already-captured-serious-share |accessdate=9 July 2018 |publisher=FiercePharma |date=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, Mylan announced a collaboration with West Virginia University to expose children across West Virginia to STEM educational initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wboy.com/news/business/mylan-and-wvu-announce-10-year-collaboration/1178903614|title=Mylan and WVU announce 10 year collaboration|last=Hudock|first=Megan|date=2018-05-14|work=WBOY|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===EpiPen pricing===
{{see also|Epinephrine autoinjector#Price}}
{{see also|Heather Bresch#Mylan executive}}
Mylan acquired the right to market and distribute the EpiPen line of [[epinephrine autoinjector]] devices from Merck KGaA as part of their 2007 deal;&lt;ref name=NYT2016&gt;Tara Parker-Pope and Rachel Rabkin Peachman for the New York Times.

[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/king-pharmaceuticals-to-acquire-meridian-medical-technologies-76364227.html Press Release: King Pharmaceuticals to Acquire Meridian Medical Technologies]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bloomberg the devices deliver about $1 worth of drug.&lt;ref name=BloomMarketing&gt;Cynthia Koons and Robert Langreth for Bloomberg Businessweek.

The company also successfully lobbied the FDA to broaden the label to include risk of anaphylaxis and in parallel, successfully lobbied Congress to generate legislation making EpiPens available in schools and in public places like [[Automated external defibrillator|defibrillators]] are, and hired the same people that [[Medtronic]] had worked with on defibrillator legislation to do so.&lt;ref name=BloomMarketing/&gt;  Mylan's efforts to gain market dominance were aided when [[Sanofi]]'s competing product was recalled in November 2015 and further when Teva's generic competitor was rejected by the FDA in March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;Carly Helfand for FiercePharma March 1, 2016 [http://www.fiercepharma.com/sales-and-marketing/fda-swats-down-teva-s-epipen-copy-putting-mylan-cruise-control FDA swats down Teva's EpiPen copy, putting Mylan in cruise control]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the first half of 2015, Mylan had an 85% market share of such devices in the US&lt;ref name=BloomMarketing/&gt; and in that year sales reached around $1.5B and accounted for 40% of Mylan's profit.&lt;ref name=ForbesCould&gt;Emily Willingham  for Forbes.

Because They Could]&lt;/ref&gt;  Those profits were also due in part to Mylan's continually raising the price of EpiPens starting in 2009; in 2009 the wholesale price of two EpiPens was about $100, by July 2013 the price was about $265, in May 2015 it was around $461, and in May 2016 the price rose again to around $609,&lt;ref name=NYT2016/&gt; around a 500% jump from the price in 2009.&lt;ref name="Baltimore"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2016/08/18/cost-jumps-nearly-500-percent-for-life-saving-epipens/|title=Cost Jumps Nearly 500-Percent For Life-Saving EpiPens|last=Bartolotta|first=Devin|date=August 18, 2016|website=|publisher=CBS Baltimore|access-date=August 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Starting in 2014, according to a 2017 report in the ''New York Times'', mid-level executives began questioning the rate at which the company had increased and was planning to continue to increase the price of the Epi-Pen, and raising concerns that the price increases were unethical; the ''Times'' reported that when these concerns were brought to Robert Coury, the chairman of the board, Coury "replied that he was untroubled. He raised both his middle fingers and explained, using colorful language, that anyone criticizing Mylan, including its employees, ought to go copulate with themselves. Critics in Congress and on Wall Street, he said, should do the same. And regulators at the Food and Drug Administration? They, too, deserved a round of anatomically challenging self-fulfillment." &amp;nbsp;The ''Times'' reported that Bresch provided similarly dismissive responses.&lt;ref name="NYT2017copulate"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/04/business/angry-about-epipen-prices-executive-dont-care-much.html?_r=1|title=Outcry Over EpiPen Prices Hasn’t Made Them Lower|last1=Duhigg|first1=Charles|date=4 June 2017|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Times'' reporter noted that "Those top leaders’ responses are a far cry from the message on Mylan’s website, which says that 'we challenge every member of every team to challenge the status quo,' and that 'we put people and patients first, trusting that profits will follow.'", and also noted that "The firm is a case study in the limits of what consumer and employee activism, as well as government oversight, can achieve." &lt;ref name="NYT2017copulate" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://gizmodo.com/drug-company-chairman-to-america-go-fuck-yourself-1795816263|title=Drug Company Chairman to America: Go Fuck Yourself|last1=Novak|first1=Matt|date=5 June 2017|work=Gizmodo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/06/mylan-chairman-drug-pricing-critics-ought-to-go-copulate-with-themselves/|title=Mylan chairman: Drug pricing critics ought to go copulate with themselves|last1=Mole|first1=Beth|date=5 June 2017|work=Ars Technica|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2017/06/12/mylan-begins-harvesting-the-crop-its-sown|title=Mylan Begins Harvesting the Crop It's Sown|last1=Loew|first1=Derek|date=12 June 2017|work=In the Pipeline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2016, as parents prepared to send their children back to school and went to pharmacies to get new EpiPens, people began to express outrage at the cost of the EpiPen and Mylan was widely and harshly criticized, &lt;ref name="Gold2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kpbs.org/news/2016/feb/18/food-allergies-life-saving-drug-too-expensive/|title=People With Food Allergies Say Life-Saving Drug Too Expensive|last1=Goldberg|first1=Kenny|website=KPBS Public Media|accessdate=June 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/mylan-to-launch-cheaper-generic-epipen-alternative-1472467730|title=Mylan to Launch Cheaper Generic EpiPen Alternative|last1=Walker|first1=Joseph|date=August 30, 2016|work=Wall Street Journal|last2=Winslow|first2=Ron|last3=Steele|first3=Anne}}&lt;/ref&gt; including criticism from [[Martin Shkreli]], "poster boy for grasping pharma greed," letters from two Senators and initiation of Congressional investigations.&lt;ref name="ForbesCould" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emma Court for MarketWatch.

In September 2016, the New York State Attorney General began an investigation into Mylan's ''EpiPen4Schools'' program in New York to determine if the program's contracts violated [[Competition law|antitrust law]]&lt;ref name="bloom9616"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Larson|first1=Erik|last2=Hopkins|first2=Jared S.|title=Mylan’s EpiPen School Sales Trigger N.Y.

In October 2016 the CEO of Mylan testified to Congress that Pfizer/King charged Mylan about $34.50 for one device.&lt;ref name=NBCdevice2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=Popken|first1=Ben|title=Upgraded EpiPens torn apart.

According to the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General analysis, the U.S. government may have overpaid "as much as $1.27 billion between 2006 and 2016" to drugmaker Mylan N.V. for the EpiPen emergency allergy treatment. This represents three times the proposed settlement of $465 million announced by Mylan in October 2016. In October 2016, Mylan announced a settlement with the [[US Department of Justice]] over rebates paid by Mylan to states under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.&lt;ref name=NYToctRebate&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thomas|first1=Katie|title=Mylan to Settle EpiPen Overpricing Case for $465 Million|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/08/business/epipen-mylan-justice-department-settlement.html?ref=topics&amp;_r=0|work=The New York Times|date=October 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Questions had been raised by Congress and others about why EpiPen had been classified as a generic rather a proprietary product in the program since 1997; generic drugs have lower rebates (13%) than proprietary drugs (23%), and price hikes for generic drugs cannot be passed onto states, and a common form of [[pharmaceutical fraud]] involves misclassifying proprietary drugs as generic under the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thomas|first1=Katie|title=Is EpiPen a Brand-Name or a Generic Drug?

===Execution drugs===

Mylan manufactures [[rocuronium bromide]], which is approved by the state of [[Alabama]] for use in executions by [[lethal injection]]. European manufacturers refuse to sell drugs which can be used for executions to the United States, except to distributors or users who sign legally binding agreements that the drug will not be used for executions down the delivery chain.&lt;ref name="execution"&gt;{{cite journal

In September 2014, the [[London]]-based [[human rights]] organization [[Reprieve (organisation)|Reprieve]] told Mylan that they were the only [[FDA]]-approved manufacturer of [[rocuronium bromide]] without legal controls in place to prevent its use in executions, and there was "a very real risk that Mylan may soon become the go-to provider of execution drugs for states across the country". The German asset manager {{Interlanguage link multi|DJE Kapital|de}} [[divested]] itself of $70 million in Mylan shares for that reason. Mylan said that their distribution was "legally compliant," &lt;ref name="execution"/&gt; and that their restrictions did "prohibit resale to correctional facilities for use in lethal injections." &lt;ref name="Newsroom: Mylan Statement on its Policy Against the Use of Mylan Products in Capital Punishment"&gt;{{cite web |title=Mylan Statement on its Policy Against the Use of Mylan Products in Capital Punishment |url=http://newsroom.mylan.com/press-releases?item=123361 |publisher=Mylan |accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nicholas Joseph Begich Sr.''' (April 6, 1932 – disappeared October 16, 1972) was a [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] member of the [[US House of Representatives]] from [[Alaska]]. He is presumed to have died in the crash of a [[light aircraft]] in Alaska in 1972; his body was never found.

==Early life and education==
Begich was born and raised in [[Eveleth, Minnesota]]. His father, John Begich (né Begić), was born in [[Udbina|Podlapača, Udbina, Croatia]],&lt;ref name="begichtom"&gt;Begich, Tom.

''[[Anchorage Daily News]]''; retrieved on 2007-04-04.&lt;br&gt; Tom Begich says of his father, "Until I was nearly 12, I grew up with a man who was a legend, the son of Croatian immigrants, but who disappeared October 16, 1972, into the clouds."&lt;/ref&gt; and his mother, Anna (née Martinich), was also of [[Croats|Croatian]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/senators/begich.htm Begich family profile], freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com; accessed January 3, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Saint Cloud State University]] ([[Bachelor of Arts]], 1952) and the [[University of Minnesota]] ([[Master of Arts]], 1954) before he pursued his doctorate at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]] and at the [[University of North Dakota]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==Early career==
Begich worked as a guidance counselor in the schools of [[Anchorage]], and he was later Director of Student Personnel for the Anchorage school system before becoming Superintendent of Schools at [[Fort Richardson (Alaska)|Fort Richardson]].&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Government Printing Office, [U.S. Government Printing Office Memorial Services Held in the House of Representatives and Senate of the United States: Together with Tributes Presented in Eulogy of Nick Begich, Late a Representative from Alaska], 1973, page 52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Water Resources Association, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=YoiMU6X2C9PRsATsyoGQAQ&amp;id=VBpBAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22nick+begich%22+%22fort+richardson%22+superintendent&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22fort+richardson%22+ Water Life magazine], Volume 35, 1976, page 38.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, Begich was elected to the [[Alaska Senate]], where he served for eight years. Begich also taught [[political science]] during parts of this period at the [[University of Alaska Anchorage|University of Alaska at Anchorage]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen M. Brent, Research Institute of Alaska, Inc., [https://books.google.com/books?ei=7oiMU8XdEM_KsQSHhoLgDA&amp;id=XabnAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22nick+begich%22+%22university+of+alaska%22+instructor&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22university+of+alaska%22 The Alaska Survey and Report, 1970-1971], Volume 2, 1970, page 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
In 1968, Begich ran for [[Alaska's at-large congressional district|Alaska's only House seat]] and lost to the incumbent Representative, Republican [[Howard Pollock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dunham|first=Mike|url=http://www.adn.com/article/20110111/howard-pollock-alaskas-2nd-congressman-dies-california|title=Howard Pollock, Alaska's 2nd congressman, dies in California|publisher=''Alaska Dispatch News''|date=January 11, 2011|accessdate=May 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, Begich ran again for the seat and was now successful by defeating the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] banker [[Frank Murkowski]], who later served as a U.S. senator and then as [[Governor of Alaska]]. In 1972 for his re-election, Begich was opposed by Republican state senator [[Don Young]].

Posthumously, Begich won the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1972|1972 election]], with 56% to Don Young's 44%. However, after Begich was declared dead, a [[special election]] was held. Young won the seat and is still in the position.

==Disappearance==
[[File:Nicholas J. Begich's grave.jpg|thumb|right|Begich's memorial at the [[Congressional Cemetery]].]]
On October 16, 1972, he and [[House Majority Leader]] [[Hale Boggs]], of [[Louisiana]], were two of the four men on board a twin engine [[Cessna 310]] when the airplane disappeared during a flight from Anchorage to [[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau]]. Also on board were Begich's aide, Russell Brown, and the pilot, Don Jonz.&lt;ref name=FamousMissing&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2007-04-15
|url=http://www.check-six.com/lib/Famous_Missing/Boggs.htm
|title=Hale Boggs — Missing in Alaska |work=Famous Missing Aircraft
|publisher=Check-Six}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four were heading to a campaign fundraiser for Begich.

In an enormous search effort, [[search and rescue]] aircraft of the United States [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]], [[United States Navy|Navy]], [[United States Army|Army]], [[United States Air Force|Air Force]], [[Civil Air Patrol]] and civilians were deployed to look for the four men and the missing Cessna 310. On November 24, 1972, after proceeding for 39 days, the air search was suspended.&lt;ref&gt;National Transportation Safety Board Report ''NTSB-AAR-73-1, January 31, 1973; Aircraft Accident Report, Pan Alaska Airways, Ltd., Cessna 310C, N1812H, Missing Between Anchorage and Juneau, Alaska, October 16, 1972''; page 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Neither the airplane nor any of its four occupants were ever found. All were [[declared death in absentia|declared dead]] on December 29, 1972.

The Cessna was required to carry an [[Emergency position-indicating radiobeacon station|emergency locator transmitter]] (ELT) per Alaska state statutes section 02.35.115, Downed Aircraft Transmitting Devices, which took effect on September 6, 1972,&lt;ref&gt;''Fairbanks Daily News-Miner'', Fairbanks, Alaska, Wednesday September 6, 1972, page 20, column 9.&lt;/ref&gt; five weeks before the plane disappeared. The Alaska statute made reference to [[Federal Aviation Regulations|Federal Aviation Regulation]] 91.52, published on September 21, 1971, which mandated ELTs in aircraft such as this, but had an effective date of December 30, 1973, for existing aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;''Federal Register'', Volume 36, Number 50, March 13, 1971, pages 4,878 to 4,881.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;FR 36-183, September 21, 1971, pages 18,716 to 18,725.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Washington State Department of Transportation, [http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/aviation/sar/elt_history.htm Emergency Locator Transmitters (ELTs), Source: October 2000 Civil Air Patrol News], retrieved October 4, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

No ELT signal determined to be from the plane was heard during the search. In its report on the incident, the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) stated that the pilot's portable ELT, permissible in lieu of a fixed ELT on the plane, was found in an aircraft at [[Fairbanks, Alaska]]. The report also notes that a witness saw an unidentified object in the pilot's briefcase that resembled, except for color, the portable ELT. The NTSB concluded that neither the pilot nor aircraft had an ELT.&lt;ref&gt;National Transportation Safety Board Report ''NTSB-AAR-73-1, January 31, 1973''; pages 6–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, a ''[[Seattle Weekly]]'' story detailed the work of journalist of Jonathan Walczak, who since 2012 has investigated the plane crash and subsequent events in an effort to determine the fate of the flight that carried Begich and Boggs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Anderson |first=Rick |date=November 3, 2015 |title=In 1972, Two U.S Representatives Boarded a Plane and Disappeared.

Nick Jr., Nick Begich's son, claims his father was assassinated by elements within the US government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|website=The Alex Jones Show|date=March 23, 2017|accessdate=March 29, 2017|title=Man Who Predicted Globalist Agenda Speaks Out|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx5zXCtI9ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, the tallest building in [[Whittier, Alaska]], was renamed to [[Begich Towers]] in memory of Nick Begich.

==Personal life==
Nick Begich had six children: [[Mark Begich|Mark]], Nichelle, [[Tom Begich|Tom]], Stephanie, Paul, and [[Nick Begich (author)|Nick Jr.]]

His son Mark Begich was elected as a member of the Anchorage Borough Assembly, then became Mayor, and was narrowly elected as the junior [[U.S. Senator]] from Alaska. The incumbent, [[Ted Stevens]], had been convicted of seven felonies, eight days before the 2008 election, after being caught up in the [[Alaska political corruption probe]]. Stevens had been the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]'s longest-serving U.S. senator. He too was killed in a small plane crash nearly two years later, though not before the criminal convictions had been overturned. Mark Begich lost his Senate re-election bid in 2014.

His son [[Tom Begich|Tom]] won the Democratic primary nomination for a seat in the [[Alaska Senate]] in 2016, and faced no opposition in the general election.

Nick's brother [[Joseph Begich]] served 18 years in the Minnesota House of Representatives from their hometown of [[Eveleth, Minnesota|Eveleth]].&lt;ref&gt;Minnesota State Legislature, [http://www.leg.state.mn.us/legdb/fulldetail.aspx?ID=10037 Biography, Joseph R. Begich], retrieved June 2, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nick Begich's widow, Pegge Begich, ran for the House of Representatives seat in 1984 and 1986, but she was defeated by the incumbent, Don Young. She later retired and lived in [[Nevada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Anderson |first=Rick |date=November 3, 2015 |title=In 1972, Two U.S Representatives Boarded a Plane and Disappeared.

'''Nipper''' (1884–1895) was a [[dog]] from [[Bristol]], England, who served as the model for a painting by [[Francis Barraud]] titled "[[His Master's Voice]]". This image was the basis for the dog-and-[[phonograph|gramophone]]  [[trademark]], one of the world's most famous that was used by several audio recording and associated company brands, including [[Berliner Gramophone]] and its various successors, affiliates, and successors, including Berliner's German subsidiary [[Deutsche Grammophon]]; Berliner's American successor the [[Victor Talking Machine Company|Victor Talking Machine Co.]] (later known as [[RCA Records|RCA Victor]] and then [[RCA Records]]); Victor's [[Bluebird Records|Bluebird]] label; [[Zonophone]]; Berliner's (and later Victor's) British affiliate the [[Gramophone Company|Gramophone Co. Ltd.]] (informally known as His Master's Voice) and its successors [[EMI]] and [[HMV|HMV Retail Ltd.]]; the Gramophone Co.'s German subsidiary [[Electrola]]; [[Zonophone]]; and onetime Victor subsidiary the [[JVC|Japan Victor Company (JVC)]].

Nipper originally lived with his owner, Mark Henry Barraud, in the Prince's Theatre where Barraud was a scenery designer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of the Department of Computer Science|url=https://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/history/|accessdate=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Barraud died in 1887, his brothers Philip and [[Francis Barraud|Francis]] took care of the dog. Nipper himself died of natural causes in 1895 and was buried in [[Kingston upon Thames]] in Clarence Street, in a small park surrounded by [[magnolia]] trees. As time progressed the area was built upon, and a branch of [[Lloyds Bank]] now occupies the site. On the wall of the bank, just inside the entrance, a brass plaque commemorates the terrier that lies beneath the building.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.londondogforum.co.uk/nipper-his-masters-voice-c294.html Nipper - His Master's Voice - The London Dog Forum&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 March 2010, a small road near to the dog's resting place in Kingston upon Thames was named Nipper Alley in commemoration of this resident.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.surreycomet.co.uk/news/4826539.Kingston_s_Toilet_Gallery_alley_named_after_HMV_dog_Nipper/  Surrey Comet News: Kingston's Toilet Gallery alley named after HMV dog Nipper (Posted: January 1, 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1898, three years after Nipper's death, [[Francis Barraud]], his last owner and brother of his first owner, painted a picture of Nipper listening intently to a wind-up [[Edison-Bell]] cylinder [[phonograph]].  Thinking the Edison-Bell Company located in New Jersey, USA,&lt;ref name="the nipper saga"/&gt; might find it useful, he presented it to James E. Hough, who promptly said, "Dogs don't listen to phonographs". On May 31, 1899, Barraud went to the Maiden Lane offices of [[Gramophone Company|The Gramophone Company]] with the intention of borrowing a brass horn to replace the original black horn on the painting. Manager William Barry Owen suggested that if the artist replaced the machine with a [[Emile Berliner|Berliner]] disc [[phonograph|gramophone]], that he would buy the painting. The image became the successful trademark of the [[Victor Talking Machine Company|Victor]] and [[His Master's Voice|HMV]] record labels, [[HMV]] music stores, and the [[Radio Corporation of America]], after the acquisition of the Victor company in 1929. The trademark  was registered by Berliner for use in the United States on July 10, 1900.&lt;ref&gt;Vaclav Smil, ''Creating the Twentieth Century: Technical Innovations of 1867–1914 and Their Lasting Impact'' ([[Oxford University Press]], 2005), p240&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[His Master's Voice]] for a complete history of the brands based on Nipper.)

The slogan "[[His Master's Voice]]", along with the painting, was sold to The Gramophone Company for 100 pounds sterling - 50 pounds for the copyright and 50 pounds for the painting itself.&lt;ref&gt;Petts, Leonard. (1973). The Story of "Nipper" and the "His Master's Voice" Francis Barraud's painting. Talking Machine Review, 19 Glendale Road Bournemouth BH6 4JA England. SBN 902338161&lt;/ref&gt; Francis Barraud said : "It is difficult to say how the idea came to me beyond the fact that it suddenly occurred to me that to have my dog listening to the phonograph, with an intelligent and rather puzzled expression, and call it 'His Master's Voice' would make an excellent subject. We had a phonograph and I often noticed how puzzled he was to make out where the voice came from. It certainly was the happiest thought I ever had."&lt;ref name="Rolfs"&gt;Rolfs, Joan &amp; Robin.

The original oil painting hung in the EMI board room in [[Hayes, Hillingdon|Hayes, Middlesex]], for many years.

The iconic image of a mixed fox/bull terrier, Nipper, looking into a phonograph became an international symbol of quality and excellence for the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history.delaware.gov/museums/jvm/nipper.shtml |title=Johnson Victrola Museum, Dover, Delaware}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nipper lives on through the brand names; he even appeared in ads on television with his "son", a puppy named Chipper who was added to the RCA family in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20010825085124/http://www.rca.com/content/viewdetail/1,2811,EI268-CI263,00.html Chipper]&lt;/ref&gt; Real dogs continue to play the roles of Nipper and Chipper, but Chipper has to be replaced much more frequently, since his character is a puppy.

Nipper continues to be the mascot of [[HMV]] stores in countries where the entertainment retailer has the rights to him. Both [[RCA Records]] and [[EMI]] have deemphasized Nipper in the global music market due to the fragmented ownership of the trademark.

Victor Company of Japan ([[JVC]]) also uses the logo within Japan, which includes the "His Master's Voice" slogan.

A huge, four-ton Nipper can be seen on the roof of the old RTA (former RCA distributor) building now owned by Arnoff Moving &amp; Storage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.arnoff.com/about-us.aspx|work=Arnoff Moving &amp; Storage - New York's Hudson Valley Mover of Choice|accessdate=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and located at 991 Broadway in [[Albany, New York]].&lt;ref name="Rolfs" /&gt; A second slightly smaller one was purchased by Jim Wells from RCA in Baltimore for $1. After spending many years on private property in [[Nipper Park in Merrifield, Virginia]], perched over [[Lee Highway]] (U.S. Route 29), has now been returned to [[Baltimore, Maryland]], where it originally graced the former RCA Building on Russell Street. Nipper now sits atop the [[Maryland Historical Society]] building at Park Avenue and West Centre Street in Baltimore. Though smaller than the Albany Nipper, Baltimore's includes a [[phonograph|gramophone]] for Nipper to listen to. The Baltimore Nipper was saved when the Virginia site where he briefly resided was sold to developers. It is currently the location of a group of townhomes. The street leading to the development is named Nipper Way.&lt;ref&gt;[https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;time=&amp;date=&amp;ttype=&amp;q=nipper+way,+fairfax,+VA&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=54.357317,114.257813&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=38.874296,-77.24719&amp;spn=0.006599,0.013947&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;om=0 Maps.google.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

A small statue of Nipper can be seen perched above a doorway in the Merchant Venturers Building on the corner of Park Row and Woodland Road in Bristol; this building, part of the [[University of Bristol]], stands near the site of the old Prince's Theatre.

A life-size ornament of Nipper appears in the music video to [[Cyndi Lauper]]'s song "[[Time After Time (Cyndi Lauper song)|Time After Time]]."

Nipper has also been the subject of [[Parody|parodies]]. One example can be found on the cover of the 1982 [[Bootleg recording|bootleg]] compilation album ''[[Elvis' Greatest Shit]]'', a collection of recordings that, in the bootlegger's opinion, were among the worst that [[Elvis Presley]] made. The album's putative record company was "Dog Vomit" instead of RCA Victor, Presley's label during almost all of his career, and its logo featured a dog resembling Nipper vomiting into a gramophone.

Currently, as of May 2017, the City of Albany is holding a contest for various groups or artists to submit designs for creative, painted Nipper statues to be placed throughout the City.  Ten of the contestants will be chosen to create ten Nipper statues - which will be displayed for one year and then auctioned off for charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barnes|first1=Steve|title=Albany summer street exhibit features Nipper statues|url=http://www.timesunion.com/entertainment/article/Albany-summer-street-exhibit-features-Nipper-11218939.php|accessdate=3 September 2017|work=Times Union|date=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in 1829 the zoologist [[Edward Turner Bennett]] said as a conclusion to his chapter on grizzly bears:

{{quote|In no respect has the subject of the present notice, whose portrait admirably illustrates the peculiarities of his species, degenerated from the race of which he appears to be the sole representative in Europe. He was presented to his late majesty, more than seventeen years ago, by the Hudson’s Bay Company, and has long been the oldest inhabitant of the Tower Menagerie. The name of Martin, which was originally bestowed upon him, in imitation probably of that of the most celebrated bear ever exhibited in Europe, has consequently been of late years generally preceded by the epithet of antiquity, and Old Martin has become under that title almost as well known as his famous namesake. His size is far superior to that of any other bear that has ever been seen in this quarter of the globe; and his ferocity, in spite of the length of time during which he has been a prisoner, and of all the attempts that have been made to conciliate him, still continues undiminished. He does not offer the slightest encouragement to familiarity on the part of his keepers, but treats them with as much distance as the most perfect strangers; and although he will sometimes appear playful and good tempered, yet they know him too well to trust themselves within his clutch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Gutenberg book|no=53764|name=The Tower Menagerie|bullet=none}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Menagerie.satire.engl.jpg|thumb|300px|A satirical view of the Royal&amp;nbsp;Menagerie, 1812]]
During Old Martin's stay at the Tower, in 1816, a [[Yeomen Warder]] on night duty saw a ghostly bear near the Martin Tower and, terrified, he struck at it with his bayonet only to find it went right through the vision and stuck into the door behind.&lt;ref name=spragg2014 /&gt; It was said the guard died of shock a few hours afterwards.&lt;ref name=spragg2014 /&gt;&lt;ref name="hrpghost" /&gt; Old Martin was not the first bear to have lived at the Tower of London because in 1251 [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] had been given a [[polar bear]] by the king of Norway, [[Haakon the Young]].&lt;ref name="hrpghost"&gt;{{cite web|title=A grizzly ghost|url=http://www.hrp.org.uk/discover-the-palaces/ghost-stories/a-grizzly-ghost/#gs.xXoBC44|website=www.hrp.org.uk|publisher=Historic Royal Palaces|accessdate=24 March 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170325025827/http://www.hrp.org.uk/discover-the-palaces/ghost-stories/a-grizzly-ghost/#gs.xXoBC44|archivedate=25 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2234">'''Personoid''' is the concept coined by [[Stanislaw Lem]] (1971), a Polish science-fiction writer. His personoids are an abstraction of functions of human [[mind]] and they live in computers; they do not need any human-like physical body. 

In [[cognitive science|cognitive]] and [[software]] modeling, ''personoid'' is a research approach to the development of intelligent autonomous agents.
In frame of the IPK (Information, Preferences, Knowledge) architecture, it is a framework of abstract [[intelligent agent]] with a  cognitive and structural intelligence. It can be seen as an essence of high intelligent entities.

From the philosophical and [[systemics]] perspectives, personoid societies can also be seen as the [[Carrier (bearer)|carriers]] of a [[culture]]. According to N. Gessler, the personoids study can be a base for the research on ''[[artificial culture]]'' and ''culture evolution''.

{{Prayer}}
'''Prayer''' is an [[invocation]] or act that seeks to activate a [[rapport]] with an object of [[worship]], typically a [[deity]],  through deliberate [[communication]]. In the narrow sense, the term refers to an act of [[supplication]] or [[intercession]] directed towards a [[deity]], or a deified [[ancestor worship|ancestor]]. More generally, prayer can also have the purpose of [[thanksgiving]] or [[praise]], and in [[comparative religion]] is closely associated with more abstract forms of [[meditation]] and with [[Incantation|charms or spells]].&lt;ref&gt;F.B. Jevons, '''An Introduction to the Study of Comparative Religion'' (1908), [https://books.google.com/books?id=HgddDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA73  p. 73]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prayer can take a variety of forms: it can be part of a set [[liturgy]] or [[ritual]], and it can be performed alone or in groups. Prayer may take the form of a [[hymn]], [[incantation]], formal [[creed]]al statement, or a spontaneous utterance in the praying person.

Today, most major [[religion]]s involve prayer in one way or another; some ritualize the act, requiring a strict sequence of actions or placing a restriction on who is permitted to pray, while others teach that prayer may be practised spontaneously by anyone at any time.

==Etymology==
The English term ''prayer'' is from  [[Medieval Latin]] ''precaria'' "petition, prayer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harper|first1=Douglas|title=pray (v.)|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=pray|website=etymonline.com|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=30 December 2014}}
Via Old French ''prier'', nominalised use of the Latin adjective ''precaria'' "something obtained by entreating, something given as a favour", from ''precari'' "to ask for, entreat".&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Vulgate]] Latin is ''[[:wikt:oratio|oratio]]'', which translates Greek [[:wikt:προσευχή|προσευχή]]&lt;ref&gt;Biblical synonyms or alternatives for προσευχή: εὐχή, δέησις, ἔντευξις, εὐχαριστία, αἴτημα, ἱκετηρία. Richard C. Trench, Synonyms of the New Testament, s.v. [https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/trench/section.cfm?sectionID=51 εὐχή].&lt;/ref&gt; in turn the  [[Septuagint]] translation  of [[Biblical Hebrew]] {{lang|he|[[:wikt:תפילה|תְּפִלָּה]]}} ''tĕphillah''.&lt;ref&gt;''Strong's Concordance'' [https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H8605&amp;t=KJV H8605].&lt;/ref&gt;

Various spiritual traditions offer a wide variety of devotional acts. There are morning and evening prayers, [[Grace (prayer)|graces said over meals]], and reverent physical gestures. Some Christians bow their heads and fold their hands. Some [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] regard dancing as a form of prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Littlebird |first= Sarracina|title= Sacred Movement: Dance as Prayer in the Pueblo Cultures of the American Southwest |publisher= Barnard College Department of Dance |year= 2008 |url= http://dance.barnard.edu/sites/default/files/inline/sarracina_littlebird.pdf |accessdate= 11 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Sufism|Sufis]] [[Sufi whirling|whirl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= The Whirling Dervishes of Rumi – Sufism and Dervishes |url= http://www.whirlingdervishes.org/whirlingdervishes.htm |work= WhirlingDervishes.org |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141104195830/http://www.whirlingdervishes.org/whirlingdervishes.htm |archivedate= 2014-11-04 |deadurl= no }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hindus chant mantras.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Omkarananda |first= Swami |title= How to Pray |publisher= Omkarananda Ashram Himalayas |date= n.d.  |url= http://www.omkarananda-ashram.org/Publications/how_to_pray.htm |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141104195625/http://www.omkarananda-ashram.org/Publications/how_to_pray.htm |archive-date= 2014-11-04 |deadurl= no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish prayer may involve [[Shuckling|swaying]] back and forth and bowing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Judaism: Jewish Rituals and Practices – Jewish Worship and Prayer |work= ReligionFacts.com |publisher= ReligionFacts |author= Anonymous |date= 2013-07-03 |url= http://www.religionfacts.com/judaism/practices/worship_prayer.htm |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141104200647/http://www.religionfacts.com/judaism/practices/worship_prayer.htm |archive-date= 2014-11-04 |deadurl= no }}. This practice is known, in [[Yiddish]], as ''shuckling''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muslims]] practice ''[[salat]]'' (kneeling and [[prostration]]) in their prayers. Quakers keep silent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Avery|first=Chel|title=Quaker Worship|publisher=Quaker Information Center| url = http://www.quakerinfo.org/quakerism/worship.html|accessdate=2008-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some pray according to standardized rituals and liturgies, while others prefer extemporaneous prayers. Still others combine the two.

[[Friedrich Heiler]] is often cited in Christian circles for his systematic ''Typology of Prayer'' which lists six types of prayer: primitive, ritual, Greek cultural, philosophical, mystical, and prophetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Erickson, Millard J.|title=Christian theology|publisher=Baker Book House|location=Grand Rapids|year=1998|isbn=0-8010-2182-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some forms of prayer require a prior ritualistic form of cleansing or purification such as in [[ghusl]] and [[wudhu]].&lt;ref&gt;The New Encyclopedia of Islam - Page 20, Cyril Glassé - 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Prayer may be done privately and individually, or it may be done corporately in the presence of fellow believers. Prayer can be incorporated into a daily "thought life", in which one is in constant communication with a god. Some people pray throughout all that is happening during the day and seek guidance as the day progresses. This is actually regarded as a requirement in several Christian denominations,&lt;ref name=catholic&gt;{{Catholic |last= Wynne |first= John |volume= 12 |title= Prayer |url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm |no-icon= 1 |prescript= }}&lt;/ref&gt; although enforcement is not possible nor desirable. There can be many different answers to prayer, just as there are many ways to interpret an answer to a question, if there in fact comes an answer.&lt;ref name=catholic/&gt; Some may experience audible, physical, or mental epiphanies. If indeed an answer comes, the time and place it comes is considered random.

One less noticeable act related to prayer is [[fasting]].

A variety of body postures may be assumed, often with specific meaning (mainly respect or adoration) associated with them: standing; sitting; kneeling; prostrate on the floor; eyes opened; eyes closed; hands folded or clasped; hands upraised; holding hands with others; a laying on of hands and others. Prayers may be recited from memory, read from a book of prayers, or composed spontaneously as they are prayed. They may be said, chanted, or sung. They may be with musical accompaniment or not. There may be a time of outward silence while prayers are offered mentally. Often, there are prayers to fit specific occasions, such as the blessing of a meal, the birth or death of a loved one, other significant events in the life of a believer, or days of the year that have special religious significance. Details corresponding to specific traditions are outlined below.

[[File:Praying Germanic man 1890.jpg|thumb|A kneeling position with raised hands expressed "supplication" in classical antiquity. The word for "prayer" and for "supplication" is identical in ancient languages (''oratio'', προσευχή,  תְּפִלָּה etc.), with no terminological distinction between supplications addressed to human as opposed to divine powers.
Statuette known as "Praying German" or "supplicating barbarian". It is not known if this figure was originally set in a context of religious prayer or of military surrender.&lt;ref&gt;Image from [https://archive.org/details/artscraftsofourt00brow "The arts and crafts of our Teutonic forefathers"] by G. B. Brown (1910), where it is glossed as "Bronze figure of a German, Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris". "the existence of other bronze barbarians in similar attitudes of prayer and subjection suggests that the composition was a popular one" (Melissa Barden Dowling, Clemency and cruelty in the Roman world, 2006, p. 151)&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Anthropologically, the concept of prayer is closely related to that of [[Submission|surrender]] and [[supplication]]. 
The traditional posture of prayer in medieval Europe is kneeling or supine with clasped hands, in antiquity more typically with raised hands. The early Christian prayer posture was standing, looking up to heaven, with outspread arms and bare head. This is the pre-Christian, pagan prayer posture (except for the bare head, which was prescribed for males in Corinthians 11:4, in Roman paganism, the head had to be covered in prayer). Certain Cretan and Cypriote figures of the Late Bronze Age, with arms raised, have been interpreted as worshippers. Their posture is similar to the "flight" posture, a crouching posture with raised hands, observed in schizophrenic patients and related to the universal [[list of gestures|"hands up" gesture]] of surrender. The kneeling posture with clasped hands appears to have been introduced only with the beginning high medieval period, presumably adopted from a gesture of feudal homage.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Claire; Russell, W.M.S. (1989). "Cultural Evolution of Behaviour". Netherlands Journal of Zoology. 40 (4): 745–762 (756f.). doi:10.1163/156854290X00190.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although prayer in its literal sense is not used in [[animism]], communication with the spirit world is vital to the animist way of life. This is usually accomplished through a [[shaman]] who, through a [[trance]], gains access to the spirit world and then shows the spirits' thoughts to the people. Other ways to receive messages from the spirits include using [[astrology]] or contemplating [[Fortune telling|fortune tellers]] and healers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omf.org/omf/cambodia/about_cambodia/animism_profile|publisher=OMF|title=Animism Profile in Cambodia|accessdate=2008-04-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912124231/http://www.omf.org/omf/cambodia/about_cambodia/animism_profile|archivedate=2007-09-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some of the oldest extant literature, such as the Sumerian temple hymns of [[Enheduanna]] (c. 23th century BC) are liturgy addressed to deities and thus technically "prayer". The Egyptian [[Pyramid Texts]] of about the same period similarly contain spells or incantations addressed to the gods. In the loosest sense, in the form of [[magical thinking]] combined with [[animism]], prayer has been argued as representing a [[human cultural universal]], which would have been present since the emergence of [[behavioral modernity]], by [[anthropology|anthropologists]]  such as Sir [[Edward Burnett Tylor]] and Sir [[James George Frazer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Zaleski, Carol |author2=Zaleski, Philip |title=Prayer: A History|publisher=Mariner Books|location=Boston|year=2006|pages=24–25|isbn=0-618-77360-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reliable records are available for the [[polytheism|polytheistic]] religions of the [[Iron Age]], most notably [[Ancient Greek religion]] (which strongly influenced [[religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]]). These religious traditions were direct developments of the earlier [[Prehistoric religion#Bronze Age Europe|Bronze Age religions]].
Ceremonial prayer was highly formulaic and [[ritual]]ized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rayor|first=Diane|title=The Homeric Hymns| publisher=University of California Press|url=http://www.ucpress.edu/books/pages/9232/9232.intro.php| accessdate=2009-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Religio Romana|publisher=Nova Roma|url=http://www.novaroma.org/religio_romana/posture.html|accessdate=2009-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In ancient polytheism, [[ancestor worship]] is indistinguishable from theistic worship (see also [[Euhemerism]]).
Vestiges of ancestor worship persist, to a greater or lesser extent, in modern religious traditions throughout the world, most notably in Japanese [[Shinto]] and in [[Chinese ancestor worship|Chinese folk religion]]. The practices involved in [[Shinto]] prayer are heavily influenced by Buddhism; [[Japanese Buddhism]] has also been strongly influenced by Shinto in turn.  Shinto prayers quite frequently consist of wishes or favors asked of the ''[[kami]]'', rather than lengthy praises or devotions. The practice of [[votive offering]] is also universal, and is attested at least since the Bronze Age. In Shinto, this takes the form of a small wooden tablet, called an ''[[ema (Shintō)|ema]]''.

Prayers in [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] were used in the Roman world by [[augur]]s and other [[oracle]]s long after Etruscan became a dead language. The [[Carmen Arvale]] and the [[Carmen Saliare]] are two specimens of partially preserved prayers that seem to have been unintelligible to their scribes, and whose language is full of [[archaism]]s and difficult passages.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederic de Forest Allen]], ''Remnants of Early Latin'' (Boston: Ginn &amp; Heath 1880 and Ginn &amp; Co 1907).&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman prayers and [[sacrifice]]s were often envisioned as [[religious law|legal]] bargains between deity and worshipper. The Roman principle was expressed as ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#do ut des|do ut des]]'': "I give, so that you may give." [[Cato the Elder]]'s treatise on [[agriculture]] contains many examples of preserved traditional prayers; in one, a farmer addresses the unknown deity of a possibly sacred grove, and sacrifices a pig in order to placate the god or goddess of the place and beseech his or her permission to cut down some trees from the grove.&lt;ref&gt;e.g.: [[Cato the Elder|Cato]]'s Mars Prayer, found in ''[[De Agri Cultura]]'' (141), English translation at: {{citation |url= http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/iedocctr/ie-texts/Mars-prayer.html |contribution= Cato's Mars Prayer |title= Indo-European Texts: Old Latin |editor1= Jonathan Slocum |editor2= Carol Justus |date= 13 May 2014 |publisher= [[Linguistics Research Center at UT Austin]] |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060903231425/http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/iedocctr/ie-texts/Mars-prayer.html |archivedate= 3 September 2006 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ring48.jpg|upright|thumb|The [[valkyrie]] [[Sigrdrífa]] says a [[Norse paganism|pagan Norse]] prayer in ''[[Sigrdrífumál]]''; Illustration by [[Arthur Rackham]]]]
[[Celtic polytheism|Celtic]], [[Germanic paganism|Germanic]] and [[Slavic paganism|Slavic]] religions are recorded much later, and much more fragmentarily, than the religions of classical antiquity. They nevertheless show substantial parallels to the better-attested religions of the Iron Age. In the case of Germanic religion, the practice of prayer is reliably attested, but no actual liturgy is recorded from the early (Roman era) period. An Old Norse prayer is on record in the form of a dramatization in [[skaldic poetry]]. This prayer is recorded in stanzas 2 and 3 of the poem ''[[Sigrdrífumál]]'', compiled in the 13th century ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' from earlier traditional sources, where the [[valkyrie]] [[Sigrdrífa]] prays to the gods and the [[Jörð|earth]] after being woken by the hero [[Sigurd]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/poe/poe25.htm|title=The Poetic Edda: Sigrdrifumol|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A prayer to [[Odin]] is mentioned in chapter 2 of the ''[[Völsunga saga]]'' where King [[Rerir]] prays for a child.   In stanza 9 of the poem ''[[Oddrúnargrátr]]'', a prayer is made to "kind [[Vættir|wights]], Frigg and [[Freyja]], and many gods&lt;ref&gt;"although since the poem is often considered one of the youngest poems in the Poetic Edda, the passage has been the matter of some debate." [[Stephan Grundy|Grundy, Stephan]] (1998). "Freyja and Frigg" as collected in Billington, Sandra. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=IoW9yhkrFJoC&amp;printsec=frontcover The Concept of the Goddess]'', p. 60.

[[Folk religion]] in the medieval period produced [[syncretism]]s between pre-Christian and Christian traditions. An example is the 11th-century [[Anglo-Saxon]] charm ''[[Æcerbot]]'' for the  fertility of crops and land, or the medical ''[[Wið færstice]]''.&lt;ref name=GORDON88-90&gt;[[Gordon, R. K.]] (1962).

In [[Australian Aboriginal mythology]], prayers to the "Great Wit" are performed by the "clever men" and "clever women", or ''kadji''. These [[Australian Aborigines|Aboriginal]] shamans use [[maban]] or mabain, the material that is believed to give them their purported magical powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Elkin|first=Adolphus P.|title=Aboriginal Men of High Degree: Initiation and Sorcery in the World's Oldest Tradition|publisher=Inner Traditions - Bear &amp; Company|year=1973|isbn=0-89281-421-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Puebloan peoples|Pueblo]] Indians are known to have used [[prayer stick]]s, that is, sticks with feathers attached as supplicatory offerings. The [[Hopi]] Indians used prayer sticks as well, but they attached to it a small bag of sacred meal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Prayer stick|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approaches to prayer==
{{bias|bias=Judeo-Christian views and religions|date=May 2018}}

===Direct petitions===
The most common form of prayer is to directly appeal to a deity to grant one's requests.{{cn|date=May 2018}} Some have termed this as the social approach to prayer.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, Moshe. Biblical Prose Prayer: As a Window to the Popular Religion of Ancient Israel. Berkeley: University of California Press, c1983 [http://ark.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/ft8b69p1w7/]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Atheist]] arguments against prayer are mostly directed against [[Supplication|petitionary prayer]] in particular. [[Daniel Dennett]] argued that petitionary prayer might have the undesirable psychological effect of relieving a person of the need to take active measures.&lt;ref&gt;"Surely it does the world no harm if those who can honestly do so pray for me! No, I'm not at all sure about that. For one thing, if they ''really'' wanted to do something useful, they could devote their prayer time and energy to some pressing project that they can do something about" {{cite book |first= Daniel C. |last= Dennett |authorlink= Daniel Dennett |contribution= Thank Goodness |title= The Portable Atheist: Essential Readings for the Nonbeliever |editor-last= Hitchens |editor-first= Christopher |editor-link= Christopher Hitchens |year= 2007 |publisher= Da Capo Press |location= Philadelphia |isbn= 9780306816086 |oclc= 156811900 |page= }}{{page needed|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This potential drawback manifests in extreme forms in such cases as [[Christian Scientists]] who rely on prayers instead of seeking medical treatment for family members for easily curable conditions which later result in death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/06/us/in-child-deaths-a-test-for-christian-science.html?pagewanted=all |title= In Child Deaths, a Test for Christian Science |first= David |last= Margolick |date= 6 August 1990 |newspaper= The New York Times |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141104202219/http://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/06/us/in-child-deaths-a-test-for-christian-science.html?pagewanted=all |archive-date= 2014-11-04 |deadurl= no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christopher Hitchens]] (2012) argued that praying to a god which is omnipotent and all-knowing would be presumptuous. For example, he interprets [[Ambrose Bierce]]'s definition of prayer by stating that "the man who prays is the one who thinks that god has arranged matters all wrong, but who also thinks that he can instruct god how to put them right."&lt;ref name="Hitchens 2012 n.p"&gt;{{cite book |title= [[Mortality (book)|Mortality]] |last= Hitchens |first= Christopher |authorlink= Christopher Hitchens |year= 2012 |publisher= Twelve |place= New York |isbn= 9781455502752 |oclc= 776526158 |page= }}{{page needed|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Educational approach===
In this view, prayer is not a conversation. Rather, it is meant to inculcate certain attitudes in the one who prays, but not to influence. Among Jews, this has been the approach of Rabbenu Bachya, Rabbi [[Yehuda Halevi]], [[Joseph Albo]], [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]], and [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]]. This view is expressed by Rabbi [[Nosson Scherman]] in the overview to the [[Artscroll]] [[Siddur]] (p.&amp;nbsp;XIII).

Among Christian theologians, [[Edward McKendree Bounds|E.M. Bounds]] stated the educational purpose of prayer in every chapter of his book, ''The Necessity of Prayer''. Prayer books such as the [[Book of Common Prayer]] are both a result of this approach and an exhortation to keep it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bounds|first=Edward McKendree|title=The Necessity of Prayer|publisher=AGES Software|year=1907|isbn=0-8010-0659-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rationalist approach===
In this view, the ultimate goal of prayer is to help train a person to focus on divinity through philosophy and intellectual contemplation ([[meditation]]). This approach was taken by the Jewish scholar and philosopher [[Maimonides]] &lt;ref&gt;Guide to the Perplexed 3:51&lt;/ref&gt; and the other medieval rationalists.&lt;ref&gt;Sefer Ha'Ikarim 4:18&lt;/ref&gt; It became popular in Jewish, Christian, and Islamic intellectual circles, but never became the most popular understanding of prayer among the laity in any of these faiths. In all three of these faiths today, a significant minority of people still hold to this approach.

===Experiential approach===
[[File:Theophile Lybaert - Old Flanders.jpeg|thumb|''Old woman praying'' by [[Théophile Lybaert]]]]
In this approach, the purpose of prayer is to enable the person praying to gain a direct experience of the recipient of the prayer (or as close to direct as a specific theology permits). This approach is very significant in Christianity and widespread in Judaism (although less popular theologically). In [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], this approach is known as [[hesychasm]]. It is also widespread in [[Sufi]] Islam, and in some forms of [[mysticism]]. It has some similarities with the rationalist approach, since it can also involve [[contemplation]], although the contemplation is not generally viewed as being as rational or intellectual.  Christian and Roman Catholic traditions also include an experiential approach to prayer within the practice of [[Lectio Divina]], historically a [[Benedictine]] practice in which scripture is read aloud; actively meditated upon using the intellect (but not analysis) possibly using the mind to place the listener within a relationship or dialogue with the text that was read; a prayer spoken; and finally concludes with [[Lectio Divina#Contemplatio: contemplate|contemplation]], a more passive experiential approach than the previous meditation, which is characterized by the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] as an experience of consciously being attentive, and having a silent love toward God, which the individual experiences without demanding to receive an experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p4s1c3a1.htm|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church - Expressions of prayer|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experience of God within [[Apophatic theology|Christian mysticism]] has been contrasted with the concept of experiential religion or [[Religious experience|mystical experience]] because of a long history or authors living and writing about experience with the divine in a manner that identifies God as unknowable and ineffable, the language of such ideas could be characterized paradoxically as "experiential", as well as without the phenomena of experience.&lt;ref&gt;''The Darkness of God: Negativity in Christian Mysticism'' by Denys Turner 1998 Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0521645611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of "religious experience" can be traced back to [[William James]], who used a term called "religious experience" in his book, ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]''.{{sfn|Hori|1999|p=47}}{{Citation not found}} The origins of the use of this term can be dated further back.

In the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, several historical figures put forth very influential views that religion and its beliefs can be grounded in experience itself. While [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] held that [[Moral obligation|moral experience]] justified [[religious belief]]s, [[John Wesley]] in addition to stressing individual moral exertion thought that the religious experiences in the [[Methodist movement]] (paralleling the [[Romantic Movement]]) were foundational to religious commitment as a way of life.&lt;ref&gt;Issues in Science and Religion, [[Ian Barbour]], [[Prentice-Hall]], 1966, page 68, 79&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wayne Proudfoot]] traces the roots of the notion of "religious experience" to the German theologian [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] (1768–1834), who argued that religion is based on a feeling of the infinite. The notion of "religious experience" was used by Schleiermacher and [[Albrecht Ritschl|Albert Ritschl]] to defend religion against the growing scientific and secular critique, and defend the view that human (moral and religious) experience justifies [[religious belief]]s.

Such religious empiricism would be later seen as highly problematic and was&amp;nbsp;— during the period in-between world wars&amp;nbsp;— famously rejected by [[Karl Barth]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Issues in Science and Religion]], [[Ian Barbour]], [[Prentice-Hall]], 1966, page 114, 116-119&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, religious as well as moral experience as justification for religious beliefs still holds sway. Some influential modern scholars holding this [[Liberal Christianity|liberal theological]] view are [[Charles E. Raven|Charles Raven]] and the Oxford physicist/theologian [[Charles Coulson]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Issues in Science and Religion]], [[Ian Barbour]], [[Prentice-Hall]], 1966, p. 126-127&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of "religious experience" was adopted by many scholars of religion, of whom William James was the most influential.{{sfn|Sharf|2000|p=271}}{{Citation not found}}{{refn|group=note|James also gives descriptions of conversion experiences. The Christian model of dramatic conversions, based on the role-model of Paul's conversion, may also have served as a model for Western interpretations and expectations regarding "enlightenment", similar to Protestant influences on Theravada Buddhism, as described by Carrithers: "It rests upon the notion of the primacy of religious experiences, preferably spectacular ones, as the origin and legitimation of religious action. But this presupposition has a natural home, not in Buddhism, but in Christian and especially Protestant Christian movements which prescribe a radical conversion."{{sfn|Carrithers|1983|p=18}}{{Citation not found}} See Sekida for an example of this influence of William James and Christian conversion stories, mentioning Luther{{sfn|Sekida|1985|p=196-197}}{{Citation not found}} and St. Paul.{{sfn|Sekida|1985|p=251}} See also McMahan for the influence of Christian thought on Buddhism.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}}{{Citation not found}}}}

The notion of "experience" has been criticised.{{sfn|Sharf|1995-B}}{{Citation not found}}{{sfn|Mohr|2000|p=282-286}}{{Citation not found}}{{sfn|Low|2006|p=12}}{{Citation not found}} Robert Sharf points out that "experience" is a typical Western term, which has found its way into Asian religiosity via western influences.{{sfn|Sharf|1995-B}}{{Citation not found}}{{refn|group=note|Robert Sharf: "[T]he role of experience in the history of Buddhism has been greatly exaggerated in contemporary scholarship.

==Abrahamic religions==

===Hebrew Bible===
{{Main|Prayer in the Hebrew Bible}}
In the Hebrew Bible prayer is an evolving means of interacting with [[God]], most frequently through a spontaneous, individual, unorganized form of petitioning and/or thanking. Standardized prayer such as is done today is non-existent, although beginning in [[Deuteronomy]], the Bible lays the groundwork for organized prayer, including basic liturgical guidelines, and by the Bible's later books, prayer has evolved to a more standardized form, although still radically different from the [[Tefillah|form practiced]] by modern [[Jews]].

Individual prayer is described by the Tanakh two ways. The first of these is when prayer is described as occurring, and a result is achieved, but no further information regarding a person's prayer is given. In these instances, such as with [[Isaac]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen.%2025:21&amp;version=NIV |title=Gen. 25: 21 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=August 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moses]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers%2011:2&amp;version=NIV |title=Num. 11:2 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=August 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Samuel+8:6&amp;version=NIV |title=1 Samuel 8:6 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=August 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Job (Biblical figure)|Job]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job+42:10&amp;version=NIV |title=Job. 42:10 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=August 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the act of praying is a method of changing a situation for the better. The second way in which prayer is depicted is through fully fleshed out episodes of prayer, where a person's prayer is related in full. Many famous biblical personalities have such a prayer, including every major character from [[Hannah (Bible)|Hannah]] to [[Hezekiah]].&lt;ref&gt;Jewish Encyclopedia, "Prayer," http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=496&amp;letter=P&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Testament===
{{Main|Prayer in the New Testament}}
In the New Testament prayer is presented as a positive command ({{bibleverse||Colossians|4:2}}; {{bibleverse|1|Thessalonians|5:17}}). The [[People of God]] are challenged to include [[Christian prayer]] in their everyday life, even in the busy struggles of marriage ({{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|7:5}}) as it brings people closer to [[God in Christianity|God]].

[[Jesus]] encouraged his [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] to pray in secret in their private rooms, using the [[Lord's Prayer]], as a humble response to the prayer of the [[Pharisees]], whose practices in prayer were regarded as impious by the New Testament writers ({{bibleverse||Matthew|6:6}}).

Throughout the [[New Testament]], prayer is shown to be God's appointed method by which we obtain what He has to bestow ({{bibleverse||Matthew|7:7-11}}; {{bibleverse||Matthew|9:24-29}}; {{bibleverse||Luke|11:13}}. Further, the [[Book of James]] says that the lack of [[blessing]]s in life results from a failure to pray ({{bibleverse||James|4:2}}). Jesus healed through prayer and expected his followers to do so also ({{bibleverse||Mark|16:17-18}}; {{bibleverse||Matthew|10:8}}).

===Judaism===
{{Main|Jewish prayer}}
[[File:Jewish Canadian soldiers during WWII.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Captain Samuel Cass, a [[rabbi]], conducting the first prayer service celebrated on German territory by Jewish personnel of the [[First Canadian Army]] near [[Kleve|Cleve]], Germany, 18 March 1945]]
Observant Jews pray three times a day, [[Shacharit]], [[Mincha]], and [[Ma'ariv]] with lengthier prayers on special days, such as the [[Shabbat]] and [[Jewish holidays]] including [[Musaf]] and the reading of the [[Torah]]. The [[siddur]] is the prayerbook used by Jews all over the world, containing a set order of daily prayers. Jewish prayer is usually described as having two aspects: ''[[kavanah]]'' (intention) and ''keva'' (the ritualistic, structured elements).

The most important Jewish prayers are the [[Shema Yisrael]] ("Hear O Israel") and the [[Amidah]] ("the standing prayer").

Communal prayer is preferred over solitary prayer, and a quorum of 10 adult males (a ''[[minyan]]'') is considered by [[Orthodox Judaism]] a prerequisite for several communal prayers.
[[File:Muro de las Lamentaciones, Jerusalén, Israel, 2017.gif|thumb|[[Orthodox Jewish]] men praying in [[Jerusalem]]'s [[Western Wall]]]]

There are also many other ritualistic prayers a Jew performs during their day, such as washing before eating bread, washing after one wakes up in the morning, and doing grace after meals.

====Rationalist approach====
In this view, the ultimate goal of prayer is to help train a person to focus on divinity through philosophy and intellectual contemplation. This approach was taken by [[Maimonides]] and the other medieval rationalists. One example of this approach to prayer is noted by Rabbi Steven Weil, who was appointed the Orthodox Union's Executive-Vice President in 2009. He notes that the word "prayer" is a derivative of the Latin "precari", which means "to beg". The Hebrew equivalent "tefilah", however, along with its root "pelel" or its reflexive "l’hitpallel", means the act of self-analysis or self-evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.ou.org/torah/article/why_tefilah_doesn |title= Why Tefilah Doesn't Mean Prayer: Redefining our Relationship with G-d |first= Steven |last= Weil |authorlink= Steven Weil |date= September 14, 2010 |type= video presentation |work= ou.org |publisher= [[Orthodox Union]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is sometimes described as the person praying having a dialogue or conversation with God.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/862508/jewish/Talking-With-Gd.htm |first= Naftali |last= Silberberg |date= n.d. |title= Jewish Practice " Mitzvahs &amp; Traditions " Prayer " Insights – Talking With G‑d |work= [[Chabad.org]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Educational approach====
In this view, prayer is not a conversation. Rather, it is meant to inculcate certain attitudes in the one who prays, but not to influence. This has been the approach of Rabbenu Bachya, [[Yehuda Halevy]], [[Joseph Albo]], [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]], and [[Joseph Dov Soloveitchik]]. This view is expressed by Rabbi [[Nosson Scherman]] in the overview to the [[Artscroll]] Siddur (p.&amp;nbsp;XIII); note that Scherman goes on to also affirm the Kabbalistic view (see below).

====Kabbalistic approach====
[[Kabbalah]] uses a series of ''[[Kavanah|kavanot]]'', directions of intent, to specify the path the prayer ascends in the dialog with God, to increase its chances of being answered favorably. Kabbalists ascribe a higher meaning to the purpose of prayer, which is no less than affecting the very fabric of reality itself, restructuring and repairing the universe in a real fashion. In this view, every word of every prayer, and indeed, even every letter of every word, has a precise meaning and a precise effect. Prayers thus literally affect the mystical forces of the universe, and repair the fabric of creation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/114937/jewish/The-Kabbalah.htm The Kabbalah of Prayer] on Chabad.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Jews, this approach has been taken by the [[Chassidei Ashkenaz]] (German pietists of the Middle-Ages), the [[Isaac Luria|Arizal's]] Kabbalist tradition, [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto|Ramchal]], most of [[Hasidic Judaism|Hassidism]], the [[Vilna Gaon]], and [[Jacob Emden]].

Christian prayers are quite varied. They can be completely spontaneous, or read entirely from a text, like the Anglican [[Book of Common Prayer]]. The most common prayer among Christians is the [[Lord's Prayer]], which according to the [[gospel]] accounts (e.g. [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#6:9|Matthew 6:9–13]]) is how [[Jesus]] taught his [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] to pray.&lt;ref name=Geldart108 &gt;''Examining Religions: Christianity Foundation Edition'' by Anne Geldart 1999 {{ISBN|0-435-30324-4}} page 108&lt;/ref&gt; The Lord's Prayer is a model for prayers of adoration, confession and petition in Christianity.&lt;ref name=Geldart108 /&gt; In medieval England, prayers (particularly the ''[[Lord's Prayer|paternoster]]'') were frequently used as a measure of time in medical and culinary recipe books.&lt;ref&gt;Irma Taavitsainen, 'Middle English Recipes: Genre Characteristics, Text Type Features and Underlying Traditions of Writing', ''Journal of Historical Pragmatics'', 2 (2001), 85–113 (p. 103), DOI: 10.1075/jhp.2.1.05taa.&lt;/ref&gt;

Christians generally pray to God or to the Father. Some Christians (e.g., [[Catholics]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]]) will also ask the righteous in heaven and "in Christ," such as [[Virgin Mary]] or other saints to intercede by praying on their behalf ([[intercession of saints]]). Formulaic closures include "through our Lord Jesus Christ, Your Son, who lives and reigns with You, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, through all the ages of ages," and "in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit."

It is customary among Protestants to end prayers with "In [[Jesus]]' name, Amen" or "In the name of [[Christ]], Amen."&lt;ref&gt;See John 16:23, 26; John 14:13; John 15:16&lt;/ref&gt; However, the most commonly used closure in Christianity is simply "[[Amen]]" (from a Hebrew adverb used as a statement of affirmation or agreement, usually translated as ''so be it'').

In the Western or [[Latin Rite]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], probably the most common is the [[Rosary]]; In the Eastern Church (the [[Eastern Rite Catholic Churches|Eastern rites]] of the Catholic Church and Orthodox Church), the [[Jesus Prayer]]. The Jesus Prayer is also often repeated as part of the [[Christian meditation|meditative]] [[hesychasm]] practice in [[Eastern Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;Parry, Ken; David Melling (editors) (1999). ''The Blackwell Dictionary of Eastern Christianity'' {{ISBN|0-631-23203-6}} page 230&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman Catholic tradition includes specific prayers and devotions as [[acts of reparation]] which do not involve a petition for a living or deceased beneficiary, but aim to repair the sins of others, e.g. for the [[Acts of Reparation to Jesus Christ|repair of the sin of blasphemy]] performed by others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Catholic |last= Slater |first= Thomas |volume= 12 |title= Reparation |url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12775a.htm |no-icon= 1 |prescript= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other forms of prayer among Catholics would be meditative prayer, contemplative prayer and infused prayer discussed at length by Catholic Saints St. John of the Cross and St. Theresa of Jesus.

====Pentecostalism====
In [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] congregations, prayer is often accompanied by speaking in an unknown tongue, a practice now known as [[glossolalia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]], 2nd ed, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Practitioners of Pentecostal glossolalia may claim that the languages they speak in prayer are real foreign languages, and that the ability to speak those languages spontaneously is a gift of the [[Holy Spirit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Library - Religion – Christianity - Pentecostalism |publisher= Australian Broadcasting Company |url= http://www.abc.net.au/religion/stories/s820631.htm |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141104194445/http://www.abc.net.au/religion/stories/s820631.htm |archive-date= 2014-11-04 |deadurl= no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Acts|2:1-13|31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Acts|10:45-47|31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people outside of the movement, however, have offered dissenting views. [[George Barton Cutten]] suggested that glossolalia was a sign of mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;George Barton Cutten, ''Speaking with Tongues Historically and Psychologically Considered'', Yale University Press, 1927.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Felicitas Goodman]] suggested that tongue speakers were under a form of hypnosis.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Felicitas D., ''Speaking in Tongues: A Cross-Cultural Study in Glossolalia''. University of Chicago Press, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; Others suggest that it is a learned behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Hine, Virginia H.: 'Pentecostal Glossolalia toward a Functional Interpretation.'

Macmillan, New York, 1972, quote on p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these views have allegedly been refuted.&lt;ref&gt;Hine, Virginia H.: 'Pentecostal Glossolalia toward a Functional Interpretation.'

''Journal of Abnormal Psychology'': 1979 Aug Vol 88(4) 427–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Christian Science====
[[Christian Science]] teaches that prayer is a spiritualization of thought or an understanding of God and of the nature of the underlying spiritual creation. Adherents believe that this can result in healing, by bringing spiritual reality into clearer focus in the human scene. The world as it appears to the senses is regarded as a distorted version of the world of spiritual ideas. Prayer can heal the distortion. Christian Scientists believe that prayer does not change the spiritual creation but gives a clearer view of it, and the result appears in the human scene as healing: the human picture adjusts to coincide more nearly with the divine reality.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary Baker Eddy]], "Prayer," in Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures, Boston, Trustees Under the Will of Mary Baker Eddy, 1934 [etc.]pp. 1-17&lt;/ref&gt; Christian Scientists do not practice [[intercessory prayer]] as it is commonly understood, and they generally avoid combining prayer with medical treatment in the belief that the two practices tend to work against each other. Prayer works through [[love]]: the recognition of God's creation as spiritual, intact, and inherently lovable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authorlink=Christian Science Q&amp;A|title=Is there no intercessory prayer?|url=http://www.christianscience.org/QAIsthereintercesprayer.html|accessdate=2007-10-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/19990830121655/http://www.christianscience.org/QAIsthereintercesprayer.html|archivedate=1999-08-30|df=}}

===Islam===
{{Main|Salat|Dua}}
[[File:Mosque.jpg|thumb|Muslims in prostration in [[Syria]] (2003 photograph).]]
The [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word for prayer is ''[[salah]]''. In Islam, there are five daily obligatory prayers that are considered as one of the pillars of the religion. The command to ritual prayer occurs repeatedly in the [[Quran]]. The prayer is performed by the person while they are facing the [[Kaaba]] in [[Mecca]]. There is the "call for prayer" (''[[adhan]]''), where the ''[[muezzin]]'' calls for all the followers to stand together for the prayer. The prayer consists of actions such as glorifying and praising God (such as mentioning ‘Allāhu Akbar’ (God is Great)) while standing, recitation of chapters of the Quran (such as the opening chapter of the book (''[[Al-Fatiha]]'')), [[Ruku|bowing down]] then praising God, [[prostration|prostrating]] (''[[sujud]]'') then again praising God and it ends with the words: "Peace be with you and God’s mercy". During the prayer, a Muslim cannot talk or do anything else besides pray. Once the prayer is complete, one can offer personal prayers or supplications to God for their needs that are known as ''[[dua]]''. There are many standard invocations in [[Arabic]] to be recited at various times (''e.g.'' after the prayer) and for various occasions (''e.g.'' for one's parents) with manners and etiquette such as before eating. Muslims may also say ''dua'' in their own words and languages for any issue they wish to communicate with God in the hope that God will answer their prayers.&lt;ref name="Emerick" /&gt; Certain [[Shi'a]] sects pray the five daily prayers divided into three separate parts of the day, providing several Hadith as supporting evidence;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UlaBw3MUGBEC&amp;pg=PA91&amp;dq=shia+pray+3+times&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=urkrTeT9MM6IhQeAwrydCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Muslim cultures today: a reference guide] By Kathryn M.

===Bahá'í===
{{Main|Prayer in the Bahá'í Faith}}
[[Bahá'u'lláh]], the [[Báb]], and [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] wrote many prayers for general use, and some for specific occasions, including for unity, detachment, spiritual upliftment, and healing among others. [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]]s are also required to recite each day one of three [[Obligatory Bahá'í prayers|obligatory prayers]] composed by Bahá'u'lláh. The believers have been enjoined to face in the direction of the [[Qiblih]] when reciting their Obligatory Prayer. The longest obligatory prayer may be recited at any time during the day; another, of medium length, is recited once in the morning, once at midday, and once in the evening; and the shortest can be recited anytime between noon and sunset. Bahá'ís also read from and meditate on the scriptures every morning and evening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=P.|year=1999|title =A Concise Encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith|publisher=Oneworld Publications|location=Oxford, UK|pages=274–75|isbn=1-85168-184-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eastern religions==
{{see|Eastern religions|Meditation|Mantra}}
In both [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]], the repetition of [[mantra]]s is closely related to the practice of repetitive prayer in Western religion ([[rosary]], [[Jesus prayer]]). Many of the most widespread Hindu and Buddhist mantras are in origin invocations of deities, e.g. [[Gayatri Mantra]] dedicated to [[Savitr]], [[Pavamana Mantra]] to [[Soma (drink)|Soma Pavamana]], and many of the Buddhist [[Dhāraṇī]] originate as recitations of lists of names or attributes of deities. Most of the shorter Buddhist mantras originate as the invocation of the name of a specific deity or ''[[bodhisattva]]'', such as ''[[Om mani padme hum]]'' being in origin the invocation of a ''bodhisattva'' called ''Maṇipadma''. However, from an early time these mantras were interpreted in the context of mystical [[sound symbolism]]. The most extreme example of this is the [[om]] syllable, which as early as in the [[Aitareya Brahmana]] was claimed as equivalent to the entire [[Vedas]] (collection of ritual hymns).&lt;ref&gt;Aitareya Brahmana 5.32, Arthur Berriedale Keith, ''The Aitareya and Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇas of the Rigveda''. Harvard University Press, 1920, p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
[[Image:Incense-LE.jpg|thumb|Buddhists praying with incense at [[Wat Phra Kaew]], Thailand]]
In the earliest Buddhist tradition, the [[Theravada]], and in the later [[Mahayana]] tradition of [[Zen]] (or [[Chán]]), prayer plays only an ancillary role. It is largely a ritual expression of wishes for success in the practice and in helping all beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Collins|first=Steven|title=Selfless Persons|publisher=Cambridge University Press| year=1982|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom|pages=6|isbn=0-521-39726-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote needed|date=June 2018}}

The [[Upāya|skillful means]] (Sanskrit: ''upāya'') of the transfer of merit (Sanskrit: ''[[pariṇāmanā]]'') is an [[evocation]] and prayer. Moreover, indeterminate buddhas are available for intercession as they reside in awoken-fields (Sanskrit: ''buddha-kshetra'').

The ''[[Trikaya|nirmānakāya]]'' of an awoken-field is what is generally known and understood as a [[mandala]]. The opening and closing of the ring (Sanskrit: ''maṇḍala'') is an active prayer. An active prayer is a mindful activity, an activity in which [[Mindfulness (Buddhism)|mindfulness]] is not just cultivated but ''is''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sangharakshita|first=Bhikshu|title=A Survey of Buddhism|publisher=Windhorse Publications|year=1993|location=Guildford, Surrey, United Kingdom|pages=449–60|isbn=0-904766-65-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common prayer is "May the merit of my practice, adorn Buddhas' Pure Lands, requite the fourfold kindness from above, and relieve the suffering of the three life-journeys below. Universally wishing sentient beings, Friends, foes, and karmic creditors, all to activate the bodhi mind, and all to be reborn in the Pure Land of Ultimate Bliss."

The [[Generation Stage]] (Sanskrit: ''utpatti-krama'') of [[Vajrayana]] involves prayer elements.&lt;ref&gt;Keown, Damien (ed.) with Hodge, Stephen; Jones, Charles; Tinti, Paola (2003). ''A Dictionary of Buddhism''. Great Britain, Oxford: Oxford University Press. P.100. {{ISBN|0-19-860560-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tibetan Buddhism]] tradition emphasizes an instructive and devotional relationship to a guru; this may involve devotional practices known as [[guru yoga]] which are congruent with prayer. It also appears that Tibetan Buddhism posits the existence of various deities, but the peak view of the tradition is that the deities or ''[[yidam]]'' are no more existent or real than the continuity (Sanskrit: ''santana''; refer [[mindstream]]) of the practitioner, environment and activity. But how practitioners engage ''yidam'' or [[tutelary deities]] will depend upon the level or more appropriately ''[[yana (Buddhism)|yana]]'' at which they are practicing. At one level, one may pray to a deity for protection or assistance, taking a more subordinate role. At another level, one may invoke the deity, on a more equal footing. And at a higher level one may deliberately cultivate the idea that one has become the deity, whilst remaining aware that its ultimate nature is ''[[śūnyatā]]''. The views of the more esoteric ''yana'' are impenetrable for those without direct experience and empowerment.

[[Pure Land Buddhism]] emphasizes the recitation by devotees of prayer-like [[mantra]]s, a practice often called ''[[Nembutsu]]''.&lt;ref name=smithnovak03&gt;"The Flowering of Faith: Buddhism's Pure Land Tradition" (pp. 185–98) in {{cite book

According to [[Shinran]], the founder of the [[Pure Land Buddhism]] tradition that is most prevalent in the US,&lt;ref name=smithnovak03/&gt;{{rp|193}}&lt;ref&gt;Smith and Novak (2003) state that "Pure Land Buddhism has entered America almost exclusively from Japan, and the church Shinran founded is the largest Pure Land presence on this continent" (p. 193).&lt;/ref&gt; "for the long haul nothing is as efficacious as the Nembutsu."&lt;ref name=smithnovak03/&gt;{{rp|197}}&lt;ref&gt;This quotation is Smith and Novak's paraphrase of Shinran's teaching.&lt;/ref&gt; On another, the practice is a form of meditation aimed at achieving realization.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

But beyond all these practices the Buddha emphasized the primacy of individual practice and experience. He said that supplication to gods or deities was not necessary. Nevertheless, today many lay people in East Asian countries pray to the Buddha in ways that resemble Western prayer—asking for intervention and offering devotion.

===Hinduism===
{{Main|Prayer in Hinduism}}
[[File:Bangladesh Prayer.jpg|thumb|[[Shaktism|Shakta]] Hindus in [[Dhaka]], Bangladesh, pray to the goddess during ''[[Durga Puja]]'', October 2003]]
[[Hinduism]] has incorporated many kinds of prayer (Sanskrit: ''prārthanā''), from fire-based [[yajna|rituals]] to philosophical musings. While chanting involves 'by dictum' recitation of timeless verses or verses with timings and notations, ''dhyanam'' involves deep meditation (however short or long) on the preferred deity/God. Again the object to which prayers are offered could be a persons referred as ''devtas'', trinity or incarnation of either ''devtas'' or trinity or simply plain formless meditation as practiced by the ancient sages. These prayers can be directed to fulfilling personal needs or deep spiritual enlightenment, and also for the benefit of others. Ritual [[invocation]] was part and parcel of the [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic religion]] and as such permeated their sacred texts. Indeed, the highest sacred texts of the Hindus, the [[Vedas]], are a large collection of [[mantra]]s and prayer rituals. Classical Hinduism came to focus on extolling a single supreme force, [[Brahman]], that is made manifest in several lower forms as the familiar gods of the [[Hindu pantheon]]{{Dubious|date=February 2009}}. Hindus in [[India]] have numerous devotional movements. Hindus may pray to the highest absolute God Brahman, or more commonly to its three manifestations, a creator god called [[Brahma (god)|Brahma]], a preserver god called [[Vishnu]] and a destroyer god (so that the creation cycle can start afresh) [[Shiva]], and at the next level to Vishnu's avatars (earthly appearances) [[Rama]] and [[Krishna]] or to many other male or female deities. Typically, Hindus pray with their hands (the palms) joined together in ''[[pranam]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=a5732hIV03kC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=false#v=onepage&amp;q=false&amp;f=false Stephen Jacobs (2010), ''Hinduism Today : An Introduction'', Continuum International Publishing Group, p. 44]&lt;/ref&gt; The hand gesture is similar to the popular Indian greeting ''[[namaste]]''.

===Sikhism===
[[Image:BhaiSahibJiArdas.jpg|thumb|A [[Sikh]] holy man, doing Sikh prayer ([[Ardās]])]]
The ''[[Ardās]]'' (Punjabi: ਅਰਦਾਸ) is a [[Sikh]] prayer that is done before performing or after undertaking any significant task; after reciting the daily ''[[Banis]]'' (prayers); or completion of a service like the ''[[Paath]]'' (scripture reading/recitation), ''[[kirtan]]'' (hymn-singing) program or any other religious program. In Sikhism, these prayers are also said before and after eating. The prayer is a plea to God to support and help the devotee with whatever he or she is about to undertake or has done.

The ''Ardas'' is usually always done standing up with folded hands. The beginning of the ''Ardas'' is strictly set by the tenth Sikh Guru, [[Guru Gobind Singh]]. When it comes to conclusion of this prayer, the devotee uses words like "[[Waheguru]] please bless me in the task that I am about to undertake" when starting a new task or "[[Akal Purakh]], having completed the hymn-singing, we ask for your continued blessings so that we can continue with your memory and remember you at all times", etc. The word "Ardās" is derived from Persian word 'Arazdashat', meaning a request, supplication, prayer, petition or an address to a superior authority.

Ardās is a unique prayer based on the fact that it is one of the few well-known prayers in the Sikh religion that was not written in its entirety by the Gurus. The Ardās cannot be found within the pages of the [[Guru Granth Sahib]] because it is a continually changing devotional text that has evolved over time in order for it to encompass the feats, accomplishments, and feelings of all generations of Sikhs within its lines. Taking the various derivation of the word Ardās into account, the basic purpose of this prayer is an appeal to Waheguru for his protection and care, as well as being a plea for the welfare and prosperity of all mankind, and a means for the Sikhs to thank Waheguru for all that he has done.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.sgpc.net/ardas/index.asp |title= Ardas |work= sgpc.net |publisher= [[Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee]] |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060806235347/http://www.sgpc.net/ardas/index.asp |archivedate= 2006-08-06 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://new.sgpc.net/ardas/# |title= Learn and recite the Holy Ardas |work= sgpc.net |publisher= [[Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New religious movements==
[[Wicca]]n prayers can include meditation, rituals and incantations. Prayers are seen as a form of communication with the God and Goddess. This may include prayers for ''[[esbat]]'' and ''[[sabbat]]'' celebrations, for dinner, for pre-dawn times or for your own or others safety, for healing or for the dead.&lt;ref&gt;The Wiccan Prayer Book: Daily, Mark Ventimiglia - 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Raëlism]] rites and practises vary from initiation ceremonies, to sensual meditation. An initiation ceremony usually involves a Raelian putting water on the forehead of a new member. Such ceremonies are performed on certain special days on the Raelian calendar.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Susan J., Aliens Adored. Rutgers University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Sensual meditation techniques include breathing exercises and various forms of erotic meditation.&lt;ref&gt;Raël, Sensual Meditation. Tagman Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Eckankar]], one of the basic forms of prayer includes singing the word "HU" which is pronounced as "hue", a holy name of God. This can be done with eyes closed or open, aloud or silently. Practitioners may experience the divine ECK or Holy Spirit.&lt;ref&gt;Eckankar: Ancient Wisdom for Today - Page 20, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

Practitioners of [[Theurgy#Esoteric Christianity|Theurgy]] and [[Western esotericism]] may practice a form of ritual which utilizes both pre-sanctioned prayers and names of God, and prayers "from the heart" that, when combined, allows the participant to ascend spiritually, and in some instances, induce a trance in which God or other spiritual beings may be realized. Very similar to [[Hermetic Qabalah]], and orthodox Kabbalah, it is believed that prayer can influence both the physical and non-physical worlds. The use of ritualistic signs and names are believed to be archetypes in which the subconscious may take form as the [[Inner God]], or another spiritual being, and the "prayer from the heart" to be that spiritual force speaking through the participant.

Photo shows a close-up of the [[Stele of Revealing]].]]
In [[Thelema]] (which includes both theist as well as atheist practitioners) adherents share a number of practices that are forms of individual prayer, including basic yoga; (asana and pranayama); various forms of ritual [[magick (Aleister Crowley)|magick]]; rituals of one's own devising (often based upon a syncretism of religions, or Western Esotericism, such as the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram and Star Ruby); and performance of Liber Resh vel Helios (aka Liber 200), which consists of four daily adorations to the sun (often consisting of 4 hand/body positions and recitation of a memorized song, normally spoken, addressing different godforms identified with the sun).&lt;ref&gt;DuQuette, Lon Milo. The Magick of Aleister Crowley: A Handbook of the Rituals of Thelema, p. 12. Weiser, 2003. {{ISBN|1-57863-299-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

While there is no dogma within Thelema that expresses the purpose behind any individual aspirant who chooses to perform "Resh", it may be noted that the practice of "Resh" is not a simple petition toward the sun, nor a form of "worshiping" the celestial body that we call the Sun, but instead uses the positioning of that source of light, which enables life on our planet, as well as uses mythological images of that solar force, so that the individual can perform the prayer, possibly furthering a self-identification with the sun, so "that repeated application of the Liber Resh adorations expands the consciousness of the individual by compelling him to take a different perspective, by inducing him to 'look at things from the point of view of the Sun'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erwinhessle.com/writings/pvsun.php|title=The Point of View of the Sun|first=Erwin|last=Hessle|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prayer healing==
{{main|Faith healing}}
Prayer is often used as a means of [[faith healing]] in an attempt to use [[religious]] or [[spirituality|spiritual]] means to prevent illness, cure [[disease]], or improve health. 

Scientific studies regarding the use of prayer have mostly concentrated on its effect on the healing of sick or injured people. [[meta-study|Meta-studies]] have been performed showing evidence only for no effect or a potentially small effect. For instance, a 2006 meta analysis on 14 studies concluded that there is "no discernable effect" while a 2007 systemic review of [[studies on intercessory prayer]] reported inconclusive results, noting that 7 of 17 studies had "small, but significant, effect sizes" but the review noted that the most methodologically rigorous studies failed to produce significant findings.&lt;ref&gt;K.

Some attempt to heal by prayer, mental practices, spiritual insights, or other techniques, claiming they can summon divine or supernatural intervention on behalf of the ill. Others advocate that ill people may achieve healing through prayer performed by themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/pell-adamant-prayer-cures-cancer-20091221-l8fy.html|location=Melbourne|work=The Age|title=Pell adamant prayer cures cancer|date=2009-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the varied beliefs of those who practice it, faith healing may be said to afford gradual relief from pain or sickness or to bring about a sudden "miracle cure", and it may be used in place of, or in tandem with, conventional medical techniques for alleviating or curing diseases. Faith healing has been criticized on the grounds that those who use it may delay seeking potentially curative conventional medical care. This is particularly problematic when parents use faith healing techniques on children.

===Efficacy of prayer healing===
{{main|Efficacy of prayer}}
[[File:Laying on of hands.jpg|thumb|To pray over an individual while [[laying on of hands|laying hands on them]] is a form of faith healing in Christianity.]]
In 1872, [[Francis Galton]] conducted a famous [[statistics|statistical]] experiment to determine whether prayer had a physical effect on the external environment. Galton hypothesized that if prayer was effective, members of the British Royal family would live longer, given that thousands prayed for their wellbeing every Sunday. He therefore compared longevity in the British Royal family with that of the general population, and found no difference.&lt;ref name="Galton"/&gt; While the experiment was probably intended to satirize, and suffered from a number of [[Confounding variable|confounders]], it set the precedent for a number of different studies, the results of which are contradictory.

Two studies claimed that patients who are being prayed for recover more quickly or more frequently although critics have claimed that the methodology of such studies are flawed, and the perceived effect disappears when controls are tightened.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2005/07/prayer_still_us.html |author= Anonymous |date= July 20, 2005 |title= Skeptico – Prayer still useless |work= skeptico.blogs.com |type= blog |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141104203127/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2005/07/prayer_still_us.html |archive-date= 2014-11-04 |deadurl= no }}&lt;/ref&gt; One such study, with a [[double-blind]] design and about 500 subjects per group, was published in 1988; it suggested that intercessory prayer by born again Christians had a statistically significant positive effect on a coronary care unit population.&lt;ref name="SouthMedJ"/&gt; Critics contend that there were severe methodological problems with this study.&lt;ref name="Infidels"/&gt; Another such study was reported by Harris et al.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt; Critics also claim that the 1988 study was not fully double-blinded, and that in the Harris study, patients actually had a longer hospital stay in the prayer group, if one discounts the patients in both groups who left before prayers began,&lt;ref&gt;Tessman I and Tessman J "Efficacy of Prayer: A Critical Examination of Claims," Skeptical Inquirer, March/April 2000,&lt;/ref&gt; although the Harris study did demonstrate the prayed for patients on average received lower course scores (indicating better recovery).

One of the largest randomized, blind clinical trials was a remote ''retroactive'' intercessory prayer study conducted in Israel by Leibovici. This study used 3393 patient records from 1990–96, and blindly assigned some of these to an intercessory prayer group. The prayer group had shorter hospital stays and duration of fever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leibovici | first1 = L | year = 2001 | title = Effects of remote, retroactive intercessory prayer on outcomes in patients with bloodstream infection: randomized controlled trial | url = | journal = BMJ | volume = 323 | issue = 7327| pages = 1450–1 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.323.7327.1450 | pmid = 11751349 | pmc=61047}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several studies of prayer effectiveness have yielded null results.&lt;ref name="O'Laoire"/&gt; A 2001 double-blind study of the [[Mayo Clinic]] found no significant difference in the recovery rates between people who were (unbeknownst to them) assigned to a group that prayed for them and those who were not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Aviles | first1 = JM | last2 = Whelan | first2 = SE | last3 = Hernke | first3 = DA | last4 = Williams | first4 = BA | last5 = Kenny | first5 = KE | last6 = O'Fallon | first6 = WM | last7 = Kopecky | first7 = SL | year = 2001 | title = Intercessory prayer and cardiovascular disease progression in a coronary care unit population: a randomized controlled trial | url = | journal = Mayo Clin Proc | volume = 76 | issue = 12| pages = 1192–8 | doi = 10.4065/76.12.1192 | pmid = 11761499 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the MANTRA study conducted by Duke University found no differences in outcome of cardiac procedures as a result of prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Krucoff | first1 = MW | last2 = Crater | first2 = SW | last3 = Gallup | first3 = D | last4 = Blankenship | first4 = JC | last5 = Cuffe | first5 = M | last6 = Guarneri | first6 = M | last7 = Krieger | first7 = RA | last8 = Kshettry | first8 = VR | last9 = Morris | first9 = K | last10 = Oz | first10 = M | last11 = Pichard | first11 = A | last12 = Sketch | first12 = MH Jr | last13 = Koenig | first13 = HG | last14 = Mark | first14 = D | last15 = Lee | first15 = KL | year = 2005 | title = Music, imagery, touch, and prayer as adjuncts to interventional cardiac care: the Monitoring and Actualisation of Noetic Trainings (MANTRA) II randomised study | url = | journal = Lancet | volume = 366 | issue = 9481| pages = 211–7 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(05)66910-3 | pmid = 16023511 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In another similar study published in the ''[[American Heart Journal]]'' in 2006,&lt;ref name="STEP 2006" /&gt; Christian intercessory prayer when reading a scripted prayer was found to have no effect on the recovery of heart surgery patients; however, the study found patients who had knowledge of receiving prayer had slightly higher instances of complications than those who did not know if they were being prayed for or those who did not receive prayer.&lt;ref name="Saletan 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="STEP 2006" /&gt; Another 2006 study suggested that prayer actually had a significant negative effect on the recovery of [[cardiac bypass]] patients, resulting in more frequent deaths and slower recovery time for those patient who received prayers.&lt;ref name="STEP 2006"/&gt;

Many believe that prayer can aid in recovery, not due to divine influence but due to psychological and physical benefits. It has also been suggested that if a person knows that he or she is being prayed for it can be uplifting and increase morale, thus aiding recovery. (See [[Subject-expectancy effect]].) Many studies have suggested that prayer can reduce physical stress, regardless of the god or gods a person prays to, and this may be true for many worldly reasons. According to a study by Centra State Hospital, "the psychological benefits of prayer may help reduce stress and anxiety, promote a more positive outlook, and strengthen the will to live."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centrastate.com/body.cfm?id=520&amp;action=detail&amp;articlepath=/Atoz/dc/cen/canc/gen/mindspirit.html#7 Mind and Spirit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201075605/http://www.centrastate.com/body.cfm?id=520&amp;action=detail&amp;articlepath=%2FAtoz%2Fdc%2Fcen%2Fcanc%2Fgen%2Fmindspirit.html |date=2009-02-01 }}. ''from the Health Library section of'' [http://www.centrastate.com CentraState Healthcare System]. Accessed May 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Other practices such as [[yoga]], [[T'ai chi ch'uan|t'ai chi]], and meditation may also have a positive impact on physical and psychological health.

Others feel that the concept of conducting prayer experiments reflects a misunderstanding of the purpose of prayer. The previously mentioned study published in the ''American Heart Journal'' indicated that some of the intercessors who took part in it complained about the scripted nature of the prayers that were imposed to them,&lt;ref name="STEP 2006"/&gt; saying that this is not the way they usually conduct prayer: {{quote|Prior to the start of this study, intercessors reported that they usually receive information about the patient’s age, gender and progress reports on their medical condition; converse with family members or the patient (not by fax from a third party); use individualized prayers of their own choosing; and pray for a variable time period based on patient or family request.}}

One scientific movement attempts to track the physical effects of prayer through [[neuroscience]]. Leaders in this movement include [[Andrew B. Newberg|Andrew Newberg]], an Associate Professor at the University of Pennsylvania.  In Newberg's brain scans, monks,  priests, nuns, [[Nun#Distinction between a nun and a religious sister|sister]]s and gurus alike have exceptionally focused attention and compassion sites.  This is a result of the frontal lobe of the brain’s engagement (Newberg, 2009). Newburg believes that anybody can connect to the supernatural with practice. Those without religious affiliations benefit from the connection to the metaphysical as well. Newberg also states that further evidence towards humans' need for metaphysical relationships is that as science had increased spirituality has not decreased. Newburg believes that at the end of the 18th century, when the scientific method began to consume{{page needed|date=September 2010}} the human mind, religion could have vanished. However, two hundred years later, the perception of spirituality, in many instances, appears to be gaining in strength (2009). Newberg's research also provides the connection between prayer and meditation and health. By understanding how the brain works during religious experiences and practices Newberg's research shows that the brain changes during these practices allowing an understanding of how religion affects psychological and physical health (2009).  For example, brain activity during meditation indicates that people who frequently practice prayer or meditation experience lower blood-pressure, lower heart rates, decreased anxiety, and decreased depression.&lt;ref&gt;Newberg, Andrew.

Web. 30 June 2010.  https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyID=104310443&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prevalence of prayer for health===
Some modalities of [[alternative medicine]] employ prayer. A survey released in May 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nccam.nih.gov/news/camsurvey.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2004-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041018194658/http://nccam.nih.gov/news/camsurvey.htm |archivedate=2004-10-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]], part of the [[National Institutes of Health]] in the United States, found that in 2002, 43% of Americans pray for their own health, 24% pray for others' health, and 10% participate in a prayer group for their own health.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10385">The word '''psychosophy''' has etymological roots in the Greek words ψυχή (''psychē'') and σοφίᾱ (''sophiā''), which are often interpreted as "soul" and "wisdom", respectively. It was used in a wide variety of contexts from 1743 to the 1920s but fell out of use in the 20th century.

There are several distinct contexts in which the word has been employed, including:
# Early historical uses
# [[Theosophy (disambiguation)|Theosophical]] and [[neo-theosophical]] and [[Anthroposophical]]
# The contemporary school of psychology founded by the American teacher, Scott Hamilton.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychosophy.com See Psychosophy.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early historical usages and references==
* [[Antonio Genovesi]] (1713–1769) was an Italian writer on [[philosophy]] and political economy. His first works were ''Elementa Melaphysicae'' (1743) and ''Lógica'' (1745). The former is divided into four parts: Ontosophy, Cosmosophy, Theosophy, and Psychosophy, and is supplemented by a treatise on ethics and a dissertation on first causes.
* In 1913, the term was employed by the American philosopher and developmental psychologist [[James Mark Baldwin]] in his book ''History of Psychology: A Sketch and Interpretation'' (Volume I, Chapter II). Baldwin referenced the use of the word psychosophy in the 17th to 18th century as a "catch-all" term for early pre-scientific approaches to exploring the psyche (i.e., magic and mythic approaches preceding the rise of Western [[psychology]] as a formal scientific discipline). The term was similarly referenced in multiple subsequent psychological texts (e.g., Jared Sparks Moore's "Foundations of Psychology") in the '10s and early '20s, presumably employing the word in a manner similar to that of Baldwin.
* ''A History of Psychology'', by Otto Klemm, Emil Carl Wilm, Rudolf Pintner, translated by Emil Carl Wilm, Rudolf Pintner, published by C. Scribner's Sons, 1914, original from the University of Michigan, digitized Oct 3, 2006, 380 pages, Psychosophy reference on p.&amp;nbsp;147:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''The word psychology does not occur previous to the sixteenth century. Melanchthon employed the term as a title of academic lectures. R. Gockel used it in 1590 as a collective title for the works of various authors. The term became generally known through [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] (1679–1754), who did so much for the establishment of philosophical terminology. Up to Wolff's time the term "psychosophy", apparently introduced by J. J. Becker, seems to have been in use. The term pneumatology is also found in the writings of Leibniz.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the philosopher [[:es:Julio Ozan Lavoisier|Julio Ozan Lavoisier]], ''Psychosophy'': "it is a knowledge of the first causes, which aims at the plenitude of human beings and their integration in the World through the unification of the mind".&lt;ref&gt;-''The Return to the Sources, Chapter Philosophy, Religion and Psychosophy''- Ed. Rueda, Madrid España, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;  A basic principle of this discipline is that "psychic balance and moral balance are consecutive." Nevertheless, it does not deal with personal or subjective problems, as it may only bloom in mature spirits. Therefore, "psychosophy starts where psychology ends." "Psychosophy starts from an essential perspective (for which the author has developed a theory of perspective within his theory of knowledge), not from what has been revealed but from what is revealing" (Op. Cit.).

Eleven years later, Ozan Lavoisier published ''Psychosophy. Psycho-philosophical research on the nature of human beings'',&lt;ref&gt;Julio Ozan Lavoisier, ''Psychosophy'', Ed. Dunquen, Buenos Aires, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; a thick volume in which he elaborates upon his method of knowledge in detail. He make clear that his discipline is not in search of news, but "perennial truths found in ancient traditions."  It is essentially ''"a philosophy that makes use of transcendental psychology in order to provide grounds for a metaphysics, ethics, esthetics, a theory of knowledge and a philosophy of history, that is to say, a philosophical system."'' This system has been developed in the following treatises:
* ''Return to the Sources'' (Ed. Rueda, Madrid 1993)
* ''Psychosophy. Psycho-philosophical research on Human nature'' (Dunken, Bs.As. 2004)
* ''Origin and Destiny of Man'' (Dunken, Bs. As. 2008)
* ''The Evolution of Spirit'' (Dunken, Bs. As. 2009)
* ''The Evolution of the Spirit. From Greece to  the West, from India to the East.'' (Har-Anand Publishers, Delhi, 2017)
* ''The Spirit in History'' (Dunken, Bs. As.)
* ''The Spirit in the Moral''. The author's next book.
* ''The Spirit in the Arts.'' The author's next book.
Therefore, the concept of Psychosophy, according to Ozán Lavoisier, should be interpreted in the context of this system, independently of other views or schools that have adopted this concept.

==Theosophical and neo-theosophical==
The word psychosophy was utilized in several articles published in the Theosophical journal ''The Theosophist'':
* The Philosophy of Spirit – Hierosophy, Theosophy &amp; Psychosophy (1), William Oxley, an index to ''The Theosophist'', September, 1882, v3, p298
* The Philosophy of Spirit – Hierosophy, Theosophy &amp; Psychosophy (2), [[Tallapragada Subba Row|T Subba Row]], an index to ''The Theosophist'', October, 1882 v4, p18

The term was also used by William Wilberforce Juvenal Colville in an obscure 1914 publication entitled "The New Psychosophy." The following year, in 1915, [[Cora L. V. Scott|Cora L.V. (Scott) Richmond]] employed the word as the title of her 436-page book exploring various metaphysical subjects. These two writings are examples of the approach that could broadly be considered neo-theosophical.

The term was used by the Austrian philosopher and scholar Rudolf Steiner in a three part series of twelve lectures given in Berlin in 1910, two years before he left the Theosophical Society, but was not apparently used again in Steiner's extensive published works. The lectures lay almost dormant for nearly 90 years until their publication. The four lectures on psychosophy discuss Steiner's perspective on the primary aspects of the human soul, the activities and interactions of various soul forces, the dynamics of love and hate, and the process of judging. Steiner distinguished psychosophy from [[anthroposophy]] (wisdom of the human being) and [[pneumatosophy]] (wisdom of the spirit).&lt;ref&gt;R. Steiner, ''A Psychology of Body, Soul, &amp; Spirit: Anthroposophy, Psychosophy &amp; Pneumatosophy'', Steiner Books, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Steiner states; "''Psychosophy'' is to be a deliberation on the human soul, beginning with the soul's experiences here in the physical world. It then rises to higher realms to demonstrate that whatever we encounter in the physical as the manifest soul-life leads to the perspective where the light of Theosophy comes to meet us."&lt;ref&gt;R. Steiner, ''A Psychology of Body, Soul, &amp; Spirit: Anthroposophy, Psychosophy &amp; Pneumatosophy'', Steiner Books, 1999, p77&lt;/ref&gt; He continues; "every aspect of the soul is either a making of judgments or a life in love or hate. Basically, these are the only concepts that pertain to the soul; all others refer to a vehicle for something coming into the soul, either from without through the body, or (due to causes we will learn later) from the spirit within. Thus, on the one hand, we have judgment, and, on the other, love and hate ... My characterization is not about logic, but about the psychosophic nature &amp;ndash; strictly from the perspective of inner activity, or soul processes &amp;ndash; of judging. Everything you can learn about judgment through logic is ruled out. I am not speaking of 'judgment' but of ''judging'', the ''activity'' of judging, using the word as a verb."&lt;ref&gt;R. Steiner, ''A Psychology of Body, Soul, &amp; Spirit: Anthroposophy, Psychosophy &amp; Pneumatosophy'', Steiner Books, 1999 pp 80–81&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scott Hamilton==
The American teacher Scott Hamilton has trademarked the United States for his contemporary school of psychology offering coaching, consulting and education and synthesizes psychology, philosophy, spirituality, growth technology, and creative actualization. The synthesis unites common elements of past schools of psychology with new research methodology and models of human nature, development, relationships, creativity, coaching, consulting and education. Placing these in causal sequence, psychosophy can be viewed as:

# A new interior research method generating
# An experimentally verified model of inner human nature, which leads to
# A new understanding of human development,
# A new understanding of human relationships, and
# A new understanding of human creativity, all of which are integrated into
# New coaching, consulting and educational systems

Hamilton began developing and sharing the central principles and techniques underlying psychosophy in 1987, following a vision experience of the project. In 1994 he combined the first part of psychology with the second part of philosophy to create the term psychosophy. It was only years later that he discovered that the term had been used in a variety of other contexts in the early 20th and prior centuries. In 1999 Hamilton began formally offering Psychosophy Coaching and Consulting Services. He trained the first group of Psychosophy coaches and consultants from 2005–10, all of whom have launched private practices. In 2008 peer-reviewed research into one of psychosophy's foundational practices—Holding Loving Space—was conducted by Nicholas Hedlund and published in [[Ken Wilber]]'s and [[Sean Esbjörn-Hargens]]' ''Journal of Integral Theory and Practice''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.integralresearchcenter.org/source under Vol. 3 No. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 psychosophy's model of human consciousness, the Consciousness Coordinate System, was presented at the Integral Theory Conference at [[John F. Kennedy University]] in Northern California.

A '''sausage''' is a cylindrical meat product usually made from [[ground meat]], often pork, beef, or [[veal]], along with salt, spices and other flavourings, and breadcrumbs, encased by a skin. Typically, a sausage is formed in a [[casing (sausage)|casing]] traditionally made from [[Gut (anatomy)|intestine]], but sometimes from synthetic materials. Sausages that are sold raw are cooked in many ways, including pan-frying, broiling and barbecuing. Some sausages are [[Cooking|cooked]] during processing and the casing may then be removed.

[[Sausage making]] is a traditional [[food preservation]] technique. Sausages may be preserved by [[curing (food preservation)|curing]], [[Drying (food)|drying]] (often in association with fermentation or culturing, which can contribute to preservation), [[Smoking (food)|smoking]], or freezing. Some cured or smoked sausages can be stored without refrigeration. Most fresh sausages must be refrigerated or frozen until they are cooked.

Sausages come in a huge range of national and regional varieties, which differ by their flavouring or spicing ingredients (garlic, peppers, wine, etc.), the meat(s) used in them and their manner of preparation.

==Etymology==
The word "sausage" was first used in English in the mid-15th century, spelled "sawsyge".&lt;ref name="etymonline.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=sausage|title=sausage - Origin and history of sausage by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101090819/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=sausage|archivedate=1 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This word came "...from Old North French saussiche (Modern French saucisse)".&lt;ref name="etymonline.com"/&gt; The French word "saussiche" came "...from Vulgar Latin *salsica "sausage," from salsicus "seasoned with salt," from Latin salsus [meaning] "salted".&lt;ref name="etymonline.com"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Sausage making-H-1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sausage making]] at home]]
[[File:Wurstplatte.jpg|thumb|upright|Plate of German sausage: [[Jagdwurst]], [[liver sausage]], [[blood sausage]], [[Westphalian ham]]]]
[[Sausage making]] is an outcome of efficient butchery. Traditionally, sausage makers would [[Salting (food)|salt]] various [[tissue (biology)|tissues]] and [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] such as scraps, [[organ meat]]s, blood, and fat to help preserve them. They would then stuff them into tubular casings made from the cleaned intestines of the animal, producing the characteristic cylindrical shape. Hence, sausages, [[pudding]]s, and [[salami]] are among the oldest of prepared foods, whether cooked and eaten immediately or dried to varying degrees.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

An [[Akkadian language|Akkadian cuneiform]] tablet records a dish of intestine casings filled with some sort of [[forcemeat]].&lt;ref&gt;Jean Bottéro, "The Cuisine of Ancient Mesopotamia", ''The Biblical Archaeologist'' '''48''':1:36-47 (March 1985) {{jstor|3209946}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chinese sausage]] ''làcháng'', which consists of goat and lamb meat, was first mentioned in 589 BC.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] poet [[Homer]] mentioned a kind of [[blood sausage]] in the ''[[Odyssey]]'', [[Epicharmus]] wrote a comedy titled ''The Sausage'', and [[Aristophanes]]' play ''[[The Knights]]'' is about a sausage vendor who is elected leader. Evidence suggests that sausages were already popular both among the [[ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], and most likely with the various tribes occupying the larger part of Europe.&lt;ref name="T-P"&gt;{{pl icon}} Eleonora Trojan, Julian Piotrowski, [http://www.poczytaj.pl/77818 ''Tradycyjne wędzenie''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929030838/http://www.poczytaj.pl/77818 |date=29 September 2011 }} AA Publishing. 96 pages. {{ISBN|978-83-61060-30-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous sausage in ancient Italy was from [[Lucania]] (modern [[Basilicata]]) and was called ''[[lucanica]]'', a name which lives on in a variety of modern sausages in the Mediterranean.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} During the reign of the Roman emperor [[Nero]], sausages were associated with the [[Lupercalia]] festival.&lt;ref name="All about sausages"/&gt; Early in the 10th century during the [[Byzantine Empire]], [[Leo VI the Wise]] outlawed the production of [[blood sausage]]s following cases of [[food poisoning]].&lt;ref name="All about sausages"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.victoriahansenfood.com/all-about-sausages/ |title=All About Sausages |date=24 August 2014 |publisher= |website=www.victoriahansenfood.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Casings==
{{main article|Casing (sausage)}}
Traditionally, sausage casings were made of the cleaned intestines,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bba8f3a89TQC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=Traditionally,+sausage+casings+were+made+of+the+clean+intestines&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjdkuyft-PUAhUM6WMKHY-ZDbQQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Traditionally,%20sausage%20casings%20were%20made%20of%20the%20clean%20intestines&amp;f=false|title=The Complete Guide to Preserving Meat, Fish, and Game: Step-by-step Instructions to Freezing, Canning, and Smoking|last=Oster|first=Kenneth V.|date=2011|publisher=Atlantic Publishing Company|isbn=9781601383433|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171119194228/https://books.google.com/books?id=bba8f3a89TQC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=Traditionally,+sausage+casings+were+made+of+the+clean+intestines&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjdkuyft-PUAhUM6WMKHY-ZDbQQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Traditionally,%20sausage%20casings%20were%20made%20of%20the%20clean%20intestines&amp;f=false|archivedate=19 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; or stomachs in the case of [[haggis]] and other traditional puddings. Today, however, natural casings are often replaced by [[collagen]], [[cellulose]], or even plastic casings, especially in the case of industrially manufactured sausages. Some forms of sausage, such as [[sliced sausage]], are prepared without a casing. Additionally, [[luncheon meat]] and sausage meat are now available without casings in [[tin can]]s and [[Mason jar|jars]].

==Ingredients==
A sausage consists of meat cut into pieces or ground, mixed with other ingredients, and filled into a casing. Ingredients may include a cheap [[starch]] filler such as breadcrumbs, seasoning and flavourings such as spices, and sometimes others such as apple and leek.&lt;ref name="beebswozzle"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/pork_sausages BBC: Pork sausage recipes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226151803/http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/pork_sausages|date=26 December 2013}}. "The meat may be mixed with breadcrumbs, cereals or other ingredients such as leek or apple."&lt;/ref&gt; The meat may be from any animal, but is often pork, beef, or [[veal]]. The lean meat-to-fat [[ratio]] depends upon the style and producer. The meat content as labelled may exceed 100%; which happens when the weight of meat exceeds the total weight of the sausage after it has been made, sometimes including a drying process which reduces water content.

In some jurisdictions foods described as sausages must meet regulations governing their content. For example, in the United States The [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]] specifies that the fat content of different defined types of sausage may not exceed 30%, 35% or 50% by weight; some sausages may contain binders or extenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/9CF319.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219033648/http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/9CF319.html|archivedate=19 December 2007|title=USDA Standards of Identity; see Subparts E, F and G}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2012-title9-vol2/pdf/CFR-2012-title9-vol2-part319.pdf|title=PART 319—DEFINITIONS AND STANDARDS OF IDENTITY OR COMPOSITION, parts E, F, and G|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112205028/http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2012-title9-vol2/pdf/CFR-2012-title9-vol2-part319.pdf|archivedate=12 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many traditional styles of sausage from Asia and mainland Europe use no bread-based filler and include only meat (lean meat and fat) and flavorings.&lt;ref&gt;''Joy of Cooking'', Rombauer and Becker; ''The Fine Art of Italian Cooking'', Bugialli&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom and other countries with [[English cuisine]] traditions, many sausages contain a significant proportion of bread and starch-based fillers, which may comprise 30% of ingredients. The filler in many sausages helps them to keep their shape as they are cooked. As the meat contracts in the heat, the filler expands and absorbs moisture and fat from the meat.&lt;ref name=beebbanger&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2284846.stm|title=What's in the great British banger?|date=27 September 2002|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227173620/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2284846.stm|archivedate=27 December 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the food processing industry produces sausages for a low [[price point]], almost any part of the animal can end up in sausages, varying from cheap, fatty specimens stuffed with meat blasted off the carcasses ([[mechanically recovered meat]], MRM) and [[rusk]]. On the other hand, the finest quality contain only choice cuts of meat and seasoning.&lt;ref name=beebswozzle/&gt; In Britain, "meat" declared on labels could in the past include fat, connective tissue, and MRM. These ingredients may still be used, but must be labelled as such, and up to 10% water may be included without being labelled.&lt;ref name=beebbanger/&gt;

Sausages are [[emulsion]]-type products. They are composed of solid fat globules, dispersed in protein solution. The proteins function by coating the fat and stabilizing them in water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/x6556e/x6556e07.htm|title=Small-scale sausage production|website=www.fao.org|access-date=15 December 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161222010736/http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/x6556e/x6556e07.htm|archivedate=22 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classifications==

Sausages classification is subject to regional differences of opinion. Various metrics such as types of ingredients, consistency, and preparation are used. In the [[English-speaking world]], the following distinction between ''fresh'', ''cooked'', and ''dry'' sausages seems to be more or less accepted:
* '''Cooked sausages''' are made with fresh meats, and then fully cooked. They are either eaten immediately after cooking or must be refrigerated. Examples include [[hot dog]]s, [[Braunschweiger (sausage)|Braunschweiger]], and [[liver sausage]].
* '''Cooked smoked sausages''' are cooked and then smoked or [[smoking (cooking)|smoke-cooked]]. They are eaten hot or cold, but need to be refrigerated. Examples include [[kielbasa]] and [[mortadella]]. Some are slow cooked while smoking, in which case the process takes several days or longer, such as the case for ''[[Kolbász|Gyulai kolbász]]''.
* '''Fresh sausages''' are made from meats that have not been previously cured. They must be refrigerated and thoroughly cooked before eating. Examples include ''[[Boerewors]]'', [[Italian sausage|Italian pork sausage]], [[siskonmakkara]], and [[breakfast sausage]].
* '''Fresh smoked sausages''' are fresh sausages that are smoked and cured. They do not normally require refrigeration and do not require any further cooking before eating. Examples include [[Mettwurst]] and [[Teewurst]] which are meat preparations packed in sausage casing but squeezed out of it (just like any other spread from a tube).
* '''Dry sausages''' are cured sausages that are [[fermentation (food)|fermented]] and dried. Some are smoked as well at the beginning of the drying process. They are generally eaten cold and will keep for a long time. Examples include [[salami]], [[Droë wors]], Finnish ''meetvursti'', [[Sucuk]], [[Landjäger]] (smoked), [[Slim Jim (snack food)|Slim Jims]], and [[summer sausage]].
* '''Bulk sausage''', or sometimes ''sausage meat'', refers to raw, ground, spiced meat, usually sold without any casing.
* '''Vegetarian sausage''' are made without meat, for example, based on [[soybean|soya]] protein or [[tofu]], with herbs and spices. Some vegetarian sausages are not necessarily [[vegan]], and may contain ingredients such as [[egg (food)|eggs]].

The distinct flavor of some sausages is due to fermentation by ''[[Lactobacillus]]'', ''[[Pediococcus]]'', or ''[[Micrococcus]]'' (added as [[starter culture]]s) or natural [[Flora (microbiology)|flora]] during curing.

Other countries use different systems of classification. Germany, for instance, which produces more than 1200 types of sausage, distinguishes ''raw'', ''cooked'' and ''precooked'' sausages.
* '''Raw sausages''' are made with raw meat and are not cooked. They are preserved by [[lactic acid fermentation]], and they may be [[drying (food)|dried]], [[brining|brined]] or [[smoking (cooking)|smoked]]. Most raw sausages will keep for a long time. Examples include Mettwurst and salami.
* '''Cooked sausages'''  (''[[Brühwurst]]'') may include water and [[emulsifier]]s and are always cooked. They will not keep long. Examples include [[cervelat]], [[Jagdwurst]], and [[Weißwurst]].
* '''Precooked sausages''' (''[[Kochwurst]]'') are made with precooked meat but may also include raw [[Offal|organ meat]]. They may be heated after casing, and they will keep only for a few days. Examples include [[Saumagen]] and [[Blutwurst]].

In Italy, the basic distinctions are:
* '''Raw sausage''' (''salsiccia'') with a thin casing
* '''Cured and aged sausage''' (''salsiccia stagionata'' or ''salsiccia secca'')
* '''Cooked sausage''' (''wuerstel'')
* '''Blood sausage''' (''sanguinaccio'' or ''[[boudin]]'')
* '''Liver sausage''' (''salsiccia di fegato'')
* '''Salami''' (in Italy, ''salami'' is the plural of ''[[salame]]'', a big, cured, fermented and air-dried sausage)
* ''Cheese sausage'' (''casalsiccia'') with cheese inside

The United States has a particular [[shelf stable]] type called '''pickled sausages''', commonly sold in establishments such as [[gas station]]s and [[delicatessen]]s. These are usually smoked or boiled sausages of a highly processed hot dog or [[kielbasa]] style plunged into a boiling [[brine]] of vinegar, salt, spices, and often a pink coloring, then [[canning|canned]] in [[Mason jar]]s. They are usually packaged in single [[blister pack]]s or jars.

Certain countries classify sausage types according to the region in which the sausage was traditionally produced:
* France: [[Montbéliard]], [[Morteau]], [[Strasbourg]], [[Toulouse]],..
* Germany: [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Thuringian sausage]], [[Nuremberg]], [[Pomerania]],&amp;nbsp;..

==National varieties==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2016}}
[[File:Russian Sausage Making.jpg|thumb|[[Sausage making]] in Russia]]
Many nations and regions have their own characteristic sausages, using meats and other ingredients native to the region and employed in traditional dishes.

===Africa===

====North Africa====
[[Merguez]] is a red, spicy sausage from Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Libya, North Africa. It is also popular in France, Israel, and the German state of Saarland, where it is often grilled on a [[Schwenker]]. Merguez is made with lamb, beef, or a mixture of both. It can be flavored with a wide range of spices, such as sumac for tartness, and paprika, Cayenne pepper, or [[harissa]], a hot chili paste that gives it a red color. It is stuffed into a lamb casing, rather than a pork casing. It is traditionally made fresh and eaten grilled or with couscous. Sun-dried merguez is used to add flavor to tagines. It is also eaten in sandwiches.

====South Africa====
In South Africa, traditional sausages are known as ''[[boerewors]]'', or farmer's sausage. Ingredients include game and beef, usually mixed with pork or lamb and with a high percentage of fat. Coriander and vinegar are the two most common seasoning ingredients, although many variations exist. The coarsely-ground nature of the meat as well as the long continuous spiral of sausage are two of its recognisable qualities. Boerewors is traditionally cooked on a ''braai'' ([[barbecue]]).

[[Droë wors]] is an uncooked sausage similar to boerewors made in a dry-curing process similar to [[biltong]]. A local variant of the [[hot dog]] is the "Wors roll", or boerewors roll. This is a hotdog bun with a piece of boerewors in, served with a tomato and onion relish called ''seshebo''. Seshebo can include chilli, atchaar or curries, depending on the area within the country.

===Asia===

====China====
{{Main article|Chinese sausage}}
[[File:Smoked Chinese sausage.jpg|thumb|Smoked Sausages from Harbin|Smoked sausages from [[Harbin]], China]]
A European-style smoked savory ''hóng cháng'' ({{zh|t=紅腸|s=红肠}} ''red sausage'') is produced in Harbin, China's northernmost major city.&lt;ref name="cnntravel"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is similar to Lithuanian and Polish sausages including [[kiełbasa]] and ''podhalańska'', and tends to have a more European flavour than other Chinese sausages. This kind of sausage was first produced in a Russian-capitalized factory named Churin sausage factory in 1909. Harbin-style sausage has become popular in China, especially in northern regions.&lt;ref name="cnntravel"/&gt;

[[Lap cheong]] (also lap chong, lap chung, lop chong) are dried pork sausages that look and feel like pepperoni, but are much sweeter. In southwestern China, sausages are flavored with salt, red pepper and wild pepper. People often cure sausages by smoking and air drying.

====Japan====
[[File:Arabiki sausages scrambled eggs Chiang Mai.jpg|thumb|Japanese ''arabiki'' pork sausages served with scrambled eggs in a restaurant in [[Chiang Mai]], Thailand]]
Although Japan is not traditionally known for beef, pork, venison, or even blood sausages, the Japanese do consume a fish-based log called [[kamaboko]], which could be considered a type of sausage. Kamaboko is made with cured ground fish paste called [[surimi]]. It is usually shaped into half-moons on top of a small plank of wood and the outside dyed pink. When the kamaboko is cut into slices it appears to have an unmistakable pink rind which surrounds a white interior. It is often cut into thin slices and added to soups, salads, [[bento]], and many other dishes as a garnish.
In recent years, kamaboko has also entered the market as a snack food. Similar to the [[Slim Jim (snack food)|Slim Jim]], cheese, sausage, and fish flavored kamaboko sticks can be found in convenience stores across Japan.

====Korea====
[[Sundae (Korean food)|Sundae]], a form of blood sausage, is a traditional Korean sausage. A popular street food, sundae is normally prepared by steaming or boiling cow or pig intestines stuffed with various ingredients. The most common variation is composed of pork blood, [[cellophane noodle]], sliced carrot and [[barley]] stuffed into pig intestines, but other regional variations include [[Squid (food)|squid]] or [[Alaska pollock]] casings. Sundae is eaten plain with salt, in stews, or as part of a stir-fry.

====Philippines====
In the Philippines, there are different kinds of sausages called ''longaniza'' ([[Languages of the Philippines|Filipino languages]]: ''longganisa'') with mixes dependent on their size of origin: ''Longaniza de Vigan'' (''longganisang Vigan''), ''Longaniza de Lucban'' (''longganisang Lucban''), and ''Longaniza de [[Cebu]]'' (''longganisang Sugbo/Cebu'') are examples.

While ''longganisa'' is widely accepted as the term for native sausages, in some parts of the Visayas and Mindanao ''chorizo'' ([[Visayan languages|Visayan]]: ''tsoriso'') is a more common term. There are regional varieties such as [[Vigan]] (with lots of garlic and not sweet) and [[Lucban, Quezon|Lucban]] (lots of oregano and pork fat is chunky). Most ''longganisa''s contain Prague powder and are hardly smoked and usually sold fresh. In general there are several common variants:
* ''matamis'', sweet
* ''jamonado'' or ''hamonado'', with lots of garlic, black pepper and other spices
* skinless, sans the usual natural casing and rolled in plastic sheets
* ''Chorizo de Macao'' (in reference to [[Macao]]. sweet and dried with lots of chunky fat and also identified with the red colored [[abacá]] twine)
* ''Chorizo de Bilbao'', with lots of paprika and usually kept in a can with lard. The best and most popular brand is ''Marca el Rey''; contrary to popular belief that it comes from [[Bilbao]], this is manufactured in the United States. ''Chorizo de Bilbao'' seems to be a purely Filipino term as the variant does not exist in Spain.

====Thailand====

There are many varieties of sausages known to [[Thai cuisine]], some of which are specialities of a specific [[Regions of Thailand|region of Thailand]]. From [[northern Thailand]] comes ''[[sai ua]]'', a grilled minced pork sausage flavored with [[Thai curry|curry paste]] and fresh herbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.cmu.ac.th/ntic/en_lannafood/detail_lannafood.php?id_food=188 |title=::Sai-ua ,Lanna Food,Thai Food,Thai Lanna Food,Food and Cuisine,Northern Thai Food,Herb,Thai Ingredient:: |publisher=Library.cmu.ac.th |date=9 July 2007 |accessdate=6 November 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023061622/http://library.cmu.ac.th/ntic/en_lannafood/detail_lannafood.php?id_food=188 |archivedate=23 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another grilled sausage is called ''[[sai krok Isan]]'', a fermented sausage with a distinctive slightly sour taste from [[northeastern Thailand]] (the region also known as [[Isan]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.shesimmers.com/2011/04/northeastern-thai-sour-sausage-sai-krok.html |title=Thai Fermented Sausages from the Northeast (Sai Krok Isan ไส้กรอกอีสาน) |publisher=Shesimmers.com |date=23 April 2011 |accessdate=6 November 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023121154/http://shesimmers.com/2011/04/northeastern-thai-sour-sausage-sai-krok.html |archivedate=23 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both sausages are commonly eaten with [[glutinous rice|sticky rice]], fresh vegetables, and a fresh ''[[nam phrik]]'' (Thai chilli paste) or some raw [[bird's eye chili]]es. They might also be served together with a refreshing [[Thai salad]] such as ''som tum'' ([[green papaya salad]]).

Also very popular in Thailand is ''[[naem]]'', a raw fermented pork sausage similar to the [[Vietnamese cuisine|Vietnamese]] ''nem chua'' and [[Lao cuisine|Laotian]] ''[[som moo]]''. This variety of sausage is often encountered as ''[[yam naem]]'' and ''naem khluk'', both of which are Thai salads. Adopted from Vietnam comes ''[[Giò lụa|mu yo]]''. It is somewhat similar in taste and texture to [[liverwurst]] and, served with a ''[[nam chim]]'' (Thai dipping sauce), a popular snack in Thailand. It too can be used as an ingredient for Thai salads and as a meat ingredient in, for instance, Thai soups. ''Kun chiang'' is a dry and sweet [[Chinese sausage]] which has also been incorporated into the Thai culinary culture. Known as ''lap cheong'' by [[Cantonese cuisine|Cantonese]], in Thailand it is most often used, again, as an ingredient for a Thai salad, ''yam kun chiang'', one that is normally only eaten together with ''khao tom kui'', a plain rice [[congee]]. A host of modern, factory-made, sausages have become popular as snacks in recent years. These most often resemble hot-dogs and frankfurters and are commonly sold grilled or deep-fried at street stalls, and served with a sweet, sticky and slightly spicy soy-based sauce.

====Turkey====
In Turkey, sausage is known as ''sosis'', which is made of beef. [[Sucuk]] (pronounced tsudjuck or [[sujuk]] with accent on the last syllable) is a type of sausage made in Turkey and neighboring Balkan countries. There are many types of sucuk, but it is mostly made from beef. It is fermented, spiced (with garlic and pepper) and filled in an inedible casing that needs to be peeled off before consuming. Slightly smoked sucuk is considered superior. The taste is spicy, salty and a little raw, similar to pepperoni. Some varieties are extremely hot and/or greasy. Some are "adulterated" with turkey, water buffalo meat, sheep fat or chicken. There are many dishes made with sucuk, but grilled sucuk remains the most popular. Smoke dried varieties are consumed "raw" in sandwiches. An intestinal loop is one sucuk. Smoked sucuk is usually straight.

===Europe===

====Britain and Ireland====
[[File:Sausages Oxford.jpg|thumb|right|Sausages, seen in [[The Covered Market, Oxford]]]]
In the UK and Ireland, sausages are a very popular and common feature of the national diet and popular culture. British sausages&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.englishbreakfastsociety.com/british-sausage.html |title=The British Sausage |publisher=The English Breakfast Society |accessdate=6 January 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106123125/http://www.englishbreakfastsociety.com/british-sausage.html |archivedate=6 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Irish sausages are normally made from raw (i.e., uncooked, uncured, unsmoked) pork, beef, venison or other meats mixed with a variety of herbs and spices and cereals, many recipes of which are traditionally associated with particular regions (for example [[Cumberland sausage]]s). They normally contain a certain amount of [[rusk]] or [[Rusk|bread-rusk]], and are traditionally cooked by frying, grilling or baking. They are most typically {{convert|10|–|15|cm|abbr=on}} long, the filling compressed by twisting the casing into concatenated "links" into the sausage skin, traditionally made from the prepared [[intestine]] of the slaughtered animal; most commonly a pig.

Due to their habit of often exploding due to shrinkage of the tight skin during cooking, they are often referred to as ''bangers'', particularly when served with the most common accompaniment of mashed potatoes to form a bi-national dish known as [[bangers and mash]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=9780992996505 |title=My Dearest: A War Story, a Love Story, a True Story of WW1 by Those Who Lived It |author=Aura Kate Hargreaves |publisher=Property People JV Ltd |accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sausagelinks.co.uk/?s=banger|title=banger - Search Results  - Sausage Links|website=www.sausagelinks.co.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112202548/http://www.sausagelinks.co.uk/?s=banger|archivedate=12 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Famously, they are an essential component of a [[Full breakfast|full English or Irish breakfast]]. Some are made to traditional regional recipes such as those from [[Cumberland sausage|Cumberland]] or [[Lincolnshire sausage|Lincolnshire]], and increasingly to modern recipes which combine fruit such as apples or apricots with the meat, or are influenced by other European styles such as the Toulouse sausage or [[chorizo]]. [[Vegetarian sausage]]s are also now very widely available, although traditional meatless recipes such as the Welsh ''[[Glamorgan sausage|Selsig Morgannwg]]'' also exist.

A popular and widespread snack is the [[sausage roll]] made from sausage-meat rolled in [[puff pastry]]; they are sold from most bakeries and often made at home. Sausages may be baked in a [[Yorkshire pudding]] batter to create "[[toad in the hole]]", often served with [[gravy]] and onions, or they may be cooked with other ingredients in a sausage [[casserole]]. In most areas, "sausage meat" for frying and [[stuffing]] into poultry or other meats is sold as ground, spiced meat without casing. [[Battered sausage]], consisting of a sausage dipped in batter, and fried, is sold throughout Britain from [[Fish and chips|Fish and Chip]] shops. In England, the [[saveloy]] is a type of pre-cooked sausage, larger than a typical hot-dog, which is served hot. A saveloy skin was traditionally colored with [[List of dyes|bismarck-brown]] dye giving saveloy a distinctive bright red color.

A thin variety of sausage, known as the [[chipolata]] is often wrapped in bacon and served alongside roast [[turkey meat|turkey]] at Christmas time and are known as [[Pigs in a Blanket]] or "Pigs in Blankets". They are also served cold at children's parties throughout the year. The word derives from the Italian "cipolatta", "onioned" or made with onion, although its meaning has been forgotten and it need not contain onion. [[Black pudding]], [[white pudding]] and [[Hog's pudding]] are fairly similar to their Scottish and European counterparts. Following concerns about health and user preference (distaste for horsemeat), heightened by the [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|BSE]] crisis in the 1990s and the 2013 [[horsemeat scandal]], the quality of the meat content in many British sausages improved with a return to the artisanal production of high quality traditional recipes, which had previously been in decline. However, many cheaper sausages contain [[mechanically recovered meat]] or [[meat slurry]], which must be so listed on packaging.

There are various laws concerning the meat content of sausages in the UK. The minimum meat content to be labelled Pork Sausages is 42% (30% for other types of meat sausages), although to be classed as meat, the Pork can contain 30% fat and 25% connective tissue. Often the cheapest supermarket pork sausages do not have the necessary meat content to be described as "pork sausages" and are simply labelled "sausages"; with even less meat content they are described as "bangers" (an unregulated name).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hisbe.co.uk/cheap-sausages/|title=When is a sausage not a sausage?|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113045504/http://hisbe.co.uk/cheap-sausages/|archivedate=13 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These typically contain [[Mechanically separated meat|MRM]] which was previously included in meat content, but under later EU law cannot be so described.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sausagelinks.co.uk/facts_health.asp | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100213114500/http://www.sausagelinks.co.uk/facts_health.asp | archivedate=13 February 2010| work = sausagelinks.co.uk | title = Health &amp; Legal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/features/the-secret-life-of-the-sausage-a-great-british-institution-422185.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=The secret life of the sausage: A great British institution | date=30 October 2006 | accessdate=23 May 2010 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323074939/http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/features/the-secret-life-of-the-sausage-a-great-british-institution-422185.html | archivedate=23 March 2010 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bulgaria====
[[Lukanka]] (луканка) is a spicy salami sausage unique to Bulgarian cuisine. It is similar to [[sujuk]], but often stronger flavored.

====Croatia / Serbia====
[[Kulen]] is a type of flavored sausage made of minced pork that is traditionally produced in Croatia (Slavonia) and Serbia (Vojvodina), and its designation of origin has been protected. The meat is low-fat, rather brittle and dense, and the flavor is spicy. The red paprika gives it aroma and color, and garlic adds spice. The original kulen recipe does not contain black pepper because its hot flavor comes from hot red paprika.

Other types of sausages in Serbia include Sremska, Požarevačka, and Sudžuk. And other types of sausages in Croatia include Češnjovka (Garlic Sausage) and Krvavica (a variation on Blood Sausage).

====Danmark====
''See the section [[#Nordic countries|Nordic countries]] below''

====Finland====
[[File:Mustamakkara1.jpg|thumb|Finnish ''[[mustamakkara]]'' with [[lingonberry]] jam]]
The generic word for sausage in Finnish is ''makkara''. Several types of Finnish makkara are similar in appearance to Polish sausages or [[bratwurst]]s, but have a very different [[taste]] and [[Mouthfeel|texture]]. Most makkara have very little spice and are therefore frequently eaten with [[Mustard (condiment)|mustard]], [[ketchup]], or other table condiments without a bun. Makkara is usually [[Grilling|grilled]], roasted over coals or open fire, steamed (called ''höyrymakkara'') or cooked on [[sauna]] heating stones.

''Nakki'' is a tinier edition of makkara. There are many types of nakki, with almost as much varieties as larger types of makkara. The closest relative to nakki in North-American cuisine is the thin [[knackwurst]]. ''[[Siskonmakkara]]'', a finely ground light-colored sausage, is usually encountered as the main ingredient of a soup named ''siskonmakkarakeitto''. Another variety is ''[[mustamakkara]]'', lit. black sausage, a specialty of [[Tampere]]. It is a type of [[blood sausage]] similar to the Scottish [[black pudding]]. A Finnish speciality is ''[[ryynimakkara]]'', a low-fat sausage which contains [[groat (grain)|groats]]. Pickled makkara, intended to be consumed as slices, is called ''kestomakkara''. This class includes various [[mettwurst]], salami and Balkanesque styles. The most popular kestomakkara in Finland is ''meetvursti'' (etymologically this word comes from ''mettwurst''), which contains finely ground full meat, ground fat and various spices. It is not unlike salami, but usually thicker and less salty. ''Meetvursti'' used to additionally contain horse meat, but hardly any brands contain it anymore, mostly due to the high cost of production. In general, there is no taboo against eating horse meat in Nordic countries, but the popularity has decreased with decreasing availability of suitable horse meat. There is also makkara and meetvursti with game, like [[deer]], [[moose]] or [[reindeer]] meat. Even a ''lohimakkara'', i.e., [[salmon]] sausage, exists. In Finland there are b- and a-classes of BBQ Sausages like Kabanossi, Camping and HK Sininen Lenkki, Blue Loop.

When a thick slice of a thick (diameter about {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on}}) makkara is fried and put together with cucumber salad and other fillings between two slices of toast, it becomes a ''[[porilainen]]'', named after the town of [[Pori]].

====France and Belgium====
[[File:Sausage S France.jpg|thumb|[[Saucisson]]s in a market in the south of France]]
[[Saucisson]] is perhaps one of the most popularized forms of dried sausage in France, with many different variations from region to region. Usually saucisson contains pork, cured with a mixture of salt, wine and/or spirits. Regional varieties sometimes contain more unorthodox ingredients such as nuts and fruits. Other French sausages include the [[diot]] and various types of [[boudin]].

The French language makes a difference between "saucisse" and "saucisson", where the former is usually meant to bake, and the latter is a dried sausage. However, the saucisse is only popular near the Germanic border (Belgium, Switzerland, regions near Germany, ...), and won't be found often in the centre of France.

====Germany====
For the enormous variety of German sausages follow the specific links on the {{main article|Category:German sausages}}
[[File:Milzwurst at Aumeister restaurant.jpg|thumb|A plate of ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Milzwurst|de}}'' – [[spleen]] sausage, served with [[potato salad]], [[mayonnaise]] and lemon, at the {{Interlanguage link multi|Aumeister|de}} [[inn]] in Munich, Germany]]
German sausages include [[Hot dog|Frankfurters/Wieners]], [[Bratwurst|Bratwürste]], Rindswürste, [[Knackwurst|Knackwürste]], and [[Bockwurst|Bockwürste]].  [[Currywurst]], a dish of sausages with curry sauce, is a popular fast food in Germany.

====Greece====
[[Loukaniko]] is the common Greek word for pork sausage, but in English it refers specifically to Greek sausages flavored with orange [[peel (fruit)|peel]], [[fennel]] seed and other herbs.

====Hungary====
[[Hungarian sausages]], when smoked and cured, are called [[kolbász]] – different types are often distinguished by their typical regions, e.g. ''[[Kolbász|gyulai]]'' and ''[[Kolbász|csabai]]'' sausage. As no collective word for "sausage" in the English sense exists in Hungarian, local salamis (see e.g. [[winter salami]]) and boiled sausages "hurka" are often not considered when listing regional sausage varieties. The most common boiled sausages are rice liver sausage ("Májas Hurka") and blood sausage ("Véres Hurka"). In the first case, the main ingredient is liver, mixed with rice stuffing. In the latter, the blood is mixed with rice, or pieces of bread rolls. Spices, pepper, salt and marjoram are added.

====Iceland====
''See the section [[#Nordic countries|Nordic countries]] below''

====Italy====
[[Italian sausage]]s (''salsiccia'' – plural ''salsicce'') are often made of pure pork. Sometimes they may contain beef. [[Fennel]] seeds and chilli are generally used as the primary spices in the South of Italy, while in the center and North of the country black pepper and garlic are more often used. In [[Apulia]] ''salsiccia'' is called ''zampina'' (plural ''zampine'').

A different type of sausage that is popular in Italy, found in many varieties, is ''[[salame]]'' (plural {{italics correction|''salami''}}), made from coarsely ground meat (pork or beef) mixed with fat, salted and dried. Spices are added as for ''salsiccia''. ''Salami'' are ready-to-eat as purchased; typically, they are sliced thinly for consumption and eaten cold, for instance as ''[[salumi]]''.

====Macedonia====
Macedonian sausages (''kolbas, lukanec'') are made from fried pork, onions, and [[leek]]s, with herbs and spices.

====Malta====
Maltese sausage (''[[Maltese language|Maltese]]'': ''Zalzett tal-Malti'') is made of pork, sea salt, black peppercorns, coriander seeds and parsley. It is short and thick in shape and can be eaten grilled, fried, stewed, steamed or even raw when freshly made. A barbecue variety is similar to the original but with a thinner skin and less salt.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, Georgina (30 June 2013).

====Netherlands and Belgium====
[[Dutch cuisine|Dutch]] and [[Belgian cuisine]] is not known for its abundant use of sausages in its traditional dishes. Nevertheless, the Dutch have a number of sausage varieties, such as the ''[[rookworst]]'' (smoked sausage) and the dried ''slagersworst'' (lit. "butchers sausage") mostly found at the specialist butcher shops and still made by hand and spiced following traditionally family recipes. Another common variety in the Netherlands is the ''runderworst'' which is made from beef and the dried sausage known as ''[[metworst]]'' or ''droge worst''. The Dutch {{italics correction|''[[braadworst]]''}}'s name might suggest its being a variant of the German-style [[bratwurst]], but this is not the case; it is more closely related to the well-known [[Afrikaans|Afrikaner]] [[Boerewors]].

====Nordic countries====
[[File:Sausages on a Barbecue.jpg|thumb|Sausages on a [[barbecue]] in Oslo]]
[[Nordic countries|Nordic]] sausages ({{lang-da|pølse}}, {{lang-no|pølsa/pølse/pylsa/korv/kurv}}, {{lang-is|bjúga/pylsa/grjúpán/sperðill}}, {{lang-sv|korv}}) are usually made of 60–80% very finely ground pork, very sparsely spiced with [[Black pepper|pepper]], [[nutmeg]], [[allspice]] or similar sweet spices (ground [[mustard seed]], onion and sugar may also be added). Water, lard, rind, [[potato starch|potato starch flour]] and soy or milk protein are often added for binding and filling. In southern Norway, grill and wiener sausages are often wrapped in a ''lompe'', a potato flatbread somewhat similar to a ''[[lefse]]''.

Virtually all sausages will be industrially precooked and either fried or warmed in hot water by the consumer or at the [[hot dog stand]]. Since hot dog stands are ubiquitous in Denmark (known as ''[[Pølsevogn]]'') some people regard ''[[pølser]]'' as one of the [[national dish]]es, perhaps along with [[medisterpølse]], a fried, finely ground pork and bacon sausage. The most noticeable aspect of Danish boiled sausages (never the fried ones) is that the casing often contains a traditional bright-red dye. They are also called ''wienerpølser'' and legend has it they originate from [[Vienna]] where it was once ordered that day-old sausages be dyed as a means of warning.

The traditional Swedish ''[[falukorv]]'' is a sausage made of a grated mixture of pork and beef or veal with potato flour and mild spices, similarly red-dyed sausage, but about 5&amp;nbsp;cm thick, usually baked in the oven coated in mustard or cut in slices and fried. The sausage got its name from [[Falun]], the city from where it originates, after being introduced by German immigrants who came to work in the region's mines. Unlike most other ordinary sausages it is a typical home dish, not sold at hot dog stands. Other Swedish sausages include ''[[prinskorv]]'', ''[[fläskkorv]]'', ''{{Interlanguage link multi|köttkorv|sv}}'' and ''[[isterband]]''; all of these, in addition to ''falukorv'', are often accompanied by potato mash or ''[[rutabaga#Preparation and use|rotmos]]'' (a root vegetable mash) rather than bread. ''[[Isterband]]'' is made of pork, barley groats and potato and is lightly smoked.

In Iceland, [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]] may be added to sausages, giving them a distinct taste. Horse sausage and mutton sausage are also traditional foods in Iceland, although their popularity is waning. Liver sausage, which has been compared to haggis, and blood sausage are also a common foodstuff in Iceland.

====Norway====

====Poland====
[[File:Kiełbasy, myśliwska, surowa, góralska, frankfuterek biały, parówkowa.jpg|thumb|Polish sausages: myśliwska, surowa, góralska, biała, parówkowa]]

Polish sausages, [[kiełbasa]], come in a wide range of styles such as swojska, krajańska, szynkowa (a [[ham sausage]]), biała, śląska, [[krakowska]], podhalańska, [[Kishka (food)|kishka]] and others. Sausages in Poland are generally made of pork, rarely beef. Sausages with low meat content and additions like soy protein, potato flour or water binding additions are regarded as of low quality. Because of climate conditions, sausages were traditionally preserved by [[Smoking (cooking)|smoking]], rather than drying, like in Mediterranean countries.

Since the 14th century, Poland excelled in the production of sausages, thanks in part to the royal hunting excursions across virgin forests with game delivered as gifts to friendly noble families and religious [[hierarchy]] across the country. The extended list of beneficiaries of such diplomatic generosity included city magistrates, academy professors, [[voivode]]s, [[szlachta]] and [[kapituła]]. Usually the raw meat was delivered in winter, but the processed meat, throughout the rest of the year. With regard to varieties, early Italian, French and German influences played a role. Meat commonly preserved in fat and by smoking was mentioned by historian [[Jan Długosz]] in his annals:''Annales seu cronici incliti regni Poloniae'' The ''Annales'' covered events from 965 to 1480, with mention of the hunting castle in [[Niepołomice]] along with King Władysław sending game to Queen Zofia from [[Niepołomice Forest]], the most popular hunting ground for the [[List of Polish monarchs|Polish royalty]] beginning in the 13th century.&lt;ref name="T-P" /&gt;

====Portugal and Brazil====
[[Embutido]]s (or enchidos) and [[linguiça]] generally contain hashed meat, particularly pork, seasoned with aromatic herbs or spices (pepper, red pepper, paprika, garlic, rosemary, thyme, cloves, ginger, nutmeg, etc.).

====Scotland====
[[Haggis]] is generally recognized as the national dish, although not described as a sausage. A popular breakfast food is the [[sliced sausage|square sausage]]. This is normally eaten as part of a full [[Scottish breakfast]] or on a Scottish morning roll. The sausage is produced in a rectangular block and individual portions are sliced off. It is seasoned mainly with pepper. It is rarely seen outside Scotland and in fact is still fairly uncommon in the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Other types of sausage include [[black pudding]], similar to the German and Polish blood sausages. [[Stornoway black pudding]] is held in high regard and measures are currently being taken to bring it under EU geographical protection. Additionally a popular native variety of sausage is the [[red pudding]]. It is usually served in [[chip shop]]s, deep fried in batter and with chips as a red pudding supper.

====Spain====
In Spain, fresh sausages, ''[[salchicha]]s'', which are eaten cooked, and cured sausages, ''[[embutido]]s'', which are eaten uncooked, are two distinct categories. Among the cured sausages are found products like [[chorizo]], [[salchichón]], and [[sobrasada]]. [[Blood sausage]], [[morcilla]], is found in both cured and fresh varieties. They are made with pork meat and blood, usually adding rice, garlic, paprika and other spices. There are many regional variations, and in general they are either fried or cooked in [[cocido]]s.

Fresh sausage may be red or white. Red sausages contain [[paprika]] ([[pimentón]] in Spanish) and are usually fried; they can also contain other spices such as garlic, pepper or thyme. The most popular type of red sausage is perhaps ''txistorra'', a thin and long paprika sausage originating in [[Navarre]].  White sausages do not contain paprika and can be fried, boiled in wine, or, more rarely, in water.

====Switzerland====
[[File:Cervelat.jpg|thumb|[[Cervelat]]]]
The [[cervelat]], a cooked sausage, is often referred to as Switzerland's national sausage. A great number of regional sausage specialties exist as well.

===Latin America===

In most of Latin America, a few basic types of sausages are consumed, with slight regional variations on each recipe. These are ''[[Chorizo#South America|chorizo]]'' (raw, rather than cured and dried like its Spanish namesake), ''[[longaniza]]'' (usually very similar to ''chorizo'' but longer and thinner), ''[[morcilla]]'' or ''relleno'' (blood sausage), and ''salchichas'' (often similar to [[hot dog]]s or [[Vienna sausage]]s). Beef tends to be more predominant than in the pork-heavy Spanish equivalents.

====Argentina and Uruguay====

In Argentina and Uruguay, many sausages are consumed. Eaten as part of the traditional ''[[asado]]'', ''chorizo'' (beef and/or pork, flavored with spices) and ''morcilla'' (blood sausage or [[black pudding]]) are the most popular. Both share a Spanish origin. One local variety is the ''salchicha argentina'' (Argentine sausage), ''criolla'' or ''parrillera'' (literally, barbecue-style), made of the same ingredients as the chorizo but thinner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asadoargentina.com/article/sausage-chorizo/ |title=Sausage-Chorizo |publisher=Asado Argentina |accessdate=31 January 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212140247/http://www.asadoargentina.com/article/sausage-chorizo/ |archivedate=12 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are hundreds of salami-style sausages. Very popular is the ''salame tandilero'', from the city of [[Tandil]].

Vienna sausages are eaten as an appetizer or in hot dogs (called panchos), which are usually served with different sauces and salads. [[Leberwurst]] is usually found in every market. Weisswurst is also a common dish in some regions, eaten usually with mashed potatoes or ''chucrut'' ([[sauerkraut]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clarin.com/diario/2005/05/27/sociedad/s-04201.htm |title=La salchicha de viena cumple 200 años |publisher=Clarin.com |date=27 May 2005 |accessdate=31 January 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312075259/http://www.clarin.com/diario/2005/05/27/sociedad/s-04201.htm |archivedate=12 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pasqualinonet.com.ar/Propuesta%20empanada.htm | language = Spanish | title = La inmigración: hecho integrador de La Argentina y el surgir de una nueva gastronomía | work = La Cocina de Pasqualino Marchese | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100721223239/http://www.pasqualinonet.com.ar/Propuesta%20empanada.htm | archivedate = 21 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chile====

''[[Longaniza]]'' is the most common type of sausage, or at least the most common name in Chile for sausages that also could be classified as [[chorizo]]. The Chilean variety is made of four parts pork to one part [[bacon]] (or less) and seasoned with finely ground garlic, salt, pepper, cumin, oregano, paprika and chilli sauce. The cities of [[Chillán]] and [[San Carlos, Chile|San Carlos]] are known among Chileans for having the best ''longanizas''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisischile.cl/1253/2/gastronomy/News.aspx  Gastronomy, Chile’s top traditional foods: a visitor’s guide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111172557/http://www.thisischile.cl/1253/2/gastronomy/News.aspx |date=11 November 2013 }} 29 July 2009, retrieved 6 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlasvivodechile.com/?s=longanizas Chilean Longanizas, detailed explanation of the traditional method] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111164444/http://www.atlasvivodechile.com/?s=longanizas |date=11 November 2013 }} www.atlasvivodechile.com retrieved 11 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Another traditional sausage is the ''prieta'', the Chilean version of [[black pudding|blood sausage]], generally known elsewhere in Latin America as ''morcilla''. In Chile, it contains onions, spices and sometimes walnut or rice and is usually eaten at ''[[asado]]s'' or accompanied by simple boiled potatoes. It sometimes has a very thick skin so is cut open lengthwise before eating. "Vienesa"s or [[Vienna sausages]] are also very common and are mainly used in the ''[[completo]]'', the Chilean version of the hot dog.

====Colombia====
[[File:Butifarras soledeñas.jpg|thumb|[[Butifarras Soledeñas]] from [[Soledad, Atlántico]], Colombia]]
A grilled chorizo served with a buttered ''[[arepa]]'' is one of the most common [[street food]]s in Colombia. [[Butifarras Soledeñas]] are sausages from [[Soledad, Atlántico]], Colombia.  In addition to the standard Latin American sausages, dried pork sausages are served cold as a snack, often to accompany beer drinking. These include ''cábanos'' (salty, short, thin, and served individually), ''[[butifarra]]s'' (of [[Catalan cuisine|Catalan]] origin; spicier, shorter, fatter and moister than cábanos, often eaten raw, sliced and sprinkled with lemon juice) and ''salchichón'' (a long, thin and heavily processed sausage served in slices).

====Mexico====
[[File:Salchicha oaxaqueña.png|thumb|Salchicha oaxaqueña, a type of semi-dry sausage from the Mexican state of [[Oaxaca]]]]
The most common [[Mexican cuisine|Mexican]] sausage by far is ''chorizo''. It is fresh and usually deep red in color (in most of the rest of Latin America, chorizo is uncolored and coarsely chopped). Some chorizo is so loose that it spills out of its casing as soon as it is cut; this crumbled ''chorizo'' is a popular filling for [[torta]] sandwiches, eggs, [[breakfast burrito]]s and [[taco]]s. ''Salchichas'', ''longaniza'' (a long, thin, lightly spiced, coarse chopped pork sausage), [[moronga]] (a type of blood pudding) and [[head cheese]] are also widely consumed.

====El Salvador====
[[file:Chorizo de Cojutepeque.jpg|left|thumb|100px|Typical sausages from Cojutepeque, El Salvador]]
In El Salvador, chorizos are quite common, and the ones from the city of [[Cojutepeque]] are particularly well known there. The links, especially of those from Cojutepeque, are separated with corn husks tied in knots (see photo). Like most chorizos in Latin America, they are sold raw, and must be cooked.

===North America===
[[File:Frankfurter wurst.JPG|thumb|upright|[[hot dog|Frankfurter sausage]]]]

North American [[breakfast sausage|breakfast or country sausage]] is made from uncooked ground pork, breadcrumbs and salt mixed with [[Black pepper|pepper]], [[salvia officinalis|sage]], and other spices. It is widely sold in grocery stores in a large synthetic plastic casing, or in links which may have a protein casing. It is also available sold by the pound without a casing. It can often be found on a smaller scale in rural regions, especially in southern states, where it is either in fresh patties or in links with either natural or synthetic casings as well as smoked. This sausage is most similar to English-style sausages and has been made in the United States since colonial days. It is commonly sliced into small patties and pan-fried, or cooked and crumbled into [[scrambled eggs]] or [[gravy]]. [[Scrapple]] is a pork-based breakfast meat that originated in the [[Mid-Atlantic States]]. Other uncooked sausages are available in certain regions in link form, including [[Italian sausage|Italian]], [[bratwurst]], [[chorizo]], and [[linguica]].

In Louisiana, there is a variety of sausage that is unique to its heritage, a variant of [[andouille]]. Unlike the original variety native to Northern France, Louisiana andouille has evolved to be made mainly of pork butt, not tripe, and tends to be spicy with a flavor far too strong for the mustard sauce that traditionally accompanies French andouille: prior to casing, the meat is heavily spiced with cayenne and black pepper. The variety from Louisiana is known as [[Tasso ham]] and is often a staple in [[Cajun cuisine|Cajun]] and [[Louisiana Creole cuisine|Creole]] cooking. Traditionally it is smoked over pecan wood or sugar cane as a final step before being ready to eat. In Cajun cuisine, [[boudin]] is also popular. Sausages made in the French tradition are popular in Québec, Ontario, and parts of the Prairies, where butchers offer their own variations on the classics.  Locals of [[Flin Flon]] are especially fond of the [[Saucisse de Toulouse]], which is often served with [[poutine]].

[[Hot dog]]s, also known as frankfurters or wieners, are the most common pre-cooked sausage in the United States and Canada. Another popular variation is the [[corn dog]], which is a hot dog that is deep fried in cornmeal batter and served on a stick. A common and popular regional sausage in New Jersey and surrounding areas is [[pork roll]], usually thinly sliced and grilled as a breakfast meat.

Other popular ready-to-eat sausages, often eaten in [[sandwich]]es, include [[salami]], American-style [[Bologna sausage|bologna]], [[Lebanon bologna]], [[prasky]], [[liverwurst]], and [[head cheese]]. [[Pepperoni]] and Italian sausage are popular [[pizza]] toppings.

===Oceania===

====Australia====
[[File:Cooking snags over campfire.jpg|thumb|Australian "snags" cooking on a campfire]]

Australian sausages have traditionally been made with beef, pork and [[Chicken (food)|chicken]], while recently [[game meat]]s such as [[kangaroo]] have been used that typically have much less fat. English style sausages, known colloquially as "snags", come in two varieties: thin, that resemble an English 'breakfast' sausage, and thick, known as 'Merryland' in South Australia. These types of sausage are popular at [[barbecue]]s, and can be purchased from any butcher or supermarket. [[Devon (sausage)|Devon]] is a spiced pork sausage similar to [[Bologna sausage]] and [[Gelbwurst]]. It is usually made in a large diameter, and often thinly sliced and eaten cold in sandwiches.

[[Mettwurst]] and other German-style sausages are highly popular in [[South Australia]], often made in towns like [[Hahndorf, South Australia|Hahndorf]] and [[Tanunda, South Australia|Tanunda]], due to the large German immigration to the state during early settlement. Mettwurst is usually sliced, and eaten cold on sandwiches or alone as a snack. A local variation on [[cabanossi]], developed by Italian migrants after World War II using local cuts of meat, is a popular snack at parties. The Don small goods company developed a spiced snack-style sausage based on the cabanossi in 1991 called Twiggy Sticks.

====New Zealand====
[[Sausage roll]]s are a popular snack and party food, as are [[saveloy]]s, [[savaloy|cheerios]], and locally manufactured [[cabanossi]]. Traditional sausages similar to English bangers are eaten throughout the country; these are usually made of finely ground beef or mutton&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hellers.co.nz/sausages-family-range|title=Hellers' Family Range of Sausages|publisher=Hellers.co.nz|accessdate=18 January 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100513221307/http://www.hellers.co.nz/sausages-family-range|archivedate=13 May 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; with breadcrumbs, very mildly spiced, stuffed into an edible collagen casing which crisps and splits when fried. These may be eaten for breakfast, lunch or dinner. In recent years, many international and exotic sausages have also become widely available in NZ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/genre/recipes/a/apple,_onion_and_sausage_casserole|title=Apple, onion and sausage casserole|publisher=Radionz.co.nz|accessdate=18 January 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100522071457/http://www.radionz.co.nz/genre/recipes/a/apple,_onion_and_sausage_casserole|archivedate=22 May 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other variations==
[[File:Kabosi, Macaroni, and Cheese.jpg|thumb|Kabosi, shells, and cheese]]
Sausages may be served as [[hors d'œuvre]]s, in a [[sandwich]], in a bread roll as a hot dog, wrapped in a [[tortilla]], or as an ingredient in dishes such as [[stew]]s and [[casserole]]s. It can be served on a stick (like the [[corn dog]]) or on a bone as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://taiwanonymous.blogspot.com/2006/08/sausage-on-bone.html Sausage on a bone] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715175514/http://taiwanonymous.blogspot.com/2006/08/sausage-on-bone.html |date=15 July 2007 }}, a relatively recent phenomenon.&lt;/ref&gt; Sausage without casing is called ''sausage meat'' and can be fried or used as stuffing for poultry, or for wrapping foods like [[Scotch egg]]s. Similarly, sausage meat encased in [[puff pastry]] is called a ''[[sausage roll]]''.

Sausages are almost always fried in oil, served for any meal, particularly breakfast or lunch and often "sweet sausages" have been created which are made with any of the above: dried fruit, nuts, caramel and chocolate, bound with butter and sugar. These sweet sausages are refrigerated rather than fried and usually, however, served for dessert rather than as part of a savory course. Sausages can also be modified to use indigenous ingredients. Mexican styles add oregano and the ''guajillo'' red pepper to the Spanish [[chorizo]] to give it an even hotter spicy touch. Certain sausages also contain ingredients such as cheese and apple, or types of vegetable.

'''Sogdianus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|ɔː|ɡ|d|i|ˈ|eɪ|n|ə|s}} or {{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|ɒ|ɡ|d|i|ˈ|eɪ|n|ə|s}}) was king of [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]] in 424–423 BC. He ruled the [[Achaemenid Empire]] for a short time, with little recognition in his kingdom known primarily from the writings of [[Ctesias]]. He was reportedly an illegitimate son of [[Artaxerxes I]] by his [[concubine]] Alogyne of [[Babylon]].

The last inscription mentioning Artaxerxes I being alive can be dated to December 24, 424 BC. His death resulted in at least three of his sons proclaiming themselves Kings. The first was [[Xerxes II]], who was reportedly his only legitimate son by [[Queen consort|Queen]] Damaspia and was formerly [[Crown Prince]]. He was apparently only recognized in Persia. The second was Sogdianus himself, possibly recognized in [[Elam]]. The third was [[Darius II|Ochus]], son of Artaxerxes I by his [[concubine]] Cosmartidene of [[Babylon]] and [[satrap]] of [[Hyrcania]]. Ochus was also married to their common half-sister [[Parysatis]], daughter of Artaxerxes I and his [[concubine]] Andia of [[Babylon]]. The first inscription of Ochus as [[Darius II of Persia|Darius II]] can be dated to January 10, 423 BC. He seems to have been recognized by [[Medes]], [[Babylonia]] and [[Egypt]].

This chaotic state of affairs would prove short-lived. Xerxes II only ruled for forty-five days. He was reportedly murdered while drunk by Pharnacyas and Menostanes on Sogdianus' orders. Sogdianus apparently gained the support of his regions. He reigned for six months and fifteen days before being captured by his half-brother, Ochus, who rebelled against him. Sogdianus was executed by being [[Suffocation in ash|suffocated in ash]] because Ochus had promised he would not die by the sword, by poison or by hunger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kitto|first= J|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=wd0-AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PR98-IA43 |title= Palestine: the Bible History of the holy land|publisher= Clarendon Press|year= 1841| page=657}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ochus became Darius II; he was the sole ruler of the Persian Empire until 404 BC.

'''''The Pawnee capture of the Cheyenne Sacred Arrows''''' occurred around 1830 in central [[Nebraska]], when the [[Cheyenne]] attacked a group from the [[Skidi|Skidi Pawnee]] tribe, who were hunting [[bison]]. The Cheyenne had with them their [[sacred bundle]] of four [[arrow]]s, called the Mahuts. During the battle, this sacred, ceremonial object was taken by the Pawnee. The Cheyenne initially made replica arrows but also tried to get the originals back. They recovered one from the Pawnee directly, either given to them or taken by them, and a second was captured by the [[Lakota people|Lakota]] and returned to the Cheyenne in exchange for horses. The two corresponding replicas were ceremonially returned to the [[Black Hills]], where the arrows were traditionally believed to have originated. Eventually the bundles were re-established and the societies and their ceremonies continue into the present day. 

==Background==
Likely, the [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]] lived in villages of earth lodges in the present-day state of [[Nebraska]]&lt;ref name=Blaine1990&gt;Blaine, Martha R. (1990): ''Pawnee Passage, 1870-1875''.

The Chawi, the Kitkahahki and the Pitahawirata made up the South Bands&lt;ref name=Murie1981/&gt;{{rp|183, 195 and 199}} as they lived south of the [[Platte River]].&lt;ref name=Murie1981/&gt;{{rp|4}} &lt;ref name=Blaine1990/&gt;{{rp|72}} Just some years later, they would move north and gather in the same area as the Skidi Pawnee.&lt;ref name=Jensen1994&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jensen |first1=Richard E |title=The Pawnee Mission, 1834-1846 |journal=[[Nebraska History]] |date=1994 |volume=75 |pages=301-310 |url=https://history.nebraska.gov/sites/history.nebraska.gov/files/doc/publications/NH1994PawneeMission.pdf |accessdate=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|305}} The Pawnee raised corn and other crops near their villages. However, they went on long communal [[bison]] hunts in both summer and winter. While out on the [[Great Plains|plains]], they lived in skin tents and [[tipi]]s.&lt;ref name=Blaine1990/&gt;{{rp|71-84}}

The final groups of Cheyenne Indians seem to have crossed the [[Missouri River]] from eastern [[North Dakota]] in the last quarter of the 18th century.

The renewal of the arrows form one of the most [[sacred]] of the Cheyenne ceremonies, and traditionally take place during the same time every summer, as well as in response to unfortunate events, such as a homicide or other tragedy.&lt;ref name="Schaefer2008"/&gt;{{rp|268}}

==Prelude==
A year before this historic battle, a party of Cheyenne warriors intended to raid the Pawnee near the lower Platte. The party was discovered and all killed, just as the Cheyenne had done ten years before after the killing of thirty Cheyenne [[Cheyenne military societies#Bowstring|Bowstring]] warriors by the Crow. The tribe vowed to avenge the war group by moving the against those to blame for the killings.&lt;ref name=Hyde1987/&gt;{{rp|49}}

In the summer of 1830, the entire Cheyenne tribe started down the Platte.{{efn|The year 1830 was agreed upon by a Cheyenne and a Pawnee, both participating in the battle.&lt;ref name=Grinnell1910/&gt;{{rp|556}} Although some give the year as 1833.&lt;ref name=Hyde1987/&gt;{{rp|48}}}} A number of allied [[Lakota people|Lakota]] and [[Arapaho]] joined. The special custodian or keeper of the Sacred Arrows, White Thunder, and his wife led them.&lt;ref name=Hyde1987/&gt;{{rp|49}} The scouts sent out to locate the enemy found no traces of the Pawnee. By chance, the group came across four messengers from a party of scouts, who had been killed by the Pawnee.&lt;ref name=Grinnell1910/&gt;{{rp|557}} The scouts finally located a large camp of Pawnees at the head of the [[Loup River|South Loup]].&lt;ref name=Hyde1987/&gt;{{rp|49}} (According to the Pawnee, they had camp somewhere on Platte River).&lt;ref name=Dorsey1903&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dorsey |first1=George A. |authorlink1=George Amos Dorsey |title=How the Pawnee Captured the Cheyenne Medicine Arrows |journal=[[American Anthropologist]] |date=1903 |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=644-658 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/658944 |accessdate=19 July 2018 |oclc=254963378}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|644}}

After marching for another day and night march, the body of people reached a place near the Pawnee camp in the early morning. The warriors prepared for battle. The women and children grouped in a circle where they had a view of the flat area soon to become a battlefield.&lt;ref name=Hyde1987/&gt;{{rp|49}} &lt;ref name=Grinnell1910/&gt;{{rp|558}} The Pawnee camp seems to have been hidden on the other side of a ridge.

The Cheyenne warriors and their allies placed themselves in two separate wings. The Sacred Arrows were in front of one wing, and the other wing would follow a man wearing the sacred Buffalo Hat. "These two great medicines protected all who were behind them ... and rendered the enemy in front helpless".&lt;ref name=Hyde1987/&gt;{{rp|50}}

Meanwhile, the first bison hunters left the Pawnee camp and almost stumbled on the lined of the army. The battle was on, and White Thunder was unable to restrain the Cheyenne. Without having performed the required ceremony, he handed over the arrow bundle to a selected medicine man named Bull. Bull in turn hastily tied the whole bundle to the middle of his lance.&lt;ref name=Dorsey1903/&gt;{{rp|646}} Then he mounted his horse and tried to catch up with the rest of the warriors.&lt;ref name=Hyde1987/&gt;{{rp|57}}

==Battle==
[[File:The area where the Pawnee captured the Sacred Arrows of the Cheyenne.jpg|thumb|upright 2.7|The area where the Pawnee captured the Sacred Arrows of the Cheyenne]]
"The battle was hard fought".&lt;ref name=Dorsey1903/&gt;{{rp|647}} An old Pawnee, apparently a Pitahawirata&lt;ref name=Grinnell1910/&gt;{{rp|552}} from the South Bands, was sick and tired of living. He had told his relatives to carry him to the very [[front line]] of the battle.&lt;ref name=Dorsey1903/&gt;{{rp|645}} He was sitting on the ground with a bow and some arrows. Bull wanted to [[Counting coup|count coup]] on this enemy, although the rest of the Cheyenne tried to talk him from it.&lt;ref name=Grinnell1910/&gt;{{rp|558}} The old Pawnee avoided the thrust with the lance and seized it. He dragged it from Bull, who slowly rode back to his own line. "This spear must be a wonderful spear ...", shouted the Pawnee, when he saw the medicine bundle in a wrapping of hide tied to it. The Pawnee rushed forward. Chief Big Eagle came first and secured the lance before the Cheyenne could recapture it.&lt;ref name=Dorsey1903/&gt;{{rp|649}}&lt;ref name="Powell1998"/&gt;{{rp|37}}

During the fight, Chief Big Eagle wore the Wonderful Leggings of Pahukatawa. The leggings were a part of a tribal war bundle, and they seemed to make Big Eagle fearless. "Through the power of these leggings the Skiri [Skidi] captured the wonderful Cheyenne arrows".&lt;ref name=MuriepartI&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Murie |first1=James R. |last2=Parks |first2=Douglas R. |title=Ceremonies of the Pawnee, Part I: The Skiri |journal=[[Smithsonian Contributions to Anthropology]] |date=1981 |volume=27 |url=https://repository.si.edu/handle/10088/1337 |accessdate=19 July 2018 |oclc=756235349}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|66}} Further, Big Eagle was dressed in a red shirt and wore a government medal on his breast. Throughout the battle, he rode on a small spotted horse. Therefore, the Cheyenne remembered him as Spotted Horse or Big Spotted Horse.&lt;ref name=Dorsey1903/&gt;{{rp|648}} &lt;ref name=Grinnell1910/&gt;{{rp|552}}

According to the Cheyenne, they killed the old Pawnee on the battlefield.&lt;ref name=Grinnell1910/&gt;{{rp|558}} The Pawnee say, he first died the next summer during a Cheyenne attack on an almost empty Pawnee village.&lt;ref name=Dorsey1903/&gt;{{rp|651}}

With the Sacred Arrows gone and [[morale]] low, the Cheyenne failed to withstand a renewed charge by the Pawnee and retreated.&lt;ref name="Powell1998"/&gt;{{rp|37-8}} "How many were killed on either side was not known".&lt;ref name=Grinnell1910/&gt;{{rp|558}} Later, the Cheyenne retreated up the Platte, mourning the loss of the arrows, which [[George Bent]] described as "... the greatest disaster the Cheyennes ever suffered."&lt;ref name=Hyde1987/&gt;{{rp|51}}&lt;ref name=Hyde1987/&gt;{{rp|152}}

==Aftermath==
Pawnee Chief Big Eagle concluded they had captured something of extraordinary importance when he examined the arrows. He was keeper of the [[Pawnee mythology|Morning Star]] bundle of the Skidi Pawnee and placed three of the arrows in that bundle.&lt;ref name=Dorsey1903/&gt;{{rp|650}} &lt;ref name=MuriepartI/&gt;{{rp|66}} 

Some time after the battle, the best Cheyenne arrow makers made four surrogate Sacred Arrows.&lt;ref name=Hyde1987/&gt;{{rp|53}}&lt;ref name=Grinnell1910/&gt;{{rp|558-560}} However, they also tried in various ways to retrieve the originals. Once, they invited Big Eagle and the Pawnees to their camp. In return for the four arrows they promised the guests many horses. Big Eagle expected treachery and brought just one arrow wrapped in a bundle. As feared, a Cheyenne rode away with the arrow in an unguarded moment.&lt;ref name=Dorsey1903/&gt;{{rp|657}} Another source recounts that three Cheyenne, White Thunder, Old Bark, and Doll Man traveled to a Skidi village in 1835 where they were received in Big Eagle's lodge and given one Buffalo Arrow. Despite gifts of more than a hundred horses, no more arrows were returned.&lt;ref name="Powell1998"/&gt;{{rp|39}}

They recognized the Man Arrow and returned it to the Cheyenne in exchange for one hundred horses.&lt;ref name="Powell1998"/&gt;{{rp|39}}&lt;ref name=Mallory1886/&gt;{{rp|141}} 

Two of the remade Sacred Arrows were now in excess. A ceremony was held, and the Cheyenne left two of the new arrows in a bundle in a crevice of the Black Hills, near the place where Sweet Medicine had received the original arrows. There they remained for a long while, and were occasional visited by Cheyenne travelers, before eventually disappearing.&lt;ref name=Hyde1987/&gt;{{rp|55}}&lt;ref name="Grinnell2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Grinnell|first=George Bird|title=The Cheyenne Indians: Their History and Lifeways : Edited and Illustrated|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GzxHTeOe8FcC|year=2008|publisher=[[World Wisdom]]|isbn=978-1-933316-60-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|224}}

Efforts to restore the additional two original arrows were again made in the 1890s and 1930s to no avail.&lt;ref name="Powell1998"/&gt;{{rp|40-1}} The return of the remaining arrows remained a source of bitterness for generations.&lt;ref name="Lookingbill2015"/&gt;

'''William Joseph Donovan''' (January 1, 1883 – February 8, 1959) was an American soldier, lawyer, [[intelligence officer]] and diplomat, best known for serving as the head of the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS), the precursor to the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], during [[World War II]]. He is regarded as the founding father of the CIA, and a statue of him stands in the lobby of the [[George Bush Center for Intelligence|CIA headquarters building]] in [[Langley, Virginia]].

A decorated veteran of [[World War I]], Donovan is the only person to have received all four of the United States' highest awards: The [[Medal of Honor]], the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]], the [[Distinguished Service Medal (U.S. Army)|Distinguished Service Medal]], and the [[National Security Medal]].&lt;ref name="Arlington"&gt;[http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/wjodonov.htm William J. Wild Bill Donovan, Major General, United States Army]. Arlingtoncemetery.net; retrieved August 27, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He is also a recipient of the [[Silver Star]] and [[Purple Heart]], as well as decorations from a number of other nations for his service during both World Wars.

==Early life==

Of [[Irish people|Irish]] descent, Donovan was born in [[Buffalo, New York]], to Anna Letitia "Tish" Donovan (née [[Lennon (name)|Lennon]]) and Timothy P. Donovan, both American-born children of Irish immigrants. The Lennons were from [[Ulster]], the Donovans from [[County Cork]]. Donovan's grandfather Timothy O'Donovan (Sr.) was from the town of [[Skibbereen]]; raised by an uncle who was a parish priest, he married Donovan's grandmother Mary Mahoney, who belonged to a propertied family of substantial means that disapproved of him. They first moved to Canada and then to Buffalo, New York, where they dropped the "O" from their name. Donovan's father, born in 1858, worked as the superintendent of a Buffalo railroad yard, then as secretary for Holy Cross Cemetery, and also would attempt to engage in a political career, but with little success.&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Donovan was born on New Year's Day in 1883. (Named William, he chose his middle name, Joseph, at the time of his confirmation.) He had two younger brothers and two younger sisters who survived into adulthood and several additional younger siblings who died in infancy or childhood. "From Anna's side of the family came style and etiquette and the dreams of poets," Donovan's biographer, Douglas Waller, has written. "From Tim came toughness and duty and honor to country and clan."&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Donovan attended [[St. Joseph's Collegiate Institute]], a Catholic institution at which he played football, acted in plays, and won an award for oratory. He went on to [[Niagara University]], a Catholic university and seminary where he undertook a [[pre-law]] major. Considering the priesthood, he ultimately decided "he wasn't good enough to be a priest," although he did win another oratorical contest, this time with a speech warning of corrupt, anti-Christian forces that threatened the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the expectation of studying law, Donovan eventually transferred to [[Columbia University]], where he looked beyond "Catholic dogma" and attended Protestant and Jewish worship services to decide whether he wanted to change religions.&lt;ref name="Waller 2011 13"&gt;Waller 2011, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the [[Phi Kappa Psi]] fraternity, rowed on varsity crew, again won a prize for oratory, was a campus football hero, and was voted the "most modest" and one of the "handsomest" members of the graduating class of 1905.

After earning his bachelor of arts, Donovan spent two years at [[Columbia Law School]], where he was a classmate of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], and studied under [[Harlan Fiske Stone]]. Returning to Buffalo, he joined the respected law firm of Love &amp; Keating in 1909 and, two years later, opened his own Buffalo firm in partnership with a Columbia classmate, Bradley Goodyear. In 1914, their firm merged with another, becoming Goodyear &amp; O'Brien.&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912, Donovan helped form, and became the leader of, a troop of cavalry of the [[New York National Guard]].&lt;ref name=Legion&gt;Thomas A. Rumer, ''The American Legion: A Official History, 1919–1989'', New York: M. Evans and Co., 1990; pg. 107.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This unit was [[mobilization|mobilized]] in 1916 and served on the [[U.S.-Mexico border|U.S.–Mexico border]] during the American government's campaign against [[Pancho Villa Expedition|Pancho Villa]].&lt;ref name=Legion/&gt; He studied military strategy and combat tactics.&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; He also took acting courses in New York City from a stage star of the day, Eleanor Robson.&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1914, he married Ruth Rumsey, a Buffalo heiress who had attended Rosemary Hall.&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1916, Donovan spent several months in [[Berlin]] on behalf of the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], seeking to persuade the governments of [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Germany]] to allow the shipment of food and clothing into [[Belgium]], [[Serbia]], and [[Poland]]. In July of that year, at the behest of the State Department, he returned to the U.S. and took his cavalry troop to the Texas border to join [[General John Pershing]]'s army in the hunt for Pancho Villa.&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted to major in the field, he returned to Buffalo, then joined the [[69th Infantry Regiment (New York)|69th Regiment]], also known as the "Fighting Irish Regiment". This was the same 69th of Civil War fame,&lt;ref&gt;Sean Michael Flynn "The Fighting 69th&lt;/ref&gt; later called the 165th, which was training for America's expected entry into [[World War I]], and which became part of the [[42nd Infantry Division (United States)|42nd Division]], also known as the "Rainbow Division".&lt;ref&gt;William Manchester American Caesar&lt;/ref&gt; [[Douglas MacArthur]] was the 42nd Division's chief of staff.&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 18,20.&lt;/ref&gt; Donovan's son David was born in 1915, and a daughter, Patricia, was born in 1917. (Patricia died in an accident in 1940.)&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War I==
[[File:111-SC-25158 - NARA - 55209863-cropped.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Donovan as a Lt. Colonel with the 165th Regiment in France in September 1918.]]

During World War I, Major Donovan led the 1st battalion, 165th Regiment of the 42nd Division. Serving in [[France]], he suffered a [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]] wound in one leg and was almost blinded by gas. After performing a rescue under fire, he was offered the [[Croix de Guerre]], but turned it down because a [[Jewish]] soldier who had taken part in the rescue had not also been awarded the honor. When this insult was corrected, Donovan accepted the distinction.&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt; He also was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]] for leading an assault during the [[Third Battle of the Aisne|Aisne-Marne campaign]], in which hundreds of members of his regiment died, including his acting adjutant, the poet [[Joyce Kilmer]].&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; The events of this battle and the 69th Infantry Regiment's role in it were dramatised in the James Cagney movie, "[[The Fighting 69th]]".

Donovan's remarkable level of endurance, which far exceeded that of the much younger soldiers under his command, led those men to give him the nickname "Wild Bill", which stuck with him for the rest of his life. Although he "professed annoyance with the nickname," his wife "knew that deep down he loved it."&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Appointed [[chief of staff]] of the 165th Regiment,&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Donovan fought in another battle that took place near [[Landres-et-Saint-Georges]] on October 14–15, 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Going into battle, Donovan "ignored the officers' custom of covering or stripping off insignia of rank (targets for snipers) and instead sallied forth wearing his medals", according to Evan Thomas.&lt;ref name="Vanity Fair"/&gt; "They can't hit me and they won't hit you!" he told his men.&lt;ref name="Vanity Fair"/&gt; Struck in the knee by a bullet, he "refused to be evacuated and continued to direct his men until even American tanks were turning back under withering German fire."&lt;ref name="Vanity Fair"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thomas|first1=Evan|title=Spymaster General|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2011/03/wild-bill-donovan201103|accessdate=February 11, 2017|publisher=Vanity Fair|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After lobbying by his friend [[Francis P. Duffy|Father Francis Duffy]], a famous and widely revered [[Army chaplain]], Donovan was awarded an [[Oak Leaf Cluster]] of the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]] (i.e., a second DSC) for his service in that battle. After the [[Armistice]], Donovan remained in [[Europe]] as part of the occupation. On returning to New York in April 1919, Donovan, now a colonel, was widely discussed as a possible candidate for governor, but he rejected the idea, proclaiming his intention to return to Buffalo and resume the practice of law.&lt;ref name=CaveBrown&gt;Anthony Cave Brown, ''Wild Bill Donovan: The Last Hero''; 978-0-8129-1021-6&lt;!-- year, page(s) needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:William Joseph Donovan cph.3b17495.jpg|thumb|upright|Donovan in 1924, during his time in the Department of Justice]]

Following his return to the U.S., Donovan took his wife on a combined vacation, business trip, and intelligence mission to [[Japan]], [[China]], and [[Korea]], then went on alone to [[Siberia]].&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 32–33&lt;/ref&gt; He went back to work at his law firm, but also took an extensive journey to Europe, where he did business on behalf of [[J.P. Morgan|J. P. Morgan]] and gathered intelligence about international Communism.&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1922 to 1924, while maintaining his private law practice, he also served as [[US Attorney for the Western District of New York]]. A high point came in 1923, when, as a result of continued pressure from [[Father Duffy]], Donovan was finally awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] for his heroic acts in the battle at [[Landres-et-Saint-Georges]]. Presented with the medal at a New York City ceremony that was attended by about four thousand veterans, Donovan refused to keep it, saying that it belonged not to him but "to the boys who are not here, the boys who are resting under the white crosses in France or in the cemeteries of New York, also to the boys who were lucky enough to come through."&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Legion/&gt;

Meanwhile, as US Attorney, he was becoming well known as a vigorous crime-fighter.&lt;ref name="Waller 2011 38"&gt;Waller 2011, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; He was especially famous (and, in some circles, notorious) for his energetic enforcement of Prohibition.&lt;ref name="Waller 2011 38"/&gt; There were a number of threats to assassinate him and to dynamite his home, but he was not deterred. The climax of his war on alcohol came in August 1923, when his agents raided Buffalo's upmarket [[Saturn Club]] (of which Donovan himself was a member) and confiscated large amounts of illegal liquor. The club's members, who formed much of the city's upper crust, were outraged, having assumed that Prohibition did not apply to people such as themselves. Some regarded Donovan as a traitor to their class, and recalled that Donovan had not, after all, been born to high station but was, in fact, an Irish Catholic who had married into the world of privileged, professional Protestants. Donovan's law partner, Bradley Goodyear, quit their firm in anger over the raid, and Donovan's own wife never forgave him for it. Many working class residents of Buffalo cheered the raid as an example of equal justice before the law, however.&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 36–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, when [[President Calvin Coolidge]] cleaned house at the Department of Justice in the wake of the late President [[Warren G. Harding]]'s [[Teapot Dome scandal]], he appointed Donovan's former professor Harlan Stone as [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] and named Donovan as Stone's assistant, in charge of the criminal division. Donovan and his wife split their time between Washington and Buffalo, where he continued to run his law firm.&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt; At the Justice Department, Donovan hired women and eschewed yes-men. He and his wife became a popular Washington couple, although Donovan's relationship with the acting Director of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|Bureau of Investigation]], [[J. Edgar Hoover]], briefly one of his underlings, was fraught with friction.&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Stone was appointed to the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] in 1925, Donovan was put in charge of the Department of Justice's antitrust division, often serving as ''[[de facto]]'' Attorney General during the frequent absences of Stone's successor, [[John Garibaldi Sargent]]. Donovan was admired for his energetic and effective arguments before the Supreme Court, and was a favorite off-the-record source for the Washington press corps. He was talked up as a possible candidate for Governor of New York in 1926 and for the [[United States Vice President|Vice Presidency]] in 1928; [[Herbert Hoover]] promised to make him Attorney General if Hoover won the Presidency in 1928, but instead, under the influence of [[anti-Catholic]] Southerners, among others, Hoover ended up offering him the governorship of the [[Philippines]], a post Donovan turned down.&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 39–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Resigning from the Department of Justice in 1929, Donovan moved to [[New York City]] and formed a new law firm in partnership with Frank Raichle. Despite the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|stock market crash]], he made a success of handling the [[merger]]s, acquisitions, and [[Bankruptcy|bankruptcies]] that resulted, and also acquired such clients as the movie stars [[Mae West]] and [[Jane Wyman]].&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 41–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Donovan ran on the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] line in 1932 to succeed Franklin D. Roosevelt as [[Governor of New York]].&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt; Assisting Donovan in his 1932 campaign was journalist [[James J. Montague]], who served as "personal adviser and campaign critic".&lt;ref name=nyt-obit&gt;"James Montague, Versifier, Is Dead," ''[[New York Times]]'', December 17, 1941&lt;/ref&gt; But despite Donovan's offstage charm and force, he proved to be an uninspiring campaigner on the stump. He ran a disorganized, strategy-free campaign, and in the end lost to the Democratic nominee, [[Herbert Lehman]].&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
During the interwar years, as "part of an informal network of American businessmen and lawyers who closely tracked and collected intelligence on foreign affairs," Donovan traveled extensively in Europe and Asia, "establishing himself as a player in international affairs – and honing his skills as an intelligence gatherer overseas." He met with such foreign leaders as [[Benito Mussolini]],&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; with whom he discussed World War I, the expansionist ideology of [[Italian Fascism]], and Roosevelt's prospects for re-election in 1936. Mussolini granted Donovan permission to visit the Italian front in [[Ethiopia]], where he found [[Italian Armed Forces|Italy's military]] much improved since the war and predicted an Italian victory. Donovan also made connections with leading figures in [[Nazi Germany]]. But he was no friend of the dictators, publicly assailing [[Hitler]], Mussolini, and [[Stalin]] as [[totalitarian]]s and taking steps to protect his Jewish clients in Europe from the [[Nazi]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 51–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Donovan openly believed during this time that a second major European war was inevitable. His foreign experience and realism earned him the friendship of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, notwithstanding their extreme differences in domestic policy and despite the fact that Donovan, during the [[New York state election, 1932|1932 election]] campaign, had harshly criticized Roosevelt's record as Governor of New York. The two men were from opposing political parties, but were similar in personality.&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 44,55.&lt;/ref&gt; Roosevelt respected Donovan's experience, felt that Hoover had done Donovan wrong on the Attorney General appointment, and believed that if Donovan had been a Democrat he could have been elected President. Also, Donovan's national profile had risen considerably thanks to the 1940 [[Warner Brothers]] film ''[[The Fighting 69th]]'', in which [[Pat O'Brien (actor)|Pat O'Brien]] played Father Duffy and [[George Brent]] played Donovan, and Roosevelt recognized a useful opportunity to exploit Donovan's newfound popularity. As the two men began exchanging notes about developments abroad, Roosevelt recognized that Donovan could be an important ally and adviser.&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 54–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roosevelt came to place great value on Donovan's insight. Following Germany's and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]'s invasions of Poland in September 1939 and the start of [[World War II]] in Europe, President Roosevelt began to put the United States on a war footing. This was a crisis of the sort that Donovan had predicted, and he sought out a responsible place in the wartime infrastructure. On the recommendation of Donovan's friend, [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] [[Frank Knox]], Roosevelt gave him a number of increasingly important assignments. In 1940 and 1941, Donovan traveled as an informal [[Diplomat|emissary]] to Britain, where he was urged by Knox and Roosevelt to gauge Britain's ability to withstand Germany's aggression.&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

During these trips, Donovan met with key officials in the British war effort, including [[Winston Churchill]] and the directors of [[British intelligence agencies|Britain's intelligence services]].&lt;ref name="Secret Wars"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=Gordon|title=Secret Wars: One Hundred Years of British Intelligence Inside MI5 and MI6|date=February 16, 2010|publisher=Macmillan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aAqjMjs09P0C&amp;pg=PT124&amp;dq=William+Donovan+%22Britain%27s+intelligence+services%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjG6_-zvOvSAhUM8mMKHTcECg8Q6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=churchill&amp;f=false|accessdate=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also had lunch with [[King George VI]]. Donovan and Churchill got along famously, sharing war stories and reciting in unison the nineteenth-century poem "The Cavalier's Song" by [[William Motherwell]].&lt;ref name="Vanity Fair"/&gt; Impressed by Donovan and cheered by his eagerness to help Britain, Churchill ordered that he be given unlimited access to classified information. Donovan returned to the U.S. confident of Britain's chances and enamored of the possibility of founding an American intelligence service modeled on that of the British.&lt;ref name="Secret Wars"/&gt; He strongly urged Roosevelt to give Churchill the aid he requested. Roosevelt wanted to provide such aid, and asked Donovan to use his knowledge of the law to figure out how to skirt the congressional ban on selling armaments to the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Vanity Fair"/&gt;

British diplomats, who shared Churchill's admiration for Donovan, expressed the wish to State Department officials that Donovan replace U.S. Ambassador to Britain [[Joseph P. Kennedy]], who favored the appeasers and was defeatist regarding British prospects.  In the view of [[Walter Lippmann]], a political columnist, Donovan's findings about Britain's fighting capability "almost singlehandedly overcame the unmitigated defeatism which was paralyzing Washington." Donovan also examined U.S. naval defenses in the Pacific (which he found wanting) and visited several countries along the Mediterranean and in the Middle East, serving as an unofficial envoy for both the U.S. and Britain and urging leaders there to stand up to the Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 59–63.&lt;/ref&gt; He also met frequently in New York with [[William Stephenson]], a spy for MI6 who was known as "Intrepid". Donovan and Stephenson, according to [[Evan Thomas]], "eventually became so close that they were known as 'Big Bill' and 'Little Bill'."&lt;ref name="Vanity Fair"/&gt; Donovan, Douglas Waller has said, "could not have formed the OSS without the British, who provided intelligence, trainers, organizational charts and advice – all with the idea of making OSS an adjunct to British intelligence. But Donovan wanted to mount his own operations."&lt;ref name="History Net"&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with 'Wild Bill' Donovan Biographer Douglas Waller|url=http://www.historynet.com/interview-with-wild-bill-donovan-biographer-douglas-waller.htm|website=History Net|publisher=History Net|accessdate=February 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===OSS===
[[File:Maj Gen William J 'Wild Bill' Donovan, Director, OSS and Colonel William Harding Jackson (ca 1945).jpg|thumb|250px|upright|Major General William J. Donovan, Director, OSS and Colonel William H. Jackson in April 1945.]]
On July 11, 1941, Roosevelt signed an order naming Donovan [[Office of the Coordinator of Information|Coordinator of Information]] (COI). "At the time," Evan Thomas has written, "the U.S. government had no formal spy agency. In 1929, the Secretary of State, [[Henry L. Stimson]], had abolished the highly effective [[Black Chamber]], a code-breaking organization left over from World War I." In Stimson's view, "Gentlemen do not read each other's mail."&lt;ref name="Vanity Fair"/&gt; To be sure, the Army, Navy,  (FBI), State Department, and other entities all ran their own intelligence units, but they were feeble and isolated from one another. They also saw Donovan's new operation as a threat to their turfs.&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, Donovan began to lay the groundwork for a centralized intelligence program. It was he who organized the COI's New York headquarters in Room 3603 of [[Rockefeller Center]] in October 1941 and asked [[Allen Dulles]] to head it; the offices Dulles took were on the floor immediately above the location of the operations of Britain's [[MI6]].&lt;ref name="Waller 2011, p. 352"&gt;Waller 2011, p. 352.&lt;/ref&gt; Evan Thomas has described the OSS as an "informal" and "freewheeling" place where "[r]ank meant little." David Bruce later recalled: "Woe to the officer who turned down a project because, on its face, it seemed ridiculous or at least unusual&amp;nbsp; ... His imagination was unlimited. Ideas were his plaything. Excitement made him snort like a race horse." Throughout the war, the OSS would endure criticism by segments of the U.S. media and by many highly placed figures in the U.S. government and military. General [[George Marshall]] was an early critic but later changed his mind. Eisenhower was always supportive, as was George Patton.&lt;ref name="History Net"/&gt;

On December 7, after the [[Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]], Donovan met privately with Roosevelt and [[Edward R. Murrow]], and FDR told Donovan, apropos of the COI, "It's a good thing you got me started on this."&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; When Hitler gave a speech declaring war on the United States, he mentioned Donovan, whom he called "utterly unworthy".&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; Donovan urged Roosevelt not to intern [[Japanese-Americans]], warning that such an action would address a problem that did not exist, do harm to loyal Americans, and provide the Japanese with ammunition for their [[propaganda]].&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

Donovan set up espionage and sabotage schools, established [[front companies]], arranged clandestine collaborations with international corporations and the [[Holy See|Vatican]], and oversaw the invention of new, espionage-friendly guns, cameras, and bombs. Donovan also recruited agents, selecting individuals with a wide range of backgrounds – ranging from intellectuals and artists to people with criminal backgrounds. He hired a great many female spies, dismissing criticism by those who felt women were unsuited to such work. Among his prominent recruits were film director [[John Ford]], actor [[Sterling Hayden]], author [[Stephen Vincent Benet]], and [[Eve Curie]], daughter of the scientists [[Marie Currie|Marie]] and [[Pierre Curie]].&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 93–101,107.&lt;/ref&gt; Other OSS recruits included poet [[Archibald MacLeish]], banker [[Paul Mellon]], [[Alfred I. du Pont|Alfred du Pont]], [[Julia Child]], psychologist [[Carl Jung]] (who helped with the effort to analyze the psyches of Hitler and other Nazi leaders), author [[Walter Lord]], and members of the [[Auchincloss]] and [[Vanderbilt family|Vanderbilt families]]. There were so many aristocrats in the agency that the joke went around that OSS stood for "Oh So Social".&lt;ref name="Vanity Fair"/&gt;

In 1942, the COI ceased being a White House operation and was placed under the aegis of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Roosevelt also changed its name to the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS).&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; Donovan was returned to active duty in the [[U.S. Army]] in his World War I rank of [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]]. He was promoted to brigadier general in March 1943 and to major general in November 1944. Under his leadership the OSS would eventually conduct successful espionage and sabotage operations in Europe and parts of Asia, but continued to be kept out of South America owing to [[J. Edgar Hoover]]'s hostility to Donovan,&lt;ref name="Waller 2011, p. 151"&gt;Waller 2011, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; which also had a deleterious impact on efforts to share information between the two agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 127–128.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the OSS was blocked from the Philippines by the antipathy of General [[Douglas MacArthur]], the commander of the Southwest Pacific Theater.&lt;ref name="Waller 2011, p. 151"/&gt; OSS espionage and other on-site activities helped prepare the ground for the 1942 Allied invasion of North Africa, however,&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 130–144.&lt;/ref&gt; and Donovan himself took part in the Allied landing at Salerno, Italy, on September 3, 1943,&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 178–179.&lt;/ref&gt;  and at the Anzio landing on January 22, 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt;

Donovan was in fact very active in virtually every theater of World War II. He spent a good deal of time in the [[Balkans]], to which he had urged both Roosevelt and Churchill to pay more attention. He met in Europe with highly placed anti-Nazi Germans to broker an early peace that would allow for occupation by the Western Allies, establish a democratic Germany, and leave the Soviets out in the cold.&lt;ref name="Waller 2011 183 192"&gt;Waller 2011, p. 183–192.&lt;/ref&gt; In China, he struggled with [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and his underlings for permission to carry out espionage activities in their territory.&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 205=214.&lt;/ref&gt; He inspected OSS operations in Burma,&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 214–219.&lt;/ref&gt; met with [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] in Moscow to arrange for cooperation between the OSS and [[NKVD]],&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 220–224.&lt;/ref&gt; and was present for MacArthur's successful April 1944 invasion of Hollandia on the northern coast of [[New Guinea]].&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 233–234.&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the OSS was most effective in the Balkans, China, Burma, and France.&lt;ref name="History Net"/&gt;

By 1943, Donovan's relations with British officials were becoming increasingly strained as a result of turf wars, strategic and tactical disagreements, radical differences in style and temperament (the British accused the OSS of playing "cowboys and red Indians"), and contrasting visions of the postwar world.&lt;ref name="Waller 2011 183 192"/&gt; (The British wanted to retain their empire; Donovan saw the empire, at least in some instances, as an impediment to democracy and economic development.)&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; [[MI6]] chief [[Stewart Menzies]] was extremely hostile towards the idea of OSS operations anywhere in the [[British Empire]], and categorically forbade the OSS to operate within the [[United Kingdom|UK]], or to deal with allied [[governments in exile]] which were based in London. Nonetheless, as of May 1944, Donovan had "some eleven thousand American officers and foreign agents scattered in every important capital."&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; During the war he also received intelligence from a network of Catholic priests across Europe who engaged in espionage without the Pope's knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 256–257.&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[D-Day]], Donovan was on one of the ships that took part in the [[Normandy landing]]. Going ashore, he and his commander of covert operations in Europe, Colonel [[David K. E. Bruce|David Bruce]], were shot at by a German plane, then moved on toward the American front lines and encountered German machine-gun fire. As they lay on the ground, Bruce later recalled, Donovan said, "David, we mustn't be captured. We know too much." Donovan said that he had two suicide pills, but then discovered he didn't. "I must shoot first," Donovan said. Bruce replied, "Yes, sir, but can we do much against machine guns with our pistols?" Donovan explained: "Oh, you don't understand. I mean, if we are about to be captured, I'll shoot you first. After all, I am your commanding officer."&lt;ref name="Vanity Fair"/&gt;

Eventually, they found their way to [[General Omar Bradley]]'s newly set-up tent headquarters on the beach. Upon returning to Washington, Donovan reported directly to Roosevelt on what he had observed. The success of the invasion, he said, showed that German naval and air forces were definitely no longer "Big League" and that "something has died in the German machine."&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 242–248.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the month was over, he was in Italy, implementing reforms in the OSS operation in that theater. He also met with [[Pope Pius XII]], telling him about the activities of intelligence agents working out of the Japanese embassy at the Vatican.&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 250–252.&lt;/ref&gt; During the weeks leading up to the [[Operation Valkyrie|Valkyrie plot]] to kill Hitler, [[Allen Dulles]], Donovan's man in [[Switzerland]], who was in contact with the plotters, kept him abreast of developments.&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 259–263.&lt;/ref&gt;

A particular triumph for the OSS was the role it played in conveying intelligence from southern France in the run-up to the [[Operation Dragoon|Allied landing on the French Riviera]] on August 15, 1944. Thanks to Donovan's spies, said Colonel [[William Wilson Quinn|William Quinn]], the invading army "knew everything about that beach and where every German was." Donovan was present for that invasion, too, after which he returned to Rome for a secret meeting with Hitler's envoy to the Vatican, [[Ernst von Weizsäcker]].&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 264–265.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, he met with [[Josip Broz Tito|Marshal Tito]] to discuss OSS operations in Yugoslavia.&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 274–280.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in August 1944, Donovan came into conflict with Churchill over the OSS's support for Greek anti-royalists.&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 280–282.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the closing days of the war in Europe, Donovan spent much of his time in London, where he worked out of a command center that took up an entire floor of [[Claridge's Hotel]]. He fielded reports from across the continent, where the Wehrmacht was in such chaos that he "knew their positions on the battlefield better than German generals did." In one of many initiatives, he sent out "teams of French, Danish, Norwegian, and Polish nationals" to identify Gestapo officers who had tortured them and who now were trying to blend in with civilians in Allied-controlled areas of Germany. Acting on Donovan's orders, Dulles oversaw the surrender of the remaining Nazi forces in Italy several days in advance of the final German capitulation.&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 315–318.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lovell 1963"&gt;Lovell, Stanley P.

===Postwar plans===
As World War II began to wind to a close in early 1945, Donovan began to focus on preserving the OSS beyond the end of the war. A February 19 article in the ''[[Washington Times-Herald]]'' revealed his plans for a postwar intelligence agency and published a secret memo he had sent to Roosevelt proposing its creation. The article compared the proposed agency to the Gestapo. Knowing that Americans wanted a smaller federal government after the war, Roosevelt was not entirely sold on Donovan's proposal, although Donovan felt reasonably confident he could talk the president into the idea. J. Edgar Hoover disapproved of Donovan's plan, which he saw as a direct threat to FBI authority, even though Donovan had stressed that his agency would operate only abroad, not domestically.&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 304–309.&lt;/ref&gt; After Roosevelt's death in April, however, Donovan's political position was substantially weakened. Although he argued forcefully for the OSS's retention, he found himself opposed by the new president, Harry S. Truman. While the OSS got "glowing reviews" from many wartime commanders, notably Eisenhower, who described its contributions as "vital", critics dismissed it as "an arm of British intelligence" and, like the Times-Herald reporter, painted dark pictures of it as an American Gestapo in the making.&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuremberg trials===
While British authorities and the US military and State Department were relatively indifferent to the question of trying war criminals after the war, Donovan was lobbying Roosevelt as early as October 1943 to arrange for such prosecutions. Roosevelt tasked Donovan with looking into the legalities and technicalities, and in the months that followed Donovan collected testimonies about war criminals and related information from a wide range of sources. In addition to seeking justice, Donovan wanted to exact retribution for the torture and killing of OSS agents. When Truman named Supreme Court Justice [[Robert H. Jackson|Robert Jackson]] to serve as chief U.S. counsel in the prosecution of Nazi war criminals, Jackson, discovering that the OSS was the only agency that had seriously explored the issue, invited Donovan to join his trial staff.&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 17, 1945, Donovan flew to Europe to prepare for the prosecutions, and eventually brought 172 OSS officers onto Jackson's team, interviewing [[Auschwitz]] survivors, tracking down SS and Gestapo documents, and uncovering other evidence. Donovan, whose idea it was to hold the trials in [[Nuremberg]], also introduced Jackson to useful foreign officials and even released OSS funds to bankroll the prosecution effort. Eventually, Jackson, who had been a political rival of Donovan's in New York State, considered him a "godsend"; in return for Donovan's help, but also because the OSS had proven "vital for the prosecution team," Jackson lobbied Truman in person to approve of Donovan's plans for a permanent postwar intelligence agency.&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 323–331.&lt;/ref&gt; The effort was unsuccessful, however. On September 20, 1945, Truman signed an executive order abolishing the OSS.&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 338.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Nuremberg]], Donovan interrogated many prisoners, including [[Hermann Göring]], whom he spoke with ten times. But eventually Donovan fell out with Jackson. The latter wanted to indict the entire German High Command, not just men who had personally ordered or committed war crimes; Donovan considered this a violation of American principles of fairness. Donovan, a former prosecutor, also criticized Jackson's lack of skill and experience at putting together a strong case and at courtroom examination and cross-examination. Jackson removed him from the team, and Donovan returned to the U.S., where in January 1946 Truman presented him with the [[Distinguished Service Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 342–349.&lt;/ref&gt;

===CIA===

In 1946, Donovan resumed the practice of law and began writing a history of American intelligence since the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolution]] – a book he never completed. He traveled extensively in Europe and Asia and ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate.&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 350–351.&lt;/ref&gt;

He also became chairman of the newly founded [[American Committee on United Europe]] (ACUE), which worked to counter the new Communist threat to Europe by promoting European political unity. The vice-chairman was [[Allen Dulles]], and [[Walter Bedell Smith]] sat on the board as well. The ACUE financed the European Movement, the most important federalist organization in the immediate postwar years. (In 1958, the ACUE provided 53.5% of the movement's funds.) In addition, the ACUE provided all of the funding for the [[European Youth Campaign]], in which [[Joseph Retinger]], [[Robert Schuman]], and [[Paul-Henri Spaak]] began their political careers.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford, Clark, ''Counsel To The President, A Memoir'', New York: Random House, 1991, pp. 165–66.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Truman moved forward with plans for a new intelligence agency, finally giving approval in 1946 for a watered-down interdepartmental "Central Intelligence Group." Donovan warned that it would be ineffectual – he compared it to a "debating society" – and he soon proved to be right. As the Cold War quickly intensified, Truman recognized the need for a far stronger intelligence service, and in February 1947 asked Congress to approve plans for a Central Intelligence Agency along the lines Donovan had proposed.&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 350–352.&lt;/ref&gt; Donovan himself lobbied Congress privately to pass the enabling legislation, the [[National Security Act of 1947]].&lt;ref name="Lovell 1963"/&gt; It was, in Waller's words, "a vindication of Donovan's vision".&lt;ref name="Waller 2011, p. 352"/&gt; Among the OSS members who went on to become major CIA figures were Allen Dulles, William Casey, William Colby, and James Jesus Angleton.&lt;ref name="History Net"/&gt;

Donovan wanted to lead the CIA, and had many supporters who urged Truman to put him in charge. Instead, the president gave the job to Admiral [[Roscoe Hillenkoetter]], whom Waller described as "lackluster". Meanwhile, Donovan accepted a Truman appointment to head a committee studying the country's fire departments. But he worked behind the scenes to aid in the formation of the CIA, recommending that Hillenkoetter hire Dulles and other OSS veterans, suggesting various covert operations, and sharing contacts and information from behind the [[Iron Curtain]]. After returning from abroad, U.S. businessmen and ambassadors passed information to Donovan that he shared with the CIA. Instead of being grateful for Donovan's help, Truman was furious, considering him an intrusive meddler.&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 353.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1952 presidential election, Donovan campaigned for Eisenhower, who had become a good friend since the war. After his victory, Donovan hoped to be named CIA head, but instead Eisenhower appointed Allen Dulles, whose brother, [[John Foster Dulles]], was the new Secretary of State. Eisenhower offered to make Donovan the [[US Ambassador to France|Ambassador to France]], but Donovan turned down the offer, not wanting to work closely with John Foster Dulles, for whom he had little respect. In August 1953, however, he did accept the post of [[US Ambassador to Thailand|Ambassador to Thailand]], because the country was an important Cold War front and the position was one in which he felt he could operate with relative independence from Secretary Dulles.&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 360–363.&lt;/ref&gt;

Donovan took up that post on September 4. While in [[Thailand]], he frequently traveled to [[Vietnam]], which was vulnerable to Communist takeover, a fate he felt the U.S. ambassador to that country, [[Donald Heath]], lacked the energy and vision to prevent.&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt; One source says that he "was deeply involved in setting up C.I.A. operations in Vietnam and throughout Southeast Asia."&lt;ref name="Vanity Fair"/&gt; Although his performance as ambassador received glowing reviews from the [[Thai government]], he resigned from his position effective August 21, 1954.&lt;ref name="Seamus Dubhghaill"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Doyle|first1=Jim|title=Death of William Joseph "Wild Bill" Donovan|url=https://seamusdubhghaill.com/2016/02/08/death-of-william-joseph-wild-bill-donovan/|website=Seamus Dubhghaill|publisher=Seamus Dubhghaill|accessdate=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chiefs of Mission for Thailand"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chiefs of Mission for Thailand|url=https://history.state.gov/departmenthistory/people/chiefsofmission/thailand|website=Office of the Historian|publisher=Department of State|accessdate=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After returning to the U.S., he resumed his law practice and registered as a lobbyist for the Thai government. Eisenhower made him chairman of the People to People Foundation, a group that arranged international citizen exchanges; Donovan also worked with the [[International Rescue Committee]], co-founded [[American Friends of Vietnam]], and in 1956 raised a large sum of money for Hungarian refugees.&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2011, p. 373–375.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Donovan had begun experiencing symptoms of dementia while in Thailand, and he was hospitalized in 1957. While in the hospital, he "imagined he saw the Red Army coming over the 59th Street bridge, into Manhattan, and in one memorable last mission, fled the hospital, wandering down the street in his pajamas." Shortly before his death, he was visited by Eisenhower, who later told a friend that Donovan was "the last hero".&lt;ref name="Vanity Fair"/&gt;

Donovan died at the age of 76 from complications of [[vascular dementia]] on February 8, 1959, at [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name=CaveBrown/&gt; Upon learning of his death, the CIA sent a cable to its station chiefs: "The man more responsible than any other for the existence of the Central Intelligence Agency has passed away."&lt;ref name="Vanity Fair"/&gt; He is buried in Section 2 of [[Arlington National Cemetery]].&lt;ref name=CaveBrown/&gt; After his death, Donovan was awarded the [[Freedom Award]] of the [[International Rescue Committee]].&lt;ref name=cia2009december31/&gt;  The law firm he founded, [[Donovan, Leisure, Newton &amp; Irvine]], was dissolved in 1998.&lt;ref name="nytobit"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/20/business/donovan-leisure-old-line-law-firm-to-shut-its-doors.html "Donovan, Leisure, Newton &amp; Irvine shuts its doors"}, nytimes.com, April 20, 1998.]&lt;/ref&gt; His home in [[Chapel Hill (Berryville, Virginia)|Chapel Hill]] near [[Berryville, Virginia]], was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2004.&lt;ref name="nris"&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, it was suggested that a new federal courthouse in Buffalo be named after Donovan, but instead, it was named after Robert H. Jackson, his rival prosecutor at Nuremberg. In 2014, U.S. Senator [[Charles Schumer]] asked the [[U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs]] to name an upstate New York cemetery after Donovan. In 2016, however, the VA decided against using Donovan's name. "It is outrageous that nothing has been done to honor Gen. Donovan, one of America's greatest patriots, in Buffalo or western New York," declared Charles Pinck, president of the OSS Society, who had thought the naming of the cemetery after Donovan was "a done deal".&lt;ref name="The Japan Times"&gt;{{cite news|title=N.Y. vets' cemetery won't bear 'Wild Bill' Donovan's name, irking WWII U.S. spy group|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/05/25/world/n-y-vets-cemetery-wont-bear-wild-bill-donovans-name-irking-wwii-u-s-spy-group/#.WKt3wLYrKV5|accessdate=February 27, 2017|publisher=The Japan Times|date=May 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major General Donovan is a member of the [[Military Intelligence Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref name="nytobit"/&gt; He is also known as the "Father of American Intelligence" and the "Father of Central Intelligence".&lt;ref name=cia2009december31&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/news-information/featured-story-archive/gen.-william-j.-donovan-heads-oss.html CIA: ''Look Back&amp;nbsp;... Gen. William J. Donovan Heads Office of Strategic Services''], cia.gov; accessed February 27, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cia1993september22&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/vol3no3/html/v03i3a07p_0001.htm CIA: ''William J. Donovan and the National Security''], cia.gov; accessed February 27, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; "The Central Intelligence Agency regards Donovan as its founding father," according to journalist [[Evan Thomas]] in a 2011 ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' profile. The [[George Bush Center for Intelligence]], the CIA headquarters building in [[Langley, Virginia]], has a statue of Donovan in the lobby. Thomas observed that Donovan's "exploits are utterly improbable but by now well documented in declassified wartime records that portray a brave, noble, headlong, gleeful, sometimes outrageous pursuit of action and skulduggery."&lt;ref name="Vanity Fair"/&gt;

===William J. Donovan Award===
The William J. Donovan Award was created by the OSS Society, which was founded by Donovan in 1947. The award is presented by the OSS Society to "someone who has exemplified the distinguishing features that characterized General Donovan's lifetime of public service to the United of States of America as a citizen and a soldier". Notable recipients include [[Allen W. Dulles]], President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], [[Margaret Thatcher]] and President [[George H.W. Bush]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=William J.

==Family==
Donovan's son, David Rumsey Donovan, was a naval officer who served with distinction in World War II. His grandson, William James Donovan, served as an enlisted soldier in Vietnam and is also buried at Arlington National Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/wjodonov.htm|title=William J.

===Medal of Honor citation===
Rank and organization: Lieutenant Colonel, U.S. Army, 165th Infantry, 42d Division. Place and date: Near Landres-et-St. Georges, France, 14–15 October 1918. Entered service at: Buffalo, N.Y. Born: 1 January 1883, Buffalo, N.Y. G.O., No.: 56, W.D., 1922.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Lt. Col. Donovan personally led the assaulting wave in an attack upon a very strongly organized position, and when our troops were suffering heavy casualties he encouraged all near him by his example, moving among his men in exposed positions, reorganizing decimated platoons, and accompanying them forward in attacks. When he was wounded in the leg by machine-gun bullets, he refused to be evacuated and continued with his unit until it withdrew to a less exposed position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.army.mil//html/moh/worldwari.html#DONOVAN|title=Medal of Honor Recipients – World War I|author=U.S. Army Center of Military History|work=army.mil}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Yog-Sothoth''' is a [[Cosmicism|cosmic entity]] in the fictional [[Cthulhu Mythos]] and [[Dream Cycle]] of American [[horror literature|horror]] writer [[H. P. Lovecraft]]. Yog-Sothoth's name was first mentioned in Lovecraft's novel ''[[The Case of Charles Dexter Ward]]'' (written [[1927 in literature|1927]], first published [[1941 in literature|1941]]). The being is said to take the form of a conglomeration of glowing [[sphere]]s.

==Mythos==
&lt;blockquote&gt;Imagination called up the shocking form of fabulous Yog-Sothoth—only a congeries of iridescent globes, yet stupendous in its malign suggestiveness.
:—Hazel Heald and H. P. Lovecraft, "[[The Horror in the Museum]]"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yog-Sothoth is [[wikt:coterminous|coterminous]] with ''all'' time and space yet is supposedly locked outside of the universe we inhabit. Its cosmic nature is hinted at in this passage from "[[Through the Gates of the Silver Key]]" ([[1934 in literature|1934]]) by Lovecraft and [[E. Hoffmann Price]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It was an All-in-One and One-in-All of limitless being and self—not merely a thing of one Space-Time continuum, but allied to the ultimate animating essence of existence's whole unbounded sweep—the last, utter sweep which has no confines and which outreaches fancy and mathematics alike. It was perhaps that which certain secret cults of earth have whispered of as YOG-SOTHOTH, and which has been a deity under other names; that which the crustaceans of [[Yuggoth]] worship as the Beyond-One, and which the vaporous brains of the [[spiral nebulae]] know by an untranslatable Sign...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yog-Sothoth sees all and knows all. To "please" this deity could bring knowledge of many things. However, like most beings in the mythos, to see it or learn too much about it is to court disaster. Some authors state that the favor of the god requires a human sacrifice or eternal servitude.

According to the genealogy Lovecraft devised for his characters (later published as "Letter 617" in ''[[Selected Letters of H. P. Lovecraft IV (1932–1934)|Selected Letters]]''), Yog-Sothoth is the offspring of the [[Cthulhu Mythos deities#The Nameless Mist|Nameless Mists]], which were born of the deity [[Azathoth]]. Yog-Sothoth mated with [[Shub-Niggurath]] to produce the twin deities [[List of Great Old Ones#Nug and Yeb|Nug and Yeb]], while Nug sired [[Cthulhu]] through [[parthenogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Selected Letters of H. P. Lovecraft IV (1932–1934)]]|last=Lovecraft|first=H. P.|authorlink=H. P. Lovecraft|year=1967|publisher=[[Arkham House]]|location=[[Sauk City, Wisconsin]]|isbn=0-87054-035-1|nopp=y|page="Letter 617"}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Lovecraft's short story "[[The Dunwich Horror]]", Yog-Sothoth impregnates a mortal woman, [[The Dunwich Horror#Lavinia Whateley|Lavinia Whateley]], who then gives birth to twin sons: the humanoid [[The Dunwich Horror#Wilbur Whateley|Wilbur Whateley]], and his more monstrous unnamed brother.

In the [[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|''Call of Cthulhu'' role-playing game]], Yog-Sothoth is categorized as an [[Outer God]] {{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}. An in-universe essay titled &lt;cite lang="la"&gt;In Rerum Supernatura&lt;/cite&gt; suggests an etymology for the god's common name: "Yog-Sothoth" could be a transliteration of the Arabic phrase "Yaji Ash-Shuthath," more properly "yajī'u ash-shudhdhādh" يجيء الشذاذ, meaning "The abnormal ones are coming."&lt;ref&gt;[[Sandy Petersen|Petersen, Sandy]] and Willis, Lynn (1992). “In Rerum Supernatura”, &lt;cite&gt;Call of Cthulhu&lt;/cite&gt;, 5th ed., Oakland, CA: Chaosium, pp. 189–92. {{ISBN|0-933635-86-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tree of life bahir Hebrew.svg|thumb|right|240px|[[Kenneth Grant]] suggested Lovecraft's description of Yog-Sothoth as a conglomeration of "malignant globes" may have been inspired by the [[Qliphoth|Spheres of the Qliphoth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Harms, Daniel  |author2=Gonce, John Wisdom |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Necronomicon Files|page=109|year=1998|isbn=1578632692|publisher=[[Red Wheel/Weiser/Conari|Red Wheel/Weiser, LLC]]|location=[[York Beach, Maine|York Beach]], [[Maine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In [[Anders Fager]]'s short story "Grandmothers Journey" a tribe of dog or wolf-like humans (analog to the "ghouls" of the Lovecraftian mythos) is said to have sacrificed to Yog-Sothoth to become "different". In Fager's "Herr Goerings Artifact" Yog-Sothoth is invoked to protect a couple of witches from Father [[Dagon]].

At the end of Lovecraft's last story "[[The Haunter of the Dark]]", the protagonist Robert Blake calls on Yog-Sothoth to save him from the eponymous malign entity which he has let loose.

==Through the Gates of the Silver Key==
In [[Through the Gates of the Silver Key|this story]] Randolph Carter actually meets him, "the Gate, the Key and the Guardian". The encounter makes it very clear that it is the point of view which defines the nature of the interaction; there is nothing inherently evil or frightening about him. He opens the gates of the Multiverse to anyone who is willing to glimpse it and unlike the "nameless devourers" he is not going to harm you or force you into what you do not want. He gives Carter the option of leaving or going forward; the price is to see the true or at least partial vastness of what is, a flood of knowledge that overwhelms the current "self".

==The Old Ones==
&lt;blockquote&gt;Yog-Sothoth knows the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the key and guardian of the gate. Past, present, future, all are one in Yog-Sothoth. He knows where the Old Ones broke through of old, and where They shall break through again. He knows where They have trod earth's fields, and where They still tread them, and why no one can behold Them as They tread.
:—H. P. Lovecraft, "[[The Dunwich Horror]]"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yog-Sothoth has some connection to the mysterious [[Great Old Ones|Old Ones]] mentioned in "The Dunwich Horror" ([[1929 in literature|1929]]), but their nature, their number, and their connection to Yog-Sothoth are unknown. Nonetheless, they are probably allied to him in some way, since [[Wilbur Whateley]], the half-human son of Yog-Sothoth, tried to summon them so that they could control Wilbur's more tainted twin and make it reproduce.

In ''The Case of Charles Dexter Ward'', its name is part of an incantation that could revive the dead (and with some of the syllables reversed, slay the creature raised):

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;''Y'AI'NG'NGAH''
''YOG-SOTHOTH''
''H'EE-L'GEB''
''F'AI THRODOG''
''UAAAH''&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This incantation is used in [[Anders Fager]]'s "[[I saw her today at the reception]]" to reanimate a long dead Swedish civil servant.

==Avatars of Yog-Sothoth==

===Aforgomon===
'''Aforgomon''' is an obscure avatar of Yog-Sothoth invented by [[Clark Ashton Smith]]. He was revered by many cultures past, present, and future as the God of Time because of his [[preternatural]] ability to manipulate time and space. Little is known of this being's appearance because he only reveals himself to those who have angered him. However, it is known that he is accompanied by a blinding light. He is the mortal enemy of [[Xexanoth#Xexanoth|Xexanoth]].

===The Lurker at the Threshold===
This is the name given to Yog-Sothoth in [[August Derleth]] and H. P. Lovecraft's novel ''[[The Lurker at the Threshold]]''. In the story, Alijah Billington describes Yog-Sothoth's appearance as

&lt;blockquote&gt;...great globes o light massing toward the opening, and not alone these, but the breaking apart of the nearest globes, and the protoplasmic flesh that flowed blackly outward to join together and form that eldritch, hideous horror from outer space, that spawn of the blankness of primal time, that tentacled amorphous monster which was the lurker at the threshold, whose mask was as a congeries of iridescent globes, the noxious Yog-Sothoth, who froths as primal slime in nuclear chaos beyond the nethermost outposts of space and time!
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==='Umr at-Tawil===
''''Umr at-Tawil''' (Arabic عمر الطويل) ''The [Most Ancient and] Prolonged of Life''), also spelled '''Tawil At-U'mr''' or '''Tawil-at'Umr''',&lt;ref&gt;These 'alternate' spellings are [[solecism]]s.  The [[Arabic language]] definite article ''al'' only takes the [[sun and moon letters|assimilated]] form ''at'' before a word beginning in ''t''.  The form should be ''Tawil al Umr''.  For a similar error see [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''Dar es Balat'' (were it proper Arabic it would be ''Dar el Balat'') which is erroneously formed by analogy from ''Dar es Salaam'' in which the article ''es'' is assimilated to the initial /s/ of ''Salaam''.&lt;/ref&gt; is described as an avatar of Yog-Sothoth in the story "[[Through the Gates of the Silver Key]]", by Lovecraft and E. Hoffman Price. In the story, he presides over the timeless halls beyond the Gate of the Silver Key and the strange, near-omnipotent ''Ancient Ones'' that dwell there. He is described as the silhouette of a man behind a strange, shimmering veil.  He is one of very few apparently benign Lovecraftian Great Old Ones who does not cause insanity in those who view him.

===The Eater of Souls===
In ''[[The Illuminatus! Trilogy]]'' by [[Robert Anton Wilson]] and [[Robert Shea]], Yog-Sothoth is the "Eater of Souls."

&lt;blockquote&gt;"...That the chief of these beings is referred to in the [[Pnakotic Manuscripts]] and the [[Books in the Cthulhu Mythos#Eltdown Shards|Eltdown Shards]] as Iok Sotot, "Eater of Souls," suggests that it was some energy or psychic vibration of the dying victim that the [[Lloigor (Cthulhu Mythos race)|lloigor]] needed... ".&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Robert Anton and Shea, Robert. ''The Eye in the Pyramid'' pp.300-301&lt;/ref&gt;  "...in private, of course, they worshipped Iok-Sotot, who became the Yog-Sothoth of the Necronomicon."&lt;ref&gt;''The Eye in the Pyramid'' p.127&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

This identification is carried forward in [[Grant Morrison]]'s ''[[Zenith (comics)|Zenith]]'' series for ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 A.D.]]''
