'''Alice Diamond''' (22 June 1896 - 1952) was an English career criminal, linked to organised shoplifting.&lt;ref name="McDonald2015"&gt;{{cite book|last=McDonald|first=Brian|title=Alice Diamond and the Forty Elephants: The Female Gang That Terrorised London|date=22 October 2015|publisher=Milo Books|isbn=978-1-908479-84-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Diamond was born '''Alice Elizabeth Black''' in Lambeth Workhouse Hospital to Thomas Diamond and Mary Ann Alice Blake. Her parents had applied for a maternity birth under the name of Black before they married to avoid the stigma of an illegitimate birth. However, as they married shortly before Alice was born, this also avoided the problem.

Alice's father Thomas Diamond had at least three criminal convictions, including one for assaulting the son of the [[Lord Mayor of London]] at a political meeting by punching his head through a pane of glass in a door, severely injuring him. Alice's mother was born Mary Geary and took the name Blake when her parents married. She added Ann and Alice to her name at random times. Alice was the eldest of seven children, a younger sister Louisa also joined the Forty Thieves gang of which Alice Diamond had become leader and given the title Queen of the Forty Thieves and, later, Queen of the [[Forty Elephants]], because of their connection to the streets around the Elephant and Castle district of southeast London. A brother, Tommy, became one of the notorious [[Elephant and Castle]] gang.

==Career==
Alice's criminal career began in 1912 when she was cautioned, along with Mary Austin, who would later marry north London racing gangster Frederick Sabini, for stealing chocolate. A number of convictions for theft followed and in 1915 she was named by police and newspapers as Queen of the Forty Thieves, successor to Mary 'Polly' Carr, who had previously held the title.

Alice had taken over leadership of a large and expert gang of organised shoplifters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3366655/Such-seductive-shoplifters-Stuffing-loot-bloomers-ruthless-girl-gang-spread-havoc-London-flirting-victims-battering-diamond-ring-knuckle-dusters.html|title=Seductive shoplifters: girl gang with diamond-ring knuckle-dusters|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was a skillful organiser of large expeditions across the West End of London and spread her enterprise to the provinces when London became 'hot'. Her chief lieutenant was volatile and violent [[Maggie Hill]], born Margaret Lily Hill into a criminal north London family that one day would produce [[Billy Hill (gangster)|Billy Hill]], dubbed 'Boss of Britain's Underworld'.

Although Alice, Maggie and other Elephants served prison terms, they believed the risk was worth it - the alternative being a life of poverty. The gang was known for its stylish dress and wild partying. They could 'put on the posh' and take goods valued at hundreds of pounds from prestigious stores by using specialist garments and clever distraction techniques. Their favourite plunder was fur coats and bolts of silk which were expensive commodities between the World Wars. They were known to drive fast cars and could be violent when confronted. Alice Diamond was over five-foot eight-inches in height at a time when the average height for a man was five-foot six-inches. She wore diamond rings on the fingers of both hands and could deliver a punch a man would have envied. Another of the Forty Elephants was Lilian Goldstein, née Kendall, who was also a driver for smash and grab raider Ruby Sparks, tagged by press and police as 'The Bobbed-Haired Bandit'.

==Personal life==
Alice never married, but had a relationship with Bert McDonald, one of the leaders of the Elephant Gang. Maggie Hill married long-term criminal Alfred Hughes. Alice Diamond died at 11 Marnock House, [[Southwark]], close to 'East Lane' market, in 1952.

'''Bender Bending Rodríguez''' (designated in-universe as '''Bending Unit 22''', unit number '''1,729''', serial number '''2716057'''&lt;ref name=ramanujan&gt;1,729 is the smallest [[Taxicab number|number that can be represented as the sum of two cubes in two ways]], 1³ + 12³ = 9³ + 10³, serial number 2716057 = (952³ - 951³) [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24459279 Why is the number 1,729 hidden in Futurama episodes?, Simon Singh, BBC News, 15 October 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;) is a fictional character who is one of the main characters in the animated television series ''[[Futurama]]''. He was created by series creators [[Matt Groening]] and [[David X. Cohen]] and is voiced by [[John DiMaggio]]. He fulfills a comic, [[antihero]]-type role in ''Futurama'' and is described by fellow character [[Leela (Futurama)|Leela]] as an "[[Alcoholism|alcoholic]], [[Prostitution|whore]]-mongering, [[Chain smoking|chain-smoking]] gambler".&lt;ref name="COTH"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Crimes of the Hot|episodelink=Crimes of the Hot|series=Futurama |credits=[[Aaron Ehasz|Ehasz, Aaron]]|network=Fox |airdate=November 10, 2002 |season=4 |number=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the character's [[backstory]], Bender was built in Tijuana, Mexico (the other characters refer to his "swarthy [[Latin Americans|Latin]] charm"). Viewers are informed, through his own testimony, of Bender's prejudice against non-[[robot]]s.  For example, one of his signature expressions is "kill all humans". Exceptions who are not subject to Bender's prejudicial attitude are those individuals on his "Do Not Kill" list, which seems to comprise only his best friend [[Philip J. Fry]] and his colleague [[Hermes Conrad]] (Hermes is added after the episode "[[Lethal Inspection]]").&lt;ref name=LethInsp /&gt; However, Bender is also occasionally portrayed as possessing a sympathetic side, suggesting that he is not as belligerent as he claims, a view often echoed by his friends.&lt;ref name=BSNBATV&gt;{{cite episode |title=Bender Should Not Be Allowed on TV|episodelink=Bender Should Not Be Allowed on TV|series=Futurama |credits=[[Lewis Morton|Morton, L.]]|network=Fox |airdate=August 3, 2003 |season=04 |number=06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BWBB&gt;{{cite video | people=[[Peter Avanzino|Avanzino, Peter]] (Director) | date=June 24, 2008 | title=[[Futurama: The Beast with a Billion Backs|The Beast with a Billion Backs]] | medium=DVD | publisher=[[The Curiosity Company]] et al|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character biography==
Bender, a high-tech industrial [[metalworking]] robot, was built in 2996 at Fábrica Robótica De La Madre (Spanish: "Mom's Robot Factory"), a manufacturing facility of [[Mom (Futurama)|Mom's]] Friendly Robot Company in [[Tijuana]], Mexico.&lt;ref name=LethInsp&gt;{{cite episode |title=Lethal Inspection|episodelink=Lethal Inspection|series=Futurama |credits=[[Eric Horsted|Horsted, Eric]]|network=Fox |airdate=July 22, 2010 |season=6 |number=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the story of his construction remains a mystery. Although different creation processes have been shown, Cohen has stated that the viewer has only been shown Bender emerging from the machine that created him, while what happened inside the machine has not yet been revealed. According to one version, suggested by Hermes' flashback,&lt;ref name=LethInsp /&gt; and also by a reverse aging process shown in the episode "[[Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles]]", a newborn Bender possessed a baby-like body. In "[[Bendless Love]]", however, Bender is portrayed with a normal, adult-sized body in a flashback sequence conveying his memory of coming into existence. As Bender's memory contains an adult form, the episode's content suggests that the character might actually be recalling a transfer to an adult body, rather than the moment of creation.&lt;ref name="Cohen03"&gt;{{cite video| people=Cohen, David X |date=2003|title=Futurama'' Season 4 DVD commentary for episode "[[Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles]]"''| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike most other robots, Bender is mortal and, according to [[Professor Farnsworth]]'s calculations, may have less than one billion years to live. Because of a manufacturing error that left Bender without a [[backup]] unit, Bender's memory cannot be transferred or uploaded to another robot body. After reporting that defect to his manufacturer, Bender barely escapes death from a guided missile and a robot [[death squad]] dispatched by [[Mom (Futurama)|Mom]] in order to eliminate him and effectively take the defective product off the market.&lt;ref name=LethInsp /&gt;

At the factory, Bender was programmed for cold-bending [[structural steel]]. Bender later attended Bending State University, where he [[college major|majored]] in bending and [[Minor (academic)|minored]] in Robo-American Studies. At the university, he was a member of Epsilon Rho Rho (ERR), a robot [[college fraternity|fraternity]], where he became something of a fraternity hero for his many shenanigans: one night he chugged an entire keg of [[beer]], [[streaking|streaked]] across campus, and [[Phonebooth stuffing|stuffed]] 58 people into a [[telephone booth]] (although he concedes they were mostly children).

Before meeting [[Philip J. Fry|Fry]] and [[Leela (Futurama)|Leela]] and joining Planet Express (where he currently works as the [[Management|assistant manager]] of sales).&lt;ref name=BBS&gt;{{cite video | people=[[Dwayne Carey-Hill|Carey-Hill, Dwayne]] (Director) | date=November 27, 2007 |location=United States | title=[[Futurama: Bender's Big Score|Bender's Big Score]] | medium=DVD | publisher=[[The Curiosity Company]] et al|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bender had a job at the metalworking factory, bending steel [[girder]]s for the construction of [[suicide booth]]s.

Bender has an apartment in the "Robot Arms Apts." building, where he eventually invites his best friend and coworker, Fry, to live with him. Although the pair enjoy living together, Bender is sometimes portrayed as manipulating his guileless friend. In the series' early episodes, Bender is shown preferring to occupy smaller areas of their apartment, like the closet, referring to them as "cozy", although in later episodes he is shown to have his own individual bedroom, like Fry.

Throughout the series, he enters many romantic relationships of varying duration, and is commonly referred to as a [[Promiscuity#Male promiscuity|womanizer]] by his friends. He does not seem to discriminate between human women and their robot or "fem-bot" counterparts, and is shown actively pursuing both. Likewise, his taste in fem-bot partners does not seem to be affected by the fem-bot's height or weight, and he is shown numerous times chasing fem-bots of all builds. In "[[Proposition Infinity]]", Bender's secret affair with coworker [[Amy Wong]] leads to a [[referendum]] that, once approved, legalizes [[Robot fetishism|robosexuality]]. In "[[The Bots and the Bees]]", he has a sexual encounter with a fem-bot soda vending machine that leads to the almost-instantaneous birth of a son, whom he names Ben, after the first part of his own name.

Bender hates magnets and has a near-pathological fear of electric can openers, as magnets cause him to uncontrollably start singing [[folk music|folk songs]] when near his head; magnets shut off his inhibition, causing him to reveal his secret ambition to be a folk singer. He is once able to attach a magnetic small faux-beard underneath his mouth without breaking into song.

==Character==

===Creation===
The name "Bender" was chosen by series creator Matt Groening in homage to the character John Bender from ''[[The Breakfast Club]]''.&lt;ref name="names"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Robert|last=Schnakenberg|title= Sci-Fi Baby Names: 500 Out-of-this-world Baby Names from Anakin to Zardoz |chapter=Intellectual Names|publisher=Quirk Books|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|date=2007|ISBN=978-1594741616|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bender's visual design went through multiple changes before reaching its final state. One of the decisions which Groening found to be particularly difficult was whether Bender's head should be square or round. Initially he worked under the idea that all robots would have square heads in the year 3000; however, it was later decided that Bender's head should be round, a visual play on the idea that Bender is a "round peg in a square hole".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=James |last= Sterngold|title=Bringing an Alien And a Robot to Life; The Gestation of the Simpsons' Heirs|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/22/arts/bringing-an-alien-and-a-robot-to-life-the-gestation-of-the-simpsons-heirs.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher= The New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=July 22, 1999 |accessdate=July 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voice===
[[File:John DiMaggio 2008.jpg|thumb|250px|right|John DiMaggio at the 2008 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]].]]
When casting for ''Futurama'', Bender's voice was the most difficult to cast, in part because the show's creators had not yet decided what robots should sound like.&lt;ref name="Cohen01"&gt;{{cite video| people=Cohen, David X |date=2003|title=Futurama season 1 DVD commentary for the episode "Space Pilot 3000"| medium=DVD|publisher=[[20th Century Fox]]|location=Los Angeles, California}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, every voice actor who auditioned, no matter for what role, was also asked to read for Bender. After about 300 auditions, even series co-creator Cohen attempted to audition after being told he sounded like a robot.&lt;ref name="Cohen02"&gt;{{cite video| people=Cohen, David X |date=2003|title=Futurama season 1 DVD commentary for the episode "The Series Has Landed"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox|location=Los Angeles, California}}&lt;/ref&gt; John DiMaggio was eventually chosen for the role after his second audition.

DiMaggio originally auditioned using his Bender voice for the role of [[Hubert J. Farnsworth|Professor Farnsworth]] and used a voice later used for [[List of recurring Futurama characters#Officer URL|URL the police robot]] for Bender.&lt;ref name=1ACV01&gt;{{cite video|people=Cohen, David X.; Groening, Matt; Moore, Rich; Vanzo, Gregg; DiMaggio, John|date=2002|title=Futurama: Volume One DVD commentary for the episode "[[Space Pilot 3000]]"|medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox|location=Los Angeles, California|quote='''John DiMaggio:''' Now, that's the first words, but– you know what, I auditioned for the– when I auditioned for this show, I auditioned and I auditioned for the Professor as well. And I used that voice for the professor and I used that voice, and I also used– I also used URL's voice for Bender. So I did a couple of different things.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He describes the voice he got the part with as a combination of a sloppy drunk, [[Slim Pickens]], and a character one of his college friends created named "Charlie the sausage-lover".&lt;ref name="Futurama-rama"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Dave|last=Itzkoff|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/24/futurama-rama-welcome-back-to-the-world-of-tomorrow/| title=‘Futurama’-Rama: Welcome Back to the World of Tomorrow| newspaper= [[The New York Times]]|publisher=The New York Times Company|location=New York City| date=June 24, 2010| accessdate=July 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Casting directors liked that he made the character sound like a drunk, rather than an automaton. DiMaggio has noted that he had difficulty singing as Bender in "[[Hell Is Other Robots]]" because he was forced to sing the harmony part in a low key.&lt;ref name="DiMaggioep9"&gt;{{cite video| people=Dimaggio, John |date=2003|title=Futurama season 1 DVD commentary for the episode "Hell Is Other Robots"| medium=DVD|publisher=[[20th Century Fox]]|location=Los Angeles, California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
Bender's factory-set height is 5 ft. 6 in. (168 cm); 6 ft. (183 cm) including his [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]]. In "[[The Farnsworth Parabox]]", Bender states that he flipped a coin to decide his color, ending up with foghat gray rather than gold. In "[[The Cyber House Rules]]", Bender shows the kids a black-and-white [[mug shot]] of himself taken after his arrest for theft. In "[[Time Keeps on Slippin']]", Bender is shown trying to join a basketball team and makes himself taller by simply extending his legs. His body has a "shiny metal ass", two legs, two "Extens-o-matic" arms with three fingers each, a head with two replaceable eyes shaped like [[light-emitting diode]]s, and a mouth used for fuel intake and voice communication. In "[[Bender Gets Made]]", Bender claims he also has a nose, but he chooses not to wear it. Bender's human-like characteristics are reinforced by his display of behaviors often regarded as exclusive to humans, such as whistling, snoring, having [[bloodshot eyes]], [[crying]], feeling [[physical attraction]], being [[tickling|tickled]], [[dream]]ing, and [[belching]].

Other bending units of the same model as Bender, such as [[Flexo (Futurama)|Flexo]], share the same hardware design, but differ in terms of their personality and behavior. For example, Flexo shows personality traits similar to those of Bender but is not quite as "evil" as Bender. In the episode "[[Mother's Day (Futurama)|Mother's Day]]", Leela looks through a simulation of a bending unit's sight, which targets potential [[wikt:rube|rubes]] and then denotes a plan to rob them and leave them in a ditch, implying that all bending robots are somewhat prone to theft and amoral by design. However, another unit, Billy West (named after the series voice actor of the same name), is helpful and kind, though he lives as a farmer on the Moon and insists on not being a bending unit.&lt;ref name="TSC"&gt;{{cite episode |title=The Silence of the Clamps| episodelink=The Silence of the Clamps| series= Futurama |credits=Rogers, Eric|network=Fox |airdate=July 14, 2011|season=6 |number=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bender's [[serial number]], 2716057, can be expressed as the sum of two cubes, which is humorous to Bender and Flexo after Flexo reveals that his serial number has the same characteristic (also, Bender’s designation 1729 is a [[taxicab number]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bbrp.atwebpages.com/mathematics.html|title=Maths in ''Futurama''|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614030601/http://bbrp.atwebpages.com/mathematics.html |archive-date=June 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Functions===
Bender was designed specifically for the relatively simple task of bending straight metal girders into various angles. Despite this apparent simplicity, he possesses numerous features superfluous to his original purpose, which become more apparent after an electric jolt to his antenna from an overhead light socket in the pilot episode. The scope of Bender's functionality is impressive; he often acts as if he were a multifunctional [[gadget]] rather than a special bending machine. Similar to a contemporary computer, he hosts a number of input/output devices: his head has a data socket and remotely operated volume control.&lt;ref name="APTR"&gt;{{cite episode |title=A Pharaoh to Remember|episodelink=A Pharaoh to Remember|series=Futurama |credits=[[Ron Weiner|Weiner, Ron]]|network=Fox |airdate=March 10, 2002 |season=4 |number=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; His body has a socket for a microphone jack, a dual-socket [[Electric receptacle|power receptacle]],&lt;ref name=BSNBATV /&gt; a [[reset button]],&lt;ref&gt;Bender pushes a button on his body to erase everything he knows about cooking before his first cooking lesson in "[[The 30% Iron Chef]]".&lt;/ref&gt; a [[kill switch]],&lt;ref name=BWBB /&gt; and a self-destruct button. Having the hardware-based self-destruct control on his body, rather than in his software, prevents Bender from committing suicide in "[[A Head in the Polls]]" when he pawns everything but his head, grows desperate without it and desires to kill himself.

Bender is capable of disassembling and reassembling his body at will and operating each detached body part individually and remotely, presumably by using his transmitter and antenna to send wireless signals. His head can be used for a wide range of functions, whether attached to his body or not. In one episode, Leela reassembles Bender into a functioning [[go-kart]].

Bender uses his chest cavity as a [[Locker (cabinet)|locker]], which seems to [[magic satchel|store much more than is physically possible]]; it is often used to store heads in jars, small children, [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], [[money]], loot, the world's last [[darkroom]], and, on a few occasions, Fry. In "[[The Route of All Evil]]", the cavity was also used as a boil kettle, [[Brewing#Hopback|hopback]] and [[fermentation (food)|fermentation tank]] to produce home-made beer. Upon inspection of his body, it appears to be empty, though devices like the F-Ray reveal that, despite appearing hollow, Bender's body contains gears and other robotic components.

Being an electronic machine, he can perform quick mathematical calculations, but admits to being a poor calculator.

===Build===
As a bending unit, Bender possesses extraordinary strength, which he often demonstrates by lifting heavy objects, smashing through walls, and even bending an enormous steel girder marked "UNBENDABLE" (in "[[Bendless Love]]"). His mechanical nature also makes him far more durable than the rest of the cast, capable of surviving gunfire, explosions, extreme heat, deep water, or [[vacuum|hard vacuum]].

Even when his body is seemingly destroyed or completely detached from his head, it has no effect on Bender's ability to think and communicate, indicating that his main processing facilities are located in his head.&lt;ref&gt;Indirect evidence suggesting that the Bender's [[computer]] is in fact located in his head is provided in several episodes. In "[[Fry and the Slurm Factory]]" the F-ray exam shows that Bender's head contains a device clearly marked "6502" (a designation for [[MOS Technology 6502]], an eight-bit microprocessor used in the [[Apple I|original Apple Computer]]). In "[[Roswell that Ends Well]]", Fry's grandfather reaches deep inside Bender's head and retrieves a handful of [[circuit board]]s and [[Integrated circuit|microchip]]s, to which Bender protests by exclaiming, "Hey, that's my brain!".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Truth About Bender's Brain|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/semiconductors/processors/the-truth-about-benders-brain|work=IEEE Spectrum|publisher=IEEE|accessdate=29 July 2012|first= David X. | last= Cohen|date=May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bender's hardware is controlled by a factory-loaded [[operating system]], which reboots upon incidental shutdown and automatically adjusts its settings to the environment detected at the time of rebooting. For example, in "[[The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz]]", when Bender reboots, his visual sensors detect a colony of penguins, prompting his  [[booting|boot loader]] to re-initialize him with penguin-like behavior and language.

He is equipped with a vast capacity of [[computer data storage]], in excess of 100,001 [[terabyte]]s- 1 TB for general storage and 100,000 TB for the storage of pornography, though in 6ACV25 Cubert Farnsworth deletes 12 TB of outdated catchphrases from Bender. Presumably either Bender has a separate "catchphrase drive" or the majority of the catchphrases are also pornographic.&lt;ref&gt;In Season 7, Episode 17 "Forty Percent Leadbelly", it is shown that Bender has a 1 [[terabyte]] "Main Drive", and a 100,000 [[terabyte]] "Porn Drive".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Source of energy===
Bender is powered by [[alcohol]]-based fuels, which he can convert into an electrical power source sufficient to operate not only himself, but also small household appliances plugged into his [[power receptacle]].&lt;ref&gt;In the episode "[[Bender Should Not Be Allowed on TV]]", Bender serves as a power supply for a small television set, which is plugged into a receptacle located on the underside of Bender's body.&lt;/ref&gt; Low alcohol intake levels decrease his production of electricity: when he stops drinking and begins to "sober", his behavior grows increasingly ebrious and dysfunctional, and he grows a red beard of [[rust]].&lt;ref name="IR"&gt;{{cite episode |title=I, Roommate|episodelink=I, Roommate| series= Futurama |credits=[[Eric Horsted|Horsted, E]]|network=Fox |airdate=1999-04-06 |season=1 |number=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also, apparently, able to sustain himself by consuming mineral oil, though he considers this to be only 'functional'.

Due to [[Professor Farnsworth]]'s flawed design, the energy conversion process inside Bender's body produces an inordinate amount of waste gases and heat. He can expel these products from his rear end&lt;ref name="COTH" /&gt; or, more often, as a flaming [[belch]].

He also has a [[nuclear pile]] inside his body, as seen in "[[Godfellas]]". However its location and purpose are not clear.

==Personality==
Bender often exhibits [[Antisocial personality disorder|sociopathic]] behavior; he is a [[pathological liar]] and rarely shows any [[empathy]] (his most frequent catchphrase to any bothersome person is "Bite my shiny metal ass!"). He has a mostly voluntary morality and [[Kleptomania|constantly steals]], ranging from the petty theft of wallets to  crimes such as [[kidnapping]] [[Jay Leno]]'s head and stealing Fry's blood and kidney. He also once stole Amy's earrings while giving her a hug. It was shown in "[[Roswell That Ends Well]]" that even in a disassembled state, his individual limbs carry on attempting to steal anything in proximity; the hand on his dismembered arm steals a wallet out of a scientist's pocket before becoming inactive again.

He is shown throughout the series as having a secret desire to be a [[folk musician]] that only manifests itself when a magnet is placed on or near his head. This desire is finally fulfilled in the episode "[[Bendin' in the Wind]]": an accident involving a giant [[can opener]] leaves him with a mutilated chest and paralyzed from the neck down. An encounter with [[Beck]] during his hospitalization leads to his becoming lead washboard player and the two teaming up for a musical tour that turns Bender into a [[folk hero]] for other broken robots, only for his career to end when he finally recovers.

He is also fascinated with cooking, being the chef of the ''[[Planet Express Ship]]'', though he is shown to have no sense of actual [[taste]]. In fact, his early dinners were so horrible that even the omnivorous Zoidberg could not eat it. In his first attempt, he creates a dinner for the crew that is so over-salted they all gag (which is aggravated further when their drinks turn out to be [[saline water|"salt with water in them"]]); he then remarks that the food was fine since the salt content was 10% below a lethal dose. In "[[The Problem with Popplers]]", he creates dinner consisting of nothing but [[caper]]s and [[Sodium bicarbonate|baking soda]], and mistakenly expresses his belief that humans eat rocks. He seems to improve his cooking skills over the series, cooking a lavish cake for [[Nibbler (Futurama)|Nibbler]]'s birthday party and beating [[Elzar]] for the title of [[Iron Chef|Iron Cook]] (though he uses a potion called "The Essence of Pure Flavor", which consists of water and a generous portion of [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] to make the judges hallucinate that his food tastes good). In ''[[Into the Wild Green Yonder]]'', he mistakenly bakes prison guards a cake with [[nutmeg]] thinking it was a natural human [[sleep drug]], before being corrected by Amy that nutmeg is in fact a baking ingredient.

As a robot, he possesses an incredible amount of patience. In "Roswell That Ends Well", he is shown to wait over a thousand years in sand after his head is lost during a trip back in time to 1947, as well as many thousands of years in subterranean caverns under New New York City (although on this occasion he was also in the presence of multiple alternate versions of himself that had previously made the same 'trip'). Despite the long wait, it is implied that Bender does not power down, apparently enjoying his own company so much that he does not consider it necessary. However, in one episode, he shows next to no patience as a one-time joke.

Although the consumption of alcohol is necessitated by Bender's design and should not be generally viewed as a vice for alcohol-fueled robots, he apparently drinks far more than he needs for energy. His excessive drinking contributes to his characterization as an alcoholic ("Hell Is Other Robots" reveals that robots can function equally well on mineral oil instead of alcohol, also contributing to the perception of Bender's alcohol use as a vice). If he is deprived of alcohol, for instance during periods of [[Depression (mood)|depression]], he ceases to function properly and shows signs similar to human [[drunkenness]], including developing a rusty [[five o'clock shadow]]. As noted above, his disembodied head has survived for millennia with, presumably, no source of alcohol, so it may be that, when a mere head, Bender neither requires alcohol nor suffers from its absence.

When he is sufficiently frightened or sickened, [[brick]]s fall from his backside (a reference to the slang "shitting bricks").&lt;ref name=BWBB /&gt; When sufficiently fascinated by something, he may pull out a camera and snap a picture, adding the [[catchphrase]] "Neat!". He has also been shown to be able to use his eyes as cameras. In addition to drinking, he also has an affinity for cigars, which he ignites with a [[lighter]] built into his finger, although in "[[Decision 3012]]" he uses a [[Zippo]]. Unlike drinking alcohol for fuel, Bender tells Fry that he smokes cigars simply because they "make [him] look cool".

Despite being a robot, he has been seen to show emotion on many occasions, going so far as to shed a tear in "[[Crimes of the Hot]]", to Fry's astonishment. One of the series' [[running joke]]s revolves around Bender having emotions, when technically he should be an unfeeling machine. Bender is seemingly unaware of his emotions, stating in the episode "Anthology of Interest II" "I mean, being a robot's great but we don't have emotions and sometimes that makes me very sad".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Futurama Episode 403 "Anthology of Interest II"|url=http://www.imsdb.com/transcripts/Futurama-Anthology-Of-Interest-II.html|work=The Internet Movie Script Database| publisher= IMSDb|accessdate=29 July 2012|author=Lewis Morton |author2=David X. Cohen |author3=Jason Gorbett |author4=Scott Kirby}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his very first appearance, he tries to commit suicide via a suicide booth out of guilt for having unknowingly contributed to their creation. He has also been known to be nonchalant to the point of appearing both uncaring and incredibly brave, even in life-threatening situations.

Bender is a classic [[narcissist]]. He considers himself flawless, a "towering inferno of physical perfection",&lt;ref name=LethInsp /&gt; and refers to himself in both the first and third person. In "[[The Farnsworth Parabox]]" Bender seemingly falls in love with an alternate [[gold plating|gold-plated]] version of himself, stating that he has finally found someone "as great as me". Even his personal email address, &lt;nowiki&gt;bender@ilovebender.com&lt;/nowiki&gt;,&lt;ref name=BBS /&gt; reflects his self-absorbed nature.

Despite these human characteristics, he has no verifiable [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], as seen in "[[Obsoletely Fabulous]]" when he passes through a "soul detector" without setting off the alarm. However, in "[[Ghost in the Machines]]", Bender becomes a ghost who can't interact with people directly but can possess machinery: he uses this ability to "scare Fry to death". He eventually  makes a deal with the Robot Devil to get a new body. (Though never addressed in-universe, this seeming contradiction, as noted by the Robot Devil himself, may result from the distinction that Bender's "spirit" exists in a universal wireless network that allows him to travel in the physical world while trapped in a [[Limbo]]-like loop. The conclusion that his ghost is an incorporeal program rather than a soul is further supported by the fact that the "spirits" in "[[The Honking]]" are actually holograms of deleted computer folders.){{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

His relationships with the rest of the crew of Planet Express vary over time, although he treats nearly all biological organisms with disdain. The only one of his friends who he has openly shown affection for is Fry, his best friend and roommate. "Of all the friends I've had, [he is] the first." Although he is verbally and physically abusive towards Fry and considers him to be vastly inferior to him, he has been shown to care for him a great deal. In "[[Jurassic Bark]]" he states that he loves Fry "the way a human loves a dog", and in "[[I Second That Emotion (Futurama episode)|I Second That Emotion]]" when Bender gets jealous of Nibbler and flushes him down the toilet, a distraught Leela asks how he would feel if she did the same to Fry, describing Fry as Bender's pet (Bender responds with an apathetic "Only one way to find out."). He routinely takes advantage of his friends, including framing them for crimes, robbing them, stealing Fry's [[blood]] on more than one occasion, stealing Fry's [[power of attorney]], using Fry's body to smash open a window, taking Fry's kidney and trying to sell it (it eventually gets eaten by Leela), and stealing jewelry from Amy. He is prone to using Zoidberg in various get-rich-quick schemes, although it is probable he does not consider Dr. Zoidberg a friend, since in "[[Obsoletely Fabulous]]" Bender begged the 1X Robot to "save (his) friends, and Zoidberg" (Though it is seen that he helps Zoidberg from time to time, as seen in "[[That's Lobstertainment!]]"). He even betrays Leela to [[Zapp Brannigan]] in ''Into the Wild Green Yonder'' when she becomes a wanted criminal, out of jealousy of her steadily growing [[rap sheet]], only to break her out of prison again to ensure his own sheet remains lengthier. Although he regularly frustrates the crew, they have demonstrated a certain affection for him in return. During "[[How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back]]", the entire crew traveled to the Central Bureaucracy to recover his brain after Morgan Proctor burned it onto a floppy disk and sent it away. [[Hermes Conrad]] subsequently risks his bureaucratic license to locate the disc with Bender's brain on it by sorting the entire pile in just under four minutes. In the same episode, when Amy asked why they had to fix him, after being met with a brief period of uncertain silence, Leela responded with "Those arguments aside, we're still going." Amy and Bender date for a time in "[[Proposition Infinity]]"; the relationship becomes so serious that Bender proposes to Amy and participates in a campaign to legalize human/robot marriage, although the relationship ends after he realizes that such marriage rights would necessitate monogamy.

Despite his often immoral attitude, he does not lack a soft side; he can feel guilt and remorse over his actions if he goes too far (even by his own standards), indicating that he is not as selfish or unkind as he appears to be. In "Bendless Love", Bender intends to murder Flexo in order to gain the love of fem-bot Angelyne, but when Flexo gets stuck under a gigantic steel girder, Angelyne shows sorrow for him. Bender decides that her happiness is more important than his own, and ends up saving Flexo. Also, in "Jurassic Bark", when Bender becomes jealous of Fry's petrified dog, Seymour, he decides to throw him in magma. But when he realizes how Fry becomes deeply hurt, Bender apologizes for his behavior and rescues the dog. In "Godfellas", he becomes the god of a microscopic alien race and abuses this position by commanding them to produce beer for him. When his abuse of power causes the entire species' demise, however, he cries in mourning and remorse.

==Reception and cultural influence==
In 2008, Bender took second place behind [[Terminator (character)|the Terminator]] in a poll for the "Baddest Movie Robot" on [[Techradar.com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.techradar.com/news/world-of-tech/baddest-movie-robot-the-votes-are-in--389842| title=Baddest movie robot: the votes are in!| author= TechRadar staff| publisher= [[Techradar.com]]| date=June 10, 2008| accessdate=June 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song "Bend It Like Bender!" from the [[Devin Townsend|Devin Townsend Project]] album ''[[Addicted (The Devin Townsend Project album)|Addicted]]'', is a direct reference to Bender and contains the quote "Game's over, losers!  I have all the money!"

===Appearances in other media===
Being the show's [[breakout character]], Bender has made several cameos in different episodes of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', another series by [[Matt Groening]]. Within ''The Simpsons'', Bender has appeared in episodes "[[Future-Drama]]", "[[Bart vs. Lisa vs. the Third Grade]]", "[[Missionary: Impossible]]" and "[[Replaceable You]]". Bender has also makes a cameo appearance in Matt Groening's latest series ''[[Disenchantment]]'', in the episode "[[Disenchantment (TV series)|Dreamland Falls]]".

In the ''Simpsons''-''Futurama'' crossover episode "[[Simpsorama]]", Bender travels back in time in the 31st century to Springfield to kill [[Homer Simpson]], whose DNA is tied to the creatures rampaging in the 31st century. Bender ends up befriending Homer before learning that the creatures are in fact [[Bart Simpson|Bart]]'s genetic offspring. Once the crisis is averted, Bender goes into shutdown mode in the Simpsons' basement. Bender was still resting inert in the Simpsons' basement as of 2015 episode "[[Cue Detective]]" in which his empty body cavity was used to store the family's cash nest-egg. Bender also makes a background cameo appearance in the ''Simpsons'' episode "[[My Fare Lady]]", holding a shovel and bucket at the end of Homer's dream about ''[[The Jetsons]]''.

Bender, along with [[Professor Farnsworth]] and [[Fry (Futurama)|Fry]], appear in the season finale of ''Disenchantment'' as a hologram from a crystal ball, within the one-way time machine from the ''Futurama'' episode "[[The Late Philip J. Fry]]".

He also appears as one of the enemies, along with [[Doctor Zoidberg]], in ''[[The Simpsons Game]]''.

Bender makes cameo appearances in several ''[[Family Guy]]'' episodes. In "[[Blue Harvest]]" he can be seen at the [[Mos Eisley]] cantina, and in "[[The Splendid Source]]", he is one of the repeaters of a dirty joke whose original author [[Peter Griffin]], [[Joe Swanson]], and [[Glenn Quagmire]] are seeking. In the episode "[[Boopa-dee Bappa-dee]]", Peter attempts to use the guide on the television remote, turning [[Stewie Griffin]] into a host of past and present Animation Domination characters, including Bender.

A {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}} concrete bust of [[President of the Philippines]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]] was built in [[Pugo, La Union]]. The monument was destroyed in December 2002.

==Bust==
The bust bore the likeness of [[Ferdinand Marcos]], President of the Philippines from 1965 to 1986. The inside of the bust was hollow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Philippines blast wrecks Marcos bust|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2612709.stm|accessdate=27 February 2015|publisher=BBC News|date=29 December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bust measured {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}} high and was made of concrete.&lt;ref name=blasted/&gt;&lt;ref name="not keen"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Arzadon|first1=Cristina|title=Marcos family not keen on busted bust's repair|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=V1U1AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fCUMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1297%2C20125827|accessdate=27 February 2015|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=18 January 2003|location=Laoag}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Around 1978, the bust's construction began along Marcos Highway, which was later officially renamed [[Aspiras–Palispis Highway]]. The bust was constructed by the Philippine Tourism Authority and was meant to be the centerpiece of Marcos Park. The bust was positioned near the peak of Mt. Shontoug so it could be seen by Baguio-bound motorists as far as {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}} away from the monument. Father and son, Anselmo Dayag Sr. and Anselmo Jr. were chosen to design the bust but the former died due to disease. Scaffolding covered with plywood was reportedly erected to deliberately hide the bust's construction from the public. A typhoon later blew the scaffolding away, exposing the bust. The [[Ibaloi people|Ibaloi]] were said to have been displaced due to the bust's construction. It was reported that they were forced to sell their lands for outrageously low prices. The bust was completed around 1980.&lt;ref name=blasted/&gt;&lt;ref name="not keen"/&gt;&lt;ref name=rebuilding&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cabreza|first1=Vincent|title=Rebuilding a monument for ‘Marcos the Man,’ not the late dictator|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/62241/rebuilding-a-monument-for-%E2%80%98marcos-the-man%E2%80%99-not-the-late-dictator|accessdate=27 February 2015|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ozymandias&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cimatu|first1=Frank|last2=Santos-Doctor|first2=Joya|title=Philippines' 'Ozymandias' still haunts|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RlU1AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fCUMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=698%2C14327047|accessdate=27 February 2015|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=1 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[People Power Revolution]] of 1986, the Ibaloi slaughtered a pig and carabao and poured the animals' blood into the bust to "exorcise" it and later filed a case to reclaim their land.&lt;ref name=blasted/&gt;

The bust was bombed in 1989 by leftist rebels and sustained cracks and other minor damage.&lt;ref name=blasted/&gt;&lt;ref name=ozymandias/&gt;

The bust was subjected to controversy and was viewed as [[Cult of personality|self-glorification]], especially by critics of the Marcos administration. The Ibalois viewed it as a symbol of their mistrust for government authorities since the construction of the bust displaced them from their lands. [[Communist rebellion in the Philippines|Communist insurgents]] also criticized the bust's construction, and many groups planned to destroy the bust.&lt;ref name=blasted/&gt;

===Destruction===
The bust was destroyed using dynamite before dawn on December 29, 2002 by suspected treasure hunters who thought that the bust contained parts of the rumored [[Yamashita's gold|Yamashita treasure]]. Benguet Governor Raul Mencio Molintas said that the police learned that a white Toyota FX van was around the area prior to the incident. It was initially thought that the [[New People's Army]] was behind the bombing of the monument.&lt;ref name=blasted&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dumlao|first1=Artemio|title=Marcos bust blasted|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/189715/marcos-bust-blasted|accessdate=27 February 2015|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=30 December 2002|location=Pugo, La Union}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="not keen"/&gt; The rebel group's Chadli Molintas Command claimed responsibility for the incident in a press release a day later. The communists said that the bust's mere existence "is a mockery of justice and a betrayal of the will of the people. ... Let the ruins be an ugly reminder that the Marcoses have yet to pay for their crimes."&lt;ref name=ozymandias/&gt;&lt;ref name=archbishop&gt;{{cite news|title=Archbishop decries Marcos bust bombing, Communists take credit|url=http://www.ucanews.com/story-archive/?post_name=/2002/12/31/archbishop-decries-marcos-bust-bombing-communists-take-credit&amp;post_id=21815|accessdate=27 February 2015|publisher=UCA News|date=31 December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics of Marcos criticized the destruction of the monument. Archbishop Oscar Cruz of Lingayen-Dagupan said that the perpetrators "should have never destroyed the monument to evil in this country", describing the bust as "a monument to evil, warning people never to become what this man was".&lt;ref name=archbishop/&gt;

==Rehabilitation==
In 2003, [[Baguio]] city mayor Ramon Labo Jr. made an offer to the Marcos family to restore the bust. [[Imelda Marcos]], the wife of Ferdinand Marcos (who died in exile in 1989), took the offer as a "kind gesture" but said that efforts to fix the monument should be a "collective decision of the Marcoses and their supporters". [[Ferdinand Marcos Jr.]], the son of the former president, said that restoring the bust was never a subject of discussion among the family.&lt;ref name="not keen"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5262">[[File:CarlPettersson.jpg|thumb|Pettersson c. 1890]]
'''Carl Emil Pettersson''' (4 or 23 October, 1875 – 12 May 1937) was a Swedish sailor who became king of [[Tabar Island]] in [[Papua New Guinea]] after he was shipwrecked in 1904.

== Biography ==
Pettersson was one of the six children of Carl Wilhelm and Johanna Pettersson. His father left the family, and Carl went to sea around 1892, at about the age of 17.  Later, around 1898, he ended up in the [[Bismarck Archipelago]] of [[German New Guinea]], where he worked for the German trading house, Neuguinea-Compagnie, headquartered in [[Kokopo]]. 

On a recruiting trip in the Pacific, Pettersson's vessel, the ''Herzog Johan Albrecht'' (''Duke Johan Albrecht'') sank on Christmas Day 1904, off Tabar Island in [[New Ireland Province]]. He was washed ashore near a village and landed in a hibiscus hedge, where he was immediately surrounded by islanders. Cannibalism was not uncommon in those times and although Pettersson was uncommonly strong, he would not have been a match for them. The islanders carried him to their king, and the king's daughter fell in love with him. In 1907 he married Princess Singdo, the daughter of the local king, Lamy. He got a start in the [[copra]] trade and managed to create his own coconut plantation that he called Teripax. He became king after the death of his father in law. His nickname among the locals was "Strong Charley", and he was indeed famed for his physical strength. Swedish newspapers printed a series of stories about Pettersson and his adventures.&lt;ref name=weidermann&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/buecher/pippi-langstrumpfs-vater-knallkuss-aus-einer-fernen-welt-1163570.html|title=Pippi Langstrumpfs Vater: Knallkuß aus einer fernen Welt|last=Weidermann|first=Volker|date=16 May 2004|work=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]|language=German|accessdate=22 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later life ==
Business went well and he increased his estate with two plantations, first Maragon on [[Simberi Island]] and later Londolovit on [[Lihir Group]] islands. Pettersson was respectful of local customs and showed concern for his employees, which was unusual at the time. He was therefore very popular with the locals. His marriage with Singdo produced a family of nine children, one of whom died in infancy. His wife died in 1921 of [[puerperal fever]].

In 1922, Pettersson travelled to Sweden, partly to look for a new wife who could look after his children. There, he also visited his old friend Birger Mörner whom he had met in the South Pacific. He then met Anglo-Swedish Jessie Louisa Simpson; together they returned to Tabar Island, where they married in 1923. In Petterson's absence the plantation had declined, and he was now close to bankruptcy. Additionally, he and his wife both suffered from malaria. He painstakingly rebuilt his plantation, but bad investments and the failing market conditions made it difficult to recover.

Pettersson did however find a gold deposit on Simberi Island which he kept secret for years. Even today, the Tabar Group of islands has one of the world's largest gold deposits. His fortunes changed, however, and Pettersson decided to leave the island. His wife Jessie traveled ahead to Australia for medical treatment and then returned to Sweden. She died in Stockholm from malaria and cancer on 19 May 1935. Petterson's health also deteriorated.

Pettersson left Tabar in 1935 but never returned to Sweden. He died of a heart attack in Sydney on 12 May 1937.

==In popular culture==
Carl Pettersson is regarded as the inspiration for Ephraim Longstocking, Pippi's father in [[Astrid Lindgren]]'s children's series, [[Pippi Longstocking]].
In 2012, film writer Jorn Rossing Jensen reported that Swedish producer Mirijam Johansson, of Sweden's Wanted Pictures, announced at Cannes that she had acquired the rights to ''Efraim Longstocking and the Cannibal Princess'', a film based on a screenplay by Daniel Fridell and Ulf Stark and approved by Saltkråkan, the latter of which holds Lindgren's rights.&lt;ref name="Jensen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cineuropa.org/nw.aspx?t=newsdetail&amp;l=en&amp;did=221144|title=Sweden goes back to roots of Lindgren's Pippi Longstocking|last=Jensen|first=Jorn|date=21 May 2012|publisher=Cineuropa|accessdate=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Claude Jutra''' ({{IPA-fr|klod ʒytʁa}}; March 11, 1930 – November 5, 1986) was a [[French Canadian]] actor, film director and writer.&lt;ref name=canenc&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/claude-jutra/ "Claude Jutra"] at [[The Canadian Encyclopedia]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Prix Jutra]], and the [[Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television]]'s [[Claude Jutra Award]], were named in his honor because of his importance in [[Cinema of Quebec|Quebec cinema history]].&lt;ref name="readability.com"&gt;[http://www.ottawacitizen.com/entertainment/quebec+culture+minister+asks+film+industry+yank+jutras/11725149/story.html "Claude Jutra's name to be pulled from Quebec film awards"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160301100814/http://www.ottawacitizen.com/entertainment/quebec%2Bculture%2Bminister%2Basks%2Bfilm%2Bindustry%2Byank%2Bjutras/11725149/story.html |date=March 1, 2016 }}. ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', February 16, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The awards were renamed in 2016 following the publication of allegations that he had sexually abused children during his lifetime, as were streets named for him.&lt;ref name="montreal.ctvnews.ca"&gt;[http://montreal.ctvnews.ca/mobile/quebec-cinema-will-rename-jutra-awards-cities-renaming-streets-1.2781264 "Quebec Cinema will rename Jutra awards; cities renaming streets"]. [[CFCF-DT|CTV Montreal]], February 17, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Jutra was born and raised in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]] as '''Claude Jutras'''.&lt;ref name=canenc /&gt; His father, Albert Jutras, was a [[radiologist]] and a director of the [[Collège des médecins du Québec]].&lt;ref name=canenc /&gt; He made the short films ''Dément du lac Jean-Jeunes'' and ''[[Perpetual Movement]] (Mouvement perpétuel)'' before graduating from the [[Université de Montréal]] with a degree in medicine,&lt;ref name=canenc /&gt; but turned to filmmaking instead of medical practice after completing his degree.&lt;ref name=canenc /&gt; He studied theatre in Montréal (1952–53) and wrote his first original Quebec television play (''L'Ecole de la peur'') in 1953, and a television series, ''Images en boite'', in 1954.

He went to work at the [[National Film Board of Canada]] in 1956 where he trained in all facets of filmmaking, although his first film for the NFB, ''Trio-Brio'', was permanently lost when the organization moved its head office from Ottawa to Montreal.&lt;ref name=canenc /&gt; As a filmmaker, he dropped the s from his surname, a common Québécois surname, because the Jutra spelling was more distinctive. In 1958 he went to [[France]] and [[Africa]] to work with noted French filmmaker, [[Jean Rouch]].&lt;ref name=canenc /&gt;

Claude Jutra's career in film, in a certain sense, paralleled Quebec cinema itself. Beginning as an amateur at a time when there was no Quebec cinema, he participated in (and sometime led) several of the principal developments in Quebec: traditional documentaries and docudramas at the NFB; the germinal period of [[direct cinema]]; the first steps in the early 1960s toward independent film production; and later trend toward large-budget features, such as ''[[Kamouraska (film)|Kamouraska]]'', a box office failure now revealed to be a major work in the canon of Canadian cinema. Overall, his work had a consistent thematic pattern: young people and the (often traumatic) passage from innocence to knowledge, a theme that has nostalgic overtones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morris|first1=Peter|title=The Film Companion|date=1984|publisher=Irwin Publishing|location=Toronto|isbn=0 7725 1505 0|pages=159–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Knelman|first1=Martin|title=Claude Jutra in Exile|journal=Saturday Night|date=1977|volume=92|issue=2|pages=40–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pevere|first1=Geoff|title=The Best Filmmaker Quebec Never Had|publisher=The Globe and Mail|date=May 24, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With financing and production provided by the NFB, Jutra co-wrote and directed the 1971 film ''[[Mon oncle Antoine]]'', which until very recently has consistently been ranked as the best Canadian movie ever made. As well as directing several [[cinema vérité]] shorts such as ''[[Wrestling (1961 film)|Wrestling]]'' and ''[[The Devil's Toy]]'', he also co-directed with [[Norman McLaren]] and starred in the innovative [[pixilation]] [[Academy Award]]-nominated short, ''[[A Chairy Tale]]''.

He was offered the [[Order of Canada]] in 1972 but declined because he was a [[Quebec sovereignty movement|Quebec separatist]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/jutra-pedophile-allegations-rock-quebec-film-industry/article28777548/ "Jutra pedophile allegations rock Quebec film industry"]. ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', February 15, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, he was awarded the [[Prix Albert-Tessier]], given to individuals for an outstanding career in Québec cinema.

==Death==
Jutra was diagnosed with [[early-onset Alzheimer's disease]] in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name=corpse&gt;"Corpse found in river is Jutra's, note says". ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', April 23, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; He was reported missing on November 5, 1986.&lt;ref&gt;"Film maker missing for 2 months: Police to circulate photo of Jutra". ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', January 10, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; His body was found in the [[St. Lawrence River]] in April 1987, with a note in his pocket reading "Je m'appelle Claude Jutra" ("My name is Claude Jutra");&lt;ref name=corpse/&gt; an autopsy later confirmed [[drowning]] as his cause of death.&lt;ref name=corpse/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/claude-jutras-body-found-in-river "Claude Jutra’s body found in river"]. CBC Digital Archives. Retrieved August 12, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
In 2016, thirty years after Jutra's death, journalist Yves Lever wrote in the book ''Claude Jutra, biographie'' and claimed that Jutra was a [[pederasty|pederast]].&lt;ref name="Jutra et les garçons - La Presse"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Jutra et les garçons|url = http://plus.lapresse.ca/screens/7e200abc-a223-48d8-8d26-dfba4e526855%257C_0.html|publisher = ''[[La Presse (Canadian newspaper)|La Presse]]''|date=February 13, 2016|accessdate = February 14, 2016|language = fr-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lever said that "one of Jutra's victims was under 14 years old."&lt;ref name="Jutra et les garçons - La Presse"/&gt; He also maintained that Jutra's proclivities were known by many people in the industry, "but nobody made a big deal out of it."&lt;ref name="Jutra et les garçons - La Presse"/&gt; Lever's allegations were not officially proven, as no victims publicly came forward; however, in the wake of the allegations, Québec Cinéma held an emergency meeting to discuss changing the name of the Prix Jutra.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/claude-jutras-awards-show-name-1.3449881 "Claude Jutra sex allegations shake Quebec film industry"]. [[CBC News]], February 16, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 17, 2016 ''[[La Presse (Canadian newspaper)|La Presse]]'' published an interview with an alleged victim of Jutra, who requested to remain anonymous, relating sexual contact ranging from embrace to oral sex from the time the victim was 6 to 16.&lt;ref&gt;Pilon-Larose, Hugo. "[http://www.lapresse.ca/cinema/cinema-quebecois/201602/16/01-4951514-une-victime-de-claude-jutra-temoigne-des-attouchements-des-6-ans.php "Une victime de Claude Jutra témoigne: des attouchements dès 6 ans"]. ''[[La Presse (Canadian newspaper)|La Presse]]'', February 17, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day and based on the information in the same article, the [[Ministry of Culture and Communications (Quebec)|Minister of Culture of Quebec]], [[Hélène David]], asked Cinéma Québec to remove the name Jutra from its prizes recognizing cinematic achievements in Quebec, which they did.&lt;ref name="readability.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name=heldavrc&gt;[http://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelles/arts_et_spectacles/2016/02/17/001-helene-david-claude-jutra-gala-trophee-pedophilie.shtml "La ministre David demande à Québec Cinéma de se dissocier de Claude Jutra"]. [[CBC News|ICI Radio-Canada]], February 17, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; She also mandated the [[Commission de toponymie]] (Quebec Toponymy Commission), a sub-agency of [[Office québécois de la langue française]] which reports to the Minister of Culture, to assemble a list of all streets and public places in the province bearing the name Jutra.&lt;ref name=heldavrc/&gt; On the same day, [[Montreal]] mayor [[Denis Coderre]] announced that the city would remove Jutra's name from streets and parks in its jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/montreal/201602/17/01-4951559-montreal-et-trois-autres-villes-vont-retirer-le-nom-de-claude-jutra-de-leurs-rues-et-parcs.php "Montréal et trois autres villes vont retirer le nom de Claude Jutra de leurs rues et parcs"]. ''[[La Presse (Canadian newspaper)|La Presse]]'', February 17, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the controversy, ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' said: "Few legendary figures have fallen so quickly and so completely. Merely 24 hours after the official publication of the first explosive allegation of child abuse against the Canadian cinematic pioneer, the film industry and governments started scrubbing the name Claude Jutra from every trophy, park and street."

===As director===
Jutra made his debut as a director with ''Le dément du lac Jean-Jeunes'' - it explored themes that remained throughout his work, a nostalgia for childhood, madness, and troubled waters.

His collaboration with [[Michel Brault]] began at this early period.  ''Mouvement perpétuel'' was influenced by [[Jean Cocteau]]'s ''[[The Blood of a Poet|Le Sang d'un poète]]''. ''[[L'École de la peur]]'' (1953) was the first television film made in Quebec. Towards the end of the 1950s he moved to France and [[François Truffaut]], who became a friend, asked him to direct a Cocteau scenario, ''Anna la Bonne'' (1959). In 1960 Jutra returned to Canada.

A '''diplomatic courier''' is an official who transports [[diplomatic bag]]s as sanctioned under the 1961 [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]].  Couriers are granted [[diplomatic immunity]] and are thereby protected by the receiving state from arrest and detention when performing their work.  Couriers may be assigned on an [[ad hoc]] basis, but in those cases they are released from immunity once their bags have been delivered.  All couriers are provided documentation that reports their status as couriers and the number of packages currently being transported in the diplomatic bag.  Diplomatic bags may be transported under the authority of commercial airline captains, but they are not diplomatic couriers. 

==United Kingdom==
Diplomatic bags of the [[United Kingdom]] are carried by the [[Queen's Messenger]]s, who work for the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] and by Postal and Courier Operators of the [[Royal Logistic Corps]].

==United States==
The Diplomatic Courier Service transported 116,351 items weighing approximately 5,353,000 pounds in 2017. The only time in its history where an item didn't reach the destination was in 1919 where a baby piano was lost during transit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Adams |first1=Eric |title=Riding With the Diplomatic Couriers Who Deliver America's Secret Mail |url=https://www.wired.com/story/diplomatic-courier-service/ |accessdate=4 September 2018 |work=Wired |date=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elias R. Wightman''' or '''Elias D. Wightman''' (early 1792 – October 26 1841) was one of the [[Old Three Hundred]] Texas colonists, having moved there in 1824. He was often employed as a surveyor for [[Stephen F. Austin]]'s colony.

==Texian settler==
Wightman was born early in 1792 in [[Herkimer County, New York]] to parents Benjamin and Esther (nee Randall) Wightman. His father was a [[Baptists in the United States|Baptist]] preacher and father to 11 children. Elias taught school in New York and then traveled to Texas in 1824. Stephen F. Austin named him in July 1825 to appraise cargo damaged aboard the schooner ''Lady of the Lake''. In August 1826, Wightman joined others to petition Austin to charter a town at [[Matagorda, Texas|Matagorda]]. Wightman also petitioned Austin for a league of land and on May 25, 1827 he accepted title to a [[sitio]] (or league) in [[Matagorda County, Texas|Matagorda County]].&lt;ref name=Handbook&gt;{{Handbook of Texas|id=fwi06|name=WIGHTMAN, ELIAS R.|date=June 15, 2010|retrieved=September 1, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sitio was located at the mouth of the [[Colorado River (Texas)|Colorado River]] on the east bank of the river.{{sfn|Von-Maszewski|2011|pp=200–201}}

[[File:Matagorda Cemetery gates, Matagorda, TX.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.0|alt=Photo shows Matagorda Cemetery 1830.|Matagorda Cemetery - 1830]]

In 1828, Austin sent Wightman and [[David G. Burnet]] to the [[United States]] to recruit new settlers.&lt;ref name=Handbook/&gt; While in New York, Wightman married [[Mary Sherwood Wightman Helm|Mary Sherwood]], a former student, on October 26, 1828. The couple began their return journey on November 2, 1828 with 50–60 colonists, mostly New Yorkers. They went by wagon to the [[Allegheny River]] where they transferred to boat for the trip down the [[Ohio River|Ohio]] and [[Mississippi River]]s. From [[New Orleans]] they sailed west on the schooner ''Little Zoe'', beginning on December 26. Bad weather and the tricky passage of the river channel kept them from landing in Matagorda until January 27, 1829. They lived in the small fort for several months until they could get lumber to build a simple cabin. Mary taught school and Sunday school in a log school house from 1829 to 1832.{{sfn|Exley|2010}} His parents, who made the trip from New York, both died in 1830 and are the earliest burials in the Matagorda Cemetery.&lt;ref name=Handbook/&gt;

Wightman probably attended an 1829 meeting with Austin at [[San Felipe, Texas|San Felipe]] to discuss founding a [[masonic lodge]]. He was elected surveyor for Matagorda in August 1829. That October, he surveyed the town of [[East Columbia, Texas|Marion]]. In 1830, he frequently corresponded with frequently Austin while working for him as a surveyor. He promised to teach school for one year and discussed starting a salt works.&lt;ref name=Handbook/&gt; He and his wife obtained land along [[Caney Creek (Matagorda Bay)|Caney Creek]] which they farmed with several slaves. During the [[Runaway Scrape]] in 1836, Mary, her sister, an orphan girl, the family's slaves, and several neighbors fled the Mexican army by sea and were stranded at [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]]. They only returned to Caney Creek with difficulty.{{sfn|Exley|2010}}  

In 1837 Wightman was elected [[Justice of the Peace]] in Matagorda County. The next year he joined a company exploring the possibility of clearing Caney Creek for navigation. In 1840 he wrote a letter to [[Mirabeau B. Lamar]] suggesting that John Delap succeed Silas Dinsmore as [[county judge]]. In 1841, Wightman sold his Texas lands&lt;ref name=Handbook/&gt; and moved to [[Covington, Kentucky]], looking for a more healthy climate. He died there on October 26, 1841.{{sfn|Exley|2010}} In the 1980s some of Wightman's surveyor notes were placed in the Matagorda County Museum in [[Bay City, Texas]].&lt;ref name=Handbook/&gt; His compass, which he shared with William Selkirk, can be seen there as well.{{sfn|Von-Maszewski|2011|p=99}}

'''Mary Ellaline Terriss, Lady Hicks''' (13 April 1871 – 16 June 1971), known professionally as '''Ellaline Terriss''', was a popular English actress and singer, best known for her performances in [[Edwardian musical comedies]]. She met and married the actor-producer [[Seymour Hicks]] in 1893, and the two collaborated on many projects for the stage and screen.

The daughter of the actor [[William Terriss]], Ellaline made her London stage debut at the age of 16 in ''Cupid's Messenger'' at London's [[Haymarket Theatre]]. Impressed with her performance, the producer [[Charles Wyndham (actor)|Charles Wyndham]] gave her a three-year contract, under which she first played Madge in ''Why Women Weep''. In 1892 Terriss starred in ''Faithful James'' (by [[B. C. Stephenson]]) and the following year she starred in the title role of ''Cinderella'', produced by [[Henry Irving]].  She was featured in [[W. S. Gilbert]]'s ''[[His Excellency (opera)|His Excellency]]'' in 1894, followed the next year by a starring role in the [[George Edwardes]] production of the musical ''[[The Shop Girl]]'', playing alongside her husband. The next year she starred in another musical hit, ''[[The Circus Girl]]''.

In 1897, her father was murdered by a deranged actor. As a result, she received much public sympathy, returning to the stage to star in ''[[A Runaway Girl]]'' in 1898, one of her most successful shows.  In the 1900s, she starred in a series of long-running hits, including ''[[Bluebell in Fairyland]]'' (1901), ''[[Quality Street (play)|Quality Street]]'' (1902), ''[[The Catch of the Season]]'' (1905) and ''[[The Beauty of Bath]]'' (1906). After 1910, Terriss concentrated on comedy roles and [[music hall]] tours.  Her unsuccessful return to musical comedy, ''Cash on Delivery'' (1917), confirmed the wisdom of this new career course.

Her later career also included film roles. She began in the silent films ''[[Scrooge (1913 film)|Scrooge]]'' and ''[[David Garrick (1913 film)|David Garrick]]'' (both from 1913) and made a successful transfer to [[talkies]]; her last film was ''[[The Four Just Men (1939 film)|The Four Just Men]]'' in 1939. She died in Hampstead, England, at the age of 100.

==Biography==
[[File:Ellaline Terriss in The Circus Girl.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Terriss as Dora in ''[[The Circus Girl]]'']]

===Early life===
Terriss was born '''Mary Ellaline Lewin'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.findmypast.co.uk/results/united-kingdom-records-in-birth-marriage-death-and-parish-records?firstname=mary%20ellaline%20&amp;firstname_variants=true&amp;lastname=lewin "Mary Ellaline Lewin"], Results for Birth, Marriage, Death &amp; Parish Records, ''Find My Past''; accessed 28 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Port Stanley]], [[Falkland Islands]].&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Taylor, C.M.P. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/40483 Terriss, Ellaline. ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''], Oxford University Press, accessed 7 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her father, [[William Terriss|William Lewin]], became a well-known actor in London under the name William Terriss. He loved the adventurous, outdoor life, and had previously tried his hand at various professions, including farmer, merchant seaman and silver miner. Shortly after Ellaline's birth, he gave up farming and moved his family back to England where, because of his swashbuckling style, was known as "Breezy Bill".&lt;ref&gt;Bartlett, Steve. [http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/feature.php/10468/a-fairy-elfish-thing-ellaline-terriss "'A fairy, elfish thing' - Ellaline Terriss"], ''The Stage'', 16 November 2005; accessed 10 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Her brother [[Tom Terriss|Tom]] became an actor and then a well-known film director. Her mother Isabel (née Lewis) also acted under the stage name Amy Fellowes.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smythe, Arthur J. [https://archive.org/stream/lifeofwilliamter024510mbp/lifeofwilliamter024510mbp_djvu.txt ''The Life of William Terriss, Actor''], Westminster: Archibald Constable, p. 35 (1898); accessed 16 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career===
Terriss performed from an early age, although she had no real ambition to act professionally.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; In 1887, she appeared in pantomime at the Alexandra Theatre, [[Liverpool]].&lt;ref&gt;Broadbent, pp. 319–20&lt;/ref&gt; Petite, pretty and talented, she attracted the praise of both critics and the public.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; She came to the attention of [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]], who signed her to make her professional London debut in the role of Mary Herbert in ''Cupid's Messenger'', in 1888 at the [[Haymarket Theatre]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;  Impressed by this performance, [[Charles Wyndham (actor)|Charles Wyndham]] gave her a three-year contract, under which she first played Madge in ''Why Women Weep''.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;  She also attracted the attention of a promising young actor, [[Seymour Hicks]], and they married in 1893.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

In 1892, Terriss starred in ''Faithful James'', by [[B.C. Stephenson]], with [[Brandon Thomas]] at the [[Royal Court Theatre|Court Theatre]].&lt;ref name=who&gt;Terriss, Ellaline. ''Who Was Who'', A &amp; C Black, 1920–2008; online edition, Oxford University Press, December 2007, accessed 7 January 2012 (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/15026/15026-h/15026-h.htm "Court On",] ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', 6 August 1892, accessed 20 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 1893, Terriss starred in the title role in the successful and famously lavish version of the  "fairy pantomime" ''Cinderella'', produced by [[Henry Irving]] with music by [[Oscar Barrett]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ilIuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA40&amp;lpg=PA40&amp;dq=%22On+and+Off%22+%22Ellaline+Terriss%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UjPy3vdlDN&amp;sig=CGn96uXXGuYiWooAZf53laE7YrU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=DbNcTIXjH4O88gbP-8TcCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Ellaline Terriss”] in "''On and off'': 35 actresses interviewed by 'The Call Boy'", p. 40, G. Dalziel (1894); accessed 5 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  Toward the end of the run, Hicks took over the role of Thisbe, one of Cinderella's half-sisters. They brought this production to America under the management of [[George Edwardes]]. The following season, Terriss played a supporting role in the [[W.S. Gilbert]] and [[Frank Osmond Carr]] [[comic opera]] ''[[His Excellency (opera)|His Excellency]]''.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

In 1895, Terriss was a replacement in the original London production of George Edwardes's hit, ''[[The Shop Girl]]'', joining her husband as co-star.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; They toured America in 1895, where they befriended the American novelist [[Richard Harding Davis]]. At the instance of Gilbert, Hicks wrote a drama called ''One of the Best'', a vehicle for Terriss's father William Terriss at the [[Adelphi Theatre]], based on the famous [[Dreyfus Affair|Dreyfus trial]]. The Hickses were frequent guests of Gilbert at his estate in [[Grim's Dyke]]. Terriss next played the title role, May, in ''My Girl'' (1896 at the Gaiety).&lt;ref&gt;Hollingshead, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;  Another early success for the young couple was ''[[The Circus Girl]]'' (1896; Terriss made [[Lionel Monckton]]'s song, "A Little Bit of String" into a major hit).&lt;ref name=who/&gt;

===Tragedy and triumph===
[[File:Ellaline Terriss in Bluebell in Fairyland.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Illustration from ''[[Bluebell in Fairyland]]'']]
In December 1897, while Terriss was still playing in ''The Circus Girl'', two tragedies befell her. Her father was stabbed to death by a deranged and disgruntled unemployed actor, [[Richard Archer Prince]], as he was about to enter the stage door of the Royal Adelphi Theatre. Her mother died shortly afterwards.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

The murder, and Prince's trial, filled the country's newspapers for weeks. Already the most popular couple on the London stage, Terriss and Hicks received an outpouring of sympathy. They moved on, becoming even more famous over the next decade.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; She next starred in the title role of a new show co-authored by Hicks, ''[[A Runaway Girl]]'' (1898), which became one of the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre's]] most successful shows. This was followed by ''With Flying Colours'' (1899).&lt;ref name=who/&gt; The couple adopted a daughter, Mabel, in 1889, and Terriss gave birth to another child, Betty, in 1904.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

In early 1900, the Hickses played in their only [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] show together, ''My Daughter-in-law'', at the Frohman brothers' [[Lyceum Theatre (New York, 1885–1902)|old Lyceum Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=5154 ''My Daughter-in-law''], IBDB, accessed April 11, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  They then joined forces with the producer [[Charles Frohman]] and, in his company over a period of seven years, they played the leads in a series of musicals written by Hicks, including: ''[[Bluebell in Fairyland]]'' (1901), which was continually revived as a Christmas entertainment for the next four decades; ''[[The Cherry Girl]]'' (1902); ''[[The Beauty of Bath]]'' (1906), which opened the Hicks Theatre (later renamed the Globe) and included additional lyrics by a newcomer, [[P.G. Wodehouse]], and music by [[Jerome Kern]], which became one of Terriss's best-loved roles; and ''[[The Gay Gordons (musical)|The Gay Gordons]]'' (1907).&lt;ref name=who/&gt;

Hicks and Terriss also starred in [[J.M. Barrie]]'s play ''[[Quality Street (play)|Quality Street]]'' in 1902.&lt;ref name=who/&gt;  At that time, they moved to a new home, the Old Forge, at [[Merstham]], [[Surrey]]. Their cul-de-sac was renamed "Quality Street".&lt;ref&gt;Nairn, Ian and Nikolaus Pevsner.

===Later career===
[[File:Ellaline Terriss and Betty Terriss.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Terriss with daughter Betty]]
The couple performed constantly, both in London and on tour in America, except when Terriss was pregnant with Betty. In 1905, Terriss took over the role of Angela in her husband's ''[[The Catch of the Season]]'', which had been created by [[Zena Dare]] during Terriss's pregnancy.&lt;ref name=who/&gt; Later Terriss ceded the role to Dare's sister, [[Phyllis Dare|Phyllis]].

In 1907, Terriss reduced the grueling acting schedule she had kept up for almost twenty years. She did continue to appear in a limited number of plays, including ''The Dashing Little Duke'' (1909; with [[C. Hayden Coffin]], [[Courtice Pounds]] and [[Louie Pounds]]), which was less successful.&lt;ref name=who/&gt; She played the title role in that production (a woman playing a man). When she missed several performances due to illness, Hicks played the role &amp;ndash; possibly the only case in the history of the musical where a husband succeeded to his wife's role.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Lamb (writer)|Lamb, Andrew]]. ''Leslie Stuart: The Man Who Composed Florodora'', pp. 206–209, London: Routledge {{ISBN|978-0-415-93747-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ellaline Terriss.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Terriss, c. 1896]]
After the failure of ''Captain Kidd'' (1910),&lt;ref name=who/&gt; Hicks and Terriss concentrated on comedy roles and [[music hall]] tours, including a tour of South Africa in 1911 and later a tour of France following the outbreak of [[World War I]], to give concerts to British troops at the front. Their unsuccessful return to musical comedy, ''Cash on Delivery'' (1917), confirmed the wisdom of their new career course.&lt;ref name=who/&gt;  After 1917, Terriss returned to the stage only on special occasions. In December 1925, she appeared at the Lyceum with her husband in ''The Man in Dress Clothes'', a French farce he had translated and in which their daughter made her stage debut.&lt;ref name=who/&gt; It was intended only to run for a short season, but it was such a success that its run was extended. "The Theatre World" reported in January 1926:{{quote|There is little doubt that much of the success of this revival is due to the presence in the cast of our one and only Ellaline Terriss. Of the older generation of actresses there is no more beloved figure than "dear Ella" as the gallery girls used to call her. She has never been a "great" actress, but her charm &amp;ndash; a sort of sweet radiance &amp;ndash; has made her one of the most popular of living players.}}

'''German Umaralievich Sadulaev''' (Russian: Герман Умаралиевич Садулаев, born 2 February 1973) is a [[Chechnya|Chechen]] writer.

== Biography ==
German Sadulaev was born in 1973, in the town of [[Shali, Chechen Republic|Shali]], in the [[Chechen-Ingush ASSR]], to a Chechen father and [[Terek Cossack]] mother. His father's mother was also a Russian. Because his grandmother was a Russian, she and the children were not deported as part of [[Aardakh]] but the father, a Chechen, was, thus separating his father's nuclear family, until they were reunited when the Chechens were allowed to return from their exile in Central Asia. During his childhood, the Sadulaev family had views that were at times considered pro-Russian by other Chechens. Sadulaev himself speaks both fluent Chechen and fluent Russian, and identifies as an ethnic Chechen; according to traditional Chechen culture one is considered a member of the ethnic group as well as the specific teip by patrilineal descent. He was born into the [[teip]] of Ersenoy.

In 1989, aged sixteen, he left Chechnya to study law at [[Leningrad State University]]. Today he lives and works as a lawyer in [[St Petersburg]].

German Sadulaev's first book, ''Radio FUCK'', told city tales of the thirty-something generation in St Petersburg. It made no mention of Chechnya. With the publication of his second book, ''I am a Chechen!'', critics acclaimed Sadulaev as "the literary find of the year" [http://exlibris.ng.ru/tendenc/2007-03-22/7_sadulaev.html]. Much more than a war novel, it was a lyrical fusion of exotic legends, stories and memories, nominated for the National Bestseller prize. Sadulaev's next work, ''Snowstorm, or The Myth of the End of the World'', was a grotesque fantasy satire about [[social Darwinism]]. It won the Eureka prize. Sadulaev's fourth book, ''The Maya Pill'', was shortlisted for the 2008 [[Russian Booker]] [http://www.russianbooker.org/news/22/] and for the 2009 National Bestseller [https://web.archive.org/web/20090618154428/http://www.natsbest.ru/N7.htm].

German Sadulaev's ''I am a Chechen!'' (translated by Anna Gunin) was published by [[Harvill Secker (publisher)|Harvill Secker]] in 2010. ''The Maya Pill'' (translated by Carol Apollonio) will be published by [[Dalkey Archive Press]] in 2013.

In 2016, he [[Russian legislative election, 2016|ran for Duma]] as a representative of the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2039">In [[Welsh mythology]], '''Gwythyr ap Greidawl''' was a rival of [[Gwyn ap Nudd]], a [[god (male deity)|deity]] connected with the [[Annwn|otherworld]]. In the [[Middle Welsh]] prose tale ''[[Culhwch ac Olwen]]'', he is named as a member of [[King Arthur|Arthur's]] retinue and takes part in the quest to win the hand of [[Olwen]] for Arthur's cousin, [[Culhwch]]. Gwthyr would join Arthur on a journey to Pennant Gofid in [[Hell]] to retrieve the blood of the witch Orddu. His father is Greidawl Galldonyd, a fellow knight in Arthur's court.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Sioned, The Mabinogion. 2007, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Bonedd yr Arwyr'', his genealogy is given as Gwythyr son of Greidawl the son of Enfael the son of Deigyr the son of Dyfnwal the son of Ednyfed the son of Maxen the son of Llywelyn.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Bromwich, Rachel. ''Trioedd Ynys Prydein.''&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Welsh Triads]] name him as the father of [[King Arthur|Arthur's]] second wife, also named   [[Guinevere|Gwenhwyfar]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Sometime before the main events of ''Culhwch and Olwen'', Gwythyr was engaged to marry [[Creiddylad|Creiddylad, daughter of Lludd]], who was stolen from him by her brother, [[Gwyn ap Nudd]]. In a violent battle, Gwyn defeated his rival, kept Creiddylad and took a number of Gwythyr's chieftains prisoner. When Arthur heard of this, he forced Gwyn to release the noblemen and made peace between the two adversaries.

Every [[Calan Mai]], the two would fight over [[Creiddylad]], until a battle on Judgment Day, in which the victor would keep her forever. Their rivalry has been taken to represent the contest between summer and winter and is a variant of the [[Holly King (archetype)|Holly King]] myth.&lt;ref&gt;''The White Goddess: A Historical Grammar of Poetic Myth''.

'''Halima Bashir''' is a [[Sudan]]ese doctor and author of ''[[Tears of the Desert]]'', a memoir about women's experiences with genocide and [[war in Darfur]]. She worked as a doctor in rural Sudan, before being abused at the hands of the [[National Intelligence and Security Service]] after reporting truthfully to [[United Nations]] officials about an attack by the [[Janjaweed]] militia on a nearby school. She has since moved to the United Kingdom, where she claimed [[Right of asylum|asylum]].

==Early life==
Halima Bashir, a [[pseudonym]] later adopted to protect her,&lt;ref name="neverforget"/&gt; grew up in rural [[Darfur]] in Western [[Sudan]].&lt;ref name="notsilenced"/&gt; She was the oldest of four children,&lt;ref name="neverforget"/&gt; and did well in school.&lt;ref name="notsilenced"/&gt; At the age of eight, she underwent [[Female genital mutilation|female circumcision]]. A special meal was held, and she was given money, before behind held down in the hut of her grandmother while a razor without [[anaesthetic]] was used to cut off any external genitalia.&lt;ref name="neverforget"/&gt;

Her father was supportive when she trained to become a doctor; she completed her training just prior to the start of the genocide and [[War in Darfur]]. While she was posted in a clinic, she gave an interview in which she disagreed with the official position of the Sudanese government. In response, she was detained and threatened by the authorities, before being posted to a rural clinic and warned not to speak to western journalists.&lt;ref name="notsilenced"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kristof|first1=Nicholas|title=Tortured, but Not Silenced|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/31/opinion/31kristof.html|accessdate=22 October 2016|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=31 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At her new clinic, she found herself treating the victims of the [[Janjaweed]] militia, including school girls who had been raped en masse. She later explained, "At no stage in my years of study had I been taught how to deal with 8-year-old victims of gang rape in a rural clinic without enough sutures to go around." When two officials from the [[United Nations]] to gather information about the attack, Bashir told them the truth. In response, she was taken by the [[National Intelligence and Security Service]],&lt;ref name="notsilenced"/&gt; and was gang raped, cut with knives and burned with cigarettes repeatedly over the course of several days.&lt;ref name="indy"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Woolfe|first1=Marie|title=The rape of Darfur: a crime that is shaming the world|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/the-rape-of-darfur-a-crime-that-is-shaming-the-world-427840.html|accessdate=22 October 2016|work=[[The Independent]]|date=10 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was released and returned to her village, where her father [[arranged marriage|arranged]] for her to be married to her cousin Sharif, who she had only met once before. He had chosen Sharif, because he was viewed as being progressive. The village was attacked shortly afterwards, resulting in the death of her father and the disappearance of her siblings.&lt;ref name="notsilenced"/&gt;

==Journey overseas and writing==
Bashir left Sudan and travelled to the United Kingdom to claim [[Right of asylum|asylum]],&lt;ref name="notsilenced"/&gt; she had paid a people trafficker with jewellery.&lt;ref name="neverforget"/&gt; While in the UK, she protested the country's lack of action against Sudan, handing a letter personally to [[David Triesman, Baron Triesman|Lord David Triesman]], the Minister for Africa within the British government.&lt;ref name="indy"/&gt; She wrote an autobiography, ''[[Tears of the Desert]]'', in collaboration with [[Damian Lewis]]. Bashir said that her husband was supportive of her work, but he did not know the full story, saying "He did not know everything until I did the book. There were many things new for him. Now he knows more details."&lt;ref name="neverforget"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harding|first1=Louette|title='I will never forget the faces of the men who raped me'|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/you/article-1033368/8216-I-forget-faces-men-raped-8217.html|accessdate=22 October 2016|work=[[Daily Mail]]|date=10 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her book, she has changed names and places. However, independent verification by ''[[The New York Times]]'' has demonstrated the facts appear without any exaggeration.&lt;ref name="notsilenced"/&gt; The newspaper also campaigned for Bashir to be granted a [[Visa policy of the United States|visa for entry]] into the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yefimov|first1=Natasha|title=Helping Dr. Halima Bashir|url=http://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/04/helping-dr-halima-bashir/?_r=0|accessdate=22 October 2016|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=4 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has explained that she wishes to return to Sudan at some point in the future, as she feels the people of her village will be in need. She explained, "I dream of going back, to be a doctor, to honour my father’s dream for me, but I can’t until the world helps us achieve peace in Darfur."&lt;ref name="neverforget"/&gt; In 2010, she was awarded the [[Anna Politkovskaya Award]] for speaking out about the Janjaweed's violent attacks on school girls in Darfur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelwomensinitiative.org/2010/10/halima-bashir-wins-the-annual-reach-all-women-in-war-award/ |title=Halima Bashir Wins 2010 Anna Politkovskaya Award |publisher=Nobel Women's Initiative |accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jerome Karle''' (born '''Jerome Karfunkle'''; June 18, 1918 – June 6, 2013) was an American [[physical chemist]]. Jointly with [[Herbert A. Hauptman]], he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize]] in [[Chemistry]] in 1985, for the direct analysis of [[crystal structure]]s using [[X-ray scattering techniques]].&lt;ref name=Nobel/&gt;&lt;ref name=NRL&gt;[http://www.nrl.navy.mil/content.php?P=NOBEL NRL Scientists Receive 1985 Nobel Prize in Chemistry], [[United States Naval Research Laboratory]].

==Early life and education==
Karle was born in [[New York City]], on June 18, 1918, the son of Sadie Helen (Kun) and Louis Karfunkle.&lt;ref name="McGrath"&gt;{{cite book |last1=McGrath |first1=Kimberley A. |last2=Travers |first2=Bridget |title=World of scientific discovery |date=1999 |publisher=Gale Research |isbn=9780787627607 |page=530 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was born into a [[Jewish]] family with a strong interest in the arts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.ccny.cuny.edu/prospective/humanities/profiles/jkarle.cfm Jerome Karle] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005100532/http://www1.ccny.cuny.edu/prospective/humanities/profiles/jkarle.cfm |date=2013-10-05 }}, [[City College of New York]].

[https://books.google.com/books?id=SHhs74OSk34C&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121 "The road to Stockholm: Nobel Prizes, science, and scientists"], p. 121.

"Arthur Kornberg (M59), Jerome Karle (C85), and Paul Berg (C80) all went to the Abraham Lincoln High School in Brooklyn."&lt;/ref&gt; As a youth, Karle enjoyed [[American handball|handball]], [[ice skating]], [[Touch football (American)|touch football]] and swimming in the nearby [[Atlantic Ocean]].&lt;ref name=Nobel/&gt;

He started college at the age of 15 and received his [[bachelor's degree]] from the [[City College of New York]] in 1937, where he took additional courses in biology, chemistry and math in addition to the required curriculum there. He earned a [[master's degree]] from [[Harvard University]] in 1938, having majored in biology.&lt;ref name=Nobel/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bohning"&gt;{{cite book|editor-first1=James J.|editor-last1= Bohning|editor-first2=David K. |editor-last2=Van Keuren|title=Isabella Karle and Jerome Karle, Transcript of an Interview Conducted by James J.

As part of a plan to accumulate enough money to pay for further graduate studies, Karle took a position in [[Albany, New York]] with the [[New York State Department of Health]], where he developed a method to measure dissolved [[fluoride]] levels, a technique that would become a standard for [[water fluoridation]].&lt;ref name=Nobel/&gt;

He enrolled at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1940 and met his future wife, Isabella Lugoski, who was sitting at an adjoining desk during his first course in physical chemistry. The two married in 1942. They were both supervised in their Ph.D. studies by physical chemist [[Lawrence Brockway]]. Though Karle completed his studies in 1943, he was awarded his [[Ph.D.]] the following year.&lt;ref name=Nobel/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bohning"/&gt;

Jerome Karle was a former president of both the [[American Crystallographic Association]] (ACA) (1972) and the [[IUCr]] (1981-1984), as well as a co-recipient of the 1985 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on [[Direct methods (crystallography)|direct methods]]. Among the many additional honors he received for his work, he was elected to the [[National Academy of Sciences]] in 1976&lt;ref name="Bohning"/&gt; and the [[American Philosophical Society]] in 1990.

==Research and Nobel Prize==
Starting in 1943, after completing graduate studies, Karle worked on the [[Manhattan Project]] at the [[University of Chicago]] with his wife Dr. [[Isabella Karle]], one of the youngest scientists and few women on the project. In 1944, they returned to the [[University of Michigan]], where Karle worked on a project for the [[United States Naval Research Laboratory]]. In 1946, they moved to [[Washington, D.C.]] to work for the Naval Research Laboratory.&lt;ref name=Nobel/&gt;

Karle and Herbert A. Hauptman were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1985 for their work in using X-ray scattering techniques to determine the structure of crystals, a technique that is used to study the biological, chemical, metallurgical and physical characteristics. They were able to employ the [[Sayre equation]] in centrosymmetric structure, developing the so-called [[direct methods (crystallography)|direct methods]]. Through isolating the position of the atoms in a crystal, the molecular structure of the material being studied can be determined, allowing processes to be designed to duplicate the molecules being studied. This technique has played a major role in the development of new pharmaceutical products and other synthesized materials.&lt;ref name=NRL/&gt;

[[Image:Karle Retirement.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Jerome (left foreground) and [[Isabella Karle]] (seated center) at their 2009 retirement ceremony]]
Karle and his wife retired from the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory on July 31, 2009, after a combined 127 years of service to the United States Government, with Karle joining the NRL in 1944 and his wife two years later. At the time of his departure from government service, Karle held the Chair of Science as Chief Scientist of the Laboratory for the Structure of Matter. Retirement ceremonies for the Karles were attended by [[United States Secretary of the Navy]] [[Ray Mabus]], who presented the couple with the Department of the Navy Distinguished Civilian Service Award, the Navy's highest form of recognition to civilian employees.&lt;ref&gt;McKinney, Donna.

==Early life and influences==
Soho was born in La Union province, a daughter of Abelardo Soho, a government employee, and Maura Aspiras, an agriculturist.&lt;ref name="treasures" /&gt;

Soho's grandmothers, Sixta "Apo Ittang" Aspiras and Concepcion "Cion" Soho influenced her in telling stories.&lt;ref name="treasures" /&gt; At the [[University of the Philippines|UP College of Mass Communications]], Soho met the journalist [[Luis Beltran]], who inspired Soho to finish [[Mass Communications]].

==Career==
Soho joined [[GMA News and Public Affairs|GMA News]] in January 1985.&lt;ref name="treasures" /&gt; Soho's first voice-over report was a feature story on the inauguration of the [[Manila Light Rail Transit System|Light Rail Transit]] from Baclaran to Monumento. Soho was later assigned to the defense and military beat.

Soho is the first Filipino to win in the New York Film Festival for Coverage of a Breaking Story for her account of a hostage crisis in Cagayan Valley. She also received the Ka Doroy Valencia Award given by the [[Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas]]. In 1994, she received the Grand Prize from the Asia Pacific Broadcasting Union for her coverage of a breaking news story. Soho is included in the list of 100 Filipino Women of Distinction chosen during the centennial celebration of the [[Philippines]].

Soho helped conceptualize the one-hour documentary television program ''[[I-Witness]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=10 years of ‘I-Witness’ tonight on GMA|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/228528/10-years-iwitness-tonight-gma|work=mb.com.ph|publisher=[[Manila Bulletin]]|date=November 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documentaries "Kidneys for Sale" and "Kamao" made her the first Filipino reporter, with [[GMA Network]] as the first Filipino network, to win the [[George Foster Peabody Award]] in 1999.&lt;ref name="international" /&gt;

Soho was also recognized by the New York Film and Television Festival Award for her coverage of a hostage crisis in Cagayan Valley, and the Asian Television Award for Best News and Current Affairs Special for "Saksi Sa Kasaysayan".&lt;ref name="international" /&gt;

Soho's GMA news programs ''[[Kapuso Mo, Jessica Soho]]'' and ''[[State of the Nation with Jessica Soho]]'' were recognized by the Peabody Awards in 2014 for their coverage on [[Typhoon Haiyan|Super Typhoon Yolanda]]. ''State of the Nation'' also earned Soho consecutive wins for Most Trusted News Presenter by Reader's Digest Asia.&lt;ref name="readers1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lo|first1=Ricky|title=Jessica 5-time ‘Most Trusted’ TV person|url=http://www.philstar.com/entertainment/2015/07/16/1477318/jessica-5-time-most-trusted-tv-person|accessdate=October 21, 2016|work=philstar.com|publisher=[[The Philippine Star]]|date=July 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="readers2"&gt;{{cite news|title=GMA Network, Mike Enriquez at Jessica Soho, kinilala sa Reader's Digest Trusted Brand Awards|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/video/375448/24oras/gma-network-mike-enriquez-at-jessica-soho-kinilala-sa-readers-digest-trusted-brand-awards|accessdate=October 21, 2016|work=GMA News Online|publisher=[[GMA Network (company)|GMA Network, Inc.]]|date=July 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Soho was given an [[honorary doctorate]] in humanities by the [[University of Northeastern Philippines]] during its 67th Commencement Exercises on April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jessica Soho to grace UNEP’s 67th Commencement Exercises|url=http://www.bicolmail.com/2012/?p=20078|accessdate=April 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
In May 2013, a controversy sparked involving Soho and comedian [[Vice Ganda]], involving a joke directed at the anchor during Vice's ''I Vice Ganda Mo Ako Sa Araneta'' concert held last May 17, 2013.&lt;ref name="sohojab"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/310389/showbiz/rape-joke-ni-vice-ganda-tungkol-kay-jessica-soho-binatikos|title=Rape joke ni Vice Ganda tungkol kay Jessica Soho, binatikos|language=Tagalog|accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vice mentioned Soho, among several other personalities, in a stand-up skit involving celebrities starring in a [[pornographic film]], adding that Soho would be [[gang rape]]d if she were cast, as well as making several jokes ridiculing her weight.

Vice Ganda later issued a public apology during his regular appearances in ''It's Showtime!'', admitting to his wrongdoing and that he offended Soho and several others with his jokes. Jessica Soho later acknowledged Vice's apology but she denied any intent to close any further discussion with the comedian.&lt;ref name="viceapology"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/entertainment/05/29/13/vice-ganda-speaks-jessica-soho-joke|title=Vice Ganda speaks up on Jessica Soho joke|publisher=[[ABS-CBN News]]|accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''João Maria de Jesus''', born '''Anastás Marcaf''' (died {{circa|1908}}) was an itinerant preacher and healer who was active in southern Brazil around the end of the 19th century and start of the 20th century. After his death his devotees conflated his identity with two other [[João Maria (monk)|monks named João Maria]] who wandered, preached and cured in the region. 
There are many places where a small cross or altar marks a place where the monk "João Maria" stopped.
There are many who think that João Maria is still working his miracles today.

==Life==

João Maria de Jesus was originally named Anastás Marcaf. He was probably a Syrian of Greek ancestry.
He arrived in Brazil from Argentina in 1886.{{sfn|Kubaski|2012}}{{efn|Other sources say Anastás Marcaf may have come from France, and his name may have been Atanás Markaf.{{sfn|Welter |2007|p=44}} }}
When asked where he came from he said he was born in the sea and raised in Buenos Aires.{{sfn|Welter |2007|p=44}}
One legend about João Maria de Jesus is that he abandoned the Christian religion to marry a pagan, and fought the French expeditionary army. 
After his wife's death he was made a prisoner, managed to escape, and had a vision of the apostle Paul who sent him on a pilgrimage for 14 (or perhaps 40) years as penance. 
Other legends held that he had committed some crime, or had seduced a nun, and as penance had to wander alone in the back country.{{sfn|Araújo|2016}}

In the 1890s João Maria de Jesus began to wander in southern Brazil.{{sfn|Silva|Kunrath|2015|p=1911}}
He said he had a dream that he would walk the world for fourteen years without eating meat on Wednesdays, Fridays or Saturdays, and without staying in anyone's house.{{sfn|Welter |2007|p=45}}
João Maria de Jesus's appearance, with a long white beard, and way of life were similar to [[João Maria D’Agostini]], who had preached and healed in the region earlier.{{sfn|Silva|Kunrath|2015|p=1911}}
He followed a similar path to D’Agostini, and blessed several sources of water.{{sfn|Kubaski|2012}}
He assumed the first monk's names and sanctity as a means to gain credibility among the people, but never claimed that he was a reincarnation of the first João Maria.{{sfn|Araújo|2016}}

During the [[Federalist Riograndense Revolution|Federalist Revolution]] of 1893–95 João Maria de Jesus attended wounded rebels.{{sfn|Cueto|Palmer|2014|p=94}}
His teachings were prophetic and apocalyptic.
He said God would punish mankind with plagues of insects and bloody wars.
He thought the  [[First Brazilian Republic]] of 1889 was the work of the devil, and defended restoration of the monarchy as the "order of God".{{sfn|Silva|Kunrath|2015|p=1912}}
The doctor and federalist colonel Angelo Dourado met João Maria, who claimed to have foreseen the present war, and said the republicans were animated by the devil, and had strength and money, but the others would win even without arms.{{sfn|Carvalho|2010}}

[[File:O monge João Maria em 1861.jpg|thumb|The earlier [[João Maria D’Agostini]], whom João Maria de Jesus was said to resemble]]
João Maria de Jesus became famous as a healer, and his medicine was thought to be miraculous.
It was said he could cure a person simply by praying for their health and prescribing a tea from a common herb called "monk's broom".{{sfn|Silva|Kunrath|2015|p=1912}}
He was quoted as saying, "He who does not know how to read the book of nature is illiterate in God's eyes."{{sfn|Cueto|Palmer|2014|p=94}}
His devotees thought that all objects or places that he touched became sacred, and would provide the hermit's blessings after he had disappeared.{{sfn|Silva|Kunrath|2015|p=1912}}
João Maria de Jesus avoided gatherings of followers, and did not spend long in one place, so was less of a hermit than the first João Maria. 
He performed sacraments such as baptism despite being a layman, which caused conflicts with the clergy.{{sfn|Alves|2010|p=40}}

João Maria de Jesus disappeared in 1908.{{sfn|Welter |2007|p=44}}
He may have died in 1908 in hospital in [[Ponta Grossa]], Paraná, or may be buried in [[Lagoa Vermelha]], Rio Grande do Sul.{{sfn|Silva|Kunrath|2015|p=1912}}
His devotees think the monk is still living in the Morro Taió, a hill in [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]].{{sfn|Silva|Kunrath|2015|p=1912}}

==Legends==

One legend tells that when João Maria de Jesus was passing through [[Ponta Grossa]] early in the 1900s some children playing in the street threw stones at him.
The monk calmly called for retribution, saying, "Rude city, the stones that hurt me now will multiply and come back to you one day."
According to the legend on 11 September 1906 an intense rain of stones fell in the town, damaging or destroying several houses.{{sfn|Kubaski|2012}}
This is just one of several legends in which a cruel streak appears when the monk was offended in some way.{{sfn|Araújo|2016}}

A common legend is that in the middle of storms the monk sat outside but did not get wet.
Others said he could be praying in his cave and at the same time be next to a sick man, helping him. 
He was said to be able to become invisible to his persecutors, walk over the water of rivers, drive out evil spirits and calm storms, among other miracles.{{sfn|Araújo|2016}}
He was said to be immune to Indians and wild animals, who never attacked him.
There are many stories of healing.
The legends have become part of the folklore of the region.{{sfn|Araújo|2016}}

==Legacy==
[[File:João Maria de Jesus.jpg|thumb|Hand-colored photograph from 1898]]
João Maria de Jesus and [[João Maria D’Agostini]] were the two best-known of the monks named "João Maria" who wandered in the region preaching in the last part of the 19th century.{{sfn|Kubaski|2012}}
There is a large literature about the monks called João Maria, but the devout population have little interest in their historicity and are much more concerned with the sacred characteristics attributed to them.{{sfn|Alves|2010|p=36}}
There are people today who think that João Maria, now more than 200 years old, still wanders in the region and works his miracles.
There are many places in the center and east of [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]] and Santa Catarina, the south of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] and the north of [[Rio Grande do Sul]], where a small altar or cross marks a place where one of the "João Marias" would have passed.{{sfn|Kubaski|2012}}

The various wanderers recognized as the monk or prophet João Maria  all have strong similarities.
They are pilgrims, without home or family. They have withdrawn from the pleasures of the world to do penance by serving God.
They preach the [[Apocalypse]], when God will punish all sinners.
They have the miraculous power of healing, and they are immortal.{{sfn|Welter |2007|p=47}}

João Maria de Jesus was photographed by Herculano Fonseca of Ponta Grossa in 1898, and these photographs were copied by a photographer from [[Caxias do Sul]], Giácomo Geremia, who sold many copies of them.
In the 1970s and 1980s the images were widely distributed among the local [[Kaingang]] and [[Xokleng]] people by leaders of the Indian Missionary Council.
These photographs continue to be widely reproduced in southern Brazil today.{{sfn|Welter |2007|p=45}}
Some have the legend "Prophéta Jõao Maria de Jesúz, 180 anos".{{sfn|Welter |2007|p=46}}
Others calls him "Santo" (saint) with the legend "João Maria de Jesus com 188 anos", which would give a birth date around the time when the first João Maria was born.{{sfn|Araújo|2016}}
A painting that copies one of the photographs has the legend "Jõao Maria de Agostinho Propheta", reflecting the confusion with the earlier João Maria.{{sfn|Welter |2007|p=46}}

The monk stayed near a spring of water in the Uvaranas neighborhood of Ponta Grossa. 
The place was still being visited by devotees in 2012.
A woman who cares for the site at that time said she had witnessed three apparitions of João Maria de Jesus.{{sfn|Kubaski|2012}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3919">'''Jácome de Bruges''', (born Jacob van Brugge in 1415 [[Flanders]]) was the son of a wealthy merchant family in [[Bruges]]. He became a servant of [[Henry the Navigator|Prince Henry the Navigator]] of [[Portugal]] (the son of king [[John I of Portugal|John I]]), who initiated the so-called Portuguese [[Age of Discovery]] in the 15th century.

As a native of a city belonging to the [[Hanseatic league]], Jácome de Bruges had been exposed to well-ordered [[mercantilism]], and he understood the value of international trade as a driver of national prosperity.  Consequently, he was a logical candidate to enter into the service of the like-minded Prince Henry in Portugal.

Jácome, arrived on the Iberian peninsula, with many of his compatriots on business, and lived in the northern city of Porto for at least ten years.&lt;ref name="BIHT58"&gt;José Guilherme Reis Leite (2012), p.58&lt;/ref&gt; The perceived notion that de Bruges was recommended by [[Josse van Huerter|Joos van Moerkerke]] (a Flemish nobleman in the service of [[Isabella of Burgundy]], sister of [[Duarte I of Portugal]]) was dismissed, with the Silves document between de Burges and Henry.&lt;ref name=BIHT58/&gt;  It was seigniorial contract between the two men; in the 2 March 1450 contract, de Bruges received the first license from Prince Henry to lead a contingent of settlers to the island of [[Terceira]], the 'third' island of the [[Azores|Azorean]] archipelago.&lt;ref name=BIHT58/&gt; The document did not stipulate the nationality, and along with seventeen Flemish families, de Bruges settled on Terceira. Yet, even with his efforts, and ten years, Jácome de Bruges was unable to fulfill his contract, which was confirmed by the donation letter of the islands of Terceira and Graciosa, made by Prince Henry to his nephew, the Infante D. Fernando.&lt;ref name=BIHT58/&gt; The Infante Fernando then changed the colonial settlement strategy, sending people of confidence to the islands (ultimately the contract between Bruges and Henry expired and he returned to the continent).&lt;ref name="BIHT59"&gt;José Guilherme Reis Leite (2012), p.59&lt;/ref&gt;

But, by the end of the 16th century, de Bruges returned to Terceira; he was one of two captains who were sent to the island: Jácome de Bruges installed his administration in the region of Praia, while [[Álvaro Martins|Álvaro Martins Homem]] settled in Angra.&lt;ref name=BIHT59/&gt; Both captains commanded two distinct groups of colonists, all Portuguese and no Flemish.&lt;ref name=BIHT59/&gt;

Jácome de Bruges disappeared mysteriously, with the suggestion that he was murdered, thrown overboard while at sea, during a voyage. 
Jácome de Bruges descendent, his daughter, eventually married Duarte Paim, founding the Paim de Bruges noble family.&lt;ref name=BIHT59/&gt;

Ultimately more than two thousand Flemish settled in the Azores during the fifteenth century. Although these Flemish immigrants quickly adapted to Portuguese manners, habits, and culture, their legacy — in the form of windmills, clothing, and some lingering physical traits (blond hair and blue eyes) — have persisted until the present day on some Azorean islands to remind visitors of a Flemish heritage. Because of the presence of Flemish farmers, the Azores were known, until quite recently, as the ''Islas de Flamengos'' (Flemish Isles).

Karan Bilimoria was born in [[Hyderabad (India)|Hyderabad]], [[India]] into a [[Zoroastrian]] [[Parsi]] family that has a background in the armed forces and business.&lt;ref name=parsikhabar&gt;[http://parsikhabar.net/karan-bilimoria-first-parsi-in-house-of-lords/ Karan Bilimoria in House of Lords] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629034530/http://parsikhabar.net/karan-bilimoria-first-parsi-in-house-of-lords/ |date=29 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, [[F. N. Billimoria|Lt. General Faridoon Noshire Bilimoria]] [[Param Vishisht Seva Medal|PVSM]] (1933–2005), popularly known as 'General Billy', was the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the Central Army Command of the [[Indian Army]], who had also served as [[Aide-de-camp|ADC]] to the first Indian President, [[Rajendra Prasad]], and commanded the [[5 Gorkha Rifles (Frontier Force)|2/5 Gorkha Rifles (Frontier Force)]] during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]].

Lt. General Bilimoria, while General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the Central Indian Army, was also sent by the [[Government of India]] to [[Sri Lanka]] in 1990 to review the work of the [[Indian Peace Keeping Force]] which had been deployed in that country during the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]] under the [[Indo-Sri Lanka Accord]], and it was on his recommendations that the force was recalled in 1990, ending India's military engagement with the [[LTTE]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/obituaries/article2084545.ece|title=Lieutenant-General Faridoon Bilimoria - The Times|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karan's paternal grandfather, Nasservanji D. Bilimoria, was one of the first Indians to be commissioned as an officer at the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]] into the [[Indian Army|British Indian Army]] and retired as a [[Brigadier]].&lt;ref name="elitebusinessmagazine.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elitebusinessmagazine.co.uk/interviews/item/from-the-ashes|title=From the ashes - Elite Business Magazine|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, Yasmin Bilimoria ''nee'' Italia, was the daughter of Jamshed D. Italia, a [[Squadron Leader]] in the [[Indian Air Force|Royal Indian Air Force]], and Aimai Italia ''nee'' Bharucha of Hyderabad. His maternal great-grandfather, D.D. Italia, was a Hyderabad-based businessman and politician who served as a member of the [[Rajya Sabha]] in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/it-s-a-lifechanging-moment-lord-bilimoria/172762|title=It's a life-changing moment: Lord Bilimoria|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both his mother and maternal grandfather were educated in Britain at [[University of Birmingham|Birmingham University]].

As the name denotes, Bilimora is the ancestral name of a city situated on the banks of the river Ambika, in Gandevi taluka and [[Navsari]] district of [[Gujarat]] state in India, where the family comes from originally.

==Early life==
Karan did his early schooling in Hyderabad from [[Hyderabad Public School]] at [[Begumpet]], Hyderabad where the family lived at his mother's ancestral home, Anand Bhavan, while his father served in different military stations in the country. As he grew, his family began to accompany his father, and Karan attended seven different schools before he was sent to board at the [[Hebron School, Ooty]] in the [[Nilgiris]], Tamil Nadu,&lt;ref name=hebron&gt;{{cite web|last=Paul|first=Nisha|title=Multicultural Brew|url=http://www.verveonline.com/48/people/billimoria.shtml|work=Volume 15, Issue 4, April, 2007|publisher=Verve Online|accessdate=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; alongside his younger brother, Nadir. When he was still nineteen, Karan received his [[Bachelor of Commerce]] [[academic degree|degree]] from [[Osmania University]] in Hyderabad in 1981.

On receiving a scholarship, he then moved to London where he qualified as a [[chartered accountant]] with what is today [[Ernst &amp; Young]] and received a diploma in accounting from the [[London Metropolitan University]]. Thereafter he read law at [[Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dodonline.co.uk/engine.asp?lev1=4&amp;lev2=38&amp;menu=81&amp;biog=y&amp;id=54211&amp;group=5&amp;Page=Lord%20Bilimoria%20:%20Political%20Biography Biography] from dodonline, retrieved 8 September 2006 Not available directly, but available by following the link from [http://www.parliament.uk/directories/house_of_lords_information_office/alphabetical_list_of_members.cfm House of Lords: Alphabetical List of Members] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212094207/http://www.parliament.uk/directories/house_of_lords_information_office/alphabetical_list_of_members.cfm |date=12 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While at Cambridge, Karan played on the university's [[polo]] team, organising their first ever tour of India, receiving a Half-Blue in 1988, and led the debating team against [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] for two years, becoming also the Vice-President of the [[Cambridge Union]] before graduating in 1988.&lt;ref name="annmorgan.me"&gt;http://www.annmorgan.me/Cobra%20interview%20%281%29.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993 he married Lynne Heather Walker, a South African national, whom he met through mutual friends.  She is an English and Latin graduate of [[Rhodes University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.verveonline.com/48/people/billimoria.shtml|title=People - Multicultural Brew|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding of Cobra Beer==
During the India tour of the Cambridge polo team, Karan noticed that the polo sticks made in India were different and of better quality than those made in Britain. At the time, polo sticks made in [[Argentina]] were very popular but following the [[Falklands War]], imports of Argentinian products into Britain had been banned and there was little competition to British manufacturers. Karan began to import polo sticks from India to fill in the gap, selling these successfully and profitably to [[Harrod's]] and [[Lillywhites]].&lt;ref name="annmorgan.me"/&gt; He also experimented with importing fashion goods, fabrics, and other products from India, but unlike the polo sticks these were not very successful ventures.&lt;ref name="elitebusinessmagazine.co.uk"/&gt;

In 1989, along with his friend Arjun Reddy, Karan founded [[Cobra Beer]] in a little flat in [[Fulham]]. The idea for the beer had come up while he was a student at Cambridge, where he regularly ate his meals at Indian restaurants. He noticed that regular [[lager]] was too gassy and bloating to be enjoyed with food, while [[ale]] was too bitter to accompany a meal. He came up with a concept for a beer that had 'the refreshing qualities of a lager' but the 'smoothness and drinkability of an ale' to accompany food – in particular, Indian food and [[curry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/enterprisesupplement/cobra-beer | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Jemima | last=Kiss | title=Passion, faith, self-belief (and a love of beer) | date=28 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, after concluding his import-export ventures, Karan and Arjun Reddy started Cobra Beer.

At the time Karan had a student debt of £20,000, and funds to start the business were not easy to find. Borrowing money from various sources and £30,000 from a bank, Cobra commenced operations. A brewer in [[Bangalore]], India, Dr Subroto Cariapa, and the owner of Mysore Breweries, Mr Balan, liked the idea of the beer and helped create Cobra. From India, then, it was imported to Britain. In a battered old Citroen 2CV, Karan himself began distributing 15 cases of beer at a time across London and, slowly, outside it.&lt;ref name="annmorgan.me"/&gt;

Since marketing on a large scale was not an option because of the paucity of funds, penetrating Britain's highly competitive beer market required an innovative approach. The task was made all the more challenging because by 1990 the country was also in an economic [[recession]]. Cobra took off in these circumstances by creating a niche for itself in the market. Indian [[curry]] was becoming increasingly popular in the country at the time and so Cobra Beer was marketed and sold as the perfect drink to go with it. Karan himself delivered cases of Cobra to Indian restaurants, where it became very popular with customers. Within five years, the one million mark in sales revenues was crossed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iilm.edu/iilm-online/Casebook/Cases2007/3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Cobra began to be served across the United Kingdom in thousands of Indian restaurants and the business began to grow, expanding into the pub and bar sector and also being sold in major supermarket chains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/passedfailed-an-education-in-the-life-of-lord-bilimoria-of-chelsea-founder-of-cobra-beer-437254.html|title=Passed/Failed: An education in the life of Lord Bilimoria of Chelsea, founder of Cobra Beer | location=London | work=The Independent|first=Jonathan|last=Sale|date=22 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, the company diversified into wine.

By 2001 Cobra, from which Karan's partner had now exited, had a turnover of nearly £13&amp;nbsp;million with a sales growth rate of nearly 60% per year, and was being brewed locally in the UK by [[Charles Wells Ltd]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startups.co.uk/karan-bilimoria.html|title=Karan Bilimoria: Cobra Beer - Startups.co.uk: Starting a business advice and business ideas|date=3 September 2001|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2007 Cobra was being sold in over 45 countries, and had a total production capacity of 450,000 cases per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2007-07-06/news/28447740_1_cobra-beer-beer-market-strong-brew | work=The Times of India | title=Cobra Beer launches 'King Cobra' | date=6 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Revenues stood at £30&amp;nbsp;million and, with rapid expansion, were expected to cross £100&amp;nbsp;million by 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1080519/jsp/business/story_9290054.jsp | location=Calcutta, India | work=The Telegraph | title=Bilimoria gears up for Cobra Beer sale | date=19 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Cobra Beer Partnership==
On 29 May 2009 the company went into [[administration (law)|administration]].  The company owed an estimated [[pound sterling|£]]70&amp;nbsp;million to creditors.&lt;ref name=MA&gt;{{cite news|author=Charity, Paul|title=Lord Bilimoria: I plan to clear Cobra debts|url=http://www.morningadvertiser.co.uk/General-News/Lord-Bilimoria-I-plan-to-clear-Cobra-debts|work=Morning Advertiser|date=8 October 2009|accessdate=20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Molson Coors]], one of the world's largest brewers, then paid circa £14&amp;nbsp;million for a 50.1% share in a [[pre-pack administration]] deal, leaving Bilimoria and his shareholders with the other 49.9%, and signed a joint venture deal under the name the Cobra Beer Partnership, of which Bilimoria is chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Sibun, Jonathan|title=Molson Coors downs Cobra Beer in £14m pre-pack|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/5408332/Molson-Coors-downs-Cobra-Beer-in-14m-pre-pack.html#|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=29 May 2009|accessdate=20 August 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 October 2009 Bilimoria claimed that the creditors of Cobra Beer will be settled out of future profits of the joint venture.&lt;ref name=MA/&gt;

== The Cobra Foundation ==
In 2005 Lord Bilimoria helped to establish the [http://www.cobra-foundation.org.uk/ Cobra Foundation], an independent charity that provides health, education and community support for young people in South Asia.  The charity focuses on the provision of safe water and also provides support to disaster relief efforts in the region.

Since 2014, the Cobra Foundation has partnered with Belu water to launch a new range of bottled water, with 100% of the profits made donated to WaterAid.  This partnership enabled the Cobra Foundation to donate £17,000 to WaterAid's efforts in South Asia in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cobra-foundation.org.uk/2016/03/cobra-foundation-donates-17k-to-wateraid-on-world-water-day/|title=Cobra Foundation donates £17K to WaterAid on World Water Day - Cobra Foundation|website=Cobra Foundation|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chancellor of the University of Birmingham ==

The previous holders of the office were [[Joseph Chamberlain]], [[Robert Cecil, 1st Viscount Cecil of Chelwood]], [[Anthony Eden]], [[Peter Scott|Sir Peter Scott]], [[Alex Jarratt|Sir Alex Jarratt]] and [[Dominic Cadbury|Sir Dominic Cadbury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birminghampost.co.uk/news/regional-affairs/lord-bilimoria-chelsea-installed-chancellor-7454356 |publisher=Birmingham Post |accessdate=3 November 2014 |title=Lord Bilimoria of Chelsea installed as Chancellor of University of Birmingham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ken Fields''' is an American real estate developer, entrepreneur and environmentalist.

==Career==
{{peacock|section|date=January 2016}}

===Real estate development===
Fields is recognized as a hotel and hospitality investor and developer. In 2002 he purchased the Ankara Motel property on 23rd Street and [[Collins Avenue]] in the [[Collins Park]] neighborhood of [[South Beach]]. The motel was built in 1954 by the architecture firm of Reiff &amp; Feldman and is one of the few remaining examples of [[googie]] style architecture in South Beach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=MiMo: Miami Modern Revealed |last=Nash |first=Eric P |year=2004 |publisher=Chronicle Books |isbn=978-0-8118-4204-4 |page=99 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pjnvimLjDQgC&amp;dq=MiMo+miami+modern+revealed&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bn&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=DuLDSpCmIqig8Qa99ZDGDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fields redeveloped the property into Miami Beach's first Arts Hotel, inviting artists to design individual rooms (notably [[Shepard Fairey]], Camella Ehlke of [[Triple Five Soul]] and Kenzo Minami) and renamed the property [[The Creek South Beach]]. The redevelopment and design concept was widely praised by the media, winning best hotel in Miami Beach from ''The Miami New Times''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/bestof/2003/award/best-hotel-16181/ | work=The Miami New Times | title=Best Of Awards 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite joint efforts by neighborhood associations, the City of Miami Beach and private developers, the area continues to have its ups and downs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/02/18/2074606/the-miami-beach-historic-district.html | work=Miami Herald | title=Fires Expose Struggles Of Budding Historic Arts Zone In South Beach}}{{dead link|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fields owns a 3,000-acre cattle ranch in [[Uruguay]]. Beef from the ranch was briefly imported and made available online in the United States under the Uruguay Steaks brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailycandy.com/online/article/35320/Uruguay-Steaks |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120724113330/http://www.dailycandy.com/online/article/35320/Uruguay-Steaks |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-24 |work=Daily Candy |title=What's Your Beef? }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company spokesperson and chef was Bravo TV's ''Top Chef'''s [[Lee Anne Wong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bravotv.com/top-chef/blogs/lee-anne-wong/longest-blog-ever?page=0,0&amp;nxa=blog%3ATop%20Chef%20Season%202%3AGo%20Greenmarket | work=BravoTV | title=Lee Anne Wong}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental activism===
Fields has been an active participant in a number of environmental initiatives. He is a vocal advocate for renewable energy, and solar power in particular, quoted by the media discussing tax benefits and financial incentives as an industry expert in ''[[The Miami Herald]]'' and [[Plum TV]].&lt;ref&gt;Georgia Tasker "Greening Up The House: Rebates And Tax Credits Are Motivating People To Make Their Homes More Energy Efficient"  &lt;u&gt;Miami Herald&lt;/u&gt;  April 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christina Veiga "Pricey Solar Panels Worth It In The Long Run" &lt;u&gt;Miami Herald&lt;/u&gt;  April 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He has been a strong supporter of [[Ecomb]] (The Environmental Coalition of Miami and The Beaches) and their efforts to establish the Miami Beach Center For The Environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.communitynewspapers.com/miami-beach/a-green-come-true-ecomb%E2%80%99s-center-for-the-environment/ Community News: A Green Dream Come True]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2010 he established the not-for-profit School Charging Program to donate electric vehicle [[charging station]]s to schools and other educational institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = School Charging Program: Home | url = http://www.schoolcharging.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
On November 30, 2015, in recognition of the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] Fields registered with the FEC as an Independent Presidential Candidate for 2016 although he waited until January 8, 2016 to make an official announcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://docquery.fec.gov/pdf/970/201511309004120970/201511309004120970.pdf|title=Ken Fields FEC filing|date=November 30, 2015|work=FEC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary platform of his campaign is based upon [[Mark Z. Jacobson]] and Mark Delucchi's [[The Solutions Project]] to advocate for the US to convert to 100% Renewable Energy in 20 Years. Picking as his campaign slogan, a jab at Donald Trump, "Greatness Must Be Earned".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ken-fields-announces-presidential-bid-as-an-independent-for-2016-300201099.html|title=Ken Fields Announces Presidential Bid As Independent For 2016 |website=PR Newswire |date=2016-01-08 |accessdate=2016-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fields has suggested that the effective cost of transitioning the US to 100% renewable energy would be zero, based upon a comparison of the estimated costs of renewables relative to current expenditures on energy as a percent of US GDP.

==Personal life==
Fields is married to Nutritionist and ex-Professional Volleyball player Nikki Noya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.manhattanbride.com/insights/ariston-flowers-island-theme-city/ | work=Manhattan Bride | title=Ariston Flowers An Island Theme In The City}}&lt;/ref&gt; They live between New York City and [[Lakeville, Connecticut|Lakeville CT]].

===Honorary president===
Following the 1999 season, the American and National Leagues were merged with Major League Baseball, and the leagues ceased to exist as business entities. The role of the league president was eliminated. [[Jackie Autry]], the widow of former [[Los Angeles Angels|Angels]] owner [[Gene Autry]] served as honorary president of the AL, from 2000 to 2015. Hall of Famer [[Frank Robinson]] has held the title since 2015.

This is a '''list of computer scientists''', people who do work in [[computer science]], in particular [[Research|researchers]] and authors.

Some persons notable as [[programmer]]s are included here because they work in research as well as program. A few of these people pre-date the [[invention]] of the digital computer; they are now regarded as computer scientists because their work can be seen as leading to the invention of the computer. Others are mathematicians whose work falls within what would now be called theoretical computer science, such as [[computational complexity theory|complexity theory]] and [[algorithmic information theory]].
&lt;!-- Please keep entries in alphabetical order, and give good one-liner note of accomplishments --&gt;
&lt;!-- Somebody add date of birth/death, when somebody gets time. This would add reader perspective --&gt;

He can be seen wearing [[Saskatchewan Prairie Fire|Prairie Fire]] rugby team merchandise in ''[[Corner Gas]]''.

==Career==
Cardinal has also had various other roles in theatre, film and television, some of which include ''[[Insomnia (2002 film)|Insomnia]]'', ''[[renegadepress.com]]'', ''[[Crazy Horse (film)|Crazy Horse]]'' and ''Wolf Canyon''.

Of [[Cree]] descent, he is also noted for playing [[First Nations]] roles in many productions, including [[Tecumseh]] in ''[[Canada: A People's History]]'' and an aboriginal elder in ''[[Tkaronto]]''. He also appeared on many episodes of ''[[North of 60]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wintertime.com/OH/Nof60/Interviews/lorne.html&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, Cardinal can be heard as the voice of Jacob Morin on the [[Aboriginal Peoples Television Network|APTN]] stop motion animated series ''[[Wapos Bay: The Series]]''.

In 2011, Cardinal starred alongside [[Craig Lauzon]] in a production of Kenneth T. Williams' ''Thunderstick'', in which the two traded roles on alternate days.&lt;ref name=split&gt;[http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/entertainment/arts/split--personalities-118973874.html "Split personalities: Actors stretch their thespian legs by switching roles nightly in Canadian dramedy"].

Cardinal has completed a documentary film titled ''Chasing Lear'' with producer [[Monique Hurteau]] which premiered on [[Aboriginal Peoples Television Network|APTN]] in 2016. ''[[Chasing Lear]]'' is about the [[National Arts Centre]] theatre production of ''[[King Lear]]'', with an all-Aboriginal cast which included [[August Schellenberg]] as Lear, [[Billy Merasty]], [[Jani Lauzon]], [[Tantoo Cardinal]] and [[Kevin Loring]], with Cardinal doing double-duty as both assistant director and the role of [[Duke of Albany]].

He has recently taken on the lead role in the award winning satirical short film 'No Reservations'. The film looks at pipeline politics and was created as a part of the Crazy8's film competition.

==Personal life==

==Early life==
Matlin was born in [[Morton Grove, Illinois]], to Libby (née Hammer) and Donald Matlin (1930–2013), who was an automobile dealer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmreference.com/film/9/Marlee-Matlin.html Marlee Matlin profile], FilmReference.com.

She lost all hearing in her right ear and 80% of the hearing in her left ear at the age of 18 months. In her autobiography ''I'll Scream Later'', she suggests that her hearing loss may have been due to a genetically malformed [[cochlea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Matlin|first1=Marlee|title=I'll Scream Later|date=2009|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9781439117637|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_soaGRKGBwAC&amp;pg=PT14&amp;dq=%22It+all+began+for+me+on+August+24,+1965%22#v=onepage&amp;q=genetically%20malformed&amp;f=false|language=en|pages=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is the only member of her family who is deaf.

She was later interviewed for the book ''Mazel Tov: Celebrities' Bar and Bat Mitzvah Memories''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0743287878 "Mazel Tov: Celebrities' Bar and Bat Mitzvah Memories"], Amazon.com. Retrieved February 7, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Matlin graduated from [[John Hersey High School]] in [[Arlington Heights, Illinois|Arlington Heights]] and attended [[Harper College]].&lt;ref&gt;Heidemann, Jason A. [http://www.timeout.com/chicago/article/over-out/23057/vital-signs "Vital signs"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013044809/http://www.timeout.com/chicago/article/over-out/23057/vital-signs|date=October 13, 2007}}. ''Time Out Chicago'', October 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her autobiography ''I'll Scream Later'', she described two instances when she was molested: by her babysitter at age 11, and by her teacher in high school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Matlin|first=Marlee|title=I'll Scream Later|date=2010|location=London, UK|isbn=978-1439171516|edition=First|pages= 56–61 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Matlin made her stage debut at the age of seven, as Dorothy in an [[International Center on Deafness and the Arts]] ([[ICODA]]) children's theatre of ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|The Wizard of Oz]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.4hearingloss.com/archives/2006/08/a_gateway_to_ar.html|title=A gateway to arts for the deaf|publisher=4hearingloss.com|date=August 18, 2006|accessdate=November 9, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902085100/http://www.4hearingloss.com/archives/2006/08/a_gateway_to_ar.html|archivedate = September 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continued to appear with the ICODA children's theatre group throughout her childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20094814,00.html|title=Deaf Actress Marlee Matlin Broke the Sound Barrier with New Love and Lesser God Co-Star Bill Hurt|last=Stark|first=John|date=October 20, 1986|work=People|accessdate=December 18, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006140152/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20094814,00.html|archivedate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her discovery by [[Henry Winkler]] during one of her ICODA theater performances ultimately led to her film debut in ''[[Children of a Lesser God (film)|Children of a Lesser God]]'' (1986).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greatertalent.com/matlinwinkler/|title=Why Marlee Matlin and Henry Winkler are captivating audiences|publisher=Greater Talent|accessdate=12 December 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222125057/http://www.greatertalent.com/matlinwinkler/|archivedate=December 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; That film brought her a [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Drama]] and an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. Two years later, she made a guest appearance on ''[[Sesame Street]]'' with [[Billy Joel]] performing a revised version of "[[Just the Way You Are (Billy Joel song)|Just the Way You Are]]" with lyrics by [[Tony Geiss]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} Matlin used sign language during the song and hugged [[Oscar the Grouch]] during the song's conclusion.  One year after that, Billy Joel invited her to perform in his video for "[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.billyjoel.com/news/girl-video-we-didnt-start-fire-marc-tyler-nobleman/|title=The Girl in the Video: ‘We Didn’t Start The Fire’|website=''Billyjoel.com''|author=Tyler, Marc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Matlin portrayed a deaf widow in ''Bridge to Silence''. In that role, she spoke in addition to using sign language. She was nominated for a Golden Globe for her work as the lead female role in the television series ''[[Reasonable Doubts]]'' (1991–1993). Matlin was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] for a guest appearance in ''[[Picket Fences]]'' (1992) and became a regular on that series during its final season (1996). She played [[Carrie Buck]] in the 1994 television drama ''Against Her Will: The Carrie Buck Story'', based on the 1927 [[United States Supreme Court]] case ''[[Buck v. Bell]]'' 274 U.S. 200. In that role, Matlin portrayed a hearing woman for the first time in her career, which earned her a CableACE Nomination as Best Actress.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Matlin later had recurring roles in ''[[The West Wing]]'', and ''[[Blue's Clues]]''.

In 2002, Matlin published her first novel, titled ''Deaf Child Crossing,'' which was loosely based on her own childhood. She later wrote and published a sequel titled ''Nobody's Perfect'', produced on stage at the John F. Kennedy Center for Performing Arts in partnership with VSA Arts in October 2007. In 2004, she starred in the movie ''[[What the Bleep Do We Know!?]]'' as Amanda.

In 2006, she played a deaf parent in ''[[Desperate Housewives]]''. She had a recurring role as [[Joy Turner]]'s (who made many jokes about Matlin's deafness at her expense) public defender in ''[[My Name Is Earl]]'' and played the mother of one of the victims in an episode of ''[[CSI: NY]].'' That same year, Matlin was cast in season 4 of ''[[The L Word]]'' as [[Jodi Lerner]], a [[lesbian]] sculptor. She appeared in season 4 (2007), season 5 (2008), and season 6 (2009) as the girlfriend of one of the show's protagonists, [[Bette Porter]], played by [[Jennifer Beals]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

On May 6, 2009, Matlin received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laindependent.com/news/44496947.html "Marlee Matlin receives Walk of Fame star"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930060422/http://www.laindependent.com/news/44496947.html|date=September 30, 2011}}, ''The Los Angeles Independent'', May 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 8, 2009, Matlin appeared on ''Seth &amp; Alex's Almost Live Comedy Show'', hosted by [[Seth MacFarlane]] and [[Alex Borstein]]. After Borstein imitated Matlin calling MovieFone and singing "[[Poker Face (Lady Gaga song)|Poker Face]]," Matlin herself appeared and launched into a comical tirade against Borstein over being made fun of, and how she was not invited to provide her own voice for ''[[Family Guy]].'' Matlin went on to voice Stella, [[Peter Griffin]]'s coworker, in the Season 10 episode "[[The Blind Side (Family Guy)|The Blind Side]];" Stella later became a recurring character.

In 2010, Matlin produced a pilot for a reality show she titled ''My Deaf Family,'' which she presented to various national network executives. Although they expressed interest, no network purchased rights to the show. On March 29, 2010, Matlin uploaded the pilot to YouTube and launched a viral marketing campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.aol.com/2010/03/31/marlee-matlin-launches-my-deaf-family-on-youtube|title=Marlee Matlin Launches '&amp;#39;My Deaf Family'&amp;#39; on YouTube|publisher=Insidetv.aol.com|date=March 31, 2010|accessdate=October 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 26, 2010, Matlin signed a speech at an event commemorating the 20th anniversary of the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/photos-and-video/video/20th-anniversary-americans-with-disabilities-act 20th Anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act], The White House.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702174208/http://www.whitehouse.gov/photos-and-video/video/20th-anniversary-americans-with-disabilities-act|date=July 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, on one episode of ''The Celebrity Apprentice'', "The Art of the Deal", which was transmitted on April 3, 2011, she raised more funds than had ever been raised for charity in a single event on any television show before, $986,000.&lt;ref name="disabled-world1"&gt;[http://www.disabled-world.com/disability/types/hearing/marlee-matlin.php "SignTalk Joins Fundraiser for Marlee Matlin's Cause..."], disabled-world.com, May 12, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donald Trump]], who was then hosting ''The Celebrity Apprentice,'' then donated an additional $14,000 to make the contribution an even million.&lt;ref name="disabled-world1"/&gt;

In 2013, Matlin played herself in ''[[No Ordinary Hero: The SuperDeafy Movie]]''. As of January 2015, Matlin also acted as the [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]]'s celebrity ambassador for disability rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aclu.org/ambassadors|title= ACLU Ambassadors – Marlee Matlin|publisher=aclu.olrg (American Civil Liberties Union)|accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a "celebrity ambassador" for the ACLU, in attempts to bridge the gap between law enforcement and the deaf community, Matlin discussed the communication barriers when deaf individuals are stopped by the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/video/marlee-matlin-deaf-and-police-interaction|title=Marlee Matlin on Deaf And Police Interaction|date=March 22, 2018|website=ACLU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matlin attended the 1987 Oscars to present the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]].&lt;ref name="I'll Scream Later"&gt;{{cite book|isbn=1-4391-7151-3|title=I'll Scream Later |author=Marlee Matlin, Betsy Sharkey |publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After signing her introduction in [[ASL]], she spoke aloud the "names of the nominees" and of [[Michael Douglas]], the winner.&lt;ref name="I'll Scream Later"/&gt; &lt;!-- The next few sentences don't make sense, unless we explain WHY the (unnamed) 'members' objected. The reader is left to speculate that some Deaf people don't want other Deaf people EVER to speak&amp;nbsp;– or to speak to the non-Deaf in a way that relieves the latter of the obligation to learn sign language. Many members of the [[Deaf culture|Deaf community]] considered their hopes for validation through Matlin's emissary "dashed," and [[Silent News]], "the biggest newspaper for the Deaf," headlined her use of speech as potentially "offensive."&lt;ref name="I'll Scream Later"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Through Deaf Eyes"&gt;{{cite book|title=Through Deaf Eyes |author=Lawrence R.

Wilson |work=The New York Times |date=April 13, 1988 |accessdate=April 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matlin, who has described her personal identity as "a lot more than Deaf," was shocked by commentary on the event, which constituted a dynamic shift from when she "was widely praised by the Deaf community" for supporting the Gallaudet University [[Deaf President Now]] campaign on [[Nightline]] earlier in 1988.&lt;ref name="I'll Scream Later"/&gt; --&gt;

On April 14, 2009, Matlin released an autobiography, ''I'll Scream Later''. In it, she describes her drug abuse and how it drove her to check herself into the [[Betty Ford Center]]. She also tells about her rocky, two-year relationship with her significantly older ''Children of a Lesser God'' co-star [[William Hurt]], who she claims was physically abusive to her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=William Hurt |url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b118626_william_hurt_marlee_matlin_i_apologize.html |title=William Hurt to Marlee Matlin: "I Apologize for Any Pain I Caused" |publisher=E! |date=April 14, 2009 |accessdate=October 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also addresses the sexual abuse she suffered as a child at the hands of her female babysitter.&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marleematlinsite.com/books/books.html Marlee Matlin website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070523061456/http://www.marleematlinsite.com/books/books.html |date=May 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/Movies/04/14/lkl.marlee.matlin/index.html "Marlee Matlin: Baby sitter's abuse led to life of drugs, violence"].

She enjoys a sense of humor about her deafness: "Often I’m talking to people through my speaker phone, and after 10 minutes or so they say, 'Wait a minute, Marlee, how can you hear me?' They forget I have an interpreter there who is signing to me as they talk. So I say, 'You know what? I can hear on Wednesdays.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://abilitymagazine.com/past/Marleem/Marleem.html|title = ''Ability Magazine: Marlee Matlin Story''|accessdate = November 9, 2015|last = Sterman|first = Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Helling|first1=Steve|title=Marlee Matlin Addresses Reports that Donald Trump Called Her 'Retarded': 'The Term is Abhorrent'|url=http://people.com/politics/marlee-matlin-speaks-out-about-reports-that-donald-trump-called-her-retarded/|work=People|date=October 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2945">'''Mohammed Hayef Al-Mutairi''' is a member of the [[National Assembly of Kuwait|Kuwaiti National Assembly]], representing the fourth district. Born in 1964, Al-Mutairi studied Islamic studies and served in the Kuwait Municipality before being elected to the National Assembly in 2008.  While political parties are technically illegal in Kuwait, Al-Mutairi affiliates with Islamist deputies.  

==Pro-Hijab Walkout==
On June 1, 2008, Al-Mutairi, [[Waleed AlـTabtabaie]], [[Jamaan Al-Harbash]], and six other MPs walked out of the swearing in ceremony of Modhi al-Homoud and Nouria al-Subeih, two new female Cabinet ministers who were not wearing headscarves.  Al-Mutairi said that the two female ministers "were not abiding by sharia."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0618/p01s07-wome.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/06/01/news/Kuwait-Women-Parliament.php]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposed Guaranteeing Bank Deposits==
On October 28, 2008, the parliament voted 50-7 to insure all types of deposits in all local banks within Kuwait.  Al-Mutairi opposed the bill, along with [[Jabir Al-Azmi]], [[Hussein AlـQallaf Al-Bahraini]], [[Daifallah Bouramiya]], [[Mohammed Al-Obaid]], [[Musallam AlـBarrak]] and [[Waleed AlـTabtabaie]].  Al-Mutairi accused the Cabinet of speeding up the bill's passage for the benefit of monetary tycoons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zawya.com/Story.cfm/sidZAWYA20081030091011/Kuwait%20ready%20to%20recapitalize%20Gulf%20Bank/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Request to Grill Prime Minister Nasser==
In November 2008, Al-Mutairi joined with fellow Islamist MPs [[Waleed AlـTabtabaie]] and [[Mohammed AlـMutair]] in filing a [[Kuwait National Assembly No-Confidence Votes|request to grill]] Prime Minister [[Nasser Mohammed Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah]] for allowing prominent Iranian Shiite cleric [[Mohammad Baqir al-Fali]] to enter Kuwait despite a legal ban.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20081116/wl_mideast_afp/kuwaitpoliticsreligioniran_081116163425 Al-Tabtabaie on PM Nasser]&lt;/ref&gt; The ban was later repealed by the state court-system.

==Protested Against Israeli Attacks==
On December 28, 2008, Kuwaiti lawmakers [[Mikhled Al-Azmi]], [[Musallam Al-Barrak]], [[Marzouq Al-Ghanim]], [[Jaaman Al-Harbash]], [[Ahmad Al-Mulaifi]], Mohammad Hayef Al-Mutairi, [[Ahmad Al-Saadoun]], [[Nasser Al-Sane]], and [[Waleed Al-Tabtabaie]] protested in front of the National Assembly building against the attacks by [[Israel]] on [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]].  Protesters burned Israeli flags, waved banners reading, "No to hunger, no to submission" and chanted "Allahu Akbar". Israel launched air strikes against [[Hamas]] in the Gaza Strip on December 26 after a six-month ceasefire ended on December 18.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unnindia.com/english/story.php?Id=3746]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''mySky''' is a personal [[astronomy]] tool made by [[Meade Instruments]]. When pointed at an area of sky, it can identify objects based on its built-in database of 30000 objects. It can also guide the user to a particular object from its database. It has an [[LCD]] display, incorporates [[GPS]] technology and can be linked to a compatible Meade computer-controllable [[telescope]]. Note, however, that mySky is not a telescope or observing instrument.

The current model of this device no longer incorporates the GPS functionality. There were lots of complaints about that feature not working. Now, apparently, you either enter your Lat/Long manually or select from a list of cities.

[[File:NellieCameron 1930.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Nellie Cameron in 1930]]
'''Nellie Cameron''' (1910–1953), known as "The Kiss of Death Girl", was a notorious [[Sydney]] prostitute in the 1920s and 1930s, who was featured extensively in the 2011 Australian television mini-series ''[[Underbelly: Razor]]''. Cameron was associated with the [[cocaine]]-fuelled ravages of the [[razor gang]] violence of that era, commonly associated with her contemporaries, [[Tilly Devine]] and [[Kate Leigh]], both criminal entrepreneurs who controlled much of Sydney's illegal sex industry and [[sly-grog shop|Sly-grog]] distribution during that period. Nellie Cameron received 73 criminal convictions during her life of crime, mainly for [[solicitation|soliciting]] and [[vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]], and had the distinction of becoming the first woman in Australia to be convicted of consorting with criminals.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1910"&gt;"Ellen Katherine (Nellie) Cameron (1910–1953)", Obituaries Australia, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, [http://oa.anu.edu.au/obituary/cameron-ellen-katherine-nellie-13635/text24396 'Ellen Katherine (Nellie) Cameron (1910–1953)'], accessed 7 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
'''Ellen (Nellie) Katherine Kelly''' was born in the inner city [[Sydney, NSW|Sydney]] suburb of [[Waterloo, New South Wales|Waterloo]] in 1910, the youngest child of Colin Kelly, who later served in the [[First Australian Imperial Force|AIF]] in [[World War I]], and Lillian Kelly (née Ruddock),&lt;ref&gt;Name: Nellie K Kelly Birth Date: 1910  Father's Name: Colin Kelly Mother's Name: Lilian Birth Place: New South Wales Registration Year: 1910 Registration Place: Waterloo, New South Wales Registration Number: 33377 Ancestry.com. Australia Birth Index, 1788–1922.&lt;/ref&gt; and the sister of Lionel, who was born in 1907,&lt;ref&gt;NSW Birth Index Registration  No. 2604.&lt;/ref&gt; but died soon after,&lt;ref&gt;NSW Death Index Registration No 14934.&lt;/ref&gt; and William Colin, who was born in 1908,&lt;ref&gt;NSW Birth Index Registration No 30918&lt;/ref&gt; but who died of [[meningitis|cerebral meningitis]] on 5 December 1910 in Bulli Cottage Hospital, NSW.&lt;ref&gt;NSW Death Registration No 16149.&lt;/ref&gt; Colin Kelly was later divorced by his wife, Lillian Kelly, on the grounds of desertion.&lt;ref&gt;''Sydney Morning Herald'' (Wednesday, 13 September 1922):8. The divorce is Registered No 1181/21R.G. Department No 9504/22, Wife Petitioner. This divorce detail is entered in the Comments Field on the Marriage Certificate of Colin Kelly to Lillian Ruddock NSW Marriage Registration No 03247/1907.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Nellie's mother married Robert George Cameron in 1922, Nellie took her stepfather's surname for most of her adult life.&lt;ref&gt;NSW Births, Deaths &amp; Marriage – Nellie K. Kelly, Birth Reference No. 33377/1910, District of Waterloo.&lt;/ref&gt; Cameron was a Roman Catholic&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallery.records.nsw.gov.au/wp-content/gallery/tilly-devine/2497_14_3137_792_nellie.jpg Admission Record, Nellie Cameron, State Reformatory] 29 July 1930.&lt;/ref&gt; and was educated at an exclusive girls' school on the [[North Shore (Sydney)|North Shore]].

In 1926 Cameron ran away from home,&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallery.records.nsw.gov.au/index.php/galleries/people-of-interest/tilly-devine-the-razor-gang-wars-1927-31/ Tilly Devine &amp; the Razor Gang Wars, 1927–31]&lt;/ref&gt; caught a train to the city, seduced a married tram driver, and began living with him in [[Woolloomooloo]].&lt;ref&gt;Toby Creswell, ''Notorious Australians'' (Angus &amp; Robertson, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

=="The Kiss of Death Girl"==
When Cameron began her career in prostitution in 1926 in Sydney's [[Surry Hills]] and Woolloomooloo districts at the age of fifteen, she was a blue-eyed blonde. Soon Cameron became Sydney's most popular and most expensive prostitute and was known as Sydney's Underworld Beauty Queen and also as the "Kiss Of Death Girl" or "The Angel Of Death",&lt;ref&gt;According to Larry Writer's book ''Razor'' (on which ''[[Underbelly: Razor]]'' was based), it was another popular Sydney prostitute of the time, 'Pretty' [[Dulcie Markham]], who was better known as the Angel of Death.&lt;/ref&gt; as most of her boyfriends or husbands were subsequently murdered. During her years in crime, Cameron was kidnapped, beaten, stabbed, razor slashed, and shot on numerous occasions.

Early in 1927 when Cameron met [[Norman Bruhn]] (1894–1927), a [[Melbourne]]-born dockworker and gunman, thief, standover man and pimp feared for his [[garroting|garroting skills]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.razorhurst.com.au/tour_3.html Norman Bruhn]&lt;/ref&gt; who was forced to leave Melbourne by rival gunman [[Squizzy Taylor]] in November 1926, she was described as "a redhead with a ripe figure and provocative china blue eyes".&lt;ref&gt;James Morton and Susanna Lobez, ''Gangland Australia'' (Victory Books, 2010):71–72.&lt;/ref&gt; At that time Cameron was a street prostitute on William and Palmer Streets with no connection to [[Tilly Devine]] or any other [[madam]]. Despite having a wife and children, Bruhn soon became Cameron's lover and pimp, although she also worked as a dance instructor at Professor Bolot's Academy in Sydney's [[Oxford Street, Sydney|Oxford Street]], commuting between Sydney and [[Queensland]] on a regular basis. According to Larry Writer, Cameron "perfected the age-old game called 'gingering' in Australia. During sex with one of her clients, an accomplice would emerge from beneath the bed and take the client's wallet from his pants or jacket. At that point, coitus would be interrupted by angry banging on the door by another involved in the scam, Cameron, feigning panic, would exclaim it was the police or her irate husband, and urge the client to dress and depart by the back door. Keen to avoid the embarrassment of public prosecution or a beating, the customer would flee and usually not notice until later that his wallet was missing." Cameron also was a cocaine runner and a [[Fence (criminal)|fence]] for stolen property. Bruhn, who attempted to dominate the duopolised gangland milieu, was shot twice in the stomach outside a sly grog den in Charlotte Lane, [[Darlinghurst]] on 22 June 1927 by a hit squad sent by either Devine or [[Kate Leigh]].&lt;ref&gt;Morton and Lobez, 2007:71–72,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1927"&gt;"GANG WARFARE. Darlinghurst Murder. Few Clues", ''Sydney Morning Herald'' (24 June 1927):11.&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently died in the early hours of 23 June 1927.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.razorhurst.com.au/tour_6.html Bruhn's Death Wish]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within weeks of Bruhn's death, Cameron began a series of relationships with a successive string of other Sydney criminals: Ernest Lyle Connelly (1903–1969), shot in Womerah Avenue, [[Kings Cross, New South Wales|Kings Cross]] by rival gunman and future husband, Guido Caletti (or Calletti) in February 1929;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1927"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Morton and Susanna Lobez, ''Gangland Australia'' (Victory Books, 2010):84.&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand-born [[housebreaker]] and [[extortion|standover man]] Alan Edward (Ted) Pulley, later shot dead by illegal bookmaker Florrie Riley at Wentworth Street, [[Glebe]] on 6 March 1937;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1927"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Morton and Susanna Lobez, ''Gangland Australia'' (Victory Books, 2010):84–85.&lt;/ref&gt; and Francis Donald (Frank) Green, (1902–1956),&lt;ref&gt;Green was stabbed to death on 26 April 1956 during an altercation with his live-in lover, Beatrice "Bobbie" Haggett. See James Morton and Susanna Lobez, ''Gangland Australia'' (Victory Books, 2010):144.&lt;/ref&gt; Caletti's rival for Cameron's affections.&lt;ref name="Morton and Lobez, 2007: 85; 95–6"&gt;Morton and Lobez, 2007: 85; 95–6&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 June 1931 Cameron, Green, and William Hourigan visited the [[Maroubra, New South Wales|Maroubra]] home of James Edward "Big Jim" Devine that he shared with his wife, [[Tilly Devine]]. After an altercation, Devine shot at the fleeing Cameron, Green, and Hourigan, and accidentally killed a taxi driver. Subsequently, on 11 July 1931 Green, Horigan and Cameron were charged with "robbery under arms", being accused of having assaulted Devine, whilst armed with a revolver, and robbing him of a diamond tiepin valued at £50.&lt;ref&gt;"Alleged Theft of Tiepin", ''The Sydney Morning Herald'' (Monday, 13 July 1931):11.&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 September the charges against Cameron and Hourigan were dismissed due to lack of evidence.&lt;ref&gt;"Maroubra Affray", ''The Canberra Times'' (Wednesday, 16 September 1931):1.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 November 1931, after visiting her then de facto husband Frank Green at [[St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney|St. Vincent's Hospital]] where he was in a serious condition after being shot in the stomach,  Nellie Cameron was herself shot in the shoulder in Burton Street, [[East Sydney, New South Wales|East Sydney]] whilst walking home from the hospital. Later, she refused to cooperate with police.&lt;ref&gt;"WOMAN SHOT. Underworld Feud. No information for police", ''Sydney Morning Herald'', (17 November  1931):9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cameron's first marriage was to the feared Sydney gangland figure Guido Caletti (1900–1939), who was the leader of a vicious Sydney gang known as the "Darlinghurst Push". The couple had fled New South Wales to Victoria due to outstanding arrest warrants. They married at the local registry office at [[Fitzroy, Victoria]] on 20 February 1934 with Nellie using her birth name, Ellen Kelly.&lt;ref&gt;Victoria BDM, "Guido Caletti &amp; Ellen Kelly". Marriage Registration No. 1715/1934. District of Fitzroy.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1934 Caletti was imprisoned for two years, and Cameron renewed her relationship with Frank Green.

In July 1937 Cameron was charged with maliciously shooting at Harry Roper the previous month.&lt;ref&gt;"WOMAN CHARGED WITH MALICIOUS SHOOTING", ''Barrier Miner'' (Broken Hill, NSW: Thursday 15 July 1937):3.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Cameron was working as a prostitute in Queensland, Cameron's husband Guido Caletti was shot dead allegedly by two rival gunmen, Robert Branch and George Allan, at a party in Brougham Street, [[East Sydney, New South Wales|East Sydney]] on 6 August 1939.&lt;ref name="Morton and Lobez, 2007: 85; 95–6"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NSW BDM, Guido CALETTI, Death Reg No: 13849/1939 District Of Sydney.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Shooting In House. Death Of Guido Calletti – Witnesses Story", ''Sydney Morning Herald'', (22 September 1939):14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940 Cameron married Charles Francis "Greyhound" Bourke (1909–1964) (also known as Edward Brown and MacRogers),&lt;ref&gt;James Morton and Susanna Lobez, ''Gangland Australia'' (Victory Books, 2010):82.&lt;/ref&gt; another notorious Sydney criminal and gunman, at Sydney, using her then married name of Ellen Catherine Caletti.&lt;ref&gt;NSW BDM Marriage Registration No: 7695/1940. Charles Francis BOURKE and Ellen Catherine CALETTI. District of Sydney&lt;/ref&gt; The couple separated a few years later, although she retained the surname of Bourke until her death in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;Bourke was allegedly shot dead by [[Lenny McPherson]] outside his [[Randwick, New South Wales|Randwick]] home on 9 February 1964. See Tony Reeves, ''Mr BIG. The true story of Lennie McPherson'' (Allen &amp; Unwin, 2005), {{ISBN|1-74114-516-3}} and David Hickie, ''Chow Hayes Gunman'' (Harper Collins, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

About 1947 Cameron adopted Janice,&lt;ref name="Woman 1954"&gt;"Story Of Woman's Gas Death", ''Sydney Morning Herald'' (26 January 1954):7.&lt;/ref&gt; the infant daughter of a neighbour, and raised her conscientiously.&lt;ref&gt;James Morton and Susanna Lobez, ''Gangland Australia'' (Victory Books, 2010):136.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years and death==
During 1951 Cameron began living with William Francis Donohue (born about 1922), a wharf labourer,&lt;ref name="Woman 1954"/&gt; at 17 Denham Street, [[Taylor Square, Sydney|Taylor Square]]. On 31 March 1952, Cameron was attacked at her flat by Donohue, who shot her in the stomach. Cameron was admitted to St Vincent's Hospital in a critical condition with a bullet lodged in her liver.

Accessed 15 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; was a British community leader and activist in the [[feminist]], [[black nationalist]], and [[squatter]]s' rights campaigns of the 1970s in the [[United Kingdom]].

==Early life==
Olive Morris was born in 1952 in Harewood, [[Saint Catherine Parish|St Catherine]], [[Jamaica]], to Doris (''née'' Moseley) and Vincent Nathaniel Morris, and moved to [[London]], [[England]], with her family at the age of nine.&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt; She lived predominantly in South London.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;She had three brothers and two sisters.{{Cite web |title=Do you remember Olive Morris? |author= Sheila Ruiz|publisher=BBC News |date=16 October 2009 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/london/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8310000/8310579.stm |accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leaving school without qualifications, she later went on to study at the [[London College of Printing]].&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt;

==Adult Life &amp; Activism==
===Police abuse of Nigerian diplomat Clement Gomwalk 1969===
On November 15, 1969, Nigerian Diplomat Clement Gomwalk was confronted by police while parked outside the Desmond's Hip City record store.&lt;ref name=FOMITA&gt;Tanisha C. Ford (2016) [https://doi.org/10.1080/00064246.2016.1147937 "Finding Olive Morris in the Archive"], The Black Scholar, 46:2, 5-18, DOI: 10.1080/00064246.2016.1147937.
&lt;/ref&gt; The police dragged him out of his car to interrogate him and then when unsatisfied by his responses continued to beat him as a crowd formed around them to witness the police brutality.
'''There are different accounts of Morris' involvement which are stated below'''

====Aymo Martin Tajo's Account&lt;ref name=FOMITA /&gt;====
Local Journalist Aymo Martin Tajo states that Morris "broke to the crowd to the scuffle" and "tried to physically stop the police from beating the Nigerian", the police reaction being to beat her also.

====Olive Morris' Account&lt;ref name=FOMITA /&gt;====
Morris' account stated that she did not arrive till after the diplomat had been taken away by the police. The situation with the police escalated after the crowd began to confront the police about their brutality. She recals her friend being dragged into the record store by police shouting "I've done nothing". She does not state how she got involved but does state that she was brutally beaten.
Her account goes on to describe her treatment in prison. She was forced to strip and was threatened with rape in police custody; "They all made me take off my jumper and my bra in front of them to show I was a girl. A male cop holding a billy club said, ‘Now prove you’re a real woman.’" referencing his billy club he stated: "Look it’s the right colour and the right size for you. Black cunt!"

Olive's brother Basil Morris described her injuries from the incident and time with the police: "could hardly recognize her face, they beat her so badly."&lt;ref name=FOMITA /&gt;

She was arrested, fined £10 and given a suspended sentence. The charges were: assault on the police, threatening behaviour, and possession of dangerous weapons.&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt;&lt;ref name=FOMITA /&gt;

===Black Panther Movement===
In the early 1970's Olive became a member of the youth section of the [[British Black Panthers|British Black Panther Movement]] (later the Black Workers movement), alongside [[Linton Kwesi Johnson]], Clovis Reid, and [[Farrukh Dhondy]].&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt;
In August 1972 she and a friend, Liz Obi, planned to visit the American Black Panther leader, Eldridge Cleaver, who was in exile in Algeria, but they became stranded in Morocco.&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt;

===Brixton Black Women's Group===
She was a founding member of the Brixton Black Women's Group.&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt;

===121 Railton Road, Brixton===
Olive squatted at 121 Railton Road, Brixton with her friend Liz Obi in 1973. This squat became a hub of political activism and hosted community groups such as Black People against State Harassment. The sit remained a social centre and a centre for the squatting movement until its closure in 1999.&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt;

====Sabarr Bookshop====
121 Railton Road was also the site of the Sabarr Bookshop, one of the first black community bookshops.&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt; It was set up by a group of black men and women in brixton that included Olive Morris.&lt;ref name=BWLB&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=xmJjDwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PT13&amp;dq=%22olive+morris%22&amp;ots=OPdWkFFaVP&amp;sig=p994xGjuF5KcFtUmENSQpoMvkCc#v=onepage&amp;q=%22olive%20morris%22&amp;f=false "The Heart of the Race: Black Women's Lives in Britain"] by Beverley Bryan, Stella Dadzie, Suzanne Scafe, Verso Books, 14 Aug 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

===Study in Manchester===
Olive studied at Manchester University between 1975 and 1978. Her activism did not take a break in the absence of London. She became involved in the Manchester Black Women's Co-operative and the Black Women's Mutual Aid Group&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Do you remember Olive Morris?|author= Red Chidgey | work=Red Pepper | date=25 July 2010 | url=http://www.redpepper.org.uk/do-you-remember-olive-morris/ | accessdate =26 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as establishing a supplementary school after campaigning with local black parents for better education provision for their children.&lt;ref name=BCA&gt;[https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/search/archives/08613eed-16a9-390e-bef4-b15f0ddc5ec0 "Black Cultural Archives"] Olive Morris Administrative / Biographical History, 1977-2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organisation of Women of African and Asian Descent (OWAAD)===
She was a founding member of the [[Organisation of Women of African and Asian Descent]] (OWAAD) in London. OWAAD held its first conference at the Abeng centre on Gresham Road in Brixton, a centre that Morris had helped to establish along with Elaine Holness and other members of the community.&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt;&lt;ref name=BCA /&gt;&lt;ref name=BWLB /&gt;

==Death==
Olive became ill during a trip to Spain in 1978. when she returned to the UK, she was diagnosed with [[Non-Hodgkin lymphoma]]. She underwent treatment which was unsuccessful. She passed away on the 12th of July 1979 at St Thomas's Hospital, Lambeth and was buried in Streatham Vale cemetery. She was 27 years old.&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt;

==Recognition &amp; Legacy==
[[Lambeth Council]] named one of its key buildings after her, in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Olive Morris House | publisher=Lambeth Council | url=https://www.lambeth.gov.uk/places/brixton-customer-centre-olive-morris-house | accessdate =24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The naming of the building followed the Brixton Uprising in 1981 and further riots in 1985. Both riots were fuelled by the killing of black people by police, some see it as an attempt by the council to appease the black community or, in a more positive spin, show the council's future commitment to reconciliation.&lt;ref name=FOMITA /&gt; A play area and garden for the community was also named after her in Myatt's Feilds.&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt;

Morris is depicted on the B£1 denomination of the [[Brixton Pound]], a [[local currency]] in [[Brixton]], London.

Lopez de la Torre launched the "Remember Olive Morris" blog in 2007.&lt;ref name=FOMITA /&gt;
As Lopez started to team up with other women, in October 2008 the Remembering Olive Collective (ROC) was started.&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt;&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt;

In 2011 the Olive Morris memorial award was launched to give bursaries to young black women.&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt;

In 2018, in celebration of the 100th anniversary of women's right to vote, ''[[The Voice (newspaper)|The Voice]]'' newspaper listed Olive Morris – alongside Kathleen Wrasama, [[Connie Mark]], [[Fanny Eaton]], [[Diane Abbott]], [[Lilian Bader]], [[Margaret Busby]], and [[Mary Seacole]] – among eight Black women who have contributed to the development of Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Leah Sinclair, [http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/suffrage-100-black-women-who-changed-british-history "Suffrage 100: The Black Women Who Changed British History"], ''The Voice'', 6 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; She was also named by the ''[[Evening Standard]]'' on a list of 14 "Inspirational black British women throughout history" (alongside Mary Seacole, [[Claudia Jones]], [[Adelaide Hall]], Margaret Busby, [[Joan Armatrading]], [[Tessa Sanderson]], [[Doreen Lawrence]], [[Maggie Aderin-Pocock]], [[Sharon White (civil servant)|Sharon White]], [[Malorie Blackman]], Diane Abbott, [[Zadie Smith]] and Connie Mark.&lt;ref&gt;Georgia Chambers, [https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/inspirational-black-british-women-a3957576.html "Inspirational black British women throughout history"], ''Evening Standard'', 11 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:UnionPowderMonkey.jpg|thumb|upright|A powder monkey on a Union vessel during the [[American Civil War]], circa. 1864]]

A '''powder boy''' or '''powder monkey''' manned [[naval artillery]] guns as a member of a warship's crew, primarily during the [[Age of Sail]]. His chief role was to ferry [[gunpowder]] from the [[Magazine_(artillery)#Naval_magazines|powder magazine]] in the ship's hold to the artillery pieces, either in bulk or as cartridges, to minimize the risk of fires and explosions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Costello|first=R.|title=Black Salt: Seafarers of African Descent on British Ships|year=2012|publisher=Liverpool University Press|isbn=1-846-31818-1|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Callo|first=Joseph|title=John Paul Jones:Africa's First Sea Warrior|year=2009|publisher=Naval Institute Press|isbn=1-591-14104-4|page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Tucker, Spencer C.|title=The Encyclopedia of the Wars of the Early American Republic, 1783–1812: A Political, Social, and Military History|year=2014|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=1-598-84157-2|page=463}}&lt;/ref&gt; The function was usually fulfilled by [[boy seaman|boy seamen]] of 12 to 14 years of age. Powder monkeys were usually boys or young teens, selected for the job for their speed and height: they were short and could move more easily in the limited space between decks and would also be hidden behind the ship's [[gunwale]], keeping them from being shot by enemy ships' sharp shooters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lenfestey|first=Tom|others=Lenfestey, Thompson |title=The Sailor's Illustrated Dictionary|year=2001|publisher=Globe Pequot|isbn=1-585-74281-3|page=341}}&lt;/ref&gt; These powder monkeys held no official naval rank on the ships that they sailed on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nelson's Navy: The Ships, Men and Organization 1793-1815|last=Lavery|first=Brian|publisher=Conway Maritime Press LTD|year=1989|isbn=0-87021-258-3|location=24 Bride Lane, Fleet Street London, UK|pages=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some women and older men also worked as powder monkeys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodwin|first=Peter |title=Nelson's Victory: 101 Questions &amp; Answers about HMS Victory, Nelson's Flagship at Trafalgar, 1805|year=2004|publisher=Naval Institute Press|isbn=1-591-14615-1|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the powder monkeys in the British Navy that ended up on ships were part of the poor working class. The [[Marine Society]] that promoted youths to join the [[British Royal Navy]] recruited them by providing clothes, bedding, and a rudimentary education. In the mid-1790s it is estimated that the Marine Society was sending five or six hundred boys a year to the fleet although not all of these boys became powder monkeys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nelson's Navy: The Ships, men and Organization 1793-1815|last=Lavery|first=Brian|publisher=Conway Maritime Press LTD|year=1989|isbn=0-87021-258-3|location=24 Bride Lane, Fleet Street London, UK|pages=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the boys who were recruited by the Marine Society; most had no other option than to join the navy as their parents could not afford to raise them. However a significant amount had familial ties to the sea. This group had cousins, fathers, and even grandfathers were sailors thus making them want to continue family traditions and exploit their sense of adventure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Thirty Years From Home: A Seamen's View of the War of 1812|last=Leech|first=Samuel|publisher=Fireship Press|year=2008|isbn=1-934757-38-1|location=P.O. Box 68412 Tuscon, AZ 85737|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States did not have an established navy until after its independence in 1776 and even then it was loosely organized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The U.S. Navy: A History (3rd edition)|last=Miller|first=Nathan|publisher=Naval Institute Press|year=1997|isbn=1-55750-595-0|location=Annapolis, MD|pages=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The United States Navy]] started using powder monkeys in the late 1700s after modeling its structure off of the Royal Navy. The nations fought against each other in the [[War of 1812]].

Purple Mark usually dresses and dyes his hair, beard and other hair on his body, such as on his eyebrows and arm-hair, in accord with the cycle of the seasons: blue and purple in the winter, then the weather warms up green, yellow, and orange, then red in the autumn before cycling back to his winter colors.&lt;ref name=Murakami /&gt; The process of applying the dye takes about four hours when he changes color, with two hours every two weeks for touch-up for "vibrancy."&lt;ref name=Jonjak /&gt; He also attempts to eat and drink along a similar pattern of color.&lt;ref name=Murakami /&gt; By his own account, the name "Purple Mark" predates his colorful self-presentation, dating back to when he was hit by a purple streak of lightning on [[Mount Sneffels]] in Colorado at age 11.&lt;ref name=Murakami /&gt; He moved to Seattle in 1985.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} He has said he was first influenced to dye his hair by the wild styles he saw around [[Pike Place Market]], but soon went well beyond the street fashion of the time to develop his unique look.&lt;ref name=Murakami /&gt;   On another occasion he explained his rainbow tones as originally springing from observation of the sun's rays coming through his eyelids: "Your vision attempts to correct this color to white, and some hair had fallen across my eyes, so when I opened them, my hair appeared bright green. I thought to myself: 'I'm gonna do that.'"&lt;ref name=Jonjak /&gt;

From 1994 to at least 2007, he worked in the [[Ballard, Seattle|Ballard]] neighborhood in what was basically an [[assembly line]] job at motor oil and fuel additives company [[Bardahl]].&lt;ref name=Murakami /&gt; Most of his wardrobe is purchased second-hand or made by himself.&lt;ref name=Jonjak /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cohen&gt;{{cite AV media |first=Ari Seth |last=Cohen |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oh6AiPyFYEw |title=PurpleMarkSeattle |type=short documentary film |date=August 3, 2012 |accessdate=December 17, 2012}} Also available as ''[http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Video?show=14986139 Advanced Style: Seattle's Purple Mark]'' on the site of ''The Stranger'', dated October 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He brings a variety of techniques to making his own outfits, ranging from dying human-hair wigs to [[metalsmithing]], in which he has a degree.&lt;ref name=Cohen /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2982">'''Richard M. Bowen III''' is an American banker who [[Whistleblowers|blew the whistle]] on [[mortgage fraud]] at [[Citigroup]] that helped trigger the [[sub-prime mortgage crisis]].

A senior vice president at Citigroup, Bowen served as the chief underwriter of the [[financial services]] conglomerate's Consumer Lending Group. Bowen's responsibility was essentially to serve as the quality control supervisor ensuring the unit's creditworthiness. Beginning in June 2006, Bowen began warning the board of directors about the extreme risks being taken on by the mortgage operation that could potentially result in massive losses.

His group bought and sold $90 billion of residential mortgages annually. When Bowen first blew the whistle in 2006, 60% of the mortgages were defective. The amount of bad mortgages began increasing throughout 2007 and eventually exceeded 80% of the volume. Many of the mortgages were not only defective, but [[Mortgage fraud|were fraudulent]].

Bowen attempted to rouse the board via weekly reports and other communications. On 3 November 2007, Bowen emailed Citigroup Chairman Robert Rubin and the bank's [[chief financial officer]], head auditor and the risk management officer to again expose the risk and potential losses, claiming that the group's internal controls had broken down. He requested an outside investigation of his business unit. The investigation revealed that Bowen was right, and that the Consumer Lending Group had suffered a breakdowns of internal controls since 2005,

Bowen's warnings were ignored, despite the fact that withholding such information from shareholders violated the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]], which he pointed out. Despite his warnings, Citigroup CEO [[Charles Prince]] signed a certification that the bank was in compliance with the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

Citigroup stripped Bowen of most of his responsibilities and informed him that his physical presence was no longer required at the bank. The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission asked him to testify about Citigroup's role in the mortgage crisis, and he did so, appearing as one of the first witnesses before the Commission in April 2010.&lt;ref name="Prosecuting Wall Street"&gt;{{cite web|title=Prosecuting Wall Street|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18560_162-57336042/prosecuting-wall-street/|publisher=CBS News: 60 Minutes|accessdate=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Richard Bowen Bio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Richard Bowen: Bio|url=http://www.richardmbowen.com/title:bio|work=|publisher=Richard Bowen:Citigroup Whistleblower &amp; Speaker on Accountable Leadership|accessdate=23 September 2013}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is perhaps best known for being one of several prominent American Indians to spearhead the movement against the use of [[Native American mascot controversy|Native American imagery]] as sports mascots.

==Early life==
Robert Roche was born Robert Joseph Roche on 3 May 1947 at Saint Ann's Hospital located in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]].&lt;ref name="Cleveland Scene" /&gt; Robert is a member of the [[Chiricahua|Chiricahua Apache]], a tribe of the Apache living in the Southwestern part of the United States.&lt;ref name="Native News Online"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nativenewsonline.net/currents/cleveland-american-indian-education-centers-robert-roche-dont-honor-us/ |title=Cleveland American Indian Education Center’s Robert Roche: "Don’t Honor Us!" |work=Native News Online |first=Levi |last=Rickert |date=7 April 2014 |accessdate=20 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would end up meeting [[Russell Means]], a well-known actor, civil rights activist and founder of the [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] branch of the [[American Indian Movement]].&lt;ref name="Native News Online" /&gt; He would profoundly influence a young Roche, and the two would go on to collaborate on many projects.&lt;ref name="Native News Online" /&gt;

==Career==
From 1974 to 1984, Roche worked in the City of Cleveland Juvenile Court Division as an Acting Probation Officer. During this time, he worked with indigenous youth who had come in contact with and were already in the juvenile justice system.&lt;ref name="University of Dayton"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.udayton.edu/artssciences/graul_chair/rrw/resources/documents/roche_profile.pdf |title=Robert Roche |work=University of Dayton |first=Robert |last=Roche |date= |accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mount Union"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mountunion.edu/robert-roche-to-discuss-american-indian-movement |title=Robert Roche to Discuss American Indian Movement |work=Mount Union |first=Abby |last=Honaker |date=8 November 2010 |accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, Robert Roche founded the American Indian Education Center, a non-profit organization that offered a variety of re-entry services for the American Indian population in the greater [[Greater Cleveland]] area, including HIV testing, tutoring, smoking cessation classes, cultural programming and resume writing instruction.&lt;ref name="NetzKraft"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.netzkraft.net/mitglied.php?teilnehmer=1488&amp;lang=englisch |title=American Indian Education Center (AIEC) |work=NetzKraft |first= |last= |date= |accessdate=20 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], [[Ohio]].&lt;ref name="WN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cleveland.com/naymik/index.ssf/2014/07/robert_roche_battles_chief_wah.html |title=Robert Roche battles Chief Wahoo, the Cleveland Indians and troubles of his own: Mark Naymik |work=NetzKraft |first=Mark |last=Naymik |date=2 July 2014 |accessdate=5 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roche opened the American Indian Education Center to provide a more comprehensive variety of services after the two decades of controversy its "predecessor," the Cleveland American Indian Center, founded by [[Russell Means]], had been embroiled in.&lt;ref name="NetzKraft"/&gt; in [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], [[Ohio]].&lt;ref name="The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ech.case.edu/cgi/article.pl?id=CAIC |title=CLEVELAND AMERICAN INDIAN CENTER - The Encyclopedia of Cleveland |work=Case Western Reserve University |first= |last= |date=5 April 2014 |accessdate=20 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roche would also use his role as a leader in the community to act as a [[character witness]].&lt;ref name="Cleveland Magazine"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clevelandmagazine.com/Media/MediaManager/OMalley-defense-memo.pdf |title=In the United States District Court |work=Cleveland Magazine |first= |last= |date=4 April 2014 |accessdate=7 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roche would also provided testimony in the clemency hearing Billy Slagle, who was convicted of Aggravated Murder with death penalty specifications, Aggravated Burglary, Aggravated Robbery in the 1987 murder of Mari Anne Pope, a babysitter who was stabbed 17 times by Slagle with a pair of scissors, while the children she was babysitting watched.&lt;ref name="Cleveland.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2013/08/convicted_murderer_billy_slagl.html |title=Convicted murderer Billy Slagle hangs himself days before scheduled execution |work=Cleveland.com |first=Brandon |last=Blackwell |date=4 August 2013 |accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the appeal, Roche explained that he had contact with the family when Slagle was young when the family came to the American Indian Education Center (Slagle's mother was Native American). Roche recalled alcohol abuse and violence were prominent fixtures in Slagle's home, and believed Slagle would have been incapable of murder if it were not for influence of the alcohol and drugs that he was using, which is why he provided testimony in favor of commuting the death sentence.&lt;ref name="STATE Of OHIO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sconet.state.oh.us/pdf_viewer/pdf_viewer.aspx?pdf=731191.pdf |title=STATE OF OHIO ADULT PAROLE AUTHORITY COLUMBUS, OHIO |work=STATE OF OHIO |first= |last= |date=16 July 2013 |accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He currently resides in the city of [[Parma, Ohio|Parma]], a suburb located in the city of [[Cleveland]].&lt;ref name="The News-Herald"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.news-herald.com/general-news/20140404/fans-brave-weather-for-cleveland-indians-lake-county-captains-home-openers |title=Fans brave weather for Cleveland Indians, Lake County Captains home openers |work=The News-Herald |first=David |last=Glasier |date=4 April 2014 |accessdate=5 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Robert Roche has been the subject of criticism from some members within the Cleveland Native American community. [[Philip Yenyo|Philip Joseph Yenyo]], an Aztec Indian,&lt;ref name="19 Action News"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.19actionnews.com/story/7220023/bugs-or-no-bugs-indians-fans-ready-for-red-sox |title=Bugs or No Bugs, Indians fans Ready for Red Sox |work=19 Action News |first= |last= |date= |accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; protester, and member of the [[American Indian Movement]] of [[Ohio]],&lt;ref name="Washington Times"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/10/protesters-call-for-indians-to-change-nickname-log/ |title=Indians fans face protest at home opener: ‘We are people, not your mascots’ |work=Washington Times |first=Tom |last=Withers |date=5 April 2015 |accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that Roche had constructed a false identity, claiming to have a birth certificate which reveals that Robert Roche was really Jose Roche.&lt;ref name="Cleveland Scene" /&gt; However, when asked to validate the nature of the injurious claims, Yenyo was unable to substantiate his accusations with material evidence.&lt;ref name="Cleveland Scene" /&gt; Roche has also been accused by members of the Native American community of using the Center as a platform for himself while failing to provide a consistent regimen of services.&lt;ref name="WN"/&gt; Roche was also asked by one of the founders of the original [[American Indian Movement]] to stop identifying himself as a member of the organization. According to [[Vernon Bellecourt]], Robert Roche had never been an AIM representative in Ohio. "We have known for some time that he was invoking the name of AIM," Bellcourt said. "We feel if people are doing good work in our name, it's OK. But that is not the case with Roche. We received complaints about him from leaders of the Indian community, and that was enough to cause us to issue the letter." Despite identifying himself as a representative of the Autonomous America Indian Movement, Roche would also state that he was representative or executive director of Cleveland AIM, even doing so in a resume where he describes himself as an "appointed American Indian Movement executive director - Cleveland Ohio, 1994-present."&lt;ref name="Cleveland Blog" /&gt;

There have also questions raised about the use of grant funds allocated to the American Indian Education Center Roche operates. The Ohio Attorney General's Office launched an investigation into the use of the Center's finances following a 2013 anonymous complaint that alleged the American Indian Education Center mishandled the grant money it had been appropriated, and the fact Roche paid $153,00.00 in salary and benefits to himself that year, according to the tax filing.&lt;ref name="WN"/&gt; Closer examination to the available financial records, however, showed that Roche paid himself in relative proportion of grant funding allocated to the organization. In 2012, the American Indian Education Center received $650,000.00 in grant funding, an elevated increase in comparison from previous years. This was due largely to a Department of Education grant aimed at improving education for impoverished and underprivileged kids. In 2011, when the center was allocated $235,000.00 in grant funding, Roche paid himself only $37,000.00. Prior to that year, in 2010, when the Center was allocated $42,000.00 in grants, Roche, who served as the executive director, and the sole full-time employee on staff (who also worked seven days a week), paid himself only $12,000.00. During that same year, he also wrote a $16,000.00 loan for the center. On the tax filing, under "purpose," it read: "Keep Center Open."&lt;ref name="Native Cleveland"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://npaper-wehaa.com/clevescene/2014/10/01/#?article=2344679 |title=American Indian Movement of Ohio |work=Native Cleveland |first=Sam |last=Allard |date=1 October 2014 |accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New details into the mismanagement of money allocated to the American Indian Education Center have slowly emerged. It was revealed that the inspector general for the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] also launched an independent investigation into the American Indian Education Center. According to the [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]] (SAMHSA) starting in 2011. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which is a branch of the U.S. Department of Health, had provided thousands of dollars to the American Indian Education Center from 2011 onwards. However, due to the placement of a "high risk restriction" on the Center, access to the SAMHSA grant money was on a limited basis. The investigation also cites the lack of proper financial management to administer the federal grant. The probe has also identified certain irregularities into the expenditure of funds provided by the SAMHSA. These irregularities included the $136,000.00 salary Roche paid himself in 2012, which did not appear to be concordant with wages supplied in grant documentation provided by the American Indian Education Center, the flat fees paid to the center's grant writer, McGuire &amp; Associates, are inconsistent with standard practice, and the Center's bylaws giving Roche governing authority and control over his board of directors, are not in keeping with federal guidelines, which state that the board should operate independently of its director. There are also matters of personnel costs, related taxes and fringe benefit payments that The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration is looking into.&lt;ref name="Cleveland.com2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cleveland.com/naymik/index.ssf/2015/01/anti-chief_wahoo_activist_robe.html |title=Anti-Chief Wahoo activist Robert Roche faces federal scrutiny: Mark Naymik |work=Cleveland.com News |first=Mark |last=Naymik |date=8 January 2015 |accessdate=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One grant received by the American Indian Education Center received in 2012 carried over into 2013. However, the rant was terminated by the grantor, the Ohio Department of Education, which decided that the program being funded by the grant was ineffective. Roche also made an attempt to open a second education center for American Indian people in the city of [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Ohio]] in spite of financial difficulties faced during 2012. Although he cited poor health and financial difficulties, Roche registered a 1989 [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] in the "unfinished" Columbus Center's name in December 2012. According to Roche, he donated the car to the center, where he plans to raffle the vehicle in the name of American Indian services.&lt;ref name="Cleveland.com2" /&gt;

'''Theresa LePore''' is a former [[Supervisor of Elections]] for [[Palm Beach County]], [[Florida]].  She is most notable as the person who designed the infamous "[[butterfly ballot]]", used in the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://cnn.com/2001/ALLPOLITICS/stories/01/05/palm.beach.ballot |title=Ballot nightmare lingers for Palm Beach elections chief |first=Gary |last=Tuchman |date=2001-01-05 | publisher=Cable News Network }}&lt;/ref&gt; This would lead the [[Mass media|press]] to nickname her "Madame Butterfly".  Following the [[2000 United States presidential election recount in Florida|controversial results of the 2000 election]], she lost her re-election bid in September 2004 and left office in January 2005.

In [[Jay Roach]]'s ''[[Recount (film)|Recount]]'', LePore is played by [[Jayne Atkinson]].

==Career==
LePore grew up in Palm Beach County, attending [[Cardinal Newman High School (West Palm Beach, Florida)|Cardinal Newman High School]] in West Palm Beach, Palm Beach State College in Lake Worth and Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton.

She started her career in the Supervisor of Elections Office in 1971 as a file clerk.  She quickly rose through the ranks and achieved the position of Chief Deputy Supervisor in the late 1970s.  During the 1980s she also moonlighted as a ramp clerk at [[Palm Beach International Airport]].

In 1996 LePore changed her political party registration to Democratic after deciding to run for the position of Supervisor of Elections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commondreams.org/headlines04/0901-01.htm LePore Loses Re-Election Bid] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919073940/http://www.commondreams.org/headlines04/0901-01.htm |date=2008-09-19 }} from [[CommonDreams.org]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1996-10-15/news/9610140096_1_motor-voter-law-palm-beach-county-show-proof |title=Elect Democrat Theresa Lepore As New Supervisor Of Elections |publisher=Articles.sun-sentinel.com |date=1996-10-15 |accessdate=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was elected as the Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections in November, 1996 and re-elected without opposition in November, 2000. In 2004 she lost re-election as Election Supervisor. Prior to the election she had changed her political party designation to independent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=mvRPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QQkEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6486,478951|title=Ocala Star-Banner - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com|accessdate=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving the Supervisor of Elections Office in January, 2005, she was employed by the Palm Beach County State Attorney's Office for a short period, enabling her to receive her full pension from Palm Beach County.

She then worked at her alma mater, Cardinal Newman High School in West Palm Beach, Florida as director of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/06/AR2006100600937.html |title=Victim Advocates, Fla. Diocese Urge Foley to Name Alleged Abuser |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=2006-10-07 |accessdate=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; until January 2009.

* [[American Society of Public Administration]]
* The Election Center
* [[Kiwanis]] of Flagler Sunrise
* [[League of Women Voters]]
* International Association of Clerks, Recorders, Election Officials and Treasurers

==Election controversies==
[[File:Butterfly Voters View.jpg|thumb|"Butterfly ballot" from Palm Beach County, 2000 election]]In 2000, to accommodate the large number of presidential candidates eligible in Florida, LePore designed a staggered two-page format with candidate names on alternating sides of a central punch button column. Conservatives falsely commented that the same ballot was successfully used in the 1996 election; in fact, it had never been used in a Palm Beach County election among rival candidates for office.&lt;ref name="crow"&gt;{{cite book|title ="Oh, Waiter! One Order of Crow!"|first=Jeff|last=Greenfield |year=2001|publisher =G. P. Putnam's Sons| location=New York |pages=215–216}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the confusing design led to an increased amount of miscast votes in the presidential election (votes that would otherwise have been a decisive reversal) and consequently achieved notoriety. A study by ''[[The Palm Beach Post]]'' speculated that voters confused by Palm Beach County's butterfly ballot cost Al Gore the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/ALLPOLITICS/03/11/palmbeach.recount/ |title=Newspaper: Butterfly ballot cost Gore White House |date=2001-03-11| work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''To Mars and Providence'''"&lt;ref&gt;The title is possibly in reference of ''[[To Arkham and the Stars]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; is a short story by American writer [[Don Webb (writer)|Don Webb]], published in ''[[War of the Worlds: Global Dispatches]]''. It is a conflation of ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'', the [[Cthulhu Mythos]], and the biography of [[H. P. Lovecraft]].

==Plot summary==
The story begins on August 12, 1898, twenty-nine days after the death of eight-year-old Howard Philip Lovecraft's father. Howard observes a [[Martian (War of the Worlds)|Martian]] cylinder crash into [[Federal Hill, Providence, Rhode Island|Federal Hill]], an event that he had been predicting in his dreams for three years.&lt;ref&gt;Dreams and their predictive nature were a common theme in Lovecraft's writing; this is also similar to the dreams of [[The Call of Cthulhu#Henry Anthony Wilcox|Wilcox]] in ''[[The Call of Cthulhu]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Being a "gentleman of pure [[Yankee]] stock [of] the true chalk-white [[Nordic race|Nordic]] type"&lt;ref&gt;See [[H. P. Lovecraft#Racism|Lovecraft's views on race]].&lt;/ref&gt; Howard decides to investigate the landing, and witnesses the opening of the cylinder and emergence of the Martian occupants. When the Martians fire upon onlookers with their [[Heat-Ray|heat ray]]s, he faints.

Howard reawakens three days later in his home. His mother, blissfully ignorant of the danger in staying behind in Martian-occupied [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]],&lt;ref&gt;In observing this, Howard notes that "it was perhaps a blessing that the human mind is unable to correlate its contents," reflecting the famous opening line of ''[[The Call of Cthulhu]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; informs him that he was taken into the Martian cylinder, before being rescued by a [[Brown University]] librarian named [[The Dunwich Horror#Henry Armitage|Armitage]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown was the basis for Lovecraft's [[Miskatonic University]].&lt;/ref&gt; Howard observes the spread of the [[red weed]] and the movement of [[Tripod (The War of the Worlds)|fighting machines]] and feels an intense longing to explore the crash site, but realizes that his mother will not let him. He resorts to drugging her with a [[sedative]] in her [[malted milk]], before heading out into the city.

Howard arrives at St. John's Church, where he witnesses a tripod placing an artifact into the steeple and to which he feels the strong pull. Climbing to its top, he finds a glowing [[trapezohedron]]&lt;ref&gt;A reference to ''[[The Haunter of the Dark]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; accompanied by a strange sound of distant flutes.&lt;ref&gt;In Lovecraft's work, the sound of flutes is associated with [[Nyarlathotep]].&lt;/ref&gt; Picking up the object, Lovecraft is surrounded by a shifting, sentient [[Colour out of space (species)|unearthly colour]]. It asks if he is "one of us," stating that prior to the invasion, a number of Martian minds were telepathically sent to occupy human bodies to report, with some failing to return.&lt;ref name="GR"&gt;These are references to the practices of the [[Great Race of Yith]] from ''[[The Shadow Out of Time]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; It begins to relate the story of the "Martians" history to Howard.

The species originated in another [[solar system]], emigrating to this one ages ago. They established two colonies, one on [[Mars]] that thrived and one in [[Leng (plateau)|an area]] of [[Antarctica]] that was destroyed due to [[climate change]]. The survivors on Mars engaged in [[selective breeding]] programs that created an advanced, immortal physical form.&lt;ref name="ET"&gt;These are references to the [[Elder Thing]]s from ''[[At the Mountains of Madness]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; As a side effect, some Martians developed the capability to engage in [[astral projection]], and made contact with the other two races of the system: Humans on Earth, and a "[[Mi-go|fungoid race]]" on a [[Yuggoth|distant planet]].&lt;ref name="GR" /&gt;

The Martians engaged in trade with the fungoid race, entering a golden age and building "labyrinthine Cyclopean structures" before entering a decline marked with a population shrinkage and increasingly decadent artwork.&lt;ref name="ET" /&gt; However, this collapse ends with a discovery beneath [[Syrtis Major Planum|Syrtis Major]]: an [[R'lyeh|underground series of impenetrable vaults]] that the fungoid beings explained as being the home of the [[Great Old Ones|elder godlike beings]] that were Mars's first masters, and would return from their undead dreaming when the stars were aligned.&lt;ref&gt;This is a reference to [[Cthulhu]] and his [[star-spawn]].&lt;/ref&gt;

This discovery sent the normally cool and calculating Martians into a frenzy of terror, and they destroyed as many of the elder gods' idols as they could find, before finally deciding to leave Mars for Earth, where the elder gods have no interest. It was for this reason that the Martians sent out their psychic spies - of which Howard apparently was one. By this time, the colour out of space begins to fade, and Howard finds himself on Mars, in a vast hall filled with "mathematically-perfect music".&lt;ref&gt;This could refer to the speech of the [[Elder Thing]]s and their [[shoggoth]] imitators from ''[[At the Mountains of Madness]]'', or to the eponymous ''[[The Music of Erich Zann|Music of Erich Zann]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Howard enters the hall, and as he does, the Martian inhabitants begin to exit in fear; Howard realized the cause when he looks up and sees that one of the feared elder gods is standing within the hall. Howard approaches it - and realizes that he is standing before a mirror.&lt;ref&gt;This is a reference to the [[ending twist]] of ''[[The Outsider (short story)|The Outsider]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The narration states that the shock of this sent Howard back to Earth, with no memories of the event, and in later years he became one of the skeptics who claimed there had never been a Martian invasion of the Earth.

==Other notes==
*Howard described the Martians as [[wikt:eldritch|eldritch]] in appearance, and uses descriptions similar to the appearance of [[Cthulhu]] and the [[Elder Thing]]s.
*The narrative notes Howard's early rejection of [[Santa Claus]] and embrace of [[atheism]].
*Howard's mother refers to him as [[Abdul Alhazred]].
*Howard mentions cylinders landing in [[London]], [[Paris]], [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], and [[Texas]] (referring to other stories from ''Global Dispatches'') and also mentions the irony of Martians landing in [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]]'s [[Italian people|Italian]] section when it was [[Giovanni Schiaparelli]] who discovered the [[Martian canal]]s.
*Howard mentions that one of the very few things in the world that seemed true to him were "certain tales in ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|The Arabian Nights]]''", echoing statements of Lovecraftian characters concerning the ''[[Necronomicon]]''.
*The back cover of ''Global Dispatches'' depicts three Martian tripods excavating something amid icebound glaciers; this is presumably them seeking the remains of their lost Antarctic colony.

'''Sir William Fletcher Barrett''' (10 February 1844 in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]], Jamaica – 26 May 1925) was an English [[physicist]] and [[Parapsychology|parapsychologist]].&lt;ref name="royalsoced.org.uk"&gt;http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCorristine, Shane. (2011). ''William Fletcher Barrett, Spiritualism and Psychical Research in Edwardian Dublin Estudios Irlandeses'' 6: 39-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

He was born in Jamaica where his father, [[William Garland Barrett]], who was an amateur naturalist, [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]] minister and a member of the [[London Missionary Society]], ran a station for saving African slaves. There he lived with his mother, Martha Barrett, née Fletcher, and a brother and sister.  The family returned to their native England in Royston, Hertfordshire in 1848 where another sister, the social reformer [[Rosa Mary Barrett]] was born. In 1855 they moved to Manchester and Barrett was then educated at Old Trafford Grammar School.&lt;ref name="ONDB"&gt;[[Alan Gauld|Gauld, Alan]]. (2004). ''Barrett, Sir William Fletcher (1844–1925)''. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Oxford University Press. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/71319, accessed 2 Feb 2011].&lt;/ref&gt;

Barrett then took chemistry and physics at the [[Royal College of Chemistry]] and then became the science master at the [[London International College]] (1867–9) before becoming assistant to John Tyndall at the [[Royal Institution]] (1863–1866).&lt;ref name="ONDB"/&gt; He then taught at the Royal School of Naval Architecture.&lt;ref name="ONDB"/&gt;

In 1873 he became Professor of Experimental Physics at the [[Royal College of Science for Ireland]]. From the early 1880s he lived with his mother, sister, and two live-in servants in a residence at Kingstown (now [[Dún Laoghaire]]). Barrett discovered Stalloy (see [[Permalloy]]), a silicon-iron alloy used in electrical engineering and also did a lot of work on [[sensitive flame]]s and their uses in acoustic demonstrations.&lt;ref name="ONDB"/&gt; During his studies of metals and their properties, Barrett worked with W. Brown and R. A. Hadfield. He also discovered the shortening of nickel through magnetisation in 1882.&lt;ref name="ONDB"/&gt;

When Barrett developed [[cataract]]s in his later years, he also began to study biology with a series of experiments designed to locate and successfully analyze causative agents within the eyes. The result of these experiments was a machine called the [[entoptiscope]].&lt;ref name="ONDB"/&gt; He was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] in June 1899&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=1&amp;dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27barrett%27%29| title = Library and Archive Catalog|publisher= Royal Society|accessdate = 10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was also a fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] and the [[Royal Dublin Society]]. He was knighted in 1912. He married [[Florence Barrett|Florence Willey]] in 1916.&lt;ref name="ONDB"/&gt; He died at home, 31 Devonshire Place in [[London]].&lt;ref name="royalsoced.org.uk"/&gt;

Barrett's last book, ''Christian Science: An Examination of the Religion of Health'' was completed and published after his death in 1926 by his sister Rosa M. Barrett.

==Psychical research==

[[File:William Barrett Spiritualist.png|thumb|Barrett]]

Barrett became interested in the [[paranormal]] in the 1860s after having an experience with [[mesmerism]]. Barrett believed that he had been witness to thought transference and by the 1870s he was investigating [[poltergeist]]s.&lt;ref name="ONDB"/&gt; In September 1876 Barrett published a paper outlining the result of these investigations and by 1881 he had published preliminary accounts of his additional experiments with thought transference in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''.&lt;ref name="ONDB"/&gt; The publication caused controversy and in the wake of this Barrett decided to found a society of like-minded individuals to help further his research. Barrett held conference between 5–6 January 1882 in London. In February the [[Society for Psychical Research]] (SPR) was formed.&lt;ref name="Oppenheim 1985"&gt;[[Janet Oppenheim|Oppenheim, Janet]]. (1985). ''The Other World: Spiritualism and Psychical Research in England, 1850-1914''. Cambridge University Press. pp. 137-372. {{ISBN|0-521-26505-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barrett was a [[Christian]] and [[Spiritualism|spiritualist]] member of the SPR.&lt;ref name="Oppenheim 1985"/&gt; Although he had founded the society, Barrett was only truly active for a year, and in 1884 founded the [[American Society for Psychical Research]].&lt;ref name="ONDB"/&gt; He became president of the society in 1904 and continued to submit articles to their journal.&lt;ref name="ONDB"/&gt; From 1908–14 Barrett was active in the Dublin Section of the Society for Psychical Research, a group which attracted many important members including Sir John Pentland Mahaffy, T.W. Rolleston, Sir Archibald Geikie, and Lady Augusta Gregory.&lt;ref&gt;McCorristine, Shane. (2011). ''William Fletcher Barrett, Spiritualism, and Psychical Research in Edwardian Dublin''. Estudios Irlandeses. Journal of Irish Studies 6: 39-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century the [[Creery Sisters]] (Mary, Alice, Maud, Kathleen, and Emily) were tested by Barrett and other members of the SPR who believed them to have genuine psychic ability, however, the sisters later confessed to fraud by describing their method of signal codes that they had utilized.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ray Hyman|Hyman, Ray]]. (1989). ''The Elusive Quarry: A Scientific Appraisal of Psychical Research''. Prometheus Books. pp. 99-106. {{ISBN|0-87975-504-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barrett and the other members of the SPR such as [[Edmund Gurney]] and [[Frederic W. H. Myers]] had been easily duped.&lt;ref&gt;Wiley, Barry H. (2012). ''The Thought Reader Craze: Victorian Science at the Enchanted Boundary''. McFarland. pp. 82-94. {{ISBN|978-0786464708}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a believer in [[telepathy]], Barrett denounced the [[muscle reading]] of [[Stuart Cumberland]] and other magicians as "pseudo" thought readers.&lt;ref&gt;Nicola Bown, Carolyn Burdett, Pamela Thurschwell. (2004). ''The Victorian Supernatural''. Cambridge University Press. pp. 87-108. {{ISBN|0-521-81015-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barrett helped to publish [[Frederick Bligh Bond]]'s book ''Gate of Remembrance'' (1918) which was based on alleged psychical excavations at [[Glastonbury Abbey]]. Barrett endorsed the claims of the book and testified to Bond's sincerity.&lt;ref&gt;Asprem, Egil. (2014). ''The Problem of Disenchantment: Scientific Naturalism and Esoteric Discourse, 1900-1939''. Brill Academic Publishers. p. 330. {{ISBN|978-9004251922}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, professional archaeologists and [[Skepticism|skeptics]] have found Bond's claims dubious.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joe Nickell|Nickell, Joe]]. (2007). ''Adventures in Paranormal Investigation''. University Press of Kentucky. pp. 48-49. {{ISBN|978-0-8131-2467-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth Feder|Feder, Kenneth]]. ''Archaeology and the Paranormal''. In [[Gordon Stein]]. (1996). ''The Encyclopedia of the Paranormal''. Prometheus Books. pp. 32-43. {{ISBN|1-57392-021-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919, Barrett wrote the introduction to medium [[Hester Dowden]]'s book ''Voices from the Void''.

==Dowsing==

Barrett held a special interest in [[Dowsing|divining rods]] and in 1897 and 1900 he published two articles on the subject in [[Society for Psychical Research|Proceedings of the SPR]].&lt;ref name="ONDB"/&gt; He co-authored the book ''The Divining-Rod'' (1926), with [[Theodore Besterman]].&lt;ref name="Mill 1927"&gt;[[Hugh Robert Mill|Mill, Hugh Robert]]. (1927). ''Behind the Divining Rod''. ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' 119: 310-311.&lt;/ref&gt;

Barrett rejected any physical theory for [[dowsing]] such as radiation.&lt;ref name="Mill 1927"/&gt; He concluded that the [[Ideomotor phenomenon|ideomotor response]] was responsible for the movement of the rod but in some cases the dowser's unconscious could pick up information by [[clairvoyance]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Gardner|Gardner, Martin]]. (2012 reprint edition). Originally published in 1957. ''[[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]]''. Dover Publications. pp. 102-103. {{ISBN|0-486-20394-8}} "The first significant "scientific" study of the subject was made in 1891 by Sir William F. Barrett, professor of physics at the Royal College of Science, Ireland. ''The Dowsing Rod'', by Barrett and Theodore Besterman, published in 1926, is one of the leading references on the subject. The book's thesis is that the turning of the rod is due to unconscious muscular action on the part of the dowser, who possesses a clairvoyant ability to sense the presence of water."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gordon Stein|Stein, Gordon]]. (1996). ''The Encyclopedia of the Paranormal''. Prometheus Books. p. 231. {{ISBN|1-57392-021-5}} "Barrett, who believed in telepathy, acknowledged that the dowser's unconscious moving of the rod could be the result of autosuggestion stimulated by cues from the environment. He felt that in some cases, however, the diviner's unconscious was picking up information about the underground water through clairvoyance."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

Barrett has drawn criticism from researchers and skeptics as being overly credulous for endorsing spiritualist mediums and not detecting trickery that occurred in the [[séance]] room. For example, author [[Ronald Pearsall]] wrote that Barrett was duped into believing spiritualism by mediumship trickery.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald Pearsall|Pearsall, Ronald]]. (1972). ''The Table-Rappers''. Book Club Associates. p. 219&lt;/ref&gt;

Skeptic [[Edward Clodd]] criticized Barrett as being an incompetent researcher to detect fraud and claimed his spiritualist beliefs were based on [[magical thinking]] and primitive superstition.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Clodd|Clodd, Edward]]. (1917). [https://archive.org/stream/questionifmandie00cloduoft#page/265/mode/2up ''The Question: A Brief History and Examination of Modern Spiritualism]''. Grant Richards, London. pp. 265-301&lt;/ref&gt; Another skeptic [[Joseph McCabe]] wrote that Barrett "talks nonsense of which he ought to be ashamed" as he had poor understanding of [[Magic (illusion)|conjuring]] tricks and failed to detect the fraud of the medium [[Kathleen Goligher]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph McCabe|McCabe, Joseph]]. (1920). [https://archive.org/stream/isspiritualismba00mccarich#page/59/mode/2up ''Is Spiritualism Based On Fraud? The Evidence Given By Sir A. C. Doyle and Others Drastically Examined'']. London: Watts &amp; Co. pp. 59-60&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychical researcher Helen de G. Verrall gave Barrett's book ''Psychical Research'' a positive review describing it as a "clear, careful account of some of main achievements of psychical research by one who has himself taken part in these achievements and speaks to a large extent from personal knowledge and observation."&lt;ref&gt;Verrall, Helen de G. (1913). ''Psychical Research by W. F. Barrett''. International Journal of Ethics. Volume 23, No 2. pp. 239-240.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the ''[[BMJ|British Medical Journal]]'' the book was criticized for ignoring critical work on the subject and being "a negative assault on scientific method generally".&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous (1912). ''A Study Of Psychical Research''. ''[[BMJ|British Medical Journal]]''. Vol. 1, No. 2667. pp. 308-309.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ethnomusicologist]]s have measured ceramic, animal-bone, and cane [[flute]]s from the [[Inca Empire]] which indicate a preference for women with a high [[vocal range]]. Women had equal [[social status]], were trained, and received the same opportunities in music as men in indigenous communities until the arrival of Columbus in the late 15th century. European settlers brought patriarchal, [[machismo]] ideologies to the continent, replacing the idea of equality between men and women. They equated [[Native American music|native music]] with "savagery" and European music with "civilization". Female musicians tended to be darker-skinned as a result of the [[slave trade]] (which increased the population of [[African slaves]]), and contemporary society denigrated music as a profession. Latin music became Africanized, with [[syncopated]] [[rhythm (music)|rhythms]] and [[call-and-response]]; European settlement introduced [[harmony]] and the Spanish [[décima]] song form.

Since the [[history of sound recording|pre-recording era of music]], Latin music was male-dominated, and there are relatively few examples of female [[songwriter]]s, [[music producer]]s, [[record executive]]s, and [[music promoter|promoters]]. Women lacked access to musical training; music programs were nonexistent, and cultural norms discouraged female participation. Latin music had a primarily male presence; men discriminated against women, limiting them to singing or dancing and discouraging them from becoming [[instrumentalist]]s, writers, [[List of women composers|composers]], [[music arranger|arrangers]], and executives. Women artists in the sub-genres of Latin music, such as [[Selena]], [[Jenni Rivera]], [[Jennifer Lopez]], [[Ivy Queen]], [[Julieta Venegas]], and [[Ely Guerra]]. have been credited with enhancing the genres' female presence; they have broken through barriers, reshaping Latin music and public perceptions of [[female sexuality]], gender, and [[femininity]]. Women in [[salsa music]] are significantly underrepresented in the industry as very few women, with the exception of [[Celia Cruz]], have been associated with the emergence of the genre; for example, in the British documentary ''Salsa: Latin Pop Music in the Cites'' (1985), Cruz is one of the only female singers who is mentioned.

Women Latin singers have a significant demographic imbalance on [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] [[music charts]] compared with their male counterparts. As radio formats explore genres popularized and led by men, such as [[reggaeton]] and [[regional Mexican music]], women on the ''Billboard'' Latin music charts are periodically absent. The last female singer with a number-one single was [[Sofia Reyes]], whose collaborative "[[Solo Yo]]" ended a five-year drought on the [[Latin Pop Songs]] chart in 2016. A year earlier, on the 50-position [[Hot Latin Songs]] chart, 22 weeks passed without a song by a women. Reyes has expressed concern about the disparity between male and female performances at Latin music award shows, noting that 90 percent of the performers are male. Other female singers, such as [[Chiquis Rivera]], have attributed the decline in visibility of women in Latin music to  [[sexist]] radio programmers. Latin music executive Alexandra Lioutikoff believes that the decline is due to a lack of female collaboration. Latin music remains male-dominated, and the [[music industry]] has "prejudiced practice" limiting female recording artists.

== Characteristics ==
Latin American music is varied; it includes thirty countries, influenced by [[European music|European]], [[African American music|African]], and [[Native American music|Amerindian]] cultures.{{sfn|Roberts|1999|p=3}} Latin music uses two European languages: [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], though modern-day widely distinguishes the genre as primarily sung or recorded in Spanish and to a lesser extent [[French language|French]] and [[Italian language|Italian]].{{sfn|Roberts|1999|p=3}} Although heterogeneous, Latin music commonly includes the Spanish [[décima]] song form, African [[syncopation|syncopated]] [[rhythm (music)|rhythms]] and [[call-and-response]], and European [[harmony (music)|harmony]].{{sfn|Miller|2008|p=254}}

Pre-modern Latin music refers to music made by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]],{{sfn|Kuss|2004|p=1}} hundreds of [[ethnic group]]s across the continent.{{sfn|Navarro|Sánchez|Ali|1999|p=5}} The first inhabitants of Latin America settled 30,000 years before the arrival of Italian explorer [[Christopher Columbus]] at the peak of native cultural diversification into simple and complex societies.{{sfn|Preston|2014|p=11}} These societies included sedentary agricultural tribes and [[hunter gatherers]],{{sfn|Preston|2014|p=11}} who sang [[prayer]]s to a deity asking for prosperity{{sfn|Kuss|2004|p=1}} with lyrics of "conflict, beauty, pain, and loss that mark all human experience" and music reflecting their understanding of the universe.{{sfn|Kuss|2004|p=5}} They had "intricate ways of explaining the relationships between the sound, social organization, time, and the sacred",{{sfn|Kuss|2004|p=5}} and their rituals included dramatized performances of mythology vocalizing their view of [[creationism|creation]].{{sfn|Kuss|2004|p=8}} The creation myth of the [[Keres people]] of [[Laguna Pueblo]] (present west-central [[New Mexico]]) describes "the unformed cosmos as the domain of [[Tse che nako]] (Thought Woman or Spider Woman) who [[chant]]s life into two sacred bundles that become the sisters [[Keres (mythology)|Uretsete and Naosete]] (She Who Matters and She Who Remembers)."{{sfn|Kuss|2004|p=8}}

Indigenous communities predating Columbus' arrival reserved [[women in music|music for women]], although men were equally involved in dance.{{sfn|Kuss|2004|p=170}} During the [[Inca Empire]] in the mid-14th century, women from royal families and selected ''acallas'' (chosen ones) were taught science, art, poetry, and music from "wise elders".{{sfn|Pendle|2001|p=442}} The "chosen ones" were selected for their beauty and "quality of their voices."{{sfn|Pendle|2001|p=442}} There were six houses, one of which was called the ''taquiaclla'' (''taqui'' means "song"),&lt;!-- In what language? --&gt; which housed girls aged nine to fifteen with "gifted" singing voices.{{sfn|Pendle|2001|p=442}} The [[Andean civilizations|Andeans]] preferred young women with a high [[vocal range]].{{sfn|Pendle|2001|p=442}} Although no scripts or musical notation survive, archaeologists have uncovered a variety of ceramic, animal bone, and cane [[flute]]s.{{sfn|Pendle|2001|p=442}} [[Ethnomusicologist]]s who have measured the flutes have found their [[pitch (music)|pitch]] compatible with a high vocal range.{{sfn|Pendle|2001|p=442}} Women in these communities were well-treated,{{sfn|Tompkins|Foster|2001|p=34}} with equal opportunities to teach, perform, sing, and dance (as soloists, with other women, or in pairs with men).{{sfn|Kuss|2004|p=139}} Female singers had a social status equal to men, receiving musical training and opportunities with their male counterparts.{{sfn|Sturman|2015}}

Columbus' arrival in 1492 and the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] brought [[patriarchy]] and [[machismo]] to the continent, overriding sexual equality.{{sfn|Tompkins|Foster|2001|p=34}} Early [[Music of Spain|Spanish music]] described women as "property and mistrusted [by men]."{{sfn|Sturman|2015}} In a song, "Delgadina", women are servants who must please their men "no matter the cost."{{sfn|Sturman|2015}} According to author Janet Sturman, the Iberian idea of machismo (in which a strong man is superior to others, including women) was held by the [[conquistadors]].{{sfn|Sturman|2015}} Europeans who settled in the [[New World]] associated native music with "savagery" and European music with "civilization".{{sfn|Berglund|Johnson|Lee|2016|p=17}} During the [[slave trade]], musicians in Latin America primarily had a dark complexion.{{sfn|Baker|Knighton|2011|p=154}} This was due to an increased population of African slaves and contemporary society's view of music as a profession.{{sfn|Baker|Knighton|2011|p=154}} Most slaves arriving in Brazil were "bi-musical",&lt;!-- "Bi-musical" needs explanation. --&gt; and introduced their music to [[Music of Brazil|the country]].{{sfn|Baker|Knighton|2011|p=154}} Rural [[Quechua language|Quechua]]-speaking [[Bolivia]]n farmers sang about European resistance in songs with Native American and European influences.{{sfn|Pendle|2001|p=439}} [[Dark skin|Black]] Bolivians sang songs with lyrics reflecting a European influence, performed as Africanized European music.{{sfn|Pendle|2001|p=439}}

In colonial Latin America, [[nun]]s wrote, directed, and performed music.{{sfn|Socolow|2000|p=102}} They played a variety of instruments, including the [[clavichord]], [[harp]], [[flageolet]], and flute.{{sfn|Socolow|2000|p=102}} The nuns played in front of spectators, choirs, and high-ranking government officials.{{sfn|Socolow|2000|p=102}} Musically-adept, underprivileged women were allowed to perform during the nuns' [[Christmas]] recital.{{sfn|Socolow|2000|p=102}} Performances were often "feminine acts", such as sewing, embroidery, bakery, and selling "special confections."{{sfn|Socolow|2000|p=102}} For two hundred years in Latin America, the "elite woman" was educated in the arts; "the rest" were consigned to cooking, sewing, spinning, weaving, embroidery, and music.{{sfn|Socolow|2000|p=167}} In 17th- and 18th-century [[Mexico City]], music was often heard by visitors.{{sfn|Baker|Knighton|2011|p=50}} The music emanated from cathedral choirs, indigenous dancers, or black musicians organized in the city.{{sfn|Baker|Knighton|2011|p=50}} During the 17th century, Europeans and their descendants wrote and performed music at cathedrals in Mexico's cities which was repeated in song by [[black people|blacks]], [[mulatto]]s, indigenous Mexicans, [[Asian people|Asians]], and ethnicities.{{sfn|Baker|Knighton|2011|p=49}} In 1690, Mexican author [[Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz]] wrote secular and religious poetry, plays, philosophy, and theology.{{sfn|Socolow|2000|p=103}} She often discussed topics ranging from mathematics to music with visitors, had no interest in marriage and wanted to pursue "a life of the mind."{{sfn|Socolow|2000|p=103}} Although her views were suppressed, de la Cruz defended [[women's rights]] in education.{{sfn|Socolow|2000|p=103}}

At a 1691 celebration, European traveler Juan de Galde described his participation in dancing and singing and placing a [[scapular]] on two young women in Mexico.{{sfn|Baker|Knighton|2011|p=50}} A Mexican singer named Reina performed for six hours, which made "the event more enjoyable".{{sfn|Baker|Knighton|2011|pp=50-51}} The "wild" celebration banned [[Jamaicans]] from entry.{{sfn|Baker|Knighton|2011|p=51}} In 1697, Neapolitan chronicler Gemelli Carreri wrote during his trip off the coast of the [[Dominican Republic]] that he saw a canoe of musicians trying to outdo each other in singing and drawing attention to their "perfection".{{sfn|Baker|Knighton|2011|p=50}} In 1799 [[Buenos Aires]], privileged women were encouraged to educate themselves in the arts.{{sfn|Socolow|2000|p=170}} The government required that women be taught to read and write, in addition to physical education and music.{{sfn|Socolow|2000|p=170}}

Since the arrival of European settlers, Latin music has been male-dominated.{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=267}} Musical training was nonexistent for women.{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=137}} Male predominance in the genre left "power imbalances that acted as barriers to women's participation in Latin music."{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=267}} Despite this barrier, women have become successful.{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=267}} Under the authority of men, they were limited to roles as [[vocalist]]s or dancers rather than [[instrumentalists]], writers, composers, [[music arranger|arrangers]], and executives.{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=267}} According to musicologist [[Ilan Stavans]], female roles were related to traditional norms; "decent women" cared for their children and remained at home, cleaning and cooking.{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=267}} Women's dance routines were a growing concern among female fans and performers.{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=267}} Female dancers, more closely scrutinized than males, were expected to follow "normative gender expectations" and exhibit "appropriate behavior".{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=268}} Although male dancers typically performed suggestively, women who danced similarly were accused of being "loose" or "slack".{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=268}}

[[File:Celia Cruz 1.jpg|thumb|alt=Black-and-white photo of Celia Cruz onstage in a fluffy gown|[[Celia Cruz]], who broke barriers against women in [[salsa music]], was instrumental in popularizing the genre.]]
According to author Lise Waxer, Cuban [[trova]] singer [[María Teresa Vera]] is the "great-grandmother of all Latin women singers".{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=147}} "Arroz Con Leche" ("Rice Pudding"), which advises the listener to find a spouse who will take care of them, was criticized by [[feminist]] groups.{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=37}} [[Bolero]] lyrics have a central theme of women as the object of male desire, [[unrequited love]], and abandonment, portraying women as "physical absence and emotional distance, as ungrateful beings" unequipped to love a man.{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=137}} Cuban singer [[La Lupe]] "pushed the boundaries" of bolero music, and was called the queen of [[Latin soul]] music.{{sfn|Poey|2014}} She toured the U.S. with bandleader [[Tito Puente]], and was one of the most popular Latin performers of the 1960s.{{sfn|Pareles|1992}} In her youth she dominated local singing competitions, which inspired her to pursue a career in music despite her parents' desire for her to become a teacher.{{sfn|Pareles|1992}} After divorcing her first husband, La Lupe began a solo career and performed in [[Havana]] nightclubs.{{sfn|Pareles|1992}} Her popularity grew, and she owned and operated a nightclub in Cuba which was seized by the [[Cuba under Fidel Castro|Castro government]].{{sfn|Pareles|1992}} La Lupe emigrated to the United States, settled in New York in 1962 and began touring the country with other bolero and salsa performers.{{sfn|Pareles|1992}} She released several salsa albums with "devotional lyrics."{{sfn|Pareles|1992}} Her concert requests began diminishing at the turn of the 1970s as her savings drained because of her second husband's failing health.{{sfn|Pareles|1992}} She ended her professional career in a wheelchair at a final, 1985 concert with Puente to help pay her medical expenses.{{sfn|Pareles|1992}} La Lupe, who devoted her remaining years to [[Christian music]] in [[the Bronx]], died of [[cardiac arrest]] in February 1992.{{sfn|Pareles|1992}} Cuban singers [[Rita Montaner]] and [[Celeste Mendoza]] were involved in the "appropriation and rearticulation of [[rhumba|rumba]]", a genre popular before salsa.{{sfn|Poey|2014}}
 
As [[salsa music]] grew in popularity, [[Celia Cruz]] emerged during the 1950s and was known as the queen of the genre.{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=136}} Although Cruz was instrumental in popularizing and developing male-dominated salsa,{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=137}} few other women are associated with it.{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=137}} She was the only female singer featured in the British documentary, ''Salsa: Latin Pop Music in the Cities'' (1985), which noted the absence of women in the industry.{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=137}} According to the documentary, women were "not trained in popular music and that women dared not improvise—''sonear'' (closeness)—on stage".{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=137}} Cruz crossed boundaries set by public expectations for music performed at nightclubs, but she was the exception who proved the rule.{{sfn|Poey|2014}} Opportunities for all-female salsa bands were nonexistent; gender discrimination flourished in the market, and women were seen as "less competent than their male counterparts."{{sfn|Poey|2014}} In 1977 Cruz recorded "Usted Abusó", which gave a voice to [[violence against women|battered women]].{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=268}} The 1980s saw the emergence of [[salsa romántica]], which was "deemed as homogenized, depoliticized, and ultimately, feminized."{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=137}}
 
[[File:Gloriaestefan ahoy.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Gloria Estefan onstage, singing and holding flowers|In 1993, [[Gloria Estefan]] was the first musician to debut an album atop the ''Billboard'' [[Top Latin Albums]] chart.]]
During the 1990s women began playing a larger role in salsa music,{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=14}} increasing the genre's popularity,{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=136}} and female salsa singers broke "the sexist boundaries of the [Latin] music industry".{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=147}} Although women singers were becoming more popular, images of men were emphasized to the public more than those of women.{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=14}} [[La India]], Corinne, [[Brenda K. Starr]], [[Lissette Melendez]], and Yolanda la Duke were instrumental in refining salsa in that decade, although all were managed by men.{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=136}} Their new salsa sound was influenced by African American music ([[hip hop music|hip-hop]], [[contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]], [[gospel music|gospel]], [[jazz music|jazz]], and [[soul music|soul]]), which revolutionized traditional 1970s salsa.{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=136}} According to author Lise Waxer, a "careful and attentive listening" of their recordings indicated the "female authority and influence—a female genealogy—of salsa music."{{sfn|Waxer|2002|pp=136, 147}} Salsa's leading female singer was [[La India]],{{sfn|Candelaria|2004|p=412}} who developed salsa romantica music during the 1990s and whose lyrics "turn the tables" on the male salsa narrative of women as objects of desire, "cruel and evil or idealized and unattainable."{{sfn|Poey|2014}} In her most-popular song, "[[Ese Hombre (Rocío Jurado song)|Ese Hombre]]" (originally recorded by [[Rocío Jurado]]), La India contradicts male stereotypes.{{sfn|Poey|2014}} The song's lyrics describe a man who is "a fool/stupid and conceited/selfish and capricious", reversing male "discursive terrorism" toward their female partners.{{sfn|Poey|2014}} La India has been compared to Celia Cruz as leaders in their respective eras,{{sfn|Candelaria|2004|p=413}} and to La Lupe in musical style: "nasal style of singing, growls, and screams that evoke an androgynous style rather than a soft melodious tone."{{sfn|Poey|2014}}

In her Spanish-language debut, [[Gloria Estefan]] released ''[[Mi Tierra]]'' (1993). It was a commercial success, debuting atop the new US [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] [[Top Latin Albums]] chart. Estefan has been described by her [[Latin pop]] contemporaries as performing [[pop ballad]]s and [[soft rock]].{{sfn|Aparicio|2010|p=113}} She has also ventured into salsa and [[merengue music]], using salsa in her English-language compositions; "[[Conga (song)|Conga]]" brought her to European clubs.{{sfn|Broughton|Ellingham|Trillo|1999|p=499}} The rural Cuban genre [[guajira (music)|guajira]] offered a musical identity to [[Afro-Cuban]]s;{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=305}} [[Albita Rodriguez]] became popular, and was named one of the top 100 personalities of the 20th century by ''[[Newsweek (magazine)|Newsweek]]'' magazine.{{sfn|Novas|2007|p=323}} Most of her repertoire are love songs with "openly erotic lyrics" with hetero- and homosexual themes.{{sfn|Aparicio|2010|p=243}}

The duo of [[Monchy y Alexandra]] "established [[bachata (music)|bachata]] as a [[easy listening|'nice']] music that could be listened to in the home by women and children."{{sfn|Hernandez|2010|p=91}} Women "embraced [the] clean-up"; the romantic bachata style, with emotive lyrics, expressed longing for a lost lover.{{sfn|Hernandez|2010|p=91}} In 1950s bachata music, women were accused of "treachery or promiscuity or, in more humorous moments, referring to [[women sexuality|their sexuality]] and sexual organs with thinly veiled double entendres."{{sfn|Hernandez|2010|p=89}} The lyrics were rooted in an era where [[women in the workplace]] became more common, displacing men as [[breadwinner]]s.{{sfn|Hernandez|2010|p=89}}

In 19th-century merengue music, a man "won the love of woman" by dancing.{{sfn|Austerlitz|1997|p=34}} Modern merengue (a [[club music|party]] genre) lyrics explored the "vicissitudes of urban life [and] employed skillful wordplay and humorous double entendres about women and sex."{{sfn|Hernandez|2010|p=88}} Because of the genre's "air of male-dominated sexuality", [[People of the Dominican Republic|Dominican]] men believed that making merengue music is "no fitting occupation for women."{{sfn|Austerlitz|1997|p=116}} According to [[Santo Domingo|Santo Domingans]], listening to merengue music "is only for men" and a woman who enjoys the music is considered "a crazy girl [and] a bad girl."{{sfn|Austerlitz|1997|p=116}} During the 1970s, attitudes toward women and merengue music changed with the changing roles of women in Dominican society.{{sfn|Austerlitz|1997|p=116}} All-female merengue bands emerged in the 1980s, beginning with [[Las Chicas Del Can]] in 1984.{{sfn|Austerlitz|1997|p=116}} Participation in merengue increased in 1990, with women playing [[percussion]] and [[brass]] instruments formerly considered too difficult for women.{{sfn|Austerlitz|1997|p=116}}

Female merengue bands were often formed by successful male merengue musicians, who "often referred to them as the property of the [male musicians who formed them]."{{sfn|Austerlitz|1997|p=117}} The mainly-female merengue band [[Milly y los Vecinos|Milly, Jocelyn y Los Vecinos]] formed after Las Chicas del Can.{{sfn|Austerlitz|1997|p=117}} The group became popular, despite not setting out to challenge existing gender roles.{{sfn|Austerlitz|1997|p=117}} Feminists have noted the "limited values" in merengue recordings by women, since most of their songs are written by men who "do not resolutely challenge patriarchal attitudes."{{sfn|Austerlitz|1997|p=118}} [[Olga Tañón]] was the most successful female merengue artist in the 1990s,{{sfn|Hernandez|2010|p=88}} and has been called the queen of merengue music.{{sfn|Steingress|2002|p=13}} Tañón has been credited with popularizing merengue in [[Music of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico]], a salsa-dominated market.{{sfn|Morales|2003|p=248}} Her 1994 album, ''Siente el Amor'', outsold her previous recordings: ''[[Mujer de Fuego]]'' (1993) and her platinum-certified debut studio album, ''[[Sola]]'' (1992).{{sfn|Morales|2003|p=248}}

[[File:Jenni Rivera in Concert.jpg|thumb|alt=Jenni Rivera taking a break during a performance|[[Jenni Rivera]]'s recordings have sparked debate in the [[Latino]] community on women's roles.{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=671}}]]
Women finalists at the 2016 [[Billboard Latin Music Awards|''Billboard'' Latin Music Awards]] were outnumbered by men, which was described by the magazine as a "continuing [challenge] facing female artists in Latin music."{{sfn|Anon.|2016}} For 2017 [[International Women's Day]] and [[Women's History Month]], the [[music streaming]] service Spotify curated a playlist of women in Latin music.{{sfn|Flores|2017}} The playlist included music from Selena, Celia Cruz, and [[Natalia Lafourcade]].{{sfn|Flores|2017}} An April 2016 ''Billboard'' report noted the absence of women from the magazine's [[music chart]]s.{{sfn|Cobo|2016}} The report found that the last female soloist topped the US [[Hot Latin Songs]] chart four years earlier: Shakira, with [[Maná]] (a male rock en español group), singing "[[Mi Verdad (song)|Mi Verdad]]".{{sfn|Cobo|2016}} In 2012 seven women had number-ones on the Top Latin Albums chart, compared with 33 men.{{sfn|Cobo|2016}} ''Billboard'' executive Leila Cobo found that three of the seven women were veterans (Gloria Trevi, Thalía, and [[Ednita Nazario]]), and another three were deceased (Selena, Jenni Rivera, and [[Natalie Cole]].{{sfn|Cobo|2016}} [[Leslie Grace]] was the youngest female singer to reach number one on the [[Latin Airplay]] chart when she was 17 years old,{{sfn|Cobo|2016}} and Alexandra Lioutikoff was the first woman executive vice-president at [[Universal Music Publishing Group]]'s Latin division.{{sfn|Cobo|2016}} Asked why the visibility of women in Latin music has declined, [[Chiquis Rivera]] suggested that radio programmers are to blame for their "''machista'' culture."{{sfn|Cobo|2016}} According to Lioutikoff, women (unlike their male counterparts) "rarely collaborate".{{sfn|Cobo|2016}} In its report, ''Billboard'' compiled a list of the top five women with the most number-ones on the Hot Latin Songs; Gloria Estefan led the list with 15, Shakira had 10, Selena seven, Ana Gabriel six, and Paulina Rubio five.{{sfn|Cobo|2016}} The magazine found women "underrepresented on the Latin-music-focused ''Billboard'' charts", with Rubio the last female number-one with "Me Gustas Todo" on February 11, 2012.{{sfn|Cobo|2016}} A discrepancy existed between the Top Latin Albums and the ''Billboard'' 200 charts; seven women topped the Latin Albums chart, compared to 21 on the ''Billboard'' 200.{{sfn|Cobo|2016}}

Women remain a minority in Puerto Rican music.{{sfn|Fiol-Matta|2017}} According to Licia Fiol-Matta, the [[music industry]] has a "prejudiced practice of limiting the number of women recording artists" and women singers "did not sell records since women did not buy records."{{sfn|Fiol-Matta|2017}} In July 2017, Alejandra Guzmán and Gloria Trevi were the first female collaboration in the 24-year history of the Top Latin Albums chart to debut atop the chart.{{sfn|Zellner|2017}} In 2016, Mexican pop singer [[Sofia Reyes]] was the first female lead singer with a number-one single in five years.{{sfn|Benjamin|2017}} Her collaboration with [[Prince Royce]] on "[[Solo Yo]]" was the first number-one single on the [[Latin Pop Songs]] chart by a woman since Jennifer Lopez' "[[On the Floor|Ven A Bailar]]" (2011) with [[Pitbull (entertainer)|Pitbull]].{{sfn|Benjamin|2017}} Eight women have topped the Latin Pop Songs chart as featured acts, duos or groups with female leads: "Solo Yo" (Sofia Reyes with Prince Royce, April 23, 2016); "Mi Verdad" ([[Maná]], featuring Shakira, April 4, 2015); "[[Corre!]]" ([[Jesse &amp; Joy]], March 31, 2012); "[[Dutty Love]]" ([[Don Omar]] with [[Natti Natasha]], March 24, 2012), "[[Fuiste Tu]]" ([[Ricardo Arjona]] with [[Gaby Moreno]], March 10, 2012); "[[Give Me Everything]]" (Pitbull with [[Ne-Yo]], [[Afrojack]] and [[Nayer]], July 23, 2011), and "Ven A Bailar" (Jennifer Lopez with Pitbull, June 18, 2011).{{sfn|Mendizabal|2016}} Amaya Mendizabal of ''Billboard'' called the decline of women on the Latin music charts "an ongoing trend."{{sfn|Mendizabal|2016}} In 2015, 22 weeks passed without a female-led single on the 50-position Hot Latin Songs chart.{{sfn|Mendizabal|2016}} According to Mendizabal, the absence of women on the Latin music charts is "partly attributed to the steady popularity of reggaeton and regional Mexican music, which is often led by male acts."{{sfn|Mendizabal|2016}} Mendizabal wrote that "traditional pop songs" rarely top the Hot Latin Songs chart; four pop songs did so in the previous three years, most by men.{{sfn|Mendizabal|2016}} Sofia Reyes has expressed concern about the lack of women performers at Latin-music awards shows, telling Jeff Benjamin of [[Fuse TV]] that 90 percent of awards-show performers are men.{{sfn|Benjamin|2017}}

In July 2017, Spanish writer Daniela Bose noted the absence of women in Spanish music charts in comparison with those of [[Music of France|France]] and [[Music of Italy|Italy]]; culturally similar to Spain, women were more successful in the latter countries.{{sfn|Bose|2017}} Bose analyzed the [[Spanish Albums Chart|Spanish Albums]] and [[Spanish Singles Chart|Singles Charts]], finding that the only Spanish singers who placed in the top 50 were [[Malú]], [[Vanesa Martin]], Sweet California, [[India Martinez]], and the [[Spanish folk music]] singers [[Mónica Naranjo]] and [[Isabel Pantoja]].{{sfn|Bose|2017}} When Bose expanded her search to the next 50 positions, she found only non-Spanish singers.{{sfn|Bose|2017}} She concluded that listeners had replaced Spanish and [[Latin pop]] music with reggaeton and [[Trap music (hip hop)|trap music]], genres performed by men with lyrics belittling women "as meat".{{sfn|Bose|2017}} Bose found a [[subtext]] in the songs encouraging female [[infidelity]] for sexual reasons, alluding to a non-committed relationship.{{sfn|Bose|2017}} According to Bose, music "is not one of those 'secure' professions [for those who] seek stability"; she found women absent from prominent positions held by men, such as heading a record label, producing concerts, and [[audio engineer]]ing; in these fields, with higher pay and power, women lack "decision-making process[es] that set the path for [the Latin music] industry."{{sfn|Bose|2017}} She ended her report by urging the music industry to avoid gender imbalances in their markets: "What dazzles is the beauty of the final work, regardless of who creates it."{{sfn|Bose|2017}}
