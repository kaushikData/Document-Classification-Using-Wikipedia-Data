==Music career==
9th Wonder's first significant career breakthrough came in 2003 when, as an up-and-coming producer, he released an unofficial remix album of [[Nas (rapper)|Nas]]' 2002 album ''[[God's Son (album)|God's Son]]'' entitled ''[[God's Stepson]]''.&lt;ref name="hitquarters.com"/&gt; Released through internet outlets, the album garnered significant attention and acclaim.&lt;ref name="hitquarters.com"/&gt; The producer has said that he was not thinking in terms of using it to generate a buzz or promote his skills at that point: "I never thought any of this of me as a producer was going to happen."&lt;ref name="hitquarters.com"/&gt; The album has since been credited as starting the now regular trend for unofficial 'home-made' remixes of whole albums.&lt;ref name="hitquarters.com"/&gt;

9th Wonder began his career as the main producer for the group [[Little Brother (group)|Little Brother]]. As part of Little Brother he gained recognition and critical acclaim for his production on their debut 2003 release, ''[[The Listening (Little Brother album)|The Listening]]''. [[Jay-Z]]'s studio engineer Young Guru was impressed with his work, and contacted 9th Wonder, which led to 9th Wonder producing "Threat" for Jay-Z's 2003 ''[[The Black Album (Jay-Z album)|The Black Album]]''.&lt;ref name="hitquarters.com"/&gt; The cut proved to be a mainstream breakthrough for 9th Wonder, most immediately in the major production role he secured on Destiny's Child's 2004 ''[[Destiny Fulfilled]]'' album that Jay-Z was instrumental in helping bring about.&lt;ref name="hitquarters.com"/&gt; On the album, 9th Wonder produced the tracks "[[Girl (Destiny's Child song)|Girl]]" and "Is She the Reason," plus the bonus track "Game Over".

9th Wonder left Little Brother in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopgame.com/news.php3?id=1510 |title=Hip Hop News Audio, News, Videos, Albums, Ringtones, Lyrics, Urban Wear |publisher=HipHopGame.com |date=January 27, 2007 |accessdate=May 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Listen to More: Producer, Underground |url=http://www.djbooth.net/index/interviews/entry/9th-wonder-interview-1011071/ |title=9th Wonder Interview |publisher=Djbooth.net |date=October 10, 2007 |accessdate=May 12, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613162350/http://www.djbooth.net/index/interviews/entry/9th-wonder-interview-1011071/ |archivedate=June 13, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 29, 2007, 9th Wonder made a rare public appearance on [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]]'s ''[[Rap City (BET program)|Rap City]]'', alongside collaborator [[Talib Kweli]]. [[Madlib]], [[Jean Grae]] and [[Erykah Badu]] appeared as well. In 2010, he appeared on BET's ''[[106 &amp; Park]]'' countdown with [[David Banner]].

9th Wonder, E. Jones, and rapper [[J. Cole]] served as the lead producers of the soundtrack to the [[EA Sports]] video game ''[[NBA Elite 11]]''. 9th Wonder and J. Cole also appear as "secret characters" in ''[[NBA Jam (2010 video game)|NBA Jam]]'' with a team name of Cole &amp; Wonder.

9th Wonder debuted his rapping alter-ego 9thmatic in late 2009. 9thmatic appeared on songs with [[Khrysis]] and [[Sean Boog]], Big Remo, [[Murs (rapper)|Murs]] and Thee Tom Hardy.

9th Wonder worked with Mississippi rapper [[David Banner]] on a collaborative album entitled ''[[Death of a Pop Star]]'' which was released on December 21, 2010.  After forming Jamla Records in 2010, he then went on produce for Jill Scott, Dilated Peoples, Big Boi of Outkast, and Anderson .Paak.

==It's a Wonderful World Music Group==
In January 2009, 9th Wonder announced plans to start two independent record labels, Jamla and The Academy, under his imprint [[It's A Wonderful World Music Group]] (IWWMG). Jamla originally consisted of [[Skyzoo]], GQ, [[Rapsody]], Tyler Woods and Big Remo, while The Academy consisted of Thee Tom Hardy, Actual Proof (Sundown &amp; Enigma), TP, and [[The Away Team (group)|The Away Team]] ([[Khrysis]] &amp; [[Sean Boog]]). The Academy artists were later folded into the Jamla label. Halo and Heather Victoria were announced as the newest members of IWWMG in October 2010.  Jamla Records now consists of artists GQ, Rapsody, Actual Proof, TP, Halo, &amp; Heather Victoria.

In July 2004 a.d., 9th Wonder officially debuted his production team for IWWMG. The Soul Council consists of [[Khrysis]], E. Jones, Ka$h Don't Make Beats, AMP, Eric G., Nottz, Hi-Tek and 9th Wonder himself.

==Recent and current projects==
In 2010, independent filmmaker Kenneth Price documented 9th Wonder's travels for an entire year. This included his times in the studio, classes he taught at [[Duke University]], and performances with Murs at the [[Rock the Bells#2010 Festival Series|2010 Rock the Bells Festival]], along with interviews with 9th Wonder about his life and career. All of this was compiled in a [[Lifted Research Group]]-sponsored documentary film titled ''The Wonder Year''. The film features appearances by [[Drake (entertainer)|Drake]], DJ Premier, [[DJ Green Lantern]], J. Cole, Murs, Lucas Rivers, [[Sha Money XL]], Young Guru, [[The Alchemist (musician)|The Alchemist]] and others. Price went on to direct music videos for artists on 9th Wonder's Jamla Records label.   In 2016, 9th Wonder's Jamla Records imprint signed a joint venture with [[Jay-Z]] and [[Roc Nation]].

In August 2010, Drake exchanged tweets with 9th Wonder on Twitter, expressing his desire to work with him again (the first time being the production of "Think Good Thoughts" featuring [[Phonte]] and [[Elzhi]] for his 2007 mixtape ''[[Comeback Season (mixtape)|Comeback Season]]''). It was revealed in October 2010 that 9th Wonder would be producing for Drake on his second album ''[[Take Care (album)|Take Care]]'', which was released on November 15, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Horowitz |first=Steven J. |url=http://www.rap-up.com/2010/10/07/drake-shares-producers-on-second-album-still-uncertain-of-title/ |title=Drake Shares Producers on Second Album, Still Uncertain of Title |publisher=Rap-Up Magazine |date=October 7, 2010 |accessdate=October 11, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101010102448/http://www.rap-up.com/2010/10/07/drake-shares-producers-on-second-album-still-uncertain-of-title/| archivedate= October 10, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a month prior to the release, 9th Wonder said in an interview that he would not appear on ''Take Care'' due to [[A&amp;R]] issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Iraheta|first=Mark|title=9th Wonder Will Not Appear on Drake's 'Take Care'|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2011/10/9th-wonder-will-not-appear-on-drakes-take-care|accessdate=October 16, 2011|newspaper=Complex Magazine|date=October 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Singer [[Chris Brown (American entertainer)|Chris Brown]] recorded a series of rap freestyles over 9th Wonder beats. The first was released on July 18, 2011, on YouTube under the title "Real Hip Hop #3." This was followed a day later by "Real Hip Hop #4" featuring [[Kevin McCall]]. These tracks were included in Brown's rap mixtape ''Boy In Detention'', released on August 5, 2011.&lt;ref name=9th-brownmixtape&gt;{{cite news|last=Markman|first=Rob|title=Chris Brown Drops Rap Mixtape, Boy In Detention|url=http://rapfix.mtv.com/2011/08/05/chris-brown-drops-rap-mixtape-boy-in-detention/|accessdate=August 5, 2011|publisher=MTV|date=August 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

9th Wonder produced [[Jill Scott]]'s "Beautiful Love" ft. [[BJ The Chicago Kid]] on her 2015 album release "Woman".  Rising Star [[Anderson .Paak]] also sought out 9th Wonder's production for "The Season" and "Without You" featuring [[Rapsody]] on his breakthrough release ''[[Malibu (album)|Malibu]]'' released coincidentally on 9th Wonder's birthday, January 15, 2016. 9th Wonder also collaborated with [[Big Boi]] of [[Outkast]] for the song "Put It On Her" for his release [[Big Grams]] in 2015.  In 2017, [[Kendrick Lamar]] tapped 9th Wonder to produce [[Duckworth (song)|DUCKWORTH.]],  the final track on his 4th studio album, ''[[Damn (Kendrick Lamar album)|DAMN]]'', where Kendrick tells the backstory of the meeting between his father and [[Anthony Tiffith]], also known as "Top Dawg" from [[Top Dawg Entertainment|TDE]].

==Hip hop professor and academia==
2007 saw a sideline move into music academia for 9th Wonder when he, along with [[Christopher "Play" Martin]] from hip hop group [[Kid-n-Play]], was appointed Artist-In-Residence by the Chancellor of [[North Carolina Central University]], and began instructing a hip hop history class in NCCU's Music Dept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nccu.edu/directory/details.cfm?id=pdouthit&amp;search=&amp;department=Music |title=Online Campus Directory |publisher=Nccu.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His role as a music professor has proven an ongoing one as in January 2010 it was announced that 9th Wonder would co-teach a class titled "Sampling Soul" with Dr. Mark Anthony Neal at Duke University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.xxlmag.com/online/?p=67160 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130209234152/http://www.xxlmag.com/online/?p=67160 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-02-09 |title=9th Wonder to Teach Course at Duke University &amp;#124; XXL |publisher=Xxlmag.com |date=2010-01-07 |accessdate=2012-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with [[HitQuarters]], he explained the reason for the move into academia: "Educating the youth on where hip-hop comes from and the history of it, using the records we use, gives hip-hop a longer life. I decided to become an advocate of that."&lt;ref name="hitquarters.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_9thWonder_Interview.html |title=Interview With 9th Wonder |publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=May 31, 2010 |accessdate=Jun 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 9th Wonder also recently took on a course titled "Intro To Hip Hop Production" &lt;ref&gt;[https://trinity.duke.edu/directory/people/d]&lt;/ref&gt;

9th has only continued his trek into the world of education, recently receiving acceptance from [[Harvard University]] to become a fellow in the Hip Hop Archive. 9th will spend three years working on a research project at Harvard’s W.E.B. Dubois Institute. For 9th's project titled "These Are The Breaks" he will be researching the original records that created his top 10 produced albums. He recently told XXL that he one day hopes to leave producing behind for good to focus on academics. A documentary also created by Kenneth Price, "The Hip-Hop Fellow" chronicled  9th becoming a W.E.B. Dubois Fellow at [[Harvard University]] under the direction Dr. [[Henry Louis Gates, Jr.]] and Dr. Marcy Morgan at the Dubois Institute at The Hutchins Center.

He has continued his involvement with higher education by lecturing at various universities across the United States. In September 2012, 9th Wonder visited the [http://www.umich.edu/ University of Michigan] to speak on his beginnings in the music industry and hip hop's role in the classroom. His involvement with some of the top academic institutions in the country has validated hip hop as a true art form.  9th Wonder served as Artist In Residence at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in the Spring of 2016. In March 2017, 9th Wonder was the Artist in Residence at the [[University of Virginia]], giving his final lecture in [[The Rotunda (University of Virginia)|The Rotunda]] on the University grounds. Several other hip hop artists have found themselves on similar paths into the education realm including [[Questlove]] of [[The Roots]] and [[Bun B]] of [[UGK]].  9th is currently Artist of Residence at [[North Carolina Central University]] and [[Duke University]].

9th Wonder was also appointed to the Executive Committee of Hip-Hop and Rap at The [[National Museum of African American History and Culture]] at [[The Smithsonian]] in Washington, DC.  He also has an exhibit on the 4th Floor in the Music Crossroads Section.

'''Agnes of Bohemia''' ({{lang-cs|Anežka Přemyslovna}}, {{lang-pl|Agnieszka Przemyślidka}})  (1305–1337) was the only child of King [[Wenceslaus II of Bohemia]] by his second wife, [[Elisabeth Richeza of Poland]]. She was a member of the [[Přemyslid dynasty]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

== Family ==
Her father's previous marriage to [[Judith of Habsburg]] had produced four surviving children, [[Wenceslaus III of Bohemia]], [[Anne of Bohemia (1290–1313)|Anna of Bohemia]], [[Elisabeth of Bohemia (1292–1330)|Elisabeth of Bohemia]] and [[Margaret of Bohemia (1296-1322)|Margaret of Bohemia]]. Wenceslaus II died in 1305 and his heir Wenceslaus III was assassinated one year later, in [[Olomouc]], on his way to Poland.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Agnes' mother, [[Elisabeth Richeza of Poland|Elisabeth]], subsequently married [[Rudolph I of Bohemia|Rudolph III]], son of [[Albert of Habsburg]] ([[King of the Romans]]){{Clarify|date=June 2009}} on 16 October 1306. Rudolph was chosen to be King of Bohemia by part of Czech nobility and Elisabeth remained queen for a short time. Rudolph died 4 July 1307 of [[dysentery]] after becoming ill during the siege of the fortress of one of revolting noblemen, [[Bavorové ze Strakonice|Bavor III of Strakonice]]. In his last will, Rudolph acknowledged Elizabeth's [[dowry town]]s and entailed her a huge amount of money.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

== Marriage ==
Elisabeth arranged for Agnes to marry [[Henry I of Jawor]]. The wedding took place in 1316, however, because the two were related in the fourth degree of [[kinship]], a [[papal dispensation]] was required. It was granted in 1325. Agnes' brother in law, King [[John of Bohemia]] opposed the marriage, which would make Henry a powerful rival, along with [[Bolesław III the Generous]], the husband of [[Margaret of Bohemia, Duchess of Wroclaw|Margaret of Bohemia]], a half-sister of Agnes. {{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Shortly after the wedding and, with the consent of Elisabeth, Henry I went with his troops to her dowry town  {{Clarify|date=June 2009}}, [[Hradec Králové]] in [[North Bohemia]], where he organized expeditions to support rebels against King [[John of Bohemia]].

Agnes had only one pregnancy which ended in a [[miscarriage]], in the first trimester, when she rode with her horse over a hill. This accident kept her in bed for many months. Agnes died in 1337, only two years after her mother and nine years before her husband. {{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12886">The '''baroreflex''' or '''baroreceptor reflex''' is one of the body's [[homeostasis|homeostatic]] mechanisms that helps to maintain [[blood pressure]] at nearly constant levels. The baroreflex provides a rapid [[negative feedback loop]] in which an elevated blood pressure reflexively causes the [[heart rate]] to decrease and also causes blood pressure to decrease. Decreased blood pressure decreases baroreflex activation and causes heart rate to increase and to restore blood pressure levels. The baroreflex can begin to act in less than the duration of a cardiac cycle (fractions of a second) and thus baroreflex adjustments are key factors in dealing with postural [[hypotension]], the tendency for blood pressure to decrease on standing due to gravity.

The system relies on specialized [[neuron]]s, known as [[baroreceptor]]s, in the [[aortic arch]], [[carotid sinus]]es, and elsewhere to monitor changes in blood pressure and relay them to the Medulla. Baroreceptors are stretch receptors and respond to the pressure induced stretching of the blood vessel in which they are found. Baroreflex induced changes in blood pressure are mediated by both branches of the [[autonomic nervous system]]: the [[parasympathetic nervous system|parasympathetic]] and [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] nerves. Baroreceptors are active even at normal blood pressures so that their activity informs the brain about both increases and decreases in blood pressure.

The body contains two other, slower acting systems to regulate blood pressure: the heart releases [[atrial natriuretic peptide]] when blood pressure is too high, and the kidneys sense and correct low blood pressure with the [[renin–angiotensin system]].

==Anatomy of the reflex==
Baroreceptors are present in the [[atrium (heart)|atria]] of the [[heart]] and [[vena cavae]], but the most sensitive baroreceptors are in the [[carotid sinus]]es and [[aortic arch]]. While the [[carotid sinus]] [[baroreceptor]] axons travel within the [[glossopharyngeal nerve]] (CN IX), the aortic arch baroreceptor axons travel within the [[vagus nerve]] (CN X). Baroreceptor activity travels along these nerves directly into the central nervous system to contact neurons within the [[nucleus of the solitary tract]] (NTS) in the brainstem. Baroreceptor information flows from these NTS neurons to both parasympathetic and sympathetic neurons within the brainstem.

The NTS neurons send excitatory fibers ([[glutamate]]rgic) to the [[caudal ventrolateral medulla]] (CVLM), activating the CVLM.  The activated CVLM then sends inhibitory fibers (GABAergic) to the [[rostral ventrolateral medulla]] (RVLM), thus inhibiting the RVLM.  The RVLM is the primary regulator of the [[sympathetic nervous system]], sending excitatory fibers ([[glutamate]]rgic) to the [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] preganglionic neurons located in the [[intermediolateral nucleus]] of the spinal cord.  Hence, when the baroreceptors are activated (by an increased blood pressure), the NTS activates the CVLM, which in turn inhibits the RVLM, thus decreasing the activity of the [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] branch of the autonomic nervous system, leading to a relative decrease in blood pressure.  Likewise, low blood pressure activates baroreceptors less and causes an increase in [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] tone via "disinhibition" (less inhibition, hence activation) of the RVLM. Cardiovascular targets of the sympathetic nervous system includes both blood vessels and the heart.

Even at resting levels of blood pressure, arterial baroreceptor discharge activates NTS neurons. Some of these NTS neurons are tonically activated by this resting blood pressure and thus activate excitatory fibers to the nucleus ambiguus and [[Dorsal nucleus of vagus nerve]] to regulate the [[parasympathetic nervous system]]. These parasympathetic neurons send axons to the heart and parasympathetic activity  slows cardiac pacemaking and thus heart rate. This parasympathetic activity is further increased during conditions of elevated blood pressure.  Note that the parasympathetic nervous system is primarily directed toward the heart.

==Baroreceptor activation==
The [[baroreceptors]] are [[stretching|stretch]]-sensitive [[mechanoreceptor]]s. At low pressures, baroreceptors become inactive. When blood pressure rises, the carotid and aortic sinuses are distended further, resulting in increased stretch and, therefore, a greater degree of activation of the baroreceptors. At normal resting blood pressures, many baroreceptors are actively reporting blood pressure information and the baroreflex is actively modulating autonomic activity. Active baroreceptors fire [[action potential]]s ("spikes") more frequently. The greater the stretch the more rapidly baroreceptors fire action potentials. Many individual baroreceptors are inactive at normal resting pressures and only become activated when their stretch or pressure threshold is exceeded.

Baroreceptor action potentials are relayed to the [[solitary nucleus]], which uses frequency as a measure of blood pressure. Increased activation of the solitary nucleus inhibits the [[vasomotor center]] and stimulates the [[vagal]] nuclei. The end-result of baroreceptor activation is inhibition of the [[sympathetic nervous system]] and activation of the [[parasympathetic nervous system]].

The [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] and [[parasympathetic]] branches of the [[autonomic nervous system]] have opposing effects on blood pressure. Sympathetic activation leads to an elevation of [[total peripheral resistance]] and [[cardiac output]] via increased [[contractility]] of the heart, [[heart rate]], and arterial [[vasoconstriction]], which tends to increase blood pressure. Conversely, [[parasympathetic]] activation leads to decreased [[cardiac output]] via decrease in heart rate, resulting in a tendency to lower blood pressure.

By coupling [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] inhibition and [[parasympathetic]] activation, the baroreflex maximizes blood pressure reduction. [[sympathetic nervous system|Sympathetic]] inhibition leads to a drop in peripheral resistance, while parasympathetic activation leads to a depressed heart rate ([[reflex bradycardia]]) and [[contractility]]. The combined effects will dramatically decrease blood pressure.

In a similar manner, [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] activation with [[parasympathetic]] inhibition allows the baroreflex to elevate blood pressure.

==Set point and tonic activation==
Baroreceptor firing has an inhibitory effect on sympathetic outflow. The sympathetic neurons fire at different rates which determines the release of norepinephrine onto cardiovascular targets. Norepinephrine constricts blood vessels to increase blood pressure. When baroreceptors are stretched (due to an increased blood pressure) their firing rate increases which in turn decreases the sympathetic outflow resulting in reduced norepinephrine and thus blood pressure. When the blood pressure is low, baroreceptor firing is reduced and this in turn results in augmented sympathetic outflow and increased norepinephrine release on the heart and blood vessels, increasing blood pressure.

==Effect on heart rate variability==
The baroreflex may be responsible for a part of the low-frequency component of [[heart rate variability]], the so-called [[Mayer waves]], at 0.1&amp;nbsp;Hz. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sleight|first1=Peter|last2=La Rovere|first2=Maria Teresa|last3=Mortara|first3=Andrea|last4=Pinna|first4=Gianni|last5=Maestri|first5=Roberto|last6=Leuzzi|first6=Stefano|last7=Bianchini|first7=Beatrice|last8=Tavazzi|first8=Luigi|last9=Bernardi|first9=Luciano|title=Physiology and Pathophysiology of Heart Rate and Blood Pressure Variability in Humans: Is Power Spectral Analysis Largely An Index of Baroreflex Gain?|journal=Clinical Science|date=1 January 1995|volume=88|issue=1|pages=103–109|doi=10.1042/cs0880103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Baroreflex activation therapy for treatment of resistant hypertension==
[[File:Baroreflex activation.svg|thumb|Baroreflex activation is distinct from vagal stimulation. It works through an afferent limb which has the double effect of stimulating vagal outflow and attenuating global sympathetic outflow.]]
The baroreflex can be [[Baroreflex activation therapy|used clinically to treat hypertension]]. As of 2018, there have been 7 clinical studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wallbach|first1=M|last2=Koziolek|first2=MJ|title=Baroreceptors in the carotid and hypertension-systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of baroreflex activation therapy on blood pressure.|journal=Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association|date=9 November 2017|doi=10.1093/ndt/gfx279|pmid=29136223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scheffers|first1=IJ|last2=Kroon|first2=AA|last3=Schmidli|first3=J|last4=Jordan|first4=J|last5=Tordoir|first5=JJ|last6=Mohaupt|first6=MG|last7=Luft|first7=FC|last8=Haller|first8=H|last9=Menne|first9=J|last10=Engeli|first10=S|last11=Ceral|first11=J|last12=Eckert|first12=S|last13=Erglis|first13=A|last14=Narkiewicz|first14=K|last15=Philipp|first15=T|last16=de Leeuw|first16=PW|title=Novel baroreflex activation therapy in resistant hypertension: results of a European multi-center feasibility study.|journal=Journal of the American College of Cardiology|date=5 October 2010|volume=56|issue=15|pages=1254-8|doi=10.1016/j.jacc.2010.03.089|pmid=20883933}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These have shown that stimulation of the baroreceptors from a pacemaker-like device lowers blood pressure in people with treatment-resistant hypertension.

The observed reduction in systolic blood pressure at the longest available follow-up is 36mmHg (359 patients). In the first 6 months the average blood pressure drop is 21 mmHg (307 patients). For patients in Europe, baroreflex activation therapy devices have received the CE Mark for treatment of resistant hypertension.

==Baroreflex activation therapy for treatment of heart failure==

The ability of baroreflex activation therapy to reduce sympathetic nerve activity suggests a potential in the treatment of chronic heart failure, because in this condition there is often intense sympathetic activation and patients with such sympathetic activation show a markedly increased risk of fatal arrhythmias and death.

One trial&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abraham|first1=WT|last2=Zile|first2=MR|last3=Weaver|first3=FA|last4=Butter|first4=C|last5=Ducharme|first5=A|last6=Halbach|first6=M|last7=Klug|first7=D|last8=Lovett|first8=EG|last9=Müller-Ehmsen|first9=J|last10=Schafer|first10=JE|last11=Senni|first11=M|last12=Swarup|first12=V|last13=Wachter|first13=R|last14=Little|first14=WC|title=Baroreflex Activation Therapy for the Treatment of Heart Failure With a Reduced Ejection Fraction.|journal=JACC.

The BeAT-HF randomized controlled trial is now underway in the USA and Europe to assess effects on symptoms, exercise capacity and blood markers of heart failure, and will continue to address morbidity and mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barostim Therapy for Heart Failure|title=BeAT-HF|url=https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02627196|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Wilhelmina Beatrice Rahner''' (January 23, 1876 &amp;ndash; February 11, 1943), better known as '''Bess Houdini''', was the stage assistant and wife of [[Harry Houdini]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/272947/Harry-Houdini?source=ONTHISDAY |title=Harry Houdini |work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |accessdate=March 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Wilhelmina Beatrice Rahner was born in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]] (before New York City was consolidated) in 1876 to [[Germans|German]] immigrants Gebhard Rahner (a cabinet maker) and Balbina Rahner (née Bugel).

Bess was working at [[Coney Island]] in a song and dance act called The Floral Sisters when she was first courted by Houdini's younger brother, Theo (aka [[Theodore Hardeen]]). But it was the older Houdini brother, Harry, that she fell in love with and married on June 22, 1894.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wildabouthoudini.com/2011/01/this-weekend-we-are-wild-about-bess.html|title=This weekend we are Wild About Bess|accessdate=January 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair worked as The Houdinis for several years before Houdini hit it big as The Handcuff King. But he and Bess continued to occasionally perform their signature trick, Metamorphosis, throughout his career. Bess also looked after their menagerie of pets, collected dolls, and made the costumes for Houdini's full evening roadshow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wildabouthoudini.com/2011/04/dorothy-young-remembers-her-days-with.html|title=Dorothy Young remembers her days with Houdini|accessdate=April 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Houdinis remained childless throughout their marriage. Bess's niece, Marie Hinson Blood, said Bess suffered from a medical condition that prevented her from having children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wildabouthoudini.com/2011/07/problem-with-bessie.html|title=Wild About Harry|accessdate=April 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Houdini died on October 31, 1926, Bess opened a [[tea house]] in New York, and briefly performed a vaudeville act in which she froze a man in ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wildabouthoudini.com/2011/01/bess-and-frozen-man.html|title=Bess and the frozen man|accessdate=January 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s she moved to Hollywood, California, and worked to promote Houdini's memory along with her manager and partner, Edward Saint. On [[Halloween]] 1936, Bess and Saint conducted a "Final Houdini Séance" on the roof of the Knickerbocker Hotel in Hollywood. At the conclusion of the failed séance, beside a photograph of Houdini, she put out the candle that was said to have burned for ten years. In 1943 she said "ten years [was] long enough to wait for any man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Harry Houdini|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,774270,00.html|quote=The late, great prestidigitator Harry Houdini, famed foe of phony mediums, and his wife Beatrice agreed before his death to try to get in touch with each other afterwards. Gravely ill last week in Hollywood, his widow announced that she had not only given up trying but had her doubts about the existence of a hereafter. She had held seances every year for ten years, unsuccessfully. "Ten years," observed patient Mrs. Houdini last week, "is long enough to wait for any man."|work=[[TIME (magazine)|TIME]]|date=February 15, 1943|accessdate=2008-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1936 séance, Bess passed the torch to [[Walter B. Gibson]] writer of the famous mystery series "[[The Shadow]]" and friend, confidant, publicist and [[ghostwriter]] for Houdini, and asked him to carry on the yearly tribute, who held them for many years at New York's [[Magic Towne House]] with such magical notables as Houdini biographers [[Walter B. Gibson]] and [[Milbourne Christopher]]. Before he died, Walter passed on the tradition&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blueridgegazette.blogspot.com/2006/05/houdini-museum.html|title=Houdini Museum|accessdate=January 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Dorothy Dietrich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TNSJournal|first=Michael|last=Williams|accessdate = October 29, 2014|url=http://tnsjournal.com/culture/annual-houdini-seance-held-halloween}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bess Houdini died from a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on February 11, 1943 while in [[Needles, California]], aboard an eastbound train traveling from Los Angeles to New York City. She was 67 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wildabouthoudini.com/2013/09/audio-marie-hinson-remembers-death-of.html|title=AUDIO: Marie Hinson remembers the death of her sister Bess Houdini=September 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Death of Bess Houdini|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,774340,00.html|quote=Beatrice Rahner Houdini, 67, widow of Prestidigitator Harry Houdini, famed escape artist, exposer of phony mediums; of a heart ailment; in Needles, Calif., aboard an eastbound train from Los Angeles|work=[[TIME (magazine)|TIME]]|date=February 22, 1943|accessdate=2008-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mrs. Harry Houdini.

==In film==
Bess Houdini appeared as herself in the 1938 film ''Religious Racketeers'' (a.k.a. ''Mystic Circle Murder'') directed by Frank O'Conner and produced by Fanchon Royer. In the film, she expressed her belief that communication with those who have died is impossible. The film sparked controversy among spiritualists, but was praised by magicians. It was released on DVD in 2006 by Alpha Video.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.wildabouthoudini.com/2011/04/when-madame-houdini-spoke.html |title = When Madame Houdini spoke|accessdate = April 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bess has been portrayed in film by [[Janet Leigh]] (''[[Houdini (film)|Houdini]]'', 1953), [[Sally Struthers]] (''[[The Great Houdini (film)|The Great Houdini]]'', 1976), [[Stacy Edwards]] ([[Houdini (1998 film)|''Houdini'']], 1998), and [[Kristen Connolly]] (''[[Houdini (miniseries)|Houdini]]'', 2014).

'''Robert Coltman Bolam''' (28 February 1896&amp;nbsp;– 1964) was an English [[association football|footballer]] who made 79 appearances in [[the Football League]] playing as an [[outside forward]], mainly at outside right, for [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], [[Darlington F.C.|Darlington]], [[South Shields F.C.

==Life and career==
Bolam was the eighth of nine children of William Bolam, a general labourer, and his wife Margaret Agnes. He was born and raised in [[Birtley, County Durham]], and at the time of the 1911 Census, was working as a driver in a colliery.&lt;ref name=1901Census&gt;{{cite web |url=http://search.findmypast.co.uk/record?id=gbc/1901/0029787906 |subscription=yes |via=Findmypast |title=1901 England, Wales &amp; Scotland Census Transcription 3, St Johns Place, Birtley, Chester Le Street, Durham, England |at=Robt Bolam.

After the war, Bolam joined [[Football League First Division]] club [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]]. He made his debut in a 2–0 win against then league leaders, [[West Bromwich Albion]], in February 1920,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tamworthherald.co.uk/February-brings-mixed-fortunes-West-Bromwich/story-20538904-detail/story.html |title=February brings mixed fortunes for West Bromwich Albion |first=Ian |last=Edmunds |newspaper=Tamworth Herald |date=1 February 2014 |accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in March, he scored, as well as creating several chances, in a 3–2 defeat at [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in [[Charlie Buchan|Charles Buchan]]'s [[benefit match]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000276/19200317/080/0005 |title=Buchan's benefit |newspaper=Telegraph and Star |location=Sheffield |date=17 March 1920 |page=5 |subscription=yes |via=British Newspaper Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Sheffield Star|Telegraph and Star]]'', "he is speedy and invariably puts across a good ball, whilst his ability to use both feet enables him to meet his man with confidence and success".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000276/19200322/052/0003 |title=Football gossip |last='Free Lance' |newspaper=Telegraph and Star |location=Sheffield |date=22 March 1920 |page=3 |subscription=yes |via=British Newspaper Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; But he was unable to keep his place, and at the end of the 1921–22 season, was not included on the club's retained list, and signed for [[Darlington F.C.|Darlington]] of the [[Football League Third Division North|Third Division]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000324/19220708/065/0004 |title=Close season gossip |newspaper=Daily Mail |location=Hull |date=8 July 1922 |page=4 |subscription=yes |via=British Newspaper Archive |quote=When Sheffield United signed on R.

'''Bolesław-Jerzy II''' (1305/1310 – April 7, 1340) was a ruler of the Polish [[Piast dynasty]] who ruled the originally [[Ruthenia]]n principality of [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]]. After his death started the [[Galicia–Volhynia Wars]] over succession of Galicia and Volhynia.

Bolesław was born between 1305 and 1310&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jasiński |first=Kazimierz |authorlink=Kazimierz Jasiński (historian) |title=Rodowód Piastów mazowieckich |year=1998 |publisher=Wydawnictwo Historyczne |location=Poznań - Wrocław |isbn=83-913563-0-2 |page=59 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Trojden I of Masovia]] from the [[Piast dynasty]], Duke of [[Czersk, Masovian Voivodeship|Czersk]] and Maria, daughter of [[George I of Halych|Yuri I]], [[prince of Galicia]]. Since his father was still a ruler of the family's Masovian lands, in 1323 Bolesław, renamed Jerzy, became Prince of Galicia. He also received the [[Duchy of Belz]] after the childless death of [[Andrew of Galicia]]. In 1331 he married daughter of [[Grand Duke of Lithuania]] [[Gediminas]] and sister of [[Aldona of Lithuania]], wife of [[Casimir III of Poland]]. Name of Bolesław's wife is disputed. T. Narbutt wrote that her pagan name was Eufemia and her Christian name was Maria.&lt;ref name=Jasinski60&gt;{{cite book |last=Jasiński |first=Kazimierz |authorlink=Kazimierz Jasiński (historian) |title=Rodowód Piastów mazowieckich |year=1998 |publisher=Wydawnictwo Historyczne |location=Poznań - Wrocław |isbn=83-913563-0-2 |page=60 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oswald Balzer supposed that her Christian name was Eufemia.&lt;ref name=Jasinski60/&gt; Kazimierz Jasiński supposed that whole Narbutt's account was fabrication.&lt;ref name=Jasinski60/&gt;

In a treaty of 1338 Bolesław Jerzy offered [[Casimir III of Poland]] succession to the throne of [[Galicia-Volhynia]]. Duke Boleslaw was supported by the many townspeople living there. In 1324 Boleslaw located the towns of [[Volodymyr-Volynskyi]] on [[Magdeburg law]], and [[Sanok]] in 1339.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dziedzictwo.polska.pl/gal/118/150/15/big.jpg Sanok city privilege in Latin (Digitalbibliothek of AGAD, Nr 7226.)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081031052705/http://dziedzictwo.polska.pl/gal/118/150/15/big.jpg |date=2008-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was poisoned in 1340 by [[Eastern Orthodox Church|orthodox]] [[boyar]]s and died without an heir, before his father who continued rule [[Mazovians|Masovian]] principality.

After Bolesław Jerzy's death the Kingdom of Galicia was gradually annexed by the [[Kingdom of Poland (1320–1385)|kingdom of Poland]] between 1340 and 1366, during the reign of [[Casimir III of Poland]].

}}'''Bruno Jacquet Ossébi''', also known as Bruno Jacquet or Ossébi (December 10, 1964 – February 2, 2009), was a [[French people|Franco]]-[[Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] journalist for the online news site ''[[Mwinda]]''. Ossébi was working to expose government corruption when a mysterious fire broke out in his home. He sustained fatal injuries, and died in a military hospital in [[Brazzaville]], [[Republic of the Congo]] twelve days later.&lt;ref name=theguardian&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2009/feb/12/africa-press-freedom1|title=Congo journalist dies after fire|first=Roy|last=Greenslade|date=12 February 2009|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal==
Bruno Ossébi was born in [[France]], and originally given the name Bruno Jacquet. He was born on December 10, 1964 to a French father and a Congolese mother. He moved to the Republic of Congo in the early 1990s to pursue a career in blogging and journalism. He began writing for the Congolese web site ''Mwinda'' about hot-button political issues. Ossébi was thought to be protected as a French citizen, and cousin of several barons; however, he received several threats throughout his career.&lt;ref name=lemonde&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/afrique/article/2009/07/09/la-mort-mysterieuse-d-un-journaliste-franco-congolais-a-brazzaville_1217113_3212.html|title=La mort mystérieuse d'un journaliste franco-congolais à Brazzaville|date=9 July 2009|publisher=|via=Le Monde}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ossébi was not married, but lived with his girlfriend and her two children. They also died in the house fire that killed Ossébi.&lt;ref name=rsf&gt;http://fr.rsf.org/congo-rapport-d-enquete-sur-la-mort-du-09-07-2009,33758.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Ossébi was an activist throughout his career. He wrote for ''Mwinda'', and also created a personal blog (bruno-ossbi.novoblog.com). He began writing for ''Mwinda'' when President [[Denis Sassou-Nguesso]] came to power in the early 1990s. Ossébi sought to condemn the plundering of oil, timber, and violations of human rights in the Republic of Congo. He was also active in the StAR program of the [[World Bank]], and active with the [[United Nations]] program that recovers misappropriated African assets. Ossébi spent two years working with lawyers, activists, and citizens to develop a court complaint against President Sassou Nguesso, [[List of Presidents of Gabon|President of Gabon]] [[Omar Bongo]], and [[List of Presidents of Equatorial Guinea|President of Equatorial Guinea]] [[Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo|Teodoro Obiang]], accusing them of "misappropriation of public funds".&lt;ref name=mediapart&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mediapart.fr/journal/france/081208/plaintes-menaces-l-enquete-qui-affole-omar-bongo-et-d-autres-dirigeants-africa|title=Plaintes, menaces: l'enquête qui affole Omar Bongo et d'autres dirigeants africains|publisher=mediapart}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;!--end wikitable--&gt;On January 21, 2009, two fires broke out 6,000&amp;nbsp;km away from each other in two different Franco-Congolese journalist’s homes. Bruno Ossébi in Brazzaville, Republic of Congo, and Benjamin Toungamani in France. Both journalists, Ossébi included, were plaintiff’s in an “ill-gotten gains” complaint filed weeks before.&lt;ref name=cpj1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cpj.org/2009/02/after-mysterious-fire-online-journalist-dead-in-re.php|title=After mysterious fire, online columnist dead in Congo - Committee to Protect Journalists|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ossébi and Toungamani both heavily criticized Denis Sassou Nguesso’s authoritarianism, and his lavish lifestyle at the expense of the Congolese people.&lt;ref name=africatime&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fr.africatime.com/congo/videos/la-mort-de-bruno-ossebi|title=La mort de Bruno Ossébi|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ossébi was able to escape the home, but died in a military hospital twelve days later.

There was no serious investigation or autopsy after the fires, according to [[Reporters Without Borders]].&lt;ref name=afriquesenlutte&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afriquesenlutte.org/afrique-centrale/congo-brazzaville/article/congo-brazzaville-il-faut-relancer|title=Afriques en Lutte|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruno Ossébi’s official cause of death was “cardiac arrest”, and no mention of burns were notated, even though 30% of his body was covered.&lt;ref name=cpj2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cpj.org/reports/2009/04/republic-of-congo-special-report-from-a-fatal-fire.php|title=Republic of Congo Special Report: From a Fatal Fire, Many Questions  - Committee to Protect Journalists|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
Three days before the fire broke out in Bruno Ossébi’s home, he published an article on ''Mwinda'' press. The article revealed that [[Société Nationale des Pétroles du Congo]], a petroleum company led by President Denis Sassou-Nguesso's son, [[Denis-Christel Sassou Nguesso]], was seeking a French bank loan of $100 million pledged to the production of oil.&lt;ref name=hd&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oyMgIlcKuFkC&amp;pg=PA340&amp;lpg=PA340&amp;dq=%22Bruno%20Oss%C3%A9bi%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3fwBLw6Gdl&amp;sig=Usn1SfsJO9VXJ4N_3TVyP0zUG7I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwitjsGVvpDPAhXJ5yYKHchBDSoQ6AEIPzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Bruno%20Oss%C3%A9bi%22&amp;f=false|title=Historical Dictionary of Republic of the Congo|last2=Decalo|first2=Samuel|date=9 August 2012|publisher=Scarecrow Press|first1=John F.|last1=Clark|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ossébi accused them of organizing a “debt front” which contradicted a commitment made by the Congo to the [[International Monetary Fund]]. Two days before the incident, Ossébi contacted the Committee to recover stolen property from the World Bank. A few weeks earlier, he had indicated his intention to join a complaint against “ill-gotten gains”.&lt;ref name=lemonde /&gt;

==Impact==
Following Ossébi’s death, Reporters Without Borders have accused officials of minimizing the case, and failing to carry out an official investigation or autopsy. Reporters Without Borders have since launched their own investigation into the case. More than 80 people have been interviewed including relatives, friends, other journalists, and government officials, but no further action has been taken. Reporters Without Borders continues to ask the French government for aid in solving the case.&lt;ref name=congovision&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.congovision.com/nouvelles2/ossebi1.html|title=Congo Vision : Nouvelles visions pour le Congo et l'Afrique|publisher=congovision}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
[[Koïchiro Matsuura]], director-general of [[UNESCO]], said, "I deplore the death of Bruno Ossébi. I trust that the authorities will spare no effort in seeking to elucidate this tragedy as soon as possible. It is important to remember that the work of journalists is essential not only if we are to uphold the basic human right of freedom of expression but for democracy and good governance, issues that concern societies everywhere.” &lt;ref name=unescoenglish&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=28324&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|title=Director-General deplores death of Congolese journalist Bruno Ossébi|publisher=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=unescofrench&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/ci/fr/ev.php-URL_ID=28324&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|title=Le Directeur général déplore la mort du journaliste congolais Bruno Ossébi|publisher=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jean-François Julliard, former secretary-general of Reporters Without Borders, said, "Deploring the negligence of the investigation conducted in Brazzaville by the Congolese authorities, we asked the French government, six months after the death of Bruno Ossébi, to open an investigation in France." He adds, "Today, it is still unclear whether the fire in the journalist's home was accidental or criminal. We still do not know why Bruno Ossébi died suddenly, twelve days later, with his state of health. We are astonished that France has remained passive on the mysterious death of one of its nationals, recognized, moreover, as a very critical voice in a country that does not shine by its respect for the Freedom of the press."&lt;ref name=fesmedia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fesmedia-africa.org/what-is-news/statements-developments/news/article/congo-il-faut-relancer-lenquete-sur-la-mort-du-journaliste-franco-congolais-bruno-ossebi/|title=Fesmedia Africa: Congo : "Il faut relancer l’enquête sur la mort du journaliste franco-congolais Bruno Ossébi"|first=fesmedia|last=Africa|publisher=fesmedia-africa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mice and rats==
For thousands of years, cats have been known for their ability to hunt mice and rats and keep their populations under control. This ability is understood as the reason cats became domesticated.&lt;ref name="Temple Grandin"&gt;Grandin, Temple and Johnson, Catherine (2009) ''Animals Make Us Human: Creating the Best Life for Animals'', Mariner Books, {{ISBN|9780151014897}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{rp|68}} The relationship was more of convenience (or mutualistic) than dependence: "Cats killed mice and rats, and humans provided lots of mice and rats to kill since mice and rats lived in human settlements."&lt;ref name="Temple Grandin"/&gt;{{rp|68}} A 2014 study examining 5,300 years of cat remains in an agricultural village of Quanhucun, [[China]], provides early evidence of this dynamic, where cats protected grain stores by eating rodents.&lt;ref name="Ancient cat bones"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/dec/17/ancient-cat-bone-research-china-domestic-pet | title=Ancient Chinese cat bones shake up domestication theory | newspaper=The Guardian | date=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hu 2014 on Cat domestication"&gt;
{{cite journal|doi= 10.1073/pnas.1311439110|title= Earliest evidence for commensal processes of cat domestication|journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume= 111|pages= 116–120|year= 2013|last1= Hu|first1= Y.|last2= Hu|first2= S.|last3= Wang|first3= W.|last4= Wu|first4= X.|last5= Marshall|first5= F.

If they are well-fed, [[farm cat]]s are more dependable as effective ratters, as they are less likely to stray or hunt further afield.&lt;ref name="Tabor Wild Life"&gt;Tabor, Roger (1983) ''The Wild Life of the Domestic Cat''.

==Birds==
A 2013 study by Scott R. Loss and others of the [[Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute]] and the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] suggested that free-ranging domestic cats (mostly unowned) are the top human-caused threat to wildlife in the United States, killing an estimated 1.3 to 4 billion birds and 6.3 to 22.3 billion mammals annually.&lt;ref name="Loss 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.alleycat.org/document.doc?id=634|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904132317/http://www.alleycat.org/document.doc?id=634|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2014-09-04|title=The impact of free-ranging domestic cats on wildlife of the United States|journal=Nature Communications|volume=4|pages=1396|doi=10.1038/ncomms2380|pmid=23360987|year=2013|last1=Loss|first1=Scott R.|last2=Will|first2=Tom|last3=Marra|first3=Peter P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='BBCNews'&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-21236690 | title = Cats killing billions of animals in the US | accessdate = 12 February 2013 | last = Morelle | first = Rebecca | date = 29 January 2013 | work = BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; These figures were much higher than previous estimates for the U.S.&lt;ref name="Loss 2013"/&gt;{{rp|2}} Unspecified species of birds native to the U.S. and mammals including [[mouse|mice]], [[shrew]]s, [[vole]]s, [[squirrel]]s and [[rabbit]]s were considered most likely to be preyed upon by cats.&lt;ref name="Loss 2013"/&gt;{{rp|4}}

Perhaps the first U.S. study that pointed to predation by cats on wildlife as a concern was ornithologist [[Edward Howe Forbush]]'s 1916 report for the Massachusetts State Board of Agriculture, ''The Domestic Cat: Bird Killer, Mouser and Destroyer of Wildlife: Means of Utilizing and Controlling It''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Howe Forbush, [https://archive.org/details/domesticcatbirdk00forbrich "The Domestic Cat: Bird Killer, Mouser and Destroyer of Wildlife: Means of Utilizing and Controlling It"], Commonwealth of Massachusetts, State Board of Agriculture, Economic Biology Bulletin 42, 1916.&lt;/ref&gt;

U.K. biologist and cat behaviour expert Roger Tabor states that "studies from all around the world have found that cats catch relatively few birds compared to small mammals."&lt;ref name="Tabor Cat Behavior"&gt;Tabor, Roger (2003) ''Understanding Cat Behavior''. David &amp; Charles Ltd. {{ISBN|9780715315897}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|135}} The [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]] states that there is no scientific evidence that cat predation "is having any impact on bird populations UK-wide."&lt;ref name="Are cats causing bird declines?"&gt;
[http://www.rspb.org.uk/advice/gardening/unwantedvisitors/cats/birddeclines.aspx "Are cats causing bird declines?"] The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, accessed 23 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, city cats have smaller ranges. In his research, Tabor found "the average annual catch of the average London cat to be two items instead of the fourteen of a village cat."&lt;ref name="Tabor Cat Behavior"/&gt;{{rp|135}} Tabor comments about some of the challenges of stalking birds for cats: "From the cat's point of view not only do birds not play fair by flying and having eyes that can see beyond the back of their heads, but they can positively cheat by using loud alarm calls and throw the cat's chances of catching any others."&lt;ref name="Tabor Wild Life"/&gt;{{rp|123}}

Island settings pose particular challenges for wildlife. A 2001 study identified cats alone as responsible for the plight of some island bird species, such as the [[Townsend's shearwater]], [[socorro dove]], and the [[Marquesan ground dove]].&lt;ref name="Endangered birds"&gt;

===Australia===
{{See also|Cats in Australia}}

Cats in Australia have been found to have European origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title = The Population Origins and Expansion of Feral Cats in Australia |last = Spencer |first = Peter B.S. |last2=Yurchenko |first2=Andrey A. |last3=David |first3=Victor A. |last4=Scott |first4=Rachael |last5=Koepfli |first5=Klaus-Peter |last6=Driscoll |first6=Carlos |last7=O’Brien |first7=Stephen J. |last8=Menotti-Raymond |first8=Marilyn |date = 9 November 2015 |journal=Journal of Heredity |publisher = American Genetic Association |doi = 10.1093/jhered/esv095 |volume=107 |issue=2 |pages=104–114 |pmc=4757960 |pmid=26647063}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is important to note because of their effect on native species. Feral cats in Australia have been linked to the decline and extinction of various native animals. They have been shown to cause a significant impact on ground nesting birds and small native mammals.&lt;ref name="Dickman"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Dickman|first1 = Chris|title = Overview of the Impacts of Feral Cats on Australian Native Fauna|publisher = The Director of National Parks and Wildlife&amp;nbsp;– Australian Nature Conservation Agency&amp;nbsp;– Institute of Wildlife Research|date = May 1996|url = http://secure.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/invasive/publications/pubs/impacts-feral-cats.pdf|accessdate = 11 February 2013|isbn = 0-642-21379-8|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304040904/http://secure.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/invasive/publications/pubs/impacts-feral-cats.pdf|archivedate = 4 March 2016|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feral cats have also hampered any attempts to re-introduce threatened species back into areas where they have become extinct as the cats have hunted and killed the newly released animals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/pestsweeds/TheThreatOfFeralCats.htm The Threat Of Feral Cats]. Environment.nsw.gov.au (28 October 2011). Retrieved on 5 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous Australian environmentalists claim the feral cat has been an ecological disaster in Australia, inhabiting most ecosystems except dense [[rainforest]], and being implicated in the [[extinction]] of several [[marsupial]] and [[Placentalia|placental]] mammal [[species]].&lt;ref name="Interactions"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Interactions between feral cats, foxes, native carnivores, and rabbits in Australia | journal = CSIRO Sustainable Ecosystems / Arthur Rylah Institute for Environmental Research | date = Sep 2004 | author = Robley, A. | author2 = Reddiex, B. | author3 = Arthur, T. | author4 = Pech, R. | author5 = Forsyth, D. | url = http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/invasive/publications/pubs/interaction.pdf | accessdate = 12 February 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317105943/http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/invasive/publications/pubs/interaction.pdf|archivedate=17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
{{See also|Cats in New Zealand}}

The fauna of [[New Zealand]] has evolved in isolation for millions of years without the presence of mammals (apart from a few bat species). Consequently, birds dominated the niches occupied by mammals and many became flightless. The introduction of mammals after settlement by [[Māori people|Māori]] from about the 12th century had a huge effect on the indigenous [[biodiversity]]. [[Europe]]an explorers and settlers brought cats on their ships and the presence of feral cats were recorded from the latter decades of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;King, Carolyn (1984) ''Immigrant Killers''. Auckland: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-558121-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is estimated that feral cats have been responsible for the extinction of six endemic bird species and over 70 localised subspecies as well as depleting bird and lizard species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference | author = Eason, Charles T. | author2 = Morgan, David R. | author3 = Clapperton, B.

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom|U.K.]], The [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]] states that there is no scientific evidence that cat predation "is having any impact on bird populations UK-wide. The article goes on to say, "This may be surprising, but many millions of birds die naturally every year, mainly through starvation, disease, or other forms of predation. There is evidence that cats tend to take weak or sickly birds".

"Those bird species that have undergone the most serious population declines in the UK (such as [[Alauda|skylarks]], [[Eurasian tree sparrow|tree sparrows]] and [[corn bunting]]s) rarely encounter cats, so cats cannot be causing their declines. Research shows that these declines are usually caused by habitat change or loss, particularly on farmland."&lt;ref name="Are cats causing bird declines?"/&gt; This evidence is despite the common practice in the U.K. of allowing owned cats access to the outdoors,&lt;ref&gt;"In the UK, the vast majority of pet cats have free access to the outside world, or are at least allowed to go outside unsupervised for large parts of the day." [http://www.pets4homes.co.uk/pet-advice/a-world-of-difference-how-cat-ownership-in-america-differs-to-the-uk.html "A world of difference – How cat ownership in America differs to the UK"], Pets4Homes, accessed 1 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; which is recommended to prevent feline obesity (p.&amp;nbsp;138) and behavior problems and other health problems arising from confinement stress (p.&amp;nbsp;121).&lt;ref name="Tabor Cat Behavior"/&gt;

[[SongBird Survival]] considers that "The prevailing line that "there is no scientific evidence that predation by cats is having any impact on bird populations in UK" is simply no longer tenable",&lt;ref&gt;https://www.songbird-survival.org.uk/cats.html&lt;/ref&gt; noting "No study has ever examined the impact of cats on songbirds at the population level; Evidence shows that the recovering sparrowhawk population in the 1970-80s resulted in the decline of some songbird populations; Cats kill around 3 times as many songbirds as sparrowhawks; The mere presence of cats near birds' nests was found to decrease provision of food by a third while the resultant mobbing clamour from parent birds led in turn to increased nest predation by crows and magpies; [and that] It is therefore far more likely that cats have an even greater impact on songbird populations than sparrowhawks."

[[Sir David Attenborough]] in his Christmas Day edition of [[BBC Radio 4]] programme Tweet Of The Day said ""Cats kill an extraordinarily high number of birds in British gardens".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=10 December 2013 |title=Cats killing huge numbers of British birds, Sir David Attenborough warns |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/dec/10/cats-killing-birds-gardens-david-attenborough |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asked whether cat owners should buy bell collars for their pets at Christmas, he replied: "That would be good for the robins, yes."

===Islands===

====Consequences of introduction====
[[File:Xenicus lyalli.jpg|right|thumb|[[Lyall's wren]] became extinct within two years of the introduction of cats to [[Stephens Island, New Zealand|Stephens Island]].]]

Many islands host [[island tameness|ecologically naive]] animal species. That is, animals that do not have predator responses for dealing with predators such as cats.&lt;ref name="Moors"&gt;Moors, P.J.; Atkinson, I.A.E. (1984). "Predation on seabirds by introduced animals, and factors affecting its severity" in ''Status and Conservation of the World's Seabirds''. Cambridge: ICBP. {{ISBN|0-946888-03-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Feral cats [[introduced species|introduced]] to such islands have had a devastating impact on these islands' [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

They have been implicated in the extinction of several species and local extinctions, such as the [[hutia]]s from the [[Caribbean]], the [[Guadalupe storm petrel]] from the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast of [[Mexico]], and [[Lyall's wren]]. In a statistical study, they were a significant cause for the extinction of 40% of the species studied.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/02/magazine/02cats-v--birds-t.html?em&amp;ex=1196830800&amp;en=4328122ab745ee4d&amp;ei=5087%0A | work=The New York Times | title=Kill the Cat That Kills the Bird? | first=Bruce | last=Barcott | date=2 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moors and Atkinson wrote, in 1984, "No other alien predator has had such a universally damaging effect."&lt;ref name="Moors"/&gt;

Feral cats, along with rabbits, some sea birds, and [[sheep]], form the entire large animal population of the remote [[Kerguelen Islands]] in the southern [[Indian Ocean]]. Although exotic mammals form the bulk of their diet, cats' impact on seabirds is very important.&lt;ref name="Kerguelen"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00300-002-0424-5 | title=The diet of feral cats (''Felis catus'' L.) at five sites on the Grande Terre, Kerguelen archipelago | author=Pontier, D. | author2=E.

====Restoration====
Because of the damage cats cause in islands and some ecosystems, many conservationists working in the field of [[island restoration]] have worked to remove feral cats. (Island restoration involves the removal of introduced species and reintroducing native species.) {{as of|2004}}, 48 islands have had their feral cat populations eradicated, including [[New Zealand]]'s network of offshore island bird reserves&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.issg.org/pdf/publications/Island_Invasives/pdfHQprint/1Campbell.pdf|title=A review of feral cat eradication on islands|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2004.00442.x|year=2004|last1=Nogales|first1=Manuel|last2=Martin|first2=Aurelio|last3=Tershy|first3=Bernie R.|last4=Donlan|first4=C.

Larger projects have also been undertaken, including their complete removal from [[Ascension Island]]. The cats, introduced in the 19th century, caused a collapse in populations of nesting [[seabird]]s. The project to remove them from the island began in 2002, and the island was cleared of cats by 2004. Since then, seven species of seabird that had not nested on the island for 100 years have returned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://petsaspests.blogspot.com/search?q=ascension Cat eradication from Ascension Island]. Petsaspests.blogspot.com (2014-01-23). Retrieved on 2015-11-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, the removal of cats had [[unintended consequences]]. An example is Macquarie Island, where the removal of cats caused an explosion in the number of rabbits, rats, and mice that harm native seabirds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/environment/up-against-rats-rabbits-and-costs/2007/04/11/1175971183257.html?page=fullpage | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Up against rats, rabbits and costs | date=12 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060720104709/http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200607/s1687413.htm Fears for sub-antarctic island plagued by rabbits].

[[Image:HK Ho Chung Che Kung Temple front.JPG|right|thumb|A Che Kung Temple in [[Ho Chung]], [[Sai Kung]], [[Hong Kong]].]]
Che Kung was a native of [[Nanchang]], in [[Jiangxi]] Province of [[China]].&lt;ref name="Grade II" /&gt; As a military commander he saved the southern regions of China from disorder. Also, he appeared in the villagers dreams who suffered from a plague. Later on, the plague was over and the villagers thought that Che Kung saved them from diseases. [[Daoism|Daoists]] regarded him as a god due to his contributions. Inside a temple of Che Kung, [[Pinwheel (toy)|pinwheels]] can always be found next to his effigy. It is believed that the one who rotates the pinwheel can get good luck. [[The Birthday of Che Kung]] is celebrated on the second day of Chinese New Year.

A '''DNA clamp''', also known as a '''sliding clamp''', is a [[protein]] [[tertiary structure|fold]] that serves as a [[processivity]]-promoting factor in [[DNA replication]]. As a critical component of the [[DNA polymerase III holoenzyme]], the clamp protein binds [[DNA polymerase]] and prevents this [[enzyme]] from dissociating from the template [[DNA]] strand.  The clamp-polymerase [[protein–protein interaction]]s are stronger and more specific than the direct interactions between the polymerase and the template DNA strand; because one of the [[rate-limiting step]]s in the DNA synthesis reaction is the association of the polymerase with the DNA template, the presence of the sliding clamp dramatically increases the number of [[nucleotide]]s that the polymerase can add to the growing strand per association event. The presence of the DNA clamp can increase the rate of DNA synthesis up to 1,000-fold compared with a nonprocessive polymerase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/bi00336a031 |title=Rate-limiting steps in the DNA polymerase I reaction pathway |author=V.

==Structure==
The DNA clamp fold is an [[alpha+beta protein fold|α+β]] protein that assembles into a multimeric structure that completely encircles the DNA double helix as the polymerase adds [[nucleotide]]s to the growing strand.&lt;ref name="pmid11178284"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bruck I, O'Donnell M | title = The ring-type polymerase sliding clamp family | journal = Genome Biol. | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = REVIEWS3001 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11178284 | pmc = 150441 | doi = 10.1186/gb-2001-2-1-reviews3001 | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The DNA clamp assembles on the DNA at the [[replication fork]] and "slides" along the DNA with the advancing polymerase, aided by a layer of [[water]] molecules in the central pore of the clamp between the DNA and the protein surface. Because of the [[torus|toroidal]] shape of the assembled multimer, the clamp cannot dissociate from the template strand without also dissociating into [[monomer]]s.

The DNA clamp fold is found in [[bacteria]],  [[archaea]], [[eukaryote]]s and some [[viruses]]. In bacteria, the sliding clamp is a [[protein dimer|homodimer]] composed of two identical beta subunits of  [[DNA polymerase III holoenzyme|DNA polymerase III]] and hence is referred to as the beta clamp. In archaea&lt;ref name="pmid11266590"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Matsumiya S, Ishino Y, Morikawa K | title = Crystal structure of an archaeal DNA sliding clamp: Proliferating cell nuclear antigen from Pyrococcus furiosus | journal = Protein Sci. | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 17–23 |date=January 2001 | pmid = 11266590 | pmc = 2249843 | doi = 10.1110/ps.36401 | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and eukaryotes, it is a trimer composed of three molecules of [[Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen|PCNA]].  The [[Enterobacteria phage T4|T4 bacteriophage]] also uses a sliding clamp, called gp45 that is a trimer similar in structure to PCNA but lacks sequence homology to either PCNA or the bacterial beta clamp.&lt;ref name="pmid11178284"/&gt;

The '''beta clamp''' is a specific DNA clamp and a subunit of the [[DNA polymerase III]] holoenzyme found in bacteria. Two beta subunits are assembled around the DNA by the gamma subunit and ATP hydrolysis; this assembly is called the [[pre-replication complex|pre-initiation complex]]. After assembly around the DNA, the beta subunits' affinity for the gamma subunit is replaced by an affinity for the alpha and epsilon subunits, which together create the complete holoenzyme.&lt;ref name="isbn0-19-857779-6"&gt;{{cite book | last = Lewin| first = Benjamin | name-list-format = vanc | title = Genes VI | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford [Oxfordshire] | year = 1997 | pages = 484–7 | isbn = 978-0-19-857779-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-87901-047-9"&gt;{{cite book | last = Lehninger | first = Albert L | name-list-format = vanc | title = Biochemistry: The Molecular Basis of Cell Structure and Function | edition = | language = | publisher = Worth Publishers | location = New York | year = 1975 | origyear = | pages = 894 | quote = | isbn = 978-0-87901-047-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stukenberg_1991"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stukenberg PT, Studwell-Vaughan PS, O'Donnell M | title = Mechanism of the sliding beta-clamp of DNA polymerase III holoenzyme | journal = J.

Once bound to DNA, the beta subunits can freely slide along double stranded DNA. The beta subunits in turn bind the αε polymerase complex.  The α subunit possesses [[DNA polymerase]] activity and the ε subunit is a 3’-5’ [[exonuclease]].&lt;ref name="Stukenberg_1991"/&gt;

The beta chain of bacterial DNA polymerase III is composed of three topologically equivalent [[protein domain|domains]] ([[N-terminus|N-terminal]], central, and [[C-terminus|C-terminal]]).  Two beta chain molecules are tightly associated to form  a closed ring encircling duplex DNA.

The sliding clamp in eukaryotes is assembled from a specific subunit of [[DNA polymerase delta]] called the proliferating cell nuclear antigen ([[PCNA]]). The [[N-terminus|N-terminal]] and [[C-terminus|C-terminal]] domains of PCNA are topologically identical. Three PCNA molecules are tightly associated to form  a closed ring encircling duplex DNA.

The sequence of PCNA is well conserved between plants, animals and fungi, indicating a strong selective pressure for structure conservation, and suggesting that this type of DNA replication mechanism is conserved throughout eukaryotes.&lt;ref name="pmid1671766"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Suzuka I, Hata S, Matsuoka M, Kosugi S, Hashimoto J | title = Highly conserved structure of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (DNA polymerase delta auxiliary protein) gene in plants | journal = European Journal of Biochemistry | volume = 195 | issue = 2 | pages = 571–5 | date = January 1991 | pmid = 1671766 | doi = 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1991.tb15739.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marshall AC, Kroker AJ, Murray LA, Gronthos K, Rajapaksha H, Wegener KL, Bruning JB | title = Structure of the sliding clamp from the fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus (AfumPCNA) and interactions with Human p21 | journal = The FEBS Journal | volume = 284 | issue = 6 | pages = 985–1002 | date = March 2017 | pmid = 28165677 | doi = 10.1111/febs.14035 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Homologues of PCNA have also been identified in the [[archaea]] (''[[Euryarchaeota]]'' and ''[[Crenarchaeota]]'') and in Paramecium bursaria Chlorella virus 1 (PBCV-1) and in [[Nuclear Polyhedrosis Virus|nuclear polyhedrosis viruses]].

==Assembly==
Sliding clamps are loaded onto their associated DNA template strands by specialized proteins known as "[[Replication factor C|sliding clamp loaders]]", which also disassemble the clamps after replication has completed. The binding sites for these initiator proteins overlap with the binding sites for the DNA polymerase, so the clamp cannot simultaneously associate with a clamp loader and with a polymerase. Thus the clamp will not be actively disassembled while the polymerase remains bound. DNA clamps also associate with other factors involved in DNA and genome homeostasis, such as [[nucleosome]] assembly factors, [[Okazaki fragment]] ligases, and [[DNA repair]] proteins. All of these proteins also share a binding site on the DNA clamp that overlaps with the clamp loader site, ensuring that the clamp will not be removed while any enzyme is still working on the DNA. The activity of the clamp loader requires [[ATP hydrolysis]] to "close" the clamp around the DNA.

"'''Dead Run'''" is the second segment of the nineteenth episode from the first season (1985–86) of the [[television series]] ''[[The Twilight Zone (1985 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]''.

==Plot==
Johnny Davis is a truck driver and is unemployed due to his many accidents. Johnny asks Pete, a friend of his father, for help getting a job. Pete is reluctant and warns Johnny that the jobs he takes require unusual resilience and fortitude. Johnny insists that he understands and Pete agrees to take him on his next run. Johnny quickly discovers that the run involves delivering [[soul]]s to [[Hell]] via [[semi-trailer truck]]. He also finds out that the souls of the newly dead have been causing disturbances in Hell and it is making the truckers nervous.

Dropping their cargo in Hell, Pete and Johnny witness anarchy. Souls run around loose and some of the dead plead with Johnny to rescue them. Other souls attack the drivers, but Gary Frick (another dead man) comes to Johnny's aid. Gary tells Johnny that the cause of the commotion is that people are being sent to Hell who don't deserve it.

Gary explains that a new bureaucracy has taken over the job of deciding who goes to Heaven or Hell. Pete and one of the guards in Hell find Johnny, who is summoned to a meeting with upper management. Johnny relates what he heard and saw, and the manager explains how the process works. Johnny thinks the standards used to determine who is sent to Hell are excessive and biased and people are being damned for minor offenses. The executive reasons that they're simply using "time-honored Biblical standards".

Johnny decides to interview the dead that ride with him and then he can decide which of the dead should go to Hell and which he should release (in hopes that they can find a way to [[Heaven]]). When one of the souls asks why he is doing this, Johnny replies that he remembered a story from the Bible: between the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]] and [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]], [[Harrowing of Hell|Jesus went down to Hell]] to give the souls there another chance. Johnny reasons that he is just using his own "time-honored Biblical standard."

==Closing narration==
{{cquote|Centuries ago, Hell was reached by chalk-white horses pulling shuttered coaches; by Spanish galleons borne on black sails through uncharted seas.  Legend has it Leonardo da Vinci was once commissioned to build a flying machine to carry souls to Hell, but it never returned from its maiden flight.  But along this particular road to Hell lies redemption for the damned as well as for drivers who have found work... in The Twilight Zone.}}

'''Developmental homeostasis''' is a process in which animals develop more or less normally, despite defective [[genes]] and deficient environments.&lt;ref name=Alcock /&gt; It is an organisms ability to overcome certain circumstances in order to develop normally. This can be either a physical or mental circumstance that interferes with either a physical or mental trait. Many species have a specific norm, where those who fit that norm prosper while those who don't are killed or find it difficult to thrive. It is important that the animal be able to interact with the other group members effectively. Animals must learn their species' norms early to live a normal, successful life for that species.

Developmental homeostasis determines how a species adapts to live a normal life. Therefore, it has been the focus of many experiments. These experiments are geared and designed to test the threshold for certain species to overcome and prosper despite certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sumpter|first=D.J.T.|title=The principles of collective animal behaviour|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume=361|issue=1465|pages=5–22|url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/361/1465/5.short|accessdate=2 May 2012|doi=10.1098/rstb.2005.1733|pmid=16553306|pmc=1626537|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Galef|first=B.G.|title=Mammalian Social Learning: Non-Primates|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780080453378000619|journal=Encyclopedia of Animal Behavior|pages=370–374|accessdate=2 May 2012|doi=10.1016/B978-0-08-045337-8.00061-9|date=January 2010|isbn=9780080453378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the fact that survival of the species is based on the ability to interact with their own in a normal manner, these experiments—which usually interfere with that—walk a fine line for animal rights and what is acceptable. The rhesus monkey experiments show how the young monkey needs the physical contact with other monkeys to learn the social behaviors and interact with each other effectively. This is one of the ways mental developmental homeostasis has been researched. One way physical developmental homeostasis was tested was in the facial symmetry experiment where people were asked to rate which of the faces they saw as better looking. This experiment resulted in the pictures with more symmetrical faces being called better looking. This is not just found in humans but other experiments such as the brush-legged wolf spider and the barn swallow birds. Favored traits give the bearer an advantage in attracting high quality mates.

In species that value developmental homeostasis, both physically and mentally, the ability of one to adapt to social norms seems to increase the likelihood of having a reproductive advantage being able to attract mates and leave offspring.&lt;ref name=Alcock /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grether|first=G.F.|title=Sexual Selection and Speciation|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780080453378001832|journal=Encyclopedia of Animal Behavior|pages=177–183|accessdate=2 May 2012|doi=10.1016/B978-0-08-045337-8.00183-2|date=January 2010|isbn=9780080453378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developmental homeostasis: isolation of monkeys==
Developmental homeostasis attributes to the way many animals develop. This contains the way they develop normally or abnormally despite faulty genes and an insufficient environment. This property of development reduces the variation around a mean value for a phenotype, and reflects the ability of developmental processes to suppress some outcomes in order to generate an adaptive phenotype more reliably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alcock|first=John|title=Animal Behavior: Ninth Edition|year=2009|publisher=Sinauer Associates,Inc.|location=Sunderland,Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-87893-225-2|pages=89–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects of social isolation in rhesus monkeys===
The effects of developmental homeostasis were demonstrated in an experiment conducted four decades ago by Margaret and Harry Harlow. They wanted to test what the consequences of infant [[rhesus monkey]]s would be from being separated from their mothers and having little interaction with other monkeys. First, they were separated from their mothers for six to twelve hours after birth and placed with a human made mechanical substitute in which they called the "surrogate mother."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rice|first=Keith|title=Attachment in Infant Monkeys|url=http://www.integratedsociopsychology.net/infant_monkeys-attachment.html|publisher=Psychology|accessdate=May 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These surrogates were made of a wire cylinder structure and a terry cloth structure and were placed with the babies is a cage. The terry cloth structure was also placed with a nursing bottle. The monkeys preferred and clung to the cloth surrogate mother. In a short period of time the monkeys took on side effects of weight loss and not abnormal physical development. Once the monkeys reached an age where they could eat solid foods, they were separated from their cloth mothers for three days. When they were reunited with their mothers, they clung to them and did not wander off. Young rhesus monkeys in their natural habitat normally explore and venture off. Harlow concluded from this that the need for contact comfort was stronger than the need to explore. Being isolated from social interaction also caused negative outcomes later in their life. The surrogate-raised monkeys exhibited depression and aggressive behavior as they would clutch to themselves, rock constantly back and forth, and avoid interaction with others. Not only affecting their social behavior, it also impacted them interacting sexually. The monkeys underwent little if any sexual posturing or reproduction in their lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Napier|first=M|title=The Experiment|url=http://users.rcn.com/napier.interport/cwm/experim.html|work=Chicken Wire Mother|publisher=CXX|accessdate=2012-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Baby rhesus monkey clinging to cloth surrogate mother.jpg|thumb|right|Baby rhesus monkey clinging to cloth surrogate mother after being isolated from birth mother]] --&gt;

To test how much social experience is necessary or needed in normal development the Harlows performed another experiment in that they isolated young rhesus monkeys by limiting the interaction time with other monkeys. They gave them fifteen minutes a day with three other monkeys to interact. In the beginning, the monkeys would attach to each other and begin to play. Normal behavior of these monkeys in their natural habitat is that after the age of one month they play with other monkeys of their own species and by six months are constantly interacting in groups. Results showed that over time the monkeys developed relatively normal behavior and that limiting their social interaction as babies did not affect them interacting sexually and socially. They also did not exhibit any abnormal aggression or depression when socializing with other monkeys.&lt;ref name=Alcock /&gt;

In 1960, [[Harry Harlow]] began studying partial and total isolation of infant monkeys by raising them in cages. Partial isolation involved raising monkeys in bare wire cages that allowed them to see, smell, and hear other monkeys, but did not give them the opportunity for physical contact. Total social isolation involved rearing monkeys in isolation chambers that took away any and all contact with other monkeys. The results showed that when the monkeys were placed in partial isolation they displayed various abnormal behaviors such as blank staring, circling in their cages numerous times, and self-mutilation. The cages were placed in several locations. A few of the monkeys remained being tested in solitary confinement for fifteen years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Berger|first=Vincent|title=Harry Harlow|url=http://www.psychologistanywhereanytime.com/|publisher=Psychologist Anytime Anywhere|accessdate=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the total isolation experiments the baby monkeys were left alone for three, six, twelve, or twenty-four months. The experiments resulted in the monkeys that were severely psychologically disturbed and abnormal development. When first removed from isolation, they usually went into emotional shock by clutching to themselves and rocking multiple times. One of six monkeys isolated for three months refused to eat after release and died five days later. The longer the time in isolation the more detrimental it was for the monkeys to act socially when placed with other monkeys. Harlow pointed out that no monkey had actually died during isolation. Harlow tried to reintegrate the monkeys who had been isolated for six months by placing them with monkeys who had been reared normally. He stated that it produced “severe deficits in virtually every aspect of social behavior” and that it “achieved only limited recovery of simple social responses.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Amhurst|title=The Development of Social Attachment in Rhesus Monkeys|journal=Proposal #20|year=2008|volume=1|series=1|issue=1|pages=2–7|url=http://bcrc.bio.umass.edu/courses/fall2008/biol/biol550section2/20.pdf|accessdate=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics===
The ethics of pulling a baby primate away from their mother at young ages isn't morally right. Removing baby primates from their mothers can cause high psychological trauma in these young primates that can inhibit proper growth and social skills. In addition to lasting effects, these animals may live in small, cramped, dirty environments, which can cause health issues within baby primates. Health problems can also arise sooner and with more impact on a young primate that has just been removed from the comfort of their mother because their immune system is not fully active as it would be with an older primate. The psychological effects of the physiological suffering of these young primates last a lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Judy Cameron’s maternal- deprivation and psychological- development experiments.

Overall, questions arise about animal experimentation being morally right or wrong. Labs that abuse the ability to conduct animal experimentation are often shut down or lose federal funding, University of Pennsylvania's lab is a good example of this. Some statistics about animal experimentation: 20 million animals are experimented on and are killed annually, an estimated 8 million are experimented on painfully, and reports have shown that ten percent of those tested on do not receive pain killers to minimize the pain these animals are put through. Animal experimentation has become something that is debated about publicly. Those who do not believe in animal experimentation raise the questions about if it is wrong to cause pain to humans then isn't it wrong to cause pain to animals? &lt;ref&gt;Andre, C., &amp; Velasquez, M.

 Ethics website: http://www.scu.edu/ethics/publications/iie/v1n3/cures.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Some advocates of animal experimentation that say that these experiments allow scientific discovery to advance—but some feel that those who support animal experimentation are selfish to inflict pain on other animals as a method to reduce or eliminate pain for humans. The question is not so much a comparison between the pain of humans versus the pain of animals as much as it is the amount of suffering for the animal subjects.&lt;ref&gt;DEWEY, J. (2012).

==Developmental homeostasis in symmetry and asymmetry==
Developmental homeostasis plays a role in the development of symmetrical and asymmetrical bodies. This effect in species shows that individuals in species who have symmetrical features are more likely to obtain a mate over one who has asymmetrical features.

===Symmetry in facial features===
The [[Symmetry in biology|symmetry]] in the facial features of humans could be found as appealing to men and women. This could be due to the ability to find prospective mates in responding positively to either body or facial symmetry. This could be because attributes announce the individual's capacity to overcome challenges to normal development.&lt;ref name=Alcock&gt;{{cite book|last=Alcock|first=John|title=Animal Behavior: An Evolutionary Approach, Ninth Edition|year=2009|publisher=Sinauer Associates Inc.|location=Sunderland, Massachusetts U.S.A.|isbn=978-0-87893-225-2|pages=89–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; The human preference for symmetry can be explained by humans looking at mate choice, mainly because symmetry is a reliable indicator in the genetic quality mates look for. The cognitive mechanisms and adaptive significance of facial attractiveness have been an interest of psychologists. Men and women find traits such as averageness, symmetry, and masculinity (in male) or femininity (in female) in faces attractive.&lt;ref name="behavioral ecology"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Leigh W. Simmons, Gillian Rhodes, Marianne Peters and Nicole Koehler|title=Are human preferences for facial symmetry focused on signals of developmental instability?|journal=Behavioral Ecology|date=11 June 2004|volume=15|issue=5|pages=1–8|doi=10.1093/beheco/arh099|url=http://beheco.oxfordjournals.org/content/15/5/864.full|accessdate=29 April 2012|last1=Simmons}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is noted that humans find symmetrical faces more attractive than asymmetrical faces. Disruptions to development caused by mutations or by an inability to secure critical material resources early in life could generate asymmetries in appearance. If body asymmetry reflects sub-optimal development of the brain or other important organs, a preference for symmetrical traits could enable the selective individual to acquire a partner with "good genes" to transfer to their offspring.&lt;ref name="Alcock"/&gt; Disruptions to development could be caused by stress, illness, or genetic factors.

===Symmetry vs. asymmetry===
[[File:Attracive-faces-symmetry.jpg|thumb|Symmetry of female and male faces. Those with high symmetry appear more attractive than low.]]
In 1998 a study of facial symmetry and how beauty was experimented on by Gillian Rhodes called "Facial symmetry and the perception of beauty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rhodes|first=Gillian|author2=Fiona Proffitt |author3=Jonathon M. Grady |author4=Alex Sumich |title=Facial symmetry and the perception of beauty|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|year=1998|volume=5|issue=4|pages=659–669|url=http://www.psy.uwa.edu.au/facelab/PublicFaces_files/Rhodes1998.pdf|accessdate=29 April 2012|doi=10.3758/bf03208842}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the experiment, images of human faces were digitally manipulated to show various amounts of symmetry. People were asked to rate the faces, and found that the faces with the most symmetry were the most attractive.

===Reproductive advantages===
Developmental homeostasis is present not only in humans, but in animals as well. The choosing of symmetrical features over asymmetrical features have been observed in birds, lizards, Araneae,and even insects. For example, [[barn swallow]] females have been reported to prefer males whose long outer feathers are the same length on each side. Symmetrical males gain an reproductive advantage because of the female mate choice.&lt;ref name="Alcock"/&gt;

Another example is the behavior exhibited in the damselfly ''[[Lestes viridis]]'', where males with more symmetrical hindwings were mated with more than their unmated rivals with asymmetrical hindwings.&lt;ref name="Alcock"/&gt; These examples show that individuals with high quality features are able to reproduce their large and symmetrical traits, while individuals who have lower quality features suffer costs to produce their asymmetrical traits.&lt;ref name="Barn Sparrow"&gt;{{cite journal|first=JOSEPH L. |last=TOMKINS |first2=LEIGH |last2=W. SIMMONS|title=Female choice and manipulations of forceps size and symmetry in the earwig Forficula auricularia L.|journal=[[Animal Behaviour (journal)|Animal Behaviour]]|year=1998|pages=1–2|url=http://www.ceb.uwa.edu.au/__data/page/115442/Tomkins_and_Simmons_98.pdf|accessdate=29 April 2012|doi=10.1006/anbe.1998.0838|pmid=9787025 |volume=56|issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One species that chooses their mates based on body symmetry is the brush-legged wolf spider. Males who have larger tufts on one leg than the other (asymmetrical) tend to be smaller, and have poorer fitness than the males who have symmetrical tufts. During courtship, the males wave their hair foreleg tufts, and symmetrical males be chosen over asymmetrical males by the females.&lt;ref name="Alcock"/&gt;

'''Edward Earl Hazel''' (April 10, 1950 – December 23, 1992) was an American guitarist and singer in early [[funk]] music in the [[United States]] who played lead guitar with [[Parliament-Funkadelic]]. Hazel was a posthumous inductee of the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], inducted in 1997 with fifteen other members of [[Parliament-Funkadelic]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
Born in [[Brooklyn, New York]] in 1950, Hazel grew up in [[Plainfield, New Jersey]] because his mother, Grace Cook, wanted her son to grow up in an environment without the pressures of [[drugs]] and [[crime]] that she felt pervaded [[New York City]].  Hazel occupied himself from a young age by playing a [[guitar]], given to him as a [[Christmas]] present by his older brother. Hazel also [[singing|sang]] in church.  At age 12, Hazel met [[Billy "Bass" Nelson]], and the pair quickly became close friends and began performing, soon adding drummer Harvey McGee to the mix.

===Career===
In 1967, [[the Parliaments]], a Plainfield-based [[doo wop]] band headed by [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]], had a hit record with "[[(I Wanna) Testify]]."  Clinton recruited a backing band for a tour, hiring Nelson as bassist, who in turn recommended Hazel as guitarist. Hazel was in [[Newark, New Jersey]], working with George Blackwell and could not be reached. After Nelson returned from the tour, he tried to recruit Hazel. His mother at first vetoed the idea, since Hazel was only seventeen, but Clinton and Nelson worked together to change her mind.

In late 1967, the Parliaments went on tour with both Nelson and Hazel. In [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] Hazel met and befriended [[Tiki Fulwood]], who quickly replaced the Parliaments' drummer. Nelson, Hazel and Fulwood became the backbone of [[Funkadelic]], which was originally the backup band for the Parliaments, only to later become an independent touring group when legal difficulties forced Clinton to temporarily abandon the name "Parliaments".

The switch to Funkadelic was complete with the addition of [[Tawl Ross]] and [[Bernie Worrell]] ([[rhythm guitar]] and [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]], respectively). ''[[Funkadelic (album)|Funkadelic]]'' (1970), ''[[Free Your Mind... And Your Ass Will Follow]]'' (1970) and ''[[Maggot Brain]]'' (1971) were the first three albums, released within two years. All three albums prominently featured Hazel's guitar work.

The third album's title song, "[[Maggot Brain (song)|Maggot Brain]]", consists of a ten-minute [[guitar solo]] by Hazel. Clinton reportedly told Hazel during the recording session to imagine he had been told his mother was dead, but then learned that it was not true.&lt;ref name=Tate/&gt; Music critic [[Greg Tate]] described it as Funkadelic's ''[[A Love Supreme]]''.&lt;ref name=Tate&gt;{{cite news |last=Tate |first=Greg |authorlink=Greg Tate |title=Eddie Hazel, 1950–1992 |work=[[The Village Voice]] |date=January 12, 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Rolling Stone cited this as number 60 on its list of 100 greatest "guitar songs" of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time |work=Rolling Stone  |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/20947527/page/26 |accessdate=2008-06-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nelson and Hazel officially quit [[Funkadelic]] in late 1971 over financial disputes with Clinton, though Hazel contributed to the group sporadically over the next several years. The albums ''[[America Eats Its Young]]'' (1972) and ''[[Cosmic Slop]]'' (1973) featured only marginal input from Hazel. Instead, Hazel began working with [[the Temptations]] (along with Nelson), appearing on ''[[1990 (The Temptations album)|1990]]'' (1973) and ''[[A Song for You (Temptations album)|A Song for You]]'' (1975).

For the 1974 [[Funkadelic]] album ''[[Standing on the Verge of Getting It On]]'', Hazel co-wrote all of the album's songs. On six of those songs the songwriting credit was in the name of Grace Cook, Hazel's mother.&lt;ref name=Tate/&gt; Hazel also had a significant presence as arranger and lead guitarist on the same year's Parliament album, ''[[Up For The Down Stroke]]''.  In 1974, Hazel was indicted for assaulting an airline stewardess and an air marshal,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zBwFHNeUF3UC&amp;pg=PA236&amp;dq=%22Eddie+Hazel%22+dead+OR+death+OR+died&amp;lr=&amp;cd=4#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Eddie%20Hazel%22%20dead%20OR%20death%20OR%20died&amp;f=false Funk: the music, the people, and the rhythm of the one] By Rickey Vincent p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt; along with a drug possession charge. While Hazel was in jail, Clinton recruited [[Michael Hampton]] as the new lead guitarist for [[Parliament-Funkadelic]].&lt;ref name=Tate/&gt;

In the next several years, Hazel appeared occasionally on [[Parliament-Funkadelic]] albums, although his guitar work was rarely featured. One song that featured Hazel's lead guitar is "Comin' Round the Mountain" on ''[[Hardcore Jollies]]'' (1976). In 1977, Hazel recorded a "solo" album, ''[[Game, Dames and Guitar Thangs]]'', with support from other members of Parliament-Funkadelic, including vocals from [[the Brides of Funkenstein]].&lt;ref name=Tate/&gt; He was completely absent from ''[[One Nation Under a Groove]]'' (1978), Funkadelic's most commercially successful album. Hazel made another prominent appearance in "Man's Best Friend" on the George Clinton album ''[[Computer Games (album)|Computer Games]]'' (1982),&lt;ref name=Tate/&gt; as well as the track "Pumping It Up" from the [[P-Funk All Stars]] album ''[[Urban Dancefloor Guerillas]]''.

===Death===
On December 23, 1992, Hazel died from internal bleeding and liver failure.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bMBf3TYZigQC&amp;pg=PA295&amp;dq=%22Eddie+Hazel%22+dead+OR+death+OR+died&amp;lr=&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Eddie%20Hazel%22%20dead%20OR%20death%20OR%20died&amp;f=false The Encyclopedia of Dead Rock Stars: Heroin, Handguns, and Ham Sandwiches] By Jeremy Simmonds&lt;/ref&gt; "Maggot Brain" was played at his funeral.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RIEjkWXZdrMC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;dq=%22Eddie+Hazel%22+dead+OR+death+OR+died&amp;lr=&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Eddie%20Hazel%22%20dead%20OR%20death%20OR%20died&amp;f=false Funk] By Dave Thompson p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===
Three collections of unreleased recordings have been released posthumously: The 1994 four-song [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[Jams From the Heart]]'' (which [[Rhino Records]] later added as bonus material to its rerelease of ''Game, Dames and Guitar Thangs''), 1994's ''[[Rest in P]]'' and 2006's ''[[Eddie Hazel At Home]]''.

Other recordings by Hazel have appeared on albums by other musicians. Several albums produced by [[Bill Laswell]], including ''[[Funkcronomicon]]'' (released under the name [[Axiom Funk]], 1995) have featured Hazel's guitar. [[Bootsy Collins]] has also incorporated recordings of Hazel in some of his recent releases, for example, "Good Night Eddie" on ''[[Blasters of the Universe]]''. The band [[Ween]] recorded a tribute to him called "A Tear for Eddie" on their album ''[[Chocolate And Cheese]]''.  There is an image of Hazel on the back of [[Primal Scream]]'s album ''[[Give Out But Don't Give Up]]''. [[John Frusciante]] recorded a tribute to Hazel's "Maggot Brain" on his 2009 album ''[[The Empyrean]]'' in the nine-minute-long "Before the Beginning".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://invisible-movement.net/press/20090125-thewattfrompedro/5 |title=Watt from Pedro Show |date=January 25, 2009 |publisher=Invisible Movement–John Frusciante Unofficial Site |page=5 |accessdate=April 23, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hazel has been featured on a number of lists of greatest guitarists of all time. He was 43 on the list of Rolling Stone magazine's 100 Greatest Guitarists Of All Time &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-guitarists-20111123/eddie-hazel-20111202 100 Greatest Guitarists] Rolling Stone&lt;/ref&gt; and was ranked at 88 in a similar list by [[Uncut Magazine]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

[[File:Genes hox.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.8|[[Homology (biology)|Homologous]] [[hox gene|''hox'' genes]] in such different animals as [[insect]]s and [[vertebrate]]s control [[embryogenesis|embryonic development]] and hence the [[Morphology (biology)|form]] of adult bodies. These genes have been [[conserved sequence|highly conserved]] through hundreds of millions of years of [[evolution]].]]

'''Evolutionary developmental biology''' (informally, '''evo-devo''') is a field of [[biological research]] that compares the [[developmental biology|developmental processes]] of different [[organism]]s to [[inference|infer]] the [[phylogeny|ancestral relationships]] between them and how developmental processes [[evolution|evolved]].

The field grew from 19th-century beginnings, where [[embryology]] faced a mystery: [[zoology|zoologists]] did not know how [[embryogenesis|embryonic development]] was controlled at the [[molecular genetics|molecular level]]. [[Charles Darwin]] noted that having similar embryos implied common ancestry, but little progress was made until the 1970s. Then, [[recombinant DNA]] technology at last brought embryology together with [[molecular genetics]]. A key early discovery was of [[homeotic gene]]s that regulate development in a wide range of [[eukaryote]]s.

The field is characterised by some key concepts, which took [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologists]] by surprise. One is [[deep homology]], the finding that dissimilar organs such as the eyes of [[insect]]s, [[vertebrate]]s and [[cephalopod]] molluscs, long thought to have evolved separately, are controlled by similar genes such as ''[[pax-6]]'', from the [[evo-devo gene toolkit]]. These genes are ancient, being [[conserved sequence|highly conserved]] among [[Phylum|phyla]]; they generate the patterns in time and space which shape the embryo, and ultimately form the [[body plan]] of the organism. Another is that species do not differ much in their structural genes, such as those coding for [[enzyme]]s; what does differ is the way that [[regulation of gene expression|gene expression is regulated]] by the toolkit genes. These genes are reused, unchanged, many times in different parts of the embryo and at different stages of development, forming a complex cascade of control, switching other regulatory genes as well as structural genes on and off in a precise pattern. This multiple [[pleiotropy|pleiotropic]] reuse explains why these genes are highly conserved, as any change would have many adverse consequences which [[natural selection]] would oppose.

New [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] features and ultimately new species are produced by variations in the toolkit, either when genes are expressed in a new pattern, or when toolkit genes acquire additional functions. Another possibility is the [[Neo-Lamarckism|Neo-Lamarckian]] theory that [[epigenetics|epigenetic changes]] are later [[genetic assimilation|consolidated at gene level]], something that may have been important early in the history of multicellular life.

{{further|History of evolutionary thought}}

===Recapitulation===
{{main|Recapitulation theory}}

A [[recapitulation theory]] of evolutionary development was proposed by [[Étienne Serres]] in 1824–26, echoing the 1808 ideas of [[Johann Friedrich Meckel]]. They argued that the embryos of 'higher' animals went through or recapitulated a series of stages, each of which resembled an animal lower down the [[great chain of being]]. For example, the brain of a human embryo looked first like that of a [[fish]], then in turn like that of a [[reptile]], [[bird]], and [[mammal]] before becoming clearly [[human]]. The embryologist [[Karl Ernst von Baer]] opposed this, arguing in 1828 that there was no linear sequence as in the great chain of being, based on a single [[body plan]], but a process of [[epigenesis (biology)|epigenesis]] in which structures differentiate. Von Baer instead recognised four distinct animal [[body plan]]s: radiate, like [[starfish]]; molluscan, like [[clam]]s; articulate, like [[lobster]]s; and vertebrate, like fish. Zoologists then largely abandoned recapitulation, though [[Ernst Haeckel]] revived it in 1866.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=O'Connell |first1=Lindsey |title=The Meckel-Serres Conception of Recapitulation |url=https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/meckel-serres-conception-recapitulation |website=The Embryo Project Encyclopedia |accessdate=10 October 2016 |date=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Desmond |first=Adrian J. |authorlink=Adrian Desmond |title=The politics of evolution: morphology, medicine, and reform in radical London |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |year=1989 |isbn=0-226-14374-0 |pages=53–53, 86–88, 337–340, 490–491}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Secord|2003|loc=p. 252–253}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowler |first=Peter J. |title=Evolution: the history of an idea |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |year=2003  |isbn=0-520-23693-9 |pages=120–128, 190–191, 208}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Secord|2003|loc=p. 424, 512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further|Morphology (biology)|Body plan}}

From the early 19th century through most of the 20th century, [[embryology]] faced a mystery. Animals were seen to develop into adults of widely differing [[body plan]], often through similar stages, from the egg, but zoologists knew almost nothing about how  [[embryogenesis|embryonic development]] was controlled at the [[molecular biology|molecular level]], and therefore equally little about how [[developmental biology|developmental processes]] had evolved.&lt;ref name=CarrollNatHist&gt;{{cite web |last1=Carroll |first1=Sean B. |title=The Origins of Form |url=http://www.naturalhistorymag.com/features/061488/the-origins-of-form |website=Natural History |accessdate=9 October 2016 |quote=Biologists could say, with confidence, that forms change, and that natural selection is an important force for change. Yet they could say nothing about how that change is accomplished. How bodies or body parts change, or how new structures arise, remained complete mysteries.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Darwin]] argued that a shared embryonic structure implied a common ancestor. As an example of this, Darwin cited in his 1859 book ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' the [[shrimp]]-like [[larva]] of the [[barnacle]], whose [[Sessility (motility)|sessile]] adults looked nothing like other [[arthropods]]; [[Linnaeus]] and [[Cuvier]] had classified them as [[mollusc]]s.&lt;ref name=Gilbert2003&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gilbert |first1=Scott F. |title=The morphogenesis of evolutionary developmental biology |journal=International Journal of Developmental Biology |date=2003 |volume=47 |pages=467–477 |url=http://www.chd.ucsd.edu/_files/fall2008/Gilbert.2003.IJDB.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Darwin |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles Darwin | title=On the Origin of Species| isbn=0-8014-1319-2 |publisher=John Murray |location=London |year=1859| url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F373&amp;pageseq=457 |pages=439–440 |quote=Cirripedes afford a good instance of this: even the illustrious Cuvier did not perceive that a barnacle was, as it certainly is, a crustacean; but a glance at the larva shows this to be the case in an unmistakeable manner.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin also noted [[Alexander Kovalevsky|Alexander Kowalevsky]]'s finding that the [[tunicate]], too, was not a mollusc, but in its larval stage had a [[notochord]] and pharyngeal slits which developed from the same germ layers as the equivalent structures in [[vertebrate]]s, and should therefore be grouped with them as [[chordates]].&lt;ref name=Gilbert2003/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Richmond | first=Marsha | title=Darwin's Study of the Cirripedia | url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Richmond_cirripedia.html | publisher=Darwin Online | date=January 2007 | accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 19th century zoology thus converted [[embryology]] into an evolutionary science, connecting [[phylogeny]] with [[homology (biology)|homologies]] between the germ layers of embryos. Zoologists including [[Fritz Müller]] proposed the use of embryology to discover [[phylogeny|phylogenetic relationships]] between taxa. Müller demonstrated that [[crustaceans]] shared the [[Crustacean larvae#Nauplius|Nauplius]] larva, identifying several parasitic species that had not been recognised as crustaceans. Müller also recognised that [[natural selection]] must act on larvae, just as it does on adults, giving the lie to recapitulation, which would require larval forms to be shielded from natural selection.&lt;ref name=Gilbert2003/&gt; Two of Haeckel's other ideas about the evolution of development have fared better than recapitulation: he argued in the 1870s that changes in the timing ([[heterochrony]]) and changes in the positioning within the body ([[heterotopy]]) of aspects of embryonic development would drive evolution by changing the shape of a descendant's body compared to an ancestor's. It took a century before these ideas were shown to be correct.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hall |first1=B.

But for the next century, without molecular evidence, progress stalled.&lt;ref name=Gilbert2003/&gt;

===The modern synthesis of the early 20th century===
{{main|Modern synthesis (20th century)}}

In the so-called [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] of the early 20th century, [[Ronald Fisher]] brought together Darwin's theory of [[evolution]], with its insistence on natural selection, [[heredity]], and [[genotype|variation]], and [[Gregor Mendel]]'s [[Mendelian inheritance|laws of genetics]] into a coherent structure for [[evolutionary biology]]. Biologists assumed that an organism was a straightforward reflection of its component genes: the genes coded for proteins, which built the organism's body. Biochemical pathways (and, they supposed, new species) evolved through [[mutation]]s in these genes. It was a simple, clear and nearly comprehensive picture: but it did not explain embryology.&lt;ref name=Gilbert2003/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bock |first=Walter J. |date=July 1981 |title=Reviewed Work: ''The Evolutionary Synthesis.

The evolutionary embryologist [[Gavin de Beer]] anticipated evolutionary developmental biology in his 1930 book ''[[Embryos and Ancestors]]'',&lt;ref name="Held"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Held |first1=Lewis I. |author1link=Lewis I.

As the gaps in the fossil record had been used as an argument against Darwin's gradualist evolution, de Beer's explanation supported the Darwinian position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Ingo Brigandt |year=2006 |title=Homology and heterochrony: the evolutionary embryologist Gavin Rylands de Beer (1899-1972) |journal=[[Journal of Experimental Zoology]] |volume=306B |issue=4 |pages=317–328 |doi=10.1002/jez.b.21100 |url=https://www.ualberta.ca/~brigandt/de_Beer.pdf |pmid=16506229}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite de Beer, the modern synthesis largely ignored embryonic development to explain the form of organisms, since population genetics appeared to be an adequate explanation of how forms evolved.&lt;ref name=Gilbert1991&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gilbert, S.

{{main|Lac operon}}

In 1961, [[Jacques Monod]], [[Jean-Pierre Changeux]] and [[François Jacob]] discovered the [[lac operon]] in the [[bacterium]] ''[[Escherichia coli]]''. It was a cluster of [[gene]]s, arranged in a feedback [[control loop]] so that its products would only be made when "switched on" by an environmental stimulus. One of these products was [[β-galactosidase|an enzyme that splits a sugar]], lactose; and [[lactose]] itself was the stimulus that switched the genes on. This was a revelation, as it showed for the first time that genes, even in an organism as small as a bacterium, were subject to fine-grained control. The implication was that many other genes were also elaborately regulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Monod | first1=Jacques | author1link=Jacques Monod | last2=Changeux | first2=J.P. | last3=Jacob | first3=François | author3link=François Jacob | year=1963 | title=Allosteric proteins and cellular control systems |journal=Journal of Molecular Biology | volume=6 | issue=4 | pages=306–329 | doi=10.1016/S0022-2836(63)80091-1 | pmid=13936070 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The birth of evo-devo and a second synthesis===
In 1977, a revolution in thinking about evolution and developmental biology began, with the arrival of [[recombinant DNA]] technology in [[genetics]], and the papers ''Ontogeny and Phylogeny'' by [[Stephen J. Gould]] and ''Evolution by Tinkering'' by [[François Jacob]]. Gould laid to rest Haeckel's interpretation of evolutionary embryology, while Jacob set out an alternative theory.&lt;ref name=Gilbert2003/&gt; 
This led to [[extended evolutionary synthesis|a second synthesis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gilbert|first1=S.F.|last2=Opitz|first2=J.M.|last3=Raff|first3=R.A.|title=Resynthesizing Evolutionary and Developmental Biology|journal=Developmental Biology|date=1996|volume=173|issue=2|pages=357–372|doi=10.1006/dbio.1996.0032|pmid=8605997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Müller|first1=G.B.|title=Evo–devo: extending the evolutionary synthesis|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|date=2007|volume=8|issue=12|pages=943–949|doi=10.1038/nrg2219|pmid=17984972}}&lt;/ref&gt; at last including embryology as well as [[molecular genetics]], phylogeny, and evolutionary biology to form evo-devo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Goodman CS and Coughlin BS (Eds). |title=Special feature: The evolution of evo-devo biology | journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] | year=2000 | volume=97 | pages=4424–4456|url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/97/9/4424 |doi=10.1073/pnas.97.9.4424 |pmid=10781035 | issue=9 | pmc=18255 | bibcode=2000PNAS...97.4424G | ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=[[Gerd Müller (theoretical biologist)|Müller GB]] and [[Stuart Newman|Newman SA]] (Eds.) |title=Special issue: Evolutionary Innovation and Morphological Novelty | journal=Journal of Exp.

[[Bill McGinnis]] quickly discovered homeotic gene sequences, [[homeobox]]es, in animals in other phyla, in [[vertebrate]]s such as [[frog]]s, [[bird]]s, and [[mammals]]; they were later also found in [[fungi]] such as [[yeast]]s, and in [[plant]]s.&lt;ref name=Winchester/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bürglin |first1=Thomas R. |title=The Homeobox Page |url=http://homeobox.biosci.ki.se/|publisher=[[Karolinska Institutet]] |accessdate=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were evidently strong similarities in the genes that controlled development across all the [[eukaryote]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Holland|first1=P.W.|title=Evolution of homeobox genes |journal=Wiley Interdiscip Rev Dev Biol |date=2013 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=31–45 |doi=10.1002/wdev.78 |pmid=23799629 |quote=Homeobox genes are found in almost all eukaryotes, and have diversified into 11 gene classes and over 100 gene families in animal evolution, and 10 to 14 gene classes in plants.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, more specific similarities were discovered: for example, the [[Distal-less]] gene was found in 1989 to be involved in the development of appendages or limbs in fruit flies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cohen, S.

==The control of body structure==
===Deep homology===
{{further|Deep homology}}

Roughly spherical eggs of different animals give rise to extremely different bodies, from jellyfish to lobsters, butterflies to elephants. Many of these organisms share the same structural genes for body{{hyp}}building&lt;!--nothing to do with steroids and gyms--&gt; proteins like collagen and enzymes, but biologists had expected that each group of animals would have its own rules of development. The surprise of evo-devo is that the shaping of bodies is controlled by a rather small percentage of genes, and that these regulatory genes are ancient, shared by all animals. The [[giraffe]] does not have a gene for a long neck, any more than the [[elephant]] has a gene for a big body. Their bodies are patterned by a system of switching which causes development of different features to begin earlier or later, to occur in this or that part of the embryo, and to continue for more or less time.&lt;ref name=CarrollNatHist/&gt;

The puzzle of how embryonic development was controlled began to be solved using the fruit fly ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' as a [[model organism]]. The step-by-step control of [[Drosophila embryogenesis|its embryogenesis]] was visualized by attaching [[fluorescence|fluorescent]] dyes of different colours to specific types of protein made by genes expressed in the embryo.&lt;ref name=CarrollNatHist/&gt; A dye such as [[green fluorescent protein]], originally from [[Aequorea victoria|a jellyfish]], was typically attached to an [[antibody]] specific to a fruit fly protein, forming a precise indicator of where and when that protein appeared in the living embryo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fluorescent Probes |url=https://www.thermofisher.com/uk/en/home/life-science/protein-biology/protein-biology-learning-center/protein-biology-resource-library/pierce-protein-methods/fluorescent-probes.html# |publisher=ThermoFisher Scientific |accessdate=12 October 2016 |date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using such a technique, in 1994 [[Walter Gehring]] found that the ''[[pax-6]]'' gene, vital for forming the eyes of fruit flies, exactly matches an eye-forming gene in mice and humans. The same gene was quickly found in many other groups of animals, such as [[squid]], a [[cephalopod]] [[mollusc]]. Biologists including [[Ernst Mayr]] had believed that eyes had arisen in the animal kingdom at least 40 times, as the anatomy of different types of eye varies widely.&lt;ref name=CarrollNatHist/&gt; For example, the fruit fly's [[compound eye]] is made of hundreds of small lensed structures ([[ommatidia]]); the [[human eye]] has a [[blind spot (vision)|blind spot]] where the [[optic nerve]] enters the eye, and the nerve fibres run over the surface of the [[retina]], so light has to pass through a layer of nerve fibres before reaching the detector cells in the retina, so the structure is effectively "upside-down"; in contrast, the cephalopod eye has the retina, then a layer of nerve fibres, then the wall of the eye "the right way around".&lt;ref name=Land1992&gt;{{cite journal |first=M.

===Gene toolkit ===
[[File:Hoxgenesoffruitfly.svg|Expression of [[Hox gene|homeobox (Hox) genes]] in the fruit fly|thumb|300px]]
{{main|Evo-devo gene toolkit}}

A small fraction of the genes in an organism's genome control the organism's development. These genes are called the developmental-genetic toolkit. They are highly conserved among [[Phylum|phyla]], meaning that they are ancient and very similar in widely separated groups of animals. Differences in deployment of toolkit genes affect the body plan and the number, identity, and pattern of body parts. Most toolkit genes are parts of [[signalling pathway]]s: they encode [[transcription factor]]s, [[cell adhesion]] proteins, cell surface [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] proteins and signalling [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligands]] that bind to them, and secreted [[morphogens]] that diffuse through the embryo. All of these help to define the fate of undifferentiated cells in the embryo. Together, they generate the patterns in time and space which shape the embryo, and ultimately form the [[body plan]] of the organism. Among the most important toolkit genes are the [[Hox gene|''Hox'' genes]]. These transcription factors contain the [[homeobox]] protein-binding DNA motif, also found in other toolkit genes, and create the basic pattern of the body along its front-to-back axis.&lt;ref name=Carroll_2008/&gt;
Hox genes determine where repeating parts, such as the many [[vertebra]]e of [[snake]]s, will grow in a developing embryo or larva.&lt;ref name=CarrollNatHist/&gt; ''Pax-6'', already mentioned, is a classic toolkit gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Xu, P.X. |author2=Woo, I. |author3=Her, H. |author4=Beier, D.R. |author5=Maas, R.L. |year=1997 |title=Mouse Eya homologues of the Drosophila eyes absent gene require Pax6 for expression in lens and nasal placode |journal=Development |volume=124 |issue=1 |pmid=9006082 |pages=219–231}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homeobox]] genes are also found in plants, implying they are common to all [[eukaryote]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid19734295"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Mukherjee, K. |author2=Brocchieri, L. |author3=Bürglin, T.R. | title=A comprehensive classification and evolutionary analysis of plant homeobox genes | journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution | volume=26 | issue=12 | pages=2775–94 | date=December 2009 | pmid=19734295 | pmc=2775110 | doi=10.1093/molbev/msp201 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid9336443"&gt;{{cite journal | authors=Bürglin, T.R. | title=Analysis of TALE superclass homeobox genes (MEIS, PBC, KNOX, Iroquois, TGIF) reveals a novel domain conserved between plants and animals | journal=Nucleic Acids Research | volume=25 | issue=21 | pages=4173–80 | date=November 1997 | pmid=9336443 | pmc=147054 | doi= 10.1093/nar/25.21.4173}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17501745"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Derelle, R. |author2=Lopez, P. |author3=Le Guyader, H. |author4=Manuel, M. | title=Homeodomain proteins belong to the ancestral molecular toolkit of eukaryotes | journal=Evolution &amp; Development | volume=9 | issue=3 | pages=212–9 | year=2007 | pmid=17501745 | doi=10.1111/j.1525-142X.2007.00153.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The embryo's regulatory networks===
[[File:Gene Regulatory Network.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|A [[gene regulatory network]]]]
{{further|Regulation of gene expression|Transcriptional regulation}}

The protein products of the regulatory toolkit are reused not by duplication and modification, but by a complex mosaic of [[pleiotropy]], being applied unchanged in many independent developmental processes, giving pattern to many dissimilar body structures.&lt;ref name=Carroll_2008/&gt; The loci of these pleiotropic toolkit genes have large, complicated and modular [[cis-regulatory element]]s. For example, while a non-pleiotropic [[rhodopsin]] gene in the fruit fly has a cis-regulatory element just a few hundred [[base pair]]s long, the pleiotropic [[eyeless]] cis-regulatory region contains 6 cis-regulatory elements in over 7000 base pairs.&lt;ref name=Carroll_2008/&gt; The [[gene regulatory network|regulatory networks]] involved are often very large. Each regulatory protein controls "scores to hundreds" of cis-regulatory elements. For instance, 67 fruit fly transcription factors controlled on average 124 target genes each.&lt;ref name=Carroll_2008/&gt; All this complexity enables genes involved in the development of the embryo to be switched on and off at exactly the right times and in exactly the right places. Some of these genes are structural, directly forming enzymes, tissues and organs of the embryo. But many others are themselves regulatory genes, so what is switched on is often a precisely-timed cascade of switching, involving turning on one developmental process after another in the developing embryo.&lt;ref name=Carroll_2008/&gt;

[[File:Drosophila early embryo protein gradients.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Gene product distributions along the long axis of the early embryo of a [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit fly]]]]

Such a cascading regulatory network has been studied in detail in the [[Drosophila embryogenesis|development of the fruit fly embryo]]. The young embryo is oval in shape, like a [[rugby ball]]. A small number of genes produce [[messenger RNA]]s that set up concentration gradients along the long axis of the embryo. In the early embryo, the ''[[bicoid]]'' and ''hunchback'' genes are at high concentration near the anterior end, and give pattern to the future head and thorax; the ''caudal'' and ''[[nanos (gene)|nanos]]'' genes are at high concentration near the posterior end, and give pattern to the hindmost abdominal segments. The effects of these genes interact; for instance, the Bicoid protein blocks the translation of ''caudal'''s messenger RNA, so the Caudal protein concentration becomes low at the anterior end. Caudal later switches on genes which create the fly's hindmost segments, but only at the posterior end where it is most concentrated.&lt;ref name=Russel&gt;{{cite book | last=Russel | first=Peter | title=iGenetics: a molecular approach | year=2010 | publisher=Pearson Education | isbn=978-0-321-56976-9 | pages=564–571 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rivera&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Rivera-Pomar, Rolando |author2=Jackle, Herbert |year=1996 |title=From gradients to stripes in Drosophila embryogenesis: Filling in the gaps | journal=Trends in Genetics |volume=12 | issue=11 | pages=478–483 | doi=10.1016/0168-9525(96)10044-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gap gene expression.svg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Gap gene]]s in the fruit fly are switched on by genes such as ''[[bicoid]]'', setting up stripes across the embryo which start to pattern the body's segments.]]

The Bicoid, Hunchback and Caudal proteins in turn regulate the transcription of [[gap gene]]s such as ''giant'', ''knirps'', ''Krüppel'', and ''tailless'' in a striped pattern, creating the first level of structures that will become segments.&lt;ref name="Nusslein"/&gt; The proteins from these in turn control the [[pair-rule gene]]s, which in the next stage set up 7 bands across the embryo's long axis. Finally, the segment polarity genes such as ''[[engrailed (gene)|engrailed]]'' split each of the 7 bands into two, creating 14 future segments.&lt;ref name=Russel/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rivera/&gt;

This process explains the accurate conservation of toolkit gene sequences, which has resulted in deep homology and functional equivalence of toolkit proteins in dissimilar animals (seen, for example, when a mouse protein controls fruit fly development). The interactions of transcription factors and cis-regulatory elements, or of signalling proteins and receptors, become locked in through multiple usages, making almost any mutation deleterious and hence eliminated by natural selection.&lt;ref name=Carroll_2008/&gt;

==The origins of novelty ==
{{see also|History of evolutionary thought#21st century}}

Among the more surprising and, perhaps, counterintuitive (from a [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|neo-Darwinian]] viewpoint) results of recent research in evolutionary developmental biology is that the diversity of [[body plan]]s and [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] in organisms across many [[phylum|phyla]] are not necessarily reflected in diversity at the level of the sequences of genes, including those of the developmental genetic toolkit and other genes involved in development. Indeed, as John Gerhart and Marc Kirschner have noted, there is an apparent paradox: "where we most expect to find variation, we find conservation, a lack of change".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gerhart |first=John |last2=Kirschner |first2=Marc | year=1997 | title=Cells, Embryos and Evolution| publisher=Blackwell Science |isbn=978-0-86542-574-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; So, if the observed morphological novelty between different [[clade]]s does not come from changes in gene sequences (such as by [[mutation (biology)|mutation]]), where does it come from?

Variations in the toolkit may have produced a large part of the morphological evolution of animals. The toolkit can drive evolution in two ways. A toolkit gene can be expressed in a different pattern, as when the beak of Darwin's [[large ground-finch]] was enlarged by the ''[[Bone morphogenetic protein|BMP]]'' gene,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Abzhanov, A. |author2=Protas, M. |author3=Grant, B.R. |author4=Grant, P.R. |author5=Tabin, C.J. |year=2004 |title=Bmp4 and Morphological Variation of Beaks in Darwin's Finches |journal=Science |volume=305 |issue=5689| doi=10.1126/science.1098095 |pages=1462–1465 |pmid=15353802 |bibcode=2004Sci...305.1462A}}&lt;/ref&gt; or when snakes lost their legs as ''distal-less'' became under-expressed or not expressed at all in the places where other reptiles continued to form their limbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cohn, M.J. |author2=Tickle, C. |title=Developmental basis of limblessness and axial patterning in snakes |year=1999 |journal=Nature |volume=399 |pages=474–479 |pmid=10365960 |issue=6735 |doi=10.1038/20944 |bibcode=1999Natur.399..474C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Or, a toolkit gene can acquire a new function, as seen in the many functions of that same gene, ''distal-less'', which controls such diverse structures as the mandible in vertebrates,&lt;ref name="Beverdam2002"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Jaw Transformation With Gain of Symmetry After DLX5/DLX6 Inactivation: Mirror of the Past?|journal=Genesis|date=August 2002|volume=34 |pages=221–227 |author=Beverdam, A. |author2=Merlo, G.R. |author3=Paleari, L. |author4=Mantero, S. |author5=Genova, F. |author6=Barbieri, O. |author7=Janvier, P. |author8=Levi, G. |doi=10.1002/gene.10156 |issue=4 |pmid=12434331 |hdl=2318/87307 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Depew2002"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Specification of jaw subdivisions by DLX genes |journal=Science |date=October 2002 |volume=298 |issue=5592 |pages=381–385 |author=Depew, M.J. |author2=Lufkin, T. |author3=Rubenstein, J.L. |pmid=12193642 |doi=10.1126/science.1075703 }}&lt;/ref&gt; legs and antennae in the fruit fly,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Panganiban |first1=Grace |last2=Rubenstein |first2=John L.

===Consolidation of epigenetic changes===

Evolutionary innovation may sometimes begin [[Lamarckism|in Lamarckian style]] with [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]] alterations of gene regulation or [[morphogenesis|phenotype generation]], subsequently [[genetic assimilation|consolidated by changes at the gene level]]. Epigenetic changes include modification of DNA by reversible methylation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Epigenetic Inheritance and Evolution: The Lamarckian Dimension |last=Jablonka |first=Eva |last2=Lamb |first2=Marion |year=1995 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford, New York |isbn=978-0-19-854063-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as nonprogrammed remoulding of the organism by physical and other environmental effects due to the inherent [[phenotypic plasticity|plasticity]] of developmental mechanisms.&lt;ref name="West-Eberhard 2003"&gt;{{cite book |last=West-Eberhard |first=M-J. |year=2003 |title=Developmental plasticity and evolution |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-512235-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The biologists [[Stuart Newman|Stuart A. Newman]] and [[Gerd Müller (theoretical biologist)|Gerd B.

===Developmental bias===
[[File:Chilipoda- Geophilomorpha (3309242471).jpg|thumb|Among the [[centipede]]s, all members of the [[Geophilomorpha]] are constrained by a developmental bias to have an odd number of segments, whether as few as 27 or as many as 191.]]

Development in specific lineages can be biased either positively, towards a given trajectory or phenotype,{{efn|Positive bias is sometimes called developmental drive.&lt;ref name=Arthur2001/&gt;}} or negatively, away from producing certain types of change; either may be absolute (the change is always or never produced) or relative. Evidence for any such direction in evolution is however hard to acquire. For example, in the [[gastropod]]s, the snail-type shell is always built as a tube that grows both in length and in diameter; selection has created a wide variety of shell shapes such as flat spirals, [[cowrie]]s and tall turret spirals within these constraints. Among the [[centipede]]s, the [[Lithobiomorpha]] always have 15 trunk segments as adults, probably the result of a developmental bias towards an odd number of trunk segments. Another centipede order, the [[Geophilomorpha]], the number of segments varies in different species between 27 and 191, but the number is always odd, making this an absolute constraint; almost all the odd numbers in that range are occupied by one or another species.&lt;ref name=Arthur2001&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Arthur |first=W. |date=July 2001 |title=Developmental drive: an important determinant of the direction of phenotypic evolution |journal=Evolution &amp; Development |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=271–278 |pmid=11478524 |doi=10.1046/j.1525-142x.2001.003004271.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Arthur2002Centipedes&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Arthur |first=W. |date=October 2002 |title=The interaction between developmental bias and natural selection: from centipede segments to a general hypothesis |journal=Heredity |volume=89 |issue=4 |pages=239–246 |doi=10.1038/sj.hdy.6800139 |pmid=12242638}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ChipmanArthurAkam2004&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Chipman |first=Ariel D. |last2=Arthur |first2=Wallace |last3=Akam |first3=Michael |date=July 2004 |title=A Double Segment Periodicity Underlies Segment Generation in Centipede Development |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982204005184 |journal=Current Biology |volume=14 |issue=14 |pages=1250–1255 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2004.07.026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[FMRFamide]], a neuropeptide involved in cardiac activity regulation, is found in ''[[Biomphalaria glabrata]]'', a species of a [[freshwater snail]] best known for its role as the intermediate host for the human-infecting [[trematode]] parasite ''[[Schistosoma mansoni]]''.

This freshwater snail species is used as a [[model organism]], in other words, a [[non-human]] [[species]] which is extensively studied to understand a [[biology|biological]] phenomenon, with the expectation that discoveries made in the model will provide insight into the workings of other organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fields S, Johnston M | title=Cell biology. Whither model organism research? | journal=Science | volume=307 | issue=5717 | pages=1885–6 | date=Mar 2005 | pmid=15790833 | doi=10.1126/science.1108872 | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/307/5717/1885}}&lt;/ref&gt; Model organisms are [[in vivo]] models and are widely used to research human [[disease]] when [[human experimentation]] would be unfeasible or [[bioethics|unethical]].&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, E. C. (2010) [http://www.emily-griffiths.postgrad.shef.ac.uk/models.pdf What is a model?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312220527/http://www.emily-griffiths.postgrad.shef.ac.uk/models.pdf |date=March 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relevance==
This snail has been studied in relation to human pathology and the [[epidemiology]] of [[schistosomiasis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Santama N, Benjamin PR |title=Gene expression and function of FMRFamide-related neuropeptides in the snail ''Lymnaea'' |journal=Microscopy Research Technology |volume=49 |issue=6 |pages=547–556 |date=June 2000 |doi= 10.1002/1097-0029(20000615)49:6&lt;547::aid-jemt5&gt;3.3.co;2-p |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''S. masoni'' is known to change its host’s (''B. glabrata'''s) behavior via the upregulation/downregulation of [[neuropeptide]]s such as [[schistosomin]] and NPY, and some studies have reported that FMRFamide is [[aminergic]], and may be implicated in the secretion of molecules to respond to infection with [[parasite]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Weinlander E, Humphries J |title=5-HT and FMRFamide in the embryonic central nervous system of Biomphalaria glabrata |journal=Lawrence University Honors Projects |date=May 2012 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ganglionic [[central nervous system]] (CNS) of ''B. glabrata'' consists of paired cerebral, pedal, pleural, parietal, and buccal ganglia, and one unpaired visceral ganglion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Darnell, J. E. |author2=Lodish, H. F. |author3= Baltimore, D. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Molecular cell biology. |journal=Scientific American Books |pages=302–312 |date=1990|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; FMRFamide is concentrated in the concentrated in the cerebral and visceral ganglia, although evidence from current research suggests that FMRFamide moves downward of the head-foot region of the snail as embryonic development proceeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kempf SC, Page LR, Pires A |title=Development of serotonin-like immunoreactivity in the embryos and larvae of nudibranch mollusks with emphasis on the structure and possible function of the apical sensory organ |journal=The Journal of Comparative Neurology |volume=386 |issue=3 |pages=507–528 |date=September 1997 |url= |doi=10.1002/(sici)1096-9861(19970929)386:3&lt;507::aid-cne12&gt;3.0.co;2-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact role of FMRFamide during early development of the embryonic central nervous system is not well studied. Detection of this neuropeptide is important because its expression lays down the foundation of the CNS in the early stages of development in invertebrates. In recent years, neuromodulatory actions of FMRFamide in invertebrates have become more apparent. This is in part due to the extensive studies done on the Planorbidae and [[Lymnaeidae]] families of pond snails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bulloch AG, Price DA, Murphy AD, Lee TD, Bowes HN |title=FMRFamide peptides in Helisoma: identification and physiological actions at a peripheral synapse |journal=The Journal of Neuroscience|volume=8 |issue=9 |pages=3459–69 |date=September 1988 |pmid=3171684}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FMRFamide expression in ''B. glabrata'' can be detected as early 72 hours, post-cleavage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Weinlander E, Humphries J |title=5-HT and FMRFamide in the embryonic central nervous system of Biomphalaria glabrata |journal=Lawrence University Honors Projects |date=May 2012 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies have shown its expression pattern in the posterior of the ganglionic nervous system, as the first FMRFamide immunoreactive cell appears at 25-28% of development and is located at the extreme posterior of the embryo. The cell sends a single process on each side and each process follows the body curvature.

As these processes elongate, two lateral FMRFamide-expressing cells are apparent on either side of the body wall. Some studies have suggested that FMRFamide these structures may innervate muscles that originate in trochopore larvae and expand during development. This neuromodulator helps to regulate cardiac activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=López-Vera E, Aguilar MB, Heimer de la Cotera EP | date = Feb 2008 | title = FMRFamide and related peptides in the phylum mollusca | url = | journal = Peptides | volume = 29 | issue = 2| pages = 310–7 | doi=10.1016/j.peptides.2007.09.025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several FMRFamid related peptides are known, regulating various cellular functions and possessing pharmacological actions, such as anti-opiate effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rőszer T, Bánfalvi G | year = 2011 | title = FMRFamide-related peptides: Anti-opiate transmitters acting in apoptosis | url = | journal = Peptides | volume =  34| issue = | pages =  177–85| doi = 10.1016/j.peptides.2011.04.011 | pmid = 21524675 }}&lt;/ref&gt; FMRFamide may also play a role in osmoregulation and developmental patterning. This neuropeoptide has multiple functions and controls many processes that allow the embryo to mature into an adult snail.

==Immunocytochemistry of FMRFamide in ''B. glabrata'' embryos==

FMRFamide patterning over the course of embryonic life has been recorded through [[immunofluorescence]]. Embryos at 0 to 144 hours (6 days) post cleavage were extracted from the egg mass and fixed in 4% PFA for 2 hrs at room temperature.  Embryos older than 4 days were pre-treated with 0.5% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) solution in PBS for 5 minutes to improve primary antibody penetration, and then fixed in 4% PFA for 2 hours at room temperature. Embryos were then washed overnight in 4% Triton X-100 in PBS and incubated in blocking solution, 1% normal goal serum in PBS, overnight at 4&amp;nbsp;°C.

After blocking overnight, embryos were treated with a primary antibody solution at 1:2000 (in NGS/PBS). Secondary antibody tagged with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (polyclonal) was incubated at 1:20, overnight at 4&amp;nbsp;°C. Embryos were then mounted on a slide and viewed with fluorescent microscopy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1713">'''Fast Analog Computing with Emergent Transient States''' or '''FACETS''' is a [[Europe]]an project to research the properties of the human brain. Established and funded by the [[European Union]] in September 2005, the five-year project involves approximately 80 scientists from Austria, France, Germany, Hungary, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. 

The main project goal is to address questions about how the brain computes. Another objective is to create microchip hardware equaling approximately 200,000 neurons with 50 million synapses on a single silicon wafer. Current prototypes are running 100,000 times faster than their biological counterparts, which would make them the fastest analog computing devices ever built for neuronal computations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20010">In [[developmental biology]], '''fate mapping''' is a method of understanding the [[embryo]]nic origin of various [[tissue (biology)|tissue]]s in the adult organism by establishing the correspondence between individual [[cell (biology)|cell]]s (or groups of cells) at one stage of development, and their progeny at later stages of development.  When carried out at single-cell resolution, this process is termed '''cell lineage tracing'''.

==History==
[[File:Fate mapping fig1.jpg|thumb|right]]
The first attempts at fate mapping were made by inferences based on the examination of embryos that had been fixed, sectioned, and [[staining|stained]] at different developmental timepoints.  The disadvantage of this technique was that observation of single points in developmental time provide only snapshots of what cell movements are actually occurring and what fates are being assigned.  Early embryologists thus had to infer which cells became what tissues at later stages.

Early embryologists used "vital dyes" (which would stain but not harm the cells) to follow movements of individual cells or groups of cells over time in ''[[Xenopus]]'' frog embryos.  The tissue(s) to which the cells contribute would thus be labeled and visible in the adult organism.  The first person to develop and use this technique to study cell fate was embryologist [[Walter Vogt]] in 1929.  Vogt used small chips of agar impregnated with a vital dye, (such as [[Nile Blue]] or Nile Red) which he placed on a particular cell or population of cells in ''Xenopus'' embryos until the dye absorbed into the yolk platelets within the desired cell(s).  Once the cells were effectively labeled, the agar chip could be removed and the embryo was allowed to develop normally.  With this method, Vogt was able to discern movements of particular cell populations and the ultimate organ or tissue into which they integrated.  Although innovative for the time, this technique is limiting in that the size of a chip of agar may not accommodate single-cell resolution studies at later stages of development, since successive cell divisions will yield smaller cells (until the embryo develops into a [[larva]]l form that can eat, and thereby grow larger).  Additionally, the cell or cell population of interest must be superficial, since the agar chip with the dye must be placed on the surface of the embryo.

The information Vogt gathered from his tracing experiments of distinct cells and populations of cells in ''Xenopus'' was then pooled to construct a fate map.  The map was a representation of an early-stage embryo (such as a [[blastula]]) that has particular regions highlighted which are known to give rise to specific tissues in the adult organism. For instance, in '''Figure 1''', Nile Blue staining of a 32-cell blastula at the dorsal side of the animal pole yields a blue-stained brain and (depending on the size of the agar chip) may also stain the anterior portion of the [[notochord]].

In 1978, David Weisblat and colleagues in [[Gunther Stent]]'s lab at Berkeley improved the technique of single-cell resolution fate mapping by injection of [[horseradish peroxidase]] (HRP) enzyme, and later fluorescent peptides (1980), into individual cells in ''Helobdella triserialis'' (leech) embryos during early development.  All progeny of the injected cells could later be discerned by staining for HRP using benzidine substrate or visualized by fluorescence microscopy.  This technique allowed the experimenter greater control and selectivity over what cell was labeled and traced.  However, the opaque character of the HRP stain prevented use of vital dye [[nucleus (cell)|nuclear]] counter-stains such as [[Hoechst AG|Hoechst]] 33258 (blue) to observe the [[mitosis|mitotic]] state of the injected cell's progeny.  Also, embryos had to be fixed in order to stain for the HRP, thus allowing only a single timepoint view of each individual leech embryo injected.  The use of fluorescent peptides such as [[Rhodamine]]-D-protein (red, RDP) and [[Fluorescein]]-D-protein (yellow/green, FDP) conjugated to large carrier molecules to prevent diffusion through cell [[gap junction]]s, alleviated several of the shortcomings of HRP injection.  Leech embryos injected with the fluorescent tracers could be visualized, and images collected of the same specimen at multiple timepoints, without fixation.  The fluorescent tracers could also be combined with nuclear Hoechst staining to visualize the mitotic status of the progeny of injected cells.  Seth Blair, also in Stent's lab, introduced a novel ablation technique that could be used in tandem with lineage tracing to pursue the questions relating to developmental potential changes in cell fate in experimentally perturbed embryos that were first raised by Roux and Driesch (1980).  For this purpose, specific cells were ablated by microinjection with [[Pronase]] (an enzyme that digests proteins) to ablate the cell; later modifications of this technique employed [[DNase]] or the [[ricin]] A chain.  The single-cell injection technique is now also in use by researchers studying other model organisms such as ''Xenopus'' (frogs), ''Danio rerio'' ([[zebrafish]]), and ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' (worms).

Genetic cell lineage tracing became an extremely powerful approach when Nat Sternberg and Daniel Hamilton identified a [[topoisomerase]] in P1 bacteriophage called [[Cre recombinase]], which has site-specific (loxP site) recombination activity (1981).  Subsequent studies have used the Cre-lox system in transgenic mice and zebrafish to create tissue specific conditional knockouts.  In order to conditionally ablate a tissue or cell population of interest, one can create a transgenic mouse using a construct containing the promoter of a gene that is specific to the target cell population, so that the Cre recombinase is only expressed in that tissue type.  A second transgenic line must be created, in which loxP recognition sites flank a portion of a particular critical "housekeeping" gene such as [[DNA polymerase-β]].  Each transgene is completely harmless by itself; however, when the two strains are crossed, the Cre expressed in the target cell population will cause the excision of DNA pol-β in those cells, which will die.  Use of the Cre system instead of injected Pronase ensures that when the targeted cell(s) dies, its intracellular contents will not harm neighboring cells since the Cre is innocuous by itself and outside the cell, whereas Pronase can damage other cells and the extracellular matrix and thus may have nonspecific effects on development.  This approach allows tissue-specific targeted ablation studies, which are important for understanding the importance of particular progenitor cells in the establishment and functionality of adult tissues.

However, in some cases a particular gene of interest is turned on multiple times during development, and Cre-mediated ablation during that first wave of expression is lethal.  In this scenario, it is possible to use an inducible version of the transgene: the Cre-ERt loxP approach.  Here, the Cre-ERt is a fusion of the recombinase and Tamoxifen-responsive estrogen receptor (ERt).  Cre-ERt will be expressed in the cytoplasm of cells expressing its upstream promoter, but will not translocate to the nucleus to conduct recombination until the animal is dosed with [[Tamoxifen]].  This tightly-regulated genetic approach to ablation studies has been an invaluable tool for learning about the hierarchy of cell fate during embryogenesis – as well as many other fields of research.

Cre-lox can also be used to permanently, fluorescently label cells by using a transgenic which contains a ubiquitous promoter such as β-actin driving a super-stop sequence flanked by loxP sites, upstream of a fluorescent protein sequence such as RFP.  In this fashion, Julien Bertrand from David Traver's lab and Neil Chi discovered the endothelial-origin of [[hematopoietic]] (blood) stem cells in zebrafish by using a transgenic with an endothelial promoter, kdrl, driving Cre recombinase crossed to β-actin loxP transgenic fish (2010). Thus, in the presence of Cre, all [[endothelium]]-derived cells became indelibly fluorescent red since the super-stop was removed from the genome, and RFP will be expressed under the control of β-actin in all cellular progeny.  Indeed, they found that nearly all hematopoietic stem cells and differentiated blood cells were RFP+, indicating their embryonic endothelial origin (See '''Figure 2''').  Similar site-directed recombination technology such as [[FLP-FRT recombination]] (Flippase and Flippase recognition target sites) is extremely powerful in cell fate mapping, ablation studies, and genetic mosaic analysis; this tool is also used heavily in studies in animal systems as divergent as mice and flies. In a similar fashion to reporter gene activation, Cre-lox recombination system can also be used to activate or inactivate a gene of interest, creating gain-of-function or loss-of-function models. As a matter of fact, researchers often need to perform lineage tracing whist perturbing a gene of interest. To this purpose, one could design a genetic model where within a cell one recombination event is designed for manipulating the gene of interest and the other recombination event is designed for activating a reporter gene. The fate of the cell whose gene is perturbed can then be followed and the function of the gene be revealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lewandoski|first1=Mark|title=Conditional control of gene expression in the mouse|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|date=2001|volume=2|doi=10.1038/35093537|pmid=11584291|pages=743–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interpretation of this kind of cell lineage tracing experiments should be made with caution because the two recombination events may not occur simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Liu | first1= J | last2 = Willet| first2 = SG| last3=Bankaitis| first3=ED| year =2013 | title = Non-parallel recombination limits Cre-LoxP-based reporters as precise indicators of conditional genetic manipulation | journal = Genesis | volume = 51 | issue = 6  | pages = 436–42| doi=10.1002/dvg.22384 |pmid = 23441020 | pmc=3696028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fate mapping fig2.jpg|thumb|right]]
Work in other animal models such as the nematode ''C. elegans'' was done with single-cell resolution prior to the widespread use of injectable cell tracers. The rapid embryonic development and transparent nature of the nematode allowed the construction of a hierarchical fate map of each mitotic event, from the single-cell zygote to the multicellular adult worm by [[John Sulston]] and colleagues in 1982.  This cell lineage map was based entirely on observation using [[Nomarski]] optics, with no dyes.

For a comprehensive scientific review of fate mapping, this ''Lineage Tracing'' review published in Cell 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kretzschemar|first1=K|last2=Watt|first2=F.M.|title=Lineage tracing|journal=Cell|date=Jan 12, 2012|volume=148|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2012.01.002|pages=33–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a great one.

==New Techniques==
More recently, scientists have developed new tools inspired by past approaches.  The use of fluorescent peptide tracers can be helpful, but in order to extend fate mapping to later stages when cells are smaller and thus difficult to consistently and selectively inject (unlike the 0.5mm leech embryo), modifications were made.  Chemically-"caged" fluorescent peptides, such as caged Rhodamine-dextran or caged Fluorescein-dextran (FITC), have been developed to be non-fluorescent until hit with an ultraviolet (450&amp;nbsp;nm) laser, which "uncages" the compound and causes it to fluoresce.  This tool was particularly well received in the zebrafish community since it is ideal to inject caged compound into a freshly fertilized, single-cell embryo that will rapidly develop over 24 hours into a transparent swimming larvae with approximately 30,000 cells.  Injection of the compound into the single-cell embryo allows uniform distribution throughout all the cells of the developing embryo, and the dextran carrier, developed by Jochen Braun and Bob Glimich prevents diffusion between cells through [[gap junctions]], which are common during embryogenesis.  At a given stage of development, one can use a UV laser to uncage the compound in a distinct cell or set of cells, effectively labeling them red (Rhodamine) or green (FITC).  The embryos can be allowed to develop normally until a later time, at which point they can be imaged for red or green fluorescence in the progeny of the uncaged cells.  However, it is important to note that properly focusing the UV laser beam on an individual cell deep within the embryo is difficult.  Sub-optimal focusing can lead to unintentional uncaging of cells outside the focal plane of the target cell.  Also, uncaged Rhodamine has a short half-life, and must be imaged within 48 hours or the signal may be difficult to see.  Similarly uncaged FITC is sometimes difficult to image later in development, and thus detection by [[immunostaining]] is often performed.  Injected embryos must also be kept in the dark to avoid non-specific uncaging from ambient light.

Aside from chemical tracers, we can also lineage trace with [[Green fluorescent protein|GFP]] mRNA injection, over-express a protein of interest by injecting [[mRNA]], [[gene knockdown|knockdown]] expression by [[shRNA]] injection or mutant protein construct injection to see what cell types and tissues are affected during embryogenesis.  Particularly mRNAs encoding [[histone]] tagged with green, cyan, yellow or red fluorescent proteins co-injected with mRNA for a membrane-bound fusion protein conjugated to another [[fluorophore]], greatly enhance our ability to obtain high-resolution images of individual cell movements over time.  Such microinjection experiments allow highly specific and selective cell manipulations superior to gross ablation experiments.  Thus, specificity will facilitate the effective observation of injected cells and their neighbors and resultant deviations from normal development.

Fate mapping is therefore an extremely powerful tool for biologists, with new and improved tools constantly evolving to allow great resolution of what goes on during embryogenesis in various model organisms.  Many genetic and chemical tools have been generated that allow long-term cell lineage tracing, bringing insight into the longevity of embryonic stem cells for various tissues.  The ability to over-express and knockdown putative cell-fate patterning molecules and fluorescently label them, will also enhance our understanding of the extrinsic and intrinsic molecular cues required by various cell types during embryogenesis.

[[File:Fridericus Spee SJ.jpg|thumb|Contemporary portrait]]
'''Friedrich Spee''' (also ''Friedrich Spee von Langenfeld''; February 25, 1591 – August 7, 1635) was a German [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priest, professor, and poet, most noted as an opponent of [[Witch trials|trials for witchcraft]].  Spee was the first person in his time to present strong written and spoken arguments against [[torture]], especially with regards to its unreliability in obtaining "truth" from someone undergoing painful questioning.&lt;ref name="Hellyer"&gt;Friedrich Spee von Langenfeld: ''Cautio Criminalis, or a Book on Witch Trials'' (1631), translated by Marcus Hellyer. University of Virginia Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-8139-2182-1}}. The [https://books.google.com/books?id=gp1GMTaUuzwC&amp;printsec=frontcover translator's introduction (pp. vii–xxxvi)] contains many details on Spee's life.&lt;/ref&gt;

His name is often incorrectly cited as "Friedrich von Spee".&lt;ref name="franz2001"&gt;''Friedrich Spee zum 400 Geburtstag. Kolloquium der Friedrich-Spee-Gesellschaft Trier'' (in German). Paderborn: Gunther Franz, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
[[File:Paderborn - 2016-09-14 - Friedrich Spee (2).jpg|thumb|Statue in Paderborn]]
Spee was born at [[Kaiserswerth]] on the [[Rhine River|Rhine]]. On finishing his early education at [[Cologne]], he entered the Society of Jesus in 1610, and pursued extensive studies and activity as a teacher&lt;ref name="Hellyer"/&gt; at [[Trier]], [[Fulda]], [[Würzburg]], [[Speyer]], [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] and [[Electorate of Mainz|Mainz]], where he was ordained a [[Catholic priest]] in 1622. He became [[professor]] at the [[University of Paderborn]] in 1624. From 1626 he taught at Speyer, [[Wesel]], Trier and Cologne, and preached at [[Paderborn]], Cologne and [[Hildesheim]].

An attempt to assassinate Spee was made at [[Peine]] in 1629. He resumed his activity as professor and priest at Paderborn and later at Cologne, and in 1633 removed to Trier. During the storming of the city by the imperial forces in March 1635 (in the [[Thirty Years' War]]), he distinguished himself in the care of the suffering, and died soon afterwards of a [[Plague (disease)|plague]] infection contracted while ministering to wounded soldiers in a hospital.&lt;ref name="Hellyer" /&gt;

==Publications==
[[File:Trutz nachtigal 1654.jpg|thumb|Spee's ''Trutz-Nachtigal'']]
Spee's literary activity was largely confined to the last years of his life, the details of which are relatively obscure. Two of his works were not published until after his death: ''Goldenes Tugendbuch'' (Golden Book of Virtues), a book of devotion highly prized by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], and ''Trutznachtigall'' (Rivaling the Nightingale), a collection of fifty to sixty sacred songs, which take a prominent place among religious lyrics of the 17th century and have been repeatedly printed and updated through the present.

His principal work, the ''Cautio Criminalis'' (Precautions for Prosecutors), is a layout for the prosecution of witchcraft, based on his own experiences in [[Westphalia]]. It is thought that he acted for a long time as "witch confessor" in Würzburg, as he seemed to have knowledge of what could be considered the private thoughts of the condemned. The book was printed in Latin in 1631 at [[Rinteln]] without Spee's name or permission. He did not advocate the immediate abolition of trials for witchcraft, but described with [[sarcasm]] the abuses in the prevailing legal proceedings, particularly the use of the [[rack (torture)|rack]]. He demanded measures of reform, such as a new German imperial law on the subject, and liability to damages on the part of the judges. If these had been carried out, they would have quickly put an end to the mass persecution of suspected witches.

Nevertheless, the ''Cautio Criminalis'' did bring about the abolition of witch-burning in a number of places, especially at [[Mainz]], and led the way to its gradual suppression. The moral impact created by the publication was considerable. Even in the 17th century, a number of new editions and translations appeared. Among the members of Spee's Jesuit order, his treatise found a favourable reception. A memorable observation in the book suggested that Germany and England must have more witches and devils than Spain and Italy, since there were so many more stake burnings in the former. This may have been a not so subtle criticism of Protestant reform Europe, which he believed was guilty of even greater abuses than the Catholic countries. His book is still in print.&lt;ref name="Hellyer" /&gt;

===Arguments against torture===
[[File:Cautio criminalis 1631.jpg|thumb|Spee's ''Cautio Criminalis'', attributed to "unknown Roman theologian"]]
''Cautio Criminalis'' contains 52 questions which Spee argued and attempted to answer.&lt;ref name="Hellyer" /&gt; Amongst his more notable conclusions were:

* (17) That alleged witches should be provided a [[lawyer]] and a [[legal defense]], the enormity of the crime making this right even more important than normal.
* (20) That there is a real risk that innocents will confess under torture simply to stop the pain.
* (25) That condemning alleged witches for ''not'' confessing under torture is absurd. Spee opposed the notion that such silence was itself evidence of sorcery, as this made everyone guilty.
* (27) That torture does not produce truth, since those who wish to stop their own suffering can stop it with either the truth or with lies.
* (44) That denunciations of accomplices by tortured "witches" were of little value: either the tortured person was innocent, in which case she had no accomplices, or she was really in league with the [[Devil]], in which case her denunciations could not be trusted either.

Spee was particularly concerned about cases where a person was tortured and forced to denounce accomplices, who were then tortured and forced to denounce more accomplices, until everyone was under suspicion:

:''Many people who incite the [[Inquisition]] so vehemently against sorcerers in their towns and villages are not at all aware and do not notice or foresee that once they have begun to clamor for torture, every person tortured must denounce several more. The trials will continue, so eventually the denunciations will inevitably reach them and their families, since, as I warned above, no end will be found until everyone has been burned.'' (question 15)&lt;ref name="Hellyer" /&gt;

Spee did not dispute the existence of witches, and opened his work with a declaration that witches are real. However, he was most troubled that innocent people were being tortured and killed alongside real witches, as he strongly believed. He argued (question 13) that the [[Parable of the Weeds]] in [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 13:24-30 meant that some of the guilty must be allowed freedom, so that the innocent are not condemned either.

===Hymn writer===
[[File:Friedrich Spee von Langenfeld Briefmarke zum 400. Geburtstag.JPG|thumb|German postage stamp honoring Spee's 400th birthday (1991)]]
Spee wrote the lyrics and tunes of dozens of hymns, and is still the most heavily attributed author in German Catholic hymnals today.&lt;ref name="Hellyer" /&gt; Although an anonymous hymnist during his lifetime, today he is credited with several popular works including the [[Advent song]] "[[O Heiland, reiß die Himmel auf]]", the [[Christmas carol]]s "[[Vom Himmel hoch, o Engel, kommt]]" and "{{lang|de|[[Zu Bethlehem geboren]]|italic=no}}", and the Easter hymn "[[Lasst uns erfreuen]]" widely used with the 20th-century English texts "[[Ye Watchers and Ye Holy Ones]]" and "[[All Creatures of Our God and King]]".

{{Nihongo|'''Fujiwara no Genshi'''|藤原 嫄子||August 24, 1016 – September 19, 1039}}, born {{Nihongo|'''Princess Genshi'''|嫄子女王}}, was an Empress consort of middle-[[Heian period]] Japan. She was an empress consort (''[[chūgū]]'') of [[Emperor Go-Suzaku]] of Japan.

She was the adopted daughter of [[Fujiwara no Yorimichi]] and biological daughter of {{Nihongo|Imperial Prince Atsuyasu|敦康親王}}.

== Life ==
Genshi's father Atsuyasu died in 1018. Her mother was the younger sister of [[Fujiwara no Yorimichi]]'s official wife, Princess Takahime, and so the daughterless Yorimichi adopted her. In 1036, she acted as a substitute court lady in the purification ceremony at [[Emperor Go-Suzaku]]'s first ''niiname-sai'' harvest festival. The next year, she entered his court as a court lady, and received the [[Ritsuryō#Establishment of court rank|rank]] of {{Nihongo||正四位下|shō shi-i no ge}}. Two months later she was made ''chūgū'', displacing the existing empress consort [[Princess Teishi]] to ''[[Japanese empresses|kōgō]]'' and souring relations between Teishi and Yorimichi. Favored by the Emperor, Genshi bore him two girls, but died in childbirth at the age of 24 without giving birth to a prince.

According to the {{Nihongo|records of [[Ise Shrine]]|太神宮諸雑事記|daijingū shozō-kiji}}, when Genshi was bathing ten days after giving birth, there was a great storm. Amidst the lightning and thunder and heavy rain, Genshi died on the spot. At the time, there was a rumor that the Fujiwara family god of [[Kasuga-taisha]] was angered that Genshi had been made Empress through adoption into the [[Fujiwara clan]], despite blood ties to the [[Minamoto clan]].

'''Functional extinction''' is the [[extinction]] of a [[species]] or other [[taxon]] such that:

#the population is no longer viable. There are no individuals able to reproduce, or the small population of breeding individuals will not be able to sustain itself due to [[inbreeding depression]] and [[genetic drift]], which leads to a loss of [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]].

In plant populations, [[Self-incompatibility in plants|self-incompatibility mechanisms]] may cause related plant specimens to be incompatible, which may lead to functional extinction if an entire population becomes self-incompatible. This does not occur in larger populations.

In [[Polygyny in animals|polygynous]] populations, where only a few males leave offspring, there is a much smaller reproducing population than if all viable males were considered. Furthermore, the successful males act as a genetic bottleneck, leading to more rapid genetic drift or inbreeding problems in small populations.

'''Sir Guy Standing''' [[Order of the British Empire|KBE]] (1 September 1873 – 24 February 1937) was an English actor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://allmovie.com/artist/guy-standing-67554 Guy Standing; allmovie]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Standing served in the [[Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve]] throughout the [[First World War]], reaching the rank of [[commander]]. He was seconded to the SIS, but transferred to the Ministry of Information in December 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Churchill's Man of Mystery: Desmond Morton and the World of Intelligence|first=Gill |last=Bennett|publisher=Routledge|year=2007|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1918, he was part of the British War Mission to the [[United States]]. For this service, he was made a [[Order of the British Empire|Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in 1918 and raised to Knight Commander (KBE) in the [[1919 New Year Honours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=31114 |supp=y |page=448|date= 8 January 1919}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After becoming a noted actor in British and American theatre, he moved to Hollywood in the early 1930s appearing in [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] films. His best-known role is probably that of Colonel Stone, autocratic father of Lieutenant Stone (played by [[Richard Cromwell]]), in [[Henry Hathaway]]'s ''[[The Lives of a Bengal Lancer (film)|Lives of a Bengal Lancer]]'' (1935).

He was the son of [[Herbert Standing]] (1846–1923), a noted actor from the stage and in silent films. His brothers [[Jack Standing]], Herbert Standing Jr., [[Percy Standing]] and [[Wyndham Standing]] were also actors, as was his third wife Dorothy Hammond, (née Plaskitt; died 1950), his son Guy Standing Jr. and his daughter, [[Kay Hammond]] (née Dorothy Katherine Standing) and grandson [[John Standing]].

His son by Dorothy Hammond, and brother of Kay Hammond, Michael Standing (died 1 December 1984), was the first live [[BBC]] [[cricket]] commentator and live radio commentator, known particularly for his "Standing on the Corner" slot in ''In Town Tonight''. After a distinguished war record as Head of Outside Broadcasting, he went on to become Director of Variety. In this role he was responsible for commissioning such classics as ''[[The Goon Show]]'', ''[[The Navy Lark]]'', ''[[Hancock's Half Hour]]'' and ''[[Round the Horne]]''. His later roles in radio management included the negotiation with the [[Musicians' Union (UK)|Musicians' Union]] to provide sufficient airtime for both recorded artists and live orchestras. The agreement he made enabled the start of Radio 1. Michael also wrote ''The Green Book'', a book of rules and principles put into practice by the BBC of [[John Reith, 1st Baron Reith|Lord Reith]].

Standing's first wife was American stage actress [[Isabelle Urquhart]], several years his senior. They divorced and she died in 1907 aged 42.
Standing died from a heart attack, with cardiovascular disease as the likely cause. Rumours surrounding Standing's death suggested that he had died from the complications of either a black widow spider or rattlesnake bite, but this has been deemed false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ellenberger |first=Allan R. |title=Sir Guy Standing – death by rattlesnake? |publisher=allanellenberger.com |url=http://allanellenberger.com/sir-guy-standings-mythical-death/ |accessdate=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Jurassic Fight Club''''' (titled ''Dinosaur Secrets'' in [[Australia]]/[[United Kingdom|UK]]) is a [[paleontology]]-based [[television series]] on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History channel]] which premiered in the US in July 2008. ''Jurassic Fight Club'' was hosted by [[George Blasing]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dinosaurgeorge.com/About_Dinosaur_George.html  George Blasing's bio] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114053334/http://www.dinosaurgeorge.com/About_Dinosaur_George.html |date=2012-01-14 }} at his website.&lt;/ref&gt; a self-taught paleontologist. The show ran for one season of 12 episodes and was not renewed.

==Summary==
Scientists study the battles of prehistoric creatures, such as [[dinosaurs]], before they became extinct. Each episode features a [[forensic]]-styled breakdown of a prehistoric battle. Based on [[fossil]] evidence and paleontologic analysis, a [[computer-generated imagery]] rendering of the battle, based on the evidence and the imagination of [[George Blasing]] (the show's host) is the final act of each episode. In most cases, the battles are based on actual fossil finds, although in several episodes, scientists simply put two contemporaneous prehistoric animals against each other.

Below is a partial list of selected '''villages and towns''' ''([[shtetls]])'' '''depopulated of Jews during [[the Holocaust]]'''. The liquidation actions were carried out mostly by the Nazi [[Einsatzgruppen]] and [[Ordnungspolizei#Police Battalions|Orpo police]] as well as [[Schutzmannschaft|auxiliary battalions]] through [[mass killing]]s. The German "pacification" units of the [[Einsatzkommando]] were paramilitary forces within the [[Schutzstaffel]], under the high command of the [[Obergruppenführer]]. The ''Einsatzgruppen'' operated primarily in the years 1941–45.

'''Margaret Barry''' (1917–1989) was an [[Irish Traveller]], [[Traditional Irish Singers|traditional singer]] and [[banjo]] player. She became a well-known name on the London folk scene in the 1950s, with her distinctive singing style and idiosyncratic banjo accompaniment.
Born Margaret Cleary in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] into a family of [[Irish Traveller|Travellers]] and street singers, she taught herself how to play the zither banjo and the fiddle at a young age. At the age of sixteen, after a family disagreement, Margaret left home and started performing as a street musician.

In the early 1950s she moved to London. With her flamboyant delivery and idiosyncratic banjo-playing, Barry became well known in the pubs and clubs of Irish London, where she was frequently accompanied by the fiddler [[Michael Gorman (musician)|Michael Gorman]]. Barry's singing and banjo playing became a major influence on the younger generation of ballad singers in Ireland and the UK, including [[Luke Kelly]].

One song for which Barry is particularly noted is "[[She Moved Through the Fair]]". Asked by an interviewer, [[Karl Dallas]], whether she had learned it from her family or from other Travellers, she replied cheerfully, "Oh, no. I got it off a gramophone record by Count [[John McCormack (tenor)|John McCormack]]". {{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

The accompanying book to the Topic Records 70 year anniversary boxed set ''[[Three Score and Ten]]'' lists ''Her Mantle So Green'' as one of the classic albums&lt;ref name = "Three Score and Ten Accompanying Book"&gt;[http://www.topicrecords.co.uk/category/three-score-ten Three Score and Ten Accompanying Book]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|16}} and ''The Factory Girl'' from ''Street Songs and Fiddle Tunes of Ireland'' with Michael Gorman is track 9 on the third CD in the set.

'''Mariano Moreno''' ({{IPA-es|maˈɾjano moˈɾeno}}; September 23, 1778 – March 4, 1811&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.me.gov.ar/efeme/25demayo/moreno.html |title=Mariano Moreno |publisher=Argentina Ministry of Education |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531205554/http://www.me.gov.ar/efeme/25demayo/moreno.html |archive-date=May 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was an Argentine lawyer, journalist, and politician. He played a decisive role in the [[Primera Junta]], the first national government of Argentina, created after the [[May Revolution]].

Moreno was born in [[Buenos Aires]] in 1778. His father was Manuel Moreno y Argumosa, born in [[Santander, Cantabria|Santander]], [[Spain]], who arrived in the city in 1776 and married María del Valle. Mariano was the firstborn of the Moreno family and had thirteen brothers. During his youth he studied Latin, logic, and philosophy at San Carlos Royal College, followed by college studies of law at [[St Francis Xavier University of Chuquisaca|Chuquisaca]]. During these studies, he learned the new ideas of the [[Enlightenment in Spain|Spanish Enlightenment]]. He married María Guadalupe Cuenca and returned to Buenos Aires, becoming a prominent lawyer for the [[Buenos Aires Cabildo|Cabildo]]. Unlike most other [[Criollo people|criollos]], he rejected the [[Carlotism|Carlotist]] project and the administration of [[Santiago de Liniers]], joining instead the ill-fated [[mutiny of Álzaga]] against him. He worked for the next viceroy, [[Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros]]. He wrote the economic paper ''[[The Representation of the Landowners]]'', which persuaded the viceroy to open trade with [[United Kingdom|Britain]].

Although he was not prominently involved in the May Revolution that deposed Cisneros, he was appointed as secretary of war of the new government, the Primera Junta. Along with [[Juan José Castelli]], he promoted harsh policies against the supporters of the former government and the strengthening of the new one. These policies were detailed in a secret document, the ''[[Operations plan]]''; some historians dispute its authorship. Moreno organized military campaigns to [[Paraguay campaign|Paraguay]] and [[First Upper Peru campaign|Upper Peru]] and ensured the execution of Santiago de Liniers after the defeat of his [[Liniers counter-revolution|counter-revolution]]. He established the first Argentine newspaper, ''La [[Gazeta de Buenos Ayres]]'', and translated [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s ''[[The Social Contract]]'' into Spanish.

When the Junta achieved the first military victories, President [[Cornelio Saavedra]] opposed Moreno, favoring moderate policies instead. Allied with [[Gregorio Funes]], Saavedra expanded the number of members of the Junta to leave Morenism in a minority. With disputes still going on, Moreno was appointed to a diplomatic mission to Britain but died at sea on the way there. His brother [[Manuel Moreno]] alleged that he was poisoned. His supporters were still an influential political party for some years after his death. Historians hold several perspectives about the role and historical significance of Moreno, from [[hagiography]] to repudiation. He is considered the precursor of [[Argentine journalism]].

==Birth and studies==
Mariano Moreno was the eldest of 14 children of poor parents, Manuel Moreno y Argumosa (born in [[Santander, Spain]]) and Ana María Valle. He studied at [[Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires|Colegio Grande de San Carlos]], but without living in it, as his family could not afford the price.&lt;ref name="Winaski18"&gt;Wiñaski, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated with an honorary diploma.&lt;ref&gt;Luna, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; He met influential people within the literary field, who helped him to continue his studies at the [[University of Chuquisaca]], even when his father could not afford the cost.&lt;ref&gt;Luna, p. 31-32&lt;/ref&gt; This was the only big university in South America at the time. He studied the books of [[Montesquieu]], [[Voltaire]], [[Denis Diderot]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], and other European philosophers of the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. He studied English and French languages as well, to understand authors from Britain and France.&lt;ref&gt;Luna, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed him to work as a translator, and he spent several years working with Rousseau's ''[[The Social Contract]]''. Moreno was convinced that society could be changed by the power of intelligence and reason.&lt;ref&gt;Luna, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:El Contrato Social.jpg|thumb|[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s ''[[The Social Contract]]'', translated into Spanish by Mariano Moreno]]
He also studied philosophical texts of the [[Enlightenment in Spain|Spanish Enlightenment]] under the tutelage of the priest Terrazas and aspired to implement the new ideas in his country. He wrote a thesis with strong criticism of the [[Slavery in the Spanish New World colonies|native slavery]] at the mines of [[Potosí]], influenced by the Spanish jurist Juan de Solorzano Pereira,&lt;ref&gt;Luna, pp. 35–36&lt;/ref&gt; the foremost publisher of Indian Law, and Victoria Villalva, fiscal of the [[Audiencia of Charcas]] and defender of the indigenous cause.&lt;ref&gt;Luna, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

He started his professional career between 1803 and 1804, in the office of Augustine Gascón, officiating as labor counselor for Indians. As a result, he confronted powerful people like the mayors of [[Cochabamba]] and [[Chayanta Municipality|Chayanta]]. He left the city after being threatened and returned to Buenos Aires in 1805 with his wife Maria Guadalupe Cuenca and their newborn son.&lt;ref&gt;Luna, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; Once in the city, he became a reporter of the hearings of the [[Royal Audiencia of Buenos Aires|Royal Audiencia]], a local appeallate court. The [[Buenos Aires Cabildo]], the local council, hired him as an advisor as well. He defended Melchor Fernández, aggrieved by Bishop [[Benito Lue y Riega]], in one of his first cases. In another of his early disputes, he backed the Cabildo in denying the appointment as an ensign of the young [[Bernardino Rivadavia]].&lt;ref&gt;Lagleyze, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

A British army invaded Buenos Aires in 1806, starting the [[British invasions of the Río de la Plata]].&lt;ref name="Winaski11"&gt;Wiñaski, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Although Moreno was not actively involved with the military counter-offensive which drove them out, he opposed the British presence in Buenos Aires.&lt;ref name="Winaski11"/&gt; He wrote a diary that noted all the events, so that, in the future, his countrymen would know the circumstances that allowed such an invasion.&lt;ref&gt;Luna, pp. 47–49&lt;/ref&gt; The British made a new attack in 1807, this time invading [[Montevideo]]. They published a bilingual English–Spanish newspaper known as "[[The Southern Star (Montevideo)|The Southern Star]]" or "La estrella del sur" (the newspaper used both names in conjunction). It advocated [[free trade]], a British goal, and promoted American independence under British protection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.educ.ar/debates/sociedad/sociedad-conocimiento/la-guerra-retorica-de-la-indep.php "La guerra retórica de la Independencia": el caso del periódico The Southern Star] {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal Audiencia of Buenos Aires banned the newspaper and requested Moreno to write articles refuting those of the British publication. Moreno refused because, although he did not accept British rule, he agreed with some of their criticisms of the Spanish government.&lt;ref&gt;Luna, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; Fearing a new attack to Buenos Aires, Moreno left the city with his whole family and relocated in the countryside. His house in Buenos Aires, left unoccupied, was used to keep prisoner [[William Carr Beresford]], the British commander of the first invasion.&lt;ref name="Winaski11"/&gt; Several friends of Moreno helped Beresford to escape and move to Montevideo, but it is unknown if Moreno was aware of the plan.&lt;ref&gt;Wiñaski, pp. 12–13&lt;/ref&gt;

==First political activities==
[[File:Representación de los Hacendados.jpg|thumb|''[[The Representation of the Landowners]]'', economic paper written by Mariano Moreno]]
Although Mariano Moreno was a [[Criollo people|criollo]], a Spanish citizen born in the Americas, he did not work with the other criollos of Buenos Aires who sought to promote political changes against the privileges of the Spanish-born. Unlike the criollo politicians [[Manuel Belgrano]] and [[Juan José Castelli]], he did not support viceroy Liniers or the [[Carlotism|Carlotist]] project, which sought the coronation of [[Carlota of Spain]] in the Americas. He joined mayor [[Martín de Álzaga]] instead, which allowed him to serve as a legal adviser of the Cabildo. In that capacity, he wrote a petition to the King of Spain, so that the [[Buenos Aires Cabildo]] was named ''Protector of the Cabildos of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata''. As a result, all petitions from local cabildos to the King or the Viceroy would be channeled through the Cabildo at the capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year= 1980|title= Defensor de la América del Sur|journal= [[Todo es historia]]|issue= 152|page= 36|location= Buenos Aires|publisher= Todo es historia |language= Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martín de Álzaga organized a [[Mutiny of Álzaga|mutiny]] on January 1, 1809, and Moreno joined it. Álzaga aspired to replace Viceroy [[Santiago de Liniers]] with a [[Junta (Peninsular War)|government Junta]], after learning of the capture of the Spanish King [[Ferdinand VII]] during the [[Peninsular War]] and the creation of the [[Junta of Seville]]. If it prevailed, Mariano Moreno would have been part of the new Junta. The mutiny was defeated by the swift reaction of [[Cornelio Saavedra]], in command of the [[Regiment of Patricians]], who dispersed the crowd and persuaded Liniers not to abdicate. It is disputed by historians whenever the mutiny had similar or opposite goals to those of the [[May Revolution]] that would take place a year later. The historians who support the latter perspective try to make attempts to excuse or justify Moreno's involvement;&lt;ref name="Scenna, p. 12"&gt;Scenna, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; those who support the former consider instead that Moreno was a revolutionary a year before most other Argentines.&lt;ref&gt;Scenna, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Moreno was Álzaga's lawyer in the trial that followed, which was labeled a trial for "independentism". Liniers did not extend the trial to Moreno himself, for reasons unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Scenna, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

Liniers was succeeded by [[Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros]] a few months later, who pardoned the mutineers to reduce political conflicts. Cisneros allowed [[free trade]] as well, as instructed by the Junta of Seville, which benefited British merchants; Britain was allied with Spain in the Peninsular War. The agents of the Consulate of Cadiz asserted that this would hurt the local economy, moral values, social usages, religious practices, and the loyalty to Spain and its monarchy. As a result, Cisneros closed trade again, restoring the Spanish monopsony. A group of hacendados (owners of [[hacienda]]s), who did not feel adequately represented at the Cabildo, asked Moreno to defend them. Moreno wrote ''[[The Representation of the Landowners]]'', a report that represented the export interest of the landowners, encouraged free trade and condemned the privileges of the merchants benefited from the monopsony. It is considered the most comprehensive economic report from the time of the viceroyalty. It represented the new European economic ideas and noted that the legal monopsony with Spain did not prevent British goods from being smuggled. Several authors have questioned Moreno's authorship of the paper, considering it instead an update of another, previously drafted by [[Manuel Belgrano]], Secretary of the [[Commerce Consulate of Buenos Aires]], written to make a similar request to the former viceroy Liniers.&lt;ref&gt;Scenna, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; This report, as well as Moreno's prestige in the colonial society, helped him gain the confidence of Cisneros. Yet secretly, Moreno supported the plan to dismiss the Viceroy.

==Primera Junta==
[[File:Primera Junta (detalle).jpeg|thumb|250px|Mariano Moreno (left) as a member of the [[Primera Junta]].]]
{{main|Primera Junta}}
Mariano Moreno had several contacts with groups seeking the removal of Cisneros but was not strongly involved with the [[May Revolution]], which considered the fall of the Junta of Seville a reason to depose the viceroy and create a local junta. At the time, Moreno was still loyal to Álzaga. He attended the May 22 [[open Cabildo]], but according to the father of [[Vicente Fidel López]] and the father-in-law of [[Bartolomé Mitre]] (both direct witness) he stayed silent at one side and did not join the debate.&lt;ref&gt;Scenna, pp. 33–34&lt;/ref&gt; He voted for Saavedra's proposal: to remove viceroy Cisneros and replace him with a Junta. Manuel Hermenegildo Aguirre, captain of hussars, proposed that the Cabildo take the reins of government, with five men appointed as counselors, Moreno among them. However, nobody else voted for that proposal, and it was the only one that included him.&lt;ref&gt;Balmaceda, pp. 22–23&lt;/ref&gt; Moreno felt betrayed when the Cabildo twisted the results of the open Cabildo and created a Junta that would be headed by Cisneros. He refused any further contacts with the revolutionaries and stayed home during the remaining events. The definitive members of the Junta came from a popular petition signed on May 25, which was given to the Cabildo. The reasons for Moreno's inclusion in the list are unclear, as with all other members of the Junta. A commonly accepted theory considers it to be a balance between Carlotists and [[Martín de Álzaga|Alzaguists]].&lt;ref&gt;Scenna, pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt;

The Junta faced  strong opposition from the beginning: it was resisted locally by the [[Buenos Aires Cabildo|Cabildo]] and the [[Royal Audiencia of Buenos Aires|Royal Audiencia]], still loyal to the absolutist factions; the nearby plazas of Montevideo and Paraguay did not recognize it, and Santiago de Liniers organized a counter-revolution at [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]]. Mariano Moreno, an unimportant politician up to that point, became the leader of the most radical supporters of the Junta. He was supported by the popular leaders [[Domingo French]] and [[Antonio Beruti]], Dupuy, Donado, Orma, and Cardozo; and priests like Grela and Aparicio.&lt;ref name="Galasso, p. 9"&gt;Galasso, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Carlos Ibarguren]] described that Morenist youths roamed the streets preaching new ideas to each pedestrian they found, turned the "Marcos" coffee shop into a political hall, and proposed that all social classes should be illustrated.&lt;ref&gt;Carlos Ibarguren, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manuel Belgrano]] and [[Juan José Castelli]] supported Moreno within the Junta, and French was promoted to Colonel of the regiment "América". This regiment, also known as "The Star" because of a star that they wore on their sleeves, was composed of radical youths led by French during the riots of the May Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Galasso, pp. 10–11&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreno established the official newspaper ''[[Gazeta de Buenos Ayres]]'' through a June 2 decree and managed its contents. The first newspapers were available to the public five days later. He issued a freedom of the press decree, which allowed the press to publish anything that did not offend public morals or attack the Revolution or the government. Moreno published some works of [[Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos|Gaspar de Jovellanos]] and his translation of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s ''[[The Social Contract]]''. In this later work, he skipped the chapter about religion, suggesting that the author "has raved in religious matters".&lt;ref&gt;Mariano Moreno, prologue to ''The Social Contract'' translation – Galasso, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; This was done to prevent religious disputes among patriots.&lt;ref&gt;Galasso, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; This publication was criticized by conservatives such as [[Tomás de Anchorena]], who said that it could generate popular unrest.&lt;ref&gt;"I don't know if someone had read any work of modern politics, neither that there was other than Rousseau's ''The Social Contract'', translated to Spanish by the famous Mariano Moreno, whose work can only serve to disband the populations, turn them into great mobs of angry madmen and villains". (Tomás de Anchorena) – Carlos Ibarguren, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; As with the Junta itself, Moreno's writings maintained loyalty to Ferdinand VII. It is [[Historiography of the May Revolution#Revolutionary purposes|unclear]] to historians whether he was concealing pro-independence ambitions, or was truly loyal to the deposed king. However, he made specific references to independentism as early as November 1810.&lt;ref&gt;Galasso, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; In reference to the Courts of Cádiz that would write a Constitution, he said that the Congress "may establish an absolute disposal of our beloved Ferdinand",&lt;ref&gt;Galasso, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that the right of [[self-determination]] would allow even that. He did not think the monarchical authority to be [[Divine right of Kings|absolute]], but subject to popular sovereignty, so that a monarch may lose his authority if he worked against the common good of the people.&lt;ref&gt;"Imprudent man [Ferdinand VII], what do you discover in your person that makes you superior to us? Which would be your empire, if we hadn't give it to you? Have we released our powers on you so that you can use them for our misfortune? You had the duty to create by yourself our happiness, that was the sole price for which we placed the crown over your head. You allowed it to be stolen by an act of inexperience, capable of generating doubts, about whenever you were excluded from the number of men that nature seems to have shaped to lead others; lowered to prisons and incapable of filling your duties, we took the distasteful work of doing by ourselves what should have been done by those who call themselves our kings; if you oppose our good, you do not deserve to reign over us, and if you want to manifest yourself creditor to the high dignity we have conferred, you should be congratulated of leading a free nation." (Moreno) – Galasso, pp. 105–106&lt;/ref&gt; He also considered that if Ferdinand VII returned to the throne, he would not be able to challenge a Constitution written in his absence.&lt;ref&gt;"Can the king oppose the resolutions of the Congress? Such a doubt could be a crime. The king, at his return, would not be able to resist a Constitution that, even if he was leading the Courts, he would have had to accept... and if one day he achieve the freedom for which we yearn, a simple transmission would restore him to the throne of his elders with the variations and reforms that the peoples would have enacted to prevent the evil results of an arbitrary power." (Moreno) – Galasso, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; However, he wrote that as a hypothetical scenario, to describe the strength of a [[Constitution]], not as a likely possibility.&lt;ref&gt;Galasso, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreno issued several decrees during his first days in government. He ordered punishment for anyone attempting to generate disputes, and for those concealing conspiracies against the Junta or other people.&lt;ref&gt;"Capture and punish with rigor anyone who by work or word attempts to generate divisions or discontents... anyone who does not report any project or conspiracy against the authority or the security of individuals will be declared responsible before the government." (Decree of June 6, 1810) – Galasso, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; The military bodies of "Pardos" and "Morenos", composed of [[Indigenous peoples in Argentina|indigenous peoples]], were reformed to have [[military rank]]s similar to those of the Spanish military bodies. He did this by invoking the rulings of the [[Catholic Monarchs]] during the early [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Junta could not see with indifference that the naturals were incorporated to the caste bodies excluded from the Spanish battalions where they belong. For their class and specific declarations of Your Majesty, from this day on there shall be no difference between the Spanish military and the Indian military, both are equal, and should have always been, because since the beginning of the discovery of these Americas the Catholic Monarchs desired that their peoples should have the same privileges as the vassals of Castilla." (speech of Mariano Moreno, detailed at Juan Manuel Beruti memoirs) – Galasso, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Actions against royalists===
{{see also|Argentine War of Independence}}
[[File:Muerte de Liniers.jpg|thumb|250px|Execution of [[Santiago de Liniers]]]]
Although the Junta of Seville was defeated, a new one was created afterward, the Regency Council. The Primera Junta did not swear loyalty to it, but the Royal Audiencia did so in defiance of the local authority. The Junta summoned them, along with former viceroy Cisneros, and exiled them to Spain with the pretext that there was a threat to their lives. The Junta appointed new members for the Audiencia loyal to the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Galasso, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Moreno wrote in the ''Gazeta'' that the Audiencia attacked the good faith of the government and that the Junta left their usual moderation for the safety of the people.&lt;ref&gt;"The firmness of the government where your trust rests has been strongly attacked and it was needed that the Junta violated its moderation so that the people was not victim of a pusillanimous condescension." (Mariano Moreno, [[Gazeta de Buenos Ayres]], June 23, 1810) – Galasso, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

The Junta was rejected in Montevideo, as was the exile of Cisneros and the former Audiencia. Moreno reacted immediately, replying to the Montevidean concerns. He supported the legitimacy of the Primera Junta by criticizing the Regency Council and stating that the overseas Spanish territories were equally capable of creating Juntas, as it was debated during the open cabildo.&lt;ref&gt;"The Junta advises you to watch carefully the principles that influenced its establishment. The main reason for it was the doubt about the legitimacy with which the fugitive Central Junta, despised by the people, insulted by its own subjects and with public charges of traitor, appointed by itself a Regency Council without asking for the vote of the villages." (Mariano Moreno, June 8, 1810) – Federico Ibarguren, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; He also called for unity and support of the metropolis,&lt;ref&gt;"Let's redouble our efforts to help the metropolis, defend their cause, watch their laws, celebrate their triumphs, cry their bad fortunes, and do what the provincial Juntas did before the establishment of the Central one.'" (Mariano Moreno, June 8, 1810) – Federico Ibarguren, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; and that both cities recognize Ferdinand VII as their legitimate monarch.&lt;ref&gt;"Both cities acknowledge a same monarch, the Junta has sworn for Ferdinand VII and will die keeping his august rights." (Mariano Moreno, June 8, 1810) – Federico Ibarguren, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that the Junta treated the exiles initially with moderation, but their obstinacy, particularly on the part of Cisneros, generated popular discontent.&lt;ref&gt;"The obstinacy of the magistrates and the former viceroy don Baltasar H. de Cisneros, despite of the solicitude and moderation with which the Junta has treated them, have exited the popular fury in such a way that it was imperative to remove them from the city and deport them to the Canary islands until your majesty disposes of these people who, by personal motives, have almost caused the loss of these kingdoms." (Primera Junta, June 21, 1810) – Federico Ibarguren, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; [[Matías Irigoyen]] told the same thing to the British [[Percy Smythe, 6th Viscount Strangford|Lord Strangford]] in Río de Janeiro.&lt;ref&gt;"The Junta does not have at the moment any further interest in independence, a system that Spanish America would only adopt as an alternative to escape from the greatest of all evils: to return to the former state of things." (Matías Irigoyen) – Federico Ibarguren, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreno organized two military expeditions to counter the threat of the plazas that resisted the Junta.

====First Expedition====
The first one, headed by [[Francisco Ortiz de Ocampo]], would move to Córdoba and attack the [[Liniers Counter-revolution|counter-revolution]] organized by the former viceroy Santiago de Liniers; they next went to [[Upper Peru]]. Ocampo's initial orders were to capture the counter-revolutionary leaders and send them to Buenos Aires so that they could be judged.&lt;ref name="Galasso, p. 18"&gt;Galasso, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; When the counter-revolution became stronger Moreno called the Junta and, with support from Castelli and Paso, proposed that the enemy leaders should be shot as soon as they were captured instead of brought to trial.&lt;ref&gt;"The Junta orders to shoot don Santiago de Liniers, don Juan Gutiérrez de la Concha, the bishop of Córdoba, don Joaquín Rodríguez, colonel Allende and royal officer don Joaquín Moreno. At the right moment in which they are captured, under whatever circumstances, this resolution will be executed..." (Mariano Moreno, July 28, 1810) – Galasso, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; The Junta accepted the new proposal and delivered it to Ocampo.

The counter-revolution was defeated the following August, but Ocampo did not execute his prisoners. [[Gregorio Funes]], head of the patriotic party of Córdoba, persuaded him to spare them because the prisoners were popular in Córdoba and the people would not support their deaths.&lt;ref&gt;"Most of this city would be shrouded in mourning, and they [would assume that the Junta] is dominated by force and not by love, which is the most secure base to strengthen the new system of government." (Ortiz de Ocampo) – Galasso, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Besides Liniers, the prisoners included the governor of Córdoba and the bishop of the city. Ocampo stuck to the initial orders and delivered the prisoners to the city. Moreno did not accept it and told Ocampo that a general should simply obey orders.&lt;ref&gt;"Obedience is the first virtue of a general, and the best lesson he may give to his army, which must be demanded during a combat. The superior government gathers and concentrates relations that must not be communicated, and soldiers must not know them in order to obey what is commanded to them." (Mariano Moreno) – Galasso, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; He called a new meeting of the Junta, and produced a paper left at his home which said, "If Liniers does not die, LET HIM LIVE!"&lt;ref&gt;Galasso, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; (note: the second part was written in capital letters in the original). The Junta agreed to fire Ocampo and replace him with Castelli,&lt;ref&gt;"Go you, Castelli, and I hope that you do not fail in the same weakness than our general. If the determination was not yet done, the vocal Larrea would go, whom I think is not lacking resolution, and finally I would go myself if needed." (Mariano Moreno) – Chávez, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Nicolás Rodríguez Peña]] as secretary and [[Domingo French]] leading the escort. They intercepted the convoy at [[Cabeza de Tigre]] and executed them, except for Bishop Orellana, because of his religious endowment. The Auxiliary Army, commanded by Ocampo and Castelli, was renamed as the [[Army of the North]] and launched the [[First Alto Perú campaign]]. Moreno gave  harsh new instructions for it; namely:
* monitor the activities of the rich;
* kill Goyeneche, Nieto, Paula Sanz and the bishop on sight; and
* allow soldiers to pillage the enemies at the first patriot victory, to generate terror.&lt;ref&gt;Galasso, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

The context was not favorable: only Cochabamba and Charcas made a genuine support of the revolution, and some indigenous people hesitated in joining, fearing the consequences of a possible royalist counter-attack.&lt;ref&gt;Galasso, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; The Morenist projects for Upper Peru, which included the emancipation of the indigenous peoples and the nationalization of the mines of Potosi, were resisted by the local populations that were benefiting from the system already in force.&lt;ref&gt;Galasso, pp. 77–80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chávez, p. 274&lt;/ref&gt; Castelli proposed to advance the military campaign even closer to [[Lima]], but Moreno asked him to stay at his position.&lt;ref&gt;Galasso, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

====Second Expedition====
The other military expedition moved to [[Paraguay campaign|Paraguay]], commanded by [[Manuel Belgrano]]. Following instructions from Moreno, he helped the natives at the missions in [[Corrientes]], on his way to Paraguay. He gave them full civil and political rights, granted lands, authorized commerce with the United Provinces, removed taxes for ten years, abolished any type of torture, and lifted restrictions on taking public or religious office.&lt;ref&gt;Galasso, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreno promoted stronger measures against the royalists. In July, he gave orders to the neighboring mayors to prevent the creation of secret groups, or activities that could promote alienation.&lt;ref&gt;"Take care against the creation of suspicious groups, nor the proclamation of rumors that may promote alienation or distrust of the government." (Mariano Moreno) – Galasso, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; He promoted a new decree of the Junta that called for trial and confiscation of goods for anyone that left the city without authorization,&lt;ref&gt;"Any individual that leaves the city without government licence, will have his goods confiscated, without any other process needed than the confirmation of his departure." (Primera Junta Decree, art. 1, July 31, 1810) – Galasso, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; kept military weapons in secret,&lt;ref&gt;"Any person found with Royal weapons against the orders of releasing them, will be punished with any kind of punishment, not excepting even the capital one according to circumstances." (Primera Junta Decree, art. 3, July 31, 1810) – Galasso, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; promoted popular alienation or discontent against the government,&lt;ref&gt;"Anyone who promotes rumors against Europeans or Patriots promoting division will be punished according to the sedition laws." (Primera Junta Decree, art. 4, July 31, 1810) – Galasso, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; or wrote letters to people in other cities for such a purpose.&lt;ref&gt;"Anyone found corresponding with individuals from other places promoting divisions, distrust or parties against the current government, will be shot without any other process than the confirmation of the fact." (Primera Junta Decree, art. 5, July 31, 1810) – Galasso, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Serious cases were usually punished with execution or exile. Some rich people exiled by this decree were Francisco Beláustegui, Olaguer Reynals, Norberto de Quirno y Echeandía, and Pablo Villariño.&lt;ref&gt;Galasso, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; Manuel Andrés Arroyo y Pinedo, another rich man, blamed Moreno for these actions, accusing him of equaling disagreement with anti-patriotism, and felt that the ideas of egalitarianism would only cause great evils.&lt;ref&gt;"Moreno had cunning and ambition, he was unruly by nature. He invented the spartan ostracism against the Spanish Europeans, and politically against the Americans as well, which was the most secure way to hallucinate the peoples and have a party: anyone who does not follow his ideas will be reputed as antipatriot and it will be of public knowledge in his clubs. [...] But according to Moreno we are all equals now, maxim that being thus generalized has made so much evils, and there will be further sufferings by this cursed disorder." (Manuel Andrés Arroyo y Pinedo) – Galasso, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; Those measures were also criticized by moderate supporters of the revolution, such as [[Gregorio Funes]] from Córdoba, who rejected the lack of proper trials,&lt;ref&gt;"...he (Moreno) pointed the most respectable heads to die without any type of process." (Gregorio Funes, "Manifest about the events of April 5 and 6, 1811) – Carlos Ibarguren, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Dámaso Uriburu]], from Salta, who compared Moreno, Castelli, and Vieytes with the French [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"Moreno, Castelli and Vieytes, inside the government Junta, were the representatives of the doctrine of that political sect that intended, as an example of its model, regenerate the political and social order of those countries through blood and crime." (Dámaso Uriburu) – Galasso, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

By this time, Moreno thought that the only way to secure the Revolution would be if it was successful throughout the continent.&lt;ref&gt;"We must secure the continental system of our glorious insurrection. Never before had the South America a better chance to establish a republic." (Mariano Moreno, "Escritos políticos y económicos") – Galasso, pp. 56–57&lt;/ref&gt; However, he considered that [[Latin American integration]] should be achieved peacefully among equals, and not as the result of a conquest campaign. He wrote at the ''Gazeta'' that "even as pure as our intentions may be, it would be dangerous if the freedom of America was just our own work. Such a circumstance could lead to a real despotism and the Peruvian peoples would not improve having porteño oppressors instead of European ones."&lt;ref name="Patria grande"&gt;Mariano Moreno, Gazeta de Buenos Ayres, November 22, 1810 – Galasso, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; He made positive comments about the rebellions at [[Cochabamba]] and [[Chile]].&lt;ref name="Patria grande"/&gt;

===Operations plan===
[[File:Plan de Operaciones.jpg|thumb|The first page of the [[Operations plan]]]]
{{main|Operations plan}}
Following a proposal of Manuel Belgrano, the Junta wrote a political platform setting broad goals and procedures to follow to achieve its objectives. The creation of this document, whose name is often summarized simply as the "[[Operations plan]]", was trusted to Mariano Moreno. There have been [[Operations plan#Controversy|disputes]] about the authenticity of this document. Some historians like [[Paul Groussac]] suspect that the document was a [[literary forgery]], prepared by a Spaniard at the Court of [[Portugal]] to discredit the Junta.&lt;ref&gt;Groussac, pp. 103–143&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of the truthfulness of the document like [[Norberto Piñeiro]], allege that the content would be consistent with government actions taken by the Primera Junta.&lt;ref&gt;Piñeiro, pp. 33–103&lt;/ref&gt;

The document states the need to defeat the royalist forces and therefore proposes many possible actions similar to those employed by Jacobins during the [[Reign of Terror]] of the [[French Revolution]]. It rejected the use of political moderation, considering that it would be dangerous during revolutionary times.&lt;ref&gt;"''Moderation out of time is no sanity, nor is a truth; on the contrary, it is a weakness to adopt a system whose circumstances do not require; never in any time of revolution was moderation or tolerance adopted by governors, the mere thought of a man who opposes the new system is a crime because of the influence and harm he may cause with his example, and punishment is unavoidable''" (Moreno) – Operations plan, p. 276&lt;/ref&gt; It compared the South American revolution, still in its early stages, with the French and [[American Revolution|North American]]&lt;ref&gt;"''My Nation, how many mutations you must suffer! Where are, noble and great Washington, the lessons of your politics? Where the laborious rules of the architecture of your great work? Your principles and your regime could be capable to guide us, giving us your lights, to fill the goals we have proposed to ourselves''" (Moreno) – Operations plan, pp. 273–274&lt;/ref&gt; ones, and even the revolution in Spain itself, pointing out that none of those relied solely upon conspiracies or secret meetings.&lt;ref&gt;"''Let's talk with frankness: so far we have only seen the speculation of conspiracies, and as such when we try to approach practical matters we are deterred. Well, no: these are not the lessons taught by the masters of the great revolutions; fix your view over the annals of the histories of the North, of France, etc; and even Spain itself, and you shall see the plots and political cunning, aiming only to get by that way the goals they had proposed themselves (Moreno) – Operations plan, pp. 281–282&lt;/ref&gt; The document proposes to favor [[Patriot (Spanish American Revolution)|patriots]] and fill the state offices with them.&lt;ref&gt;"''All true patriots, whose conduct is satisfactory and had given notable proof of it, if they made a crime which does not concern the system, they must receive consideration and kindness; in a word, during revolutionary times no crime shall be punished save for infidelity and rebellion''" (Moreno) – Operations plan, pp. 283–284&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peninsulars]], on the other hand, should be carefully monitored, and punished at the slightest proof of action against the Junta, and executed if they were rich or influential.&lt;ref&gt;"''With the seconds'' (N: the enemies of the government) ''at the slightest semiproof of deeds, words, etc. against the cause, they shall be punished with capital punishment, specially when they convene with the circumstances of being people of skill, wealthpersonality and some opinion, but when they do not convene in such a man, it may be possible to have consideration and moderate the punishment, but never having any trusting on them''" (Mariano Moreno) – Operations plan, pp. 284–285&lt;/ref&gt; For this end, the Junta would need to create an espionage network.&lt;ref&gt;"''The government must [...] keep some spies, not of the first or second skill level, but of a known loyalty to the cause, secretly instructed to sneak into the most dubious people, talk with them and manifesting themselves in an opposing manner to the real cause they defend, to discover thus the thoughts of our enemies or any plot they may try''" (Moreno) – Operations plan, p. 285&lt;/ref&gt; This policy towards peninsulars is coherent with the actions taken against the [[Liniers counter-revolution|Liniers Counter-revolution]] and similar to the one employed by [[Simón Bolívar]] in the North shortly after. Moreno thought that [[José Gervasio Artigas]] would be an invaluable ally and that Buenos Aires should use any resource at its disposal to have him join the fight against absolutism.&lt;ref&gt;"''...it would be advisable to draw two men by any interest or promise, because of their knowledge, which we know is great in the countryside, as for their skill, opinion, concept and respect, as it is the captain of dragoons don José Rondeau and the captain of blandengues don José Artigas''" (Moreno) – Operations plan, pp. 294–295&lt;/ref&gt; He noted the internal conflicts in Chile and Paraguay and urged support of local patriots against local royalists.

On the level of international relations, Mariano Moreno rejected [[slavery in Brazil]], a neighboring Portuguese colony. He proposed to distribute large numbers of ''[[Gazeta de Buenos Ayres]]'' newspapers, filled with libertarian ideas and translated into Portuguese,&lt;ref&gt;"''...they must receive issues of Gazetas from the Capital and Montevideo, as often as possible, with speeches about the rights of men, [...] the happiness, freedom, equality and benevolence of the new system, [...] insulting in turn the old despots''" (Moreno) – Operations plan, p. 325&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"''Those speeches and Gazetas must be printed and delivered in Portuguese...''" (Moreno) – Operations plan, p. 326&lt;/ref&gt; and provide military support to the slaves if they should riot. He considered the risk of a complete Spanish defeat in the [[Peninsular War]] or a restoration of absolutism great menaces and regarded Britain as a potential ally against them.&lt;ref&gt;"''...we must not stop assisting them [Britain] with as many interests as needed, to persuade them to support our projects, always considering proposals that may benefit the [...] as we know about that nation, first, to be the most plotting for their supremacy in the seas, and second, that all their relation are always directed by the principle of expanding their merchant goals, whose ambition never allowed to conceal, and those principles must guide our enterprises for their success in that court''" (Moreno) – Operations plan, pp. 320–321&lt;/ref&gt; During a conflict, Britain would be able to provide them with weapons and other goods not produced locally. Critics of Moreno consider him an [[Anglophile]] because of this proposal, but the same document also warns against the risk of allowing Britain too much influence in the national economy. He criticized the relationship between Britain and Portugal, considering that Portugal was subject to a "shameful slavery" to Britain&lt;ref&gt;"''...as long as their alliance with her stands,'' [the British-Portuguese alliance] ''or better said, the shameful and ignominious slavery in which they had her...'' (Moreno) – Operations plan, p. 321&lt;/ref&gt; and that British influence in Brazil was so high that the Portuguese colonies might eventually become British ones.&lt;ref&gt;"''...it is clearly seen that her purpose is to suck the blood of their state, extenuating it so much that perhaps their American colonies may become British someday...''" (Moreno) – Operations plan, p. 322&lt;/ref&gt; Moreno held the same ideas about being simultaneously friendly and cautious with Britain in the pages of the ''Gazeta'' newspaper.

In the economic field, the document addressed the lack of a [[bourgeoisie]] that could turn the political changes into economic development and proposed to overcome this lack with strong state interventionism. Mariano Moreno proposed that the state invest 200 or 300 million in factories, manufacturing, arts, agriculture, navigation, and other critical areas.&lt;ref&gt;"''It shall be seen that a number of two or three hundred million pesos, given to the state to promote the arts, agriculture, navigation, etc. will produce in few years a working, educated and virtuous continent''" (Moreno) – Operations plan, p. 314&lt;/ref&gt; There would be no risk of bankruptcy because the state would manage the businesses.&lt;ref&gt;"''...they may be in risk of bankruptcy, which when managed by the state itself are in little risk...''" (Moreno) – Operations plan, p. 314&lt;/ref&gt; With the money generated, the state would then seek seeds and tools and ultimately allow the continent to be economically [[Autarky|autarchic]]. The initial money that the state would need to become such an active economic force would come from the mines in Potosi, where the slavers had nearly 500 or 600 million. Moreno proposed simply to confiscate the money and [[Nationalization|nationalize]] the mines.&lt;ref&gt;"''...it shall be absolutely forbidden that any man works the mines of gold or silver, with the duty of working it and managing its resources reserved for the state, for more or less ten years...''" (Moreno) – Operations plan, p. 315&lt;/ref&gt; He reasoned that five or six thousand people would be harmed by such action, but eighty or a hundred thousand would benefit.&lt;ref&gt;"''I estimate that, even if in those vast provinces we must aggravate at least five or six thousands as the advantages are perceived by eighty or a hundred thousand people, nor the government should doubt, nor lost anything in public perception, when after achieving the desired purposes we reward those aggravated, with graces or privileges''" (Moreno) – Operations plan, p. 314&lt;/ref&gt; The state would not manage those areas indefinitely; Moreno proposed that this should be done only until there was a strong economic activity in each area, and then the state would just observe, making sure that they followed the laws enacted for the common good of society.

Early 19th-century liberalism did not promote confiscation among their common proposals, but an  antecedent of this proposal was the [[Conspiracy of the Equals]], promoted by [[François-Noël Babeuf]] during the French Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Galasso, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Moreno thought that state-sized fortunes managed by a few individuals were detrimental to civil society, and those individuals would tend to manage the economy for their own benefit, without fixing the problems of society at large.

The document proposed to avoid exporting money and to include high tariffs on the import of luxury goods. This is often seen as a contradiction of ''[[The Representation of the Hacendados]]'', but each request different things. The Representation opposed the absolute [[embargo|prohibition]] of trade with Britain, which is not the same than allowing it while following a [[protectionism|protectionist]] policy.&lt;ref&gt;Galasso, 39–41&lt;/ref&gt; As secretary, Moreno reduced the tariffs on national exports but kept high ones for imports.

===Internal disputes===
[[File:Cornelio Saavedra - 1810.jpg|thumb|[[Cornelio Saavedra]], president of the [[Primera Junta]]]]
Mariano Moreno and [[Cornelio Saavedra]] had disagreements about the events of the May Revolution and the way to run the government; their disputes became public shortly after the creation of the Junta. Saavedra was the president, and Moreno was a secretary with the support of other vocal members. [[Ignacio Núñez]] describes how Morenists felt that the President was attempting to restore in his office the authority of the viceroys, thus downgrading the importance of the other members of the Junta at public events; while Saavedrists considered that the Secretary was overstepping his authority and did not allow even the appointment of a janitor that was not of his liking.&lt;ref&gt;Núñez, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Domingo Matheu]] would clarify in his memoirs that their initial concerns with Saavedra were based more on his desire for honors and privileges than for a real power struggle.&lt;ref&gt;Galasso, pp. 12–13&lt;/ref&gt; Núñez described how Moreno was resisted by some criollos who initially supported the revolution without being aware of the long-term consequences. He was resisted by criollos alarmed by his straightforward way of talking about concepts like self-determination, tyranny, slavery, and freedom. Theologians resented that Moreno cited authors like Rousseau, Voltaire, or Montesquieu rather than Christian philosophers like Saint Augustine or Saint Thomas. He was also resisted by conservative lawyers and by most of the  military.&lt;ref&gt;Núñez, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

By October, Moreno's measures started to generate resistance among some who initially supported the May Revolution. Traders did not like the protectionist policy, and some members of the military had close ties with rich people and opposed their punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Galasso, pp. 66–67&lt;/ref&gt; On October 16 it was discovered that ten members of the Cabildo had sworn loyalty to the Regency Council the past July, and they were all jailed. This included [[Julián Leiva]] and [[Juan José de Lezica]].&lt;ref&gt;Galasso, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; Moreno and Saavedra had a dispute when the Junta was deciding what to do. Moreno proposed executing them as a deterrent, accusing them of working with the [[Montevideo Cabildo]], the enemy of the Junta.&lt;ref&gt;"It's needed to condemn Leiva and his henchmen, as example to the enemies of the country and our system" [...] "Do you (Saavedra) forget that Leiva is with the Montevideo Cabildo, and surely with the Regency Council to plot this reactionary coup?" (Moreno discussing with Saavedra) – Crónica Histórica Argentina, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; Saavedra replied that the government should promote leniency, and rejected the use of the Patricians Regiment to carry out such executions.&lt;ref&gt;"The proposal exceeds the sentiments of leniency that the government should promote. [...] If it's insisted to give death penalty, I deny right now the involvement of my troops to apply it!" (Moreno discussing with Saavedra) – Crónica Histórica Argentina, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; The prisoners were finally exiled to Luján, Ranchos, and Salto, and Leiva was housed by [[Gregorio Funes]] in Córdoba.&lt;ref&gt;Crónica Histórica Argentina, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;

By this point, the only military support for Moreno was Domingo French, head of "The Star" regiment. Castelli and Belgrano supported him but were far away from the capital on their respective military campaigns. The activists of the May Revolution supported him as well, as did other members of the Junta and other patriots like Vieytes and Nicolás Rodríguez Peña. Saavedra kept the strong support of the Regiment of Patricians and added that of the merchants and even some supporters of the former regime who deemed the moderated Saavedra a lesser evil.&lt;ref&gt;Galasso, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; Moreno sought to modify the military balance of power by reforming the promotion rules. Up until that point, the sons of officials were automatically granted the status of cadet and were promoted just by seniority; Moreno arranged that promotions were earned by military merits instead.&lt;ref&gt;"The son of a colonel has worn cords since the crib, and a soldier of seventy years old would lift a kid that he could never equal in honours and wages. This kid could be badly raised, without habits, without talents, but he would eventually become general... because with a long life, he would count many years and those would prepare a seniority that would open the door to promotions... The Junta will follow an entirely different conduct: it is convinced that it cannot be a good official who has never been a good soldier, and will never allow the scars of a brave to be dressed with tatters while the sad relics of a rotten soldier are concealed with galloons." (Primera Junta decree, September 19, 1810 – Galasso, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the short run, this measure worked against him, as it antagonized members of the military who got promoted precisely because of such rules.&lt;ref&gt;Galasso, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; He also thought that support from the lower classes was instrumental to the success of the Revolution,&lt;ref&gt;"Not only the peoples of the villages have displayed a patriotism that doesn't stop in personal sacrifices, but also the inhabitants of our countrysides with pure and simple offerings as their hearths display the most respectful kindness and acknowledgement when they talk about the Junta. From here springs the abundance of resources that multiply a thousands ways to fill our urgent tasks. This explains the fast marches of our troops, which in a single week cross spaces that the former viceroys could not defeat in a month and a half. The peoples from the countryside give their cattle without interest, give the soldiers their own personal horses, and save nothing to the little fortunes of their sons when it is requested for the nation and the government." (Mariano Moreno, Gazeta de Buenos Ayres, September 15, 1810) – Galasso, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote letters to Chiclana instructing him to generate such support at Upper Peru.&lt;ref&gt;"Don't neglect the levy of creoles and make them take a personal interest in this work. Let no one rule, save for the sons of the country, let them know the advantages." (Mariano Moreno, mail to Chiclana) – Justo, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; Such popular involvement would take time to consolidate: the [[Guerra Gaucha]], the [[War of the Republiquetas]], and the rise of [[José Gervasio Artigas]] took place later, not as of 1810.&lt;ref&gt;Galasso, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

Saavedra increased his resistance to Moreno's proposals after the victory at the [[Battle of Suipacha]], considering that the revolution had defeated its enemies and should relax its severity in consequence.&lt;ref&gt;"As all things have changed their circumstances, by the reunion of the provinces of the viceroyalty, thus it's also need to change the resolutions, this is, lower the rigors adopted so far." (Cornelio Saavedra) – Crónica histórica Argentina, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; The Regiment of Patricians hosted a banquet celebration at the barracks, restricting attendance to the military and supporters of Saavedra. Moreno was not allowed to pass by the guards at the door, which generated a small incident.&lt;ref&gt;Núñez, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; That same night, Officer [[Atanasio Duarte]], who was drunk, gave a crown of sugar to Saavedra's wife and saluted Saavedra as if he was the new king or emperor of the Americas.&lt;ref name="Ebrio"&gt;Núñez, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, when Moreno heard about the incident, he wrote the "[[Honours Suppression decree]]", which suppressed the ceremony usually reserved for the president of the Junta and inherited privileges of the office of viceroy.&lt;ref name="Ebrio"/&gt; Duarte was exiled, and Moreno's act was justified by stating that "An inhabitant of Buenos Aires neither drunk nor asleep should be expressed against the freedom of his country".&lt;ref&gt;(Primera Junta decree, December 6, 1810) – Galasso, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; Saavedra signed the decree without complaint, but Gregorio Funes felt that the Patricians resented Moreno because of this.&lt;ref&gt;"The body of Patricians took this as a personal offense, and was near a break of relations. This commotion has placated, but I believe it grows in secret. Saavedra is very cautious and will contain everything. I have been told that he questioned himself the officer of the brindis." (Gregorio Funes, mail to his brother, December 10, 1810) – Galasso, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Gregorio Funes.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gregorio Funes]], from Córdoba, joined Saavedra against Moreno.]]
The conflicts between Moreno and Saavedra generated international reactions. Lord Strangford complained about the later actions of the Junta, such as the execution of Liniers, which were seen as more violent than the initial ones.&lt;ref&gt;"The last procedures of the Junta in respect of Liniers and his companions are in little comformity with the spirit of moderation that enacted your first measures and have given, to those who had a good mood towards you, reasons to be against." (Lord Strangford, mail to Mariano Moreno, November 17, 1810) – Galasso, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil was also concerned because many copies of the ''Gazeta'' were being distributed in [[Rio Grande do Sul]], influencing their slaves with libertarian ideas.&lt;ref name="Brasil"&gt;Galasso, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Free Brazil"&gt;"Moreno is the Robespierre of the day and the other are null for good and fiery tools of the tirany. All of them pretend to establish a Republic.{{sic}} Among their favourite projects is the one to extend the revolution to Brazil." (Carlos Guezzi, memoirs) – Pueyrredón, p. 475&lt;/ref&gt; The Brazilian government sent [[Carlos José Guezzi]] to Buenos Aires, with the purpose of mediating in the conflict with the royalists at Montevideo and to ratify the [[Carlotism|aspirations]] of [[Carlota of Spain|Carlota Joaquina]] to rule as regent.&lt;ref name="Brasil"/&gt; He met Saavedra in his first interview, in July, and got a positive impression of him. Saavedra said that if Carlota's rights were confirmed by the Spanish monarchy, Buenos Aires would support her, even if it meant they had to  stand against the other provinces.&lt;ref&gt;"...Saavedra said then that there was no room for doubt, and even if the whole nation had another opinion, the peoples of Buenos Aires and the Junta would have been the first ones to offer their weapons for the conservation of her rights." (Carlos Guezzi, memoirs) – Pueyrredón, p. 469&lt;/ref&gt; The following month he requested a representative for the Court of Brazil, offered Carlota's mediation with Montevideo,&lt;ref&gt;"...recognize the eventual rights of the princess or allow the mediation of Brazil to solve the differences in the viceroyalty." (Carlos Guezzi, memoirs) – Pueyrredón, p. 469&lt;/ref&gt; and pointed out that Brazil had forces near the frontier, awaiting orders to attack the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;"The divisions of the provinces and the differences of opinion worry the Court of Brazil, who has all forces ready to extinguish or contain any revolutionary movement that may manifest at the La Plata basin." (Carlos Guezzi, memoirs) – Pueyrredón, p. 470&lt;/ref&gt; This time, Moreno resisted. Moreno rejected sending a representative&lt;ref&gt;"The Junta does not consider convenient to send a representative to the Court of Brazil. She must be declared satisfied with the token of confidence given when they received the mails from the Marquis of the Irujo house destined to viceroy Cisneros." (Mariano Moreno, Carlos Guezzi memoirs) – Pueyrredón, p. 471&lt;/ref&gt; and told him that the Junta did not work for the interests of Brazil, but for those of the United Provinces.&lt;ref&gt;"The Junta does not work for the interests of Brazil, but for those of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata." (Mariano Moreno, Carlos Guezzi memoirs) – Pueyrredón, p. 471&lt;/ref&gt; He rejected the mediation as well, considering that no mediation was possible under a military threat.&lt;ref&gt;"The Court of Brazil may want to employ the force, and by that way mediation is inadmissible." (Mariano Moreno, Carlos Guezzi memoirs) – Pueyrredón, p. 471&lt;/ref&gt; Guezzi was immediately sent back to Rio de Janeiro on the first available ship.&lt;ref&gt;"The excellency Provisional Government Junta of the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata has decidedly resolved that you (Guezzi) in the first ship that sails to Río de Janeiro, return to that destiny; for this purpose, at this same date, there's an order for the captain of the port to see for the commitment of this rule and report so for the intelligence." (Carlos Guezzi, memoirs) – Pueyrredón, p. 472&lt;/ref&gt; He described Moreno as "the Robespierre of the day",&lt;ref name="Free Brazil"/&gt; and accused the Junta of attempting to build a [[republic]].&lt;ref name="Free Brazil"/&gt;

In December, the deputies of the other provinces convened by the circular of May 27 arrived in Buenos Aires. Most of them were closer to the ideas of Saavedra, and [[Gregorio Funes]] became highly influential over them. They did not agree about which body they should join: the deputies wanted to join the Junta, while Moreno thought that they should start a [[constituent assembly]]. Funes, allied with Saavedra, calculated that they could stop Moreno by joining the Junta, as his proposals would be agreed to by a minority. The Junta, with both its original members and the deputies, discussed the topic on December 18. Funes said that Buenos Aires had no right to rule the other provinces without their consent, and got the support of the other members.&lt;ref name="Funes"&gt;Galasso, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; He said that there was popular discontent with the Junta.&lt;ref name="Funes"/&gt; The supporters of Moreno said that such discontent was only among some rebels,&lt;ref name="Funes"/&gt; and Moreno said that it was only the discontent of the Patricians in respect of the Suppressions decree.&lt;ref name="Funes"/&gt; However, only Paso voted with him, and the deputies joined the Junta. Moreno resigned, but his resignation was rejected. His opposition to the incorporation of the deputies is seen by some historians as an initial step in the conflict between Buenos Aires and the other provinces, which dominated politics in Argentina during the following decades. Some call it a precursor of the [[Unitarian Party]], while others find his words or actions more consistent with the [[Federalist Party (Argentina)|Federalist Party]]. However, historians [[Paul Groussac]] and [[Norberto Piñeiro]] feel it is inappropriate to extrapolate so far into the future. Piñeiro considered it an error to label Moreno as federal or unitary, proving that this organization been prioritized over the secondary aspect of centralism or federalism, while Groussac similarly notes that Moreno devoted all his energies to the immediate problem of achieving independence without giving much thought to possible long-term scenarios.

==Political decline and death==
[[File:Muerte de Mariano Moreno.jpg|thumb|Death of Mariano Moreno.]]
[[Hipólito Vieytes]] was about to make a diplomatic mission to Britain, but Moreno requested that he should be given the appointment instead. Saavedra accepted immediately. He traveled to Britain with his brother [[Manuel Moreno]] and his secretary [[Tomás Guido]], on the British [[schooner]] ''Fame''. His health declined and there was no doctor on board, but the captain refused requests to land at some earlier port such as in Río de Janeiro (Brazil) or [[Cape Town]] (South Africa). The captain gave him an [[emetic]] in common use at that time, prepared with four grams of [[Tartaric acid|antimony potassium tartrate]]. Moreno had great convulsions as a consequence and considered that in his state he could not have resisted more than the quarter of a gram. He died shortly afterward.&lt;ref&gt;Scenna, p. 97-98&lt;/ref&gt; His body was wrapped in a [[Union Jack]] and thrown into the sea, after a volley of musketry.

Manuel Moreno speculated later that he was poisoned by the captain. Manuel Moreno was unsure of whether the captain really gave him that substance, or if he substituted something else, or gave an even higher dose. Circumstances did not allow an autopsy to be performed. Further points used to sustain the idea of a murder are the captain's refusal to land elsewhere, his slow sailing, his administration of the emetic in secrecy, and that he didn't return to Buenos Aires with the ship.&lt;ref&gt;Scenna, pp. 98–99&lt;/ref&gt; [[Enrique de Gandía]] pointed to an irregular ruling of the Junta that appointed a British person named Curtis as Moreno's replacement for the diplomatic mission in the case of Moreno's death. The son of Mariano Moreno commented to the historian [[Adolfo Saldías]] that his mother, Guadalupe Cuenca, received an anonymous gift of a mourning hand fan and handkerchief, with instructions to use them soon. By that time, the murder of Moreno was a common assumption, and it was mentioned during the [[trial of residence]] of the members of the Junta. Juan Madera stated at the trial that Moreno may have requested to go to Britain because he was afraid of being murdered and that he may have stated this during the meeting when the Junta discussed his resignation.&lt;ref&gt;Scenna, pp. 99–100&lt;/ref&gt; Modern author [[Manuel Luis Martín]] studied the health of both Moreno and his family and concluded that he died of natural causes.&lt;ref&gt;National... p. 348&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Despite the death of Mariano Moreno, his supporters were still an influential party in Buenos Aires. Morenists accused Saavedra and Funes of plotting to allow the coronation of Carlota and organized a rebellion with "The Star" Regiment. However, the Saavedrists became aware of it and organized another [[Rebellion of 5 and 6 April|rebellion]] on May 5 and 6, 1811. This rebellion requested strong changes in the government: the removal of Morenists Nicolás Rodríguez Peña, Hipólito Vieytes, Miguel Azcuénaga, and Juan Larrea from the Junta; the exile of Domingo French, Antonio Beruti, Agustín Donado, Gervasio Posadas and Ramón Vieytes; and the return and trial of Manuel Belgrano. Thus, the Morenist party was set apart from the government.&lt;ref&gt;Galasso, p. 124-131&lt;/ref&gt;

The Saavedrist hegemony was short-lived. The military defeats of Castelli and Belgrano started a new political crisis, and the [[First Triumvirate (Argentina)|First Triumvirate]] replaced the [[Junta Grande]] as the executive power, and then closed it completely. The former supporters of Moreno (Belgrano, Dupuy, Tomás Guido, Beruti, Monteagudo, French, Vicente López) would later support the campaign of [[José de San Martín]].&lt;ref&gt;Galasso, p. 136-137&lt;/ref&gt; The Argentine war of independence would give room to the [[Argentine Civil War]] between [[Unitarian Party|unitarians]] and [[Federales (Argentina)|federals]]. Saavedrists like Martín Rodríguez, Ortiz de Ocampo, de la Cruz—and even Saavedra himself—became unitarians.&lt;ref&gt;Ferla, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; Manuel Moreno, French, Agrelo, Vicente López, and Pancho Planes opposed both the First Triumvirate and the presidency of unitarian [[Bernardino Rivadavia]].&lt;ref&gt;Galasso, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; Manuel Moreno and Tomás Guido, in particular, worked in the government of the most powerful federal leader, [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]].

===Historical perspectives===
[[File:Discusion sobre Moreno.jpg|thumb|Argentine historian [[Ricardo Levene]] during a conference about Mariano Moreno.]]
Early Argentine historians described Mariano Moreno as the leader of the Revolution and a [[Great Man theory|great historical man]]. Later liberal historians would embellish this portrayal even more. An example of this tendency is ''[[La Revolución de Mayo y Mariano Moreno]]'' by [[Ricardo Levene]].&lt;ref name="seis"&gt;Scenna, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Biographers would describe him as a serene statesman, a notable economist, a decided democrat, and a great leader.&lt;ref name="seis"/&gt; For those historians, Moreno would have been an Anglophile, and "The Representation of the Hacendados", the government platform of the May Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Scenna, pp. 27–28&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, revisionist authors would formulate accusations against him, while promoting  Saavedra as a popular leader. According to those authors, Moreno was a British agent, a demagogic ''[[caudillo]]'', a paranoid, a mere man of theoretical ideas applying European principles that failed in the local context, wrongly portrayed as the leader of the Revolution by the liberal historiography.&lt;ref&gt;Scenna, pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Año X]]'' by [[Hugo Wast]] is considered the harshest work against Moreno. Moreno was still considered an Anglophile but in a negative light. They blamed Moreno for the harsh policies of the Junta, considering him a terrorist&lt;ref&gt;Scenna, pp. 74–75&lt;/ref&gt; or a predecessor of [[Marxism]]; liberal historians usually concealed these policies.&lt;ref&gt;Scenna, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern authors like [[Ernesto Palacio (writer)|Ernesto Palacio]], [[Norberto Galasso]], and [[Jorge Abelardo Ramos]] attempt to rescue the image of Moreno by avoiding both extremes: the sweet liberal Moreno and the horrible one written by revisionists.&lt;ref&gt;Scenna, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Those historians do not consider [[Bernardino Rivadavia]] a successor of Moreno, and the proposals to seek an alliance with Britain are not seen as the product of Anglophilia, but just an example of the limited options available to the Primera Junta.&lt;ref&gt;Scenna, pp. 69–74&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, they do not attribute much influence to the ''Representation...'', considering it a mere work for a client&lt;ref&gt;Scenna, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; that didn't really influence Cisneros, who would have allowed free trade for international contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Scenna, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; The harsh policies are acknowledged, but not attributed specifically to Moreno, but rather to the whole Junta, and compared with similar royalist measures used to punish the [[Chuquisaca Revolution|Chuquisaca]], the [[La Paz revolution]], and the indigenous [[rebellion of Túpac Amaru II]].&lt;ref&gt;Scenna, pp. 75–79&lt;/ref&gt;

===Journalism===
Mariano Moreno is regarded as the first Argentine journalist, as he created the ''[[Gazeta de Buenos Ayres]]''. June 7, the day this newspaper was first available to the public, is recognized in Argentina as "Journalist's Day" since 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.me.gov.ar/efeme/7dejunio/ |title=Día del Periodista |trans-title=Journalist Day |language=es |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413022609/http://www.me.gov.ar/efeme/7dejunio/ |archive-date=April 13, 2016 |website=Efemérides Culturales Argentinas |publisher=Argentina Ministry of Education |access-date=June 5, 2018 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Gazeta'', however, was not the first newspaper in Buenos Aires, but the first one since the May Revolution. The first newspaper was the ''[[Telégrafo Mercantil]]'' (1801), followed by the ''[[Semanario de Agricultura Industria y Comercio]]'' (1802) and the ''[[Correo de Comercio de Buenos Aires]]'' (1810), edited during the colonial period.

Moreno was the only one to sign the decree that established the newspaper, but the text implies that it was the result of a discussion of the whole Junta, and not just his initiative.&lt;ref&gt;Scenna, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; A fellow member of the Junta, [[Manuel Alberti]], was appointed as the director of the newspaper. However, Alberti never actually directed the newspaper; Moreno did. Historian [[Guillermo Furlong]] considers that it was really Alberti who directed the newspaper, but the memoirs of José Pedro Agrelo (a later director), Tomás Guido, and Saavedra confirm that the newspaper was managed by Moreno.&lt;ref&gt;Scenna, pp. 54–55&lt;/ref&gt; Moreno has also been promoted as a supporter of the [[freedom of the press]], but the ''Gazeta...'' was actually a state-sponsored newspaper, and the Junta allowed such freedom only for information that was not against the interests of the government. According to [[Norberto Galasso]], that situation would today be  considered [[media bias]].&lt;ref&gt;Scenna, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:María Guadalupe Cuenca.jpg|thumb|María Guadalupe Cuenca, wife of Mariano Moreno]]
The Moreno family was poor but could afford a house and some slaves. Ana María Valle y Ramos, Mariano's mother, was one of the few literate women in Buenos Aires.&lt;ref&gt;Wiñaski, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Mariano Moreno was the firstborn of fourteen children. Mariano moved to Chuquisaca with his brother [[Manuel Moreno]] and their friend [[Tomás Guido]] once the family raised the money.&lt;ref&gt;Lagleyze, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The long and difficult journey gave Mariano a rheumatism attack; he had to stay in bed for fifteen days on arrival. He had further attacks years later.&lt;ref&gt;Lagleyze, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Moreno met María Guadalupe Cuenca in this city, after seeing a miniature portrait of her at a silversmith's house. Both Moreno and María were expected by their families to follow religious studies, and Moreno's father did not authorize a change. Moreno studied laws all the same and married María in secret to avoid family resistance. They had a single son, named Mariano like the father.&lt;ref&gt;Lagleyze, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

When Moreno left for Europe on a diplomatic mission in 1811, his wife and son stayed in Buenos Aires. María wrote many letters to Moreno, with descriptions of ongoing events in the city. Most of them were written when Moreno was already dead; she did not learn of his fate until the following August when a letter arrived from Manuel Moreno. She requested a [[widow's pension]] from the [[First Triumvirate (Argentina)|First Triumvirate]], which was in power by then; its value was thirty pesos.&lt;ref&gt;Pigna, pp. 338–341&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beliefs===
Mariano Moreno studied French and Spanish authors of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] during his studies at Chuquisaca. [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s ''[[The Social Contract]]'' was the main influence; he translated this work into Spanish and used it to justify the actions of the Primera Junta. Contemporary people as [[Ignacio Núñez]] and [[Tomás de Anchorena]] acknowledged him as the translator. However, as the main page said that the work was "reprinted in Buenos Ayres", some historians doubt whether it was actually Moreno's work. [[Vicente Fidel López]] claimed that Moreno reprinted the translation made by the Spaniard [[Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos]], but the two translations differ.&lt;ref&gt;Scenna, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Groussac]] thought it was a reprint of an Asturian translation, and [[Ricardo Levene]] said that Moreno was not the translator, but neither gave any indication as to who they thought had completed it.&lt;ref&gt;Scenna, pp. 57–58&lt;/ref&gt; [[Enrique de Gandía]] considers that the comments of contemporary people and the lack of an earlier similar translation of Rousseau's work allow us to conclude that Moreno must have been the translator, at least until an earlier translation is found.&lt;ref&gt;Scenna, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his interest in French authors, Mariano Moreno was not [[Francophile]] or [[afrancesado]]. He kept a strong Spanish cultural heritage, and both Levene and Abelardo Ramos agree that his stay in Chuquisaca influenced him more than the books. In line with the [[Enlightenment in Spain|Spanish Enlightenment]], Moreno kept strong religious beliefs. He removed the chapter from Rousseau's work that is critical of religion, and never became a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]].&lt;ref name="Religion"&gt;Scenna, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; He gave up his religious studies to study law and get married, but never actually became a priest, so there was no defrocking. He studied with priests such as Terrazas, who approved and perhaps even encouraged the change of vocation.&lt;ref name="Religion"/&gt;

===Physical aspect===
[[File:Mariano Moreno.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Moreno made by painter [[Juan de Dios Rivera]]. It is thought to be a realistic representation.]]
The canonical image of Mariano Moreno is the one from the portrait ''[[Mariano Moreno en su mesa de trabajo]]'' ({{lang-es|Mariano Moreno at his work desk}}). It was done by the Chilean artist [[Pedro Subercaseaux]] during the [[Argentina Centennial|centennial of the May Revolution]] in 1910. The historian [[Adolfo Carranza]] asked him to design various allegorical pictures of the event. Carranza belonged to the mainstream line of historians who professed great admiration for Moreno, who he described as follows: "He was the soul of the government of the revolution of May, his nerve, the distinguished statesman of the group managing the ship attacked the absolutism and doubt, anxious to reach the goal of his aspirations and his destiny. Moreno was the compass and that also grabbed the helm, as he was the strongest and the ablest of those who came to direct it". He asked for a picture that was consistent with this image. The portrait depicts him as a friendly man with an open and round face, a wide forehead, and a serene look. Subsequent interpretations, like those of [[Antonio Estrada]], would follow this style, as would portraits of other members of the Junta. However, as this portrait was made a hundred years after the death of the subject, with no known depictions done during his lifetime, it was thus based on the artist's imagination. It was known that Moreno had clearly visible [[smallpox]] scars from the age of eight, but not to the point where they disfigured his face.&lt;ref&gt;Scenna, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

Later a portrait of Moreno was discovered that had been done from life, by the Peruvian silversmith [[Juan de Dios Rivera]]. This portrait was painted between 1808 or 1809, before Moreno's appointment as secretary of the Junta. It is now considered to be the closest representation of Moreno's real appearance. In this portrait, he is depicted with an elongated face, abundant hair, long sideburns, big eyes, and a pointy nose.&lt;ref&gt;Scenna, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7211">'''Mary Clarke Nind''' (1825–1905), known as "Our Little Bishop", was a philanthropist and worker for social justice. It was during her time living in [[Minnesota]] that she fulfilled her calling into missionary work.
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:mary_clarke_nind.jpg|right|Wikipedia Encyclopedia]] --&gt;
==Biography==
Mary Clarke was born in [[Essex]], [[England]], the daughter of Ebenezer and Louisa Clarke. ''"I was born six miles from London, England, the child of pious parents, who led their six children to the Savior, converted before five years of age. The memory of my conversion is still fresh and delightful."''

She was teaching in the Sabbath school by the age of 12 and at the age of 14 she was united with a Congregational Church. In 1850 she came to the United States, the bride of James G. Nind; and they established their home in St. Charles, Illinois. They had five children, losing one at the age of 3. Two of her daughters later became missionaries, one going to [[Foochow]] and the other to [[Madeira Islands]].

===Career===
Yet, in her spiritual life, Mary was tormented. She could see others much older than she was struggling to achieve a life of salvation. ''"Must I go on to thirty, forty, fifty, sixty years, and still have to fight against my easily besetting sins, and every now and then be conquered? Is there no hope of victory all the time?"''

It was not until she was introduced to the [[Methodist movement]] that she began to move "into the light." A pastor of her Congregational Church aligned with the Methodist movement and began to teach about sanctifying grace. When the pastor was dismissed from the Congregational Church, about 40 members moved to the Free Methodist Church. Mary occasionally went to the Methodist meetings and as a result was more than once disciplined and charged with "schism" – holding Methodist doctrines in a Congregational Church. Mary was tormented over her devotion to the Congregational Church and her desire to reach a "higher life" through sanctification. One day after church, she encountered a woman who had lived through many afflictions and Mary opened up to her about her torment. She replied, "Mrs. Nind, we shall all miss you if you decide to leave the Congregational Church; but if I were you I would go into the Methodist Church. You will be more happy and more useful there, for there is more liberty for women to exercise their gifts." Taking this as a sign from God, she abruptly left the Congregational Church and joined the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]].

''"I raised a new Ebenezer of gratitude, 'for hitherto the Lord had helped me.' Anew I consecrated myself to the Lord and His service, and with new consecrations came new joy."'' Mary wrote the story of her spiritual struggle and final victory in a leaflet titled "Into the Light." The leaflet was widely used during the Civil War as a source of inspiration.

=== Woman's Foreign Ministry Society ===
In 1866, Mary and her husband moved to [[Winona, Minnesota]]. Her eagerness to "win souls for Christ" led her into evangelistic work. On April 4, 1870, the Western branch of the [[Woman's Foreign Missionary Society]] (WFMS) was formed; and Mary was the first to enlist for work. The WFMS is one of the forerunners of the United Methodist Women. In 18 years during the 1870s and 1880s, Mary raised $17.5&amp;nbsp;million for the WFMS on "two cents and a prayer a day" from the women of the Methodist Church.

She traveled the nation, China, Tibet, India, Japan, Africa, and South America bearing messages of salvation and became known worldwide as an evangelist. She also became known as "Mother" Nind in the WFMS. In Methodist circles, she was also known as "Our Little Bishop." As a result of her missionary work, Mary is considered by some to be one of the top women of influence in the Methodist Church along with [[Susanna Wesley]] and Barbara Heck. 

In 1878, her son moved to Minneapolis, and to be closer to him, Mary also moved. She became a member of Centenary M. E. Church. The leaders of the WFMS led by Mrs. Franc Elliott in Nebraska, set forth a cause to have women elected as representatives to the male-dominated General Conference and the Minnesota Lay Conference and five other conferences responded to the call. At the Minnesota Lay Conference of 1887, which met at Centenary Church, elected Mary as one of the representatives, even though she was not in attendance. She was one of five women nationally who presented credentials at the 1888 General Conference. The others were [[Frances E. Willard]], Amanda C. Rippey, Angie F. Newman and Elizabeth D. Van Kirk.  

After the conference was assembled, a committee on eligibility was formed to consider the question. The committee reported to the General Conference and the matter was debated over the course of 5&amp;nbsp;days before the women were denied their seats. Mary observed the entire proceedings from the balcony.  It would not be until 1904 that women were given laity rights and admitted as delegates to the General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church (1922 for the [[Methodist Episcopal Church, South|M.E. Church, South]]).

At the close of the General Conference, discouraged, Mary went to London and attended the World's Missionary Conference. After that she traveled around the world, visiting the chief mission stations. When she returned she moved to [[Detroit]] in about 1891 or 1892. It's not clear that she ever saw the completion of Wesley Church before moving.

===Death and afterward===
In September 1905, she traveled to Massachusetts where she had a son living in Boston. On September 1, 1905, "Mother" Nind was at a missionary day celebration in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]]. There she was afforded a place of honor. She conducted the opening services with a Bible reading on the resurrection of Jesus and offered a prayer "of marvelous beauty and devotion, which seemed to our informant to indicate 'a wonderful spirituality and nearness of approach to God.'" The next day she was visiting friends in [[Littleton, Massachusetts]]. Mary retired for the evening in an upper bedroom of the home. Shortly after, a fire started in the house, which rapidly filled with smoke. Mary died just a few Months from her 80th birthday.

'''Middle cerebral artery syndrome''' is a condition whereby the blood supply from the [[middle cerebral artery]] (MCA) is restricted, leading to a reduction of the function of the portions of the [[brain]] supplied by that vessel: the lateral aspects of frontal, temporal and parietal lobes, the [[corona radiata]], [[globus pallidus]], [[caudate nucleus|caudate]] and [[putamen]]. The MCA is the most common site for the occurrence of ischemic [[stroke]].&lt;ref name= "O'Sullivan" /&gt;

Depending upon the location and severity of the occlusion, signs and symptoms may vary within the population affected with MCA syndrome. More distal blockages tend to produce milder deficits due to more extensive branching of the artery and less ischemic response. In contrast, the most proximal occlusions result in widespread effects that can lead to significant [[cerebral edema]], increased [[intracranial pressure]], loss of consciousness and could even be fatal.&lt;ref name= "O'Sullivan" /&gt; In such occasions, mannitol (osmotic diuretic) or hypertonic saline are given to draw fluid out of the edematous cerebrum to minimise secondary injury. Hypertonic saline is better than mannitol, as mannitol being a diuretic will decrease the mean arterial pressure and since cerebral perfusion is mean arterial pressure minus intracranial pressure, mannitol will also cause a decrease in cerebral perfusion.

Contralateral [[hemiparesis]] and hemisensory loss of the face, upper and lower extremities is the most common presentation of MCA syndrome.&lt;ref name= "O'Sullivan" /&gt; Lower extremity function is more spared than that of the faciobrachial region.&lt;ref name= "strokecenter1" /&gt; The majority of the primary motor and somatosensory cortices are supplied by the MCA and the [[cortical homunculus]] can, therefore, be used to localize the defects more precisely. Middle cerebral artery lesions mostly affect the dominant hemisphere i.e. the left cerebral hemisphere.

==Signs and Symptoms==
* [[Hemiparesis]] or [[hemiplegia]] of the lower half of the contralateral face&lt;ref name= "strokecenter1" /&gt;
* [[Hemiparesis]] or [[hemiplegia]] of the contralateral upper and lower extremities*&lt;ref name= "strokecenter1" /&gt;
* Sensory loss of the contralateral face, arm and leg*&lt;ref name= "strokecenter1" /&gt;
* [[Ataxia]] of contralateral extremities*&lt;ref name= "O'Sullivan" /&gt;
* Speech impairments/[[aphasia]]: [[Broca's area]], [[Receptive aphasia|Wernicke's]] or [[Global aphasia]] as a result of a dominant hemisphere lesion (usually the left brain)&lt;ref name= "O'Sullivan" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "strokecenter1" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "strokecenter2" /&gt;

'''Morphogenesis''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''morphê'' shape and ''genesis'' creation, literally, "beginning of the shape") is the [[biological process]] that causes an [[organism]] to develop its shape. It is one of three fundamental aspects of [[developmental biology]] along with the control of [[cell growth]] and [[cellular differentiation]], unified in [[evolutionary developmental biology]] (evo-devo).

The process controls the organized spatial distribution of cells during the [[Developmental biology|embryonic development]] of an [[organism]]. Morphogenesis can take place also in a mature organism, in [[cell culture]] or inside [[tumor cell]] masses. Morphogenesis also describes the development of [[unicellular]] life forms that do not have an embryonic stage in their life cycle, or describes the [[evolution]] of a body structure within a [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic group]].

Morphogenetic responses may be induced in organisms by [[hormone]]s, by environmental chemicals ranging from substances produced by other organisms to [[toxin|toxic chemicals]] or [[radioactive isotope|radionuclides]] released as pollutants, and other plants, or by mechanical stresses induced by spatial patterning of the cells.

==History==
{{further|evolutionary developmental biology#History}}

Some of the earliest ideas and mathematical descriptions on how physical processes and constraints affect biological growth, and hence [[natural patterns]] such as the [[spirals]] of [[phyllotaxis]], were written by [[D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson]] in his 1917 book ''[[On Growth and Form]]''&lt;ref name=Thompson1917&gt;{{cite book |year=1917 |author=Thompson, D'Arcy Wentworth |title=On Growth and Form |url=https://archive.org/stream/ongrowthform1917thom#page/n7/mode/2up |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Montell2008&gt;{{citation |date=5 December 2008 |author=Montell, Denise J |title=Morphogenetic Cell Movements: Diversity from Modular Mechanical Properties |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=322 |pages=1502–1505 |url=http://irb.chu-montpellier.fr/fr/PDF/DU2009-I/15-12-2008_Introduction_Publi_2.pdf |bibcode=2008Sci...322.1502M |doi=10.1126/science.1164073 |pmid=19056976}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref label|a|a|none}} and [[Alan Turing]] in his ''[[The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis]]'' (1952).&lt;ref name=Turing&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Turing | first= A. M. | title=The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis | journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B]] | volume=237 | pages=37–72 | year=1952 | doi=10.1098/rstb.1952.0012| issue=641| ref=harv |bibcode=1952RSPTB.237...37T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Where Thompson explained animal body shapes as being created by varying rates of growth in different directions, for instance to create the [[Gastropod shell|spiral shell]] of a [[snail]], Turing correctly predicted a mechanism of morphogenesis, the diffusion of two different chemical signals, one activating and one deactivating growth, to set up patterns of development, decades before the formation of such patterns was observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hiscock |first1=Tom W. |last2=Megason |first2=Sean G. |title=Orientation of Turing-like Patterns by Morphogen Gradients and Tissue Anisotropies |journal=Cell Systems |date=2015 |volume=1 |issue=6 |pages=408–416 |doi=10.1016/j.cels.2015.12.001 |url=http://www.cell.com/cell-systems/abstract/S2405-4712(15)00215-X|pmc=4707970 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fuller understanding of the mechanisms involved in actual organisms required the discovery of the structure of [[DNA]] in 1953, and the development of [[molecular biology]] and [[biochemistry]].

==Genetic and molecular basis==
[[File:Gap gene expression.svg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Evolutionary developmental biology|Morphogenesis is controlled]] by a [[evo-devo gene toolkit|"toolkit" of genes]] which switch development on and off at precise times and places. Here, [[gap gene]]s in the fruit fly are switched on by genes such as ''[[bicoid]]'', setting up stripes which create the body's segmental form.]]
{{further|evolutionary developmental biology|transcription factor|gene regulatory network}}

Several types of molecules are important in morphogenesis. [[Morphogen]]s are soluble molecules that can diffuse and carry signals that control cell differentiation via concentration gradients. Morphogens typically act through binding to specific protein [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s. An important class of molecules involved in morphogenesis are [[transcription factor]] proteins that determine the fate of cells by interacting with [[DNA]]. These can be coded for by master regulatory [[gene]]s, and either activate or deactivate the [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of other genes; in turn, these secondary gene products can regulate the expression of still other genes in a regulatory cascade of [[gene regulatory network]]s. At the end of this cascade are classes of molecules that control cellular behaviors such as [[cell migration]], or, more generally, their properties, such as [[cell adhesion]] or cell contractility. For example, during [[gastrulation]], clumps of [[stem cell]]s switch off their cell-to-cell adhesion, become migratory, and take up new positions within an embryo where they again activate specific cell adhesion proteins and form new tissues and organs. Developmental signaling pathways implicated in morphogenesis include Wnt, [[Hedgehog signaling pathway|Hedgehog]], and ephrins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kouros-Mehr |first=H. |author2=Werb, Z.|title=Candidate regulators of mammary branching morphogenesis identified by genome-wide transcript analysis |journal=Dev. Dyn. |year=2006 |volume=235 |issue=12 |pages=3404–12 |pmid=17039550 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dvdy.20978/abstract;jsessionid=D75C4FD14C482BF9B054F966403A15B4.d03t02 |doi=10.1002/dvdy.20978 |pmc=2730892}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cellular basis==

[[File:P19 cell sorting out.png|thumb|upright|Cell sorting out with cultured [[P19 cell|P19 embryonal carcinoma cells]]. Live cells were stained with [[DiI]] (red) or DiO (green). The red cells were [[Genetic engineering|genetically altered]] and express higher levels of [[E-cadherin]] than the green cells. The mixed culture forms large multi-cellular aggregates.]]

At a tissue level, ignoring the means of control, morphogenesis arises because of cellular proliferation and motility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Montévil |first=Maël|last2=Speroni |first2=Lucia |last3=Sonnenschein |first3=Carlos |last4=Soto |first4=Ana M. |date=2016 |title=Modeling mammary organogenesis from biological first principles: Cells and their physical constraints|url=https://www.academia.edu/27958448/Modeling_mammary_organogenesis_from_biological_first_principles_cells_and_their_physical_constraints|journal=Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology |series=From the Century of the Genome to the Century of the Organism: New Theoretical Approaches |volume=122 |issue=1 |pages=58–69 |doi=10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2016.08.004 |pmid=27544910|pmc=5563449 |arxiv=1702.03337 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Morphogenesis also involves changes in the cellular structure or how cells interact in tissues. These changes can result in tissue elongation, thinning, folding, invasion or separation of one tissue into distinct layers. The latter case is often referred as [[cell sorting]]. Cell "sorting out" consists of cells moving so as to sort into clusters that maximize contact between cells of the same type. The ability of cells to do this has been proposed to arise from differential cell adhesion by [[Malcolm Steinberg]] through his [[Differential Adhesion Hypothesis]]. Tissue separation can also occur via more dramatic [[cellular differentiation]] events during which epithelial cells become mesenchymal (see [[Epithelial-mesenchymal transition]]). Mesenchymal cells typically leave the epithelial tissue as a consequence of changes in cell adhesive and contractile properties. Following epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cells can migrate away from an epithelium and then associate with other similar cells in a new location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gilbert, Scott F. |title=Developmental biology |publisher=Sinauer Associates |location=Sunderland, Mass |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=0-87893-243-7 |edition=6th |chapter=Morphogenesis and Cell Adhesion |chapterurl=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?highlight=morphogenesis&amp;rid=dbio.section.372}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cell-cell adhesion===
During embryonic development, cells are restricted to different layers due to differential affinities. One of the ways this can occur is when cells share the same cell-to-cell [[adhesion]] molecules. For instance, homotypic cell adhesion can maintain boundaries between groups of cells that have different adhesion molecules. Furthermore, cells can sort based upon differences in adhesion between the cells, so even two populations of cells with different levels of the same adhesion molecule can sort out. In [[cell culture]] cells that have the strongest adhesion move to the center of a mixed aggregates of cells. Moreover, cell-cell adhesion is often modulated by cell contractility, which can exert forces on the cell-cell contacts so that two cell populations with equal levels of the same adhesion molecule can sort out. The molecules responsible for adhesion are called cell adhesion molecules (CAMs). Several types of cell adhesion molecules are known and one major class of these molecules are [[cadherins]]. There are dozens of different cadherins that are expressed on different cell types. Cadherins bind to other cadherins in a like-to-like manner: E-cadherin (found on many epithelial cells) binds preferentially to other E-cadherin molecules. Mesenchymal cells usually express other cadherin types such as N-cadherin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Hulpiau, P.; van Roy, F. |title=Molecular evolution of the cadherin superfamily |journal=Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=349–69 |date=February 2009 |pmid=18848899 |doi=10.1016/j.biocel.2008.09.027}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Angst, B.; Marcozzi, C.; Magee, A. |title=The cadherin superfamily: diversity in form and function |journal=J Cell Sci |volume=114 |issue=Pt 4 |pages=629–41 |date=February 2001 |pmid=11171368}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extracellular matrix===
The [[extracellular matrix]] (ECM) is involved in keeping tissues separated, providing structural support or providing a structure for cells to migrate on. [[Collagen]], [[laminin]], and [[fibronectin]] are major ECM molecules that are secreted and assembled into sheets, fibers, and gels. Multisubunit transmembrane receptors called [[integrin]]s are used to bind to the ECM. Integrins bind extracellularly to fibronectin, laminin, or other ECM components, and intracellularly to [[microfilament]]-binding proteins [[ACTN1|α-actinin]] and [[talin (protein)|talin]] to link the [[cytoskeleton]] with the outside. Integrins also serve as receptors to trigger [[signal transduction]] cascades when binding to the ECM. A well-studied example of morphogenesis that involves ECM is [[mammary gland]] ductal branching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fata JE, Werb Z, Bissell MJ |title=Regulation of mammary gland branching morphogenesis by the extracellular matrix and its remodeling enzymes |journal=Breast Cancer Res. |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=1–11 |year=2004 |pmid=14680479 |pmc=314442 |doi=10.1186/bcr634 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sternlicht MD |title=Key stages in mammary gland development: the cues that regulate ductal branching morphogenesis |journal=Breast Cancer Res. |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=201 |year=2006 |pmid=16524451 |pmc=1413974 |doi=10.1186/bcr1368 |url=http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/8/1/201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cell contractility===
Tissues can change their shape and separate into distinct layers via cell contractility. Just as in muscle cells, [[myosin]] can contract different parts of the cytoplasm to change its shape or structure. Myosin-driven contractility in embryonic tissue morphogenesis is seen during the separation of [[germ layers]] in the [[model organism]]s ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'', ''[[Drosophila]]'' and [[zebrafish]]. There are often periodic pulses of contraction in embryonic morphogenesis. A model called the cell state splitter involves alternating cell contraction and expansion, initiated by a bistable organelle at the apical end of each cell. The organelle consists of [[microtubules]] and [[microfilaments]] in mechanical opposition. It responds to local mechanical perturbations caused by morphogenetic movements. These then trigger traveling [[embryonic differentiation waves]] of contraction or expansion over presumptive tissues that determine cell type and is followed by cell differentiation. The cell state splitter was first proposed to explain [[neural plate]] morphogenesis during [[gastrulation]] of the [[axolotl]]&lt;ref&gt;Gordon R, Brodland GW. [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02797122 The cytoskeletal mechanics of brain morphogenesis. Cell state splitters cause primary neural induction.] Cell Biophys. 1987 Dec;11:177-238.&lt;/ref&gt; and the model was later generalized to all of morphogenesis.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, NK,Gordon,R.

==Cancer morphogenesis==
[[Cancer]] can result from disruption of normal morphogenesis, including both tumor formation and tumor [[metastasis]].&lt;ref name="pmid18988924"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Fosslien E | title=Cancer morphogenesis: role of mitochondrial failure | journal= [[Annals of Clinical &amp; Laboratory Science]] | volume=38 | issue=4 | pages=307–329 | year=2008 | url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/46f0/82429de96d81a47589aa0c84b3ad68517cbd.pdf  | PMID = 18988924 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mitochondrion|Mitochondrial]] dysfunction can result in increased cancer risk due to disturbed morphogen signaling.&lt;ref name="pmid18988924" /&gt;

'''Obstetrical Forceps''' is an instrument that can be used to assist in the [[Childbirth|delivery]] of a baby as an alternative to the [[ventouse]] (vacuum extraction) method.

{{TOC limit}}
==Medical uses==

Forceps births, like all assisted births, are only undertaken to help promote the health of the mother and/or baby. In general, although caveats such as operator skill apply, a forceps birth is likely to be safer for both the mother and baby than the alternatives - either a ventouse birth or a caesarean section.&lt;ref name=pmid11675055&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(01)06341-3 |pmid=11675055 |title=Early maternal and neonatal morbidity associated with operative delivery in second stage of labour: A cohort study |journal=The Lancet |volume=358 |issue=9289 |pages=1203–7 |year=2001 |last1=Murphy |first1=Deirdre J |last2=Liebling |first2=Rachel E |last3=Verity |first3=Lisa |last4=Swingler |first4=Rebecca |last5=Patel |first5=Roshni }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advantages of forceps use include avoidance of caesarean section (and the short and long-term complications that accompany this), reduction of delivery time, and general applicability with cephalic presentation. Commonly occurring complications include the possibility of bruising the baby and causing more severe tears than would otherwise be the case (although it is important to recognize that almost all women will sustain some form of tear when delivering their first baby). Severe and rare complications (occurring less frequently than 1 in 200) include nerve damage, [[Descemet's membrane]] rupture (extraordinarily rare),&lt;ref name="ISBN0750652616"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anterior Eye Disease and Therapeutics A-Z |last=Loughnan |first=Michael S. |author2=Adrian S.

[[Obstetrics|Obstetric]] forceps consist of two branches (blades) that are positioned around the head of the fetus. These branches are defined as left and right depending on which side of the mother's pelvis they will be applied. The branches usually, but not always, cross at a midpoint which is called the articulation. Most forceps have a locking mechanism at the articulation, but a few have a sliding mechanism instead, allowing the two branches to slide along each other. Forceps with a fixed lock mechanism are used for deliveries where little or no rotation is required, as when the fetal head is in line with the mother's pelvis. Forceps with a sliding lock mechanism is used for deliveries requiring more rotation.&lt;ref name=Healthline&gt;[http://www.healthline.com/yodocontent/pregnancy/assisted-delivery-types-forceps.html Healthline &gt; Types of Forceps Used in Delivery] February 2006. Reviewer: Douglas Levine, Gynecology Service/Department of Surgery, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.&lt;/ref&gt;

The blade of each forceps branch is the curved portion that is used to grasp the fetal head. The forceps should surround the fetal head firmly, but not tightly. The blade characteristically has two curves, the cephalic and the pelvic curves. The cephalic curve is shaped to conform to the fetal head. The cephalic curve can be rounded or rather elongated depending on the shape of the fetal head. The pelvic curve is shaped to conform to the birth canal and helps direct the force of the traction under the pubic bone. Forceps used for rotation of the fetal head should have almost no pelvic curve.&lt;ref name=Healthline/&gt;

The handles are connected to the blades by shanks of variable lengths. Forceps with longer shanks are used if rotation is being considered.&lt;ref name=Healthline/&gt;

===Anglo-American types===
All American forceps are derived from French forceps (long forceps) or English forceps (short forceps).
Short forceps are applied on the fetal head already descended significantly in the maternal pelvis (i.e., proximal to the vagina). Long forceps are able to reach a fetal head still in the middle or even in the upper part of the maternal pelvis.
At present practice, it is uncommon to use forceps to access a fetal head in the upper pelvis. So, short forceps are preferred in the UK and USA. Long forceps are still in use elsewhere.

'''Simpson forceps''' (1848) are the most commonly used among the types of forceps and has an elongated cephalic curve. These are used when there is substantial molding, that is, temporary elongation of the fetal head as it moves through the birth canal.&lt;ref name=Healthline/&gt;

'''Elliot forceps''' (1860) are similar to Simpson forceps but with an adjustable pin in the end of the handles which can be drawn out as a means of regulating the lateral pressure on the handles when the instrument is positioned for use. They are used most often with women who have had at least one previous vaginal delivery because the muscles and ligaments of the birth canal provide less resistance during second and subsequent deliveries. In these cases the fetal head may thus remain rounder.&lt;ref name=Healthline/&gt;

'''Kielland forceps''' (1915, Norwegian) are distinguished by having no angle between the shanks and the blades and a sliding lock. The pelvic curve of the blades is identical to all other forceps.  The common misperception that there is no pelvic curve has become so entrenched in the obstetric literature that it may never be able to be overcome, but it can be proved by holding a blade of Kielland's against any other forceps of one's choice.  Kielland forceps are probably the most common forceps used for rotation. The sliding mechanism at the articulation can be helpful in [[asynclitic birth]]s&lt;ref name=Healthline/&gt; (when the fetal head is tilted to the side)&lt;ref name="spinningbabies"&gt;[http://spinningbabies.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=60&amp;Itemid=28 Asyncletism in labor], spinningbabies.com&lt;/ref&gt; since the fetal head is no longer in line with the birth canal.&lt;ref name=Healthline/&gt;&lt;ref name=Healthline/&gt;  Because the handles, shanks, and blades are all in the same plane the forceps can be applied in any position to affect rotation.  Because the shanks and handles are not angled, the forceps cannot be applied to a high station as readily as those with the angle since the shanks impinge on the perineum.

'''Wrigley's forceps''' are used in ''low'' or ''outlet deliveries'' (see explanations below),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fpnotebook.com/OB/LD/FrcpsAstdDlvry.htm Family Practice Notebook &gt; Forceps Assisted Delivery] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004140008/http://www.fpnotebook.com/OB/LD/FrcpsAstdDlvry.htm |date=4 October 2009 }} written by Scott Moses, MD.

The short length results in a lower chance of uterine rupture.

'''Piper's forceps''' has a perineal curve to allow application to the after-coming head in breech delivery.

==Technique==
The cervix must be fully dilated and retracted and the membranes ruptured. The urinary bladder should be empty, perhaps with the use of a catheter. High forceps are never indicated in the modern era. Mid forceps can occasionally be indicated but require operator skill and caution. The station of the head must be at the level of the ischial spines. The woman is placed on her back, usually with the aid of stirrups or assistants to support her legs. A regional anaesthetic (usually either a spinal, epidural or pudendal block) is used to help the mother stay comfortable during the birth. Ascertaining the precise position of the fetal head is paramount, and though historically was accomplished by feeling the fetal skull suture lines and fontanelles, in the modern era, confirmation with ultrasound is essentially mandatory.  At this point, the two blades of the forceps are individually inserted, the left blade first for the commonest occipito-anterior position; posterior blade first if a transverse position, then locked. The position on the baby's head is checked.  The fetal head is then rotated to the occiput anterior position if it is not already in that position. An [[episiotomy]] may be performed if necessary. The baby is then delivered with gentle (maximum 30&amp;nbsp;[[Pound-force|lb&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;]] or 130 [[Newton (unit)|Newton]]&lt;ref&gt;Derived from the lb&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; value with 1 lbf ≈ 4.45 N&lt;/ref&gt;) traction in the axis of the pelvis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dennen's Forceps Deliveries |last=Dennen |first=Edward H. |year=1989|edition=3rd |publisher=[[F.A.

==History==

The obstetric forceps were invented by the eldest son of the Chamberlen family of surgeons. The Chamberlens were French [[Huguenots]] from Normandy origin but working in Paris before they migrated to England in 1569 to escape from the religious violence in France. William Chamberlen, the patriarch of the family, was most likely a surgeon; he had two sons, both named Pierre, who became maverick surgeons and specialists in midwifery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.39157.514815.47 |pmc=1839178 |title=Keeping mum |journal=BMJ |volume=334 |issue=7595 |pages=698.2 |year=2007 |last1=Moore |first1=Wendy }}&lt;/ref&gt; William and the eldest son practiced in Southampton and then settled in London. The inventor was probably the eldest [[Peter Chamberlen the elder]], who became obstetrician-surgeon of [[Henrietta Maria of France|Queen Henriette]], wife of King Charles I of England and daughter of Henry IV, King of France.
He was succeeded by his nephew, [[Peter Chamberlen the third|Dr. Peter Chamberlen]] (barbers-surgeons were not Doctors in the sense of physician), as royal obstetrician. The success of this dynasty of obstetricians with the Royal family and high nobles was related in part to the use of this "secret" instrument allowing delivery of a live child in difficult cases.
[[File:Chamberlen forceps (Malden found 1813) in K. DAS after Kilian.jpg|thumb|alt=Chamberlen forceps as found in Malden|Chamberlen forceps (Maldon)]]

In fact, the instrument was kept secret for 150 years by the Chamberlen family, although there is evidence for its presence as far back as 1634. [[Hugh Chamberlen the elder]], grandnephew of Peter the eldest, tried to sell the instrument in Paris in 1670, but the demonstration he did in front of [[François Mauriceau]], responsible for Paris [[Hôtel-Dieu de Paris|Hotel-Dieu]] maternity, was a failure which resulted in the death of mother and child. The secret may have been sold by Hugh Chamberlen to Dutch obstetricians at the start of the 18th century in Amsterdam, but there are doubts about the authenticity of what was actually provided to buyers.

The forceps were used most notably in difficult childbirths.  The forceps could avoid some infant deaths when previous approaches (involving hooks and other instruments) extracted them in parts. In the interest of secrecy, the forceps were carried into the birthing room in a lined box and would only be used once everyone was out of the room and the mother blindfolded.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Geof. 2001. Special Delivery. New Scientist. 21 April 4848&lt;/ref&gt;

Models derived from the Chamberlen instrument finally appeared gradually in England and Scotland in 1735. About 100 years after the invention of the forceps by Peter Chamberlen Sr. a surgeon by the name of Jean Palfyn presented his obstetric forceps to the Paris Academy of Sciences in 1723. They contained parallel blades and were called the Hands of Palfyn.
[[File:Palfyn hands (1753) in Witowski after Kilian.jpg|thumb|left|300px|alt=Palfyn hands in different versions| Palfyn "hands" in different versions]]
These "hands" were possibly the instruments described and used in Paris by Gregoire father and son, Dussée, and Jacques Mesnard.&lt;ref&gt;1886. The Last Lyons Forceps. The Medical News. 2 January 14&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Dussee Forceps with two locks - in K. DAS.jpg|thumb|alt=Dussee forceps with its two different locks|Dussee French forceps (circa 1725) with two different locks]]

In 1813, Peter Chamberlen’s midwifery tools were discovered at [[Woodham Mortimer]] Hall near [[Maldon, Essex|Maldon]] (UK). In the attic of the house, the instruments were found along with gloves, old coins and trinkets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(02)86183-9 |title=Lectures on the Mechanism and Management of Natural and Difficult Labours |journal=The Lancet |volume=46 |issue=1140 |pages=57–61 |year=1845 |last1=Murphy |first1=Edwardw }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tools discovered also contained a pair of forceps that were presumably invented by the father of Peter Chamberlen, assumed so because of the  nature of the design.&lt;ref&gt;Aveling, J.H. 1882. The Chamberlens and the Midwifery Forceps 224&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chamberlen family's forceps were based on the idea of separating the two branches of "sugar clamp" (as those used to remove "stones" from bladder), which were put in place one after another in the birth canal. This was not possible with conventional tweezers previously tested. However, they could only succeed in maternal pelvis of normal dimensions and on fetal heads already well engaged (i.e. well lowered into maternal pelvis). Abnormalities of pelvis were much more common in the past than today, which complicated the use of Chamberlen forceps. The absence of pelvic curvature of the branches (vertical curvature to accommodate the anatomical curvature of maternal sacrum) prohibited blades from reaching upper-part of the pelvis and exercising traction in the natural axis of pelvic excavation.

In 1747, French obstetrician [[Andre Levret]], published "Observations sur les causes et accidents de plusieurs accouchements laborieux" (Observations on the Causes and Accidents of Several difficult Deliveries), in which he described his modification of the instrument to follow the ''curvature'' of the maternal pelvis, this "pelvic curve" allowing a grip on a fetal head ''still high'' in the pelvic excavation, which could assist in more difficult cases.
[[File:Forceps de Levret - 1747 - la courbure pelvienne.pdf|thumb|alt=the first illustration of Levret's pelvic curve|First illustration of Levret's pelvic curve – 1747]]
This improvement was published in 1751 in England by [[William Smellie (obstetrician)|William Smellie]] in the book ''A Treatise on the theory and practice of midwifery''. After this fundamental improvement, the forceps would become a common obstetrical instrument for more than two centuries.
[[File:Forceps français (type Levret-Baudelocque) 1860.jpg|thumb|left|alt= French forceps, Levret-Baudelocque type (1760–1860)|French forceps, Levret-Baudelocque type (1760–1860) with perforator and hook at the end of the handles]]
The last improvement of the instrument was added in 1877 by a French obstetrician, Stephan Tarnier in "descriptions of two new forceps." This instrument featured a ''traction system'' misaligned with the instrument itself, sometimes called the "third curvature of the forceps". This particularly ingenious traction system, allowed the forceps to exercise traction on the head of the child following ''the axis of the maternal pelvic excavation'', which had never been possible before.
[[File:Forceps a tracteur. Tarnier (1877 France) et Dewey (1900 GB et USA).JPG|thumb|right|alt=Tarnier forceps with tractor handle (1877) and USA Dewey model (1900)|Tarnier forceps with tractor handle (1877) and USA Dewey model (1900)]]
Tarnier's idea was to "split" mechanically the grabbing of the fetal head (between the forceps blades) on which the operator does not intervene after their correct positioning, from a mechanical accessory set on the forceps itself,  the "tractor" on which the operator exercises traction needed to pull down the fetal head in the correct axis of the pelvic excavation. Tarnier forceps (and its multiple derivatives under other names) remained the most widely used system in the world until the development of the [[cesarean section]].

Forceps had a profound influence on obstetrics as it allowed for the speedy delivery of the baby in cases of difficult or obstructed labor. Over the course of the 19th Century, many practitioners attempted to redesign the forceps, so much so that the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists' collection has several hundred examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Robson, Steve|year=2009|url=http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/17236/ |title=Forceps Delivery: Science Wears its Art on its Sleeve|journal= O&amp;G Magazine |pages= 19–20|volume=11 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the last decades, however, with the ability to perform a [[cesarean section]] relatively safely, and the introduction of the [[ventouse]] or vacuum extractor, the use of forceps and training in the technique of its use has sharply declined.

=== Historical role in the medicalization of childbirth ===
The introduction of the obstetrical forceps provided huge advances in the medicalization of childbirth. Before the eighteenth century, childbirth was thought of as a medical phase that could be overseen by a female relative. Usually if a doctor had to get involved that means that something had gone wrong. Around this era, (eighteenth century) there were no female doctors. Since males were only exclusively called in for extreme circumstance, the act of childbirth was thought to better known to a midwife or female relative rather than that of a male doctor. Usually the male doctor’s job was to save the mother’s life if, for example, the baby had gotten stuck on his or her way exiting the mother. Before the obstetrical forceps, this had to be done by cutting the baby out piece by piece. In other cases, if the baby was deemed undeliverable, then the doctor would use an item called a crochet. This was used to crush the baby’s skull and then pull it out of the mother’s womb. Still in other cases, a caesarean section (c section) could be performed, but this would almost all the time result in the mother’s death. "In addition, women who had forceps deliveries had shorter after childbirth complications than those who had caesarean sections performed."&lt;ref name=pmid15166069&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.328.7451.1302 |pmid=15166069 |pmc=420176 |title=Forceps delivery in modern obstetric practice |journal=BMJ |volume=328 |issue=7451 |pages=1302–5 |year=2004 |last1=Patel |first1=Roshni R |last2=Murphy |first2=Deirdre J }}&lt;/ref&gt; These procedures came with various risks to the mother’s health along with the death of the baby. However, with the introduction of the obstetrical forceps the male doctor had a more important role. In many cases, they could actually save the baby’s life if called early enough. Although the use of the forceps in childbirth came with its own set of risks, the positives included a significant decrease in risk to the mother, a decrease in child morbidity, and a decrease risk to the baby. The forceps gave male doctors a way to deliver babies. Since the forceps in childbirth were made public around 1720, they gave male doctors a way to assist and even oversee childbirths. Around this time, in large cities some notable being London and Paris, some men would become devoted to obstetrical practices. It became stylish among wealthy women of the era to have their childbirth overseen by man midwives. A notable man midwife was William Hunter. He popularized obstetrics. "In 1762, he was appointed as obstetrician to Queen Charlotte."&lt;ref name=pmid23885296&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/2042533313478412 |pmid=23885296 |pmc=3704058 |title=The birth of forceps |journal=JRSM Short Reports |volume=4 |issue=7 |pages=1–4 |year=2013 |last1=Sheikh |first1=Sukhera |last2=Ganesaratnam |first2=Inithan |last3=Jan |first3=Haider }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, with the use of forceps, male doctors invented lying in hospitals to provide safe, somewhat advanced obstetrical care because of the use of the obstetrical forceps.

=== Historical complications ===
Child birth was not considered a medical practice before the eighteenth century. It was mostly overseen by a midwife, mother, stepmother, neighbor, or any female relative. "Around the 19th and 20th Century, childbirth was considered dangerous for women."&lt;ref name=pmid12151591&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/pmj.78.919.311 |pmid=12151591 |pmc=1742346 |title=The start of life: A history of obstetrics |journal=Postgraduate Medical Journal |volume=78 |issue=919 |pages=311–5 |year=2002 |last1=Drife |first1=J }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the introduction of obstetrical forceps, this allowed non medical professionals, such as the aforementioned individuals, to continue to oversee childbirths. In addition, this gave some of the public more comfort in trusting childbirth oversight to common people. However, the introduction of obstetrical forceps also had a negative effect, because there was no medical oversight of childbirth by a medical professional, of some sort, this exposed the practice to unnecessary risks and complications for the fetus and mother. These risks could range from minimal effects to lifetime consequences for both individuals. The baby could develop cuts and bruises in various body parts due to the forcible squeezing of his or her body through the mother’s vagina. In addition, there could be bruising on the baby’s face if the handler of the forceps were to squeeze too tight. In some extreme cases, this could cause temporary or permanent facial nerve injury. Furthermore, if the handler of the forceps were to twist his or her wrist while the grip was on the baby’s head, this would twist the baby’s neck and cause damage to a cranial nerve, resulting in strabismus. In rare cases, a clavicle fracture to the baby could occur. The addition of obstetrical forceps came with complication to the mother during and after childbirth. The use of the forceps gave rise to an increased risk in cuts and lacerations along the vaginal wall. This, in turn, would cause an increase post operation recovery time and increase pain experienced by the mother. In addition, the use of forceps would cause more difficulty evacuating during the recovery time as compared to another mother who did not use the forceps. While some of these risks and complications were very common, in general, many people overlooked them and continued to use them.

'''OpenViBE''' is a [[software platform]] dedicated to designing, testing and using [[brain-computer interface]]s. The package includes a Designer tool to create and run custom applications, along with several pre-configured and demo programs which are ready for use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ercim-news.ercim.eu/en78/rd/openvibe-open-source-software-for-brain-computer-interfaces OpenViBE: Open-Source Software for Brain-Computer Interfaces] ERCIM News, accessed March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

OpenViBE is software for [[Real-time computing|real-time]] [[neuroscience]] (that is, for real-time processing of [[Electroencephalography|brain signals]]). It can be used to acquire, filter, process, classify and visualize brain signals in real time.

==Applications==
The main OpenViBE application fields are medical (assistance to disabled people, real-time [[biofeedback]], [[neurofeedback]], real-time [[diagnosis]]), [[multimedia]] ([[virtual reality]], [[video game]]s), [[robotics]] and all other application fields related to brain-computer interfaces and real-time [[neuroscience]]s.

OpenViBE users can either be [[programmer]]s or people not familiar with programming. This includes [[medical doctor]]s, [[video game developer]]s, researchers in [[signal processing]] or robotics, etc.

Since 2012, the start-up Mensia Technologies has developed an advanced version of the software called NeuroRT Suite.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mensiatech.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interface==
The [[user interface]] of OpenVibe is easy to use for creating BCI scenarios and saving them for later use, to access and to manipulate.
OpenVibe is the first [[Library (computing)|library of functions]] written in [[C++]] of this type developed by [[INRIA]] - Institut national de recherche en informatique et automatique (France) - it can be integrated and applied quickly and easily .

'''Otis Ray Bowen''' (February 26, 1918 – May 4, 2013) was an American politician and physician who served as the [[List of Governors of Indiana|44th]] [[Governor of Indiana]] from 1973 to 1981 and as [[United States Secretary of Health and Human Services|Secretary of Health and Human Services]] from 1985 to 1989.

==Early life==
Bowen was born near [[Rochester, Indiana]], to Vernie Bowen and Pearl Irene Wright. His father's side of the family was deeply religious and originally came from [[Ohio]]. Vernie graduated from [[Valparaiso University]] and was a teacher for 43 years. Vernie also owned a hardware store in [[Leiters Ford, Indiana|Leiters Ford]], was a trustee for Aubbeenaubbee Township, President of the Woodlawn Hospital Board of Trustees, and President of the Leiters Ford Merchants Association. His father was a [[Scottish Rite]] [[Freemasonry|Freemason]] and a member of the [[Independent Order of Odd Fellows]]. In 1915, Vernie married Pearl Irene Wright, whose family was also from Ohio and involved with the Independent Order of Odd Fellows. Otis Bowen is a distant relative of [[George H. W. Bush]] through two brothers who immigrated to [[New England]] from [[Somerset]], [[England]].

Dr. Bowen received his elementary and high school education from local schools and went on to graduate from [[Indiana University Bloomington]] with an A.B. in 1939 and the [[Indiana University School of Medicine]] with an [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] in 1942. At IU, he became a member of the [[Delta Chi]] Fraternity as well as the [[Phi Beta Pi]] Medical Fraternity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Arbutus Yearbook|year=1941|publisher=Indiana University|location=Bloomington, Indiana|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;   He holds 30 honorary degrees including those from schools in his home state such as [[Indiana University]], the [[University of Notre Dame]], [[Ball State University]], [[Valparaiso University]], and [[Anderson University (Indiana)|Anderson University]]. In addition to an honorary degree, [[Bethel College (Indiana)|Bethel College]] also named their campus library in his honor.

He married Elizabeth Anne Steinmann in 1939, who died shortly before his term as Indiana Governor expired in 1981. They had four children; Rick, Judy, Tim, and Rob. Following her death, he married Rose May Hochstetler in September 1981. In 1991, Rose died. In 1992, he married Carol Hahn, a marriage that lasted until his death.

==Career==

[[File:Reagan Contact Sheet C32685 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Bowen being sworn in as [[United States Secretary of Health and Human Services|Secretary of Health and Human Services]] in 1985]]
Bowen began his career on an internship from Memorial Hospital in [[South Bend, Indiana]], in 1942. From 1943 to 1946 he served in the Medical Corps of the [[United States Army]], rising from the rank of 1st lieutenant to captain. On his return from [[World War II]], he set up his own medical practice in his home town of [[Bremen, Indiana]], which he discontinued in 1972. During this time, he also was a member of staff for various hospitals in [[Indiana]] and served as [[coroner]] for [[Marshall County, Indiana]]. In 1981 he took up the post of clinical professor of family medicine at [[Indiana University system|Indiana University]].

During his medical and teaching career, Bowen also got into [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] politics, serving as a member of the [[Indiana House of Representatives]] from 1956 to 1958 and again from 1960 to 1972. He was speaker of the house from 1967 to 1972, Vice Chairman of the legislative council from 1967 to 1968, and Chairman until 1972. After his unsuccessful attempt in 1968, he was elected [[Governor of Indiana]] in 1972 and was re-elected for a second term in 1976, making him the first Governor to serve for eight consecutive years in Indiana since 1851. His campaign slogan, featured in huge letters on billboards, was "Otis Bowen. He Hears You".  His tenure in Indiana's highest public office was marked by a major tax restructuring reducing reliance on property taxes, major improvements to state park facilities, development of a statewide emergency medical services system, and adoption of a medical malpractice law that was destined to become a national model. From 1978 to 1985, he also served on the board of trustees for Valparaiso University. Simultaneously, Bowen served as chairman of the [[Republican Governors Association]], and the [[Midwestern Governors Association]], and the [[National Governors Association]]. In 1980, he served as President of the [[Council of State Governments]].

Bowen continued teaching at Indiana University until he was appointed by [[Ronald Reagan|President Reagan]] as [[United States Secretary of Health and Human Services|Secretary of Health and Human Services]] and confirmed by the US Senate on a vote of 93 to 2, making him the first medical doctor to serve in this position.

At the time of his appointment, criticism was rising that the Reagan Administration was not doing enough to respond to AIDS. Although not as prominent in his advocacy for AIDS issues as then-Surgeon General [[C. Everett Koop]], Bowen did offer explicit warnings about the threats posed by the disease, including its risk to heterosexuals. By 1987, he warned that the threat posed by AIDS could rival deadly health disasters like the [[Black Death]], [[smallpox]], and [[typhoid]] if more was not done to combat the threat posed by the disease.  The following year, after new studies were released showing that the spread of the disease was slowing within many population groups, he commented that "We do not expect any explosion into the heterosexual population."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/08/us/politics/otis-r-bowen-ex-governor-of-indiana-dies-at-95.html Otis R. Bowen, Governor and Health Secretary, Dies at 95 (New York Times article)]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is said that as Secretary he always had a prescription pad handy, recommending remedies to treat minor ailments for both colleagues and members of the press. He served this position until 1989, when he retired to his home in Bremen, Indiana.

==Community involvement==
[[File:Otis-bowen-2007.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Bowen at a community event in 2007]]
Bowen served on a number of committees and conferences, including the Education Commission of the States, and the President's Commission on Federalism. He was the chairman of the Paperwork Commission, Nursing Study Commission, and Medicare Study Commission. He has also received various awards, including the George F. Hixson award from [[Kiwanis|Kiwanis International]]. Bowen is a [[Lutheran]] and member of the [[American Medical Association]], the [[American Legion]], [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]], [[Alpha Omega Alpha]], [[Phi Beta Pi]], [[Delta Chi]], and [[Kiwanis]].

The [http://bowencenterforpublicaffairs.org Bowen Center for Public Affairs] was founded by [[Ball State University]] in honor of Bowen.  He attended every year and provided a congratulatory address to the graduates of this two-day seminar.

The Otis R. Bowen Museum, located on the campus of [[Bethel College (Indiana)|Bethel College]], houses memorabilia and artifacts related to Dr. Otis Bowen's years as Governor of Indiana and Secretary of Health and Human Services. It also houses a copy of the [[Otis Bowen (bust)]].

==Death==
Bowen died May 4, 2013, at a nursing home in [[Donaldson, Indiana]]. He was 95.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ex-Ind. governor, HHS head Otis Bowen dies at 95 |url=https://news.yahoo.com/ex-ind-governor-hhs-head-otis-bowen-dies-170023265.html |publisher=Yahoo News |accessdate=6 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724011448/http://news.yahoo.com/ex-ind-governor-hhs-head-otis-bowen-dies-170023265.html |archivedate=24 July 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Palliative care is provided by a team of [[physician]]s, [[nursing|nurses]], physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech-language pathologists&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|title=Chahda, L., Mathisen, B.

It is appropriate at any age and at any stage in a serious illness and can be provided as the main goal of care or along with curative treatment. Although it is an important part of [[end-of-life care]], it is not limited to that stage. Palliative care can be provided across multiple settings including in hospitals, at home, as part of community palliative care programs, and in skilled nursing facilities. Interdisciplinary palliative care teams work with people and their families to clarify goals of care and provide symptom management, psycho-social, and spiritual support.

Physicians sometimes use the term ''palliative care'' in a sense meaning palliative therapies without curative intent, when no cure can be expected (as often happens in late-stage [[cancer]]s). For example, tumor debulking can continue to reduce pain from [[mass effect (medicine)|mass effect]] even when it is no longer curative. A clearer usage is ''palliative, noncurative therapy'' when that is what is meant, because palliative care can be used along with curative or aggressive therapies.

Medications and treatments are said to have a palliative effect if they relieve symptoms without having a curative effect on the underlying disease or cause. This can include treating nausea related to chemotherapy or something as simple as [[morphine]] to treat the pain of broken leg or [[ibuprofen]] to treat pain related to an [[influenza]] infection.

==Scope of the term==
Palliative care is a term derived from [[Latin]] ''palliare,'' "to cloak." It refers to specialised medical care for people with serious illnesses. It is focused on providing people with relief from the symptoms, pain and stress of a serious illness — whatever the prognosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/perspectives/effective-palliative-care-programs-require-health-system-change |title=Effective Palliative Care Programs Require Health System Change |date=2013-04-17 |accessdate=2013-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal is to improve quality of life for both the sick person and the family as they are the central system for care.

A [[World Health Organization]] statement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=WHO Definition of Palliative Care |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |url=http://www.who.int/cancer/palliative/definition/en/ |accessdate=March 16, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; describes palliative care as "an approach that improves the quality of life of patients and their families facing the problems associated with life-threatening illness, through the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification and impeccable assessment and treatment of pain and other problems, physical, psychosocial and spiritual." More generally, however, the term "palliative care" may refer to any care that alleviates symptoms, whether or not there is hope of a cure by other means; thus, palliative treatments may be used to alleviate the [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side effects]] of curative treatments, such as relieving the [[nausea]] associated with [[chemotherapy]].

The term "palliative care" is increasingly used with regard to diseases other than [[cancer]] such as chronic, progressive pulmonary disorders, [[renal disease]], [[chronic heart failure]], HIV/AIDS and progressive [[neurology|neurological conditions]]. In addition, the rapidly growing field of pediatric palliative care has clearly shown the need for services geared specifically for children with serious illness.

While palliative care may seem to offer a broad range of services, the goals of palliative treatment are concrete: relief from suffering, treatment of pain and other distressing symptoms, psychological and spiritual care, a support system to help the individual live as actively as possible and a support system to sustain and rehabilitate the individual's family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Walsh D| author2 = Gombeski WR| author3 = Goldstein P| author4 = Hayes D| author5 = Armour M | title = Managing a palliative oncology program: the role of a business plan | journal = J Pain Symptom Manage | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 109–18 | date = 1994 | pmid = 7517428 | doi = 10.1016/0885-3924(94)90163-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 2006 in the United States, palliative medicine is now a board certified sub-speciality of internal medicine with specialised fellowships for physicians who are interested in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abim.org/certification/policies/imss/hospice.aspx |title=Hospice and Palliative Medicine Policies |publisher=American Board of Internal Medicine |work=Abim.org |date=2010-07-01 |accessdate=2014-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison with hospice===
{{See also|Hospice care in the United States}}

In the United States, a distinction should be made between palliative care and [[Hospice care in the United States|hospice care]]. Hospice services and palliative care programs share similar goals of providing symptom relief and [[pain management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hill RR | title = Clinical pharmacy services in a home-based palliative care program | journal = Am J Health Syst Pharm | volume = 64 | issue = 8 | pages = 806–810 | date = 2007 | pmid = 17420193 | doi = 10.2146/ajhp060124 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Palliative care services can be appropriate for anyone with a serious, complex illness, whether they are expected to recover fully, to live with chronic illness for an extended time, or to experience disease progression.

Hospice care focuses on five topics: communication, collaboration, compassionate caring, comfort, and cultural (spiritual) care.  The end of life treatment in hospice differs from that in hospitals because the medical and support staff are specialized in treating only the terminally ill.  This specialization allows for the staff to handle the legal and ethical matters surrounding death more thoroughly and efficiently with survivors of the patient. Hospice comfort care also differentiates because patients are admitted to continue managing discomfort relief treatments while the terminally ill receiving comfort care in a hospital are admitted because end-of-life symptoms are poorly controlled or because current outpatient symptom relief efforts are ineffective.

[[Hospice]] is a type of care involving palliation without curative intent. Usually, it is used for people with no further options for curing their disease or in people who have decided not to pursue further options that are [[wikt:arduous#Adjective|arduous]], likely to cause more symptoms, and not likely to succeed. Hospice care under the Medicare Hospice Benefit requires that two physicians certify that a person has less than six months to live if the disease follows its usual course. This does not mean, though, that if a person is still living after six months in hospice he or she will be discharged from the service.

The philosophy and multi-disciplinary team approach are similar with hospice and palliative care, and indeed the training programs and many organizations provide both. The biggest difference between hospice and palliative care is the type of illness people have, where they are in their illness especially related to prognosis, and their goals/wishes regarding curative treatment.

Outside the United States there is generally no such division of terminology or funding, and all such care with a primarily palliative focus, whether or not for people with a terminal illness, is usually referred to as palliative care.

Outside the United States the term [[hospice]] usually refers to a building or institution which specializes in palliative care, rather than to a particular stage of care progression.  Such institutions may predominantly specialize in providing care in an end-of-life setting; but they may also be available for people with other specific palliative care needs.

=== Comfort care in hospitals ===
Despite the fact that many individuals are now dying either at home or in a care facility, as of 2010, 29% of all deaths in the United States occurred in a hospital setting, these statistics increased in 2016 to about 60% of all deaths occurred in the hospital which is a substantial increase from 2010. which is still a rather substantial percentage.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blinderman|first=C.D.|date=|title=Comfort care for patients dying in the hospital|url=|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|volume=373 |issue=26|pages=2549–2561|via=|doi=10.1056/nejmra1411746|pmid=26699170|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|reason=The 60% number from 2016 isn't explained in Blinderman 2015|date=May 2018}} Comfort care can require meticulous techniques to alleviate distress caused by severe health troubles near the end of life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Doctors, nurses, nurses aides, social workers, chaplains, and other hospital support staff work systematically together to carry out end of life care and comfort in the hospital setting. Hospitals are able to accommodate the demand for acute medical attention as well as education and supportive therapies for the families of their loved ones. Within hospital settings, there is an increasing shortage of board-certified palliative care specialists. This shortage results in the responsibility of comfort care falling on the shoulders of other individuals.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Comfort care in hospitals differs from comfort care in hospices because patients’ end-of-life symptoms are poorly controlled prior to checking in.  The average time between death and the admission of a terminally ill patient is 7.9 days.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Patients receiving end of life care in a hospice setting typically have a longer time between their admission and death; 60% of hospice patients passed within approximately 30 days of being admitted. The average length of stay at a hospice house from admission to death is about 48 hours.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=&amp;NA;|title=Hospice care is comfort care|url=http://content.wkhealth.com/linkback/openurl?sid=WKPTLP:landingpage&amp;an=00152258-201405000-00009|journal=Nursing Made Incredibly Easy!|volume=12|issue=3|pages=48–49|doi=10.1097/01.nme.0000446434.39164.96|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practice==

===Assessment of symptoms===
{{anchor|ESAS}}
A method for the assessment of symptoms in people admitted to palliative care is the ''Edmonton Symptoms Assessment Scale'' (ESAS), in which there are eight [[visual analog scale]]s (VAS) of 0 to 10, indicating the levels of [[pain]], activity, [[nausea]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[anxiety]], [[drowsiness]], [[appetite]] and sensation of [[well-being]],&lt;ref name=Bruera1991&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bruera E| author2 = Kuehn N| author3 = Miller MJ| author4 = Selmser P| author5 = Macmillan K | title = The Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS): A simple method for the assessment of palliative care patients | journal = Journal of Palliative Care | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 6–9 | date = 1991 | pmid = 1714502 }}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes with the addition of [[shortness of breath]].&lt;ref name=ontario&gt;[https://www.cancercare.on.ca/common/pages/UserFile.aspx?fileId=13262 Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS)] from Cancer Care Ontario. Revised 2005 February&lt;/ref&gt; On the scales, 0 means that the symptom is absent and 10 that it is of worst possible severity.&lt;ref name=ontario/&gt; It is completed either by the person in need of care alone, by the person with a nurse's assistance, or by the nurses or relatives.&lt;ref name=Bruera1991/&gt;

===End-of-life care===
{{Further|End-of-life care}}
Medications used in palliative care are used differently from standard medications, based on established practices with varying degrees of evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Currow D|author2=Agar MR|author3=Abernethy AP |title=Tackling the Challenges of Clinical Trials in Palliative Care |url=http://adisonline.com/pharmaceuticalmedicine/Abstract/2011/25010/Tackling_the_Challenges_of_Clinical_Trials_in.2.aspx |journal=Pharm Med |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=7–15 |date=2011 |doi=10.2165/11539790-000000000-00000|doi-broken-date=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the use of antipsychotic medications to treat nausea, anticonvulsants to treat pain, and morphine to treat dyspnea. Routes of administration may differ from acute or chronic care, as many people in palliative care lose the ability to swallow. A common alternative route of administration is subcutaneous, as it is less traumatic and less difficult to maintain than intravenous medications. Other routes of administration include sublingual, intramuscular and transdermal. Medications are often managed at home by family or nursing support.&lt;ref&gt;Caresearch: Palliative care knowledge network. [http://www.caresearch.com.au/caresearch/ProfessionalGroups/NursesHubHome/Clinical/MedicationManagement/PalliativeMedications/tabid/1554/Default.aspx "Palliative Medications"] Retrieved October 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Palliative care interventions in care homes may contribute to lower discomfort for residents with dementia, and to improve family member's views of the quality of care.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hall|first=Sue|last2=Kolliakou|first2=Anna|last3=Petkova|first3=Hristina|last4=Froggatt|first4=Katherine|last5=Higginson|first5=Irene J.|date=2011-03-16|title=Interventions for improving palliative care for older people living in nursing care homes|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=3|pages=CD007132|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007132.pub2|issn=1469-493X|pmid=21412898}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, higher quality research is needed to support the benefits of these interventions for older people dying in these facilities.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===Dealing with distress===
{{See also|Distress in cancer caregiving}}
For many, knowing that the end of life is approaching induces various forms of emotional and psychological distress. The key to effective palliative care is to provide a safe way for the individual to address their distresses, that is to say their ''total suffering'', a concept first thought up by [[Cicely Saunders]], and now widely used, for instance by authors like Twycross or Woodruff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Strang P| author2 = Strang S| author3 = Hultborn R| author4 = Arnér S | title = Existential pain—an entity, a provocation, or a challenge? | journal = J Pain Symptom Manage | volume = 27 | issue = 3 | pages = 241–50 | date = March 2004 | pmid = 15010102 | doi = 10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2003.07.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dealing with total [[suffering]] involves a broad range of concerns, starting with treating physical symptoms such as pain, nausea and breathlessness with various medications. Usually, the sick person's concerns are pain, fears about the future, loss of independence, worries about their family and feeling like a burden. The interdisciplinary team also often includes a licensed mental health professional, a licensed [[social worker]], or a [[Mental health counselor|counselor]], as well as spiritual support such as a [[chaplain]], who can play roles in helping people and their families cope. There are five principal methods for addressing patient anxiety in palliative care settings. They are counseling, visualisation, cognitive methods, drug therapy and relaxation therapy. Palliative pets can play a role in this last category.&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn Batson et al.

Wilson and Dennis C. Turner, Sage Publications 1998,{{ISBN|0-7619-1062-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Total pain ===
To take care of a patient’s pain that is at the End of Life, one has to understand that it is of the utmost importance to take care of the Total Body Pain. This Total Body Pain is the sum of all of the physical, psychosocial, and spiritual pain they can be enduring at this stressful time.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rome|first=Robin B|last2=Luminais|first2=Hillary H|last3=Bourgeois|first3=Deborah A.|last4=Blais|first4=Christopher M|date=2011|title=The Role of Palliative Care at the End of Life|journal=The Ochsner Journal|volume=11|issue=4|pages=348–352|issn=1524-5012|pmc=3241069|pmid=22190887}}&lt;/ref&gt; When someone is at the end of their life and they are seeking comfort care, the majority of the time they are in excruciating pain. This pain can be a physical manifestation to where their body is beginning to fight back on itself causing a multitude of physical symptoms. The pain can be in a psychosocial manifestation and can be dealt with by the medical team having open communication about how to cope with and prepare for death. The last aspect of pain that is included in Total Body Pain is the spiritual pain manifestation; if patients spiritual needs are met, then studies show that they will be more likely to get hospice care. Addressing the needs of the Total Body Pain can lead to a better quality of life overall for the patients.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Physical pain ====
The Physical pain can be managed in a way that uses adequate pain medications as long as they will not put the patient at further risk for developing or increasing medical diagnoses such as heart problems or difficulty breathing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Patients at the end of life can exhibit many physical symptoms that can cause extreme pain such as dyspnea (or difficulty breathing), Coughing, [[Xerostomia]] (Dry Mouth), Nausea and Vomiting, Constipation, Fever, [[Delirium]], Excessive Oral and Pharyngeal Secretions (“[[Death rattle|Death Rattle]]”) and many more painful symptoms can be seen that they are hoping to get some pain relief from.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blinderman|first=Craig D.|last2=Billings|first2=J. Andrew|date=2015-12-24|title=Comfort Care for Patients Dying in the Hospital|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=373|issue=26|pages=2549–2561|doi=10.1056/NEJMra1411746|issn=0028-4793|pmid=26699170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Psychosocial pain ====
Once the immediate physical pain has been dealt with, it is important to remember to be a compassionate and empathetic caregiver that is there to listen and be there for their patients. Being able to identify the distressing factors in their life other than the pain can help them be more comfortable.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kelley|first=Amy S.|last2=Morrison|first2=R. Sean|date=2015-08-19|title=Palliative Care for the Seriously Ill|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|language=EN|volume=373|issue=8|pages=747–755|doi=10.1056/nejmra1404684|pmid=26287850|pmc=4671283}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a patient has their needs met then they are more likely to be open to the idea of hospice or treatments outside of comfort care. Having a Psychosocial assessment allows the medical team to help facilitate a healthy patient-family understanding of adjustment, coping and support. This communication between the medical team and the patients and family can also help facilitate discussions on the process of maintaining and enhancing relationships, finding meaning in the dying process, and achieving a sense of control while confronting and preparing for death.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Spiritual pain ====
When a patient is at the end of life, one of the most important things that a lot of them want to talk to their physicians about is their spirituality. Regardless of this desire, less than 50% of physicians believe that it is their job to address these religious concerns, and only a minority of patients have been recorded to have had their spiritual needs met.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Most of the time these patients are referred to Chaplain services if they are available or they rely on the medical staff available and any family and friends that may be there as well. [[Chaplain]] services are one of the best services available for meeting this spiritual need. That being said, there are not enough Chaplains available at any one time and the majority of them are not qualified to be giving services to Comfort Care patients whom often have the most serious illnesses. According to a multiple site cohort study involving 343 advanced cancer patients, it was found that those who had their religious needs met were more likely than those who didn’t have their religious needs met to go through with more hospice care and to not get unnecessary treatments at the end of life, as well as the study showed that they ended up having higher quality of life scores than those who did not have their spiritual needs met.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Children's palliative care==
Palliative care for children and young people is an active and total approach to care, from the point of diagnosis, throughout the child’s life, death and beyond. It embraces physical, emotional, social and spiritual elements and focuses on the enhancement of quality of life for the child or young person, and support for the whole family. It includes the management of distressing symptoms, provision of short breaks, [[End-of-life care|end of life care]] and [[Grief|bereavement]] support.&lt;ref&gt;ACT, 2009.  A Guide to the Development of Children’s Palliative Care Services, 3rd Edition. Bristol: ACT.&lt;/ref&gt;

Palliative care can be introduced at any point throughout a child’s life; it is completely individual. Some children may require palliative care from birth, others only as their condition deteriorates. Families may also vary as to whether they wish to pursue treatments aimed to cure or significantly prolong life. In practice, palliative care should be offered from diagnosis of a life-limiting condition or recognition that curative treatment for a life-threatening condition is not an option; however, each situation is different and care should be tailored to the child.

=== Terminology ===
* '''Life-limiting/life-shortening conditions''' are those for which there is no reasonable hope of cure and from which children or young people will die. Some of these conditions cause progressive deterioration rendering the child increasingly dependent on parents and carers.&lt;ref&gt;Together for Short Lives, 2013.  A Core Care Pathway for Children with Life-limiting and Life-threatening Conditions, 3rd Edition. Bristol: Together for Short Lives&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Life-threatening conditions''' are those for which curative treatment may be feasible but can fail, such as cancer. Children in long-term remission or following successful curative treatment are not included.

There are an estimated 49,000 children and young people in the UK living with a life-threatening or life-limiting condition that may require palliative care services.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser L K, Parslow R C, McKinney P A, Miller M, Aldridge J M, Hain R, Norman P, (2012) [http://www.togetherforshortlives.org.uk/assets/0000/1100/Leeds_University___Children_s_Hospices_UK_-_Ethnicity_Report.pdf Life Limiting and Life-threatening conditions in children and young people in the United Kingdom]; Final Report for Together for Short Lives (Leeds)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Paediatrics|volume =129|issue= 4|year=2012|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/129/4/e923|title=Rising National Prevalence of Life-Limiting Conditions in Children in England|doi=10.1542/peds.2011-2846|pmid =22412035|author=Fraser L K, Parslow R C, McKinney P A, Miller M, Aldridge J M, Hain R, Norman P|pages= E923–E929}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 survey from the [[Royal College of Nursing]] (RCN) found that nearly a third of children's nurses said they don't have the resources to deliver adequate care in the home setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/dame-elizabeth-fradd/childrens-nurses-needed-t_b_12355814.html|title=Children's Nurses Needed To Bridge Care Gap {{!}} Huffington Post|website=The Huffington Post|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Australia and New Zealand'''

The Paediatric Palliative Care Australia and New Zealand Corporation (PPCANZ) in conjuction with Palliative Care Australia suppports a 'Paediatric Palliative Care' website &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://palliativecare.org.au/children|title=Paediatric Palliative Care - Australia and New Zealand|last=|first=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which provides practical information about paediatric palliative care to families who have a child with a life-limiting illness, as well as information about the people who support them. There is however very little empirical research regarding the support provided to children in palliative care.  To help address the lack of research, the Palliative Care Unit at La Trobe University, Melbourne, Australia, is currently conducting an international modified delphi study to provide 'Recommendations for Speech-Language Pathologist (SLPs) in Paediatric Palliative Care Teams' (''abbrev''. RESP&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;CT). This study will conclude in 2020/2021 and hopefully provide greater information with regard to the collaborative role of SLPs assisting children, families and clinical staff regarding appropriate and multidisciplinary palliative care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Krikheli, L., Carey, L.B., Mathisen, B., Erickson, S., &amp; Carey-Sargeant, C.L.

==History==
Palliative care began in the hospice movement and is now widely used outside of traditional hospice care. [[Hospice]]s were originally places of rest for travellers in the 4th century. In the 19th century a religious order established hospices for the dying in Ireland and [[London]]. The modern hospice is a relatively recent concept that originated and gained momentum in the United Kingdom after the founding of [[St. Christopher's Hospice]] in 1967. It was founded by Dame [[Cicely Saunders]], widely regarded as the founder of the modern hospice movement. Dame Cicely Saunders, went to St.Thomas’ Hospital in 1944 to become a nurse. After working with the terminally ill she went and became a doctor in 1957 so that she could start her own hospice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://patricialundy.com/2016/09/22/the-brief-history-of-end-of-life-care-and-its-ever-present-myths/|title=The Brief History of End-of-Life and Comfort Care and its Ever-Present Myths|date=2016-09-22|work=Patricia Lundy|access-date=2017-12-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr. Cicely Saunders then opened her own hospice after she saw all of the terminally ill patients that she nursed in excruciating pain because their pain was not being managed like it should have been. {{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

In the UK in 2005 there were just under 1,700 hospice services consisting of 220 inpatient units for adults with 3,156 beds, 33 inpatient units for children with 255 beds, 358 home care services, 104 hospice at home services, 263 day care services and 293 hospital teams. These services together helped over 250,000 people in 2003 and 2004.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Hospice in the United States has grown from a volunteer-led movement to a significant part of the health care system. In 2005 around 1.2 million persons and their families received hospice care. Hospice is the only Medicare benefit that includes pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, twenty-four-hour/seven-day-a-week access to care and support for loved ones following a death. Most hospice care is delivered at home. Hospice care is also available to people in home-like hospice residences, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, veterans' facilities, hospitals, and prisons.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The first United States hospital-based palliative care consult service was developed by the [[Wayne State University School of Medicine]] in 1985 at [[Detroit Receiving Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Carlson |first= Richard |last2= Devich |first2= Lynn |last3= Frank |first3= Robert |date= 1988 |title= Development of a Comprehensive Supportive Care Team for the Hopelessly Ill on a University Hospital Medical Service |url= http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=370287 |journal= JAMA |volume= 259 |issue= 3 |pages= 378–383 |doi= 10.1001/jama.1988.03720030038030 |access-date=21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first palliative medicine program in the United States was started in 1987 by Declan Walsh, MD at the [[Cleveland Clinic]] Cancer Center in Cleveland, Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Walsh |first= Declan |date= 2000 |title= The Harry R.

The program evolved into The Harry R. Horvitz Center for Palliative Medicine which was designated as a [[World Health Organization]] international demonstration project and accredited by the [[European Society for Medical Oncology]] as an Integrated Center of Oncology and Palliative Care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldstein|first=P.|last2=Walsh|first2=D.|last3=Horvitz|first3=L.

Since then there has been a dramatic increase in hospital-based palliative care programs, now numbering more than 1,400. Eighty percent of US hospitals with more than 300 beds have a program.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

A widely cited report in 2007 of a randomized controlled trial with 298 patients found that palliative care delivered to patients and their caregivers at home improved satisfaction with care while decreasing medical service use and the cost of care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brumley|first1=R|last2=Enguidanos|first2=S|last3=Jamison|first3=P|last4=Seitz|first4=R|last5=Morgenstern|first5=N|last6=Saito|first6=S|last7=McIlwane|first7=J|last8=Hillary|first8=K|last9=Gonzalez|first9=J|title=Increased satisfaction with care and lower costs: results of a randomized trial of in-home palliative care.|journal=J Am Geriatr Soc|date=2007|volume=55|issue=7|pages=993–1000|doi=10.1111/j.1532-5415.2007.01234.x|pmid=17608870|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 study regarding the availability of palliative care in 120 US cancer center hospitals reported the following: only 23% of the centers have beds that are dedicated to palliative care; 37% offer inpatient hospice; 75% have a median time of referral to palliative care to the time of death of 30 to 120 days; research programs, palliative care fellowships, and mandatory rotations for oncology fellows were uncommon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | display-authors = 8| author = Hui D| author2 = Elsayem A| author3 = De la Cruz M| author4 = Berger A| author5 = Zhukovsky DS| author6 = Palla S| author7 = Evans A| author8 = Fadul N| author9 = Palmer JL| author10 = Bruera E | title = Availability and integration of palliative care at US cancer centers | journal = JAMA | volume = 303 | issue = 11 | pages = 1054–61 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20233823 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2010.258 | pmc=3426918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The results of a 2010 study in ''The New England Journal of Medicine'' showed that people with lung cancer who received early palliative care in addition to standard oncologic care experienced less depression, increased quality of life and survived 2.7 months longer than those receiving standard oncologic care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Temel, J.S.|title=Early Palliative Care for Patients with Metastatic Non–Small-Cell Lung Cancer|pmid=20818875|journal=N Engl J Med|year=2010|volume= 363|issue=8|pages=733–742|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa1000678}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, The Joint Commission (an independent, not-for-profit organization that accredits and certifies thousands of health care organizations and programs in the United States) began an Advanced Certification Program for Palliative Care that recognizes hospital inpatient programs. In order to obtain this certification, a hospital must show superior care and enhancement of the quality of life for people with serious illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jointcommission.org/certification/palliative_care.aspx |title=Advanced Certification for Palliative Care Programs |publisher=Joint Commission |date=2014-04-30 |accessdate=2014-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first pan-[[Europe]]an center devoted to improving palliative care and end-of-life care was established in [[Trondheim]], Norway in 2009. The center is based at NTNU's Faculty of Medicine and at [[St Olav's University Hospital|St. Olav's Hospital/Trondheim University Hospital]] and coordinates efforts between groups and individual researchers across Europe, specifically Scotland, [[England]], Italy, Denmark, Germany and Switzerland, along with the United States, Canada and Australia.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===Costs and funding===
Families of persons who get a referral to palliative care during a hospitalization incur less costs than people with similar conditions who do not get a palliative care referral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 18779466 | doi=10.1001/archinte.168.16.1783 | volume=168 | issue=16 | title=Cost savings associated with US hospital palliative care consultation programs | date=Sep 2008 | journal=Arch Intern Med | pages=1783–90 | author=Morrison RS, Penrod JD, Cassel JB, Caust-Ellenbogen M, Litke A, Spragens L, Meier DE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding for hospice and palliative care services varies. In [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] and many other countries all palliative care is offered free, either through the ''[[National Health Service]]'' (as in the UK) or through charities working in partnership with the local health services. Palliative care services in the US are paid by philanthropy, fee-for service mechanisms, or from direct hospital support while hospice care is provided as Medicare benefit; similar hospice benefits are offered by Medicaid and most private health insurers. Under the Medicare Hospice Benefit (MHB) a person signs off their Medicare Part B (acute hospital payment) and enrols in the MHB through Medicare Part B with direct care provided by a Medicare certified hospice agency. Under terms of the MHB the Hospice agency is responsible for the Plan of Care and may not bill the person for services. The hospice agency, together with the person's primary physician, is responsible for determining the Plan of Care. All costs related to the terminal illness are paid from a per diem rate (~US $126/day) that the hospice agency receives from Medicare – this includes all drugs and equipment, nursing, social service, chaplain visits and other services deemed appropriate by the hospice agency; Medicare does not pay for custodial care. People may elect to withdraw from the MHB and return to Medicare Part A and later re-enrol in hospice.

===Certification and training for services===
In most countries hospice care and palliative care is provided by an interdisciplinary team consisting of [[physician]]s, [[clinical pharmacy|pharmacists]], [[registered nurses]], [[nursing assistants]], [[social worker]]s, [[hospice chaplain]]s, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, complementary therapists, volunteers, and, most importantly, the [[family]]. The team's focus is to optimize the person's comfort. In some countries, additional members of the team may include certified nursing assistants and home healthcare aides, as well as volunteers from the community (largely untrained but some being skilled medical personnel), and housekeepers. In the United States, the physician subspeciality of [[hospice and palliative medicine]] was established in 2006&lt;ref&gt;American Board of Medical Specialties, [http://www.abms.org/News_and_Events/downloads/NewSubcertPalliativeMed.pdf ABMS Establishes New Subspecialty Certificate in Hospice and Palliative Medicine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101116144358/http://abms.org/News_and_Events/downloads/NewSubcertPalliativeMed.pdf |date=2010-11-16 }}, October 6, 2006, accessed 11/9/2010.&lt;/ref&gt; to provide expertise in the care of people with life-limiting, advanced disease, and [[catastrophic injury]]; the relief of distressing symptoms; the coordination of interdisciplinary care in diverse settings; the use of specialized care systems including hospice; the management of the imminently dying patient; and legal and ethical decision making in end-of-life care.&lt;ref&gt;American Board of Medical Specialties, [http://www.boardcertifieddocs.com/pdf/Resources_guide_physicians.pdf ABMS Guide to Physician Specialties], 2011, p. 2, accessed 11/9/2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Caregivers, both family and [[voluntary caregiver|volunteers]], are crucial to the palliative care system. Caregivers and people being treated often form lasting friendships over the course of care. As a consequence caregivers may find themselves under severe emotional and physical strain. Opportunities for caregiver [[respite care|respite]] are some of the services hospices provide to promote caregiver well-being. Respite may last a few hours up to several days (the latter being done by placing the primary person being cared for in a [[nursing home]] or inpatient hospice unit for several days).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thayyil|first=Jayakrishnan|author2=Cherumanalil JM|title=Assessment of status of patients receiving palliative home care and services provided in a rural area-Kerala, India|journal=Indian Journal of Palliative Care|date=2012|series=18|pages=213–8|doi=10.4103/0973-1075.105693|pmid=23440060|volume=18|issue=3|pmc=3573477}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, board certification for physicians in palliative care was through the [[American Board of Hospice and Palliative Medicine]]; recently this was changed to be done through any of 11 different speciality boards through an [[American Board of Medical Specialties]]-approved procedure. Additionally, board certification is available to [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States|osteopathic physicians]] ([[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|D.O.]]) in the United States through four medical speciality boards through an [[American Osteopathic Association Bureau of Osteopathic Specialists]]-approved procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Specialties &amp; Subspecialties|url=http://www.osteopathic.org/inside-aoa/development/aoa-board-certification/Pages/specialty-subspecialty-certification.aspx|publisher=American Osteopathic Association|accessdate=23 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 50 fellowship programs provide one to two years of speciality training following a primary residency. In [[UK|Britain]] palliative care has been a full speciality of medicine since 1989 and training is governed by the same regulations through the [[Royal College of Physicians]] as with any other medical speciality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aahpm.org/certification/default/index.html|title=American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine|author=American Academy of Hospice|author2=Palliative Medicine|last-author-amp=yes|publisher=Aahpm.org|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nurses, in the United States and internationally, can receive continuing education credits through Palliative Care specific trainings, such as those offered by [[End-of-Life Nursing Education Consortium (ELNEC)]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ferrell Betty R. | year = 2005 | title = Evaluation of the End-of-Life Nursing Education Consortium undergraduate faculty training program | url = | journal = Journal of Palliative Medicine | volume = 8 | issue = 1| pages = 107–114 | doi=10.1089/jpm.2005.8.107| pmid = 15662179 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In India Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai has started a physician course in palliative medicine for the first time in the country since 2012.

===Regional variation in services===
{{See also|Hospice care in the United States}}
In the United States, hospice and palliative care represent two different aspects of care with similar philosophy, but with different payment systems and location of services. Palliative care services are most often provided in acute care hospitals organized around an interdisciplinary consultation service, with or without an acute inpatient palliative care unit. Palliative care may also be provided in the dying person's home as a "bridge" program between traditional US home care services and hospice care or provided in long-term care facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality | url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/profiles/home-palliative-care-allows-more-patients-die-home-leading-higher-satisfaction-and-lower |title=In-Home Palliative Care Allows More Patients to Die at Home, Leading to Higher Satisfaction and Lower Acute Care Utilization and Costs |date=2013-04-03 |accessdate=2013-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast over 80% of hospice care in the US is provided at home with the remainder provided to people in long-term care facilities or in free standing hospice residential facilities. In the UK hospice is seen as one part of the speciality of palliative care and no differentiation is made between 'hospice' and 'palliative care'.

In the UK palliative care services offer inpatient care, home care, day care and outpatient services, and work in close partnership with mainstream services. Hospices often house a full range of services and professionals for children and adults. In 2015 the UK's palliative care was ranked as the best in the world "due to comprehensive national policies, the extensive integration of palliative care into the ''[[National Health Service]]'', a strong hospice movement, and deep community engagement on the issue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Quality of Death Index 2015: Ranking palliative care across the world|url=http://www.economistinsights.com/healthcare/analysis/quality-death-index-2015|accessdate=8 October 2015|work=The Economist Intelligence Unit|date=6 October 2015|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|title=UK end-of-life care 'best in world'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-34415362|accessdate=8 October 2015|work=BBC|date=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acceptance===
The focus on a person's quality of life has increased greatly since the 1990s. In the United States today, 55% of hospitals with more than 100 beds offer a palliative-care program,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Center to Advance Palliative Care, www.capc.org&lt;/ref&gt; and nearly one-fifth of community hospitals have palliative-care programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lynn, Joanne |title=Sick to death and not going to take it anymore!: reforming health care for the last years of life |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |location=Berkeley |date=2004 |page= 72 |isbn=978-0-520-24300-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A relatively recent development is the palliative-care team, a dedicated health care team that is entirely geared toward palliative treatment.

Physicians practicing palliative care do not always receive support from the people they are treating, family members, healthcare professionals or their social peers. More than half of physicians in one survey reported that they have had at least one experience where a patient's family members, another physician or another health care professional had characterised their work as being "[[euthanasia]], murder or killing" during the last five years. A quarter of them had received similar comments from their own friends or family member, or from a patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Goldstein NE| author2 = Cohen LM| author3 = Arnold RM| author4 =  Goy E| author5 = Arons S| author6 = Ganzini L | title = Prevalence of Formal Accusations of Murder and Euthanasia against Physicians | journal = J Palliat Med | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 334–9 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 22401355 | doi = 10.1089/jpm.2011.0234 | pmc=3295854}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Minuit''', '''Pieter Minuit''', '''Pierre Minuit''', or '''Peter Minnewit''' (between 1580 and 1585 – August 5, 1638) was a [[Walloons|Walloon]] from [[Wesel]], in present-day [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], Germany, then part of the [[Duchy of Cleves]]. His surname means "midnight" in French.&lt;ref name=footprints&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Nevius|first1=James|last2=Nevius|first2=Michelle|title=Footprints in New York: Tracing the Lives of Four Centuries of New Yorkers|location=Guilford, Conn.|publisher=Lyons Press|date=2014|isbn=9780762796366|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_nhBBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA13#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the 4th [[Director-General of New Netherland|Director]] of the Dutch North American colony of [[New Netherland]] from 1626 until 1631, and 3rd Governor of New Netherland. He founded the [[Sweden|Swedish]] colony of [[New Sweden]] on the [[Delaware Peninsula]] in 1638.

Minuit is generally credited with orchestrating the purchase of [[Manhattan Island]] for the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] from the [[Lenape]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. Manhattan later became the site of the Dutch city of [[New Amsterdam]], and the borough of [[Manhattan]] of modern-day [[New York City]]. A common account states that Minuit purchased Manhattan for $24 worth of trinkets.  A letter written by Dutch merchant Peter Schaghen to directors of the [[Dutch East India Company]] stated that Manhattan was purchased "for the value of 60 [[guilder]]s" in goods,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Soniak|first1=Matt|title=Was Manhattan Really Bought for $24?|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/12657/was-manhattan-really-bought-24|website=MentalFloss|accessdate=2017-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; an amount worth approximately $1,050 in 2015 dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iisg.nl/hpw/calculate.php|accessdate=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life===
Peter Minuit was born sometime between 1580 and 1585,&lt;ref name=wesel&gt;[https://www.wesel.de/en/city-portrait/peter-minuit/ "Peter Minuit", Wesel.de]&lt;/ref&gt; into a [[Calvinist]] family&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/23323599?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents A Calvinistic Founder of America: Peter Minuit]&lt;/ref&gt; that had moved from the city of [[Tournai]] (presently part of [[Wallonia]], Belgium) in the [[Southern Netherlands]], to Wesel in Germany, in order to avoid Spanish Catholic colonials, who were not favorably disposed toward [[Protestants]].&lt;ref name=nni/&gt;

His father, Johan, died in 1609 and Peter took over management of the household and his father's business. Peter had a good reputation in Wesel, attested by the fact that he was several times appointed a guardian. He also assisted the poor during the Spanish occupation of 1614–1619.&lt;ref name=wesel/&gt;

Minuit married Gertrude Raedts on August 20, 1613. Gertrude was from a wealthy family and she probably helped Peter Minuit establish himself as a broker. A will drawn up in 1615 in the Dutch city of [[Utrecht]], mentions "Peter Minnewit" as a diamond cutter.&lt;ref name=nni/&gt;  Whether he traded in other items is unknown.

By 1624, the city was in an economic decline and in 1625, he had left Wesel and like others, went to Holland. At first, Gertrude went to stay with her relatives in Cleve.&lt;ref name=wesel/&gt;

===As director of New Netherland===
{{refimprove section|date=May 2017}}
[[File:The Purchase of Manhattan Island.png|thumb|1909 drawing of ''The Purchase of Manhattan Island'']]

Minuit and his family joined the [[Dutch West India Company]], probably in the mid-1620s, and was sent to New Netherland in 1625 to search for tradable goods other than the animal pelts that then were the major product coming from New Netherland. He returned in the same year, and in 1626 was appointed the new director of New Netherland, taking over from Willem Verhulst. He sailed to North America and arrived in the colony on May 4, 1626.&lt;ref name=WDmin&gt;[http://www.wesel.de/C125759F00493DB1/html/D724335345623923C12574D60036E797?Open "Peter Minuit" (biography), Wesel, Germany, webpage:  Wesel-Minuit].&lt;/ref&gt; 

Minuit is credited with purchasing the island of Manhattan from the Native Americans in exchange for traded goods valued at 60 [[Dutch gulden|guilders]]. According to the writer Nathaniel Benchley, Minuit conducted the transaction with Seyseys, chief of the [[Lenape|Canarsees]], who were only too happy to accept valuable merchandise in exchange for an island that was mostly controlled by the [[Wappinger|Weckquaesgeeks]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanheritage.com/content/24-swindle Benchley, Nathaniel. "The $24 Swindle: The Indians who sold Manhattan were bilked, all right, but they didn’t mind — the land wasn't theirs anyway."] ''American Heritage'', Vol. 11, no. 1 (Dec. 1959).&lt;/ref&gt;

The figure of 60 guilders comes from a letter by a representative of the Dutch States-General and member of the board of the Dutch West India Company, Pieter Janszoon Schagen, to the States-General in November 1626.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newnetherlandinstitute.org/history-and-heritage/more-historical-fun/dutch-treats/peter-schagen-letter/ Peter Schaghen Letter with transcription. New Netherland Institute (1626-11-07). Retrieved on 2015-02-16.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1846, New York historian [[John Romeyn Brodhead]] converted the figure of Fl 60 (or 60 guilders) to [[United States dollar|US$]]23.&lt;ref name="NeviusNevius2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nevius|first1=Michelle|last2=Nevius|first2=James|title=Inside the Apple: A Streetwise History of New York City|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O8K5OCC4CMwC&amp;pg=PA9|date=2009|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4165-8997-6|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popular account rounds this off to $24.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[[Edwin G. Burrows]] and [[Mike Wallace (historian)|Mike Wallace]], ''[[Gotham: A History of New York City to 1898]]'', (1999: xivff)&lt;/ref&gt; By 2006 sixty guilders in 1626 was worth approximately $1,000 in current dollars, according to the Institute for Social History of Amsterdam.&lt;ref&gt;The International Institute for Social History, Amsterdam [http://www.iisg.nl/hpw/calculate.php calculates] its value as 60 guilders (1626) = [[Euro|€]]678.91 (2006), equal to about $1,000 in 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to researchers at the National Library of the Netherlands,{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} "The original inhabitants of the area were unfamiliar with the European notions and definitions of ownership rights. For the Indians, water, air and land could not be traded. Such exchanges would also be difficult in practical terms because many groups migrated between their summer and winter quarters. It can be concluded that both parties probably went home with totally different interpretations of the sales agreement."

A contemporary purchase of rights in nearby [[Staten Island, New York|Staten Island]], to which Minuit also was party, involved duffel cloth, iron [[kettle]]s, [[axe]] heads, [[hoe (tool)|hoe]]s, [[wampum]], drilling [[bradawl|awls]], "[[Jew's harp]]s", and "diverse other wares". "If similar trade goods were involved in the Manhattan arrangement", Burrows and Wallace surmise, "then the Dutch were engaged in high-end [[technology transfer]], handing over equipment of enormous usefulness in tasks ranging from clearing land to drilling [[wampum]]."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Minuit conducted politics in a measure of democracy in the colony during his time in New Netherland. He was highest judge in the colony, but in both civil and criminal affairs he was assisted by a council of five colonists. This advisory body would advise the director and jointly with him would develop, administer, and adjudicate a body of laws to help govern the colony. In addition there was a schout-fiscal, half-sheriff, half-attorney-general, and the customs officer.&lt;ref name=nni&gt;[http://www.newnetherlandinstitute.org/history-and-heritage/dutch_americans/peter-minuit/ "Peter Minuit", New Netherlands Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; During Minuit's administration, several mills were built, trade grew exponentially, and the population grew to almost 300.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

In 1631, the Dutch West India Company (WIC) suspended Minuit from his post for reasons that are unclear, but probably for (perhaps unintentionally) abetting the landowning [[patroons]] who were engaging in illegal fur trade and otherwise enriching themselves against the interests and orders of the West India Company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biography.com/people/peter-minuit-9409851 Peter Minuit Biography - Facts, Birthday, Life Story].

Retrieved on 2013-07-23.&lt;/ref&gt; He arrived back in Europe in August 1632 to explain his actions, but was dismissed &lt;ref name=WDmin /&gt; and was succeeded as director by [[Wouter van Twiller]]. It is possible that Minuit had become the victim of the internal disputes over the rights that the board of directors had given to the patroons.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

===Establishing the New Sweden colony===
After having lived in [[Cleves, Germany]] for several years, Minuit made arrangements with [[Samuel Blommaert]] and the [[Sweden|Swedish]] government in 1636 or 1637 to create the first Swedish colony in the [[New World]]. Located on the lower [[Delaware River]] within territory earlier claimed by the Dutch, it was called [[New Sweden]]. Minuit and his company arrived on the ''[[Fogel Grip]]'' and ''[[Kalmar Nyckel]]'' at [[Swedes' Landing]] (now [[Wilmington, Delaware]]), in the spring of 1638. They constructed [[Fort Christina]] later that year, then returned to [[Stockholm]] for a second load of colonists, and made a side trip to the [[Caribbean]] on the return to pick up a shipment of [[tobacco]] for resale in Europe to make the voyage profitable. During this voyage, Minuit drowned when the ship he was visiting (at the invitation of its Dutch captain, a friend of Minuit), [[The Flying Deer (ship)|''The Flying Deer'']], was lost with all hands during a [[list of Atlantic hurricanes in the 17th century#1625–1649|hurricane]] at [[Saint Kitts|St. Christopher]] (today's St. Kitts) in the Caribbean. The losses suffered, such as goods, colonists, and Minuit, caused irreversible damage to Sweden's colonization attempts. Two years later, Swedish Lt. [[Måns Nilsson Kling]], whose rank was raised to captain, replaced him as governor. Nine expeditions to the colony were carried out before the Dutch captured it in 1655.&lt;ref&gt;Bente, Friedrich, 1858-1930.

===In popular culture===
*The beginning lines of [[Rodgers and Hart]]'s 1939 song "[[Give It Back to the Indians]]" recount the sale of Manhattan: "Old Peter Minuit had nothing to lose when he bought the isle of Manhattan / For twenty-six dollars and a bottle of booze, and they threw in the Bronx and Staten / Pete thought he had the best of the bargain, but the poor red man just grinned / And he grunted "ugh!" (meaning "okay" in his jargon) for he knew poor Pete was skinned."
*One version of Minuit was played by [[Groucho Marx]] in the 1957 [[comedy]] [[film]] ''[[The Story of Mankind (film)|The Story of Mankind]]''.
*Minuit is mentioned on the HBO drama ''[[Boardwalk Empire]]'', where the character [[Edward L. Bader|Edward Bader]] tells a joke featuring the line, "'50 bucks?' the fella says. '[[Peter Stuyvesant]] only paid 24 for the entire island of Manhattan!'", while [[Steve Buscemi]]'s' character Enoch 'Nucky' Thompson has to correct Bader and inform him that it was in fact Peter Minuit who bought Manhattan, not Stuyvesant.
*[[Bob Dylan]] mentions Minuit in his song "Hard Times in New York Town" (released on [[The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 (Rare &amp; Unreleased) 1961–1991|The Bootleg Series Volume 1]]) in the following line: ''[[Henry Hudson|Mister Hudson]] come a-sailing down the stream, / and old Mister Minuit paid for his dream.'' In the released recording of the song, however, Dylan [[Spoonerism|spoonerizes]] "Mister Minuit" by mispronouncing his name as "Minnie Mistuit."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reocities.com/temptations_page/DylGuide.html The Annotated Bob Dylan].

*Minuit is mentioned in the first episode, ''[[Uno (Better Call Saul)|Uno]]'', of the AMC drama ''[[Better Call Saul]]''. Jimmy McGill (the later titular Saul), while confronting lawyers at his brother's law firm, accuses them of being "like Peter Minuit" and suggests that they "throw in some beads and shells" to the $26,000.00 being given to his brother.

'''''Predator X''''' is a 2009 television special on the cable television channel [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]]. The show documents the excavation of a giant [[pliosaur]] on an island in the [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Svalbard Islands|Svalbard]] archipelago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhm.uio.no/pliosaurus/english/index.html|title=Monsterdiggers 2008|publisher=University of Oslo}}&lt;/ref&gt; The special follows Dr. [[Jørn Hurum]] and a team of paleontologists from the [[University of Oslo]] as they excavate the site.

The specimen — claimed by Hurum at the time to be a new species&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fossil sea monster biggest of its kind|publisher=ABC News|date=February 2, 2008|url=http://abc.com.au/news/stories/2008/02/28/2175686.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; — had not received a taxonomic classification by the time of the television special and was, therefore, codenamed "[[Predator X]]". The team initially called their discovery "The Monster", and the nickname has been used extensively by the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='The Monster' helps piece together puzzle|author=Deshayes, Pierre-Henry|date=October 11, 2006|publisher=''The Standard''|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=9&amp;art_id=29109&amp;sid=10311750&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20061011&amp;fc=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=graveyard&gt;{{cite news|publisher=MSNBC|title=‘Monster’ found in Jurassic graveyard|date=October 5, 2006|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15139760/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fossil sea monster big enough to "bite a car"|url=http://www.cctv.com/program/cultureexpress/20080228/106677.shtml|date=February 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial discovery was made in 2006, as part of a find of dozens of [[pliosaurus|pliosaur]] and [[plesiosaur]] specimens. At nearly 15&amp;nbsp;m (49&amp;nbsp;ft) in length, "The Monster" is the largest pliosaur skeleton ever discovered, considerably larger than ''[[Kronosaurus]]''.&lt;ref name=ScienceDaily&gt;{{cite news|title=Enormous Jurassic Sea Predator, Pliosaur, Discovered In Norway|publisher=''Science Daily''|date=February 9, 2008|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/02/080229101002.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news24.com/News24/Technology/News/0,,2-13-1443_2486573,00.html "Fossil 'makes T-Rex look feeble'"], news24.com, 17 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, it was given the taxonomic name ''[[pliosaurus#pliosaurus funkei|Pliosaurus funkei]]''.

The '''Promethians''' are a fictional race of [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]] featured in the ''[[Rifts (role-playing game)|Rifts]]'' [[role-playing game]] from [[Palladium Books]]. They reside in an intergalactic region of space known as the Three Galaxies, which is located in an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|extradimensional]] universe. Promethians first appeared in ''Rifts Dimension Book Two: Phase World'', authored by [[C. J. Carella]] and published December 1994.

== Planetary government ==
The Promethians are the natives of a planet called Phase World, and are the undisputed masters and administrators of the transdimensional city of Center, a super-[[metropolis]] that stands thousands of feet high and covers many tens of miles in land area. The Promethians allow only the Draconid and Phantom races to co-exist outside of this massive [[arcology]]; the rest of the populace is not allowed to roam any part of Phase World's surface outside of Center – which holds over 600 million inhabitants from species throughout the Palladium Megaverse. 

For reasons unknown, the Promethians do very little to restrict activities within Center itself; absolutely anything is allowed within the arcology, including but not limited to mass [[starvation]], [[slavery]], [[murder]], and [[cannibalism]]. The only time that the Promethians show any interest in the goings-on of Center is when an enemy force tries to take control of the transdimensional spacegates and rifts, or when a conquering force attempts to take over Phase World altogether. On one occasion, the Promethians allowed a [[civil war]] to be waged for two years within Center's confines, killing over thirty million of its inhabitants; the Promethians' only course of action was to selectively apply a series of [[force shield|force fields]] to keep the fighting from reaching the spaceports or from breaking out of Center and spilling out onto the planet's surface. Furthermore, the Promethians are well known for selling their technology to any buyer that can afford it, friend or foe, and in similar fashion neither help nor hinder fugitives that manage to reach Center – or any [[bounty hunter]]s and [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement agents]] that may be pursuing them.

It is strongly implied that the Promethians are concerned first and foremost about cosmic-level threats to the entire Megaverse, such as the effort to keep the [[Old Ones (Palladium Books)|Old Ones]] from waking, and that "little things" like world-spanning wars and "[[morality]]" are simply too much of a distraction from the importance of their universal mission.

Promethians are a notable species in that they are always in a constant state of partial phase – unlike most characters in contemporary literature with the ability to phase – which serves to greatly reduce any damage dealt to them. Furthermore, by using the natural phase powers innate to their species, they can at times opt to completely phase themselves, eliminating any threat to their person by phasing out of sync with the dimension that they're in. This allows them to choose whether to walk through solid matter or to render themselves completely invisible and undetectable by all means, including magic.

The Promethians exist in two forms: namely, first- and second-stage Promethians. First-stage Promethians are {{convert|7|ft|m}} to {{convert|10|ft|m}} tall, are entirely "human" in the range of possible outlooks and alignments, and the natural phase abilities of their bodies renders any force or energies directed against them to cause no more than a point-for-point conversion to "Standard Damage Capacity" (termed S.D.C. in the Palladium game setting), no matter how powerful the originating force.

Those Promethians that manage to survive and pass the Test of Maturity are transformed into larger, more durable versions of their old selves that range from {{convert|15|ft|m}} to {{convert|30|ft|m}} in height. These creatures are immune to S.D.C. weapons; they each gain up to 2,400 points of what is termed "Mega Damage Capacity" (M.D.C.), and all attacks directed at them inflict only one-quarter damage, no matter how powerful the originating force. Second-stage Promethians make up the majority of the Promethians on the planet outside Center (actually, second-stage Promethians are found nowhere else in the Megaverse ''except'' on Phase World), and it is they who are the ones tasked with the universal mission of identifying and countering the greatest threats to the Megaverse. Second-stagers are also the ones who are possessed of "an alien way of thinking"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = C. J. | last1 = Carella |author1-link= C.J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="903">'''Rosenkammaren''' (literally: 'The Rose Chamber') was a [[torture chamber]] in the prison ''[[Nya smedjegården]]'' in [[Stockholm]].

It consisted of a long room, flooded with knee deep water from a spring. The prisoners sentenced to be tortured were chained by a hook from the ceiling in the knee deep water, which was normally icy cold.

On 27 September 1772, [[torture]] was abolished by [[Gustav III of Sweden]], and the Rose Chamber, along with the other torture chamber in the capital, ''[[Tjuvakällaren]]'' in the Town Hall (active 1471-1772), was closed and its equipment destroyed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4882">In [[computational neuroscience]], '''SUPS''' (for '''S'''ynaptic '''U'''pdates '''P'''er '''S'''econd) or formerly CUPS ('''C'''onnections '''U'''pdates '''P'''er '''S'''econd) is a measure of a neuronal network performance, useful in fields of [[neuroscience]], [[cognitive science]], [[artificial intelligence]], and [[computer science]].

==Computing==
For a processor or computer designed to simulate a neural network SUPS is measured as the product of simulated neurons &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; and average connectivity &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;(synapses) per neuron per second:

&lt;math&gt;SUPS = c \times N&lt;/math&gt;

Depending on the type of simulation it is usual equal to the total number of synapses simulated.

In an "asynchronous" dynamic simulation if a neuron spikes at &lt;math&gt;\upsilon&lt;/math&gt; Hz, the average rate of synaptic updates provoked by the activity of that neuron is &lt;math&gt;\upsilon cN&lt;/math&gt;. In a synchronous simulation with step &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; the number of synaptic updates per second would be &lt;math&gt;\frac{cN}{\Delta t}&lt;/math&gt;. As &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; has to be chosen much smaller than the average interval between two successive afferent spikes, which implies &lt;math&gt;\Delta t &lt; \frac{1}{\upsilon N}&lt;/math&gt;, giving an average of synaptic updates equal to &lt;math&gt;\upsilon c N^2&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, spike-driven synaptic dynamics leads to a linear scaling of computational complexity [[Big O notation|O]](N) per neuron, compared with the O(N&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) in the "synchronous" case.&lt;ref name="Mattia1998"&gt;{{cite journal

Developed in the 1980s  Adaptive Solutions' CNAPS-1064 Digital Parallel Processor chip is a full [[Neurochip|neural network (NNW)]]. It was designed as a [[coprocessor]] to a host and has 64 sub-processors arranged in a [[Network topology|1D array]] and operating in a [[SIMD]] mode. Each sub-processor can emulate one or more neurons and multiple chips can be grouped together.

Deputy White House counsel [[Vince Foster|Vincent W. Foster]] was found dead in [[Fort Marcy Park]] off the [[George Washington Parkway]] in [[Virginia]], outside [[Washington, D.C.]], on July 20, 1993. His death was ruled a [[suicide]] by five official investigations,&lt;ref name="wapo_kessler" /&gt; but remains a subject of [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]].

==Suicide and investigation==
Park Police discovered Foster, dead from an apparently self-inflicted gun shot wound to the head, in Fort Marcy Park off the George Washington Parkway in Virginia, on July 20, 1993. Foster was holding a gun in his hand. An autopsy and subsequent investigation later confirmed that Foster had committed suicide by shooting himself once in the mouth with the .38 caliber revolver found at the scene.&lt;ref name="nytimes_labaton"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Labaton|first1=Stephen|title=Autopsy on Counsel to President Points to Suicide|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/06/us/the-budget-struggle-autopsy-on-counsel-to-president-points-to-suicide.html|accessdate=5 August 2017|agency=New York Times|date=1993-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent investigations found that Foster was distraught over accusations and criticisms related to the [[White House travel office controversy|White House Travel Office controversy]]. Foster had confided to friends and colleagues that he was considering resignation, but feared that he could not handle the "personal humiliation" of returning to Arkansas in defeat. Foster admitted to his sister that he was depressed shortly before his death, and he sought treatment for depression one day before committing suicide.&lt;ref name="wapo_drehle"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Von Drehle|first1=David|last2=Schneider|first2=Howard|title=Foster's Death a Suicide|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/whitewater/stories/wwtr940701.htm|accessdate=5 August 2017|agency=Washington Post|date=1994-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although police found no evidence of foul play, several tabloids and right-leaning newsletters speculated that Foster's death may have been a homicide, possibly involving the Clintons themselves.&lt;ref name="Watson_suicide"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Watson|first1=Russell|title=VINCE FOSTER'S SUICIDE: THE RUMOR MILL CHURNS|url=http://www.newsweek.com/vince-fosters-suicide-rumor-mill-churns-185900|accessdate=5 August 2017|publisher=Newsweek|date=1994-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent investigations by special prosecutor [[Robert B. Fiske|Robert Fiske]] and the Senate Banking Committee concluded that there was no evidence of a homicide. A final investigation, led by special prosecutor [[Kenneth Starr]], also concluded that there was no evidence to support the claim that Foster was murdered. Starr's report addressed several additional questions about physical and forensic evidence that had previously fueled speculation about the case. The report established that Foster owned the handgun used in the suicide, and confirmed that the body had not been moved from its position prior to its discovery by police. The report concluded "In sum, based on all of the available evidence, which is considerable, the OIC [Office of Independent Counsel] agrees with the conclusion reached by every official entity that has examined the issue: Mr. Foster committed suicide by gunshot in Fort Marcy Park on July 20, 1993."&lt;ref name="wapo_kessler"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/05/25/no-donald-trump-theres-nothing-fishy-about-vince-fosters-suicide/|title=No, Donald Trump, there's nothing 'fishy' about Vince Foster's suicide|last1=Kessler|first1=Glenn|date=|work=|accessdate=5 August 2017|agency=Washington Post|issue=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The suicide has nevertheless continued to fuel speculation: then-presidential candidate [[Donald Trump]] made news in 2016 when he remarked in an interview with the ''[[Washington Post]]'' that Foster's death was "very fishy", and added "I will say there are people who continue to bring it up because they think it was absolutely a murder. I don't do that because I don't think it's fair."&lt;ref name="wapo_delreal"&gt;{{cite news|last1=DelReal|first1=Jose A.|last2=Costa|first2=Robert|title=Trump escalates attack on Bill Clinton|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-escalates-attack-on-bill-clinton/2016/05/23/ed109acc-2100-11e6-8690-f14ca9de2972_story.html?hpid=hp_rhp-top-table-main_trump-clinton-9pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory|accessdate=5 August 2017|agency=Washington Post|date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A draft of a [[letter of resignation|resignation letter]], was found torn into 27 pieces in a briefcase after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=David|first2=Neil|last1=Johnston|last2=Lewis|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/04/us/report-suggests-clinton-counsel-hampered-suicide-investigation.html?pagewanted=all|title=Report Suggests Clinton Counsel Hampered Suicide Investigation|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=February 4, 1994|accessdate=July 30, 2017|quote=''...One investigator said he had watched Mr. Nussbaum inspect the briefcase earlier without finding the note....''}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The full text of the letter is as follows:

==Conspiracy theories==
===The Arkansas Project===
On May 2, 1999, the ''[[Washington Post]]'' published new details on the pursuit of a Foster conspiracy in an article by [[David Brock]], a key figure in the [[Troopergate (Bill Clinton)|Troopergate]] and [[Whitewater controversy|Whitewater]] scandals whose disillusionment with the political corruption motivating what would come to be known as the [[Arkansas Project]] ended his lifelong commitment to the Conservative movement and facilitated public dissemination of insider details on G.O.P. machinations. The article explains how Brock was "summoned" to a meeting with [[Rex Armistead]] in [[Miami, Florida]] at an airport hotel. Brock claims that Armistead laid out for him an elaborate "Vince Foster murder scenario" – a scenario that he found implausible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/scaifeside050299.htm|title='Arkansas Project' Led to Turmoil and Rifts|journal=Washington Post|date=May 2, 1999|page=A24|accessdate=2006-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Clinton Chronicles'': A Political Firestorm===
Veteran crime reporter [[Dan Moldea]] wrote a book titled ''A Washington Tragedy: How the Death of Vincent Foster Ignited a Political Firestorm''. Moldea was approached in 1997 by Regnery Publishing House, a famously conservative group whose leadership was nevertheless impressed by Moldea's published works, including an exhaustive critique of [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] Detective [[Mark Fuhrman]], another Regnery author.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In researching the debacle created by and surrounding Foster's death, Moldea found that the most oft-used conspiracy scenario could be traced back to Park Police Major Robert Hines, who shared the idea with [[Reed Irvine]] ([[Accuracy in Media]]) and Christopher Ruddy (''[[New York Post]]'').&lt;ref name="rest in peace"&gt;Lori Leibovich, [http://archive.salon.com/news/1998/05/28news.html "Why Vincent Foster can't rest in peace"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513113126/http://archive.salon.com/news/1998/05/28news.html |date=2008-05-13 }}, Salon.com, May 28, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Moldea concludes, and Maj. Hines publicly maintains, that Hines incorrectly told Irvine and Ruddy "... that there is no exit wound in Foster's head ... I don't think there was anything nefarious here; he was being approached by reporters and he wanted something to say."&lt;ref name="rest in peace"/&gt; Still, the "missing" exit wound claim continued to surface.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Moldea's research sought, among other things, to discover the origins of this line of investigation into the Clintons' credibility. In an interview for ''[[Salon.com]]'', he suggests that "Foster had some blond hair and carpet fibers on his suit jacket, and he had [[semen]] in his underwear. So, the [[Jerry Falwell]]s and the right-wing crowd get a hold of this information, and…they start making movies alleging that the Clintons were involved in this murder."&lt;ref name="rest in peace"/&gt;

In 1994, Falwell subsidized the creation of a film called ''[[The Clinton Chronicles]]'' that featured Ruddy's claims that the gun that killed Foster was placed in his hand after the fact, and that Foster's body was laid out to give the appearance of suicide, among others.&lt;ref name="rest in peace"/&gt; Funding for the film was provided by ''Citizens for Honest Government'', an organization to which Falwell gave $200,000 in 1994 and 1995.&lt;ref name="falwell"&gt;[[Murray Waas]][http://www.salon.com/1998/03/11/cov_11news/ The Falwell connection], Salon.com, March 11, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Citizens for Honest Government covertly paid individuals who had provided information to media outlets such as the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' editorial page and the ''[[American Spectator]]'' magazine;"&lt;ref name="falwell"/&gt; and in 1995, made discretionary payments to two Arkansas state troopers who had spoken out in support of the idea of a conspiracy surrounding Foster's death. The two troopers, Roger Perry and Larry Patterson, had also previously given testimony supporting [[Paula Jones]]' claims of sexual misconduct and misuse of government resources against [[Bill Clinton]] (see [[Troopergate (Bill Clinton)|Troopergate]]).&lt;ref name="falwell"/&gt;

Patrick Matrisciana, president of Citizens for Honest Government, produced ''The Clinton Chronicles'' video and appeared in its commercials as an "investigative reporter" where he and Rev. Falwell engaged in the following exchange:&lt;ref name="falwell"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Falwell:'' Could you please tell me and the American people why you think that your life and the lives of the others on this video are in danger? {{parabr}}''Matrisciana:'' Jerry, two weeks ago we had an interview with a man who was an insider; his plane crashed and he was killed an hour before the interview. You may say this is just a coincidence, but there was another fellow that we were also going to interview, and he was killed in a plane crash. Jerry, are these coincidences? I don't think so.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

When asked about the spot, Matrisciana admitted he was not a reporter and replied "I doubt our lives were actually ever in any real danger. That was Jerry's idea to do that ... He thought that would be dramatic."&lt;ref name="falwell"/&gt;

'''Theoretical neuromorphology'''  is the science of using [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] to mathematically describe the shape and the connectivity in the [[nervous system]].

==History==
The rational study of shapes as been long to form. In the major progresses made during the last century, it is important to differentiate morphogenesis (the way forms are made) and morphology (realized forms).

===Morphogenesis===
Important conceptual changes about forms came from [[d'Arcy Thompson]]’s essay (1917) dealing with forms in nature. These were not considered as static but as the result of morphogenetic factors. Not knowable in its intimate nature, form is defined as the simple result of forces. [[René Thom|Thom]] (1974), founder of the "catastrophe theory" acknowledged what he owed to this work. A series of various branches of non-linear  mathematics [[catastrophe theory]], the [[fractal theory]], the theory of "dissipative structures", the [[chaos theory]] have led to what Boutot (1993) called "the morphologic revolution", which has deeply modified the conception of forms in space. Theoretical neuromorphology discards morphogenesis (the way forms have been made) to limit its purpose to realised forms.

===Neuromorphology===
{{Main|Neuromorphology}}
In spite of some results, space and shapes were often not considered as  susceptible of  bringing information on the nervous system functioning. Neuromorphology yet had been intensively studied after the discovery of the [[Golgi's method|Golgi]] method allowing to see entire neurons. This gave rise to an abundant literature, with descriptions and figures. This allowed [[Ramon y Cajal]] (1911) to found definitely the "neuron theory" (the brain is constituted of separate cells that communicate together) and to formulate the law of "dynamic polarization" (axonalwards). With others, he pointed out the variety of patterns of neurons depending on particular cerebral places and already emitted hypotheses on the roles that could be played by particular forms. Several attempts have been made later. One step has been the work of Mannen (1960) on closed and open nuclei reinsisting on dendritic morphology. This was followed by several papers of Ramon-Moliner defining types of neurons according to their dendritic arborisations.

===Formalisation===

An approach of natural forms was proposed by Stevens (1974) who tried to rationally make classification of forms and to find their specific properties and advantages in terms of directness or economy of ways. Since almost one century, an important corpus of theoretical tools, still poorly exploited, has revealed to be very helpful for the understanding of the nervous system. These tools, generally, may be classified as «logical » or more narrowly as « logico-mathematical ». As will be seen,  the most useful for the theoretical neuromorphology, along with geometry for metrical parameters, are the [[set theory]], the [[system theory]], the [[graph theory]].

===Theoretical tools===

===General morphology===
The classic traditional forms were emanating from and could be described by using Euclidean geometry  for instance in relation to the cartesian triedre (one perpendicular axe for three "dimensions"). These forms can have material realisations (cubes, balls..). Many  natural  objects however  cannot be satisfactorily described using the Euclidean geometry. Many of them are for instance fractals ([[Benoît Mandelbrot|Mandelbrot]],1983 ), because they are branched, have holes, or are too anfractuous, etc.. In their case the three dimensions are no more linked linearly. This is particularly true for surfaces and volumes. As already stressed by Stevens (1974) some morphological pattern may offer precise advantages.  An example can be given from two extremes where the surface of objects is fundamental. The surface is the place where objects exchange between an inside and an outside. In the case where the more advantageous is to have the minimal exchange, the chosen shape is generally the ovoid (such are eggs, grains, fruits, cetaceans, etc. with the sphere as the perfect limit), which for a given volume limits the surface to its minimum. When the exchange is fundamental important surface is necessary an aminimal material cost. The binary branching increases considerably the surface without increasing much the volume of matter. This is the case for vegetal trees and vascular, pulmonary, urinary systems. The nervous system may be seen as a system of exchanges between emitting and receiving binary arborizations, offering a huge combinatorial range.

===Identification and classification===
One problem of neuromorphology is because it has not to describe one object, the brain, but an average brain. This justifies an extensive use of statistics.

Tyner (1975) and Rowe and Stone (1977)have analysed the conceptual bases to be respected in the process of neuronal classification. They insisted on the necessity of separating classification and identification.

Classifications must be based on multifactorial techniques and to be hierarchical (following the bicentennial animal taxonomy).
When many namings or identifications were done on the characteristics of the soma, it appeared clear that only a quantitative study of complete dendritic arborisations was able to offer a means for a neutral neuronal taxonomy. A particular kind of a group of neuron in a localized part of the brain in one animal species is called a [[neuronal species]]. When neurons of about the same morphology is observed at the same place in another animal species, it is a [[neuronal genus]]. There are also [[neuronal family|neuronal families]] and so on. For example, spiny neurons of the striatum of macaque are one species. Along with that of man and/or other species they form a genus. Statistical comparisons allow to analyse what remained the same or what has changed in evolution.

Starting from objectively defined neurons, it became possible to constitute neuronal sets.

===Neuronal sets===

====Sets====
«The theory of set underlies virtually every branch of mathematics» (Kahn, 1995). Great changes in the way of analysing and reasoning have been brought by set theory . This starts from simple concepts. For instance «a set is a collection of elements » (Kahn, 1995) which is intuitive and has not to be demonstrated. The elements have in common to be members of the set. A particular set is defined by the common properties of its elements. This raises problems of similarities and finally of typology and classification.

====Neuronal sets====
Neuronal sets may be sets of entire neurons or of neuronal parts.

===Theoretical hodology===

===Neuronal systems===
Our ability to think, react and remember relies on the function of the nervous system. We cannot understand the human brain without first elucidating the properties and function of its main unit elements, the neurons.

These are complex and specialized cells. However, the improved understanding of cellular evolution achieved over the last several years has revealed that even the most sophisticated and unique properties of nerve cells represent an adaptation of basic functions observed in all eukaryotic cells, including unicellular organisms. Thus, cellular neurobiology has become an important chapter of cell biology. Studies of neurons greatly capitalize on progress in fundamental cell biology. Conversely, research on specialized features of neurons is producing major fall-outs in other areas of biology. Projects of cellular neurobiology in the department focus on mechanisms in membrane traffic at the synapse, on the development and maintenance of cell polarity and on the mechanisms responsible for the heterogeneous distribution of organelles and macromolecules within the neuronal cytoplasm. Formation and plasticity of synapses are also investigated. In the tradition of the department, questions in these fields are approached in a multidisciplinary fashion using genetics, protein and lipid biochemistry, molecular biology and state of the art light and electron microscopy imaging techniques. Experimental systems include mouse models, cultured neurons, large model synapses, isolated synaptic preparations and cell free systems. Special emphasis is placed on interfaces between this basic research and disease.

The theory was proposed by Ernest Wever and Charles Bray in 1930&lt;ref name="Wever volley"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wever|first=Ernest|author2=Bray, Charles |title=The Perception of Low Tones and the Resonance-Volley Theory|journal=The Journal of Psychology: Interdisciplinary and Applied|year=1937|volume=3|issue=1|pages=101–114|doi=10.1080/00223980.1937.9917483}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a supplement to the [[temporal theory (hearing)|frequency theory]] of hearing. It was later discovered that this only occurs in response to sounds that are about 500&amp;nbsp;Hz to 5000&amp;nbsp;Hz.

[[File:Volley Principle of Hearing.png|thumb|upright=3.0|Volley Theory of Hearing demonstrated by four neurons firing at a phase-locked frequency to the sound stimulus. The total response corresponds with the stimulus.]]

==Description==
The volley theory was explained in depth in Ernest Wever's 1949 book, Theory of Hearing &lt;ref name="Wever hearing"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wever|first=Ernest|title=Theory of Hearing|year=1949|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groups of neurons in the [[cochlea]] individually fire at subharmonic frequencies of a sound being heard and collectively phase-lock to match the total frequencies of the sound. The reason for this is that neurons can only fire at a maximum of about 500&amp;nbsp;Hz but other theories of hearing did not explain for hearing sounds below about 5000&amp;nbsp;Hz.

[[File:Harmonics.jpg|thumb|left|Harmonic waveform of a fundamental frequency L/2]]

===Harmonic spectrums===
Sounds are often sums of multiple frequency tones. When these frequencies are whole number multiples of a [[fundamental frequency]] they create a [[harmonic]]. When groups of auditory neurons are presented with harmonics, each neuron fires at one frequency and when combined, the entire harmonic is encoded into the [[primary auditory cortex]] of the brain. This is the basis of volley theory.

===Phase-locking===
Phase-locking is known as matching amplitude times to a certain phase of another waveform. In the case of auditory neurons, this means firing an action potential at a certain phase of a stimulus sound being delivered. It has been seen that when being played a [[pure tone]], auditory nerve fibers will fire at the same frequency as the tone.&lt;ref name="Liu phase locking"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liu|first=L.-F.|title=Phase-Locked Responses to Pure Tones in the Inferior Colliculus|journal=Journal of Neurophysiology|date=1 March 2006|volume=95|issue=3|pages=1926–1935|doi=10.1152/jn.00497.2005|pmid=16339005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volley theory suggests that groups of auditory neurons use phase-locking to represent subharmonic frequencies of one harmonic sound. This has been shown in guinea pig and cat models.

In 1980, Don Johnson experimentally revealed phase-locking in the [[cochlear nerve|auditory nerve fibers]] of the adult cat.&lt;ref name="Johnson stimulation"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Don H.|title=The relationship between spike rate and synchrony in responses of auditory-nerve fibers to single tones|journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America|year=1980|volume=68|issue=4|pages=1115|doi=10.1121/1.384982}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the presence of -40 to -100 decibel single tones lasting 15 or 30 seconds, recordings from the auditory nerve fibers showed firing fluctuations in synchrony with the stimulus. Johnson observed that during frequencies below 1000&amp;nbsp;Hz, two peaks are recorded for every cycle of the stimulus, which had varying phases according to stimulation frequency. This phenomenon was interpreted as the result of a second harmonic, phase-locking to the stimulus waveform. However, at frequencies between about 1000&amp;nbsp;Hz and 5000&amp;nbsp;Hz, phase-locking becomes progressively inaccurate and intervals tend to become more random.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trevino|first=Andrea|author2=Coleman, Todd P. |author3=Allen, Jont |title=A dynamical point process model of auditory nerve spiking in response to complex sounds|journal=Journal of Computational Neuroscience|date=8 April 2009|volume=29|issue=1-2|pages=193–201|doi=10.1007/s10827-009-0146-6|pmc=4138954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pitch perception===
[[Pitch (music)|Pitch]] is an assigned, perceptual property where a listener orders sound frequencies from low to high. Pitch is hypothesized to be determined by receiving phase-locked input from neuronal axons and combining that information into harmonics. In simple sounds consisting of one frequency, the pitch is equivalent to the frequency. There are two models of pitch perception; a spectral and a temporal. Low frequency sounds evoke the strongest pitches, suggesting that pitch is based on the temporal components of the sound.&lt;ref name="Yost pitch"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yost|first=W. A.|title=Pitch perception|journal=Attention, Perception, &amp; Psychophysics|date=16 November 2009|volume=71|issue=8|pages=1701–1715|doi=10.3758/APP.71.8.1701}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Historically, there have been many models of pitch perception. (Terhardt, 1974;&lt;ref name="Divenyi pitch"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Divenyi|first=Pierre L.|title=Is pitch a learned attribute of sounds? Two points in support of Terhardt’s pitch theory|journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America|year=1979|volume=66|issue=4|pages=1210|doi=10.1121/1.383317}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldstein, 1973;&lt;ref name="Goldstein pitch" /&gt; Wightman, 1973). Many consisted of a peripheral spectral-analysis stage and a central periodicity-analysis stage. In his model, Terhardt claims that the spectral-analysis output of complex sounds, specifically low frequency ones, is a learned entity which eventually allows easy identification of the virtual pitch.&lt;ref name="Divenyi pitch"/&gt; The volley principle is predominantly seen during the pitch perception of lower frequencies where sounds are often resolved.&lt;ref name="Plomp frequency"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Plomp|first=R.|title=The Ear as a Frequency Analyzer. II|journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America|year=1968|volume=43|issue=4|pages=764|doi=10.1121/1.1910894}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldstein proposed that through phase-locking and temporal frequencies encoded in neuron firing rates, the brain has the itemization of frequencies that can then be used to estimate pitch.&lt;ref name="Goldstein pitch"/&gt;

==Discovery and history==
Throughout the nineteenth century, many theories and concepts of hearing were created. Ernest Wever proposed the volley theory in 1937 with his paper "The Perception of Low Tones and the Resonance-Volley Theory".&lt;ref name="Wever volley" /&gt; In this paper, Wever discusses previous theories of hearing and introduces volley theory using support from his own experiments and research. The theory was introduced as a supplement to the frequency theory or temporal theory of hearing, which was in contrast to the place theory of hearing.

[[File:Anatomy of Human Ear with Cochlear Frequency Mapping.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Anatomy of Human Ear with Cochlear Frequency Mapping]]

===Place theory===
The most prominent figure in the creation of the place theory of hearing is [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], who published his finished theory in 1885. Helmholtz claimed that the cochlea contained individual fibers for analyzing each pitch and delivering that information to the brain. Many followers revised and added to Helmholtz's theory and the consensus soon became that high frequency sounds were encoded near the base of the cochlea and that middle frequency sounds were encoded near the apex. [[Georg von Békésy]] developed a novel method of dissecting the [[inner ear]] and using [[stroboscope|stroboscopic]] illumination to observe the [[basilar membrane]] move, adding evidence to support the theory.&lt;ref name="Finger textbook"&gt;{{cite book|last=Finger|first=Stanley|title=Origins of neuroscience : a history of explorations into brain function|year=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-5146948|edition=N.e.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frequency theory===
Ideas related to the frequency theory of hearing came about in the late 1800s as a result of the research of many individuals. In 1865, [[Heinrich Adolf Rinne]] challenged the place theory; he claimed that it’s not very efficient for complex sounds to be broken into simple sounds then be reconstructed in the brain. Later, Friedrich Voltolini added on by proposing that every auditory hair cell is stimulated by any sound. Correspondingly, [[William Rutherford (physiologist)|William Rutherford]] providing evidence that this hypothesis was true, allowing greater accuracy of the cochlea. In 1886, Rutherford also proposed that the brain interpreted the vibrations of the hair cells and that the cochlea did no frequency or pitch analysis of the sound. Soon after, [[Max Friedrich Meyer]], among other ideas, theorized that nerves would be excited at the same frequency of the stimulus.&lt;ref name="Finger textbook"/&gt;

===Volley theory===
Of the various theories and notions created by Rinne, Rutherford, and their followers, the frequency theory was born. In general, it claimed that all sounds were encoded to the brain by neurons firing at a rate that mimics the frequency of the sound. However, because humans can hear frequencies up to 20,000&amp;nbsp;Hz but neurons cannot fire at these rates, the frequency theory had a major flaw. In an effort to combat this fault, Ernest Wever and Charles Bray, in 1930, proposed the volley theory, claiming that multiple [[neurons]] could fire in a volley to later combine and equal the frequency of the original sound stimulus. Through more research, it was determined that because phase synchrony is only accurate up to about 1000&amp;nbsp;Hz, volley theory cannot account for all frequencies at which we hear.&lt;ref name="Finger textbook"/&gt;

===Present thoughts===
Ultimately, as new methods of studying the inner ear came about, a combination of place theory and frequency theory was adopted. Today, it is widely believed that hearing follows the rules of the frequency theory, including volley theory, at frequencies below 1000&amp;nbsp;Hz and place theory at frequencies above 5000&amp;nbsp;Hz. For sounds with frequencies between 1000 and 5000&amp;nbsp;Hz, both theories come into play so the brain can utilize the basilar membrane location and the rate of the impulse.&lt;ref name="Finger textbook"/&gt;

==Experimental evidence==
[[File:Bad Reichenhall Rückpositiv.jpg|thumb|Organ pipes were often used in early hearing experiments.]]
Due to the invasiveness of most hearing related experiments, it is difficult to use human models in the study of the auditory system. However, many findings have been revealed in cats and guinea pigs. Additionally, there are few ways to study the basilar membrane ''in vivo''.

===Sound Stimuli===
Many revolutionary concepts regarding hearing and encoding sound in the brain were founded in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Various tool were used induce a response in auditory nerves that were to be recorded. Experiments by Helmholtz, Wever, and Bray often involved the use of organ pipes, stretched springs, loaded reeds, lamellas, vibrating forks, beats, and interruption tones to create “clicks”, harmonics, or pure tones.&lt;ref name="Hilali pure tones"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hilali|first=S.|author2=Whitfield, I. C. |title=Responses of the trapezoid body to acoustic stimulation with pure tones.|journal=The Journal of Physiology|date=October 1953|volume=122|issue=1|pages=158–71|doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1953.sp004987|pmc=1366186}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, [[electronic oscillators]] are often used to create sinusoidal or square waves of precise frequencies.

===Electrophysiology===
Attempts to electrically record from the auditory nerve began as early as 1896. Electrodes were placed into the auditory nerve of various animal models to give insight on the rate at which the neurons are firing. In a 1930 experiment involving the auditory nerve of a cat, Wever and Bray found that 100–5000&amp;nbsp;Hz sounds played to the cat produced similar frequency firing in the nerve. This supported the frequency theory and the volley theory.&lt;ref name="Finger textbook"/&gt;

[[File:Haircell frog sacculus.jpg|thumb|left|A hair cell from a frog sacculus.]]

===Stroboscopic illumination===
Pioneered by [[Georg von Békésy]], a method to observe the basilar membrane in action came about in the mid 1900s. Békésy isolated the cochlea from human and animal cadavers and labeled the basilar membrane with silver flakes. This allowed strobe imaging to capture the movement of the membrane as sounds stimulated the hair cells. This led to the solidification of the idea that high frequencies excite the basal end of the cochlea and provided new information that low frequencies excite a large area of the cochlea. This new finding suggested that specialized properties are occurring for high frequency hearing and that low frequencies involve mechanisms explained in the frequency theory.&lt;ref name="Finger textbook"/&gt;

[[File:Illustration of common periodicity of full spectrum and missing fundamental waveforms.jpg|thumb|Illustration of full spectrum and missing fundamental waveforms]]

===Missing fundamental===
A fundamental frequency is the lowest frequency of a harmonic. In some cases, sound can have all the frequencies of a harmonic but be missing the fundamental frequency, this is known as [[missing fundamental]]. When listening to a sound with a missing fundamental, the human brain still receives information for all frequencies, including the fundamental frequency which does not exist in the sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schnupp|first=Jan|title=Auditory neuroscience : making sense of sound|year=2012|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=0262518023|author2=Nelken, Israel|author3=King, Andrew}}&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that sound is encoded by neurons firing at all frequencies of a harmonic, therefore, the neurons must be locked in some way to result in the hearing of one sound.

===Hearing loss and deafness===
Congenital deafness or [[sensorineural hearing loss]] is an often used model for the study of the inner ear regarding pitch perception and theories of hearing in general. Frequency analysis of these individuals’ hearing has given insight on common deviations from normal tuning curves,&lt;ref name="Butts tuning curve"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Butts|first=Daniel A.|author2=Goldman, Mark S. |title=Tuning Curves, Neuronal Variability, and Sensory Coding|journal=PLoS Biology|year=2006|volume=4|issue=4|pages=e92|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040092}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; excitation patterns, and frequency discrimination ranges. By applying pure or complex tones, information on pitch perception can be obtained. In 1983, it was shown that subjects with low frequency sensorineural hearing loss demonstrated abnormal psychophysical tuning curves. Changes in the spatial responses in these subjects showed similar pitch judgment abilities when compared to subjects with normal spatial responses. This was especially true regarding low frequency stimuli. These results suggest that the place theory of hearing does not explain pitch perception at low frequencies, but that the temporal (frequency) theory is more likely. This conclusion is due to the finding that when deprived of basilar membrane place information, these patients still demonstrated normal pitch perception.&lt;ref name="Turner hearing loss"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Turner|first=C|author2=Burns, EM |author3=Nelson, DA |title=Pure tone pitch perception and low-frequency hearing loss.|journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America|date=March 1983|volume=73|issue=3|pages=966–75|pmid=6841823|doi=10.1121/1.389022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Computer models for pitch perception and loudness perception are often used during hearing studies on acoustically impaired subjects.

[[File:Arnold Böcklin - Das Irrlicht -1882.jpeg|thumb|right|An 1882 [[oil painting]] of a will-o'-the-wisp by [[Arnold Böcklin]].]]

In [[folklore]], a '''will-o'-the-wisp''', '''will-o'-wisp''' or '''''ignis fatuus''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈfa.tu.us|pron}}; [[Medieval Latin]] for "foolish fire") is an [[atmospheric ghost light]] seen by travelers at night, especially over [[bog]]s, [[swamp]]s or [[marsh]]es.  The phenomenon is known in English [[folk belief]], [[English folklore]] and much of [[European folklore]] by a variety of names, including '''[[jack-o'-lantern]]''', '''[[friar]]'s lantern''', '''hinkypunk''' and '''hobby lantern''', and is said to mislead travelers by resembling a flickering lamp or [[lantern]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Folk-Lore and Folk-Stories of Wales|first=Marie|last=Trevelyan|location=London|year=1909|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zmYHrsC6cYIC&amp;printsec=frontcover|page=178|accessdate=September 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In literature, will-o'-the-wisp sometimes have a metaphorical meaning, e.g. describing a [[hope]] or goal that leads one on but is impossible to reach, or something one finds sinister and confounding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Will-o'-the-wisp|title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|year=2007|publisher=Houghton Mifflin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Will-o'-the-wisp appear in folk tales and traditional legends of numerous countries and cultures; notable will-o'-the-wisp include [[St. Louis Light]] in [[Saskatchewan]], [[Marfa light]]s of [[Texas]], the [[Naga fireball]]s on the [[Mekong]] in [[Thailand]], and the [[Hessdalen light]] in [[Norway]]. While [[urban legend]]s, folkore, and [[superstition]] typically attribute will-o'-the-wisps to [[ghost]]s, fairies, or elemental spirits, modern science often explains them as natural phenomena such as [[bioluminescence]] or [[chemiluminescence]], caused by the [[oxidation]] of [[phosphine]] (PH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[diphosphane]] (P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), and methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) produced by [[organic compound|organic]] [[decomposition|decay]].

==Etymology==

[[File:Will-o-the-wisp and snake by Hermann Hendrich 1823.jpg|thumb|The Will o' the Wisp and the Snake by [[Hermann Hendrich]] (1854–1931)]]
The term "will-o'-the-wisp" comes from "wisp", a bundle of sticks or paper sometimes used as a torch, and the name "[[William (name)|Will]]", thus meaning "Will of the torch". The term ''jack-o'-lantern'' (Jack of the lantern) originally referred to a will-o'-the-wisp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harper|first=Douglas|url=http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=Jack+o%27lantern|title=Jack o'lantern (n.)|work=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, they are often called "spook-lights", "ghost-lights", or "orbs" by folklorists and [[paranormal]] enthusiasts.&lt;ref name="Wagner"&gt;{{cite web|title=Spooklights: Where to Find Them|first=Stephen|last=Wagner|url=http://paranormal.about.com/library/weekly/aa080601a.htm|work=About.com|accessdate=2007-12-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022153333/http://paranormal.about.com/library/weekly/aa080601a.htm|archivedate=2007-10-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Floyd"&gt;{{cite web|title=Historical Mysteries: Ghostly lights as common as dew in Dixie|first=Randall|last=Floyd|url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/060897/fea_floyd.html|work=[[The Augusta Chronicle]]|year=1997|accessdate=December 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moonslipper.com/ghostlightsandorbs.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311080723/http://www.moonslipper.com/ghostlightsandorbs.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=March 11, 2007|title=Ghost Lights and Orbs|publisher=Moonslipper.com|accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Folk belief attributes the phenomenon to fairies or elemental spirits, explicitly in the term "[[Hob (folklore)|hobby]] lanterns" found in the 19th century [[Denham Tracts]]. In her book ''A Dictionary of Fairies,'' [[Katharine Mary Briggs|K. M. Briggs]] provides an extensive list of other names for the same phenomenon, though the place where they are observed (graveyard, bogs, etc.) influences the naming considerably. When observed in graveyards, they are known as "ghost candles", also a term from the Denham Tracts.

The names ''will-o'-the-wisp'' and ''jack-o'-lantern'' are explained in etiological folk-tales, recorded in many variant forms in [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]], [[England]], [[Wales]], [[Appalachia]], and [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} In these tales, protagonists named either Will or Jack are doomed to haunt the marshes with a light for some misdeed. One version from [[Shropshire]] is recounted by Briggs in ''A Dictionary of Fairies'' and refers to Will the Smith. Will is a wicked blacksmith who is given a second chance by [[Saint Peter]] at the gates of heaven, but leads such a bad life that he ends up being doomed to wander the earth. The Devil provides him with a single burning coal with which to warm himself, which he then uses to lure foolish travellers into the marshes.

An Irish version of the tale has a ne'er-do-well named Drunk Jack or [[Stingy Jack]] who, when the Devil comes to collect his soul, tricks him into turning into a coin, so he can pay for his one last drink. When the Devil obliges, Jack places him in his pocket next to a crucifix, preventing him from returning to his original form. In exchange for his freedom, the Devil grants Jack ten more years of life. When the term expires, the Devil comes to collect his due. But Jack tricks him again by making him climb a tree and then carving a cross underneath, preventing him from climbing down. In exchange for removing the cross, the Devil forgives Jack's debt. However, no one as bad as Jack would ever be allowed into heaven, so Jack is forced upon his death to travel to hell and ask for a place there. The Devil denies him entrance in revenge but grants him an ember from the fires of hell to light his way through the twilight world to which lost souls are forever condemned. Jack places it in a carved turnip to serve as a lantern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Jack-O-Lantern|first=Mark|last=Hoerrner|url=http://www.buzzle.com/articles/history-jacko-lantern-irish-tale-halloween.html |work=buzzle.com|year=2006|accessdate=May 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HISTORY OF THE JACK O’LANTERN AND THE LEGEND OF STINGY JACK|author=Leslie O'Malley|publisher=authenticireland.com|url=https://www.authenticireland.com/blog/history-of-the-jack-olantern-and-the-legend-of-stingy-jack/|accessdate=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another version of the tale is "Willy the Whisp", related in ''Irish Folktales'' by [[Henry Glassie]]. ''Séadna'' by [[Peadar Ua Laoghaire]] is yet another version—and also the first modern novel in the Irish language.

[[Mexico]] has two equivalents as well. In one they are called '''brujas''' (witches), folklore explains will-o-the-wisp to be witches who transformed into these lights. The reason for this, however, varies according to the region. Another explanation refers to the lights as indicators to places where gold or hidden treasures are buried which can be found only with the help of children, in this one they are called '''luces del dinero''' (money lights) or '''luces del tesoro''' (treasure lights).

The swampy area of [[Massachusetts]] known as the [[Bridgewater Triangle]] has folklore of ghostly orbs of light, and there have been modern observations of these ghost-lights in this area as well.

The fi follet (or feu-follet) of [[Louisiana]] is derived from the French [[incubus]]/[[succubus]].  The legend says that the fi follet is a soul sent back from the dead to do God's penance, but instead attacks people for vengeance.  While it mostly takes part in harmless mischievous acts, the fi follet sometimes sucked the blood of children.  Some legends say that it was the soul of a child who died before baptism.&lt;ref name="J._Gordon_Melton"&gt;{{cite book|last=Melton|first=J.

Will-o-the-wisp is a part of the folklore in Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Venezuela and Uruguay.

'''Boi-tatá''' ({{IPA-pt|bojtaˈta}}) is the [[Brazil]]ian equivalent of the will-o'-the-wisp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.terrabrasileira.net/folclore/regioes/3contos/boitata.html|title=O BOITATÁ|trans-title=The BOITATÁ|website=Terrabrasileira.net|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091218220628/http://www.terrabrasileira.net/folclore/regioes/3contos/boitata.html|archivedate=December 18, 2009|accessdate=November 18, 2011|language=pt|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regionally it is called ''Boitatá'', ''Baitatá'', ''Batatá'', ''Bitatá'', ''Batatão'', ''Biatatá'', ''M'boiguaçu'', ''Mboitatá'' and ''Mbaê-Tata''. The name comes from the [[Old Tupi language]] and means "fiery [[Snake|serpent]]" (''mboî tatá''). Its great fiery eyes leave it almost blind by day, but by night, it can see everything. According to [[legend]], '''Boi-tatá''' was a big serpent which survived a great [[Deluge (mythology)|deluge]]. A "boiguaçu" (a cave anaconda) left its cave after the deluge and, in the dark, went through the fields preying on the animals and corpses, eating exclusively its favorite morsel, the eyes. The collected light from the eaten eyes gave "Boitatá" its fiery gaze. Not really a dragon but a giant snake (in the native language, "boa" or "mboi" or "mboa").

In [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]] the will-o'-the-wisp phenomenon is known as '''luz mala''' ''(evil light)'' and is one of the most important myths in both countries' folklore. This phenomenon is quite feared and is mostly seen in [[rural areas]]. It consists of an extremely shiny ball of light floating a few inches from the ground.

In [[Colombia]], '''La Candileja''' is the will-o-the-wisp ghost of a vicious grandmother who raised her grandchildren without morals, and as such they became thieves and murderers. In the afterlife the grandmother's spirit was condemned to wander the world surrounded in flames.

'''Aleya''' (or '''marsh ghost-light''') is the name given to a strange light phenomena occurring over the marshes as observed by [[Bengali people|Bengalis]], especially the fishermen of [[West Bengal]] and [[Bangladesh]]. This marsh light is attributed to some kind of marsh gas apparitions that confuse fishermen, make them lose their bearings, and may even lead to drowning if one decided to follow them moving over the marshes. Local communities in the region believe that these strange hovering marsh-lights are in fact Ghost-lights representing the ghosts of fisherman who died fishing. Sometimes they confuse the fishermen, and sometimes they help them avoid future dangers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pak-times.com/2009/04/07/bengali-ghosts/|title=Bengali Ghosts|first=Ambarish|last=Pandey|work=[[Pakistan Times]]|date=April 7, 2009|accessdate=November 18, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111025215051/http://www.pak-times.com/2009/04/07/bengali-ghosts/|archivedate=October 25, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://booksobsession.blogspot.com/2009/10/hbt-guest-post-with-author-saundra.html|title=Blog post by the author Saundra Mitchel of the novel "Shadowed Summer" at Books Obsession|website=Booksobsession.blogspot.com|date=October 9, 2009 |accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar phenomena are described in Japanese folklore, including '''[[Hitodama]]''' (literally "Human Soul" as a ball of energy), Hi no Tama (Ball of Flame), Aburagae, Koemonbi, Ushionibi, etc. All these phenomena are described as balls of flame or light, at times associated with graveyards, but occurring across Japan as a whole in a wide variety of situations and locations. [[Kitsune]], mythical [[yokai]] demons, are also associated with will 'o the wisp, with the marriage of two kitsune producing  kitsune-bi (狐火), literally meaning 'fox-fire'.&lt;ref&gt;Lombardi, Linda.

===Europe===
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}
{{See also|Supernatural beings in Slavic folklore}}

In European folklore, these lights are believed to be spirits of the dead, fairies, or a variety of other [[supernatural]] beings which attempt to lead travelers to their demise. Sometimes the lights are believed to be the spirits of unbaptized or stillborn children, flitting between heaven and hell.

In [[Sweden]], the will-o'-the-wisp represents the [[soul]] of an [[baptism|unbaptized]] person "trying to lead travellers to water in the hope of being baptized".&lt;ref&gt;The Element Encyclopedia of Vampires (Theresa Cheung), HarperCollins&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=May 2016}}

[[Danish people|Danes]], [[Finns]], [[Swedish people|Swedes]], [[Estonians]], [[Latvians]], [[Lithuanians]], and Irish people and amongst some other groups believed that a will-o'-the-wisp also marked the location of a treasure deep in ground or water, which could be taken only when the fire was there. Sometimes magical tricks, and even [[Hand of Glory|dead man's hand]], were required as well, to uncover the treasure. In Finland and several other northern countries, it was believed that early autumn was the best time to search for will-o'-the-wisps and treasures below them. It was believed that when someone hid treasure, in the ground, he made the treasure available only at the [[Midsummer|Saint John's Day]], and set will-o'-the-wisp to mark the exact place and time so that he could come to take the treasure back. For then he could be fulfilled with treasures.

The '''Aarnivalkea''', in [[Finnish mythology]], are spots where an eternal flame associated with will o' the wisps burns. They are claimed to mark the places where [[faerie]] [[gold]] is buried. They are protected by a [[Glamour (presentation)|glamour]] that would prevent anyone finding them by pure chance. However, if one finds a fern seed from a mythical flowering [[fern]], the magical properties of that seed will lead the fortunate person to these treasures, in addition to providing one with a glamour of invisibility. Since in reality the fern produces no flower and reproduces via spores under the leaves, the myth specifies that it blooms only extremely rarely.

====Britain====
{{See also|Puck (mythology)}}
The will-o'-the-wisp can be found in numerous folk tales around the [[United Kingdom]], and is often a malicious character in the stories. In [[Welsh language|Welsh]] folklore, it is said that the light is "fairy fire" held in the hand of a [[púca]], or pwca, a small goblin-like fairy that mischievously leads lone travellers off the beaten path at night. As the traveller follows the púca through the marsh or bog, the fire is extinguished, leaving them lost. The púca is said to be one of the [[Tylwyth Teg]], or fairy family. In Wales the light predicts a funeral that will take place soon in the locality. [[Wirt Sikes]] in his book ''British Goblins'' mentions the following [[Welsh mythology|Welsh]] tale about púca.

A peasant travelling home at dusk sees a bright light traveling along ahead of him. Looking closer, he sees that the light is a lantern held by a "dusky little figure", which he follows for several miles. All of a sudden he finds himself standing on the edge of a vast chasm with a roaring torrent of water rushing below him. At that precise moment the lantern-carrier leaps across the gap, lifts the light high over its head, lets out a malicious laugh and blows out the light, leaving the poor peasant a long way from home, standing in pitch darkness at the edge of a precipice. This is a fairly common cautionary tale concerning the phenomenon; however, the ignis fatuus was not always considered dangerous. There are some tales told about the will-o'-the-wisp being guardians of treasure, much like the Irish [[leprechaun]] leading those brave enough to follow them to sure riches. Other stories tell of travelers getting lost in the woodland and coming upon a will-o'-the-wisp, and depending on how they treated the will-o'-the-wisp, the spirit would either get them lost further in the woods or guide them out.

Also related, the '''Pixy-light''' from [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]] is most often associated with the [[Pixie]] who often has "[[Fairy path|pixie-led]]" travellers away from the safe and reliable route and into the bogs with glowing lights. "Like [[Poltergeist]] they can generate uncanny sounds. They were less serious than their German [[Weisse Frauen]] kin, frequently blowing out candles on unsuspecting courting couples or producing obscene kissing sounds, which were always misinterpreted by parents."&lt;ref&gt;[http://rodneymackay.com/writing/pdf%20files/worldmyth.pdf] [[Portable Document Format|PDF]]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225001000/http://rodneymackay.com/writing/pdf%20files/worldmyth.pdf|date=February 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pixy-Light was also associated with "lambent light"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alphadictionary.com/goodword/word/lambent|title=lambent - alphaDictionary * Free English On-line Dictionary |publisher=Alphadictionary.com|accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which the [[Old Norse]] might have seen guarding their tombs. In Cornish folklore, Pixy-Light also has associations with the [[Colt pixie]]. "A colt pixie is a pixie that has taken the shape of a horse and enjoys playing tricks such as neighing at the other horses to lead them astray".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Shadowdrake.com|url=http://www.shadowdrake.com/waterhorse.html|title=House Shadow Drake - Water Horses and Other Fairy Steeds|accessdate=November 18, 2011|archivedate=September 27, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927144745/http://www.shadowdrake.com/waterhorse.html|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pandius.com/coltpixy.html|title=Colypixy|website=Pandius.com|accessdate= November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Guernsey]], the light is known as the ''faeu boulanger'' (rolling fire), and is believed to be a lost soul. On being confronted with the spectre, tradition prescribes two remedies. The first is to turn one's cap or coat inside out. This has the effect of stopping the faeu boulanger in its tracks. The other solution is to stick a knife into the ground, blade up. The faeu, in an attempt to kill itself, will attack the blade.&lt;ref&gt;Folklore of Guernsey by Marie de Garis (1986) ASIN: B0000EE6P8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The will-o'-the-wisp was also known as the '''Spunkie''' in the [[Scottish Highlands]] where it would take the form of a [[linkboy]] (a boy who carried a flaming torch to light the way for pedestrians in exchange for a fee), or else simply a light that always seemed to recede, in order to lead unwary travelers to their doom.&lt;ref name=Stewart&gt;William Grant Stewart (1823). ''The Popular Superstitions and Festive Amusements of the Highlanders of Scotland''. pp.161-162.&lt;/ref&gt; The spunkie has also been blamed for shipwrecks at night after being spotted on land and mistaken for a harbor light.&lt;ref name=Briggs&gt;Katharine Briggs (1976). ''An Encyclopedia of Fairies''. [[Pantheon Books]]. p. 381. {{ISBN|0-394-40918-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other tales of Scottish folklore regard these mysterious lights as omens of death or the ghosts of once living human beings. They often appeared over lochs &lt;ref name=Alasdair&gt;Alasdair Alpin MacGregor (1937). ''The Peat Fire Flame: Folktales and Traditions of the Highlands and Islands''.

==Natural explanations==

In modern science, it is generally accepted that will-o'-the-wisp phenomena (ignis fatuus) are caused by the [[oxidation]] of [[phosphine]] (PH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[diphosphane]] (P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), and methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). These compounds, produced by [[organic compound|organic]] [[Decomposition|decay]], can cause [[photon]] emissions. Since phosphine and diphosphane mixtures spontaneously ignite on contact with the oxygen in air, only small quantities of it would be needed to ignite the much more abundant methane to create ephemeral fires.&lt;ref name="roels2001"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Joris Roels &amp; Willy Verstrae|year=2001|title=Biological formation of volatile phosphorus compounds|journal=Bioresource Technology|volume=79|pages=243&amp;ndash;250|publisher=Elsevier|url=http://www.calstatela.edu/faculty/ckhachi/phosphorous/Roels_2001.pdf|doi=10.1016/S0960-8524(01)00032-3|pmid=11499578|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060919012514/http://www.calstatela.edu/faculty/ckhachi/phosphorous/Roels_2001.pdf|archivedate=2006-09-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, phosphine produces [[phosphorus pentoxide]] as a by-product, which forms [[phosphoric acid]] upon contact with water vapor, which can explain "viscous moisture" sometimes described as accompanying ignis fatuus.

In 1776, [[Alessandro Volta]] first proposed that natural electrical phenomena (like [[lightning]]) interacting with [[methane]] marsh gas may be the cause of ignis fatuus.&lt;ref name="volta"&gt;{{cite book|first=Marco|last=Ciardi|editor =Fabio Bevilacqua &amp; Lucio Fregonese|title =Nuova Voltiana: Studies on Volta and His Times|chapter =Falling Stars, Instruments and Myths: Volta and the Birth of Modern Meteorology|publisher =Editore Ulrico Hoepli|year =2000|page=43|url =http://ppp.unipv.it/Collana/Pages/Libri/Saggi/Nuova%20Voltiana3_PDF/cap2/2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was supported by the British [[polymath]] [[Joseph Priestley]] in his series of works ''[[Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air]]'' (1772–1790); and by the French physicist [[Pierre Bertholon de Saint-Lazare]] in ''De l’électricité des météores'' (1787).&lt;ref name=tomlinson&gt;{{cite journal|first=Charles|last=Tomlinson|publisher= Witherby &amp; Co.|year=1893|title=On Certain Low-Lying Meteors|editor=A. Cowper Ranyard|journal=[[Knowledge (magazine)|Knowledge: An Illustrated Magazine of Science. Simply Worded&amp;mdash;Exactly Described]]|volume=16|issue=New Series, Vol. III|pages=46&amp;ndash;48|url=https://archive.org/details/knowledgev140nov16londuoft |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early critics of the marsh gas hypothesis often dismissed it on various grounds including the unlikeliness of spontaneous combustion, the absence of warmth in some observed ignis fatuus, the odd behavior of ignis fatuus receding upon being approached, and the differing accounts of [[ball lightning]] (which was also classified as a kind of ignis fatuus).&lt;ref name=tomlinson/&gt; An example of such criticism is the following by the American anthropologist [[John G. Owens]] in ''Folk-Lore from Buffalo Valley'' (1891):

&lt;blockquote&gt;This is a name that is sometimes applied to a phenomenon perhaps more frequently called Jack-o'-the-Lantern, or Will-o'-the-Wisp. It seems to be a ball of fire, varying in size from that of a candle-flame to that of a man's head. It is generally observed in damp, marshy places, moving to and fro; but it has been known to stand perfectly still and send off scintillations. As you approach it, it will move on, keeping just beyond your reach; if you retire, it will follow you. That these fireballs do occur, and that they will repeat your motion, seems to be established, but no satisfactory explanation has yet been offered that I have heard. Those who are less superstitious say that it is the ignition of the gases rising from the marsh. But how a light produced from burning gas could have the form described and move as described, advancing as you advance, receding as you recede, and at other times remaining stationary, without having any visible connection with the earth, is not clear to me.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Owens J.G. | year = 1891 | title = Folk-Lore from Buffalo Valley | url = | journal = Journal of American Folk-Lore | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 123–4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, the apparent retreat of ignis fatuus upon being approached might be explained simply by the agitation of the air by nearby moving objects, causing the gases to disperse. This was observed in the very detailed accounts of several close interactions with ignis fatuus published earlier in 1832 by Major Louis Blesson after a series of experiments in various localities where they were known to occur.&lt;ref name="blesson"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Louis|last=Blesson|year=1832–1833|title=Observations on the Ignis Fatuus, or Will-with-the-Wisp, Falling Stars, and Thunder Storms|journal=The Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal|volume=14|pages=90&amp;ndash;94|publisher=Neill &amp; Company|url=http://inamidst.com/lights/wisp/blesson1832}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of note is his first encounter with ignis fatuus in a marshland between a deep valley in the forest of Gorbitz, [[Neumark|Newmark]], Germany. Blesson observed that the water was covered by an iridescent film, and during day-time, bubbles could be observed rising abundantly from certain areas. At night, Blesson observed bluish-purple flames in the same areas and concluded that it was connected to the rising gas. He spent several days investigating the phenomenon, finding to his dismay that the flames retreated every time he tried to approach them. He eventually succeeded and was able to confirm that the lights were indeed caused by ignited gas. The British scientist [[Charles Tomlinson (scientist)|Charles Tomlinson]] in ''On Certain Low-Lying Meteors'' (1893) describes Blesson's experiments as thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;On visiting the spot at night, the sensitive flames retired as the major advanced; but on standing quite still, they returned, and he tried to light a piece of paper at them, but the current of air produced by his breath kept them at too great a distance. On turning away his head, and screening his breath, he succeeded in setting fire to the paper. He was also able to extinguish the flame by driving it before him to a part of the ground where no gas was produced; then applying a flame to the place whence the gas issued, a kind of explosion was heard over eight or nine square feet of the marsh; a red light was seen, which faded to a blue flame about three feet high, and this continued to burn with an unsteady motion. As the morning dawned the flames became pale, and they seemed to approach nearer and nearer to the earth, until at last they faded from sight.&lt;ref name=tomlinson/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Blesson also observed differences in the color and heat of the flames in different marshes. The ignis fatuus in Malapane, [[Upper Silesia]] (now [[Ozimek]], [[Poland]]) could be ignited and extinguished, but were unable to burn pieces of paper or wood shavings. Similarly, the ignis fatuus in another forest in Poland coated pieces of paper and wood shavings with an oily viscous fluid instead of burning them. Blesson also accidentally created ignis fatuus in the marshes of [[Porta Westfalica]], Germany, while launching [[fireworks]].&lt;ref name=tomlinson/&gt;&lt;ref name=blesson/&gt;

One attempt to replicate ignis fatuus under laboratory conditions was in 1980 by British geologist Alan A. Mills of [[Leicester University]]. Though he did succeed in creating a cool glowing cloud by mixing crude phosphine and natural gas, the color of the light was green and it produced copious amounts of acrid smoke. This was contrary to most eyewitness accounts of ignis fatuus.&lt;ref name="mills"&gt;{{cite journal|author=A. A. Mills|year=2000|title=Will-o'-the-wisp revisited|journal=Weather|volume=55|issue=7|pages=20&amp;ndash;26|publisher=[[Royal Meteorological Society]]|doi=10.1002/j.1477-8696.2000.tb04067.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.1477-8696.2000.tb04067.x/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=paleo/&gt; As an alternative, Mills proposed in 2000 that ignis fatuus may instead be [[Cool flame|cold flame]]s.&lt;ref name=mills/&gt;&lt;ref name=garl/&gt; These are luminescent pre-combustion halos that occur when various compounds are heated to just below [[ignition point]]. Cold flames are indeed typically bluish in color and as their name suggests, they generate very little heat. Cold flames occur in a wide variety of compounds, including [[hydrocarbons]] (including methane), [[alcohols]], [[aldehydes]], [[oils]], [[acids]], and even [[waxes]]. However it is unknown if cold flames occur naturally, though a lot of compounds which exhibit cold flames are the natural byproducts of organic decay.&lt;ref name="mills"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nasa&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BwKdl5NHALUC&amp;pg=PA142|title=Cool Flames and Autoignition: Thermal-Ingnition Theory of Combustion Experimentally Validated in Microgravity|last=Pearlman|first=Howard|author2=Chapek, Richard M.|year=1999|publisher=[[NASA]]|page=142|isbn=1-4289-1823-X}}, [http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/RT/RT1999/6000/6711wu.html Web version at NASA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100501223626/http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/RT/RT1999/6000/6711wu.html |date=2010-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related hypothesis involves the natural [[chemiluminescence]] of phosphine. In 2008, the Italian chemists Luigi Garlaschelli and Paolo Boschetti attempted to recreate Mills' experiments. They successfully created a faint cool light by mixing phosphine with air and nitrogen. Though the glow was still greenish in color, Garlaschelli and Boschetti noted that under low-light conditions, the human eye cannot easily distinguish between colors. Furthermore, by adjusting the concentrations of the gases and the environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, etc.), it was possible to eliminate the smoke and smell, or at least render it to undetectable levels. Garlaschelli and Boschetti also agreed with Mills that cold flames may also be a plausible explanation for other instances of ignis fatuus.&lt;ref name="garl"&gt;{{cite book|author=Luigi Garlaschelli &amp; Paolo Boschetti|title=On the track of the will-o'-the-wisp|publisher=Dipartimento di Chimica Organica, Università di Pavia|url=https://44cc653b-a-62cb3a1a-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/luigigarlaschelli/WILLOWISexperiments.pdf?attachauth=ANoY7cpHRffGlOiCwYxPlrtxd2lTvwsEAMQGgBpRGfI7Y-FSRb5um5lKbRMP0MRniEcJQNazW1rv21_sSUv0z7rcprszClTsadRbFE9Xxy71H_KwKf664KGyQh4qSTmVURo7yIbcG-UcqktElznNxbFHiFZam7ecLQ5N84AxbnmVOkSFpPCDVt4dGztZ6nrMoge0hmnLMmTcRKu7R2IjvyKV2bpVc41_YKLiXIUHE12qr2wabmq33J8%3D&amp;attredirects=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, professors Derr and Persinger proposed that some ignis fatuus may be geologic in origin, [[piezoelectric]]ally generated under [[tectonics|tectonic]] strain. The strains that move faults would also heat up the rocks, vaporizing the water in them. Rock or soil containing something piezoelectric, like [[quartz]], [[silicon]], or [[arsenic]], may also produce [[electricity]], channeled up to the surface through the soil via a column of vaporized water, there somehow appearing as earth lights. This would explain why the lights appear electrical, erratic, or even intelligent in their behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Persinger|first=Michael A.|authorlink=Michael Persinger|title=Perceptual and Motor Skills|series="Geophysical variables and behavior: LXXIV. Man-made fluid injections into the crust and reports of luminous phenomena (UFO Reports)&amp;nbsp;— Is the strain field an aseismically propagating hydrological pulse?"|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Derr|first=J.S.|authorlink=J.S. Derr|title=Perceptual and Motor Skills|series="Seasonal hydrological load and regional luminous phenomena (UFO reports) within river systems: the Mississippi Valley test."|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The will-o'-the-wisp phenomena may occur due to the [[bioluminescence]] of various forest dwelling micro-organisms and insects.  The eerie glow emitted from certain fungal species, such as the [[honey fungus]], during chemical reactions to form white rot could be mistaken for the mysterious will-o'-the-wisp or [[foxfire]] lights.  There are many other bioluminescent organisms that could create the illusions of fairy lights, such as [[fireflies]].  Light reflecting off larger forest dwelling creatures could explain the phenomena of will-o'-the-wisp moving and reacting to other lights.  The white plumage of [[Barn owl]]s may reflect enough light from the moon to appear as a will-o'-the-wisp; hence the possibility of the lights moving, reacting to other lights, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.owlpages.com/articles.php?section=Studies+and+Papers&amp;title=Min+Min A Review of accounts of luminosity in Barn Owls ''Tyto alba''].&lt;/ref&gt;

Ignis fatuus sightings are rarely reported today. The decline is believed to be the result of the draining and reclamation of swamplands in recent centuries, such as the formerly vast [[The Fens|Fenlands]] of eastern England which have now been converted to farmlands.&lt;ref name="paleo"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Jan|last=Zalasiewicz|year=2007|editor=Richard Twitchett|title=The spirit of biodiversity|journal=The Paleontology Newsletter|issue=64|pages=20&amp;ndash;26|url=http://newsletter.palass-pubs.org/pdf/News64.pdf|archivedate=July 27, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727184243/http://newsletter.palass-pubs.org/pdf/News64.pdf|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William John Wills''' (5 January 1834 &amp;ndash; c.June/July 1861) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Surveying|surveyor]] who also trained as a surgeon. He achieved fame as the second-in-command of the ill-fated [[Burke and Wills expedition]], which was the first expedition to cross [[Australia]] from south to north, finding a route across the continent from the settled areas of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] to the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]].

==Early years==
Wills was born in [[Totnes]] in [[Devon]], the second child to Dr William Wills (bap 21 November 1790 Totnes, Devon &amp;ndash; 28 September 1889) and Sarah Mary Elizabeth Wills (née Calley, 23 December 1800, bap 12 March 1801 Totnes, Devon &amp;ndash; 19 February 1880). He was baptised in Totnes on 5 January 1834 in Totnes, and was one of seven children.

He lived at the family home at [[Ipplepen]] and as a young child he contracted a fever which left him with "slow and hesitating speech".&lt;ref name=ADB&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A060444b.htm |title=Wills, William John (1834 - 1861) |accessdate=8 September 2007 |author=Ian F. McLaren |work=[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]], Volume 6 |publisher=[[Melbourne University Press|MUP]] |year=1976 |pages=410–411 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070619083218/http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A060444b.htm |archivedate=19 June 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was home-tutored by his father until the age of 11 and then from 1845 to 1850 he attended St Andrew's Grammar School, [[Ashburton, Devon|Ashburton]]. He was then articled to Wills' surgical practice. In 1852 he studied practical chemistry under [[John Stenhouse]] at [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]] in [[London]].

==Australia==
Dr Wills bought a share in the ''Melbourne Gold Mining Company'' in 1852 and planned to migrate to [[Australia]] with William and Thomas. However Sarah Wills objected to him leaving so Dr Wills delayed his departure and the two boys went alone. Eighteen-year-old William and fifteen-year-old Thomas left [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]] on 1 October 1852 aboard the ''Janet Mitchell''. They arrived in [[Melbourne]] on  3 January 1853 with 197 fellow unassisted passengers. William and Thomas found accommodation at the Immigrants Home in [[South Melbourne, Victoria|South Melbourne]].

In February 1853 the Wills brothers found work as shepherds at a property owned by the ''Royal Bank Company'' on the [[Edward River]] near [[Deniliquin]]. They were paid £30 p.a. plus rations and were in charge of a flock of 1300 rams at the ''Ram Station''. Dr Wills followed his sons out to Australia, arriving in August 1853, and the three returned to [[Melbourne]] before moving to [[Ballarat, Victoria|Ballarat]] where William took up work as a digger on the goldfields. In 1854 he worked as assistant surgeon in his father's practice and later he opened his own gold office. 

In early 1855, William worked on William Skene's ''Kanawalla Station'' (Hensley Park) on the [[Wannon River]] near [[Hamilton, Victoria|Hamilton]]. He returned to [[Ballarat, Victoria|Ballarat]] in April 1855 and towards the end of the year he began to study [[surveying]]. He was appointed as an amateur to the office of John Hamlet Taylor, Acting District Surveyor in the [[Ballarat]] Survey Office on Sturt Street. William spent several months learning trigonometry, Euclid drawing and geometry and then in 1856 he went on to learn field-surveying. He started his practical experience at Glendaruel, near Tourello, where he worked under the supervision of Frederick John Byerly, Assistant Surveyor, on ₤150 p.a. plus board. In February 1857 he was working at Bullarook Creek Camp and in March 1857 he was surveying at Kingower near [[Inglewood, Victoria|Inglewood]]. In the middle of 1857 he was promoted to foreman and placed in charge of a field party and his salary increased to ₤185 p.a. From April to June 1858 he was surveying at [[St Arnaud, Victoria|St Arnaud]]. His field party contract was terminated in June and he returned to Ballarat in July and took occasional contracts surveying for [[Clement Hodgkinson]], the Deputy Surveyor General.

Wills moved to [[Melbourne]] in August 1858 and from August to December he lodged with Mrs E Henderson at 1 Dorcas Street, [[South Melbourne, Victoria|South Melbourne]]. In November 1858 he received a temporary appointment on the recommendation of [[Charles Whybrow Ligar]], [[Surveyor General of Victoria|Surveyor-General]], as a [[wikt:supernumerary|supernumerary]] at the recently established [[Melbourne Observatory|Magnetic Observatory]] which was then at [[Flagstaff Hill, Melbourne|Flagstaff Hill]]. In February 1859 one of the Observatory assistants, John Walter Osborne (1828-1902), transferred from the observatory to become a [[Photozincography|photolithographer]] in the Survey Department of the Office of Crown Lands and Survey. Wills' replaced him, and in March 1859 when his permanent appointment was confirmed, he moved into a room at the Observatory. Wills studied under Government Meteorologist and Observatory Director, [[Georg von Neumayer]], and his work companions were Jacob Bauer, Charles E Pickering, Charles Moerlin and supernumeries John Osborne and [[Edwin James Welch]].

== Burke and Wills expedition ==
{{main|Burke and Wills expedition}}
[[Robert O'Hara Burke]] was appointed leader of the [[Burke and Wills expedition|Victorian Exploring Expedition]] with George James Landells as second-in-command. Wills was appointed third-in-command, [[Surveyor (surveying)|surveyor]], [[Celestial navigation|astronomical]] and [[Meteorologist|meteorological]] observer in July 1860 on a salary of £300 a year.&lt;ref name="phoenix"&gt;{{cite book|last=Phoenix|first=Dave|title=Following Burke and Wills across Victoria : a touring guide|publisher=Phoenix|year=2011|isbn=978-0-646-56419-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The expedition left Melbourne on Monday, 20 August 1860 with a total of 19 men, 27 camels and 23 horses. They reached [[Menindee, New South Wales|Menindee]] on 16 October 1860 where Landells resigned following an argument with Burke. Wills was promoted to second-in-command.

Burke split the expedition at Menindee and the lead party reached [[Cooper Creek]] on 11 November 1860 where they formed a depot. The remaining men were expected to follow up from Menindee and so after a break, Burke decided to make a dash to the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]]. Burke split the party again and left on 16 December 1860, placing [[William Brahe]] in charge of the depot on Cooper Creek. Burke, Wills, [[John King (explorer)|John King]] and Charley Gray reached the [[mangrove]]s on the estuary of the [[Flinders River]], near where the town of [[Normanton, Queensland|Normanton]] now stands, on 9 February 1861. Flooding rains and swamps meant they never saw open ocean. 

Already weakened by starvation and exposure, progress on the return journey was slow and hampered by the tropical monsoon downpours of the wet season. Gray died four days before they reached the depot at Cooper Creek and the other three took a day to bury him. They eventually reached the depot on 21 April 1861 to find the men had not arrived from Menindee, and that Brahe and the Depot Party had given up waiting and left just 9 hours earlier. Brahe had already waited 18 weeks for their return (he and Burke had agreed to 13 weeks) and had buried a note and some food underneath a tree which is now known as the ''Dig Tree''.

Burke, Wills and King attempted to reach Mount Hopeless, the furthest extent of settlement in South Australia, which was closer than Menindee (the route preferred by Wills),&lt;ref name=DAB&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks15/1500721h/0-dict-biogWe-Wy.html#wills1 |title=Wills, William John |accessdate=8 September 2007 |author=[[Percival Serle]] |work=[[Dictionary of Australian Biography]] |publisher=Angus &amp; Robertson |year=1949 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150726174806/http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks15/1500721h/0-dict-biogWe-Wy.html#wills1 |archivedate=26 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but failed and returned to Cooper Creek. While waiting for rescue Wills became exhausted and was unable to continue. He urged Burke and King to continue on, leaving him alone with food, water and shelter. Wills died alone at a place called Breerily Waterhole on Cooper Creek in [[South Australia]]. Burke died soon after. The exact date of their deaths is unknown, but has generally been accepted to be 28 June 1861.

King survived with the help of [[Indigenous Australians|Aborigines]] until he was rescued in September by [[Alfred William Howitt]]. Howitt buried Burke and Wills before returning to Melbourne. In 1862 Howitt returned to Cooper Creek and disinterred Burke and Wills' bodies, taking them first to Adelaide and then by steamer to Melbourne where they were laid in state for two weeks. On 23 January 1863 Burke and Wills received a State Funeral and were buried in Melbourne General Cemetery.

A monument to Wills is located in [[Totnes]], [[Devon]].&lt;ref name=DAB/&gt;
