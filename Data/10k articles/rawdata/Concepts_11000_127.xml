      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13772">The '''2R hypothesis''' or '''Ohno's hypothesis''', first proposed by [[Susumu Ohno]] in 1970,&lt;ref name=Ohno70&gt;Ohno, Susumu (1970). ''Evolution by Gene Duplication.'' London: Allen and Unwin, {{ISBN|0-04-575015-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[hypothesis]] that the genomes of the early [[vertebrate]] lineage underwent two complete [[genome duplication]]s, and thus modern vertebrate genomes reflect [[paleopolyploidy]].  The name derives from the '''''2 r'''ounds'' of duplication originally hypothesized by Ohno, but refined in a 1994 version, and the term ''2R hypothesis'' was probably coined in 1999. Variations in the number and timings of genome duplications typically still are referred to as examples of the 2R hypothesis.&lt;ref name=Hokamp&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hokamp | first1 = K | last2 = McLysaght | first2 = A | last3 = Wolfe | first3 = KH|authorlink3=Kenneth H. Wolfe|authorlink2=Aoife McLysaght | title = The 2R hypothesis and the human genome sequence | journal = Journal of Structural and Functional Genomics | volume = 3 | issue = 1–4 | pages = 95–110 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12836689 | doi = 10.1023/A:1022661917301 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2R hypothesis has been the subject of much research and controversy; however, with growing support from genome data, including the [[human genome]], the balance of opinion has shifted strongly in favour of support for the hypothesis. According to Karsten Hokamp, [[Aoife McLysaght]] and [[Kenneth H. Wolfe]],&lt;ref name=Hokamp/&gt; the version of the genome duplication hypothesis from which 2R hypothesis takes its name appears in Holland ''et al.''&lt;ref name=Holland&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holland | first1 = PW | last2 = Garcia-Fernàndez | first2 = J | last3 = Williams | first3 = NA | last4 = Sidow | first4 = A | title = Gene duplications and the origins of vertebrate development | journal = Development. Supplement | pages = 125–33 | year = 1994 | pmid = 7579513 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the term was coined by Austin L. Hughes.&lt;ref name=Hughes&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hughes | first1 = Austin L. | title = Phylogenies of developmentally important proteins do not support the hypothesis of two rounds of genome duplication early in vertebrate history | journal = [[Journal of Molecular Evolution]] | volume = 48 | issue = 5 | pages = 565–76 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10198122 | doi = 10.1007/PL00006499 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ohno's argument==
Ohno presented the first version of the 2R hypothesis as part of his larger argument for the general importance of [[gene duplication]] in [[evolution]].  Based on relative genome sizes and [[isozyme]] analysis, he suggested that ancestral fish or amphibians had undergone at least one and possibly more cases of "tetraploid evolution". He later added to this argument the evidence that most [[paralogous genes]] in vertebrates do not demonstrate [[genetic linkage]].  Ohno argued that linkage should be expected in the case of individual [[tandem duplications]] (in which a duplicate gene is added adjacent to the original gene on the same chromosome), but not in the case of chromosome duplications.&lt;ref name=Makalowski&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Makalowski | first1 = Wojciech | title = Are we polyploids? A brief history of one hypothesis | journal = [[Genome Research]] | volume = 11 | issue = 5 | pages = 667–70 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11337465 | doi = 10.1101/gr.188801 }} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later evidence==
In 1977, Schmidtke and colleagues showed that [[isozyme]] complexity is similar in [[lancelet]]s and [[tunicates]], contradicting a prediction of Ohno's hypothesis that [[genome duplication]] occurred in the common ancestor of lancets and [[vertebrates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schmidtke|first=Jörg|last2=Weiler |first2=Conrad |last3=Kunz |first3=Brigitte |last4=Engel |first4=Wolfgang|title=Isozymes of a tunicate and a cephalochordate as a test of polyploidisation in chordate evolution|journal=Nature|year=1977|volume=266|issue=5602|pages=532–533|doi=10.1038/266532a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this analysis did not examine vertebrates, so could say nothing about later duplication events.&lt;ref name="Holland 2003 75–84"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holland|first=PW|title=More genes in vertebrates?|journal=Journal of structural and functional genomics|year=2003|volume=3|issue=1-4|pages=75–84|pmid=12836687|doi=10.1023/a:1022656931587}} {{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Furthermore, much later [[molecular phylogenetics]] has shown that vertebrates are more closely related to tunicates than to lancelets, thus negating the logic of this analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Delsuc|first=F|author2=Brinkmann, H |author3=Chourrout, D |author4=Philippe, H|title=Tunicates and not cephalochordates are the closest living relatives of vertebrates.|journal=Nature|year=2006|volume=439|issue=7079|pages=965–8|pmid=16495997|doi=10.1038/nature04336}} {{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt;) The 2R hypothesis saw a resurgence of interest in the 1990s for two reasons. First, gene mapping data in humans and mice revealed extensive [[paralogy regions]] - sets of genes on one chromosome related to sets of genes on another chromosome in the same species, indicative of duplication events in evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lundin|first=LG|title=Evolution of the vertebrate genome as reflected in paralogous chromosomal regions in man and the house mouse.|journal=Genomics|date=April 1993|volume=16|issue=1|pages=1–19|pmid=8486346|doi=10.1006/geno.1993.1133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paralogy regions were generally in sets of four. Second, cloning of [[Hox gene]]s in lancelet revealed presence of a single [[Hox gene cluster]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Garcia-Fernández|first=J|author2=Holland, PW|title=Archetypal organization of the amphioxus Hox gene cluster.|journal=Nature|date=Aug 18, 1994|volume=370|issue=6490|pages=563–6|pmid=7914353|doi=10.1038/370563a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to the four clusters in humans and mice. Data from additional [[gene families]] revealed a common one-to-many rule when lancelet and vertebrate genes were compared.&lt;ref name="Holland 2003 75–84"/&gt; Taken together, these two lines of evidence suggest that two genome duplications occurred in the ancestry of vertebrates, after it had diverged from the [[cephalochordate]] evolutionary lineage.

[[File:Patró de gens - Hipòtesi 2R.png|thumb|300px|right|Pattern predicted for the relative locations of paralogous genes from two genome duplications&lt;ref name="Dehal e314"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dehal|first=Paramvir|author2=Boore, Jeffrey L.|title=Two Rounds of Whole Genome Duplication in the Ancestral Vertebrate|journal=[[PLOS Biology]]|year= 2005|volume=3|issue=10|pages=e314|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030314|pmid= 16128622 |pmc=1197285 }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Controversy about the 2R hypothesis hinged on the nature of [[paralogy regions]]. It is not disputed that human [[chromosomes]] bear sets of genes related to sets of genes on other chromosomes; the controversy centres on whether they were generated by large-scale duplications that doubled all the genes at the same time, or whether a series of individual [[gene duplication]]s occurred followed by [[chromosomal rearrangement]] to shuffle sets of genes together. Hughes and colleagues found that [[phylogenetic trees]] built from different [[gene families]] within [[paralogy regions]] had different shapes, suggesting that the gene families had different evolutionary histories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hughes|first=AL|title=Phylogenies of developmentally important proteins do not support the hypothesis of two rounds of genome duplication early in vertebrate history|journal=Journal of Molecular Evolution|date=May 1999|volume=48|issue=5|pages=565–76|pmid=10198122|doi=10.1007/PL00006499}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hughes|first=Austin L.|author2=Friedman, Robert|title=2R or not 2R: Testing hypotheses of [[genome duplication]] in early vertebrates|journal=Journal of Structural and Functional Genomics|year= 2003|volume=3|issue=1/4|pages=85–93|doi=10.1023/A:1022681600462}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was suggested to be inconsistent with the 2R hypothesis. However, other researchers have argued that such 'topology tests' do not test 2R rigorously, because [[Genetic recombination|recombination]] could have occurred between the closely related chromosomes generated by [[polyploidy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Furlong|first=RF|author2=Holland, PW|title=Were vertebrates octoploid?|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B|year=2002|volume=357|issue=1420|pages=531–44|pmid=12028790|doi=10.1098/rstb.2001.1035|pmc=1692965}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lynch|first=VJ|author2=Wagner, GP|title=Multiple chromosomal rearrangements structured the ancestral vertebrate Hox-bearing protochromosomes.|journal=[[PLOS Genetics]]|year=2009|volume=5|issue=1|pages=e1000349|pmid=19165336|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000349|pmc=2622764}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; because inappropriate genes had been compared&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larhammar|first=D.|author2=Josephson, M|title=The Human Hox-bearing Chromosome Regions Did Arise by Block or Chromosome (or Even Genome) Duplications|journal=[[Genome Research]]|year= 2002|volume=12|issue=1|pages=1910–1920|doi=10.1101/gr.445702|pmc=187569|pmid=12466295}}&lt;/ref&gt; and because different predictions are made if genome duplication occurred through [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]isation between species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Spring|first=Jürg|title=Vertebrate evolution by interspecific hybridisation – are we polyploid?|journal=FEBS Letters|year= 1997|volume=400|issue=1|pages=2–8|doi=10.1016/S0014-5793(96)01351-8}} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, several researchers were able to date duplications of gene families within [[paralogy regions]] consistently to the early evolution of vertebrates, after divergence from amphioxus, consistent with the 2R hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abi-Rached|first=L|author2=Gilles, A |author3=Shiina, T |author4=Pontarotti, P |author5=Inoko, H |title=Evidence of en bloc duplication in vertebrate genomes.|journal=[[Nature Genetics]]|year=2002|volume=31|issue=1|pages=100–5|pmid=11967531|doi=10.1038/ng855}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Castro|first=LF|author2=Holland, PW|title=Chromosomal mapping of ANTP class homeobox genes in amphioxus: piecing together ancestral genomes.|journal=[[Evolution &amp; Development]]|date=Sep–Oct 2003|volume=5|issue=5|pages=459–65|pmid=12950625|doi=10.1046/j.1525-142x.2003.03052.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; When complete [[genome sequences]] became available for vertebrates, ''[[Ciona intestinalis]]'' and lancelets, it was found that much of the [[human genome]] was arranged in [[paralogy regions]] that could be traced to large-scale duplications,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McLysaght|first=Aoife|authorlink1=Aoife McLysaght|author2=Hokamp, Karsten |author3=Wolfe, Kenneth H.|authorlink3=Kenneth H.

The controversy raging in the late 1990s was summarized in a 2001 review of the subject by Wojciech Makałowski, who stated that "the hypothesis of whole genome duplications in the early stages of vertebrate evolution has as many adherents as opponents".&lt;ref name=Makalowski/&gt;

{{Other uses|Akashic records (disambiguation)}}
{{ref-improve|date=April 2018}}
In [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]] and [[anthroposophy]], the '''Akashic records''' are a [[compendium]] of all human events, thoughts, words, emotions, and intent ever to have occurred in the past, present, or future. They are believed by [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophists]] to be encoded in a non-physical [[Plane (esotericism)|plane of existence]] known as the [[etheric plane]]. There are [[Anecdotal evidence|anecdotal]] accounts but there is no scientific evidence for the existence of the Akashic records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Ellwood |first= Robert S. |year=1996 |chapter= Theosophy |title= The Encyclopedia of the Paranormal |editor-last= Stein |editor-first= Gordon |editor-link= Gordon Stein |publisher= Prometheus Books |pages= 759–66 |isbn= 978-1-57392-021-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Regal |first= Brian |author-link= Brian Regal |year= 2009 |title= Pseudoscience: A Critical Encyclopedia |publisher= Greenwood |page= 29 |isbn= 978-0-313-35507-3 |quote= Other than anecdotal eyewitness accounts, there is no evidence of the ability to astral project, the existence of other planes, or of the Akashic Record.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Drury&gt;{{cite book | url=https://www.questia.com/read/121381643 | title=Heaven: The Rise of Modern Western Magic | publisher=Oxford University Press |last= Drury |first= Nevill | year=2011 | location=New York | pages=308 | isbn=978-0-19-975100-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Akasha]]'' (''{{IAST|ākāśa}}'' {{lang|sa|आकाश}}) is the [[Sanskrit]] word for '[[Aether (classical element)|aether]]' or 'atmosphere'.

==Theosophical Society==
The Sanskrit term ''akasha'' was introduced to the language of theosophy through [[H. P. Blavatsky]] (1831–1891), who characterized it as a sort of life force; she also referred to "indestructible tablets of the astral light" recording both the past and future of human thought and action, but she did not use the term "akashic".&lt;ref name="brandt_hammer"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Katharina|last1=Brandt|first2=Olav|last2=Hammer|chapter=Rudolf Steiner and Theosophy|title=Handbook of the Theosophical Current|editor1-first=Olav|editor1-last=Hammer|editor2-first=Mikael|editor2-last=Rothstein|location= Leiden, NL; Boston|publisher=Brill|year= 2013|pages= [https://books.google.com/books?id=snZRetoB9yIC&amp;pg=PA122 122–3] |isbn= 9789004235960 |ref={{Harvid|Hammer &amp; Rothstein|2013}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The notion of an akashic ''record'' was further disseminated by [[Alfred Percy Sinnett]] in his book [[Esoteric Buddhism (book)|''Esoteric Buddhism'']] (1883) when he cites [[Henry Steel Olcott]]'s ''A Buddhist Catechism'' (1881).&lt;ref name="esoteric.buddhism"&gt;{{cite book|first=Alfred Percy|last=Sinnett|title=Esoteric Buddhism|page=127|url=https://books.google.com/?id=A_4LAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;pg=PA127&amp;dq=akasa|year=1884|edition=5th|publisher=Houghton Mifflin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Olcott  wrote that "Buddha taught two things are eternal, viz, 'Akasa' and 'Nirvana': everything has come out of Akasa in obedience to a law of motion inherent in it, and, passes away. No thing ever comes out of nothing." Olcott further explains that "Early Buddhism, then, clearly held to a permanency of records in the Akasa and the potential capacity of man to read the same, when he was evoluted to the stage of true individual enlightenment."&lt;ref&gt;Olcott, Henry Steel. ''A Buddhist Catechism''. London: Allen Scott and Company, 1881. [https://books.google.com/books?id=pgBOAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=A%20Buddhist%20catechism%20olcott&amp;pg=PA51#v=onepage&amp;q=akasa&amp;f=false 51–2], [https://books.google.com/books?id=pgBOAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=A%20Buddhist%20catechism%20olcott&amp;pg=PA79#v=onepage&amp;q=akasa&amp;f=false 79].&lt;/ref&gt;

By [[C. W. Leadbeater]]'s [[C. W. Leadbeater#Clairvoyance|''Clairvoyance'']] (1899) the association of the term with the idea was complete, and he identified the akashic records by name as something a [[clairvoyant]] could read.&lt;ref name="brandt_hammer" /&gt; 
In his 1913 ''[[Man: whence, how and whither, a record of clairvoyant investigation|''Man: How, Whence, and Whither?'']]'',  Leadbeater claims to record the history of [[Atlantis]] and other civilizations as well as the future society of [[Earth]] in the 28th century.&lt;ref name="brandt_hammer" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Besant |first1= Annie |last2= Leadbeater |first2= C.W. |title= Man: How, Whence, and Whither? |location= Adyar, India |year= 1913 |publisher= Theosophical Publishing House}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alice A. Bailey]] wrote in her book ''Light of the Soul'' on ''The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali – Book 3 – Union achieved and its Results'' (1927): {{quote|The akashic record is like an immense photographic film, registering all the desires and earth experiences of our planet. Those who perceive it will see pictured thereon: The life experiences of every human being since time began, the reactions to experience of the entire animal kingdom, the aggregation of the thought-forms of a [[karma|karmic nature]] (based on desire) of every human unit throughout time. Herein lies the great deception of the records. Only a trained occultist can distinguish between actual experience and those astral pictures created by imagination and keen desire.}}

==Rudolf Steiner==
The [[Austrian people|Austrian]] theosophist and later founder of [[Anthroposophy]], [[Rudolf Steiner]], used the Akashic records concept mainly in a series of articles in his journal ''[[Lucifer-Gnosis]]'' from 1904 to 1908, where he wrote about [[Atlantis]] and [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]], topics related to their purported history and civilisation, etc.&lt;ref&gt;''Aus der Akasha-Chronik''.

'''Algorithm characterizations''' are attempts to formalize the word [[algorithm]]. Algorithm does not have a generally accepted formal definition. Researchers&lt;ref&gt;cf [164] Andreas Blass and Yuri Gurevich "Algorithms: A Quest for Absolute Definitions" Bulletin of the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science Number 81 (October 2003), pages 195–225. Reprinted in Chapter on Logic in Computer Science Current Trends in Theoretical Computer Science World Scientific, 2004, pages 283–311 Reprinted in Church's Thesis After 70 Years Ontos Verlag, 2006, 24–57}, or http://math.ucsd.edu/~sbuss/ResearchWeb/FutureOfLogic/paper.pdf (cited in a 2007 Dershowitz–Gurevich paper): Samual R. Buss, [[Alexander S. Kechris]], Anand Pillay, and Richard A. Shore, “The Prospects for Mathematical Logic in the Twenty-first Century”.&lt;/ref&gt; are actively working on this problem. This article will present some of the "characterizations" of the notion of "algorithm" in more detail.

== The problem of definition ==
Over the last 200 years the definition of algorithm has become more complicated and detailed as researchers have tried to pin down the term. Indeed, there may be more than one type of "algorithm". But most agree that algorithm has something to do with defining generalized processes for the creation of "output" integers from other "input" integers – "input parameters" arbitrary and infinite in extent, or limited in extent but still variable—by the manipulation of distinguishable symbols (counting numbers) with finite collections of rules that a person can perform with paper and pencil.

The most common number-manipulation schemes—both in formal mathematics and in routine life—are: (1) the [[computable function|recursive functions]] calculated by a person with paper and pencil, and (2) the [[Turing machine]] or its Turing equivalents—the primitive [[register machine]] or "counter machine" model, the [[Random Access Machine]] model (RAM), the [[Random access stored program machine]] model (RASP) and its functional equivalent "the [[computer]]".

When we are doing "arithmetic" we are really calculating by the use of "recursive functions" in the shorthand algorithms we learned in grade-school, for example, adding and subtracting.

The proofs that every "recursive function" we can ''calculate by hand'' we can ''compute by machine'' and vice versa—note the usage of the words ''calculate'' versus ''compute''—is remarkable. But this equivalence together with the ''thesis'' (unproven assertion) that this includes ''every'' calculation/computation indicates why so much emphasis has been placed upon the use of [[Turing machine equivalents|Turing-equivalent]] machines in the definition of specific algorithms, and why the definition of "algorithm" itself often refers back to "the [[Turing machine]]". This is discussed in more detail under '''Stephen Kleene's characterization'''.

The following are summaries of the more famous characterizations (Kleene, Markov, Knuth) together with those that introduce novel elements—elements that further expand the definition or contribute to a more precise definition.

[
&lt;small&gt;A mathematical problem and its result can be considered as two points in a space, and the solution consists of a sequence of steps or a path linking them. Quality of the solution is a function of the path. There might be more than one attribute defined for the path, e.g. length, complexity of shape, an ease of generalizing, difficulty, and so on&lt;/small&gt;.

== Chomsky hierarchy == &lt;!-- at 1956 --&gt;
There is more consensus on the "characterization" of the notion of "simple algorithm".

All algorithms need to be specified in a formal language, and the "simplicity notion" arises from the simplicity of the language. The [[Chomsky hierarchy|Chomsky (1956) hierarchy]] is a [[containment hierarchy]] of classes of [[formal grammar]]s that generate [[formal language]]s. It is used for [[Taxonomy (general)|classifying]] of [[programming language]]s and [[abstract machine]]s.

From the ''Chomsky hierarchy'' perspective, if the algorithm can be specified on a simpler language (than  unrestricted), it can be  characterized by this kind of language, else it is a typical "unrestricted algorithm".

Examples: a "general purpose" macro language, like [[M4 (computer language)|M4]] is unrestricted ([[Turing complete]]), but the [[C preprocessor|C preprocessor macro language]] is not, so any algorithm expressed in ''C preprocessor'' is a "simple algorithm".

== Features of a Good Algorithm == 

{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}

The following are the features of a good algorithm.
1. Precision: a good algorithm must have a certain outlined steps. The steps should be exact enough, and not varying.
2. Uniqueness: each step taken in the algorithm should give a definite result as stated by the writer of the algorithm. The results should not fluctuate by any means.
3. Feasibility: the algorithm should be possible and practicable in real life. It should not be abstract or imaginary.
4. Input: a good algorithm must be able to accept a set of defined input.
5. Output: a good algorithm should be able to produce results as output, preferably solutions.
6. Finiteness: the algorithm should have a stop after a certain number of instructions.
7. Generality: the algorithm must apply to a set of defined inputs.

== 1881 John Venn's negative reaction to W. Stanley Jevons's Logical Machine of 1870 ==
In early 1870 [[W. Stanley Jevons]] presented a "Logical Machine" (Jevons 1880:200) for analyzing a [[syllogism]] or other [[logical form]] e.g. an argument reduced to a [[Boolean equation]]. By means of what Couturat (1914) called a "sort of ''logical piano'' [,] ... the equalities which represent the premises ... are "played" on a keyboard like that of a typewriter. ... When all the premises have been "played", the panel shows only those constituents whose sum is equal to 1, that is, ... its logical whole. This mechanical method has the advantage over VENN's geometrical method..." (Couturat 1914:75).

For his part [[John Venn]], a logician contemporary to Jevons, was less than thrilled, opining that "it does not seem to me that any contrivances at present known ''or likely to be discovered'' really deserve the name of logical machines" (italics added, Venn 1881:120). But of historical use to the developing notion of "algorithm" is his explanation for his negative reaction with respect to a machine that "may subserve a really valuable purpose by enabling us to avoid otherwise inevitable labor":
: (1) "There is, first, the statement of our data in accurate logical language",
: (2) "Then secondly, we have to throw these statements into a form fit for the engine to work with – in this case the reduction of each proposition to its elementary denials",
: (3) "Thirdly, there is the combination or further treatment of our premises after such reduction,"
: (4) "Finally, the results have to be interpreted or read off. This last generally gives rise to much opening for skill and sagacity."
He concludes that "I cannot see that any machine can hope to help us except in the third of these steps; so that it seems very doubtful whether any thing of this sort really deserves the name of a logical engine."(Venn 1881:119–121).

== 1943, 1952 Stephen Kleene's characterization ==
This section is longer and more detailed than the others because of its importance to the topic: Kleene was the first to propose that ''all'' calculations/computations—of ''every'' sort, the ''totality'' of—can ''equivalently'' be (i) ''calculated'' by use of five "[[primitive recursive]] operators" plus one special operator called the [[mu-operator]], or be (ii) ''computed'' by the actions of a Turing machine or an equivalent model.

Furthermore, he opined that either of these would stand as a definition of '''algorithm'''.

A reader first confronting the words that follow may well be confused, so a brief explanation is in order. ''Calculation'' means done by hand, ''computation'' means done by Turing machine (or equivalent).  (Sometimes an author slips and interchanges the words). A "function" can be thought of as an "input-output box" into which a person puts natural numbers called "arguments" or "parameters" (but only the counting numbers including 0—the nonnegative integers) and gets out a single nonnegative integer (conventionally called "the answer"). Think of the "function-box" as a little man either calculating by hand using "general recursion" or computing by Turing machine (or an equivalent machine).

"Effectively calculable/computable" is more generic and means "calculable/computable by ''some'' procedure, method, technique ... whatever...".  "General recursive" was Kleene's way of writing what today is called just "recursion"; however, "primitive recursion"—calculation by use of the five recursive operators—is a lesser form of recursion that lacks access to the sixth, additional, mu-operator that is needed only in rare instances. Thus most of life goes on requiring only the "primitive recursive functions."

=== 1943 "Thesis I", 1952 "Church's Thesis" ===
In 1943 Kleene proposed what has come to be known as [[Church's thesis]]:
: "''Thesis I''. Every effectively calculable function (effectively decidable predicate) is general recursive" (First stated by Kleene in 1943 (reprinted page 274 in Davis, ed. ''The Undecidable''; appears also verbatim in Kleene (1952) p.300)

In a nutshell: to calculate ''any'' function the only operations a person needs (technically, formally) are the 6 primitive operators of "general" recursion (nowadays called the operators of the [[mu recursive function]]s).

Kleene's first statement of this was under the section title "'''12. Algorithmic theories'''". He would later amplify it in his text (1952) as follows:
: "Thesis I and its converse provide the exact definition of the notion of a calculation (decision) procedure or '''algorithm''', for the case of a function (predicate) of natural numbers" (p. 301, boldface added for emphasis)

(His use of the word "decision" and "predicate" extends the notion of calculability to the more general manipulation of symbols such as occurs in mathematical "proofs".)

This is not as daunting as it may sound – "general" recursion is just a way of making our everyday arithmetic operations from the five "operators" of the [[primitive recursive function]]s together with the additional [[mu-operator]] as needed. Indeed, Kleene gives 13 examples of primitive recursive functions and Boolos–Burgess–Jeffrey add some more, most of which will be familiar to the reader—e.g. addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, exponentiation, the CASE function, concatenation, etc., etc.; for a list see [[primitive recursive function|Some common primitive recursive functions]].
&lt;!--'''Some functions definable by primitive recursion''' (Kleene (1952) pp. 223ff; Boolos–Burgess–Jeffrey 2002 pp. 63ff)

In the following we observe that primitive recursive functions can be four types (1) numerical in nature – "number-theoretic" or just "functions" { 0, 1, 2, ...} to { 0, 1, 2, ...}, (2) predicates { 0, 1, 2, ...} to { t, f }, (3) truth-value or propositional connectives { t, f } to { t, f }, and "representing functions" { t, f } to { 0, 1 }. A predicate requires a "representing function" to convert { t, f } to { 0, 1 }: by definition a function φ('''x''') is a "representing function" of the predicate P('''x''') if φ takes only values o and 1 and produces ''0'' when P is true".

'So, in a sense the knowledge of the value NOT-φ(y; '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;2 to n&lt;/sub&gt; ) of the course-of-values function is equivalent to the knowledge of the sequence of values φ(0,'''x'''&lt;sub&gt;2 to n&lt;/sub&gt;), ..., φ(y − 1,'''x'''&lt;sub&gt;2 to n&lt;/sub&gt;) of the original function." (Kleene (1952) p. 231)--&gt;

'''Why general-recursive functions rather than primitive-recursive functions?'''

Kleene et al. (cf §55 General recursive functions p.&amp;nbsp;270 in Kleene 1952) had to add a sixth recursion operator called the minimization-operator (written as μ-operator or [[mu-operator]]) because [[Wilhelm Ackermann|Ackermann]] (1925) produced a hugely growing function—the [[Ackermann function]]—and [[Rózsa Péter]] (1935) produced a general method of creating recursive functions using [[Cantor's diagonal argument]], neither of which could be described by the 5 primitive-recursive-function operators. With respect to the Ackermann function:
: "...in a certain sense, the length of the computation '''algorithm''' of a recursive function which is not also primitive recursive grows faster with the arguments than the value of any primitive recursive function" (Kleene (1935) reprinted p. 246 in ''The Undecidable'', plus footnote 13 with regards to the need for an additional operator, boldface added).
&lt;!-- Kleene gives a second example using Péter's demonstration that "leads to ... predicates which are not primitive recursive". Specifically:
::All primitive recursive functions of one variable are [[enumerable]]: countable, can be placed one-to-one with the integers. But by the method of [[Cantor]]'s [[diagonal method]] this means that other functions of one variable exist but cannot be generated by primitive recursion. For example, we just add the number 1 to the diagonal number, i.e. φ&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;(a)+1, and thereby we see a single-variable function exists that cannot be created by primitive recursion alone. --&gt;

But the need for the mu-operator is a rarity. As indicated above by Kleene's list of common calculations, a person goes about their life happily computing primitive recursive functions without fear of encountering the monster numbers created by Ackermann's function (e.g. [[super-exponentiation]] ).

=== 1952 "Turing's thesis" ===
[[Turing's Thesis]] hypothesizes the computability of "all computable functions" by the Turing machine model and its equivalents.

To do this in an effective manner, Kleene extended the notion of "computable" by casting the net wider—by allowing into the notion of "functions" both "total functions" and "partial functions". A ''total function'' is one that is defined ''for '''all''' natural numbers'' (positive integers including 0). A partial function is defined for ''some'' natural numbers but not all—the specification of "some" has to come "up front". Thus the inclusion of "partial function" extends the notion of function to "less-perfect" functions. Total- and partial-functions may either be calculated by hand or computed by machine.
: Examples:
:: "Functions": include "common subtraction ''m''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''n''" and "addition ''m''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''n''"

:: "Partial function": "Common subtraction" ''m''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''n'' is undefined when only natural numbers (positive integers and zero) are allowed as input – e.g. 6&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;7 is undefined

:: Total function: "Addition" ''m''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''n'' is defined for all positive integers and zero.

&lt;!-- A partial function is restricted to use only an "''n''-tuple" (a list of input "parameters") defined at the outset:
: Definition: "A partial function is a function which for each ''n''-tuple ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of natural numbers as arguments takes at most one natural number ''φ''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) as value" (p.325).
::When an ''n''-tuple produces a value we say its function ''φ'' is defined for that ''n''-tuple; otherwise we say ''φ'' is undefined for that ''n''-tuple.

: Definition: "A partial function of positive integers is one whose domain [i.e. the list of possible "input" positive integers] is something less than the whole set P [of positive integers]" (Boolos–Burgess–Jeffrey (2002) p. 7) --&gt;

We now observe Kleene's definition of "computable" in a formal sense:
: Definition: "A partial function φ is ''computable'', if there is a machine M which computes it" (Kleene (1952) p. 360)

: "Definition 2.5. An ''n''-ary function ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is '''partially computable''' if there exists a Turing machine Z such that
:: ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) = Ψ&lt;sub&gt;Z&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(''n'')&lt;/sup&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., [''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)
: In this case we say that [machine] Z computes ''f''. If, in addition, ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is a total function, then it is called '''computable'''" (Davis (1958) p. 10)

Thus we have arrived at ''Turing's Thesis'':
: "Every function which would naturally be regarded as computable is computable ... by one of his machines..." (Kleene (1952) p.376)

Although Kleene did not give examples of "computable functions" others have. For example, Davis (1958) gives Turing tables for the Constant, Successor and Identity functions, three of the five operators of the [[primitive recursive functions]]:
: Computable by Turing machine:
:: Addition (also is the Constant function if one operand is 0)
:: Increment (Successor function)
:: Common subtraction (defined only if ''x'' ≥ ''y''). Thus "''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''y''" is an example of a partially computable function.
:: Proper subtraction ''x''┴''y'' (as defined above)
:: The identity function: for each ''i'', a function U&lt;sub&gt;Z&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; =  Ψ&lt;sub&gt;Z&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) exists that plucks ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; out of the set of arguments (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)
:: Multiplication

Boolos–Burgess–Jeffrey (2002) give the following as prose descriptions of Turing machines for:
:: Doubling: 2''p''
:: Parity
:: Addition
:: Multiplication

With regards to the [[counter machine]], an [[abstract machine]] model equivalent to the Turing machine:
: Examples Computable by Abacus machine (cf Boolos–Burgess–Jeffrey (2002))
:: Addition
:: Multiplication
:: Exponention: (a flow-chart/block diagram description of the algorithm)

Demonstrations of computability by abacus machine (Boolos–Burgess–Jeffrey (2002)) and by counter machine (Minsky 1967):
: The six recursive function operators:
::# Zero function
::# Successor function
::# Identity function
::# Composition function
::# Primitive recursion (induction)
::# Minimization

The fact that the abacus/[[counter machine models]] can simulate the recursive functions provides the proof that: If a function is "machine computable" then it is "hand-calculable by partial recursion". Kleene's Theorem XXIX :
: "''Theorem XXIX: "Every computable partial function φ is partial recursive...''" (italics in original, p. 374).

The converse appears as his Theorem XXVIII. Together these form the proof of their equivalence, Kleene's Theorem XXX.

=== 1952 Church–Turing Thesis ===
With his Theorem XXX Kleene '''proves''' the ''equivalence'' of the two "Theses"—the Church Thesis and the Turing Thesis. (Kleene can only hypothesize (conjecture) the truth of both thesis – ''these he has not proven''):
: ''THEOREM XXX: The following classes of partial functions ... have the same members: (a) the partial recursive functions, (b) the computable functions ..."''(p. 376)

:: Definition of "partial recursive function": "A partial function φ is partial recursive in [the partial functions] ψ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ... ψ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; if there is a system of equations E which defines φ recursively from [partial functions] ψ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ... ψ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;" (p. 326)

Thus by Kleene's Theorem XXX: either method of making numbers from input-numbers—recursive functions calculated by hand or computated by Turing-machine or equivalent—results in an "''effectively calculable/computable'' function". If we accept the hypothesis that ''every'' calculation/computation can be done by either method equivalently we have accepted both Kleene's Theorem XXX (the equivalence) and the [[Church–Turing Thesis]] (the hypothesis of "every").

=== A note of dissent: "There's more to algorithm..." Blass and Gurevich (2003) ===
The notion of separating out Church's and Turing's theses from the "Church–Turing thesis" appears not only in Kleene (1952) but in Blass-Gurevich (2003) as well. But while there are agreements, there are disagreements too:
: "...we disagree with Kleene that the notion of '''algorithm''' is that well understood. In fact the notion of algorithm is richer these days than it was in Turing's days. And there are algorithms, of modern and classical varieties, not covered directly by Turing's analysis, for example, algorithms that interact with their environments, algorithms whose inputs are abstract structures, and geometric or, more generally, non-discrete algorithms" (Blass-Gurevich (2003) p. 8, boldface added)

== 1954 A. A. Markov's characterization ==

[[A. A. Markov]] (1954) provided the following definition of algorithm:

: "1. In mathematics, "algorithm" is commonly understood to be an exact prescription, defining a computational process, leading from various initial data to the desired result...."

: "The following three features are characteristic of algorithms and determine their role in mathematics:
:: "a) the precision of the prescription, leaving no place to arbitrariness, and its universal comprehensibility -- the definiteness of the algorithm;
:: "b) the possibility of starting out with initial data, which may vary within given limits -- the generality of the algorithm;
:: "c) the orientation of the algorithm toward obtaining some desired result, which is indeed obtained in the end with proper initial data -- the conclusiveness of the algorithm." (p.1)

He admitted that this definition "does not pretend to mathematical precision" (p.&amp;nbsp;1). His 1954 monograph was his attempt to define algorithm more accurately; he saw his resulting definition—his "normal" algorithm—as "equivalent to the concept of a [[recursion|recursive function]]" (p.&amp;nbsp;3). His definition included four major components (Chapter II.3 pp.&amp;nbsp;63ff):

: "1. Separate  elementary steps, each of which will be performed according to one of [the substitution] rules... [rules given at the outset]

: "2. ... steps of local nature ... [Thus the algorithm won't change more than a certain number of symbols to the left or right of the observed word/symbol]

: "3. Rules for the substitution formulas ... [he called the list of these "the scheme" of the algorithm]

: "4. ...a means to distinguish a "concluding substitution" [i.e. a distinguishable "terminal/final" state or states]

In his Introduction Markov observed that "the entire significance for mathematics" of efforts to define algorithm more precisely would be "in connection with the problem of a constructive foundation for mathematics" (p.&amp;nbsp;2). [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]] (cf Encyclopædia Britannica) shares a similar belief: "...constructive analysis is very much in the same algorithmic spirit as computer science...". For more see [[constructive mathematics]] and [[Intuitionism]].

'''Distinguishability and Locality''': Both notions first appeared with Turing (1936–1937) --
: "The new observed squares must be immediately recognizable by the computer [''sic'': a computer was a person in 1936]. I think it reasonable to suppose that they can only be squares whose distance from the closest of the immediately observed squares does not exceed a certain fixed amount. Let us stay that each of the new observed squares is within L squares of one of the previously observed squares." (Turing (1936) p. 136 in Davis ed. ''Undecidable'')

Locality appears prominently in the work of Gurevich and Gandy (1980) (whom Gurevich cites). Gandy's "Fourth Principle for Mechanisms" is "The Principle of Local Causality":
: "We now come to the most important of our principles. In Turing's analysis the requirement that the action depend only on a bounded portion of the record was based on a human limitiation. We replace this by a physical limitation which we call the ''principle of local causation.'' Its justification lies in the finite velocity of propagation of effects and signals: contemporary physics rejects the possibility of instantaneous action at a distance." (Gandy (1980) p. 135 in J. Barwise et al.)

== 1936, 1963, 1964 Gödel's characterization ==
'''1936''': A rather famous quote from [[Kurt Gödel]] appears in a "Remark added in proof [of the original German publication] in his paper "On the Length of Proofs" translated by [[Martin Davis]] appearing on pp.&amp;nbsp;82–83 of ''The Undecidable''. A number of authors—Kleene, Gurevich, Gandy etc. -- have quoted the following:
: "Thus, the concept of "computable" is in a certain definite sense "absolute," while practically all other familiar metamathematical concepts (e.g. provable, definable, etc.) depend quite essentially on the system with respect to which they are defined." (p. 83)

'''1963''': In a "Note" dated 28 August 1963 added to his famous paper ''On Formally Undecidable Propositions'' (1931) Gödel states (in a footnote) his belief that "[[formal system]]s" have "the characteristic property that reasoning in them, in principle, can be completely replaced by mechanical devices" (p.&amp;nbsp;616 in van Heijenoort). ". . . due to "A. M. Turing's work a precise and unquestionably adequate definition of the general notion of formal system can now be given [and] a completely general version of Theorems VI and XI is now possible." (p.&amp;nbsp;616). In a 1964 note to another work he expresses the same opinion more strongly and in more detail.

'''1964''': In a Postscriptum, dated 1964, to a paper presented to the Institute for Advanced Study in spring 1934, Gödel amplified his conviction that "formal systems" are those that can be mechanized:
: "In consequence of later advances, in particular of the fact that, due to A. M. Turing's work, a precise and unquestionably adequate definition of the general concept of formal system can now be given . . . Turing's work gives an analysis of the concept of "mechanical procedure" (alias "algorithm" or "computational procedure" or "finite combinatorial procedure"). This concept is shown to be equivalent with that of a "Turing machine".* A formal system can simply be defined to be any mechanical procedure for producing formulas, called provable formulas . . . ." (p. 72 in [[Martin Davis]] ed. ''The Undecidable'': "Postscriptum" to "On Undecidable Propositions of Formal Mathematical Systems" appearing on p. 39, loc. cit.)

The * indicates a footnote in which Gödel cites the papers by [[Alan Turing]] (1937) and [[Emil Post]] (1936) and then goes on to make the following intriguing statement:
: "As for previous equivalent definitions of computability, which however, are much less suitable for our purpose, see [[Alonzo Church]], Am. J. Math., vol. 58 (1936) [appearing in ''The Undecidable'' pp. 100-102]).

Church's definitions encompass so-called "[[recursion]]" and the "[[lambda calculus]]" (i.e. the λ-definable functions). His footnote 18 says that he discussed the relationship of "effective calculatibility" and "recursiveness" with Gödel but that he independently questioned "effectively calculability" and "λ-definability":
: "We now define the notion . . . of an effectively calculable function of positive integers by identifying it with the notion of a recursive function of positive integers&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; (or of a λ-definable function of positive integers.
: "It has already been pointed out that, for every function of positive integers which is effectively calculable in the sense just defined, there exists an algorithm for the calculation of its value.
: "Conversely it is true . . ." (p. 100, The Undecidable).

It would appear from this, and the following, that far as Gödel was concerned, the Turing machine was sufficient and the lambda calculus was "much less suitable." He goes on to make the point that, with regards to limitations on human reason, the jury is still out:
: ("Note that the question of whether there exist finite non-mechanical procedures** not equivalent with any algorithm, has nothing whatsoever to do with the adequacy of the definition of "formal system" and of "mechanical procedure.") (p. 72, loc. cit.)

: "(For theories and procedures in the more general sense indicated in footnote ** the situation may be different. Note that the results mentioned in the postscript do not establish any bounds for the powers of human reason, but rather for the potentialities of pure formalism in mathematics.) (p. 73 loc. cit.)

: Footnote **: "I.e., such as involve the use of abstract terms on the basis of their meaning. See my paper in Dial. 12(1958), p. 280." (this footnote appears on p. 72, loc. cit).

== 1967 Minsky's characterization ==
Minsky (1967) baldly asserts that "an algorithm is "an effective procedure" and declines to use the word "algorithm" further in his text; in fact his index makes it clear what he feels about "Algorithm, ''synonym'' for Effective procedure"(p.&amp;nbsp;311):
:: "We will use the latter term [an ''effective procedure''] in the sequel. The terms are roughly synonymous, but there are a number of shades of meaning used in different contexts, especially for 'algorithm'" (italics in original, p. 105)

Other writers (see Knuth below) use the word "effective procedure". This leads one to wonder: What is Minsky's notion of "an effective procedure"? He starts off with:
: "...a set of rules which tell us, from moment to moment, precisely how to behave" (p. 106)

But he recognizes that this is subject to a criticism:
: "... the criticism that the interpretation of the rules is left to depend on some person or agent" (p. 106)

His refinement? To "specify, along with the statement of the rules, ''the details of the mechanism that is to interpret them''". To avoid the "cumbersome" process of "having to do this over again for each individual procedure" he hopes to identify a "reasonably ''uniform'' family of rule-obeying mechanisms". His "formulation":
:: "(1) a ''language'' in which sets of behavioral rules are to be expressed, and

:: "(2) a ''single'' machine which can interpret statements in the language and thus carry out the steps of each specified process." (italics in original, all quotes this para. p. 107)

In the end, though, he still worries that "there remains a subjective aspect to the matter. Different people may not agree on whether a certain procedure should be called effective" (p.&amp;nbsp;107)

But Minsky is undeterred. He immediately introduces "Turing's Analysis of Computation Process" (his chapter 5.2). He quotes what he calls "Turing's ''thesis''"
: "Any process which could naturally be called an effective procedure can be realized by a Turing machine" (p. 108. (Minsky comments that in a more general form this is called "''Church's thesis''").

After an analysis of "Turing's Argument" (his chapter 5.3)
he observes that "equivalence of many intuitive formulations" of Turing, Church, Kleene, Post, and Smullyan "...leads us to suppose that there is really here an 'objective' or 'absolute' notion. As Rogers [1959] put it:
:: "In this sense, the notion of effectively computable function is one of the few 'absolute' concepts produced by modern work in the foundations of mathematics'" (Minsky p. 111 quoting Rogers, Hartley Jr (1959) ''The present theory of Turing machine computability'', J. SIAM 7, 114-130.)

== 1967 Rogers' characterization ==
In his 1967 ''Theory of Recursive Functions and Effective Computability'' Hartley Rogers' characterizes "algorithm" roughly as "a clerical (i.e., deterministic, bookkeeping) procedure . . . applied to . . . symbolic ''inputs'' and which will eventually yield, for each such input, a corresponding symbolic ''output''"(p.&amp;nbsp;1). He then goes on to describe the notion "in approximate and intuitive terms" as having 10 "features", 5 of which he asserts that "virtually all mathematicians would agree [to]" (p.&amp;nbsp;2). The remaining 5 he asserts "are less obvious than *1 to *5 and about which we might find less general agreement" (p.&amp;nbsp;3).

The 5 "obvious" are:
* 1 An algorithm is a set of instructions of finite size,
* 2 There is a capable computing agent,
* 3 "There are facilities for making, storing, and retrieving steps in a computation"
* 4 Given #1 and #2 the agent computes in "discrete stepwise fashion" without use of continuous methods or analogue devices",
* 5 The computing agent carries the computation forward "without resort to random methods or devices, e.g. , dice" (in a footnote Rogers wonders if #4 and #5 are really the same)

The remaining 5 that he opens to debate, are:
* 6 No fixed bound on the size of the inputs,
* 7 No fixed bound on the size of the set of instructions,
* 8 No fixed bound on the amount of memory storage available,
* 9 A fixed finite bound on the capacity or ability of the computing agent (Rogers illustrates with example simple mechanisms similar to a [[Post–Turing machine]] or a [[counter machine]]),
* 10 A bound on the length of the computation -- "should we have some idea, 'ahead of time', how long the computationwill take?" (p.&amp;nbsp;5). Rogers requires "only that a computation terminate after ''some'' finite number of steps; we do not insist on an a priori ability to estimate this number." (p.&amp;nbsp;5).

== 1968, 1973 Knuth's characterization ==
[[Donald Knuth|Knuth]] (1968, 1973) has given a list of five properties that are widely accepted as requirements for an algorithm:

# '''Finiteness''': "An algorithm must always terminate after a finite number of steps ... a ''very'' finite number, a reasonable number"
# '''Definiteness''': "Each step of an algorithm must be precisely defined; the actions to be carried out must be rigorously and unambiguously specified for each case"
# '''Input''': "...quantities which are given to it initially before the algorithm begins. These inputs are taken from specified sets of objects"
# '''Output''': "...quantities which have a specified relation to the inputs"
# '''Effectiveness''': "... all of the operations to be performed in the algorithm must be sufficiently basic that they can in principle be done exactly and in a finite length of time by a man using paper and pencil"

Knuth offers as an example the [[Euclidean algorithm]] for determining the [[greatest common divisor]] of two [[natural number]]s (cf. Knuth Vol. 1 p.&amp;nbsp;2).

Knuth admits that, while his description of an algorithm may be intuitively clear, it lacks formal rigor, since it is not exactly clear what "precisely defined" means, or "rigorously and unambiguously specified" means, or "sufficiently basic", and so forth. He makes an effort in this direction in his first volume where he defines ''in detail'' what he calls the "[[machine language]]" for his "mythical [[MIX]]...the world's first polyunsaturated computer" (pp.&amp;nbsp;120ff). Many of the algorithms in his books are written in the MIX language. He also uses [[Decision tree|tree diagrams]], [[Data flow diagram|flow diagram]]s and [[state diagram]]s.

'''"Goodness" of an algorithm, "best" algorithms''': Knuth states that "In practice, we not only want algorithms, we want ''good'' algorithms...." He suggests that some criteria of an algorithm's goodness are the number of steps to perform the algorithm, its "adaptability to computers, its simplicity and elegance, etc." Given a number of algorithms to perform the same computation, which one is "best"? He calls this sort of inquiry "algorithmic analysis: given an algorithm, to determine its performance characteristcis" (all quotes this paragraph: Knuth Vol. 1 p.&amp;nbsp;7)

== 1972 Stone's characterization ==
Stone (1972) and Knuth (1968, 1973) were professors at Stanford University at the same time so it is not surprising if there are similarities in their definitions (boldface added for emphasis):

: "To summarize ... we define an algorithm to be a '''set of rules''' that precisely defines '''a sequence of operations''' such that each rule is '''effective''' and '''definite''' and such that the '''sequence terminates''' in a finite time." (boldface added, p. 8)

Stone is noteworthy because of  his detailed discussion of what constitutes an “effective” rule – his '''robot''', or person-acting-as-robot, must have some '''information and abilities within''' them, and if not '''the information and the ability must be provided''' in "the algorithm":

: "For people to follow the rules of an algorithm, the '''rules''' must be formulated so that they can be '''followed in a robot-like manner''', that is, without the need for thought... however, if the instructions [to solve the quadratic equation, his example] are to be obeyed by someone who knows how to perform arithmetic operations but does not know how to extract a square root, then we must also provide a set of rules for extracting a square root in order to satisfy the definition of algorithm" (p. 4-5)

Furthermore, "...'''not all instructions are acceptable''', because they may require the robot to have '''abilities beyond those that we consider reasonable'''.” He gives the example of a robot confronted with the question is “Henry VIII a King of England?” and to print 1 if yes and 0 if no, but the robot has not been previously provided with this information. And worse, if the robot is asked if Aristotle was a King of England and the robot only had been provided with five names, it would not know how to answer. Thus:
: “an intuitive definition of an acceptable sequence of instructions is one in which '''each instruction is precisely defined''' so that the '''robot is guaranteed to be able to obey it'''” (p. 6)

After providing us with his definition, Stone introduces the [[Turing machine]] model and states that the set of five-tuples that are the machine’s instructions are “an algorithm ... known as a Turing machine program” (p.&amp;nbsp;9). Immediately thereafter he goes on say that a “''computation'' of a Turing machine is ''described'' by stating:
: "1. The tape alphabet
: "2. The '''form''' in which the '''[input] parameters''' are presented on the tape
: "3. The initial state of the Turing machine
: "4. The '''form''' in which '''answers [output]''' will be represented on the tape when the Turing machine halts
: "5. The machine program" (italics added, p. 10)

This precise prescription of what is required for "a computation" is in the spirit of what will follow in the work of Blass and Gurevich.

== 1995 Soare's characterization ==

: "A ''computation'' is a process whereby we proceed from initially given objects, called ''inputs'', according to a fixed set of rules, called a ''program, procedure,'' or '''''algorithm''''', through a series of ''steps'' and arrive at the end of these steps with a final result, called the ''output''. The '''algorithm''', as a set of rules proceeding from inputs to output, must be precise and definite with each successive step clearly determined. The concept of ''computability'' concerns those objects which may be specified in principle by computations . . ."(italics in original, boldface added p. 3)

== 2000 Berlinski's characterization ==

While a student at Princeton in the mid-1960s, David Berlinski was a student of Alonzo Church (cf p.&amp;nbsp;160). His year-2000 book ''The Advent of the Algorithm: The 300-year Journey from an Idea to the Computer'' contains the following definition of '''algorithm''':

: "'''''In the logician's voice:
::: "''an algorithm is
::: ''a finite procedure,
::: ''written in a fixed symbolic vocabulary,
::: ''governed by precise instructions,
::: ''moving in discrete steps, 1, 2, 3, . . .,
::: ''whose execution requires no insight, cleverness,
::: ''intuition, intelligence, or perspicuity,
::: ''and that sooner or later comes to an end.'''" (boldface and italics in the original, p. xviii)

== 2000, 2002 Gurevich's characterization ==
A careful reading of Gurevich 2000 leads one to conclude (infer?) that he believes that "an algorithm" is actually "a Turing machine" or "a [[pointer machine]]" doing a computation. An "algorithm" is not just the symbol-table that guides the behavior of the machine, nor is it just one instance of a machine doing a computation given a particular set of input parameters, nor is it a suitably programmed machine with the power off; rather ''an algorithm is the machine actually doing any computation of which it is capable''. Gurevich does not come right out and say this, so as worded above this conclusion (inference?) is certainly open to debate:

: " . . . every algorithm can be simulated by a Turing machine . . . a program can be simulated and therefore given a precise meaning by a Turing machine." (p. 1)
&lt;!--:"Can one generalize Turing machines so that any algorithm, never mind how abstract, can be modeled by a generalized machine very closely and faithfully?" (italics in original, p. 2)--&gt;

: " It is often thought that the problem of formalizing the notion of sequential algorithm was solved by Church [1936] and Turing [1936]. For example, according to Savage [1987], an algorithm is a computational ''process'' defined by a Turing machine. Church and Turing did not solve the problem of formalizing the notion of sequential algorithm. Instead they gave (different but equivalent) formalizations of the notion of computable function, and there is more to an algorithm than the function it computes. (italics added p. 3)

: "Of course, the notions of algorithm and computable function are intimately related: by definition, a computable function is a function computable by an algorithm. . . . (p. 4)

&lt;!--:"While Turing analyzed a human computer, Kolmogorov and Uspensky [1958] arrived at their machine model (KU machines) [cf [[Pointer machine]] ] by analyzing cmoputations from the point of view of physics. . . . I attempted to [formulate a thesis for them]: "every computation performing only one restricted local action at a time, can be viewed as (not only being simulated by, but actually being) the computation of an appropriate KU machine" [Gureviceh 1988]. Uspensky [1992, p. 396] agreed". (p. 4; Kolmogorov had died by this time)--&gt;

In Blass and Gurevich 2002 the authors invoke a dialog between "Quisani" ("Q") and "Authors" (A), using Yiannis Moshovakis as a foil, where they come right out and flatly state:
: "'''A:''' To localize the disagreement, let's first mention two points of agreement. First, there are some things that are obviously algorithms by anyone's definition -- Turing machines , sequential-time ASMs [Abstract State Machines], and the like. . . .Second, at the other extreme are specifications that would not be regarded as algorithms under anyone's definition, since they give no indication of how to compute anything . . . The issue is how detailed the information has to be in order to count as an algorithm. . . . Moshovakis allows some things that we would call only declarative specifications, and he would probably use the word "implementation" for things that we call algorithms." (paragraphs joined for ease of readability, 2002:22)

This use of the word "implementation" cuts straight to the heart of the question. Early in the paper, Q states his reading of Moshovakis:
: "...[H]e would probably think that your practical work [Gurevich works for Microsoft] forces you to think of implementations more than of algorithms. He is quite willing to identify implementations with machines, but he says that algorithms are something more general. What it boils down to is that you say an algorithm is a machine and Moschovakis says it is not." (2002:3)

But the authors waffle here, saying "[L]et's stick to "algorithm" and "machine", and the reader is left, again, confused. We have to wait until Dershowitz and Gurevich 2007 to get the following footnote comment:
: " . . . Nevertheless, if one accepts Moshovakis's point of view, then it is the "implementation" of algorithms that we have set out to characterize."(cf Footnote 9 2007:6)

== 2003 Blass and Gurevich's characterization ==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

Blass and Gurevich describe their work as evolved from consideration of [[Turing machines]] and [[pointer machine]]s, specifically Kolmogorov-Uspensky machines (KU machines), Schönhage Storage Modification Machines (SMM), and linking automata as defined by Knuth. The work of Gandy and Markov are also described as influential precursors.

Gurevich offers a 'strong' definition of an algorithm (boldface added):

: "...Turing's informal argument in favor of his thesis justifies a stronger thesis: '''every algorithm can be simulated by a Turing machine'''....In practice, it would be ridiculous...[Nevertheless,] [c]an one generalize Turing machines so that any algorithm, never mind how abstract, can be modeled by a generalized machine?...But suppose such generalized Turing machines exist. What would their states be?...a '''first-order structure''' ... a particular '''small instruction set''' suffices in all cases ... '''computation as an evolution of the state''' ... could be nondeterministic... can interact with their environment ... [could be] parallel and multi-agent ... [could have] [[dynamic semantics]] ... [the two underpinings of their work are:] Turing's thesis ...[and] the notion of (first order) structure of [Tarski 1933]" (Gurevich 2000, p. 1-2)

The above phrase '''computation as an evolution of the state''' differs markedly from the definition of Knuth and Stone—the "algorithm" as a Turing machine program. Rather, it corresponds to what Turing called ''the complete configuration'' (cf Turing's definition in Undecidable, p.&amp;nbsp;118) -- and includes ''both'' the current instruction (state) ''and'' the status of the tape. [cf Kleene (1952) p.&amp;nbsp;375 where he shows an example of a tape with 6 symbols on it—all other squares are blank—and how to Gödelize its combined table-tape status].

In [[Algorithm examples]] we see the '''evolution of the state''' first-hand.

== 1995 – Daniel Dennett: evolution as an algorithmic process==
Philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]] analyses the importance of evolution as an algorithmic process in his 1995 book ''[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea]]''. Dennett identifies three key features of an algorithm:
* '''Substrate neutrality''': an algorithm relies on its ''logical'' structure. Thus, the particular form in which an algorithm is manifested is not important (Dennett's example is long division: it works equally well on paper, on parchment, on a computer screen, or using neon lights or in skywriting). (p.&amp;nbsp;51)
* '''Underlying mindlessness''': no matter how complicated the end-product of the algorithmic process may be, each step in the algorithm is sufficiently simple to be performed by a non-sentient, mechanical device. The algorithm does not require a "brain" to maintain or operate it. "The standard textbook analogy notes that algorithms are ''recipes'' of sorts, designed to be followed by ''novice'' cooks."(p.&amp;nbsp;51)
* '''Guaranteed results''': If the algorithm is executed correctly, it will always produce the same results. "An algorithm is a foolproof recipe." (p.&amp;nbsp;51)

It is on the basis of this analysis that Dennett concludes that "According to Darwin, evolution is an algorithmic process". (p.&amp;nbsp;60).

However, in the previous page he has gone out on a much-further limb.{{According to whom|date=February 2013}} In the context of his chapter titled "Processes as Algorithms", he states:
: "But then . . are there any limits at all on what may be considered an algorithmic process? I guess the answer is NO; if you wanted to, you can treat any process at the abstract level as an algorithmic process. . . If what strikes you as puzzling is the uniformity of the [ocean's] sand grains or the strength of the [tempered-steel] blade, an algorithmic explanation is what will satisfy your curiosity -- and it will be the truth. . . .

: "No matter how impressive the products of an algorithm, the underlying process always consists of nothing but a set of {{sic|individualy}} mindless steps succeeding each other without the help of any intelligent supervision; they are 'automatic' by definition: the workings of an automaton." (p. 59)

It is unclear from the above whether Dennett is stating that the physical world by itself and without observers is [[intrinsic]]ally algorithmic (computational) or whether a symbol-processing observer is what is adding "meaning" to the observations.

== 2002 John Searle adds a clarifying caveat to Dennett's characterization ==
[[Daniel Dennett]] is a proponent of [[Computational theory of mind|strong artificial intelligence]]: the idea that the logical structure of an algorithm is sufficient to explain [[mind]]. [[John Searle]], the creator of the [[Chinese room]] thought experiment, claims that "[[syntax]] [that is, logical structure] is by itself not sufficient for [[semantic]] content [that is, meaning]" {{harv|Searle|2002|p=16}}. In other words, the "meaning" of symbols is relative to the mind that is using them; an algorithm—a logical construct—by itself is insufficient for a mind.

Searle cautions those who claim that algorithmic (computational) processes are [[intrinsic]] to nature (for example, cosmologists, physicists, chemists, etc.):
{{quote
| text=Computation [...] is observer-relative, and this is because computation is defined in terms of symbol manipulation, but the notion of a 'symbol' is not a notion of physics or chemistry. Something is a symbol only if it is used, treated or regarded as a symbol. The Chinese room argument showed that semantics is not intrinsic to syntax. But what this shows is that syntax is not intrinsic to physics. [...] Something is a symbol only relative to some observer, user or agent who assigns a symbolic interpretation to it [...] you can assign a computational interpretation to anything. But if the question asks, "Is consciousness intrinsically computational?" the answer is: ''nothing is intrinsically computational'' [italics added for emphasis]. Computation exists only relative to some agent or observer who imposes a computational interpretation on some phenomenon. This is an obvious point. I should have seen it ten years ago but I did not.

== 2002: Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey specification of Turing machine calculation ==
: ''For examples of this specification-method applied to the addition algorithm "m+n" see [[Algorithm examples]].''

An example in Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey (2002) (pp.&amp;nbsp;31–32) demonstrates the precision required in a complete specification of an algorithm, in this case to add two numbers: m+n. It is similar to the Stone requirements above.

(i) They have discussed the role of "number format" in the computation and selected the "tally notation" to represent numbers:
:: "Certainly computation can be harder in practice with some notations than others... But... it is possible in principle to do in any other notation, simply by translating the data... For purposes of framing a rigorously defined notion of computability, it is convenient to use monadic or tally notation" (p. 25-26)

(ii) At the outset of their example they specify the machine to be used in the computation as a [[Turing machine]]. They have previously specified (p.&amp;nbsp;26) that the Turing-machine will be of the 4-tuple, rather than 5-tuple, variety. For more on this convention see [[Turing machine]].

(iii) Previously the authors have specified that the tape-head's position will be indicated by a subscript to the ''right'' of the scanned symbol. For more on this convention see [[Turing machine]]. (In the following, boldface is added for emphasis):

: "We have not given an official definition of what it is for a numerical function to be computable by a '''Turing machine''', specifying how '''inputs''' or arguments are to be represented on the machine, and how '''outputs''' or values represented. Our specifications for a k-place function from positive integers to positive integers are as follows:
: "(a) ['''Initial number format:'''] The arguments m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ... m&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;,  ... will be represented in monadic [unary] notation by blocks of those numbers of strokes, each block separated from the next by a single blank, on an otherwise blank tape.
:: Example: 3+2, 111B11
: "(b) ['''Initial head location, initial state:'''] Initially, the machine will be scanning the leftmost 1 on the tape, and will be in its initial state, state 1.
:: Example: 3+2, 1&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;111B11

:: Example: 3+2, 1&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;1111
: "(e) ['''Unsuccessful computation -- failure to Halt or Halt with non-standard number format:'''] If the function that is to be computed assigns no value to the arguments that are represented initially on the tape, then the machine either will never halt, or will halt in some nonstandard configuration..."(ibid)
:: Example: B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;11111 or B11&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;111 or B11111&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;

This specification is incomplete: it requires the location of where the instructions are to be placed and their format in the machine--
: (iv) in the finite state machine's TABLE or, in the case of a [[Universal Turing machine]] on the tape, and
: (v) the Table of instructions in a specified format

This later point is important. Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey give a demonstration (p.&amp;nbsp;36) that the predictability of the entries in the table allow one to "shrink" the table by putting the entries in sequence and omitting the input state and the symbol. Indeed, the example Turing machine computation required only the 4 columns as shown in the table below (but note: these were presented to the machine in ''rows''):

== 2006: Sipser's assertion and his three levels of description ==
: ''For examples of this specification-method applied to the addition algorithm "m+n" see [[Algorithm examples]].''

Sipser begins by defining '"algorithm" as follows:
: "Informally speaking, an ''algorithm'' is a collection of simple instructions for carrying out some task. Commonplace in everyday life, algorithms sometimes are called ''procedures'' or ''recipes'' (italics in original, p. 154)

: "...our real focus from now on is on algorithms. That is, the Turing machine merely serves as a precise model for the definition of algorithm .... we need only to be comfortable enough with Turing machines to believe that they capture all algorithms" ( p. 156)

Does Sipser mean that "algorithm" is just "instructions" for a Turing machine, or is the combination of "instructions + a (specific variety of) Turing machine"? For example, he defines the two standard variants (multi-tape and non-deterministic) of his particular variant (not the same as Turing's original) and goes on, in his Problems (pages 160-161), to describes four more variants (write-once, doubly infinite tape (i.e. left- and right-infinite), left reset, and "stay put instead of left). In addition, he imposes some constraints. First, the input must be encoded as a string (p. 157) and says of numeric encodings in the context of complexity theory:
: "But note that unary notation for encoding numbers (as in the number 17 encoded by the uary string 11111111111111111) isn't reasonable because it is exponentially larger than truly reasonable encodings, such as base ''k'' notation for any ''k'' ≥ 2."(p. 259)

van Emde Boas comments on a similar problem with respect to the [[random access machine]] (RAM) abstract model of computation sometimes used in place of the Turing machine when doing "analysis of algorithms":
"The absence or presence of multiplicative and parallel bit manipulation operations is of relevance for the correct understanding of some results in the analysis of algorithms.

". . . [T]here hardly exists such as a thing as an "innocent" extension of the standard RAM model in the uniform time measures; either one only has additive arithmetic or one might as well include all reasonable multiplicative and/or bitwise Boolean instructions on small operands." (van Emde Boas, 1990:26)

With regards to a "description language" for algorithms Sipser finishes the job that Stone and Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey started (boldface added). He offers us three levels of description of Turing machine algorithms (p.&amp;nbsp;157):
: '''High-level description''': "wherein we use ... prose to describe an algorithm, ignoring the implementation details. At this level we do not need to mention how the machine manages its tape or head."

: '''Implementation description''': "in which we use ... prose to describe the way that the Turing machine moves its head and the way that it stores data on its tape. At this level we do not give details of states or transition function."

: '''Formal description''': "... the lowest, most detailed, level of description... that spells out in full the Turing machine's states, transition function, and so on."

Although attitudes tend to guide attitude-relevant behavior, those held with ambivalence tend to do so to a lesser extent.

For this reason, researchers have considered two forms of ambivalence, only one of which is subjectively experienced as a state of conflict.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

== Types of attitudinal ambivalence ==

=== Felt ambivalence ===
The psychological literature has distinguished between several different forms of ambivalence.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  One, often called '''subjective ambivalence''' or felt ambivalence, represents the [[Subjective experience|psychological experience]] of conflict (affective manifestation), mixed feelings, mixed reactions (cognitive manifestation), and indecision (behavioral manifestation) in the evaluation of some object.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Thompson, M. M., Zanna, M. P., &amp; Griffin, D. W. (1995). Let's not be indifferent about (attitudinal) ambivalence. In R. E. Petty &amp; J. A. Krosnick (Eds.), ''Attitude strength: Antecedents and consequences'' (pp. 361-386). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103114000134|title = Wanting other attitudes: Actual-desired attitude discrepancies predict feelings of ambivalence and ambivalence consequences|author1=DeMarree K.G. |author2=Wheeler S.C. |author3=Brinol P. |author4=Petty R.E. |date = July 2014|journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|accessdate = November 3, 2014|doi = 10.1016/j.jesp.2014.02.001|pmid =|volume=53|pages=5–18|hdl = 10486/666333}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ambivalence is not always acknowledged by the individual experiencing it. Although, when the individual becomes aware to a varying degree, discomfort is felt, which is elicited by the conflicting attitudes about a particular stimulus.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Subjective ambivalence is generally assessed using direct [[self-report]] measures regarding one's experience of conflict about the topic of interest.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Attitudes and Attitude Change: Attitudinal Ambivalence|author1=Conner M |author2=Armitage C.J. |publisher = Psychology Press|year = 2008|isbn = |location = New York, NY|pages = 261–286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because subjective ambivalence is a secondary judgment of a primary evaluation (i.e., I'm conflicted ''of'' my positive attitude towards the president), it is considered to be [[Metacognition|metacognitive]]. The point of these measures is to find out how much a person experiences ambivalence in a particular evaluation. Their report may be provided in a number of ways.

Priester and Petty, for example, utilized a rating system where they had subjects rate the level of conflict they were experiencing on a scale from 0 (as in the subject experienced "no conflict at all") to 10 (as in the subject experienced "maximum conflict").&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; However, people do not like to experience the negative emotions associated with ambivalence and therefore may not acknowledge, or report, their level of conflict as accurately as possible. This makes the measure of felt ambivalence a bit less reliable than a researcher may desire.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== Potential ambivalence ===
Another measure of ambivalence that has been developed is called '''objective ambivalence''' or potential ambivalence, which represents the simultaneous acknowledgement of both positive and negative evaluations regarding a particular stimulus. Objective ambivalence is an indirect measure of attitude conflict that allows individuals to answer questions based on more accessible aspects of their attitude and is therefore generally viewed as an advantageous means of measurement. This indirect measure does not assume that the individual has complete knowledge and/or awareness of their attitudinal conflict and helps to eliminate confounding factors that may be affecting their attitudes.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Objective ambivalence is generally assessed using a method first developed by Kaplan, in which a standard bipolar attitude scale (e.g., extremely negative to extremely positive) is split into two separate scales, each independently assessing the magnitude of one valence (e.g., not at all negative to extremely negative).&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; If a person endorses both positive and negative reactions towards the same object, then at least some objective ambivalence is present.

Kaplan initially operationalized ambivalence as the lesser of the two reactions (i.e., positive or negative evaluations), also called conflicting reactions (and contrasted with dominant reactions).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For example, if objective ambivalence towards exercising was assessed using two separate 6-point scales, and a person indicated that his or her evaluation was slightly negative (e.g., 2 on a 6-point scale) and extremely positive (e.g., 6 on a 6-point scale), this person's ambivalence would be quantified by the lesser of these two evaluations (i.e., 2 in this example).

&lt;u&gt;Kaplan's measure yields the formula&lt;/u&gt;: &lt;math&gt;Ambivalence = S+L - |S-L|=S&lt;/math&gt;

Here, S is representative of the smaller rating or reaction, and the L is representative of the larger rating or reaction.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

However, Kaplan's measure has largely been replaced in practice by one proposed by Thompson et al.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Thompson' s formula fulfills the three necessary conditions for any scale measuring ambivalence as suggested by Breckler.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/47/6/1191/|title = Empirical validation of affect, behavior, and cognition as distinct components of attitude|author= Breckler, Steven J.|date = 1984|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|accessdate = November 12, 2014|doi =10.1037/0022-3514.47.6.1191 |pmid =|volume=47|issue = 6|pages=1191–1205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three conditions are as follows:
# If the larger value is maintained, while the smaller rating increases, ambivalence will increase. 
# If the smaller value is maintained, while the larger rating increases, ambivalence will decrease.
# If both the larger and smaller values are the same, ambivalence will increase when both ratings increase (as the difference between the two will increase) or decrease as the values decrease.
&lt;u&gt;Thompson et al. refined Kaplan's formula to incorporate Breckler's components:&lt;/u&gt; &lt;math&gt;Ambivalence= (S+L)/2-|S-L|&lt;/math&gt;

The creation of this formula was pivotal because it accounts for both subjective and objective ratings.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Predictors of felt ambivalence ===
Research has shown only a moderate [[correlation]] between felt and potential ambivalence, although, both measures are useful depending on what is being asked. Potential ambivalence is often utilized by ambivalence researchers to gather more information about diversity of attitudes across contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Scope of Social Psychology: Theory and Applications (A Festschrift for Wolfgang Stroebe)|authors = Jonas, K., &amp; Ziegler, R.|publisher = Psychology|year = 2007|isbn = 9781135419745|location = |pages = 32–34|title-link = Wolfgang Stroebe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each individual experiences the after-effects of unpleasant feelings in a different way, whether or not associated with ambivalence awareness.

There are two primary moderators that link felt and potential ambivalence: ''simultaneous accessibility'' and ''preference for consistency''.

'''Simultaneous accessibility''' is when potential ambivalence depends on how quickly and uniformly conflicting evaluations come to mind.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Positive and negative knowledge regarding beliefs about an attitude object are concurrently known, but not always accessible. Only when the connection of the evaluations are applicable and coinciding to awareness, does potential ambivalence result in felt ambivalence.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

'''Preference for consistency''' uses incentives to combine incoming stimuli with current variables in order to respond to approaching impulses. In other words, people often review past behaviors when making new decisions; if preference for consistency is high, they are more likely to ignore new information and are thus bias to past behaviors.

== Dimensions of attitudinal assessment as applied to ambivalence   ==

=== One-dimensional perspective ===
Traditionally, attitudes were considered one-dimensional—from positive to negative—but given the rise of research findings, this perspective has lost much of its value. Ambivalence studies were a primary reason that attitudinal assessments demanded a new design. Because the basic assumption of an ambivalent attitude is that it is paradoxical, a one-dimensional perspective is likely to portray faulty information. For instance, a numerical rating of zero can be produced both by someone with a [[Love hate relationship|love-hate relationship]] toward an object, and someone who is completely indifferent about that object.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Psychology of Attitudes and Attitude Change|author1=Maio, Gregory |author2=Haddock, Geoffrey |publisher = Sage Publications Inc.|year = 2009|isbn = 978-1-4129-2974-5|location = Thousand Oaks, California|pages = 33–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a significant difference in the behaviors and experiences of those possessing strong conflicting attitudes, compared to those who are simply neutral. This perspective is unsuitable for examining ambivalence and based on current research does not appear to accurately reflect  how attitudes function and are experienced.

=== Two-dimensional perspective ===
The two-dimensional perspective separately rates positive and negative attitudes toward an attitudinal object.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The relative magnitude of positive and negative rankings are recognized by this model, providing a distinction between ambivalence and indifference. By comparing the magnitude of attitudes, the two-dimensional perspective also allows for an approximation of the degree of ambivalence; similarity in the magnitude of an individual’s positive and negative attitude towards an object indicating ambivalence, and the strength of these attitudes reveals its degree. The two-dimensional view can report everything the one-dimensional perspective can, but it has the added ability to account for ambivalence.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Though this model of attitude is clearly more useful for understanding and potentially assessing ambivalence than a one dimensional model it still suffers numerous paradoxes which are difficult to argue away without acknowledging that there is more contributing to one's attitudes and their stability than perceptions regarding the object alone.  These issues prompt the recent emergence of multidimensional models.

=== Multidimensional perspective ===
The Multidimensional model for attitude deviates from the linear perspectives previously mentioned. Conceptually the multidimensional model can be thought of as a network of attitudinal hubs which form a web of contributions contributing to one's attitude about a particular object.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Thus ones attitude toward an object is a product of the attitudes one holds for all related objects which are activated consciously or unconsciously when considering the object in question, and is not simply an attribution regarding the object alone in a vacuum. Ambivalence occurs when there are near equal weight of contributions of both positive and negative sources according to this perspective. Note in this view the ambivalent attitude is not tied directly to the object but rather the near equivalence of positive and negative contributing attitudes.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

This model is very useful for understanding why attitude towards an object can fluctuate often within a relatively short span. If this model is accurate than a change in the degree of activation of particular objects related to the attitudinal object in question will alter the degree to which they contribute their attitudinal influence towards one's current attitude regarding the object in question.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; This allows for variance in attitude towards an object without requiring any permanent change in one's beliefs regarding neither the object nor the objects related to it. According to this model one's attitude towards eating a high calorie dessert food would likely become more positive during times when an individual is hungry, as the centers associated with the satiation property of food are now more active and contributing more influence to the attitude regarding consuming the dessert. The other contributing attitudes do not need to have been suppressed (though they can be) for the temporary change in attitude all that is required, is an increase in the output of one contributor.

Continued or repeated activation of the same related objects to a given attitudinal object will likely be reinforced and over time lend more stability to the attitude, and are likely to diminish the activation of those objects not strongly activated; however it should be noted that the contributing objects are themselves also subject to changes in attitudes regarding
them, so no final resolution of stability will necessarily occur. In addition if the same conflicting attitudinal contributors are continuing to “fire together” they  will both be reinforced and thus may not contribute towards the resolution of ambivalence.

=== Meta-cognitive model ===
Not all attitude objects are linked to both positive and negative relations. This model is built on the idea that [[meta-cognition]] has to do with "knowing about knowing." The process works if someone has the knowledge about cognition and is also able to control their thoughts. An evaluation creates initial thoughts that are then analyzed by a secondary thought which may vary in strength toward an assessment. Once an evaluation is obtained, the strength of the validity affects how the interpretation is perceived. If a successful univalent attitude is achieved, final evaluations are labelled as either true or false based on varying degrees of confidence.&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Petty, P.E., Brinol, P., DeMarree, K. (2007). The
meta-cognitive model of attitudes: Implications for Attitude measurement,
change, and strength. [[Attitude (psychology)|Social Cognition.]]Vol 25, No. 5, 662, p.[[Attitude (psychology)|657-686]].
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consistency theories and ambivalence ==

=== Overview ===
Cognitive consistency theories were established on the premise that individuals prefer dependable and coherent cognition. Inconsistency in one's thoughts, feelings, emotions, values, beliefs, attitudes, or behaviors causes tension. In the past, consistency theorists focused primarily on the instinctive drive to reduce this psychological discomfort and return to a simple, balanced state. Unlike classical approaches, however, theories of attitudinal ambivalence are more concerned with the ''perceived ''[[paradoxical]] state itself.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Balance theory ===
[[Fritz Heider]] established the first approach in the growing family of consistency theories; [[balance theory]] seeks to understand one's thoughts regarding their personal relationship with others and with the environment. [[Triadic relation]]ships are used to evaluate the structure and quality of attitudes within a given arrangement.

Social ties, for example, can be analyzed in terms of an individual's perception of the relationships between his or her self ''(p)'', another person ''(o), ''and the topic (e.g., issue, belief, value, object) of focus ''(x)''. According to Heider, a balanced triangle is accomplished when all three links are positive, or two are negative and one is positive (since a positive number is still achieved).

The overall assumption of balance theory is rooted in the philosophy that unbalanced states have a tendency to wreak havoc.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Satisfying relationships require balance, otherwise, it is not uncommon to experience consequences like stress, tension, or ambivalence.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Evaluative-cognitive consistency theory ===
Evaluative-cognitive consistency theory refers to a condition in which one holds opposing attitudes towards an object that are not of equal magnitude; the focus is the overall difference in evaluations, with no regard to magnitude.

“Ambivalence is a function of the ''amount of conflict'' within an attitude, whereas evaluative-cognitive consistency is a function of the ''magnitude of the difference'' between evaluations.”&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Handbook of Attitudes |last= Albarracin |last2=Johnson |last3=Zanna |first= Dolores |first2=Blair |first3=Mark |publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|year = 2005|isbn = |location = Mahwah, New Jersey|page = 332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a set of dimension scores, for example, positive 5 and negative 5 have the same degree of consistency as does the set of positive 9 and negative 1. Yet, the degree of ambivalence in each set is vastly different. This distinction is important when examining the implications and effects of ambivalence, since seemingly similar ratings are in fact quite different.

The two-dimensional perspective of attitudinal assessment can distinguish between ambivalence and evaluative-cognitive consistency. As ratings increase, both ambivalence and evaluative-cognitive consistency have a tendency to be less stable and less effective at predicting behavior.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Past studies have linked ambivalent mental states to slower response times (due to low accessibility) and mild attitudes, although theories of evaluative-cognitive consistency have yet to report such findings.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

=== Cognitive dissonance theory ===
The feeling of discomfort that results from inconsistent cognition is a powerful determinant of human behavior.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The emergence of research on intellectual tension dates back to the mid-20th century, and has been a hot topic in [[social psychology]] ever since. In 1957, [[Leon Festinger]] was the first to investigate the phenomenon, thereupon coining the theory of [[cognitive dissonance]].&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The Concepts of Balance, Congruity, and Dissonance |last=Zajonc |first=Robert B. |author-link=Robert Zajonc |journal=[[Public Opinion Quarterly]] |date=Summer 1960 |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=280–296 |doi=10.1086/266949 |jstor=2746406}}&lt;/ref&gt; Festinger and other early psychologists held the notion that cognitive dissonance was the result of any ''two ''conflicting thoughts or opinions. Currently, however, research has proven that not all cognitive inconsistencies are equally upsetting, for it is not necessarily the dissonance itself that causes strife, rather, it is the individuals construct of the given contention.

Dissonance, then, is characterized as a discrepancy between an attitude held by an individual and the actual behavior that is practiced by that individual, whereas ambivalence is seen as having a disparity within the attitude itself.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Though unique, the ambivalent state, still, is closely connected to dissonance theory, being its most common product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://psp.sagepub.com/content/39/6/735.full.pdf+html|title = Feeling Conflicted and Seeking Information: When Ambivalence Enhances and Diminishes Selective Exposure to  Attitude-Consistent Information |authors=Sawicki, Wegener, Clark, Fabrigar, Smith, Durso |date=2013 |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |doi=10.1177/0146167213481388 |pmid=23482502 |volume=39 |issue=6 |pages=735–747}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals seek to satisfy a stable and positive self-image.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; For this reason, the greatest tension is encountered when there is an incongruity between who one thinks they are and their actual behavior. Such threats to [[self-esteem]] evoke motivation to rid oneself of the distress. According to present research, there are three widely accepted methods to reduce cognitive dissonance:
# Justify the behavior by changing the dissonant cognition
# Justify the behavior by adding new cognitions
# Change the behavior to meet the dissonant cognition

== Motivation and information processing ==
As noted above, the desire to maintain one's preconceived notions can have vast implications. Studies have shown it is not uncommon for people to distort reality while attempting reduce ambivalence. The manner by which one chooses to replace unwanted thoughts is mostly an unconscious process, yet several factors influence the ability and likelihood of doing so.

=== Heuristic-systematic model ===
Information processing for ambivalent attitudes is less efficient and takes longer than processing of attitudes that are relatively univalent. The information is less accessible, so it takes longer for a person to integrate multiple viewpoints regarding an attitude object into one cohesive opinion or judgement.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Conner, M., &amp; Armitage, C. J. (2008). Attitudinal ambivalence. In W. D. Crano &amp; R. Prislin (Eds.), ''Attitudes and attitude change'' (pp. 261-286). New York, NY: Psychology Press.
&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of accessibility here does serve to reduce a biased thought process. Yet, since it takes a greater amount of effort to resolve two conflicting attitudes, if one desires to form a conclusion, a more extensive thought process is necessary.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

== Antecedents of ambivalence ==

=== Behavioral indicators ===
Researchers have sought to understand the relationship between objective and subjective ambivalence. Thompson and his colleagues argue that people with positive and negative evaluations which are of similar magnitude (e.g., +4 and -3) should experience more ambivalence than people whose evaluations are of dissimilar magnitude (e.g., +4 and -1). Similarly, they argue that even with relatively similar positive and negative evaluations, people whose evaluations are more extreme (e.g., +6 and -5) should experience more ambivalence than people whose evaluations are less extreme (e.g., +2 and -1).

&lt;u&gt;The Griffin formula, also known as the similarity-intensity model&lt;/u&gt;: &lt;math&gt;Ambivalence = (P + N) / 2 - |P-N|&lt;/math&gt;

Here, P and N are the magnitude of positive and negative reactions, respectively.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Some research has stated that as the relative contribution of dominant reactions decreases, the magnitude of conflicting reactions increases.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Other studies have found that objective ambivalence predicts subjective ambivalence to a greater extent when both the positive and negative reactions are accessible, or when a decision about the attitude object is imminent.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Still, more evidence has demonstrated that objective ambivalence is not the only precursor to subjective ambivalence. For example, '''interpersonal ambivalence''', the presence of attitudes which are in conflict with those of important others, independently predicts subjective ambivalence, as does the mere anticipation of information which may conflict with one's preexisting attitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Priester | first1 = J. R. | last2 = Petty | first2 = R. E. | last3 = Park | first3 = K. | year = 2007 | title = Whence univalent ambivalence? From the anticipation of conflicting reactions | url = | journal = Journal of Consumer Research | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 11–21 | doi = 10.1086/513042 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both personal and circumstantial aspects must be considered in order to accurately assess relationship sustainability between subjective and objective ambivalence.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

=== Individual differences ===
Individual characteristics are essential in deciding the most beneficial coping strategies. Research has shown that certain personality traits may impact an individuals likelihood of experiencing ambivalence. There are certain personality traits that aren't as relevant to ambivalence, such as the need for closure. Other components may alter these traits that may contribute toward ambivalence, such as tolerance to ambiguity. Particularly, those possessing the [[need for cognition]], or the inclination to evaluate the discrepancies between positive and negative emotions, are less likely to experience ambivalence. In other words, the desire to resolve issues, which requires a great deal of cognitive resources, fosters cognitive strength and thus the ability to overcome ambivalence.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Ambivalent attitudes that demonstrate weakness are accessed slower than strong attitudes. This leads to a conflict called response competition; the process of slowing down responses because of the difficulty to choose between positive and negative beliefs and feelings. Bottom-up processing shows how greater cognitive effort entwined with combined beliefs results in non congruent information. Once individuals are confronted several choices, they are then followed by uncertain outcomes.&lt;ref name="Van Harreveld 2009" /&gt; Thus concluding that slower response times may be due to systematic processing.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Individuals with a greater concern for invalidity experience a heightened amount of ambivalence, presumably because they are concerned with making wrongful judgments, and as a result, efforts to adjust attitude become inhibited.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Response to ambivalence, then, is affected by an individual's need for consistency; hence, the higher the need for consistency, the more adverse the reaction will be to maintaining two contradictory attitudes simultaneously, whereas someone with a reduced need for consistency will experience less mental frustration&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Those seeking to rectify inconsistencies and resolve conflict are able to reject ambivalence better than most.

Additionally, some individuals have a more pronounced fear of invalidity than others. When this fear is experienced to a stronger degree, these individuals will not want to acknowledge the ambivalence as it is especially uncomfortable. Since the ambiguity is not being resolved, it will persist within the person.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt;Gebauer, Maio, and Pakizeh discuss the possibility that many perfectionists, despite the seemingly positive qualities exerted, are at risk of neglecting internal inconsistencies. Consequently, it is not unlikely for those individuals to confront a plethora of unexplained, ambivalent feelings.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== Goal conflicts ===
Ambivalence will emerge when two (or more) goals valued by an individual are in conflict regarding the same attitudinal object. The individual becomes ambivalent about the object to which they both reference, not as much when regarding the individual goals themselves.

Many decisions as common as food consumption or selection can invoke some degree of ambivalence
every day. An action can seem to have pleasant outcomes, but it can simultaneously cause issues as well.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Emotions or attitudes that are ambivalent may spark both quick and far-off consequences that are inconsistent.&lt;ref name="Van Harreveld 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van Harreveld | first1 = F. | last2 = van der Pligt | first2 = J. | last3 = de Liver | first3 = Y. | year = 2009 | title = The agony of ambivalence and ways to resolve it: Introducing the MAID model | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Review | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 45–61 | doi = 10.1177/1088868308324518 | pmid=19144904}}&lt;/ref&gt; A chronic dieter, for example, may experience ambivalence between the goals of eating enjoyment and weight control. Each of these goals independently are viewed as positive, but when conjoined in regards to actually eating more food, the resulting conflict prompts ambivalence. The object of eating enjoyment and the object of losing weight are both regarded with positive attitude, but these two goals are incongruent with each other and are both activated when considering eating.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

The goal driven ambivalence that produces several forms of behavior modification may have profound implications on the behaviors and outcomes. Some examples are overcoming addiction, procrastination, health maintenance, and many others. Much of the focus of previous work has been concentrated on pain avoidance and pleasure seeking (focus on the ambivalent object itself), and not enough to the "pleasure" goal objectives related to and driving the conflict. Under certain circumstances, people who are exposed to unpleasant experiences are motivated to decrease unpleasant feelings toward ambivalence. One way to accomplish such a task is by acquiring new knowledge that can result in more immediate conclusions about the attitude object, or result in an adjustment in the individuals attitudes regarding the contributing goals which prompted the conflict.

Ambivalent attitudes that demonstrate weakness are accessed slower than strong attitudes and are thought to have less of an influence on behavior. This leads to a conflict called response competition; the process of slowing down responses because of the difficulty to choose between positive and negative beliefs and feelings. Bottom-up processing shows how greater cognitive effort entwined with combined beliefs results in incongruent information. Once individuals are confronted several choices, they are then followed by uncertain outcomes.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Thus concluding that slower response times may be due to systematic processing.&lt;ref name="Van Harreveld 2009"/&gt;

=== Value conflicts ===
Ambivalence is often the result of conflict arising from personal or social values. Different cultures, and the individuals within them, have different values surrounding race, ethnicity, nationality, class, religion or beliefs, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, and health status. [[Social constructs]] and perceived norms and [[values]] within a given society create contradictory feelings for many individuals. If opposing values are activated by the same object they are likely to clash upon encounter.

Conflicted value items do not need to come from the same category, but to be considered a contributor of ambivalence, discordance must occur.

The attitudinal object of women in the workplace could, for example, be affected by religious or political values. The contributing value systems are both held in positive regard but are opposed to each other in reference to the attitudinal ambivalent item. The amount of ambivalence experienced corresponds to the positive regard of each value contributing to the conflict. In other words, weakly held conflicting values should not generate as much ambivalence as strongly held values.

=== Affective-cognitive ambivalence ===
Affective ambivalence (A+/A-) refers to disparity between feelings, whereas cognitive ambivalence (C+/C-) focuses on the disagreement between beliefs. Together, the notion of affective-cognitive ambivalence (A+/C-) or (A-/C+) embodies the commonly known conundrum of “''the heart vs. mind conflict.''”

When each state is in balance, the influence on attitude is equal (A+/C+). Yet, there is compelling evidence that affect tends to overpower cognition (A+/C-).&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

That is to say, the degree of ambivalence construed at any given moment can alter the mechanisms by which one views the world. When ambivalent cognitive states become psychologically agonizing, motivation rises to eliminate distress.&lt;ref name="Van Harreveld 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hass | first1 = R.

== Consequences of ambivalence as a dimension of attitude strength ==

=== Attitude stability ===
Ambivalence is often conceptualized as a negative predictor of attitude strength.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; That is, as an attitude becomes more ambivalent, its strength decreases. Strong attitudes are those that are stable over time, resistant to change, and predict behavior and information processing.&lt;ref&gt;Krosnick, J. A., &amp; Petty, R. E. (1995). Attitude strength: An overview. In R. E. Petty &amp; J. A. Krosnick (Eds.), ''Attitude strength: Antecedents and consequences'' (pp. 1-24). Mahwah, NJ:  Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have found that ambivalent attitudes are less stable over time, less resistant to change, and less predictive of behavior.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://psp.sagepub.com/content/26/11/1421.short|title = Attitudinal Ambivalence: A Test of Three Key Hypothesis|last = Armitage |last2=Conner|first =Christopher J. | first2= Mark |date = 2000|journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |accessdate = November 3, 2014|doi =10.1177/0146167200263009 |pmid =|volume=26|issue = 11|pages=1421–1432}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Haddock | first1 = G | year = 2003 | title = Making a party leader less of a party member: The impact of ambivalence on assimilation and contrast effects in political party attitudes | url = | journal = Political Psychology | volume = 24 | issue = 4| pages = 769–780 | doi = 10.1046/j.1467-9221.2003.00353.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambivalent attitudes are subject to change based on the concepts, feelings, or objects that are salient at the time. Since an ambivalent attitude is one in which positive and negative feelings are held simultaneously, the strength of either may wax or wane depending on what context the individual finds themselves in; different aspects of an attitude may be activated across situations.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== Attitude pliability ===
Ambivalent attitudes are known to be susceptible to [[persuasion]].&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Since there is less certainty associated with an ambivalent attitude, both facts and trivial information are assessed, assimilated, and determinant of one's attitude. Accordingly, this may [[bias]] or persuade an individual's attitude. Strong attitudes, on the other hand, are less likely to be manipulated because they are essentially "anchored in knowledge structures".&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

Armitage and Conner conducted a study regarding attitudes toward eating a low-fat diet.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Attitudes of a high ambivalence group and a low ambivalence group were recorded two times within five months. Following an attitude change intervention the high ambivalence group demonstrated a significant positive change in attitude toward the diet (compared to a control group) whereas the low ambivalence group demonstrated very little change if any.

In situations that highlight one dimension over the other, individuals who are high in ambivalence are more likely to embrace the clear-cut better aspect of the attitude object.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

== Ambivalence in clinical psychology ==
=== Bleuler's tripartite scheme ===
The concept of ambivalence was introduced into psychiatric parlance by [[Eugen Bleuler]], who used it in print for the first time in his 1910 article ''Vortrag über Ambivalenz''.&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} {{cite journal | last=Bleuler |first=Eugen |authorlink=Eugen Bleuler |title=Vortrag über Ambivalenz |trans-title=Lecture on Ambivalence |url=http://www.sgipt.org/medppp/gesch/ambiv-g.htm#Aus%20dem%20Zentralblatt%20f%C3%BCr%20Psychoanalyse%201,%201911,%20S. |journal=Zentralblatt für Psychoanalyse [Central Journal for Psychoanalysis] |location=[[Bern]] |year=1910 |issue=1 |pages=266-268}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Laplanche |first1=Jean |last2=Pontalis |first2=Jean-Bertrand |authorlink1=Jean Laplanche |authorlink2=Jean-Bertrand Pontalis |chapter=Ambivalence (pp. 26–28) |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/?id=DCpokE8C2WgC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=Ambivalence+Ambivalenz |title=The Language of Psycho-analysis |url=https://books.google.com/?id=DCpokE8C2WgC&amp;printsec=frontcover |publisher=Karnac Books |location=London |year=1988 |edition=reprint, revised |origyear=[https://books.google.com/?id=tV99AAAAMAAJ 1973] |isbn=978-0-946-43949-2 |page=[https://books.google.it/books?id=DCpokE8C2WgC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;dq=%22Bleuler,+E.+%27Vortrag+iiber+Ambivalenz%27+(1910)%22 28]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. Gay, ''Freud'' (1989) p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; Bleuler distinguished three main types of ambivalence: volitional, intellectual, and emotional.&lt;ref&gt;Angela Richards ed, Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) p. 128n.&lt;/ref&gt; Volitional ambivalence refers to an inability to decide on an action—what [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]] called "a spirit justly balanced betweene two equal desires".&lt;ref&gt;Montaigne, ''Essays Vol II'' (1938) p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept (if not Bleuler's term) had a long prehistory, reaching back through [[Buridan's ass]], starving between two equally attractive bales of hay in the Middle Ages, to [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref&gt;Dante, ''Paradise'' (1975) p. 81-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Intellectual ambivalence—the [[Philosophical scepticism|sceptical belief]] that "There is no reason but hath a contrary to it"&lt;ref&gt;Montaigne, ''Essays Vol II'' (1938) p. 334&lt;/ref&gt; —also follows a long tradition reaching back through Montaigne to [[Sextus Empiricus]] and [[Pyrrho]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Boardman ed, ''The Oxford History of the Classical World'' (1991) p. 715-6 and p. 842.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Freud]] considered Bleuler's stress on intellectual ambivalence particularly appropriate given his own ambivalence towards Freud's intellectual constructs, alternatively praising and criticizing them).&lt;ref&gt;E. Jones, ''The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud'' (1964) p. 354&lt;/ref&gt; Emotional ambivalence involved opposing affective attitudes towards the same object, as with the man who both loved and hated his wife.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bleger et al, ''Symbiosis and Ambiguity'' (2013) p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

While mainly dealing with ambivalence in relation to the [[Splitting (psychology)|psychological splitting]] of schizophrenia, Bleuler also noted how "in the dreams of healthy persons, affective as well as intellectual ambivalence is a common phenomenon".&lt;ref&gt;J. Bleger et al, ''Symbiosis and Ambiguity'' (2013) p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Freudian usage ===
Freud was swift to pickup Bleuler's concept of ambivalence, applying it to areas he had previously dealt with in terms of ambiguous language,&lt;ref&gt;J. Bleger et al, ''Symbiosis and Ambiguity'' (2013) p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; or the persistent co-existence of love and hatred aimed at the same person.&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''Case Studies II'' (PFL 9) p. 118-9&lt;/ref&gt; Freud also extended the scope of Bleuler's term to cover the co-existence of active and passive trends in the same instinctual impulse&lt;ref&gt;J. Bleger et al, ''Symbiosis and Ambiguity'' (2013) p.  261&lt;/ref&gt;—what Freud called "pairs of contrary component instincts" such as looking and being looked at.&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''Case Studies II'' (PFL 9) p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Abraham]] explored the presence of ambivalence in mourning—something he thought to be a universal phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;D. Leader, ''The New Black'' (2008) p. 61-6&lt;/ref&gt; Others in [[psychoanalysis]] have traced the roots of contradictory impulses (usually love and hate) to very early stages of [[psychosexual development]].&lt;ref&gt;Erik H. Erikson, ''Childhood and Society'' (1973) p. 72-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Defences against feeling both of the two contradictory emotions include [[psychological repression]], [[Isolation (psychology)|isolation]] and [[Displacement (psychology)|displacement]].&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 157 and p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, for example, an [[analysand|analytic patient]]'s love for his father might be quite consciously experienced and openly expressed—while his "hate" for the same object might be heavily repressed and only indirectly expressed, and thus only revealed in analysis.  A [[Substance dependence|drug addict]] may feel ambivalently about their drug of choice; they are aware of their drug use as a negative-impact agent in their lives (socially, financially, physically, etc.) while simultaneously seeking and using the drug because of the positive-impact results they receive from the drug's usage (the "high"). (More recent discourse of addiction as a mental health concern and chemically-induced/encoded ''imperative'', rather than as a behavioral ''choice'', complicates the notion of ambivalence as it relates to addiction.)

Another relevant distinction is that whereas the psychoanalytic notion of "ambivalence" sees it as engendered by all [[neurosis|neurotic]] [[Emotional conflict|conflict]], a person's everyday "mixed feelings" may easily be based on a quite realistic assessment of the imperfect nature of the thing being considered.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==Ambivalence in philosophy==
Philosophers such as Hili Razinsky consider how ambivalence relates to other aspects of the human experience, such as personhood, action, and judgement, and what it means that strict ambivalence is possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Razinsky |first=Hili |title=Ambivalence.

'''Amy Bailey''' '''[[Order of Jamaica|OJ]]''', '''[[Order of Distinction|OD]]''', '''[[Order of the British Empire|OBE]]''', '''MBE''' (27 November 1895 – 3 October 1990) was a [[Jamaicans|Jamaican]] educator, social worker and women's rights advocate. She was a co-founder of the Jamaican aid organization Save the Children and was the driving force behind the drive for introducing birth control to the island. She received many honours and awards in her career, including the [[Order of the British Empire]], the Jamaican [[Order of Distinction]] and the Marcus Garvey Award for Excellence in 1988. In 1990, shortly before her death, she was honoured with the [[Order of Jamaica]].

==Early life==
Amy Beckford Bailey was born on 27 November 1895{{sfn|Smith|1988|p=11}} in Walderston, [[Manchester Parish]], [[Jamaica]],{{sfn|Rose|3/1978}} to Anne (née Lawson) and William Frederick Bailey.{{sfn|Smith|1988|p=11}} Bailey was the fifth of eight children born{{sfn|Grinam|8 February 1990|p=16}} to her parents who were both teachers.{{sfn|Smith|1988|p=11}} Her father was the founder of the Jamaica Union of Teachers and encouraged all of his children to become teachers, as there were few other opportunities open to black Jamaicans.{{sfn|Rose|3/1978}}{{sfn|Smith|1988|p=11}} After attending elementary school at Mount Olivet Primary School, Bailey studied at Shortwood Teacher’s College,{{sfn|Rose|3/1978}} graduating in 1917.{{sfn|Smith|1988|p=11}} Soon thereafter, she was stricken with severe [[dysmenorrhea]]. While recuperating, she studied on her own to earn accounting, bookkeeping,{{sfn|Grinam|8 February 1990|p=16}} and shorthand.{{sfn|Smith|1988|p=11}}

==Career==
In January 1920, Bailey began teaching at the Kingston Technical High School (KTHS),{{sfn|Grinam|8 February 1990|p=16}} when she was hired to replace her sister who was taking a three-month leave of absence. Ivy didn't return to the school, and Bailey, who began as a shorthand instructor, remained until 1958.{{sfn|Smith|1988|p=11}} After she retired from KTHS, Bailey taught at the College of Arts Science and Technology between 1958 and 1963.{{sfn|Rose|8/1978}}

==Public social work==
In 1936,{{sfn|Altink|2011|p=517}} Bailey and her sister Ina founded the Women’s Liberal Club (WLC), with the goal of helping women improve their employment opportunities, as rarely were women promoted for their qualifications, but instead by having to curry favour from prominent men.{{sfn|Rose|8/1978}} They believed that by improving the socio-economic status of women, they would improve their cultural and national pride. In 1939 WLC organized a conference to allow women to discuss the problems they faced. Issues they highlighted were that women were barred from participation in the Legislative Council; could not be appointed as officials, such as inspectors, jurors, justices of the peace, or police officers; were barred from upper positions in civil service jobs;{{sfn|Altink|2011|p=517}} and that racial discrimination impacted their employment opportunity.{{sfn|Altink|2011|p=520}} Bailey formalized these issues into recommendations, which were submitted to the governor in 1941 and led to a law prohibiting sex discrimination. The law allowed women to hold public office and eliminated employment bans for women.{{sfn|Altink|2011|p=517}}

Concerned with the discrimination she saw in the class hierarchy enshrined in Jamaica at the time, Bailey wrote a series of editorials that were published in ''[[Gleaner Company|The Gleaner]]''. She openly addressed the racial discrimination that relegated black-skinned Jamaicans to menial jobs and poverty, brown-skinned Jamaicans to middle-class blue-collar jobs and white Jamaicans to positions of authority. In one article written in 1937, entitled "Not Wanted—I", she discussed how it was especially difficult for women to attain positions in line with their skills and training. A few months later, she published "Discrimination", in which she urged women to boycott institutions and establishments that did not treat them fairly. These articles drew criticism from some factions of society, which claimed Bailey was trying to start a [[Ethnic conflict|race war]]. Bailey countered that she was simply trying to bring the issue into the open and prompt laws to address disparity.{{sfn|Altink|2011|p=519}} Though the WLC conference had proposed a law end to racial discrimination be passed, that was one of the recommendations upon which the government refused to act.{{sfn|Altink|2011|p=520}}

Bailey and [[May Farquharson]] joined forces in 1937 and began working on other strategies to improve the lives of women. One of the issues they discussed was family planning, and another was an initiative called Save the Children Fund, which they founded in 1938. Joining forces with them were [[Mary Morris Knibb]], Dr. Jai Lal Varma, and Dr. Pengelley. With seed money given by May’s father Arthur Farquharson, Bailey travelled to London with [[Una Marson]]{{sfn|Hemming|1976}}{{sfn|Grinam|8 February 1990|p=16}} to raise funds for providing food, clothing and textbooks to Jamaican school children.{{sfn|Rose|3/1978}} The fund drive was a resounding success and the organization is still thriving.{{sfn|Hemming|1976}} While in England, Bailey became the first Jamaican to testify to the [[Report of West India Royal Commission (Moyne Report)#Royal Commission|Royal Commission]] headed by [[Walter Guinness, 1st Baron Moyne]] about labour unrest, the burgeoning trade union movement, as well as the political unrest plaguing Jamaica at that time.{{sfn|Smith|1988|p=11}} She also met with proponents of family planning, and when she returned to Jamaica a birth control drive was launched{{sfn|Hemming|1976}} in 1939 with a seminar held at the Ward Theater.{{sfn|Smith|1988|p=11}}

Leading up to the meeting, Dr. Varma, an Indian-born doctor who was residing in Jamaica, and several other prominent figures published their views on the matter in ''The Gleaner''. Varma and Dr. William Edward Mcculloch were the only physicians willing to publish their views in favour of controlling the birth rate. Their view was that the extremely high birth rate in Jamaica was a hindrance to economic progress. The doctor's views were refuted by the churches, which though concerned about illegitimacy, felt that birth control was a family matter.{{sfn|Bourbonnais|2009|p=40}} Bailey, saw the issue as one that addressed gender and racial inequalities. She organized, with the help of Farquharson and Judith Decordova, a charity worker, a three-month lecture tour throughout Jamaica by [[Edith How-Martyn]], a British feminist and birth control advocate.{{sfn|Bourbonnais|2009|p=40}} They established their first clinic in 1939 at 24 East Race Course,{{sfn|Grinam|15 February 1990}} and provided nursery care and parenting classes.{{sfn|Altink|2011|p=517}} The women successfully continued the programme, despite the various organizations that disapproved, until the government finally took over Family Planning.{{sfn|Grinam|15 February 1990}}

Another initiative launched in 1938 occurred when Bailey met with Governor [[Edward Brandis Denham]] to express her concern about the limited opportunities available to black youths. She expressed the frustration of her students who had graduated with technical skills but were barred from working in civil service jobs. Believing that her outspokenness would result in reprimand, she was surprised when a committee was set up{{sfn|Grinam|8 February 1990|p=16}} within two weeks of the governor's visit with her to investigate the situation.{{sfn|Smith|1988|p=11}} Meeting between 1938 and 1939, the committee recommended that civil service exams be opened to all graduates of the Technical High School. Beginning in 1939, banking and business employment became open to the students.{{sfn|Grinam|8 February 1990|p=16}}

In 1944, the adviser to the Comptroller for Colonial Development and Welfare for the West Indies publicly criticized Jamaican women for their lack of contribution to their nation. Bailey took the words as a call to action and founded the Homecraft Training Centre{{sfn|Davidson|Wynter|1988|p=3}} as a way to build their dignity and self-respect while teaching them skills.{{sfn|''Sunday Gleaner Magazine''|1986|p=3}} In 1946 with her own funds, she made a down-payment on the property at 4 Rosedale Avenue in Kingston and began offering home economics courses.{{sfn|Davidson|Wynter|1988|p=3}} The centre offered training in catering, cooking, domestic skills, and sewing, as well as [[English language]] and arithmetic to girls. She headed the centre until 1978, when she retired.{{sfn|Rose|8/1978}} 

Bailey died on 3 October 1990 at Nuttall Memorial Hospital in Kingston, Jamaica.{{sfn|''Jamaica Record''|10/1990|pp=1a, 9a}}

==Legacy==
Throughout her lifetime, Bailey received many awards and honours. In 1978, she was awarded the Jamaican [[Order of Distinction]] for her public service.{{sfn|Rose|8/1978}} In January 1988, she was awarded the Marcus Garvey Award for Excellence for her dedication to the development of social programs of Jamaica.{{sfn|Smith|1988|p=11}} In 1990, a documentary on the lives of Bailey and Farquharson, their remarkable friendship, and their work for women's political and economic equality was produced by Sistren Research.{{sfn|''The Star''|1990|p=8}} On [[International Women's Day]], 8 March 1990, Bailey and Farquharson, were awarded the [[Order of Jamaica]] for their contributions to women's rights. A ceremony bestowing the order was held on 5 June 1990.{{sfn|''Jamaica Record''|6/1990|p=2}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10771">The '''anti-lynching movement''' was a [[civil rights movement]] in the [[United States]] that aimed to eradicate the practice of [[Lynching in the United States|lynching]].

The first anti-lynching movement was characterized by black convention meets, which were organized in the immediate aftermath of individual incidents. The movement gained wider national support in the 1890s. During this period, two organizations spearheaded the movement - the [[National Afro-American League|Afro-American League]] (AAL) and the National Equal Rights Council (NERC).&lt;ref name="Finkelman2007"/&gt;

On January 4, 1935, Democratic Senators  [[Edward P. Costigan]] and Robert F. Wagner together worked and set out a new bill that stated “To assure to persons within the jurisdiction of every state the equal protection of the crime of lynching.” The bill was composed with many sections that protected people from all types of lynching crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walter|first=David O.|date=June–July 1935|title="Previous Attempts to Pass a Federal Anti-Lynching Law."|url=http://0-eds.b.ebscohost.com.library.4cd.edu/ehost/detail/detail?vid=57&amp;sid=00f2f6ba-b7ec-4aaf-8489-3393686a6a93%40sessionmgr102&amp;hid=103&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=12142810&amp;db=aph|journal=Congressional Digest|volume= 14| issue =  6/7|pages=169–171|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) ==
In 1909, the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) was established. The NAACP formed a special committee in 1916 in order to push for anti-lynching legislation and to enlighten the public about lynching.&lt;ref name="Finkelman2007" /&gt;

The NAACP youth were part of many rallies. They attended many protest against lynching and wore black in memory of all who had been murdered. They also sold anti-lynching buttons to raise money for the NAACP. The money they raised was to keep the fight against lynching going. They sold a huge amount of buttons that said "Stop Lynching" and made about $869.25. The youth also contributed by having demonstrations to raise awareness about the horrors of lynching. They had these demonstrations in seventy eight different cities all over the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=NAACP Youth and the Fight for Black Freedom, 1936–1965|last=Bynum|first=Thomas|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|year=2013|isbn=1-57233-982-9|location=|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Noralee Frankel, the anti-lynching movement had its origin in the freedom movements after the end of the [[American Civil War]], and that it cannot be described only as a result of the [[Progressive Era#Political reform|reforms]] during the [[Progressive Era]].&lt;ref name="Frankel1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Noralee Frankel|title=Gender, Class, Race, and Reform in the Progressive Era|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=btZ7N4qAJhYC&amp;pg=PA148|accessdate=12 April 2012|date=22 December 1994|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=978-0-8131-0841-4|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Women's Contributions ==
Many women contributed to the anti-lynching movement through the [[Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill|Dyer Bill]] including Ida B. Wells, Mary Burnett Talbert and Angelina Grimké. The bill was a foundation that exposed both lynching, and the affects it had on the people.

=== Ida B. Wells ===
[[Ida B. Wells]] was a significant figure in the anti-lynching movement. After the lynchings of her three friends, she condemned the lynchings in the newspapers ''Free Speech'' and ''Headlight'', both owned by her. Wells wrote to reveal the abuse, and race violence African Americans had to go through. She was part of many civil rights organizations such as the NAACP, the Niagara Movement and the Afro-American Council.&lt;ref name="Finkelman20072"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6gbQHxb_P0QC&amp;pg=PA80|title=Encyclopedia of African American History, 1896 to the Present: From the Age of Segregation to the Twenty-First Century|date=November 2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-516779-5|pages=78–82|author=Paul Finkelman|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wells encourage black women to help work for the Anti-lynching laws to be passed. She was also part of the “First Suffrage Club for Black Women."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/odyssey/educate/barnett.html|title=Woman Journalist Crusades Against Lynching|last=|first=|date=December 10, 1998|website=Library of Congress|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ida B. Wells asked ''“Is Rape the ‘Cause’ of Lynching?”'' in their circular titled “The Shame of America,” that emphasized the Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill, when they were in the Anti-Lynching Campaigns. Due to the number of 83 women being lynched in a time frame of 30 years plus 3,353 men that were also lynched.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Because of her anti-lynching campaigning she received death threats from racist rioters.&lt;ref name="Finkelman2007" /&gt; After having her children she got out of the organizations but she kept on protesting against lynching. In 1899 she protested the [[Sam Hose|Sam Hose's lynching]] in Georgia.

=== Mary Burnett Talbert ===
Mary B. Talbert was president of the National Association of Colored Women from 1916 to 1920. In 1923 she became vise president of the NAACP and her last contribution was leading the Anti- lynching Crusaders during the anti lynching movement .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Strangers in the Land of Paradise: Creation of an African American Community, Buffalo New York|last=Williams|first=Lillian|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1999|isbn=978-0253335524|location=Blooming IN|pages=241}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922 Talbert and all the Negro women part of the anti-lynching crusaders raise $10,000 for the NAACP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women and Patriotism in Jim Crow America|last=Morgan|first=Francesca|publisher=|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anxiety''' is an [[emotion]] characterized by an unpleasant state of inner turmoil, often accompanied by nervous behaviour such as pacing back and forth, [[Somatic anxiety| somatic complaints]], and [[Rumination (psychology)| rumination]].&lt;ref name="Seligman"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Seligman ME, Walker EF, Rosenhan DL |author3-link= David Rosenhan |author1-link= Martin Seligman  |title= Abnormal psychology |edition= 4th |location= New York |publisher= W.W.

People can also face [[mathematical anxiety]], [[somatic anxiety]], [[stage fright]], or [[test anxiety]]. [[Social anxiety]] and [[stranger anxiety]] are caused when people are apprehensive around strangers or other people in general. Furthermore, anxiety has been linked{{by whom?|date=November 2018}} with physical symptoms such as [[Irritable bowel syndrome|IBS]] and can heighten other mental-health illnesses such as [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder|OCD]] and [[panic disorder]].

Anxiety can be either a short-term "state" or a long-term "[[Trait theory|trait]]".

They often occur with other mental disorders, particularly [[bipolar disorder]], [[eating disorder]]s, [[major depressive disorder]], or certain [[personality disorder]]s. Common treatment options include [[Lifestyle (sociology) | lifestyle]] changes, medication, and [[psychotherapy|therapy]]. [[Metacognitive therapy]] seeks to diminish anxiety through reducing worry, which is seen{{by whom?|date=November 2018}} as a consequence of metacognitive beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;

Anxiety is distinguished from [[fear]], which is an appropriate cognitive and emotional response to a perceived threat.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andreas Dorschel]], ''Furcht und Angst.'' In: Dietmar Goltschnigg (ed.), ''Angst. Lähmender Stillstand und Motor des Fortschritts.'' Stauffenburg, Tübingen 2012, pp. 49-54&lt;/ref&gt; Anxiety is related to the specific behaviors of [[fight-or-flight response]]s, defensive behavior or escape. It occurs in situations only perceived as uncontrollable or unavoidable, but not realistically so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Öhman |first=Arne | name-list-format = vanc |year=2000 |chapter=Fear and anxiety: Evolutionary, cognitive, and clinical perspectives |editor1-first=Michael |editor1-last=Lewis |editor2-first=Jeannette M. |editor2-last=Haviland-Jones |title=Handbook of emotions |pages=573–93 |location=New York |publisher=The Guilford Press |isbn=978-1-57230-529-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Barlow defines anxiety as "a future-oriented mood state in which one is not ready or prepared to attempt to [[Coping (psychology)|cope]] with upcoming negative events,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barlow DH | title = Unraveling the mysteries of anxiety and its disorders from the perspective of emotion theory | journal = The American Psychologist | volume = 55 | issue = 11 | pages = 1247–63 | date = November 2000 | pmid = 11280938 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.55.11.1247 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that it is a distinction between future and present dangers which divides anxiety and fear.

Fear and anxiety can be differentiated in four domains: (1) duration of emotional experience, (2) temporal focus, (3) specificity of the threat, and (4) motivated direction. Fear is short lived, present focused, geared towards a specific threat, and facilitating escape from threat; anxiety, on the other hand, is long-acting, future focused, broadly focused towards a diffuse threat, and promoting excessive caution while approaching a potential threat and interferes with constructive coping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sylvers P, Lilienfeld SO, LaPrairie JL | title = Differences between trait fear and trait anxiety: implications for psychopathology | journal = Clinical Psychology Review | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 122–37 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 20817337 | doi = 10.1016/j.cpr.2010.08.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symptoms ==
Anxiety can be experienced with long, drawn out daily symptoms that reduce quality of life, known as chronic (or generalized) anxiety, or it can be experienced in short spurts with sporadic, stressful [[panic attack]]s, known as acute anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rynn MA, Brawman-Mintzer O | title = Generalized anxiety disorder: acute and chronic treatment | journal = CNS Spectrums | volume = 9 | issue = 10 | pages = 716–23 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15448583 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Symptoms of anxiety can range in number, intensity, and frequency, depending on the person. While almost everyone has experienced anxiety at some point in their lives, most do not develop long-term problems with anxiety.

Anxiety may cause psychiatric and physiological symptoms.&lt;ref name=WHO2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=TestaGiannuzzi2013partI /&gt;

The risk of anxiety leading to depression could possibly even lead to an individual harming themselves, which is why there are many 24-hour suicide prevention hotlines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.psychguides.com/guides/depression-hotline/|title=Depression Hotline {{!}} Call Our Free, 24 Hour Depression Helpline|work=PsychGuides.com|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The behavioral effects of anxiety may include withdrawal from situations which have provoked anxiety or negative feelings in the past.&lt;ref name="Barker, P. 2003"/&gt; Other effects may include changes in sleeping patterns, changes in habits, increase or decrease in food intake, and increased motor tension (such as foot tapping).&lt;ref name="Barker, P. 2003"/&gt;

The emotional effects of anxiety may include "feelings of apprehension or dread, trouble concentrating, feeling tense or jumpy, anticipating the worst, irritability, restlessness, watching (and waiting) for signs (and occurrences) of danger, and, feeling like your mind's gone blank"&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Melinda (2008, June).

The cognitive effects of anxiety may include thoughts about suspected dangers, such as fear of dying.

===Existential===
{{Further|Angst|Existential crisis|Nihilism}}

The philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]], in ''[[The Concept of Anxiety]]'' (1844), described anxiety or dread associated with the "dizziness of freedom" and suggested the possibility for positive resolution of anxiety through the self-conscious exercise of responsibility and choosing. In ''Art and Artist'' (1932), the psychologist [[Otto Rank]] wrote that the [[psychological trauma]] of birth was the pre-eminent human symbol of existential anxiety and encompasses the creative person's simultaneous fear of – and desire for – separation, individuation, and differentiation.

The [[theology|theologian]] [[Paul Tillich]] characterized existential anxiety&lt;ref name="Tillich"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Paul Tillich |last=Tillich |first=Paul | name-list-format = vanc |year=1952 |title=The Courage To Be |location=New Haven |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-08471-9|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; as "the state in which a [[being]] is aware of its possible nonbeing" and he listed three categories for the nonbeing and resulting anxiety: ontic (fate and death), [[Morality|moral]] ([[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] and condemnation), and [[Spirituality|spiritual]] (emptiness and [[Meaning (existential)|meaninglessness]]). According to Tillich, the last of these three types of existential anxiety, i.e. spiritual anxiety, is predominant in modern times while the others were predominant in earlier periods. Tillich argues that this anxiety can be [[Acceptance#Self acceptance|accepted]] as part of the [[human condition]] or it can be resisted but with negative consequences. In its pathological form, spiritual anxiety may tend to "drive the person toward the creation of certitude in systems of meaning which are supported by [[tradition]] and [[authority]]" even though such "undoubted certitude is not built on the rock of [[reality]]".&lt;ref name=Tillich /&gt;

According to [[Viktor Frankl]], the author of ''[[Man's Search for Meaning]]'', when a person is faced with extreme mortal dangers, the most basic of all human wishes is to find a [[meaning of life]] to combat the "trauma of nonbeing" as death is near.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abulof|first1=Uriel | name-list-format = vanc |title=The Mortality and Morality of Nations|date=2015|location=New York|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-09707-0|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Test and performance===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Educational psychology]] --&gt;
{{Main|Test anxiety|Mathematical anxiety|Stage fright|Somatic anxiety}}
According to [[Yerkes-Dodson law]], an optimal level of arousal is necessary to best complete a task such as an exam, performance, or competitive event. However, when the anxiety or level of arousal exceeds that optimum, the result is a decline in performance.&lt;ref name="Teigen"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0959354394044004 |title=Yerkes-Dodson: A Law for all Seasons |journal=Theory &amp; Psychology |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=525–547 |year=1994 |last1=Teigen |first1=Karl Halvor | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Test anxiety is the uneasiness, apprehension, or nervousness felt by students who have a fear of failing an [[Test (student assessment)|exam]]. Students who have test anxiety may experience any of the following: the association of [[Grade (education)|grades]] with [[Self-esteem|personal worth]]; fear of embarrassment by a teacher; fear of [[Social alienation|alienation]] from parents or friends; time pressures; or feeling a loss of control. Sweating, dizziness, headaches, racing heartbeats, nausea, fidgeting, uncontrollable crying or laughing and drumming on a desk are all common. Because test anxiety hinges on [[fear of negative evaluation]],&lt;ref name="Liebert"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liebert RM, Morris LW | title = Cognitive and emotional components of test anxiety: a distinction and some initial data | journal = Psychological Reports | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | pages = 975–8 | date = June 1967 | pmid = 6042522 | doi = 10.2466/pr0.1967.20.3.975 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; debate exists as to whether test anxiety is itself a unique anxiety disorder or whether it is a specific type of social [[phobia]].&lt;ref name="Beidel"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Beidel DC, Turner SM | title = Comorbidity of test anxiety and other anxiety disorders in children | journal = Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 275–87 | date = June 1988 | pmid = 3403811 | doi = 10.1007/BF00913800 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The DSM-IV classifies test anxiety as a type of social phobia.&lt;ref name="Rapee"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rapee RM, Heimberg RG | title = A cognitive-behavioral model of anxiety in social phobia | journal = Behaviour Research and Therapy | volume = 35 | issue = 8 | pages = 741–56 | date = August 1997 | pmid = 9256517 | doi = 10.1016/S0005-7967(97)00022-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the term "test anxiety" refers specifically to students,&lt;ref name="Mathur"&gt;{{cite journal |citeseerx=10.1.1.1027.7497 |url=http://medind.nic.in/daa/t11/i2/daat11i2p337.pdf |title=Impact of Hypnotherapy on Examination Anxiety and Scholastic Performance among School |journal=Delhi Psychiatry Journal |year=2011 |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=337–42 |first1=Shachi |last1=Mathur |first2=Waheeda |last2=Khan | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; many workers share the same experience with regard to their career or profession. The fear of failing at a task and being negatively evaluated for failure can have a similarly negative effect on the adult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hall-Flavin|first1=Daniel K.| name-list-format = vanc |title=Is it possible to overcome test anxiety?|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/generalized-anxiety-disorder/expert-answers/test-anxiety/faq-20058195|website=Mayo Clinic|publisher=Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research|access-date=11 August 2015|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905063635/http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/generalized-anxiety-disorder/expert-answers/test-anxiety/faq-20058195|archive-date=September 5, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Management of test anxiety focuses on achieving relaxation and developing mechanisms to manage anxiety.&lt;ref name="Mathur"/&gt;

===Stranger, social, and intergroup anxiety===
{{Main|Stranger anxiety|Social anxiety}}

Humans generally require social acceptance and thus sometimes dread the disapproval of others. Apprehension of being judged by others may cause anxiety in social environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |doi=10.1016/B978-0-12-375096-9.00028-6 |chapter=Introduction: Toward an Understanding of Social Anxiety Disorder |title=Social Anxiety |pages=xix–xxvi |year=2010 |last1=Hofmann |first1=Stefan G. |last2=Dibartolo |first2=Patricia M. | name-list-format = vanc |isbn=978-0-12-375096-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anxiety during social interactions, particularly between strangers, is common among young people. It may persist into adulthood and become social anxiety or social phobia. "[[Stranger anxiety]]" in small children is not considered a phobia. In adults, an excessive fear of other people is not a developmentally common stage; it is called [[social anxiety]]. According to Cutting,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Ben |editor1-last=Thomas |editor2-first=Sally |editor2-last=Hardy |editor3-first=Penny |editor3-last=Cutting | name-list-format = vanc |year=1997 |title=Mental Health Nursing: Principles and Practice |publisher=Mosby |location=London |isbn=978-0-7234-2590-8}}{{Page needed|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; social phobics do not fear the crowd but the fact that they may be judged negatively.

[[Social anxiety]] varies in degree and severity. For some people, it is characterized by experiencing discomfort or awkwardness during physical social contact (e.g. embracing, shaking hands, etc.), while in other cases it can lead to a fear of interacting with unfamiliar people altogether. Those suffering from this condition may restrict their lifestyles to accommodate the anxiety, minimizing social interaction whenever possible. Social anxiety also forms a core aspect of certain personality disorders, including [[Avoidant Personality Disorder|avoidant personality disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Settipani CA, Kendall PC | title = Social functioning in youth with anxiety disorders: association with anxiety severity and outcomes from cognitive-behavioral therapy | journal = Child Psychiatry and Human Development | volume = 44 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–18 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 22581270 | doi = 10.1007/s10578-012-0307-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To the extent that a person is fearful of social encounters with unfamiliar others, some people may experience anxiety particularly during interactions with outgroup members, or people who share different group memberships (i.e., by race, ethnicity, class, gender, etc.). Depending on the nature of the antecedent relations, cognitions, and situational factors, intergroup contact may be stressful and lead to feelings of anxiety. This apprehension or fear of contact with outgroup members is often called interracial or intergroup anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1985.tb01134.x |title=Intergroup Anxiety |journal=Journal of Social Issues |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=157–175 |year=1985 |last1=Stephan |first1=Walter G. |last2=Stephan |first2=Cookie White | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As is the case the more generalized forms of [[social anxiety]], intergroup anxiety has behavioral, cognitive, and affective effects. For instance, increases in schematic processing and simplified information processing can occur when anxiety is high. Indeed, such is consistent with related work on attentional bias in implicit memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Richeson JA, Trawalter S | title = The threat of appearing prejudiced and race-based attentional biases | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 19 | issue = 2 | pages = 98–102 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18271854 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02052.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mathews A, Mogg K, May J, Eysenck M | title = Implicit and explicit memory bias in anxiety | journal = Journal of Abnormal Psychology | volume = 98 | issue = 3 | pages = 236–40 | date = August 1989 | pmid = 2768658 | doi = 10.1037/0021-843x.98.3.236 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0191-8869(91)90096-t |title=Effects of encoding and anxiety on implicit and explicit memory performance |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=131–139 |year=1991 |last1=Richards |first1=Anne |last2=French |first2=Christopher C. | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally recent research has found that implicit racial evaluations (i.e. automatic prejudiced attitudes) can be amplified during intergroup interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Amodio DM, Hamilton HK | title = Intergroup anxiety effects on implicit racial evaluation and stereotyping | journal = Emotion | volume = 12 | issue = 6 | pages = 1273–80 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 22775128 | doi = 10.1037/a0029016 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.659.5717 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Negative experiences have been illustrated in producing not only negative expectations, but also avoidant, or  antagonistic, behavior such as hostility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Plant EA, Devine PG | title = The antecedents and implications of interracial anxiety | journal = Personality &amp; Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 29 | issue = 6 | pages = 790–801 | date = June 2003 | pmid = 15189634 | doi = 10.1177/0146167203029006011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, when compared to anxiety levels and cognitive effort (e.g., impression management and self-presentation) in intragroup contexts, levels and depletion of resources may be exacerbated in the intergroup situation.

===Trait===
Anxiety can be either a short-term 'state' or a long-term personality "trait". Trait anxiety reflects a stable tendency across the lifespan of responding with acute, state anxiety in the anticipation of threatening situations (whether they are actually deemed threatening or not).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.macses.ucsf.edu/Research/Psychosocial/notebook/anxiety.html |title=Anxiety | vauthors = Schwarzer R  |date=December 1997 |access-date=2008-01-12 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070920115547/http://www.macses.ucsf.edu/Research/Psychosocial/notebook/anxiety.html |archive-date=September 20, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; A meta-analysis showed that a high level of [[neuroticism]] is a risk factor for development of anxiety symptoms and disorders.&lt;ref name="NeuroticismMA"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jeronimus BF, Kotov R, Riese H, Ormel J | title = Neuroticism's prospective association with mental disorders halves after adjustment for baseline symptoms and psychiatric history, but the adjusted association hardly decays with time: a meta-analysis on 59 longitudinal/prospective studies with 443 313 participants | journal = Psychological Medicine | volume = 46 | issue = 14 | pages = 2883–2906 | date = October 2016 | pmid = 27523506 | doi = 10.1017/S0033291716001653 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such anxiety may be conscious or unconscious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Giddey M, Wright H |title=Mental Health Nursing: From first principles to professional practice |publisher=Stanley Thornes}}{{Page needed|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Personality can also be a trait leading towards anxiety and depression. Through experience many find it difficult to collect themselves due to their own personal nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gulfbend.org/poc/view_doc.php?type=doc&amp;id=8948|title=Gulf Bend MHMR Center|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Choice or decision ===
Anxiety induced by the need to choose between similar options is increasingly being recognized as a problem for individuals and for organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/style/fashion/trends/article85734.ece |work=The Times |location=London |title=Premium choice anxiety |date=April 27, 2008 |access-date=2010-04-25 |first1=Jonathan |last1=Downey | name-list-format = vanc |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203132027/http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/style/fashion/trends/article85734.ece |archive-date=February 3, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, [[Capgemini]] wrote: "Today we're all faced with greater choice, more competition and less time to consider our options or seek out the right advice."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.uk.capgemini.com/news/pr1487 Is choice anxiety costing british 'blue chip' business?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222143245/https://www.uk.capgemini.com/news/pr1487 |date=December 22, 2015 }}, [[Capgemini]], Aug 16, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In a decision context, unpredictability or uncertainty may trigger emotional responses in anxious individuals that systematically alter decision-making.&lt;ref name="Hartley"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hartley CA, Phelps EA | title = Anxiety and decision-making | journal = Biological Psychiatry | volume = 72 | issue = 2 | pages = 113–8 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22325982 | pmc = 3864559 | doi = 10.1016/j.biopsych.2011.12.027 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are primarily two forms of this anxiety type. The first form refers to a choice in which there are multiple potential outcomes with known or calculable probabilities. The second form refers to the uncertainty and ambiguity related to a decision context in which there are multiple possible outcomes with unknown probabilities.&lt;ref name="Hartley"/&gt;

===Anxiety disorders===
{{Main|Anxiety disorder}}
&lt;!-- Do not add new content here.  Add to body of Anxiety disorder article, and only if it rises to the importance of the lead there, update the lead there, then update this. Per [[WP:SYNC]] --&gt;

===Neuroanatomy===
Neural circuitry involving the [[amygdala]] (which regulates emotions like anxiety and fear, stimulating the [[Hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis|HPA Axis]] and [[sympathetic nervous system]]) and [[hippocampus]] (which is implicated in emotional memory along with the amygdala) is thought to underlie anxiety.&lt;ref name="Rosen"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rosen JB, Schulkin J | title = From normal fear to pathological anxiety | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 105 | issue = 2 | pages = 325–50 | date = April 1998 | pmid = 9577241 | doi = 10.1037/0033-295X.105.2.325 }}&lt;/ref&gt; People who have anxiety tend to show high activity in response to emotional stimuli in the amygdala.&lt;ref&gt;Nolen-Hoeksema, S. (2013). (Ab)normal Psychology (6th edition). McGraw Hill.{{page needed|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some writers believe that excessive anxiety can lead to an overpotentiation of the limbic system (which includes the amygdala and nucleus accumbens), giving increased future anxiety, but this does not appear to have been proven.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book |title=Compassion and Healing in Medicine and Society: On the Nature and Use of Attachment Solutions to Separation Challenges | vauthors =Fricchione G |date=2011 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=978-1-4214-0220-8 |page=172 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book |title=How the Brain Talks to Itself: A Clinical Primer of Psychotherapeutic Neuroscience | vauthors = Harris J |date=1998 |publisher=Haworth |isbn=978-0-7890-0408-6 |page=284 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research upon adolescents who as infants had been highly apprehensive, vigilant, and fearful finds that their [[nucleus accumbens]] is more sensitive than that in other people when deciding to make an action that determined whether they received a reward.&lt;ref name="Bar-Haim"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bar-Haim Y, Fox NA, Benson B, Guyer AE, Williams A, Nelson EE, Perez-Edgar K, Pine DS, Ernst M | display-authors = 6 | title = Neural correlates of reward processing in adolescents with a history of inhibited temperament | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 20 | issue = 8 | pages = 1009–18 | date = August 2009 | pmid = 19594857 | pmc = 2785902 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02401.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests a link between circuits responsible for fear and also reward in anxious people. As researchers note, "a sense of 'responsibility', or self-agency, in a context of uncertainty (probabilistic outcomes) drives the neural system underlying appetitive motivation (i.e., nucleus accumbens) more strongly in temperamentally inhibited than noninhibited adolescents".&lt;ref name="Bar-Haim" /&gt;

===Substance-induced===
Several drugs can cause or worsen anxiety, whether in intoxication, withdrawal or from chronic use. These include [[alcohol]], [[tobacco]], [[cannabis]], [[sedative]]s (including prescription [[benzodiazepine]]s), [[opioid]]s (including prescription pain killers and illicit drugs like heroin), [[stimulant]]s (such as [[caffeine]], [[cocaine]] and amphetamines), [[hallucinogen]]s, and [[inhalants]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While many often report self-medicating anxiety with these substances, improvements in anxiety from drugs are usually short-lived (with worsening of anxiety in the long term, sometimes with acute anxiety as soon as the drug effects wear off) and tend to be exaggerated. Acute exposure to toxic levels of [[benzene]] may cause euphoria, anxiety, and irritability lasting up to 2 weeks after the exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CDC - The Emergency Response Safety and Health Database: Systemic Agent: BENZENE - NIOSH|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ershdb/emergencyresponsecard_29750032.html|website = www.cdc.gov|access-date = 2016-01-27|deadurl = no|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160117001341/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ershdb/emergencyresponsecard_29750032.html|archive-date = January 17, 2016|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychological===
Poor [[Coping (psychology)|coping skills]] (e.g., rigidity/inflexible problem solving, denial, avoidance, impulsivity, extreme self-expectation, negative thoughts, affective instability, and inability to focus on problems) are associated with anxiety. Anxiety is also linked and perpetuated by the person's own pessimistic outcome expectancy and how they cope with feedback negativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gu R, Huang YX, Luo YJ | title = Anxiety and feedback negativity | journal = Psychophysiology | volume = 47 | issue = 5 | pages = 961–7 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20374540 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-8986.2010.00997.x }}{{primary source inline|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temperament (e.g., [[neuroticism]])&lt;ref name="NeuroticismMA"/&gt; and attitudes (e.g. pessimism) have been found to be risk factors for anxiety.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bienvenu Ginsburg 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bienvenu OJ, Ginsburg GS | title = Prevention of anxiety disorders | journal = International Review of Psychiatry | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 647–54 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 18092242 | doi = 10.1080/09540260701797837 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cognitive distortion]]s such as overgeneralizing, catastrophizing, mind reading, emotional reasoning, binocular trick, and mental filter can result in anxiety. For example, an overgeneralized belief that something bad "always" happens may lead someone to have excessive fears of even minimally risky situations and to avoid benign social situations due to anticipatory anxiety of embarrassment. In addition, those who have high anxiety can also create future stressful life events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Phillips AC, Carroll D, Der G | title = Negative life events and symptoms of depression and anxiety: stress causation and/or stress generation | journal = Anxiety, Stress, and Coping | volume = 28 | issue = 4 | pages = 357–71 | year = 2015 | pmid = 25572915 | pmc = 4772121 | doi = 10.1080/10615806.2015.1005078 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, these findings suggest that anxious thoughts can lead to anticipatory anxiety as well stressful events, which in turn cause more anxiety. Such unhealthy thoughts can be targets for successful treatment with [[cognitive therapy]].

[[Psychodynamics|Psychodynamic]] theory posits that anxiety is often the result of opposing [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] wishes or fears that manifest via maladaptive [[Defence mechanisms|defense mechanisms]] (such as suppression, repression, anticipation, regression, somatization, passive aggression, dissociation) that develop to [[Ego psychology|adapt]] to problems with early [[Object relations theory|objects]] (e.g., caregivers) and [[Self psychology|empathic failures]] in childhood. For example, persistent parental discouragement of anger may result in repression/suppression of angry feelings which manifests as gastrointestinal distress (somatization) when provoked by another while the anger remains unconscious and outside the individual's awareness. Such conflicts can be targets for successful treatment with [[Psychodynamic psychotherapy|psychodynamic therapy]]. While psychodynamic therapy tends to explore the underlying roots of anxiety, cognitive behavioral therapy has also been shown to be a successful treatment for anxiety by altering irrational thoughts and unwanted behaviors.

====Evolutionary psychology====
An [[evolutionary psychology]] explanation is that increased anxiety serves the purpose of increased [[vigilance (psychology)|vigilance]] regarding potential  threats in the environment as well as increased tendency to take proactive actions regarding such possible threats. This may cause [[false positive]] reactions but an individual suffering from anxiety may also avoid real threats. This may explain why anxious people are less likely to die due to accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Andrews PW, Thomson JA | title = The bright side of being blue: depression as an adaptation for analyzing complex problems | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 116 | issue = 3 | pages = 620–54 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19618990 | pmc = 2734449 | doi = 10.1037/a0016242 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When people are confronted with unpleasant and potentially harmful stimuli such as foul odors or tastes, [[Positron emission tomography|PET-scans]] show increased bloodflow in the [[amygdala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zald DH, Pardo JV | title = Emotion, olfaction, and the human amygdala: amygdala activation during aversive olfactory stimulation | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 94 | issue = 8 | pages = 4119–24 | date = April 1997 | pmid = 9108115 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.94.8.4119 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zald DH, Hagen MC, Pardo JV | title = Neural correlates of tasting concentrated quinine and sugar solutions | journal = Journal of Neurophysiology | volume = 87 | issue = 2 | pages = 1068–75 | date = February 2002 | pmid = 11826070 | doi = 10.1152/jn.00358.2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these studies, the participants also reported moderate anxiety. This might indicate that anxiety is a protective mechanism designed to prevent the organism from engaging in potentially harmful behaviors.

===Social===
Social risk factors for anxiety include a history of trauma (e.g., physical, sexual or emotional abuse or assault), early life experiences and parenting factors (e.g., rejection, lack of warmth, high hostility, harsh discipline, high parental [[Negative affectivity|negative affect]], anxious childrearing, modelling of dysfunctional and drug-abusing behaviour, discouragement of emotions, poor socialization, poor attachment, and child abuse and neglect), cultural factors (e.g., stoic families/cultures, persecuted minorities including the disabled), and socioeconomics (e.g., uneducated, unemployed, impoverished (although developed countries have higher rates of anxiety disorders than developing countries).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12480&amp;page=530 |chapter=Table E-4 Risk Factors for Anxiety |page=530 |editor1-first=Mary Ellen |editor1-last=O'Connell |editor2-first=Thomas |editor2-last=Boat |editor3-first=Kenneth E. |editor3-last=Warner | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=National Academies Press |title=Prevention of Mental Disorders, Substance Abuse, and Problem Behaviors: A Developmental Perspective |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-309-12674-8 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gender socialization====
Contextual factors that are thought to contribute to anxiety include gender socialization and learning experiences. In particular, learning mastery (the degree to which people perceive their lives to be under their own control) and instrumentality, which includes such traits as self-confidence, independence, and competitiveness fully mediate the relation between gender and anxiety. That is, though gender differences in anxiety exist, with higher levels of anxiety in women compared to men, gender socialization and learning mastery explain these gender differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/03634520009379205 |title=Anticipatory anxiety patterns for male and female public speakers |journal=Communication Education |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=187–195 |year=2000 |last1=Behnke |first1=Ralph R. |last2=Sawyer |first2=Chris R. | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{mcn|date=June 2015}} Research has demonstrated the ways in which facial prominence in photographic images differs between men and women. More specifically, in official online photographs of politicians around the world, women's faces are less prominent than men's. The difference in these images actually tended to be greater in cultures with greater institutional gender equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0361684312450004 |title=Understanding Gender Differences in Anxiety |journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=488–499 |year=2012 |last1=Zalta |first1=Alyson K. |last2=Chambless |first2=Dianne L. | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}
Anxiety disorder appears to be a genetically inherited neurochemical dysfunction that may involve autonomic imbalance; decreased GABA-ergic tone; allelic polymorphism of the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene; increased adenosine receptor function; increased cortisol.

In the [[central nervous system]] (CNS), the major mediators of the symptoms of anxiety disorders appear to be norepinephrine, serotonin, dopamine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Other neurotransmitters and peptides, such as corticotropin-releasing factor, may be involved. Peripherally, the [[autonomic nervous system]], especially the sympathetic nervous system, mediates many of the symptoms. Increased flow in the right parahippocampal region and reduced serotonin type 1A receptor binding in the anterior and posterior cingulate and raphe of patients are the diagnostic factors for prevalence of anxiety disorder.

The amygdala is central to the processing of fear and anxiety, and its function may be disrupted in anxiety disorders. Anxiety processing in the basolateral amygdala has been implicated with dendritic arborization of the amygdaloid neurons. SK2  potassium channels mediate inhibitory influence on action potentials and reduce arborization.

[[Joseph E. LeDoux]] and [[Lisa Feldman Barrett]] have both sought to separate automatic threat responses from additional associated cognitive activity within anxiety.

Craig (Ed.) |title=Jain Philosophy |journal=Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Routledge |location=London |year=1998 |url=http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/F005SECT1 |accessdate=2008-03-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060722002023/http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/F005SECT1 |archivedate=22 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Out that the seven, the four—influx (''āsrava''), bondage (''bandha''), stoppage (''[[samvara|saṃvara]]'')  and release (''[[nirjara|nirjarā]]'')—pertain to the karmic process.&lt;ref name=soni/&gt;

== Overview ==
The ''āsrava'', that is, the influx of karmic occurs when the karmic particles are attracted to the soul on account of vibrations created by activities of mind, speech and body.{{sfn|George|2008|p=328}}&lt;ref name=Jaini112&gt;{{cite book | last =Jaini | first =Padmanabh | title =The Jaina Path of Purification | publisher =Motilal Banarsidass | year =1998 | location =New Delhi | isbn =81-208-1578-5 }} p.112&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Jain text, [[Tattvartha sutra]], translates S.A. Jain: {{quote|''yoga'' (activity) i.e. the action of the body, the organ of speech and the mind is the reason for ''asrava''.|[[Tattvārthasūtra]] (6:1–2){{sfn|Jain|2011|p=80}}}} The karmic inflow on account of ''yoga'' driven by passions and emotions cause a long term inflow of ''karma'' prolonging the cycle of reincarnations. On the other hand, the karmic inflows on account of actions that are not driven by passions and emotions have only a transient, short-lived karmic effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Kuhn | first =Hermann | title =Karma, The Mechanism : Create Your Own Fate | publisher =Crosswind Publishing | year =2001 | location =Wunstorf, Germany | isbn =3-9806211-4-6 }} p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Tatia | first = Nathmal | title =Tattvārtha Sūtra: That Which Is of Vācaka Umāsvāti | publisher =Rowman Altamira | year =1994 | location =Lanham, MD | language =Sanskrit, English | isbn =0-7619-8993-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jains, ''āsrava'' refers to the influx of very fine matter particles. [[Champat Rai Jain]] in his book, ''The Key of Knowledge'' writes:&lt;ref name = "key"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jain|first1=Champat Rai|authorlink=Champat Rai Jain|title=The Key Of Knowledge|date=1975|publisher=Today and Tomorrow's Printers|location=New Delhi|edition=Third|url=https://archive.org/details/keyofknowledge|p=621}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|To begin with ''āsrava'', the first thing to grasp is that there can be no bondage of pure mental abstractions, or purely wordy concepts; the word signifies some kind of real fetters, not, indeed, consisting in chains of iron, but of some very subtle and fine kind of matter. It is well to know that nothing but force, in some form or other, is capable of exercising restraint or of holding living beings in the condition of captivity, and that no kind of force is conceivable apart from a substance of some kind or other. The bondage of soul must, therefore, be the bondage of matter, the only substance which is known to enter into interaction with souls, and the obtainment of freedom must consequently imply the removal of the particles of this foreign material from the constitution of the ego.|Champat Rai Jain}}

== Classification ==
There are two kinds of influx, namely:{{sfn|Jain|2011|p=81}}
#that of persons with passions, which extends transmigration, and
#that of persons free from passions, which prevents or shortens transmigration

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6593">'''Backtesting''' is a term used in modeling to refer to testing a [[predictive modelling|predictive model]] on historical data.  Backtesting is a type of [[retrodiction]], and a special type of [[Cross-validation (statistics)|cross-validation]] applied to previous time period(s).

== Financial analysis==
In a trading strategy, investment strategy, or risk modeling, backtesting seeks to estimate the performance of a strategy or model if it had been employed during a past period. This requires simulating past conditions with sufficient detail, making one limitation of backtesting the need for detailed historical data.  A second limitation is the inability to model strategies that would affect historic prices. Finally, backtesting, like other modeling, is limited by potential [[overfitting]]. That is, it is often possible to find a strategy that would have worked well in the past, but will not work well in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Does Backtesting Really Work?|url=http://www.backtestbroker.com/backtestingfaq.aspx|author=BacktestBroker}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these limitations, backtesting provides information not available when models and strategies are tested on synthetic data.

Backtesting has historically only been performed by large institutions and professional money managers due to the expense of obtaining and using detailed datasets. However, backtrading is increasingly used on a wider basis, and independent web-based backtesting platforms have emerged. Although the technique is widely used, it is prone to weaknesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Issues related to back testing|url=http://www.financialtrading.com/issues-related-to-back-testing/|author=FinancialTrading}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Basel Accords|Basel financial regulations]] require large financial institutions to backtest certain risk models.

Hindcasting usually refers to a [[computer simulation|numerical-model]] integration of a historical period where no observations have been [[data assimilation|assimilated]]. This distinguishes a hindcast run from a [[meteorological reanalysis|reanalysis]]. Oceanographic observations of [[salinity]] and [[temperature]] as well as observations of [[ocean surface wave|surface-wave parameters]] such as the [[significant wave height]] are much scarcer than meteorological observations, making hindcasting more common in oceanography than in meteorology. Also, since surface waves represent a forced system where the wind is the only generating force, [[wind wave model|wave hindcasting]] is often considered adequate for generating a reasonable representation of the wave [[climate]] with little need for a full reanalysis. Hydrologists use hindcasting for model stream flows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Guidance on Conducting  Streamflow Hindcasting in  CHPS|url= http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/water/RFC_support/HEFS_doc/Streamflow_Hindcasting_Guidance_V3.pdf|publisher= NOAA|accessdate= 22 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of hindcasting would be entering [[climate]] forcings (events that force change) into a [[climate model]]. If the hindcast showed reasonably-accurate climate response, the model would be considered successful.

The [[ECMWF re-analysis]] is an example of a combined atmospheric reanalysis coupled with a wave-model integration where no wave parameters were assimilated, making the wave part a hindcast run.

In 2003, Dake Chen and his colleagues “trained” a computer using the data of the surface temperature of the oceans from the last 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, D., Cane, M.A., Kaplan, A., Zebiak, S.E. &amp; Huang, D., "Predictability of El Niño Over the Past 148 Years", ''Nature'', Vol.428, No.6984, (15 April 2004), pp.733-736; Anderson, D., "Testing Time for El Niño", ''Nature'', Vol.428, No.6984, (15 April 2004), pp.709, 711.&lt;/ref&gt; Then, using data that had been collected on the surface temperature of the oceans for the period 1857 to 2003, they went through a hindcasting exercise and discovered that their simulation not only accurately predicted every [[El Niño]] event for the last 148 years, it also identified the (up to 2 years) looming foreshadow of every single one of those El Niño events.&lt;ref&gt;
Not only did hindcasting demonstrate that the computerized simulation models could predict the onset of El Niño climatic events from changes in the temperature of the ocean's surface temperature that occur up to two years earlier — meaning that there was now, potentially, at least 2 years' lead time — but the results also implied that El Niño events seemed to be the effects of some causal regularity; and, therefore, were not due to simple chance, or to some other "chaotic" event.

The '''Beacham Theatre''' is a [[Cinema (building)|cinema]] built in 1921 by [[Braxton Beacham]] Sr. in the city of [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], [[Florida]].  The current address of the theater is 46 North Orange Avenue, and it is located at the southwest corner of Orange Avenue and Washington Street.  The building's current lack of impressive [[architecture]] is offset by its significant [[cultural history]].&lt;ref name=Dezern1988&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1988-02-28/news/0020190106_1_tampa-theatre-beacham-theater-in-atlanta |title=Conflict Now Playing At Beacham Owner: Destroy It -- Activists: Save It |last1= Dezern |first1=Craig |date=February 28, 1988 |website=orlandosentinel.com |publisher=''The Orlando Sentinel'' |access-date=August 11, 2016 |quote=But when preservationists look, they see a landmark.

The Beacham soon may join the fallen theaters. Juarez, a developer and political consultant, has applied for permission to tear down the building at 46 N.

The Beacham was once part of the [[vaudeville]] circuit and hosted celebrity acts such as [[John Phillip Sousa]], the [[Ziegfeld Follies]] and [[W.C. Fields]], whose signature was once visible inside a dressing room.  In the eras of [[silent film]] and [[Classical Hollywood cinema#Classical Hollywood cinema In the Sound Era (late 1920s – 1960)|Classical Hollywood cinema]], the Beacham was operated as a [[movie theater]] that utilized then-current [[state-of-the-art]] [[Film|motion picture]] technology.

'''The Beacham''', as it is currently named, has since been used as a series of [[concert venue]]s and [[nightclub]]s thus saving it from [[demolition]].  The Beacham Theatre was once home to the late-night [[Underground culture|underground]] [[discotheque]] '''Aahz''' that is recognized internationally as a birthplace and critical component of the [[electronic dance music]] [[Clubbing (subculture)|movement]].

==History==

===Construction===

[[file:Orange_County_Florida_Jail_(gaol)_photo.jpg|thumb|165px|left|The former Orange County Jail on the site of the Beacham Theatre]]

The Beacham Theatre was constructed in 1921 by [[Braxton Beacham]] Sr., who had previously owned three other Orlando theaters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=With "News" Correspondents (Florida) |url=https://archive.org/stream/motionpicturenew23moti_7#page/3198/mode/2up |magazine=Motion Picture News|location=New York|publisher=Motion Picture News, Inc. |date=May–June 1921 |access-date=February 17, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and had served as [[Mayor of Orlando]] during 1907.&lt;ref name=OrlandoHPB /&gt;  In 1917 Beacham paid approximately $17,500–$20,000 for the property one block southwest of his stately residence on Jefferson Street after Orlando's citizens voted to pave the road to the [[cemetery]] instead of purchasing the old jail.&lt;ref name=ActTwo /&gt;  The property he purchased had formerly served as the [[gaol|jail]] for [[Orange County, Florida|Orange County]] since about 1873.&lt;ref name="AntequinoPorter2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stephanie Gaub Antequino|author2=Tana Mosier Porter|author3=Historical Society of Central Florida|title=Lost Orlando|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4xWDRXbzXsMC|year=2012|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=978-0-7385-9173-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With a $200,000 investment, the former jail building was torn down in 1919 and Beacham developed a series of connected building units along the west side of Orange Avenue between Washington Street and Oak Street (now Wall Street).  The new building was then known as "Beacham's Block" and is now known the Beacham Building.  The location of Beacham's theater was precisely where several [[Capital punishment|condemned]] prisoners were executed by [[hanging]].&lt;ref name="AntequinoPorter2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hinson"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Schaal Hinson|first=Sandra|date=February 1983|title=A mover behind shakers|url=|magazine=Orlando Magazine|location=Orlando|publisher=Orlando Magazine|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ives1953&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Beacham Has Come Long Way: Lillian Gish to Queen Esther|last=Ives|first=Sidney|date=December 23, 1953|work=The Orlando Evening Star|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Sweers1981&gt;{{cite news |url= |title= Curtain rises on new act for Beacham|last1=Sweers |first1=Katheryn |date=July 12, 1981 |website= |publisher=The Orlando Sentinel |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Andrews1996&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1996-01-28/news/9601250598_1_orlando-opera-opera-house-movie-houses |title= Early Entertainment Venues Evolved From Opera House To Movie Theaters|last1=Andrews|first1=Mark|date=January 28, 1996 |website=orlandosentinel.com |publisher=The Orlando Sentinel |access-date= August 21, 2016|quote=...the former site of the county jail where hangings once were conducted - and built the Beacham Theater...Air conditioning was installed in the '30s...It later was home to Laser World; then to Moulin Orange, a Las Vegas-style cabaret that lasted four months in 1983-84; and then to Valentyne's Celebrity Dinner Theatre, which opened in 1987.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Means1982&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Requiem for the Beacham Theatre|last=Means|first=Howard|date=October 17, 1982|work=The Orlando Sentinel|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rajtar2006 /&gt;  According to local [[folklore]], the Beacham Building is reportedly [[ghost|haunted]].&lt;ref name=Means1982 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2001-02-16/entertainment/0102150519_1_gavin-tour-downtown-orlando |title=A Jaunt Into Haunts |last1=  Wallace Dickinson  |first1= Joy |date=February 16, 2001 |website=orlandosentinel.com |publisher= ''The Orlando Sentinel'' |access-date= August 14, 2016|quote=Gavin's tour includes tales of a sensational murder across the street from the Angebilt in the vanished San Juan Hotel and of a secret tunnel connecting the Angebilt to the old Beacham Theater (now the Tabu night spot at 46 N.

[[Tunnels]] from the theater stage trap ran into the basements of two nearby hotels.  The tunnels had low ceilings and were sealed during new construction in the early 1980s.  The tunnels extended south into the [[San Juan Hotel]], where Mr. Beacham happened to have had an office,&lt;ref name="Bacon1977" /&gt; and then east under Orange Avenue into the [[Angebilt Hotel]].  Historians reason that the purpose of the tunnels may have been either for vaudeville performers to enter the theater from their hotels without being mobbed by crowds, or the tunnels could have been used for the storage and transportation of alcoholic beverages during prohibition as has been discovered at some of the other theaters in the Central Florida area.&lt;ref name="Rajtar2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steve Rajtar|title=A Guide to Historic Orlando|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3cZfqYU1B4cC&amp;pg=PA58|year=2006|publisher=The History Press|isbn=978-1-59629-198-0|pages=58–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2007-02-10/news/HISTORYTRAILS_1_historic-trails-boy-scout-florida|title=Take a walk into Florida's past  |last1=Shrieves |first1=Linda |date=February 10, 2007|website=orlandosentinel.com |publisher= ''The Orlando Sentinel''|access-date= August 5, 2016|quote=Behind the theater's backstage is a trap door to a tunnel that runs underneath Orange Avenue to the 11-story brick building that was once the grand Angebilt Hotel.

On December 9, 1921, Orlando's premier vaudeville and movie house opened by showing [[Norma Talmadge filmography|''The Wonderful Thing'']], starring [[Norma Talmadge]], a [[Pathé News]] [[newsreel]], and [[Buster Keaton]]'s ''[[The Boat (film)|The Boat]]''.&lt;ref name="ActTwo"&gt;Act Two: A Beacham History.  1985.

The senior Braxton Beacham died in 1924 after a long illness, and Roberta Holland Beacham died soon after in 1926.  Their [[Estate (law)|estate]] and [[real property]] were left to their [[child]]ren, Norma K. Hughes, Roberta Augusta Rogers, Braxton Beacham Jr., and his wife Roberta Branch Beacham.&lt;ref name="Bacon1977" /&gt;

[[Florida]] and [[Orlando]] were on what was referred to by [[List of vaudeville performers: A–K|vaudeville performers]] as "[[Straw hat|The Straw Hat]] [[Atlantic Coast Line Railroad|Circuit]]."  The Beacham Theatre was included on the [[Alexander Pantages]], [[Orpheum Circuit#Late circuit (1919–1928)|Orpheum]], and [[Keith-Albee Theatre|Keith-Albee]] vaudeville performance circuits (later combined as the [[Keith-Albee-Orpheum]] circuit).&lt;ref name=Wilkening /&gt;&lt;ref name="ActTwo" /&gt;

Manager Harry Vincent started several promotions at the Beacham Theatre in the summer months of the mid-1920s that included [[Raffle|Bank Night]], [[Talent show|Amateur Night]], and  [[General store|Country Store Night]], which was supported by dozens of local [[merchant]]s.  An [[magazine|advertisement]] for the Beacham in 1925 says,  "Don't talk about the hot weather.  Beat the heat in a Beacham seat.  'Kum Keep Kumfy Kool at the Beacham' is known to many and you won't enjoy yourself until you too get into the line that leads to comfort."&lt;ref name=LMS&gt;What's What, Here and There as Recorded by "Bobby" (1925) magazine.

Frank Bell served as manager of the theater with [[organist]] Herman Siewart and Ken Guernsey leading the community [[sing-along]] at [[Forum (legal)|open forum]] meetings that were held for several months during the winter on Sunday afternoons.&lt;ref name="Bacon1977" /&gt;

The Beacham's "[[Film promotion|exploitation]] director" Frank H. Burns often designed and created large elaborate [[standee|standing displays]] that decorated the facade and lobby of the theater in order to [[Out-of-home advertising|advertise]] new film features.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/motionpicturenew00moti_7/motionpicturenew00moti_7_djvu.txt|title=Motion Picture News (May-Jun 1925)"|last=|first=|date=May 2, 1925|website=mediahistoryproject.org|publisher=The Museum of Modern Art Library coordinated by the Media History Digital Library|archive-url=https://archive.org/details/motionpicturenew00moti_7|archive-date=July 3, 2015|access-date=August 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The iconic displays that Burns created for the Beacham Theatre were sometimes complete with [[Costume coordination|coordinated costumes]] for the employees.

In 1928 [[Vitaphone]] and [[Movietone sound system|Movietone]] [[Sound film|"talkie"]] equipment debuted during the city's first "Progress Week" during the last week of August.   "The queen of the [[Femme fatale|vamps]]," [[actress]] [[Theda Bara]], was in appearance at the Beacham as [[secondary education in the United States|students]] from [[Orange County Public Schools#High schools|Orlando High School]] sneaked into the balcony via the [[fire escape]].&lt;ref name="ActTwo" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ives1953 /&gt;  Sound was provided by two [[gramophone records|gramophone discs]] that accompanied each film.

Output could be easily switched so that the film's sound could remain in [[synchronicity]] with the picture.&lt;ref name=Robinson1982/&gt;   William Booth succeeded Frank Bell as manager of the Beacham after Bell was transferred in 1928.&lt;ref name="Bacon1977" /&gt;

The city's "[[Blue law|Sunday closing law]]" was repealed by [[Voting|voters]] in 1929 by a majority of only 59 votes.  Movie theaters and other businesses in Orlando were then permitted to operate seven days a week.  All of Orlando's theaters, including the Beacham, celebrated by showing free films until late into the night.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=November 1996|title=Retroactively Speaking|url=|journal=Downtown Orlando Monthly|volume=|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=Theatre Historical Society of America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== End of the vaudeville and silent film era ====

Interest in silent films began to diminish in 1929 and they were gradually phased out and moved into [[obsolescence]].  On Thursday evenings at the Beacham for the Bank Night promotion, $200 was [[raffle]]d with prizes of $50.  On Saturday, December 24, 1931, and on Wednesday, September 28, 1932, a brand new $325 [[Austin 7#Austin Seven Swallow|Austin 7 Sport Roadster]] was given away.
Vaudeville acts continued touring at the Beacham for several more years until approximately 1933.  Homer Fuller served as manager of the Beacham during the end of the eras of silent films and vaudeville.

In 1933 following a bitter [[lawsuit]] against Orlando Enterprises over nonpayment of the lease for the building that had been originally negotiated with the senior Braxton Beacham in 1924, the theater was closed for almost three weeks.  $8000 in back taxes on Beacham's building was due.  Beacham Jr. claimed the closure was deliberate and malicious and sued for $100,000.  Two separate judgments were entered against Orlando Enterprises Inc. for $2291.67 each and a payment agreement was reached.  Litigation was then withdrawn.&lt;ref name="Bacon1977" /&gt;

As a result of the suit the lease was not renewed and Beacham's theater again became Orlando's only independent cinema.&lt;ref&gt;[https://orlandoretro.com/2013/04/18/beacham-movie-line-up-in-september-1933/ Beacham Movie Line Up in September 1933] (April 18, 2013), retrieved February 9, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;
In the same year, the theater was soon leased Florida State Theaters.&lt;ref name=Ives1953 /&gt;&lt;ref name= Sweers1981 /&gt;  Harry Vincent was named manager of the reopened theater in 1933; however, soon after, Vernon D.

In August 1937 the [[Orlando Police Department]] raided the Beacham Theatre.   All of the equipment for the Bank Night [[Promotion (marketing)|marketing promotion]] was [[Search and seizure|seized]] after authorities declared it to be a [[lottery]].&lt;ref name= OrlandoHPB /&gt;&lt;ref name= ActTwo /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bacon1977"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eve Bacon|title=Orlando: A Centennial History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4svzPQAACAAJ|year=1977|publisher=Mickler House}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1949 ''The [[Tom Thumb]] [[Follies]]'' staged [[Radio in the United States#Local radio in the Golden Age|radio broadcast]] performances at the Beacham.  When a  [[Santa Claus]] from the [[Elks Lodge]] lifted one young elf into the audience for the last verse, the smell of [[bourbon whiskey]] caused her to ponder, "I wasn't just sure where the night's polka would land us.

In 1964 the theater was temporarily closed down while [[Cinerama]] equipment was installed.  A super-wide [[Anamorphic widescreen|anamorphic movie screen]] was added to the auditorium and the stereophonic sound system was upgraded.  Two [[Philips DP70|Norelco Universal 70/35mm Motion Picture Projector]]s and a small restroom for the projectionist were installed in a newly built downstairs projection booth under the balcony that required the removal of two aisles and several seats.

====End of the first-run movie era====

During the 1970s Orlando, like many U.S. cites, was experiencing symptoms of [[urban decay]].  The rush from the city to the suburbs affected nearly all of the city's businesses.  As an effect of the exodus, each of Downtown Orlando's movie theaters closed.&lt;ref name=Berry1992 /&gt;&lt;ref name= ActTwo /&gt;   Dick Gabel and John Prine were serving as projectionists at several of the theaters.&lt;ref name=Treasures /&gt;  Following a decline in attendance, by 1974 the Beacham Theatre and Florida State Theaters in general were primarily showing [[exploitation films]] and [[B movie#1970s|B-movie]] [[action films]].&lt;ref name= Sweers1981 /&gt;  The next year, H.

Tedder, who was the Orlando executive manager at long-time [[lessee]] Florida State Theaters, made the decision that The Beacham Theatre would cease operating as a first-run movie cinema.&lt;ref name= Sweers1981 /&gt;  After showing a Sunday double-feature of ''[[Return of the Street Fighter]]'', and [[The Scavengers (1969 film)|''The Scavengers'']], the Beacham Theatre's manager, McKinley Howard, closed the theater's doors as a first-run film cinema for the last time on September 28, 1975.&lt;ref name=lastday&gt;Last picture Show: Beacham. September 28, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;  Florida State Theaters remained responsible for paying the monthly lease of $2700 until the theater was sold.&lt;ref name= Sweers1981 /&gt;

===Live Entertainment era===

In 1975 Larry and Sherry Carpenter purchased the Beacham Building from then-owners, Betty Rubles Bray, and Burkett H. Bray Jr.  A [[great-granddaughter]] of Braxton Beacham,  Mrs. Bray, refused to sell the theater by itself without also selling the rest of the building as a package.&lt;ref name="Hinson" /&gt;  An extensive $250,000 remodeling and restoration followed that included stunning multi-colored Art Deco revival style graphics painted over the facade and a large multi-story [[mural]] of a saxophone and its open case painted on the rear of the theater that faced west and was clearly visible from nearby [[Interstate 4]].  Following the restoration the Carpenters opened Orlando's [[Franchising|franchise]] location of '''The Great Southern Music Hall''' at the Beacham in 1976.&lt;ref name=Means1982 /&gt;   The 700-seat Great Southern Music Hall was a [[concert venue]] that hosted approximately 180 prominent national and regional acts at the Beacham.  The Great Southern Music Hall was occasionally still used as a movie theater that presented [[world cinema]] and [[Classical Hollywood cinema|classic Hollywood]] films by [[film director]]s such as [[John Carpenter]], [[Federico Fellini]], and [[Mel Brooks]] during the week.  John Lawson was the acting projectionist and served as stage director for concerts.  As The Great Southern Music Hall, only about seven music shows were unprofitable.  Nevertheless,  Orlando's Great Southern Music Hall closed in 1981 due to the rising costs of hosting concerts for [[Notability|notable]] musical acts and competition from larger venues.&lt;ref name="OrlandoHPB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hinson" /&gt;&lt;ref name= Sweers1981 /&gt;

Roberta Branch Beacham died in 1980.

[[File:Beacham Theatre mural 1.jpg|thumb|220px|Mural on Beacham Theater in 1983]]

In 1981 Sherry Carpenter, then sole owner, leased the theater to Jeff Roberts.  Roberts opened '''Laser World''', a [[futuristic]] one- and one-half hour [[laser light show]] that featured [[lasers]], [[sound]], [[ballet]], costumed [[modern dance]] routines and [[Magic (illusion)|magic]] [[illusion]], as well as [[outer space]] [[photographs]] that were projected onto a large viewing screen from behind.&lt;ref name="Sweers1981" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Andrews1996" /&gt;  Laser World closed in 1982.&lt;ref name="Means1982" /&gt;

Other short-lasting entities followed such as a [[Tourism|tourist-oriented]] [[laser tag]] business.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}  ''[[Orlando Sentinel|The Orlando Sentinel]]'' critic Howard Means, reminded readers, that the 1965 installation of "then-new [[Cinerama]] equipment at the Beacham was the latest testimony to the faith in the future of Downtown Orlando" and that, "The Beacham had long been seen as a bellwether of the health of the center city."  Upon further reflection, he lamented, "that the Beacham is simply a microcosm of modern downtown realities."  Means editorialized, by 1982 "The present state of the Beacham was the latest testament to decay," and, "In the way of dying enterprises, the Beacham's reincarnations became increasingly more short-lived."&lt;ref name="Means1982" /&gt;

In February 1983 Oscar F. Juarez, an Orlando [[Real estate development|property developer]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] [[strategist]], purchased the building for $1.5 million.&lt;ref name="Benedick1988"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1988-04-07/news/0030160194_1_beacham-juarez-board-members |title=Goodbye Voted For Beacham Board Says Owner May Tear Old Theater Down|last1=Benedick  |first1=Robin  |date=April 7, 1988 |website= |publisher=The Orlando Sentinel |access-date=August 24, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Soon after the purchase, a plan was announced to lease it in order to open a [[bar]] and French restaurant "with a [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]] flair" that later became Valentyne's Restaurant as well as a new nightclub inside the theater.&lt;ref name="Hinson" /&gt;

"This is like our Studio 54; there's just something about this room."  Between roughly 1989 and 1992, AAHZ blossomed into a weekly all-night Saturday dance party that attracted devoted fans who would travel from across the state to dance until daylight. "There's a scene in the movie '54,' when one of the characters walks into the club for the first time and everything just slows down and it's sensory overload,"... That philosophy yielded AAHZ, a concept eternally beloved by its fans and those who created it..."It still has some sort of energy in here for them," Collins says, looking around the room. "We feel it." }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theater was next leased by Ellen Hunt, of Orlando, and Roger Lopez, of [[France]] in August 1983.  Hunt and Lopez opened a [[cabaret]] club in the theater named '''[[Moulin Rouge|Moulin Orange]]''' that featured [[Las Vegas]]-style [[showgirl]]s.&lt;ref name="Hagstrom1984"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Curtain Call for Old Beacham Theater|last=Hagstrom|first=Suzy|date=November 5, 1984|work=The Orlando Sentinel|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moulin Orange was only open for several months during 1983 and 1984.&lt;ref name="Andrews1996" /&gt;

Despite the new recognition for the theater by the City of Orlando, Mr. Juarez saw the building as a liability with many pleasant memories surrounding it, but with little economic potential.  Citing maintaining the building and rehabilitation of the area, he first announced plans to raze the building for an unspecified mix-use purpose and later to redevelop the former Beacham Block with a new [[skyscraper]] that would be used as a combination office building and hotel.&lt;ref name=Snyder1987&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1987-07-13/business/0180230093_1_juarez-magnolia-avenue-orange-avenue |title=Juarez Building Finally Fills Up Developer Considers Building Second Office Project|last1=Snyder |first1= Jack|date=July 13, 1987 |website=orlandosentinel.com |publisher= The Orlando Sentinel |access-date=September 4, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Patrizio 1987"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1987-08-23/news/0140190075_1_historic-preservation-landmark-beacham |title=Historic Label No Guarantee Beacham Theater's Owner May Raze Old Downtown Building For New One |last1=Patrizio |first1= Ron |date=August 23, 1987 |website=orlandosentinel.com |publisher= The Orlando Sentinel |access-date=August 10, 2016|quote=The Beacham Theater has served as a city hall, vaudeville playhouse and movie theater.

In 1987 Brad Belletto and then-wife Lisa moved to Orlando from [[Louisiana]]. Brad Belletto, then owned a theatrical equipment manufacturing company and had formerly owned  Moon Sound, a [[New Orleans]] sound and lighting company. The Bellettos, intent on overhauling the music scene in Orlando, were looking for a new venue following operation of a successful club in [[Baton Rouge]].  They found the Beacham Theatre and immediately fell in love with it. At that time, the Beacham was being subleased to Clark J, a local record producer, and a brief partnership was formed.

Late in 1988 the lease for the Beacham's theater was secured by the Bellettos under Entertainment Investments International.&lt;ref name=Hodges1988 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mathers1991&gt;{{cite news |last=Mathers |first=Sandra |date=December 22, 1991 |title=Theater Plans Holiday Treat For Homeless|url= http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1991-12-22/news/9112200744_1_dinner-hammersmith-belletto|newspaper=''the Orlando Sentinel'' |location=Orlando |access-date= October 13, 2016|quote=The sit-down dinner is the brainchild of Brad and Lisa Belletto, whose Entertainment Investments company operates the theater and jazz club...Belletto said he patterned the dinner after a similar theater event he was involved with in New Orleans.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several of Lisa's cousins relocated to Orlando to help out with the task of preparing the Beacham for its opening and Brad's mother Bev tended the bar through the entire duration of the lease.  The Bellettos also hosted an annual full-service Christmas dinner for hundreds of the city's homeless population at the Beacham Theatre with food donated by Orlando's high-end restaurants and businesses.&lt;ref name=Mathers1991 /&gt;

The Bellettos planned to use the Beacham Theatre for [[Theatre|theatrical]] performances and concerts during the week and as a [[nightclub]] on the weekends.&lt;ref name=Hodges1988 /&gt;  Frank Carroll, served as the managing artistic director for theatre productions and starred in a [[Las Vegas]]-style musical [[revue]] tribute to [[Liberace]], ''Viva Liberace, Viva''.

Concerts were coordinated by Mary Ann D'Arpino of Mary Ann Productions, who had an office at the Beacham;  Island Productions; Harry Tiyler of Fat Harry Productions, and Cellar Door Productions.

=== Night Club era ===

Since 1988 the theater has been used as a series of combination [[nightclub]] and [[concert venue]] [[Business|enterprises]].

In May 1989 the Beacham Theatre was sold by Oscar Juarez for $1.8 million to a [[property management]] firm owned by [[Longwood, Florida|Longwood]] businesswoman Missy Casscells and her husband Frank Hamby.&lt;ref name="Jackson1992"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1992-10-31/business/9210310587_1_blues-club-beacham-alcoholic-beverage |title=State Files To Revoke Club's Liquor License|last1= Jackson|first1=Jerry |date=October 31, 1992 |website= orlandosentinel.com|publisher=The Orlando Sentinel |access-date=August 20, 2016 |quote=A Longwood businesswoman who owns the historic Beacham Theatre building in which the nightclub was located said she hopes to see some kind of similar club operation continue.

==== Late Night era: (1988–1994) Aahz  ====

Brad and Lisa Belletto scoured sources across the U.S. and Europe and traveled frequently for new and rare records. During the [[Second Summer of Love]] in the [[United Kingdom]] that began in 1988, on Friday and Saturday nights the Beacham Theater housed a [[discothèque|discotheque]] that had a progressive dance music format with Lisa Belletto as resident DJ and lighting control operator and Brad Belletto as operating director. Initially the club was to be called "[[Special effect|'''F/X''' (or '''Effects''')]]"&lt;ref name=Belletto1989&gt;Beacham Theatre Returns! 1988. Brad Belletto.&lt;/ref&gt;  but it opened as [[Hi-NRG|'''Pure Energy''']].

The late nights at the Beacham featured [[disc jockeys|DJs]], [[Beatmatching|beat matching]], [[Rare groove|rare and obscure]] [[dance music]] on [[Gramophone record|vinyl records]], [[intelligent lighting]], and themed decor that at times included original [[painting]]s by local artist Rollo. The popularity of dancing throughout the night at the Beacham Theatre initially caught on slowly and many free passes were given out.   Soon, the entry queue for "Late Night" snaked around the block.

The conceptual themes for "Late Night" were frequently alternated (sometimes weekly) and occasionally repeated.  The various themes subsequently included '''[[World War III]]''', [[Land of Oz|'''Aahz''']], [[Last Train to Trancentral#Trancentral|'''Trancentral''']], '''[[Haunted house|The Haunted Theatre]]''', [[Egypt#Prehistory and Ancient Egypt|'''Egypt''']],  '''[[Alphabet City]]''', '''Psychedelic Babylon''',  '''[[Unity (mathematics)|Unity]]''', and '''[[family reunion|Reunion]]'''. The all-night [[Dance party|dance parties]] were eventually referred to using the [[umbrella term]] "'Late Night' at the Classic Beacham Theatre."

The Aahz nightclub concept was born after Lisa saw the name at a shop in [[Los Angeles]].  The Bellettos and Shayni Howen then created and developed the Aahz concept for the Beacham.  Shayni and her team created Aahz's iconic décor which included a painted yellow brick road and a giant [[paper mache]] [[Wizard of Oz (character)|Wizard of Oz]] head behind the stage.  At midnight each night, the stage's curtain was raised and the glowing eyes and smoking mouth of the Wizard were revealed, at which point DJ Lisa always played Rhythm Device's ''Acid Rock''.

Eventually the combined tasks of simultaneously playing all of the music and operating the lights became overwhelming for Lisa and as a result Shayni's sister, "Late night" veteran Stacey "StaceBass" Howen, was brought in to operate the computerized [[lighting control console]] and [[Promoter (entertainment)|promote]] the nightclub.  By the Summer of 1989, Lisa was expecting her first child and still resident DJ.  Only two months before the birth of her son she invited Kimball Collins, who was the DJ in the Beacham Buildings northern unit, to replace her and hired him as Aahz's resident Late Night DJ.  Joseph Jilbert (DJ Jo-Edd), Steve McClure (DJ Monk) and Paul Campbell (DJ Stylus) had brief stints as DJ at "Late Night" when they were hired to fill in for Lisa or Kimball Collins. Dave Cannalte was quickly brought in as "Late Night's" co-resident DJ.

At this point, [[Underground music]] such as [[Industrial dance music]] and [[Gothic rock]] was played during Orlando's normal [[bar]] operating hours from 10&amp;nbsp;p.m. until just after 2&amp;nbsp;a.m.
Upon an announcement at around 2:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. (or an opening at 3&amp;nbsp;a.m.&lt;ref name=Montes /&gt;) that said simply, "Welcome to Late Night," mixed [[New Beat]], [[Progressive house|Progressive dance]], [[Balearic beat]], and [[Acid house]] electronic dance music began that frequently lasted until 8 a.m. and occasionally lasted until as late as 11 a.m.&lt;ref name=ThumpDJThree /&gt;

Local DJ's Jerry Johnson (''the Reverend''),  Andy Hughes, Jay Skinner, Robby Clark, Troy Davis, Eddie Pappa ([[DJ Icey]]) and DJ Lisa Belletto were occasional guests for special events such as the "DJ Unity for the World" dance party in December 1991.&lt;ref name=Unity&gt;{{cite news |last=Abbott |first= Jim|date=December 6, 1991 |title=Public Enemy To Play Orlando |url= http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1991-12-06/entertainment/9112050582_1_ron-brooks-downtown-orlando-concert|newspaper=''The Orlando Sentinel'' |location= Orlando|access-date=October 12, 2016|quote=Saturday, the Beacham Theatre will host DJ Unity for the World, a dance party featuring the talents of Central Florida club deejays Jerry ''the Reverend'' Johnson, Lisa Belletto, Andy Hughes, Jay Skinner, Robby Clark, Troy Davis, DJ Ice, the Dave Cannalte and Kimball Collins.  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, at 3:00am on Saturday nights, Aahz would open its doors to the then hugely popular, and extremely underground, Rave scene of the early 90's.

AAHZ was a late night event that was held at The Beacham nightclub back in the late 80′s/early 90′s. It was so much more than just a night at a club though. It was more of a family reunion every time you walked through the doors. This was in the era where PLUR (Peace, Love, Unity, Respect) was still the main player at these sort of events. This was back in the day before distractions like cell phones and digital cameras were in everyone's hands and it was just you, the crowd, and the DJ.  The time when music connected people in a way that very few will ever understand.  People came from all over the state to attend the famed AAHZ events. This was a place where you could go and totally let loose without fear of judgment by others. People came to AAHZ for the music and the vibe. The way the DJ's were able to use their turntables to emotionally connect so many different people through their music could not be duplicated anywhere. They quite literally had the mood of the entire room in their hands behind the decks. People thrived off of this new underground culture that was being introduced to Orlando through these AAHZ events.  AAHZ was in a league of its own in the Orlando club scene, hosting international talents like Sasha and John Digweed, but, little did anyone know what AAHZ would do for its resident DJ's Kimball Collins and Dave Cannalate. Both have become international superstars and a slew of other AAHZ regular customers like Andy Hughes and DJ Icey were not too far behind them. There is no doubt that AAHZ and its DJ's helped put Orlando on the map and in the forefront of the entire Electronic Dance Music movement across the United States.  There really is no way to adequately convey the true meaning or raw emotion of what AAHZ was, or why so many people considered it to be "home." ... Unfortunately, AAHZ came to an end in 1992, and with that came the end of an era for the Orlando club scene and Orlando Electronic Dance Music as a whole. The days of AAHZ may never be able to be totally recreated as it once was, however, AAHZ holds their reunion in Downtown Orlando every year, where they make sure that old school vibe is still in full effect. People who were involved in it during its peak fly in from all around the country just to attend and reclaim their little piece of perfect that used to reside in the heart of Downtown Orlando.}}{{dead link|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RPM&gt;{{cite web |url=http://waxdj.com/djs/5215//info_16436.php |title=Aahz '89 Quintessential New Beat w/ DJ Joe Ed Info:|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=March 25, 2008 |website= waxdj.com|publisher=WaxDJ |access-date= September 1, 2016|quote=DJ Joe Ed was one of the founding fathers of Aahz (Orlando) with Stace-Bass and Steve McClure until he handed the reigns off to Dave Cannalte and Kimball Collins who made Aahz what we remember to this day! ...

====Cultural impact====

The early mornings at the Beacham Theatre kick started Orlando's own [[Summer of Love]] between 1991 and 1992 that helped usher in the increased popularity of the [[Clubbing (subculture)|subculture]] surrounding [[electronic dance music]] in Florida and subsequently in the United States.  "Late Night" organized several [[music festival]]s that were held at the [[Orange County Convention Center]] such as the "[[Infinity (philosophy)|Infonet]]" DJ spinoff on October 24, 1992, the "Infonet 2" dance party on December 31, 1992, and "Infonet 3," "The Underground Explosion," on July 3, 1993.  Subsequent large-event promoters failed to emulate the spirit of those events.  Although, "[[rave]]s" per se were not held in the Theater, the Beacham served as the prototype for nearly all of the larger so-called [[Electronic dance music#Popularization in the United States|rave-oriented]] nightclubs that followed it.&lt;ref name=Guinto1993&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1993-08-01/news/9308010603_1_rave-downtown-orlando-spinoffs |title= All The Rave|last1=Guinto |first1= Liesl  |date=August 1, 1993 |website=orlandosentinel.com |publisher=The Orlando Sentinel |access-date=August 16, 2016 |quote=The Orlando rave scene can trace its roots back almost five years to the old Beacham Theatre in downtown Orlando, also known as Aahz.

====End of the Late Night and Live Entertainment eras====

Inside "Late Night" at the Beacham was always very dark and the auditorium was absolutely filthy.  In contrast, initially the scene's "[[Energy (esotericism)|vibe]]" was pure and drugs such as [[MDMA]] that were available  were relatively unadulterated.  As time went on, the beloved Beacham was [[Beautification|beautified]] and remodeled into Dekko's.  While the Beacham itself was cleaned up, the overall "vibe" of Orlando's scene seemed to darken somewhat just as the quality of [[club drugs]] that were still available during that time became tainted.&lt;ref name=Kelemen1998 /&gt;

During the summer of 1994, at a "Late Night" event featuring a [[guest appearance]] DJ Sasha, two female revelers who were attending a Reunion  event at the Beacham Theatre collapsed just before sunrise.&lt;ref name=Kelemen1998 /&gt; The women were carried outside to Orange Avenue in front of Dekko's where [[CPR]] was administered by an [[Orlando Police Department]] officer and [[paramedics]] were dispatched.  Tragically, one of the young women [[death|expired]].  ''The Orlando Sentinel'' reported the May 1, 1994, passing of 20-year old Teresa Schwartz and that the other young woman was briefly in critical condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1994-05-02/news/9405020286_1_lake-mary-downtown-nightclub-orlando |title=2 Women Fall Ill At Club In Orlando - 1 Is Dead |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=May 2, 1994 |website=orlandosentinel.com |publisher=The Orlando Sentinel |access-date=August 8, 2016 |quote=A 20-year-old Melbourne woman died and an 18-year-old Lake Mary woman is in critical condition after both collapsed from what Orlando police think were drug overdoses at a downtown nightclub Sunday morning.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1995-06-18/news/9506150696_1_mdma-ecstasy-downtown-orlando |title=Drugs: Facing Agony Of Ecstasy |last1=  Leithauser|first1=Tom |date=June 18, 1995 |website=orlandosentinel.com |publisher=The Orlando Sentinel |access-date=August 10, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1994-07-06/news/9407060231_1_drug-overdose-schwartz-apparent-drug |title=Woman Dies Of Apparent Drug Overdose, Police Say |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=July 6, 1994 |website=orlandosentinel.com |publisher= The Orlando Sentinel|access-date=July 29, 2016 |quote=In the earlier death, 20-year-old Teresa Schwartz of Melbourne collapsed May 1 outside of Dekko's Night Club on Orange Avenue downtown.

The incident along with those at other venues in Orlando, shocked the underground dance club scene in Central Florida and were followed by a dramatic decrease in attendance.  "Late Night's" organizers made the responsible decision to end Reunion at Dekko's after their pleas for young club-goers to practice [[moderation]] were ignored.  The Dekko's concept was sold to a competitor in the following months.&lt;ref name="OrlandoHPB" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kelemen1998 /&gt;&lt;ref name=clubscene2015 /&gt;

====Night Club exclusive use era====

By 1992 the future looked brighter for the Beacham Theatre when Mike Berry, staff writer, for ''The Orlando Sentinel'' wrote that, "The Beacham Theatre is the latest testament to [[reincarnation]]."  Concerts were no longer being held in the auditorium during this time period and the Beacham Theatre was used exclusively as night club through 2010.

It was 1992 when Orlando [[Lawyer|Attorney]] Mark NeJame leased the Beacham Theatre with the option to match the purchase price of any prospective buyers.&lt;ref name=Berry1992 /&gt;   The Beacham underwent restoration at a cost of in excess of $1,000,000.  NeJame then opened "'''Dekko's'''," a mainstream "high-energy dance club."   "Dekko's" is an [[Amalgamation (names)|amalgam]] of [[Art Deco|Deco]] and [[Gekko]].    The "Dekko's" concept featured a rose-beige exterior with a newly [[Building restoration|restored]] [[Art Deco]] inspired facade with red [[neon lighting]].  Dekko's interior included extensive use of the color [[purple]] and a [[sushi]] bar in the balcony.  The inclusion of a [[terrarium]] ([[vivarium]]) with live subtropical [[geckos]] was planned.&lt;ref name=Berry1992&gt;{{cite news |last= Berry |first=Mike |date=October 14, 1992  |title=Another facade may soon grace historic Beacham: Beacham may get a Face Lift |url= |newspaper= The Orlando Sentinel|location=Orlando, FL |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Dekko's" was open from late 1992 until the "high-energy dance club" [[concept]] was bought out in 1994 by Bill Harmening who operated The Edge, a competing nightclub.&lt;ref name=OrlandoHPB /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kelemen1998 /&gt;

"'''Zuma Beach Club'''" followed Dekko's and opened in 1994.&lt;ref name=OrlandoHPB /&gt;&lt;ref name=Early1996&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1996-01-28/news/9601250598_1_orlando-opera-opera-house-movie-houses |title= Early Entertainment Venues Evolved From Opera House To Movie Theaters|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=January 28, 1996 |website=orlandosentinel.com |publisher=The Orlando Sentinel |access-date= August 21, 2016|quote=...the former site of the county jail where hangings once were conducted - and built the Beacham Theater...Air conditioning was installed in the '30s...It later was home to Laser World; then to Moulin Orange, a Las Vegas-style cabaret that lasted four months in 1983-84; and then to Valentyne's Celebrity Dinner Theatre, which opened in 1987.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The recently remodeled auditorium was gutted for the change.  Redecoration was complete with [[fishing net]]s, galvanized [[watering trough]]s for beer, and [[warning signs]] for [[sharks]].  On February 22, 1995, NeJame entered a new [[partnership]] with George Maltezos, John SanFelippo and brother, Joseph SanFelippo.  Zuma Beach was often described by NeJame as "the cheesiest club in America."  ''Rolling Stone'' in 1997 described Zuma Beach as a "cheesy dive."&lt;ref name=Weir1997 /&gt;  Zuma Beach even hosted an [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] "hardcore" [[professional wrestling]] match on January 29, 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/2000a.html#012900 |title=ECW hardcore wrestling |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=January–March 2000 |website=prowrestlinghistory.com |publisher=Pro Wrestiling History |access-date=November 22, 2016 |quote=January 29, 2000 in Orlando, FL; Zuma Beach Club drawing 800}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mercifully, "Zuma Beach" closed its doors in late 2000.&lt;ref name =Emmons2000&gt;{{cite web |url= http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2000-06-09/entertainment/0006080412_1_beacham-nejame-zuma|title=Beacham Theatre May live Again |last1= Emmons|first1=M.

Finally, after yet another remodeling of the auditorium, "'''Tabu''' opened in 2001."  Initially, Tabu was more of an upscale nightclub.  [[Backstreet Boy]] [[Howie Dorough]], who performed his first musical at the Beacham as one of the [[Munchkins]] in the [[Lollipop Guild]] for a [[theatre production]] of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1987 musical)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', was a design and talent acquisition advisor for Tabu.&lt;ref name =Emmons2000 /&gt;  However, Tabu later became more [[mainstream]].  Tabu had a weekly lineup presentation that with the exception of hosting live music, was similar to the theater's current nightclub iteration.&lt;ref name=Tabunow&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2011-01-06/entertainment/os-bars-rail-010711-20110106_1_tabu-hip-hop-sanfelippo-and-george-maltezos |title=Tabu is now The Beacham |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=January 6, 2011 |website=orlandosentinel.com |publisher=The Orlando Sentinel |access-date=August 10, 2016 |quote= John SanFelippo and George Maltezos, co-owners of Tabu ... have partnered with Gerard Mitchell and Michael McRaney, co-owners of The Social, in opening the newly named venue at 46 N.

====Return of Live Entertainment====

[[File:Beacham logo 1.gif|thumb|115px|right|Beacham logo]]

In 2011 leases for the Beacham Theatre were renewed by John SanFelippo and George Maltezos, along with Gerard Mitchell and Michael McRaney, who leased the adjacent unit.  Their [[partnership]] is named 46/54 North Orange Ave, LLC, and both units are leased from building owners  Margaret Casscells and Frank Hamby, of Beacham Theater, LLC.

[[File:The Beacham logo.png|thumb|200px|left]]

Since 2011 "'''The Beacham'''" nightclub has operated in partnership with "The Social," a smaller venue next door at 54 North Orange Avenue.  The venues, are connected via a [[Passage (architecture)|passage]] and [[door]].  The Beacham features [[disc jockey]] entertainment and plays [[Hip hop music|Hip hop]], [[Top 40]], [[Latin music (genre)|Latin music]], and [[Reggaeton]]."&lt;ref name=Tabunow /&gt;

The Live Entertainment era currently continues on stages at both The Beacham and partner The Social.  Prominent national and international musical acts perform with [[fidelity]] to the countless shows by numerous acts that have previously held performances in the Beacham Theatre from the mid-1970s through the early-1990s.

==Description==

Beacham's Building is divided into seven rental units using wood frame, brick walls, different facades, and paint. The theater is the south-most unit. The two-story Beacham Theatre was constructed in 1921 in a simple 20th Century Commercial Style.  The structure is constructed of [[reinforced concrete]] and [[brick]] with [[stucco]] out-surface.  Utilization of wood in the construction was minimized.&lt;ref name="newbeacham1921" /&gt;

===Historical===

The facade was decorated with multi-colored tile trim and impregnated with [[seashell]].  The first story originally contained two small storefronts, a [[boxoffice]], and lobby entrance to the theater as well the [[auditorium]], [[Stage (theatre)|stage]], dressing rooms, staff restrooms, and a [[green room]].  The second story of the theater contained [[Bathroom|restrooms]], windowed offices, a [[projection booth]], and [[balcony]] seating section as well as additional [[dressing room (theater)|dressing rooms]] accessible by a spiral staircase.&lt;ref name=Ives1953 /&gt;  Above the stage was the [[fly system]] and [[Catwalk (theater)|catwalk]].

=== Modifications ===

In 1936 [[Art Deco]] styling with Mediterranean-style tile was added to the facade and extensive neon lighting was installed the on the entrance [[Overhang (architecture)|overhang]].&lt;ref name=OrlandoHPB /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ives1953 /&gt; Inside, the theater was modernized to provide lighted stairs, air conditioning into the dressing rooms, an enlarged auditorium, and improved seating.  Capacity was reduced to 1,051.&lt;ref name= Sweers1981 /&gt;  To diminish [[echo (phenomenon)|echo]]es from the projectors and recorded sound equipment, the auditorium was carpeted with a floral pattern and the plaster walls were covered with an Ozite material.&lt;ref name=Robinson1982&gt;{{cite interview|last=Robinson|first=Wendall|subject-link=|interviewer=B.T. Sherwood|title=Interview of Wendall O. Robinson (projectionist)|url=|location=Orlando|date=February 5, 1982|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vernon Hunter oversaw the modernization.&lt;ref name=Ives1953 /&gt;

[[File:Beacham Theatre upstairs offices in 1991.jpg|thumb|170px|Beacham Theatre upstairs offices in March 1991.]]

In 1954 the look of the theater was modernized once again with the removal of [[parapets]], [[cornices]], and windows.  The marquee was replaced with a new [[Vitreous enamel|porcelain]] one.  The lobby was enclosed with glass doors and the [[boxoffice]] was moved to the right side of the lobby exterior and rebuilt.  An entirely new stucco sheeting was installed over the facade, a wide screen was installed, and new decorations and push-back seats were added with additional alterations to the floor plan and seating areas.  Capacity was reduced to 650.&lt;ref name="OrlandoHPB" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ives1953/&gt;&lt;ref name= Sweers1981 /&gt;&lt;ref name=boxoffice1954 /&gt;

In 1964 the [[proscenium]] was modified to accommodate the installation of [[Cinerama]] widescreen.&lt;ref name= Sweers1981 /&gt; A new projection room was constructed under the balcony to accommodate 70-mm projectors.
      
By 1975 the theater was no longer being used as a feature cinema. For the 1976 opening of the Great Southern Music Hall, the theater's interior and stage were remodeled, the proscenium was rebuilt, balcony seating was added.   The facade was repainted with Art Deco graphics and a large mural was painted on the back of the theater.  Capacity was increased to 765.&lt;ref name="OrlandoHPB" /&gt;&lt;ref name= Sweers1981 /&gt;

[[File:Beacham Theatre balcony restoration in 1991.jpg|thumb|180px|The balcony was remodeled in March 1991 revealing the theater's original 35 mm film projection  port.]]

The balcony was extended in 1981.

In 1984 the theater cinema's 765 seats were removed and sold  and the sloped auditorium floor was [[Terrace (stadium)|terraced]].&lt;ref name="Hinson" /&gt;  Buffet dinner tables for 400 and balcony tables for 100 were added.  The [[Parts of a theatre#Backstage or offstage|backstage]] area was remodeled, and the balcony was restored back to its original shape.  Exterior [[drainage]] was improved.

The degraded ceiling plasterwork was repaired and repainted, the roof was replaced and wiring were upgraded in 1988.&lt;ref name=Hodges1988 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Maupin1988 /&gt;  External air conditioning was being pumped in.

By 1991 the balcony was renovated and re-extended and the [[70 mm film]] projection room under the balcony had been removed and the air conditioning repaired.  Opera boxes were installed on the second floor of either side of the stage and the DJ booth was relocated shortly thereafter.

[[File:Beacham Theatre restoration proposal.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Facade restoration proposal for the Beacham Theatre]]

As the Beacham was renovated to become Dekkos's in 1992, it was discovered that the stucco sheeting that was installed during a modernization in 1954 could not be economically removed without severely damaging the original facade underneath.  Restoration plans for the facade had to be modified.&lt;ref name=OrlandoHPB /&gt;
An arched molding was then added to the facade.  A [[sunburst]] and red neon lighting was subsequently added.

Following an effort to "bring back the [[aesthetics]] of the old Beacham Theatre," in 2000 owners restored the Beacham's ornate [[plaster]] ceiling moldings, [[facade]], and marquee. In addition, the sloping theater floor was made level and the stage was elevated.  The original Beacham Theatre sign is awaiting [[Building restoration|restoration]] and is being stored on the roof.&lt;ref name= Emmons2000 /&gt;

Around 2005, the facade was modified by removing a small semi-circular molding in front of the sunburst.  The points of the [[sunburst]] were also removed leaving a large semi-circular molding and larger arch above it decorating the facade.

[[File:Beacham Theatre facade in 2015.jpg|thumb|180px|Beacham Theatre's facade was in poor condition between 2014 and 2016.]]

====Recent Changes====

The balcony and upstairs areas were [[Renovation|remodeled]] in 2011 with a beautifully painted ceiling and the addition of two [[chandeliers]].  [[Public toilet|Restroom]]s were installed in place of the theater's original office area and [[35 mm film]] [[projection booth]].  The theater's ornate plaster ceilings are in a state of disrepair with the decorative ceiling concealed behind a black cloth barrier that can retain any pieces of plaster that might fall.

During the summer months of 2016 the crumbling arched molding was removed from the facade.  The facade was then repaired and repainted and new red and blue neon lighting was installed.  Further restoration in the near future is in a discussion and planning stage.

A '''carpet plot''' is any of a few different specific types of [[Plot_(graphics)|plot]]. The more common plot referred to as a carpet plot is one that illustrates the interaction between two or more independent variables and one or more dependent variables in a two-dimensional plot. Besides the ability to incorporate more variables, another feature that distinguishes a carpet plot from an equivalent [[contour plot]] or 3D surface plot is that a carpet plot can be used to more accurately interpolate data points. A conventional carpet plot can capture the interaction of up to three independent variables and three dependent variables and still be easily read and interpolated.

Carpet plots have common applications within areas such as [[material science]] for showing [[elastic modulus]] in [[laminates]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://math.materials-sciences.com/webMathematica/MSC/JSP/carpet.jsp |title=Laminate Carpet Plots |accessdate=6 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120214946/http://math.materials-sciences.com/webMathematica/MSC/JSP/carpet.jsp |archivedate=20 November 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and within [[aeronautics]].&lt;ref name="ESDU"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.esdu.com/cgi-bin/ps.pl?sess=unlicensed_1100107121229jld&amp;t=di&amp;p=di_04008|title=Use of Carpet Plots to represent functions of two variables|accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Daniel_Raymer|last= Raymer|first=D. P. |title= Aircraft Design: A Conceptual Approach |publisher= American Institut of Aeronautics |year= 1992 |location= Reston |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=9jBsLgEACAAJ |page=529}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another plot sometimes referred to as a carpet plot is the [[Temporal Raster Plot|temporal raster plot]]. 

== Variants ==

=== Three-variable carpet plot (cheater plot) ===

A carpet plot with two independent variables and one dependent variable is often called a cheater plot for the use of a phantom "cheater" axis in lieu of the horizontal axis. As a result of this missing axis, the values can be shifted horizontally such that the intersections line up vertically. This allows for easy interpolation by having fixed horizontal intervals correspond to fixed intervals in both independent variables. The horizontal shift must sometimes be adjusted in order to eliminate or mitigate overlapping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dept.aoe.vt.edu/~mason/Mason_f/SD1CarpetsbySAP.pdf|title='The Generation of Carpet Plots'|accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the data being depicted, eliminating overlapping is not always possible. The common solution is to split the plot into two carpets.

=== Four-variable carpet plot (true carpet plot) ===

Instead of using the horizontal axis to adjust the plot perspective and align carpet intersections vertically, the horizontal axis can be used to show the effects on an additional dependent variable.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, Markus. ''How to Generate Carpet Plots: A Guide to Creating Visual Trade Studies''.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case the perspective is fixed, and any overlapping cannot be adjusted. Because a true carpet plot represents two independent variables and two dependent variables simultaneously, there is no corresponding way to show the information on a conventional contour plot or 3D surface plot.

=== Carpet plot with isolines ===

To add an additional dependent variable, [[Contour line|isolines]] that are a function of the two independent variables can be added within the carpet to create a contour plot in the carpet domain. Contours can be added to cheater plots as well as to true carpet plots.&lt;ref name="gasturb"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gasturb.de/Gtb12Tutorials/GasTurb12DesignParametric.ppt|title='Gasturb Tutorial 2 - Cycle Design Parametric Study'|accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lattice plot ===

The effects of an additional independent variable can be visualized via multiple carpets on the same plot corresponding to different values of the third independent variable. If the intersections are connected, a lattice appears. For an intermediate value, a whole carpet can be interpolated using the lattice lines.&lt;ref name="ESDU" /&gt; This technique may result in too much overlapping of carpets in a true carpet plot but is always possible for a cheater plot because the separation of the additional carpets can be adjusted on the phantom horizontal axis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3896">The '''Comstock–Needham system''' is a naming system for [[insect]] [[Insect wing|wing]] [[veins]], devised by [[John Henry Comstock|John Comstock]] and [[James George Needham|George Needham]] in 1898. It was an important step in showing the [[homology (biology)|homology]] of all [[insect wings]]. This system was based on Needham's ''pretracheation theory'' that was later discredited by [[Frederic Charles Fraser]] in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, F. C.  1938.  A note on the fallaciousness of the theory of pretracheation in the venation of Odonata.  ''Proc. Roy. Ent. Soc. London'' (A) 13: 60–70&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vein terminology==

===Longitudinal veins===
[[Image:Comstock-needham.svg|thumb|Insect wing venation, showing the names after the Comstock–Needham system|400px|right]]The Comstock and Needham system attributes different names to the veins on an insect's wing. From the [[anterior]] (leading) edge of the wing towards the [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] (rear), the major [[Anatomical terms of location|longitudinal]] veins are named:
*{{anchor|costa}}''costa'' '''C''', meaning ''rib''
*{{anchor|subcosta}}''subcosta'' '''Sc''', meaning ''below the rib''
*{{anchor|radius}}''radius'' '''R''', in analogy with a bone in the forearm, the [[radius (bone)|radius]]
*{{anchor|media}}''media'' '''M''', meaning ''middle''
*{{anchor|cubitus}}''cubitus'' '''Cu''', meaning ''elbow''
*{{anchor|anal veins}}''anal veins'' '''A''', in reference to its posterior location

Apart from the costal and the anal veins, each vein can be branched, in which case the branches are numbered from anterior to posterior. For example, the two branches of the {{anchor|subcostal vein}}subcostal vein will be called '''Sc&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' and '''Sc&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''.

The {{anchor|radial veins}}radius typically branches once near the base, producing anteriorly the '''R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' and posteriorly the ''radial sector'' '''Rs'''. The radial sector may fork twice.

The media may also fork twice, therefore having four branches reaching the wing margin.

According to the Comstock–Needham system, the cubitus forks once, producing the {{anchor|cubital vein}}cubital veins Cu&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. 
According to some other authorities, Cu&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; may fork again, producing the Cu&lt;sub&gt;1a&lt;/sub&gt; and Cu&lt;sub&gt;1b&lt;/sub&gt;.

As there are several anal veins, they are called '''A1''', '''A2''', and so on. They are usually unforked.

===Crossveins===
Crossveins link the longitudinal veins, and are named accordingly (for example, the medio-cubital crossvein is termed '''m-cu'''). Some crossveins have their own name, like the [[humeral]] crossvein '''h''' and the sectoral crossvein '''s'''.

==Cell terminology==
The cells are named after the vein on the anterior side; for instance, the cell between Sc&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is called '''Sc&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''.

In the case where two cells are separated by a crossvein but have the same anterior longitudinal vein, they should have the same name. To avoid this, they are attributed a number. For example, the R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; cell is divided in two by the radial cross vein: the basal cell is termed "first R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;", and the distal cell "second R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;".

If a cell is bordered anteriorly by a forking vein, such as R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, the cell is named after the distal vein, in this case R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

{{InfoMaps}}
A '''concept map''' or '''conceptual diagram''' is a [[diagram]] that depicts suggested relationships between [[concept]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Hager, Nancy C. Corbin. ''Designing &amp; Delivering: Scientific, Technical, and Managerial Presentations,'' 1997, . 163.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a graphical tool that [[instructional designer]]s, [[engineer]]s, [[Technical communication|technical writers]], and others use to organize and structure [[knowledge]].

A concept map typically represents ideas and information as boxes or circles, which it connects with labeled arrows in a downward-branching hierarchical structure. The relationship between concepts can be articulated in '''linking phrases''' such as ''causes'', ''requires'', or ''contributes to''.&lt;ref name=theory&gt;[[Joseph D. Novak]] &amp; Alberto J. Cañas (2006). [http://cmap.ihmc.us/Publications/ResearchPapers/TheoryCmaps/TheoryUnderlyingConceptMaps.htm "The Theory Underlying Concept Maps and How To Construct and Use Them"], [[Institute for Human and Machine Cognition]]. Accessed 24 Nov 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique for [[Visualization (graphic)|visualizing]] these relationships among different concepts is called ''concept mapping''. Concept maps have been used to define the [[Ontology (information science)|ontology]] of computer systems, for example with the [[object-role modeling]] or [[Unified Modeling Language]] formalism.

== Overview ==
A concept map is a way of representing relationships between [[idea]]s, [[image]]s, or [[word]]s in the same way that a [[sentence diagram]] represents the grammar of a sentence, a road map represents the locations of highways and towns, and a [[circuit diagram]] represents the workings of an electrical appliance. In a concept map, each word or phrase connects to another, and links back to the original idea, word, or phrase. Concept maps are a way to develop logical thinking and study skills by revealing connections and helping students see how individual ideas form a larger whole. An example of the use of concept maps is provided in the context of learning about types of fuel.{{clarify|why is this noteworthy?|date=November 2016}}&lt;ref name="CMP"&gt;[http://www.energyeducation.tx.gov/pdf/223_inv.pdf CONCEPT MAPPING FUELS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721062626/http://www.energyeducation.tx.gov/pdf/223_inv.pdf |date=2011-07-21 }}. Accessed 24 Nov 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concept maps were developed{{according to whom|date=November 2016}} to enhance meaningful learning in the sciences{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}. A well-made concept map grows within a ''context frame'' defined by an explicit "focus question", while a [[mind map]] often has only branches radiating out from a central picture. Some research evidence suggests that the brain stores knowledge as productions (situation-response conditionals) that act on [[declarative memory]] content, which is also referred to as chunks or propositions.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, J. R., &amp; Lebiere, C. (1998). The atomic components of thought. Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, J. R., Byrne, M. D., Douglass, S., Lebiere, C., &amp; Qin, Y. (2004). An Integrated Theory of the Mind. Psychological Review, 111(4), 1036&amp;ndash;1050.&lt;/ref&gt; Because concept maps are constructed to reflect organization of the declarative memory system, they facilitate sense-making and meaningful learning on the part of individuals who make concept maps and those who use them.

== Differences from other visualizations ==

* ''Topic maps'': Concept maps are rather similar to [[topic map]]s in that both allow to concepts or topics via [[graph (data structure)|graphs]]. Among the various schema and techniques for visualizing ideas, processes, and organizations, concept mapping, as developed by [[Joseph D. Novak|Joseph Novak]] is unique in its philosophical basis, which "makes concepts, and propositions composed of concepts, the central elements in the structure of knowledge and construction of meaning."&lt;ref&gt;Novak, J.D. &amp; Gowin, D.B. (1996). Learning How To Learn, Cambridge University Press: New York, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Mind maps'': Both concept maps and topic maps can be contrasted with [[mind mapping]], which is often restricted to radial hierarchies and [[tree structure]]s. Another contrast between concept mapping and mind mapping is the speed and spontaneity when a mind map is created. A mind map reflects what you think about a single topic, which can focus group brainstorming. A concept map can be a map, a system view, of a real (abstract) system or set of concepts. Concept maps are more free form, as multiple hubs and clusters can be created, unlike mind maps, which typically emerge from a single center.

== History ==
Concept mapping was developed by [[Joseph D. Novak]] and his research team at [[Cornell University]] in the 1970s as a means of representing the emerging science knowledge of students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ihmc.us/users/user.php?UserID=jnovak|title=Joseph D. Novak|publisher=Institute for Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC)|accessdate=2008-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has subsequently been used as a tool to increase meaningful learning in the sciences and other subjects as well as to represent the expert knowledge of individuals and teams in education, government and business. Concept maps have their origin  in the learning movement called [[constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]]. In particular, constructivists hold that learners actively construct knowledge.

Novak's work is based on the cognitive theories of [[David Ausubel]], who stressed the importance of prior knowledge in being able to learn (or ''assimilate'') new concepts: "The most important single factor influencing learning is what the learner already knows. Ascertain this and teach accordingly."&lt;ref&gt;Ausubel, D. (1968) Educational Psychology: A Cognitive View. Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Novak taught students as young as six years old to make concept maps to represent their response to focus questions such as "What is water?" "What causes the seasons?" In his book ''Learning How to Learn'', Novak states that a "meaningful learning involves the assimilation of new concepts and propositions into existing cognitive structures."

Various attempts have been made to conceptualize the process of creating concept maps. Ray McAleese, in a series of articles, has suggested that mapping is a process of ''off-loading''. In this 1998 paper, McAleese draws on the work of Sowa&lt;ref&gt;Sowa, J.F., 1983. ''Conceptual structures: information processing in mind and machine'', Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt; and a paper by Sweller &amp; Chandler.&lt;ref&gt;Sweller, J. &amp; Chandler, P., 1991. Evidence for Cognitive Load Theory. ''Cognition and Instruction'', 8(4), p.351-362.&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, McAleese suggests that the process of making knowledge explicit, using ''nodes'' and ''relationships'', allows the individual to become aware of what they know and as a result to be able to modify what they know.&lt;ref&gt;McAleese, R. (1998) The Knowledge Arena as an Extension to the Concept Map: Reflection in Action, ''Interactive Learning Environments'', 6(3), p.251–272.&lt;/ref&gt; Maria Birbili applies that same idea to helping young children learn to think about what they know.&lt;ref&gt;Birbili, M. (2006) [http://ecrp.uiuc.edu/v8n2/birbili.html "Mapping Knowledge: Concept Maps in Early Childhood Education"], ''Early Childhood Research &amp; Practice'', ''8(2)'', Fall 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of the ''knowledge arena'' is suggestive of a virtual space where learners may explore what they know and what they do not know.

==Use==
[[Image:Conceptmap.png|thumb|450px|Example concept map created using the IHMC CmapTools computer program.]]
Concept maps are used to stimulate the generation of ideas, and are believed to aid [[creativity]].&lt;ref name="theory"/&gt; Concept mapping is also sometimes used for [[brain-storming]]. Although they are often personalized and idiosyncratic, concept maps can be used to communicate complex ideas.

Formalized concept maps are used in [[software design]], where a common usage is [[Unified Modeling Language]] diagramming amongst similar conventions and development methodologies.

Concept mapping can also be seen as a first step in [[ontology (computer science)|ontology]]-building, and can also be used flexibly to represent formal argument &amp;mdash; similar to [[argument map]]s.

Concept maps are widely used in education and business. Uses include:
*[[Note taking]] and summarizing gleaning key concepts, their relationships and hierarchy from documents and source materials
*New knowledge creation: e.g., transforming [[tacit knowledge]] into an organizational resource, mapping team knowledge
*Institutional knowledge preservation (retention), e.g., eliciting and mapping expert knowledge of employees prior to retirement
*Collaborative knowledge modeling and the transfer of expert knowledge
*Facilitating the creation of shared vision and shared understanding within a team or organization
*Instructional design: concept maps used as [[David Ausubel|Ausubelian]] "advance organizers" that provide an initial conceptual frame for subsequent information and learning.
*Training: concept maps used as [[David Ausubel|Ausubelian]] "advanced organizers" to represent the training context and its relationship to their jobs, to the organization's strategic objectives, to training goals.
*Communicating complex ideas and arguments
*Examining the symmetry of complex ideas and arguments and associated terminology
*Detailing the entire structure of an idea, [[train of thought]], or line of argument (with the specific goal of exposing faults, errors, or gaps in one's own reasoning) for the scrutiny of others.
*Enhancing [[metacognition]] (learning to learn, and thinking about knowledge)
*Improving language ability
*Assessing learner understanding of learning objectives, concepts, and the relationship among those concepts
*Lexicon development

'''Critical-Creative Thinking and Behavioral Research Laboratory''' (ELYADAL) was founded in March 2002 as a branch in the Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences in [[Baskent University]], [[Ankara]], [[Turkey]]. Academicians and students in different disciplines like [[psychology]], [[social science]], [[philosophy of science]], [[scientific method]], [[political science]], [[business management]] and [[economics]] have convened to conduct [[scientific research]] and produce applications of science pertaining to [[human behavior]] as it is manifested in varying contexts. ELYADAL's perspective regarding scientific inquiry can be summarized as "disseminating the scientific knowledge accumulated by following curiosity through asking questions and answering them by means of scientific research."

ELYADAL has two branches to organize interests in two broad topics. The first branch is related to make research on, develop programs to train on, and to provide information about [[critical thinking]] and [[creative thinking]] for students, faculty members, and organizations. The second branch is organized around [[behavior]], its antecedents and consequences, and research conducted in an interdisciplinary fashion is welcomed.

==Brief history==
The process of establishment have started in March 2002. A core group of academicians have called for colleagues and students to participate in the new-founding laboratory. Following a number of meetings with the initial respondents, ELYADAL Research Group has started its activities on April 13, 2002. In order to test and form the interaction dynamics of the group, three subgroups have been established to work independently on three topics of interest. These topics were chosen so that no group member had previous in-depth knowledge or formal education about them, enabling equidistant amateurship in the beginning. The topics were the number '''[[Pi]]''' in mathematics, the microscopic organism '''[[Volvox]]''' colony in biology, and the '''[[black hole]]''' in physics. The studies of the groups were disseminated by a then-established popular scientific magazine named PiVOLKA (an anagram name including syllables from the three topics). Mini-group studies on natural scientific issues then become a one-step hurdle for the selection of prospective adjoiners and PiVOLKA became a source of dissemination and open forum to students and academicians in other universities as well.

The ongoing studies by members of ELYADAL include critical thinking, political and economical psychology research and publications, convention papers, the PiVOLKA peer-reviewed quarterly scholarly publication, a booklet about research methods-academic writing, a booklet about statistics, seminars and panels on various topics.

ELYADAL has 28 papers that are published in various journals, 33 papers that are presented in various seminars and conferences, 16 talks that are broadcast in media about [[psychology]], [[social psychology]], [[critical thinking]], [[creative thinking]], [[science]] against [[pseudoscience]], etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="107334">The '''deductive-nomological model''' ('''DN model'''), also known as '''[[Carl Gustav Hempel|Hempel]]'s model''', the '''Hempel–[[Paul Oppenheim|Oppenheim]] model''', the '''[[Karl Popper|Popper]]–Hempel model''', or the '''covering law model''', is a formal view of scientifically answering questions asking, "Why...?".  The DN model poses scientific explanation as a [[deductive inference|deductive]] structure—that is, one where truth of its premises entails truth of its conclusion—hinged on accurate prediction or [[postdiction]] of the phenomenon to be explained.

Because of problems concerning humans' ability to define, discover, and know [[causality]], it was omitted in initial formulations of the DN model. Causality was thought to be incidentally approximated by realistic selection of premises that ''derive'' the phenomenon of interest from observed starting conditions plus general [[scientific law|law]]s.  Still, DN model formally permitted causally irrelevant factors.  Also, derivability from observations and laws sometimes yielded absurd answers.

When [[logical empiricism]] fell out of favor in the 1960s, the DN model was widely seen as a flawed or greatly incomplete model of scientific explanation. Nonetheless, it  remained an idealized version of scientific explanation, and one that was rather accurate when applied to [[modern physics]].  In the early 1980s, revision to DN model emphasized ''maximal specificity'' for relevance of the conditions and [[axiom]]s stated.  Together with Hempel's [[inductive-statistical model]], the DN model forms scientific explanation's '''covering law model''', which is also termed, from critical angle, '''subsumption theory'''.

== Form ==

The term ''[[deductive inference|deductive]]'' distinguishes the DN model's intended [[determinism]] from the [[probabilism]] of [[inductive inference]]s.&lt;ref name=Woodward-DNmodel/&gt;  The term ''nomological'' is derived from the Greek word ''[[:wikt:νόμος|νόμος]]'' or ''nomos'', meaning "law".&lt;ref name=Woodward-DNmodel&gt;Woodward, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2011/entries/scientific-explanation "Scientific explanation"], §2 "The DN model", in ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|SEP]]'', 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The DN model holds to a view of scientific explanation whose ''conditions of adequacy'' (CA)—semiformal but stated classically—are ''derivability'' (CA1), ''lawlikeness'' (CA2), ''empirical content'' (CA3), and ''truth'' (CA4).&lt;ref name=Fetzer-p113&gt;James Fetzer, ch 3 "The paradoxes of Hempelian explanation", in Fetzer, ed, ''Science, Explanation, and Rationality'' (Oxford U P, 2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nvctcrj08wAC&amp;pg=PA113 p 113].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the DN model, a law [[axiom]]atizes an [[enumerative induction|unrestricted generalization]] from antecedent ''A'' to consequent ''B'' by [[conditional sentence|conditional proposition]]—''If A, then B''—and has empirical content testable.&lt;ref&gt;Montuschi, ''Objects in Social Science'' (Continuum, 2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=bQ24-BV8WSAC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq= pp 61–62].&lt;/ref&gt;  A law differs from mere true regularity—for instance, ''George always carries only $1 bills in his wallet''—by supporting [[counterfactual]] claims and thus suggesting what ''must'' be true,&lt;ref&gt;Bechtel, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Lawrence Erlbaum, 1988), [http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/research/philosophyofscience.html ch 2], subch "DN model of explanation and [[hypothetico-deductive model|HD model]] of theory development", pp 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt; while following from a scientific theory's axiomatic structure.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-axiomatic&gt;Bechtel, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Lawrence Erlbaum, 1988), [http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/research/philosophyofscience.html ch 2], subch "Axiomatic account of theories", pp 27–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon to be explained is the '''''explanandum'''''—an event, [[scientific law|law]], or [[scientific theory|theory]]—whereas the [[premise]]s to explain it are '''''explanans''''', true or highly confirmed, containing at least one universal law, and entailing the explanandum.&lt;ref name=Suppe&gt;Suppe, "Afterword—1977", "Introduction", §1 "Swan song for positivism", §1A "Explanation and intertheoretical reduction", [https://books.google.com/books?id=SpvZsxCA0TIC&amp;pg=PA619 pp 619–24], in Suppe, ed, [https://books.google.com/books?id=SpvZsxCA0TIC ''Structure of Scientific Theories'', 2nd edn] (U Illinois P, 1977).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shaffner/&gt;  Thus, given the explanans as initial, specific conditions ''C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; . . . C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' plus general laws ''L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; . . .

[[Aristotle]]'s scientific explanation in ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' resembles the DN model, an idealized form of scientific explanation.&lt;ref name=Shaffner&gt;Kenneth F Schaffner, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hQ-z5oriurYC&amp;pg=PA79 "Explanation and causation in biomedical sciences"], pp 79–125, in Laudan, ed, ''Mind and Medicine'' (U California P, 1983), [https://books.google.com/books?id=hQ-z5oriurYC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq= p 81].&lt;/ref&gt;  The framework of [[Aristotelian physics]]—[[Aristotelian metaphysics]]—reflected the perspective of this principally biologist, who, amid living entities' undeniable purposiveness, formalized [[vitalism]] and [[teleology]], an intrinsic [[ethics|morality]] in nature.&lt;ref name=Montalenti&gt;G Montalenti, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NMAf65cDmAQC&amp;pg=PA3 ch 2 "From Aristotle to Democritus via Darwin"], in Ayala &amp; Dobzhansky, eds, ''Studies in the Philosophy of Biology'' (U California P, 1974).&lt;/ref&gt;  With emergence of [[Copernicanism]], however, [[René Descartes|Descartes]] introduced [[mechanical philosophy]], then [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] rigorously posed lawlike explanation, both Descartes and especially Newton shunning teleology within [[natural philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;In the 17th century, Descartes as well as [[Isaac Newton]] firmly believed in God as nature's designer and thereby firmly believed in natural purposiveness, yet found [[teleology]] to be [[problem of demarcation|outside]] [[natural philosophy|science]]'s inquiry (Bolotin, ''Approach to Aristotle's Physics'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=LLqB1IfeSZ0C&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq= pp 31–33]).  By 1650, formalizing [[heliocentrism]] and launching [[mechanical philosophy]], [[Cartesian physics]] overthrew geocentrism as well as Aristotelian physics.  In the 1660s, [[Robert Boyle]] sought to lift chemistry as a new discipline from alchemy.  Newton more especially sought the laws of nature—simply the regularities of phenomena—whereby [[Newtonian physics]], reducing celestial science to terrestrial science, ejected from physics the vestige of Aristotelian metaphysics, thus disconnecting physics and alchemy/chemistry, which then followed its own course, yielding chemistry around 1800.&lt;/ref&gt;  At 1740, [[David Hume]]&lt;ref&gt;Nicknames for principles attributed to Hume—[[Hume's fork]], [[problem of induction]], [[Hume's law]]—were not created by Hume but by later philosophers labeling them for ease of reference.&lt;/ref&gt; staked [[Hume's fork]],&lt;ref&gt;By Hume's fork, the truths of mathematics and logic as [[formal sciences]] are universal through "relations of ideas"—simply abstract truths—thus knowable [[a priori knowledge|without experience]].  On the other hand, the claimed truths of [[empirical science]]s are [[contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] on "fact and real existence", knowable only [[a posteriori|upon experience]].  By Hume's fork, the two categories never cross.  Any treatises containing neither can contain only "sophistry and illusion".  (Flew, ''Dictionary'', "Hume's fork", [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;dq= p 156]).&lt;/ref&gt; highlighted the [[problem of induction]],&lt;ref&gt;Not privy to the world's either necessities or impossibilities, but by force of habit or mental nature, humans experience sequence of sensory events, find seeming [[constant conjunction]], make the unrestricted generalization of an [[enumerative induction]], and justify it by presuming [[uniformitarianism|uniformity of nature]].  Humans thus attempt to justify a minor induction by adding a major induction, both logically invalid and unverified by experience—the [[problem of induction]]—how humans irrationally presume discovery of causality.  (Chakraborti, ''Logic'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y2u8C_ur8VIC&amp;pg=PA381&amp;dq=uniformity+of+nature+problem+of+induction p 381]; Flew, ''Dictionary'', "Hume", [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;dq= p 156].&lt;/ref&gt; and found humans ignorant of either necessary or sufficient causality.&lt;ref&gt;For more discursive discussions of types of causality—necessary, sufficient, necessary and sufficient, component, sufficient component, [[counterfactual]]—see Rothman &amp; Greenland, Parascandola &amp; Weed, as well as Kundi.  Following is more direct elucidation:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A ''necessary cause'' is a causal condition ''required'' for an event to occur.  A ''sufficient cause'' is a causal condition ''complete'' to produce an event.  Necessary is not always sufficient, however, since other casual factors—that is, other ''component causes''—might be required to produce the event.  Conversely, a sufficient cause is not always a necessary cause, since differing sufficient causes might likewise produce the event.  Strictly speaking, a sufficient cause cannot be a single factor, as any causal factor must act casually through many other factors.  And although a necessary cause might exist, humans cannot verify one, since humans cannot check every possible state of affairs.  (Language can state necessary causality as a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]]—a statement whose terms' [[syntax|arrangement]] and [[semantics|meanings]] render it is logically true by mere definition—which, as an [[analytic-synthetic distinction|''analytic'' statement]], is uninformative about the actual world.  A statement referring to and contingent on the world's actualities is a [[analytic-synthetic distinction|''synthetic'' statement]], rather.)
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Sufficient causality is more actually ''sufficient component causality''—a complete set of component causes interacting within a causal constellation—which, however, is beyond humans' capacity to fully discover.  Yet humans tend intuitively to conceive of causality as ''necessary and sufficient''—a single factor both required and complete—the one and only cause, ''the'' cause.  One may so view flipping a light switch.  The switch's flip was not sufficient cause, however, but contingent on countless factors—intact bulb, intact wiring, circuit box, bill payment, utility company, neighborhood infrastructure, engineering of technology by [[Thomas Edison]] and [[Nikola Tesla]], explanation of electricity by [[James Clerk Maxwell]], harnessing of electricity by [[Benjamin Franklin]], metal refining, metal mining, and on and on—while, whatever the tally of events, nature's causal mechanical structure remains a mystery.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
From a [[David Hume|Humean]] perspective, the light's putative inability to come on without the switch's flip is neither a logical necessity nor an empirical finding, since no experience ever reveals that the world either is or will remain universally uniform as to the aspects appearing to bind the switch's flip as the necessary event for the light's coming on.  If the light comes on without switch flip, surprise will affect one's ''mind'', but one's mind cannot know that the event violated ''nature''.  As just a mundane possibility, an activity within the wall could have connected the wires and completed the circuit without the switch's flip.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Though apparently enjoying the scandals that trailed his own explanations, Hume was very practical and his skepticism was quite uneven (Flew [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;dq=induction+scandal+sceptical+common+sense+logical+natural p 156]).  Although Hume rejected orthodox theism and sought to reject [[metaphysics]], Hume supposedly extended Newtonian method to the human mind, which Hume, in a sort of antiCopernican move, placed as the pivot of human knowledge (Flew [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA154&amp;dq=anti-Copernican p 154]).  Hume thus placed his own [[epistemology|theory of knowledge]] on par with [[Newton's theory|Newton's theory of motion]] (Buckle [https://books.google.com/books?id=jiq14nexzu0C&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=Hume's+Newton+crowning#v=twopage pp 70–71], Redman [https://books.google.com/books?id=1faeMedY8k8C&amp;pg=PA182&amp;dq=theism+moral+causal+induction#v=twopage pp 182–83], Schliesser [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2008/entries/hume-newton § abstract]).  Hume found [[enumerative induction]] an unavoidable custom required for one to live (Gattei [https://books.google.com/books?id=oPPu1JvMBFoC&amp;pg=PA28#v=twopage pp 28–29]).  Hume found [[constant conjunction]] to reveal a modest causality type: ''[[counterfactual]] causality''.  Silent as to causal role—whether necessity, sufficiency, component strength, or mechanism—counterfactual causality is simply that alteration of a factor prevents or produces the event of interest.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kundi/&gt;  Hume also highlighted the [[Hume's law|fact/value gap]], as what ''is'' does not itself reveal what ''ought''.&lt;ref&gt;Hume noted that authors ubiquitously continue for some time stating facts and then suddenly switch to stating [[normative|norms]]—supposedly what should be—with barely explanation.  Yet such values, as in [[ethics]] or [[aesthetics]] or [[political philosophy]], are not found true merely by stating facts: ''is'' does not itself reveal ''ought''.  Hume's law is the principle that the fact/value gap is unbridgeable—that no statements of facts can ever justify norms—although Hume himself did not state that.  Rather, some later philosophers found Hume to merely stop short of stating it, but to have communicated it.  Anyway, Hume found that humans acquired morality through experience by [[communal reinforcement]].  (Flew, ''Dictionary'', "Hume's law", [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA157&amp;dq=Hume's+law p 157] &amp; "Naturalistic fallacy", [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA240&amp;dq=naturalistic+fallacy#v=twopage pp 240–41]; Wootton, ''Modern Political Thought'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=78eaIfCg2mcC&amp;pg=PA306&amp;dq=Hume+communal+reinforcement p 306].)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Critique of Pure Reason|Near 1780]], countering Hume's ostensibly radical [[empiricism]], [[Immanuel Kant]] highlighted extreme [[rationalism]]—as by [[Descartes]] or [[Spinoza]]—and sought middle ground.  Inferring the mind to arrange experience of the world into ''substance'', ''space'', and ''time'', Kant placed the mind as part of the causal constellation of experience and thereby found [[Newton's theory|Newton's theory of motion]] universally true,&lt;ref&gt;
Kant inferred that the [[category (Kant)|mind's constants]] arrange space holding [[Euclidean geometry]]—like Newton's [[absolute space]]—while objects interact temporally as modeled in [[Newton's theory|Newton's theory of motion]], whose [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|law of universal gravitation]] is a truth ''[[synthetic a priori]]'', that is, contingent on experience, indeed, but known universally true without universal experience.  Thus, the [[category (Kant)|mind's innate constants]] [[synthetic a priori|cross the tongs]] of [[Hume's fork]] and lay Newton's [[universal gravitation]] as ''[[a priori knowledge|a priori]]'' truth.&lt;/ref&gt; yet knowledge of [[ding-an-sich|things in themselves]] impossible.&lt;ref name=Kundi/&gt;  Safeguarding [[natural philosophy|science]], then, Kant paradoxically stripped it of [[scientific realism]].&lt;ref name=Kundi/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chakravartty/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bolotin-realism/&gt;  Aborting [[Francis Bacon]]'s [[inductivist]] mission to dissolve the veil of appearance to uncover the ''[[noumena]]''—[[metaphysics|metaphysical]] view of nature's [[essentialism|ultimate truths]]—Kant's [[transcendental idealism]] tasked science with simply modeling patterns of ''[[phenomena]]''.  Safeguarding metaphysics, too, it found the [[category (Kant)|mind's constant]]s holding also [[categorical imperative|universal moral truths]],&lt;ref&gt;Whereas a [[hypothetical imperative]] is practical, simply what one ought to do if one seeks a particular outcome, the [[categorical imperative]] is morally universal, what everyone always ought to do.&lt;/ref&gt; and launched [[German idealism]], increasingly speculative.

[[Auguste Comte]] found the [[problem of induction]] rather irrelevant since [[enumerative induction]] is grounded on the empiricism available, while science's point is not metaphysical truth.  Comte found human knowledge had evolved from theological to metaphysical to scientific—the ultimate stage—rejecting both theology and metaphysics as asking questions unanswerable and posing answers unverifiable.  Comte in the 1830s expounded [[positivism]]—the first modern [[philosophy of science]] and simultaneously a [[political philosophy]]&lt;ref name=Bourdeau&gt;Bourdeau, "Auguste Comte", §§ "Abstract" &amp; [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/comte/#Int "Introduction"], in Zalta, ed, ''SEP'', 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;—rejecting conjectures about [[unobservable]]s, thus rejecting search for ''causes''.&lt;ref&gt;Comte, ''A General View of Positivism'' (Trübner, 1865), [https://books.google.com/books?id=59hUAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=atheism+repudiated+causes+laws pp 49–50], including the following passage: "As long as men persist in attempting to answer the insoluble questions which occupied the attention of the childhood of our race, by far the more rational plan is to do as was done then, that is, simply to give free play to the imagination.  These spontaneous beliefs have gradually fallen into disuse, not because they have been disproved, but because humankind has become more enlightened as to its wants and the scope of its powers, and has gradually given an entirely new direction to its speculative efforts".&lt;/ref&gt;  Positivism predicts observations, confirms the predictions, and states a ''law'', thereupon [[applied science|applied]] to benefit human society.&lt;ref&gt;Flew, ''Dictionary'' (St Martin's, 1984), "Positivism", [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA283&amp;dq=positivism+prediction p 283].&lt;/ref&gt;  From late 19th century into the early 20th century, the influence of positivism spanned the globe.&lt;ref name=Bourdeau/&gt;  Meanwhile, evolutionary theory's [[natural selection]] brought the [[Copernican Revolution]] into biology and eventuated in the first conceptual alternative to [[vitalism]] and [[teleology]].&lt;ref name=Montalenti/&gt;

==Growth==

Whereas Comtean positivism posed science as ''description'', [[logical positivism]] emerged in the late 1920s and posed science as ''explanation'', perhaps to better [[unity of science|unify empirical sciences]] by covering not only [[fundamental science]]—that is, [[fundamental interactions|fundamental physics]]—but [[special science]]s, too, such as biology, psychology, economics, and [[anthropology]].&lt;ref name=Woodward-Background&gt;Woodward, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2011/entries/scientific-explanation "Scientific explanation"], §1 "Background and introduction", in ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|SEP]]'', 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  After defeat of [[National Socialism]] with World War II's close in 1945, logical positivism shifted to a milder variant, ''logical empiricism''.&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxii&gt;Friedman, ''Reconsidering Logical Positivism'' (Cambridge U P, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=e9TjZc9wNUAC&amp;pg=PR12 p xii].&lt;/ref&gt;  All variants of the movement, which lasted until 1965, are neopositivism,&lt;ref&gt;Any ''positivism'' placed in the 20th century is generally ''neo'', although there was [[Ernst Mach]]'s positivism nearing 1900, and a general positivistic approach to science—traceable to the [[inductivist]] trend from [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]] at 1620, the [[Isaac Newton|Newtonian]] [[research program]] at 1687, and [[Auguste Comte|Comptean]] positivism at 1830—that continues in a vague but usually disavowed sense within popular culture and some sciences.&lt;/ref&gt; sharing the quest of [[verificationism]].&lt;ref&gt;Neopositivists are sometimes called "verificationists".&lt;/ref&gt;

Neopositivists led emergence of the philosophy subdiscipline [[philosophy of science]], researching such questions and aspects of scientific theory and knowledge.&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxii/&gt;  [[Scientific realism]] takes scientific theory's statements at [[face value]], thus accorded either falsity or truth—probable or approximate or actual.&lt;ref name=Chakravartty&gt;Chakravartty, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2013/entries/scientific-realism "Scientific realism"], §1.2 "The three dimensions of realist commitment", in ''SEP'', 2013: "Semantically, realism is committed to a literal interpretation of scientific claims about the world.  In common parlance, realists take theoretical statements at 'face value'.  According to realism, claims about scientific entities, processes, properties, and relations, whether they be observable or unobservable, should be construed literally as having truth values, whether true or false.  This semantic commitment contrasts primarily with those of so-called instrumentalist epistemologies of science, which interpret descriptions of unobservables simply as instruments for the prediction of observable phenomena, or for systematizing observation reports.  Traditionally, instrumentalism holds that claims about unobservable things have no literal meaning at all (though the term is often used more liberally in connection with some antirealist positions today).  Some antirealists contend that claims involving unobservables should not be interpreted literally, but as elliptical for corresponding claims about observables".&lt;/ref&gt;  Neopositivists held scientific antirealism as [[instrumentalism]], holding scientific theory as simply a device to predict observations and their course, while statements on nature's unobservable aspects are elliptical at or metaphorical of its observable aspects, rather.&lt;ref name=Chakravartty-Okasha&gt;
*Chakravartty, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2013/entries/scientific-realism "Scientific realism"], §4 "Antirealism: Foils for scientific realism", §4.1 "Empiricism", in ''SEP'', 2013: "Traditionally, [[instrumentalism|instrumentalist]]s maintain that terms for unobservables, by themselves, have no meaning; construed literally, statements involving them are not even candidates for truth or falsity.  The most influential advocates of [[instrumentalism]] were the [[logical empiricist]]s (or logical positivists), including [[Rudolf Carnap|Carnap]] and [[Carl Hempel|Hempel]], famously associated with the [[Vienna Circle]] group of philosophers and scientists as well as important contributors elsewhere.  In order to rationalize the ubiquitous use of terms which might otherwise be taken to refer to unobservables in scientific discourse, they adopted a non-literal [[semantics]] according to which these terms acquire meaning by being associated with terms for observables (for example, '[[electron]]' might mean 'white streak in a [[cloud chamber]]'), or with demonstrable laboratory procedures (a view called '[[operationalism]]').  Insuperable difficulties with this semantics led ultimately (in large measure) to the demise of [[logical empiricism]] and the growth of [[scientific realism|realism]].  The contrast here is not merely in [[semantics]] and [[epistemology]]: a number of logical empiricists also held the [[neo-Kantian]] view that [[ontological]] questions 'external' to the frameworks for knowledge represented by theories are also meaningless (the choice of a framework is made solely on [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] grounds), thereby rejecting the [[metaphysical]] dimension of [[scientific realism|realism]] (as in Carnap 1950)".
*Okasha, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Oxford U P, 2002), [https://books.google.com/books?id=W2jCrzKYqxMC&amp;pg=PA62 p 62]: "Strictly we should distinguish two sorts of anti-realism.  According to the first sort, talk of unobservable entities is not to be understood literally at all.  So when a scientist pus forward a theory about electrons, for example, we should not take him to be asserting the existence of entities called 'electrons'.  Rather, his talk of electrons is metaphorical.  This form of anti-realism was popular in the first half of the 20th century, but few people advocate it today.  It was motivated largely by a doctrine in the philosophy of language, according to which it is not possible to make meaningful assertions about things that cannot in principle be observed, a doctrine that few contemporary philosophers accept.  The second sort of anti-realism accepts that talk of unobservable entities should be taken at face value: if a theory says that electrons are negatively charged, it is true if electrons do exist and are negatively charged, but false otherwise.  But we will never know which, says the anti-realist.  So the correct attitude towards the claims that scientists make about unobservable reality is one of total agnosticism.  They are either true or false, but we are incapable of finding out which.  Most modern anti-realism is of this second sort".&lt;/ref&gt;

DN model received its most detailed, influential statement by [[Carl Gustav Hempel|Carl G Hempel]], first in his 1942 article "The function of general laws in history", and more explicitly with [[Paul Oppenheim]] in their 1948 article "Studies in the logic of explanation".&lt;ref name=Woodward-introduction/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carl G Hempel &amp; Paul Oppenheim, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/185169 "Studies in the logic of explanation"], ''Philosophy of Science'', 1948 Apr; '''15'''(2):135–175.&lt;/ref&gt;  Leading logical empiricist, Hempel embraced the [[David Hume|Humean]] empiricist view that humans observe sequence of sensory events, not cause and effect,&lt;ref name=Woodward-Background/&gt; as causal relations and casual mechanisms are unobservables.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-mechanism/&gt;  DN model bypasses causality beyond mere [[constant conjunction]]: first an event like ''A'', then always an event like ''B''.&lt;ref name=Woodward-Background/&gt;

Hempel held [[natural laws]]—empirically confirmed regularities—as satisfactory, and if included realistically to approximate causality.&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt;  In later articles, Hempel defended DN model and proposed probabilistic explanation by ''[[inductive-statistical model]]'' (IS model).&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt;  DN model and IS model—whereby the probability must be high, such as at least 50%&lt;ref name=Woodward-ISmodel/&gt;—together form ''covering law model'',&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt; as named by a critic, [[William Dray]].&lt;ref&gt;von Wright, ''Explanation and Understanding'' (Cornell U P, 1971), [https://books.google.com/books?id=33wCi2bg5x0C&amp;pg=PA11 p 11].&lt;/ref&gt;  Derivation of statistical laws from other statistical laws goes to the ''[[deductive-statistical model]]'' (DS model).&lt;ref name=Woodward-ISmodel&gt;Woodward, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2011/entries/scientific-explanation "Scientific explanation"], §2 "The DN model", §2.3 "Inductive statistical explanation", in Zalta, ed, ''SEP'', 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Glennan&gt;Stuart Glennan, "Explanation", § "Covering-law model of explanation", in Sarkar &amp; Pfeifer, eds, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Routledge, 2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=od68ge7aF6wC&amp;pg=PA276&amp;dq= p 276].&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Georg Henrik von Wright]], another critic, named the totality ''subsumption theory''.&lt;ref name=Riedel&gt;Manfred Riedel, "Causal and historical explanation", in Manninen &amp; Tuomela, eds, ''Essays on Explanation and Understanding'' (D Reidel, 1976), [https://books.google.com/books?id=It3ji_AuO3sC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=Covering+subsumption pp 3–4].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline==

Amid failure of [[neopositivism]]'s fundamental tenets,&lt;ref&gt;
Neopositivism's fundamental tenets were the verifiability criterion of ''cognitive meaningfulness'', the [[analytic-synthetic distinction|analytic/synthetic gap]], and the observation/theory gap.  From 1950 to 1951, Carl Gustav Hempel renounced the verifiability criterion.  In 1951 [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] attacked the analytic/synthetic gap.  In 1958, [[Norwood Russell Hanson]] blurred the observational/theoretical gap.  In 1959, [[Karl Raimund Popper]] attacked all of verificationism—he attacked, actually, any type of positivism—by asserting falsificationism.  In 1962, [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn]] overthrew [[foundationalism]], which was erroneously presumed to be a fundamental tenet of neopositivism.
&lt;/ref&gt; Hempel in 1965 abandoned verificationism, signaling neopositivism's demise.&lt;ref name=Fetzer-reFall&gt;
Fetzer, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2013/entries/hempel "Carl Hempel"], §3 "Scientific reasoning", in ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|SEP]]'', 2013: "The need to dismantle the verifiability criterion of meaningfulness together with the demise of the observational/theoretical distinction meant that logical positivism no longer represented a rationally defensible position.  At least two of its defining tenets had been shown to be without merit.  Since most philosophers believed that Quine had shown the analytic/synthetic distinction was also untenable, moreover, many concluded that the enterprise had been a total failure.  Among the important benefits of Hempel's critique, however, was the production of more general and flexible criteria of ''cognitive significance'' in Hempel (1965b), included in a famous collection of his studies, ''Aspects of Scientific Explanation'' (1965d).  There he proposed that ''cognitive significance'' could not be adequately captured by means of principles of verification or falsification, whose defects were parallel, but instead required a far more subtle and nuanced approach.

Hempel suggested multiple criteria for assessing the ''cognitive significance'' of different theoretical systems, where significance is not categorical but rather a matter of degree: 'Significant systems range from those whose entire extralogical vocabulary consists of observation terms, through theories whose formulation relies heavily on theoretical constructs, on to systems with hardly any bearing on potential empirical findings' (Hempel 1965b: 117).  The criteria Hempel offered for evaluating the 'degrees of significance' of theoretical systems (as conjunctions of hypotheses, definitions, and auxiliary claims) were (a) the clarity and precision with which they are formulated, including explicit connections to observational language; (b) the systematic—explanatory and predictive—power of such a system, in relation to observable phenomena; (c) the formal simplicity of the systems with which a certain degree of systematic power is attained; and (d) the extent to which those systems have been confirmed by experimental evidence (Hempel 1965b).  The elegance of Hempel's study laid to rest any lingering aspirations for simple criteria of 'cognitive significance' and signaled the demise of logical positivism as a philosophical movement".
&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1930 onward, Karl Popper had refuted any positivism by asserting [[falsificationism]], which Popper claimed had killed positivism, although, paradoxically, Popper was commonly mistaken for a positivist.&lt;ref name=Popper&gt;Popper, "Against big words", ''In Search of a Better World'' (Routledge, 1996), [https://books.google.com/books?id=L33XSZE77OkC&amp;pg=PA89#v=twopage pp 89-90].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hachoben&gt;Hacohen, ''Karl Popper: The Formative Years'' (Cambridge U P, 2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=3VtHcYGp2pIC&amp;pg=PA212&amp;dq=Habermas+broad+Popper+killed+logical+positivism#v=twopage pp 212–13].&lt;/ref&gt;  Even Popper's 1934 book&lt;ref&gt;''[[Logik der Forschung]]'', published in Austria in 1934, was translated by Popper from German to English, ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'', and arrived in the [[English-speaking world]] in 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; embraces DN model,&lt;ref name=Shaffner/&gt;&lt;ref name=Woodward-introduction&gt;Woodward, "Scientific explanation", in Zalta, ed, ''SEP'', 2011, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2011/entries/scientific-explanation abstract].&lt;/ref&gt; widely accepted as the model of scientific explanation for as long as physics remained the model of science examined by philosophers of science.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-mechanism/&gt;&lt;ref name=cplaws/&gt;

In the 1940s, filling the vast observational gap between cytology&lt;ref&gt;As scientific study of cells, cytology emerged in the 19th century, yet its technology and methods were insufficient to clearly visualize and establish existence of any cell [[organelle]]s beyond the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[biochemistry]],&lt;ref&gt;The first famed biochemistry experiment was [[Edward Buchner]]'s in 1897 (Morange, ''A History'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qe93vz5ZLVsC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq= p 11]).  The biochemistry discipline soon emerged, initially investigating [[colloid]]s in biological systems, a "biocolloidology" (Morange [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qe93vz5ZLVsC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq= p 12]; Bechtel, ''Discovering'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=WrEquK3hoDwC&amp;pg=PA94&amp;dq=biocolloidology+colloids+exemplifies+organic+proteins p 94]).  This yielded to macromolecular theory, the term ''macromolecule'' introduced by German chemist [[Hermann Staudinger]] in 1922 (Morange [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qe93vz5ZLVsC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq= p 12]).&lt;/ref&gt; [[cell biology]] arose&lt;ref&gt;Cell biology emerged principally at [[Rockefeller University|Rockefeller Institute]] through new technology ([[electron microscope]] and [[ultracentrifuge]]) and new techniques ([[cell fractionation]] and advancements in staining and fixation).&lt;/ref&gt; and established existence of cell [[organelle]]s besides the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]].  Launched in the late 1930s, the [[molecular biology]] [[research program]] cracked a [[genetic code]] in the early 1960s and then converged with cell biology as ''cell and molecular biology'', its breakthroughs and discoveries defying DN model by arriving in quest not of lawlike explanation but of causal mechanisms.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-mechanism&gt;Bechtel, ''Discovering Cell Mechanisms'' (Cambridge U P, 2006), esp [https://books.google.com/books?id=WrEquK3hoDwC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=empiricists+Salmon#v=twopage pp 24–25].&lt;/ref&gt;  Biology became a new model of science, while [[special sciences]] were no longer thought defective by lacking universal laws, as borne by physics.&lt;ref name=cplaws/&gt;

In 1948, when explicating DN model and stating scientific explanation's semiformal ''conditions of adequacy'', [[Carl Hempel|Hempel]] and [[Paul Oppenheim|Oppenheim]] acknowledged redundancy of the third, ''[[empiricism|empirical content]]'', implied by the other three—''derivability'', ''lawlikeness'', and ''truth''.&lt;ref name=Fetzer-p113/&gt;  In the early 1980s, upon widespread view that causality ensures the explanans' relevance, [[Wesley Salmon]] called for returning ''cause'' to ''because'',&lt;ref&gt;James Fetzer, ch 3 "The paradoxes of Hempelian explanation", in Fetzer J, ed, ''Science, Explanation, and Rationality'' (Oxford U P, 2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nvctcrj08wAC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;dq=causality pp 121–122].&lt;/ref&gt; and along with [[James H. Fetzer|James Fetzer]] helped replace CA3 ''empirical content'' with CA3' ''strict maximal specificity''.&lt;ref&gt;Fetzer, ch 3 in Fetzer, ed, ''Science, Explanation, and Rationality'' (Oxford U P, 2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nvctcrj08wAC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=better p 129].&lt;/ref&gt;

Salmon introduced ''causal mechanical'' explanation, never clarifying how it proceeds, yet reviving philosophers' interest in such.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-mechanism/&gt;  Via shortcomings of Hempel's inductive-statistical model (IS model), Salmon introduced ''[[statistical-relevance model]]'' (SR model).&lt;ref name=Shaffner/&gt;  Although DN model remained an idealized form of scientific explanation, especially in [[applied science]]s,&lt;ref name=Shaffner/&gt; most philosophers of science consider DN model flawed by excluding many types of explanations generally accepted as scientific.&lt;ref name=Glennan/&gt;

==Strengths==

As theory of knowledge, [[epistemology]] differs from [[ontology]], which is a subbranch of [[metaphysics]], theory of reality.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-metaphysics-epistemology/&gt;  Ontology poses which categories of being—what sorts of things exist—and so, although a scientific theory's ontological commitment can be modified in light of experience, an ontological commitment inevitably precedes empirical inquiry.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-metaphysics-epistemology&gt;Bechtel, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Lawrence Erlbaum, 1988), [http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/research/philosophyofscience.html ch 1], subch "Areas of philosophy that bear on philosophy of science", § "Metaphysics", pp 8–9, § "Epistemology", p 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Natural law]]s, so called, are statements of humans' observations, thus are epistemological—concerning human knowledge—the ''[[epistemic]]''.  Causal mechanisms and structures existing putatively independently of minds exist, or would exist, in the natural world's structure itself, and thus are ontological, the ''[[ontic]]''. Blurring epistemic with ontic—as by incautiously presuming a natural law to refer to a causal mechanism, or to trace structures realistically during unobserved transitions, or to be true regularities always unvarying—tends to generate a ''[[category mistake]]''.&lt;ref&gt;H Atmanspacher, R C Bishop &amp; A Amann, "Extrinsic and intrinsic irreversibility in probabilistic dynamical laws", in Khrennikov, ed, ''Proceedings'' (World Scientific, 2001), [https://books.google.com/books?id=9B6b5WKuNWwC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=ontic+epistemic+general pp 51–52].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fetzer, ch 3, in Fetzer, ed, ''Science, Explanation, and Rationality'' (Oxford U P, 2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nvctcrj08wAC&amp;pg=PA118 p 118], poses some possible ways that natural laws, so called, when [[epistemic]] can fail as [[ontic]]: "The underlying conception is that of bringing order to our ''knowledge'' of the universe.  Yet there are at least three reasons why even complete knowledge of every empirical regularity that obtains during the world's history might not afford an adequate inferential foundation for discovery of the world's laws.  First, some laws might remain uninstantiated and therefore not be displayed by any regularity.  Second, some regularities may be accidental and therefore not display any law of nature.  And, third, in the case of probabilistic laws, some frequencies might deviate from their generating nomic probabilities 'by chance' and therefore display natural laws in ways that are unrepresentative or biased".&lt;/ref&gt;

Discarding ontic commitments, including causality ''per se'', DN model permits a theory's laws to be reduced to—that is, subsumed by—a more fundamental theory's laws.  The higher theory's laws are explained in DN model by the lower theory's laws.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-axiomatic/&gt;&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt;  Thus, the epistemic success of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]ian theory's [[law of universal gravitation]] is reduced to—thus explained by—[[Einstein]]'s [[general theory of relativity]], although Einstein's discards Newton's ontic claim that universal gravitation's epistemic success predicting [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]]&lt;ref&gt;This theory reduction occurs if, and apparently only if, the Sun and one planet are modeled as a two-body system, excluding all other planets (Torretti, ''Philosophy of Physics'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=P60&amp;dq= pp 60–62]).&lt;/ref&gt; is through a causal mechanism of a straightly attractive force instantly traversing [[absolute space]] despite [[absolute time]].

Covering law model reflects [[neopositivism]]'s vision of [[empirical science]], a vision interpreting or presuming [[unity of science]], whereby all empirical sciences are either [[fundamental science]]—that is, [[fundamental interactions|fundamental physics]]—or are [[special sciences]], whether [[astrophysics]], chemistry, biology, [[geology]], psychology, economics, and so on.&lt;ref name=cplaws&gt;Reutlinger, Schurz &amp; Hüttemann, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2011/entries/ceteris-paribus "Ceteris paribus"], § 1.1 "Systematic introduction", in Zalta, ed, ''SEP'', 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spohn, ''Laws of Belief'' (Oxford U P, 2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=MSXrFBvIZIUC&amp;pg=PA305&amp;dq=fundamental+special+sciences p 305].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whereas fundamental physics has sought [[scientific law|law]]s of [[determinism|universal regularity]], special sciences normally include ''[[ceteris paribus]]'' laws, which are predictively accurate to high [[probability]] in "normal conditions" or with "all else equal", but have exceptions [Reutlinger ''et al'' § 1.1].  Chemistry's laws seem [[deterministic|exceptionless]] in their domains, yet were in principle reduced to fundamental physics [Feynman [https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=chemistry p 5], Schwarz [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9501161 Fig 1], and so are special sciences.&lt;/ref&gt;  All special sciences would network via covering law model.&lt;ref&gt;Bechtel, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Lawrence Erlbaum, 1988), ch 5, subch "Introduction: Relating disciplines by relating theories" pp 71–72.&lt;/ref&gt;  And by stating ''boundary conditions'' while supplying ''bridge laws'', any special law would reduce to a lower special law, ultimately reducing—theoretically although generally not practically—to fundamental science.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-TheoryReduction&gt;Bechtel, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Lawrence Erlbaum, 1988), ch 5, subch "Theory reduction model and the [[unity of science]] program" pp 72–76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bem-Long/&gt;  (''Boundary conditions'' are specified conditions whereby the phenomena of interest occur.  ''Bridge laws'' translate terms in one science to terms in another science.)&lt;ref name=Bechtel-TheoryReduction/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bem-Long&gt;Bem &amp; de Jong, ''Theoretical Issues'' (Sage, 2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=DgDGJi2F2vsC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;dq=deductive-nomological+boundary+conditions+bridge+laws pp 45–47].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weaknesses==

By DN model, if one asks, "Why is that shadow 20 feet long?", another can answer, "Because that flagpole is 15 feet tall, the Sun is at ''x'' angle, and laws of [[electromagnetism]]".&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt;  Yet by problem of symmetry, if one instead asked, "Why is that flagpole 15 feet tall?", another could answer, "Because that shadow is 20 feet long, the Sun is at ''x'' angle, and laws of electromagnetism", likewise a deduction from observed conditions and scientific laws, but an answer clearly incorrect.&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt;  By the problem of irrelevance, if one asks, "Why did that man not get pregnant?", one could in part answer, among the explanans, "Because he took birth control pills"—if he factually took them, and the law of their preventing pregnancy—as covering law model poses no restriction to bar that observation from the explanans.

Many [[philosophy of science|philosophers]] have concluded that causality is integral to scientific explanation.&lt;ref name=OShaughnessy&gt;O'Shaughnessy, ''Explaining Buyer Behavior'' (Oxford U P, 1992), [https://books.google.com/books?id=magj7kNrbpsC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq= pp 17–19].&lt;/ref&gt;  DN model offers a necessary condition of a causal explanation—successful prediction—but not sufficient conditions of causal explanation, as a universal regularity can include spurious relations or simple correlations, for instance ''Z'' always following ''Y'', but not ''Z'' because of ''Y'', instead ''Y'' and then ''Z'' as an effect of ''X''.&lt;ref name=OShaughnessy/&gt;  By relating temperature, pressure, and volume of gas within a container, [[Boyle's law]] permits prediction of an unknown variable—volume, pressure, or temperature—but does not explain ''why'' to expect that unless one adds, perhaps, the [[kinetic theory of gases]].&lt;ref name=OShaughnessy/&gt;&lt;ref name=Spohn-idealgas/&gt;

Scientific explanations increasingly pose not [[determinism]]'s universal laws, but [[probabilism]]'s chance,&lt;ref name=Karhausen/&gt; ''[[ceteris paribus]]'' laws.&lt;ref name=cplaws/&gt;  Smoking's contribution to [[lung cancer]] fails even the inductive-statistical model (IS model), requiring probability over 0.5 (50%).&lt;ref&gt;Bechtel, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Lawrence Erlbaum, 1988), [http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/research/philosophyofscience.html ch 3], subch "Repudiation of DN model of explanation", pp 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt;  (Probability standardly ranges from 0 (0%) to 1 (100%).)  An [[applied science]] that applies [[statistics]] seeking associations between events, [[epidemiology]] cannot show causality, but consistently found higher incidence of lung cancer in smokers versus otherwise similar nonsmokers, although the proportion of smokers who develop lung cancer is modest.&lt;ref name=Rothman-Greenland&gt;{{Cite journal

==Covering action==

Through lawlike explanation, [[fundamental interactions|fundamental physics]]—often perceived as [[fundamental science]]—has proceeded through intertheory relation and theory reduction, thereby resolving experimental [[paradox]]es to great historical success,&lt;ref name=Schwarz&gt;Schwarz, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9501161 "Recent developments in string theory"], ''Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A'', 1998; '''95''':2750–7, esp [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC19640/figure/F1 Fig 1].&lt;/ref&gt; resembling covering law model.&lt;ref name=Ben-Menahem&gt;Ben-Menahem, ''Conventionalism'' (Cambridge U P, 2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=bgRA2LOjcMAC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=mechanical+deductive-nomological+model+ether p 71].&lt;/ref&gt;  In early 20th century, [[Ernst Mach]] as well as [[Wilhelm Ostwald]] had resisted [[Ludwig Boltzmann]]'s reduction of [[thermodynamics]]—and thereby [[Boyle's law]]&lt;ref&gt;Instances of falsity limited Boyle's law to special cases, thus [[ideal gas law]].&lt;/ref&gt;—to [[statistical mechanics]] partly ''because'' it rested on [[kinetic theory of gas]],&lt;ref name=Spohn-idealgas&gt;Spohn, ''Laws of Belief'' (Oxford U P, 2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=MSXrFBvIZIUC&amp;pg=PA306&amp;dq=gas p 306].&lt;/ref&gt; hinging on [[atomic theory of matter|atomic/molecular theory of matter]].&lt;ref name=NewburghEtAl/&gt;  Mach as well as Ostwald viewed matter as a variant of energy, and molecules as mathematical illusions,&lt;ref name=NewburghEtAl&gt;Newburgh ''et al'', [http://physlab.lums.edu.pk/images/f/fe/Ref1.pdf "Einstein, Perrin, and the reality of atoms"], ''Am J Phys'', 2006, p 478.&lt;/ref&gt; as even Boltzmann thought possible.&lt;ref name=Kuhn-Frank&gt;For brief review of Boltmann's view, see ch 3 "Philipp Frank", § 1 "[[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|T S Kuhn]]'s interview", in Blackmore ''et al'', eds, ''Ernst Mach's Vienna 1895–1930'' (Kluwer, 2001), [https://books.google.com/books?id=hCfk8tZix6oC&amp;pg=PA63&amp;dq=Mach+Boltzmann+atoms p 63], as Frank was a student of Boltzmann soon after Mach's retirement. See "Notes", [https://books.google.com/books?id=hCfk8tZix6oC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;dq=atomism pp 79–80], #12 for views of Mach and of Ostwald, #13 for views of contemporary physicists generally, and #14 for views of [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]].  The more relevant here is #12: "Mach seems to have had several closely related opinions concerning [[atomism]].  First, he often thought the theory might be useful in physics as long as one did not believe in the [[scientific realism|reality]] of atoms.  Second, he believed it was difficult to apply the atomic theory to both psychology and physics.  Third, his own theory of elements is often called an 'atomistic theory' in psychology in contrast with both gestalt theory and a continuum theory of experience.  Fourth, when critical of the reality of atoms, he normally meant the Greek sense of 'indivisible substance' and thought Boltzmann was being evasive by advocating divisible atoms or 'corpuscles' such as would become normal after [[J J Thomson]] and the distinction between [[electron]]s and [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]].  Fifth, he normally called physical atoms 'things of thought' and was very happy when Ostwald seemed to refute the reality of atoms in 1905.  And sixth, after Ostwald returned to atomism in 1908, Mach continued to defend Ostwald's 'energeticist' alternative to atomism".&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, via statistical mechanics, [[Albert Einstein]] predicted the phenomenon [[Brownian motion]]—unexplained since reported in 1827 by botanist [[Robert Brown (Scottish botanist from Montrose)|Robert Brown]].&lt;ref name=NewburghEtAl/&gt;  Soon, most physicists accepted that atoms and molecules were unobservable yet real.&lt;ref name=NewburghEtAl/&gt;  Also in 1905, Einstein explained the electromagnetic field's energy as distributed in ''particles'', doubted until this helped resolve [[atomic theory]] in the 1910s and 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;
Physicists had explained the electromagnetic field's energy as ''mechanical'' energy, like an ocean wave's bodily impact, not water droplets individually showered (Grandy, ''Everyday Quantum Reality'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=v-Tmtb-XvwcC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq= pp 22–23]).  In the 1890s, the problem of [[blackbody radiation]] was paradoxical until [[Max Planck]] theorized ''[[quantum]]'' exhibiting [[Planck's constant]]—a minimum unit of energy.  The quanta were mysterious, not viewed as ''particles'', yet simply as units of ''energy''.  Another paradox, however, was the [[photoelectric effect]].
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As shorter wavelength yields more waves per unit distance, lower wavelength is higher wave frequency.  Within the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]'s visible portion, frequency sets the color.  Light's intensity, however, is the wave's amplitude as the wave's height.  In a strictly wave explanation, a greater intensity—higher wave amplitude—raises the mechanical energy delivered, namely, the wave's impact, and thereby yields greater physical effect.  And yet in the photoelectric effect, only a certain color and beyond—a certain frequency and higher—was found to knock electrons off a metal surface. Below that frequency or color, raising the intensity of the light still knocked no electrons off.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Einstein modeled Planck's quanta as each a particle whose individual energy was Planck's constant multiplied by the light's wave's frequency: at only a certain frequency and beyond would each particle be energetic enough to eject an electron from its orbital.  Although elevating the intensity of light would deliver more energy—more total particles—each individual particle would still lack sufficient energy to dislodge an electron.  Einstein's model, far more intricate, used [[probability theory]] to explain rates of elections ejections as rates of collisions with electromagnetic particles.  This revival of the [[particle theory of light|particle hypothesis of light]]—generally attributed to Newton—was widely doubted.  By 1920, however, the explanation helped solve problems in [[atomic theory]], and thus [[quantum mechanics]] emerged.  In 1926, [[Gilbert N Lewis]] termed the particles ''[[photon]]s''.  [[quantum electrodynamics|QED]] models them as the electromagnetic field's [[messenger particle]]s or force carriers, emitted and absorbed by electrons and by other particles undergoing transitions.
&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, all known physical phenomena were gravitational or [[timeline of electromagnetic theory|electromagnetic]],&lt;ref&gt;Wolfson, ''Simply Einstein'' (W W Norton &amp; Co, 2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=FwNJ_PDRnbkC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=Wrap p 67].&lt;/ref&gt; whose two theories misaligned.&lt;ref&gt;Newton's gravitational theory at 1687 had postulated [[absolute space and time|absolute space and absolute time]].  To fit [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Young]]'s [[transverse wave]] theory of light at 1804, space was theoretically filled with [[Augustin Fresnel|Fresnel]]'s [[luminiferous aether]] at 1814.  By [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]'s electromagnetic field theory of 1865, light always holds a constant speed, which, however, must be relative to something, apparently to aether.  Yet if light's speed is constant relative to aether, then a body's motion through aether would be relative to—thus vary in relation to—light's speed.  Even Earth's vast speed, multiplied by experimental ingenuity with an [[interferometer]] by [[Michelson–Morley experiment|Michelson &amp; Morley at 1887]], revealed no apparent ''aether drift''—light speed apparently constant, an absolute.  Thus, both Newton's gravitational theory and Maxwell's electromagnetic theory each had its own relativity principle, yet the two were incompatible.  For brief summary, see Wilczek, ''Lightness of Being'' (Basic Books, 2008), [https://books.google.com/books?id=iWhxK12fbA4C&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq= pp 78–80].&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet belief in aether as the source of all physical phenomena was virtually unanimous.&lt;ref&gt;Cordero, ''EPSA Philosophy of Science'' (Springer, 2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=e0B_VtFeSi4C&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=ether pp 26–28].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hooper, ''Aether and Gravitation'' (Chapman &amp; Hall, 1903), [https://books.google.com/books?id=cgoQAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA126&amp;dq=Aether pp 122–23].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lodge&gt;Lodge, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FgYiAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA202&amp;dq=action+constitute+distance+electron+empty+space+gravitation+Optical "The ether of space"], ''Sci Am Suppl'', 1909; '''67''':202–03.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Even Mach, who shunned all hypotheses beyond direct sensory experience, presumed an aether, required for motion to not violate [[mechanical philosophy]]'s founding principle, ''No instant inter[[action at a distance]]'' (Einstein, "Ether", ''Sidelights'' (Methuen, 1922), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vwZlfF3sVJEC&amp;pg=RA1-PA617&amp;dq=special pp 15–18]).&lt;/ref&gt;  At experimental paradoxes,&lt;ref&gt;
Rowlands, ''Oliver Lodge'' (Liverpool U P, 1990), [https://books.google.com/books?id=7BfLxqkSgBEC&amp;pg=PA159&amp;dq= pp 159–60]: "[[Sir Oliver Lodge|Lodge]]'s [[luminiferous aether|ether]] experiments have become part of the historical background leading up to the establishment of [[special relativity]] and their significance is usually seen in this context.  Special relativity, it is stated, eliminated both the ether and the concept of absolute motion from physics.  Two experiments were involved: that of Michelson and Morley, which showed that bodies do not move with respect to a stationary ether, and that of Lodge, which showed that moving bodies do not drag ether with them.  With the emphasis on relativity, the [[Michelson–Morley]] experiment has come to be seen as the more significant of the two, and Lodge's experiment becomes something of a detail, a matter of eliminating the final, and less likely, possibility of a nonstationary, viscous, all-pervading medium.

It could be argued that almost the exact opposite may have been the case.  The Michelson–Morley experiment did not prove that there was no absolute motion, and it did not prove that there was no stationary ether.  Its results—and the [[FitzGerald–Lorentz contraction]]—could have been predicted on [[Oliver Heaviside|Heaviside]]'s, or even [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]'s, theory, even if no experiment had ever taken place.  The significance of the experiment, though considerable, is purely historical, and in no way factual.  Lodge's experiment, on the other hand, showed that, if an ether existed, then its properties must be quite different from those imagined by mechanistic theorists.  The ether which he always believed existed had to acquire entirely new properties as a result of this work".&lt;/ref&gt; physicists modified the aether's hypothetical properties.&lt;ref&gt;Mainly [[Hendrik Lorentz]] as well as [[Henri Poincaré]] modified [[classical electrodynamics|electrodynamic theory]] and, more or less, developed special theory of relativity before Einstein did (Ohanian, ''Einstein's Mistakes'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=4DunN-eD3VIC&amp;pg=PA282&amp;dq= pp 281–85]).  Yet Einstein, free a thinker, took the next step and stated it, more elegantly, without aether (Torretti, ''Philosophy of Physics'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=P180&amp;dq=Lorentz+Einstein p 180]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Heisenberg's [[matrix mechanics]] confusingly talked of ''[[operator (quantum mechanics)|operator]]s'' acting on ''[[quantum state]]s''. [[Richard Feynman]] introduced QM's [[path integral formulation|path integral]] formalism—interpretable as a particle traveling all paths imaginable, canceling themselves, leaving just one, the most efficient—predictively identical with Heisenberg's [[matrix mechanics|matrix]] formalism and with Schrödinger's [[Schrödinger's equation|wave]] formalism.&lt;/ref&gt; the two theories made identical predictions.&lt;ref name=QMformalisms/&gt;  [[Paul Dirac]]'s 1928 [[Dirac equation|model of the electron]] was set to [[special relativity]], launching [[quantum mechanics|QM]] into the first [[quantum field theory]] (QFT), [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED).&lt;ref name=Torretti-p393-95&gt;Torretti, ''Philosophy of Physics'' (Cambridge U P, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=P393&amp;dq= pp 393–95].&lt;/ref&gt;  From it, Dirac interpreted and predicted the electron's [[antiparticle]], soon discovered and termed ''[[positron]]'',&lt;ref name=Torretti-p394&gt;Torretti, ''Philosophy of Physics'' (Cambridge U P, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=P394&amp;dq= p 394].&lt;/ref&gt; but the QED failed electrodynamics at high energies.&lt;ref name=Torretti-p395/&gt;  Elsewhere and otherwise, [[strong nuclear force]] and [[weak nuclear force]] were discovered.&lt;ref&gt;Recognition of strong force permitted [[Manhattan Project]] to engineer [[Little Boy]] and [[Fat Man]], dropped on Japan, whereas effects of weak force were seen in its aftermath—[[radioactive fallout]]—of diverse health consequences.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, [[Richard Feynman]] introduced QM's [[path integral formulation|path integral]] formalism, which if taken toward ''interpretation'' as a causal mechanical model clashes with Heisenberg's [[matrix mechanics|matrix]] formalism and with Schrödinger's [[Schrödinger's equation|wave]] formalism,&lt;ref name=QMs/&gt; although all three are empirically identical, sharing predictions.&lt;ref name=QMformalisms&gt;From 1925 to 1926, independently but nearly simultaneously, [[Werner Heisenberg]] as well as [[Erwin Schrödinger]] developed quantum mechanics (Zee in Feynman, ''QED'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PR14&amp;dq= p xiv]).  Schrödinger introduced [[Schrödinger equation|wave mechanics]], whose [[wave function]] is discerned by a [[partial differential equation]], now termed ''[[Schrödinger equation]]'' (p xiv).  Heisenberg, who also stated the [[uncertainty principle]], along with [[Max Born]] and [[Pascual Jordan]] introduced [[matrix mechanics]], which rather confusingly talked of ''[[operator (quantum mechanics)|operator]]s'' acting on ''[[quantum state]]s'' (p xiv).  If taken as causal mechanically [[explanatory]], the two formalisms vividly disagree, and yet are indiscernible [[empirically]], that is, when not used for ''interpretation'', and taken as simply ''[[scientific formalism|formalism]]'' ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PR15&amp;dq= p xv]).
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 1941, at a party in a tavern in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], visiting physicist Herbert Jehle mentioned to [[Richard Feynman]] a different formalism suggested by [[Paul Dirac]], who developed [[bra–ket notation]], in 1932 (p xv).  The next day, Feynman completed Dirac's suggested approach as ''[[sum over histories]]'' or ''[[sum over paths]]'' or ''[[path integral formulation|path integrals]]'' (p xv).  Feynman would joke that this approach—which sums all possible paths that a particle could take, as though the particle actually takes them all, canceling themselves out except for one pathway, the particle's most efficient—abolishes the uncertainty principle ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PR16&amp;dq= p xvi]).  All empirically equivalent, Schrödinger's wave formalism, Heisenberg's matrix formalism, and Feynman's path integral formalism all incorporate the uncertain principle (p xvi).
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There is no particular barrier to additional formalisms, which could be, simply have not been, developed and widely disseminated ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PR17&amp;dq= p xvii]).  In a particular physical discipline, however, and on a particular problem, one of the three formalisms might be easier than others to operate ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PR16&amp;dq= pp xvi–xvii]).  By the 1960s, path integral formalism virtually vanished from use, while matrix formalism was the "canonical" ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PR17&amp;dq= p xvii]).  In the 1970s, path integral formalism made a "roaring comeback", became the predominant means to make predictions from [[quantum field theory|QFT]], and impelled Feynman to an aura of mystique ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PR18&amp;dq= p xviii]).&lt;/ref&gt;  Next, working on QED, Feynman sought to model particles without fields and find the vacuum truly empty.&lt;ref name=Wilczek1999p13/&gt;  As each known [[fundamental force]]&lt;ref&gt;The four, known [[fundamental interactions]] are gravitational, electromagnetic, weak nuclear, and strong nuclear.&lt;/ref&gt; is apparently an effect of a field, Feynman failed.&lt;ref name=Wilczek1999p13/&gt;  [[Louis de Broglie]]'s [[waveparticle duality]] had rendered [[atomism]]—indivisible particles in a void—untenable, and highlighted the very notion of discontinuous particles as selfcontradictory.&lt;ref&gt;Grandy, ''Everyday Quantum Reality'' (Indiana U P, 2010), [https://books.google.com/books?id=v-Tmtb-XvwcC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq= pp 24–25].&lt;/ref&gt;

Meeting in 1947, [[Freeman Dyson]], [[Richard Feynman]], [[Julian Schwinger]], and [[Sin-Itiro Tomonaga]] soon introduced ''[[renormalization]]'', a procedure converting QED to physics' most predictively precise theory,&lt;ref name=Torretti-p395&gt;Torretti, ''Philosophy of Physics'' (Cambridge U P, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=P395&amp;dq= p 395].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schweber&gt;Schweber, [https://books.google.com/books/about/QED_and_the_Men_who_Made_it.html?id=61n5dE7FJQgC ''QED and the Men who Made it''] (Princeton U P, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; subsuming [[chemistry]], [[optics]], and [[statistical mechanics]].&lt;ref name=Schwarz/&gt;&lt;ref name=Feynman&gt;Feynman, ''QED'' (Princeton U P, 2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=chemistry p 5].&lt;/ref&gt;  QED thus won physicists' general acceptance.&lt;ref name=Torretti-p395-96/&gt;  [[Paul Dirac]] criticized its need for renormalization as showing its unnaturalness,&lt;ref name=Torretti-p395-96&gt;Torretti, ''Philosophy of Physics'', (Cambridge U P, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=P395&amp;dq=Dirac pp 395–96].&lt;/ref&gt; and called for an aether.&lt;ref name=Cushing-p158-59&gt;Cushing, ''Quantum Mechanics'' (U Chicago P, 1994), [https://books.google.com/books?id=kTewHaL8fvgC&amp;pg=PA158&amp;dq=ether+Dirac+medium+vacuum#v=twopage pp 158–59].&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1947, [[Willis Lamb]] had found unexpected motion of [[electron configuration|electron orbitals]], [[Lamb shift|shift]]ed since the vacuum is not truly empty.&lt;ref&gt;Close, [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/physics/blog/tag/ether "Much ado about nothing"], ''Nova'', PBS/WGBH, 2012:

"This new quantum mechanical view of nothing began to emerge in 1947, when [[Willis Lamb]] measured spectrum of hydrogen.  The electron in a hydrogen atom cannot move wherever it pleases but instead is restricted to specific paths.  This is analogous to climbing a ladder: You cannot end up at arbitrary heights above ground, only those where there are rungs to stand on.  Quantum mechanics explains the spacing of the rungs on the atomic ladder and predicts the frequencies of radiation that are emitted or absorbed when an electron switches from one to another.  According to the state of the art in 1947, which assumed the hydrogen atom to consist of just an electron, a proton, and an electric field, two of these rungs have identical energy. However, Lamb's measurements showed that these two rungs differ in energy by about one part in a million.  What could be causing this tiny but significant difference?

"When physicists drew up their simple picture of the atom, they had forgotten something: Nothing.  Lamb had become the first person to observe experimentally that the vacuum is not empty, but is instead seething with ephemeral electrons and their anti-matter analogues, positrons.  These electrons and positrons disappear almost instantaneously, but in their brief mayfly moment of existence they alter the shape of the atom's electromagnetic field slightly.  This momentary interaction with the electron inside the hydrogen atom kicks one of the rungs of the ladder just a bit higher than it would be otherwise.
&lt;br&gt;
"This is all possible because, in quantum mechanics, energy is not conserved on very short timescales, or for very short distances.  Stranger still, the more precisely you attempt to look at something—or at nothing—the more dramatic these energy fluctuations become.  Combine that with Einstein's E=mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which implies that energy can congeal in material form, and you have a recipe for particles that bubble in and out of existence even in the void.  This effect allowed Lamb to literally measure something from nothing".&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet ''emptiness'' was catchy, abolishing aether conceptually, and physics proceeded ostensibly without it,&lt;ref name=Wilczek1999p13/&gt; even suppressing it.&lt;ref name=Cushing-p158-59/&gt;  Meanwhile, "sickened by untidy math, most [[philosophy of physics|philosophers of physics]] tend to neglect QED".&lt;ref name=Torretti-p395-96/&gt;

According to this theory, light consists of wave-like vibrations in an invisible medium called the ether, which was supposed to permeate the whole universe.  (The rival to the wave theory was the particle theory of light, favoured by Newton, which held that light consists of very small particles emitted by the light source.)  The wave theory was not widely accepted until the French physicist Auguste Fresnel formulated a mathematical version of the theory in 1815, and used it to predict some surprising new optical phenomena.  Optical experiments confirmed Fresnel's predictions, convincing many 19th-century scientists that the wave theory of light must be true.  But modern physics tells us that the theory is not true: there is no such thing as the ether, so light doesn't consist of vibrations in it.  Again, we have an example of a false but empirically successful theory".&lt;/ref&gt; "relegated to the dustbin of scientific history ever since" 1905 brought [[special relativity]].&lt;ref name=Pigliucci&gt;Pigliucci, ''Answers for Aristotle'' (Basic Books, 2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=laZensALMSgC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=antirealist+aether p 119]: "But the antirealist will quickly point out that plenty of times in the past scientists have posited the existence of unobservables that were apparently necessary to explain a phenomenon, only to discover later on that such unobservables did not in fact exist.  A classic case is the aether, a substance that was supposed by nineteenth-century physicists to permeate all space and make it possible for electromagnetic radiation (like light) to propagate.  It was Einstein's special theory of relativity, proposed in 1905, that did away with the necessity of aether, and the concept has been relegated to the dustbin of scientific history ever since.  The antirealists will relish pointing out that modern physics features a number of similarly unobservable entities, from [[quantum foam|quantum mechanical 'foam']] to [[dark energy]], and that the current crop of scientists seems just as confident about the latter two as their nineteenth-century counterparts were about aether".&lt;/ref&gt;  Einstein was noncommittal to aether's nonexistence,&lt;ref name=Tavel/&gt; simply said it superfluous.&lt;ref name=Cordero-p29-30/&gt;  Abolishing Newtonian motion for electrodynamic primacy, however, Einstein inadvertently reinforced aether,&lt;ref name=Wilczek-p78-80&gt;Wilczek, ''Lightness of Being'' (Basic Books, 2008), [https://books.google.com/books?id=iWhxK12fbA4C&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq= pp 78–80].&lt;/ref&gt; and to explain motion was led back to aether in [[general relativity]].&lt;ref name=Laughlin&gt;Laughlin, ''A Different Universe'' (Basic Books, 2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=djQKg_XBsLEC&amp;pg=PA120&amp;dq=ironic pp 120–21].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Einstein/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Lorentz aether theory|Lorentz aether]] was at absolute rest—acting ''on'' matter but not acted on ''by'' matter.

It turns out that such matter exists.  About the time that relativity was becoming accepted, studies of radioactivity began showing that the empty vacuum of space had spectroscopic structure similar to that of ordinary quantum solids and fluids.  Subsequent studies with large particle accelerators have now led us to understand that space is more like a piece of window glass than ideal Newtonian emptiness.  It is filled with 'stuff' that is normally transparent but can be made visible by hitting it sufficiently hard to knock out a part.

(Whittaker, ''A History of Theories of Aether'' (Longmans, Green &amp; Co: 1910), [https://archive.org/stream/historyoftheorie00whitrich#page/18/mode/2up pp 17–18])&lt;/ref&gt;  By now, most [[theoretical physics|theoretical physicists]] infer that the four, known [[fundamental interactions]] would reduce to [[superstring theory]], whereby atoms and molecules, after all, are energy vibrations holding mathematical, geometric forms.&lt;ref name=Schwarz/&gt;  Given uncertainties of [[scientific realism]],&lt;ref name=Bolotin-realism&gt;Challenges to [[scientific realism]] are captured succinctly by Bolotin, ''Approach to Aristotle's Physics'' (SUNY P, 1998), [https://books.google.com/books?id=LLqB1IfeSZ0C&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq= pp 33–34], commenting about modern science, "But it has not succeeded, of course, in encompassing all phenomena, at least not yet.  For it laws are mathematical idealizations, idealizations, moreover, with no immediate basis in experience and with no evident connection to the ultimate causes of the natural world.  For instance, [[Newton's first law of motion]] (the law of inertia) requires us to imagine a body that is always at rest or else moving aimlessly in a straight line at a constant speed, even though we never see such a body, and even though according to his own theory of universal gravitation, it is impossible that there can be one.  This fundamental law, then, which begins with a claim about what would happen in a situation that never exists, carries no conviction except insofar as it helps to predict observable events.  Thus, despite the amazing success of Newton's laws in predicting the observed positions of the planets and other bodies, Einstein and Infeld are correct to say, in ''[[The Evolution of Physics]]'', that 'we can well imagine another system, based on different assumptions, might work just as well'.  Einstein and Infeld go on to assert that 'physical concepts are free creations of the human mind, and are not, however it may seem, uniquely determined by the external world'.  To illustrate what they mean by this assertion, they compare the modern scientist to a man trying to understand the mechanism of a closed watch.  If he is ingenious, they acknowledge, this man 'may form some picture of a mechanism which would be responsible for all the things he observes'.  But they add that he 'may never quite be sure his picture is the only one which could explain his observations.  He will never be able to compare his picture with the real mechanism and he cannot even imagine the possibility or the meaning of such a comparison'.  In other words, modern science cannot claim, and it will never be able to claim, that it has the definite understanding of any natural phenomenon".&lt;/ref&gt; some conclude that the concept ''causality'' raises comprehensibility of scientific explanation and thus is key [[folk science]], but compromises precision of scientific explanation and is dropped as a science matures.&lt;ref&gt;Norton, [http://www.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/papers/003004.pdf "Causation as folk science"], in Price &amp; Corry, eds, ''Mature Causation, Physics, and the Constitution of Reality'' (Oxford U P, 2007), esp [https://books.google.com/books?id=oCXe4DvqUFMC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq= p 12].&lt;/ref&gt;  Even [[epidemiology]] is maturing to heed the severe difficulties with presumptions about causality.&lt;ref name=Kundi/&gt;&lt;ref name=Karhausen&gt;{{Cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2690">'''''Dira Betachtonim''''' ({{lang-he-n|דירה בתחתונים}}) is a concept in [[Chabad philosophy]] describing the process of manifesting the presence of God within the world. ''Dirah Batachtonim'' is discussed primarily by the fifth [[Chabad]] Rebbe, Rabbi [[Sholom Dovber Schneersohn]], in his ''[[Samech Vov]]'' series of Hasidic treatises. In the Samech Vov series, this idea is pronounced as the ultimate purpose of creation.&lt;ref name=66b&gt;Paltiel, Yosef Y.

Central to the ''Dirah Betachtonim'' concept is the notion of sublimating the physical aspects of existence.&lt;ref&gt;Levin, Faitel.

==Attribution==
The concept of a divine dwelling is attributed to a statement in ''[[Midrash Tanchuma]]'', an Talmudic book of homilies, “God had a desire to have a home in the lower world.”&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, Simon.

==As a theological system==
The concept of ''Dirah Betachtonim'' is the central focus of the book ''Heaven on Earth'' by Rabbi Faitel Levin. According to Levin, ''Dirah Betachtonim'' is not a solitary concept in Chabad philosophy, but represents a complete theological approach to the practice of Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lubavitch.com/news/article/2014602/Exploring-the-Rebbes-Theology.html Exploring the Rebbe's Theology].

==Comparisons==
In Chabad philosophy, ''Dirah Betachtonim'' has been compared to the type of divine manifestation in the [[Atzilut|World of Atzilut]]. The divine presence in Atzilut is thought to be especially profound; ''Dirah Betachtonim'' is thought as the attempt to mimic that manifestation within the [[Assiah|World of Assiah]].&lt;ref&gt;Altein, Leibel.

{{technical|date=April 2017}}{{Psychology sidebar}}'''Dishabituation''' (or '''''dehabituation''''') is a form of recovered or restored behavioral response wherein the reaction towards a known stimulus is enhanced, as opposed to [[habituation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steiner|first=Genevieve Z.|last2=Barry|first2=Robert J.|date=2014-02-14|year=|title=The mechanism of dishabituation|journal=Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience|volume=8|pages=|doi=10.3389/fnint.2014.00014|issn=1662-5145|pmc=3924047|pmid=24592215|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, it was proposed as an explanation to increased response for a habituated behavior by introducing an external stimulus;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/~coulson/101b/Learning1.pdf|title=Classical Conditioning {{!}} Learning, Memory, &amp; Attention|last=|first=|date=|website=University of California, San Diego - Department of Cognitive Science|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, upon further analysis, the focus was conclusively established that a proper analysis of dishabituation should be taken into consideration only when the response is increased by implying the original stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rankin|first=Catharine H.|last2=Abrams|first2=Thomas|last3=Barry|first3=Robert J.|last4=Bhatnagar|first4=Seema|authorlink4=Seema Bhatnagar|last5=Clayton|first5=David|last6=Colombo|first6=John|last7=Coppola|first7=Gianluca|last8=Geyer|first8=Mark A.|last9=Glanzman|first9=David L.|date=2017-03-28|year=|title=Habituation Revisited: An Updated and Revised Description of the Behavioral Characteristics of Habituation|journal=Neurobiology of learning and memory|volume=92|issue=2|pages=135–138|doi=10.1016/j.nlm.2008.09.012|issn=1074-7427|pmc=2754195|pmid=18854219|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on studies conducted over habituation's dual-process theory which attributed towards dishabituation, it is also determined that the latter was independent of any behavioral sensitization.&lt;ref name="Steiner"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steiner|first=Genevieve Z.|last2=Barry|first2=Robert J.|date=2014-01-01|year=|title=The mechanism of dishabituation|url=http://ro.uow.edu.au/sspapers/782/|journal=Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience|language=en|volume=8|pages=|doi=10.3389/fnint.2014.00014|pmc=3924047|pmid=24592215|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of dishabituation is the response of a receptionist in a scenario where a delivery truck arrives at 9:00AM every morning. The first few times it arrives it is noticed by the receptionist, and after weeks, the receptionist does not respond as strongly. One day the truck does not arrive, and the receptionist notices its absence. When it arrives the next day, the receptionist's response is stronger when it arrives as expected.

== History ==
The phenomenon was studied by an early scientist [[Samuel Jackson Holmes]] in 1912, while he was studying the [[Animal Behavior|animal behavior]] in [[sea urchin]]s. Later in 1933, [[George Humphrey (psychologist)|George Humphrey]]—while studying the same effects in human babies and extensively over [[lower vertebrates]]—argued that dishabituation is in fact the removal of habituation altogether, to a behavior that was not conditioned to begin with.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Richard F|date=2017-03-28|year=|title=Habituation: A History|journal=Neurobiology of learning and memory|volume=92|issue=2|pages=127–134|doi=10.1016/j.nlm.2008.07.011|issn=1074-7427|pmc=2714193|pmid=18703156|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanism ==

=== In humans ===
According to the [[Habituation#Dual-process theory|dual-process theory of habituation]], dishabituation is characterized by an increase in responding to a habituated stimulus after introducing a deviant, to sensitize a change in arousal.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=OT-rUMExGrAC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;lpg=PA53&amp;dq=dishabituation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=O6Y1wG8G9G&amp;sig=H4PE0B48Ak4oQIIFJ9nqSXj0feg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj3r_2e2PjSAhVIi7wKHSqmCHw4ChDoAQhGMAg#v=onepage&amp;q=dishabituation&amp;f=false|title=Learning: Principles and Applications|last=Klein|first=Stephen B.|date=2011-04-04|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=9781412987349|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Steiner"/&gt; Further investigations into elicitation and habituation of the electrodermal orienting reflex also showed that dishabituation is independent of sensitization for indifferent stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steiner|first=Genevieve Z.|last2=Barry|first2=Robert J.|date=2011-01-01|title=Exploring the mechanism of dishabituation|url=http://researchdirect.uws.edu.au/islandora/object/uws:30621|journal=Neurobiology of Learning and Memory|language=en|volume=95|issue=4|pages=461–466|doi=10.1016/j.nlm.2011.02.007|issn=1074-7427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[meta-analysis]] shows that dishabituation is improvised on preterm infants as compared to term infants based on the magnitude of stimulus sensitized.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kavšek|first=Michael|last2=Bornstein|first2=Marc H.|date=2010-01-01|year=|title=Visual Habituation and Dishabituation in Preterm Infants: A Review and Meta-analysis|journal=Research in developmental disabilities|volume=31|issue=5|pages=951–975|doi=10.1016/j.ridd.2010.04.016|issn=0891-4222|pmc=3167676|pmid=20488657|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.mnstate.edu/malonech/Psy611/Notes/Bjorklund/Perception%20and%20Cognition%20BjCh4.htm|title=Infant Perception and Cognition|last=|first=|date=|website=Minnesota State University Moorhead|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Biological basis ====
As per the Center for [[Neural engineering|Neural Engineering]], [[University of Southern California]] ([[Los Angeles]]), the primordial [[hippocampus]] plays an important role in modeling the dishabituation of behavioral response. According to this, the interaction of two processes is dynamically postulated based on [[synaptic plasticity]], which acquires both long and short-term forgetting. Along with that, cumulative shrinking is proposed to map responses from the temporal region of the anterior [[thalamus]] that references the spatial positions. The plasticity model combined with the structure of [[Medial pallidum|medial pallium]] model provides a structured network of neural mechanisms, contributing towards dishabituation and habituation alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=D.|last2=Arbib|first2=M. A.|date=1992-01-01|title=Modeling the dishabituation hierarchy: the role of the primordial hippocampus|journal=Biological Cybernetics|volume=67|issue=6|pages=535–544|issn=0340-1200|pmid=1472577}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, this phenomenon is neither indicative to counteract the emphasis of an existing habituation but instead, organizes an independent neuronal process, nor resulted by facilitation, as the etymology may indicate.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~wang.77/papers/Wang-Arbib.biocyb92.pdf|title=Modeling the dishabituation hierarchy: The role of the primordial hippocampus|last=|first=|date=|website=Department of Computer Science and Engineering {{!}} The Ohio State UniversityAccessibilityPrivacy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All the above establish the process of dishabituation, where responding to a repetitive stimulus increases and has been documented in a wide range of organisms - from single-celled animals to primates - which is thought to allow an organism to reflexively either filter out or consider, all forms of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=caf8iat1C7sC&amp;pg=PA568&amp;lpg=PA568&amp;dq=dishabituation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=o_3r4xw11R&amp;sig=8W762TpRgufy_up-RsJoSmNHGWU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj3r_2e2PjSAhVIi7wKHSqmCHw4ChDoAQhJMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=dishabituation&amp;f=false|title=The Design of Animal Communication|last=Hauser|first=Marc D.|last2=Konishi|first2=Mark|date=2017-03-29|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262582230|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also characterized as an emancipation of an existing prey-catching behavior. Sometimes however, the inconsistency in dishabituation of behavioral response is brought-on by mismatch between the 1st and 2nd stimuli, which in-turn is due to the occurrence of inhibition by habituation, to the existing stimulus.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Application ==
Dishabituation shows an increase in reward effectiveness as it produces a heightened behavioral response to sensitization of [[arousal]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Other studies also show that it is caused by [[mind-wandering]], where with distributed working process as opposed to practising in mass, the learning behavior is enhanced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/features/cep-a0031569.pdf|title=The Costs and Benefits of Mind-Wandering: A Review|last=|first=|date=|website=American Psychological Association|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the development of preterm infants, the dishabituation process also provides with an approach for the early diagnosis of cognitive status and most importantly, their mental faculties performances.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kavsek|first=Michael|title=Predicting Later IQ from Infant Visual Habituation and Dishabituation: A Meta-Analysis|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ731762|journal=Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology|language=en|volume=25|issue=3|pages=369–393|doi=10.1016/j.appdev.2004.04.006|issn=0193-3973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2765">'''Epidoseis''' ({{lang-grc|ἐπιδόσεις}}) was a form of non-compulsory, non-tax financial giving in [[ancient Greece]].

These epidoseis were voluntary contributions, either in money, arms, or ships, which were made by the citizens of [[Athens]] in order to meet the extraordinary demands of the state. When the expenses of the state were greater than its revenue, it was usual for the [[prytaneis]] to summon an assembly of the people -- ''[[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|ecclesia]]'' -- and, after explaining the necessities of the state, to call upon the citizens to contribute according to their means.

Those who were willing to contribute then rose and said what they would give; while those who were unwilling to give anything, remained silent or retired privately from the assembly.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''[[Alcibiades]]'' 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''[[Phocion]]'' 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="meid"&gt;[[Demosthenes]], ''[[Against Meidias]]'' pp. 566-567. 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Theophrastus]], ''Characters'' 22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Athen. iv. p. 168, e&lt;/ref&gt; The names of those who had promised to contribute, together with the amount of their contributions, were written on tablets, which were placed before the statues of the [[Eponymous archon|Eponymi]], where they remained until the amount was paid.&lt;ref&gt;[[Isaeus]], ''On Dicaeogenes'' p. 111, ed. Reisk&lt;/ref&gt;

These voluntary contributions were frequently very large. Sometimes the more wealthy citizens voluntarily undertook a "trierarchy", or the expenses of equipping a [[trireme]].&lt;ref name="meid"/&gt; We read that the freedman [[Pasion]] furnished 1000 shields, together with five triremes, which he equipped at his own expense.&lt;ref&gt;[[Demosthenes]] ''Against Stephanus'' p. 1127. 12&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chrysippus]] presented a talent to the state, when [[Alexander the Great]] moved against Thebes during the [[Battle of Thebes]];&lt;ref&gt;[[Demosthenes]] ''Against Phormio'' p. 918. 20&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristophanes, son of Nicophemus]] gave 30,000 [[drachma]]e for an expedition against [[Cyprus]];&lt;ref&gt;[[Lysias]], ''On the Property of Aristophanes'' p. 644&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charidemus]] and [[Diotimus]], two commanders, made a free gift of 800 shields;&lt;ref&gt;[[Demosthenes]], ''De Corona'' p. 265. 18&lt;/ref&gt; and similar instances of liberality are mentioned by German classical scholar [[August Böckh]], from whom the preceding examples have been taken.&lt;ref&gt;[[August Böckh]], ''The Public Economy of Athens''  pp. 586, 587, 2nd. ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book examines the history of [[fascism]] and based on the growth of [[big business]] and [[big government]] describes [[Scenario planning|possible political scenarios]] for a [[Futures studies|future United States]].&lt;ref name="NYBOOKS-19801023"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AJLS-1980"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EM-DWharton"/&gt; According to a 1981 review in the journal [[Social Justice (journal)|''Social Justice'']], the book is described as "timely" on a subject requiring serious consideration and is about the dangers of fascism, focusing primarily on the United States, but being aware that [[monopoly capitalism]] needs to be understood internationally since [[capitalism]] "is not a national [[mode of production]]".&lt;ref name="SJ-1981"/&gt;

In 2016, the book prompted the following response right after [[Donald Trump]] was elected [[President of the United States]]: "The next wave of fascists will not come with [[Stock car (rail)|cattle cars]] and [[Internment|concentration camps]], but they'll come with a [[Smiley|smiley face]] and maybe a [[Television show|TV show]]. [...] That’s how the 21st-century fascists will essentially take over".&lt;ref name="HP-20161114" /&gt;

== Reactions ==
According to [[Jason Epstein]], editor, publisher and book reviewer for ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', "''Friendly Fascism'' [...] reflects what seems to be a widespread feeling among [[Liberalism in the United States|liberals]] as well as [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]] that [[democracy]] in America has played itself out: that soon Americans won’t be able to govern themselves".&lt;ref name="NYBOOKS-19801023"&gt;{{cite news |last=Epstein |first=Jason |authorlink=Jason Epstein |title=Is the Party Over? |url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1980/10/23/is-the-party-over/ |date=October 23, 1980 |work=[[The New York Review of Books]] |accessdate=September 19, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Gaddis Smith]], professor emeritus of history at [[Yale University]] and an expert on American [[International relations|foreign relations]], the book is an "insightful lament over the growth of centralized power by business and government in alliance under the direction of faceless managers who [...] are replacing democracy with a form of benevolent fascism".&lt;ref name="FA-19800901"&gt;{{cite web |last=Smith |first=Gaddis |authorlink=Gaddis Smith |title=Friendly Fascism: The New Face of Power in America (capsule review) |url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/1980-09-01/friendly-fascism-new-face-power-america |date=September 1, 1980 |work=[[Foreign Affairs]] |accessdate=September 19, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing on behalf of ''[[Eclectica Magazine]]'', reviewer Dale Wharton comments that the book offers "faint hope of averting [[neofascism]]", but as a possible offset suggests raising aspirations, notably by "setting forth clear lofty goals, broad enough to embrace a great majority". Help may come from insiders since "bubbling upward from all levels of the [[The Establishment|Establishment]] are longings for fulfilling [[employment]] disconnected from [[Consumerism|consumer exploitation]], [[environmental degradation]], or [[militarism]]".&lt;ref name="EM-DWharton"&gt;{{cite web |last=Wharton |first=Dale |title=A review by Dale Wharton: Frienndly Fascism: The New Face of Power in America by Bertram Gross |url=http://www.eclectica.org/v1n1/reviews/wharton_friendly.html |date= |work=[[Eclectica Magazine]] |accessdate=September 20, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Reviewer Dennis Phillips notes in the ''Australian Journal of Law &amp; Society'' that Gross wrote ''Friendly Fascism'' before [[Ronald Reagan]] had become [[President of the United States]], but Reagan's United States, presumed in part to be a result of neofascist techniques described in the book, had "proven Bertram Gross to be an amazingly astute prophet . [...] The evidence for this [in the book] is stunning".&lt;ref name="AJLS-1980"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Phillips |first=Dennis |title=Book Review: Friendly Fascism: The new face of power in America by Bertram Gross |url=http://classic.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/AUJlLawSoc/1982/11.pdf |format=[[PDF]] |date=1982 |journal=Australian Journal of Law &amp; Society |volume=1 |number=1 |pages=136-140 |accessdate=September 20, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a book review in the journal [[Social Justice (journal)|''Social Justice'']] by Gregory Shank of the Institute for the Study of Labor and Economic Crisis, "''Friendly Fascism'' [...] is written to alert readers to a clear and present danger in the current trajectory of [[American politics]]".&lt;ref name="SJ-1981"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shank |first=Gregory |title=Book Review: 'Friendly Fascism: The New Face of Power in America' by Bertram Gross |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/29766120?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents |date=1981 |work=[[Social Justice (journal)|Social Justice]] |volume=15 |pages=71-79 |accessdate=September 19, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently in 2016, the book prompted the following response from [[Michael Moore]] right after [[Donald Trump]] was elected President: "The next wave of fascists will not come with [[Stock car (rail)|cattle cars]] and [[Internment|concentration camps]], but they'll come with a [[Smiley|smiley face]] and maybe a [[Television show|TV show]].

{{italic title}}
'''''Grapefruit''''' is an [[artist's book]] written by [[Yoko Ono]], originally published in 1964. It has become famous as an early example of [[conceptual art]], containing a series of "[[event score]]s" that replace the physical work of art – the traditional stock-in-trade of artists – with instructions that an individual may, or may not, wish to enact.

{{quote|''Grapefruit'' is one of the monuments of conceptual art of the early 1960s. She has a lyrical, poetic dimension that sets her apart from the other conceptual artists. Her approach to art was only made acceptable when white men like [[Joseph Kosuth|Kosuth]] and [[Lawrence Weiner|Weiner]] came in and did virtually the same thing as Yoko, but made them respectable and collectible.|{{Interlanguage link multi|David Bourdon|de}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Interlanguage link multi|David Bourdon|de}} quoted in ''[[New York Times]]'' 1989, reproduced in ''Yes. Yoko Ono'', [[Harry Abrams]] 2000, p26&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Origins of the event score==
{{See also|Fluxus#Event score}}
Event scores were developed by a number of artists attending [[John Cage]]'s experimental music composition classes at the [[New School for Social Research]] in New York. Whilst Ono did not attend these informal lessons, her husband at the time, Ichiyanagi Toshi (an experimental musician), did and Toshi and Ono became regulars of Cage's circle of friends by 1959. Other members of this group included [[David Tudor]], [[Morton Feldman]], [[Richard Maxfield]] and [[Merce Cunningham]]. Invention of the event score is usually credited to [[George Brecht]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0268/is_8_44/ai_n18764245/pg_2 Quoted in George Brecht, by Yve-Alain Bois]&lt;/ref&gt; but [[La Monte Young]] and Yoko Ono are also cited as amongst the first to experiment with the form.&lt;ref&gt;Yes. Yoko Ono, Harry Abrams 2000, p18&lt;/ref&gt; Both Cage and Brecht were deeply influenced by "Oriental thinking",&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.chello.nl/j.seegers1/flux_files/brecht.html George Brecht]&lt;/ref&gt; and Ono found that her Buddhist-inspired work was, almost accidentally, fêted by the emerging New York [[counterculture]] as [[avant-garde]].

{{quote|Event Scores, involve simple actions, ideas, and objects from everyday life recontexualized as performance. Event Scores are texts that can be seen as proposal pieces or instructions for actions. The idea of the score suggests musicality. Like a musical score, Event Scores can be realized by artists other than the original creator and are open to variation and interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aknowles.com/eventscore.html Alison Knowles website]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Origins of the book==
Often considered a [[Fluxus]] artwork, in fact the work was originally published by Ono's own imprint, Wunternaum Press, in [[Tokyo]] in an edition of 500. After leaving New York in 1962 – where she had exhibited at Maciunas' AG Gallery, amongst others – her then-husband Anthony Cox suggested she collect her scores together. [[George Maciunas]], the central personality in Fluxus, had apparently been trying to reach her in Tokyo with the aim of printing a similar book in New York,&lt;ref name="Yes. Yoko Ono 2000, p82"&gt;Yes. Yoko Ono, Harry Abrams 2000, p82&lt;/ref&gt; as part of his series of ''Fluxkits'' (see ''[[Water Yam (artist's book)|Water Yam]]''),&lt;ref&gt;Other artists he intended to compile included [[Daniel Spoerri]], [[Allan Kaprow]], [[Dick Higgins]] and [[La Monte Young]]&lt;/ref&gt; but his letters had not reached her; she sent some of the scores and a prepublication advertisement to be published in his Fluxus newspaper in February 1964 when contact was finally established.

===First edition===
The name ''Grapefruit'' was chosen as title because Ono believed the [[grapefruit]] to be a hybrid of an [[orange (fruit)|orange]] and a [[lemon]], and thus a reflection of herself as "a spiritual hybrid".&lt;ref name="Yes. Yoko Ono 2000, p82"/&gt; It also seems likely that it is a playful allusion to Brecht's ''[[Water Yam (artist's book)|Water Yam]]'', itself a pun on Brecht and Watt's ''Yam Festival'', which, culminating in a series of events and performances in May 1963, had been derived from "May" backwards.

The first edition that was published in 1964 in Japan by Wunternaum Press created by Yoko Ono, contains over 150 "instruction works"; virtually all are in English, with about a third translated into Japanese. They are divided into five sections; ''Music'', ''Painting'', ''Event'', ''Poetry'' and ''Object''. The instructions are preceded by dedications to figures including [[John Cage]], [[La Monte Young]], [[Nam June Paik]], [[Isamu Noguchi]] and [[Peggy Guggenheim]], and also includes documentation relating to Ono's recent exhibitions and performances.&lt;ref name="Yes. Yoko Ono 2000, p82"/&gt; The work was originally sold for $3.00 before publication, $6.00 after.

===Subsequent editions===
The second edition was published in 1970 by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] in New York, Peter Owen Ltd in [[London]], and Bärmeier &amp; Nikel in [[Frankfurt]]. As well as an introduction by [[John Lennon]] ("Hi! My name is John Lennon. I'd like you to meet Yoko Ono ..."&lt;ref&gt;''Grapefruit'' (1970 reissue)&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2000 reissue of Lennon's book, ''[[In His Own Write]]'', Ono wrote a similar introduction), the work contained 80 more instruction pieces, and included two more sections, ''Film'' and ''Dance''. The book ends with a collection of Ono's writings including ''To The Wesleyan People'', 1966.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.a-i-u.net/yokosays.html&lt;/ref&gt; There were also paperback versions printed by Sphere and Touchstone around the same time, and a reprint by Simon &amp; Schuster in 2000. The sphere edition has a particularly memorable sleeve, conflating the title with Yoko Ono's film ''Bottoms'', (or no. 4), a film composed exclusively of naked bottoms, made in 1966.

'''Heinrich Eberhard Gottlob Paulus''' (1 September 1761 &amp;ndash; 10 August 1851) was a [[Germany|German]] [[theology|theologian]] and critic of the [[Bible]]. He is known as a rationalist who offered natural explanations for the biblical [[miracles of Jesus]].

==Career==
Paulus was a professor of theology and oriental languages at the [[University of Jena]] (1789–1803), then professor at the [[University of Würzburg]] (1803–1807). He spent time in [[Bamberg]], [[Nürnberg]] and [[Ansbach]] before becoming professor of exegesis and church history at the [[University of Heidelberg]] (1811–44), where he was instrumental in hiring [[Hegel]] in 1816. His theological rationalism greatly influenced Hegel's own theology.

As a [[Lutheran]] in the [[Age of Enlightenment]], he firmly believed in the autonomy of the individual and freedom of the individual (through reason) from the dogma of the church.

Charges of [[anti-semitism]] have been levelled at Paulus for his advocacy of [[Assimilation (sociology)|assimilation]] of Jewish people into German culture. In his published pamphlet "The Jewish National Separation: Its Origin, Consequences, and the Means of its Correction." he argued that "Jews were a nation apart, and would remain so as long as they were committed to their religion, whose basic intent and purpose were to preserve them in that condition. In a country that was not their own, therefore, Jews could not claim more than the bare protection of their lives and possessions. They might certainly not claim political equality."

The word ''hygge'' comes from a Danish word meaning "to give courage, comfort, joy".&lt;ref name=FalkogTorpHygge&gt;{{ cite book | author = [[Hjalmar Falk|Falk, Hjalmar]] &amp; [[Alf Torp|Torp, Alf]] | year = 1903 | title = Etymologisk Ordbog over det norske og det danske Sprog|chapter=Hygge | place = Kristiania |language=Norwegian| publisher = Aschehoug | url = https://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2014090924004;page=324 | page = 315}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hygge'' stems from ''hyggja'' which means to think in [[Old Norse]].&lt;ref name=FalkogTorpHygge/&gt; ''Hygge'' is built from the [[Old Norse]] word ''hugr'' which later became the [[Hug (folklore)|''hug'']] which means the soul, mind, consciousness.&lt;ref name=FalkogTorpHug&gt;{{ cite book | author = [[Hjalmar Falk|Falk, Hjalmar]] &amp; [[Alf Torp|Torp, Alf]] | year = 1903 | title = Etymologisk Ordbog over det norske og det danske Sprog|chapter=Hu | place = Kristiania |language=Norwegian | publisher = Aschehoug | url = https://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2014090924004;page=312 | page = 303}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Swedish Hygge is a harvested forest area.

But it is also speculated that ''hygge'' might originate from the word ''hug''. ''Hug'' comes from the 1560s word ''hugge'', which means "to embrace". The word ''hugge'' is of unknown origin but is highly associated with an Old Norse term, ''hygga'', which means "to comfort", which comes from the word ''hugr'', meaning "mood". In turn, the word comes from the Germanic word ''hugyan'', which relates to the Old English ''hycgan'', meaning "to think, consider".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/958463988|title=The little book of hygge : the Danish way to live well|last=Wiking|first=Meik|isbn=9780241283912|oclc=958463988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It first appeared in Danish writing in the 19th Century and has since evolved into the cultural idea known in Denmark and Norway today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-34345791|title=Hygge: A heart-warming lesson from Denmark|last=Parkinson|first=Justin|date=2015-10-02|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-05-25|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; While hygge has exactly the same meaning in Norwegian as in Danish and is a widely used word in Denmark (including in its derived forms, such as ''hyggelig''), the emphasis specifically on "hygge" as an important part of their cultural identity is mostly a recent Danish phenomenon; in Norway "hygge" is just a word, similar in status to "cozy" in English-speaking countries.

== Use ==
In both Danish and Norwegian, ''hygge'' refers to "a form of everyday togetherness", "a pleasant and highly valued everyday experience of safety, equality, personal wholeness and a spontaneous social flow".&lt;ref&gt;[https://heinz.sdu.dk:8443/ws/files/38094393/Linnet%20Phd%20dissertation.pdf ''Interweavings – A cultural phenomenology of everyday consumption and social atmosphere within Danish middleclass families'', Jeppe Trolle Linnet, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

The noun ''hygge'' includes something nice, cozy, safe and known, referring to a psychological state.&lt;ref&gt;Hjalmar Falk og Alf Torp (1903): ''Etymologisk ordbog over det norske og det danske sprog''. Aschehoug, Kristiania, s. 315&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Collins English Dictionary|''Collins'' ''English Dictionary'']] defines the word as "a concept, originating in Denmark, of creating cosy and convivial atmospheres that promote wellbeing".&lt;ref name="collins"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/word-lovers-blog/new/top-10-collins-words-of-the-year-2016,323,HCB.html|title=Top 10 Collins Word of the Year 2016|date=2016-11-03|publisher=collinsdictionary.com|accessdate=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
''[[Collins English Dictionary]]'' named ''hygge'' the runner-up (after "[[Brexit]]") as word of the year in the UK in 2016.&lt;ref name="collins" /&gt; This followed a period during which several books focusing on ''hygge'' had been marketed in the UK,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/18/hygge-a-soothing-balm-for-the-traumas-of-2016|title=Hygge – a soothing balm for the traumas of 2016|last=Cartier-Morley|first=Jess|date=2016-10-18|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as ''The Little Book of Hygge'' by Meik Wiking,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/11/the-little-book-of-hygge-by-meik-wiking-digested-read|title=The Little Book of Hygge by Meik Wiking – digested read|last=Crace|first=John|date=2016-09-11|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-05-25|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hygge: The Danish Art of Happiness'' by [[Marie Tourell Søderberg]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31129745-hygge|title=Hygge|website=Goodreads|access-date=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Book of Hygge: The Danish Art of Living Well'' by Louisa Thomsen Brits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/29/book-of-hygge-louisa-thomsen-brits-review|title=The Book of Hygge review – can the Danes really teach us how to live?|last=Williams|first=Zoe|date=2016-09-29|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-05-25|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Broadway musical [[Frozen (musical)|Frozen]], there is a song called ‘Hygge’, which is all about being comfortable.

In Australian soap opera ''[[Neighbours]]'', [[Jemima Davies-Smythe]] incorporates Hygge into a resdesign of her half-brother [[Karl Kennedy]]'s living room.

'''Hypomnema''' (Greek. ὑπόμνημα,  plural ὑπομνήματα, ''hypomnemata''), also spelled '''hupomnema''', is a [[Greek language|Greek]] word with several translations into English including a reminder, a note, a public record, a commentary, an anecdotal record, a draft, a copy, and other variations on those terms.&lt;ref&gt;([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%23108803  Liddell and Scott Greek-English Lexicon online])&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plato]]'s theory of [[Anamnesis (philosophy)|anamnesis]] recognized the new status of [[writing]] as a device of artificial [[memory]], and he developed the hypomnesic principles for his students to follow in the [[Academy]]. According to Michel Foucault, "The hypomnemata constituted a material memory of things read, heard, or thought, thus offering these as an accumulated treasure for rereading and later [[meditation]].
They also formed a raw material for the writing of more systematic treatises in which were given arguments and means by which to struggle against some defect (such as anger, envy, gossip, flattery) or to overcome some difficult circumstance (a mourning, an exile, downfall, disgrace)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Foucault|first1=Michel|title=Ethics: Subjectivity and Truth|date=1997|publisher=The New Press|location=New York|page=273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern usage ==
[[Michel Foucault]] uses the word in the sense of "note", but his translators use the word "notebook", which is [[anachronism|anachronistic]] (see [[codex]] and [[wax tablet]]). Concerning [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]'s discipline of self-knowledge, Foucault writes: "In this period there was a culture of what could be called personal writing: taking notes on the reading, conversations, and reflections that one hears or engages in oneself; keeping kinds of [[notebook]]s on important subjects (what the Greeks call 'hupomnemata'), which must be reread from time to time so as to reactualize their contents."&lt;ref&gt;"The Hermeneutics of the Subject: Lectures at the College de France 1981-1982" Foucault, Michel, Picador, p. 500&lt;/ref&gt; In an [http://foucault.info/documents/foucault.hypoMnemata.en.html excerpt from an ''Interview with Michel Foucault'' in ''The Foucault Reader''], he says: "As personal as they were, the hypomnemata must nevertheless not be taken for intimate diaries or for those accounts of spiritual experience (temptations, struggles, falls, and victories) which can be found in later [[Christian]] literature. [... T]heir objective is not to bring the arcana conscientiae to light, the confession of which—be it oral or written—has a purifying value."

'''''Hypotheses non fingo''''' ([[Latin]] for "I feign no hypotheses", "I frame no [[Hypothesis|hypotheses]]", or "I contrive no hypotheses") is a famous phrase used by [[Isaac Newton]] in an essay, "[[General Scholium]]", which was appended to the second (1713) edition of the ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]''.

Here is a modern translation (published 1999) of the passage containing this famous remark:
{{quote|I have not as yet been able to discover the reason for these properties of gravity from phenomena, and I do not feign hypotheses. For whatever is not deduced from the phenomena must be called a hypothesis; and hypotheses, whether metaphysical or physical, or based on occult qualities, or mechanical, have no place in experimental philosophy. In this philosophy particular propositions are inferred from the phenomena, and afterwards rendered general by induction.&lt;ref&gt;[[Isaac Newton]] (1726). ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', General Scholium. Third edition, page 943 of [[I. Bernard Cohen]] and Anne Whitman's 1999 translation, [[University of California Press]]  {{ISBN|0-520-08817-4}}, 974 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The nineteenth century philosopher of science, [[William Whewell]], qualified this statement, as, he said, "it was by such a use of hypotheses, that both Newton himself and [[Kepler]], on whose discoveries those of Newton were based, made their discoveries". Whewell stated:&lt;blockquote&gt;What is requisite is, that the hypotheses should be close to the facts, and not connected with them by other arbitrary and untried facts; and that the philosopher should be ready to resign it as soon as the facts refuse to confirm it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences|first=William|last=Whewell|date=1840|publisher=London|page=438|url=https://archive.org/stream/philosophyinduc00whewgoog#page/n450/mode/2up}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11864">'''Identification''' is a psychological process whereby the subject assimilates an aspect, property, or attribute of the other and is transformed wholly or partially by the model that other provides. It is by means of a series of identifications that the personality is constituted and specified. The roots of the concept can be found in [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]'s writings. The three most prominent concepts of identification as described by Freud are: primary identification, [[Narcissism of small differences|narcissistic]] (secondary) identification and partial (secondary) identification.&lt;ref name="laplanche"&gt;Laplanche, J. and Pontalis, J.-B. (1973), The language of psychoanalysis. The Hogarth Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

While "in the psychoanalytic literature there is agreement that the core meaning of identification is simple – to be like or to become like another", it has also been adjudged '"the most perplexing clinical/theoretical area" in psychoanalysis'.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Macmillan, ''Freud Evaluated'' (1997) p. 496 (quoting Rangell)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freud==

Freud first raised the matter of identification ({{lang-de|Identifizierung}}) in 1897, in connection with the illness or death of one's parents, and the response "to punish oneself in a hysterical fashion...with the same states [of illness] that they have had. The identification which occurs here is, as we can see, nothing other than a mode of thinking".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, quoted by Angela Richards "Editor's Note", ''On Metapsychology'' (Penguin Freud Library 11, 1987) p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; The question was taken up again psychoanalytically "in Ferenczi's article, 'Introjection and Transference', dating from 1909",&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Écrits: A Selection'' (London 1997) p. 250&lt;/ref&gt; but it was in the decade between "[[On Narcissism]]" (1914) and "[[The Ego and the Id]]" (1923) that Freud made his most detailed and intensive study of the concept.

Freud distinguished three main kinds of identification. "First, identification is the original form of emotional tie with an object; secondly, in a regressive way it becomes a substitute for a libidinal object-tie...and thirdly, it may arise with any new perception of a common quality which is shared with some other person".&lt;ref&gt;"[[Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego]]", in Sigmund Freud, ''civilisation, Society and Religion'' (Penguin Freud Library 12) p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;

===Primary identification===
Primary identification is the original and primitive form of [[attachment theory|emotional attachment]] to something or someone prior to any relations with other persons or objects:&lt;ref name="meissner"&gt;W.W. Meissner, 1970. Notes on Identification I. Origins in Freud, ''[[Psychoanalytic Quarterly]]'', 39, 563-589.&lt;/ref&gt; "an individual's first and most important identification, his identification with the father in his own personal prehistory...with the parents".&lt;ref&gt;"The Ego and the Id", ''Metapsychology'' p. 370&lt;/ref&gt; This means that when a baby is born he is not capable of making a distinction between himself and important others. The baby has an emotional attachment with his parents and experiences his parents as a part of himself. "The breast is part of me, I am the breast".

During this process of identification children adopt unconsciously the characteristics of their parents and begin to associate themselves with and copy the behavior of their parents. Freud remarked that identification should be distinguished from [[imitation]], which is a voluntary and conscious act. Because of this process of emotional attachment a child will develop a [[Super ego|(super)ego]] that has similarities to the moral values and guidelines by which the parents live their lives. By this process children become a great deal like their parents and this facilitates learning to live in the world and culture to which they are born.&lt;ref name="answers"&gt;http://www.answers.com/topic/identification (5 May 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

"By and large, psychoanalysts grant the importance and centrality of primary identification, even though...the concept varies 'according to each author and his ideas, its meaning in consequence being far from precise' ([[Horacio Etchegoyen|Etchegoyen]] 1985)".&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan, p. 497&lt;/ref&gt;

===Narcissistic (secondary) identification===
Narcissistic identification is the form of identification following abandonment or loss of an object. This experience of loss starts at a very young age.&lt;ref name="meissner" /&gt; An example: wearing the clothes or jewellery of a deceased loved one.&lt;ref name="Hart"&gt;Hart, H. H. (1947), Problems of Identification. Psychiatric Quarterly, 21, 274-293.&lt;/ref&gt; In "Mourning and Melancholia" Freud, having "shown that identification is a preliminary stage of object-choice", argued that the experience of loss set in motion a regressive process that "served to establish an ''identification'' of the ego with the abandoned object".&lt;ref&gt;''Metapsychology'' p. 258&lt;/ref&gt; In "The Ego and the Id", he went on to maintain that "this kind of substitution has a great share in determining the form taken by the ego and that it makes an essential contribution towards building up what is called its 'character'".&lt;ref&gt;''Metapsychology'' p. 368&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]], in his theory of [[The Imaginary (psychoanalysis)|the Imaginary]], would develop the latter point into his view of "the ego is constituted in its nucleus by a series of alienating identifications"&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Écrits'' (London 1996) p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; - part of his opposition to any concept of an "autonomous" and conflict-free ego.

===Partial (secondary) identification===
Partial identification is based on the perception of a special quality of another person.&lt;ref name="meissner" /&gt; This quality or ideal is often represented in a "leader figure" who is identified with. For example: the young boy identifies with the strong muscles of an older neighbour boy. Next to identification with the leader, people identify with others because they feel they have something in common. For example: a group of people who like the same music. This mechanism plays an important role in the formation of groups. It contributes to the development of character and the ego is formed by identification with a group (group norms). Partial identification promotes the social life of persons who will be able to identify with one another through this common bond to one another, instead of considering someone as a rival.&lt;ref name="answers" /&gt;

===Partial identification and empathy===

Freud went on to indicate the way "a path leads from identification by way of imitation to [[empathy]], that is, to the comprehension of the mechanism by which we are enabled to take up any attitude at all towards another mental life".&lt;ref&gt;''Civilization'' p. 140n&lt;/ref&gt; [[Otto Fenichel]] would go on to emphasize how "trial identifications for the purposes of empathy play a basic part in normal object relationships. They can be studied especially in analyzing the psychoanalyst's ways of working".&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 511&lt;/ref&gt; [[Object relations theory]] would subsequently highlight the use of "''trial identification with the patient in the session''"&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (London 1996) p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the growing technique of analysing from the [[countertransference]].

==Anna Freud and identification with the aggressor==

In her classic book ''The Ego and the Mechanism of Defence'', [[Anna Freud]] introduced "two original defence mechanisms...both of which have become classics of [[ego psychology]]",&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Appignanesi/John Forrester, ''Freud's Women'' ( London 1993) p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; the one being altruistic surrender, the other identification with the aggressor. Anna Freud pointed out that identification with parental values was a normal part of the development of the [[superego]]; but that "if the child introjects both rebuke and punishment and then regularly projects this same punishment on another, 'then he is arrested at an intermediate stage in the development of the superego'".&lt;ref&gt;Appignanesi, p. 294&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept was also taken up in object relations theory, which particularly explored "how a patient sometimes places the analyst in the role of victim whilst the patient acts out an identification with the aggressor"&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Casement, ''Further learning from the patient'' (london 1996) p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; in the analytic situation.

==With the analyst==

Mainstream analytic thought broadly agrees that interpretation took effect "by utilizing positive transference and transitory identifications with the analyst".&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 570&lt;/ref&gt;  More controversial, however, was the concept of "the terminal identification" at the close of analysis, where "that with which the patient identifies is their strong ego...[or] identification with the analyst's superego".&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Écrits'' p. 274 and p. 246&lt;/ref&gt;

Lacan took strong exception to "any analysis that one teaches as having to be terminated by identification with the analyst...There is a beyond to this identification...this crossing of the plane of identification".&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis'' (London 1994) p. 271-3&lt;/ref&gt; Most Lacanians have subsequently echoed his distrust of "the view of psychoanalysis that relies on identification with the analyst as a central curative factor".&lt;ref&gt;John P. Muller, ''Beyond the Psychoanalytic Dyad'' (1996) p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; How far the same criticism applies, however, to those who see as a positive therapeutic result "the development of a self-analytic attitude...[built on] identification with and internalization of the analyst's analytic attitude"&lt;ref&gt;Alan S. Gurman, ''Essential Psychotherapies'' (2003) p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; is not perhaps quite clear.

[[Marion Milner]] has argued that "terminal identification" can be most acute in those analysands who go on to become therapists themselves: "by the mere fact of becoming analysts we have succeeded in bypassing an experience which our patients have to go through. We have chosen to identify with our analyst's profession and to act out that identification".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Janet Malcolm, ''Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession'' (London 1988) p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

==In psychoanalytic thinking today==
Much has been written on identification since Freud. Identification has been seen both as a normal developmental mechanism and as a [[Defence mechanism|mechanism of defence]].&lt;ref name="sandler"&gt;{{cite book | last=Sandler | first=J. | title=Projection, Identification, Projective Identification. | publisher=International Universities Press, Inc., Madison Connecticut. | year=1987 | isbn=0823643700}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many types of identification have been described by other psychoanalysts, including counter-identification (Fliess,1953),&lt;ref name="sandler" /&gt; pseudoidentification (Eidelberg, 1938),&lt;ref name="sandler" /&gt; concordant and complementary identifications (Racker, 1957),&lt;ref name="sandler" /&gt; and adhesive identification (Bick, 1968):&lt;ref name="sandler" /&gt; "the work of Bick and others on adhesive identification, exploring the concept of the [[Didier Anzieu|'psychic skin']]".&lt;ref&gt;Judith Mitrani and Joyce McDougall, ''A Framework for the Imaginary'' (London 2008) p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7472">An '''implied license''' is an unwritten [[license]] which permits a party (the licensee) to do something that would normally require the express permission of another party (the licensor). Implied licenses may arise by [[operation of law]] from actions by the licensor which lead the licensee to believe that it has the necessary permission.

Implied licenses often arise where the licensee has purchased a physical embodiment of some [[intellectual property]] belonging to the licensor, or has paid for its creation, but has not obtained permission to use the intellectual property.

==Examples==
* A person who purchases a record album does not explicitly purchase a right to ''perform'' that album by playing it on a record player, but this right is implied.&lt;ref&gt;"An incident to the purchase of any article, whether patented or unpatented, is the right to use and sell it...." [[United States v. Univis Lens Co.]], 316 U.S. 241, 249 (1942); see also Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co., 377 U.S. 476, 484 (1964) ("[I]t is fundamental that sale of a patented article by the patentee or under his authority carries with it an 'implied license to use.'") (quoting Adams v. Burke, 84 U.S. (17 Wall.) 453, 456 (1873)).&lt;/ref&gt;
* A person or entity that purchases computer software in a suite. Software that is individually purchased, or not included in the suite is protected by a single license &amp; and not part of a implied license.
* A person who posts a lengthy comment to an [[internet forum]] may claim copyright to that post. However, if posters in that forum commonly copy the entire text to which they are responding into a later post, the original poster will be deemed to have given an implied license for his text to be copied into the later post.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}
* In a non-IP context, a person who holds a party on their house gives all of the invited guests an implied license to enter their property, and to enter those parts of the property that would usually be made available to guests, such as the bathrooms.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}
* In patent law, where an employee invents something while on company time, the employer receives an implied license to use the invention, even if no [[contract]] exists to assign rights to the employer. This is sometimes referred to as [[shop right]].&lt;ref&gt;United States v. Dubilier Condenser Corp., 289 U.S. 178 (1933); Lariscey v. United States, 949 F.2d 1137 (Fed. Cir. 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; In copyright law, the work for hire provision would grant the employer copyright to the work, provided the invention is within the employee's job description.&lt;ref&gt;Section 101, Copyright Act of 1976 (USC 17 §101)&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2008, the Ninth US Circuit held that a non-exclusive license to use copyrighted material can be granted by implied license, but not an exclusive license. Further, if the creator has received consideration for the work, the non-exclusive grant is irrevocable.&lt;ref&gt;[[Asset Marketing Systems, Inc. v. Gagnon]], 542 F.3d 748 (9th Cir. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Where a [[copyright]]ed work has been commissioned, the law in the United Kingdom is that the creator retains rights in the commissioned work. Unauthorised use of the work would therefore infringe the creator's copyright. Nevertheless, the commissioner may have an implied license to use the commissioned work, although only for the particular purpose under which the commission was originally agreed.&lt;ref&gt;Blair v Osborn and Tomkins [1971] 2 WLR 503&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Bainbridge, Intellectual Property, 1999 (4th ed.), pp.84-85&lt;/ref&gt;
* A U.S. court has   ruled in Jan 19th 2006 that [[Web cache|Web caching]] does not constitute a copyright violation, because of ''fair use'' and an ''implied license''. Was the "Field vs Google, US District Court, District of Nevada, CV-S-04-0413-RCJ-LRL". In that context ''implied license'' refers to a [[de facto standard|''de facto'' standard]]: if the copyright holder does not use any no-archive tags and robot exclusion standards to prevent caching.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.webcitation.org/faq&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implication: from surrounding circumstances or by operation of law?==

In the United States, implied licenses are usually considered to be of two kinds: either they reflect the intention of the parties, which is inferred from a fact-specific inquiry into the surrounding circumstances, or else they are constructive agreements, in which case the intention of the parties is likely to be immaterial. In reality, there is a continuum between these kinds of implied license and it may be difficult to determine whether the license or contract in question is one which the law implies, irrespective of any protests by the unwilling licensor, or instead one inferred from the whole pattern of factual circumstances including the evidence of intent.

In England, there is more of a tendency to regard all implied licenses as matters of fact and intent, while what would be a license implied by law in the US is treated under some other branch of substantive law such as the [[doctrine of non-derogation from grants]].&lt;ref&gt;An illustrative case is [[British Leyland Motor Corp. v. Armstrong Patents Co.]], [1986] A.C. 577, [1986] All E.R. 850 (H.L.). The opinion by [[Sydney Templeman, Baron Templeman|Lord Templeman]] in that case pointed out that an implied license might be negatived by express language, under principles of freedom of contract, but that was not so when non-derogation instead is involved: “The right cannot be withheld by the manufacturer of the car by contract with the first purchaser and cannot be withheld from any subsequent owner.” That is, the nature of property makes the right inherent and not a matter of freedom of contract. It is thus seen that the effect is comparable to the US license that is implied by operation of law.&lt;/ref&gt;

In both countries, the [[exhaustion doctrine]] has the effect of creating an implied license to use a product sold under the "authority" of the patentee. It is controversial whether and to what extent contractual expedients can successfully limit the scope of such implied licenses.

==Express license==
The opposite of an implied license is an ''express license'', which, for some forms of intellectual property, must be in writing. Oral exclusive licenses were permitted, however, under US copyright law before 1978.&lt;ref&gt;See Davis v. Blige, 505 F.3d 90, 108 (2d Cir. 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Oral nonexclusive copyright licenses remain valid under US law.&lt;ref&gt;See Vincent v. City Colleges of Chicago, 485 F.3d 919, 922 (7th Cir. 2007); Bateman v. Mnemonics, Inc., 79 F.3d 1532, 1538 n.12 (11th Cir. 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; Patent licenses may be oral.&lt;ref&gt;Waymark Corp. v. Porta Systems Corp., 334 F.3d 1358, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2003); Enzo APA &amp; Son v. Geapag A.G., 134 F.3d 1090, 1093 (Fed. Cir. 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; Licenses under the [[Semiconductor Chip Protection Act]] must be in writing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap9.html#903  Section 903(b)] of the Act, 17 U.S.C. § 903(b), provides: "The owner of the exclusive rights in a mask work may transfer all of those rights, or license all or less than all of those rights, by any written instrument signed by such owner or a duly authorized agent of the owner."&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Emotion}}

'''Jealousy''' generally refers to the thoughts or feelings of insecurity, fear, concern, and envy over relative lack of possessions, status or something of great personal value, particularly in reference to a comparator, a rival, or a competitor. 

Jealousy can consist of one or more emotions such as [[anger]], [[resentment]], inadequacy{{how|date=October 2018}}, helplessness or [[disgust]]. In its original meaning, ''jealousy'' is distinct from [[envy]], though the two terms have popularly become synonymous in the [[English language]], with ''jealousy'' now also taking on the definition originally used for envy alone.

Jealousy is a typical experience in [[Interpersonal relationship|human relationships]], and it has been observed in infants as young as five months.&lt;ref name="Draghi-Lorenz,2000"&gt;Draghi-Lorenz, R. (2000). Five-month-old infants can be jealous: Against cognitivist [[solipsism]].

[https://books.google.com/books?id=eEXfY9SD2ycC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;lpg=PA61&amp;dq=lobi+africa+jealousy&amp;source=web&amp;ots=9IoGYkIPeV&amp;sig=K4HcJ7u6vChouLCYR6XBDG52jA8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ct=result The Psychology of Jealousy and Envy]. 1991. {{ISBN|978-0-89862-555-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jealousy can either be '''suspicious''' or '''reactive''',&lt;ref&gt;Rydell RJ, Bringle RG Differentiating reactive and suspicious jealousy ''Social Behavior and Personality An International Journal'' 35(8):1099-1114 Jan 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and it is often reinforced as a series of particularly strong emotions and constructed as a universal human experience. [[Psychologist]]s have proposed several models to study the processes underlying jealousy and have identified factors that result in jealousy. [[Sociologist]]s have demonstrated that cultural beliefs and values play an important role in determining what triggers jealousy and what constitutes socially acceptable expressions of jealousy. [[Biologist]]s have identified factors that may unconsciously influence the expression of jealousy.

Throughout history, artists have also explored the theme of jealousy in photographs, paintings, films, songs, plays, poems, and books, and [[theologian]]s have offered religious views of jealousy based on the scriptures of their respective faiths.

== Sexual jealousy ==
{{main|Sexual jealousy}}

Sexual jealousy may be triggered when a person's significant other displays sexual interest in another person.&lt;ref name="BuunkHupka"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Buunk | first1 = Bram | last2 = Hupka | first2 = Ralph B | year = 1987 | title = Cross-Cultural Differences in the Elicitation of Sexual Jealousy | url = | journal = The Journal of Sexual Research | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 12–22 | doi=10.1080/00224498709551338}}&lt;/ref&gt; The feeling of jealousy  may be just as powerful if one partner suspects the other is guilty of [[infidelity]]. Fearing that their partner will experience sexual jealousy the person who has been unfaithful may lie about their actions in order to protect their partner. Experts often believe that sexual jealousy is in fact a biological imperative. It may be part of a mechanism by which humans and other animals ensure access to the best reproductive partners.

It seems that male jealousy in heterosexual relationships may be influenced by their female partner's phase in her menstrual cycle. In the period around and shortly before ovulation, males are found to display more mate-retention tactics, which are linked to jealousy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.robertburriss.com/pdfs/burriss_06_ehb.pdf|title = Effects of partner conception risk phase of male perception of dominance in faces|last = Burriss, R., &amp; Little, A.|first = |date = 2006|journal = Evolution and Human Behavior|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a male is more likely to employ mate-retention tactics if their partner shows more interest in other males, which is more likely to occur in the pre-ovulation phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1690982/pdf/12028782.pdf|pmc = 1690982|title = Changes in women’s sexual interest and their partner's mate retention tactics across the menstrual cycle: evidence for shifting conflicts of interest|last = Gangestad, S.

== Romantic jealousy ==
Romantic jealousy arises as a result of romantic interest. It is defined as “''a complex of thoughts, feelings, and actions that follow threats to self-esteem and/or threats to the existence or quality of the relationship when those threats are generated by the perception of a real or potential romantic attraction between one's partner and a (perhaps imaginary) rival.''”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=White|first=Gregory L.|date=1 December 1981|title=A model of romantic jealousy|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00992549|journal=Motivation and Emotion|language=en|volume=5|issue=4|pages=295–310|doi=10.1007/BF00992549|issn=0146-7239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different from sexual jealousy, romantic jealousy is triggered by threats to self and relationship (rather than sexual interest in another person). Factors, such as feelings of inadequacy as a partner, sexual exclusivity, and having put relatively more effort into the relationship, are positively related to relationship jealousy in both genders.

=== Communicative responses ===
As romantic jealousy is a complicated reaction that has multiple components, i.e., thoughts, feelings, and actions, one aspect of romantic jealousy that is under study is communicative responses. Communicative responses serve three critical functions in a romantic relationship, i.e., reducing uncertainty, maintaining or repairing relationship, and restoring self-esteem.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guerrero|first=Laura K.|last2=Andersen|first2=Peter A.|last3=Jorgensen|first3=Peter F.|last4=Spitzberg|first4=Brian H.|last5=Eloy|first5=Sylvie V.|date=1 December 1995|title=Coping with the green‐eyed monster: Conceptualizing and measuring communicative responses to romantic jealousy|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10570319509374523|journal=Western Journal of Communication|volume=59|issue=4|pages=270–304|doi=10.1080/10570319509374523|issn=1057-0314}}&lt;/ref&gt; If done properly, communicative responses can lead to more satisfying relationships after experiencing romantic jealousy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Salovey|first=Peter|last2=Rodin|first2=Judith|date=1 March 1988|title=Coping with Envy and Jealousy|url=http://guilfordjournals.com/doi/abs/10.1521/jscp.1988.7.1.15|journal=Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology|volume=7|issue=1|pages=15–33|doi=10.1521/jscp.1988.7.1.15|issn=0736-7236}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bringle|first=Robert G|last2=Renner|first2=Patricia|last3=Terry|first3=Roger L|last4=Davis|first4=Susan|date=1 September 1983|title=An analysis of situation and person components of jealousy|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0092656683900260|journal=Journal of Research in Personality|volume=17|issue=3|pages=354–368|doi=10.1016/0092-6566(83)90026-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two subsets of communicative responses: interactive responses and general behavior responses. Interactive responses is face-to-face and partner-directed while general behavior responses may not occur interactively.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Guerrero and colleagues further categorize multiple types of communicative responses of romantic jealousy. Interactive responses can be broken down to six types falling in different places on continua of threat and directness:
* Avoidance/Denial (low threat and low directness). ''Example: becoming silent; pretending nothing is wrong.''
* Integrative Communication (low threat and high directness). ''Example: explaining feelings; calmly questioning partner.''
* Active Distancing (medium threat and medium directness). ''Example: decreasing affection.''
* Negative Affect Expression (medium threat and medium directness). ''Example: venting frustration; crying or sulking.''
* Distributive Communication (high threat and high directness). ''Example: acting rude; making hurtful or abrasive comments.''
* Violent Communication/Threats (high threat and high directness). ''Example: using physical force.'' 
Guerrero and colleagues have also proposed five general behavior responses. The five sub-types differ in whether a response is 1) directed at partner or rival(s), 2) directed at discovery or repair, and 3) positively or negatively valenced:
* Surveillance/ Restriction (rival-targeted, discovery-oriented, commonly negatively valenced). ''Example: observing rival; trying to restrict contact with partner.''
* Rival Contacts (rival-targeted, discovery-oriented/repair-oriented, commonly negatively valenced). ''Example: confronting rival.''
* Manipulation Attempts (partner-targeted, repair-oriented, negatively valenced). ''Example: tricking partner to test loyalty; trying to make partner feel guilty.''
* Compensatory Restoration (partner-targeted, repair-oriented, commonly positively valenced). ''Example: sending flowers to partner.''
* Violent Behavior (-, -, negatively valenced). ''Example: slamming doors.''
While some of these communicative responses are destructive and aggressive, e.g., distributive communication and active distancing, some individuals respond to jealousy in a more constructive way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guerrero|first=Laura K.|last2=Trost|first2=Melanie R.|last3=Yoshimura|first3=Stephen M.|date=1 June 2005|title=Romantic jealousy: Emotions and communicative responses|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1350-4126.2005.00113.x/abstract|journal=Personal Relationships|language=en|volume=12|issue=2|pages=233–252|doi=10.1111/j.1350-4126.2005.00113.x|issn=1475-6811}}&lt;/ref&gt; Integrative communication, compensatory restoration, and negative affect expression have been shown to lead to positive relation outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bevan|first=Jennifer L.|last2=Lannutti|first2=Pamela J.|date=1 June 2002|title=The experience and expression of romantic jealousy in same‐sex and opposite‐sex romantic relationships|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08824090209384854|journal=Communication Research Reports|volume=19|issue=3|pages=258–268|doi=10.1080/08824090209384854|issn=0882-4096}}&lt;/ref&gt; One factor that affects the type of communicative responses elicited in an individual is emotions. Jealousy anger is associated with more aggressive communicative response while irritation tends to lead to more constructive communicative behaviors.

== Gender-based differences ==

According to the Parental Investment Model based on [[parental investment]] theory, more men than women ratify sex differences in jealousy. In addition, more women over men consider emotional infidelity (fear of abandonment) as more distressing than sexual infidelity.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} According to the attachment theory, sex and attachment style makes significant and unique interactive contributions to the distress experienced. Security within the relationship also heavily contributes to one’s level of distress. These findings imply that psychological and cultural mechanisms regarding sex differences may play a larger role than expected (Levy, Blatt, Schachner.) The attachment theory also claims to reveal how infants' attachment patterns are the basis for self-report measures of adult attachment. (Levy, Blatt &amp; Shaner, 1998). Although there are no sex differences in childhood attachment, individuals with dismissing behavior were more concerned with the sexual aspect of relationships (Schachner &amp; shaer, 2004). As a coping mechanism these individuals would report sexual infidelity as more harmful. Moreover, research shows that  audit attachment styles strongly  conclude with the type of infidelity that occurred. Thus psychological and cultural mechanisms are implied as unvarying differences in jealousy that play a role in sexual attachment.&lt;ref&gt;Rydell, McConnell, Bringle 2004, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Emotional jealousy was predicted to be nine times more responsive in females than in males. The emotional jealousy predicted in females also held turn to state that females experiencing emotional jealousy are more violent than men experiencing emotional jealousy.

There are distinct emotional responses to gender differences in romantic relationships (Buss, Green &amp; Saboni 2004). For example, due to paternity uncertainty in males, jealousy increases in  males over sexual infidelity rather than emotional. According to research more  women are likely to be upset by signs of resource withdraw (i.e. another female) than by sexual infidelity.  A large amount of data{{which|date=April 2013}} supports this notion. However, one must consider  for jealousy the life stage or experience one encounters in reference to the diverse responses to infidelity available. Research states that a componential view of jealousy consist of specific set of emotions that serve  the reproductive role.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} However, research shows that both men and women would be equally angry and point the blame for sexual infidelity, but women would be more hurt by emotional infidelity. Despite this fact, anger surfaces   when both parties involved is responsible for some type of uncontrollable behavior, sexual conduct is not exempt. (Sabbini and Silver, Averill 1995). Some behavior and actions are controllable such as sexual behavior. However hurt feelings are activated by relationship deviation. No evidence is known to be sexually dimorphic in both college and adult convenience samples. The Jealousy Specific Innate Model (JSIM) proved to not be innate, but may be sensitive to situational factors. As a result, it may only activate at stages in on. One study discovered serious relationships are reserved for older adults rather than undergraduates.  For example, Buss ''et al.'' (1992) predicted that male jealousy decreases as females reproductive values decreases.

A second possibility that the JSIM effect is not innate but is from one culture (Desieno ''et al.'', 2002) Kitayana (2004) have highlighted differences in socio-economic status specific such as the divide between high school and collegiate individuals. Moreover, individuals of both genders were angrier and blamed their partners more for sexual infidelities but were more hurt by emotional (Sabini &amp; Green 2004). Jealousy is composed of lower-level emotional states (e.g., anger and hurt) which may be triggered by a variety of events, not by differences in individuals' life stage. Although research has recognized the importance of early childhood experiences for the development of competence in intimate relationships, early family environment is recently being examined as well (Richardson and Guyer, 1998). Research on self-esteem and attachment theory  suggest that individuals internalize early experiences within the family which subconsciously translates into their personal view of worth of themselves and the value of being close to other individuals, especially in an interpersonal relationship (Steinberg, Davila, &amp; Fincham, 2006).&lt;ref&gt;Green, Sabini 2006, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

== In animals ==

A study by researches at the University of California, San Diego, replicated jealousy studies done on humans on canines.  They reported, in a paper published in PLOS ONE in 2014, that  a significant number of dogs exhibited jealous behaviors when their human companions paid attention to dog-like toys, compared to when their human companions paid attention to nonsocial objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Jealousy in Dogs|url = http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0094597|journal = PLoS ONE|date = 23 July 2014|pmc = 4108309|pmid = 25054800|pages = e94597|volume = 9|issue = 7|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0094597|first = Christine R.|last = Harris|first2 = Caroline|last2 = Prouvost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==

The word stems from the French ''jalousie'', formed from ''jaloux'' (jealous), and further from  [[Vulgar Latin|Low Latin]] ''zelosus'' (full of zeal), in turn from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|ζήλος}} (''zēlos''), sometimes "jealousy", but more often in a positive sense "emulation, ardour, zeal"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=jealousy&amp;searchmode=none Jealous], Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2346217 Zelos], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, "A Greek-English Lexicon", at Perseus
&lt;/ref&gt;

Since [[William Shakespeare]]'s use of terms like "green-eyed monster",&lt;ref&gt;''[[Othello]]'', Act III, Scene 3, 170&lt;/ref&gt; the color green has been associated with jealousy and envy, from which the expressions "green with envy", are derived.

== Theories ==

=== Scientific definitions ===

People do not express jealousy through a single emotion or a single behavior.&lt;ref name="Darwin,1872"&gt;Darwin, C. (1872). The Expression of Emotions in Man and Animals.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clanton, Smith"&gt;Clanton, G. &amp; Smith, L. (1977) Jealousy. New Jersey: Prentice- Hall, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Buunk,1984"&gt;Bram Buunk, B. (1984). Jealousy as related to attributions for the partner's behavior. [[Social psychology|Social Psychology]] Quarterly, 47, 107–112.&lt;/ref&gt;
They instead express jealousy through diverse emotions and behaviors, which makes it difficult to form a scientific definition of jealousy. Scientists instead define jealousy in their own words, as illustrated by the following examples:
&lt;blockquote&gt;

* "Romantic jealousy is here defined as a complex of thoughts, feelings, and actions which follow threats to [[self-esteem]] and/or threats to the existence or quality of the relationship, when those threats are generated by the perception of potential attraction between one's partner and a (perhaps imaginary) rival." (White, 1981, p. 24)&lt;ref name="White,1981"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = White | first1 = G.L. | year = 1981 | title = Jealousy and partner's perceived motives for attraction to a rival | url = | journal = Social Psychology Quarterly | volume = 44 | issue = | pages = 24–30 | doi=10.2307/3033859}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

* "Jealousy, then, is any aversive reaction that occurs as the result of a partner's extradyadic relationship that is considered likely to occur." (Bringle &amp; Buunk, 1991, page 135)&lt;ref name="Bringle, Buunk"&gt;Bringle, R.G. &amp; Buunk, B.P. (1991). Extradyadic relationships and [[sexual jealousy]].  In K. McKinney and S. Sprecher (Eds.), Sexuality in Close Relationships (pp. 135-153) Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

* "Jealousy is conceptualized as a cognitive, emotional, and behavioral response to a relationship threat. In the case of sexual jealousy, this threat emanates from knowing or suspecting that one's partner has had (or desires to have) [[Human sexual behavior|sexual activity]] with a third party. In the case of emotional jealousy, an individual feels threatened by her or his partner's emotional involvement with and/or love for a third party." (Guerrero, Spitzberg, &amp; Yoshimura, 2004, page 311)&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Spitzberg, Yoshimura,2004"&gt;Guerrero, L.K., Spitzberg, B.H., &amp; Yoshimura, S.M. (2004).  Sexual and Emotional Jealousy.  In J.H. Harvey, S. Sprecher, and A. Wenzel (Eds.), The Handbook of Sexuality in Close Relationships (pp. 311-345). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

* "Jealousy is defined as a defensive reaction to a perceived threat to a valued relationship, arising from a situation in which the partner's involvement with an activity and/or another person is contrary to the jealous person's definition of their relationship." (Bevan, 2004, page 195)&lt;ref name="Bevan,2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bevan | first1 = J.L. | year = 2004 | title = General partner and relational uncertainty as consequences of another person's jealousy expression | url = | journal = Western Journal of Communication | volume = 68 | issue = | pages = 195–218 | doi=10.1080/10570310409374796}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

* "Jealousy is triggered by the threat of separation from, or loss of, a romantic partner, when that threat is attributed to the possibility of the partner's romantic interest in another person." (Sharpteen &amp; Kirkpatrick, 1997, page 628)&lt;ref name="Sharpsteen, Kirkpatrick"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sharpsteen | first1 = D.J. | last2 = Kirkpatrick | first2 = L.A. | year = 1997 | title = Romantic jealousy and adult romantic attachment | url = | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 72 | issue = | pages = 627–640 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.72.3.627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
These definitions of jealousy share two basic themes. First, all the definitions imply a triad composed of a jealous individual, a partner, and a perception of a third party or rival. Second, all the definitions describe jealousy as a reaction to a perceived threat to the relationship between two people, or a dyad. Jealous reactions typically involve aversive emotions and/or behaviors that are assumed to be protective for their attachment relationships. These themes form the essential meaning of jealousy in most scientific studies.

==== Comparison with envy ====

Popular culture uses the word jealousy as a synonym for [[envy]]. Many dictionary definitions include a reference to envy or envious feelings. In fact, the overlapping use of jealousy and envy has a long history.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The terms are used indiscriminately in such popular 'feelgood' books as Nancy Friday's ''Jealousy'', where the expression 'jealousy' applies to a broad range of passions, from envy to lust and greed. While this kind of usage blurs the boundaries between categories that are intellectually valuable and psychologically justifiable, such confusion is understandable in that historical explorations of the term indicate that these boundaries have long posed problems. Margot Grzywacz's fascinating etymological survey of the word in Romance and [[Germanic languages]]&lt;ref&gt;Margot Grzywacz, "Eifersucht" in den romanischen Sprachen (Bochum-Langendreer, Germany: H. Pöppinghaus, 1937), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; asserts, indeed, that the concept was one of those that proved to be the most difficult to express in language and was therefore among the last to find an unambiguous term. [[Classical Latin]] used ''invidia'', without strictly differentiating between envy and jealousy. It was not until the postclassical era that Latin borrowed the late and poetic Greek word ''zelotypia'' and the associated adjective ''zelosus''. It is from this adjective that are derived French ''jaloux'', Provençal ''gelos'', Italian ''geloso'', and Spanish ''celoso''. (Lloyd, 1995, [https://books.google.com/books?id=71snX5ZkX10C&amp;pg=PA4 page 4])&lt;ref name="Lloyd"&gt;Lloyd, R. (1995). Closer &amp; Closer Apart: Jealousy in Literature. Ithaca, NY: [[Cornell University|Cornell University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Perhaps the overlapping use of jealousy and envy occurs because people can experience both at the same time. A person may envy the characteristics or possessions of someone who also happens to be a romantic rival.&lt;ref name="Parrot, Smith"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Parrot | first1 = W.G. | last2 = Smith | first2 = R.H. | year = 1993 | title = Distinguishing the experiences of envy and jealousy | url = | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 64 | issue = | pages = 906–920 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.64.6.906}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, one may even interpret romantic jealousy as a form of envy.&lt;ref name="Kristjansson,2002"&gt;Kristjansson, K. (2002). Justifying Emotions: Pride and Jealousy.&lt;/ref&gt; A jealous person may envy the affection that his or her partner gives to a rival — affection the jealous person feels entitled to himself or herself. People often use the word jealousy as a broad label that applies to both experiences of jealousy and experiences of envy.&lt;ref name="Smith, Kim, Parrott"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = R.H. | last2 = Kim | first2 = S.H. | last3 = Parrott | first3 = W.G. | year = 1988 | title = Envy and jealousy: Semantic problems and experiential distinctions | url = | journal = [[Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin]] | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 401–409 | doi=10.1177/0146167288142017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although popular culture often uses jealousy and envy as synonyms, modern philosophers and psychologists have argued for conceptual distinctions between jealousy and envy. For example, philosopher [[John Rawls]]&lt;ref name="Rawls"&gt;Rawls, J. (1971). [[A Theory of Justice]]. Cambridge, Massachusetts: [[Harvard University Press|Belknap Press]] of Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; distinguishes between jealousy and envy on the ground that jealousy involves the wish to keep what one has, and envy the wish to get what one does not have. Thus, a child is jealous of her parents' attention to a sibling, but envious of her friend's new bicycle. Psychologists Laura Guerrero and Peter Andersen have proposed the same distinction.&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen"&gt;Guerrero, L.K., &amp; Andersen, P.A. (1998). The dark side of jealousy and envy: desire, delusion, desperation, and destructive communication. In W.R. Cupach and B.H. Spitzberg (Eds.), The Dark Side of Close Relationships, (pp. ). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; They claim the jealous person "perceives that he or she possesses a valued relationship, but is in danger of losing it or at least of having it altered in an undesirable manner," whereas the envious person "does not possess a valued commodity, but wishes to possess it." Gerrod Parrott draws attention to the distinct thoughts and feelings that occur in jealousy and envy.&lt;ref name="Parrot 92"&gt;Parrott, W.G. (1992). The emotional experiences of envy and jealousy. In [[Peter Salovey|P. Salovey]] (Ed.), The Psychology of Jealousy and Envy (pp. 3–29). New York, NY: The Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Staff"&gt;{{Citation|last=Staff |first=P.T. |title=A devastating difference |journal=Psychology Today |date=Jan–Feb 1994 |id=Document ID 1544 |accessdate=2006-07-08 |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/pto-19940101-000017.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427112226/http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/pto-19940101-000017.html |archivedate=27 April 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The common experience of '''jealousy''' for many people may involve:

:* Fear of loss
:* Suspicion of or anger about a perceived betrayal
:* Low self-esteem and sadness over perceived loss
:* Uncertainty and loneliness
:* Fear of losing an important person to another
:* Distrust

The experience of '''envy''' involves:

:* Feelings of inferiority
:* Longing
:* Resentment of circumstances
:* Ill will towards envied person often accompanied by guilt about these feelings
:* Motivation to improve
:* Desire to possess the attractive rival's qualities
:* Disapproval of feelings

Parrot acknowledges that people can experience envy and jealousy at the same time. Feelings of envy about a rival can even intensify the experience of jealousy.&lt;ref name="Pines, Aronson,1983"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pines | first1 = A. | last2 = Aronson | first2 = E. | year = 1983 | title = Antecedents, correlates, and consequences of sexual jealousy | url = | journal = Journal of Personality | volume = 51 | issue = | pages = 108–136 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1983.tb00857.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the differences between envy and jealousy in terms of thoughts and feelings justify their distinction in philosophy and science.

=== In psychology ===

Jealousy involves an entire "emotional episode," including a complex "narrative": the circumstances that lead up to jealousy, jealousy itself as emotion, any attempt at [[Self control|self regulation]], subsequent actions and events and the resolution of the episode (Parrott, 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;306). The narrative can originate from experienced facts,  thoughts, perceptions, memories, but also imagination, guess and assumptions. The more society and culture matter in the formation of these factors, the more jealousy can have a social and cultural origin. By contrast, Goldie (2000, p.&amp;nbsp;228) shows how jealousy can be a "cognitively impenetrable state", where education and rational belief matter very little.

One possible explanation of the origin of jealousy in [[evolutionary psychology]] is that the emotion evolved in order to maximize the success of our genes: it is a biologically based emotion (Prinz after Buss and Larsen, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;120) selected to foster the certainty about the paternity of one’s own offspring. A jealous behavior, in men, is directed into avoiding sexual betrayal and a consequent waste of resources and effort in taking care of someone else’s offspring. There are, additionally, cultural or social explanations of the origin of jealousy. According to one, the narrative from which jealousy arises can be in great part made by the imagination. Imagination is strongly affected by a person's cultural milieu. The pattern of reasoning, the way one perceives situations, depends strongly on cultural context. It has elsewhere been suggested that jealousy is in fact a secondary emotion in reaction to one's needs not being met, be those needs for attachment, attention, reassurance or any other form of care that would be otherwise expected to arise from that primary romantic relationship.

While mainstream psychology considers [[sexual arousal]] through jealousy a [[paraphilia]], some authors on sexuality (Serge Kreutz, ''Instrumental Jealousy'') have argued that jealousy in manageable dimensions can have a definite positive effect on [[sexual function]] and sexual satisfaction. Studies have also shown that jealousy sometimes heightens passion towards partners and increases the intensity of passionate sex.&lt;ref&gt;Emotions and sexuality. In K. McKinney and S. Sprecher (Eds.), ''Sexuality, in close relationships'' (pp. 49–70). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pines"&gt;Pines, A. (1992). ''Romantic jealousy: Understanding and conquering the shadow of love''. New York: St. Martin's Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jealousy in children and teenagers has been observed more often in those with low self-esteem and can evoke aggressive reactions. One such study suggested that developing intimate friends can be followed by emotional insecurity and loneliness in some children when those intimate friends interact with others. Jealousy is linked to aggression and low self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/feb05/jealousy.html |title=Study links jealousy with aggression, low self-esteem |publisher=Apa.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research by Sybil Hart, Ph.D., at Texas Tech University indicates that children are capable of feeling and displaying jealousy at as young as six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hart | first1 = S. | last2 = Carrington | first2 = H. | year = 2002 | title = Jealousy in six-month-old infants | url = | journal = Infancy | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 395–402 | doi=10.1207/s15327078in0303_6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infants showed signs of distress when their mothers focused their attention on a lifelike doll. This research could explain why children and infants show distress when a sibling is born, creating the foundation for sibling rivalry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hart | first1 = S. | last2 = Carrington | first2 = H. | last3 = Tronick | first3 = E. Z. | last4 = Carroll | first4 = S. | year = 2004 | title = When infants lose exclusive maternal attention: Is it jealousy? | url = | journal = Infancy | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 57–78 | doi=10.1207/s15327078in0601_3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In sociology ===
{{Main|Social aspects of jealousy}}

Anthropologists have claimed that jealousy varies across cultures. [[Cultural learning]] can influence the situations that trigger jealousy and the manner in which jealousy is expressed. Attitudes toward jealousy can also change within a culture over time. For example, attitudes toward jealousy changed substantially during the 1960s and 1970s in the United States. People in the United States adopted much more negative views about jealousy. As men and women became more equal it became less appropriate or acceptable to express jealousy.

=== In fiction, film, and art ===

[[File:Miyagawa Isshô-Spring Pastimes-H.jpg|thumb|275px|A Japanese painting from 1750 shows a young woman catching her lover reading a [[love letter]] from a [[Competition|rival]].]]

[[Jealousy in art|Artistic depictions of jealousy]] occur in fiction, films, and other art forms such as painting and sculpture. Jealousy is a common theme in literature, art, theatre, and film. Often, it is presented as a demonstration of particularly deep feelings of love, rather than a destructive obsession.

=== In religion ===
{{Main|Jealousy in religion}}

Jealousy in religion examines how the scriptures and teachings of various religions deal with the topic of jealousy. Religions may be compared and contrasted on how they deal with two issues: concepts of divine jealousy, and rules about the provocation and expression of human jealousy.

The Christian [[New Testament]] records that the Jewish [[Kohen|chief priests]] and elders had handed [[Jesus]] over to [[Pontius Pilate]] to be [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucified]] because they were jealous of his popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|27:18|NKJV}}; {{bibleverse||Mark|15:10|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kolcaba's theory of comfort''' explains comfort as a fundamental need of all human beings for relief, ease, or transcendence arising from health care situations that are stressful.&lt;ref&gt;Pinto, S., Caldeira, S., &amp; Martins, J. (2017). Evolutionary analysis of the concept of comfort.

Theoretical basis for nursing (4th ed.). Philadelphia, PA: [[Wolters Kluwer Health]]&lt;/ref&gt; The major concept within [[Katharine Kolcaba]]'s theory is the comfort. The other related concepts include caring, comfort measures, [[Holistic nursing|holistic]] care, health seeking behaviors, institutional integrity, and intervening variables.&lt;ref name=mcewen /&gt;

Kolcaba's theory successfully addresses the four elements of [[nursing]] metaparadigm.&lt;ref name=march&gt;March, A., &amp; McCormack, D. (2009).

'''Mayabheda''', ([[Sanskrit]]:मायाभेद:), means the breaching or removal of [[Avidya (Hinduism)|Avidya]] ("ignorance"). It means the destruction of the illusion caused by [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]] which occurs coinciding with the gain/dawn of Right Knowledge, the knowledge of [[Brahman]]. The [[Rig Veda]] [[Sukta]] R.V.X.177 addressed to Mayabheda in its three [[Mantra]]s in its own cryptic way serves this purpose. The central theme of this hymn is the discernment of [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]] or illusion, the cause of material creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Golden Book of Rig Veda|author=Mahendra Kulsreshta|publisher=Lotus Press|page=9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OIoRWGSfMikC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=mayabheda&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nbu2_jYEc_&amp;sig=dZSSmoKuGtOsnFA1oehkp3yH9Yw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DjgKUa60NMyNrgfOx4DQDg&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=mayabheda&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayabheda is also one of the [[Rigvedic deities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Echoes of Ancient Indian Wisdom|author=Shantha N.Nair|publisher=Pustak Mahalpage=95|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ekehXVP3W8wC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;lpg=PA95&amp;dq=mayabheda&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=onpqmD8P2h&amp;sig=NnEAytNH2aycwyb-4Bwd90GK3Ig&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hjwKUeyROpHqrQehs4HwBA&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=mayabheda&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==About Sukta R.V.X.177==

The [[Rig Veda]] is an ancient anthology of [[Sanskrit]] poems mostly in the form of prayers to the [[Vedic]] gods. It consists of Ten Books or [[Mandala]]s. The [[Mandala 10|Tenth Mandala]] contains 191 Suktas addressed to [[Agni]], [[Indra]] and many other deities. The [[Purusha sukta]] (R.V.90), the [[Hiranyagarbha sukta]] (R.V.X.121) and the [[Nasadiya Sukta]] (R.V.X.129) are a part of this Mandala in which there are many more important hymns.

The Tenth Mandala of the Rig Veda also contains Sukta R.V.X.177 of [[Rishi]] Patanga Prajapati which is addressed to the [[Rigvedic deities|Vedic deity]], '''Mayabheda'''. It is a very short ''[[Sukta]]'' consisting of just three [[mantra]]s. The first mantra is in ''Jagati'' ''[[Vedic meter|chhanda]]'' to be sung or recited in ''Nishad'' ''[[Swara]]'', the second mantra is in ''Virat-trishtup'' '' [[Vedic meter|chhanda]]''  to be sung in ''Dhaivata'' ''[[Swara]]'' and the third, in ''Nichrit-trishtup'' ''[[Vedic meter|chhanda]]'' also to be sung in ''Dhaivata'' ''[[Swara]]''. The third mantra also appears in the First Mandala in the "Riddle Hymn" as Sukta R.V.I.164.31 in the hymn addressed to the ''Vishwadevas'', in which regard it is said that in this mantra is to be found the culminating point of the whole doctrine of the Transmigration of souls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A constructive survey of Upanishadic philosophy|author=Ramachandra Dattatreya Ranade|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|page=106|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LyRKQwAACAAJ&amp;dq=A+constructive+survey+of+upanishadic+philosophy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0iisUMbvOavPmAW8yoCABw&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::'''पतङ्गम्क्तमसुरस्य मायया हृदा पश्यन्ति मनसा विपश्चितः |'''
::'''समुद्रे अन्तः कवयो वि चक्षते मरीचीनां पदमिच्छन्ति वेधसः ||''' ||1||

:a) The sapient with their spirit and their mind behold the Bird adorned with all an Asura’s magic might. Sages observe him in the ocean’s inmost depth: the wise disposers seek the station of his rays.
: b) The wise behold with their mind in their heart the Sun, made manifest by the illusion of the Asura. The sages look into the solar orb, the ordainers desire the region of his rays.
:c) The one who has entered the [[Prana]], who is the Prana of the Pranas, owing to His grace the wise ones whole-heartedly (devotedly) observe with great interest the constant (observable) activity in the life (empirical existence) of the [[Jiva]] (the individual self); but those who are blessed with sharper and deeper insight are able to see stationed within (merged with) the Lord (the supreme Self) all those Jivas that have attained [[moksha]] (liberation); therefore, the wise adore the Lord who rests shining ever so brightly.

::'''पतङ्गो वाचं मनसा बिभर्ति तां गन्धर्वोअवदद गर्भे अन्तः |'''
::'''तां द्योतमानां स्वर्यं मनीषामृतस्य पदे कवयो नि पान्ति ||''' ||2||

:a) The flying Bird bears Speech within his spirit: erst the Gandharva in the womb pronounced it. And at the seat of sacrifice the sages cherish their radiant, heavenly-bright invention.
: b) The Sun bears the word in his mind; the Gandharva has spoken it within the wombs; sages cherish it in the place of sacrifice, brilliant, heavenly, ruling the mind.
:c) The Jiva sincerely employs its ability to speak ("speech"); the speech which emerges from within in the form of (various/numerous) words is impelled by the Prana residing within the body having been inspired by it; the all-spreading brilliant light-rays and the vibrant air (collectively) together gathering that word-form speech lifts that speech carrying it to all corners of space (for it to be heard).

::'''अपश्यं गोपाम निद्यमानमा च परा च पथिश्चरन्तम |'''
::'''स्ध्रीचि: स विषूचीर्वसान आ वरीवर्ति भुवनेष्वन्तः ||''' ||3||

:a) I saw the Herdsman, him who never resteth, approaching and departing on his pathways. He, clothed in gathered and diffusive splendour, within the worlds continuously travels.
: b) I beheld the protector, never descending, going by his paths to the east and the west; clothing the quarters of the heaven and the intermediate spaces. He constantly revolves in the midst of the worlds.
:c) The lord of the senses, the all-knowing one, as the witness, watches the imperishable Jiva who in accordance with its past and present works is repeatedly born in this world and passes through many types of agreeable and disagreeable births.

==Import==

According to the ''Asvalayana Srauta Sutra'' IV.6, Mantra ||2|| of this Rigvedic hymn is the inviting verse of the immolated to ''Vac'' (speech), and is used in the ''parvargya rites'' along with Mantra ||3||. Mantra ||1|| does refer directly to the Sun. In the Vidhana literature the richness and ambivalence contained within the rite is lost when vide IV.115 it is said that one should constantly mutter that which is destructive of ignorance (''ajnanabheda''), and which begins with ''patangam'' (the mantras of R.V.X.177) which hymn is indeed destructive of illusion (''mayabheda'') and repels all sorts of illusion; and vide IV.116 it is suggested that one should, by means of this hymn, prevent illusion, be that of ''Sambara'' or ''[[Indrajala]]''; one should, by means of this, ward off the illusion caused by unseen beings. Here the enemy is one that can create maya, and interfere with the abilities to discern what is true and what is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bringing the Gods to Mind:Mantra and Ritual in Early Indian Sacrifice|author=Laurie L. Patton|publisher=University of California Press|page=132|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=gSZmbbsg9bEC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=mayabheda&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1T0KUZLUDsPYrQeGqYCQAg&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=mayabheda&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The language of the Rig Veda is no ordinary language. Moreover, the meaning that is not found in the ordinary language but is in a poet’s language is to be found in its words. Thus, in the first mantra the [[Jiva]], the individual self, is referred to as ''antah''. The expression ''asurasyah'' refers to [[Brahman]], the Prana of all pranas, the Life-principle, that having entered the body brings it to life as the individual self. Those having already gained the highest knowledge see the individual self within the universal self, meaning, they do not see any difference between the [[Jiva]], the [[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]], and the [[Paramatman]] whom they adore as the Light of all lights. These are the three threads that have been used to weave the entire fabric of Indian thought. In the second mantra the word ''patanga'' stands for the Jiva, the embodied soul, who resorts to speech only when he wants to speak; the [[Prana]], the Life-principle, which governs the mind and all feelings of the heart, infuses meanings and makes speech be heard. The third mantra talks about the learned person who constantly sees (notices) the eternal ''Jivatman'' without undergoing any change passing through many births in accordance with the past [[karmas]]. The Sanskrit expression ''gopam'' used in this mantra refers to the controller of the senses [[Brahman]], the Sole Witness of all activities, but this word also refers to those liberated souls who continuously witness the repeated transmigrations of the unliberated souls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Illumination of Knowledge|author=Ravinder kumar Soni|publisher=GBD Books|page=190,191|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Illumination_Of_Knowledge.html?id=dXZJXwAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Wash Edward Hale the first mantra could refer to the myth of the ''[[Svarbhanu]]'' hiding the Sun with darkness until it was found by the [[Atri]]s; if so, this is the only occurrence of ''asura'', in the singular, referring to a mythological evil or demonic being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Asura:In Early Vedic Religion|author= Wash Edward Hale|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=78|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=wN6dz2UZkw4C&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=mayabheda&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1T0KUZLUDsPYrQeGqYCQAg&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=mayabheda&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''multiple audience dilemma''', also known as the '''multiple audience problem''', is a situation that arises when a singular person or group creates multiple images for themselves to present to separate audiences, and then the audiences meet; creating a need to personify different images of the same self without having others figure out what is happening.&lt;ref&gt;http://psych.colorado.edu/~vanboven/vanboven/Publications_files/vanboven_map.pdf
&lt;/ref&gt; This might happen through choosing to act in a specific way to convey a personality that matches both images of the self that both audiences are familiar with, as a way of compromising for both audiences without one or both.

==Studies==

One study conducted in 2000&lt;ref&gt;''When Social Worlds Collide:Overconfidence in the Multiple Audience Problem'', L. Kruger, K. Savitsky, and T. Gilovich&lt;/ref&gt; provides information to support the idea that the multiple audience dilemma is flawed. The study suggests that the task of entertaining multiple audiences at once is difficult and also shows that most participants were more convinced that they had performed a better job then what was actually portrayed. 
*The first part of this study, a single person had to portray themselves as either a party animal or a nerd in an isolated interview with two separate individuals and later was asked to maintain both images at once while being interviewed once more by the same people, without revealing to either audience members that the participant was performing. Then, the audience member scored what they thought of the participant after both encounters and the scores were compared afterwards. The participant did the task of portraying themselves while individually being interviewed and in the situation, but they performed better when they only had to think of one audience and how they actually performed was worse than how they felt they handled the situation.
*The second study focused on letting a group of five or six individuals become familiar with each other by having them talk to the group while answering questions for five minutes. Once everyone was familiar, the participants had to read an essay assigned to them and choose a keyword out of the assigned five words hidden in the essay, that then must be read to ten or twelve individuals, half being the familiar and the unfamiliar make up the rest of the group.The key of this task is to tell the participant's group what the keyword is, without telling the other group. The familiarized group felt like they would perform better because they knew each other, the results however showed to obvious changes, making both the familiar and unfamiliar groups equal at guessing the keyword. This however is only after knowing a person for a few moments and does not conclude that long term relationships will have the same results, due to learning each other's individual personalities rather than a five-minute familiarization session with a group of strangers.

'''Non-Instrumental Movement Inhibition''' (NIMI) is a psychological phenomenon; it is a form of [[Embodied cognition|embodied]] behavior, where the body reveals the thoughts and emotions in a person's mind. During NIMI, visual engagement or [[attention]] leads subconsciously to lower levels of [[fidgeting]] (and other non-instrumental movements).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Witchel|first=Harry|last2=Westling|first2=Carina|last3=Tee|first3=Julian|last4=Healy|first4=Aoife|last5=Needham|first5=Rob|last6=Chockalingam|first6=Nachiappan|date=2014|title=What does not happen: Quantifying embodied engagement using NIMI and self-adaptors|url=http://www.participations.org/Volume%2011/Issue%201/18.pdf|journal=Participations: Journal of Audience and Reception Studies|volume=11 |issue=1|pages=304–331|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Non-Instrumental movements are bodily actions that are not related to the goal of the current task; for example, when in a classroom and the goal is to listen to a lecture, non-instrument (unnecessary) movements include fidgeting, scratching, postural micromovements, and certain emotional expressions.

== Historical Evidence ==
The original observation that, in a seated audience, interest is associated with diminished fidgeting, and that [[boredom]] doubles the amount of human movement, was made by [[Francis Galton]] in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galton|first=Francis|date=1885-06-25|title=The Measure of Fidget|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/032174b0|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=32|issue=817|pages=174–175|doi=10.1038/032174b0|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern experiments suggesting that movement inhibition (and NIMI) were quantifiable and related to [[Flow (psychology)|flow]] or interest were suggested by a series of papers regarding automated tutoring systems by Sidney D’Mello and colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=D'Mello|first=Sidney|last2=Chipman|first2=Patrick|last3=Grasesser|first3=Art|date=2007|title=Posture as a predictor of learner’s affective engagement|url=https://escholarship.org/content/qt7hs9v2hr/qt7hs9v2hr.pdf|journal=Proceedings Of The 29th Annual Cognitive Science Society|publisher=Cognitive Science Society|volume=|pages=905–910|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Using a non-visual task, Paul Seli and collaborators showed that increased episodes of [[Mind-wandering|mind wandering]] led to an increase in fidgeting, presumably because attention requires comparative stillness (maintaining that stillness is described as “a secondary task”).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seli|first=Paul|last2=Carriere|first2=Jonathan S.

== Controversy ==
While it is known that [[frustration]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kapoor|first=Ashish|last2=Burleson|first2=Winslow|last3=Picard|first3=Rosalind W.|date=August 2007|title=Automatic Prediction of Frustration|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhcs.2007.02.003|journal=Int.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10424">In [[genetics]], a '''non-paternity event'''  is when someone who is presumed to be an individual's father is not in fact the biological father. This presumption may be on the part of the individual, the parents, or the physician. Non-paternity may result from [[sperm donation]], undisclosed adoption, intercourse with multiple partners in close succession, non-consensual sex, as well as medical mistakes, for example, mixups during procedures such as [[in vitro fertilization]] and [[artificial insemination]].&lt;ref name=2005bellis&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bellis MA, Hughes K, Hughes S, Ashton JR |title=Measuring paternal discrepancy and its public health consequences |journal=J Epidemiol Community Health |volume=59 |issue=9 |pages=749–54 |date=September 2005 |pmid=16100312 |pmc=1733152 |doi=10.1136/jech.2005.036517 |url=http://jech.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=16100312}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where there is uncertainty, the most reliable technique for establishing paternity is [[genetic testing]]; however, there is still a risk of error due to the potential for [[gene mutation]]s or scoring errors.

Overall, the incidence of misattributed paternity ranges from about 2% to 12%, though it may be higher in certain populations. The discovery of previously unsuspected or undisclosed non-paternity may have both social and medical consequences. Non-paternity that is due to a previously undisclosed extra-marital relationship often has serious consequences for a marital relationship. Non-paternity is medically relevant when interpreting the results and utility of genetic screening for [[hereditary]] illnesses.

==Definitions and uses==
Bellis et al. (2005) stated that misattributed paternity "occurs when a child is believed to have been fathered by the husband (or partner) but is actually the progeny of another man."&lt;ref name=2005bellis/&gt; Non-paternity events are also sometimes referred to as misattributed paternity, paternal discrepancy or false paternity.&lt;!----&gt; Although it is sometimes referred to as [[paternity fraud]], this suggests that the misattribution was deliberate rather than accidental.&lt;ref name=2005draper&gt;{{cite journal |last= Draper |first= Heather |year= 2005 |title= Paternity fraud and compensation for misattributed paternity |journal= Journal of Medical Ethics |volume=33 |issue= 8 |pages= 475–480 |doi= 10.1136/jme.2005.013268 |pmid= 17664309 |pmc= 2598159}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a scientific review of non-paternity studies since the 1950s, Bellis et al. (2005) stated that knowingly covering up an accidental pregnancy that resulted from infidelity is often assumed to be the reason for non-paternity, but that there are many other reasons, "for example, where sex with the long term partner has not produced children a woman might seek conception elsewhere." They said other reasons might be undisclosed adoptions, accidental misattribution resulting from multiple relationships in close succession as well as medical mistakes, such as mixups during procedures such as [[in vitro fertilization]] and [[artificial insemination]].&lt;ref name=2005bellis/&gt;

In [[genetic genealogy]] the term non-paternity is often used in a wider context to indicate a break in the link between the [[Y-chromosome]] and the surname. Such a breakage may occur because of formal or informal adoption, premarital or extramarital intercourse or rape, or when individuals use a different surname than their biological father, such as their mother's maiden name, a stepfather's name, the use of aliases or a legal name change.&lt;ref name=2006bopp&gt;{{citation|last=Bopp|first=Georgia K.|title=Non-Paternal Event (NPE)|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~gkbopp/DNA/falsepaternal.htm|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Testing for non-paternity==
{{further information|DNA paternity testing}}
The most reliable test for paternity is [[genetic testing]], sometimes referred to as [[DNA]] testing. Requirements for consent and counselling vary by country.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} However, genetic testing is based on probabilities and is not always definitive. Jones et al. (2010) said, "Characteristics of the markers and the fact that they are analysed by fallible humans can result in inconsistencies that present problems for parentage analysis." False negatives may occur due to low quality samples, [[gene mutation]]s, or [[genotyping]] errors (when a [[genotype]] is misread or inaccurately scored). There is a higher probability of accuracy when DNA from both parents can be tested. The accuracy increases even more when DNA from a sibling is available.&lt;ref name=2010jones&gt;{{citation|last=Jones|title=A practical guide to methods of parentage analysis|url=https://web.natur.cuni.cz/~muncling/Jones%202010%20paternity.pdf|journal=Molecular Ecology Resources|year=2010|volume=10|issue=1|pages=6–30|doi=10.1111/j.1755-0998.2009.02778.x|pmid=21564987|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rates of non-paternity==

===Typical births===
It is difficult to accurately estimate the incidence of misattributed paternity, and there have been large discrepancies in the research published on the topic. Often data on non-paternity rates are reported tangentially to the primary goal of research without sufficient detail, and very few studies involve randomized samples. As such, it is not possible to make valid generalizations based on a large portion of the available literature.&lt;ref name=1991macintyre&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Macintyre S, Sooman A|lastauthoramp=yes |title=Non-paternity and prenatal genetic screening|journal=Lancet|year=1991|volume=338|issue=8771|pmid=1681226|pages=869–871|doi=10.1016/0140-6736(91)91513-T}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bellis et al. (2005) found that between 1950 and 2004, the rates of misattributed paternity published in scientific journals ranged from 0.8% to 30% with a median of 3.7%.&lt;ref name=2005bellis/&gt; According to a study published in the ''Lancet'', "High rates have been quoted, but are often unsupported by any published evidence or based on unrepresentative population samples."&lt;ref name=1991macintyre/&gt;

[[Turi King]] and Mark Jobling of the Department of Genetics at [[University of Leicester]] called the commonly cited 30% rate of non-paternity an "urban myth".&lt;ref name=2009rincon&gt;{{cite news|author=Rincon P|title=Study debunks illegitimacy 'myth'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7881652.stm|work=BBC News|date=11 February 2009|accessdate=11 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to King and Jobling, the figure is around 2%. They also stated that misattributed paternity is often impacted by cultural and socioeconomic factors and that it occurs more frequently among couples who aren't married.&lt;ref name=2009king&gt;{{citation|last1=King|first1=Turi E.|last2=Jobling|first2=Mark A.|title=Founders, Drift, and Infidelity: The Relationship between Y Chromosome Diversity and Patrilineal Surnames|pmc=2668828|journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution|volume=26|issue=5|year=2009|pmid=19204044|doi=10.1093/molbev/msp022|pages=1093–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist Michael Gilding concluded that inflated figures have been circulated by the media, the [[Parental test|paternity testing]] industry,  [[fathers' rights movement|fathers' rights activists]] and [[evolutionary psychologist]]s.&lt;ref name=2009gilding&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Gilding |first1= Michael |year= 2005 |title= Rampant misattributed paternity: the creation of an urban myth |journal= People and Place |volume= 13 |issue= 12 |pages= 1&amp;ndash;11 |publisher= [[Monash University]] |doi= |url= http://arrow.monash.edu.au/hdl/1959.1/480786 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=2009bgilding&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gilding | first1 = M. | doi = 10.1177/0038038508099102 | title = Paternity Uncertainty and Evolutionary Psychology: How a Seemingly Capricious Occurrence Fails to Follow Laws of Greater Generality | journal = Sociology | volume = 43 | pages = 140–691 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; He traced many of these overestimates back to a 1972 conference where non-paternity rates as high as 30% were discussed.&lt;ref name=1973philipp&gt;Philipp EE (1973) "Discussion: moral, social and ethical issues". In: Wolstenholme GEW, Fitzsimons DW, eds. ''Law and ethics of AID and embryo transfer''. Ciba Foundation symposium. Vol 17. London: Associated Scientific 63–66.&lt;/ref&gt; Gilding states that these data only show the incidence of non-paternity in cases where disputed parentage was the ''reason'' for paternity testing. &lt;ref name=2005bellis/&gt;&lt;ref name=2011gilding&gt;{{cite news|last=Gilding|first=Michael|title=The fatherhood myth: Michael Gilding unravels the uncertain data about mistaken paternity|date=26 July 2011|url=http://inside.org.au/the-fatherhood-myth/|publisher=The inside story|accessdate=10 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In situations where disputed parentage was the reason for the paternity testing, there were higher levels with an incidence of 17% to 33% (median of 26.9%). Most at risk of parental discrepancy were those born to younger parents, to unmarried couples and those of lower socio-economic status, or from certain ethnic and cultural groups.&lt;ref name=2005bellis/&gt;

===Atypical multiple births===
{{main|heteropaternal superfecundation}}
Rarely, genetic testing has revealed children from [[multiple birth]]s to have different fathers, which is known as "[[heteropaternal superfecundation]]". One study estimated that the incidence of bipaternal twins born to white women in the United States is around one pair in 400.&lt;ref name=1993james&gt;{{citation|last=James|first=WH|title=The incidence of superfecundation and of double paternity in the general population|pmid=7871943|journal=Acta geneticae medicae et gemellologiae|year=1993|volume=42|issue=3–4|pages=257–62|doi=10.1017/s0001566000003263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found the prevalence to be approximately one pair in 13,000 cases.&lt;ref name=2015garcia&gt;{{citation|last=Garcia|title=Heteropaternal superfecundation: Implicancies in forensic genetics|url=http://www.fsigeneticssup.com/article/S1875-1768(15)30173-6/abstract|journal=Forensic Science International: Genetics Supplement Series|year=2015|volume=5|page=e633|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1016/j.fsigss.2015.10.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Nurbank bank''', founded in Atyrau regional governor's office was taken over by [[Rakhat Aliyev]] in January 2007. Shortly after, two Nurbank managers, Zholdas Timraliyev and Aybar Khasenov, were kidnapped, tortured and eventually killed by Aliyev. In May 2007, the criminal proceedings against Aliyev in Almaty began and [[Kazakhstan]] sentenced him for forty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interfax.kz/?lang=eng&amp;int_id=expert_opinions&amp;news_id=464 |title=Rakhat Aliyev may be sentenced to life imprisonment in Austria - newspaper |website=Interfax.kz |date= |accessdate=2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1992, the Nurbank bank opened for business and became the seventh largest bank in [[Kazakhstan]]. "According to its Website, it is owned by the largest oil, food, publishing and foreign trade firms operating in Kazakhstan, and also currently lends to oil, food, foreign trade, and publishing &amp; information firms."&lt;ref name=widens&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://foreignpolicyblogs.com/2007/05/24/kazakhstan-nurbank-scandal-widens/ |title=Kazakhstan: Nurbank scandal widens |publisher=Foreign Policy Blogs |date= |accessdate=2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2007, Rakhat Aliyev became the main owner and acquired about 75% of all Nurbank’s assets. His father owned 6.71% and his 22-year-old son Nurali Aliyev was a sitting board member.&lt;ref name=widens/&gt;

==First kidnapping==
Around January 18, 2007, Zholdas Timraliyev (vice president) and Abilmazhen Gilimov (chairmen of Nurbank) entered into a car and were threatened by Rakhat Aliyev, according to Abilmazhen Gilimov.  Rakhat was looking to acquire possession of a prized financial building in Kazakhstan's commercial capital, Almaty by ensuring ownership passed to him. They escaped after 24 hours. During his kidnapping, Timraliyev was able to phone his wife and tell of his abduction. Timraliyev's wife (Armangul Kapasheva/Armangul Qapasheva) reported him missing. They escaped after being held for 24 hours.&lt;ref name=widens/&gt; They both left their positions at Nurbank on January 19.&lt;ref name=widens/&gt;

According to newspapers, the building Aliyev wanted them to sell, sold on January 22 for a very low price,  four days after the alleged first kidnapping.&lt;ref name="rferl.org"&gt;{{cite web|last=Pannier |first=Bruce |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1074875.html |title=Kazakhstan: Nazarbaev's Son-In-Law Sent To Austria Amid More Accusations |website=Rferl.org |date= |accessdate=2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second kidnapping==
On January 31, Timraliyev disappeared again after receiving summons to speak with the tax police. Him and  chairman of the board, Aibar Khasenov were reported missing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voiceofrussia.com/news/2014_06_06/Kazakh-presidents-former-son-in-law-arrested-in-Vienna-7204/ |title=Kazakh president's former son-in-law arrested in Vienna|publisher=The Voice of Russia |date= |accessdate=2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a days of violent acts, both of the bodies were tucked into a metal drum, assailed with chalk and buried on a waste dump.&lt;ref name=tagdyr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.tagdyr.net/the-nurbank-murder-case |accessdate=July 3, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519112016/http://en.tagdyr.net/the-nurbank-murder-case/ |archivedate=May 19, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his kidnapping, Timraliyev was able to phone his wife (Armangul Kapasheva) and tell of his abduction. She reported them missing and her strong public appearance about the disappearance of her husband and mounting pressure against Alivey, the Kazakh authorities finally initiated criminal proceedings on May 10, 2007.&lt;ref name=tagdyr/&gt; The wives of the two missing Nurbank managers establish the TAGDYR association in order to find their husbands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/asianet/130411/rakhat-aliyev-malta-lives-fear-he-will-be-kidnapped |title=Rakhat Aliyev in Malta lives in fear that he will be kidnapped |publisher=Global Post |date=2013-04-11 |accessdate=2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuits==
:''See Also [[Tagdyr]]''
As a result, Aliyev brought forth a lawsuit against the two wives, for “insulting his honor and dignity.”&lt;ref name="rferl.org"/&gt;

Timraliyev’s wife was interviewed and several news outlets including,Svoboda Slova," "Tasjargan," "Vremya," and zonakz.net published her comments and now faced legal suit from Aliyev.&lt;ref name="rferl.org"/&gt;

==Criminal prosecution==
Aliyev was quickly appointed the new Kazak ambassador to Austria on February 9, 2007 as a polite way to get him out of the country. While in Austria, Aliyev announced his candidacy for the upcoming Kazakhstan elections and criticized the sitting Kazak President, [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]]. A full domestic Kazak investigation began in May 2007 into Aliyev’s activities. His diplomatic passport was cancelled, as was his diplomatic immunity. Kazakhstan filed its first extradition request at this time. The domestic Kazak investigation concluded January 2008 and Kazak courts sentenced Aliyev to 20 years of imprisonment ''in absentia''.  His crimes were kidnapping, treason and plotting a coup d'état against his father-in-law  Nursultan Nazarbayev.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://roberts-report.blogspot.com/2007_02_01_archive.html |title=The Roberts Report on Central Asia and Kazakhstan: February 2007 |website=Roberts-report.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their second request for extradition in 2011 was also rejected, as Austria feared Kazak political persecution of Aliyev. They did however open their own investigation into Aliyev's dealings.

January 2013, Ailyev claimed Kazakhstan was politically persecuting him because he rejected the political system. Viennese supreme court excluded political underpinnings as a reason for persecution, which helped to greatly legitimize legal action brought against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Пишет: Steven Откуда: Simon |url=http://www.caucasustimes.com/article.asp?id=21159 |title=Caucasus Times |publisher=Caucasus Times |date=2013-07-21 |accessdate=2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other crimes==
[[Rakhat Aliyev]] (Shoraz) is also suspected of the murder of opposition leader and former Kazak ambassador to Russia Mr Sarsenbayev in early 2006, a complex embezzlement scheme stretching from Germany to Malta and Navis, torturing two Kazak bodyguards in 2001, and the death of his girlfriend [[Anastasiya Novikova]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austriantimes.at/news/General_News/2014-06-06/51200/Former_Kazakh_diplomat_Rakhat_Aliyev_arrested_in_Vienna_ |accessdate=July 3, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140610020907/http://austriantimes.at/news/General_News/2014-06-06/51200/Former_Kazakh_diplomat_Rakhat_Aliyev_arrested_in_Vienna_ |archivedate=June 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Offences Against the Person Act''' (with its variations) is a stock [[short title]] used for legislation in the [[United Kingdom]], in the [[Republic of Ireland]], in [[Hong Kong]], in [[New Zealand]], in [[Tasmania]] and in [[Antigua and Barbuda]], relating to [[offences against the person]]. It seems to have been derived from the [[long title]] of the Act which has come to be known as the [[Offences Against the Person Act 1828]]. It is sometimes abbreviated to '''OAPA''', as in "OAPA 1861".

The Bill for an Act with this short title will have been known as a '''Offences Against the Person Bill''' during its passage through Parliament.

"Offences Against the Person Acts" may be a generic name either for legislation bearing that short title or for all legislation which relates to offences against the person. It is not a term of art.

==Definition==
The definition of  perseverative cognition is: "the repeated or chronic activation of the cognitive representation of one or more psychological stressors".&lt;ref name="BGT2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "VBGT2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Verkuil | first1 = B. | last2 = Brosschot | first2 = J.F. | last3 = Gebhardt | first3 = W.A. | last4 = Thayer | first4 = J.F. | year = 2010 | title = When worries make you sick: A review of perseverative cognition, the default stress response and somatic health | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychopathology | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 87–118 | doi = 10.5127/jep.009110 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Worry]], [[rumination (psychology)|rumination]] and all other forms of thought ([[cognition]]) involving stressful events, in the past or in the future, fall under the definition of perseverative cognition. 'Just thinking about your problems, without calling it worrying or rumination', is also perseverative cognition, as is [[mind wandering]] when it concerns negative topics.&lt;ref name="OSC2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OC2013"/&gt; Importantly, there is a large body of knowledge about the typical constituents of perseverative cognition, such as worry, rumination, repetitive thinking and (negative) mind wandering (reviewed in Watkins, 2008&lt;ref name="W2008"/&gt;).
Perseverative cognition may partly be [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]].&lt;ref name="B2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brosschot | first1 = J.F. | year = 2010 | title = Markers of chronic stress: Prolonged physiological activation and (un)conscious perseverative cognition | url = | journal = Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews | volume = 35 | issue = 1| pages = 46–50 | doi = 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2010.01.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BVT2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brosschot | first1 = J.F. | last2 = Verkuil | first2 = B. | last3 = Thayer | first3 = J.F. | year = 2010 | title = Conscious and unconscious perseverative cognition: Is a large part of prolonged physiological activity due to unconscious stress? | url = | journal = Journal of Psychosomatic Research | volume = 69 | issue = 4| pages = 407–16 | doi = 10.1016/j.jpsychores.2010.02.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Just as people are not aware of the larger part of their thoughts (cognition),&lt;ref name="BM2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bargh | first1 = J.A. | last2 = Morsella | first2 = E. | year = 2008 | title = The unconscious mind | journal = Perspectives on Psychological Science | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 73–9 | doi = 10.1111/j.1745-6916.2008.00064.x | pmid=18584056 | pmc=2440575}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DN2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dijksterhuis | first1 = A. | last2 = Nordgren | first2 = L.F. | year = 2006 | title = A theory of unconscious thought | url = | journal = Perspectives on Psychological Science | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 95–109 | doi = 10.1111/j.1745-6916.2006.00007.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; they may also not be aware of the cognitive representation of stressors.

'''The 'perseverative cognition hypothesis{{'}}'''&lt;ref name="BGT2006" /&gt;  holds that stressful events cannot affect people's health, unless they think repetitively or continuously (that is, 'perseverate cognitively') about these stressful events. Stressful events themselves are often too short, as are the physiological responses to them. Therefore the physiological responses during these stressors are unlikely to cause bodily harm. More importantly, many stressful events are merely worried about, or feared in the future, while they often do not happen or do not have the feared consequences. Nevertheless, the body reacts with prolonged physiological responses to continuous thoughts (perseverative cognition) about these stressors. Therefore it is the perseverative cognition, and not the stressors that can eventually lead to disease. In scientific terms, it is said that perseverative cognition is a [[wikt:Special:Search/mediator|mediator]] of the detrimental effects of [[stress (psychological)|stress]] on one's health. Since its publication scientific evidence for this hypothesis has been accumulating.&lt;ref name="VBGT2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "GS2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Geurts | first1 = S.A. | last2 = Sonnentag | first2 = S. | year = 2006 | title = Recovery as an explanatory mechanism in the relation between acute stress reactions and chronic health impairment | url = | journal = Scandinavian Journal of Work and Environtal Health | volume = 32 | issue = 6| pages = 482–92 | doi = 10.5271/sjweh.1053 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "LC2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Larsen | first1 = B.A | last2 = Christenfeld | first2 = N.J.S. | year = 2009 | title = Cardiovascular Disease and Psychiatric Comorbidity: The Potential Role of Perseverative Cognition | url = | journal = Cardiovascular Psychiatry and Neurology | volume =  2009| issue = | pages =  1–8| doi = 10.1155/2009/791017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "FMBK2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Flaxman | first1 = P.

The '''Retirement Syndrome''' is a term coined by clinical professor of Leadership Development at [[INSEAD]], and author, [[Manfred F.R. Kets de Vries|Manfred F.R Kets de Vries]], to describe the difficulties faced by individuals in positions of authority, specifically [[Chief Executive Officer|Chief Executive Officer's]] (CEO's) as they attempt to "let go" at the end of a full career.&lt;ref&gt;Kets de Vries, M. (2003). The Retirement Syndrome:: The Psychology of Letting Go. European Management Journal, 21(6), 707-716.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://holbornassets.com/brexit-a-step-forward-or-backwards/ The Brexit – A Step Forwards or Backwards?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/581485/talion&lt;/ref&gt;

The syndrome, also classified by Kets de Vries as the "CEO blues", is an insistence by individuals in positions of leadership or authority to remain in power, despite reaching a plateau in their careers. Individuals in this position may experience feelings of having accomplished all that can be accomplished, and a lack of creativity, or lack of lustre in their current position.  Effects are most strongly felt by those who reach a position of power earlier on in their lifetime as they will spend a much greater amount of time on the down slope towards retirement, as opposed to individuals who reach the "top" in their later years.{{cn|date=May 2016}}

Effects may also be credited to a realization by CEO's who have reached this plateau of the losses they may endure upon their retirement including:
* the loss of work
* the loss of health and vitality
* the loss of public exposure and public contact
* loss of influence, power, attention, and admiration
* loss of financial stability

As well as a desire to avoid difficult situations in which they may be required to confront the sacrifices they made on their way to the top -a fulfilling personal life, healthy relationships with spouse, children and friends, and time to develop outside contacts and interests.

== Psychological Effects ==

=== The Physical and Psychological Effects of Aging ===
The physical effects of aging- wrinkles, gray hair, balding, dental problems,  a need for glasses (stronger prescription), are coupled with a self-consciousness about the deterioration of the body. This can lead to a search for outlets that can act as substitutes for attractiveness. For leaders especially, maintaining power may be viewed as a substitute for the attractiveness that has been lost throughout the years. Leaders with narcissistic tendencies, are also more likely to feel the psychological effects of aging as they may experience a heightened sense of injury when the physical effects of aging become apparent.

=== The Experience of Nothingness ===
The Experience of nothingness is felt by individuals facing retirement if they feel as though their leadership is the only thing they have left, and a loss of this leadership would lead to their demise as a "somebody" to a "nobody".  Many individuals in this position often may not have anyone to turn to for emotional support, and will therefore cling to their position of power for as long as possible.

=== The Talion Principle ===
The [[lex talionis]] or talion principle, often referred to as the "[[eye for an eye]]" principle can be applied in the case of individuals facing retirement. This principle established in early Babylonian law, expresses the belief that criminals should be punished exactly as they had inflicted upon their victims. In the case of retirees, paranoia may ensue when it comes time for this shift in power, as they are consciously aware as leaders of the individuals who may attempt to retaliate or take revenge against them for leadership decisions taken during their careers that may have affected the happiness or wellbeing of one or more of these individuals.

=== The Edifice Complex ===
The Edifice Complex is a sense that with retirement comes the end of a legacy. More deeply felt when at the unconscious level, leaving a lasting legacy is equated with defeating death. In a way, difficulty in letting go of this legacy, and a desire to remain in power for as long as possible, may be seen in the broader sense as a difficulty facing mortality. When power begins to shift in the organization, a CEO may go through the stages of anger, sadness, and depression, which can lead to serious second thoughts in their decision to retire their position.  On the other hand, leaders who are committed to their organization and actively try to find a capable successor to carry on after their retirement generally experience less difficulty in letting go.

The woman on the throne holds a sword to chastise the guilty and a [[Palm branch (symbol)|palm branch]] to reward the meritorious. [[Halo (religious iconography)|Glory]] surrounds her head, and the [[aegis]] of [[Minerva]] signifies the armor of righteousness and wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;Cole, John et al. (1997).

{{Politics}}

The '''rule of law''' is "The authority and influence of [[law]] in society, especially when viewed as a constraint on individual and institutional behavior; (hence) the principle whereby all members of a society (including those in government) are considered equally subject to publicly disclosed legal codes and processes".&lt;ref name=OED&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'' online (accessed September 13, 2018;  spelling Americanized).  The phrase "the rule of law" is also sometimes used in other senses.  ''See'' Garner, Bryan A. (Editor in Chief). ''Black's Law Dictionary'', 9th Edition, p. 1448. (Thomson Reuters, 2009). {{ISBN|978-0-314-26578-4}}.  Black's provides a five definitions of "rule of law":  the lead definition is "A substantive legal principle";  the second is the "supremacy of regular as opposed to arbitrary power".&lt;/ref&gt;  The phrase "the rule of law" refers to a political situation, not to any specific legal rule.  

Use of the phrase can be traced back to 16th-century [[Great Britain|Britain]], and in the following century the Scottish theologian [[Samuel Rutherford]] employed it in arguing against the [[divine right of kings]].&lt;ref name="Rex" /&gt;  [[John Locke]] wrote that freedom in society means being subject only to laws made by a legislature that apply to everyone, with a person being otherwise free from both governmental and private restrictions upon liberty.  "The rule of law" was further popularized in the 19th century by British jurist [[A. V. Dicey]]. However, the principle, if not the phrase itself, was recognized by ancient thinkers;  for example, [[Aristotle]] wrote: "It is more proper that law should govern than any one of the citizens".&lt;ref name="ari" /&gt;

The rule of law implies that every person is subject to the law, including people who are lawmakers, law enforcement officials, and judges.&lt;ref&gt;Hobson, Charles.  ''The Great Chief Justice: John Marshall and the Rule of Law'', p. 57 (University Press of Kansas, 1996): according to [[John Marshall]], "the framers of the Constitution contemplated that instrument as a rule for the government of courts, as well as of the legislature."&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, it stands in contrast to a [[monarchy]] or [[oligarchy]] where the rulers are held above the law. {{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} Lack of the rule of law can be found in both democracies and monarchies, for example, because of neglect or ignorance of the law, and the rule of law is more apt to decay if a government has insufficient corrective mechanisms for restoring it.

==History==
Although credit for popularizing the expression "the rule of law" in modern times is usually given to [[A. V. Dicey]],&lt;ref name=Wormuth /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Lord Bingham|Bingham, Thomas]]. ''The Rule of Law'', p. 3 (Penguin 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; development of the legal concept can be traced through history to many ancient civilizations, including [[ancient Greece]], [[History of China#Ancient China|China]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[India]], and [[ancient Rome|Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;Black, Anthony.

===Antiquity===
In the [[Western civilization|West]], the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] initially regarded the best form of government as rule by the best men.&lt;ref name=Clarke /&gt;  [[Plato]] advocated a [[benevolent dictatorship|benevolent monarchy]] ruled by an idealized [[philosopher king]], who was above the law.&lt;ref name=Clarke&gt;David Clarke, "[http://www.lfip.org/lawe506/documents/lawe506davidclarke.pdf The many meanings of the rule of law]" in Kanishka Jayasuriya, ed., ''Law, Capitalism and Power in Asia'' (New York: Routledge, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; Plato nevertheless hoped that the best men would be good at respecting established laws, explaining that "Where the law is subject to some other authority and has none of its own, the collapse of the state, in my view, is not far off; but if law is the master of the government and the government is its slave, then the situation is full of promise and men enjoy all the blessings that the gods shower on a state."&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, John et al. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=eSKTvJDrr5kC&amp;pg=PA1402&amp;lpg=PA1402&amp;dq=%22if+law+is+the+master+of+the+government+and+the+government+is+its+slave%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XNhu-PDe7H&amp;sig=4in2cTSQVL-2gcq9i881VqWYUxo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=UmTZSZDIKqntlQe4vLzgDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6#PPA1402,M1 Complete Works By Plato]'', p. 1402 (Hackett Publishing, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; More than Plato attempted to do, [[Aristotle]] flatly opposed letting the highest officials wield power beyond guarding and serving the laws.&lt;ref name=Clarke /&gt; In other words, Aristotle advocated the rule of law:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is more proper that law should govern than any one of the citizens: upon the same principle, if it is advantageous to place the supreme power in some particular persons, they should be appointed to be only guardians, and the servants of the laws.&lt;ref name=ari&gt;Aristotle, ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' [[s:Politics (Ellis)/Book 3#3:16|3.16]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Roman statesman [[Cicero]] is often cited as saying, roughly:   "We are all servants of the laws in order to be free."&lt;ref&gt;In full: "The magistrates who administer the law, the judges who act as its spokesmen, all the rest of us who live as its servants, grant it our allegiance as a guarantee of our freedom."{{mdash}}{{cite book|author=Cicero|title=Murder Trials|translator=Michael Grant|location=Harmondsworth|publisher=Penguin|year=1975|series=Penguin Classics|page=217}}

In China, members of the school of [[w:Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|legalism]] during the 3rd century BC argued for using law as a tool of governance, but they promoted "rule ''by'' law" as opposed to "rule ''of'' law", meaning that they placed the aristocrats and emperor above the law.&lt;ref&gt;Xiangming, Zhang. [http://www.international-relations.com/wbcm5-1/wbrule.htm On Two Ancient Chinese Administrative Ideas: Rule of Virtue and Rule by Law], ''The Culture Mandala: Bulletin of the Centre for East-West Cultural and Economic Studies'' (2002): “Although Han Fei recommended that the government should rule by law, which seems impartial, he advocated that the law be enacted by the lords solely. The lords place themselves above the law. The law is thereby a monarchical means to control the people, not the people's means to restrain the lords. The lords are by no means on an equal footing with the people. Hence we cannot mention the rule by law proposed by Han Fei in the same breath as democracy and the rule of law advocated today.”&lt;br /&gt;Bevir, Mark.

There has recently been an effort to reevaluate the influence of the Bible on Western constitutional law. In the [[Old Testament]], the book of [[Deuteronomy]] imposes certain restrictions on the king, regarding such matters as the numbers of wives he might take and of horses he might acquire (for his own use).  According to Professor [[Bernard M. Levinson]], "This legislation was so utopian in its own time that it seems never to have been implemented...."&lt;ref name=Levinson&gt;Levinson, Bernard.

===Middle Ages===
In [[Sharia|Islamic jurisprudence]] rule of law was formulated in the seventh century, so that no official could claim to be above the law, not even the [[caliph]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Weeramantry|Weeramantry, Christopher]] (1997). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3-1sH1wc58UC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=%22Justice+Without+Frontiers:+Furthering+Human+Rights%22&amp;ei=f1f-SbCnH5nCyASU38TvBw#PPA132,M1 Justice without Frontiers]'', p. 132 Martinus Nijhoff Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was not a reference to [[secular]] law, but to Islamic [[religious law]] in the form of [[Sharia law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Impossible State: Islam, Politics and Modernity's Moral Predicament|last=Hallaq|first=Wael|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alfred the Great]], Anglo-Saxon king in the 9th century, reformed the law of his kingdom and assembled a law code (the [[Doom Book]]) which he grounded on biblical commandments. He held that the same law had to be applied to all persons, whether rich or poor, friends or enemies. This was likely inspired by [[Leviticus]] 19:15: "You shall do no iniquity in judgment. You shall not favor the wretched and you shall not defer to the rich. In righteousness you are to judge your fellow."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alter|first1=Robert|title=The Five Books of Moses: A Translation with Commentary|date=2004|publisher=W. W.

In 1215, Archbishop [[Stephen Langton]] gathered the Barons in England and forced [[John of England|King John]] and future sovereigns and magistrates back under the rule of law, preserving ancient liberties by [[Magna Carta]] in return for exacting taxes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/treasures/magnacarta/translation/mc_trans.html Magna Carta (1215) translation, British Library]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured_documents/magna_carta/ Magna Carta (1297) U.S. National Archives].&lt;/ref&gt; This foundation for a constitution was carried into the [[United States Constitution]].

In 1481, during the reign of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]], the ''[[Constitució de l'Observança]]'' was approved by the [[Catalan Courts|General Court of Catalonia]], establishing the submission of royal power (included its officers) to the laws of the [[Principality of Catalonia]].&lt;ref&gt;Ferro, Víctor: El Dret Públic Català.

The first known use of this English phrase occurred around AD 1500.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'' (OED), "[http://www.oed.com/viewdictionaryentry:showfullentry/true?redirectedFrom=%22Rule+of+Law%22&amp;t:ac=Entry/277614 Rule of Law, n.]", accessed April 27, 2013.  According to the OED, this sentence from about 1500  was written by [[John Blount (died 1531)|John Blount]]: "Lawes And constitutcions be ordeyned be cause the noysome Appetit of man maye be kepte vnder the Rewle of lawe by the wiche mankinde ys dewly enformed to lyue honestly."  And this sentence from 1559  is attributed to [[William Bavand]]: "A Magistrate should..kepe rekenyng of all mennes behauiours, and to be carefull, least thei despisyng the rule of lawe, growe to a wilfulnes."&lt;/ref&gt;  Another early example of the phrase "rule of law" is found in a petition to [[James I of England]] in 1610, from the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Amongst many other points of happiness and freedom which your majesty's subjects of this kingdom have enjoyed under your royal progenitors, kings and queens of this realm, there is none which they have accounted more dear and precious than this, to be guided and governed by the certain ''rule of the law'' which giveth both to the head and members that which of right belongeth to them, and not by any uncertain or arbitrary form of government....&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Hallam|Hallam, Henry]]. ''The Constitutional History of England'', vol. 1, p. 441 (1827).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1607, English Chief Justice [[Sir Edward Coke]] said in the ''[[Case of Prohibitions]]'' (according to his own report) "that the law was the golden met-wand and measure to try the causes of the subjects; and which protected His Majesty in safety and peace: with which the King was greatly offended, and said, that then he should be under the law, which was treason to affirm, as he said; to which I said, that Bracton saith, ''quod Rex non debet esse sub homine, sed sub Deo et lege'' (That the King ought not to be under any man but under God and the law.)."

Among the first modern authors to use the term and give the principle theoretical foundations was [[Samuel Rutherford]] in ''[[Lex, Rex]]'' (1644).&lt;ref name=Rex&gt;Rutherford, Samuel.  ''Lex, rex: the law and the prince, a dispute for the just prerogative of king and people, containing the reasons and causes of the defensive wars of the kingdom of Scotland, and of their expedition for the ayd and help of their brethren of England'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=tpIBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA237&amp;lpg=PA237&amp;dq=%22Samuel+Rutherford%22+and+%22but+under+rule+of+law%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3jZvY_yR6F&amp;sig=0t4WLPmw2ucho0R_mDqg9EJrKA8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAmoVChMI_oLUzO6KxwIVRpUeCh3fnQj1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Samuel%20Rutherford%22%20and%20%22but%20under%20rule%20of%20law%22&amp;f=false p. 237] (1644): "The prince remaineth, even being a prince, a social creature, a man, as well as a king; one who must buy, sell, promise, contract, dispose: ergo, he is not regula regulans, but under rule of law...."&lt;/ref&gt; The title, Latin for "the law is king", subverts the traditional formulation ''rex lex'' ("the king is law").&lt;ref name=TSC-RoL-brief&gt;{{cite web|title=The Rule of Law|url=http://www.consoc.org.uk/other-content/about-us/discover-the-facts/the-rule-of-law/|publisher=The Constitution Society|accessdate=3 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006092303/http://www.consoc.org.uk/other-content/about-us/discover-the-facts/the-rule-of-law/|archivedate=6 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]] wrote in ''Oceana'' (1656), drawing principally on Aristotle’s ''Politics'', that among forms of government an “Empire of Laws, and not of Men” was preferable to an “Empire of Men, and not of Laws”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/oceanaotherworks00harr|last=Harrington|first=James|title=The Oceana and other works|editor-last=Toland|editor-first=John|location=London|publisher=Millar|edition=3|year=1747|page=37 (Internet Archive: copy possessed by [[John Adams]])}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Locke]] also discussed this issue in his ''[[Second Treatise of Government]]'' (1690):
&lt;blockquote&gt;The natural liberty of man is to be free from any superior power on earth, and not to be under the will or legislative authority of man, but to have only the law of nature for his rule. The liberty of man, in society, is to be under no other legislative power, but that established, by consent, in the commonwealth; nor under the dominion of any will, or restraint of any law, but what that legislative shall enact, according to the trust put in it. Freedom then is not what Sir Robert Filmer tells us, Observations, A. 55. a liberty for every one to do what he lists, to live as he pleases, and not to be tied by any laws: but freedom of men under government is, to have a standing rule to live by, common to every one of that society, and made by the legislative power erected in it; a liberty to follow my own will in all things, where the rule prescribes not; and not to be subject to the inconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of another man: as freedom of nature is, to be under no other restraint but the law of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, John.  [[Two Treatises of Government|Second Treatise of Civil Government]], Ch. IV, sec. 22 (1690).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The principle was also discussed by [[Montesquieu]] in ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]'' (1748).&lt;ref name="Tamanaha3"&gt;Tamanaha, Brian. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=p4CReF67hzQC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false On the Rule of Law]'', p. 47 (Cambridge University Press, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase "rule of law" appears in [[Samuel Johnson]]'s ''Dictionary'' (1755).&lt;ref&gt;Peacock, Anthony Arthur, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=eENm8IKECDYC&amp;dq= Freedom and the rule of law]'', p. 24. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1776, the notion that no one is above the law was popular during the founding of the United States. For example, [[Thomas Paine]] wrote in his pamphlet ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'' that "in America, ''the law is king''. For as in absolute governments the King is law, so in free countries the law ''ought'' to be king; and there ought to be no other."&lt;ref&gt;Lieberman, Jethro. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=OmA8a1Q9UekC&amp;pg=PA436&amp;dq=%22so+in+free+countries+the+law+ought+to+be+king%22+and+%22rule+of+law%22&amp;ei=9lH-Sa-cEIXGzAS0hLm2Cw A Practical Companion to the Constitution]'', p. 436 (University of California Press 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1780, [[John Adams]] enshrined this principle in the [[Massachusetts Constitution]] by seeking to establish "a government of laws and not of men."&lt;ref&gt;''[[s:Constitution of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (1780)|Massachusetts Constitution]]'', Part The First, art. XXX (1780).&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of Britain, France and the United States contributed to spreading the principle of the rule of law to other countries around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Winks|first1=Robin W.|title=World civilization: a brief history|date=1993|publisher=Collegiate Press|location=San Diego, CA|isbn=9780939693283|page=406|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mY7McxJl7jYC&amp;pg=PA406&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjv-sKmzafMAhXBK8AKHbYhDrEQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Billias|first1=George Athan|title=American constitutionalism heard round the world, 1776–1989: a global perspective|date=2011|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780814725177|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ku0TCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA54&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjpnefZzqfMAhXC1hoKHcjFAG0Q6AEIOjAG#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|pages=53–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Meaning and categorization of interpretations ==
The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' has defined ''rule of law'' this way:&lt;ref name=OED /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The authority and influence of law in society, esp. when viewed as a constraint on individual and institutional behaviour; (hence) the principle whereby all members of a society (including those in government) are considered equally subject to publicly disclosed legal codes and processes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rule of law implies that every citizen is subject to the law. It stands in contrast to the idea that the ruler is above the law, for example by [[divine right of kings|divine right]].

Despite wide use by politicians, judges and academics, the rule of law has been described as "an exceedingly elusive notion".&lt;ref name=elusive&gt;{{cite book|last=Tamanaha|first=Brian Z.|title=On the Rule of Law|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2004|page=3|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among modern [[Legal theory#Legal theory|legal theorists]], one finds that at least two principal conceptions of the rule of law can be identified: a [[legal formalism|formalist]] or "thin" definition, and a substantive or "[[Thick concept|thick]]" definition; one occasionally encounters a third "functional" conception.&lt;ref name="Tamanaha"&gt;Tamanaha, Brian. [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=312622# “The Rule of Law for Everyone?”], ''Current Legal Problems'', vol. 55, via [[SSRN]] (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;  Formalist definitions of the rule of law do not make a judgment about the "justness" of law itself, but define specific procedural attributes that a legal framework must have in order to be in compliance with the rule of law. Substantive conceptions of the rule of law go beyond this and include certain substantive rights that are said to be based on, or derived from, the rule of law.&lt;ref name=Craig&gt;{{cite journal|last=Craig|first=Paul P.|title=Formal and Substantive Conceptions of the Rule of Law: An Analytical Framework|journal=Public Law|page=467|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most legal theorists believe that the rule of law has purely formal characteristics, meaning that the law must be publicly declared (prohibitions or exigencies), with prospective application (punishments or consequences tied to a given prohibition or exigency), and possess the characteristics of generality (usually meaning consistency and comprehensibility), equality (that is, applied equally throughout all society), and certainty (that is, certainty of application for a given situation), but there are no requirements with regard to the content of the law. Others, including a few legal theorists, believe that the rule of law necessarily entails protection of individual rights. Within legal theory, these two approaches to the rule of law are seen as the two basic alternatives, respectively labelled the formal and substantive approaches. Still, there are other views as well. Some believe that democracy is part of the rule of law.&lt;ref name="Stephenson" /&gt;

The "formal" interpretation is more widespread than the "substantive" interpretation. Formalists hold that the law must be prospective, well-known, and have characteristics of generality, equality, and certainty. Other than that, the formal view contains no requirements as to the content of the law.&lt;ref name="Tamanaha" /&gt; This formal approach allows laws that protect democracy and individual rights, but recognizes the existence of "rule of law" in countries that do not necessarily have such laws protecting democracy or individual rights.

The substantive interpretation holds that the rule of law intrinsically protects some or all individual rights.

The functional interpretation of the term "rule of law", consistent with the traditional English meaning, contrasts the "rule of law" with the "[[rule of man]]".&lt;ref name="Stephenson"&gt;Stephenson, Matthew. [http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTLAWJUSTINST/0,,contentMDK:20763583~menuPK:1989584~pagePK:210058~piPK:210062~theSitePK:1974062,00.html "Rule of Law as a Goal of Development Policy"], World Bank Research (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; According to the functional view, a society in which government officers have a great deal of discretion has a low degree of "rule of law", whereas a society in which government officers have little discretion has a high degree of "rule of law".&lt;ref name="Stephenson" /&gt; Upholding the rule of law can sometimes require the punishment of those who commit offenses that are [[justification (law)|justifiable]] under [[natural law]] but not statutory law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Justifiably Punishing the Justified|author=Heidi M. Hurd|journal=Michigan Law Review|volume=90|date=Aug 1992|pages=2203–2324|publisher=The Michigan Law Review Association|jstor=1289573|issue=8|doi=10.2307/1289573}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rule of law is thus somewhat at odds with flexibility, even when flexibility may be preferable.&lt;ref name="Stephenson" /&gt;

The ancient concept of rule ''of'' law can be distinguished from rule ''by'' law, according to political science professor Li Shuguang: "The difference&amp;nbsp;... is that, under the rule of law, the law is preeminent and can serve as a check against the abuse of power. Under rule by law, the law is a mere tool for a government, that suppresses in a legalistic fashion."&lt;ref&gt;Tamanaha, Brian 2004).

The preamble of the [[European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms]] says "the governments of European countries which are like-minded and have a common heritage of political traditions, ideals, freedom and the rule of law".

In France and Germany the concepts of rule of law (''Etat de droit'' and ''Rechtsstaat'' respectively) are analogous to the principles of constitutional supremacy and protection of fundamental rights from public authorities (see [[public law]]), particularly the [[legislature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pech|first1=Laurent|title=Rule of Law in France|journal=Middlesex University – School of Law|ssrn=929099}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Letourneur|first1=M.|last2=Drago|first2=R.|title=The Rule of Law as Understood in France|journal=The American Journal of Comparative Law|date=1958|volume=7|issue=2|pages=147–177|doi=10.2307/837562|jstor=837562}}&lt;/ref&gt; France was one of the early pioneers of the ideas of the rule of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peerenboom|first1=Randall|title=Asian discourses of rule of law : theories and implementation of rule of law in twelve Asian countries, France and the U.S.|date=2004|publisher=RoutledgeCurzon|isbn=9780415326124|page=81|edition=Digital printing.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NCXJFFudGd0C&amp;pg=PA81&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZzrmW7MfMAhViD8AKHestC7sQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|chapter=Rule of Law in France}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German interpretation is more "rigid" but similar to that of France and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rule of Law in China: A Comparative Approach|date=2014|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783662446225|pages=77–78|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c7gjBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA76&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZzrmW7MfMAhViD8AKHestC7sQ6AEIQTAG#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Zurn|editor1-first=Michael|editor2-last=Nollkaemper|editor2-first=Andre|editor3-last=Peerenboom|editor3-first=Randy|title=Rule of Law Dynamics: In an Era of International and Transnational Governance|date=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139510974|pages=116–117|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pAAgAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA117&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZzrmW7MfMAhViD8AKHestC7sQ6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finland's [[Constitution of Finland|constitution]] explicitly requires rule of law by stipulating that "the exercise of public powers shall be based on an Act. In all public activity, the law shall be strictly observed."

====United Kingdom====
{{Main article|Rule of law in the United Kingdom}}
In the United Kingdom the rule of law is a long-standing principle of the way the country is governed, dating from [[Magna Carta]] in 1215 and the [[Bill of Rights 1689]].&lt;ref name=TSC-RoL-brief /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rule of Law|url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/takingliberties/staritemsruleoflaw.html|publisher=The British Library|accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also {{cite web|title=The rule of law and the prosecutor|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/the-rule-of-law-and-the-prosecutor|publisher=Attorney General's Office|accessdate=20 November 2014|date=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, [[Albert Venn Dicey|A. V. Dicey]], a constitutional scholar and lawyer, wrote of the twin pillars of the [[British constitution]] in his classic work ''Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution'' (1885); these two pillars are the rule of law and [[parliamentary sovereignty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=John|last1=Hostettler|title=Champions of the rule of law|date=2011|publisher=Waterside Press|isbn=9781904380689|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Eh7bCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA32&amp;&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwibuqX19cfMAhVJ0xoKHY_QBYEQ6AEIHzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=dicey&amp;f=false|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Americas===

====United States====
All government officers of the United States, including the [[President of the United States|President]], the [[List of Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States|Justices of the Supreme Court]], state judges and legislators, and all [[United States Congress|members of Congress]], pledge first and foremost to uphold the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]. These oaths affirm that the rule of law is superior to the rule of any human leader.&lt;ref&gt;Vile, Josh (2006). ''[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=-QXyUM5BhKUC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR13&amp;dq=%22rule+of+law%22+and+%22shall+be+a+law%22+and+constitution&amp;ots=7hOE4WdL4m&amp;sig=PRZ1TgZMRfRKQ-p0k-8skOzRF7I#PPA80,M1 A Companion to the United States Constitution and its Amendments]''. Greenwood Publishing Group. p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] has considerable discretion: the legislative branch is free to decide what statutes it will write, as long as it stays within its [[enumerated powers]] and respects the constitutionally protected [[United States Bill of Rights|rights of individuals]]. Likewise, the judicial branch has a degree of [[judicial discretion]],&lt;ref&gt;''[http://supreme.justia.com/us/22/738/case.html Osborn v. Bank of the United States]'', 22 U. S. 738 (1824): "When [courts] are said to exercise a discretion, it is a mere legal discretion, a discretion to be exercised in discerning the course prescribed by law; and, when that is discerned, it is the duty of the court to follow it."&lt;/ref&gt; and the executive branch also has various discretionary powers including [[prosecutorial discretion]].

Scholars continue to debate whether the U.S. Constitution adopted a particular interpretation of the "rule of law", and if so, which one. For example, John Harrison asserts that the word "law" in the Constitution is simply defined as that which is legally binding, rather than being "defined by formal or substantive criteria", and therefore judges do not have discretion to decide that laws fail to satisfy such unwritten and vague criteria.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, John. "Substantive Due Process and the Constitutional Text," ''[[Virginia Law Review]]'', vol. 83, p. 493 (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Law Professor [[Frederick Mark Gedicks]] disagrees, writing that [[Cicero]], [[Augustine]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], and the framers of the U.S. Constitution believed that an unjust law was not really a law at all.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick Gedicks|Gedicks, Frederick]]. [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1072284 "An Originalist Defense of Substantive Due Process: Magna Carta, Higher-Law Constitutionalism, and the Fifth Amendment"], ''Emory Law Journal'', vol. 58, pp. 585–673 (2009). See also Edlin, Douglas, "[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1124590 Judicial Review without a Constitution]", ''Polity'', vol. 38, pp. 345–368 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some modern scholars contend that the rule of law has been corroded during the past century by the instrumental view of law promoted by [[legal realism|legal realists]] such as [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] and [[Roscoe Pound]].  For example, Brian Tamanaha asserts: "The rule of law is a centuries-old ideal, but the notion that law is a means to an end became entrenched only in the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries."&lt;ref&gt;Tamanaha, Brian. ''How an Instrumental View of Law Corrodes the Rule of Law'', twelfth annual Clifford Symposium on Tort Law and Social Policy.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others argue that the rule of law has survived but was transformed to allow for the exercise of discretion by administrators. For much of American history, the dominant notion of the rule of law, in this setting, has been some version of A. V. Dicey's: "no man is punishable or can be lawfully made to suffer in body or goods except for a distinct breach of law established in the ordinary legal manner before the ordinary Courts of the land." That is, individuals should be able to challenge an administrative order by bringing suit in a court of general jurisdiction. As the dockets of worker compensation commissions, public utility commissions and other agencies burgeoned, it soon became apparent that letting judges decide for themselves all the facts in a dispute (such as the extent of an injury in a worker's compensation case) would overwhelm the courts and destroy the advantages of specialization that led to the creation of administrative agencies in the first place. Even Charles Evans Hughes, a Chief Justice of the United States, believed "you must have administration, and you must have administration by administrative officers." By 1941, a compromise had emerged. If administrators adopted procedures that more or less tracked "the ordinary legal manner" of the courts, further review of the facts by "the ordinary Courts of the land" was unnecessary. That is, if you had your "day in commission", the rule of law did not require a further "day in court". Thus Dicey's rule of law was recast into a purely procedural form.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst, Daniel R. (2014). ''Tocqueville's Nightmare: The Administrative State Emerges in America, 1900–1940''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0199920860}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Wilson]] said during the [[Philadelphia Convention]] in 1787 that, "Laws may be unjust, may be unwise, may be dangerous, may be destructive; and yet not be so unconstitutional as to justify the Judges in refusing to give them effect." [[George Mason]] agreed that judges "could declare an unconstitutional law void. But with regard to every law, however unjust, oppressive or pernicious, which did not come plainly under this description, they would be under the necessity as judges to give it a free course."&lt;ref&gt;Snowiss, Sylvia. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=JUj81cN6nyAC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=%22could+declare+an+unconstitutional+%22+%22Laws+may+be+unjust,+may+be+unwise,+may+be+dangerous%22&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=P0P-Sa6jGI_CzASqtpzhDQ Judicial Review and the Law of the Constitution]'', pp. 41–42 (Yale University Press 1990).&lt;/ref&gt; Chief Justice [[John Marshall]] (joined by Justice [[Joseph Story]]) took a similar position in 1827: "When its existence as law is denied, that existence cannot be proved by showing what are the qualities of a law."&lt;ref&gt;''Ogden v. Saunders'', {{ussc|25|213|1827|pin=347}}. This was Marshall's only dissent in a constitutional case. The [[individualist anarchist]] [[Lysander Spooner]] later denounced Marshall for this part of his ''Ogden'' dissent. See {{cite book|first=Lysander|last=Spooner|title=Let's Abolish Government|publisher=Ludwig Von Mises Institute|year=2008|page=87}} These same issues were also discussed in an earlier U.S. Supreme Court case, ''Calder v. Bull'', {{ussc|3|386|1798}}, with Justices [[James Iredell]] and [[Samuel Chase]] taking opposite positions. See Presser, Stephen. "Symposium: Samuel Chase: In Defense of the Rule of Law and Against the Jeffersonians", ''[[Vanderbilt Law Review]]'', vol. 62, p. 349 (March 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===
East Asian cultures are influenced by two schools of thought, [[Confucianism]], which advocated good governance as rule by leaders who are benevolent and virtuous, and [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], which advocated strict adherence to law. The influence of one school of thought over the other has varied throughout the centuries. One study indicates that throughout East Asia, only South Korea, Singapore, Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong have societies that are robustly committed to a law-bound state.&lt;ref&gt;Chu, Yun-Han et al. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=oNk6KpfXyYQC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=%22Rule+of+Law%22+and+Korea+and+Japan&amp;lr=&amp;ei=0NMASsrtG5XQzATy8KC8BA#PPA31,M1 How East Asians View Democracy]'', pp. 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Awzar Thi, a member of the [[Asian Human Rights Commission]], the rule of law in Thailand, Cambodia, and most of Asia is weak or nonexistent:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Apart from a number of states and territories, across the continent there is a huge gulf between the rule of law rhetoric and reality. In Thailand, the police force is an organized crime gang. In Cambodia, judges are proxies for the ruling political party ... That a judge may harbor political prejudice or apply the law unevenly are the smallest worries for an ordinary criminal defendant in Asia. More likely ones are: Will the police fabricate the evidence? Will the prosecutor bother to show up? Will the judge fall asleep? Will I be poisoned in prison? Will my case be completed within a decade?&lt;ref&gt;Thi, Awzar.

In countries such as China and Vietnam, the transition to a market economy has been a major factor in a move toward the rule of law, because the rule of law is important to foreign investors and to economic development. It remains unclear whether the rule of law in countries like China and Vietnam will be limited to commercial matters or will spill into other areas as well, and if so whether that spillover will enhance prospects for related values such as democracy and human rights.&lt;ref&gt;Peerenboom, Randall ''in'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=YlKYLRjcoi0C&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=%22Rule+of+law+in+Asia%22&amp;ei=hcIASqy4KKGeygSpzf2vDQ Asian Discourses of Rule of Law], p. 39 (Routledge 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chinese law#Rule of law|rule of law in China]] has been widely discussed and debated by both legal scholars and politicians in China.

In Thailand, a kingdom that has had a constitution since the initial attempt to overthrow the absolute monarchy system in 1932, the rule of law has been more of a principle than actual practice.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Ancient prejudices and political bias have been present in the three branches of government with each of their foundings, and justice has been processed formally according to the law but in fact more closely aligned with royalist principles that are still advocated in the 21st century.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} In November 2013, Thailand faced still further threats to the rule of law when the executive branch rejected a supreme court decision over how to select senators.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

In India, the longest constitutional text in the history of the world has governed that country since 1950. Although the [[Constitution of India]] may have been intended to provide details that would limit the opportunity for judicial discretion, the more text there is in a constitution the greater opportunity the judiciary may have to exercise [[Constitution of India#Judicial Review|judicial review]].&lt;ref&gt;Baxi, Upendra ''in'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=YlKYLRjcoi0C&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=%22Rule+of+law+in+Asia%22&amp;ei=hcIASqy4KKGeygSpzf2vDQ#PPA336,M1 Asian Discourses of Rule of Law], pp. 336–337 (Routledge 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; According to Indian journalist [[Harish Khare]], "The rule of law or rather the Constitution [is] in danger of being supplanted by the rule of judges."&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Simon. [http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1556853,00.html "For Activist Judges, Try India"], ''[[Time Magazine]]'' (2006-11-08).&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan had centuries of tradition prior to [[World War II]], during which there were laws, but they did not provide a central organizing principle for society, and they did not constrain the powers of government (Boadi, 2001). As the 21st century began, the percentage of people who were lawyers and judges in Japan remained very low relative to western Europe and the United States, and legislation in Japan tended to be terse and general, leaving much discretion in the hands of bureaucrats.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Carl. [http://www.asiasociety.org/speeches/green.html "Japan: 'The Rule of Law Without Lawyers' Reconsidered"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080623094753/http://www.asiasociety.org/speeches/green.html |date=2008-06-23 }}, Speech to the [[Asia Society]] (2001-03-14).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also {{cite book|last1=Goodman|first1=Carl F.|title=The rule of law in Japan : a comparative analysis|date=2008|publisher=Wolters Kluwer Law &amp; Business|isbn=9789041127501|edition=2nd rev.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xIsmHbijQesC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations==
Various organizations are involved in promoting the rule of law.

=== The Council of Europe ===
[[Statute of the Council of Europe|The Statute]] of [[Council of Europe|the Council of Europe]] characterizes the rule of law as one of the core principles which the establishment of the organization based on. The paragraph 3 of the preamble of the Statute of the Council of Europe states: "Reaffirming their devotion to the spiritual and moral values which are the common heritage of their peoples and the true source of individual freedom, political liberty and the rule of law, principles which form the basis of all genuine democracy." The Statute lays the compliance with the rule of law principles as a condition for the European states to be a full member of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rm.coe.int/1680306052|title=Statute of the Council of Europe|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Commission of Jurists===
In 1959, an event took place in [[New Delhi]] and speaking as the [[International Commission of Jurists]], made a declaration as to the fundamental principle of the rule of law. The event consisted of over 185 judges, lawyers, and law professors from 53 countries. This later became known as the [[Declaration of Delhi]]. During the declaration they declared what the rule of law implied. They included certain rights and freedoms, an independent judiciary and social, economic and cultural conditions conducive to human dignity. The one aspect not included in The Declaration of Delhi, was for rule of law requiring legislative power to be subject to [[judicial review]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy, Jeffrey. [https://books.google.com/books?id=84tBKuObyNEC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=%22Declaration+of+Delhi%22+and+%22rule+of+law%22&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=5PLOSdWiJ4WoNsPhoMcH “Legislative Sovereignty and the Rule of Law"] in Tom Campbell, Keith D. Ewing and Adam Tomkins (eds), ''Sceptical Essays on Human Rights'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Nations===
The [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] defines the rule of law as:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unrol.org/article.aspx?article_id=3 What is the Rule of Law?], United Nations Rule of Law.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
a principle of governance in which all persons, institutions and entities, public and private, including the State itself, are accountable to laws that are publicly promulgated, equally enforced and independently adjudicated, and which are consistent with international human rights norms and standards. It requires, as well, measures to ensure adherence to the principles of supremacy of law, equality before the law, accountability to the law, fairness in the application of the law, separation of powers, participation in decision-making, legal certainty, avoidance of arbitrariness and procedural and legal transparency.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The General Assembly has considered rule of law as an agenda item since 1992, with renewed interest since 2006 and has adopted resolutions at its last three sessions.&lt;ref&gt;See United Nations General Assembly Resolutions A/RES/61/39, A/RES/62/70, A/RES/63/128.&lt;/ref&gt; The Security Council has held a number of thematic debates on the rule of law,&lt;ref&gt;See United Nations Security Council debates S/PRST/2003/15, S/PRST/2004/2, S/PRST/2004/32, S/PRST/2005/30, S/PRST/2006/28.&lt;/ref&gt; and adopted resolutions emphasizing the importance of these issues in the context of women, peace and security,&lt;ref&gt;See United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1325 and 1820.&lt;/ref&gt; children in armed conflict,&lt;ref&gt;E.g. see United Nations Security Council Resolution 1612.&lt;/ref&gt; and the protection of civilians in armed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. see United Nations Security Council Resolution 1674.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Peacebuilding Commission]] has also regularly addressed rule of law issues with respect to countries on its agenda.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/ruleoflaw/index.shtml United Nations and the Rule of Law].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]] also requires the rule of law be included in [[human rights education]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]] Part II, paragraph 79&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Bar Association===
The Council of the [[International Bar Association]] passed a resolution in 2009 endorsing a substantive or "thick" definition of the rule of law:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibanet.org/Document/Default.aspx?DocumentUid=9925C6FD-5804-407F-9D39-ECB9D6A8B9D4 Resolution of the Council of the International Bar Association of October 8, 2009, on the Commentary on Rule of Law Resolution (2005)].&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;An independent, impartial judiciary; the presumption of innocence; the right to a fair and public trial without undue delay; a rational and proportionate approach to punishment; a strong and independent legal profession; strict protection of confidential communications between lawyer and client; equality of all before the law; these are all fundamental principles of the Rule of Law. Accordingly, arbitrary arrests; secret trials; indefinite detention without trial; cruel or degrading treatment or punishment; intimidation or corruption in the electoral process, are all unacceptable. The Rule of Law is the foundation of a civilised society. It establishes a transparent process accessible and equal to all. It ensures adherence to principles that both liberate and protect. The IBA calls upon all countries to respect these fundamental principles. It also calls upon its members to speak out in support of the Rule of Law within their respective communities.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===World Justice Project===
As used by the [[World Justice Project]], a non-profit organization committed to advancing the rule of law around the world, the rule of law refers to a rules-based system in which the following four universal principles are upheld:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldjusticeproject.org About the WJP].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
# The government and its officials and agents are accountable under the law;
# The laws are clear, publicized, stable, fair, and protect fundamental rights, including the security of persons and property;
# The process by which the laws are enacted, administered, and enforced is accessible, fair, and efficient;
# Access to justice is provided by competent, independent, and ethical adjudicators, attorneys or representatives, and judicial officers who are of sufficient number, have adequate resources, and reflect the makeup of the communities they serve.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The World Justice Project has developed an Index to measure the extent to which countries adhere to the rule of law in practice. The [[World Justice Project#WJP Rule of Law Index|WJP Rule of Law Index]] is composed of 9 factors and 52 sub-factors, and covers a variety of dimensions of the rule of law—such as whether government officials are accountable under the law, and whether legal institutions protect fundamental rights and allow ordinary people access to justice.&lt;ref&gt;Agrast, M., Botero, J., Ponce, A., WJP [http://worldjusticeproject.org/sites/default/files/wjproli2011_0.pdf Rule of Law Index 2011.] Washington, D.C.: The World Justice Project. (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

===The International Development Law Organization (IDLO)===
The [[International Development Law Organization]] (IDLO) is an intergovernmental organization with a joint focus on the promotion of rule of law and development. It works to empower people and communities to claim their rights, and provides governments with the know-how to realize them.&lt;ref name="IDLO - What we Do"&gt;{{cite web|title=IDLO – What We Do|url=http://www.idlo.int/what-we-do|website=idlo.int|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It supports emerging economies and middle-income countries to strengthen their legal capacity and rule of law framework for sustainable development and economic opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idlo.int/about-idlo/strategic-plan IDLO Strategic Plan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208164000/http://idlo.int/about-idlo/strategic-plan |date=2015-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only intergovernmental organization with an exclusive mandate to promote the rule of law and has experience working in more than 170 countries around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idlo.int/about-idlo/mission-and-history IDLO Mission and History]&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Development Law Organization has a holistic definition of the rule of law:

&lt;blockquote&gt;More than a matter of due process, the rule of law is an enabler of justice and development. The three notions are interdependent; when realized, they are mutually reinforcing. For IDLO, as much as a question of laws and procedure, the rule of law is a culture and daily practice. It is inseparable from equality, from access to justice and education, from access to health and the protection of the most vulnerable. It is crucial for the viability of communities and nations, and for the environment that sustains them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idlo.int/what-we-do/rule-law IDLO – Rule of Law]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

IDLO is headquartered in Rome and has a branch office in [[The Hague]] and has Permanent Observer Status at the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in New York City.

=== The International Network to Promote the Rule of Law (INPROL) ===
The [http://inprol.org International Network to Promote the Rule of Law (INPROL)] is a network of over 3,000 law practitioners from 120 countries and 300 organizations working on rule of law issues in post-conflict and developing countries from a policy, practice and research perspective.  INPROL is based at the US Institute of Peace (USIP) in partnership with the US Department of State Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Strategic Police Matters Unit, the Center of Excellence for Police Stability Unit, and William and Marry School of Law in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://inprol.org/about-inprol |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-02-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202002311/http://inprol.org/about-inprol |archive-date=2017-02-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its affiliate organizations include the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, Folke Bernadotte Academy, International Bar Association, International Association of Chiefs of Police, International Association of Women Police, International Corrections and Prisons Association, International Association for Court Administration, International Security Sector Advisory Team at the Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces, Worldwide Association of Women Forensic Experts (WAWFE), and International Institute for Law and Human Rights.

INPROL provides an online forum for the exchange of information about best practices.  Members may post questions, and expect a response from their fellow rule of law practitioners worldwide on their experiences in addressing rule of law issues.

==In relation to economics==
One important aspect of the rule-of-law initiatives is the study and analysis of the rule of law’s impact on [[economic development]]. The rule-of-law movement cannot be fully successful in transitional and developing countries without an answer to the question: does the rule of law matter for economic development or not?&lt;ref&gt;Luis Flores Ballesteros. "Corruption and development. Does the 'rule of law' factor weigh more than we think?" 54 Pesos May. 2008:54 Pesos 15 Nov 2008. [http://54pesos.org/2008/11/15/corruption-and-development-does-the-%E2%80%9Crule-of-law%E2%80%9D-factor-weigh-more-than-we-think/]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Constitutional economics]] is the study of the compatibility of economic and financial decisions within existing constitutional law frameworks, and such a framework includes government spending on the [[judiciary]], which, in many transitional and [[developing countries]], is completely controlled by the executive. It is useful to distinguish between the two methods of [[political corruption|corruption]] of the judiciary: corruption by the executive branch, in contrast to corruption by private actors.

The standards of [[constitutional economics]] can be used during annual [[budget process]], and if that budget planning is transparent then the rule of law may benefit. The availability of an effective court system, to be used by the [[civil society]] in situations of unfair government spending and executive impoundment of previously authorized appropriations, is a key element for the success of the rule-of-law endeavor.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barenboim, "Defining the rules", ''The European Lawyer'', Issue 90, October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rule of Law is especially important as an influence on the economic development in developing and transitional countries. To date, the term "rule of law" has been used primarily in the English-speaking countries, and it is not yet fully clarified even with regard to such well-established democracies as, for instance, Sweden, Denmark, France, Germany, or Japan. A common language between lawyers of common law and civil law countries as well as between legal communities of developed and developing countries is critically important for research of links between the rule of law and real economy.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barenboim, Natalya Merkulova. [http://philosophicalclub.ru/content/docs/worldruleoflaw.pdf "The 25th Anniversary of Constitutional Economics: The Russian Model and Legal Reform in Russia, in The World Rule of Law Movement and Russian Legal Reform"], edited by Francis Neate and Holly Nielsen, Justitsinform, Moscow (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

The "rule of law" primarily connotes "protection of property rights".&lt;ref name=licht/&gt; The economist [[F. A. Hayek]] analyzed how the rule of law might be beneficial to the free market. Hayek proposed that under the rule of law, individuals would be able to make wise investments and future plans with some confidence in a successful return on investment when he stated: "under the Rule of Law the government is prevented from stultifying individual efforts by ''ad hoc'' action. Within the known rules of the game the individual is free to pursue his personal ends and desires, certain that the powers of government will not be used deliberately to frustrate his efforts."&lt;ref name=Serfdom&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayek|first=F.A.|title=The Road to Serfdom|year=1994|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-32061-8|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have shown that weak rule of law (for example, discretionary regulatory enforcement) discourages investment. Economists have found, for example, that a rise in discretionary regulatory enforcement caused US firms to abandon international investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Graham|first=Brad|last2=Stroup|first2=Caleb|year=2016|title=Does Anti-bribery enforcement deter foreign investment?|url=http://fcpa.stanford.edu/academic-articles/20150511-does-anti-bribery-enforcement-deter-foreign-investment.pdf|journal=Applied Economics Letters|volume=|pages=63–67|via=Taylor and Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In relation to culture==
The Treaty on the Protection of Artistic and Scientific Institutions and Historic Monuments or [[Roerich Pact]] is an inter-American [[treaty]]. The most important idea of the Roerich Pact is the [[legal recognition]] that the defense of [[cultural objects]] is more important than the use or destruction of that culture for military [[defense (military)|purposes]], and the protection of culture always has precedence over any [[military necessity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosophicalclub.ru/content/docs/75th_Anniversary_of_Roerich_Pact_Eng.html Peter Barenboim, Naeem Sidiqi, ''Bruges, the Bridge between Civilizations: The 75 Anniversary of the Roerich Pact, Grid Belgium, 2010]. {{ISBN|978-5-98856-114-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Roerich Pact signed on April 15, 1935 by the representatives of 21 American states in the [[Oval Office]] of the [[White House]] (Washington, DC). It was the first international treaty signed in the Oval Office.&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Stoumatoff, ''FDR's Unfinished Portrait: A Memoir'', University of Pittsburgh Press, 1990, {{ISBN|0-8229-3659-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict]] is the first [[international treaty]] that focuses on the protection of [[cultural property]] in armed conflict. It was signed at [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]] on 14 May 1954 and entered into force on 7 August 1956. As of June 2017, it has been ratified by 128 states.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unesco.org/eri/la/convention.asp?KO=13637&amp;language=E&amp;order=alpha&lt;/ref&gt;

The rule of law can be hampered when there is a disconnect between legal and popular consensus. An example is [[intellectual property]]. Under the auspices of the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]], nominally strong copyright laws have been implemented throughout most of the world; but because the attitude of much of the population does not conform to these laws, a rebellion against ownership rights has manifested in rampant [[copyright infringement|piracy]], including an increase in [[peer-to-peer file sharing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=White Paper: Building a Culture of Respect for the Rule of Law|publisher=American Bar Association|author=Bica-Huiu, Alina}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in Russia, [[tax evasion]] is common and a person who admits he does not pay taxes is not judged or criticized by his colleagues and friends, because the tax system is viewed as unreasonable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www2.gwu.edu/~ieresgwu/assets/docs/demokratizatsiya%20archive/07-02_pope.pdf|title=The Rule of Law and Russian Culture – Are They Compatible?|author=Pope, Ronald R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bribery]] likewise has different normative implications across cultures.&lt;ref name=licht&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Comparative Economics|volume=35|issue=4|date=December 2007|pages=659–688|title=Culture rules: The foundations of the rule of law and other norms of governance|author=Licht, Amir N.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
The Rule of Law has been criticised by several scholars, authors, philosophers and activists as unrealistic, hypocritical or dangerous.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Author [[Peter Gelderloos]] argues that attempting to create a specialised class of judicial authority that is separate from the community will inevitably lead to corruption. He points out that nonviolent drug-related offences receive far more police and media attention than workplace injuries or pollution, which kill far more people each year. He argues that [[restorative justice]] is a far more effective and humane alternative to prisons, courts and the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anarchy Works|last=Gelderloos|first=Peter|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Samuel George Morton''' (January 26, 1799 – May 15, 1851) was an American physician and [[natural scientist]]. Morton, who was reared a Quaker but became Episcopalian in midlife, was born in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, attended [[Westtown School]], and graduated from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1820.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.penn.museum/sites/morton/life.php&lt;/ref&gt; After earning an advanced degree from the [[University of Edinburgh]] in Scotland, he began practice in Philadelphia in 1824. He was one of the founders of the [[Gettysburg College#History|Pennsylvania Medical College]] in Philadelphia&lt;ref name="extinct"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/medical/extinct.html | title=Extinct Philadelphia Medical Schools | work=Philadelphia Medical History and the University of Pennsylvania | publisher=University of Pennsylvania, University Archives and Records Center | accessdate=April 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and served as its professor of [[anatomy]] from 1839 until his resignation 1843.&lt;ref name="Memoir"&gt;{{cite wikisource |title=A Biographical Memoir of Samuel George Morton, M.D. |wslink=A Biographical Memoir of Samuel George Morton, M.D. | author=Wood, George Bacon | authorlink=George Bacon Wood |year=1853 |publisher=T.

Collins |location=Philadelphia}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]] in 1844.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlistm American Antiquarian Society Members Directory]&lt;/ref&gt;

Morton was a prolific writer of books on various subjects from 1823 to 1851. He wrote ''Geological Observations'' in 1828, and both ''Synopsis of the Organic Remains of the Cretaceous Group of the United States'' and ''Illustrations of Pulmonary Consumption'' in 1834. His first medical essay, on the user of cornine in intermittent fever, in 1825 was published in the ''[[Philadelphia Journal of the Medical and Physical Sciences]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Introductory lectures and addresses on medical subjects : delivered chiefly before the medical classes of the University of Pennsylvania / by George B.

=="American School" ethnography==
Samuel George Morton is often thought of as the originator of "American School" [[ethnography]], a school of thought in [[Antebellum era|antebellum]] American science that claimed the difference between humans was one of [[species]] rather than [[Variety (biology)|variety]] and is seen by some as the origin of [[scientific racism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fredrickson |first=George M. |title=The Black Image in the White Mind: The Debate on African-American Character and Destiny, 1817–1914 |location=New York |publisher=Harper Torchbooks |year=1972 |page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morton argued against the single creation story of the Bible ([[monogenism]]) and instead supported a theory of multiple racial creations ([[polygenism]]). Morton claimed the Bible supported polygenism, and within working in a biblical framework his theory held that each race had been created separately and each was given specific, irrevocable characteristics.&lt;ref name="David Hurst Thomas 2001, pp. 38"&gt;David Hurst Thomas, Skull Wars Kennewick Man, Archaeology, And The Battle For Native American Identity, 2001, pp. 38 – 41&lt;/ref&gt;

After inspecting three mummies from ancient Egyptian catacombs, Morton concluded that Caucasians and Negroes were already distinct three thousand years ago. Since the Bible indicated that [[Noah's Ark]] had washed up on [[Mount Ararat]], only a thousand years ago before this, Morton claimed that Noah's sons could not possibly account for every race on earth. According to Morton's theory of polygenesis, races have been separate since the start.&lt;ref name="David Hurst Thomas 2001, pp. 38"/&gt;

Morton claimed that he could define the intellectual ability of a race by the [[Human skull|skull]] capacity. A large volume meant a large brain and high intellectual capacity, and a small skull indicated a small brain and decreased intellectual capacity. He was reputed to hold the largest collection of skulls, on which he based his research. He claimed that each race had a separate origin, and that a descending order of intelligence could be discerned that placed [[Caucasian race|Caucasians]] at the pinnacle and [[Negroes]] at the lowest point, with various other race groups in between.&lt;ref name=Bates1995p225 /&gt; Morton had many skulls from ancient Egypt, and concluded that the [[ancient Egyptians]] were not [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]], but were Caucasian. His results were published in three volumes between 1839 and 1849: the ''Crania Americana'', ''An Inquiry into the Distinctive Characteristics of the Aboriginal Race of America'' and ''Crania Aegyptiaca''.&lt;ref name=Bates1995p225 /&gt; Morton's skull collection was held at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia until 1966, when it was transferred to the Penn Museum, where it is presently curated.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.penn.museum/sites/morton/collection.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Morton's theories were very popular in his day, and he was a highly respected physician and scientist. The anthropologist [[Aleš Hrdlička]] called Morton "the father of American physical anthropology".&lt;ref&gt;Clark Spencer Larsen, A Companion to Biological Anthropology, 2010, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Crispin Bates has noted that Morton's "systematic justification" for the separation of races, along with the work of [[Louis Agassiz]], was also used by those who favoured slavery in the United States, with the ''[[Charleston Medical Journal]]'' noting at his death that "We of the South should consider him as our benefactor for aiding most materially in giving to the negro his true position as an inferior race."&lt;ref name=Bates1995p225&gt;{{cite book |title=The Concept of Race in South Asia |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Delhi |year=1995 |editor-first=Peter |editor-last=Robb |first=Crispin |last=Bates |chapter=Race, Caste and Tribe in Central India: the early origins of Indian anthropometry |isbn=978-0-19-563767-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PwNkQgAACAAJ |page=225 |accessdate=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Craniology===
[[File:Morton-Frontispiece-Types-of-Mankind.jpg|thumb|250px|Engraving of Morton from the frontispiece to ''Types of Mankind'' by Nott and Gliddon]]
Morton claimed in his ''Crania Americana'' that the Caucasians had the biggest brains, averaging 87 cubic inches (1,426 cc), Indians were in the middle with an average of 82 cubic inches (1,344 cc) and Negroes had the smallest brains with an average of 78 cubic inches (1,278 cc).&lt;ref name="David Hurst Thomas 2001, pp. 38"/&gt; Morton believed that the skulls of each race were so different that a wise creator from the beginning had created each race and positioned them in separate homelands to dwell in.&lt;ref&gt;John P. Jackson, Nadine M. Weidman, Race, racism, and science: social impact and interaction, 2005, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

Morton believed that cranial capacity determined intellectual ability, and he used his craniometric evidence in conjunction with his analysis of anthropological literature then available to argue in favor of a racial hierarchy which put Caucasians on the top rung and Africans on the bottom. His skull measurements (by volume) then came to serve as "evidence" for racial stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://canada.metropolis.net/EVENTS/ethnocultural/publications/historical.pdf | title=The Historical Construction of Racial Identity and Implications for Reconciliation | year=2001 | accessdate=April 24, 2015 | author=Backhouse, Constance | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131195914/http://canada.metropolis.net/EVENTS/ethnocultural/publications/historical.pdf | archivedate=January 31, 2017 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He described the Caucasian as "distinguished by the facility with which it attains the highest intellectual endowments"; Native Americans were described as "averse to cultivation, and slow in acquiring knowledge; restless, revengeful, and fond of war, and wholly destitute of maritime adventure" and the Africans he described as "joyous, flexible, and indolent; while the many nations which compose this race present a singular diversity of intellectual character, of which the far extreme is the lowest grade of humanity".&lt;ref&gt;Menand, L. (2001). Morton, Agassiz, and the origins of scientific racism in the United States. Journal of Blacks in Higher Education, 110-113.  Even in his time, some physicians opposed the idea that there were differences in average cranial size across races.  The German physician [[Friedrich Tiedemann]], for instance, argued vigorously that previous scholars who found differences in cranial size across races were wrong in their measurements (or in some cases had too small a sample to draw inferences). Tiedemann advanced this in 1838 in his paper [http://rstl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/126/497.full.pdf On the Brain of the Negro Compared with that of the European and the Ourang-Outang.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Morton's followers, particularly [[Josiah C. Nott]] and [[George Gliddon]] in their monumental tribute to Morton's work, ''Types of Mankind'' (1854), carried Morton's ideas further and backed up his findings which supported the notion of [[polygenism]] – the premise that the different races were separately created by God. The publication of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On The Origin of Species]]'' in 1859 changed the nature of the scholarly debate.&lt;ref name=Bates1995p225 /&gt;

==Criticism==

===Allegations of bias in data collection===
In a 1978 paper&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S. J. (1978). [http://www.colorado.edu/MCDB/MCDB4234/readings/Morton-Skulls-Gould.pdf "Morton's Ranking of Races by Cranial Capacity."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110618000422/http://www.colorado.edu/MCDB/MCDB4234/readings/Morton-Skulls-Gould.pdf |date=2011-06-18 }} ''Science'' 200 (May 5): 503–509.&lt;/ref&gt; and later in ''[[The Mismeasure of Man]]'' (1981), [[Stephen Jay Gould]] asserted that Morton had, perhaps because of an unconscious bias, selectively reported data, manipulated sample compositions, made analytical errors, and mismeasured skulls in order to support his prejudicial views on [[Race and intelligence|intelligence differences]] between different populations. Gould's book became widely read and Morton came to be considered one of the main cases of the effects of unconscious bias in data collection, and as one of the main figures in the early history of scientific racism.

Subsequently, two separate studies of Morton's data and methods, one conducted in 1988 and the other in 2011, argued that Gould had overstated or misrepresented the case, and that Morton's measurement's were essentially correct.&lt;ref&gt;Wade, Nicholas (2011). [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/14/science/14skull.html?_r=1&amp;ref=science "Scientists Measure the Accuracy of a Racism Claim."] ''The New York Times'' (June 14): D4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the latter study, entitled "The Mismeasure of Science: Stephen Jay Gould versus Samuel George Morton on Skulls and Bias"&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, J., D. DeGusta, M. Meyer, J. Monge, A. Mann, and R. Holloway (2011). [http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001071 "The Mismeasure of Science."] ''Public Library of Science Biology'' 9 (6): e1001071.&lt;/ref&gt; and authored by six [[anthropology|anthropologists]], it was concluded that the bias came from Gould, who failed to examine and remeasure the crania in order to determine Morton's level of accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Morton collection of skulls at center of controversy. June 16, 2011.  http://www.physorg.com/news/2011-06-samuel-morton-skulls-center-controversy.html&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this study was reviewed in an editorial in ''Nature'', which recommended a degree of caution, stating "the critique leaves the majority of Gould's work unscathed," and noted that "because they couldn't measure all the skulls, they do not know whether the average cranial capacities that Morton reported represent his sample accurately."&lt;ref name="Nature2011"&gt;Editorial (2011). [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v474/n7352/full/474419a.html "Mismeasure for mismeasure."] ''Nature'' 474 (23 June): 419.&lt;/ref&gt; The journal stated that Gould's opposition to racism may have biased his interpretation of Morton's data, but also noted that "Lewis and his colleagues have their own motivations. Several in the group have an association with the [[University of Pennsylvania]], and have an interest in seeing the valuable but understudied skull collection freed from the stigma of bias" and did not accept Gould's theory "that the scientific method is inevitably tainted by bias."&lt;ref name="Nature2011"/&gt;

A 2014 review of the paper by University of Pennsylvania philosophy professor Michael Weisberg, tended to support Gould's original accusations, concluding that "there is prima facie evidence of a racial bias in Morton's measurements". Weisberg concludes that although Gould did commit mistakes in his own treatment, Morton's work "remains a cautionary example of racial bias in the science of human differences".&lt;ref&gt;Weisberg, M. (2014), Remeasuring man. Evolution &amp; Development, 16: 166–178. doi: 10.1111/ede.12077&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biases in Data Interpretation===

Research by Paul Wolff Mitchell in 2018 argues that Morton was nevertheless guilty of bias, though not in data collection. Mitchell argues that Morton's interpretation of his data was erroneous; he investigated averages and ignored variations in skull size so large that there was significant overlap. A contemporary of Morton, Friedrich Tiedemann, had collected similar skull data and drawn conclusions opposite to Morton's on the basis of this overlap.   &lt;ref&gt; Ars Technica [https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/10/theres-new-evidence-confirming-bias-of-the-father-of-scientific-racism/ "There’s new evidence confirming bias of the “father of scientific racism”]&lt;\ref&gt;

According to the post-1900 publications of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;i.e. the writings of [[C. W. Leadbeater]], [[Annie Besant]], etc., as well as those authors influenced by the theosophical teachings such as [[Alice A. Bailey]], and [[Benjamin Creme]], and the [[Ascended Master Teachings]] of [[Guy Ballard]], [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]],  [[Geraldine Innocente]], [[Joshua David Stone]], and other Ascended Master Teachings / teachers,&lt;/ref&gt; '''Lord Sunat Kumara'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://ascension-research.org/sanat.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luisprada.com/Protected/a_progress_report_on_our_ascension.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; is an "Advanced Being" at the [[Initiation (Theosophy)|Ninth level of initiation]] who is regarded as the 'Lord' or 'Regent' of [[Earth]] and of the [[Human race|humanity]], and is thought to be the head of the [[Spiritual Hierarchy]] of Earth who dwells in [[Shamballah]] (also known as 'The City of Enoch').

Shamballah is said by the adherents to the Ascended Master Teachings, to be a floating city manifested on the [[etheric plane]] somewhere above the [[Gobi Desert]] in the borderlands of [[Mongolia]].&lt;ref&gt;(See: '[[Autobiography of a Yogi]]' By [[Yogananda Paramahansa]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[A Tibetan Journey]] By Alexandra David-Neale. 1923.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Great White Brotherhood]] is a spiritual 'fraternity' of Ascended Beings, including Lord Sunat Kumara, long since dedicated to the eventual Salvation of Mankind and the establishment of Divine Law again in this Three-dimensional reality.

According to Elizabeth Van Buren, the Brotherhood once maintained (earthly) headquarters hidden in a remote valley near a sacred lake in old Tibet, until relatively recently, when, possibly due to the surmised threat of Communist China, they withdrew, allegedly through subterranean tunnels to an alternative earthly location in [[Peru]], where they are still reported as having an earth base (circa 1985).&lt;ref&gt;[[Authors Notes: 'The Refuge of the Apocalypse.]] By Elizabeth Van Buren. 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

These authors believe that Lord Sunat Kumara is the founder of the Great White Brotherhood, composed of [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]] (called in the Ascended Master Teachings [[Ascended Master]]s) and volunteers from other worlds who have joined together to advance spiritual evolution on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder, Werner ''Ascended Masters and Their Retreats'' Ascended Master Teaching Foundation 2004. Describes the founding of Shamballah by Sunat Kumara&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sanat Kumara in Hinduism==
Sanat Kumara appears as a [[rishi]] in the [[Hindu]] [[religious text]] the [[Chandogya Upanishad]]. A shrine to Sanat Kumara which attracts and unites people of all religions and faiths is situated in the town of [[Kataragama]], [[Sri Lanka]]. In Sanskrit, "Sanat Kumara" is "Eternal Youth" (from [[Sant (religion)|Sanat]] "eternal", Ku "with difficulty" and Mara "mortal"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danijel.org/index.php?id=clanak&amp;articleID=161&amp;pageID=22 O znalcima vraga] — Danijel Turina&lt;/ref&gt;).

The Kumar resides in the most sublime center of our planet, [[Shamballa]], the [[sahasrara]] of the world.  The Kumara has several names, relating to the sahasrara centers of different Systemic Existences: At the Supra-Cosmic plane, he is called ''Sanatana''; at the Cosmic plane, it is ''Subrahmanya''; at the Solar plane, the Kumara is ''Sanaka''; at the Planetary plane, it is ''Sanandana''; and on this planet, it is ''Sanath'' Kumara. So Sanath Kumara is an aspect of Kumara that resides in Shamballa.

Scriptures, especially the [[Mahabharata]], say that it is Sanath Kumara who comes down to help the Divine Plan of Creation, when [[Lord Krishna]] came to be. He was born to Lord Krishna as his son, and he was named [[Pradyumna]]. Sanath Kumara incarnates himself through the Divine Mother [[Rukmini]] as Pradyumna. On completion of his work, He again gets back to his original position and takes to the seat in Shambala as Sanath Kumara. These details are given in the last chapters of [[Mahabharata]].

==Shamballa in Buddhism – home of the King of the World==

''Shambhala'' ([[Wylie transliteration|Tib]]. ''bde 'byung'') in [[Vajrayana Buddhism]] (the religion of [[Tibet]]) is a [[Sanskrit]] term meaning "place of peace/tranquility/happiness". [[Gautama Buddha]] is said by Vajrayana Buddhists to have taught the [[Kalachakra]] [[tantra]] on request of King [[Suchandra]] of Shambhala; the teachings are also said to be preserved in Shamballa.  The [[Stanzas of Dzyan]] from which [[Madame Blavatsky]] claimed to have gotten the information in [[The Secret Doctrine]] are believed by some scholars to have been a mistranslation of words ''Kalachakra tantra'' (''rGyud-sde'' in [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]]).&lt;ref&gt;Reigle, David and Nancy ''Blavatsky's Secret Books'' San Diego 1999. {{ISBN|0-913510-76-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shambhala is ruled over by a line of [[Kings of Shambhala]] known as [[Kulika]] or [[Kalki]] Kings (Tib. ''Rigden''), a monarch who upholds the integrity of the ''Kalachakra tantra''. In the teachings of Vajrayana Buddhism, the King of Shamballa is often metaphorically referred to as ''The King of the World''.  Shamballa was thought by the [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]]s to be somewhere north of [[Lake Manasarovar]] and its adjacent [[Mount Kailash|Mount Kailasa]], a [[sacred mountain]] in Tibet where it is thought that all the [[Ley line|dragon current]]s intersect.

==The Defender Lord at Kurama Temple==
The ancient Buddhist temple, [[Kurama-dera]] in [[Japan]], is host to a unique bodhisattva, the "Defender Lord", who is said to come from the planet Venus 6.5 million years ago. He is described as having the appearance of a 16-year-old boy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Sanat Kumara in Theosophy==
{{Theosophy}}
Sanat Kumara  was mentioned briefly  by the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophist]] [[Helena Blavatsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, Helena Petrovna ''The Secret Doctrine: The Synthesis of Science, Religion, and Philosophy'' – Theosophical Publishing House, 1888. Sanat Kumara – Volume I: 89, 457–458; Volume II: pages 106, 140, 319, 584.&lt;/ref&gt; She claimed he belonged to a group of beings, the "Lords of the Flame", whom Christian tradition has presented as [[Lucifer]] and the fallen angels.&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, Helena Petrovna ''The Secret Doctrine: The Synthesis of Science, Religion, and Philosophy'' – Theosophical Publishing House, 1888. Volume II pp 243 ff&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanat Kumara gained greater prominence when Blavatsky's close-friend and colleague  [[Charles W. Leadbeater]] wrote that Sanat Kumara was the "King" or ''Lord of the World'', and the head of the [[Great White Brotherhood]] of [[Mahatma]]s who had revealed the principles of theosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1925 (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing, 1997) Pages 296–299&lt;/ref&gt;

Later authors who draw from Theosophical teachings such as [[Alice Bailey]] and [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]] have added to the story with further details. He is usually depicted as having the appearance of a 16-year-old boy, said to be the incarnation of the Will of the Logos, and purportedly possesses an unaging body not born of mortal woman.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=q6xVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA207&amp;lpg=PA207&amp;dq=sanat+kumara+theosophy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ts3XnQyt-F&amp;sig=IEXRZ-Z1gLLBh6-bQnczyiul1BM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiP-I-i6bvKAhXGlh4KHbeKBhk4FBDoAQgbMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=sanat%20kumara%20theosophy&amp;f=false First Principles of Theosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Descent of Sanat Kumara and the Lords of the Living Flame from Venus==
C.W. Leadbeater and later adherents of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] such as Alice A. Bailey believe that Sanat Kumara descended from the [[etheric plane]] of the planet [[Venus]] to [[Earth]] 18,500,000 years ago (A.E. Powell gives a figure of 16,500,000 years ago; [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]] of [[Church Universal and Triumphant]] does not give a specific date but says it was a minimum of 2,500,000 years ago). In [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], the beings that helped Sanat Kumara organize the expedition from [[Venus]] are called the "Lords of the Flame".  C.W. Leadbeater and [[Annie Besant]] said that Sanat Kumara brought 30 "Lords of the Flame" with him from Venus to help him set up his colony.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1925 (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing, 1997) Page 299&lt;/ref&gt; In the later version of the story promulgated by [[Guy Ballard]], notable "Lords of the Flame" include [[Gautama Buddha]], and the [[World Teacher]] (the being referred to alternately as [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]] or [[Christ]] by [[Benjamin Creme]]). [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]]'s [[Church Universal and Triumphant]] teaches that Sanat Kumara and the Lords of the Flame also brought [[144,000]] souls with them from Venus. Alice Bailey, on the other hand, gives the number 105 only. The prior incarnation and only incarnation of Maitreya, the Lord of Consciousness, according to some interpretations (not C.W. Leadbeater's), is Gauthama Siddartha Sakyamuni / Lord Buddha; according to these interpretations, he essentially 'overshadowed' the body of Gautama Siddhartha Buddha with Siddhartha's permission.

Sanat Kumara is regarded as the great guru, saviour of Earth. Believers in him see him in all the major religions, as [[Murugan|Skanda]]/[[Kartikkeya]] in [[Hinduism]], [[Brahma]]-'''Sanam Kumar''' in [[Buddhism]], the [[Ancient of Days]] in [[Judeo-Christian]] traditions, and identify him as [[Ahura Mazda]] in [[Zoroastrianism]] (although the last of these claims is contested from a lack of information on the subject). It is also considered that Sanat Kumara is [[Al Khdir]] (green man) known to [[Sufi]] Muslims (according to [[Dakshinamurti]]).

It is maintained in most of these versions of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] that [[Venus]], the 'Planet of Love', is the most spiritually advanced [[planet]] of our [[solar system]]. The beings living on the [[etheric plane]] of [[Venus]] are said to be hundreds of millions of years ahead of us in their spiritual evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, A.E. ''The Solar System'' London: 1930 The Theosophical Publishing House (A Complete Outline of the Theosophical Scheme of Evolution) See chart on Page 33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiritofra.com/EC_etheric_planes.htm Planetary Schemes of Our Solar System According to Theosophy:]&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that the governing council of [[Venus]] – the ''Seven Holy Kumars'' – sent one of themselves, Sanat Kumara, here to guide us.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth &amp; Mark Clare Prophet (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana: 2003 Summit University Press, pages 339–341&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Theosophy, once Sanat Kumara arrived here, he directed the construction of the city of Shamballa on the [[etheric plane]] above the [[Gobi Desert]] to serve as his headquarters. Elizabeth Clare Prophet teaches that Shamballa was built physically on the White Island in the Gobi Sea (now the Gobi Desert), and was only later withdrawn from the physical to the etheric plane.

==City plan of Shamballa==
The main temple of Shamballa is topped with a [[Gold (color)|golden]] dome and is surrounded by seven smaller temples—one for each of the seven rays.  These temples are located on a number of wide [[boulevard]]s resembling the [[Champs-Elysees]].&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth &amp; Mark Clare Prophet, (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Pages 465–470 Shamballa&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Elizabeth Clare Prophet, [[George Washington]] was divinely inspired by the Ascended Masters to choose [[city planner]] [[Pierre L'Enfant]] to create the [[city plan]] of [[Washington DC]] which, it is claimed, he unconsciously modeled on the plan of the city of Shamballa.

==Appellations (titles) of Sanat Kumara==
The most common title attributed to Lord Sanat Kumara in the Theosophical religious tradition is "Lord of the World". [[C.W. Leadbeater]] also states that an important duty of Sanat Kumara is to participate in an elaborate ritual every [[Wesak]] (the Full Moon of May) led by [[Gautama Buddha]], and also participated in by the [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]] (the being Theosophists identify as [[Christ]]), in which [[Spiritual energy|cosmic energy]] is focused from the "Solar Logos" to Earth in order to keep our planet's cosmic energy in balance.  The ritual is said to take place in a ravine in southern [[Tibet]] (the Frontispiece of Leadbeater's book ''The Masters and the Path'' has a picture of the ritual taking place) and, it is stated by Leadbeater, can be viewed by in the [[etheric body]] or in the [[physical body]] by those who have [[third eye|etheric sight]].&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House 1929 (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing 1997) – Fold-out picture facing the title page of the book shows a picture of Lord Sananda Buddha performing the Wesak ritual&lt;/ref&gt;

Paradoxically, two other common appellations of Sanat Kumara are two opposite titles: "The Ancient of Days" (because he has been on [[Earth]] millions of years) and "The Youth of Sixteen Summers" (because even though he is millions of years old, he still looks like he is 16 years old).  Another of his titles is "The One Initiator" because it is said by C. W. Leadbeater in the ''Masters and the Path'' that he personally performs the initiation ceremony for anyone who has reached the third level of spiritual [[Initiation (Theosophy)|initiation]].  [[Alice A. Bailey]] indicates the same in her writings.

In the all organizations subscribing to the "''Ascended Master Teachings''", Sanat Kumara is presented  as an [[Ascended master|Ascended Master]]. He is also currently, according to the Ascended Master Teachings, known as the "Regent Lord of the World" in deference to [[Gautama Buddha]] having taken the office of "Lord of the World". (1956).&lt;ref&gt;Luk, A.D.K.. ''Law of Life – Book II''. Pueblo, Colorado: A.D.K. Luk Publications 1989. Describes Sanat Kumara and his role in founding the Brotherhood on Earth and passing the office of "Lord of the World" to Lord Sananda.&lt;/ref&gt; With Sananda Buddha taking on more of the day-to-day administrative tasks of governing the planet, this arrangement allows Sanat Kumara more time for the long-range [[Milky Way Galaxy|galactic]] planning and interstellar diplomacy that is necessary for him to prepare Earth for its eventual admission to what [[Joshua David Stone]] calls the [[Spiritual Hierarchy#Galactic Confederation of Planets|Galactic Confederation of Planets]].

Sanat Kumara's symbol of the authority of his office as ''Lord of the World'' is a {{convert|2|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}}, {{convert|2|in|mm|adj=mid|-wide}} [[magic wand]] called the ''Rod of Power'' made of the metal [[orichalcum]], with cone-shaped [[diamond]]s on each end.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House 1925 Pages 268–269&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lady Master Venus==
[[The Bridge to Freedom]], [[Church Universal and Triumphant]] and all other "[[Ascended Master Teachings]]" organizations believe that Sanat Kumara has a ''Divine Complement'' (''Twin Flame'') (i.e., a ''celestial wife'') – '''Lady Master Venus'''[http://www.missionstgermain.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/ladymastervenus.jpg]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.missionstgermain.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/ladymastervenus.jpg Image of Lady Master Venus shown above is originally from the Church Universal and Triumphant):]&lt;/ref&gt; – the New Age "[[goddess|Goddess of Love]]".&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Annice ''The Masters and Their Retreats '' Summit Lighthouse Library June 2003, Summarizes the beliefs about Sanat Kumara by The I AM Activity, The Bridge to Freedom, and The Summit Lighthouse&lt;/ref&gt; The Ascended ''Lady Master Venus'' is usually depicted as having the appearance of a 16-year-old girl.  Sanat Kumara is believed to have [[Marriage|married]] Lady Master Venus millions of years ago on Venus before he came to Earth.

==Lady Master Meta==

According to the Ascended Master Teachings, Sanat Kumara and the Lady Master Venus have a daughter named the '''Lady Master Meta''' [http://www.ethericretreats.com/images/meta.jpg] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethericretreats.com/meta.htm Source of (not very clear) Image of the Lady Master Meta—Etheric Retreats website:]&lt;/ref&gt; who they brought with them from Venus.  She is said to have incarnated as an [[Avatar]] in Atlantis (where she served as the [[high priestess]] at the ''Temple of Healing'') and in [[Sassanian Empire|Sassanian Persia]], where she married a [[wikt:mortality|mortal]] and had three children.  In the Ascended Master Teachings, she is revered as the ''Goddess of Healing'' and is the patron deity of [[physician|doctor]]s and [[nurse]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press, pages 227–228 Lady Master Meta&lt;/ref&gt; Since she is [[Immortality|immortal]], possessing a celestial body like Sanat Kumara and the Lady Master Venus, she, like the Lady Master Venus, also has the appearance of a 16-year-old girl.

==Master Cha Ara==

According to the Ascended Master Teachings, the '''Master Cha Ara''' [http://www.worldglobalexpress.com/BofLight/CHA-ARA.JPG ] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldglobalexpress.com/brotherhoodoflight.htm Source of Image of Master Cha Ara – World Global Express Brotherhood of Light:]&lt;/ref&gt;
was originally one of the three children of Lady Master Meta when she incarnated as an Avatar in [[Sassanian empire|Sassanian Persia]].  He became a master [[alchemy|alchemist]] who formulated an [[elixir of immortality]] made from [[Rose|rose petals]], tea leaves from mcleod ganj and other ingredients.  This enabled him to quickly achieve ascended masterhood.  He uses small amounts of the elixir to heal people.  He is the protector of all [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]].  He works with [[St. Germain (Theosophy)|St. Germain]] to bring about the New Age in the West [[Americas]].  Lady Master Meta’s husband and her other two children from her descent as an Avatar to Sassanian Persia have also become ascended masters but their names have not yet been revealed.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Page 52 Master Cha Ara; pages 227–228 Lady Master Meta&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lady Master Nada==

In the [[Ascended Master Teachings]], a group of religions based on [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], '''Lady Master Nada'''&lt;ref&gt;Artist concept:[http://www.summitlh.com/minneapolis/chohans/chohans_files/_notes/nada-lrg-n.jpg] - source of image Summit Lighthouse Teaching Center (Minneapolis-St. Paul, USA)&lt;/ref&gt; is the "Chohan of the Sixth Ray" (see [[Seven Rays]]), and is the [[Ascended master|Ascended Lady Master]] governing humanity's development of the Divine Qualities of Ministration, Service, and Peace. The colors of her [[Seven Rays|Ray]] are [[purple]] and [[Gold (color)|gold]], and also [[Ruby (color)|ruby]].&lt;ref name="Life Book II"&gt;Luk, A.D.K.. ''Law of Life – Book II''. Pueblo, Colorado: A.D.K. Luk Publications 1989, Listing of Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity and [[The Bridge to Freedom]]&lt;/ref&gt;

She is also considered a Member of the [[Sanat Kumara#Sanat Kumara's cosmic bureaucracy|Karmic Board]]; she handles the appeals of those on the [[Seven Rays|third ray]].  She is believed by those adherent to the Ascended Master Teachings to have succeeded the previous Chohan, the '''Master Jesus / Sananda Buddha''', on January 1, 1956, when she is said to have fully taken on the Office of Chohan of the Sixth Ray.,&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Annice ''The Masters and Their Retreats '' Summit Lighthouse Library June 2003, Listing of Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity, The Bridge to Freedom, and [[The Summit Lighthouse]] Pages 144 and 240&lt;/ref&gt; thus advancing from the [[Initiation (Theosophy)|fifth to the sixth level of initiation]].  She primarily serves at ''Arabian  Retreat'' in the [[Arabian Peninsula]], northeast of the [[Red Sea]].&lt;ref name="Life Book II" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shearer, Monroe &amp; Carolyn ''I AM Adorations, Affirmations &amp; Rhythmic Decrees'' Acropolis Sophia Books and Works 1998, Listing of Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity, The Bridge to Freedom, The Summit Lighthouse, and The Temple of The Presence&lt;/ref&gt; Nada serves there with the Brothers and Sisters of the [[Indigo]] Cape, as well as with [[Master Jesus|Jesus]], his [[Mother Mary]] and El Samyam, the  Chief of the Arabian Council.&lt;ref&gt;King, Godfre Ray. ''The Magic Presence''. The Compt de Saint-Germain Press 1935. Chapter 10&lt;/ref&gt; She also serves at ''The [[Rose (color)|Rose]] Temple'', located on the [[etheric plane]] above [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]]. Designed after the pattern of a [[rose]], with each "petal" being a room, this Retreat is the etheric counterpart of the "Temple of Love" on [[Root race#The civilization of Atlantis|Atlantis]] where Nada once served as a High Priestess.  In another human incarnate life in Atlantis, she was a [[lawyer]].&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder, Werner ''Ascended Masters and Their Retreats'' Ascended Master Teaching Foundation 2004, Listing of those who are believed to be Ascended Masters by The [[I AM Activity]] and The Bridge to Freedom&lt;/ref&gt; She was described as having raised her body and [[Initiation (Theosophy)|Ascended]] approximately 2,776 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;King, Godfre Ray. ''The I AM Discourses''. Saint Germain Press 1935. page 74&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Lady Master Nada's home residence (called in the Ascended Master Teachings her "retreat") is underground on the etheric plane on the Arabian peninsula, according to the Ascended Master Teachings, she teleports to Shamballa every workday to her day job on the [[Sanat Kumara#Sanat Kumara's cosmic bureaucracy|Karmic Board]], hearing the cases of those souls who are on the third ray.

==Masters of the Ancient Wisdom==

According to  the [["I AM" Activity]], the [[Church Universal and Triumphant]]&lt;ref&gt;Shearer, Monroe &amp; Carolyn ''I AM Adorations, Affirmations &amp; Rhythmic Decrees'' Acropolis Sophia Books and Works 1998. Refers also to the other six Kumars that assist Sanat Kumara&lt;/ref&gt; and others, the [[Ascended Master]]s (The great beings the original Theosophists called the "[[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]]"), such as the [[Master Jesus]], [[Count of St Germain|Saint Germain]], '''Megha Alcorn''' aka '''Megan Sebastian''' on [[Earth]],   [[Kuthumi]], '''Hatton''', [[Gopal Das]] and others are working for the [[Spiritual Hierarchy]] of our planet, under the leadership of Lord Sanat Kumara, [[Gautama Buddha]], and [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]].  Many theosophists believe the "Masters" utilize the cosmic power of the [[Seven Rays]] to advance the ''Plan of the Masters'' to encourage the continual advance of [[civilization]] on [[Earth]] toward higher [[Initiation (Theosophy)|levels of consciousness]]. One of the beliefs of adherents of these belief systems is that the Masters of Wisdom have united together in an organization called the ''[[Great White Brotherhood]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Great White Brotherhood in the Culture, History and Religion of America''. Summit University Press 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sanat Kumara is also often referred to as the manifestation of the 'Solar Logos'==

The Theosophist '''A.E. Powell''' stated that Sanat Kumara (whom he refers to as the ''Lord of the World'') is in continuous telepathic rapport with '''ANNA''' / [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], the ''Spirit of the Earth'' (i.e., the ''Planetary Logos'' – equivalent to the goddess known in some religions as [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] or as Prithivi in Hinduism).&lt;ref&gt;Powell, A.E. ''The Solar System'' London:1930 The Theosophical Publishing House (A Complete Outline of the Theosophical Scheme of Evolution)&lt;/ref&gt;[[C.W. Leadbeater]] and [[Alice A. Bailey]] stated that Sanat Kumara is in continuous [[Telepathy|telepathic]] rapport with the [[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings functioning within the Sun|Solar Logos]] (the Being considered by Theosophists as the consciousness of the [[Sun]]). It is believed in Theosophy that Sanat Kumara captures the mystical power of the [[Seven Rays]] from the Solar Logos and distributes it to his assistants who guide the spiritual evolution of humanity, the ''Masters of the Ancient Wisdom'' (the Ascended Masters), who then focus the power to us.  An intermediate trinity of [[Pratyeka]]-Buddhas assists Lord Buddha in stepping down this power from Sanat Kumara to Earth's [[Spiritual Hierarchy]], and these Buddhas are also said to be Kumars originally from Venus.

==The council chamber of the Lord of the World==

According to the ''[[Alice Bailey#Bibliography|Alice A. Bailey material]]'', Lord Sanat Kumara conducts business in an enormous room in his palace called ''The Council Chamber of the Lord of the World''.  It is here that he regularly meets with [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]], the '''Maha Chohan''', [[Djwal Khul]], [[St. Germain (Theosophy)|St. Germain]], the [[Master Jesus]] and the other [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]], of which it is said there are 24 principal council members, to assess the progress being made in implementing ''The Plan of the Masters'' to bring the [[human race]] to [[Level of consciousness|higher levels of consciousness]].  According to C.W. Leadbeater, it is also here that he periodically personally receives ambassadors from [[Planetary system|other solar systems]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Leadbeater, C.W.  ''The Masters and the Path''  Adyar, Madras, India: 1925 – Theosophical Publishing House&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sanat Kumara's cosmic bureaucracy==

According to the ''[[Alice Bailey#Bibliography|Alice A. Bailey material]]'', Sanat Kumara has many assistants who help him in his arduous task of spiritually governing Earth as its presiding Regent. 
These include '''The Watcher''' (also called the ''Silent Watcher'' or the ''Great Silent Watcher''), whose function it is to continually watch the [[Akashic records]] and download daily all the [[information]] on them relevant to the life waves of Earth and forward it to the ''Custodian of the Hall of Records''.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W.

Bailey calls the '''Custodian of the Hall of Records''' (called the '''Keeper of the Scrolls''' in the Ascended Master Teachings), the being who is in charge of the ''Hall of Records'', an enormous administrative complex near Sanat Kumara’s palace in the etheric city of Shamballa—this is where the ''Recording Angels'' and those souls who are between incarnations who volunteer to give up their time in [[The Summerland#Summerland in Theosophy|Summerland]] and help perform this work make visual records (utilizing the most advanced [[supercomputers]] on the etheric plane of Earth) of everything that happens in everyone’s lives on Earth.  The raw [[data]] is first downloaded daily by ''The Watcher'' from the [[Akashic records]] and fed by him to the ''Custodian of the Hall of Records'' and thence forwarded to the ''recording angels'' and their volunteer helpers.  These [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] records are sorted daily first into one of seven general files by the ''soul ray'' (see [[seven rays]]) of the soul that is reincarnating, and then downloaded from that general file into a special individual file for each soul that can be consulted by the ''Karmic Board'' if that soul makes an appeal before it.

==Omri-Tas, Ruler of the Violet Planet==

'''Omri-Tas''', the ''Ruler of the Violet Planet'', is a [[Milky Way Galaxy|Galactic]] level Ascended Master ('''[[Spiritual Hierarchy]], Cosmic Beings''') who with his celestial mate, Irmo-Sat, [http://www.sintoniasaintgermain.com.br/elohim_of_aquariuslrg_.jpg],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sintoniasaintgermain.com.br/cosmicos_setimo.htm Source of Image of Omri-Tas, Ruler of the Violet Planet and his Twin Flame – "Sintonia / Saint Germain". Portuguese language Ascended Master Teachings website:]&lt;/ref&gt; is Sanat Kumara's [[Ascended Master Teachings#Violet Flame|violet flame]] supplier.  The violet flame is composed of a special type of [[Occult Chemistry (book)|etheric matter particles]], which may plausibly be called ''violetrons'',  that are capable of cleansing bad [[karma]].   ''Omri-Tas'' rules a planet on the [[etheric plane]] called the Violet Planet, which is apparently several dozen to several hundred [[light year]]s from Earth.  The Violet Planet is one of many throughout the Cosmos that serve as reservoirs for the violet flame.  Omri-Tas is the ruler of the Violet Planet that is closest to Earth and which is responsible for transmitting the violet flame from the [[Spiritual Hierarchy|'''Great Central Sun''']] of the Cosmos via the '''Galactic Logos''' to planets in [[Spiritual Hierarchy|Ursa Major (Our sector is reputedly 'Sector Nine' of the 48 Sectors in this spiral Galaxy)]].  Omri-Tas or one of his representatives periodically teleports from the Violet Planet to Shamballa with canisters of violet flame to replenish the violet flame in the large circular pool in the ''Temple of the Violet Flame'' in Shamballa (In return for the violet flame. Lord Sanat Kumara assigns to his care and tutelage worthy initiated Adepts/Chelas for etheric transport to their next assignments.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press, pages 249–253 Omri-Tas, Ruler of the Violet Planet&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benjamin Creme's views==
[[Benjamin Creme]] subscribes to the modern esoteric view that [[Nordic aliens]] (like those mentioned by [[George Adamski]] – Creme accepts Adamski's sightings as valid.) pilot [[flying saucer]]s from the Way-Station on Venus that is thought to exist on the [[etheric plane]] (Esotericists believe that since the Venusians' civilization is on the ''etheric plane'', the planet's [[heat]] doesn't affect them) and are capable of stepping down the level of vibration of themselves and their craft to the slower level of vibration of the atoms of the [[physical plane]].&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''The Reappearance of the Christ and the Masters of the Wisdom'' London:1980 Tara Press Page 205&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Creme's followers assume that Sanat Kumara and the 'Lords of the Flame' [See Elizabeth Van Buren's Book of the same name.](Nordic aliens themselves) visit from Venus in a flying saucer. How, they ask, did Sanat Kumara get to Earth from Venus if it wasn't on a flying saucer?  Creme's disciples believe that there is regular flying saucer traffic between Venus and Shamballa as well as other locations on Earth, especially areas where [[crop circles]] appear.  Creme's acolytes believe that Shamballa is equipped with an [[Spaceport|astrodrome]] as well as with numerous flying saucer landing pads attached to the tops or the sides of the buildings to accommodate the heavy flying saucer traffic from Venus.  Since Shamballa is envisioned as a [[floating city (science fiction)|floating city]] about five miles above the surface of the earth on the etheric plane, there are also numerous entrances in the basements of the buildings, where flying saucers can enter from the bottom of the city and park in spacious flying saucer parking garages provided in the basement levels of the buildings. In addition, says Creme, the Venusians have cigar-shaped [[mother ship]]s up to four miles long to accommodate the transport of multiple individual flying saucers to and from Venus.&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''The Great Approach'' Amsterdam:2001 Share International Foundation Page 133&lt;/ref&gt; According to Creme, sometimes flying saucers from places more distant than Venus, such as from [[Mars]], the [[Moons of Jupiter]], [[Uranus]], [[Sirius]], the [[Pleiades]], and beyond, fly in to pay a visit at Shamballa.  Since, according to Creme, the Venusians flying saucer designers outsource the actual construction of their flying saucers to the [[Martians]] (who are said to dwell on the etheric plane of Mars),&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''Maitreya's Mission – Volume III'' Amsterdam:1997 Share International Foundation Page 337&lt;/ref&gt; whom he describes as the "master engineers of the [[solar system]]",&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''Maitreya's Mission – Volume III'' Amsterdam:1997 Share International Foundation Page 194&lt;/ref&gt; Shamballa provides a convenient neutral ground where the Venusians and the Martians can meet to evaluate new flying saucer designs and negotiate flying saucer construction contracts between themselves.

==Ashtar Galactic Command Flying Saucer Fleet==
The Master [[Ashtar (extraterrestrial being)|Ashtar]] was first incorporated into the Ascended Master Teachings by [[Joshua David Stone]] in the early 1990s, based on his incorporation of the early 1980s revelations of the medium [[Ashtar (extraterrestrial being)#Tuella|Tuella]] into his own teachings. Stone had already begun teaching in 1993, based on the early 1980s revelations of Tuella, that the [[Master Jesus]], under his [[Milky Way Galaxy|galactic]] name '''Sananda''' (the name, Stone stated, he adopted after his resurrection), works with '''[[Ashtar (extraterrestrial being)|Commander Ashtar]]''', flying with '''[[Pallas Athena]]''' in their own flying saucer within the [[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings said to be patrolling near Earth|Ashtar Galactic Command flying saucer fleet]] as its ''Commander-in-Chief''.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Joshua David ''Cosmic Ascension: Your Cosmic Map Home'' (March 1998) (Book 6 of the multi-volume series, The Easy-To-Read Encyclopedia of the Spiritual Path) {{ISBN|0-929385-99-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stone, another name used by ''Commander Ashtar'' to denote his flying saucer fleet is ''The Airborne Division of the Great White Brotherhood''. Although the Ashtar Command is ultimately under the titular authority of Sanat Kumara, the Master Jesus in consultation with Pallas Athena and Ashtar, make all the day to day command decisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iamuniversity.org/iamu/mobile/literature/lodges/spiritual_extraterrestrials_lodge/3661-The-Ashtar-Command.html The Ashtar Command by Joshua David Stone:] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227160744/http://www.iamuniversity.org/iamu/mobile/literature/lodges/spiritual_extraterrestrials_lodge/3661-The-Ashtar-Command.html |date=27 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stone continued to present these teachings after 1996 at the yearly Wesak Mount Shasta gatherings.

According to some, The Ashtar Command is simply a modern concept of the Sumerian/Babylonian goddess and deity [[Astarte]]/[[Ishtar]]/[[Isis]] and her entourage whose assigned function is to protect an evolving mankind from the [[Satan|Satanic forces]], then extant, on this planet, that sought to usurp the Earthly Regency of the local Ascended Masters in their role of protecting and engendering Divine Law upon the Earth until the arrival, at 'The Meridian of Time' of 'The [[Son of God]]'... Jesus/Sananda and his incarnation of 'The Christ Being'.&lt;ref&gt;''The Book of Al Daoud.'' [By 'The Pen'. 1930].&lt;/ref&gt;

Lourene Altiery, also known as ''Karita'' to her followers, is an Ascended Master Teachings teacher originally from [[Joliet, Illinois]] who now resides in [[Sun Lakes, Arizona]] – she set up her website in 2001.  According to Altiery, there are four Masters originally from the [[Spiritual Hierarchy]] Cosmic beings said to be patrolling near [[Earth|Ashtar Galactic Command Flying Saucer Fleet]] who are now permanently stationed on Shamballa.  These are the Masters '''Ballerian''', who is the proprietor of a flying saucer repair facility in Shamballa called ''God's Garage''; '''Kumad''', an expert [[linguist]] who helps the Keeper of the Scrolls decipher and interpret ancient manuscripts; '''Ashlem''',  a [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] Master who resides at the Hall of Records and helps people decipher their past lives by assisting them in accessing the [[Akashic records]]; and '''Sutko''', the "space detective", who helps the Master K-17 solve unusually difficult cases.  Elements of the ''[[Ashtar (extraterrestrial being)|Ashtar]] Galactic Command Flying Saucer Fleet'' sometimes dock at Shamballa so the flying saucer crews can go on '[[shore leave]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Altiery, Lourene (Karita) ''The World's Greatest Teachings by Christ the Master and Other Avatars, Telepathically Communicated to Karita 2002'' {{ISBN|0-9718008-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.serversofall.com/ Servers of All web page (Lourene Altiery)—Images of the cosmic beings described above in the mid-level command hierarchy of the Ashtar Galactic Command flying saucer fleet are depicted on this web page:]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hatonn and the Photon Belt==

According to the Ascended Master Teachings of Anne Bellringer of [[Rapid City, South Dakota]], who began teaching in 1990, '''Hatonn''', an [[android (robot)|android]] [[Pleiadean]] Master who flies aboard the flying saucer ''Phoenix'' (one of the flying saucers of the ''Ashtar Galactic Command Flying Saucer Fleet'', piloted by Hatonn’s partner the Master '''Soltec'''), monitors events on Earth for the ''Galactic Hall of Records'' at the [[galactic Center|galactic core]].

He feeds information about events on Earth via [[Subspace radio|subspace relay]] to the [[supercomputer]]s at the "Galactic Hall of Records".  However, Bellringer says that this activity is secondary to Hatonn's primary task, which is functioning as the [[liaison officer]] between Sanat Kumara and the [[Pleiadeans]] in order for him to be able to help Earth safely navigate in [[2012 phenomenon|2012]] through the approaching so-called "[[photon belt]]", said to emanate from the [[Pleiades]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hatonnspeaksthetruth.wordpress.com/2010/01/25/hatonn-introduction-to-the-photon-belt/ Hatonn and the Photon Belt:]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fourwinds10.com/siterun_static/general/about_fourwinds.php Four Winds10.com—website of Anne Bellringer:]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian criticism==

According to many Christians, notably the anti-[[New Age]] author [[Constance Cumbey]], New Age Leaders, including Masters of the [[Illuminati]], are actually worshipping the Lord of this World, whose name is Sanat Kumara (Alice Bailey, ''Externalisation of the Hierarchy'', p.&amp;nbsp;676, 709, 725; and Elizabeth Van Buren, ''The Secret of the Illuminati'', p.&amp;nbsp;1). Bailey goes on to explain that Sanat Kumara is the "life and the forming intelligence", presiding over the Council of Shamballa [the Heaven of Earth according to New Age doctrine]. (''The New Age Dictionary'', p.&amp;nbsp;172) Further, Sanat Kumara is "the eternal youth from the Planet [[Venus]]". The name Lucifer is one of the ancient Greek names for Venus. Therefore, according to Cumbey, Sanat Kumara is merely another name for [[Satan]] or [[Lucifer]]. (Cumbey, ''Hidden Dangers of the Rainbow'') [7].

==Theosophical reply to Christian criticism==
Other [[New Age]] leaders have tried to separate themselves from the Illuminati movement, and view that burdening the two groups as entirely coexistent is inaccurate and ineffectual. New Age theosophy also counters these critics, teaching the fact that the being known as Sanat Kumara would rather see spiritual harmony and peace, a fact which many Illuminati members ignore and abuse.

In the glossary of in the back of the book ''Alchemy'', which [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]] claims was dictated to her by [[Kuthumi]], Satan and Sanat Kumara are clearly distinguished as two different and opposed beings—Satan working for evil and Sanat Kumara for good.&lt;ref&gt;"Kuthumi" (dictated to [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]]) ''Alchemy'' 1982 Summit Lighthouse See glossary at end of book&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skeptical view==
The scholar [[K. Paul Johnson]] maintains that the "Masters" that [[Madame Blavatsky]] wrote about and produced letters from were actually idealizations of people who were her [[mentor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Paul K. Initiates of Theosophical Masters Albany, New York:1995 State University of New York Press&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''Sanat Kumara'', although mentioned in passing by Madame Blavatsky, was never mentioned by her as an important "Master" that Blavatsky claimed to have met.  He was first presented, under the name ''Lord of the World'', as the head of the "Masters" by [[C.W. Leadbeater]] in his 1925 book ''The Masters and the Path''.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1925 (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sanat Kumara in popular culture==

'''[[Panelology]]'''
*Sanat Kumara’s helper ''The Watcher'' was apparently made into a [[Marvel Comics]] character called [[Uatu]] by [[Stan Lee]] in 1963. The [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher comic books]] have tales about a special race of beings talented at [[information processing]] called ''The Watchers'' spread throughout the [[Cosmos]], and it is believed in Theosophy and the Ascended Master Teachings that The Watcher belongs to.{{citationeeded|date=January 2016}}
'''Video games'''
*Sanat Kumara is the name of Helena Blavatsky's Noble Phantasm in ''[[Fate/Grand Order]]''. It takes the form of a flying saucer.

The '''sexual revolution''', also known as a time of '''sexual liberation''', was a [[social movement]] that challenged traditional codes of behavior related to sexuality and [[interpersonal relationship]]s throughout the [[United States]] and subsequently, the wider world, from the 1960s to the 1980s.&lt;ref name=allyn&gt;Allyn, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual liberation included increased acceptance of [[Sexual intercourse|sex]] outside of traditional [[heterosexual]], monogamous relationships (primarily [[marriage]]).&lt;ref&gt;Escoffier, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The normalization of [[Birth control|contraception]] and [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|the pill]], [[public nudity]], [[pornography]], [[premarital sex]], [[homosexuality]], and alternative forms of sexuality, and the legalization of [[abortion]] all followed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Germaine Greer]] and [[The Female Eunuch]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenwood.com/catalog/GR9913.aspx |title=Abc-Clio |publisher=Greenwood.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709181001/http://www.greenwood.com/catalog/GR9913.aspx |archivedate=2011-07-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formative factors==
[[File:Pouring-water-for-wet-tshirt.jpg|thumb|Youngsters participating in [[Wet T-shirt contest]] during [[Spring break]], USA]]

The term "sexual revolution" has been used since at least the late 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;The term appeared as early as 1929; the book ''Is Sex Necessary?'' by Thurber &amp; White, has a chapter titled ''The Sexual Revolution: Being a Rather Complete Survey of the Entire Sexual Scene''.&lt;br/&gt;
According to [[w:ru:Душенко, Константин Васильевич|Konstantin Dushenko]], the term was in use in Russia in 1925. {{cite web|url=http://bailey83221.livejournal.com/87856.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504082655/http://bailey83221.livejournal.com/87856.html |archivedate=2008-05-04 |df= }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Some early commentators{{examples|date=September 2018}} believed the period of 1960–1980 was in fact the second such revolution in America, with the first during the [[Roaring Twenties]] after [[World War I]]. Indicators of non-traditional sexual behavior (e.g., gonorrhea incidence, births out of wedlock, and births to teenagers) began to rise dramatically in the mid to late 1950s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Francis|first=Andrew|date=2013|title=The Wages of Sin: How the Discovery of Penicillin Reshaped Modern Sexuality|url=|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume=42 | issue = 1 |pages=5–13|via=|doi=10.1007/s10508-012-0018-4|pmid=23054260}}&lt;/ref&gt; It{{what|date=September 2018}} brought about profound shifts in attitudes{{whose|date=November 2018}} toward women's sexuality, homosexuality, pre-marital sexuality, and the freedom of sexual expression.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Psychologists and scientists such as [[Wilhelm Reich]] and [[Alfred Kinsey]] influenced the changes.{{cn|date=September 2018}} As well, changing mores were both stimulated by and reflected in literature and films, and by the social movements of the period, including the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]], the women's movement, and the gay rights movement.&lt;ref name=GLBTQ /&gt;  The counterculture contributed to the awareness of radical cultural change that was the social matrix of the sexual revolution.&lt;ref name=GLBTQ /&gt;{{better source|date=September 2018}}

The sexual revolution was initiated by those who shared a belief in the detrimental impact of sexual repression, a view that had previously been argued by [[Wilhelm Reich]], [[D. H. Lawrence]], [[Sigmund Freud]], and the [[surrealism|Surrealist movement]].{{cn|date=September 2018}} 

The counterculture wanted to explore the body and mind, and free the personal self from the moral and legal sexual confines of modern America, as well as from 1940s-50s morals in general.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Slack, "Liberalism Radicalized: The Sexual Revolution, Multiculturalism, and the Rise of Identity Politics," {{cite web |url=http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2013/08/liberalism-radicalized-the-sexual-revolution-multiculturalism-and-the-rise-of-identity-politics |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002014520/http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2013/08/liberalism-radicalized-the-sexual-revolution-multiculturalism-and-the-rise-of-identity-politics |archivedate=2013-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sexual revolution of the 1960s was grew from a conviction that the erotic should be celebrated as a normal part of life and not repressed by family, industrialized sexual morality, religion and the state.&lt;ref name="America Divided"&gt;{{cite book|last=Isserman|first=Maurice|title=America Divided|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-19-976506-5|pages=138–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of the [[The Pill|birth control pill]] in 1960 gave women access to easy and reliable [[contraception]]. Another likely cause was a vast improvement in [[obstetrics]], greatly reducing the number of women who died due to childbearing, thus increasing the [[life expectancy]] of women. A third, more indirect cause was the large number of children born in the 1940s and early 1950s all over the western world—the '[[Baby Boom Generation]]'--many of whom would grow up in relatively prosperous and safe conditions, within a middle class on the rise and with better access to education and entertainment than ever before. By their demographic weight and their social and educational background they came to trigger a shift in society towards more permissive and informalized attitudes.

The discovery of penicillin led to significant reductions in [[syphilis]] mortality, which, in turn, spurred an increase in non-traditional sex during the mid to late 1950s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-01/did-penicillin-kickstart-sexual-revolution |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005104342/http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-01/did-penicillin-kickstart-sexual-revolution |archivedate=2013-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Freudian school===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
[[Sigmund Freud]] of [[Vienna]] believed human behavior was motivated by unconscious [[drive theory|drives]], primarily by the [[libido]] or "Sexual Energy". Freud proposed to study how these unconscious drives were [[Psychological repression|repressed]] and found expression through other cultural outlets. He called this therapy "[[psychoanalysis]]".

While Freud's ideas were sometimes ignored or provoked resistance within Viennese society, his ideas soon entered the discussions and working methods of anthropologists, artists and writers all over Europe, and from the 1920s in the United States. His conception of a primary [[libido|sexual drive]] that would not be ultimately curbed by law, education or standards of decorum spelled a serious challenge to [[Victorian morality|Victorian prudishness]], and his theory of [[psychosexual development]] proposed a model for the development of sexual orientations and desires; children emerged from the [[Oedipus complex]], a sexual desire towards their parent of the opposite sex. The idea of children having their parents as their early sexual targets was particularly shocking to Victorian and early 20th century society.

According to Freud's theory, in the earliest stage of a child's psychosexual development, the [[oral stage]], the mother's breast became the formative source of all later [[erotic]] sensation. Much of his research remains widely contested by professionals in the field, though it has spurred critical developments in the humanities.

[[Anarchism|Anarchist]] Freud scholars [[Otto Gross]] and [[Wilhelm Reich]] (who famously coined the phrase "Sexual Revolution") developed a sociology of sex in the 1910s to 1930s in which the animal-like competitive reproductive behavior was seen as a legacy of ancestral human evolution reflecting in every social relation, as per the freudian interpretation, and hence the liberation of sexual behavior a mean to social revolution.

==The role of mass media==
===Mead's ''Coming of Age in Samoa''===

{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
The publication of anthropologist [[Margaret Mead]]'s ''Coming of Age in Samoa'' brought the sexual revolution to the public scene, as her thoughts concerning sexual freedom pervaded academia. Published in 1928, Mead's [[ethnography]] focused on the psychosexual development of Samoan adolescent children on the island of [[Samoa]]. She recorded that their adolescence was not in fact a time of "storm and stress" as Erikson's stages of development suggest, but that the sexual freedom experienced by the adolescents actually permitted them an easy transition from childhood to adulthood. Mead called for a change in suppression of sexuality in America, and her work directly resulted in the advancement of the sexual revolution in the 1930s.

Mead's findings were later criticized by anthropologist [[Derek Freeman]], who investigated her claims of promiscuity and conducted his own ethnography of Samoan society.

===Kinsey and Masters and Johnson===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
In the late 1940s and early 1950s, [[Alfred&amp;nbsp;C.&amp;nbsp;Kinsey]] published two surveys of modern sexual behaviour. In 1948 Alfred&amp;nbsp;C.&amp;nbsp;Kinsey and his co-workers, responding to a request by female students at [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]] for more information on human sexual behavior, published the book ''[[Kinsey Reports|Sexual behaviour in the Human Male]]''. They followed this five years later with ''[[Kinsey Reports|Sexual behaviour in the Human Female]]''. These books began a revolution in social awareness of, and public attention given to, human sexuality.

It is said that [[public morality]] severely restricted open discussion of sexuality as a human characteristic, and specific sexual practices, especially sexual behaviours that did not lead to procreation. Kinsey's books contained studies about controversial topics such as the frequency of homosexuality, and the sexuality of minors aged two weeks to fourteen years. Scientists working for Kinsey reported data which led to the conclusion that people are capable of sexual stimulation from birth. Furthermore, Kinsey's method of researching sexuality differs significantly from today's methods. Kinsey would watch his research subjects engage in sexual intercourse, sometimes engaging with his subjects as well. He would also encourage his research team to do the same, and encouraged them to engage in intercourse with him, too.

These books laid the groundwork for [[Masters and Johnson]]'s life work. A study called ''Human Sexual Response'' in 1966 revealed the nature and scope of the sexual practices of young Americans.

===The ''Playboy'' culture===
[[File:New York Playboy Club Bunnies aboard USS Wainwright (DLG-28) c1971.jpg|thumb|[[Playboy Bunnies]] aboard US Navy ship ([[USS Wainwright (CG-28)|USS ''Wainwright'']] (CG-28)), 1971]]

In 1953, Chicago resident [[Hugh Hefner]] founded [[Playboy]], a magazine which aimed to target males between the ages of 21 and 45.&lt;ref name=hefsex /&gt; The coverpage and nude centerfold in the first edition featured [[Marilyn Monroe]], then a rising [[sex symbol]].&lt;ref name=marilyn&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=rvwH7euUccIC&amp;lpg=PA75&amp;dq=marilyn%20playboy&amp;pg=PA75#v=onepage&amp;q=playboy&amp;f=false|page = 75|author = Les Harding|title = They Knew Marilyn Monroe: Famous Persons in the Life of the Hollywood Icon|isbn = 9780786490141|date = 2012-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pictures were taken when Monroe was an unknown struggling actress and she received $50 for the photo shoot.

===Erotic novels===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
In the United States in the years 1959 through 1966, bans on three books with explicit erotic content were challenged and overturned. This also occurred in the United Kingdom starting with the 1959&amp;nbsp;Obscene Publications Act and reaching a peak with the LCL&amp;nbsp;court case.

Prior to this time, a patchwork of regulations (as well as local customs and vigilante actions) governed what could and could not be published. For example, the [[United States Customs Service]] banned [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' by refusing to allow it to be imported into the United States. The [[Roman Catholic Church]]'s ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'' carried great weight among Catholics and amounted to an effective and instant boycott of any book appearing on it. Boston's [[Watch and Ward Society]], a largely Protestant creation inspired by [[Anthony Comstock]], made "[[banned in Boston]]" a national by-word.

In 1959 [[Grove Press]] published an unexpurgated version of ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' by [[D.&amp;nbsp;H.&amp;nbsp;Lawrence]]. The [[United States Postal Service|U.S.&amp;nbsp;Post Office]] confiscated copies sent through the mail. Lawyer [[Charles Rembar]] sued the New York City Postmaster, and won in New York and then on federal appeal.

[[Henry Miller]]'s 1934 novel, ''[[Tropic of Cancer (novel)|Tropic of Cancer]]'', had explicit sexual passages and could not be published in the United States; an edition was printed by the [[Obelisk Press]] in Paris and copies were smuggled into the United States. ({{As of|2003}}, used book dealers asked $7,500 and more for copies of this edition.) In 1961 Grove Press issued a copy of the work, and dozens of booksellers were sued for selling it. The issue was ultimately settled by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S.&amp;nbsp;Supreme Court's]] 1964 decision in ''Grove Press, Inc. v. Gerstein''.

In 1963 Putnam published [[John Cleland]]'s 1750&amp;nbsp;novel ''[[Fanny Hill]]''. This was the turning point, because [[Charles Rembar]] appealed a restraining order against it all the way to the U.S.&amp;nbsp;Supreme Court and won. In ''[[Memoirs v. Massachusetts]]'', 383&amp;nbsp;U.S.&amp;nbsp;413, the court ruled that sex was "a great and mysterious motive force in human life", and that its expression in literature was protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].

===Nonfiction===
Only books primarily appealing to "prurient interest" could be banned. In a famous phrase, the court said that obscenity is "utterly without redeeming social importance"—meaning that, conversely, any work with redeeming social importance was not obscene, even if it contained isolated passages that could "deprave and corrupt" some readers. This decision was especially significant, because, of the three books mentioned, ''Fanny Hill'' has by far the largest measure of content that seems to appeal to prurient interest, and the smallest measures of [[literary merit]] and "redeeming social importance". Whereas an expurgated version of ''Lady Chatterley's Lover'' had actually once been published, no expurgated version of ''Fanny Hill'' had ever been. By permitting the publication of ''Fanny Hill'', the U.S.&amp;nbsp;Supreme Court set the bar for any ban so high that Rembar himself called the 1966&amp;nbsp;decision "the end of obscenity".

The court decisions that legalised the publication of ''[[Fanny Hill]]'' had an even more important effect: freed from fears of legal action, nonfiction works about sex and sexuality started to appear more often.

In 1962, [[Helen Gurley Brown]] published ''[[Sex and the Single Girl]]: The Unmarried Woman's Guide to Men, Careers, the Apartment, Diet, Fashion, Money and Men.'' The title itself would have been unthinkable a decade earlier. (In 1965 she went on to transform ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' magazine into a life manual for young career women.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}})

In 1969 [[Terry Garrity|Joan Garrity]], identifying herself only as "J.", published ''[[The Sensuous Woman|The Way to Become the Sensuous Woman]]'', with information on exercises to improve the dexterity of one's tongue and how to have anal sex.

The same year saw the appearance of Dr.&amp;nbsp;[[David Reuben (sex author)|David Reuben's]] book ''[[Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask) (book)|Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)]]''. Despite the dignity of Reuben's medical credentials, this book was light-hearted in tone.

In 1970 the Boston Women's Health Collective published ''Women and Their Bodies'' (which became far better known a year later under its subsequent title ''[[Our Bodies, Ourselves]]''). Not an erotic treatise or sex manual, the book nevertheless included frank descriptions of sexuality, and contained illustrations that could have caused legal problems just a few years earlier.

[[Alex Comfort]]'s ''[[The Joy of Sex]]: A Gourmet Guide to Love Making'' appeared in 1972. In later editions though, Comfort's libertinism was tamed as a response to [[AIDS]].

In 1975 [[Will McBride (photographer)|Will McBride's]] ''Zeig Mal!'' ([[Show Me!]]), written with psychologist Helga Fleichhauer-Hardt for children and their parents, appeared in bookstores on both sides of the Atlantic. Appreciated by many parents for its frank depiction of pre-adolescents discovering and exploring their sexuality, it scandalised others and eventually it was pulled from circulation in the United States and some other countries. It was followed in 1989 by ''Zeig Mal Mehr!'' ("Show Me More!").

These books had a number of things in common. They were factual and, in fact, educational. They were available to a mainstream readership. They were stacked high on the tables of discount bookstores, they were book club selections, and their authors were guests on late-night talk shows. People were seen reading them in public.

Earlier books such as ''What Every Girl Should Know'' ([[Margaret Sanger]], 1920) and ''A Marriage Manual'' (Hannah and Abraham Stone, 1939) had broken the silence in which many people, women in particular, had grown up in.

By the 1950s, in the United States, it had become rare for women to go into their wedding nights not knowing what to expect. But the open discussion of sex as pleasure, and descriptions of sexual practices and techniques, was revolutionary. There were practices which, perhaps, some had heard of. But many adults did not know for sure whether they were realities, or fantasies found only in pornographic books.

The Kinsey report revealed that these practices were, at the very least, surprisingly frequent. These other books asserted, in the words of a 1980&amp;nbsp;book by Dr.&amp;nbsp;Irene Kassorla, that ''Nice Girls Do — And Now You Can Too''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

===Television===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
Television, the new mass communication device of the age, along with other media outlets such as radio and magazines, could broadcast information in a matter of seconds to millions of people, while only a few wealthy people would control what millions could watch. Some modern historians have theorized that these media outlets helped to spread new ideas, which were considered radical. The struggles, skirmishes and rhetorical confrontations happening in the course of these movements also became directly visible to ordinary people in a way they would never have been before; the sense of involvement in a social and sexual shift happening in the present could rapidly win new converts and spread discussions afield. The counterculture of the 1960s was becoming well known through radio, newspapers, TV, books, music and other media by the end of the 1960s.

===Pornographic film===
In 1969, ''[[Blue Movie]]'', directed by [[Andy Warhol]], was the first [[pornographic|adult erotic film]] depicting explicit [[sex]] to receive wide theatrical release in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="NYT-19690722"&gt;{{cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Canby |title=Movie Review - Blue Movie (1968) Screen: Andy Warhol's 'Blue Movie' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9507E5D91738E63ABC4A51DFB1668382679EDE |date=July 22, 1969 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=December 29, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231190855/http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9507E5D91738E63ABC4A51DFB1668382679EDE |archivedate=December 31, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WS-2002-2005"&gt;{{cite web |last=Comenas |first=Gary |title=Blue Movie (1968) |url=http://www.warholstars.org/andy-warhol-blue-movie.html |date=2005 |work=WarholStars.org |accessdate=December 29, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151230082332/http://www.warholstars.org/andy-warhol-blue-movie.html |archivedate=December 30, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-19690810"&gt;{{cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Canby |title=Warhol's Red Hot and 'Blue' Movie.

By the mid-1970s and through the 1980s, newly won sexual freedoms were being exploited by big businesses looking to capitalize on an increasingly permissive society, with the advent of public and hardcore [[pornography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bannon |first=Ann |url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/1560255250/ref=sib_dp_pt/104-9728303-1778302#reader-link/ |title=Sexual Revolution (9781560255253): Jeffrey Escoffier, Fred W.

==Modern revolutions==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2018}}
The [[Industrial Revolution]] during the nineteenth century and the growth of [[science]] and [[technology]], [[medicine]] and [[health care]], resulted in better [[contraceptives]] being manufactured. Advances in the manufacture and production of [[rubber]] made possible the design and production of [[condom]]s that could be used by hundreds of millions of men and women to prevent [[pregnancy]] at little cost. Advances in [[chemistry]], [[pharmacology]], and [[biology]], and human [[physiology]] led to the discovery and perfection of the [[combined oral contraceptive pill|first oral contraceptives]], popularly known as "the Pill." 

All these developments took place alongside and combined with an increase in world [[literacy]] and decline in religious observance. Old values such as the biblical notion of "be fruitful and multiply" were cast aside as people continued to feel alienated from the past and adopted the lifestyles of progressive modernizing cultures.

Another contribution that helped bring about this modern revolution of sexual freedom were the writings of [[Herbert Marcuse]] and [[Wilhelm Reich]], who took the philosophy of [[Karl Marx]] and similar philosophers.

When speaking of sexual revolution, historians&lt;ref&gt;The First Sexual Revolution: The Emergence of Male Heterosexuality in Moderm America. By Kevin White (New York: New York University Press: 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; make a distinction between the first and the second sexual revolution. In the first sexual revolution (1870–1910), to caucasians, Victorian morality lost its universal appeal. However, it did not lead to the rise of a "permissive society". Exemplary for this period is the rise and differentiation in forms of regulating sexuality.

"[[No-fault divorce|No-fault]]" unilateral [[divorce]] became legal and easier to obtain in many countries during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.

The women's movement redefined sexuality, not in terms of simply pleasing men but recognizing women's sexual satisfaction and sexual desire. "[[The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm]]" by [[Anne Koedt]] illustrates an understanding of a women's sexual anatomy, arguing  against Freud's "assumptions of women as inferior appendage to man, and her consequent social and psychological role."&lt;ref name="Vaginal Orgasm"&gt;{{cite web|last=Koedt |first=Anne |title=The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm |url=http://www.uic.edu/orgs/cwluherstory/CWLUArchive/vaginalmyth.html |accessdate=16 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106211856/http://www.uic.edu/orgs/cwluherstory/CWLUArchive/vaginalmyth.html |archivedate=6 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The women's movement was able to develop lesbian feminism, freedom from heterosexual act, and freedom from reproduction. Feminist [[Betty Friedan]] published the [[Feminine Mystique]] in 1963, concerning the many frustrations women had with their lives and with separate spheres which established a pattern of inequality.

[[File:CDFrontInsert.FreedomToLove.Pride.WDC.31May2009.jpg|thumb|1997 [[LGBT]] poster, New York City]]
The [[Gay Rights Movement]] started when the [[Stonewall Riots]] of 1969 crystallized a broad grass-roots mobilization. New gay liberationist gave political meaning to "coming out" by extending the psychological-personal process into public life. During the 1950s the most feared thing of the homosexual culture was "coming out", the homosexual culture of the 1950s did everything they could to help keep their sexuality a secret from the public and everyone else in their lives, but Alfred Kinsey's research on homosexuality alleged that 39% of the unmarried male population had had at least one homosexual experience to orgasm between adolescence and old age.&lt;ref name=GLBTQ /&gt; The "coming out" phenomenon helped mobilize people to live full-time as a homosexual, they no longer had to live in secret. They no longer had to sneak around and occasionally receive the sexual attention that they desire or force themselves into a heterosexual relationship in which they had no interest, and was full of lies. [[Brad Gooch]] wrote in the "Golden Age of Promiscuity" that the gay male community finally had reached a rich culture of "easy sex", sex without commitment, obligation or long-term relationships.&lt;ref name=GLBTQ /&gt;{{better source|date=September 2018}}

==Feminism and sexual liberation==
{{npov-section|date=September 2018}}
Coinciding with [[second-wave feminism]] and the [[women's liberation movement]] initiated in the early 1960s, the sexual liberation movement was aided by feminist ideologues in their mutual struggle to challenge traditional ideas regarding [[Human female sexuality|female sexuality]] and [[queer]] sexuality. Elimination of undue favorable bias towards men and objectification of women as well as support for women's right to choose her sexual partners free of outside interference or judgement were three of the main goals associated with sexual liberation from the feminist perspective. Since during the early stages of feminism, women's liberation was often equated with sexual liberation rather than associated with it. Many feminist thinkers believed that assertion of the primacy of sexuality would be a major step towards the ultimate goal of women's liberation, thus women were urged to initiate sexual advances, enjoy sex and experiment with new forms of sexuality.&lt;ref name="Ending Female Sexual Oppression"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hooks|first=Bell|title=Feminist Theory, From Margin To Centre|year=1984|publisher=South End Press classics|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0-89608-613-5|pages=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The feminist movements insisted and focused on the sexual liberation for women, both physical and psychological. The pursuit of sexual pleasure for women was the core ideology, which subsequently was to set the foundation for female independence. Although whether or not sexual freedom should be a feminist issue is currently a much-debated topic,&lt;ref name="Ending Female Sexual Oppression" /&gt; the feminist movement overtly defines itself as the movement for social, political, and economic equality of men and women.&lt;ref name="What is Feminism"&gt;{{cite web|last=Baumgardner and Richards|title=What Is Feminism|url=http://www.feminist.com/resources/artspeech/genwom/whatisfem.htm|accessdate=27 March 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406000204/http://www.feminist.com/resources/artspeech/genwom/whatisfem.htm|archivedate=6 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist movements are also involved the fight against sexism and since sexism is a highly complex notion,&lt;ref name="Sexism"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cudd|first=Ann|title=Feminist Theory A Philosophical Anthology|year=2005|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd|location=Malden, MA|isbn=978-1-4051-1660-2|pages=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is difficult to separate the feminist critique toward sexism from its fight against sexual oppression.

The feminist movement has helped create a social climate in which LGBT people and women are increasingly able to be open and free with their sexuality,&lt;ref name="Ending Female Sexual Oppression 2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hooks|first=Bell|title=Feminist Theory, From Margin To Centre|year=1984|publisher=South End Press classics|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0-89608-613-5|pages=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; which enabled a spiritual liberation of sorts with regards to sex. Rather than being forced to hide their sexual desires or feelings, women and LGBT people have gained and continue to gain increased freedom in this area.  Consequently, the feminist movement to end sexual oppression has and continues to directly contribute to the sexual liberation movement.

Nevertheless, among many feminists, the view soon became widely held that, thus far, the sexual freedoms gained in the sexual revolution of the 1960s, such as the decreasing emphasis on [[monogamy]], had been largely gained by men at women's expense.&lt;ref name="Willis 1984 121"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Willis|first=Ellen|author-link=Ellen Willis|title=Radical Feminism and Feminist Radicalism |journal=Social Text |volume=9/10: The 1960s without Apology |year=1984|page=121|jstor=466537|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[Anticlimax (book)|[Anticlimax: A Feminist Perspective on the Sexual Revolution]]'', [[Sheila Jeffreys]] asserted that the sexual revolution on men's terms contributed less to women's freedom than to their continued oppression, an assertion that has both commanded respect and attracted intense criticism.&lt;ref name="Zoftig 1982 88"&gt;{{citation | last = Zoftig | first = Sarah | contribution = Coming out | editor-last = SAMOIS | editor-link = Samois | title = Coming to power: writings and graphics on lesbian S/M: S/M, a form of eroticism based on a consenual exchange of power | page = 88 | publisher = Alyson Publications | location = Boston, Massachusetts | year = 1982 | isbn = 9780932870285 | edition = 2nd | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vance 1992 302"&gt;{{cite book | last = Vance | first = Carole S. | title = Pleasure and danger: exploring female sexuality | page = 302 | publisher = Pandora Press  | location = London New York | year = 1992 | isbn = 9780044408673 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilbert"&gt;{{citation | last = Egerton | first = Jane | contribution = Sheila Jeffreys | editor-last = Gilbert | editor-first = Harriett | editor-link = Harriett Gilbert | title = The sexual imagination from Acker to Zola: a feminist companion | page = 133 | publisher = Jonathan Cape | location = London | year = 1993 | isbn = 9780224035354 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Denfeld 1995 35"&gt;{{citation | last = Denfeld | first = Rene | author-link = Rene Denfeld | contribution = The antiphallic campaign: male bashing and sexual politics | editor-last = Denfeld | editor-first = Rene | editor-link = Rene Denfeld | title = The new Victorians: a young woman's challenge to the old feminist order | pages = 35 | publisher = Allen &amp; Unwin | location = St Leonards, New South Wales | year = 1995 | isbn = 9781863737890 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1970s and early 1980s, [[feminist sex wars]] broke out due to disagreements [[Feminist views on pornography|on pornography]], [[Feminist views on prostitution|on prostitution]], and [[Feminist views on BDSM|on BDSM]], as well as [[Feminist views on sexuality|sexuality in general]].


==Contraception==
As [[birth control]] became widely accessible, men and women began to have more choice in the matter of having children than ever before. The 1916 invention of thin, disposable [[latex]] [[condom]]s for men led to widespread affordable condoms by the 1930s; the demise of the [[Comstock laws]] in 1936 set the stage for promotion of available effective contraceptives such as the [[Diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragm]] and [[cervical cap]]; the 1960s introduction of the [[IUD]] and [[combined oral contraceptive pill|oral contraceptives]] for women gave a sense of freedom from [[barrier contraception]]. The opposition of Churches (e.g.&amp;nbsp;''[[Humanae vitae]]'') led to parallel movements of [[secularization]] and exile from religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2008/0725/1216917534395.html |title=Fri, Jul 25, 2008 - 'Humanae Vitae' birth control ban set off a wave of dissent |publisher=The Irish Times |date=2008-07-07 |accessdate=2011-11-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122234704/http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2008/0725/1216917534395.html |archivedate=2011-11-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women gained much greater access to birth control in the "girls world" decision in 1965, in the 1960s and 1970s the birth control movement advocated for the legalization of abortion and large scale education campaigns about contraception by governments.

==United Kingdom==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
Influenced by and exposed to the revolution in America, the UK had a similar, though smaller experience.

In the [[United Kingdom]], the new generation growing up after [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]] had grown tired of the rationing and austerity of the 1940s and 1950s and the Victorian values of their elders, so the 1960s were a time of rebellion against the fashions and social [[mores]] of the previous generation.

An early inkling of changing attitudes came in 1960, when the government of the day tried unsuccessfully to prosecute [[Penguin Books]] for obscenity, for publishing the [[D. H. Lawrence]] novel ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'', which had been banned since the 1920s for what was considered racy content. The prosecution counsel [[Mervyn Griffith-Jones]] famously stood in front of the jury and asked, in his closing statement: "Is it a book you would wish your wife or servants to read?" When the case collapsed, the novel went on to become a bestseller, selling two&amp;nbsp;million copies.

The Pill became available free of charge on the [[National Health Service]] in the 1960s, at first restricted to married women, but in 1968 its availability was extended to all women.

In 1967, laws prohibiting abortion and male homosexuality were repealed, although the age of consent for homosexual men was set at 21, in contrast to the heterosexual age of consent of 16. This is how it stayed until 1994, when the male homosexual age of consent was lowered to 18, and then equalised at 16 in 2001. Also in 2001, lesbian sex was recognised in British law for the first time ever, with an age of consent of 16.

==Free love==
{{Main|Free love}}
Beginning in [[San Francisco]] in the mid-1960s, a new culture of "[[free love]]" emerged, with thousands of young people becoming "[[hippies]]", inspired by [[India]]n culture, who preached the power of love and the beauty of sex as part of ordinary life. This is part of a [[counterculture]] that continues to exist. By the 1970s, it was socially acceptable for colleges to permit co-ed housing.

Free love continued in different forms throughout the 1970s and into the early 1980s, but its more assertive manifestations ended abruptly (or at least disappeared from public view) in the mid-1980s when the public first became aware of [[AIDS]], a deadly sexually-transmitted disease.

==Explicit sex on screen and stage==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2018}}
Swedish filmmakers like [[Ingmar Bergman]] and [[Vilgot Sjöman]] contributed to sexual liberation with sexually themed films that challenged conservative international standards. The 1951 film ''[[Hon dansade en sommar]]'' (''She Danced One Summer AKA One Summer of Happiness'') (directed by [[Arne Mattsson]]) starring [[Ulla Jacobsson]] and [[Folke Sundquist]] was notable in this regard for depicting explicit nudity, including nude bathing in a lake.

This film, as well as Bergman's ''[[Sommaren med Monika]]'' (''The Summer with Monika'', 1951) and ''[[The Silence (1963 film)|Tystnaden]] (The Silence'', 1963), caused an international uproar, not least in the United States, where the films were charged with violating standards of decency. Vilgot Sjöman's film ''[[I Am Curious (Yellow)]]'', also created waves of international outcry, but it was very popular in the United States. Another of his films, ''[[491 (film)|491]]'', highlighted homosexuality among other things. ''[[Language of Love|Kärlekens språk]]'' (''The Language of Love'') was an informative documentary about sex and sexual techniques that featured the first real act of sex in a mainstream film, and inevitably it caused intense debate around the world.

From these films the concept (or catchphrase) of "Swedish sin" (licentiousness and seductive nudity) developed, even though Swedish society in the 1950s was still fairly conservative regarding sex, and the international concept of Swedish sexuality was and is largely exaggerated. The image of "hot love and cold people" emerged. Sexual liberalism was seen as part of the modernization process that, by breaking down traditional borders, would lead to the emancipation of natural forces and desires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=Carl |last1=Marklund |title=Hot Love and Cold People. Sexual Liberalism as Political Escapism in Radical Sweden |year=2009 |journal=NORDEUROPAforum |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=83–101 |url=http://edoc.hu-berlin.de/nordeuropaforum/2009-1/marklund-carl-83/XML/ |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121217062419/http://edoc.hu-berlin.de/nordeuropaforum/2009-1/marklund-carl-83/XML/ |archivedate=2012-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These films caused debate there as well. The films eventually progressed the public's attitude toward sex, especially in Sweden and other northern European countries, which today tend to be more sexually liberal than others. In Sweden and nearby countries at the time, these films, by virtue of being made by directors who had established themselves as leading names in their generation, helped delegitimize the idea of habitually demanding that films should avoid overtly sexual subject matter. It proved hard to question the seriousness of purpose of Bergman, Sjöman and others, and in their wake a consciously permissive and questioning attitude to sex, nudity and "difficult" subject matter in film - and on TV - became the new standard framework.

Explicit sex on screen and [[frontal nudity]] of men and women on stage became acceptable in many Western countries, as the twentieth century drew towards its close. Special places of entertainment offering [[striptease]] and [[lap dancing]] proliferated, and limits to 'acceptable' dress in pop/rock music and at [[discotheque]]s and live music festivals, especially open-air festivals ever since the flower-power generation and [[Woodstock]] (1969), became very vague, both among performers and in the audiences or attendee crowd. The rich use of [[crossdressing]] and [[androgyne|androgynous]] attributes and clothes in rock and pop stage costumes and even references to this in song lyrics, to express sexual, fashion or literary themes is also notable, from the [[Velvet Underground]] (in [[Lou Reed]]'s lyrics) and the [[glam rock]] wave and onward. All of this persists in the early 21st century.

In many Western countries, nudity is used as a part of artistic or erotic performance, such as in nude [[body painting]], [[sex show]], [[striptease]], [[Neo-Burlesque]], and in adult-only public events like [[Folsom Street Fair]], [[Nudes-A-Poppin']], [[Fantasy Fest]], etc.

==Normalization of pornography==
{{Further|History of pornography|Golden Age of Porn}}
Sexual character is closely linked with developments in technology, and the somewhat more open and commercial circulation of pornography was a new phenomenon at the time of the sexual revolution. Pornography operated as a form of "cultural critique" insofar as it transgresses societal conventions. [[Manuel Castells]] claims that the online communities, which emerged (from the 1980s) around early bulletin board systems originated from the ranks of those who had been part of the counterculture movements and alternative way of life emerging out of the sexual revolution.&lt;ref name=Pronography&gt;{{cite journal |last=Garlick |first=Steve |title=A New Sexual Revolution? Critical Theory, Pornography, and the Internet |journal=Canadian Review of Sociology |date=August 2011 |volume=48 |issue=3 |pages=221–239 |doi=10.1111/j.1755-618X.2011.01264.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1755-618X.2011.01264.x/abstract |accessdate=14 December 2012 |pmid=22214041 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319215111/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1755-618X.2011.01264.x/abstract |archivedate=19 March 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lynn Hunt]] points out that early modern "pornography" (18th century) is marked by a "preponderance of female narrators", that the women were portrayed as independent, determined, financially successful (though not always socially successful and recognized) and scornful of the new ideals of female virtue and domesticity, and not objectifications of women's bodies as many view pornography today. The sexual revolution was not unprecedented in identifying sex as a site of political potential and social culture. It was suggested during the sexual revolution that the interchangeability of bodies within pornography had radical implications for gender differences and that they could lose their meaning or at least redefine the meaning of gender roles and norms.&lt;ref name=Pronography /&gt; Porn had portrayed sexual activity honestly and bluntly in fiction, on stage and in movies. It could reinforce the crudest stereotypes of sex roles, standards of beauty, and power dynamics or educate about human desire.

In 1971 ''[[Playboy]]'' stopped airbrushing pubic hair out of its centerfold picture spreads; this new addition caused the magazine to hit its all-time peak circulation of more than seven million copies in 1972 and men started having more choices when it came to magazines.&lt;ref name="Easy Come, Easy Go" /&gt;

In 1972 ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'' became a popular movie for heterosexual couples. The movie played all over America and was the first porn movie to earn a gross of a million dollars.&lt;ref name="Easy Come, Easy Go" /&gt;

The fact that [[pornography]] was less stigmatised by the end of the 1980s, and more mainstream movies depicted [[sexual intercourse]] as entertainment, was indicative of how normalised sexual revolution had become in society. Magazines depicting nudity, such as the popular ''[[Playboy]]'' and ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' magazines, won some acceptance as mainstream journals, in which public figures felt safe expressing their fantasies.

Feminists have offered mixed responses to pornography. Some figures in the [[feminist]] movement, such as [[Andrea Dworkin]], challenged the depiction of women as objects in these pornographic or "urban men's" magazines. Other feminists such as [[Betty Dodson]] went on to found the [[pro-sex feminist]] movement in response to anti-pornography campaigns.
In India, an organization named Indians For Sexual Liberties is advocating the legalization of the porn business in India. The organization's founder, Laxman Singh, questioned the reasoning behind deeming as illegal the depiction of legal acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/Sexual-freedom-parade-at-Jantar-Mantar-this-weekend/articleshow/12616275.cms |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230150423/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/Sexual-freedom-parade-at-Jantar-Mantar-this-weekend/articleshow/12616275.cms |archivedate=2016-12-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Premarital sex==
[[Premarital sex]], which had been heavily stigmatised for some time became more widely accepted during the sexual revolution. The increased availability of [[birth control]] (and the quasi-legalisation of [[abortion]] in some places) helped reduce the chance that pre-marital sex would result in unwanted children. By the mid-1970s the majority of newly married American couples had experienced sex before marriage.&lt;ref&gt;For an analysis and facts about how technological advance in contraception changed the cost/benefit analysis for engaging in premaritial sex, see Fernández-Villaverde, Greenwood, and Guner (2014) "From Shame to Game in One Hundred Years: An Economic Model of the Rise in Premarital Sex and its De-Stigmitization," ''[[Journal of the European Economic Association]]'', '''12''' (1): 25-61. The research is summerized in this video: {{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR366Gq-5Sg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151026114212/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR366Gq-5Sg |archivedate=2015-10-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The central part of the sexual revolution was the development of relationships between unmarried adults, which resulted in earlier sexual experimentation reinforced by a later age of marriage. The counterculture and the [[new left]] were the source of this later age of marriage. Americans were attending colleges and rebelling against their parents' ideals, which caused them to marry later in age, if at all. This meant that on average, Americans were becoming more sexually experienced before they entered into monogamous relationships. The increasing divorce rate and the decreasing stigma attached to divorce during this era also contributed to sexual experimentation.&lt;ref name=GLBTQ /&gt;  By 1971, more than 75% of Americans thought that premarital sex was okay, a threefold increase from the 1950s, and the number of unmarried Americans aged twenty to twenty-four more than doubled from 1960 to 1976. Americans were becoming less and less interested in getting married and settling down and less interested in monogamous relationships. In 1971, 35% of the country said they thought marriage was obsolete.&lt;ref name="Easy Come, Easy Go" /&gt;

The idea of marriage being out-of-date came from the new development of casual sex between Americans. With the development of the birth control pill and the legalization of abortion in 1973, there was little threat of unwanted children out of wedlock. Also, during this time every sexually transmitted disease was treatable; there was no incurable bacterial STDs, no AIDS.&lt;ref name="Easy Come, Easy Go" /&gt;

Swinger clubs were organizing in places ranging from the informal suburban home to disco-sized emporiums that promised a smorgasbord of sexual possibilities and free mouthwash. In New York City in 1977, Larry Levenson opened [[Plato's Retreat]] it was probably the closest that heterosexual America has ever gotten to the sexual frenzy of gay bathhouses. The retreat was eventually shut down in 1985 because of the constant hassle from public health authorities.&lt;ref name="Easy Come, Easy Go" /&gt;

==Politics of sex==
[[Politics]] in the United States has become intertwined with sexually related issues, called the "politics of sex".{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} A differing view of abortion pitted [[pro-life]] activists against [[pro-choice]] activists.

Women and men who lived with each other without marriage sought "[[palimony]]" equal to the [[alimony]].{{sfn|Abidin|2007|p=}} Teenagers assumed their right to a sexual life with whomever they pleased, and bathers fought to be topless or nude at beaches.{{sfn|Abidin|2007|p=}}

==Criticism==
Fraenkel (1992) believes that the "sexual revolution", that the West supposedly experienced in the late 1960s, is indeed a misconception and that sex is not actually enjoyed freely, it is just observed in all the fields of culture; that is a kind of taboo behavior technically called "[[repressive desublimation]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Marcuse]] (1964) pp.59, 75–82&lt;/ref&gt;

Among [[radical feminists]], the view soon became widely held that, thus far, the sexual freedoms gained in the sexual revolution of the 1960s, such as the decreasing emphasis on [[monogamy]], had been largely gained by men at women's expense.&lt;ref name="Willis 1984 121"/&gt; In ''[[Anticlimax: A Feminist Perspective on the Sexual Revolution]]'', [[Sheila Jeffreys]] asserted that the sexual revolution on men's terms contributed less to women's freedom than to their continued oppression, an assertion that has both commanded respect and attracted intense criticism.&lt;ref name="Zoftig 1982 88"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vance 1992 302"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilbert"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Denfeld 1995 35"/&gt; In the late 1970s and early 1980s, [[feminist sex wars]] broke out due to disagreements [[Feminist views on pornography|on pornography]], [[Feminist views on prostitution|on prostitution]], and [[Feminist views on BDSM|on BDSM]], as well as [[Feminist views on sexuality|sexuality in general]].

==Backlash==

Allyn argues that the sexual optimism of the 1960s waned with the economic crises of the 1970s, the massive commercialization of sex, increasing reports of child exploitation, disillusionment with the counter-culture and the New Left, and a combined left-right backlash against sexual liberation as an ideal. The discovery of herpes escalated anxieties rapidly and set the stage for the nation's panicked response to AIDS.&lt;ref name=allyn /&gt;

Although the rate of teenage sexual activity is hard to record, the prevalence of [[teenage pregnancy]] in developed nations such as Canada and the UK have seen a steady decline since the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sexualityandu.ca/resource-library/statistics/teen-pregnancy-rates |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930135322/http://www.sexualityandu.ca/resource-library/statistics/teen-pregnancy-rates |archivedate=2011-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/8340988/Teenage-pregnancies-at-lowest-level-since-1980s.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Martin | last=Beckford | title=Teenage pregnancies at lowest level since 1980s | date=2011-02-23 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120627003556/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/8340988/Teenage-pregnancies-at-lowest-level-since-1980s.html | archivedate=2012-06-27 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 1991 there were 61.8 children born per 1,000 teenage girls in the United States.

'''Social alienation''' is "a condition in social relationships reflected by a low degree of [[social interaction|integration]] or [[Value (ethics)|common values]] and a high degree of distance or [[social isolation|isolation]] between individuals, or between an individual and a group of people in a community or work environment".&lt;ref name="robertankony.net"&gt;Ankony, Robert C., "The Impact of Perceived Alienation on Police Officers' Sense of Mastery and Subsequent Motivation for Proactive Enforcement", ''Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management'', vol. 22, no. 2 (1999): 120–32. [http://www.robertankony.net/publications/impact-perceived]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[sociology|sociological]] concept developed by several classical and contemporary theorists.&lt;ref&gt;Esp., [[Emile Durkheim]], 1951, 1984; [[Erich Fromm]], 1941, 1955; [[Karl Marx]], 1846, 1867; [[Georg Simmel]], 1950, 1971; Melvin Seeman, 1959; Kalekin-Fishman, 1998, and Robert Ankony, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has many discipline-specific uses, and can refer both to a personal psychological state (subjectively) and to a type of social relationship (objectively).

==History==
The term ''alienation'' has been used over the ages with varied and sometimes contradictory meanings. In ancient history it could mean a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] sense of achieving a higher state of [[contemplation]], [[Ecstasy (philosophy)|ecstasy]] or union—becoming alienated from a limited existence in the world, in a positive sense. Examples of this usage have been traced to [[neoplatonic]] philosophers such as [[Plotinus]] (in the Greek ''alloiosis''). There have also long been religious concepts of being separated or cut off from God and the faithful, alienated in a negative sense. The [[New Testament]] mentions the term ''apallotrioomai'' in Greek—"being alienated from". Ideas of estrangement from a [[Golden Age]], or due to a [[fall of man]], or approximate equivalents in differing [[cultures]] or [[religions]], have also been described as concepts of alienation. A double positive and negative sense of alienation is broadly shown in the spiritual beliefs referred to as [[Gnosticism]].

Alienation has also had a particular [[legal]]-[[political]] meaning since at least [[Ancient Roman]] times, where to [[Alienation (property law)|alienate]] property (''alienato'') is to transfer [[ownership]] of it to someone else. The term alienation itself comes from the [[Latin]] ''alienus'' which meant 'of another place or person', which in turn came from ''alius'', meaning "other" or "another". An alienus in ancient Roman times could refer to someone else's slave. Another usage of the term in Ancient Greco-Roman times was by [[physicians]] referring to disturbed, difficult or abnormal states of mind, generally attributed to imbalanced [[physiology]]. In Latin ''alienatio mentis'' (mental alienation), this usage has been dated to [[Asclepiades of Bithynia|Asclepiades]].&lt;ref&gt;E Regis (1895) [http://openlibrary.org/books/OL14035276M/A_practical_manual_of_mental_medicine A practical manual of mental medicine] 2nd ed., thoroughly rev. and largely rewritten. by E.

Originally bound and printed by 'the insane' of [[Utica Psychiatric Center|Utica asylum]]&lt;/ref&gt; Once translations of such works had resurfaced in the West in the 17th century, physicians again began using the term, which is typically attributed to [[Felix Platter]].

In [[medieval]] times, a relationship between alienation and [[social order]] has been described, mediated in part by [[mysticism]] and [[monasticism]]. The [[Crusades]] and [[witch-hunts]] have been described as forms of mass alienation.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhart B. Ladner (1967), "Homo Viator: Mediaeval Ideas on Alienation and Order," Speculum, Vol. 42, No. 2, pp. 233–259 (stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/pss/2854675)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 17th century &lt;!--Linked from 'Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel'--&gt;===
In the 17th century, [[Hugo Grotius]] put forward the concept that everyone has '[[Sovereignty|sovereign]] authority' over themselves but that they could alienate that natural right to the common good, an early [[social contract]] theory. In the 18th century, [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Hutcheson]] introduced a distinction between [[Natural and legal rights|alienable and unalienable rights]] in the legal sense of the term. [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] published influential works on the same theme, and is also seen as having popularized a more psychological-social concept relating to alienation from a [[state of nature]] due to the expansion of [[civil society]] or the [[nation state]].

In the same century a law of [[alienation of affection]] was introduced for men to seek compensation from other men accused of taking away 'their' woman.

In the history of literature, the [[German Romantics]] appear to be the first group of writers and poets in whose work the concept of alienation is regularly found.&lt;ref&gt;Rado Pribic (2008) [http://dspace.lafayette.edu/handle/10385/660 Alienation, Irony, and German Romanticism], Lafayette College, Easton, PA&lt;/ref&gt; Around the start of the 19th century, [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] popularized a Christian ([[Lutheran]]) and [[Idealist]] philosophy of alienation.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' (1998): [https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/alienation/v-1 "Alienation".]&lt;/ref&gt; He used German terms in partially different senses, referring to a psychological state and an objective process, and in general posited that the [[self]] was an historical and social creation, which becomes alienated from itself via a perceived [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] world, but can become de-alienated again when that world is seen as just another aspect of the self-consciousness, which may be achieved by self-sacrifice to the common good.

Around the same time, [[Philippe Pinel|Pinel]] was popularizing a new understanding of mental alienation, particularly through his 'medical-philosophical treatise'. He argued that people could be disturbed (alienated) by emotional states and social conditions, without necessarily having lost (become alienated from) their reason, as had generally been assumed. Hegel praised Pinel for his '[[moral treatment]]' approach, and developed related theories.&lt;ref&gt;Dora B.

[https://books.google.com/books?id=Gs5PRR9-8BcC Madness and Civilization], 1964/2001, p. 209.

Two camps formed following Hegel, the [[Young Hegelians|'young' or 'left' Hegelians]] who developed his philosophy to support innovations in politics or religion, and the [[Right Hegelians|'old' or 'right' Hegelians]] who took his philosophy in a politically and religiously conservative direction. The former camp has had a more lasting influence and, among them, [[Ludwig Feuerbach|Feuerbach]] differed from Hegel in arguing that worship of God is itself a form of alienation, because it projects human qualities on to an external idea, rather than realising them as part of the self.

===Marx===
{{Main|Marx's theory of alienation}}
Marx was initially in the Young Hegelian camp and, like Feuerbach, rejected the spiritual basis, and adapted Hegel's [[dialectic]] model to a theory of [[historical materialism|(historical) materialism]]. [[Marx's theory of alienation]] is articulated most clearly in the ''[[Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844]]'' and ''[[The German Ideology]]'' (1846). The [[Young Marx|'young' Marx]] wrote more often and directly of alienation than the 'mature' Marx, which some regard as an ideological break while others maintain that the concept remained central. There is generally held to be a transition from a philosophical-[[anthropological]] ([[Marxist humanism]]) concept (e.g. internal alienation from the self) to a [[structural]]-historical interpretation (e.g. external alienation by appropriation of labor), accompanied by a change in terminology from alienation to [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] to [[commodity fetishism]] and [[Reification (Marxism)|reification]].&lt;ref&gt;Frédéric Vandenberghe [https://books.google.com/books?id=cEpXcGXP274C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false A Philosophical History of German Sociology] Chapter One: Karl Marx: critique of the triple inversion of subject and objects: alienation, exploitation, and commodity fetishism. 2009, translated from the French&lt;/ref&gt; Marx's concepts of alienation have been classed into four types by [[Kostas Axelos]]: economic and social alienation, political alienation, human alienation, and ideological alienation.&lt;ref&gt;(Axelos, 1976)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the concept's most prominent use, it refers to the ''economic and social alienation'' aspect in which workers are disconnected from what they produce and why they produce. Marx believed that alienation is a systematic result of [[capitalism]]. Essentially, there is an "exploitation of men by men" where the division of labor creates an economic hierarchy (Axelos, 1976: 58). His theory of alienation was based upon his observation that in emerging [[industry|industrial]] production under capitalism, workers inevitably lose control of their lives and selves by not having any control of their work. Workers never become autonomous, self-realized human beings in any significant sense, except in the way the bourgeoisie wants the worker to be realized. His theory relies on Feuerbach's ''[[The Essence of Christianity]]'' (1841), which argues that the idea of God has alienated the characteristics of the [[human being]]. [[Max Stirner|Stirner]] would take the analysis further in ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'' (1844), declaring that even 'humanity' is an alienating ideal for the individual, to which Marx and Engels responded in ''The German Ideology'' (1845). Alienation in capitalist societies occurs because in [[labour (economics)|work]] each contributes to the common wealth but they can only express this fundamentally social aspect of individuality through a production system that is not publicly social but privately owned, for which each individual functions as an instrument, not as a social being. Kostas Axelos summarizes that for Marx, in capitalism "work renders man an alien to himself and to his own products." "The malaise of this alienation from the self means that the worker does not affirm himself but denies himself, does not feel content but unhappy....The worker only feels himself outside his work, and in his work he feels outside himself....Its alien character emerges clearly in the fact as soon as no physical or other compulsion exists, it is avoided like the plague.".&lt;ref&gt;Marx-Engels, in Zeitin, 1968:87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Purdue, William D., ''Sociological Theory: Explanation, Paradigm, and Ideology'', Mayfield Publishing Co., Palo Alto, CA, 1986:325&lt;/ref&gt; Marx also wrote, in a curtailed manner, that capitalist owners also experience alienation, through benefiting from the economic machine by endlessly competing, exploiting others and maintaining mass alienation in society.&lt;ref&gt;Bertell Ollman (1976) [https://books.google.com/books?id=8Ac4AAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Alienation: Marx's Conception of Man in Capitalist Society] Chapter 23: The Capitalist's Alienation. Cambridge U.P., 1971; 2nd ed., 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of ''Political Alienation'' refers to the idea that "politics is the form that organizes the productive forces of the economy" in a way that is alienating because it "distorts the logic of economic development".&lt;ref&gt;(Axelos, 1976: 87)&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Human Alienation'', individuals become estranged to themselves in the quest to stay alive, where "they lose their true existence in the struggle for subsistence" (Axelos, 1976: 111). Marx focuses on two aspects of human nature which he calls "historical conditions." The first aspect refers to the necessity of food, clothes, shelter, and more. Secondly, Marx believes that after satisfying these basic needs people have the tendency to develop more "needs" or desires that they will work towards satisfying, hence, humans become stuck in a cycle of never ending wants which makes them strangers to each other.&lt;ref&gt;(Axelos, 1976: 113)&lt;/ref&gt;

When referring to ''ideological alienation'', Axelos proposes that Marx believes that all religions divert people away from "their true happiness" and instead turn them towards "illusory happiness".&lt;ref&gt;(Axelos, 1976: 161-162)&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a commonly noted problem of translation in grappling with ideas of alienation derived from German-language philosophical texts: the word ''alienation'', and similar words such as ''estrangement'', are often used interchangeably to translate two distinct German words, ''[[:de:Entfremdung|Entfremdung]]'' and ''[[:de:Entäußerung|Entäußerung]]''. The former means specifically interpersonal estrangement, while the latter can have a broader and more active meaning that might refer also to externalization, relinquishment, or sale (alienation) of property. In general, and contrary to his predecessors, Marx may have used the terms interchangeably, though he also wrote "''Entfremdung''...constitutes the real interest of this ''Entäußerung''."&lt;ref&gt;Chris Arthur (1986), ''The Dialectics of Labor'' (Oxford: Blackwell, 1986), p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late 1800s to 1900s===
Many sociologists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries were concerned about alienating effects of modernization. German sociologists [[Georg Simmel]] and [[Ferdinand Tönnies]] wrote critical works on [[individualism|individualization]] and [[urbanization]]. Simmel's ''[[The Philosophy of Money]]'' describes how relationships become more and more mediated by money. Tönnies' ''[[Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft]]'' (''Community and Society'') is about the loss of primary relationships such as [[family|familial]] bonds in favour of [[Objective (goal)|goal]]-oriented, secondary [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]]. This idea of alienation can be observed in some other contexts, although the term may not be as frequently used. In the context of an individual's relationships within society, alienation can mean the unresponsiveness of society as a whole to the individuality of each member of the society. When collective decisions are made, it is usually impossible for the unique needs of each person to be taken into account.

The American sociologist [[C. Wright Mills]] conducted a major study of alienation in modern society with ''[[White Collar: The American Middle Classes|White Collar]]'' in 1951, describing how modern consumption-capitalism has shaped a society where you have to sell your personality in addition to your work. Melvin Seeman was part of a surge in alienation research during the mid-20th century when he published his paper, "On the Meaning of Alienation", in 1959 (Senekal, 2010b: 7–8).  Seeman used the insights of Marx, Emile Durkheim and others to construct what is often considered a model to recognize the five prominent features of alienation: powerlessness, meaninglessness, normlessness, isolation and self-estrangement (Seeman, 1959).&lt;ref&gt;Ankony, Robert C., "The Impact of Perceived Alienation on Police Officer's Sense of Mastery and Subsequent Motivation for Proactive Enforcement," ''Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management,'' vol. 22, no.2 (1999): 120-32. [http://www.robertankony.net/publications/impact-perceived]&lt;/ref&gt;  Seeman later added a sixth element (cultural estrangement), although this element does not feature prominently in later discussions of his work.

In a broader [[philosophy|philosophical]] context, especially in [[existentialism]] and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], alienation describes the inadequacy of the human [[being]] (or the [[mind]]) in relation to the world. The human mind (as the [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] who perceives) sees the world as an object of perception, and is distanced from the world, rather than living within it. This line of thought is generally traced to the works of [[Søren Kierkegaard]] in the 19th century, who, from a Christian viewpoint, saw alienation as separation from God, and also examined the [[emotion]]s and [[feeling]]s of individuals when faced with life choices. Many [[20th-century philosophy|20th-century philosophers]] (both theistic and atheistic) and theologians were influenced by [[Kierkegaard]]'s notions of angst, despair and the importance of the individual. [[Martin Heidegger]]'s concepts of anxiety (angst) and mortality drew from Kierkegaard; he is indebted to the way Kierkegaard lays out the importance of our subjective relation to truth, our existence in the face of death, the temporality of existence and the importance of passionately affirming one's being-in-the-world. [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] described the "thing-in-itself" which is infinite and overflowing, and claimed that any attempt to describe or understand the thing-in-itself is "reflective consciousness". Since there is no way for the reflective consciousness to subsume the pre-reflective, Sartre argued that all reflection is fated to a form of anxiety (i.e. the [[human condition]]). As well, Sartre argued that when a person tries to gain knowledge of the "Other"  (meaning beings or objects that are not the self), their [[self-consciousness]] has a "masochistic desire" to be limited. This is expressed metaphorically in the line from the play ''[[No Exit]]'', "Hell is other people".

In the theory of [[psychoanalysis]] developed around the start of the 20th century, [[Sigmund Freud]] did not explicitly address the concept of alienation, but other analysts subsequently have. It is a theory of divisions and conflicts between the conscious and [[unconscious mind]], between different parts of a hypothetical [[psychic apparatus]], and between the self and [[civilization]]. It postulates [[defense mechanisms]], including [[splitting (psychology)|splitting]], in both normal and disturbed functioning. The concept of [[Psychological repression|repression]] has been described as having functionally equivalent effects as the idea of [[false consciousness]] associated with Marxist theory.&lt;ref&gt;[[Felix Geyer]] (2001) [http://www.unizar.es/sociocybernetics/chen/felix/pfge15.pdf Alienation, Sociology of] in International Encyclopedia of the Social and Behavioral Sciences, Paul Baltes and Neil Smelser, Eds., London: Elsevier&lt;/ref&gt;

A form of [[Western Marxism]] developed during the century, which included influential analyses of false consciousness by [[György Lukács]]. Critics of [[bureaucracy]] and the [[Protestant Ethic]] also drew on the works of [[Max Weber]].

Figures associated with [[critical theory]], in particular with the [[Frankfurt School]], such as [[Theodor Adorno]] and [[Erich Fromm]], also developed theories of alienation, drawing on [[neo-Marxist]] ideas as well as other influences including [[neo-Freudian]] and sociological theories. One approach applies Marxist theories of [[commodification]] to the cultural, educational and [[Political party|party-political]] spheres. Links are drawn between socioeconomic structures, psychological states of alienation, and personal human relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Rafael D. Pangilinan (2009) [http://www.kritike.org/journal/issue_6/pangilinan_december2009.pdf Against Alienation: The Emancipative Potential of Critical Pedagogy in Fromm] Kritike, Vol3, No2&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s the revolutionary group [[Situationist International]] came to some prominence, staging 'situations' intended to highlight an alternative way of life to [[advanced capitalism]], the latter conceptualized as a diffuse '[[Spectacle (critical theory)|spectacle]]', a fake reality masking a degradation of human life. [[The Theory of Communicative Action]] associated with [[Jürgen Habermas]] emphasizes the essential role of [[language]] in [[public sphere|public life]], suggesting that alienation stems from the distortion of reasoned moral debate by the strategic dominance of [[Market (economics)|market]] forces and [[State (polity)|state]] power.

This critical program can be contrasted with traditions that attempt to extract problems of alienation from the broader socioeconomic context, or which at least accept the broader context on its own terms, and which often attribute problems to individual abnormality or failures to adjust.&lt;ref&gt;Dahms, H. "Does Alienation have a Future? Recapturing the Core of Critical Theory." In [https://books.google.com/books?id=nIZctokjRlQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0 Trauma, Promise, and the Millennium: The Evolution of Alienation]. ed. L. Langman and D.K. Fishman. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the boom in alienation research that characterized the 1950s and 1960s, interest in alienation research subsided (Geyer, 1996: xii), although in sociology it was maintained by the Research Committee on Alienation of the [[International Sociological Association]] (ISA).  In the 1990s, there was again an upsurge of interest in alienation prompted by the fall of the [[Soviet Union]], [[globalization]], the information explosion, increasing awareness of ethnic conflicts, and [[post-modernism]] (see Geyer, 1996). Geyer believes the growing complexity of the contemporary world and post-modernism prompted a reinterpretation of alienation that suits the contemporary living environment. In late 20th and early 21st century sociology, it has been particularly the works of Felix Geyer, Lauren Langman and Devorah Kalekin-Fishman that address the issue of alienation in the contemporary western world.

==Powerlessness==
Alienation in the sense of a lack of [[Power (philosophy)|power]] has been technically defined by Seeman as "the expectancy or probability held by the individual that his own behaviour cannot determine the occurrence of the outcomes, or reinforcements, he seeks." Seeman argues that this is "the notion of alienation as it originated in the Marxian view of the worker's condition in capitalist society: the worker is alienated to the extent that the [[prerogative]] and means of decision are expropriated by the ruling entrepreneurs".&lt;ref&gt;(Seeman, 1959: 784)&lt;/ref&gt;  More succinctly, Kalekin-Fishman (1996: 97) says, "A person suffers from alienation in the form of 'powerlessness' when she is conscious of the gap between what she would like to do and what she feels capable of doing".

In discussing powerlessness, Seeman also incorporated the insights of the psychologist [[Julian Rotter]]. Rotter distinguishes between internal control and external [[locus of control]], which means "differences (among persons or situations) in the degree to which success or failure is attributable to external factors (e.g. luck, chance, or powerful others), as against success or failure that is seen as the outcome of one's personal skills or characteristics".&lt;ref&gt;(Seeman, 1966: 355)&lt;/ref&gt; Powerlessness, therefore, is the perception that the individual does not have the means to achieve his goals.

More recently, Geyer&lt;ref&gt;Geyer (1996: xxiii)&lt;/ref&gt; remarks that "a new type of powerlessness has emerged, where the core problem is no longer being unfree but rather being unable to select from among an [[overchoice]] of alternatives for action, whose consequences one often cannot even fathom". Geyer adapts [[cybernetics]] to alienation theory, and writes (1996: xxiv) that powerlessness is the result of delayed [[feedback]]: "The more complex one's environment, the later one is confronted with the latent, and often unintended, consequences of one's actions.  Consequently, in view of this causality-obscuring time lag, both the 'rewards' and 'punishments' for one's actions increasingly tend to be viewed as random, often with [[apathy]] and alienation as a result".

==Meaninglessness==
A sense of [[meaning (existential)|meaning]] has been defined by Seeman as "the individual's sense of understanding events in which he is engaged".&lt;ref&gt;(Seeman, 1959: 786)&lt;/ref&gt;  Seeman (1959: 786) writes that meaninglessness "is characterized by a low expectancy that satisfactory predictions about the future outcomes of behaviour can be made." Whereas powerlessness refers to the sensed ability to control outcomes, this refers to the sensed ability to predict outcomes.  In this respect, meaninglessness is closely tied to [[powerlessness]]; Seeman (Ibid.) argues, "the view that one lives in an intelligible world might be a prerequisite to expectancies for control; and the unintelligibility of complex affairs is presumably conducive to the development of high expectancies for external control (that is, high powerlessness)".

Geyer (1996: xxiii) believes meaninglessness should be reinterpreted for postmodern times: "With the accelerating throughput of information [...] meaningless is not a matter anymore of whether one can assign meaning to incoming information, but of whether one can develop adequate new scanning mechanisms to gather the goal-relevant information one needs, as well as more efficient selection procedures to prevent being overburdened by the information one does not need, but is bombarded with on a regular basis."  "[[Information overload]]" or the so-called "data tsunami" are well-known information problems confronting contemporary man, and Geyer thus argues that meaninglessness is turned on its head.

==Normlessness==
Normlessness (or what [[Durkheim]] referred to as [[anomie]]) "denotes the situation in which the social norms regulating individual conduct have broken down or are no longer effective as rules for behaviour".&lt;ref&gt;(Seeman, 1959: 787)&lt;/ref&gt; This aspect refers to the inability to identify with the dominant values of society or rather, with what are perceived to be the dominant values of society. Seeman (1959: 788) adds that this aspect can manifest in a particularly negative manner, "The anomic situation [...] may be defined as one in which there is a high expectancy that socially unapproved behaviours are required to achieve given goals".  This negative manifestation is dealt with in detail by Catherine Ross and John Mirowski in a series of publications on mistrust, powerlessness, normlessness and crime.

Neal &amp; Collas (2000: 122) write, "Normlessness derives partly from conditions of complexity and conflict in which individuals become unclear about the composition and enforcement of social norms.  Sudden and abrupt changes occur in life conditions, and the norms that usually operate may no longer seem adequate as guidelines for conduct".  This is a particular issue after the fall of the Soviet Union, mass migrations from developing to developed countries, and the general sense of disillusionment that characterized the 1990s (Senekal, 2011). Traditional values that had already been questioned (especially during the 1960s) were met with further scepticism in the 1990s, resulting in a situation where individuals rely more often on their own judgement than on institutions of authority: "The individual not only has become more independent of the churches, but from other social institutions as well.  The individual can make more personal choices in far more life situations than before" (Halman, 1998: 100). These choices are not necessarily "negative": Halman's study found that Europeans remain relatively conservative morally, even though the authority of the Church and other institutions has eroded.

==Relationships==
One concept used in regard to specific relationships is that of [[parental alienation]], where a child is distanced from and expresses a general dislike for one of their parents (who may have [[divorced]] or [[legal separation|separated]]).  The term is not applied where there is [[child abuse]]. The parental alienation might be due to specific influences from either parent or could result from the [[social dynamics]] of the family as a whole. It can also be understood in terms of [[attachment theory|attachment]], the social and emotional process of bonding between child and caregiver. [[Adoptees]] can feel alienated from both adoptive parents and birth parents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bjlifton.com/journey.htm Journey of the Adopted Self: A Quest for Wholeness]&lt;/ref&gt;

Familial estrangement between parents and adult children "is attributed to a number of biological, psychological, social, and structural factors affecting the family, including attachment disorders, incompatible values and beliefs, unfulfilled expectations, critical life events and transitions, parental alienation, and ineffective communication patterns." The degree of alienation has been positively correlated with decreased emotional functioning in the parent who feels a loss of identity and stigma.&lt;ref&gt;Agllias, Kylie. (Sep 2013).

[[Attachment in adults|Attachment relationships in adults]] can also involve feelings of alienation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aamft.org/imis15/Content/Consumer_Updates/Adult_Attachment_Relationships.aspx AAMFT Consumer Update]&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, emotional alienation is said to be a common way of life for many, whether it is experienced as overwhelming, or is not admitted to in the midst of a [[rat race|socioeconomic race]], or contributes to seemingly unrelated problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rokach|first=Ami|title=Loneliness then and now: Reflections on social and emotional alienation in everyday life|journal=Current Psychology|year=2004|volume=23|issue=1|pages=24–40|doi=10.1007/s12144-004-1006-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social isolation==
Social isolation refers to "The feeling of being segregated from one's community".&lt;ref name="Kalekin-Fishman, 1996: 97"&gt;(Kalekin-Fishman, 1996: 97)&lt;/ref&gt; Neal and Collas (2000: 114) emphasize the centrality of social isolation in the modern world: "While social isolation is typically experienced as a form of personal stress, its sources are deeply embedded in the social organization of the modern world.  With increased isolation and atomization, much of our daily interactions are with those who are strangers to us and with whom we lack any ongoing social relationships."

Since the fall of the Soviet Union and the end of the [[Cold War]], migrants from [[Eastern Europe]] and the developing countries have flocked to developed countries in search of a better living standard. This has led to entire communities becoming uprooted: no longer fully part of their homelands, but neither integrated into their adopted communities. [[Diaspora]] literature depicts the plights of these migrants, such as [[Hafid Bouazza]] in Paravion. Senekal (2010b: 41) argues, "Low-income communities or religious minorities may feel separated from mainstream society, leading to backlashes such as the civil unrest that occurred in French cities in October 2005.  The fact that the riots subsequently spread to Belgium, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Greece, and Switzerland, illustrates that not only did these communities feel segregated from mainstream society, but also that they found a community in their isolation; they regarded themselves as kindred spirits".

==Among returning war veterans==
{{POV-section|date=March 2017}}
Because of intense group solidarity and unique daily hardships brought by combat, many veterans feel alienated from citizens, family, and friends when they return. They often feel they have little in common with civilian peers; issues that concern friends and family seem trivial after combat.&lt;ref&gt;Welch, William M., "Trauma of Iraq war haunting thousands returning home," ''USA Today'', February 28, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; There is a clarity of focus and purpose that comes with war that few in civilian life will ever know. Afghanistan veteran Brendon O'Byrne says, "We were really close. Physically and emotionally close. It's kind of terrifying being in such an emotionally safe environment and then suddenly be expelled into an alienated, fractured society."&lt;ref name="Warfighter's paradox 26"&gt;Junger, Sebastian, "Warfighter's paradox", ''Army Times'', Washington, D.C., June 10, 2014, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The challenges of re-entering a civilian life where few people have experienced combat may contribute to the sense of loneliness.&lt;ref name="Warfighter's paradox 27"&gt;Junger, Sebastian, "Warfighter's paradox", ''Army Times'', Washington, D.C., June 10, 2014, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; As filmmaker and war correspondent Sebastian Junger says, "They didn't want to go back because it was traumatic, but because it was a place where they understood what they were supposed to do.

The experience of the Vietnam veteran was distinctly different from that of veterans of other American wars.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, Lt. Col. Dave, ''On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society,'' Time Warner Book Group, New York, NY (1996): 275.&lt;/ref&gt; Once he completed his tour of duty, he usually severed all bonds with his unit and comrades. It was extremely rare for a veteran to write to his buddies who were still in combat, and (in strong contrast to the endless reunions of World War II veterans) for more than a decade it was even rarer for more than two or more of them to get together after the war.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, Lt. Col. Dave, ''On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society,'' Time Warner Book Group, New York, NY (1996): 275-76.&lt;/ref&gt; Korean War veterans had no memorial and precious few parades, but they fought an invading army and they left behind them the free, healthy, thriving, and grateful nation of South Korea. No one spat on them or called them murderers or baby killers when they returned. Only the veterans of Vietnam have endured a concerted, organized, psychological attack by its own people. Never in American history, perhaps never in all of Western civilization, has an army suffered such an agony from its own people.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, Lt. Col. Dave, Psychologist, ''On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society,'' Time Warner Book Group, New York, NY (1996): 290.&lt;/ref&gt; The Vietnam War was a long, contentious conflict (1955–75) which in the mid to late 1960s started to lose political and domestic support, most notably in academia and film that often portrayed soldiers of this conflict as ignoble adding to their social alienation. That the Vietnam War was ultimately lost on April 30, 1975, furthered the sense of meaninglessness and malaise.&lt;ref&gt;Ankony, Robert C, "Perspectives," ''Vietnam'' magazine, August 2002: 58–61. [http://www.robertankony.net/publications/perspectives]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been demonstrated that as the perception of community alienation increases, an individual's sense of confidence or mastery in decision making will decrease, and so too their motivation to socially engage.&lt;ref name="robertankony.net"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Ankony, Robert C., "Community Alienation and Its Impact on Police," ''Police Chief'', October 1999: 150-53. [http://www.robertankony.net/publications/the-impact-of-community-alienation-on-police-officers]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political alienation==
One manifestation of the above dimensions of alienation can be a feeling of estrangement from, and a lack of engagement in, the [[political system]]. Such [[political alienation]] could result from not identifying with any particular political party or message, and could result in [[revolution]], [[reform]]ing behavior, or [[abstention]] from the political process, possibly due to [[voter apathy]].&lt;ref&gt;David C. Schwartz [https://books.google.com/books?id=7wOVheiteOkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Political Alienation and Political Behavior] Transaction Publishers, 30 Apr 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar concept is [[policy alienation]], where workers experience a state of psychological disconnection from a [[policy]] programme being implemented.

==Self-estrangement==
Self-estrangement is an elusive concept in sociology, as recognized by Seeman (1959), although he included it as an aspect in his model of alienation. Some, with Marx, consider [[self-estrangement]] to be the end result and thus the heart of social alienation. Self-estrangement can be defined as "the psychological state of denying one's own interests – of seeking out [[Motivation#Incentive theories: intrinsic and extrinsic motivation|extrinsically satisfying, rather than intrinsically satisfying]], activities...".&lt;ref name="Kalekin-Fishman, 1996: 97"/&gt; It could be characterized as a feeling of having become a stranger to oneself, or to some parts of oneself, or alternatively as a problem of [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|self-knowledge]], or [[Authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]].

Seeman (1959) recognized the problems inherent in defining the "self", while post-modernism in particular has questioned the very possibility of pin-pointing what precisely "self" constitutes. Gergen (1996: 125) argues that: "the traditional view of self versus society is deeply problematic and should be replaced by a conception of the self as always already immersed in relatedness.  On this account, the individual's lament of 'not belonging' is partially a by-product of traditional [[discourse]]s themselves". If the self is relationally constituted, does it make sense to speak of "self-estrangement" rather than "social isolation"? Costas and Fleming (2009: 354) suggest that although the concept of self-estrangement "has not weathered postmodern criticisms of [[essentialism]] and [[economic determinism]] well", the concept still has value if a [[Lacanian]] reading of the self is adopted. This can be seen as part of a wider debate on the [[concept of self]] between [[humanism]] and [[antihumanism]], [[structuralism]] and [[post-structuralism]], or [[nature]] and [[nurture]].

==Mental disturbance==
Until early in the 20th century, psychological problems were referred to in psychiatry as states of mental alienation, implying that a person had become separated from themselves, their reason or the world. From the 1960s alienation was again considered in regard to clinical states of disturbance, typically using a broad concept of a 'schizoid' ('splitting') process taken from [[psychoanalytic]] theory. The splitting was said to occur within regular child development and in everyday life, as well as in more extreme or dysfunctional form in conditions such as [[schizoid personality]] and [[schizophrenia]]. Varied concepts of alienation and self-estrangement were used to link internal schizoid states with observable symptoms and with external socioeconomic divisions, without necessarily explaining or evidencing underlying causation. [[R. D. Laing]] was particularly influential in arguing that [[dysfunctional family|dysfunctional families]] and socioeconomic oppression caused states of alienation and [[ontological security|ontological insecurity]] in people, which could be considered adaptations but which were diagnosed as disorders by mainstream psychiatry and society.(Laing,[1967] 1959).&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Frank (1975) [http://www.positivedisintegration.com/Johnson1975.pdf Psychological Alienation: Isolation and Self-Estrangement] Psychoanalytic Review 62:3 Pg 369. Reprinted from Alienation: Concept, Term, and Meanings, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; The specific theories associated with Laing and others at that time are not widely accepted, but work from other theoretical perspectives sometimes addresses the same theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lysaker|first=P.

In a related vein, for [[Ian Parker (psychologist)|Ian Parker]], psychology ''normalizes'' conditions of social alienation. While it could help groups of individuals emancipate themselves, it serves the role of reproducing existing conditions.(Parker, 2007). This view can be seen as part of a broader tradition sometimes referred to as [[critical psychology]] or [[liberation psychology]], which emphasizes that an individual is enmeshed within a social-political framework, and so therefore are psychological problems. Similarly, some psychoanalysts suggest that while psychoanalysis emphasizes environmental causes and reactions, it also attributes the problems of individuals to internal conflicts stemming from early psychosocial development, effectively divorcing them from the wider ongoing context.&lt;ref&gt;Lynne Layton, Nancy Caro Hollander, Susan Gutwill (Eds) (2006) [https://books.google.com/books?id=7-DnX73bkC0C&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Psychoanalysis, class and politics: encounters in the clinical setting] Introduction; Pg 47&lt;/ref&gt; [[Slavoj Zizek]] (drawing on [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Michel Foucault]], and [[Jacques Lacan|Jacques Lacan's]] psychoanalysis) argues that in today's capitalist society, the individual is estranged from their self through the repressive injunction to "enjoy!" Such an injunction does not allow room for the recognition of alienation and, indeed, could itself be seen as an expression of alienation.(Zizek, 1994).

[[Frantz Fanon]], an early writer on [[postcolonialism]], studied the conditions of objectification and violent oppression (lack of autonomy) believed to have led to [[mental disorders]] among the [[colonized]] in the Third World (in particular Africans) (Fanon, ([2004] 1961).

A process of '[[malignant]] alienation' has been observed in regard to some psychiatric patients, especially in forensic units and for individuals labeled 'difficult' or who aren't liked by at least some staff, which involves a breakdown of the therapeutic relationship between staff and patients, and which may end in the [[suicide]] of the patient.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Whittle Chapter 7: Malignant Alienation. In Gwen Adshead, Caroline Jacob [https://books.google.com/books?id=NHaHcA8sDoUC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Personality disorder: the definitive reader] 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hadfield|first=J.|author2=Brown, D. |author3=Pembroke, L. |author4=Hayward, M. |title=Analysis of Accident and Emergency Doctors' Responses to Treating People Who Self-Harm|journal=Qualitative Health Research|date=8 May 2009|volume=19|issue=6|pages=755–765|doi=10.1177/1049732309334473}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with long-term mental disorders, which may have originally stemmed from social alienation, can experience particular social and existential alienation within their communities due to other people's and potentially their own negative attitudes towards themselves and 'odd' behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Erdner|first=Anette |author2=Magnusson, Annabella |author3=Nystrom, Maria |author4=Lutzen, Kim|title=Social and existential alienation experienced by people with long-term mental illness|journal=Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences|date=1 December 2005|volume=19|issue=4|pages=373–380|doi=10.1111/j.1471-6712.2005.00364.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disability==
Differences between persons with [[disability|disabilities]] and individuals in relative abilities, or perceived abilities, can be a cause of alienation. One study, "Social Alienation and Peer Identification: A Study of the Social Construction of Deafness",&lt;ref&gt;Foster, S. (1989), [http://sfaa.metapress.com/app/home/contribution.asp?referrer=parent&amp;backto=issue,5,10;journal,90,279;linkingpublicationresults,1:113218,1 Social Alienation and Peer Identification: A Study of the Social Construction of Deafness], ''Human Organization'', Volume 48, Number 3, pp. 226–235&lt;/ref&gt; found that among deaf adults one theme emerged consistently across all categories of life experience: [[social rejection]] by, and alienation from, the larger hearing community. Only when the respondents described interactions with deaf people did the theme of isolation give way to comments about participation and meaningful interaction. This appeared to be related to specific needs, for example for real conversation, for information, the opportunity to develop close friendships and a sense of family. It was suggested that the social meaning of deafness is established by interaction between deaf and hearing people, sometimes resulting in [[marginalization]] of the deaf, which is sometimes challenged. It has also led to the creation of alternatives and the deaf community is described as one such alternative.

Physicians and nurses often deal with people who are temporarily or permanently alienated from communities, which could be a result or a cause of medical conditions and suffering, and it has been suggested that therefore attention should be paid to learning from experiences of the special pain that alienation can bring.&lt;ref&gt;Janice L. Willms [http://www.annals.org/content/126/11/923.extract Lingua Medica: Alienation and Imagination: The Literature of Exclusion] Annals of Internal Medicine June 1, 1997 vol. 126 no. 11 923-926&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Younger|first=JB|title=The alienation of the sufferer.|journal=Advances in Nursing Science|date=June 1995|volume=17|issue=4|pages=53–72|pmid=7625781}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In art==
Alienation is most often represented in [[literature]] as the psychological isolation of an individual from society or community. In a volume of Bloom's Literary Themes, [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'' is described as the 'supreme literary portrait' of alienation, while noting that some may argue for [[Achilles]] in the ''[[Iliad]]''. In addition, ''[[Bartleby, the Scrivener]]'' is introduced as a perfect example because so many senses of alienation are present. Other literary works described as dealing with the theme of alienation are: ''[[The Bell Jar]]'', ''[[Black Boy]]'', ''[[Brave New World]]'', ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'', ''[[The Chosen (Potok novel)|The Chosen]]'', ''[[Dubliners]]'', ''[[Othello]]'', ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'', ''[[Invisible Man]]'', ''[[Mrs Dalloway]]'', ''[[Notes from Underground]]'', ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (novel)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'', ''[[The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'', ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]'' and ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]'', ''[[The Trial]]'', ''[[The Castle (novel)|The Castle]]'', ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'', ''[[The Waste Land]]'', and ''[[Young Goodman Brown]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Blake Hobby, Harold Bloom (Ed) [https://books.google.com/books?id=zQLTOk18LwMC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Bloom's Literary Themes: Alienation] Infobase Publishing, 1 Feb 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary British works noted for their perspective on alienation include ''[[The Child in Time]]'', ''[[London Fields (novel)|London Fields]]'', ''[[Trainspotting (novel)|Trainspotting]]'', and ''[[Regeneration (novel)|Regeneration]]'' (Senekal, 2008 &amp; 2010b: 102–123).

Sociologist [[Harry Dahms]] has analysed [[The Matrix Trilogy]] of films in the context of theories of alienation in modern society. He suggests that the central theme of ''[[The Matrix]]'' is the "all-pervasive yet increasingly invisible prevalence of alienation in the world today, and difficulties that accompany attempts to overcome it".&lt;ref&gt;Harry F. Dahms [http://web.utk.edu/~hdahms/Emergence.pdf THE MATRIX Trilogy as Critical Theory of Alienation: Communicating a Message of Radical Transformation.] Transdisciplinary Journal of Emergence. 3 (1) 2005: 108–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

See also Langman's study of ''punk, porn, and resistance'' (2008) and Senekal's (2011) study of [[Afrikaans]] [[extreme metal]].

British [[progressive rock]] band [[Pink Floyd]]'s concept album ''[[The Wall]]'' (1979) and British [[alternative rock]] band [[Radiohead]]'s album ''[[OK Computer]]'' (1997), both deal with the subject of alienation in their lyrics.

==Overview==
According to a 1969 study, no major labor organization in American history has ever openly advocated violence as a policy, although some, in the  early part of the 20th century, systematically used violence, most notably the Western Federation of Miners, and the International Association of Bridge Structural Iron Workers.&lt;ref name="commission1969"/&gt; However, violence does occur in the context of industrial disputes. When violence has been committed by, or in the name of, the union, it has tended to be narrowly focused upon targets which are associated with the employer.&lt;ref name="commission1969"/&gt; Violence was greater in conflicts in which there was a question of whether union recognition would be extended.&lt;ref name="commission1969"/&gt;

Both employers and workers have each been the aggressor and victim at different times.&lt;ref name="commission1969"/&gt; The "most virulent" violence in United States industrial disputes occurred when management tried to destroy a union or deny recognition to a union.&lt;ref name="commission1969"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;282&lt;/sup&gt;

Union violence most typically occurs in specific situations, and has more frequently been aimed at preventing [[Strikebreaker|replacement workers]] from taking jobs during a strike, than at managers or employers.&lt;ref name="commission1969"/&gt;

Protest and verbal abuse are routinely aimed against union members or replacement workers who cross picket lines ("blacklegs") during industrial disputes. The inherent aim of a union is to create a labor [[monopoly]] so as to balance the [[monopsony]] a large employer enjoys as a purchaser of labor. Strikebreakers threaten that goal and undermine the union's bargaining position, and occasionally this erupts into violent confrontation, with violence committed either by, or against, strikers.&lt;ref name="commission1969"/&gt; Some who have sought to explain such violence observe, if labor disputes are accompanied by violence, it may be because labor has no legal redress.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bernard Hogg, "Public Reaction to Pinkertonism and the Labor Question," Pennsylvania History 11 (July 1944), 171--199, citing John Bascom, "Civil Law and Social Progress," The Independent, vol. xliv (September 15, 1892), p. 1279.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1894, some workers declared:

&lt;blockquote&gt;..."the right of employers to manage their own business to suit themselves," is fast coming to mean in effect nothing less than a right to manage the country to suit themselves.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bernard Hogg, "Public Reaction to Pinkertonism and the Labor Question," Pennsylvania History 11 (July 1944), 171--199, citing the advisory committee of the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers during the Homestead Strike&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A 1969 study of labor conflict violence in the United States examined the era following the 1947 passage of the Taft-Hartley Act, and concluded that violence had substantially abated. In the 16 years from 1947 through 1962, 29 people died in labor conflicts, a rate much lower than in previous eras. The study noted that attacks on strikers by company guards had all but disappeared. They estimated from NLRB records that 80 to 100 acts of violence by union members or supporters occurred each year, most of the attacks on people being unplanned fights with strikebreakers crossing picket lines. In the 1960s, the most common complaint of union violence was of sabotage during labor disputes. Numerous incidents included dynamite explosions, but targeting property, and without any dynamite-related injuries.&lt;ref name="commission1969"/&gt;

===Great Railroad Strike of 1877===
{{main|Great Railroad Strike of 1877}}

[[File:Harpers 8 11 1877 6th Regiment Fighting Baltimore.jpg|thumb|Sixth Regiment of the Maryland Militia fighting its way through [[Baltimore, Maryland]], 20 July 1877]]

The great railroad strike of 1877 saw considerable violence by, and against, workers, and occurred before unions were widespread. It started on July 14 in [[Martinsburg, West Virginia]], in response to the cutting of wages for the second time in a year by the [[Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad]] (B&amp;O). Striking workers would not allow any of the stock to roll until this second wage cut was revoked. The governor sent in state militia units to restore train service, but the soldiers refused to use force against the strikers and the governor called for federal troops.

Violent street battles occurred in Maryland between the striking workers and the Maryland militia.  When the outnumbered troops of the 6th Regiment fired on an attacking crowd, they killed 10 and wounded 25.&lt;ref name="scharf"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Scharf|first=J. Thomas|title=History of Maryland From the Earliest Period to the Present Day|publisher=Tradition Press|date=1967 |origyear=1879 |location = Hatboro, PA|volume=3|pages=733–42 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rioters injured several members of the militia, damaged engines and train cars, and burned portions of the train station.&lt;ref name="scharf"/&gt; On July 21–22, the President sent federal troops and Marines to [[Baltimore]] to restore order.

In Pittsburgh, strikers threw rocks at militiamen, who [[bayoneted]] their antagonists, killing twenty people and wounding twenty-nine others.

[[File:Harpers 8 11 1877 Steeple View of Pittsburgh Conflagaration.jpg|thumb|Burning of Pennsylvania Railroad and Union Depot, [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], 21–22 July 1877]]
In [[Reading, Pennsylvania]], workers conducted mass marches, blocked rail traffic, committed trainyard arson, and burned a bridge. The state militia shot sixteen citizens in the [[Reading Railroad Massacre]]. The militia responsible for the shootings was mobilized by Reading Railroad management, not by local public officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Zinn |first=Howard |authorlink= |title=A People's History of the United States 1492-present |publisher=Harper Collins | year=1995 |location=New York |page=248 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P8V7J5qm5-YC&amp;dq=People's+History+of+the+United+States&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;q= |doi= |accessdate= 2009-10-05 |isbn =978-0-06-052842-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chicago was paralyzed when angry mobs of unemployed citizens wreaked havoc in the rail yards. The strike was eventually suppressed by thousands of vigilantes, National Guard, and federal troops.

===Haymarket affair of 1886===
{{main|Haymarket affair}}

In 1886 the [[Haymarket affair]] (also known as the Haymarket massacre or Haymarket riot) was a protest rally and subsequent violence on May 4 at the Haymarket Square&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofchicago.org/Landmarks/S/SiteHaymarket.html|title=COC - Landmarks web - Home|work=cityofchicago.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506053947/http://www.cityofchicago.org/Landmarks/S/SiteHaymarket.html|archivedate=2009-05-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Chicago]]. The rally supported [[Strike action|striking]] workers. When [[Chicago Police Department|police]] began to disperse the public meeting, an unknown person threw a dynamite [[bomb]] into their midst. The bomb blast and ensuing [[Shooting|gunfire]] resulted in the deaths of eight police officers, mostly from [[friendly fire]], and an unknown number of civilians.&lt;ref name=degan&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.odmp.org/officer/3972-patrolman-mathias-j.-degan |title=Patrolman Mathias J. Degan |accessdate=2008-12-31 |publisher=The Officer Down Memorial Page, Inc }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the internationally publicized legal proceedings that followed, eight [[anarchism|anarchists]] were tried for murder. Four men were convicted and executed, and one committed [[suicide]] in prison, although the prosecution conceded none of the defendants had thrown the bomb.

The Haymarket affair is generally considered significant for the origin of international [[May Day]] observances for workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Trachtenberg |first=Alexander |title=The History of May Day |origyear=1932 |url=http://www.marxists.org/subject/mayday/articles/tracht.html |accessdate=2008-01-19 |date=March 2002 |publisher=[[Marxists Internet Archive|Marxists.org]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Foner |first=Philip S. |authorlink=Philip Foner |title=May Day: A Short History of the International Workers' Holiday, 1886-1986 |year=1986 |publisher=International Publishers |location=New York |isbn=978-0-7178-0624-9 |pages=27–39 |chapter=The First May Day and the Haymarket Affair}}&lt;/ref&gt; The causes of the Haymarket Affair are still controversial, but can be traced in part to an incident the previous day, in which police fired into a crowd of agitated workers during shift change at the McCormick Works, where the regular work force was on strike, and at least two workers were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Avrich |title=The Haymarket Tragedy |page=190 |isbn=978-0-691-04711-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In popular literature, the Haymarket Affair inspired the caricature of "a bomb-throwing anarchist."

Illinois Governor [[John Peter Altgeld]] later pardoned the three living survivors of the Haymarket prosecution, concluding (as have subsequent scholars) that there had been a serious miscarriage of justice in their prosecutions.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Laurence Danver, Revolts, protests, demonstrations, and rebellions in American history: an encyclopedia, ABC-CLIO, 2010, page 575&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carlotta R. Anderson, All-American anarchist: Joseph A. Labadie and the labor movement, Wayne State University Press, 1998, page 123&lt;/ref&gt;

===Burlington strike of 1888===
During [[Burlington Railroad Strike of 1888|the 1888 strike]] against the [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad]], workers were arrested for wrecking a train.  When one of those arrested turned out to be a detective, organized labor complained that the detective had incited the others.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bernard Hogg, "Public Reaction to Pinkertonism and the Labor Question," Pennsylvania History 11 (July 1944), 171--199, page 175, citing Journal of United Labor, July 12, 1888.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labor unrest in 1892===
"In the 1890s violent outbreaks occurred in the North, South, and West, in small communities and metropolitan cities, testifying to the common attitudes of Americans in every part of the United States."&lt;ref name="commission1969"/&gt; Workers with different ethnic origins who worked under very different conditions in widely separated parts of the United States nonetheless responded with equal ferocity when unions came under attack.&lt;ref name="commission1969"/&gt; "Serious violence erupted in several major strikes of the 1890s, the question of union recognition being a factor in all of them."&lt;ref name="commission1969"/&gt;

1892 in particular was a year of considerable labor unrest. Governors of five states called out the national guard and/or the army to quell unrest—against miners in East [[Tennessee]] and in [[Coeur D'Alene, Idaho]], where a [[Coeur d'Alene, Idaho labor strike of 1892|shooting war followed the discovery]] of a [[Labor spies|labor spy]], against switchmen in [[Buffalo, New York]], against a [[general strike]] in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], and against the [[Homestead, Pennsylvania]] steel strike.&lt;ref name="documentary23"&gt;Emma Goldman, Candace Falk, Emma Goldman, Vol. 1: A Documentary History of the American Years, Volume 1: Made for America, 1890-1901, University of Illinois Press, 2008, page 23&lt;/ref&gt;

====Coeur d'Alene, Idaho labor strike====
{{main|Coeur d'Alene, Idaho labor strike of 1892}}

The strike of 1892 in [[Coeur d'Alene, Idaho]] erupted in violence when a union miner was killed by mine guards,&lt;ref name="commission1969"/&gt; and was further inflamed when [[labor union|union]] miners discovered they had been infiltrated by a [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|Pinkerton]] agent who had routinely provided union information to the mine owners.

On Sunday night, July 10, armed union miners gathered on the hills above the Frisco mine. More union miners were arriving from surrounding communities. At five in the morning, shots rang out, and the firing became continuous. Both sides blamed the other for starting the shooting. The union miners, exposed on the logged-off hillside, hadn't positioned themselves for a gunfight, while mine guards were able to shelter in buildings. The union men circled above the mill, and got into a position where they could send a box of [[black powder]] down the [[flume]] into one of the mine buildings. The building exploded, killing one company man and injuring several others. The union miners fired into a remaining structure where the guards had taken shelter. A second company man was killed, and sixty or so guards surrendered. Union men marched their prisoners to the union hall.

The violence caused the governor to declare Martial Law,&lt;ref name="Mark Wyman 1910, page 170"&gt;Mark Wyman, Hard Rock Epic, Western Miners and the Industrial Revolution, 1860-1910, 1979, page 170.&lt;/ref&gt; and bring in six companies of the [[Idaho National Guard]] to "suppress insurrection and violence." Federal troops also arrived, and they confined six hundred miners in [[Bullpen#Response to labor unrest .28United States.29|bullpens]] without any hearings or formal charges. Some were later "sent up" for violating injunctions, others for obstructing the United States mail.&lt;ref name="Labor's Greatest Conflicts 1908, page 13"&gt;Labor's Greatest Conflicts, Emma F. Langdon, 1908, page 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Homestead Strike, and an assassination attempt====
{{main|Homestead Strike}}

One of the most notorious incidents of violence against management occurred in 1892 during the [[Homestead Strike]]—one of the most violent industrial disputes in American history—when [[Alexander Berkman]] attempted to assassinate [[Henry Clay Frick]], chairman of the [[Carnegie Steel Company]] and manager of the mill where the strike occurred. Frick had locked out the workers, and later hired three hundred armed guards from the [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|Pinkerton Detective Agency]] to break the union's [[picketing (protest)|picket lines]], resulting in gunfire and flaming barges on the Ohio River. There was a consensus of all parties that the presence of the Pinkertons inflamed the attitudes of the strikers.&lt;ref name="commission1969"/&gt; The strikers defeated the Pinkertons, but could not keep the mills from operating after the National Guard was deployed.&lt;ref name="commission1969"/&gt;

Berkman, an avowed [[anarchist]], had no connection to the union involved in the strike, but believed he was acting in the workers' interests. He was motivated by newspaper reports of,

&lt;blockquote&gt;...Henry Clay Frick, whose attitude toward labor is implacably hostile; his secret military preparations while designedly prolonging the peace negotiations with the [[Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers|Amalgamated]]; the fortification of the Homestead steel-works; the erection of a high board fence, capped by barbed wire and provided with loopholes for sharpshooters; the hiring of an army of Pinkerton thugs; the attempt to smuggle them, in the dead of night, into Homestead; and, finally, the terrible carnage.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Berkman, Prison memoirs of an anarchist, Mother earth publishing association, 1912, pages 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Berkman's attack, called an [[Propaganda of the deed|attentat]] by the anarchists, injured but failed to kill Frick. Having anticipated that his act would launch a worker uprising, Berkman was surprised when a carpenter hit him with a hammer after he had been restrained. The attempted murder alienated the anarchist community from much of the labor movement, as well as dividing the anarchist community itself.&lt;ref name="documentary23"/&gt; Frick had been widely hated, but in at least one analysis, becoming the victim of such an attack transformed him into a "folk hero" in the public view.&lt;ref name="commission1969"/&gt;

During the Homestead strike, Carnegie Steel Company employees in Duquesne joined the strike that was occurring across the river. A riot broke out, and a number of the workers were arrested. It turned out that two of the strikers were Pinkerton detectives, and convictions were secured.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bernard Hogg, "Public Reaction to Pinkertonism and the Labor Question," Pennsylvania History 11 (July 1944), 171--199, citing Pittsburgh Commercial Gazette, July 24, 1892.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of Virden, 1898===
In 1897, the Pana Coal Company attempted to import African-American strikebreakers. A train car was intercepted by armed striking miners, and the strikebreakers were sent home unharmed.

The following year, however, another company, the Chicago-Virden Coal Company, attempted a similar strike-breaking effort, this time with an armed escort on the train car. The result was called the [[Battle of Virden]].  Guards fired their rifles as they disembarked from the train. In the ensuing gun battle, fourteen men, including eight strikers, were killed.&lt;ref name="commission1969"/&gt; [[John Riley Tanner|Governor Tanner]] criticized the company, and called up the National Guard, who were able to restore order. The National Guard prevented a similar incident by turning away additional strikebreakers the day after the riot.&lt;ref name="commission1969"/&gt;

===Coeur d'Alene, Idaho labor confrontation of 1899===
{{main|Coeur d'Alene, Idaho labor confrontation of 1899}}

In April 1899, as the [[Western Federation of Miners]] (WFM) was launching an organizing drive of the few locations not yet unionized, superintendent Albert Burch declared that the company would rather "shut down and remain closed twenty years" than to recognize the union. He then fired seventeen workers that he believed to be union members and demanded that all other union men collect their back pay and quit.&lt;ref&gt;J. Anthony Lukas, Big Trouble, 1997, page 111&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 29, 250 angry union members belonging to the WFM seized a train in [[Burke, Idaho|Burke]].&lt;ref&gt;schwantes, carlos (1996). ""The Pacific Northwest: An Interpretive history"". University of Nebraska Press. p.320&lt;/ref&gt; At each stop through [[Burke-Canyon]], more miners climbed aboard. At Frisco, the train stopped to load eighty wooden boxes, each containing fifty pounds of dynamite. Nearly a thousand men&lt;ref&gt;J. Anthony Lukas, Big Trouble, 1997, page 112.&lt;/ref&gt; rode the train to [[Wardner, Idaho|Wardner]], the site of a $250,000 mill of the [[Bunker Hill Mining Company|Bunker Hill mine]]. After carrying three thousand pounds of dynamite into the mill, they set their charges and scattered. Two men were killed,&lt;ref&gt;Roughneck—The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, 1983, pages 53-54.&lt;/ref&gt; one of them a non-union miner, the other a union man accidentally shot by other miners. Their mission accomplished, the miners once again boarded the "Dynamite Express" and left the scene.&lt;ref&gt;J. Anthony Lukas, Big Trouble, 1997, pages 113-114.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;From Kellog to Wallace, ranchers and laboring people lined the tracks and, according to one eyewitness, "cheered the [union] men lustily as they passed."&lt;ref&gt;J. Anthony Lukas, Big Trouble, 1997, page 114.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Once again, miners were rounded up and herded into [[bullpen]]s and held there for months.&lt;ref&gt;William D. Haywood, The Autobiography of Big Bill Haywood, 1929, page 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early 20th century==
===Colorado Labor Wars of 1903-04===
{{main|Colorado Labor Wars}}

During the [[Western Federation of Miners]] strike of 1903-04, there was considerable violence, including an explosion at the Vindicator mine which killed two, and an explosion at the Independence Depot which killed thirteen. The Cripple Creek Mining District was under occupation by the Colorado National Guard, the [[Citizens' Alliance]] was active in the district, and historians continue to debate who was responsible for each incident of violence.&lt;ref&gt;All That Glitters—Class, Conflict, and Community in Cripple Creek, Elizabeth Jameson, 1998, page 233&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Labor History of the Cripple Creek District, Benjamin McKie Rastall, 1905, pages 150,153&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Colorado's War on Militant Unionism, James H. Peabody and the Western Federation of Miners, George G. Suggs, Jr., 1972, pages 114,189&lt;/ref&gt; One likely perpetrator was convicted assassin [[Harry Orchard]]. A major in the National Guard later testified that the militia was responsible for orchestrated beatings of striking miners.&lt;ref name="freeland487"&gt;Louis Freeland Post, The Public, November 5, 1904, page 487&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Durango Democrat, "Startling Exposure, Member of State Militia Makes Affidavit As To Cause Of Disturbances in Cripple Creek", October 29, 1904&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Association of Bridge Structural Iron Workers, 1906-1911===
Perhaps the most significant example of a campaign of union violence, the [[International Association of Bridge, Structural, Ornamental and Reinforcing Iron Workers|International Association of Bridge Structural Iron Workers]] employed dynamite attacks and assault from 1906 to 1911 over employers' demands for an [[open shop]]. After an initial peace offer, employers refused to talk to the union, and the union leadership adopted violent tactics as a direct response. Approximately one hundred structures were damaged or destroyed by dynamite, and about a hundred non-union workers were assaulted. In the Chicago area alone, there were 12 dynamite attacks on non-union construction sites from 1906 to 1911, six of them taking place in 1910. The attacks on construction sites were aimed at property, not people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwlocal1.com/history/TheDynamiteCampaign.html The dynamite campaign] Bridge, Structural &amp; Reinforcing Iron Workers Local Union #1, accessed 8 Nov. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Nationwide, nearly 100 dynamite bombs had exploded at non-union iron workers construction sites from 1906 to 1911.&lt;ref&gt;http://historicindianapolis.com/indianapolis-collected-the-great-dynamite-conspiracy/&lt;/ref&gt;

The most powerful foe of labor unions in Los Angeles was [[Harrison Gray Otis (publisher)|Harrison Gray Otis]], publisher of the [[Los Angeles Times]]. On 1 October 1910, [[Los Angeles Times bombing|a dynamite bomb exploded at the Los Angeles Times building]]. The explosion and subsequent fire killed 21 Times workers, and injured 100 more. Ortie McManigal, one of the Iron Workers Union members who participated in the bombing, confessed.&lt;ref name="commission1969"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Michael Martinez, [https://books.google.com/books?id=RQG_AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA102&amp;lpg=PA102&amp;dq=ironworkers+los+angeles+times+bombing&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VTlmo7oqFR&amp;sig=qXnc72rgtU3t6ViKbKTrxDA-vMk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwADgoahUKEwiap7-swo3JAhXKMSYKHaZBDIY#v=onepage&amp;q=ironworkers%20los%20angeles%20times%20bombing&amp;f=false Terrorist Attacks on American Soil], (Rowman and Littlefield, 25 Oct. 2012) 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next day, a mysterious suitcase was found outside the home of Times publisher Otis; police moved the suitcase away from the building. When they opened it, they heard ticking, and ran. They were 60 feet away when the dynamite went off, creating a crater and rattling windows, but without injuring anyone. Another dynamite bomb was discovered and disarmed at the Los Angeles home of the president of the anti-union Merchants and Manufacturers Association.&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Farrell, [http://www.jafarrell.com/clarencedarrowexcerpt.htmlexploded.http://www.jafarrell.com/clarencedarrowexcerpt.html Clarence  Darrow: Attorney for the Damned (excerpt)].&lt;/ref&gt;

The southern California crew of Ortie McManigal and James B. Macnamara were still not through, and set off eight more explosions, including a Christmas Day 1910 explosion at the Llewellyn Iron Works in Los Angeles.

Police found bomb-making equipment, including dynamite, at the Ironworkers Union office in San Francisco, and at the union headquarters in Indianapolis. Ortie McManigal confessed and testified against the others. James B. Macnamara pled guilty to placing the Los Angeles Times bomb, and his brother John J. Macnamara, secretary-treasurer of the union, pled guilty to planning the bombing of the Llewellyn Iron Works. In all, 40 members of the Iron Workers Union were convicted in the dynamite campaign, including union president Frank Ryan.

As of 2016, the Ironworkers Union website on the history of the union commented:

&lt;blockquote&gt;McNamara, Ryan, Clancy, Butler, Morrin and the others may have done what they thought they had to do to preserve the International Association.  And despite other consequences of the dynamite campaign, they did save the Union.  The International Officers stretched the limits of zeal in a righteous cause.  Their strategy and tactics suffered - not the cause or validity of unionism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geocities.ws/ironworkers373/iwhistory4b.html A History of the Ironworkers Union, Part 2], website of the International Association of Bridge, Structural,

===Battle of Blair Mountain, 1921===
{{main|Battle of Blair Mountain}}

Two years of conflict between miners and mine owners, characterized by utilization of the [[Baldwin–Felts Detective Agency]] for [[Labor spies|infiltrating, sabotaging]] and [[Union busting|attacking the United Mine Workers union]], culminated in the Battle of Blair Mountain in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;George D. Torok, A guide to historic coal towns of the Big Sandy River Valley, Univ. of Tennessee Press, 2004, page 119&lt;/ref&gt; The largest armed insurrection since the [[American Civil War]] was touched off by the murders of [[Sid Hatfield]] and Ed Chambers on the courthouse steps of [[Welch, West Virginia]].&lt;ref name="mountain149"&gt;Chuck Kinder, Last Mountain Dancer: Hard-Earned Lessons in Love, Loss, and Honky-Tonk, Da Capo Press, 2005, page 149&lt;/ref&gt; The Battle of Blair Mountain was a spontaneous uprising of ten thousand [[coal miner]]s from throughout West Virginia who fought the coal company's hired guns and their allies, the state police for three days before federal troops intervened.&lt;ref name="mountain149"/&gt;

===The Herrin Massacre, 1922===
{{main|Herrin massacre}}

Williamson County, Illinois, a county with a "unique history of violence" for a rural county, was the location of the Herrin Massacre, one of the most horrific and perplexing incidents of union violence.&lt;ref name="williamson10"&gt;Harry Spiller, Sheriff: a memoir of a lawman from Bloody Williamson County, Illinois, Turner Publishing Company, 1999, page 10&lt;/ref&gt; The 1922 incident is considered the most notorious of the United Mine Workers' struggles in Illinois.&lt;ref name="williamson10"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stu Fliege, Tales and trails of Illinois, University of Illinois Press, 2002, page 180&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chicagoreader1"&gt;James Ballowe, The Work of Our Fathers, http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/the-work-of-our-fathers/Content?oid=887838 retrieved April 22, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The massacre was committed by members (and possibly at the instruction of local leadership) of the United Mine Workers.&lt;ref name="chicagoreader1"/&gt; Three union men died in the exchange of gunfire during an afternoon-long armed siege of a non-union mine. The next day, the non-union miners surrendered and were disarmed in exchange for safe passage out of the county. However, union miners killed 20 men of the 50 strikebreakers and mine guards who surrendered. The ruthless retaliation occurred against the backdrop of broken promises, double dealing, and missed opportunities on both sides.&lt;ref&gt;Illinois: A Descriptive and Historical Guide, US History Publishers, A.C. McClurg &amp; Company, Chicago, 1939, page 453&lt;/ref&gt;

== False flags and frameups ==
False flag operations are efforts to turn public opinion against an adversary, while pretending to be in the camp of that adversary. Historian [[J. Bernard Hogg]] observed of such operations as practiced in 1888:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A detective will join the ranks of the strikers and at once become an ardent champion of their cause. He is next found committing an aggravated assault upon some man or woman who has remained at work, thereby bringing down upon the heads of the officers and members of the assembly or union directly interested, the condemnation of all honest people, and aiding very materially to demoralize the organization and break their ranks.&lt;ref&gt;"Public Reaction to Pinkertonism and the Labor Question," J. Bernard Hogg, Pennsylvania History 11 (July 1944), 171--199, page 175, citing ''Journal of United Labor'', July 12, 1888. Hogg block-quotation contains a typo, interpretation is assumed as a single quote rendered as a comma.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some [[Labor spies|labor spy agencies]] advertised their false flag operations; for example, [[Corporations Auxiliary Company]], a labor spy agency which boasted 499 corporate clients in the early 1930s,&lt;ref&gt;John J. Abt, Michael Myerson, Advocate and activist: memoirs of an American communist lawyer, University of Illinois Press, 1993, page 63&lt;/ref&gt; told prospective clients,

&lt;blockquote&gt;In [the event other methods of sabotaging the union fail, our operative in the union] turns extremely radical. He asks for unreasonable things and keeps the union embroiled in trouble. If a strike comes, he will be the loudest man in the bunch, and will counsel violence and get somebody in trouble. The result will be that the union will be broken up.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Wellington Laidler, Boycotts and the labor struggle economic and legal aspects, John Lane company, 1913, pages 291-292&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Deputy Prosecutor in Indiana's Johnson County, Carlos Lam, suggested in an email that Wisconsin's Governor Walker mount a "[[false flag]]" operation to make it appear that the union was committing violence in the [[2011 Wisconsin protests]]. After initially claiming that his email account was hacked, Lam admitted to sending the suggestion and resigned.&lt;ref&gt;Debra Cassens Weiss, American Bar Association Journal, posted Mar 25, 2011, http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/a_second_indiana_prosecutor_is_out_of_a_job_for_unusual_advice_to_wisconsin/ retrieved April 2, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CBS News, posted March 25, 2011, {{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20047130-503544.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 23, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412225147/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20047130-503544.html |archivedate=April 12, 2012 }} retrieved April 2, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Governor Walker's office disclaimed support for the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Brian |last=Montopoli |title=Indiana prosecutor resigns for encouraging fake attack on Wisconsin governor |publisher=[[CBS News]] |date=March 25, 2011 |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20047130-503544.html |accessdate=April 23, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412225147/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20047130-503544.html |archivedate=April 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Colorado Labor Wars]], the Colorado National Guard had been called into the [[Cripple Creek, Colorado|Cripple Creek]] Mining District to put down a strike, and Colorado National Guard leadership became concerned that the [[Mine Owners Association]] had not lived up to their agreement to cover the payroll of the soldiers. In February 1904, General Reardon ordered Major Ellison to shoot up one of the mines.

During the same strike, detectives were accused of attempting to frame union leaders for a plot to derail a train.

Later the police revealed that the dynamite had been wrapped in a magazine addressed to the son of the former mayor. The man had received an unexplained payment from the largest of the employers. Exposed, the plot swung public sympathy to the union.&lt;ref&gt;

==Late 20th century==
===1979 Imperial Valley Lettuce Strike===
The [[United Farm Workers]] 1979 strike against Imperial Valley lettuce growers was organized by Cesar Chavez to dispute wages for produce workers. Despite his outspoken calls for peaceful protests and the UFW's policy of non-violence, several instances of widespread violence and damage occurred during the strike. "UFW pickets engaged in rock-throwing, blocking access to and from grower facilities or fields, rushing into fields towards replacement workers, throwing nail-type devices on the ground to cause flat tires in grower vehicles, overturning grower vehicles, carrying or using sticks, clubs, sling shots or other weapons.....There was evidence that the picket captains urged strikers to throw rocks and to vandalize grower equipment. There was evidence that King and the picket captains made threats to kill the replacement workers. There was evidence that the UFW could discipline picketers who violated strike rules by pulling them off the picket line and having them work elsewhere yet the evidence tended to show the UFW rarely disciplined picketers....There was testimony picket captains encouraged strikers to throw rocks and vandalize grower equipment. In particular, there was evidence of a "Fantasma" or "Phantom Crew" organized by the strikers to intimidate growers and replacement workers. This phantom crew was composed of five or six "real strong young men" who would use a black van at night to attack replacement workers and to vandalize irrigation equipment, vehicles and homes belonging to growers and replacement workers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/3d/227/847.html,"] ''Justia'', 15 February 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following years, a judge would later find the actions of the UFW were "acts of unlawful picketing" and held them financially liable for damages to the growers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1986-05-14/local/me-5351_1_ufw,"] ''LA Times'', 14 May 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1985 Massey Energy strike===
The [[United Mine Workers Union]] 1985 strike against Massey Energy included attacks on company vehicles with rifle fire. Trucks hauling coal from the mines were fired upon with rifles a number of times, and three drivers had previously been wounded by the rifle fire before June 1985, when another truck convoy was hit by rifle fire, killing driver Hayes West when his truck was hit by at least 21 rifle rounds, and the driver of another truck was wounded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,959201,00.html "Labor: war in the coalfields,"] ''Time'', 17 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

State and local law enforcement did not charge anyone in the death of Hayes West. Five members of the United Mine Workers Union, including Donnie Thornsbury, president of UMW Local 2496, were indicted by a federal grand jury, arrested, and charged with conspiracy to damage and disable motor vehicles used in interstate commerce.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1987/Five-Suspects-in-1985-Sniper-Slaying-Arrested/id-d35f2ff3ee9930c23af17c21ef64aafd "Five suspects in 1985 sniper slaying arrested"], Associated Press, 7 Aug. 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; After a trial in federal court, four out of the five were convicted, including union official Thornsbury, and their convictions were upheld on appeal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/972/349/177628/ ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1989-01-07/news/8901070449_1_thornsbury-sentences-convictions "Federal Appeals Court on Friday"], Orlando (Fla.)

===1986/1987, Hotel Workers Strike===
Three union workers [[Dupont Plaza Hotel arson|set fire to the Hotel Dupont Plaza]] in San Juan, Puerto Rico, while other union members staged a fight as a distraction. The union, said to be affiliated with the Teamsters, was having a labor dispute with management over pay and health care. Ninety-seven people were killed, none of whom were union members. Most bodies were burned beyond recognition.

===1989 Pittston coal strike===
The 1989 strike by the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) against the Pittston Coal Company's mines in Virginia and West Virginia was marked by shots fired at strikebreakers. In July 1989, a car bomb exploded in the parking lot of Pittston headquarters at [[Lebanon, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1989-07-14/business/fi-3977_1_car-bomb "Car Bomb, Gunfire Mark Coal Unrest"], Los Angeles Times, 14 July 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990, New York Daily News Strike===
On the first day of The ''[[New York Daily News]]'' strike, delivery trucks were attacked with stones and sticks, and in some cases burned, with the drivers beaten.&lt;ref name="TheWall" /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TheNew" /&gt; Strikers then started threatening newsstands with arson, or stole all copies of the Daily News and burned them in front of the newsstands.&lt;ref name="TheWall" /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TheNew" /&gt; James Hoge, publisher of the ''Daily News'', alleged that there had been some 700 serious acts of violence. The New York Police Department claimed knowledge of  229 incidents of violence. Criminal charges under the Hobbs Act were declined, however, citing the aforementioned ''Enmons'' case.&lt;ref name="TheWall" /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TheNew" /&gt;

===1993 Arch Mineral Corporation strike===
Eight members of the striking United Mine Workers Union were arrested after Eddie York was shot and killed in Logan County, West Virginia, as he drove away from the coal mine, through the picket line. York, an employee of an environmental contractor, was at the mine to perform government-mandated maintenance of sedimentation ponds, work unrelated to the labor dispute. In the same incident, a truck driven by a mine guard was struck by rocks thrown by strikers on the picket line, which smashed the windshield. Howard Green, a member of the UMW executive board, accused Arch Corporation mine guards of murdering York, to give bad publicity to the union.&lt;ref name="Randy Fitzgerald 1995, p.65-69"&gt;Randy Fitzgerald, "Murder in Logan County," ''Reader's Digest'', Feb. 1995, v.146 n.2 p.65-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

State and local law enforcement did not charge anyone in York's death.

The eighth, Jerry Dale Lowe, was charged with firing the fatal shot, and was tried in federal court for illegal use of a firearm to incapacitate a driver involved in interstate commerce (the federal government could not charge him with murder, because murder is not a federal crime).&lt;ref&gt;Martha Bryson Hodel, [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1696&amp;dat=19940623&amp;id=DfsaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3UcEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4665,2457048&amp;hl=en "Jury deliberates miner's fate"], Bowling Green (Ky.)

===1997, Teamsters Union strike against UPS===
In Miami, during a 1997 Teamsters Union strike against UPS, a group of men pulled UPS truck driver Rod Carter out of his truck, beat him, and stabbed him six times with an ice pick.

===Laborers Local 91, Niagara, New York, 1995-2001===
For years, officials of Laborers Local 91, in Niagara, New York, directed a strongarm squad&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.niagarafallsreporter.com/editorial260.html Editorial:] ''Niagara Falls Reporter, 29 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; of union members to make death threats and to commit criminal acts against nonunion construction workers and work sites. In 1997, the union fire-bombed a residence used by non-union workers in Niagara Falls, New York, causing permanent injury to one of the inhabitants. In 1998, union members attacked four tile-layers at a supermarket construction site, beating them so badly that they were all hospitalized, one so badly that he had not returned to work four years later.

State and local law enforcement did not charge anyone in the beatings. After a four-year federal investigation, the FBI arrested 14 union members for the violence, including the local's vice president, business manager, assistant business manager, and a former president. Andrew Shomers confessed to the fire-bombing, and also to the beatings at the supermarket site.

===Ironworkers Local 401, Philadelphia, 2013===
Although the violence, property destruction and arson had been going on for years, it intensified after the economic downturn of 2008-2009, as construction work became scarcer. In 2012, Ironworkers union members caused $500,000 in damage to the non-union construction site of a Quaker meetinghouse in Chestnut Hill.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/18/us/philadelphia-vandalism-seen-by-some-as-union-intimidation.html?_r=1 "Philadelphia vandalism seen by some as union intimidation,"] ''New York Times'', 18 Jan. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In another incident, Ironworkers beat nonunion workers outside a Toys-R-Us store with baseball bats.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.philly.com/2015-07-17/news/64499119_1_ironworkers-local-401-union-ironworkers-nonunion-construction-sites }.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the violence was directed at union construction sites staffed by other craft unions, such as the Carpenters Union, in an attempt to get the work for the Ironworkers.

The Authority charged that the union had engaged in a pattern of "illegal and disruptive mass picketing and protests; physical intimidation, harassment, stalking, and assault and battery; verbal intimidation, harassment, race-baiting, and threats; and the destruction of property." The Carpenters Union denied the charges.

==Union-on-union violence==
Sometimes, unions are accused of violence or threats of violence by other unions.

===Railroad Trainmen versus Street Railway Employees, 1940===
In June 1940, a bus driver member of the Amalgamated Association of Street Railway &amp; Motor Coach Employees, which was not on strike, was killed at the hands of members of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, which claimed to represent the bus drivers. The Railroad Trainmen blamed the bus driver, calling him a strikebreaker. The Street Railway &amp; Motor Coach Employees union later won an NLRB representation election, defeating the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen.&lt;ref name=Taft-Ross&gt;{{cite book|title="American labor violence: its causes, character, and outcome," in Hugh Davis Graham and Ted Robert Gurr (eds.), Violence in America | first=Philip, and Philip Ross|last= Taft| publisher=Bantam|location =New York, USA|date= June 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;364

===United Mine Workers versus Progressive Mine Workers, 1941===
In 1932, some southern Illinois coal miners dissatisfied with the concessions made by the United Mine Workers Union, and what they regarded as the autocratic ways of its leader, [[John L. Lewis]], broke away and formed the Progressive Miners of America (PMA), later renamed the [[Progressive Mine Workers of America]]. The rival unions clashed violently from the start, resulting in numerous deaths on both sides, as well as police officers killed trying to prevent the violence.

The violence was especially intense in southern Illinois in 1932 and 1933, when PMA picketers tried to stop UMWA members from entering the mines. Officers and members of both unions were shot on the street and bombed in their homes. In addition, PMA members set off bombs to stop rail shipments of UMWA-mined coal, trying to force the companies to recognize the PMA. In 1937 the federal government charged 36 PMA members and officers with racketeering, in connection with 44 dynamite explosions at mines and rail facilities. The PMA maintained that the charges resulted from collusion between the FBI, UMWA, and Peabody Coal, and that their methods were no different from those of the UMWA. All 36 were convicted. Although the prison sentences were no more than 16 months, the fines and legal expenses had drained the PMA treasury, and the verdicts labelled the PMA as an outlaw organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sangamoncountyhistory.org/wp/?p=3316 Coal miner union war], Sangamon County History, 26 Nov. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Progressive Mine Workers union survived, and PMWA-UMWA violence flared up occasionally over the years, as one union would strike while the other continued to work, and they both claimed to represent miners at various coal mines. In 1946, two miners died in clashes between the rival unions at a mine at Benham, Kentucky, which was represented by the Progressive Mine Workers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=861&amp;dat=19460507&amp;id=y98oAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=JoUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5400,6051059&amp;hl=en "2 killed in Kentucky gun battle,"] Victoria (Tex.) ''Advocate'', 7 May 1946, p.1 c.5.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, the Progressive Mine Workers of America represented 4,500 coal miners, compared to the UMWA's membership of 160,000 The union dissolved in 1999.

== Legal status ==
In the United States, union violence often goes unpunished because of pro-union sympathies, or political pressure not to prosecute.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Roebuck, [http://articles.philly.com/2014-02-25/news/47639621_1_chestnut-hill-quaker-federal-authorities-meetinghouse Philly labor violence rarely punished], Philadelphia ''Inquirer'', 14 feb. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; A 1966 study cited numerous examples of local and state police failing to interfere with, and state and local prosecutors failing to prosecute, union violence. The authors concluded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A public official sees many votes on the picket line; few in the office. Perhaps in 1932 it was true that local officials were ignorant of union objectives and brutal in the extreme toward peaceful picketers. Nothing could be further from the truth in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Frank H. Stewart and Robert J. Townsend, "Strike violence: the need for federal injunctions," University of Pennsylvania Law Review,  Feb. 1966, v.114 n.4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although replacement workers have the legal right to be free from violence or intimidation in labor disputes, many law enforcement officials will not interfere with union intimidation, for fear of being accused of being anti-union. When Democratic governor of Arizona Bruce Babbitt sent the national guard to prevent threatened violence by strikers in the Phelps Dodge copper strike of 1982, a union official charged that he was "in the pocket" of Phelps Dodge.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph M. Baily, [http://www.mininghistoryassociation.org/Journal/MHJ-v3-1996-Bailey.pdf “Keeping people from being killed”], Mining History Association Journal, 1996, v.3 p.8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal exceptions for labor unions===
The US Chamber of Commerce has pointed out that a number of states have made legal exceptions for labor disputes in their criminal laws. For example, California, Pennsylvania, Nevada, and Illinois have exempted labor disputes from their laws against stalking.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.uschamber.com/sites/default/files/documents/files/1208_StateLawReview_R2.pdf. Sabotage, stalking &amp; stealth exemptions: special state laws for labor unions], US Chamber of Commerce, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hobbs act makes extortion a federal crime, but under the [[United States Supreme Court]]'s 1973 Enmons decision ([[United States v. Enmons]]), the actions of union officials in organizing strikes and other united acts of workers are exempt from Hobbs Act prosecutions, as long as the labor dispute is over pay for work performed. This exemption does not confer any immunity from state prosecution for violent acts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-2403-hobbs-act-extortion-force-violence-or-fear Hobbs Act], US Department of Justice, accessed 12 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

No American labor union currently has a policy of openly advocating violence, and some, such as the United Mine Workers in the Pittston Coal strike, have publicly emphasized peaceful means; the UMWA has striking members watch videos about the union's rules to assure peaceful picketing.&lt;ref name="Randy Fitzgerald 1995, p.65-69"/&gt; Labor unions have an incentive to keep strikes, and especially picket lines, peaceful, because if an activity organized and supervised by union officials such as picketing, becomes violent, the union itself may be found liable, in addition to the individuals.

===Public sympathies===
Some union sympathizers believe that labor union violence is justified, especially when directed at strikebreakers. Some hold that the law allowing and protecting strikebreakers is unfair, so that violence and intimidation are the only ways labor unionists can stage an effective strike.&lt;ref&gt;The crime of staging an effective strike.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Waldo L. Cook, [https://books.google.com/books?id=HMNaAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA337&amp;lpg=PA337&amp;dq=labor+union+violence+justification&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fEmqwNVHSj&amp;sig=7qnMiSQ8_QaOXi7XWsHpEcoqFCY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwA2oVChMIh6D4u8CDyQIVEOhjCh0SPA_t#v=onepage&amp;q=labor%20union%20violence%20justification&amp;f=false "Wars and labor wars,"] ''International Journal of Ethics'', 1907-1908.&lt;/ref&gt; Others believe that, although violence is wrong, it should be tolerated as an excess done for the greater good. [[Clarence Darrow]] voiced this view in his courtroom defense of labor leader [[Big Bill Haywood]], charged with ordering the assassination of the governor of Idaho:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I don't care how many wrongs they committed, I don't care how many crimes these weak, rough, rugged, unlettered men who often know no other power but the brute force of their strong right arm, who find themselves bound and confined and impaired whichever way they turn, who look up and worship the god of might as the only god that they know--I don't care how often they fail, how many brutalities they are guilty of. I know their cause is just.&lt;ref&gt;D. O. Linder, [http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/haywood/HAY_ACCT.HTM The trial of Big Bill Haywood], University of Missouri, Kansas City, School of Law, accessed 8 Nov. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Law enforcement sympathies===
Examples of local government inaction before or after union violence include the [[Herrin Massacre]], where the county sheriff was a member of the United Mine Workers, and did nothing to prevent or stop the killing of 21 nonstriking workers, after the strikebreakers had given up their weapons on a promise of safe passage out of the county.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailyregister.com/article/20120622/NEWS/306229950 "Herrin Massacre still stands out 90 years later,"] Harrisburg (Penn.) ''Daily Register'', 22 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wieck"&gt;{{cite book|first=David Thoreau|last=Wieck|title=Woman from Spillertown: a memoir of Agnes Burns Wieck|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|year=1992|pages=82–84|isbn=978-0809316199}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Federal Writers' Project|title=Illinois: A Descriptive and Historical Guide|publisher=A.C. McClurg &amp; Company|location=Chicago|year=1939|page=453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a nationwide Teamsters Union strike against UPS in 1987, the president of the Houston policeman's union faxed a message to all Houston police stations, urging them to stop UPS drivers, and "go into zero tolerance mode, to get the nonstriking drivers off the street.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/08/us/a-union-is-criticized-for-a-message-of-solidarity.html "A union is criticized for a Message of solidarity"], ''New York Times''. 8 August 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political support===
On 12 October 1898, at Virden, Illinois, a crowd of strikers armed with rifles tried to prevent a railroad car of strikebreakers from disembarking, and 8 strikers and 6 strikebreakers died in the gunfight. governor Tanner of Illinois ordered in the National Guard, and on his orders, the following day the Guard prevented the companies from bringing in more strikebreakers. Unable to continue operating, the companies gave in.&lt;ref&gt;Violence in America, p.301-302.&lt;/ref&gt; The governor admitted that he had no legal authority for his action in preventing the arrival of strikebreakers, but said that he was doing the will of the people.&lt;ref&gt;Paul D. Moreno, [https://books.google.com/books?id=URDl2NuzZzAC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;lpg=PA61&amp;dq=virden+illinois+strike+legality+governor&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sAchO2a7Uh&amp;sig=e2zVazYroLVBhXrzc67V-oN3r78&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi7lJjhnI3MAhUC5GMKHZTtBYo4ChDoAQhHMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=virden%20illinois%20strike%20legality%20governor&amp;f=false Blacks and Organized Labor: a New History], (Baton Rouge: LSU Press, 2008) 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Employer reluctance to press charges===
When local, state, or federal officials try to prosecute union violence, they sometimes find that employers are reluctant to cooperate, for fear of union repraisal.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Oreskes, [https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/27/nyregion/construction-corruption-inquiry-hampered-fears-retaliation-tainted-industry.html?pagewanted=all "Construction corruption inquiry hampered by fears of retaliation in tainted industry,"] ''New York Times'', 27 April 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Universal Orbital Support System.png|thumb|220x220px|Example of a possible layout using the Universal Orbital Support System.]]

==Explanation==

===Background===
A concept for providing space-based support to things suspended above an [[astronomical object]]. It is envisioned as a type of non-rotating [[tethered satellite system]]. The orbital system is a coupled mass system wherein the upper supporting mass (A) is placed in an orbit around a given celestial body such that it can support a suspended mass (B) at a specific height above the surface of the celestial body, but lower than (A). The relationship between (A) and (B) is such that it (A) moves higher as (B) is lowered towards the surface, the distance is related as an inverse proportion of their masses.

=== Practical examples ===
This system has been proposed for the [[Analemma]] Tower &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2017/0329/A-20-mile-long-spacescraper-dangling-from-an-asteroid-Could-it-work|title=A 20-mile long 'spacescraper' dangling from an asteroid: Could it work?|last=Wood|first=Charlie|date=March 29, 2017|website=www.csmonitor.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; concept, which employs the system to suspend a building from a cable supported by an [[asteroid]] orbiting earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Clouds AO|title=Analemma Tower - Clouds AO|date=2017-04-03|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVwvdcJ8yHo&amp;feature=youtu.be|accessdate=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nowa Huta jako idealne socjalistyczne miasto.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Nowa Huta]] in [[Kraków]], [[Poland]], serves as an unfinished example of a Utopian [[ideal city]].]]

A '''utopia''' ({{IPAc-en|j|uː|ˈ|t|oʊ|p|i|ə}} {{respell|yoo|TOH|pee|ə}}) is an imagined [[community]] or [[society]] that possesses highly desirable or nearly perfect qualities for its citizens.&lt;ref name="Giroux, H. 2003. pp. 91-105"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Giroux |first=Henry A. |authorlink=Henry  Giroux |date=2003 |title=Utopian thinking under the sign of neoliberalism: Towards a critical pedagogy of educated hope |url=https://uniteyouthdublin.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/giroux-utopian-thinking-under-the-sign-of-neoliberalism-towards-a-critical-pedagogy-of-e.pdf |journal=[[Democracy &amp; Nature]] |publisher=[[Routledge]] |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=91–105 |doi=10.1080/1085566032000074968}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"&gt;Simandan, D., 2011. Kinds of environments—a framework for reflecting on the possible contours of a better world. The Canadian Geographer/Le Géographe canadien, 55(3), pp.383-386. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1541-0064.2010.00334.x/full&lt;/ref&gt; The opposite of a utopia is a [[dystopia]]. One could also say that utopia is a perfect "place" that has been designed so there are no problems.

Utopia focuses on equality in [[economics]], [[government]] and [[justice]], though by no means exclusively, with the method and structure of proposed implementation varying based on ideology.&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Giroux, H. 2003. pp.91-105"&gt;Giroux, H., 2003. Utopian thinking under the sign of neoliberalism: Towards a critical pedagogy of educated hope. Democracy &amp; Nature, 9(1), pp.91-105.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lyman Tower Sargent "there are socialist, capitalist, monarchical, democratic, anarchist, ecological, feminist, patriarchal, egalitarian, hierarchical, racist, left-wing, right-wing, reformist, [[Naturism|Naturists]]/[[Naturist Christians|Nude Christians]], free love, nuclear family, extended family, gay, lesbian, and many more utopias [...] Utopianism, some argue, is essential for the improvement of the human condition. But if used wrongly, it becomes dangerous. Utopia has an inherent contradictory nature here."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lyman Tower Sargent|title=Utopianism: A Very Short Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xgA69UImZu8C&amp;pg=PA21 |date=23 September 2010 |publisher=OUP Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-957340-0 |pages=21 |doi=10.1093/actrade/9780199573400.003.0002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sargent argues that utopia's nature is inherently contradictory, because societies are not homogenous, and have desires which conflict and therefore cannot simultaneously be satisfied.  If any two desires cannot be simultaneously satisfied, true utopia cannot be attained because in utopia all desires are satisfied.

The term ''[[Wiktionary:utopia|utopia]]'' was coined from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] by [[Sir Thomas More]] for his 1516 book ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'', describing a [[fictional island]] society in the south [[Atlantic Ocean]] off the coast of [[South America]].

The word comes from {{lang-el|οὐ}} ("not") and τόπος ("place") and means "no-place", and strictly describes any non-existent society 'described in considerable detail'. However, in standard usage, the word's meaning has [[semantic change|narrowed]] and now usually describes a non-existent society that is intended to be viewed as considerably better than contemporary society.&lt;ref name="Thinking Utopia"&gt;{{cite report|periodical=Thinking Utopia: Steps Into Other Worlds|pages=11|first=Sargent|last=Lyman Tower|title=The Necessity of Utopian Thinking: A Cross-National Perspective|editor1-last=Rüsen|editor1-first=Jörn |editor2-last=Fehr|editor2-first=Michael|editor3-last=Reiger|editor3-first=Thomas W.|year=2005|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=9781571814401|location=New York, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Eutopia'', derived from Greek εὖ ("good" or "well") and τόπος ("place"), means "good place", and is strictly speaking the correct term to describe a positive utopia. In [[English language|English]], ''eutopia'' and ''utopia'' are homophonous, which may have given rise to the change in meaning.&lt;ref name="Thinking Utopia"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Utopian Reality: Reconstructing Culture in Revolutionary Russia and Beyond|last=Lodder|first=C.|last2=Kokkori|first2=M|last3=Mileeva|first3=M|pages=1–9|isbn=9789004263208|publisher=Koninklijke Brill NV|location=Leiden, The Netherlands|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hieronymus Bosch - The Garden of Earthly Delights - The Earthly Paradise (Garden of Eden).jpg|thumbnail|right|200px|Left panel (The Earthly Paradise – [[Garden of Eden]]) from [[Hieronymus Bosch]]'s ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]''.]]
Chronologically, the first recorded Utopian proposal is [[Plato]]'s ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;More, Travis; Rohith Vinod
(1989)&lt;/ref&gt; Part conversation, part fictional depiction, and part policy proposal, ''Republic'' would categorize citizens into a rigid class structure of "golden," "silver," "bronze" and "iron" socioeconomic classes. The golden citizens are trained in a rigorous 50-year-long educational program to be benign oligarchs, the "philosopher-kings."  Plato stressed this structure many times in statements, and in his published works, such as the ''Republic''.  The wisdom of these rulers will supposedly eliminate poverty and deprivation through fairly distributed resources, though the details on how to do this are unclear.  The educational program for the rulers is the central notion of the proposal.  It has few laws, no [[lawyer]]s and rarely sends its citizens to war, but hires [[mercenary|mercenaries]] from among its war-prone neighbors.  These mercenaries were deliberately sent into dangerous situations in the hope that the more warlike populations of all surrounding countries will be weeded out, leaving peaceful peoples.

During the 16th century, Thomas More's book ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'' proposed an ideal society of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/learning/timeline/item126618.html|title=Thomas More's Utopia|website=www.bl.uk|accessdate=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Readers, including Utopian socialists, have chosen to accept this imaginary society as the realistic blueprint for a working nation, while others have postulated that Thomas More intended nothing of the sort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.utopiaanddystopia.com/utopia/utopian-socialism/|title=Utopian Socialism - The Utopian Socialism Movement |website=www.utopiaanddystopia.com |accessdate=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that More's ''Utopia'' functions only on the level of a satire, a work intended to reveal more about the [[England]] of his time than about an idealistic society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dalley |first=Jan |url=https://www.ft.com/content/73b9bed6-a7ea-11e5-955c-1e1d6de94879 |title=Openings: Going back to Utopia |work=[[Financial Times]] |date=30 December 2015 |accessdate=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation is bolstered by the title of the book and nation, and its apparent confusion between the Greek for "no place" and "good place": "utopia" is a compound of the syllable ou-, meaning "no", and topos, meaning place. But the [[Homophone|homophonic]] prefix eu-, meaning "good," also resonates in the word, with the implication that the perfectly "good place" is really "no place."

===Ecological===
Ecological utopian society describes new ways in which society should relate to nature.
These works [[ecotopia|perceive]] a widening gap between the modern Western way of living that destroys nature&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, Andrew G. (2007). ''Counterculture green: the Whole earth catalog and American environmentalism''. University Press of Kansas. p. 86. {{ISBN|978-0-7006-1545-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and a more traditional way of living before industrialization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ecotopia 2121: A Vision of our Future Green Utopia|last=For example, see: Marshall|first=Alan|publisher=Arcade Publishers|year=2016|isbn=9781628726145|location=New York, N.Y.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecological utopias may advocate a society that is more sustainable. According to the Dutch philosopher Marius de Geus, ecological utopias could be inspirational sources for movements involving [[green politics]].&lt;ref&gt;Geus, Marius de (1996). Ecologische utopieën- Ecotopia's en het milieudebat. Uitgeverij Jan van Arkel.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economics===
Particularly in the early 19th century, several utopian ideas arose, often in response to the belief that social disruption was created and caused by the development of [[commercialism]] and [[capitalism]]. These ideas are often grouped in a greater "[[utopian socialism|utopian socialist]]" movement, due to their shared characteristics.  A once common characteristic is an [[egalitarian]] distribution of goods, frequently with the total abolition of [[money]]. Citizens only do [[labour (economics)|work]] which they enjoy and which is for the [[common good]], leaving them with ample time for the cultivation of the arts and sciences. One classic example of such a utopia was [[Edward Bellamy]]'s ''[[Looking Backward]]''. Another socialist utopia is [[William Morris]]'s ''[[News from Nowhere]]'', written partially in response to the top-down ([[bureaucratic]]) nature of Bellamy's utopia, which Morris criticized. However, as the socialist movement developed, it moved away from utopianism; [[Marx]] in particular became a harsh critic of earlier socialism he described as utopian. (For more information, see the [[History of Socialism]] article.) In a materialist utopian society, the economy is perfect; there is no inflation, and only perfect social and financial equality exists.

In 1905, [[H.G. Wells]] published ''[[A Modern Utopia]]'', which was widely read and admired and provoked much discussion. Also consider [[Eric Frank Russell]]'s book ''[[The Great Explosion]]'' (1963) whose last section details an economic and social utopia. This forms the first mention of the idea of [[Local Exchange Trading Systems]] (LETS).

During the "[[Khrushchev Thaw]]" period,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/the-Thaw-Soviet-cultural-history|title=the Thaw - Soviet cultural history|publisher=|accessdate=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Soviet writer [[Ivan Yefremov|Ivan Efremov]] produced the science-fiction utopia ''[[Andromeda (novel)|Andromeda]]'' (1957) in which a major cultural thaw took place: humanity communicates with a galaxy-wide Great Circle and develops its technology and culture within a social framework characterized by vigorous competition between alternative philosophies.

The English political philosopher [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]], author of the utopian work [[The Commonwealth of Oceana]], published in 1656, inspired English [[Country Party (Britain)|country party]] republicanism and was influential in the design of three American colonies. His theories ultimately contributed to the idealistic principles of the American Founders. The colonies of [[Province of Carolina|Carolina]] (founded in 1670), [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]] (founded in 1681), and [[Province of Georgia|Georgia]] (founded in 1733) were the only three English colonies in America that were planned as utopian societies with an integrated physical, economic, and social design. At the heart of the plan for Georgia was a concept of “agrarian equality” in which land was allocated equally and additional land acquisition through purchase or inheritance was prohibited; the plan was an early step toward the yeoman republic later envisioned by Thomas Jefferson.&lt;ref&gt;Fries, Sylvia, ''The Urban Idea in Colonial America'', Chapters 3 and 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Home, Robert, ''Of Planting and Planning: The Making of British Colonial Cities'', 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Thomas, ''The Oglethorpe Plan'', Chapters 1 and 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The communes of the 1960s in the United States were often an attempt to greatly improve the way humans live together in communities. The back-to-the-land movements and hippies inspired many to try to live in peace and harmony on farms, remote areas, and to set up new types of governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brbl-archive.library.yale.edu/exhibitions/utopia/uc22.html|title=America and the Utopian Dream - Utopian Communities|website=brbl-archive.library.yale.edu|accessdate=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communes like [[Kaliflower Commune|Kaliflower]], which existed between 1967 and 1973, attempted to live outside of society's norms and create their own ideal communist based society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://secure.pmpress.org/index.php?l=product_detail&amp;p=432|title=For All the People: Uncovering the Hidden History of Cooperation, Cooperative Movements, and Communalism in America, 2nd Edition|website=secure.pmpress.org|access-date=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Intentional communities]] were organized and built all over the world with the hope of making a more perfect way of living together. While many of these new small communities failed, some are growing, such as the [[Twelve Tribes Communities]] that started in the United States. Since its start, it has now grown into many groups around the world.

===Religious utopias===
[[File:New Harmony by F. Bate (View of a Community, as proposed by Robert Owen) printed 1838.jpg|300px|right|thumb|[[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony]], a Utopian attempt; depicted as proposed by [[Robert Owen]].]]

==== Inter-religious utopias ====
The inter-religious utopia is similar to a form of [[multiculturalism]] where real-world cultures have successfully worked together to create a wider society based on shared values. A transparent ideology of God and religion in an inter-religious utopia is how many people envision [[God]] manifesting within such a community.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} In more extended theories, the formula goes up to the next level, with different [[religious leader]]s setting aside their differences and accepting harmony, peace and understanding to unite all [[religion]]s with one another.  Other inter-religious utopias may go even further by describing a religion where humans become God or merge with a primal force that reigned before the birth of the [[universe]]. Religion and God could be used as self-motivating factors for people to believe in and to raise themselves out of difficult situations.

==== Intra-religious utopias ====
In the United States and Europe, during the [[Second Great Awakening]] (ca. 1790–1840) and thereafter, many radical religious groups formed utopian societies in which [[faith]] could govern all aspects of members' lives. These utopian societies included the [[Shakers]], who originated in England in the 18th century and arrived in America in 1774. A number of religious utopian societies from Europe came to the United States from the 18th century throughout the 19th century, including the Society of the Woman in the Wilderness (led by [[Johannes Kelpius]] (1667–1708)), the [[Ephrata Cloister]] (established in 1732), and the [[Harmony Society]], among others.  The [[Harmony Society]] was a [[Christian theosophy]] and [[Pietism|pietist]] group founded in [[Iptingen]], [[Germany]], in 1785. Due to religious persecution by the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran Church]] and the government in [[Württemberg]],&lt;ref name="Sutton1"&gt;Robert Paul Sutton, ''Communal Utopias and the American Experience: Religious Communities'' (2003) p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; the society moved to the United States on October 7, 1803, settled in [[Pennsylvania]].  On February 15, 1805, about 400 followers formally organized the Harmony Society, placing all their goods in common. The group lasted until 1905, making it one of the longest-running financially successful communes in American history. The [[Oneida Community]], founded by [[John Humphrey Noyes]] in [[Oneida, New York]], was a utopian religious [[commune]] that lasted from 1848 to 1881. Although this utopian experiment has become better known today for its manufacture of Oneida silverware, it was one of the longest-running communes in American history. The [[Amana Colonies]] were communal settlements in [[Iowa]], started by radical German [[pietists]], which lasted from 1855 to 1932. The [[Amana Corporation]], manufacturer of refrigerators and household appliances, was originally started by the group. Other examples are [[Fountain Grove, California|Fountain Grove]] (founded in 1875), Riker's Holy City and other Californian utopian colonies between 1855 and 1955 (Hine), as well as Sointula&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Finnish Utopian Settlements in North America | author = Teuvo Peltoniemi | url = http://www.sosiomedia.fi/utopia/na_settlements.pdf | publisher = sosiomedia.fi | year = 1984 | accessdate = 2008-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[British Columbia]], Canada. The [[Amish]] and [[Hutterites]] can also be considered an attempt towards religious utopia.

The [[Book of Revelation]] in the Christian [[Bible]] depicts an [[Christian eschatology|eschatological]] time with the defeat of [[Satan]] and of evil.

===Science and technology===
[[File:Early flight 02561u (2).jpg|thumb|Utopian flying machines, France, 1890-1900 (chromolithograph [[trading card]]).]]

Though [[Francis Bacon]]'s ''New Atlantis'' is imbued with a scientific spirit, scientific and technological utopias tend to be based in the future, when it is believed that advanced [[science]] and [[technology]] will allow utopian [[living standards]]; for example, the absence of [[death]] and [[suffering]]; changes in [[human nature]] and the [[human condition]]. Technology has affected the way humans have lived to such an extent that normal functions, like sleep, eating or even reproduction, have been replaced by artificial means. Other examples include a society where humans have struck a balance with technology and it is merely used to enhance the human living condition (e.g. ''[[Star Trek]]''). In place of the static perfection of a utopia, [[libertarian transhumanist]]s envision an "[[extropianism|extropia]]", an open, evolving society allowing individuals and voluntary groupings to form the institutions and social forms they prefer.

[[Mariah Utsawa]] presented a theoretical basis for [[technological utopianism]] and set out to develop a variety of technologies ranging from maps to designs for cars and houses which might lead to the development of such a utopia.

One notable example of a technological and [[libertarian socialist]] utopia is Scottish author [[Iain Banks]]' [[The Culture|Culture]].

Opposing this [[optimism]] is the prediction that advanced science and technology will, through deliberate misuse or accident, cause environmental damage or even humanity's [[extinction]]. Critics, such as [[Jacques Ellul]] and [[Timothy Mitchell]] advocate [[precautionary principle|precautions]] against the premature embrace of new technologies.  Both raise questions about changing responsibility and freedom brought by [[division of labour]]. Authors such as [[John Zerzan]] and [[Derrick Jensen]] consider that modern technology is progressively depriving humans of their autonomy, and advocate the collapse of the industrial civilization, in favor of small-scale organization, as a necessary path to avoid the threat of technology on human freedom and [[sustainability]].

There are many examples of techno-dystopias portrayed in mainstream culture, such as the classics ''[[Brave New World]]'' and ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]],'' often published as "1984", which have explored some of these topics.

===Feminism===
Utopias have been used to explore the ramifications of genders being either a societal construct, or a biologically "hard-wired" imperative, or some mix of the two.&lt;ref name=WSEncyc1442&gt;{{cite book |title= Women's Studies Encyclopedia|last=Tierney |first=Helen |authorlink=  |year= 1999|publisher= Greenwood Publishing Group|page=1442 |isbn=978-0-313-31073-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Socialist and economic utopias have tended to take the "woman question" seriously, and often to offer some form of equality between the sexes as part and parcel of their vision, whether this be by addressing misogyny, reorganizing society along separatist lines, creating a certain kind of androgynous equality that ignores gender, or in some other manner. For example, [[Edward Bellamy]]'s ''[[Looking Backward]]'' (1887) responded, progressively for his day, to the contemporary women's suffrage and women's rights movements. Bellamy supported these movements by incorporating the equality of women and men into his utopian world's structure, albeit by consigning women to a separate sphere of light industrial activity (due to women's  lesser physical strength), and making various exceptions for them in order to make room for (and to praise) motherhood. One of the earlier feminist utopias that imagines complete separatism is [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]]'s ''[[Herland (novel)|Herland]]'' (1915).

In [[Gender in speculative fiction|science fiction and technological speculation]], gender can be challenged on the biological as well as the social level. [[Marge Piercy]]'s ''[[Woman on the Edge of Time]]'' portrays equality between the genders and complete equality in sexuality (regardless of the gender of the lovers).  Birth-giving, often felt as the divider that cannot be avoided in discussions of women's rights and roles, has been shifted onto elaborate biological machinery that functions to offer an enriched embryonic experience,  When a child is born, it spends most of its time in the children's ward with peers. Three "mothers" per child are the norm, and they are chosen in a gender neutral way (men as well as women may become "mothers") on the basis of their experience and ability. Technological advances also make possible the freeing of women from childbearing in [[Shulamith Firestone]]'s ''[[The Dialectic of Sex]]''. The fictional aliens in [[Mary Gentle]]'s ''Golden Witchbreed'' start out as gender-neutral children and do not develop into men and women until puberty, and gender has no bearing on social roles. In contrast, [[Doris Lessing]]'s ''[[The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four and Five]]'' (1980) suggests that men's and women's values are inherent to the sexes and cannot be changed, making a compromise between them essential. In ''My Own Utopia'' (1961) by [[Elizabeth Mann Borghese]], gender exists but is dependent upon age rather than sex&amp;nbsp;— genderless children mature into women, some of whom eventually become men.&lt;ref name=WSEncyc1442/&gt; "[[William Moulton Marston|William Marston]]'s [[Wonder Woman]] comics of the 1940s featured Paradise Island, also known as [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]], a matriarchal all-female community of peace, loving submission, bondage, and giant space kangaroos."&lt;ref&gt;Noah Berlatsky, "Imagine There's No Gender: The Long History of Feminist Utopian Literature," ''The Atlantic,'' April 15, 2013. https://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/04/imagine-theres-no-gender-the-long-history-of-feminist-utopian-literature/274993/&lt;/ref&gt;

Utopian [[single-gender worlds]] or single-sex societies have long been one of the primary ways to explore implications of gender and gender-differences.&lt;ref name=DGinSF13/&gt; In speculative fiction, female-only worlds have been imagined to come about by the action of disease that wipes out men, along with the development of technological or mystical method that allow female [[parthenogenic]] [[reproduction]]. Charlotte Perkins Gilman's 1915 novel approaches this type of separate society. Many feminist utopias pondering separatism were written in the 1970s, as a response to the [[Lesbian separatism|Lesbian separatist movement]];&lt;ref name=DGinSF13&gt;Attebery, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=erotic1189&gt;[[Gaétan Brulotte]] &amp; John Phillips,''Encyclopedia of Erotic Literature'', "Science Fiction and Fantasy", CRC Press, 2006, p. 1189, {{ISBN|1-57958-441-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =Utop101/&gt; examples include [[Joanna Russ]]'s ''[[The Female Man]]'' and [[Suzy McKee Charnas]]'s ''[[Walk to the End of the World]]'' and ''[[Motherlines]]''.&lt;ref name =Utop101&gt;Martha A. Bartter, ''The Utopian Fantastic'', "Momutes", Robin Anne Reid, p.101 {{ISBN|0-313-31635-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Utopias imagined by male authors have often included equality between sexes, rather than separation, although as noted Bellamy's strategy includes a certain amount of "separate but equal".&lt;ref name =Utop102&gt;Martha A. Bartter, ''The Utopian Fantastic'', "Momutes", Robin Anne Reid, p. 102 ISBN&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of female-only worlds allows the exploration of female independence and freedom from [[patriarchy]]. The societies may be lesbian, such as ''[[Daughters of a Coral Dawn]]'' by [[Katherine V. Forrest]], or not, and may not be sexual at all&amp;nbsp;— a famous early sexless example being ''[[Herland (novel)|Herland]]'' (1915) by [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]].&lt;ref name=erotic1189/&gt; Charlene Ball writes in ''Women's Studies Encyclopedia'' that use of speculative fiction to explore gender roles in future societies has been more common in the United States compared to Europe and elsewhere,&lt;ref name=WSEncyc1442/&gt; although such efforts as [[Gerd Brantenberg]]'s ''Egalia's Daughters'' and [[Christa Wolf]]'s portrayal of the land of Colchis in her ''Medea: Voices ''are certainly as influential and famous as any of the American feminist utopias.

===Utopianism===
[[File:Goldenes-Zeitalter-1530-2.jpg|thumbnail|right|200px|''[[The Golden Age (Cranach)|The Golden Age]]'' by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]].]]
In many cultures, societies, and religions, there is some myth or memory of a distant past when humankind lived in a primitive and simple state, but at the same time one of perfect happiness and fulfillment. In those days, the various [[mythology|myth]]s tell us, there was an instinctive harmony between humanity and nature. People's needs were few and their desires limited. Both were easily satisfied by the abundance provided by nature. Accordingly, there were no motives whatsoever for war or oppression. Nor was there any need for hard and painful work. Humans were simple and [[piety|pious]], and felt themselves close to their God or gods. According to one anthropological theory, hunter-gatherers were the [[original affluent society]].

These mythical or religious archetypes are inscribed in many cultures, and resurge with special vitality when people are in difficult and critical times. However, in utopias, the projection of the myth does not take place towards the remote past, but either towards the future or towards distant and fictional places, imagining that at some time in the future, at some point in space, or beyond death, there must exist the possibility of living happily.

These myths of the earliest stage of humankind have been referred to by various cultures, societies, and religions:

====Golden Age====

The [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] poet [[Hesiod]], around the 8th century BC, in his compilation of the mythological tradition (the poem ''[[Works and Days]]''), explained that, prior to [[Ages of Man|the present era]], there were four other progressively more perfect ones, the oldest of which was the [[Golden Age]].

[[Plutarch]], the Greek historian and biographer of the 1st century, dealt with the blissful and mythic past of the humanity.

====Arcadia====

From [[Sir Philip Sidney]]'s prose romance ''[[Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia|The Old Arcadia]]'' (1580), originally a region in the [[Peloponnesus]], [[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadia]] became a [[synonym]] for any rural area that serves as a [[pastoral]] setting, a ''locus amoenus'' ("delightful place").

====The Biblical Garden of Eden====

The [[Hebrew Bible|Biblical]] [[Garden of Eden]] as depicted in the [[Old Testament]] [[Bible]]'s [[Book of Genesis]] 2 ([[King James Version of the Bible|Authorized Version of 1611]]):

&lt;blockquote&gt;"And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed. And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the [[Tree of life (biblical)|tree of life]] also in the midst of the garden, and the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil|tree of knowledge of good and evil]]. [...]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die. [...]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And the Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; [...] And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof; and the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the exegesis that the biblical theologian [[Herbert Haag]] proposes in the book ''Is original sin in Scripture?'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Haag |first=Herbert |authorlink=Herbert Haag |title=Is original sin in Scripture? |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zO_YAAAAMAAJ |year=1969 |publisher=[[Sheed and Ward]] |location=New York}} [[German language|German]] or. ed.: [https://books.google.com/books?id=EnWRSQAACAAJ 1966].&lt;/ref&gt; published soon after the [[Second Vatican Council]], {{bibleref2|Genesis 2:25||NIV}} would indicate that [[Adam and Eve]] were created from the beginning naked of the [[divine grace]], an originary grace that, then, they would never have had and even less would have lost due to the subsequent events narrated. On the other hand, while supporting a continuity in the Bible about the absence of [[preternatural]] gifts ({{lang-la|dona praeternaturalia}})&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} Haag, Herbert (1966). pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=nUMaAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22dona+praeternaturalia%22 9, 49ff.]&lt;/ref&gt; with regard to the [[Serpents in the Bible#Eden|ophitic event]], Haag never makes any reference to the discontinuity of the loss of access to the tree of life.

====The Land of Cockaigne====

The Land of [[Cockaigne]] (also Cockaygne, Cokaygne), was an imaginary land of idleness and luxury, famous in medieval stories, and the subject of several poems, one of which, an early translation of a 13th-century French work, is given in [[George Ellis (poet)|George Ellis']] ''Specimens of Early English Poets''. In this, "the houses were made of barley sugar and cakes, the streets were paved with pastry, and the shops supplied goods for nothing."  London has been so called (see [[Cockney#Cockaigne|Cockney]]), but Boileau applies the same to Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Cobham Brewer E. ''Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable'', Odhams, London, 1932&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Peach Blossom Spring====
The [[Peach Blossom Spring]], a prose written by the Chinese writer [[Tao Yuanming]] (c. 220 - 589 CE), describes a utopian place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Tian| first=Xiaofei| title=The Cambridge History of Chinese Literature| year=2010| publisher=Cambridge University Press| location=Cambridge| isbn=978-0-521-85558-7| page=221| chapter=From the Eastern Jin through the Early Tang (317–649)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Berkowitz| first=Alan J.| title=Patterns of Disengagement: the Practice and Portrayal of Reclusion in Early Medieval China| year=2000| publisher=Stanford University Press| location=Stanford| isbn=978-0-8047-3603-9| page=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; The narrative goes that a fisherman from Wuling sailed upstream a river and came across a beautiful blossoming peach grove and lush green fields covered with blossom petals.&lt;ref name=zh182&gt;{{cite book| last=Longxi| first=Zhang| title=Allegoresis: Reading Canonical Literature East and West| year=2005| publisher=Cornell University Press| location=Ithaca| isbn=978-0-8014-4369-5| page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entranced by the beauty, he continued upstream.&lt;ref name=zh182/&gt; When he reached the end of the river, he stumbled onto a small grotto.&lt;ref name=zh182/&gt; Though narrow at first, he was able to squeeze through the passage and discovered an ethereal utopia, where the people led an ideal existence in harmony with nature.&lt;ref name=zh182-3&gt;{{cite book| last=Longxi| first=Zhang| title=Allegoresis: Reading Canonical Literature East and West| year=2005| publisher=Cornell University Press| location=Ithaca| isbn=978-0-8014-4369-5| pages=182–183}}&lt;/ref&gt; He saw a vast expanse of fertile lands, clear ponds, mulberry trees, bamboo groves, and the like with a community of people of all ages and houses in neat rows.&lt;ref name=zh182-3/&gt; The people explained that their ancestors escaped to this place during the civil unrest of the [[Qin dynasty]] and they themselves had not left since or had contact with anyone from the outside.&lt;ref name=zh183&gt;{{cite book| last=Longxi| first=Zhang| title=Allegoresis: Reading Canonical Literature East and West| year=2005| publisher=Cornell University Press| location=Ithaca| isbn=978-0-8014-4369-5| pages=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had not even heard of the later dynasties of bygone times or the then-current [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]].&lt;ref name=zh183/&gt; In the story, the community was secluded and unaffected by the troubles of the outside world.&lt;ref name=zh183/&gt; The sense of timelessness was also predominant in the story as a perfect utopian community remains unchanged, that is, it had no decline nor the need to improve.&lt;ref name=zh183/&gt; Eventually, the Chinese term ''Peach Blossom Spring'' (桃花源) came to be synonymous for the concept of utopia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Gu| first=Ming Dong| title=Chinese Theories of Fiction: A Non-Western Narrative System| year=2006| publisher=State University of New York Press| location=Albany| isbn=978-0-7914-6815-9| page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Datong====

[[Great Unity|Datong]] is a traditional Chinese Utopia.  The main description of it is found in the Chinese [[Classic of Rites]], in the chapter called "Li Yun" (禮運).  Later, Datong and its ideal of 'The World Belongs to Everyone/The World is Held in Common' 'Tianxia weigong/天下为公' 'influenced modern Chinese reformers and revolutionaries, such as [[Kang Youwei]].

====Schlaraffenland====

[[Schlaraffenland]] is an analogous German tradition.

All these myths also express some hope that the [[idyll]]ic state of affairs they describe is not irretrievably and irrevocably lost to mankind, that it can be regained in some way or other.

One way might be a quest for an "earthly paradise"—a place like [[Shangri-La]], hidden in the [[Tibet]]an mountains and described by [[James Hilton (novelist)|James Hilton]] in his utopian novel ''[[Lost Horizon (novel)|Lost Horizon]]'' (1933). [[Christopher Columbus]] followed directly in this tradition in his belief that he had found the Garden of Eden when, towards the end of the 15th century, he first encountered the [[New World]] and its indigenous inhabitants.

On July 20, 1958, while out to dinner with friends in the town of Puerto Pinasco, Paraguay, Dr. Ramón Artemio Bracho proposed the idea of a '''World Friendship Day''' to his colleagues. On that night, the World Crusade of Friendship was founded, as an activist organization that would promote the idea of celebrating worldwide friendship on July 30. The organization lobbied the [[United Nations]] for many years,  until finally, on July 27, 2011, the General Assembly of the United Nations assigned this date to celebrate the International [[Friendship Day]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/65/L.72 UN Res.A/65/L.72]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Friendship Day Traditions ==
[[Friendship Day|"Día de la Amistad"]] is celebrated every July 30 in Paraguay, where it is a popular festivity in which it is custom among Paraguayans to salute and wish each other's happiness throughout the day, while also exchanging presents.

Another classic activity during this celebration, particularly among young students, but also among other general groups (coworkers, companies, civil organizations, etc.), is the game of the "invisible friend",&lt;ref&gt;[http://discoveringparaguay.com/home/friendship-day-dia-del-amigo/ Discovering Paraguay: Friendship Day Traditions]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoluque.com.py/noticias/49.htm Local report about Paraguayan customs on Friendship Day]&lt;/ref&gt; which is a variation of the popular [[Secret Santa]]. One week before the celebration, participants are invited to write their names on a piece of paper and then, after scrambling all these pieces in a basket or container, retrieve one of the names, without revealing it to the others. Participants then become the "invisible friend" of the person on that piece of paper, and during the week before the celebration, they are invited to write anonymous small notes or letters to the person whose name they selected. On the day of the celebration, invisible friends bring presents to their friends, and one after the other, reveal their identities before giving their presents.
