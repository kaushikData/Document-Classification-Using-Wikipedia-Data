'''''Acres of Skin: Human Experiments at Holmesburg Prison''''' is a 1998 book by [[Allen Hornblum]]. The book documents clinical non-therapeutic [[Research Involving Prisoners|medical experiments on prison inmates]] at [[Holmesburg, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania#Prisons|Holmesburg Prison]] in Philadelphia from 1951 to 1974, conducted under the direction of [[dermatologist]] [[Albert Kligman]].&lt;ref name=high/&gt; The title of the book is a reference to Kligman's reaction on seeing hundreds of prisoners when he entered the prison: "All I saw before me were acres of skin" ... "It was like a farmer seeing a fertile field for the first time".&lt;ref name="sentenced_to_science"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hornblum|first=Allen|title=Sentenced to Science: One Black Man's Story of Imprisonment in America|publisher=The Pennsylvania State University Press|year=2007|pages=ix, 52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book discusses issues surrounding the inadequate consent procedures of the 1950s and 1960s when using prisoners.  Prisoners, attracted by the compensation, were angry when two of the experiment's participants testified before Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hilberman|first=Mark|title=Acres of Skin|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|year=1999|pages=353–354|pmc=479251|pmid=11645179|volume=25|issue=4|doi=10.1136/jme.25.4.353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The publication of ''Acres of Skin'' in 1998 attracted considerable international media interest.&lt;ref name="sentenced_to_science"/&gt; The book has been reviewed in several journals including the ''International Journal of Dermatology'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Millikan | first1 = Jeanine | year = 1999 | title = Book Review: Acres of Skin | url = http://pt.wkhealth.com/pt/re/ijdm/abstract.00004342-199902000-00021.htm;jsessionid=KzmKhh2LhYlBq66JPpnJDGQv8y9yTT8BJ4JQGPwsLRDyhsy2y261!991635284!181195629!8091!-1 | journal = International Journal of Dermatology | volume = 38 | issue = 2| page = 158 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-4362.1999.00684.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Social History of Medicine''&lt;ref&gt;T.W.

'''Aleš Ušeničnik''' (3 July 1868 – 30 March 1952)&lt;ref name="Umrli"&gt;[http://www.sazu.si/o-sazu/clani/umrli.html Slovenska akademija znanosti in umetnosti: Umrli člani SAZU]&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Slovenes|Slovene]] [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[priest]], [[philosopher]], [[sociologist]] and [[theologian]]. He was one of the main philosophers of [[neo-Thomism]] in [[Slovenia]] and in [[Yugoslavia]].

Ušeničnik was born in the village of [[Poljane nad Škofjo Loko|Poljane]] near the [[Upper Carniola]]n town of [[Škofja Loka]], in what was then the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] (now in Slovenia). He studied theology at the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]] in [[Rome]]. In 1897, he became a professor at the Theological Seminary in [[Ljubljana]]. In 1919, he became a professor at the Faculty of Theology at the [[University of Ljubljana]], where he taught philosophy. In 1922 and 1923, he served as the fourth [[Chancellor (education)|chancellor]] of the University of Ljubljana. In 1937, he became a member of the [[Pontifical Academy of St. Thomas Aquinas]] and in 1938 one of the founding members of the Academy of Sciences and Arts in Ljubljana (later renamed the [[Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts]]). In 1948, he was expelled from the academy by the new [[communist regime]].&lt;ref name="Umrli"/&gt; His membership was reinstated in 1996 after the collapse of communism.&lt;ref name="Umrli"/&gt;

He died in Ljubljana in 1952.

'''Archon Fung''' (born 6 April 1968),&lt;ref name=Congress&gt;{{cite web |title= Fung, Archon, 1968- |url= http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n96006205.html |publisher= Library of Congress |accessdate= 5 November 2014 |quote= data sheet (b. 04-06-68) }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the Ford Foundation Professor of Democracy and Citizenship at [[Harvard University|Harvard University's]] [[John F. Kennedy School of Government|Kennedy School of Government]] and co-founder of the Transparency Policy Project.  Fung served as an Assistant Professor of Public Policy at the Kennedy School from July 1999-June 2004, then as an Associate Professor of Public Policy at the Kennedy School from July 2004-October 2007, and finally as a Professor of Public Policy from October 2007-March 2009 before being named as the Ford Foundation Chair of Democracy and Citizenship in March 2009. In 2015, he was elected to the [[Common Cause]] National Governing Board.

Fung has authored five books, three edited collections, and over fifty articles appearing in journals including ''American Political Science Review'', ''Public Administration Review'', ''Political Theory'', ''Journal of Political Philosophy'', ''Politics and Society'', ''Governance'', ''Journal of Policy and Management'', ''Environmental Management'', ''American Behavioral Scientist'', ''International Journal of Urban and Regional Research'', and ''Boston Review''. 

== Education ==
Fung received his undergraduate and graduate education at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], where he gained two Bachelor of Science degrees in Philosophy and Physics in 1990 and a Ph.D. in Political Science in 1999. 

==Major works==
Fung's dissertation looked at the impact of the participatory involvement of Chicago’s residents, police officers, teachers, and community groups to reform education. This research was published in Fung’s first book ''Empowered Participation: Reinventing Urban Democracy'' in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hks.harvard.edu/news-events/news/articles/ash-fung-participedia-aug10 |title=''Professor Archon Fung Launches Participedia'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fung | first = Archon | title = Empowered participation reinventing urban democracy | publisher = Princeton University Press | location = Princeton, New Jersey | year = 2004 | isbn = 9781400835638 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fung's research was unprecedented for the in-depth approach it took to understanding local governance as both an examination of a specific case but also as a model for understanding urban participatory democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Fung | first1 = Archon | last2 = Wright | first2 = Erik Olin | author-link2 = Erik Olin Wright | title = Deepening democracy: institutional innovations in empowered participatory governance | publisher = [[Verso Books|Verso]] | location = London New York | year = 2003 | isbn = 9781859844663 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Empowered Participation'' is exemplary of Fung’s work: innovative and uniting rigorous empirical analysis with an equally strong foundation in theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fung | first = Archon | title = Empowered participation reinventing urban democracy | publisher = Princeton University Press | location = Princeton, New Jersey | year = 2004 | isbn = 9780691126081 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book detailed Fung’s concept of [[accountable autonomy]].

Fung’s work has continued in this trajectory of sitting at the cutting edge of policy and theory with his second book ''Full Disclosure: The Perils and Promise of Transparency'', co-authored with Mary Graham and David Weil in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Fung | first1 = Archon | last2 = Graham | first2 = Mary | last3 = Weil | first3 = David | title = Full disclosure : the perils and promise of transparency | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = New York | year = 2007 | isbn = 9780521699617 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Full Disclosure'' examines transparency as a regulatory tool for protecting the public interest through the lens of eighteen major policies, including those designed to improve car safety and restaurant hygiene. This work introduces the notion of targeted transparency - where the disclosure of information serves to bridge a gap in knowledge that otherwise contributes to public risk or service failures. The theoretical underpinning of targeted transparency is the “Transparency Action Cycle" whereby disclosers provide information to the public in a format that responds to users' will and capacity to process and use that information at the point of decision-making. 

The themes of enabling citizens to be more efficacious within their political system is evident in the other books, projects, and articles Fung has either written or contributed to.  These include a 2000 book with Bradley Karkkainen and [[Charles Sabel]] entitled ''Beyond Backyard Environmentalism''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Fung | first1 = Archon | last2 = Sabel | first2 = Charles | last3 = Karkkainen | first3 = Bradley | author-link2 = Charles Sabel | title = Beyond backyard environmentalism | publisher = Beacon Press | location = Boston | year = 2000 | isbn = 9780807004456 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Can We Put an End to Sweatshops'', a 2001 book written with Dara O’Rourke and [[Charles Sabel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Fung | first1 = Archon | last2 = Sabel | first2 = Charles | last3 = O'Rourke | first3 = Dara | author-link2 = Charles Sabel | title = Can we put an end to sweatshops | publisher = Beacon Press | location = Boston, Mass | year = 2001 | isbn = 9780807047156 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Fung has published numerous articles on these topics ranging from more theoretical pieces such as a 2005 piece in ''Political Theory'' entitled “Deliberation Before the Revolution: Toward an Ethics of Deliberative Democracy in an Unjust World”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Fung | first = Archon | title = Deliberation before the revolution: toward an ethics of deliberative democracy in an unjust world | journal = [[Political Theory (journal)|Political Theory]] | volume = 33 | issue = 3 | pages = 397-419 | publisher = Sage | doi = 10.1177/0090591704271990 | date = June 2005 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0090591704271990 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a 2007 piece appearing in the ''[[American Political Science Review]]'' entitled “Democratic Theory and Political Science: A Pragmatic Method of Constructive Engagement” which bridges theory and practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Fung | first = Archon | title = Democratic theory and political science: a pragmatic method of constructive engagement | journal = [[American Political Science Review]] | volume = 101 | issue = 3 | pages = 443-458 | publisher = Cambridge Journals | doi = 10.1017/S000305540707030X | date = August 2007 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S000305540707030X | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://archonfung.net/docs/articles/2007/FungAPSA0708.pdf Pdf version.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fung is also deeply engaged in current politics, having published a piece for the [[The American Prospect|American Prospect]] in May 2010, entitled a “Tea Party for Obama.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fung|first1=Archon|title=A tea party for Obama|url=http://prospect.org/article/tea-party-obama-0|accessdate=5 November 2014|work=[[The American Prospect]]|date=27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Fung serves on the national advisory board of [[AmericaSpeaks]] and is a consultant for various organizations including the [[Open Society Institute]] and the [[World Bank]].

As an indicator of Fung’s personal and professional commitment to the ideals of transparency he has published a “Conflict Statement” on his personal website, which outlines his engagement with outside organizations.  “First, as someone who seeks to understand the worlds of democratic reform and public policy, it is important to see things from the perspective of practitioners which is very different from the perspective of scholars. Working closely with practitioners is one way — the best way I know of — to gain that understanding.”

== Current research ==
Fung’s current research focuses broadly on the realms of [[Transparency in government|transparency]] in public and private [[governance]] as well as [[participatory democracy]] with a focus on [[Deliberative democracy|deliberative forms of governance]].  Current projects examine democratic reform initiatives in electoral reform, urban planning, public services, ecosystem management, and transnational governance. His most recent research looks at the role of technology within the area of transparency and governance.

In September 2009, Fung launched [https://web.archive.org/web/20110524135457/http://www.participedia.net/wiki/Welcome_to_Participedia Participedia], a website developed with Mark Warren of the [[University of British Columbia]], aimed at strengthening democracy with its user-generated library of examples and methods of participatory governance, public deliberation, and collaborative public action.

'''''Āzar Kayvān'''''  (b. between 1529 and 1533; d. between 1609 and 1618; the first name sometimes transcribed ''Adhar''), was a [[Zoroastrian]] high priest of [[Estakhr]] and native of [[Fars Province|Fars]] who emigrated to the [[Patna]] in Mughal India during the reign of the Emperor [[Akbar]] and became the founder of a [[Zoroastrian]] school of '''''ishraqiyyun''''' or [[School of Illumination|Illuminationists]]. Exhibiting features of a Zoroastrianized [[Sufi]] order, this school became known as the kis-e Abadi&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Wiley Blackwell Companion to Zoroastrianism|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=539}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Abadi sect) or as the [[Sepassian]]. 

Details regarding Azar Kayvan's life are scanty and are mainly culled from the hagiographical literature of the school. This hagiography places Azar Kayvan, son of Azar Gashasb, and his ancestry back to [[Sasan the Fifth]] (cf. the [[Dasatir]]-nama) then through Sasan the First to the [[Kayanids]], [[Gayomart]], and finally to [[Mahabad]], the figure who appeared at the very beginning of the great cycle of prophecy, according to the "Bible of the Prophets of Ancient Iran," and who seems to be none other than the primordial [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]]. His mother was named [[Shirin]]; her ancestry goes back to [[Khosrau I|Khosrau I Anushiravan]], the [[Khosrau I#Philosopher King|Philosopher King]].

According to the [[Dabistan-e-Madahib|Dabestan-i-Mazahib]], as a young boy Azar Kayvan showed signs of his calling to the contemplative life. Through dreams and visions he received the teaching of the ancient sages of [[Iran]], which allowed him to give extraordinary replies to questions which were asked of him at the [[madrasa]] where he was a student, and which won him the nickname '''''Zu'l-`Olum''''' (master of the sciences). Internal references in the biography by his devotees allow us to determine that his residence was at [[Estakhr]] (about a hundred kilometers north  of [[Shiraz]]), where he spent the first thirty or forty years of his life in contemplation and where he assembled his first assembly of disciples. Around 1570, drawn by the religious revival which was taking place in [[India]] around the Emperor [[Akbar]], he left with them to settle down in the town of [[Patna]] in the [[Bihar]], where he lived until he died at around eighty-five years of age. Amongst his students, certain of these hagiographical sources place key [[Shi'ite]] [[Muslim]] theosophical figures of the [[Safavid]] philosophical revival at [[Isfahan]] within his circle. Notably among these figures was Shaykh [[Baha' ad-Din al-`Amili|Baha'addin Amili]] and [[Mir Fendereski]], on whose behest the latter seems to have translated a major [[Tantra|Tantric]] [[yogic]] text from [[Sanskrit]] into [[Persian language|Persian]].

According to some scholars, [[Dastur]] [[Meherji Rana]], who had influenced [[Akbar]] and founded the famous lineage of [[Parsi people|Parsi]] high priests at [[Navsari]], was a disciple of  Azar Kayvan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tenets.zoroastrianism.com/zsaint33e.html FIRST DASTUR MEHERJI RANA: By Noshir Dadrawala&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bak Jeongyang'''([[korea]]n:박정양, [[hanja]]:朴定陽, 1841–1904) was a [[Korea]]n [[Joseon dynasty]] politician and edification activist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://koreandb.nate.com/history/people/detail?sn=6733 Bak Jeongyang] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105134734/http://koreandb.nate.com/history/people/detail?sn=6733 |date=2013-11-05 }} {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; a member of [[independence club]](독립협회;獨立協會) and [[People's joint association]](만민공동회;萬民共同會). also a member for Party of Kaehwa, his family was [[Pannam Park clan]].&lt;ref&gt;* [http://100.daum.net/encyclopedia/view.do?docid=b08b3643a Bak Jeongyang] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130413171640/http://100.daum.net/encyclopedia/view.do?docid=b08b3643a |date=2013-04-13 }} {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also the father of famous Korean play writer Park Seung-hee (1901-1964).
Bak Jeongyang was dispatched by Korean King to be the ambassador to the United States in 1887. He went to United States and caused an international outcry from the Chinese Empire which viewed Korea as a vassal state. After many years' conflict, Park was punished and was pushed aside. This episode reveals Korea's desire for complete independence, but demonstrates China's plan to stick to the traditional tributary tie. Park became a victim of this conflict. Park was also the author of a few books.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4257">'''Basic beliefs''' (also commonly called '''foundational beliefs''' or '''core beliefs''') are, under the [[epistemological]] view called [[foundationalism]],  the [[axiom]]s of a [[philosophical theory|belief system]].{{example needed}}

== Categories of beliefs ==
Foundationalism holds that all [[belief]]s must be [[theory of justification|justified]] in order to be believed. Beliefs therefore fall into two categories:
* Beliefs that are properly basic, in that they do not depend upon justification of other beliefs, but on something outside the realm of belief (a "non-[[doxastic]] justification")
* Beliefs that derive from one or more basic beliefs, and therefore depend on the basic beliefs for their validity

==Description ==
Within this basic framework of foundationalism exist a number of views regarding which types of beliefs qualify as ''properly'' basic; that is, what sorts of beliefs can be justifiably held without the justification of other beliefs.

In [[Foundationalism#Historical foundationalism: rationalism vs. empiricism|classical foundationalism]], beliefs are held to be properly basic if they are either [[self-evidence|self-evident]] [[axiom|axioms]], or evident to the senses ([[empiricism]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Alvin Plantinga]], Faith and Rationality, (London Notre Dame, 1983) pp. 39-44. Here Plantinga is basing his analysis on the ideas of [[Aristotle]] and [[Aquinas]].&lt;/ref&gt; However [[Anthony Kenny]] and others have argued that this is a [[self-refuting idea]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Kenny]], ''What is Faith?'' Oxford: OUP 1992 {{ISBN|0-19-283067-8}} pp. 9-10. This particular chapter is based on a 1982 lecture, which may explain the shift in the meaning of the term "foundationalism" since then.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In modern foundationalism, beliefs are held to be properly basic if they were either self-evident axiom or [[incorrigibility|incorrigible]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Alvin Plantinga]], Faith and Rationality, (London Notre Dame, 1983) pp. 58-59. Here Plantinga references [[John Locke]] and [[René Descartes]].&lt;/ref&gt; One such axiom is René Descartes's axiom, ''[[Cogito ergo sum]]'' ("I think, therefore I am"). Incorrigible (lit. ''uncorrectable'') beliefs are those one can believe without possibly being proven wrong. Notably, the evidence of the senses is not seen as properly basic because, Descartes argued, all our sensory experience could be an illusion.
* In what [[Keith Lehrer]] has called "fallible foundationalism",&lt;ref&gt;Keith Lehrer, Theory of Knowledge (Boulder, Colorado: Westview Press, 1990). See also {{cite web|url=http://www.ac.wwu.edu/~howardd/onlehrererkenntnis.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908034204/http://www.ac.wwu.edu/~howardd/onlehrererkenntnis.pdf |archivedate=2006-09-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as "moderate foundationalism", the division between [[inference|inferential]] and non-inferential belief is retained, but the requirement of incorrigibility is dropped. This, it is claimed, allows the senses to resume their traditional role as the basis of non-inferential belief despite their fallibility.&lt;ref&gt;"It makes sense for people to believe what they perceive through their experience and therefore, individuals are justified in those beliefs. "[http://www.truthawakens.com/foundationalism.asp Truth Awakens on Foundationalism] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070228062148/http://www.truthawakens.com/foundationalism.asp |date=February 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[reformed epistemology]], beliefs are held to be properly basic if they are reasonable and consistent with a sensible [[world view]].

[[Anti-foundationalism]] rejects foundationalism and denies there is some fundamental belief or principle which is the basic ground or foundation of inquiry and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;J. Childers/G. Hentzi, ''The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (1995) p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3863">The '''Battle for Births''' was one of four [[Italian economic battles|economic battles]] that took place in [[Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946)|Fascist Italy]] (1922–1943), the others being the [[Battle for Grain]] (to make the country more [[Autarky|self-sufficient]]), the [[Battle for the Lira]] (an increase in the value of the currency), and the [[Battle for Land]] (which involved policies of [[land reclamation]]). Prime Minister [[Benito Mussolini]], often known as ''[[Il Duce]]'', envisioned an [[Italian Colonial Empire|Italian Empire]] to rival [[Roman Empire|that of the Romans]], and in order to carry out this objective, foresaw the need to increase the population. Mussolini pursued an often aggressive foreign policy to achieve his colonial aims: the [[Italian army]] [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|invaded Abyssinia]] (now [[Ethiopia]]) in October 1935. The phrase "Battle for Births" was also used, in contemporary sources, to describe policies developed in [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,763434,00.html|title=Battle of Births|publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''|date=1940-02-05|accessdate=2009-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
Mussolini feuded with the [[Catholic Church]] over a number of issues in his time in office, but their views, at that time, coincided on the issue of [[gender role]]s and [[contraception]]: both felt that women should assume a role as wife and mother, and both disagreed with [[contraception]] and [[abortion]], with Mussolini banning the former. The Battle for Births began in 1927: Mussolini introduced a number of measures to encourage reproduction, with an objective of increasing the population from 40 million to 60 million by 1950. Loans were offered to married couples, with part of the loan cancelled for each new child, and any married man who had more than six children was made exempt from taxation. Mussolini, who had developed a [[cult of personality]], argued that the Italian people had a duty to himself to produce as many children as possible according to Lisa (2009) and Talent et Al.

In correspondence with these incentives, laws were brought in to penalize any citizens who proved to be less productive. Bachelors were taxed increasingly, and by the late 1930s, the [[civil service]] began recruiting and promoting only those who were fertile and married. The state exercised some control over the number of women in employment through nationalized businesses, and the state-owned railway company sacked all women employed since 1915, bar war widows. These policies extended to private industry as well, with the majority of companies reserving promotions for married men.

==Outcome==
Unlike the Battle for Grain and Battle for Land, which were considered to be moderately successful, the Battle for Births is seen as a failure. By 1950—seven years after Mussolini had been ousted by [[King Victor Emmanuel III]], and five years since his execution—Italy's population stood at 47.5 million. Marriage rates stayed virtually the same during Mussolini's reign, and birth rates decreased until 1936, after which there was a modest increase. The birth rate of 112 per 1000 in 1936 was below that of pre-[[World War I]] levels (1911: 147 per 1000). Mussolini felt that the lack of enthusiasm shown by the Italian nation had cost him 15 [[Division (military)|army division]]s in [[World War II]] (in which Italy had fought alongside the [[Axis powers]]).

'''Božidar Debenjak''' (born 7 May 1935) is a [[Slovenia]]n [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[philosopher]], [[Social theory|social theorist]] and [[translator]].

==Biography==
He was born in [[Ljubljana]], [[Slovenia]], then part of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. In 1961, he became professor at the [[University of Ljubljana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ff.uni-lj.si/oddelki/filo/vsebina/zgodovina.htm# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-08-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721021050/http://www.ff.uni-lj.si/oddelki/filo/vsebina/zgodovina.htm# |archive-date=2011-07-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For more than thirty years, he taught [[Marxism|Marxist theory]] and [[history of philosophy]] at the Ljubljana University; many renowned Slovenian philosophers and sociologists were among his pupils, including [[Slavoj Žižek]], [[Mladen Dolar]], [[Rastko Močnik]], [[Renata Salecl]] and [[Tonči Kuzmanić]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mladina.si/tednik/200904/dr__bozidar_debenjak__filozof|title=MLADINA.si|website=www.mladina.si|accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="primorska.info"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.primorska.info/docs/4be9192d_001_debenjak.pdf|title=dfltweb1.onamae.com – このドメインはお名前.comで取得されています。|website=www.primorska.info|accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the first scholars to introduce the thought of the [[Frankfurt school]] in the curricula of [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] universities.

He has written several books, mostly on Marxist theory, including a monograph on the thought of [[Friedrich Engels]] (''Friedrich Engels: History and Alienation'', 1970), in which he portrayed Engels as a "subtler [[Historical materialism|historical materialist]] than Marx", who "managed to establish a clearer dividing line between history and nature".&lt;ref name="primorska.info"/&gt; His ''Introduction to Marxist Philosophy'' (1977) was published in 4 editions, and was one of the most influential synthesis of Marxist thought in Slovenia.&lt;ref name="primorska.info"/&gt;

He also translated several works, mostly from [[German language|German]], including several works by [[Karl Marx]] (especially [[young Marx]]), [[Friedrich Engels]], [[Rosa Luxemburg]], [[Theodor Adorno]], [[Max Horkheimer]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Karl Korsch]], [[Lenin]], [[Jürgen Habermas]] and [[Martin Luther]]. He also translated [[Hegel]]'s ''[[Phenomenology of the mind|Phenomenology of the Mind]]'' and [[Valvasor]]'s ''[[The Glory of the Duchy of Carniola]]'' (together with [[Doris Debenjak|his wife]] and son), and co-authored one of the most comprehensive Slovene-German dictionaries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emka.si/veliki-slovensko-nemski-slovar-grosses-slowenisch-deutsches-w%C3%B6rterbuch/PR/36182,56{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was married to [[Doris Debenjak]] (née Kirsch), a Slovenian translator of [[Gottscheers|Gottschee German]] descent and chair of the [[Society of Native Gottschee Settlers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mladina.si/tednik/200504/clanek/nar--cenzura-peter_petrovcic/|title=Moderna grmada - MLADINA.si|publisher=|accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''British Black Panthers''' or the '''British Black Panther movement''' (BBP) was a [[Black Power|black power]] organization in the [[United Kingdom]] that fought for the rights of [[black people]] and [[Person of color|peoples of colour]] in the country. The BBP were inspired by the US [[Black Panther Party]], though they were unaffiliated with them.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/socialist-standard/2010s/2014/no-1317-may-2014/mixed-media-british-black-panther-movement|title=Mixed Media: The British Black Panther Movement|last=Clayton|first=Steve|date=May 2014|work=The Socialist Party of Great Britain|access-date=11 April 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|issue=1317}}&lt;/ref&gt; It included activists of [[Black British|Black]] as well as [[British Asian|South Asian]] origin.&lt;ref name=":8"/&gt; The movement started in 1968 and lasted until around 1973.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedebrief.co.uk/news/opinion/the-forgotten-story-of-the-women-behind-the-british-black-panthers-20160362504|title=The Forgotten Story of the Women Behind the British Black Panthers|last=Agyepong|first=Heather|date=10 March 2016|work=The Debrief|access-date=11 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180528160329/https://graziadaily.co.uk/life/opinion/forgotten-story-women-behind-british-black-panthers/|archive-date=28 May 2018|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BBP worked to educate black communities and fight against [[Racism|racial discrimination]].&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/sv/article/neil-kenlocks-photos-give-the-british-black-panthers-the-legacy-they-deserve|title=The Amazing Lost Legacy of the British Black Panthers|last=Bayley|first=Bruno|date=8 October 2013|work=Vice|access-date=11 April 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the BBP worked to educate one another and British communities about [[Black British|black history]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The BBP used imagery and symbols already established by the Black Panther Party in the [[United States]].{{Sfn|Angelo|2009|p=18}} They were fighting against [[police brutality]] in the UK and they "emphasized their own preparedness and willingness to confront police when necessary."{{Sfn|Angelo|2009|p=26}} The BPP also opposed the [[Immigration Act 1971]], defended communities against [[Fascism|fascist]] violence, held [[civil rights]] demonstrations, and supported [[Caribbean]] and [[Palestinian territories|Palestinian]] liberation struggles.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qps14mSlghcC&amp;pg=PA108 ''Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations: Parties, Groups and Movements of the 20th Century'', page 108]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Black British|Black]] and [[British Asian|South Asian]] activists were involved with the group.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/farrukh-dhondy/guerrilla-a-british-black_b_15956986.html|title=Guerrilla: A British Black Panther's View By Farrukh Dhondy (One Of The Original British Black Panthers)|last=Dhondy|first=Farrukh|date=12 April 2017|website=The Huffington Post|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Malcolm X]] was visiting the UK between 1964 and 1965,{{Sfn|Angelo|2009|p=21}} and [[Stokely Carmichael]]'s address at the [[Dialectics of Liberation Congress]] at the [[Roundhouse (venue)|Roundhouse]] in London in 1967, inspired many in Britain's [[black power movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/27/britain-black-power-movement-risk-forgotten-historians|title=Britain's Black Power Movement is at Risk of Being Forgotten, Say Historians|last=Brown|first=Mark|date=27 December 2013|work=The Guardian|access-date=11 April 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fazakarley|first=Jed|date=12 May 2016|title=Race as a Separate Sphere in British Government: From the Colonial Office to Municipal Anti-racism|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/617641|journal=Callaloo|volume=39|issue=1|pages=185–202|doi=10.1353/cal.2016.0032|issn=1080-6512|subscription=yes|via=Project MUSE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carmichael's speech and visit influenced writer [[Obi Egbuna]].{{Sfn|Rhodes|2017|p=267}} Egbuna, in 1966, spent time in the [[United States]] learning about the black power movement in the United States.{{Sfn|Angelo|2009|p=21}} Activists in Britain were also inspired by the [[The Black Panther (newspaper)|''Black Panther'']] newspaper, and watching reports on the US Black Panthers on the [[BBC]].{{Sfn|Rhodes|2017|p=270}}

The British Black Panthers (BBP) were founded in the summer of 1968,{{Sfn|Lyons|2013|p=78}} by Egbuna,{{Sfn|Tuck|2014|p=198}} [[Darcus Howe]], [[Linton Kwesi Johnson]] and [[Olive Morris]], who were influenced by the American [[Black Panther Party]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mediadiversified.org/2016/02/21/the-black-panther-movement-is-part-of-black-british-history-too/|title=The Black Panther Movement is Part of Black British History Too|last=Fletcher|first=Amber|date=21 February 2016|work=Media Diversified|access-date=11 April 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other early members included [[Althea Jones LeCointe|Althea Jones-LeCointe,]] as well as [[British Asian|south Asian]] activists such as [[Farrukh Dhondy]] and [[Mala Sen]] under the banner of "blackness", with "Black" as a political label for all [[people of colour]]; for example, the related [[Southall Black Sisters]] were an Asian organization.&lt;ref name=":8"/&gt;

In 1969, the ''[[Race Today]]'' political magazine was founded by the Race Today Collective, becoming a leading organ for [[Black British|Black]] and [[British Asian|Asian]] politics in 1970s Britain. It was founded by BBP members including [[Darcus Howe]], [[Farrukh Dhondy]], [[Linton Kwesi Johnson]], and [[Mala Sen]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

The group was initially known as the British Black Power Movement, but after about a year, changed its name to the British Black Panthers.{{Sfn|Angelo|2009|p=18}} Egbuna had been arrested and was convicted in December 1968 on the charge of a conspiracy to murder police officers because of an [[essay]] he wrote about resisting police violence.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ourmigrationstory.org.uk/oms/darcus-howe-and-britains-black-power-movement|title=Darcus Howe and Britain's Black Power Movement|last=|first=|date=|website=Our Migration Story: The Making of Britain|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arrest attracted the first media attention the group received, where they were labelled as "black racialists" and "extremists."{{Sfn|Rhodes|2017|p=272}}

After Egbuna, Althea Jones-LeCointe took his place as leader of the movement.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The growth of the organization was slow, but by the early 1970s, they were "firmly ensconced in Britain's left political culture,"{{Sfn|Rhodes|2017|p=271}} and there were around 3,000 members.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

In March 1970, around 300 BBP members demonstrated in front of the [[American Embassy in London|American Embassy]] in [[Grosvenor Square]] to protest against the treatment of the American Black Panthers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/10204774/|title=Black Panthers Stage Protest|last=|first=|date=16 March 1970|work=The Argus|access-date=11 April 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 August 1970, 150 protesters involved with the BBP demonstrated against the constant [[police raids]] on the [[Mangrove restaurant|Mangrove]], a black-owned restaurant in [[Ladbroke Grove]], a West Indian neighbourhood in west London.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|author=Bunce, Robin, and Paul Field|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/frank-critchlow-community-leader-who-made-the-mangrove-restaurant-the-beating-heart-of-notting-hill-2086839.html|title=Frank Critchlow: Community leader who made the Mangrove Restaurant the beating heart of Notting Hill|last=|first=|date=22 September 2017|work=The Independent|access-date=11 April 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were 700 police involved, and violence and arrests took place.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In addition to the police, a [[Special Branch]] "black power desk" monitored the protest.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2010/nov/29/mangrove-nine-40th-anniversary|title=Mangrove Nine: the court challenge against police racism in Notting Hill|last=Bunce|first=Robin|date=29 November 2010|work=The Guardian|access-date=11 April 2017|last2=Field|first2=Paul|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nineteen members of the BBP were arrested, though later the charges against 10 were dropped.{{Sfn|Angelo|2009|p=24}} The remaining people, who became known as the "[[Mangrove Nine]]", chose to either defend themselves or have "radical barrister Ian McDonald" represent them.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; They also requested all-black juries, citing the [[Magna Carta]] as precedent.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; All members of the Mangrove Nine were later found not-guilty by the jury.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Eventually the movement "collapsed amid infighting, power struggles and '[[kangaroo court]]s'," according to ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/09/british-black-panthers-drama-photography-exhibition|title=The story of the British Black Panthers through race, politics, love and power|last=Hughes|first=Sarah|date=9 April 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=12 April 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==
Actions and educational efforts by the BBP helped expose racism in schools and in the government.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The trial of the Mangrove Nine brought legitimacy to the fight against racism in the UK police force.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Robin Bunce, a biographer of Howe, said: "He basically turned it into a trial of the Police.... His defence appealed to the Magna Carta, and the media loved it because it was rooted in English traditions of fair play, but was also enormously radical and subversively funny."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/black-power-in-britain-becoming-forgotten-history|title=Black Power in Britain becoming 'forgotten history'|date=5 January 2014|work=University of Cambridge|access-date=12 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the BBP began to fall apart in 1973, a number of women including [[Beverley Bryan]], [[Olive Morris]] and [[Liz Obi]] organised to form the [[Brixton Black Women's Group]] in Brixton.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In recent years, Kenlock's photographs of the BBP have been featured in exhibitions and other media. A 2013 project by Brixton arts organisation Photofusion conducted oral histories interviews with a number of members and held an exhibition of Kenlock's photographs of the BBP curated by young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.photofusion.org/organised-youth-present-the-british-black-panthers/|title=Organised Youth Present: The British Black Panthers|date=17 September 2013|work=Photofusion|access-date=12 April 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/power-struggle-a-new-exhibition-looks-back-at-the-rise-of-the-british-black-panthers-8872269.html|title=Power struggle: A new exhibition looks back at the rise of the British|last=Williams|first=Holly|date=13 October 2013|work=The Independent|access-date=12 April 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tate Britain]]'s 2017 display ''Stan Firm Inna Inglan: Black Diaspora in London, 1960–70s'', featured photographers, including Kenlock, who captured the experiences of black people during that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/visit/tate-britain/display/walk-through-and-spotlight/stan-firm-inna-inglan-black-diaspora-london|title=Stan Firm inna Inglan: Black Diaspora in London, 1960–70s |last=|first=|date=|website=Tate|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A television drama miniseries, ''[[Guerrilla (miniseries)|Guerrilla]]'' (2017)'','' explores the British Black Panthers movement in the early 1970s.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; However, American magazine ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]'' criticised the series for not representing black women in leadership roles in the black power movement of the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ebony.com/entertainment-culture/guerrilla-black-women-erased|title=Black Women Were Vital to the UK’s Black Power Movement Even Though ‘Guerrilla’ Doesn’t Show It|last=Gaynair|first=M.

Causeless cause is synonymous with '[[Absolute (philosophy)|the absolute]],' which '[[Logos|Proto-logos]]' is often confused with, but it is not: 'first' denotes finite bound, but causeless cause is unbounded. There are numerous other descriptions such as how it is also equated to the form of the absolute Being and Non-Being, or the "great Architect and to concepts such as [[Agape|Divine Love]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and pure awareness or "consciousness at rest".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Yoga For Stress Management|last=Venkatkrishnan|first=Sri|publisher=Peacock Books|year=2008|isbn=9788124801833|location=New Delhi|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sanatana Dharma|Hindus]] and Theosophists call it [[Para Brahman]] (Parabrahm). Formless Parabrahm is said to periodically emanate [[Logos|Logoi]], which are hence not causeless, but are non-eternal except in cycles of emanation, existence, [[pralaya]] (dissolution). In each cycle, causeless cause causes the Logoic [[Monad (Greek philosophy)|Monad]] to move into action, which develops into the Logoic triad/[[triple manifestation]], and the heptad (i.e. seven; [[prajapatis]] (Devas) or [[Elohim]]) which continue the cosmic chain of cause and effect. It has been shown the causeless cause is so described in some religious cosmogenesis accounts.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Considered one of the greatest [[philosophy|philosophers]] in his time, patronized by [[Alfonso II, Duke of Ferrara|Alfonso II d'Este, Duke of Ferrara]], corresponding with kings and princes who had his portrait, paid twice the salary of [[Galileo Galilei]], he is now more remembered as an infamous side actor of the [[Galileo affair]], being one of the two scholars who refused to look through Galileo's [[telescope]].&lt;ref&gt;Stillman Drake, [https://books.google.com/books?id=OwOlRPbrZeQC&amp;pg=PA162&amp;dq=Cremonini ''Galileo at work : his scientific biography'', p.&amp;nbsp;162].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Cesare Cremonini was born in [[Cento]] in the then [[Papal States]]. He was a professor of [[natural philosophy]] for about 60 years:
* From 1573 to 1590, at the [[University of Ferrara]]. Starting at a very young age and considered a great talent, he obtained the patronage of [[Alfonso II, Duke of Ferrara|Alfonso II d'Este, Duke of Ferrara]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20070729153959/http://net.comune.cento.fe.it/mediaguercino/centopassi/Cremonini.html Short bio of Cremonini on the Cento site]&lt;/ref&gt; (to whom he would dedicate his first major book in 1596). The jealousies caused by this protection helped him to eventually accept a position outside his native province.
* From 1591&lt;ref&gt;Some sources say 1590, possibly a wrong inference from his tenure ending in 1590, at Ferrara.&lt;/ref&gt; until his death,&lt;ref&gt;Some sources say until 1629, possibly because the Italian Plague of 1629–1631 perturbed or stopped lessons, but no primary source is given.&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[University of Padua]] in [[Padua]], then under [[Republic of Venice]] rule (succeeding to [[Jacopo Zabarella]]), in a chair of natural philosophy and a chair of medicine.

He taught the doctrines of [[Aristotle]], especially as interpreted by [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]] and [[Averroes]].

He was so popular in his time that most kings and princes had his portrait&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Bayle, page 224&lt;/ref&gt; and corresponded with him, sometimes consulting him about private and public affairs.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Universalis''&lt;/ref&gt; At Padua, his salary was twice that of Galileo. He was especially popular among the French intellectuals who called him "le Cremonin" (the Cremonin); even a remote writer such as [[Jean-Louis Guez de Balzac]] mentioned him as "le grand Cremonin" (the great Cremonin) in his ''Lettres''.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Bayle, page 224, note C&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metaphysical views===
Following up on the controversy opened in 1516 by [[Pietro Pomponazzi]] and continued by [[Jacopo Zabarella]] (his predecessors in the chair), Cremonini too taught that reason alone cannot demonstrate the immortality of the soul – his absolute adherence to Aristotle implying that he believed in the mortality of the soul. After a paper he wrote about the Jesuits, and public statements he made in favor of laic teachers, the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] in Venice accused him of [[materialism]], then relayed their grievances to Rome. He was prosecuted in 1604 by the Inquisition for [[atheism]] and the [[Averroism|Averroist heresy]] of "[[double truth]]", and ordered to refute his claims: as was his manner, Cremonini gently refused to retract himself, sheltering himself behind Aristotle's authority. Because Padua was then under tolerant Venetian rule, he was kept out of reach of a full trial.

As for the accusations, and beyond Cremonini's teachings: indeed his personal motto was "Intus ut libet, foris ut moris est"&lt;ref&gt;John Addington Symonds: ''Renaissance in Italy'', Volume 1, 1887, footnote 11, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/16504/16504-h/16504-h.htm online version]&lt;/ref&gt; (Latin for "In private think what you wish, in public behave as is the custom"), which was taken by [[humanism|humanists]] as meaning that a scientific thinker could hold one set of opinions as a philosopher, and another set as a [[Christianity|Christian]]; it was also adopted by European [[Libertine]]s (brought back to France by his student and confidant [[Gabriel Naudé]]). After his death, Cremonini had his tombstone engraved with "Cæsar Cremoninus hic totus jacet" (Latin for "Here lies all of Cremonini"), implying that no soul survived.

His student Naudé (who had been his confidant for three months) qualified most of his Italian teachers as "Atheists"&lt;ref&gt;Michel Jeanneret: "L'Italie, ferment de liberté", in ''Atti dei convegni lincei, La Cultura letteraria italiana e l'identità europea'' (2001), Roma: Accad. Nazionale dei Lincei, 2002, pp.183–193 (in French) quoting René Pintard quoting Gabriel Naudé&lt;/ref&gt; and especially Cremonini as a "déniaisé" ("one who has been wised up, unfoolish, devirginized", the Libertines' word for unbelievers); he added to his friends, translated, "The Cremonin, Professor of Philosophy in Padua, confessed to a few choice Friends of his that he believed neither in God, nor in [[Devil]], nor in the immortality of the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]: yet he was careful that his manservant was a good [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]], for fear he said, should he believe in nothing, that he may one morning cut my throat in my bed".&lt;ref&gt;Sophie Houdard: "De l'ennemi public aux amitiés particulières. Quelques hypothèses sur le rôle du Diable (15e-17e siècles)", in ''Raisons politiques'' n° 5, Paris: Presses de Sciences Po, 2002/1, {{ISBN|2-7246-2932-9}}, [http://www.cairn.info/article.php?ID_REVUE=RAI&amp;ID_NUMPUBLIE=RAI_005&amp;ID_ARTICLE=RAI_005_0009 pp. 9–27 (in French) online] quoting René Pintard quoting Naudé&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[Pierre Bayle]] pointed out that Cremonini did not believe in the immortality of the soul (in the "Crémonin" article of his ''[[Historical and Critical Dictionary]]''). [[Gottfried Leibniz]], in his 1710 ''Theodicy'', dealing with the Averroists, who "declared that man's soul is, according to philosophy, mortal, while they protested their acquiescence in Christian theology, which declares the soul's immortality", says "that very sect of the Averroists survived as a school. It is thought that Caesar Cremoninus, a philosopher famous in his time, was one of its mainstays".&lt;ref&gt;[[Gottfried Leibniz]]: ''Theodicy '', 1710, Open Court Publishing Company, Peru, Illinois: 1951 translation by E.M. Huggard, {{ISBN|0-87548-437-9}}, [http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?pageno=47&amp;fk_files=206453 page 81 online]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierre Larousse]], in his opinionated ''[[Grand dictionnaire universel du XIXe siècle]]'', stated Cremonini was not a Christian.

===Cremonini and Galileo===
At Padua Cremonini was both a rival and a friend of his colleague Galileo. When Galileo announced that he had discovered mountains on the Moon in 1610, he offered Cremonini the chance to observe the evidence through a telescope. Cremonini refused even to look through the telescope and insisted that Aristotle had definitely proved the Moon could only be a perfect sphere. When Galileo decided to move to Tuscany that year, Cremonini warned him that it would bring him under the Inquisition's jurisdiction. Indeed, the next year the Inquisition reviewed Cremonini's case for evidence against Galileo.&lt;ref&gt;May 1611 entry in the [http://galileo.rice.edu/chron/galileo.html online Galileo Timeline]&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, in his book ''[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems]]'', Galileo would include the character Simplicio, a dogmatic Aristotelian philosopher who was partly based on Cremonini.

===Death and legacy===
When Cremonini died in 1631 during the Paduan outbreak of the [[Italian Plague of 1629-1631]], more than 400 students were working with him. His previous students included, alphabetically:

* [[Theophilos Corydalleus]], graduated 1613, a Greek philosopher, had some influence in the Greek-speaking world during the 17th and 18th centuries
* [[William Harvey]], graduated 1602, an English doctor who was the first to correctly describe the circulation of the blood
* [[Joachim Jung]], graduated 1619, a German mathematician and naturalist popularized by [[John Ray]]
* [[Ioannis Kottounios]], an eminent Greek scholar and his successor to the chair of philosophy at Padua
* [[Justus Lipsius]], a philosopher of the [[Spanish Netherlands]]
* [[Gabriel Naudé]], in 1625–27, a French scholar and [[Cardinal Mazarin]]'s librarian
* [[Guy Patin]], a French doctor, headmaster of the School of Medicine in Paris
* [[Antonio Rocco]], an Italian philosophy teacher and libertine writer
* [[Corfitz Ulfeldt (1606-1664)|Corfitz Ulfeldt]], in 1628–29, a famous Danish statesman and traitor
* [[Flemming Ulfeldt]], also in 1628–29, a Danish statesman and military leader, younger brother of Corfitz

He was buried in the [[Benedictine]] monastery of St. [[Justina of Padua]] (to which he also willed his possessions). His name has been given to several streets ("via Cesare Cremonini" in Cento, "via Cesare Cremonino" in Padua) and an institute ("Istituto Magistrale Cesare Cremonini" in Cento).

==Bibliography==

===Concise bibliography===

Below are his main books (many of them including separate treatises), listing only their most usual abridged titles:

* 1596: ''Explanatio proœmii librorum Aristotelis De physico auditu''
* 1605: ''De formis elementorum''
* 1611: ''De Anima'' (student transcript of a Cremonini lecture)
* 1613: ''Disputatio de cœlo''
* 1616: ''De quinta cœli substantia'' (second series of ''De cœlo'')
* 1626: ''De calido innato'' (reprinted in 1634)
* 1627: ''De origine et principatu membrorum''
* 163?: ''De semine'' (printed or reprinted in 1634)
*: --- ''Posthumous:''
* 1634: ''De calido innato et semine'' (expanding 1626 with 163?)
* 1644: ''De sensibus et facultate appetitiva''
* 1663: ''Dialectica''

(Not included are poems and other personal texts.)

===Extended bibliography===

&lt;!--the full latin titles have been undeleted because:
    1) an encyclopedia is the place for such hard-to-find information, especially on obscure topics
    2) full latin titles allow a scholar to find the article via search engines
    3) bibliographies are usually this way for latin books or ancient-style very long titles

The concept of "short title" or "concise bibliography" is very recent, book titles used to be very long, being an abstract of the book itself. For instance:

 -''Gulliver's Travels'' is a modern shortening of ''Travels into Several Remote Nations of the World. In Four Parts. By Lemuel Gulliver, First a Surgeon, and then a Captain of Several Ships'' – http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulliver'_Travels
 -''Robinson Crusoe'' is a modern shortening of ''The Life and Strange Surprising Adventures of Robinson Crusoe of York, Mariner: who lived Eight and Twenty Years, all alone [etc.]'' – http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robinson_Crusoe

No decent encyclopedia could go with only the modern shorter titles and not duly list the original, actual titles.
--&gt;

Below are his main books (with usual short titles, original full titles, and indication of some variants or misspellings commonly found in literature). As was the practice of the time, many of them are made of opuscules, separate treatises grouped in a single binding. (Please note that Latin title spelling can vary depending on their grammatical position in a sentence, such as a "tractatus" becoming a "tractatum" in the [[accusative case]] when inside a longer title.)

In [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] cultures, '''coloured hats''' are sometimes used to symbolise attitudes towards various different abstract concepts. Several [[sects]] are [[Tibetan Buddhism#Red and Yellow Hats|distinguished by the colour of their hats]]:

* Yellow Hat – the [[Gelug]] sect
* Red Hat – the [[Nyingma]], [[Sakya]], and [[Kagyu]] sects
* [[Black Crown|Black Hat]] – the [[Karma Kagyu]] sect

In [[computing]] [[slang]], [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers and crackers]] are identified according to their intentions.

* [[White hat (computer security)|White hat]] hacker, who hacks for beneficial purposes
* [[Black hat hacking|Black hat]] hacker, who hacks for malevolent purposes
* [[Grey hat]] hacker, who hacks with ambiguous ethics

Also in computing is a business company called [[Red Hat]].

In the educational theories of [[Edward de Bono]], six coloured hats represent [[Six Thinking Hats|six thinking states]].

* White hat – Facts &amp; Information
* Red hat – Feelings &amp; Emotions
* Black hat – Critical Judgement
* Yellow hat – Positive
* Green hat – New Ideas
* Blue hat – The Big Picture

In Chinese culture, a green hat symbolises a [[cuckold]]. This issue is addressed in the movie ''[[Green Hat]]''.

[[Image:Soldier 0875.JPG|thumb|[[Soldier beetle]] covered with pollen]]

'''Entomophily''' or '''insect pollination''' is a form of [[pollination]] whereby [[pollen]] of plants, especially but not only of  [[flowering plant]]s, is distributed by [[insect]]s. Flowers pollinated by insects typically [[advertising in biology|advertise themselves]] with bright colours, sometimes with conspicuous patterns (honey guides) leading to rewards of pollen and [[nectar]]; they may also have an attractive scent which in some cases [[mimicry|mimics]] insect [[pheromone]]s. Insect pollinators such as [[bee]]s have adaptations for their role, such as lapping or sucking mouthparts to take in nectar, and in some species also pollen baskets on their hind legs. This required the [[coevolution]] of insects and flowering plants in the development of pollination behaviour by the insects and pollination mechanisms by the flowers, benefiting both groups.

Many plants, including flowering plants such as [[Poaceae|grasses]], are instead [[Pollination syndrome|pollinated by other mechanisms]], such as by wind.

==Coevolution==
{{further|Coevolution}}

===History===
[[File:Flowers-of-Israel-ver006.jpg|thumb|The insect-pollinated [[flower]]s of [[angiosperm]]s use a combination of cues such as bright colours and streaked patterns to advertise themselves to insects.]]

The early [[spermatophyte]]s (seed plants) were largely dependent on the wind to carry their pollen from one plant to another, and it was around 125 to 115 million years ago that a new pollination strategy developed and [[Flowering plant|angiosperm]]s (flowering plants) first appeared. Before that, insect involvement in pollination was limited to "pollination assistants", insects which inadvertently carried the pollen between plants merely by their movements. The real relationship between plants and insects began in the [[Early Cretaceous]], with [[beetle]]-pollinated [[gymnosperms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://archaeologynewsnetwork.blogspot.hk/2017/03/mid-mesozoic-beetle-in-amber-stirs.html#8pw5OWDAkErLezJK.97 |title=Mid-Mesozoic beetle in amber stirs questions on rise of flowering plants and pollinators |publisher=The Archaeology News Network |date=2 March 2017 |accessdate=3 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The morphology of the first fossil basal angiosperms is similar to modern-day plants that are also fertilised by beetles. It seems likely that beetles led the way in insect pollination, followed by flies. Among the twelve living families of basal angiosperms, six are predominantly pollinated by flies, five by beetles and only one by bees. Nevertheless, traits such as [[Pollination syndrome#Fly pollination (myophily and sapromyophily)|sapromyophily]] (emitting the odour of [[carrion]] to attract flies) have evolved independently in several unrelated angiosperm families.&lt;ref name=McGhee&gt;{{cite book |author=McGhee, George R. |title=Convergent Evolution: Limited Forms Most Beautiful |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QwDSr1qdqXUC&amp;pg=PA118 |year=2011 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-01642-1 |pages=118–120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The plant's needs===

Wind and water pollination require the production of vast quantities of pollen because of the chancy nature of its deposition. If they are not to be reliant on the wind or water (for aquatic species), plants need pollinators to move their pollen grains from one plant to another. They particularly need pollinators to consistently choose flowers of the same species, so they have evolved different lures to encourage specific pollinators to maintain fidelity to the same species. The attractions offered are mainly nectar, pollen, fragrances and oils. The ideal pollinating insect is hairy (so that pollen adheres to it), and spends time exploring the flower so that it comes into contact with the reproductive structures.&lt;ref name=Kimsey/&gt;

===Mechanisms===
Many insects are [[pollinator]]s, particularly [[bee]]s, [[Lepidoptera]] ([[butterfly|butterflies]] and [[moth]]s), [[wasp]]s, [[fly|flies]], [[ant]]s and [[beetle]]s.&lt;ref name=Kimsey&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ccuh.ucdavis.edu/Events/ysb-series/ysb-2015/3-pollinators-we-never-talk-about-l-kimsey/view |title=Pollinators We Never Talk About |author=Kimsey, L. |publisher=University of California, Davis: College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences |accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, some plants are generalists, being pollinated by insects in several orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seer.ufu.br/index.php/biosciencejournal/article/view/7197 |title=Entomofauna associated to the floration of ''Schinus terebinthifolius'' Raddi (Anacardiaceae) in the Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil = Entomofauna associada à floração de Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi (Anacardiaceae) no Estado do Rio Grande do Sul, Brasil &amp;#124; Somavilla &amp;#124; |publisher=Seer.ufu.br |accessdate=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entomophilous plant species have frequently evolved mechanisms to make themselves more appealing to insects, e.g., brightly coloured or scented [[flower]]s, [[nectar]], or appealing shapes and patterns. Pollen grains of entomophilous plants are generally larger than the fine pollens of [[Anemophily|anemophilous]] (wind-pollinated) plants, which has to be produced in much larger quantities because such a high proportion is wasted. This is energetically costly, but in contrast, entomophilous plants have to bear the energetic costs of producing nectar.&lt;ref name=Pijl/&gt;

[[File:GardenSphinx-20April15.jpg|thumb|[[Hyles lineata|Hummingbird moth]] on ''[[Clarkia]]'']]
Butterflies and moths have hairy bodies and long [[proboscis|proboscides]] which can probe deep into tubular flowers. Butterflies mostly fly by day and are particularly attracted to pink, mauve and purple flowers. The flowers are often large and scented, and the stamens are so-positioned that pollen is deposited on the insects while they feed on the nectar. Moths are mostly nocturnal and are attracted by night-blooming plants. The flowers of these are often tubular, pale in colour and fragrant only at night. [[Sphingidae|Hawkmoths]] tend to visit larger flowers and hover as they feed; they transfer pollen by means of the proboscis. Other moths land on the usually smaller flowers, which may be aggregated into flowerheads. Their energetic needs are not so great as those of hawkmoths and they are offered smaller quantities of nectar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Oliveira, P.E. |author2=Gibbs, P.E. |author3=Barbosa, A.A. |year=2004 |title=Moth pollination of woody species in the Cerrados of Central Brazil: a case of so much owed to so few? |journal=Plant Systematics and Evolution |volume=245 |issue=1–2 |pages=41–54 |doi=10.1007/s00606-003-0120-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inflorescences pollinated by beetles tend to be flat with open corollas or small flowers clustered in a head with multiple, projecting anthers that shed pollen readily.&lt;ref name=Kimsey/&gt; The flowers are often green or pale-coloured, and heavily scented, often with fruity or spicy aromas, but sometimes with odours of decaying organic matter. Some, like the [[Victoria amazonica|giant water lily]], include traps designed to retain the beetles in contact with the reproductive parts for longer periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Prance, Ghillean T.|title=The Earth Under Threat: A Christian Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0fpKWEA4BfAC&amp;pg=PA14 |year=1996 |publisher=Wild Goose Publications |isbn=978-0-947988-80-7| page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hoverfly October 2007-8.jpg|thumb|Female hoverfly ''[[Dasysyrphus albostriatus]]'']]
Unspecialised flies with short proboscides are found visiting primitive flowers with readily accessible nectar. More specialised flies like [[syrphid]]s and [[tabanid]]s can visit more advanced blooms, but their purpose is to nourish themselves, and any transfer of pollen from one flower to another happens haphazardly. The small size of many flies is often made up for by their abundance, however they are unreliable pollinators as they may bear incompatible pollen, and lack of suitable breeding habitats may limit their activities. Some ''[[Pterostylis]]'' orchids are pollinated by midges unique to each species. A decline, for whatever reason, to one side of this partnership can be catastrophic for the other.&lt;ref name=Faegri/&gt;

Flowers pollinated by bees and wasps vary in shape, colour and size. Yellow or blue plants are often visited, and flowers may have  ultra-violet nectar guides, that help the insect to find the nectary. Some flowers, like sage or pea, have lower lips that will only open when sufficiently heavy insects, such as bees, land on them. With the lip depressed, the anthers may bow down to deposit pollen on the insect's back. Other flowers, like tomato, may only liberate their pollen by [[buzz pollination]], a technique in which a [[bumblebee]] will cling on to a flower while vibrating its flight muscles, and this dislodges the pollen. Because bees care for their brood, they need to collect more food than just to maintain themselves, and therefore are important pollinators.&lt;ref name=Faegri&gt;{{cite book|author1=Faegri, K.|author2=Van Der Pijl, L.|title=Principles of Pollination Ecology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3zfLBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA102 |year=2013 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-1-4832-9303-5 |pages=102–110}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Other bees are nectar thieves and bite their way through the corolla in order to raid the nectary, in the process bypassing the reproductive structures.&lt;ref name=Kimsey/&gt;

Ants are not well adapted to pollination but they have been shown to perform this function in ''[[Polygonum cascadense]]'' and in certain desert plants with small blossoms near the ground with little fragrance or visual attraction, small quantities of nectar and limited quantities of sticky pollen.&lt;ref name=Faegri/&gt;

===Plant-insect pairings===
[[File:Bee orchid, former Barton Tip - geograph.org.uk - 850728.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Ophrys apifera|bee orchid]] mimics bees in appearance and scent, implying close coevolution of a species of flower and a species of insect.]]

Some plant species [[coevolution|co-evolved]] with a particular pollinator species, such as the [[Ophrys apifera|bee orchid]]. The species is almost exclusively [[self-pollination|self-pollinating]] in its northern ranges, but is pollinated by the [[solitary bee]] ''[[Eucera]]'' in the Mediterranean area. The plant attracts these insects by producing a scent that mimics the scent of the female bee. In addition, the lip acts as a decoy, as the male bee confuses it with a female that is visiting a pink flower. Pollen transfer occurs during the ensuing [[pseudocopulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fenster |first1=Charles B.|last2=Marten-Rodriguez |first2=Silvana |title=Reproductive Assurance And The Evolution Of Pollination Specialization |journal=International Journal of Plant Sciences |date=2007 |volume=168 |issue=2 |pages=215–228 |url=http://www.life.umd.edu/biology/fensterlab/PDF/Reproductive%20Assurance%20Reveiw.pdf |doi=10.1086/509647}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Syconium ficus glomerata.JPG|160 px|left|thumb|Cross section of a ''[[Ficus glomerata]]'' (fig) fruit showing the [[syconium]] with pollinating [[fig wasp]]s inside.]]

Figs in the genus ''[[Ficus]]'' have a [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] arrangement with certain tiny [[Agaonidae|agaonid]] wasps. In the [[common fig]], the inflorescence is a [[syconium]], formed by an enlarged, fleshy, hollow [[Receptacle (botany)|receptacle]] with multiple [[Ovary (botany)|ovaries]] on the inner surface. A female wasp enters through a narrow aperture, fertilises these pistillate flowers and lays its eggs in some ovaries, with galls being formed by the developing larvae. In due course, staminate flowers develop inside the syconium. Wingless male wasps hatch and mate with females in the galls before tunnelling their way out of the developing fruit. The winged females, now laden with pollen, follow, flying off to find other receptive syconia at the right stage of development. Most species of fig have their own unique [[Commensalism|commensal]] species of wasp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Faegri, K.|author2=Van Der Pijl, L. |title=Principles of Pollination Ecology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3zfLBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA176 |year= 2013|publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-1-4832-9303-5 |pages=176–177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

The word is artificially derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: εντομο-, ''entomo-''&lt;ref name="Liddell 1980"&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Henry George Liddell|Liddell, Henry George]] and [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Robert Scott]] | year = 1980 | title = [[A Greek-English Lexicon]] (Abridged Edition) | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | location = United Kingdom | isbn = 0-19-910207-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; "cut in pieces, segmented", hence "insect"; and [[wikt:φίλη|φίλη]], ''phile'', "loved".

==Taxonomic range==

Wind pollination is the reproductive strategy adopted by the [[Poaceae|grasses]], [[Cyperaceae|sedges]], [[Juncaceae|rushes]] and [[catkin]]-bearing plants. Other flowering plants are mostly pollinated by insects (or birds or bats), which seems to be the primitive state, and some plants have secondarily developed wind pollination. Some plants that are wind pollinated have vestigial nectaries, and other plants like [[Calluna|common heather]] that are regularly pollinated by insects, produce clouds of pollen and some wind pollination is inevitable. The [[Plantago media|hoary plantain]] is primarily wind pollinated, but is also visited by insects which pollinate it.&lt;ref name=Pijl&gt;{{cite book|author1=Faegri, K.|author2=Van Der Pijl, L. |title=Principles of Pollination Ecology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3zfLBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA34 |year=2013|publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-1-4832-9303-5 |pages=34–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, showy, colourful, fragrant flowers like [[Helianthus|sunflowers]], [[Orchidaceae|orchids]] and ''[[Buddleja]]'' are insect pollinated. The only entomophilous plants that are not seed plants are the dung-mosses of the family [[Splachnaceae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Goffinet, Bernard |author2=Shaw,  A.

Tanselle held fellowships from the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation]] (1969–70), [[American Council of Learned Societies]] (1973-74), and the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] (1977–78).&lt;ref name=nypl/&gt;

==Theories of textual editing and influence==
Tanselle absorbed the principles of [[Walter W. Greg]] and [[Fredson Bowers]], who developed the theory of [[textual criticism]], a branch of textual scholarship, philology, and literary criticism that is concerned with the identification and removal of transcription errors in texts, both manuscripts and printed books, in order to create a text which most closely reflects the author's intent. He has been called the "most prominent, consistent, and authoritative defender of the Greg-Bowers approach to editing," which is now the "dominant theoretical and practical position in Anglo-American editing." Tanselle has sought to accommodate legitimate critiques of its limitations, such as the insistence on the difference between substantive and accidentals, that is, the difference between the words and their spelling and punctuation. {{sfnb|Groden|1991|p=263}} Tanselle, says one scholar, like Greg and Bowers,  postulates the notion of an "ideal 'correct' text, measured against which extant texts show various degrees of 'corruption' that the editor seeks to remove." Tanselle follows this tradition more flexibly, but still comes to rest on the "principle of the author's final intention,'" which the "editor (or critic) seeks first to understand and then to implement..." This position is opposed to the [[New Criticism]], which rejects the [[intentional fallacy]], since the author's intentions are not relevant to the work of art once it is finished.{{sfnb|Bornstein|1991|p=5}}

He then applied these principles to the study of American literature. {{sfnb|Tanselle|1975}} He was particularly active as textual editor for the [[Herman Melville bibliography|Northwestern-Newberry]] edition of the works of [[Herman Melville]] to make a [[Textual criticism#Process|critical edition]], as approved by [[Textual criticism#The MLA's CEAA and CSE|The Center for Scholarly Editions]]. {{sfnb|Tanselle|1968}}

'''George Bowman''', or '''Bo Mun''' Soen sa Nim, is a [[Zen]] master and licensed [[psychotherapist]] living at [[Furnace Mountain]] in [[Clay City, Kentucky]] (he does not teach there). He received [[Dharma transmission]] from [[Seung Sahn]] Soen Sa Nim in 1992, and is a former teacher in the [[Kwan Um School of Zen]]. He was a founding member of the [[Providence Zen Center]] in 1972 and also did [[koan]] study with [[Joshu Sasaki]] from 1977 to 2003. Furnace Mountain is run by [[Dae Gak]] Soen Sa Nim—another former Kwan Um line teacher. He was a resident teacher at the [[Cambridge Buddhist Association]] from 1991 to 1999, and in 1994 became a guiding teacher of the Institute for Meditation and Psychotherapy. Today he travels to [[Boston, Massachusetts]] most months to lead a "floating [[zendo]]" named the Single Flower Sangha. Bowman has given [[Dharma transmission|inka]] to his student [[David Dayan Rynick]], who was the first individual to be acknowledged as a teacher outside of the Kwan Um lineage.&lt;ref name="ash"&gt;Ash&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ford"&gt;Ford, 106&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="prebish"&gt;Prebish, 34, 156&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hoffman"&gt;Hoffman, 49&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Institute for Economics and Peace Logo.svg|thumb|The [[Institute for Economics and Peace]] produces the Global Peace Index]]
'''Global Peace Index''' ('''GPI''') measures the relative position of nations' and regions' peacefulness.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://visionofhumanity.org/app/uploads/2017/06/GPI17-Report.pdf|title=Global Peace Index 2017|last=Institute for Economics and Peace|date=|website=visionofhumanity.org|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GPI ranks 163 independent states and territories according to their levels of peacefulness.

The GPI is a report produced by the [[Institute for Economics and Peace]] (IEP) and developed in consultation with an international panel of peace experts from peace institutes and [[think tank]]s with data collected and collated by the [[Economist Intelligence Unit]]. The Index was first launched in May 2007, with subsequent reports being released annually. It is claimed to be the first study to rank countries around the world according to their peacefulness. In 2017 it ranked 163 countries, up from 121 in 2007. In the past decade, the GPI has presented trends of increased global violence and less peacefulness.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/monicawang/2016/06/17/the-worlds-most-and-least-peaceful-countries-in-2016/#24c9f81a644f|title=The World's Most And Least Peaceful Countries In 2016|last=Wang|first=Monica|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-11-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study is the brainchild of Australian technology entrepreneur [[Steve Killelea]], founder of Integrated Research, and is endorsed by individuals such as former UN Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]], [[14th Dalai Lama|the Dalai Lama]], archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]], former President of Finland and 2008 Nobel Peace Prize laureate [[Martti Ahtisaari]], Nobel laureate [[Muhammad Yunus]], economist [[Jeffrey Sachs]], former president of Ireland [[Mary Robinson]], former Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations [[Jan Eliasson]] and former United States president [[Jimmy Carter]]. The updated index is released each year at events in London, Washington, DC; and at the United Nations Secretariat in New York between many others.

The GPI gauges global peace using three broad themes: the level of societal safety and security, the extent of ongoing domestic and international conflict and the degree of militarization.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Factors are both internal such as levels of violence and crime within the country and external such as [[Military budget|military expenditure]] and wars. It has been criticised by [[Riane Eisler]] for not including indicators specifically relating to violence against women and children, however reliable international data on these subjects is either unavailable or very sparsely reported in many countries.

The 2017 GPI indicates [[Iceland]], [[New Zealand]], [[Portugal]], [[Austria]], and [[Denmark]] to be the most peaceful countries and [[Syria]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Iraq]], [[South Sudan]], and [[Yemen]] to be the least peaceful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://visionofhumanity.org/indexes/global-peace-index/|title=Global Peace Index Map|last=Institute for Economics and Peace|first=|date=|work=Vision of Humanity|access-date=2017-11-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Long-term findings of the 2017 GPI include a less peaceful world over the past decade, a 2.14 per cent deterioration in the global level of peace in the past decade, growing inequality in peace between the most and least peaceful countries, a long-term reduction in the GPI Militarization domain, and a widening impact of terrorism, with historically high numbers of people killed in terrorist incidents over the past 5 years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Expert panel ==
The expert panel for the 2016 and 2017 GPI consisted of:

* [[Kevin P. Clements|Professor Kevin P. Clements]], ''Foundation Chair of Peace and Conflict Studies and Director, National Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies, University of Otago, New Zealand''
* [[Sabina Alkire|Dr Sabina Alkire]], ''Director, Oxford Poverty &amp; Human Development Initiative (OPHI), University of Oxford, United Kingdom''
* Dr Ian Anthony, ''Research Coordinator and Director of the Programme on Arms Control, Disarmament and Non-proliferation, Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), Sweden''
* Ms Isabelle Arrandon, ''Director of Research and Deputy Director of Communications &amp; Outreach, International Crisis Group, Belgium''
* Dr Manuela Mesa, ''Director, Centre for Education and Peace Research (CEIPAZ) and President, Spanish Association for Peace Research (AIPAZ), Madrid, Spain''
* Mr Nick Grono, ''CEO, The Freedom Fund, United Kingdom''
* Dr Ekaterina Stepanova, ''Head, Unit on Peace and Conflict Studies, Institute of the World Economy and International Relations (IMEMO), Russian Academy of Sciences, Russia''

== Methodology ==
In assessing peacefulness, the GPI investigates the extent to which countries are involved in ongoing domestic and international conflicts. It also seeks to evaluate the level of harmony or discord within a nation; ten indicators broadly assess what might be described as a safety and security in society. The assertion is that low crime rates, minimal incidences of terrorist acts and violent demonstrations, harmonious relations with neighboring countries, a stable political scene and a small proportion of the population being internally displaced or refugees can be suggestive of peacefulness.

In 2017, 23 indicators were used to establish each country's peacefulness score. The indicators were originally selected with the assistance of an expert panel in 2007 and are reviewed by the expert panel on an annual basis. The scores for each indicator are normalized on a scale of 1-5, whereby qualitative indicators are banded into five groupings and quantitative ones are scored from 1-5, to the third decimal point. A table of the indicators is below.&lt;ref&gt;Information about indicators and methodology "2013 Global Peace Index"(PDF). Institute for Economics and Peace.

Indicators not already ranked on a 1 to 5 scale were converted by using the following formula: x=(x-Min(x))/(Max(x)-Min(x)) where Max(x) and Min(x) are the highest and lowest values for that indicator of the countries ranked in the index. The 0 to 1 scores that resulted were then converted to the 1 to 5 scale. Individual indicators were then weighted according to the expert panel's judgment of their importance. The scores were then tabulated into two weighted sub-indices: internal peace, weighted at 60% of a country's final score, and external peace, weighted at 40% of a country's final score. ‘Negative Peace’ which is defined as the absence of violence, or fear of violence is used as the definition of peace to create the Global Peace Index. An additional aim of the GPI database is to facilitate deeper study of the concept of positive peace, or those attitudes, institutions, and structures that drive peacefulness in society. The GPI also examines relationships between peace and reliable international measures, including democracy and transparency, education and material well-being. As such, it seeks to understand the relative importance of a range of potential determinants, or "drivers", which may influence the nurturing of peaceful societies, both internally and externally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://visionofhumanity.org/app/uploads/2017/06/GPI17-Report.pdf|title=Global Peace Index Report, Methodology, pg. 113-136|last=Institute for Economics and Peace|date=|website=Visionofhumanity.org|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main findings of the 2017 Global Peace Index are:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* The overall score for the 2017 GPI improved slightly this year due to gains in six of the nine geographical regions represented. More countries improved their levels of peacefulness, than deteriorated: 93 compared to 68.
* Peacebuilding activities can be highly cost-effective, providing cost savings 16 times the cost of the intervention.
* The global economic impact of violence was $14.3 trillion PPP in 2016, equivalent to 12.6 per cent of global GDP, or $1,953 per person. 
*  In Low-Peace environments, the factors that matter the most are related to Well-Functioning Government, Low Levels of Corruption, Acceptance of the Rights of Others and Good Relations with Neighbours
* Due to armed conflict in MENA, many related indicators such as deaths from internal conflict, number of refugees and IDPs, and organised internal conflict are at high levels.
* Safety and Security improved due to many countries recording a lower homicide rate and lower levels of political terror.

Statistical analysis is applied to GPI data to uncover specific conditions conducive of peace. Researchers have determined that Positive Peace, which includes the attitudes, institutions, and structures that pre-empt conflict and facilitate functional societies, is the main driver of peace. The eight pillars of positive peace are well-functioning government, sound business environment, acceptance of the rights of others, good relations with neighbors, free flow of information, high levels of human capital, low levels of corruption, and equitable distribution of resources. Well-functioning government, low levels of corruption, acceptance of the rights of others and good relations with neighbours are more important in countries suffering from high levels of violence. Free flow of information and sound business environment become more important when a country is approaching the global average level of peacefulness, also described as the Mid-Peace level. Low levels of corruption is the only Pillar that is strongly significant across all three levels of peacefulness. This suggests it is an important transformational factor at all stages of nations’ development.

== International response to the GPI  ==
The Index has received endorsements as a political project from a number of major international figures, including the former Secretary-General of the United Nations [[Kofi Annan]], former President of Finland and 2008 Nobel Peace Prize laureate [[Martti Ahtisaari]], the [[Dalai Lama]], archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]], [[Muhammad Yunus]], and former United States President [[Jimmy Carter]]&lt;ref&gt;"Endorsers for GPI" (PDF). Vision of Humanity. Retrieved 2013-08-16.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steve Killelea]] A.M., the Australian philanthropist who conceived the idea of the Index, argues that the Index "is a wake-up call for leaders around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/6704767.stm|title=Norway rated most peaceful nation|date=2007-05-30|access-date=2017-11-27|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Index has been widely recognized. Professor [[Jeffrey Sachs]], Director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University said: "The GPI continues its pioneering work in drawing the world’s attention to the massive resources we are squandering in violence and conflict. The lives and money wasted in wars, incarcerations, weapons systems, weapons trade, and more, could be directed to ending poverty, promoting education, and protecting the environment. The GPI will not only draw attention to these crucial issues, but help us understand them and to invest productively in a more peaceful world.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.philstockworld.com/2010/06/08/global-peace-index-world-less-peaceful-in-2010-report-violence-impacting-global-economy-7-trillion-annually/|title=Global Peace Index: World Less Peaceful in 2010 Report, Violence Impacting Global Economy $7 Trillion Annually|work=Phil's Stock World|access-date=2017-11-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marla Mossman of the Peace Alliance Leadership Council said she believes that the measurements of the Global Peace Index can be useful for crafting government policy, helping governments to identify problems and develop practical and relevant policies. Furthermore, she said that she saw the Index indicators as, “the measurements of the health of the nation. So we really can take the temperature of the world: are we healthy? Do we have a fever?”&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sputniknews.com/world/201706021054260583-terrorism-conflicts-global-economy/|title=Terrorism, Conflicts Cost Over $14 Trillion to Global Economy|last=Sputnik|website=sputniknews.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the release of the 2015 GPI, Professor Sir Lawrence Freedman of King's College in London called the Index, “an extraordinarily useful body of information,” and its analysis “the best indicator of future conflict is past conflict. The challenge is how we break that cycle.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/departments/warstudies/news/newsrecords/gpi.aspx|title=King's College London -  2015 Global Peace Index: an increasingly divided world|website=www.kcl.ac.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Economist]]'', in publishing the first edition of the index in 2007, admitted that, "the index will run into some flak." Specifically, according to ''The Economist'', the weighting of military expenditure "may seem to give heart to freeloaders: countries that enjoy peace precisely because others (often the USA) care for their defense." The true utility of the index may lie not in its specific rankings of countries now, but in how those rankings change over time, thus tracking when and how countries become more or less peaceful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/9266967|title=Give peace a rating|date=2007-05-31|work=The Economist|access-date=2017-11-27|issn=0013-0613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the Economist suggested that “quantifying peace is a bit like trying to describe how happiness smells.” The publication admitted that the GPI has produced some “surprising results” and argued that “part of the appeal of the index is that readers can examine each of the variables in turn and think about how much weight to add to each.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2012/06/daily-chart-6|title=Give peace a score|work=The Economist|access-date=2017-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian National University says that the GPI report “presents the latest and most comprehensive global data on trends in peace, violence and war” and “provides the world’s best analysis of the statistical factors associated with long-term peace as well as economic analysis on the macroeconomic impacts of everyday violence and war on the global economy.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.anu.edu.au/events/giving-peace-a-chance-2017-global-peace-index|title=Giving peace a chance? 2017 Global Peace Index|date=2017-06-09|work=ANU|access-date=2017-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GPI has been criticised for not including indicators specifically relating to violence against women and children. Back in 2007, [[Riane Eisler]], writing in the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'', argued that, "to put it mildly, this blind spot makes the index very inaccurate. She mentions a number of specific cases, including [[Egypt]], where she claims 90% of women are subject to [[Female genital mutilation|genital mutilation]], and [[China]], where, she says, "female infanticide is still a problem," according to a 2000 [[UNICEF]] study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0726/p09s01-coop.html|title=Dark underbelly of the world's most 'peaceful' countries|date=2007-07-26|work=Christian Science Monitor|access-date=2017-11-27|issn=0882-7729}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Senior Analyst at the Institute for Near East and Gulf Military Analysis, Sabhat Khan, argued that the Index should “involve more context on security environments.” Referring to the UAE's GPI ranking in particular, Khan argued that “the measurement usually used by such rankings is crude data without contextualising them;”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenational.ae/uae/government/uae-drops-in-rank-in-annual-peace-index-amid-increasing-regional-violence-1.43077|title=UAE drops in rank in annual peace index amid increasing regional violence|work=The National|access-date=2017-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, the UAE must bolster its security apparatus to respond to turbulence in neighbouring countries such as Iraq, Syria, and Yemen, which all rank at the very bottom of the GPI.

== World leaders talking about the GPI ==
During a Peace Forum in August 2017, Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez said that “receiving such high praise from an institute that once named this country the most violent in the world is extremely significant…My administration will keep fighting to protect all Honduran citizens.” The President has recently launched an initiative to build a series of safe parks across Honduras and hopes to see further improvement reflected in future GPI rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/honduras-peace-forum-marks-national-progress-in-crime-prevention-300510731.html|title=Honduras Peace Forum Marks National Progress in Crime Prevention|last=Honduras|first=Republic of|website=www.prnewswire.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malaysia ranked 29th in the 2017 GPI. The country's Communications and Multimedia Minister, Datuk Seri Salleh Said Keruak said that this ranking along with Malaysia's high place in the 2017 World Happiness Report was proof that the “government’s efforts have made Malaysia a safe and prosperous country.” He also admitted, “there’s still much room for improvement to make Malaysia the best among the better countries and that’s what we’re doing now.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2017/07/254778/2017-global-peace-index-and-world-happiness-report-shows-opposition|title=2017 Global Peace Index and World Happiness Report shows Opposition leaders were wrong|date=2017-07-05|work=NST Online|access-date=2017-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the release of the 2016 GPI, the Botswanan Office of the President released a proud statement, “in this year’s Index, Botswana was ranked as 28 out of 163 countries, up 3 places from last year. This continues to place Botswana above over half of the European region countries surveyed as well as all five of the Permanent Members of the United Nations Security Council…in addition Botswana was one of only five countries, to achieve a perfect score in the domestic and international conflict domain.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://botswana-brussels.com/2016-global-peace-index-released-botswana-moves-up-3-places-still-ranked-among-the-worlds-most-peaceful-nations/|title=2016 Global Peace Index released-Botswana moves up 3 places; still ranked among the world's most peaceful nations – Embassy of the Republic of Botswana|website=botswana-brussels.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Navid Hanif, Director of the United Nations Office for ECOSOC Support and Coordination said, “it’s intuitive that peace is useful and peacefullness is a reward in itself, but the IEP is trying to make the conclusion more evidence-based. Now that the index covers 99% of the population, it has come a long way. The report systemically measures peacefulness and identifies the determinants of peace.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/news/ecosoc/2012gpi.html|title=Global Peace Index: Nine trillion reasons to pursue peace  {{!}} UN DESA {{!}} United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs|website=www.un.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reacting to the 2017 results of the GPI, which ranked the Philippines 138 out of 163 countries, mainly because of poor scores in societal safety and security due to President Duterte's war on drugs, Philippine Presidential spokesman Ernesto Abella countered, “We’re not entirely sure where the GPI, Global Peace Index analyst… who apparently is supposed to be a local, is really coming from. Maybe there’s a political slant somewhere…based on survey results, the net satisfaction of Filipino people is quite high.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/philippines/the-philippine-star/20170610/281552290835307|title=Palace Disputes Peace Index Report|last=Romero|first=A|date=|website=www.pressreader.com|access-date=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sierra Leone ranked 39th in the 2017 Global Peace Index. Former Chief of Staff and Office of National Security (ONS) advisor, Dr. Jonathan PJ Sandy, “Welcomed the 2017 Global Peace Index report released recently which ranked Sierra Leone in first position, as the most peaceful country in West Africa and third in the African continent…He observed that going by the report itself, [future] elections might be successfully held.” Presidential Spokesman, Abdulai Bayraytay “said the favourable Global Peace rating of Sierra Leone would serve as an impetus for the country to do more.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://slconcordtimes.com/jpj-sandy-praises-global-peace-index-report/|title=JPJ Sandy Praises Global Peace Index Report|work=Sierra Leone Concord Times|access-date=2017-11-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global Peace Index rankings ==
Nations considered more peaceful have lower index scores. In 2013 researchers at the Institute for Economics and Peace harmonized the Global Peace Index database to ensure that the scores were comparable over time. The GPI Expert Panel decided that the Index would include nations and territories, but not [[Ministate|micro-states]]. Countries covered by the GPI must either have a population of more than 1 million or a land area greater than 20,000 square kilometers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{emotion}}

'''Hatred''' or '''hate''' is a [[human]] [[emotion]]. Hatred could invoke feelings of [[wikt:animosity|animosity]], [[anger]] or [[resentment]], which can be directed against certain individuals, [[Social group|group]]s, [[entity|entities]], objects, [[behavior]]s, [[concept]]s, or [[idea]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Reber, A.S., &amp; Reber, E. (2002). ''The Penguin dictionary of psychology''. New York: [[Penguin Books]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Hatred is often associated with feelings of [[anger]], [[disgust]] and a [[disposition]] towards the source of [[hostility]].

== As emotion ==
As an emotion, hatred can be short-lived or long-lasting.&lt;ref&gt;Y Ito ed., ''Encyclopedia of Emotion'' (2010) p. 302&lt;/ref&gt; It can be of low intensity - 'I hate broccoli' - or high intensity: 'I hate the whole world'.&lt;ref&gt;S Kucuk, ''Brand Hate'' (2016) p. 12-3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Steinberg]] saw three main elements in hatred: 
# a negation of intimacy, by creating distance when closeness had become threatening; 
# an infusion of passion, such as fear or anger; 
# a decision to devalue a previously valued object.&lt;ref&gt;Y Ito ed., ''Encyclopedia of Emotion'' (2010) p. 302&lt;/ref&gt;
The important self-protective function, to be found in hatred,&lt;ref&gt;I Craib, ''Psychoanalysis'' (Cambridge 2001) p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; can be illustrated by Steinberg's analysis of 'mutinous' hatred, whereby a dependent relationship is repudiated in a quest for autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;Y Ito ed., ''Encyclopedia of Emotion'' (2010) p. 303&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Psychoanalytic views ==
[[Dr. Sigmund Freud|Sigmund Freud]] defined hate as an ego state that wishes to destroy the source of its unhappiness, stressing that it was linked to the question of self-preservation.&lt;ref&gt;S Freud, 'The instincts and their vicissitudes' (1915) in ''On Metapsychology (PFL 11) p. 135-5.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donald Winnicott]] highlighted the developmental step involved in hatred, with its recognition of an outside object: "As compared to magical destruction, aggressive ideas and behaviour take on a positive value, and hate becomes a sign of civilization".&lt;ref&gt;D W Winnicott, ''The Child, the Family, and the Outside World'' (Penguin 1973) p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

In his wake, [[Object relations theory]] has emphasised the importance of recognising hate in the analytic setting: the analyst acknowledges his own hate (as revealed in the strict time-limits and the fee charged),&lt;ref&gt;J Malcolm, ''Psychoanalysis'' (London 1988) p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn may make it possible for the patient to acknowledge and contain ''their'' previously concealed hate for the analyst.&lt;ref&gt;I Craib, ''Psychoanalysis'' (Cambridge 2001) p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adam Phillips (psychologist)|Adam Phillips]] went so far as to suggest that true kindness is impossible in a relationship without hating and being hated, so that an unsentimental acknowledgement of interpersonal frustrations and their associated hostilities can allow real fellow-feeling to emerge.&lt;ref&gt;A Phillips/B Taylor, ''On Kindness'' (London 2004) p. 93-4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues==
In the English language, a [[hate crime]] (also known as a "bias-motivated crime") generally refers to [[crime|criminal acts]] which are seen to have been motivated by hate. Those who commit hate crimes target victims because of their perceived membership in a certain [[social group]], usually defined by [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[gender]], [[religion]], [[sexual orientation]], [[mental disorder]], [[disability]], [[Social class|class]], [[ethnicity]], [[nationality]], [[Ageing|age]], [[gender identity]], or [[political affiliation]].&lt;ref name="williams"&gt;Stotzer, R.: [http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Stotzer-Comparison-Hate-Crime-June-2007.pdf Comparison of Hate Crime Rates Across Protected and Unprotected Groups], [[Williams Institute]], 2007–06. Retrieved on 2007-08-09.&lt;/ref&gt; Incidents may involve [[physical assault]], [[destruction of property]], [[bullying]], [[harassment]], [[verbal abuse]] or [[insults]], or offensive graffiti or letters ([[hate mail]]).&lt;ref name="ovrbwx"&gt;[http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/crime-victims/reducing-crime/hate-crime/ Hate crime] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051126000000/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/crime-victims/reducing-crime/hate-crime/ |date=November 26, 2005 }}, [[Home Office]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hate speech]] is speech perceived to disparage a person or group of people based on their social or ethnic group,&lt;ref name="Dictionary.com: Hate speech"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hate%20speech |title=Dictionary.com: Hate speech |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[sex]], [[Ageing|age]], [[ethnicity]], [[nationality]], [[religion]], [[sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]], [[mental disorder]], [[disability]], [[language]] ability, [[ideology]], [[social class]], occupation, appearance (height, weight, skin color, etc.), mental capacity, and any other distinction that might be considered a liability. The term covers written as well as oral communication and some forms of behaviors in a public setting. It is also sometimes called [[antilocution]] and is the first point on [[Allport's scale]] which measures [[prejudice]] in a society. In many countries, deliberate use of hate speech is a [[criminal offence]] prohibited under ''incitement to hatred'' legislation.  It is often alleged that the criminalization of hate speech is sometimes used to discourage legitimate discussion of negative aspects of voluntary behavior (such as political persuasion, religious adherence and philosophical allegiance). There is also some question as to whether or not hate speech falls under the protection of freedom of speech in some countries.

Both of these classifications have sparked debate, with counter-arguments such as, but not limited to, a difficulty in distinguishing motive and intent for crimes, as well as philosophical debate on the validity of valuing targeted hatred as a greater crime than general [[misanthropy]] and contempt for humanity being a potentially equal crime in and of itself.

== Neurological research ==
The neural correlates of hate have been investigated with an [[fMRI]] procedure. In this experiment, people had their brains scanned while viewing pictures of people they hated. The results showed increased activity in the [[middle frontal gyrus]], right [[putamen]], bilaterally in the [[premotor cortex]], in the [[frontal pole]], and bilaterally in the medial [[insular cortex]] of the [[human brain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Zeki, S. |author2=Romaya, J.P. |date=October 2008 |url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0003556;jsessionid=0C68BB34FD6B6212E02B082F9B250990 |title=Neural Correlates of Hate |journal=[[PLoS ONE]] |volume=3 |issue=10 |pages=e3556 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0003556 |pmid=18958169 |pmc=2569212 |authorlink1=Semir Zeki |editor1-last=Lauwereyns |editor1-first=Jan |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103151609/http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0003556;jsessionid=0C68BB34FD6B6212E02B082F9B250990 |archivedate=January 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethnolinguistics==
Hate, like love, takes different shapes and forms in different languages.&lt;ref&gt;James W. Underhill, ''[[Ethnolinguistics]] and Cultural Concepts: truth, love, hate &amp; war'', (2012) p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; While it may be fair to say that one single emotion exists in [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]] (haine), and [[German language|German]] (Hass), hate is historically situated and culturally constructed: it varies in the forms in which it is manifested. Thus a certain relationless hatred is expressed in the French expression ''J'ai la haine'', which has no precise equivalent in English; while for English-speakers, loving and hating invariably involve an object, or a person, and therefore, a relationship with something or someone, ''J'ai la haine'' (literally, I have hate) precludes the idea of an emotion directed at a person.&lt;ref&gt;James W. Underhill, ''[[Ethnolinguistics]] and Cultural Concepts: truth, love, hate &amp; war'', (2012) p. 161-2&lt;/ref&gt; This is a form of frustration, apathy and animosity which churns within the subject but establishes no relationship with the world, other than an aimless desire for destruction. 

French forms of [[anti-Americanism]] have been seen as a specific form of cultural resentment, registering joy-in-hate.&lt;ref&gt;James W. Underhill, ''[[Ethnolinguistics]] and Cultural Concepts: truth, love, hate &amp; war'', (2012) p. 173-181&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious perspectives==

===Old Testament===
The Hebrew word describing David's "perfect hatred" (KJV) means that it "brings a process to completion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=R Laird|title=Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament|date=10/01/2003|publisher=Moody Publishers; New Edition|isbn=0802486495}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary explications==
*[[W B Yeats]] had his (imaginary) hermit Ribh proclaim:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;I study hatred with great diligence,
For that's a passion in my own control,
A sort of besom that can clear the soul
Of everything that is not mind or sense."&lt;ref&gt;W. B. Yeats, ''The Poems'' (London 1983) p. 286&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*[[Doris Lessing]] considered there was a hate-region of the mind that could be tapped rather like a radio: "you discover hatred is a kind of wavelength you can tune into...''plugged into Hater''."&lt;ref&gt;D Lessing, ''The Four-Gated City'' (London 1993) p. 69 and p. 564&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Herman Hertzberger''' (born 6 July 1932) is one of the most famous [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[architect|architects]], [[professor]] [[emeritus]] and the last Dutch architect to receive the prestigious [[Royal Gold Medal]].

==Biography==
[[File:Hertzberger Centraal Beheer1.jpg|thumb|265px|[[Centraal Beheer]] office building, participation inside, [[Apeldoorn]] 1972]]
Herman Hertzberger was born on 6 July 1932 in [[Amsterdam]].&lt;ref name="archinform"&gt;{{archINFORM|arch|907}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He completed his studies at the [[Delft University of Technology]] in 1958, where he was a professor from 1970 to 1999.&lt;ref name="archinform"/&gt;

==Career==

===Structuralism===
Hertzberger can be considered, along with [[Aldo van Eyck]], as the influence behind the Dutch [[Structuralism (architecture)|structuralist]] movement of the 1960s and 1970s. Among Hertzberger's best known buildings are the experimetal houses known as "[http://www.diagoonwoningdelft.nl Diagoon" houses] (1971), the [[Montessori]] school in [[Delft]] (1966–70) and the administration building for the [[Centraal Beheer]] Insurance Company building in [[Apeldoorn]] (1970–72).
He believed that the architect's role was not to provide a complete solution, but to provide a spatial framework to be filled in by the users. This idea is coming from the [[Participatory design|Participation]] movement, initiated in 1961 by [[N. John Habraken|John Habraken]] with his book ''"Supports"''. Herman Hertzberger was one of the first architects, who produced architectural solutions with user participation. [[Centraal Beheer]] and the "Diagoon" houses are belonging to the most inspiring examples of the international Participation movement.

Insurance company Centraal Beheer has now left the building, and at the moment it is being converted into houses with roof gardens and various shared facilities. The starting point of Hertzberger - that the building can be used for multiple functions - can be tested with this.

===Books===
Hertzberger has written several books including ''Lessons for Students in Architecture'' published in 1991 ({{ISBN|978-9064504648}}), ''Space and the Architect: Lessons in Architecture 2'', 1999 ({{ISBN|978-9064503801}}) and ''Space and Learning'' in 2008 ({{ISBN|978-9064506444}}).

'''John Cartwright''' (17 September 1740 – 23 September 1824) was an [[England|English]] [[Royal Navy|naval]] officer, [[Nottinghamshire]] militia major and prominent campaigner for parliamentary reform. He subsequently became known as the '''Father of Reform'''. His younger brother [[Edmund Cartwright]] became famous as the inventor of the [[power loom]].

==Early life and naval career==
{{further|Great Britain in the Seven Years' War}}
He was born at [[Marnham]] in [[Nottinghamshire]], being the elder brother of [[Edmund Cartwright]], inventor of the [[power loom]] and the younger brother of [[George Cartwright (trader)|George Cartwright]], trader and explorer of [[Labrador]]. He was educated at [[Newark-on-Trent]] [[grammar school]] and Heath Academy in [[Yorkshire]], and at the age of eighteen entered the [[Royal Navy]].&lt;ref name="eb" /&gt;

He was present, in his first year of service, at the [[Raid on Cherbourg|capture of Cherbourg]], and served in the following year in the [[Battle of Quiberon Bay]] between Sir [[Edward Hawke]] and Admiral [[Hubert de Brienne]]. Engaged afterwards under Sir [[Hugh Palliser]] and Admiral [[John Byron]] on the [[Newfoundland Station]], he was appointed to act as chief magistrate of the settlement.  He served in the post for five years (1765–1770).&lt;ref name="eb" /&gt;

From 1763 to 14 May 1766, Cartwright was commander of [[HMS Sherborne (1763)|HM Cutter ''Sherborne'']].&lt;ref&gt;[[Tobias Smollett]]. January 1793. ''The Critical Review, or Annals of Literature''. (London: W. Simpkin and R. Marshal), pp. 32–33.&lt;/ref&gt; His brother George, when at loose ends, went with him on a cruise out of [[Plymouth]] to chase smugglers in ''Sherborne''.
[[File:John Cartwright statue(2).jpg|thumb|250px|left|Inscription from the Cartwright Gardens statue.]]
Ill-health necessitated Cartwright's retirement from active service for a time in 1771.

When the disputes with the American colonies began, he believed that the colonists had right on their side, warmly supported their cause and, at the outbreak of the ensuing [[American War of Independence]], refused an appointment as first lieutenant to the [[Prince Henry, Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn|Duke of Cumberland]].  Thus he gave up a path to certain promotion, since he did not wish to fight against the cause which he felt to be just.  
In 1774 he published his first plea on behalf of the colonists, entitled "American Independence the Glory and Interest of Great Britain."&lt;ref name="eb" /&gt;

He married in 1780. He adopted his niece [[Frances Dorothy Cartwright]], daughter of his brother Edmund.

==Nottinghamshire Militia and Reform==
In 1775, when the [[Nottinghamshire Militia]] was first raised, he was appointed major, and in this capacity he served for seventeen years. He was at last illegally superseded, because of his political opinions.

In 1776 appeared his first work on reform in parliament, which, with the exception of [[Charles Stanhope, 3rd Earl Stanhope|Earl Stanhope's]] pamphlets (1774), appears to have been the earliest publication on the subject. It was entitled, ''Take your Choice'', a second edition appearing under the new title of ''The Legislative Rights of the Commonalty Vindicated'', and advocated annual parliaments, the secret ballot and manhood [[suffrage]].&lt;ref name="eb" /&gt;

The task of his life was thenceforth chiefly the attainment of [[universal suffrage]] and annual parliaments. 
In 1778, he conceived the project of a political association, which took shape in 1780 as the [[Society for Constitutional Information]], including among its members some of the most distinguished men of the day. 
From this society sprang the more famous [[London Corresponding Society]]. 
Major Cartwright worked unweariedly for the promotion of reform. 
He was one of the witnesses on the trial of his friends, [[John Horne Tooke]], [[John Thelwall]] and [[Thomas Hardy (political reformer)|Thomas Hardy]], in 1794.&lt;ref name="eb" /&gt;
[[File:John Cartwright statue.jpg|thumb|220px|Statue of John Cartwright from Cartwright Gardens]]

He left his large estate in [[Lincolnshire]] in 1803&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wTQaAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA522 |year=1824 |title=John Cartwright, Esquire |journal=[[The New Monthly Magazine]] |volume=XII |issue=1 November |page=522 |publisher=Henry Colburn |accessdate=2011-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or 1805
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=wu.89053439170 | title=The Life and Correspondence of Major Cartwright | volume=1 | page=322 |first=Major John |last=Cartwright | editor-first=F D |editor-last=Cartwright |year=1826 |publisher=H Colburn |location=London }}&lt;/ref&gt; to move to [[Enfield Town|Enfield]], [[Middlesex]], where he made friends with other leading [[Radicalism (historical)|Radical]]s including [[Sir Francis Burdett, 5th Baronet]], [[William Cobbett]] and [[Francis Place]].

In 1812, he initiated the [[Hampden Club]]s, named after [[John Hampden]], an [[English Civil War]] Parliamentary leader, aiming to bring together middle class moderates and lower class radicals in the reform cause. To promote the idea, he toured northwest England later in 1812, in 1813 (getting arrested in [[Huddersfield]]) and in 1815. He recruited John Knight who founded the first Hampden Club in [[Lancashire]]. In 1818, Knight, John Saxton and [[James Wroe]] formed the reformist and popularist newspaper the ''[[Manchester Observer]]''. In 1819, the same team formed the Patriotic Union Society, which invited [[Henry Hunt (politician)|Henry "Orator" Hunt]] and Major Cartwright to speak at a reformist public rally in Manchester, but the elderly Cartwright was unable to attend what became the [[Peterloo Massacre]]. Later in 1819, Cartwright was arrested for speaking at a parliamentary reform meeting in [[Birmingham]], indicted for conspiracy and was condemned to pay a fine of £100.&lt;ref name="eb"&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Cartwright, John|volume=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cartwright then wrote ''The English Constitution'', which outlined his ideas including government by the people and legal equality which he considered could only be achieved by universal suffrage, the secret ballot and equal electoral districts. He became the main patron of the [[Radicalism (historical)|Radical]] publisher [[Thomas Jonathan Wooler]], best known for his satirical journal ''[[The Black Dwarf]]'', who actively supported Cartwright's campaigning.

Cartwright had sent a copy of ''The English Constitution'' to former [[President of the United States]], [[Thomas Jefferson]]. Jefferson wrote to Cartwright in July: &lt;blockquote&gt; "Your age of eighty-four, and mine of eighty-one years, ensure us a speedy meeting. We may then commune at leisure, and more fully, on the good and evil, which in the course of our long lives, we have both witnessed; and in the mean time, I pray you to accept assurances of my high veneration and esteem for your person and character".&lt;ref&gt;John W. Osborne, ''John Cartwright'' (Cambridge University Press, 1972), p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Industry==

In 1788, Major Cartwight sold his heavily mortgaged estates at [[Marnham]], buying others at [[Brothertoft]], [[Lincolnshire]].  The same year with 18 others, he erected a large mill at the bottom of Spital Hill in [[Retford]]. It was called the [[Revolution Mill]] in celebration of the centenary of the [[Glorious Revolution]].  He hoped to weave cloth using the [[weaving]] [[patent]]s of his brother [[Edmund Cartwright]].  He also began the mechanical spinning of [[wool]], or rather [[worsted]].  This business was not successful.  The mill stood idle within a few years and was advertised to sale in 1798 and 1805.&lt;ref&gt;W. H. Challoner, ''People and Industries'' (1963), 48–9.  S. D. Chapman, 'The Pioneers of worsted spinning by power' ''Business History'' 7(2) (1965), 103–5.&lt;/ref&gt; The mill was later largely demolished and only one building remains.

==Agriculture==
Cartwright took a keen interest in agricultural improvement and used his estate at Brothertoft to conduct crop trials and to develop new agricultural implements, several of which were invented by his bailiff and later estate steward, [[William Amos (agriculturist)|William Amos]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Young (writer)|Arthur Young]], ''General View of the Agriculture of Lincolnshire'', London, 2nd edn, 1813, pp.76–77, 163.&lt;/ref&gt; He also turned over a large part of his estate to the cultivation of [[woad]], creating dedicated buildings and improving the apparatus used to process the crop.&lt;ref&gt;Young, ''General View of Agriculture in Lincolnshire'', pp.174–182.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Cartwright died in London on 23 September 1824, and was buried at [[History of Church End, Barnet#Hendon Lane and the Church|St Mary's Church, Finchley]], north London. In 1835, a monument to him was erected in the churchyard, paid for by public subscription. It is a Grade II [[listed building]], but is on the [[English Heritage]] Heritage at Risk Register due to its dangerous condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher =English Heritage|year=2012|title=Heritage at Risk Register, London|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/publications/har-2012-registers/lo-HAR-register-2012.pdf|page=20|accessdate=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a plan (2018) to restore it.

In 1831, a monument from a design by Macdowell was erected to him in [[Bloomsbury]], London, where he had lived.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Burton Crescent, the original name of the street, was later renamed [[Cartwright Gardens]] in his honour. His statue faces a student [[hall of residence]] and backs onto tennis courts and [[terraced house|a terrace of houses]], most of which serve as small hotels.

Captain [[George Vancouver]] named [[Cartwright Sound]], on the west coast of [[Graham Island]] in the [[Queen Charlotte Islands]] of [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]], in his honour in relation to his Royal Navy service under Admiral Howe.&lt;ref&gt;{{BCGNIS|29226|Cartwright Sound}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Life and Correspondence of Major Cartwright'', edited by his niece [[Frances Dorothy Cartwright]], was published in 1826.  John Cartwright House, built in 1976 on the Mansford Estate in [[Bethnal Green]], was named in his honour. The estate was built by [[Tower Hamlets Council]] and a number of the blocks were named after social and political reformers. In 2006, the Estate transferred to Tower Hamlets Community Housing, a local [[housing association]].

'''John Zerzan''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|z|ɜr|z|ə|n}} {{respell|ZUR|zən}}; born August 10, 1943) is an American [[anarchism|anarchist]] and [[anarcho-primitivism|primitivist]] philosopher and author. His works criticize agricultural [[civilization]] as inherently oppressive, and advocate drawing upon the ways of life of [[hunter-gatherer]]s as an inspiration for what a free society should look like. Some subjects of his criticism include [[domestication]], [[language]], [[Anarcho-primitivism#Critique of symbolic culture|symbolic thought]] (such as [[mathematics]] and [[art]]) and the concept of time.

His six major books are ''Elements of Refusal'' (1988), ''[[Future Primitive and Other Essays]]'' (1994), ''Running on Emptiness'' (2002), ''[[Against Civilization: Readings and Reflections]]'' (2005), ''Twilight of the Machines'' (2008), and ''Why hope? The Stand Against Civilization'' (2015).

==Early life and education==
Zerzan was born in [[Salem, Oregon|Salem]], Oregon. He received his bachelor's degree from [[Stanford University]] and later received a master's degree in History from [[San Francisco State University]]. He completed his coursework towards a PhD at the [[University of Southern California]] but dropped out before completing his [[Thesis|dissertation]]. He is of [[Czechs|Czech]] descent.

==Zerzan's anarchism==
{{Anarchism sidebar}}
Zerzan's theories draw on [[Theodor Adorno]]'s concept of [[Negative Dialectics|negative dialectics]] to construct a theory of [[civilization]] as the cumulative construction of [[social alienation|alienation]].  According to Zerzan, original human societies in [[paleolithic]] times, and similar societies today such as the [[!Kung people|!Kung]] and [[Mbuti]], live a non-alienated and non-oppressive form of life based on [[Original Affluent Society|primitive abundance]] and closeness to nature. Constructing such societies as an instructive comparison against which to denounce contemporary (especially industrial) societies, Zerzan uses [[anthropology|anthropological]] studies from such societies as the basis for a wide-ranging critique of aspects of modern life. He portrays contemporary society as a world of misery built on the [[psychology|psychological]] production of a sense of scarcity and lack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/massmisery.htm John Zerzan – The Mass Psychology of Misery] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323052844/http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/massmisery.htm |date=March 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The history of civilization is the history of renunciation; what stands against this is not progress but rather the [[Utopia]] which arises from its negation.&lt;ref name=WhyPrimitivism&gt;[http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/whyprim.htm John Zerzan – Why Primitivism?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091214075548/http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/whyprim.htm |date=December 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zerzan is an anarchist philosopher, and is broadly associated with the philosophies of [[anarcho-primitivism]], [[green anarchism]], anti-civilisation, [[post-left anarchy]], [[Neo-Luddism|neo-luddism]], and in particular the [[critique of technology]].&lt;ref name=GUARDIAN&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,475181,00.html John Zerzan] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt; He rejects not only the state, but all forms of hierarchical and authoritarian relations.  "Most simply, anarchy means 'without rule.' This implies not only a rejection of government but of all other forms of domination and power as well."&lt;ref name=WhatIsAnarchism&gt;[http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/whatisanarchism.htm John Zerzan – What is Anarchism?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618101213/http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/whatisanarchism.htm |date=June 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zerzan's work relies heavily on a strong dualism between the "primitive" – viewed as non-alienated, wild, non-hierarchical, ludic, and socially [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] – and the "civilised" – viewed as alienated, domesticated, hierarchically organised and socially discriminatory. Hence, "life before domestication/agriculture was in fact largely one of leisure, intimacy with nature, sensual wisdom, sexual equality, and health."&lt;ref name=FuturePrimitive&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.primitivism.com/future-primitive.htm |title=John Zerzan – Future Primitive |publisher=Primitivism.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zerzan's claims about the status of primitive societies are based on a certain reading of the works of anthropologists such as [[Marshall Sahlins]] and [[Richard Borshay Lee|Richard B. Lee]]. Crucially, the category of primitives is restricted to pure hunter-gatherer societies with no domesticated plants or animals. For instance, hierarchy among Northwest Coast Native Americans whose main activities were fishing and foraging is attributed to their having domesticated dogs and tobacco.&lt;ref name=FuturePrimitive/&gt;&lt;ref name = RunningOnEmptiness/&gt;

Zerzan calls for a "Future Primitive", a radical reconstruction of society based on a rejection of alienation and an embracing of the wild.  "It may be that our only real hope is the recovery of a face-to-face social existence, a radical [[decentralization]], a dismantling of the devouring, estranging productionist, high-tech trajectory that is so impoverishing."&lt;ref name=WhatIsAnarchism/&gt; The usual use of anthropological evidence is comparative and demonstrative – the necessity or naturality of aspects of modern western societies is challenged by pointing to counter-examples in hunter-gatherer societies.  "Ever-growing documentation of human prehistory as a very long period of largely non-alienated life stands in sharp contrast to the increasingly stark failures of untenable modernity."&lt;ref name=WhyPrimitivism/&gt; It is unclear, however, whether this implies a re-establishment of the literal forms of hunter-gatherer societies or a broader kind of learning from their ways of life in order to construct non-alienated relations.

Zerzan's political project calls for the destruction of technology.  He draws the same distinction as [[Ivan Illich]], between tools that stay under the control of the user, and technological systems that draw the user into their control.  One difference is the [[division of labour]], which Zerzan opposes. In Zerzan's philosophy, technology is possessed by an [[elite]] which automatically has power over other users; this power is one of the sources of alienation, along with [[domestication]] and [[symbol]]ic thought.

Zerzan's typical method is to take a particular construct of civilisation (a technology, belief, practice or institution) and construct an account of its historical origins, what he calls its destructive and alienating effects and its contrasts with hunter-gatherer experiences.  In his essay on number, for example, Zerzan starts by contrasting the "civilized" emphasis on counting and measuring with a "primitive" emphasis on sharing, citing [[Dorothy D. Lee|Dorothy Lee]]'s work on the [[Trobriand Islands|Trobriand Islanders]] in support, before constructing a narrative of the rise of number through cumulative stages of state domination, starting with the desire of [[Egypt]]ian kings to measure what they ruled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/number.htm John Zerzan – Number: Its Origin and Evolution] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618100924/http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/number.htm |date=June 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This approach is repeated in relation to time,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/time.htm John Zerzan – Time and its Discontents] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618101958/http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/time.htm |date=June 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; gender inequality,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/patriarchy.htm John Zerzan – Patriarchy, Civilization, and the Origins of Gender] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206011455/http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/patriarchy.htm |date=February 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; work,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/organisedlabour.htm John Zerzan – Organized Labor versus "The Revolt Against Work"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618101748/http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/organisedlabour.htm |date=June 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; technology,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/technology.htm John Zerzan – Technology] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618101934/http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/technology.htm |date=June 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; art and ritual,&lt;ref name=RunningOnEmptiness&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.primitivism.com/emptiness.htm |title=John Zerzan – Running on Emptiness: The Failure of Symbolic Thought |publisher=Primitivism.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; agriculture&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/agriculture.htm John Zerzan – Agriculture] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100831022318/http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/agriculture.htm |date=August 31, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and globalization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/globalization.htm John Zerzan – Globalization and its Apologists: An Abolitionist Perspective] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206011133/http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/globalization.htm |date=February 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Zerzan also writes more general texts on anarchist,&lt;ref name=WhatIsAnarchism/&gt; primitivist theory,&lt;ref name=WhyPrimitivism/&gt;&lt;ref name=FuturePrimitive/&gt; and critiques of "[[postmodernism]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100618100950/http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/pmanarchist.htm John Zerzan – "Hakim Bey," Postmodern Anarchist]&lt;/ref&gt;

Zerzan was one of the editors of ''[[Green Anarchy]]'', a controversial journal of anarcho-primitivist and [[insurrectionary anarchist]] thought. He is also the host of ''Anarchy Radio'' in Eugene on the [[University of Oregon]]'s radio station [[KWVA]]. He has also served as a contributing editor at ''[[Anarchy Magazine]]'' and has been published in magazines such as ''[[AdBusters]]''. He does extensive speaking tours around the world, and is married to an independent consultant to museums and other [[nonprofit organization]]s.

==Political development==
In 1966, Zerzan was arrested while performing [[civil disobedience]] at a [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] anti-[[Vietnam War]] march and spent two weeks in the [[Contra Costa County]] [[county jail|Jail]]. He vowed after his release never again to be willingly arrested. He attended events organized by [[Ken Kesey]] and the [[Merry Pranksters]] and was involved with the [[psychedelic drug]] and [[psychedelic music|music]] scene in San Francisco's [[Haight-Ashbury]] neighborhood.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/apr/18/mayday.features11 |title=Profile of American anarchist John Zerzan &amp;#124; World news |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=November 13, 2011 |date=April 20, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1960s he worked as a [[social worker]] for the city of San Francisco [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] department. He helped organize a social worker's [[trade union|union]], the SSEU, and was elected vice president in 1968, and president in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shapingsf.org/ezine/labor/nopaid/main.html History of the union] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828045251/http://www.shapingsf.org/ezine/labor/nopaid/main.html |date=August 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The local [[Situationist International|Situationist]] group Contradiction denounced him as a "[[leftist]] [[bureaucracy|bureaucrat]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Contradiction |url=http://www.bopsecrets.org/PH/zerzan.htm |title=Open Letter to John Zerzan, anti-bureaucrat of the San Francisco Social Services Employees Union |publisher=Bopsecrets.org |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, Black and Red Press published ''Unions Against Revolution'' by Spanish [[ultra-left]] theorist [[Grandizo Munis]] that included an essay by Zerzan which previously appeared in the journal ''[[Telos (journal)|Telos]]''.  Over the next 20 years, Zerzan became intimately involved with the ''[[Fifth Estate (periodical)|Fifth Estate]]'', ''[[Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed]]'', ''Demolition Derby '' and other anarchist periodicals. He began to question civilization in the early 80's, after having sought to confront issues around the neutrality of technology and division of labour, at the time when [[Fredy Perlman]] was making similar conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corrupt.org/act/interviews/john_zerzan |title=Interview: Anarcho-Primitivist Thinker and Activist John Zerzan &amp;#124; CORRUPT.org: Conservation &amp; Conservatism |publisher=CORRUPT.org |date=December 7, 2008 |accessdate=November 13, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002121547/http://www.corrupt.org/act/interviews/john_zerzan |archivedate=October 2, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He saw civilization itself as the root of the problems of the world and that a hunter-gatherer form of society presented the most [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian model]] for human relations with themselves and the natural world.

==Zerzan and the "Unabomber"==
In the mid-1990s, Zerzan became a confidant to [[Theodore Kaczynski]], the "Unabomber", after he read ''Industrial Society and Its Future'', the so-called ''Unabomber Manifesto.''  Zerzan sat through the Unabomber trial and often conversed with Kaczynski during the proceedings.  After Zerzan became known as a friend of the Unabomber, the mainstream media became interested in Zerzan and his ideas.

On May 7, 1995, a full-page interview with Zerzan was featured in ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE3DD113FF934A35756C0A963958260 Prominent Anarchist Finds Unsought Ally in Serial Bomber] (New York Times article)&lt;/ref&gt; In Zerzan's essay "Whose Unabomber?" (1995), he signaled his support for the Kaczynski doctrine, but criticised the bombings:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[T]he mailing of explosive devices intended for the agents who are engineering the present catastrophe is too random. Children, mail carriers, and others could easily be killed. Even if one granted the legitimacy of striking at the high-tech horror show by terrorizing its indispensable architects, collateral harm is not justifiable ...&lt;ref name=WhoseUnabomber&gt;[http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/whoseunabomber.htm John Zerzan – Whose Unabomber?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618101228/http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/whoseunabomber.htm |date=June 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Zerzan in the same essay offered a qualified defense of the Unabomber's actions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The concept of justice should not be overlooked in considering the Unabomber phenomenon. In fact, except for his targets, when have the many [[little Eichmanns]] who are preparing the [[Brave New World]] ever been called to account?... Is it unethical to try to stop those whose contributions are bringing an unprecedented assault on life?&lt;ref name=WhoseUnabomber/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Two years later, in the 1997 essay "He Means It&amp;nbsp;— Do You?," Zerzan wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Enter the Unabomber and a new line is being drawn. This time the bohemian schiz-fluxers, Green yuppies, hobbyist anarcho-journalists, condescending organizers of the poor, hip nihilo-aesthetes and all the other "anarchists" who thought their pretentious pastimes would go on unchallenged indefinitely&amp;nbsp;— well, it's time to pick which side you're on. It may be that here also is a [[Crossing the Rubicon|Rubicon]] from which there will be no turning back.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a 2001 interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'', he said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Will there be other Kaczynskis? I hope not. I think that activity came out of isolation and desperation, and I hope that isn't going to be something that people feel they have to take up because they have no other way to express their opposition to the brave new world.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a 2014 interview Zerzan stated that he and Kaczynski were "not on terms anymore." He criticized his former friend's 2008 essay "[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/ted-kaczynski-the-truth-about-primitive-life-a-critique-of-anarchoprimitivism The Truth About Primitive Life: A Critique of Anarchoprimitivism]" and expressed disapproval of [[Individuals Tending Towards the Savage|Individuals Tending Towards the Wild]], a Mexican group influenced by the Unabomber's bombing campaign.&lt;ref name="vice.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/read/john-zerzan-wants-us-to-give-up-all-of-our-technology |title=The Anarcho-Primitivist Who Wants Us All To Give Up Technology |work=Vice Media Inc |location=USA |accessdate=June 26, 2014 |date=June 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zerzan and the Eugene Anarchist Scene==
{{see also|1999 Seattle WTO protests}}
Zerzan was associated with the [[Eugene, Oregon anarchist scene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eugeneweekly.com/2006/11/22/coverstory.html|title=Part. III: Eco-Anarchy Imploding|newspaper=[[Eugene Weekly]]|date=November 22, 2006|accessdate=September 1, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403004049/http://www.eugeneweekly.com/2006/11/22/coverstory.html|archive-date=April 3, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism: history, catastrophe and anarchism==
In his essay "Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism: An Unbridgeable Chasm", [[Murray Bookchin]] directed criticism from an anarchist point of view at Zerzan's anti-civilizational and anti-technological perspective. He argued that Zerzan's representation of hunter-gatherers was flawed, selective and often patronisingly racist, that his analysis was superficial, and that his practical proposals were nonsensical.

Aside from Murray Bookchin, several other anarchist critiques of Zerzan's primitivist philosophies exist. The pamphlet, "Anarchism vs. Primitivism" by Brian Oliver Sheppard criticizes many aspects of the primitivist philosophy.&lt;ref name="Libcom.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libcom.org/library/anarchism-vs-primitivism |title=Anarchism vs. Primitivism by Brian Oliver Sheppard |publisher=Libcom.org |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It specifically rejects the claim that primitivism is a form of anarchism.

Some authors, such as Andrew Flood, have argued that destroying civilization would lead to the death of a significant majority of the population, mainly in poor countries.&lt;ref name="Anarkismo.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anarkismo.net/newswire.php?story_id=1451 |title=Civilization, Primitivism, Anarchism by Andrew Flood |publisher=Anarkismo.net |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Zerzan responded to such claims by suggesting a gradual decrease in population size, with the possibility of people having the need to seek means of sustainability more close to nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/fp.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100910091422/http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/fp.htm |date=September 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flood suggests this contradicts Zerzan's claims elsewhere, and adds that, since it is certain that most people will strongly reject Zerzan's supposed utopia, it can only be implemented by authoritarian means, against the will of billions.&lt;ref name="Anarkismo.net"/&gt;

In his essay "Listen Anarchist!", Chaz Bufe criticized the primitivist position from an anarchist perspective, pointing out that primitivists are extremely vague about exactly which technologies they advocate keeping and which they seek to abolish, noting that smallpox had been eradicated thanks to medical technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.seesharppress.com/listen.html| author=Chaz Bufe| title=Listen Anarchist!| publisher=See Sharp Press| year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theodore J. Kaczynski]], better known as the [[Unabomber]], is a surprisingly harsh critic of the current Anarcho-Primitivist mainstream and Zerzan in particular for what he sees as a foolish and invalid projection of leftist values such as gender equality, pacifism and leisure time onto the primitive way of life. Kaczynski holds that the values of gender equality, pacifism, leisure time, etc., while still admirable, are exactly the values of techno-industrial civilization and its promised techno-utopia. Second, he holds that having such an interpretation is counter-productive to the ultimate anti-civilization/anti-tech goal as it attracts "leftist types" who are by nature uncommitted and act to dilute the movement.  Kaczynski insists that the core values of freedom, autonomy, dignity, and human fulfillment must be emphasized above all others.&lt;ref&gt;Technological Slavery: The collected writings of Theodore J. Kaczynski, pp. 128–189.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Legal advertising''' is [[advertising]] by [[lawyer]]s ([[attorneys at law]]) and [[law firm]]s. Legal [[marketing]] is a broader term referring to advertising and other practices, such as client relations, [[cross-selling]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marketing Monday: are law firms getting smarter using CRM? + infographic|url=http://www.legaltechnology.com/latest-news/marketing-monday-are-law-firms-getting-smarter-using-crm-infographic/|publisher=www.legaltechnology.com|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[public relations]] and maintaining contact with [[Alumnus|alumni]].

==England and Wales==
Legal marketing has been permitted in [[England and Wales]] since 1986, when the [[Law Society of England and Wales]] first permitted lawyers to advertise. The Financial Services Authority now licences helplines and claims management agencies - except trade unions - which typically advertise and refer claims to lawyers.

==European Union==
From the 1990s, other [[jurisdiction]]s in [[continental Europe]] progressively opened way for advertising. [[Advocate]]s in [[Spain]], [[France]]. and [[Germany]] are among those able to freely use instruments of communication.

==India==
In [[India]], an advocate shall not solicit work or advertise, except through a medium maintained by the Bar Council of India, either directly or indirectly, whether by circulars, advertisements, touts, personal communications, interviews not warranted by personal relations, furnishing or inspiring newspaper comments or producing his/her photographs to be published in connection with cases in which they have been engaged or concerned. Their sign-board or name-plate should be of a reasonable size. The sign-board or name-plate or stationery should not indicate that they are or have been a President or Member of a Bar Council or of any Association or that they have been associated with any person or organization or with any particular cause or matter or that they specialize in any particular type of work or that they had been a Judge or an Advocate General.S oliciting work or advertise” as used in this clause of the Code would not mean and include setting up of a web-site by an advocate or a law firm giving only basic information about the names and number of lawyers in a law firm, the contact details and areas of practice. This would apply similarly to lawyers’ brochures and law directories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rules on Professional Standards &lt; Bar Council of India|url=http://www.barcouncilofindia.org/about/professional-standards/rules-on-professional-standards/|website=Bar Council of India|publisher=Bar Council of India|accessdate=2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the amended rule, advocates can mention in their chosen websites, their names, telephone numbers, e-mail ID, professional qualification and areas of specialization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=16 Reasons why Lawyers in India should be allowed to Advertise |url=https://mehnat.in/reasons_lawyers_should_be_allowed_to_advertise.html/||accessdate=2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Israel==
In [[Israel]], legal marketing managers in big law firms were active since 2006. Their activity expanded due to the [[Late-2000s recession]] which affected law firms, and due to the large number of lawyers per capita in Israel.

==Italy==
In [[Italy]], the Bersani Decree of July 2, converted into law in January 2007 gives lawyers the right to advertise.

==United States==

Lawyer advertising in the United States is legal, although subject to ethical rules promulgated by state bar associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lawyer Advertising at the Crossroads|date=1995|publisher=American Bar Association|isbn=157073142X|url=https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/resources/professionalism/crossroads.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cases on Lawyer Advertising|url=https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/resources/professionalism/professionalism_ethics_in_lawyer_advertising/clearinghouse.html|website=American Bar Association|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commonly encountered forms of lawyer advertising include television and radio commercials,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sullivan|first1=Joseph F.|title=Jersey Lets its Lawyers Run TV and Radio Ads|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/20/nyregion/jersey-lets-its-lawyers-run-tv-and-radio-ads.html|accessdate=5 December 2017|publisher=New York Times|date=20 January 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; print advertisements,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Simon|first1=Roy|title=Thumbnail Guide to Amended Advertising Rules|url=http://www.newyorklegalethics.com/thumbnail-guide-to-amended-advertising-rules/|website=New York Legal Ethics Reporter|accessdate=5 December 2017|date=February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; billboards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Billboard Advertisement|url=https://www.jud.ct.gov/sgc/Adv_opinions/Adv_10-01283-A.pdf|website=Statewide Grievance Committee|publisher=Connecticut Judicial Branch|accessdate=5 December 2017|date=23 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; direct mail marketing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spahn|first1=Thomas E.|title=Lawyer Marketing: An Ethics Guide|url=http://media.mcguirewoods.com/publications/Ethics-Programs/9723312.pdf|website=McGuireWoods LLP|accessdate=5 December 2017|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; law firm websites, and participation in telephone directories,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Should Lawyers Still Advertise in the Yellow Pages|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/practice_management/website_roi.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=5 December 2017|date=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; commercial directories and referral services,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Colorado Bar Differentiates Online Directories From Lawyer Referral Services|url=https://www.hinshawlaw.com/newsroom-publications-alerts-304.html|website=Hinshaw &amp; Culbertson LLP|accessdate=5 December 2017|date=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and through online advertising and social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Filisko|first1=G.M.|title=The Ethics of Online Advertising|url=https://abaforlawstudents.com/2013/03/03/ethics-online-advertising/|website=ABA for Law Students|publisher=American Bar Association|accessdate=5 December 2017|date=3 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908, the [[American Bar Association]] ("ABA") established its first ethics code, known as the Canons of Professional Ethics, which condemned all advertisement and solicitation by lawyers. Due to the progression of the legal profession and the desire to update the Canons of Professional Ethics, the ABA created the Model Code of Professional Responsibility ("Model Code") in 1969. The Model Code was an effort by the ABA to create practical rules that went "beyond the pretty details of form and manners" and addressed "the chained relationship of the lawyer to his clients, to his professional brethren and to the public."&lt;ref&gt;Olson, Emily, "Ethics of Attorney Advertising: The Effects of Different State Regulatory Regimes, The" Georgetown Journal of Legal Ethics, The (2005) http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/geojlege18&amp;div=57&amp;id=&amp;page=&lt;/ref&gt;

The first major [[case law]] decision on legal advertising is the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruling in ''[[Bates v. Arizona State Bar]]'' 433 U.S. 350 (1977), in which the [[United States Supreme Court]], held that lawyer advertising is partially protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;Bates v. State Bar of Ariz., 433 U.S. 350, 363-64 (1977).https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0433_0350_ZS.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court rejected the argument by the Arizona Bar that attorney advertising was "inherently misleading" and "tarnish the dignified public image of the profession." The Court found "the postulated connection between advertising and the erosion of true professionalism to be severely strained," and noted that "lack of legal advertising could be viewed as the profession's failure to 'reach out and serve the community.'"&lt;ref&gt;Haywood, Amy, "Navigating a sea of uncertainty: How existing ethical guidelines pertain to the marketing of legal services over the Internet" The Georgetown Journal of Legal Ethics (July 2001) http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/geojlege14&amp;div=49&amp;id=&amp;page=&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) responded to the Supreme Court of Alabama's June 26, 2002 invitation to comment on the Alabama Rules of Professional Conduct entitled ''Information about Legal Services''. In this response, the FTC "encourages competition in the licensed professions, including the legal profession, to the maximum extent compatible with other state and federal goals."&lt;ref&gt;Federal Trade Commission, "Response to Alabama Rules of Professional Conduct" (September 2002) http://www.ftc.gov/be/v020023.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, on May 26, 2006, the FTC commented on the State Bar of Texas Professional Ethics Committee's consideration on whether or not it is ethical for a Texas attorney to participate in an online lawyer referral services. The FTC determined that "online legal matching services are a valuable option for Texans: they are likely to reduce the consumers' cost for finding legal representation and have the potential to increase completion among attorneys."&lt;ref&gt;Federal Trade Commission, "Comments on a Request for Ethics Opinion Regarding Online Attorney Matching Programs" (May 2006) {{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/os/2006/05/V060017CommentsonaRequestforAnEthicsOpinionImage |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924024155/http://www.ftc.gov/os/2006/05/V060017CommentsonaRequestforAnEthicsOpinionImage |archivedate=2009-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain marketing practices are considered illegal, and many others may be considered violations of [[legal ethics]]. [[Shock advertising]], for example, would be considered unethical; directly soliciting clients (known as [[Barratry (common law)|barratry]], or "[[ambulance chasing]]") is illegal.

The [[New York State Unified Court System|New York]] and [[Florida]] [[court system]]s proposed several restrictions on advertising in 2006 and 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Law.com article from June 15, 2006 New York Law Journal (N.Y.L.J.) article on NY proposals by John Caher:[http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1150275921219]&lt;/ref&gt; The N.Y. proposals generated controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Donovan|first1=Karen|title=New York Law Firms Struggle With New Restrictions on Advertising|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/02/business/media/02law.html|accessdate=4 December 2017|publisher=New York Times|date=2 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005, [[New York State Bar Association]] President Vincent Buzard appointed a Task Force on Lawyer Advertising, chaired by Bernice K. Leber, to make proposals for consideration by NYSBA and the New York courts.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Rush, ''U.S. District Court: Some advertising rules unconstitutional,'' ''State Bar News'', September/October 2007, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The new rules for New York were effective on February 1, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;For the full rules, see: [http://www.nycourts.gov/rules/attorney_ads_amendments.shtml].&lt;/ref&gt;  For the first time, the New York [[Legal system]] defined legal advertising, as:&lt;br&gt;
"any public or private communication made on or behalf of a lawyer or law firm about that lawyer or law firm's services, the primary purpose of which is for the retention of the lawyer or law firm."&lt;ref&gt;11 New York Code of Rules and Regulations (N.Y.C.R.R.) part 1200, section 1200.1 (k), found at [http://www.nycourts.gov/rules/1200-1_final.pdf] (requires Acrobat-TM reader).&lt;/ref&gt;  The new rule specifically exempts communications to existing clients or other lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Publicity]] is, for the first time, also included as a [[synonym]] of advertising.&lt;ref&gt;11 N.Y.C.R.R. part 1200, section 1200.6, also known as the Code of Professional Responsibility, Disciplinary Rule (DR) 2-101, found at: [http://www.nycourts.gov/rules/1200-6_final.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;  The newly revised rules now allow advertising about a lawyer's publications and "[[bona fide]] professional ratings".&lt;ref&gt;Id., at DR 2-101 (b) (1).&lt;/ref&gt;  There are certain special rules for email advertising, prohibiting [[E-mail spam|spam]].&lt;ref&gt;Id., DR 2-101 (b).&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2007 rules stated that advertising must not include a number of prohibited [[marketing]] devices:
# Certain [[Testimonial|endorsements or testimonials]] from a former client
# Portrayal of [[judge]]s
# Paid, undisclosed payment of testimonials
# Portrayal of a judge, or [[Fiction|fictitious]] lawyer or law firm
# Use of actors or fictionalized persons
# Irrelevant characteristics of the lawyers
# Ads that resemble [[Legal instrument|legal documents]]
# Certain limits on soliciting new clients for 30 days after a [[tort]]
# Certain other limits on communications with non-clients
# Use of a nickname or moniker.&lt;ref&gt;DR 2-101 (c), found at [http://www.nycourts.gov/rules/1200-6_final.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

The new New York rules were challenged, and Judge [[Frederick J. Scullin]] of the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of New York]] struck down five of the rules as unconstitutional infringement of the First Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Rush, ''U.S. District Court: Some advertising rules unconstitutional,'' ''State Bar News'', September/October 2007, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  The endorsement, portrayals, "Irrelevant characteristics", and nicknames provisions were stricken; however, the domain name limitations, 30-day solicitation, and communications rules were upheld.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Rush, ''U.S. District Court: Some advertising rules unconstitutional,'' ''State Bar News'', September/October 2007, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  State Bar President Kathryn Madigan promised to work with the court system to develop new rules that will survive constitutional [[strict scrutiny]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nysba.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Current_Releases&amp;TEMPLATE=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;CONTENTID=8856 NYSBA Press Release]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ludwig Feuerbach und der Ausgang der klassischen deutschen Philosophie.gif|thumb|right]]
'''''Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy''''' (German: ''Ludwig Feuerbach und der Ausgang der klassischen deutschen Philosophie'') is a book published by [[Friedrich Engels]] in 1886. 

According to Engels, the seed for this book was planted 40 years before, in ''[[The German Ideology]]'' written by Marx and Engels, but unpublished in their lifetime. The undertaking is performed to deal critically with German philosophy from a [[Dialectical materialism|dialectical materialist]] position. Here Engels emphasized the importance of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] and [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] for their own theories.

Hegel's idealist, conservative system must be distinguished from his materialist, revolutionary method of [[Dialectic|dialectics]]. Feuerbach had turned to law against Hegel's idealistic system and "the fundamental question of philosophy": the relation of thinking and being. But Feuerbach rejected [[Hegelian dialectic|Hegel's dialectical method]], which is why his view of man and nature remained [[abstraction|abstract]] and unhistorical. Marx only kept the "rational" content from the dialectical method and freed it from their idealistic form. 

== Publication history ==
The book was only about 50 pages long, and was written early in 1886, and published that year in "[[Die Neue Zeit]]", issues No. 4 and 5. In 1888 a revised print by [[Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Dietz]] was published in [[Stuttgart]], which contained some additional commentary by Engels. In this edition, Marx' 1845 ''[[Theses on Feuerbach]]''  was also reprinted for the first time.

'''Michael Palmer''' (born 1945) is an English philosopher, whose work has been translated into many languages.  His primary field of interest is The Philosophy of Religion.  More recently, however, his work has concentrated on the philosophy of atheism, culminating in his authorship of ''The Atheist's Creed'' (2010), ''The Atheist's Primer'' (2012) and the projected ''Atheism for Beginners'' (due 2013).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lutterworth.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Palmer was educated at [[Lancing College]] (1958–1963), St John's College, [[Durham University]] (1964–67, 70-72), and [[McMaster University]] in Canada (1970–71).  His doctorate - on the Theology of [[Paul Tillich]] - was supervised at Durham by a Tillich pupil, Professor John Heywood Thomas. After leaving university, Palmer taught for three years at [[Marlborough College]] in Wiltshire (1974–77) and it was here that he introduced Philosophy as a Sixth Form subject. 1977 Palmer was the recipient of the prestigious [[Alexander von Humboldt Fellowship]], which enabled him to study at the [[University of Marburg]] in Germany.  Here Palmer studied with Professor [[Carl-Heinz Ratschow]] - a friend of Tillich's - and it was he who saw to the publication of Palmer's first book, published by De Gruyter of Berlin: ''Paul Tillich's Philosophy of Art''. Palmer's distinction as a Tillich scholar was crowned by his selection as the only English editor of the comprehensive six-volumed edition of ''Tillich's Main Works'', published by de Gruyter in 1990.

On his return to England in 1980 Palmer became the founding Head of the Department of Religion and Philosophy at [[The Manchester Grammar School]], the first Department of its kind in the country.&lt;ref&gt;The Creation of this Department is described in the article 'Philosophy at Manchester Grammar School', Cogito, 3, No.1, 1989, pp. 72-76.&lt;/ref&gt; Here Palmer initiated a compulsory Philosophy course for all Sixth Formers.  This course was subsequently published by The Lutterworth Press in 1991 as ''Moral Problems'',  and it remains the most successful School philosophy textbook since the War, still widely in use.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lutterworth.com/product_info.php?products_id=1280&lt;/ref&gt; Its companion volume,  ''Moral Problems in Medicine'', was published in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lutterworth.com/product_info.php?products_id=1278&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1991-1995 Palmer taught at the [[University of Bristol]]. Two sets of his lectures - ''Freud and Jung on Religion'' (1997)  and ''The Question of God'' (2001) - were subsequently published by Routledge. In 2008 The Lutterworth Press published Palmer's two volumed work ''The Philosophy of Religion''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lutterworth.com/product_info.php?products_id=1342&lt;/ref&gt; More recently Palmer has become best known for his work on Atheism, and in particular in 2010 for his book ''The Atheist's Creed''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lutterworth.com/product_info.php?products_id=1358&lt;/ref&gt; His Credo, which stands at the beginning of this book, has attracted considerable publicity. It reads:-

{{smallcaps|I believe that the cosmos is all that is or ever was or ever will be.}}

'''Molyneux's problem''' is a [[thought experiment]] in philosophy concerning immediate [[recovery from blindness]]. It was first formulated by [[William Molyneux]], and notably referred to in [[John Locke]]'s ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1689). The problem can be stated in brief, "if a man born blind can feel the differences between [[shape]]s such as [[sphere]]s and [[cube]]s, could he, if given the ability to see, distinguish those objects by sight alone, in reference to the tactile schemata he already possessed?"

==Original correspondence==
The question was originally posed to Locke by philosopher [[William Molyneux]], whose wife was blind:&lt;ref&gt;

Suppose a man born blind, and now adult, and taught by his touch to distinguish between a cube and a sphere of the same metal, and nighly of the same bigness, so as to tell, when he felt one and the other, which is the cube, which is the sphere. Suppose then the cube and the sphere placed on a table, and the blind man made to see: query, Whether by his sight, before he touched them, he could now distinguish and tell which is the globe, which the cube? To which the acute and judicious proposer answers: 'Not. For though he has obtained the experience of how a globe, and how a cube, affects his touch; yet he has not yet attained the experience, that what affects his touch so or so, must affect his sight so or so...'

To which Locke responds in ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (emphasis added):&lt;ref name="ess"&gt;[[John Locke]], ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'', book 2, chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|
I shall here insert a problem of that very ingenious and studious promoter of real knowledge, the learned and worthy Mr. Molyneux, which he was pleased to send me in a letter some months since; and it is this:—"Suppose a man born blind, and now adult, and taught by his touch to distinguish between a cube and a sphere of the same metal, and nighly of the same bigness, so as to tell, when he felt one and the other, which is the cube, which the sphere. Suppose then the cube and sphere placed on a table, and the blind man be made to see: quaere, whether by his sight, before he touched them, he could now distinguish and tell which is the globe, which the cube?" To which the acute and judicious proposer answers, "Not. For, though he has obtained the experience of how a globe, how a cube affects his touch, yet he has not yet obtained the experience, that what affects his touch so or so, must affect his sight so or so; or that a protuberant angle in the cube, that pressed his hand unequally, shall appear to his eye as it does in the cube."—'''I agree with this thinking gentleman, whom I am proud to call my friend, in his answer to this problem; and am of opinion that the blind man, at first sight, would not be able with certainty to say which was the globe, which the cube, whilst he only saw them; though he could unerringly name them by his touch, and certainly distinguish them by the difference of their figures felt.''' This I have set down, and leave with my reader, as an occasion for him to consider how much he may be beholden to experience, improvement, and acquired notions, where he thinks he had not the least use of, or help from them. And the rather, because this observing gentleman further adds, that "having, upon the occasion of my book, proposed this to divers very ingenious men, he hardly ever met with one that at first gave the answer to it which he thinks true, till by hearing his reasons they were convinced.
}}

==Responses==
In 1709, in ''A New Theory of Vision'', [[George Berkeley]] also concluded that there was no necessary connection between a tactile world and a sight world—that a connection between them could be established only on the basis of experience. He speculated:
{{quote|
the objects to which he had hitherto used to apply the terms up and down, high and low, were such as only affected or were in some way perceived by touch; but the proper objects of vision make a new set of ideas, perfectly distinct and different from the former, and which can in no sort make themselves perceived by touch|
(sect. 95).
}}

In 1749, [[Denis Diderot]] wrote ''[[Lettre sur les aveugles à l'usage de ceux qui voient|Letter on the blind for the benefit of those who see]]'' as a criticism of our knowledge of ultimate reality.

A similar problem was also addressed earlier in the 12th century by [[Ibn Tufail]] (Abubacer), in his [[philosophical novel]], ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan]]'' (''Philosophus Autodidactus''). His version of the problem, however, dealt mainly with [[color]]s rather than shapes&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad ibn Abd al-Malik [[Ibn Tufayl]] and Léon Gauthier (1981), ''Risalat Hayy ibn Yaqzan'', p. 5, Editions de la Méditerranée:[http://limitedinc.blogspot.com/2007/04/things-about-arabick-influence-on-john.html]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diana Lobel (2006), ''A Sufi-Jewish Dialogue: Philosophy and Mysticism in Baḥya Ibn Paqūda's Duties of the Heart'', p. 24, [[University of Pennsylvania Press]], {{ISBN|0-8122-3953-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;:
{{quote|
If you want a comparison that will make you clearly grasp the difference between the perception, such as it is understood by that sect [the Sufis] and the perception as others understand it, imagine a person born [[Blindness|blind]], endowed however with a happy natural [[temperament]], with a lively and firm [[intelligence]], a sure [[memory]], a straight sprite, who grew up from the time he was an infant in a city where he never stopped learning, by means of the [[sense]]s he did dispose of, to know the inhabitants individually, the numerous species of beings, living as well as non-living, there, the streets and sidestreets, the houses, the steps, in such a manner as to be able to cross the city without a guide, and to recognize immediately those he met; the colors alone would not be known to him except by the names they bore, and by certain definitions that designated them. Suppose that he had arrived at this point and suddenly, his eyes were opened, he recovered his view, and he crosses the entire city, making a tour of it. He would find no object different from the idea he had made of it; he would encounter nothing he didn’t recognize, he would find the colors conformable to the descriptions of them that had been given to him; and in this there would only be two new important things for him, one the consequence of the other: a clarity, a greater [[brightness]], and a great voluptuousness.
}}

Regarding Molyneux's problem, the authors [[Asif A. Ghazanfar]] &amp; [[Hjalmar K. Turesson]] (2008) have recently noted:
{{quote|
Production of speech is seen as a pure motor act, involving muscles and the neurons controlling them, while perception of speech is seen as purely sensory, involving the ear and the auditory pathway. This parcellation of the systems appear intuitive and clear, but recent studies [beginning with Taine 1870!] ... suggest that such divisions may be fundamentally wrong. Rather than separate processes for motor outputs and individual sensory modalities, adaptive action seems to use all the available context-specific information. That is, neural representations across the brain may be centered on specific actions. This view on neural representations puts 'Molyneux's Problem' in a new light. Unisensory signals are fused into multisensory motor representations unified by an action, but since Molyneux does not suggest any action, his 'problem' may be better viewed as an ill-posed question—at least from a neuroscientific perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Ghazanfar, A. A. &amp; Turesson, H. K. (2008). Speech production: How does a word feel? ''Current Biology'', ''18'',24: R1142–1144.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

One reason that Molyneux's Problem could be posed in the first place is the extreme dearth of human subjects who gain vision after extended congenital blindness.  Alberto Valvo estimated that fewer than twenty cases have been known in the last 1000 years.&lt;ref&gt;Valvo, A. (1971). Sight restoration after long-term blindness: The problems and behavior patterns of visual rehabilitation. New York: American Foundation for the Blind.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ostrovsky, et al.,&lt;ref&gt;Ostrovsky, et al., "Vision following extended congenital blindness", Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences Massachusetts Institute of Technology&lt;/ref&gt; studied a woman who gained sight at the age of 12 when she underwent surgery for dense bilateral congenital cataracts.  They report that the subject could recognize family members by sight six months after surgery, but took up to a year to recognize most household objects purely by sight.

In 2003, [[Pawan Sinha]], a professor at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], set up a program in the framework of the Project Prakash&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projectprakash.org/|title=Project Prakash|website=Project Prakash}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually had the opportunity to find five individuals who satisfied the requirements for an experiment aimed at answering Molyneux's question experimentally.  Prior to treatment, the subjects (aged 8 to 17) were only able to discriminate between light and dark, with two of them also being able to determine the direction of a bright light. The surgical treatments took place between 2007 and 2010, and quickly brought the relevant subject from total congenital blindness to fully seeing.  A carefully designed test was submitted to each subject within the next 48 hours.  Based on its result, the experimenters concluded that the answer, in short, to Molyneux's problem is "no". Although after restoration of sight, the subjects could distinguish between objects visually almost as effectively as they would do by touch alone, they were unable to form the connection between an object perceived using the two different senses. The correlation was barely better than if the subjects had guessed.  They had no innate ability to transfer their tactile shape knowledge to the visual domain.  However, the experimenters could test three of the five subjects on later dates (5 days, 7 days, and 5 months after, respectively) and found that the performance in the touch-to-vision case improved significantly, reaching 80–90%.&lt;ref name=Held2011&gt;

In law, the terms '''moot''' and '''mootness''' have different meanings in [[British English]] and [[American English]].

In the [[Law of the United States|legal system of the United States]], a matter is '''moot''' if further legal proceedings with regard to it can have no effect, or events have placed it beyond the reach of the law.  Thereby the matter has been deprived of practical significance or rendered purely academic. The U.S. development of this word stems from the practice of [[moot court]]s, in which hypothetical or fictional cases were argued as a part of legal education.  These purely academic issues led the U.S. courts to describe cases where developing circumstances made any judgment ineffective as "moot".  The doctrine can be compared to the [[ripeness]] doctrine, another judge-made rule, that holds that judges should not rule on cases based entirely on anticipated disputes or hypothetical facts.  Similar doctrines prevent the federal courts of the United States from issuing [[advisory opinion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=matthew_hall |last1=Hall |first1=Mathew I |title=The Partially Prudential Doctrine of Mootness |volume=77 |work=George Washington Law Review |page=562 |date=August 2008 |publisher=[[University of the Pacific (United States)|University of the Pacific]], [[McGeorge School of Law]] |accessdate=August 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is different from the usage in the [[Law of the United Kingdom|British legal system]], where the term "moot" has the meaning of "debatable". The shift in usage was first observed in the [[United States]].

==U.S. federal courts==
In the U.S. federal judicial system, a moot case must be dismissed, there being a constitutional limitation on the jurisdiction of the federal courts. The reason for this is that [[Article Three of the United States Constitution]] limits the jurisdiction of all federal courts to "[[cases and controversies]]". Thus, a civil action or appeal in which the court's decision will not affect the rights of the parties is ordinarily beyond the power of the court to decide, provided it does not fall within one of the recognized exceptions.

A textbook example of such a case is the [[United States Supreme Court]] case ''[[DeFunis v. Odegaard]]'', {{ussc|416|312|1974}}.  The plaintiff was a student who had been denied admission to [[law school]], and had then been provisionally admitted during the pendency of the case. Because the student was slated to graduate within a few months at the time the decision was rendered, and there was no action the law school could take to prevent that, the Court determined that a decision on its part would have no effect on the student's rights. Therefore, the case was dismissed as moot.

However, there is disagreement as to both the source of the standards, and their application in the courts.  Some courts and observers opine that cases ''must'' be dismissed because this is a constitutional bar, and there is no "case or controversy"; others have rejected the pure constitutional approach and adopted a so-called "prudential" view, where dismissal ''may'' depend upon a host of factors, whether the particular person has lost a viable interest in the case, or whether the issue itself survives outside the interests of the particular person, whether the circumstance are likely to recur, etc.  In actual practice, the U.S. federal courts have been uneven in their decisions, which has led to the accusation that determinations are ''[[ad hoc]]'' and 'result-oriented.'&lt;ref&gt;Hall, supra.{{page needed|date=August 2016}}{{nonspecific|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four major exceptions to this mootness rule. These are cases of "voluntary cessation" on the part of the [[defendant]]; questions that involve secondary or collateral legal consequences; questions that are "capable of ''repetition,'' yet evading review"; and questions involving [[class action]]s where the named party ceases to represent the class.

===Voluntary cessation===
Where a defendant is acting wrongfully, but ceases to engage in such conduct once a [[litigation]] has been threatened or commenced, the court will still not deem this correction to moot the case. Obviously, a party could stop acting improperly just long enough for the case to be dismissed and then resume the improper conduct. For example, in ''[[Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services, Inc.]]'', {{ussc|528|167|2000}}, the Supreme Court held that an industrial polluter, against whom various deterrent civil penalties were being pursued, could not claim that the case was moot, even though the polluter had ceased polluting and had closed the factory responsible for the pollution. The court noted that so long as the polluter still retained its license to operate such a factory, it could open similar operations elsewhere if not deterred by the penalties sought.

Another example occurs when a court dismisses as "moot" a legal challenge to an existing law, where the law being challenged is either amended or repealed through legislation before the court case could be settled.  A recent instance of this occurred in ''[[Moore v. Madigan]],'' when Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan declined to appeal a ruling of the Seventh Circuit United States Court of Appeals striking down Illinois handgun carry ban to the [[United States Supreme Court]], as Illinois subsequently passed a law legalizing concealed carry with a state-issued license, which rendered the case moot.

===Secondary or collateral legal consequences===
"The obvious fact of life is that most criminal convictions do in fact entail adverse collateral legal consequences. The mere possibility that this will be the case is enough to preserve a criminal case from ending ignominiously in the limbo of mootness." Sibron v. New York.

===Capable of repetition, yet evading review===
A court will allow a case to go forward if it is the type for which persons will frequently be faced with a particular situation, but will likely cease to be in a position where the court can provide a remedy for them in the time that it takes for the justice system to address their situation. The most frequently cited example is the 1973 United States Supreme Court case of ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', {{ussc|410|113|1973}}, which challenged a [[Texas]] law forbidding [[abortion]] in most circumstances. The state argued that the case was moot because plaintiff [[Norma McCorvey|Roe]] was no longer pregnant by the time the case was heard.  As [[Harry Blackmun|Justice Blackmun]] wrote in the majority opinion:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The normal 266-day human gestation period is so short that the pregnancy will come to term before the usual appellate process is complete. If that termination makes a case moot, pregnancy litigation seldom will survive much beyond the trial stage, and appellate review will be effectively denied. Our law should not be that rigid.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Norma McCorvey, whose alias was Roe, became a [[pro-life]] advocate and attempted to have the decision of ''Roe v. Wade'' reversed and in ''[[McCorvey v. Hill]]'', 2004, the case failed to proceed based on being moot, without [[standing (law)|standing]] and out of time.&lt;ref&gt;[[Statute of limitations]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court cited ''[[Southern Pacific Terminal Co. v. ICC]]'', {{ussc|219|498|1911}}, which had held that a case was not moot when it presented an issue that was "capable of repetition, yet evading review". Perhaps in response to increasing workloads at all levels of the judiciary, the recent trend in the Supreme Court and other U.S. courts has been to construe this exception rather narrowly.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

Many cases fall under the "capable of repetition" doctrine; however, because there is a review process available under most circumstances, the exception to declaring mootness did not apply to such cases.  In ''Memphis Light, Gas &amp; Water Div. v. Craft'', 436 U. S. 1, 8–9 (1978), the court noted that claims for [[damages]] save cases from mootness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-351.pdf |title=Slip: ''Alvarez v. Smith'' (2009)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Class action representatives===
Where a class action lawsuit is brought, with one named plaintiff actually representing the interests of many others, the case will not become moot even if the named plaintiff ceases to belong to the class that is seeking a remedy. In ''[[Sosna v. Iowa]]'', {{ussc|419|393|1975}}, the plaintiff represented a class that was challenging an [[Iowa]] law that required persons to reside there for a year before seeking a [[divorce]] in Iowa's courts. The Supreme Court held that, although the plaintiff successfully divorced in another state, her [[Lawyer|attorneys]] could continue to competently advance the interests of other members of the class.

==U.S. state courts==
The [[U.S. state]] courts are not subject to the Article III limitations on their jurisdiction, and some state courts are permitted by their local constitutions and laws to render opinions in moot cases where the establishment of a legal precedent is desirable.  They may also establish exceptions to the doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hawaiiopinions.blogspot.com/2008/10/prejudice-pushes-aside-mootness.html Prejudice Pushes Aside Mootness Doctrine Hamilton v. Lethem] (HSC October 14, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in some state courts the prosecution can lodge an appeal after a defendant is acquitted: although the appellate court cannot set aside a not-guilty verdict due to [[double jeopardy]], it can issue a ruling as to whether a trial court's ruling on a particular issue during the trial was erroneous. This opinion will then be binding on future cases heard by the courts of that state.

Some U.S. states also accept [[certified question]]s from the federal courts or the courts of other states. Under these procedures, state courts can issue opinions, usually for the purpose of clarifying or updating state law, in cases not actually pending in those courts.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Indiana Rules of Appellate Procedure, Title XI, Rule 64, "Certified Questions of State Law From Federal Courts".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outside the U.S.==
Although free from the U.S. Constitutional limitation, Canada has recognized that considerations of judicial economy and [[comity]] with the legislative and executive branch may justify a decision to dismiss an allegedly moot case, as deciding hypothetical controversies is tantamount to legislating.  Considerations of the effectiveness of advocacy involved in the adversarial system and the possibility of recurrence of an alleged constitutional violation may sway the court.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dj_4_H35nmYC&amp;pg=PA286 Morton, Frederick Lee, (March 2002) ''Law, politics, and the judicial process in Canada'' (BPR Publishers) 660pp.] {{ISBN|978-1-55238-046-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the federal and provincial governments can ask for advisory opinions in hypothetical scenarios, termed [[reference question]]s, from their respective highest courts.

==Moot point==
The phrase '''[[wikt:moot point|moot point]]''' refers (in American English) to an issue that is irrelevant to a subject being discussed or, in British English, one that is debatable. Due to the relatively uncommon usage of the word moot, and because "moot" and "mute" are [[homophone]]s in some pronunciations, this is sometimes erroneously rendered as "mute point".&lt;ref&gt;[http://public.wsu.edu/~brians/errors/mute.html Mute Point/Moot Point], from Paul Brians, ''Common Errors in English Usage'' (3rd Edition), William, James Co. November, 2013 (retrieved April 16 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8500">The '''Motherpeace Tarot''' is a deck of [[tarot]] cards inspired by the [[Goddess movement]] and [[second-wave feminism]]. Created in the 1970s, it has never been out of print, and in 2017 was given a new lease of life in a [[Christian Dior]] fashion collection.

==Background==
At the time this deck was created, the [[feminist movement]] was experiencing a surge in popularity.  Women were empowering themselves in a variety of ways, but a great deal of attention was placed on [[feminist art]] and the relationships forged between the artist, the work, and the viewer. This time period is often viewed as one of the most progressive eras of feminist artwork.&lt;ref&gt;Broude, Garrard, and Brodsky, power of feminist art: the American movement of the 1970s, history and impact (New York: H.N. Abrams, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; Although the mood of the 1970s was reported to be somewhat dark and uncertain, particularly in the Berkeley area where Vogel and Noble resided, the empowerment that many women gained through exploring their spirituality and artistic selves helped to push them through the decade.&lt;ref&gt;William Graebner, Patty's Got A Gun (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;


==Artistic creation==
Motherpeace was created by two women from [[Berkeley, California]], [[Karen Vogel]] and [[Vicki Noble]], friends who had studied anthropology, women's studies and history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Tali |first1=Didem |title=The tarot revival thanks to Brexit, Trump and Dior |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-44471537 |accessdate=17 June 2018 |work=BBC News |date=17 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1970s, Vogel and Noble were roommates who shared common interests in [[Goddess spirituality]], [[psychic]] studies, and the [[occult]]. One night in 1978, inspiration struck in an event where "Karen felt our room literally tilt, and Vicki proceeded to have a life changing vision of Goddess energy and transmission of ancient wisdom."&lt;ref name="Motherpeace Tarot"&gt;"Motherpeace Tarot :: Welcome", n.d., http://www.motherpeace.com/index.php.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, they began devising a feminist deck based on their knowledge of history, alternative healing, and psychic studies.&lt;ref name="Origins of the Motherpeace Tarot"&gt;{{cite web|title=Origins of the Motherpeace Tarot|url=http://www.motherpeace.com/index.php?loc=origins|accessdate=September 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbolism==
According to ''A Cultural History of Tarot'', Motherpeace was designed to "fulfil a feminist agenda", with round cards to represent the Moon, "long associated with female energies and the Mother Goddess", and symbology drawn from cultures across the world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Farley |first1=Helen |title=A cultural history of tarot : from entertainment to esotericism |date=2009 |publisher=I. B. Tauris |location=London |isbn=9781848850538 |edition=[Online-Ausg.]. }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Vogel and Noble's artwork is a departure from more traditional tarot iconography such as the [[Rider-Waite tarot deck|Rider-Waite-Smith]] deck, as it features predominantly female figures. Inspiration for the deck comes from myth and literature by and about women, including Greek and [[Roman mythology]], and contemporary writers such as [[Alice Walker]]. Vogel and Noble explored feminism on each continent. They followed traditions back to their origins, finding out how important women were in indigenous cultures. The Goddess was a very important figure in ancient cultures.&lt;ref name="Origins of the Motherpeace Tarot"/&gt; All of the scenes depicted are centered on women.  The images are meant to focus on the importance of ritual, artistic expression, uniqueness and the idea of a culture that supports one another.&lt;ref name="Motherpeace Tarot" /&gt;

The round shape of the cards is significant.  The departure from the normally rectangular shape is meant to represent fertility of women.&lt;ref name="Motherpeace Tarot" /&gt;  This draws from classic feminist artwork which also uses many different [[fertility symbol|symbols of fertility]] and femininity.&lt;ref&gt;Zajko and Leonard, Laughing with Medusa: classical myth and feminist thought, Classical presences (New York: Oxford University Press, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the round shape is not particular to this single deck. Fiona Morgan also created her own deck with round cards. The cards are hard to handle because of their shape but skilled hands can handle them deftly.&lt;ref name="Greer 2002 216"&gt;{{cite book|last=Greer|first=Mary K.|title=Tarot for your self a workbook for personal transformation|year=2002|publisher=New Page Books|location=Franklin Lakes, NJ|pages=216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural legacy==
Motherpeace was so influential in one strand of lesbian culture of the 1980s that it serves as a chapter title in the memoir of New Zealand academic Aorewa McLeod&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McLeod |first1=Aorewa |title=Who was that woman, anyway? : snapshots of a lesbian life |date=2013 |publisher=Victoria University Press |location=Wellington, N.Z. |isbn=9780864738783 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, and a shorthand for the [[lesbian feminist]] experience in London&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.takahe.org.nz/oldsite/reviews/t79/Takahe79WhoWasThatWoman.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In 2017, [[Christian Dior]], the fashion house, approached Vogel and Noble for permission to design clothing based on the pair's 1970s artwork. This was one of the first shows since [[Maria Grazia Chiuri]] became [[creative director]]. The ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' review of the "Resort" collection picked out the dress using the motif from the Death card; Vogel explained the metaphor of renewal rather than physical death. This marked the first time that Vogel and Noble had allowed any use of their images, saying that the time felt right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Meet the Makers of Motherpeace Tarot, the Feminist Deck That Inspired Dior’s Resort Collection |url=https://www.vogue.com/article/dior-resort-2018-motherpeace |accessdate=17 June 2018 |work=Vogue |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the release of the "ethereal" ''[[haute couture]]'' dresses, sales of Motherpeace Tarot doubled in a few months, and sales of other tarot decks increased as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Tali |first1=Didem |title=The tarot revival thanks to Brexit, Trump and Dior |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-44471537 |accessdate=17 June 2018 |work=BBC News |date=17 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences==
There are some differences between the Motherpeace deck and more traditional tarot decks.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce Goggin, "A History of Otherness: Tarot and Playing Cards from Early Modern Europe," Journal for the Academic Study of Magic, no. 1 (2003): 45-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

These changes bring the mind back to the family, rather than the monarchy that no longer exists. By having these characters instead of the originals, the Motherpeace deck suggests that we can make our own future.&lt;ref name="Greer 2002 216"/&gt;

==Methodology==
{{See also|Tarotology}}
This deck has its own tarot spread, consisting of eleven cards laid out in a circular pattern. The circle is the symbol of women and femininity (see [[Planet_symbols#Venus|Venus symbol]]). The cards are read in a particular pattern, each position meaning something different. 

1 Who or where you are at the moment.

2 Atmosphere what's behind the question.

3 Cross Current The lesson you need to learn. 

4 Root unconscious influences in the body.

'''''Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity''''' is an 1802 work of [[Christian apologetics]] and [[philosophy of religion]] by the English clergyman [[William Paley]] (July 1743 – 25 May 1805). The book expounds his arguments from [[natural theology]], making a [[teleological argument]] for the [[existence of God]], notably beginning with the [[watchmaker analogy]].

The book was written in the context of the natural theology tradition. In earlier centuries, theologians such as [[John Ray]] and [[William Derham]], as well as philosophers of classical times such as [[Cicero]], argued for the existence and goodness of God from the general well-being of living things and the physical world.

Paley's ''Natural Theology'' is an extended argument, constructed around a series of examples including finding a watch; comparing the eye to a telescope; and the existence of finely adapted mechanical structures in animals, such as joints which function like hinges or manmade ball and socket joints. Paley argues that these all lead to an intelligent Creator, and that a [[system]] is more than the sum of its parts. The last chapters are more theological in character, arguing that the attributes of God must be sufficient for the extent of his operations, and that God must be good because designs seen in nature are beneficial.

The book was many times republished and remains in print. It continues to be consulted by [[creationism|creationists]]. [[Charles Darwin]] took its arguments seriously and responded to them; evolutionary biologists like [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Richard Dawkins]] continue to discuss Paley's book to respond to modern proponents with similar ideas.

==Context==

The main thrust of [[William Paley]]'s argument in ''Natural Theology'' is that God's design of the whole creation can be seen in the general happiness, or well-being, that is evident in the physical and social order of things. This sets the book within the broad tradition of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]'s [[natural theology]]; and this explains why Paley based much of his thought on [[John Ray]] (1691), [[William Derham]] (1711) and [[Bernard Nieuwentyt]] (1750).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Eddy, Matthew Daniel  |author2=Knight, David M.  |lastauthoramp=yes | work=Introduction | title=William Paley, Natural Theology | year=2006 | publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paley's argument is built mainly around [[anatomy]] and [[natural history]]. "For my part", he says, "I take my stand in human anatomy"; elsewhere he insists upon "the necessity, in each particular case, of an intelligent designing mind for the contriving and determining of the forms which organized bodies bear". In making his argument, Paley employed a wide variety of metaphors and analogies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Eddy, Matthew Daniel | title=The Science and Rhetoric of Paley's Natural Theology | journal=Literature and Theology | year=2004 | volume=18 | pages=1–22 | doi=10.1093/litthe/18.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most famous is his analogy between a watch and the world. Historians, philosophers and theologians often call this the [[watchmaker analogy]]. Building on this mechanical analogy, Paley presents examples from planetary astronomy and argues that the regular movements of the solar system resemble the workings of a giant clock.  To bolster his views he cites the work of his old friend [[John Law (bishop)|John Law]] and the Dublin Astronomer Royal [[John Brinkley (astronomer)|John Brinkley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Eddy, Matthew Daniel | title=Natural Theology | year=2008 | publisher=Oxford University Press | pages=Appendix entry on Brinkley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The germ of the idea is to be found in ancient writers who used [[sundial]]s and [[Ptolemy|Ptolemaic]] [[epicycle]]s to illustrate the divine order of the world.  These types of examples can be seen in the work of the ancient philosopher [[Cicero]], especially in his ''[[De Natura Deorum]]'', ii. 87 and 97.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hallam |first=Henry |title=Introduction to the Literature of Europe, Vol II |year=1847 |publisher=Murray |location=London |page=385}}&lt;/ref&gt; The watch analogy was widely used in the Enlightenment, by [[Deism|deists]] &lt;!--such as [[Voltaire]] --&gt;and Christians alike. &lt;!--Thus, Paley's use of the watch (and other mechanical objects like it) in 1802 continued a long tradition of analogical reasoning.--&gt;

==Outline==
[[File:Paley Natural Theology Page 1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The first page of ''Natural Theology'', introducing Paley's version of the [[watchmaker analogy]]]]

;Chapter I. State of the Argument
:The basic [[watchmaker analogy]]: if you find a watch, you suppose there's a watchmaker.

;Chapter II. State of the Argument continued
:Now the watch can [[reproduction|reproduce]] itself. Paley argues that the watchmaker must have power, and specific intentions.

;Chapter III. Application of the Argument
:Paley says it is atheism not to agree with the watchmaker argument. He compares the eye to a telescope, and argues from the eye's construction.

;Chapter IV Of the Succession of Plants and Animals
:Paley argues from the properties of plant seeds and animal eggs.

;Chapter V. Application of the Argument continued
:The argument is extended to 'all the organized parts of the works of nature'. Paley considers whether chance alone could explain these, and concludes not.

;Chapter VI. The Argument cumulative
:No argument, writes Paley, other than 'the necessity of an intelligent Creator', can explain the eye (or any other elaborate living structure).

;Chapter VII. Of the Mechanical And Immechanical Parts and Functions of Animals and Vegetables
:Animals use muscles to move; even if we don't understand how they work, we can see they work mechanically, argues Paley, moving joints to and fro. Other organs such as the stomach work chemically to digest food.

;Chapter VIII. Of Mechanical Arrangement in the human Frame
:The bones and joints form a mechanical structure with features comparable to hinges, [[mortice and tenon]] and [[ball and socket]] joints, etc, to provide both support and suitable flexibility. He compares the spine to [[The Iron Bridge]] at Bishop Wearmouth.

;Chapter IX. Of the Muscles
:The muscles exactly relate to the joints, operating them mechanically like the wires and strings of a puppet. A complex case is the tongue. [[Sphincter]] muscles are admired also.

;Chapter X. Of the Vessels of Animal Bodies
:The [[blood vessel]]s and [[lymph vessel]]s are considered, the [[Heart valve|valves of the heart]], and the separate functions of arteries and veins. Paley argues that such functions as that of the [[epiglottis]] could not have formed gradually (as by [[evolution]]).

;Chapter XI. Of the Animal Structure regarded as a Mass
:Paley considers the [[bilateral symmetry]] of animals, and how well-packaged all the delicate organs are, resulting in both beauty and utility.

[[File:Crossbill skull and jaw anatomy from Yarrell History of British Birds 1843 (detail).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Red crossbill]] skull and jaw anatomy from [[William Yarrell]]'s ''[[A History of British Birds (1843)|A History of British Birds]]''; the crossbill's beak is cited by Paley as being well-suited to its function.]]
;Chapter XII. Comparative Anatomy
:Paley considers the equivalents of human anatomy in other animals. Human clothing is compared to the fur, feathers, quills and scales of animals. The structure of the feather is admired. The teeth and jaws of [[carnivore]]s, [[herbivore]]s and [[omnivore]]s are considered. Similarly, the adaptations of birds' bills in species like the [[crossbill]], [[spoonbill]] and (long-billed) [[snipe]] are discussed.

;Chapter XIII. Peculiar Organizations
:Paley considers organs which seem to have no comparison, like the oil glands of birds and [[swim bladder]]s of fishes.

;Chapter XIV. Prospective Contrivances
:Paley considers how some structures are seen to be prepared for future function, like the milk-teeth of a baby, ready formed inside the gums at birth. Similarly, the circulation of the foetus is supported by temporary short-circuits with the ''[[foramen ovale (heart)|foramen ovale]]'' and the ''[[ductus arteriosus]]'', as the lungs are not yet in use for breathing.

;Chapter XV. Relations
:Paley considers how the whole of a [[system]] is more than the sum of its parts. This is seen to be so both in a mechanical watch and in living systems.

;Chapter XVI. Compensation
:The 'defects' of one organ are remedied by the structure of another. The [[elephant]] has, Paley argues, a short neck because its head is so heavy, but in compensation it has a long trunk, enabling it to reach out. Similarly the [[spider]] has no wings to enable it to chase its flying prey, but has a web, and organs adapted to produce it, which compensates for the lack.

;Chapter XVII. The Relation of animated Bodies to inanimate Nature
:Organs such as the [[wing (bird)|wing]]s of birds and the [[fin]]s of fish are expressly adapted to the surrounding '[[Classical elements|elements]]' of air or water in which they operate.

;Chapter XVIII. Instincts
:[[Instinct]]s enable newly-hatched young of salmon to find food, and later to [[fish migration|migrate]] to the sea and finally back to their rivers to spawn.

[[File:Ichneumonidae - Rhyssa persuasoria.JPG|thumb|Paley mentions the [[ovipositor]]s of insects such as [[Ichneumonidae|ichneumons]], able to lay eggs deep in wood.]] 
;Chapter XIX. Of Insects
:"WE are not writing a system of natural history", begins Paley, apologising for not covering every class systematically. He mentions insects for some examples unique to them, as the [[antenna (biology)|antennae]], [[elytra]] (scaly wing-cases), [[ovipositor]]s (he calls them 'awls') for laying eggs deep in plants or wood, [[stinger|stings]], the [[proboscis]] of bees, the light-producing organ of the [[glow-worm]] and so on.

;Chapter XX. Of Plants
:Admitting that plants generally have less obvious evidence of 'a designed and studied mechanism' than animals, still Paley adds some examples, as of the parts of the seed, the delicate germ being protected by a tough or spiny husk, and [[seed dispersal|dispersed]] by wings or other appendages.

;Chapter XXI. Of the Elements
:Paley considers how the 'elements' of water, air etc are exactly as needed.

;Chapter XXII. Astronomy
:Paley admits that astronomy is not the best proof of 'the agency of an intelligent Creator', but all the same it shows his magnificence.

;Chapter XXIII. Personality of the Deity
:All the above items show the 'contrivances' in existence, which Paley argues prove the personality of the Deity, arguing that only persons can contrive or design.

;Chapter XXIV. Of the natural Attributes of the Deity
:The attributes of God must, Paley argues, be 'adequate to the magnitude, extent, and multiplicity of his operations'.

;Chapter XXV. Of the Unity of the Deity
:Paley argues that the uniformity of plan seen in the universe indicates a single God.

;Chapter XXVI. The Goodness of the Deity
:God must be good, Paley argues, because in many cases the designs seen in nature are beneficial, and because animals perceive pleasure, beyond what would be strictly necessary. Pain is admitted to exist, but even such things as venomous bites of snakes exist to a good end, namely defence or the capture of prey. Pain too is mitigated, as in intervals between the acute pain of [[gout]] which are beneficial to sufferers. The appearance of chance, too, is necessary in the world.

;Chapter XXVII. Conclusion
:Paley concludes that natural theology offers many proofs of the goodness of God, though any one would be sufficient. The many proofs show that the conclusion is stable, and together they can make a suitable impression on those who study them.

==Editions==

The first edition of ''Natural Theology: or, Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity'' was published in 1802 in London by J. Faulder.&lt;ref name=1st&gt;{{citation | author=Paley, William | year=1802 | title=Natural Theology: or, Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity | edition=1st | publication-place=London | publisher=J.

==Topics of dispute==
[[File:Allan Ramsay - David Hume, 1711 - 1776. Historian and philosopher - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|The Scottish philosopher [[David Hume]], portrayed here by [[Allan Ramsay (artist)|Allan Ramsay]] in 1766, criticised arguments from design; he did not live to see Paley's book.]]

===Philosophy===
The Scottish philosopher [[David Hume]] (who died in 1776, before Paley assembled his arguments into ''Natural Theology'') had criticised arguments from design on several grounds. Firstly, he rejected the making of an [[analogy]] between the world and a human artifact such as a watch, since these are so dissimilar that any analogy must be very weak and unreliable. Secondly, Hume argued that even if one accepted the analogy, it would not prove that the creator is infinite, good, or perfectly intelligent,&lt;ref name=HumepartII&gt;{{cite book | title=Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion | author=Hume, David | authorlink=David Hume | publisher=Social Sciences Publishers | edition=with introduction by Norman Kemp Smith | year=1948 | chapter=Part II}}&lt;/ref&gt; nor that there would be only one creator god. After all, wrote Hume, "what shadow of an argument… can you produce from your hypothesis to prove the unity of the Deity? A great number of men join in building a house or ship, in rearing a city, in framing a commonwealth; why may not several deities combine in contriving and framing a world?"&lt;ref name=HumepartV&gt;{{cite book | title=Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion | author=Hume, David | authorlink=David Hume | publisher=Social Sciences Publishers | edition=with introduction by Norman Kemp Smith | year=1948 | chapter=Part V}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To counter the first argument, Paley strongly defended the analogy, emphasising complex mechanisms in living organisms seen as machines designed for purpose and contending that, in a sense "That an animal is a machine is neither correctly true nor wholly false". In replying to the second argument, Paley made a tactical retreat from traditional attributes of God to a more limited definition, in which unity went "no further than to a unity of counsel". It sufficed that God demonstrated plan, intelligence and foresight, had inconceivable power, and showed goodness through perceived design being beneficial in the clear majority of cases.{{sfn | Burbridge| 1998|pp=64–65}}

===Evolutionary biology: Buffon and Erasmus Darwin===
Early evolutionary ideas presented a new threat to the analogy between living organisms and designed object, as life differs in reproducing itself. In chapter XXIII Paley explicitly dismissed [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]]'s concept of "organic molecules", then turned to an unattributed concept: "Another system, which has lately been brought forward, and with much ingenuity, is that of ''appetencies''": the term and his description clearly refer to [[Erasmus Darwin]]'s concept of [[transmutation of species]], as set out in ''[[Zoonomia]]''. Paley objected to it dispensing with "the necessity, in each particular case, of an intelligent, designing mind", and to it lacking evidence or observations of the process. More specifically, Darwin had adopted the common idea of [[inheritance of acquired characteristics]], and Paley raised objections including the persistence of unused male nipples, and (discreetly put in Latin) the effect of circumcision not being inherited by generations of Jews.{{sfn | Burbridge| 1998|pp=65–66}}

Throughout the book, Paley presented difficulties in examples or analogies that had been presented to support evolutionary explanations or the doctrine of "appetencies". He objected that Erasmus Darwin's concept could only explain adaptation directly relating to activity, and could not explain passive adaptation.{{sfn | Burbridge| 1998|pp=66–67}}

==Opinions on Paley's arguments==

===Contemporary reception===

The ''[[Edinburgh Review]]'' of 1802-3 commented that&lt;ref name=ER&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Anon |title=Art. III. Review of Natural Theology by William Paley |journal=Edinburgh Review |origyear=1802-03 |volume=1 |pages=287–305 |url=http://www.sciper.org/browse/ER1-1.html |accessdate=9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|With less learning and less originality than some of his distinguished predecessors [such as John Ray and William Derham, who are mentioned], it would be difficult, perhaps, to point out his superior in soundness of judgement, or in vigilant and comprehensive sagacity. With great strength of reasoning and power of decision, he has also united more moderation and liberality of sentiment, than is usually to be found among disputants; and added weight to his argument by a certain plainness and sobriety of manner, that is infinitely better calculated to produce conviction than the sallies of an ambitious eloquence.&lt;ref name=ER/&gt;}}

The review agreed with Paley that "No thinking man, we conceive, can doubt that there are marks of design in the universe" and that either a single example like the eye would be conclusive, or no quantity of examples would be. Paley is praised for relying on "mechanical phenomena" rather than arguments about human intelligence.&lt;ref name=ER/&gt;

The bible commentator William Jenks described the book in 1838 as "a work highly celebrated for the justness of its reflections, and the benevolence, good sense, and piety which it breathes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Jenks |editor1-first=William |title=The Comprehensive Commentary on the Holy Bible |date=1838 | page=172 |publisher=Fessenden &amp; Company |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0oRVAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA172&amp;lpg=RA2-PA172&amp;dq=William+Paley+%22Natural+Theology+or+Evidences+of+the+Existence+and+Attributes+of+the+Deity%22+editions+early+versions+translations&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=AGPhHAuldM&amp;sig=1wHS7Hgcn1vfBekAakHNXJlNoi0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=aYhfVOGJFYve7AbW_ICoAg&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |chapter=Paley, William, D.D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charles Darwin and evolutionary biology===
[[File:Charles Darwin by G. Richmond.png|thumb|upright|In the late 1830s, [[Charles Darwin]] re-read Paley's book.]]

{{further|Teleology in biology}}

[[Charles Darwin]]'s studies at the [[University of Cambridge]] included two other texts by Paley, and in his final exams in January 1831 he did well in questions on these texts. He had to stay on until June, and read Paley's ''Natural Theology'' as well as [[John Herschel]]'s ''Preliminary Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy'' and [[Alexander von Humboldt]]'s ''Personal Narrative'': these books inspired "a burning zeal" to research [[natural history]]. After the [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|''Beagle'' voyage]] he began development of his theory of [[natural selection]],{{sfn|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=87–88}} and in 1838 opened a notebook listing "books to be read", including "Paley's Nat. Theology".&lt;ref&gt;Darwin C. R. 'Books to be read' and 'Books Read' notebook. (1838-1851) CUL-DAR119, [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=22&amp;itemID=CUL-DAR119.-&amp;viewtype=side 12v]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1859, on completing ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', he told a friend "I do not think I hardly ever admired a book more than Paley's ''Natural Theology'': I could almost formerly have said it by heart."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Letter no. 2532, Charles Darwin to John Lubbock |date=22 November 1859 | website=Darwin Correspondence Project | url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/letter/DCP-LETT-2532.xml | accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He later stated in his autobiography that he was initially convinced by the argument:

{{Quote|Although I did not think much about the existence of a personal God until a considerably later period of my life, I will here give the vague conclusions to which I have been driven. The old argument of design in nature, as given by Paley, which formerly seemed to me so conclusive, fails, now that the law of natural selection has been discovered. We can no longer argue that, for instance, the beautiful hinge of a bivalve shell must have been made by an intelligent being, like the hinge of a door by man. There seems to be no more design in the variability of organic beings and in the action of natural selection, than in the course which the wind blows. Everything in nature is the result of fixed laws.|Charles Darwin|The Autobiography of Charles Darwin 1809–1882.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [https://books.google.com/books?id=UFY18Bep5ygC&amp;pg=PA94 The Portable Atheist], edited by Christopher Hitchens, Da Capo Press, 2007. p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Modern evolutionary biology===
In 1993 the [[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologist]] [[Stephen Jay Gould]] compared Paley to [[Voltaire]]'s [[Doctor Pangloss]], the man who could argue any case (however hopeless). Gould is struck that Paley can claim that even the agonising pain of [[gallstone]]s or [[gout]] could indicate the goodness of a loving God, with the justification that it felt so good when the pain stopped. Gould makes it clear he finds Paley's argument incorrect scientifically, but states that he respects it as a coherent and well-defended philosophy. Gould particularly respects Paley's method of identifying alternative possibilities and then systematically refuting them. Gould notes that Paley envisages a [[Lamarckism|Lamarckist]] kind of evolution and rebuts it with the observation that men have not lost their nipples through disuse. However, Gould writes, Paley did not manage to think of one more alternative, [[natural selection]], which has no purpose at all but just kills off whatever works less well in every generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Eight Little Piggies: Reflections in Natural History | publisher=Vintage | author=Gould, Stephen Jay | year=2007 | origyear=1993 | pages=142–148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] described himself as a ''neo-Paleyan'' in ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'' (1986), where he argued, following the evolutionary biologist and humanist [[Julian Huxley]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Evolution as Process | author=Huxley, Julian | authorlink=Julian Huxley | publisher=Harper and Row | year=1953 | page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Paley's watch analogy fails to recognise the difference between the complexity of living [[organism]]s and that of inanimate objects. Living organisms can reproduce themselves, so they can change to become more complex from generation to generation. Inanimate objects such as watches are unable to pass on any changes, so they never become more complex unless a watchmaker redesigns them. The comparison breaks down, in Dawkins's view, because of this important distinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Dawkins|title=The Blind Watchmaker: Why the Evidence of Evolution Reveals a Universe Without Design | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sPpaZnZMDG0C | accessdate=20 September 2014 | year=1986 | publisher=W.W. Norton | isbn=978-0-393-31570-7 | pages=43–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creationism===
The arguments in Paley's book have been rejected by "virtually all biologists".&lt;ref name=NCSE&gt;{{cite journal |title=William Paley, 1743–1805| author=Moore, Randy |journal=Reports of the National Center for Science Education |date=2009 |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=26–27 |url=http://ncse.com/rncse/29/4/william-paley-1743-1805}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its place, the theory of [[evolution]] has been widely accepted by scientists from Darwin onwards,&lt;ref name=Rafferty&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rafferty |first1=John P |title=New Thinking about Evolution |date=2011 |publisher=Rosen |page=53 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iP7HCYLRELsC&amp;pg=PA53}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Darwin persuaded "most educated people" that processes such as evolution were governed by natural laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bowler |first1=Peter J. |title=Evolution: The History of an Idea |date=2003 |publisher=University of California Press |page=178 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gJXmS49Q7r0C&amp;pg=PA178}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has not stopped [[creationist]]s such as those in the [[Intelligent Design]] movement from continuing to use Paley's arguments:&lt;ref name=NCSE/&gt;

{{quote|Although proponents of ID claim that their premises differ from Paley's, and, unlike Paley, do not specify who or what the designer is, most evolutionary biologists see ID as a version of Paley's arguments updated to account for advances in our understanding of biology."&lt;ref name=NCSE/&gt;}}

{{Confucianism}}
'''Neo-Confucianism''' ({{zh|t=宋明理學|p=Sòng-Míng lǐxué}}, often shortened to ''lixue'' 理學) is a [[morality|moral]], [[ethics|ethical]], and [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] [[Chinese philosophy]] influenced by [[Confucianism]], and originated with [[Han Yu]] and [[Li Ao (philosopher)|Li Ao]] (772–841) in the [[Tang Dynasty]], and became prominent during the [[Song Dynasty|Song]] and [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] dynasties.

Neo-Confucianism was an attempt  to create a more rationalist and secular form of [[Confucianism]] by rejecting superstitious and mystical elements of [[Taoism]] and [[Buddhism]] that had influenced Confucianism during and after the Han Dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Blocker |first=H. Gene|last2= Starling |first2=Christopher L.|year=2001 | page= 64|title=Japanese Philosophy|publisher=SUNY Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the neo-Confucianists were critical of Taoism and Buddhism, the two did have an influence on the philosophy, and the neo-Confucianists borrowed terms and concepts However, unlike the Buddhists and Taoists, who saw [[metaphysics]] as a catalyst for spiritual development, religious enlightenment, and immortality, the neo-Confucianists used metaphysics as a guide for developing a rationalist [[ethics|ethical]] philosophy.&lt;ref name="huang5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CSB"&gt;{{Harvnb|Chan|2002|p=460}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:庐山白鹿洞书院周敦颐铜像.JPG|thumb|right|180px|Bronze statue of Zhou Dunyi(周敦颐) in [[White Deer Grotto Academy]](白鹿洞書院)]]
Neo-Confucianism has its origins in the [[Tang Dynasty]]; the Confucianist scholars [[Han Yu]] and [[Li Ao (philosopher)|Li Ao]] are seen as forebears of the neo-Confucianists of the Song Dynasty.&lt;ref name="huang5"&gt;{{Harvnb|Huang|1999|p=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Song Dynasty philosopher [[Zhou Dunyi]] (1017–1073) is seen as the first true "pioneer" of neo-Confucianism, using Daoist metaphysics as a framework for his ethical philosophy.&lt;ref name="CSB"/&gt; Neo-Confucianism developed both as a renaissance of traditional Confucian ideas, and as a reaction to the ideas of Buddhism and religious Daoism. Although the neo-Confucianists denounced Buddhist metaphysics, neo-Confucianism did borrow Daoist and Buddhist terminology and concepts.&lt;ref name="huang5"/&gt;

One of the most important exponents of neo-Confucianism was [[Zhu Xi]] (1130–1200). He was a rather prolific writer, maintaining and defending his Confucian beliefs of social harmony and proper personal conduct. One of his most remembered was the book ''Family Rituals'', where he provided detailed advice on how to conduct weddings, funerals, family ceremonies, and the veneration of ancestors. Buddhist thought soon attracted him, and he began to argue in Confucian style for the Buddhist observance of high moral standards. He also believed that it was important to practical affairs that one should engage in both academic and philosophical pursuits, although his writings are concentrated more on issues of theoretical (as opposed to practical) significance. It is reputed that he wrote many essays attempting to explain how his ideas were not Buddhist or Taoist, and included some heated denunciations of Buddhism and Taoism.

After the Xining era (1070), [[Wang Yangming]] (1472–1529) is commonly regarded as the most important neo-Confucian thinker. Wang's interpretation of Confucianism denied the rationalist dualism of Zhu's orthodox philosophy.

There were many competing views within the neo-Confucian community, but overall, a system emerged that resembled both Buddhist and [[Taoist]] (Daoist) thought of the time and some of the ideas expressed in the [[I Ching]] (Book of Changes) as well as other [[yin yang]] theories associated with the [[Taiji (philosophy)|Taiji]] symbol ([[Taijitu]]). A well known neo-Confucian motif is [[Vinegar tasters|paintings]] of [[Confucius]], [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], and [[Lao Tzu]] all drinking out of the same vinegar jar, paintings associated with the slogan "The three teachings are one!"

While neo-Confucianism incorporated Buddhist and Taoist ideas, many neo-Confucianists strongly opposed Buddhism and Taoism. Indeed, they rejected the Buddhist and Taoist religions. One of [[Han Yu]]'s most famous essays decries the worship of Buddhist [[relic]]s. Nonetheless, neo-Confucian writings adapted Buddhist thoughts and beliefs to the Confucian interest. In [[China]] neo-Confucianism was an officially recognized creed from its development during the Song dynasty until the early twentieth century, and lands in the sphere of Song China ([[Vietnam]] and [[Japan]]) were all deeply influenced by neo-Confucianism for more than half a millennium.

==Philosophy==
Neo-Confucianism is a social and ethical philosophy using metaphysical ideas, some borrowed from Taoism, as its framework. The philosophy can be characterized as humanistic and rationalistic, with the belief that the universe could be understood through human reason, and that it was up to humanity to create a harmonious relationship between the universe and the individual.&lt;ref name="craig"&gt;{{Harvnb|Craig|1998|p=552}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rationalism of neo-Confucianism is in contrast to the mysticism of the previously dominant [[Zen|Chan Buddhism]]. Unlike the Buddhists, the neo-Confucians believed that reality existed, and could be understood by humankind, even if the interpretations of reality were slightly different depending on the school of neo-Confucianism.&lt;ref name="craig"/&gt;

{{quote|But the spirit of Neo-Confucian rationalism is diametrically opposed to that of Buddhist mysticism. Whereas Buddhism insisted on the unreality of things, Neo-Confucianism stressed their reality. Buddhism and Taoism asserted that existence came out of, and returned to, non-existence; Neo-Confucianism regarded reality as a gradual realization of the Great Ultimate... Buddhists, and to some degree, Taoists as well, relied on meditation and insight to achieve supreme reason; the Neo-Confucianists chose to follow Reason.&lt;ref name="chan"&gt;{{Harvnb|Chan|1946|p=268}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The importance of ''li'' in Neo-Confucianism gave the movement its Chinese name, literally "The study of Li."

==Schools==
Neo-Confucianism was a heterogeneous philosophical tradition, and is generally categorized into two different schools.

===Two-school model vs. three-school model===
In medieval China, the mainstream of neo-Confucian thought, dubbed the "Tao school", had long categorized a thinker named [[Lu Jiuyuan]] among the unorthodox, non-Confucian writers. However, in the 15th century, the esteemed philosopher [[Wang Yangming]] took sides with Lu and critiqued some of the foundations of the Tao school, albeit not rejecting the school entirely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Thomas A.|title=Genealogy of the way: the construction and uses of the Confucian tradition in late imperial China|date=1995|publisher=Stanford Univ. Press|location=Stanford, Calif.|isbn=9780804724258|pages=168–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objections arose to Yangming's philosophy within his lifetime, and shortly after his death, Chen Jian (1497–1567) grouped Wang together with Lu as unorthodox writers, dividing neo-Confucianism into two schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bary|first1=Wm. Theodore de|title=The message of the mind in Neo-Confucianism|date=1989|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=0231068085|pages=94–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, neo-Confucianism today is generally categorized into two different schools of thought. The school that remained dominant throughout the medieval and early modern periods is called the [[Cheng-Zhu school]] for the esteem it places in [[Cheng Yi (philosopher)|Cheng Yi]], [[Cheng Hao]], and [[Zhu Xi]]. The less dominant, opposing school was the [[Lu–Wang school]], based on its esteem for Lu Jiuyuan and Wang Yangming.

In contrast to this two-branch model, the [[New Confucian]] [[Mou Zongsan]] argues that there existed a third branch of learning, the [[Hu-Liu school]], based on the teachings of [[Hu Hong]] (Hu Wufeng, 1106–61) and [[Liu Zongzhou]] (Liu Jishan, 1578–1645).  The significance of this third branch, according to Mou, was that they represented the direct lineage of the pioneers of neo-Confucianism, Zhou Dunyi, Zhang Zai and Cheng Hao.  Moreover, this third [[Hu-Liu school]] and the second [[Lu–Wang school]], combined, form the true mainstream of neo-Confucianism instead of the [[Cheng-Zhu school]].  The mainstream represented a return to the teachings of [[Confucius]], [[Mencius|Mengzi]], the [[Doctrine of the Mean]] and the Commentaries of the [[Book of Changes]]. The [[Cheng-Zhu school]] was therefore only a minority branch based on the [[Great Learning]] and mistakenly emphasized intellectual studies over the study of sagehood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yao|first=Xinzhong|title=An Introduction to Confucianism|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-64430-3|page=259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cheng-Zhu school===
{{main|Cheng-Zhu school}}
Zhu Xi's formulation of the neo-Confucian world view is as follows. He believed that the [[Tao]] ({{zh|c=道|p=dào|l=way}}) of [[Tian]] ({{zh|c=天|p=tiān|l=heaven}}) is expressed in principle or ''[[Li (Neo-Confucianism)|li]]'' ({{zh|c=理|p=lǐ}}), but that it is sheathed in matter or ''[[qi]]'' ({{zh|c=氣|p=qì}}).  In this, his system is based on Buddhist systems of the time that divided things into principle (again, li), and function ({{zh|c=事|p=shì}}).  In the neo-Confucian formulation, ''li'' in itself is pure and almost-perfect, but with the addition of ''qi'', base emotions and conflicts arise. Human nature is originally good, the neo-Confucians argued (following [[Mencius]]), but not pure unless action is taken to purify it.  The imperative is then to purify one's ''li''.  However, in contrast to Buddhists and Taoists, neo-Confucians did not believe in an external world unconnected with the world of matter.  In addition, neo-Confucians in general rejected the idea of reincarnation and the associated idea of [[karma]].

Different neo-Confucians had differing ideas for how to do so. Zhu Xi believed in ''gewu'' ({{zh|c=格物|p=géwù}}), the Investigation of Things, essentially an academic form of observational science, based on the idea that ''li'' lies within the world.

===Lu–Wang school===
{{main|Lu–Wang school}}
[[Wang Yangming]] (Wang Shouren), probably the second most influential neo-Confucian, came to another conclusion: namely, that if ''li'' is in all things, and ''li'' is in one's heart-mind, there is no better place to seek than within oneself.  His preferred method of doing so was ''[[jingzuo]]'' ({{zh|c=靜坐|p=jìngzuò|l=quiet sitting}}), a practice that strongly resembles [[zazen]] or [[Zen|Chan (Zen)]] [[meditation]].  Wang Yangming developed the idea of ''innate knowing'', arguing that every person knows from birth the difference between [[goodness and value theory|good]] and [[evil]]. Such knowledge is [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]] and not [[Rationality|rational]].  These revolutionizing ideas of Wang Yangming would later inspire prominent Japanese thinkers like [[Motoori Norinaga]], who argued that because of the [[Shinto]] deities, Japanese people alone had the intuitive ability to distinguish good and evil without complex rationalization.  Wang Yangming's school of thought (''Ōyōmei-gaku'' in Japanese) also provided, in part, an ideological basis for some samurai who sought to pursue action based on intuition rather than scholasticism. As such, it also provided an intellectual foundation for the radical political actions of low ranking samurai in the decades prior to the Meiji Ishin (1868), in which the Tokugawa authority (1600–1868) was overthrown.

==Neo-Confucianism in Korea==
{{Culture of Korea}}
{{further|Korean Confucianism}}
{{further|Political factions in Joseon Dynasty}}
In [[Joseon dynasty|Joseon]] Korea, neo-Confucianism was established as the state ideology. The [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] occupation of the Korean peninsula introduced [[Zhu Xi]]'s school of neo-Confucianism to Korea.&lt;ref name="columbia 53-12"&gt;Paragraph 12 in [[Emanuel Pastreich]] "The Reception of Chinese Literature in Korea", chapter 53 in Mair 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Neo-Confucianism was introduced to Korea by [[An Hyang]] during [[Goryeo dynasty]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} At the time that An Hyang introduced neo-Confucianism, the Goryeo dynasty was in the last century of its existence and influenced by the Mongol [[Yuan dynasty]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Many Korean scholars visited China during the Yuan dynasty and An Hyang was among them. In 1286, he happened to read a book of [[Zhu Xi]] in [[Beijing|Yanjing]]. He was so moved by this book that he transcribed this book in its entirety and came back to Korea with his transcribed copy.  It greatly inspired Korean intellectuals at the time and many, predominantly from the middle class and disillusioned with the excesses of organized religion (in the form of Buddhism) and the old nobility, embraced neo-Confucianism. The newly rising neo-Confucian intellectuals were leading groups aimed at the overthrow of the old (and increasingly foreign-influenced) Goryeo dynasty.

[[File:Cho Kwang-jo in 1750.jpg|150px|thumb|Portrait of Jo Gwang-jo]]
After the fall of the Goryeo dynasty and the establishment of the Joseon Dynasty by [[Yi Song-gye]] in 1392 AD, neo-Confucianism was installed as the new dynasty's state ideology. Buddhism, and organized religion in general was considered poisonous to the neo-Confucian order. Buddhism was accordingly restricted and occasionally persecuted by the new dynasty. As neo-Confucianism encouraged  education, there were a number of neo-Confucian schools (서원 ''[[seowon]]'' and  향교 ''hyanggyo'') founded throughout the country. Such schools produced many neo-Confucian scholars, including individuals such as [[Jo Gwang-jo]] (조광조, 趙光祖; 1482–1520), [[Yi Hwang]] (이황, 李滉; pen name Toegye 퇴계, 退溪; 1501–1570)
and [[Yi I]] (이이, 李珥; 1536–1584).

In the early 16th century, Jo Gwang-jo attempted to transform Joseon into the ideal neo-Confucian society with a series of radical reforms until he was executed in 1520.  Despite the failure of his attempted reforms, neo-Confucianism soon assumed an even greater role in the Joseon Dynasty. Soon Korean neo-Confucian scholars, no longer content to only read and remember the Chinese original precepts, began to  develop new neo-Confucian theories. [[Yi Hwang]] and  [[Yi I]] were the most prominent of these new theorists.
Yi Hwang's most prominent disciples were Kim Seong-il （金誠一, 1538–1593), [[Yu Seong-ryong]] (柳成龍 1542–1607）and [[Jeong Gu]]  (한강 정구, 寒岡 鄭逑, 1543—1620), known as the "three heroes".
These were followed by a second generation of scholars which included [[Jang Hyungwang]] (張顯光, 1554—1637)  
&lt;!-- 愚伏郑经世（1563—1633), 拙斋柳元之（1598—1674) --&gt;
and [[Jang Heung-Hyo]] (敬堂 張興孝, 1564—1633), and by a third generation (including [[Heo Mok]], [[Yun Hyu]], [[Yun Seon-do]], [[Song Si-yeol]]) which brought the school into the 18th century &lt;!--   갈암 이현일  (庵李玄逸, 1627—1704） and  密庵李栽（1657—1730)--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;【李甦平】 Lisu Ping, 论韩国儒学的特点和精神 "On the characteristics and spirit of Korean Confucianism", 《孔子研究》2008年1期 (''Confucius Studies'' 2008.1). 
See also [[List of Korean philosophers]].
&lt;!--from a cached version of Lisu Ping 2008:
Yi Hwang 李滉退溪（1501—1570）
identified as the founder (?) of the "mainstream" ("main reason") school “主理”学

The "three back door heroes"(?) 退门三杰。(what does this actually mean?)
forming the "first generation":
鹤峰（1538—1593）
...（1542—1607）
寒冈（1543—1620）

second generation:
轩张显光（1554—1637）、
愚伏郑经世（1563—1633）、
敬堂张兴孝（1564—1633）、
拙斋柳元之（1598—1674）、

third generation:
庵李玄逸（1627—1704）
密庵李栽（1657—1730）
--&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

But neo-Confucianism in the Joseon Dynasty became so dogmatic in a relatively rapid time that it prevented much needed socio-economic development and change, and led to internal divisions and criticism of many new theories, regardless of their popular appeal. For instance, [[Wang Yangming]]'s theories, which were popular in the Chinese [[Ming Dynasty]], were regarded as heresy and severely condemned by Korean neo-Confucianists. Furthermore, any annotations on Confucian canon which are different from Zhu Xi were excluded. During the Joseon Dynasty, the newly emerging ruling class, called ''[[Sarim]]''(사림, 士林), also became divided into political factions according to their diversity of neo-Confucian views on politics. There were two large factions and many subfactions.

During the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598)]], many Korean neo-Confucian books and scholars were taken to Japan. They influenced Japanese scholars such as [[Fujiwara Seika]] and affected the development of Japanese neo-Confucianism.

==Bureaucratic examinations==
Neo-Confucianism became the interpretation of Confucianism whose mastery was necessary to pass the [[Imperial examination|bureaucratic examinations]] by the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]], and continued in this way through the Qing dynasty until the end of the Imperial examination system in 1905.  However, many scholars such as [[Benjamin Elman]] have questioned the degree to which their role as the [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] interpretation in [[Imperial examination|state examinations]] reflects the degree to which both the [[bureaucrats]] and [[Chinese gentry]] actually believed those interpretations, and point out that there were very active schools such as [[Han learning]] which offered competing interpretations of Confucianism.

The competing school of Confucianism was called the [[Evidential School]] or [[Han Learning]] and argued that neo-Confucianism had caused the teachings of Confucianism to be hopelessly contaminated with Buddhist thinking.  This school also criticized neo-Confucianism for being overly concerned with empty philosophical speculation that was unconnected with reality.

==Confucian canon==
The Confucian canon as it exists today was essentially compiled by [[Zhu Xi]]. Zhu codified the canon of [[Four Books]] (the ''[[Great Learning]]'', the ''[[Doctrine of the Mean]]'', the ''[[Analects]]'' of Confucius, and the ''[[Mencius (book)|Mencius]]'') which in the subsequent Ming and Qing Dynasties were made the core of the official curriculum for the civil service examinations.

== New Confucianism ==

In the 1920s, [[New Confucianism]], also known as modern neo-Confucianism, started developing and absorbed the Western learning to seek a way to modernize Chinese culture based on the traditional Confucianism. It centers on four topics: The modern transformation of Chinese culture; Humanistic spirit of Chinese culture; Religious connotation in Chinese culture; Intuitive way of thinking, to go beyond the logic and to wipe out the concept of exclusion analysis. Adhering to the traditional Confucianism and the neo-confucianism, the modern neo-Confucianism contributes the nation's emerging from the predicament faced by the ancient Chinese traditional culture in the process of modernization; Furthermore, it also promotes the world culture of industrial civilization rather than the traditional personal senses.&lt;ref&gt;http://baike.baidu.com/view/2053255.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3824">[[File:Ophitediagram-matter.png|thumb|320px|right|Reconstruction from ''Histoire critique du Gnosticisme;'' Jacques Matter, 1826, Vol. III, Plate I, D.]]

The '''Ophite Diagrams''' are ritual and esoteric diagrams used by the [[Ophites|Ophite]] sect of [[Gnosticism]], who revered the serpent from the [[Garden of Eden]] as a symbol of wisdom, which the malevolent [[Demiurge]] tried to hide from [[Adam and Eve]].

[[Celsus]] and his opponent [[Origen]] (''[[Contra Celsum]],'' [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume IV/Origen/Origen Against Celsus/Book VI|vi.]] §§ [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume IV/Origen/Origen Against Celsus/Book VI/Chapter XXIV|24]]-[[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume IV/Origen/Origen Against Celsus/Book VI/Chapter XXXVIII|38]]) both describe the diagrams, though not in the same way. Celsus describes them as ten separate circles, circumscribed by one circle, the [[Anima mundi|world-soul]], [[Leviathan]], divided by a thick black line, [[Tartarus]], together with a square, with words said at the gates of [[Paradise]]. Further to this, the Ophites are said by Celsus to add the sayings of [[prophet]]s, and circles upon circles, with some things written within the two great cosmological circles representing God the Father, and God the Son.

Origen maintains that there were two concentric circles, across the diameter of which were inscribed the words ΠΑΤΗΡ ("father") and ΥΙΟC ("son"); a smaller circle hung from the larger one, with the words ΑΓΑΠΗ ("love"). A wall divides the realm of light from the middle realm. Two other concentric circles, one light and one dark, represent light and shadow. Hanging from this double circle was a circle with the inscription ΖΩΗ ("life"), and this enclosed two other circles which intersected each other and formed a rhomboid. In the common field were the words ΣΟΦΙΑC ΦΥCΙC ("the nature of wisdom"), above ΓΝΩCΙC ("knowledge"), and below ΣΟΦΙΑ ("wisdom"); in the rhomboid was ΣΟΦΙΑC ΠΡΟΝΟΙΑ ("the providence of wisdom"). There were altogether seven circles, with the names of seven [[archon (Gnosticism)|archons]]:

*[[Michael (archangel)|Michael]], in the form of a [[lion]]
*[[Sariel]], of a [[bull]]
*[[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]], of a [[dragon]]
*[[Gabriel]], of an [[eagle]]
*Thauthabaoth ("Tohu wa-Bohu"), of a [[bear]]'s head
*Erataoth, of a [[dog]]'s head
*Onoel or Thartharaoth, of an [[donkey|ass]]'s head

The archons are perhaps identical with the seven generations of [[Yaldabaoth]]. They signify the corporeal world, which follows the middle realm, and with which the dominion of [[Sophia (Gnosticism)|Sophia]] ends. The [[Sefirot]] of Jewish [[Kabbalah]] may be in some way connected with this diagram (Myer, pp. 311-13). But the serpent as symbol is found likewise in connection with the mysteries of [[Egypt]], [[Greece]], [[Phoenicia]], [[Syria]], and even [[Babylon]]ia and [[India]].

'''Owen''' and '''Mzee''' are a [[hippopotamus]] and an [[Aldabra giant tortoise]], respectively, that became the subject of media attention after forming an unusual bond of friendship. They live in [[Haller Park]], [[Bamburi]], Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= |first= |title=Odd couple make friends in Kenya |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4152447.stm |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=2005-01-01 |accessdate=2008-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owen was separated from his herd as a juvenile following the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|December 2004 tsunami]] and was brought to the Haller Park rescue center. Having no other hippos to interact with, Owen immediately attempted to bond with Mzee ([[Swahili language|Swahili]] for old man)&lt;ref&gt;http://en.bab.la/dictionary/english-swahili/elder&lt;/ref&gt;, whose large domed shell and brown color resembled an adult hippo. Mzee was reluctant about Owen at first but grew to like him and got used to Owen around him. 

The pair were featured in ''Owen and Mzee: The True Story of a Remarkable Friendship'', a 2006 book by Isabella and [[Craig Hatkoff]], as well as the 2007 sequel ''Owen and Mzee: The Language of Friendship''.

Once it was determined that Owen had grown too large to safely interact with Mzee, a separate enclosure was built for Owen and a new (female) hippo named Cleo, with whom he bonded quickly. With Owen now twice Mzee's size and well on his way to being socialized to other hippos, the famous friends went their separate ways and Mzee was returned to his regular enclosure.

'''''Philosophy Now''''' is a bimonthly philosophy magazine sold from news-stands and book stores in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada; it is also available on digital devices, and online. It aims to appeal to the wider public, as well as to students and philosophy teachers. It was established in 1991 and was the first general philosophy magazine.&lt;ref name="Philosophy Hits The Newsstands"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Glenn|first1=Joshua|title=Philosophy Hits The Newsstands|url=http://hilobrow.com/2011/10/02/philosophy-hits-the-newsstands/|website=HiLobrow|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The creation of Philosophy Now magazine|url=http://theboar.org/2014/10/21/creation-philosophy-now-magazine/|website=The Boar|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''Philosophy Now'' was established in May 1991 as a low-budget quarterly magazine by [[Rick Lewis (journalist)|Rick Lewis]]. The first issue included an article on [[free will]] by then [[atheist]] philosopher [[Antony Flew]], who remained an occasional contributor for many years.&lt;ref name="Philosophy Hits The Newsstands"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Philosophy Now Issue 1|url=https://philosophynow.org/issues/1|work=Philosophy Now|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine was initially published in Lewis' home town of [[Ipswich]] (England). Peter Rickman soon became one of the most regular contributors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosophynow.org/issues/102/Peter_Rickman_1918-2014 Obituary Peter Rickman, 1918–2014], ''Philosophy Now'', issue 2014. Retrieved 3 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, a group of American philosophers including Raymond Pfeiffer and Charles Echelbarger lobbied the [[American Philosophical Association]] to start a similar magazine in the United States.&lt;ref name="PhilosophyGoesPublic"&gt;{{cite web|author=Pfeiffer Raymond|title=Philosophy Goes Public |url=http://www.delta.edu/rspfeiff/|website=The Internet Archive |accessdate=21 April 2015|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070617175219/http://www.delta.edu/rspfeiff/ |archivedate=17 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The then APA executive director Eric Hoffman arranged a meeting in [[Philadelphia]] in 1997, to which Lewis was invited.&lt;ref name=PhilosophyGoesPublic /&gt; At the meeting, it was decided that the American group should join forces with Lewis to further develop ''Philosophy Now''. Since that time, the magazine has been produced jointly by two editorial boards, in the UK and US.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Philosophy Now About|url=https://philosophynow.org/about|website=Philosophy Now|publisher=Philosophy Now|accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine is distributed in the US by the [[Philosophy Documentation Center]].

In 2000 ''Philosophy Now'' increased its frequency to appear bimonthly. Lewis is now the Editor in Chief, while Grant Bartley is Editor of the print edition and Bora Dogan edits the digital editions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosophynow.org/issues/100/A_Century_Not_Out We’re celebrating our hundredth issue by launching our very own app for iPad and iPhone], ''Philosophy Now''. Retrieved 29 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Philosophy Now'' won the [[Bertrand Russell Society]] Award for 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bertrandrussell.org/brs-award-recipients/ Bertrand Russell Society Award Recipients]. Retrieved 20 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
The magazine contains articles on most areas of philosophy. Most are written by academics, though some are by postgraduate students or by independent writers. Although it aims at a non-specialist audience, ''Philosophy Now'' has frequently attracted articles by well-known thinkers.

''Philosophy Now'' also regularly features book reviews, interviews, fiction, a film column, cartoons, and readers' letters. Its regular columnists include [[Raymond Tallis]] (''Tallis in Wonderland'') and [[Peter Adamson (academic)|Peter Adamson]] (''Philosophy Then''). For some years there was a philosophical agony-aunt column called ''Dear Socrates'', allegedly written by a [[reincarnation]] of the [[Athenian]] sage. The magazine's contents are discussed in an online discussion forum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.philosophynow.org ''Philosophy Now'' Discussion Forum]. Retrieved 29 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scoops and controversies==
The philosophy Professor [[Antony Flew]], noted for his arguments in favour of atheism, published a letter in ''Philosophy Now'''s August/September 2004 issue in which he first indicated that his position regarding God's existence had changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Letter from Antony Flew {{!}} Philosophy Now|url=https://philosophynow.org/issues/47/Letter_from_Antony_Flew_on_Darwinism_and_Theology|website= ''philosophynow.org''|accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The news of Flew's change-of-mind was carried in many newspapers worldwide, most of them referencing Flew's Philosophy Now letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=There is a God, leading atheist concludes|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/6688917/ns/world_news/t/there-god-leading-atheist-concludes/|publisher=NBC News|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Laura Smith|title=Atheist finds 'God' after 50 years|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/dec/11/religion.artsandhumanities|work=The Guardian|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''Philosophy Now'' interview with the Canadian philosopher [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] in 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Interview with Charles Taylor {{!}} Philosophy Now|url=https://philosophynow.org/issues/74/Charles_Taylor|website=''philosophynow.org''|accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; created controversy in Canadian newspapers because of Taylor's dismissive remarks about an atheist poster campaign on buses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charles Taylor Prize for Humourlessness|url=http://ottawacitizen.com/opinion/charles-taylor-prize-for-humourlessness/|website=Ottawa Citizen|accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Defending Atheist Bus Ads|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/holy-post/justin-trottier-and-michael-payton-defending-atheist-bus-ads/|work=National Post|accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pinchas Polonsky''' ({{lang-ru|Полонский Петр (Пинхас) Ефимович}}, born 1958) is a Russian-Israeli Jewish-religious philosopher, researcher, and educator active among the Russian-speaking Jewish community. He has written original books and a number of translations of works on Judaism.

During his underground activities in Moscow (1977–1987), he taught Judaism and was one of the founders of [[Machanaim]]. He lives in [[Israel]], is an activist in the process of the modernization of [[Judaism]] and is a researcher on the topics of the late [[Abraham Isaac Kook|Rav Kook]]. Polonsky is the author of a commentary on the [[Torah]] under the title "Biblical Dynamics". Polonsky is the head of the Russian department of the Brit Olam Noahide World Center in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://noahideworldcenter.org/wp_en/the-team/ Brit Olam Noahide World Center in Jerusalem]&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr. Polonsky initiated EJWiki, an academic encyclopedia on Jewish and Israeli topics.

==Biography==

Born 1958 in Moscow into a family of [[secular]] [[Jewish assimilation|assimilated Jews]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;«Восемнадцать», составитель З. Вагнер, издательство «Шамир», Иерусалим, 1989, с. 202—217 {{ISBN|965-293-010-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; he attended Special Math School No. 7 with a focus on math and physics. Upon graduating in 1975 a decision to leave the [[Soviet Union]] and move to Israel took shape. He began to study [[Hebrew]] in a clandestine group, and then subsequently [[Torah]] and Judaism.

Between 1975 and 1980 Polonsky studied mathematics at the [[Moscow State Pedagogical University|Moscow State Pedagogical Institute]].

Starting in 1979 Polonsky became one of the founders of a clandestine network for the study of Torah in Moscow.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; He was involved in [[Samizdat]], publishing (through photocopying) guides for observing Judaism and maintaining a Jewish lifestyle, including a series of books on Jewish holiday observance and Torah commentaries.

After applying for immigration to Israel, Polonsky became a [[Refusenik (Soviet Union)|refusenik]] for 7 years and finally [[Aliyah|immigrated]] to [[Israel]] in 1987 at the onset of the [[Perestroika]]. He has been living in [[Beit El]] since 1991.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

==Education and academic work==

1987: one of the initiators in the founding of the Israeli branch of [[Machanaim]]; remained a faculty member and editor-in-chief until 2012.

1989–1990: attended [[Yeshiva]] "[[The Harry Fischel Institute for Talmudic Research]]" in [[Jerusalem]].

1994–1997: attended Yeshiva Beit Morasha, Jerusalem, majoring in Jewish philosophy.

1995–1999: attended [[Bar-Ilan University]] in [[Ramat Gan]], faculty of Jewish studies; received an MA in [[Talmud|Talmudic Studies]].

In 2002 Polonsky obtained a PhD in [[Sociology of religion|Sociology of Religion]]. His thesis was: "Sociological Concepts in R. Kook's Teachings".

1991–2012: taught at the Bar-Ilan University.

2012-2013: Senior Fellow and Assistant Professor at [[Ariel University]], [[Samaria]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.7kanal.co.il/News/News.aspx/170145 Интервью c П. Полонским в связи с выходом перевода на иврит его книги по философии рава Кука]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chief of the Russian Department at Brit Olam, a yeshiva for [[Noahidism|Bnei Noah]], headed by R. [[Oury Amos Cherki|Uri Sherki]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://noahideworldcenter.org/wp_ru/sotrudniki/ Сотрудники «Международного центра потомков Ноаха»]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Series of prayer books with commentaries==

This initiative launched by Pinchas Polonsky began with an underground edition of the [[Passover|Pesach]] [[Haggadah]] with commentaries in the 1980s in Moscow. The Haggadah was published using photocopying equipment and distributed in hundreds of copies across Moscow and other major cities of the former Soviet Union. This Hagadah was meant to instruct in leading an exciting and spiritual [[Passover Seder|Seder]].&lt;ref&gt;«[[Machanaim]]». [http://machanaim.org/holidays/in_pes.htm Песах]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Israel Polonsky together with Machanaim published: a [[Siddur]] (prayer book) with a Russian translation and commentaries titled "Vrata Molitvy"&lt;ref&gt;[http://machanaim-2.org/sidur/index_1.htm Сидур с транслитерацией]&lt;/ref&gt; (Gates of Prayer, not to be confused with the [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] "Gates of Prayer, the New Union Prayer Book"). Until this day it remains the most widely used prayer book in Russian; a transliterated edition is also available); [[Machzor]] "Gates of Repentance" for [[Rosh Hashanah]] and [[Yom Kippur]]; Passover Haggadah with commentaries; a book titled "Obligations of the Living", on the [[Bereavement in Judaism|Laws of Mourning]], as well as a series of books about Jewish holiday customs and observance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://machanaim.org/books/ Книги издательства «Маханаим»]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research of Rav Kook's legacy==

In 1991 Polonsky partnered with [[Abraham Isaac Kook|Rav Kook's]] Home Residence Museum in Jerusalem and prepared the publishing of a compilation of Rav Kook's works titled "Tolerance in the Teaching of R. Kook".

During the course of his research of Rav Kook's philosophy and body of work, he wrote and published a study (monograph) titled "Rav Abraham Isaac Kook. Life and Teaching". In 2009 the main chapters of the book were translated and published in English,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejewisheye.com/pp_ravkook.html Religious Zionism of Rav Kook. By Pinchas Polonsky. Translated from Russian by Lise Brody.] Reviewed by Israel Drazin&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2013 into [[Hebrew]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://orot-yerushalaim.org/rav_kook.html ספר «התפתחות היהדות בימינו על פי תורת הראי»ה קוק" מאת פ.פולונסקי]&lt;/ref&gt; It became the first book on Jewish religious thought translated from Russian to Hebrew. The book was approved by several major rabbinical authorities on the subject of Rav Kook's [[philosophy]] and was recommended by them to be included in the [[Religious Zionism|Religious Zionist]] academic curriculum.

==Torah commentaries "The Biblical Dynamics"==

A series of books presenting a new commentary to the Torah, based on the [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] concepts of [[Léon Ashkenazi|R. I. L. Ashkenazi]] (Manitou) and on new findings of R. [[Oury Amos Cherki|Uri Sherki]], which included the author's own original concepts and interpretations.

By 2014 six volumes were published: Commentaries to the two first books of the [[Hebrew Bible|Bible]] - [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] and [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejwiki.org/wiki/%C2%AB%D0%9F%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BE%D1%82%D1%86%D1%8B_%D0%B2_%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B5%C2%BB_(%D0%BA%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B3%D0%B0) «Праотцы в динамике» — серия книг комментария к Торе П. Полонского]&lt;/ref&gt; A full commentary on the Torah is expected to appear soon. An English translation is planned.

==Other works==

In 2009 Polonsky - among others - became one of the founders of an Academic wiki-encyclopedia on Jewish and Israeli topics. The goal of the project is the publication of a complementary (to Wikipedia and other sources), academically viable information on Judaism, Jews and Israel on the Russian-language Internet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ruformator.ru/blog/43174879977/Evrei-zapustili-sobstvennuyu-%C2%ABVikipediyu%C2%BB Евреи запустили собственную «Википедию»]&lt;/ref&gt;

Polonsky is the initiator and coordinator for the project "Preserving the Memory", whose purpose is to preserve the memory of the Jewish-Zionist underground movement in the USSR. He is also the founder of the "Fight Against [[Antisemitism#Cultural antisemitism|Intellectual Antisemitism]]" project.&lt;ref&gt;''П. Полонский.'' [http://ejwiki.org/wiki/Pinchas.Polonsky#.D0.9F.D1.80.D0.BE.D0.B5.D0.BA.D1.82.D1.8B Проекты]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious views and philosophy==

Pinchas Polonsky attributes himself to the radically modernist wing of religious Zionism, whose essence is the orthodox modernization of Judaism; in other words, an active modernization with strict adherence to an orthodox Jewish approach.&lt;ref&gt;''П. Полонский.'' [http://www.jewish.ru/columnists/2012/05/news994307818.php А что ты сказал Б-гу?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203140003/http://www.jewish.ru/columnists/2012/05/news994307818.php |date=2015-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this he sees himself as a follower of Rav Kook and a partner to R. Uri Sherki.

Polonsky supports an integration of universal ideas into religion creating a healthy [[symbiosis]]. He views modernization of religion as an absolute religious necessity and prerequisite.&lt;ref&gt;''П. Полонский.'' [http://www.machanaim.org/philosof/kook/rrr-kook.htm#p1 Не только религиозный сионизм, но и глобальное обновление иудаизма]&lt;/ref&gt; He believes in the religious importance of science, art, democracy, and other universal secular values. Polonsky is a proponent of the initiative to introduce "a day of science" in Israeli high-school curricula, to demonstrate productive [[synergy]] which can be achieved by combining [[science]] and [[religion]].

Polonsky is active in promoting ideas and concepts of [[Noahidism]].{{cn|date=November 2017}}

Polonsky is an advocate for access to and prayer at the [[Temple Mount]] for Jews.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

Polonsky is the author of the concept of "Three Stages of the Arrival of the [[Messiah#Judaism|Messiah]]" (as opposed to the two-stage approach, widely accepted by religious Zionism today).{{cn|date=November 2017}}

He introduced the concept of religious anti-fundamentalism; in other words, an opposition to religious [[fundamentalism]] based on the concepts of "continuing and organic [[revelation]]".{{cn|date=November 2017}}

{{gnosticism}}
In [[Manichaeism|Manichaean cosmology]], the ''world of darkness'', which invated the ''world of light'' in a lustfull desire to mingle with the light, is ruled by five evil [[Archon (Gnosticism)|Archons]] ([[demon]], [[dragon]], [[eagle]], [[fish]] and [[lion]]), who together make up the '''Prince of Darkness'''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Willis Barnstone, ''Marvin Meyer The Gnostic Bible: Revised and Expanded Edition'' Shambhala Publications 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-834-82414-0}} page 575-577&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Father of greatness]] parries the assault by evoking a number of entities, who sacrifice themselves and are absorbed by the Prince of Darkness, however, tricked by the Father of Greatness, their existence now depents on the light they absorbed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; To prevent the light particles from returning into their divine origin, they counter by giving birth to two demonic beings: [[Demiurge|Sakla and Nebroel]]. As the strict [[anti-thesis]] of the pure light, the Prince of Darkness can not create [[ex nihilo]], but only by copulation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Polytheism and Dualism ==
[[Augustine of Hippo]], who converted from Manichaeism to [[Christianity]], criticised the Manichaeans of [[polytheism]] and [[paganism]], stating that Manichaeans would believe in two different [[Deity|deities]]. [[Faustus of Mileve]] defens Manichaeism by stating, that [[Catholicism|Catholics]] erroneously assume that the Prince of Darkness had a divine essence, while in fact, the Prince of Darkness does not share any attributes with the Divine.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes van Oort ''Augustine and Manichaean Christianity: Selected Papers from the First South African Conference on Augustine of Hippo, University of Pretoria, 24-26 April 2012'' BRILL 2013 {{ISBN|9789004255067}} p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; They are both two different principles, although eternally existing, clearly distinct. Only the light particles within humans are consubstantial to the Divine.

== Alternative names ==
Manichaean missionaries adjusted to name of the Prince of Darkness, depending on the audience. Towards [[Christian]]s, they commonly used the name ''[[Satan|Satanas]]''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Peter J. Awn ''Satan's Tragedy and Redemption: Iblis in Sufi Psychology'' BRILL 1983 {{ISBN|9789004069060}}&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to [[Islam]], the expression [[Iblis|Iblis Al-Qadim]] (''the primordial Iblis'') can be found.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; In [[Zoroastrianism|Iranian]] Manichaeism, he was called [[Ahriman]].&lt;ref&gt;Yuri Stoyanov ''The Other God: Dualist Religions from Antiquity to the Cathar Heresy'' Yale University Press 2000 9780300082531 p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Raksha''' ({{IAST|rakshā}}, {{IAST|rakshas}}, {{IAST|rakshah}}). Raksha and its various derivatives which occur predominantly in the [[Vedas]] and their many auxiliary texts means – to protect, guard, take care of, tend, rule, govern, to keep, not to divulge, to preserve, save, keep away from, spare, to avoid, to observe or to beware of, an evil spirit, a demon, an imp and is the root of numerous words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary|author=V.S.Apte|publisher=The Digital Libraries of South Asia|page=1322|url= http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/contextualize.pl?p.4.apte.2839823 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Vedas it refers to the evil tendencies that continuously afflict humanity.

In Sukta 104 of the VII Mandala of the [[Rig Veda]] in the 22nd mantra addressed to Indra beginning – इन्द्रासोमा तपतं रक्ष उब्जतं न्यर्पयतं वृषणा तमोवृधः, Rishi Vasishthahmaitravaruni states:-

:उलूकयातुं शुशुलूकयातुं जहि श्वयातुमुत कोकयातुम |
:सुपर्णयातुमुत गृध्रयातुं दृषदेव प्र मृण रक्ष इन्द्र || २२ ||

which mantra has been translated by T.H.Griffith in the following manner to mean destroy :-

:"Destroy the fiend shaped like an owl or owlet; destroy him in the form of a dog or cuckoo." 
:"Destroy him shaped as an eagle or as a vulture as with a stone, O Indra, crush the demon."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rig Veda|page=293|url= http://www.sanskritweb.net/rigveda/griffith.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

But, in fact, in this mantra, Rishi Vasishthahmaitravaruni refers to the ''Rakshas'' (रक्षस्) as groups of evil  tendencies ([[vritti]]), having base animal qualities stemming from the rajas and tamas (gunas), modes of being: viz. 1) ''ulookavritti'',  owl tendency, attachment, 2) ''shushlookavritti'', wolf tendency , anger, 3) ''shvavritti'', dog tendency, envy, 4) ''kokavritti'', goose tendency, lustfulness, 5) ''suparnavritti'', kite tendency, ego, and 6) ''grddhavritti'', vulture tendency, greediness.  Taking the cue, in the very first ''[[Sukta]]''- prayer intended to root out the evil tendencies of the wicked, unsympathetic and uncharitable exploiters of humanity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Yajurveda Chapter I.7| url= https://archive.org/stream/yajurveda029670mbp/yajurveda029670mbp_djvu.txt }}&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Yajurveda]] [[mantra]] I.7 reads :-

:प्र्त्युष्टं रक्षः प्र्त्युष्टा अरातयो निष्टप्तं रक्षो निष्टप्ता अरातयः |
:उर्वन्तरिक्षमन्वेमि ||

:"The Rakshah group of Rakshas is burnt to ashes, aratayo, reduced to ashes, the former is fired out and the latter too," 
:"I am keeping the vast antariksha."

''Rati'' means ''gati'' which means motion, movement and advancement; ''Aratayo'' means ''agati'' or inactivity, slothfulness and inertness. When evil tendencies are destroyed, inactivity disappears and capability to do worthy acts is instilled, misfortune is washed away, then, a person's actions lead him/her to the gain of wealth, and the feeling of benevolence comes to the fore. The worshipper by praying – "''I am keeping the vast antariksha''" -- seeks to become united with all the capabilities to act (and) thus united he becomes filled up with feelings of benevolence. Heating up of the ''Rakshas'' indicates one becoming pure and sanctified whereas the ''Aratis'' are meant to be heated up by the fire of true awakening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Exposition of the Vedas 1964 Edition|author=Swami Vidyanand Videh|publisher=The Veda Samsthana, Ajmer|page=23|url= http://www.worldcat.org/title/exposition-of-the-vedas/oclc/45897479/editions?referer=di&amp;editionsView=true }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rudolph Goclenius the Elder''' ({{lang-la|Rudolphus Goclenius}}; born ''Rudolf Gockel'' or ''Göckel''; 1 March 1547 – 8 June 1628) was a German scholastic philosopher who lived from March 1, 1547 to June 8, 1628. Gockel is often credited with coining the term "[[psychology]]" in 1590, but the term was used by [[Marko Marulić]] at least 66 years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Krstic/marulic.htm|title=Classics in the History of Psychology -- Krstic (1964)|website=psychclassics.yorku.ca|access-date=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gockel also had extensive backing and significant contributions to the field of [[ontology]]. He extended on many ideas from [[Aristotle]], such as both the introduction of ontology and metaphysics. Several of Gockel’s ideas were published and built upon by later philosophers.

==Life==
He was born in [[Korbach]], [[Waldeck (state)|Waldeck]] (now in [[Waldeck-Frankenberg]], [[Hesse]]).

He attended the universities at the [[University of Erfurt]], the [[University of Marburg]] and the [[University of Wittenberg]], where he finished his studies with a M.A. in 1571. In the following years he directed the [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasiums]] in his hometown Korbach and in [[Kassel]]. In 1581, [[Landgraf]] [[William IV, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel|Wilhelm IV of Hesse-Kassel]], who was a reputed astronomer, refused his wish to return to Korbach, but allowed him to be appointed professor at the [[Philipps University of Marburg]], where he had the chairs of philosophy, logic, metaphysics and ethics. He served as a counsellor to Wilhelm and his son Moritz. The latter sent him 1618 to the [[Synod of Dort]].

Although he dubbed the name of "[[psychology]]," his major contribution was to the field of [[Ontology]]. As a follower of [[Aristotle's]] work, Glöckel gave the philosophy a name and continued in [[Aristotle's]] way of thinking. The philosophical discipline of [[Ontology]] is thought to be developed in the 17th century by Glöckel.&lt;ref&gt;Enskat, R.  "Ontology." Religion Past and Present. Brill Online, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Glöckel died in [[Marburg]] in June 1628.

==Family==
His oldest son, [[Rudolph Goclenius the Younger]], or Rudolf Goclenius, Jr. was professor in Marburg, and a celebrated mathematician. It is after Rudolph Goclenius, Jr., that the lunar crater is named. He also worked on cures against the plague. He became famous for his miraculous cure with the "weapon salve" or [[Powder of Sympathy]].

==Philosophical work==
From his dispute with [[Wilhelm Adolph Scribonius]] of Marburg on the legality of the [[Trial by ordeal#Ordeal by water|ordeal by water]] in [[witch trial]]s, one can deduce that Goclenius was convinced on the existence of [[witchcraft]] and adhered to the [[Malleus Maleficarum|"Hexenhammer"]].

His views reflected those of [[Aristotle]]. His philosophies belonged to a group called “[[Semiramists]],” which was a group of [[Aristotelians]] who believed in advocating dialectic interpretation of Aristotle’s learning, but also advocating the exposition of [[averroism]].&lt;ref&gt;Krstic, K. “The Author of the Term “Psychology”. Classics in the History of Psychology. 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
He was highly literate and wrote articles on many subjects, not only philosophy but also mathematics, geography, astrology (or astronomy), botanic, zoology, medicine. In his ''Lexicon philosophicum'' (1613) he used the term  ''[[ontology]]'' coined by [[Jacob Lorhard]] in his ''Ogdooas Scholastica'' (1606).

Goclenius’ major contributions also included publications which led to the term “[[psychology]].” His [[Lexicon Philosophicum]], published in 1590, is the first printed book to contain the word “[[psychology]].”

Goclenius' crowning achievement is his original contribution made to [[term logic]], called the Goclenian [[Polysyllogism|Sorites]]. In the words of the British logician [[Carveth Read]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is the shining merit of Goclenius to have restored the Premises of the Sorites to the usual order of Fig. I.: whereby he has raised to himself a monument more durable than brass, and secured indeed the very cheapest immortality.  How expensive, compared with this, was the method of the Ephesian incendiary!"&lt;ref&gt;C. Read, M.A., Logic, Deductive and Inductive, (Grant Richards, London: 1898), p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1590, this German scholastic philosopher is often attributed for the initial use of the term "psychology" in his writing. "Psycologia hoc est de hominis perfectione, anima, ortu." This was a Latin dissertation that translates to English as, "Psychology, that is, on the perfection arising from the soul of man.&lt;ref&gt;DeCastro, D.  “Psychogenesis of Psychology.” General Psychology. 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Evolution of Physics: The Growth of Ideas from Early Concepts to Relativity and Quanta''''' is a science book for the lay reader, by [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Leopold Infeld]], tracing the development of ideas in physics. It was originally published in 1938 by [[Cambridge University Press]]. It was a popular success,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/?id=r9C-SCXymPoC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=%22The+Evolution+of+Physics%22+einstein |title=Physics Before and After Einstein |first=Marco Mamone |last=Capria |publisher=IOS Press |year=2005 |isbn=978-1-58603-462-7 |pages=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was featured in a [[Time (magazine)|Time magazine]] cover story.

==Background of collaboration==
Einstein agreed to write the book partly as a way to help Infeld financially.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/?id=U2mO4nUunuwC&amp;pg=PA495&amp;dq=%22The+Evolution+of+Physics%22+einstein |title=Subtle Is the Lord: The Science and the Life of Albert Einstein |year=2005 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=495 |isbn= 978-0-19-280672-7 |author=Abraham Pais, Roger Penrose }}&lt;/ref&gt; Infeld collaborated briefly in Cambridge with [[Max Born]], before moving to Princeton, where he worked with Einstein at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]]. Einstein tried to get Infeld a permanent position there, but failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= |title=Who Got Einstein's Office?: Eccentricity And Genius At The Institute For Advanced Study
  |first=Ed |last=Regis |year=1988 |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=978-0-201-12278-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Infeld came up with a plan to write a history of physics with Einstein, which was sure to be successful, and split the royalties. When he went to Einstein to pitch the idea, Infeld became incredibly tongue-tied, but he was finally able to stammer out his proposal. “This is not at all a stupid idea,” Einstein said. "Not stupid at all. We shall do it." The book was published by Simon &amp; Schuster.

==Book's point of view==
In the book,  Albert Einstein pushed his realist approach to physics in defiance of much of quantum mechanics. Belief in an “objective reality,” the book argued, had led to great scientific advances throughout the ages, thus proving that it was a useful concept even if not provable. “Without the belief that it is possible to grasp reality with our theoretical constructions, without the belief in the inner harmony of our world, there could be no science,” the book declared. “This belief is and always will remain the fundamental motive for all scientific creation.”

In addition, Einstein used the text to defend the utility of field theories amid the advances of quantum mechanics. The best way to do that was to view particles not as independent objects but as a special manifestation of the field itself: "Could we not reject the concept of matter and build a pure field physics? We could regard matter as the regions in space where the field is extremely strong. A thrown stone is, from this point of view, a changing field in which the states of the greatest field intensity travel through space with the velocity of the stone."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Einstein: His Life and Universe |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7432-6473-0
|first= Walter |last=Isaacson |url=https://books.google.com/?id=dJMpQagbz_gC&amp;pg=PA463&amp;dq=The+Evolution+of+Physics+einstein |pages=463–464 |publisher=Simon and Schuster }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
The book has four chapters: ''The Rise of The Mechanical View''; ''The Decline of the Mechanical View''; ''Field, Relativity''; and ''Quanta''.

The third chapter (''Field, Relativity'') examines [[lines of force]] starting with gravitational fields (i.e., a physical collection of forces), moving on to descriptions of electric and magnetic fields.  The authors explain that they are attempting to "translate familiar facts from the language of fluids...into the new language of fields."  They state that the [[Michael Faraday|Faraday]], [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]], and [[Heinrich Hertz|Hertz]] experiments led to modern [[physics]]. They describe how "The change of an electric field produced by the motion of a charge is always accompanied by a magnetic field."

'''Victor Cousin''' ({{IPA-fr|kuzɛ̃|lang}}; 28 November 1792{{snd}}14 January 1867) was a French [[philosopher]].  He was the founder of "[[Eclectic philosophy|eclecticism]]", a briefly influential school of French philosophy that combined elements of [[German idealism]] and Scottish [[Common Sense Realism]]. As the administrator of public instruction for over a decade, Cousin also had an important influence on French educational policy.

==Biography==

===Early years===

The son of a watchmaker, he was born in [[Paris]], in the Quartier Saint-Antoine. At the age of ten he was sent to the local [[grammar school]], the [[Lycée Charlemagne]], where he studied until he was eighteen. ''Lycées'' being organically linked to the University of France and its Faculties since their Napoleonic institution (the ''baccalauréat'' was awarded by juries made of university professors)  Cousin was "crowned" in the ancient hall of the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] for a [[Latin]] oration he wrote which  owned him a first prize at the ''concours général'', a competition between the best pupils at ''lycées'' (established under the Ancien Régime and reinstated under the First Empire, and still extant). The classical training of the lycée strongly disposed him to literature, or ''éloquence'' as it was then called. He was already known among his fellow students for his knowledge of [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]. From the lycée he graduated to the most prestigious of higher education schools, [[École Normale Supérieure]] (as it is now called), where [[Pierre Laromiguière]] was then lecturing on philosophy. In the second preface to the ''Fragments philosophiques'', in which he candidly states the varied philosophical influences of his life, Cousin speaks of the grateful emotion excited by the memory of the day when he heard Laromiguière for the first time. "That day decided my whole life." Laromiguière taught the philosophy of [[John Locke]] and [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac]], happily modified on some points, with a clearness and grace which in appearance at least removed difficulties, and with a charm of spiritual bonhomie which penetrated and subdued."{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=330}} That school has remained ever since the living heart of French philosophy; [[Henri Bergson]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Jacques Derrida]] are among its past students.

===Early influence on Cousin's philosophical thought===

Cousin wanted to lecture on philosophy and quickly obtained the position of master of conferences (''maître de conférences'') in the school. The second great philosophical impulse of his life was the teaching  of [[Pierre Paul Royer-Collard]]. This teacher, he tells us, "by the severity of his logic, the gravity and weight of his words, turned me by degrees, and not without resistance, from the beaten path of Condillac into the way which has since become so easy, but which was then painful and unfrequented, that of the Scottish philosophy."{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=330}} The "Scottish Philosophy" being the "Common Sense" Philosophy of [[Thomas Reid]] and others{{mdash}}which taught that both the external world and the human mind (introspection proving the existence of "free will" by the fact of consciousness) had an objective existence.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} In 1815–1816 Cousin attained the position of ''suppliant'' (assistant) to Royer-Collard in the history of modern philosophy chair of the faculty of letters.  Another thinker who influenced him at this early period was [[Maine de Biran]], whom Cousin regarded as the unequalled psychological observer of his time in France.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=330}}

These men strongly influenced Cousin's philosophical thought. To Laromiguière he attributes the lesson of decomposing thought, even though the reduction of it to sensation was inadequate. Royer-Collard taught him that even sensation is subject to certain internal laws and principles which it does not itself explain, which are superior to analysis and the natural patrimony of the mind. De Biran made a special study of the phenomena of the will. He taught him to distinguish in all cognitions, and especially in the simplest facts of consciousness, the voluntary activity in which our personality is truly revealed. It was through this "triple discipline" that Cousin's philosophical thought was first developed, and that in 1815 he began the public teaching of philosophy in the Normal School and in the faculty of letters.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=330}}

He then took up the study of [[German language|German]], worked at [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi]], and sought to master the ''Philosophy of Nature'' of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]], which at first greatly attracted him. The influence of Schelling may be observed very markedly in the earlier form of his philosophy. He sympathized with the principle of faith of Jacobi, but regarded it as arbitrary so long as it was not recognized as grounded in reason. In 1817 he went to [[Germany]], and met [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] at [[Heidelberg University|Heidelberg]].  Hegel's ''Encyclopädie der philosophischen Wissenschaften'' appeared the same year, and Cousin had one of the earliest copies. He thought Hegel not particularly amiable, but the two became friends. The following year Cousin went to Munich, where he met Schelling for the first time, and spent a month with him and Jacobi, obtaining a deeper insight into the Philosophy of Nature.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=330}}

===Political troubles disrupt career===

France's political troubles interfered for a time with his career. In the events of 1814–1815 he took the royalist side. He adopted the views of the party known as doctrinaire, of which Royer-Collard was the philosophical leader. He seems to have gone further, and to have approached the extreme Left. Then came a reaction against liberalism, and in 1821–1822 Cousin was deprived of his offices in the faculty of letters and in the Normal School. The Normal School was swept away, and Cousin shared the fate of [[Guizot]], who was ejected from the chair of history. This enforced abandonment of public teaching was a mixed blessing: he set out for Germany with a view to further philosophical study. While at [[Berlin]] in 1824–1825 he was thrown into prison, either on some ill-defined political charge at the instance of the French police, or as a result of an indiscreet conversation. Freed after six months, he remained under the suspicion of the French government for three years.  It was during this period that he developed what is distinctive in his philosophical doctrine. His eclecticism, his [[ontology]] and his philosophy of history were declared in principle and in most of their salient details in the ''Fragments philosophiques'' (Paris, 1826). The preface to the second edition (1833) and the third (1838) aimed at a vindication of his principles against contemporary criticism. Even the best of his later books, the ''Philosophie écossaise'', the ''Du vrai, du beau, et du bien'', and the ''Philosophie de Locke'', were simply matured revisions of his lectures during the period from 1815 to 1820. The lectures on Locke were first sketched in 1819, and fully developed in the course of 1829.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=330}}

During the seven years when he was prevented from teaching, he produced, besides the ''Fragments'', the edition of the works of [[Proclus]] (6 vols., 1820-1827), and the works of [[René Descartes]] (II vols., 1826). He also commenced his ''Translation of Plato'' (13 vols.), which occupied his leisure time from 1825 to 1840. One sees in the ''Fragments'' very distinctly the fusion of the different philosophical influences by which his opinions were finally matured. For Cousin was as eclectic in thought and habit of mind as he was in philosophical principle and system. It is with the publication of the ''Fragments'' of 1826 that the first great widening of his reputation is associated. In 1827 followed the ''Cours de l'histoire de la philosophie''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=330-331}}

===Reinstatement at the University ===

In 1828, de Vatimesnil, minister of public instruction in [[Jean Baptiste Sylvere Gay, Vicomte de Martignac|Martignac]]'s ministry, recalled Cousin and Guizot to their professorial positions in the university. The three years which followed were the period of Cousin's greatest triumph as a lecturer. His return to the chair was the symbol of the triumph of constitutional ideas and was greeted with enthusiasm. The hall of the Sorbonne was crowded as the hall of no philosophical teacher in Paris had been since the days of [[Pierre Abélard]]. The lecturer's eloquence mingled with speculative exposition, and he possessed a singular power of rhetorical climax. His philosophy showed strikingly the generalizing tendency of the French intellect, and its logical need of grouping details round central principles.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=331}}

There was a moral elevation in Cousin's [[Spiritualism (philosophy)|spiritual philosophy]] which touched the hearts of his listeners, and seemed to be the basis for higher development in national literature and art, and even in politics, than the traditional philosophy of France. His lectures produced more ardent disciples than those of any other contemporary professor of philosophy. Judged on his teaching influence, Cousin occupies a foremost place in the rank of professors of philosophy, who like Jacobi, Schelling and [[Dugald Stewart]] have united the gifts of speculative, expository and imaginative power. The taste for philosophy—especially its history—was revived in France to an extent unknown since the 17th century.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=331}}

===Influence on others===
Among those influenced by Cousin were [[Théodore Simon Jouffroy]], [[Jean Philibert Damiron]], [[Adolphe Garnier]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Jules Barthélemy Saint-Hilaire]], [[Felix Ravaisson-Mollien]], [[Charles de Rémusat]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Jules Simon]], [[Paul Janet]], [[Adolphe Franck]] and [[Patrick Edward Dove]], who dedicated his "The Theory of Human Progression" to him—Jouffroy and Damiron were first fellow-followers. students and then disciples. Jouffroy always kept firm to the early—the French and Scottish—impulses of Cousin's teaching. Cousin continued to lecture for two and a half years after his return to the chair. Sympathizing with the revolution of July, he was at once recognized by the new government as a friend of national liberty. Writing in June 1833 he explains both his philosophical and his political position:
"I had the advantage of holding united against me for many years both the sensational and the [[theology|theological]] school. In 1830 both schools descended into the arena of politics. The sensational school quite naturally produced the demagogic party, and the theological school became quite as naturally absolutism, safe to borrow from time to time the mask of the demagogue in order the better to reach its ends, as in philosophy it is by scepticism that it undertakes to restore theocracy. On the other hand, he who combated any exclusive principle in science was bound to reject also any exclusive principle in the state, and to defend representative government."{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=331}}

===Effect on primary instruction===
The government was not slow to honour him. He was induced by the ministry of which his friend [[François Guizot]] was the head to become a member of the council of public instruction and counsellor of state, and in 1832 he was made a [[Peerage of France|Peer of France]]. He ceased to lecture, but retained the title of professor of philosophy. Finally, he accepted the position of minister of public instruction in 1840 under [[Adolphe Thiers]]. He was besides director of the Normal School and virtual head of the university, and from 1840 a member of the [[Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques|Academy of the Moral and Political Sciences]] in the [[Institut de France]]. His character and his official position at this period gave him great power in the university and in the educational arrangements of the country.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=331}}

The most important work he accomplished during this period was the organization of primary instruction. It was to the efforts of Cousin that France owed her advance, in relation to primary education, between 1830 and 1848. [[Prussia]] primary and [[Saxony]] had set the national example, and France was guided into it by Cousin. Forgetful of national calamity and of personal wrong, he looked to Prussia as affording the best example of an organized system of national education; and he was persuaded that "to carry back the education of Prussia into France afforded a nobler (if a bloodless) triumph than the trophies of [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] and [[Battle of Jena-Auerstedt|Jena]]." In the summer of 1831, commissioned by the government, he visited Frankfurt and Saxony, and spent some time in Berlin. The result was a series of reports to the minister, afterwards published as ''Rapport sur l'Etat de l'instruction publique dans quelques pays de l'Allemagne et particulièrement en Prusse'' (Compare also ''De l'instruction publique en Hollande'', 1837) His views were readily accepted on his return to France, and soon afterwards through his influence there was passed the law of primary instruction. (See his ''Exposé des motifs et projet de loi sur l'instruction primaire, présentés à la chambre des députés'', ''séance du 2 janvier 1837''.){{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=331}}

In the words of the ''[[Edinburgh Review]]'' (July 1833), these documents "mark an epoch in the progress of national education, and are directly conducive to results important not only to France but to Europe." The Report was translated into English by Mrs Sarah Austin in 1834. The translation was frequently reprinted in the [[United States|United States of America]]. The legislatures of [[New Jersey]] and [[Massachusetts]] distributed it in the schools at the expense of the states. Cousin remarks that, among all the literary distinctions which he had received, "None has touched me more than the title of foreign member of the American Institute for Education." To the enlightened views of the ministries of Guizot and Thiers under the citizen-king, and to the zeal and ability of Cousin in the work of organization, France owes what is best in her system of primary education,{{mdash}}a national interest which had been neglected under the [[French Revolution]], the Empire and the Restoration (see Exposé, p.&amp;nbsp;17). In the first two years of the reign of Louis Philippe more was done for the education of the people than had been either sought or accomplished in all the history of France. In defence of university studies he stood manfully forth in the chamber of peers in 1844, against the clerical party on the one hand and the levelling or Philistine party on the other. His speeches on this occasion were published in a tractate ''Défense de l'université et de la philosophie'' (1844 and 1845).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=331}}

===Writing period 1830 to 1848===

This period of official life from 1830 to 1848 was spent, so far as philosophical study was concerned, in revising his former lectures and writings, in maturing them for publication or reissue, and in research into certain periods of the sophical history of philosophy. In 1835 appeared ''De la Métaphysique d'Aristote, suivi d'un essai de traduction du premier et du douzième livres''; in 1836, ''Cours de philosophie professé à la faculté des lettres pendant l'année 1818'', and ''Œuvres inédites d'Abélard''. This ''Cours de philosophie'' appeared later in 1854 as ''Du vrai, du beau, et du bien''. From 1825 to 1840 appeared ''Cours de l'histoire de la philosophie'', in 1829 ''Manuel de l'histoire de la philosophie de Tennemann'', translated from the German. In 1840–1841 we have ''Cours d'histoire de la philosophie morale au XVIII&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; siècle'' (5 vols.). In 1841 appeared his edition of the ''Œuvres philosophiques de Maine-de-Biran''; in 1842, ''Leçons de philosophie sur Kant'' (Eng. trans. AG Henderson, 1854), and in the same year ''Des Pensées de Pascal''. The ''Nouveaux fragments'' were gathered together and republished in 1847. Later, in 1859, appeared ''Petri Abaelardi Opera''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=331}}

Also during this period Cousin seems to have turned with fresh interest to those literary studies which he had abandoned for speculation under the influence of Laromiguière and Royer-Collard. To this renewed interest we owe his studies of men and women of note in France in the 17th century. As the results of his work in this line, we have, besides the ''Des Pensées de Pascal'', 1842, Audes sur les femmes et la société du XVII siècle 1853. He has sketched [[Jacqueline Pascal]] (1844), [[Anne Genevieve of Bourbon-Condé|Madame de Longueville]] (1853), the [[Madeleine de Souvré, marquise de Sablé|marquise de Sable]] (1854), the [[duchesse de Chevreuse]] (1856), [[Madame de Hautefort]] (1856).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=331-332}} Cousin was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1855.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter C|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterC.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the reign of [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis Philippe]] came to a close through the opposition of his ministry, with Guizot at its head, to the demand for electoral reform and through the policy of the Spanish marriages, Cousin, who was opposed to the government on these points, lent his sympathy to Cavaignac and the Provisional government. He published a pamphlet entitled ''Justice et charité'', the purport of which showed the moderation of his political views. It was markedly anti-socialistic. But from this period he passed almost entirely from public life, and ceased to wield the personal influence which he had done during the preceding years. After the ''[[coup d'état]]'' of 2 December, he was deprived of his position as permanent member of the superior council of public instruction. From Napoleon and the Empire he stood aloof. A decree of 1852 placed him along with Guizot and Villemain in the rank of honorary professors. His sympathies were apparently with the monarchy, under certain constitutional safeguards. Speaking in 1853 of the political issues of the spiritual philosophy which he had taught during his lifetime, he says: "It conducts human societies to the true republic, that dream of all generous souls, which in our time can be realized in Europe only by constitutional monarchy."{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=332}}

===Death===

During the last years of his life he occupied a suite of rooms in the Sorbonne, where he lived simply and unostentatiously. The chief feature of the rooms was his noble library, the cherished collection of a lifetime. He died in [[Cannes]] on 14 January 1867, in his seventy-fifth year. In the front of the Sorbonne, below the lecture rooms of the faculty of letters, a tablet records an extract from his will, in which he bequeaths his noble and cherished library to the halls of his professorial work and triumphs.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=332}}

==Philosophy==

===Three distinctive points===

There are three distinctive points in Cousin's philosophy. These are his method, the results of his method, and the application of the method and its results to history, especially to the history of philosophy. It is usual to speak of his philosophy as eclecticism. It is eclectic only in a secondary and subordinate sense. All eclecticism that is not self-condemned and inoperative implies a system of doctrine as its basis, in fact, a criterion of truth. Otherwise, as Cousin himself remarks, it is simply a blind and useless [[syncretism]]. And Cousin saw and proclaimed from an early period in his philosophical teaching the necessity of a system on which to base his eclecticism. This is indeed advanced as an illustration or confirmation of the truth of his system, as a proof that the facts of history correspond to his analysis of consciousness. These three points, the method, the results, and the philosophy of history, are with him intimately connected. They are developments in a natural order of sequence. They become in practice [[Epistemology|Psychology]], [[Ontology]] and [[Eclecticism]] in history.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=332}}

Cousin strongly insisted on the importance of method in philosophy. That which he adopts is the ordinary one of observation, analysis and induction. This observational method Cousin regards as that of the 18th century, the method which Descartes began and abandoned, and which Locke and Condillac applied, though imperfectly, and which [[Thomas Reid]] and Kant used with more success. He insists that this is the true method of philosophy as applied to consciousness, in which alone the facts of experience appear. But the proper condition of the application of the method is that it shall not, through prejudice of system, omit a single fact of consciousness. If the authority of consciousness is good in one instance, it is good in all. If not to be trusted in one, it is not to be trusted in any. Previous systems have erred in not presenting the facts of consciousness.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=332}}

===Observational method===

The observational method applied to consciousness gives us the science of psychology. This is the basis and the only proper basis of ontology or metaphysics, the science of being, and of the philosophy of history. To the observation of consciousness Cousin adds induction as the complement of his method, by which he means inference as to reality necessitated by the data of consciousness, and regulated by certain laws found in consciousness, those of reason. By his method of observation and induction as thus explained, his philosophy will be found to be marked off very clearly, on the one hand from the deductive construction of notions of an absolute system, as represented either by Schelling or Hegel, which Cousin regards as based simply on hypothesis and abstraction, illegitimately obtained; and on the other, from that of Kant, and in a sense, of Sir W. Hamilton, both of which in the view of Cousin are limited to psychology, and merely relative or phenomenal knowledge, and issue in scepticism so far as the great realities of ontology are concerned. What Cousin finds psychologically in the individual consciousness, he finds also spontaneously expressed in the common sense or universal experience of humanity. In fact, it is with him the function of philosophy to classify and explain universal convictions and beliefs; but common-sense is not with him philosophy, nor is it the instrument of philosophy; it is simply the material on which the philosophical method works, and in harmony with which its results must ultimately be found.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=332}}

===Three results of psychological observation ===

The three great results of psychological observation are Sensibility, Activity or Liberty, and Reason.  These three facts are different in character, but are not found apart in consciousness. Sensations, or the facts of the sensibility, are necessary. The facts of reason are also necessary, and reason is no less independent of the will than the sensibility. Voluntary facts alone have the characters of imputability and personality. The will alone is the person or Me. The me is the centre of the intellectual sphere without which consciousness is impossible. We find ourselves in a strange world, between two orders of phenomena which do not belong to us, which we apprehend only on the condition of our distinguishing ourselves from them. Further, we apprehend by means of a light which does not come from ourselves. All light comes from the reason, and it is the reason which apprehends both itself and the sensibility which envelops it, and the will which it obliges but does not constrain. Consciousness, then, is composed of these three integrant and inseparable elements. But Reason is the immediate ground of knowledge and of consciousness itself.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=332}}

But there is a peculiarity in Cousin's doctrine of activity or freedom, and in his doctrine of reason, which enters deeply into his system. This is the element of spontaneity in volition and in reason. This is the heart of what is new alike in his doctrine of knowledge and being. Liberty or freedom is a generic term which means a [[Causality|cause]] or being endowed with self-activity. This is to itself and its own development its own ultimate cause. Free-will is so, although it is preceded by deliberation and determination, i.e. reflection, for we are always conscious that even after determination we are free to will or not to will. But there is a primary kind of volition which has not reflection for its condition, which is yet free and spontaneous. We must have willed thus spontaneously first, otherwise we could not know, before our reflective volition, that we could will and act. Spontaneous volition is free as reflective, but it is the prior act of the two. This view of liberty of will is the only one in accordance with the facts of humanity; it excludes reflective volition, and explains the enthusiasm of the poet and the artist in the act of creation; it explains also the ordinary actions of mankind, which are done as a rule spontaneously and not after reflective deliberation.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=332}}

===Doctrine of the reason===

But it is in his doctrine of the Reason that the distinctive principle of the philosophy of Cousin lies. The reason given to us by psychological observation, the reason of our consciousness, is impersonal in its nature. We do not make it; its character is precisely the opposite of individuality; it is universal and necessary. The recognition of universal and necessary principles in knowledge is the essential point in psychology; it ought to be put first and emphasized to the last that these exist and that they are wholly impersonal or absolute. The number of these principles, their enumeration and classification, is an important point, but it is secondary to that of the recognition of their true nature. This was the point which Kant missed in his analysis, and this is the fundamental truth which Cousin thinks he has restored to the integrity of philosophy by the method of the observation of consciousness. And how is this impersonality or absoluteness of the conditions of knowledge to be established ? The answer is in substance that Kant went wrong in putting necessity first as the criterion of those laws. This brought them within the sphere of reflection, and gave as their guarantee the impossibility of thinking them reversed; and led to their being regarded as wholly relative to human intelligence, restricted to the sphere of the phenomenal, incapable of revealing to us substantial reality—necessary, yet subjective. But this test of necessity is a wholly secondary one; these laws are not thus guaranteed to us; they are each and all given to us, given to our consciousness, in an act of spontaneous apperception or' apprehension, immediately, instantaneously, in a sphere above the reflective consciousness, yet within the reach of knowledge. And " all subjectivity with all reflection expires in the spontaneity of apperception. The reason becomes subjective by relation to the voluntary and free self; but in itself it is impersonal; it belongs not to this or to that self inhumanity; it belongs not even to humanity. We may say with truth that nature and humanity belong to it, for without its laws both would perish."{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=332-333}}

But what is the number of those laws? Kant reviewing the enterprise of Aristotle in modern times has given a complete list of the laws of thought, but it is arbitrary in classification and may be legitimately reduced. According to Cousin, there are but two primary laws of thought, that of [[causality]] and that of [[Substance theory|substance]]. From these flow naturally all the others. In the order of nature, that of substance is the first and causality second. In the order of acquisition of our knowledge, causality precedes substance, or rather both are given us in each other, and are contemporaneous in consciousness.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=333}}

These principles of reason, cause and substance, given thus psychologically, enable us to pass beyond the limits of the relative and subjective to objective and absolute reality, they enable us, in a word, to pass from [[epistemology|psychology]], or the science of knowledge, to ontology or the science of being. These laws are inextricably mixed in consciousness with the data of volition and sensation, with free activity and fatal action or impression, and they guide us in rising to a personal being, a self or free cause, and to an impersonal reality, a not-me—nature, the world of force—lying out of us, and modifying us. As I refer to myself the act of attention and volition, so I cannot but refer the sensation to some cause, necessarily other than myself, that is, to an external cause, whose existence is as certain for me as my own existence, since the phenomenon which suggests it to me is as certain as the phenomenon which had suggested my reality, and both are given in each other. I thus reach an objective impersonal world of forces which corresponds to the variety of my sensations. The relation of these forces or causes to each other is the order of the universe.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=333}}

But these two forces, the me and the not-me, are reciprocally limitative. As reason has apprehended these two simultaneous phenomena, attention and sensation, and led us immediately to conceive the two sorts of distinct absolute, causes, correlative and reciprocally finite, to which they are related, so, from the notion of this limitation, we find it impossible under the same guide not to conceive a supreme cause, absolute and infinite, itself the first and last cause of all. This is relatively to self and not-self what these are to their proper effects. This cause is self-sufficient, and is sufficient for the reason. This is God; he must be conceived under the notion of cause, related to humanity and the world. He is absolute substance only insofar as he is absolute cause, of philosophy and his essence lies precisely in his creative power. He thus creates, and he creates necessarily.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=333}}

This theodicy of Cousin laid him open obviously enough to the charge of pantheism. This he repels, and his answer may be summed up as follows. Pantheism is properly the deification of the law of phenomena, the universe [[God]]. But I distinguish the two finite causes self and not-self from each other and from the infinite cause. They are not mere modifications of this cause or properties, as with Spinoza,{{mdash}}they are free forces having" their power or spring of action in themselves, and this is sufficient for our idea of independent finite reality. I hold this, and I hold the relation of these as effects to the one supreme cause. The God I plead for is neither the deity of [[Pantheism]], nor the absolute unity of the [[Eleatics]], a being divorced from all possibility of creation or plurality, a mere metaphysical abstraction. The deity I maintain is creative, and necessarily creative. The deity of [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] and the Eleatics is a mere substance, not a cause in any sense. As to the necessity under which Deity exists of acting or creating, this is the highest form of liberty, it is the freedom of spontaneity, activity without deliberation. His action is not the result of a struggle between passion and virtue. He is free in an unlimited manner the purest spontaneity in man is but the shadow of the freedom of God. He acts freely but not arbitrarily, and with the consciousness of being able to choose the opposite part. He cannot deliberate or will as we do. His spontaneous action excludes at once the efforts and the miseries of will and the mechanical operation of necessity.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=333}}

The elements found in consciousness are also to be found in the history of humanity and in the history of philosophy. In external nature there are expansion and contraction which correspond to spontaneity and reflection. External nature again in contrast with humanity expresses spontaneity; humanity expresses reflection. In human history the East represents the spontaneous stage; the Pagan and Christian world represent stages of reflection. This was afterwards modified, expanded and more fully expressed by saying that humanity in its universal development has three principal moments. First, in the spontaneous stage, where reflection is not yet developed, and art is imperfect, humanity has thought only of the immensity around it. It is preoccupied by the infinite. Secondly, in the reflective stage, mind has become an object to itself. It thus knows itself explicitly or reflectively. Its own individuality is now the only or at least the supreme thing. This is the moment of the finite. Thirdly, there comes an epoch in which the self or me is subordinated. Mind realizes another power in the universe. The finite and the infinite become two real correlatives in the relation of cause and product. This is the third and highest stage of development, the relation of the finite and the infinite. As philosophy is but the highest expression of humanity, these three moments will be represented in its history. The East typifies the infinite, Greece the finite or reflective epoch, the modern era the stage of relation or correlation of infinite and finite. In theology, the dominant philosophical idea of each of these epochs results in pantheism, polytheism, theism. In politics we have a correspondence also with the ideas of monarchy, democracy, and constitutional polity.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=333}}

Eclecticism thus means the application of the psychological method to the history of philosophy. Confronting the various systems co-ordinated as sensualism, idealism, skepticism, mysticism, with the facts of consciousness, the chasm result was reached " that each system expresses an order of phenomena and ideas, which is in truth very real, but which is not alone in consciousness, and which at the same time holds an almost exclusive place in the system; whence it follows that each system is not false but incomplete, and that in re-uniting all incomplete systems, we should have a complete philosophy, adequate to the totality of consciousness." Philosophy, as thus perfected, would not be a mere aggregation of systems, as is ignorantly supposed, but an integration of the truth in each system after the false or incomplete is discarded.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=333}}

===Comparison to Kant, Schelling and Hegel===

Such is the system in outline. The historical position of the system lies in its relations to Kant, Schelling and Hegel. Cousin was opposed to Kant in asserting that the unconditioned in the form of infinite or absolute cause is but a mere unrealizable tentative or effort on the part of and something different from a mere negation, yet not equivalent to a positive thought. With Cousin the absolute as the ground of being is grasped positively by the intelligence, and it renders all else intelligible; it is not as with Kant a certain hypothetical or regulative need.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=334}}

With Schelling again Cousin agrees in regarding this supreme ground of all as positively apprehended, and as a source of development, but he utterly repudiates Schelling's method. The intellectual intuition either falls under the eye of consciousness, or it does not. If not, how do you know it and its object which are identical? If it does, it comes within the sphere of psychology; and the objections to it as thus a relative, made by Schelling himself, are to be dealt with. Schelling's intellectual intuition is the mere negation of knowledge.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=334}}

Again the pure being of Hegel is a mere abstraction, a hypothesis illegitimately assumed, which he has nowhere sought to vindicate. The very point to be established is the possibility of reaching being per se or pure being; yet in the Hegelian system this is the very thing assumed as a starting-point. Besides this, of course, objections might be made to the method of development, as not only subverting the principle of contradiction, but as galvanizing negation into a means of advancing or developing the whole body of human knowledge and reality. The intellectual intuition of Schelling, as above consciousness, the pure being of Hegel, as an empty abstraction, unvindicated, illegitimately assumed, and arbitrarily'developed, are equally useless as bases of metaphysics. This led Cousin, still holding by essential knowledge of being, to ground it in an analysis of consciousness, in psychology.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=334}}

===The absolute or infinite===

The absolute or infinite{{mdash}}the unconditioned ground and source of all reality{{mdash}}is yet apprehended by us as an immediate datum or reality; and it is apprehended in consciousness{{mdash}}under its condition, that, to wit, of distinguishing subject and object, knower and known. The doctrine of Cousin was criticized by [[William Hamilton (metaphysician)|Sir W Hamilton]] in the Edinburgh Review of 1829, and it was animadverted upon about the same time by Schelling. Hamilton's objections are as follows. The correlation of the ideas of infinite and finite does not necessarily imply their correality, as Cousin supposes; on the contrary, it is a presumption that finite is simply positive and infinite negative of the same—that the finite and infinite are simply contradictory relatives. Of these " the positive alone is real, the negative is only an abstraction of the other, and in the highest generality even an abstraction of thought itself." A study of the few sentences under this head might have obviated the trifling criticism of Hamilton's objection which has been set afloat recently, that the denial of a knowledge of the absolute or infinite implies a foregone knowledge of it. How can you deny the reality of that which you do not know? The answer to this is that in the case of contradictory statements—A and not A—the latter is a mere negation of the former, and posits nothing; and the negation of a notion with positive attributes, as the finite, does not extend beyond abolishing the given attributes as an object of thought. The infinite or non-finite is not necessarily known, ere the finite is negated, or in order to negate it; all that needs be known is the finite itself; and the contradictory negation of it implies no positive. Non-organized may or may not correspond to a positive—i.e. an object or notion with qualities contradictory of the organized; but the mere sublation of the organized does not posit it, or suppose that it is known beforehand, or that anything exists corresponding to it. This is one among many flaws in the Hegelian dialectic, and it paralyzes the whole of the [[Logic]]. Secondly, the conditions of intelligence, which Cousin allows, necessarily exclude the possibility of knowledge of the absolute—they are held to be incompatible with its unity. Here Schelling and Hamilton argue that Cousin's absolute is a mere relative. Thirdly, it is objected that in order to deduce the conditioned, Cousin makes his absolute a relative; for he makes it an absolute cause, i.e. a cause existing absolutely under relation. As such it is necessarily inferior to the sum total of its effects, and dependent for reality on these—in a word, a mere potence or becoming. Further, as a theory of creation, it makes creation a necessity, and destroys the notion of the divine. Cousin made no reply to Hamilton's criticism beyond alleging that Hamilton's doctrine necessarily restricted human knowledge and certainty to psychology and logic, and destroyed metaphysics by introducing nescience and uncertainty into its highest sphere, theodicy.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=334}}

The attempt to render the laws of reason or thought impersonal by professing to find them in the sphere of spontaneous apperception, and above reflective necessity, is unsuccessful. Cause, substance, time, space, are given us as realized in a particular form. In no single act of affirmation of cause or substance, much less in such a primitive act, do we affirm the universality of their application. There may be particular instances or cases of these laws, but we could never get the laws themselves in their universality, far less absolute impersonality. No amount of individual instances of the application of any of them by us would give it a true universality. The only sure test we have of their universality in our experience is the test of their reflective necessity. We thus after all fall back on reflection as our ground for their universal application; mere spontaneity of apprehension is futile; their universality is grounded in their necessity, not their necessity in their universality. How far and in what sense this ground of necessity renders them personal are of course questions still to be solved.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=334}}

But if these three correlative facts are immediately given, it seems to be thought possible by Cousin to vindicate them in reflective consciousness. He seeks to trace the steps which the reason has spontaneously and consciously, but irreflectively, followed. And here the question arises—Can we vindicate in a reflective or mediate process this spontaneous apprehension of reality?{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=334}}

===The self ===
The self is found to be a cause of force, free in its action, on the ground that we are obliged to relate the volition of consciousness to the self as its cause, and its ultimate cause. It is not clear from the analysis whether the self is immediately observed as an acting or originating cause, or whether reflection working on the principle of causality is compelled to infer its existence and character. If self is actually so given, we do not need the principle of causality to infer it; if it is not so given, causality could never give us either the notion or the fact of self as a cause or force, far less as an ultimate one. All that it could do would be to warrant a cause of some sort, but not this or that reality as the cause. And further, the principle of causality, if fairly carried out, as universal and necessary, would not allow us to stop at personality or will as the ultimate cause of its effect—volition. Once applied to the facts at all, it would drive us beyond the first antecedent or term of antecedents of volition to a still further cause or ground—in fact, land us in an infinite regress of causes.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=334}}

The same criticism is even more emphatically applicable to the influence of a not-self, or world of forces, corresponding to our sensations, and the cause of them. Starting from sensation as our basis, causality could never give us this, even though it be allowed that sensation is impersonal to the extent of being independent of our volition. Causality might tell us that a cause there is of sensation somewhere and of some sort; but that this cause is a force or sum of forces, existing in space, independently of us, and corresponding to our sensations, it could never tell us, for the simple reason that such a notion is not supposed to exist in our consciousness. Causality cannot add to the number of our notions, and cannot add to the number of realities we know. All it can do is to necessitate us to think that a cause there is of a given change, but what that cause is it cannot of itself inform us, or even suggest to us, beyond implying that it must be to the effect. Sensation might arise, for aught we know, so far as causality leads us, not from a world of forces at all, but from a will like our own, though infinitely more powerful, acting upon us, partly furthering and partly thwarting us. And indeed such a supposition is, with the principle of causality at work, within the limits of probability, as we are already supposed to know such a reality—a will—in our own consciousness. When Cousin thus set himself to vindicate those points by reflection, he gave up the obvious advantage of his other position that the realities in question are given us in immediate and spontaneous apprehension. The same criticism applies equally to the inference of an absolute cause from the two limited forces which he names self and not-self. Immediate spontaneous apperception may seize this supreme reality; but to vindicate it by reflection as an inference on the principle of causality is impossible. This is a mere paralogism; we can never infer either absolute or infinite from relative or finite.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=334-335}}

The truth is that Cousin's doctrine of the spontaneous apperception of impersonal truth amounts to little more than a presentment in philosophical language of the ordinary convictions and beliefs of mankind. This is important as a preliminary stage, but philosophy properly begins when it attempts to coordinate or systematize those convictions in harmony, to conciliate apparent contradiction and opposition, as between the correlative notions of finite and infinite, the apparently conflicting notions of personality and infinitude, self and not-self; in a word, to reconcile the various sides of consciousness with each other. And whether the laws of our reason are the laws of all intelligence and being—whether and how we are to relate our fundamental, intellectual and moral conceptions to what is beyond our experience, or to an infinite being—are problems which Cousin cannot be regarded as having solved. These are in truth the outstanding problems of modern philosophy.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=335}}

Cousin's doctrine of spontaneity in volition can hardly be said to be more successful than his impersonality of the reason through Volition  spontaneous apperception. Sudden, unpremeditated volition may be the earliest and the most artistic, but it is not the best. Volition is essentially a free choice between alternatives, and that is best which is most deliberate, because it is most rational. Aristotle touched this point in his distinction between $oi~X~-ns and srpoatpecric. The sudden and unpremeditated wish represented by the former is wholly inferior in character to the free choice of the latter, guided and illumined by intelligence. In this we can deliberately resolve upon what is in our power; in that we are subject to the vain impulse of wishing the impossible. Spontaneity is pleasing, sometimes beautiful, but it is not in this instance the highest quality of the thing to be obtained. That is to be found in a guiding and illumining reflective activity.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=335}}

Eclecticism is not open to the superficial objection of proceeding without a system or test in determining the complete or incomplete. But it is open to objection, assuming that a particular analysis of consciousness has reached all the possible elements in humanity and in history, and all their combinations. It may be asked, Can history have that which is not in the individual consciousness? In a sense not; but our analysis may not give all that is there, and we ought not at once to impose that analysis or any formula on history. History is as likely to reveal to us in the first place true and original elements, and combinations of elements in man, as a study of consciousness. Besides, the tendency of applying a formula of this sort to history is to assume that the elements are developed in a certain regular or necessary order, whereas this may not at all be the case; but we may find at any epoch the whole mixed, either crossing or co-operative, as in the consciousness of the individual himself. Further, the question as to how these elements may possibly have grown up in the general consciousness of mankind is assumed to be nonexistent or impossible.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=335}}

It was the tendency of the philosophy of Cousin to outline things and to fill up the details in an artistic and imaginative interest. He was observational and generalizing rather than analytic and discriminating. His search into principles was not profound, and his power of rigorous consecutive development was limited. He left no distinctive permanent principle of philosophy, but he left very interesting psychological analyses, and several new, just, and true expositions of philosophical systems, especially that of Locke and the philosophers of Scotland. He was at the same time a man of impressive power, of rare and wide culture, and of lofty aim, far above priestly conception and Philistine narrowness. He was familiar with the broad lines of most systems of philosophy. His eclecticism was proof of a reverential sympathy with the struggles of human thought to attain to certainty in the highest problems of speculation. It was a doctrine of comprehension and toleration, forming a marked and valuable contrast to the arrogance of absolutism, to the dogmatism of sensationalism, and to the doctrine of church authority, preached by the theological school of his day. His spirit saved the youth of France from these other influences. As an educational reformer and a man of learning, who greatly influenced others, Cousin stands out among the memorable Frenchmen of the 19th century.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=335}}

Sir W. Hamilton (''Discussions'', p.&amp;nbsp;541), one of his most resolute opponents, described Cousin as "A profound and original thinker, a lucid and eloquent writer, a scholar equally at home in ancient and in modern learning, a philosopher superior to all prejudices of age or country, party or profession, and whose lofty eclecticism, seeking truth under every form of opinion, traces its unity even through the most hostile systems."{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=335}}

==Biography==
Vladimir Igorevich Arnold was born on 12 June 1937 in [[Odessa]], [[Soviet Union]]. His father was Igor Vladimirovich Arnold (1900–1948), a mathematician. His mother was Nina Alexandrovna Arnold (1909–1986, ''[[Name at birth|née]]'' Isakovich), an art historian.&lt;ref name=obituary&gt;[[Sabir Gusein-Zade|Gusein-Zade, S. M.]]; Varchenko, A. N. . "[http://www.ems-ph.org/journals/newsletter/pdf/2010-12-78.pdf Obituary: Vladimir Arnold (12 June 1937–3 June 2010)]", ''Newsletter of the European Mathematical Society'', Issue 78 (December 2010), pp. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; When Arnold was thirteen, an uncle who was an engineer told him about [[calculus]] and how it could be used to understand some physical phenomena, this contributed to spark his interest for mathematics, and he started to study by himself the mathematical books his father had left to him, which included some works of [[Leonhard Euler]] and [[Charles Hermite]].&lt;ref&gt;Табачников, С. Л. . "Интервью с В.И.Арнольдом", ''[[Kvant (magazine)|Квант]]'', 1990, Nº 7, pp. 2–7. (''in Russian'')&lt;/ref&gt;

While a student of [[Andrey Kolmogorov]] at [[Moscow State University]] and still a teenager, Arnold showed in 1957 that any continuous function of several variables can be constructed with a finite number of two-variable functions, thereby solving [[Hilbert's thirteenth problem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Robertz|title=Formal Algorithmic Elimination for PDEs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0kvPBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA192|date=13 October 2014|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-11445-3|page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the [[Kolmogorov–Arnold representation theorem]].

After graduating from Moscow State University in 1959, he worked there until 1986 (a professor since 1965), and then at [[Steklov Mathematical Institute]].

He became an academician of the [[Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union]] ([[Russian Academy of Science]] since 1991) in 1990.&lt;ref name="GRE"&gt;[[Great Russian Encyclopedia]] (2005), [[Moscow]]: Bol'shaya Rossiyskaya Enciklopediya Publisher, vol. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Arnold can be said to have initiated the theory of [[symplectic topology]] as a distinct discipline. The [[Arnold conjecture]] on the number of fixed points of [[Hamiltonian symplectomorphism]]s and [[Lagrangian intersection]]s were also a major motivation in the development of [[Floer homology]].

In 1999 he suffered a serious bike accident in Paris, resulting in [[traumatic brain injury]], and though he regained consciousness after a few weeks, he had amnesia and for some time could not even recognize his own wife at the hospital,&lt;ref&gt;Arnold: Yesterday and Long Ago (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; but he went on to make a good recovery.&lt;ref&gt;Polterovich and Scherbak (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Arnold worked at the Steklov Mathematical Institute in [[Moscow]] and at [[Paris Dauphine University]] up until his death. {{As of|2006}} he was reported to have the highest [[citation index]] among Russian scientists,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientific.ru/whoiswho/gt1000_6.html List of Russian Scientists with High Citation Index]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[h-index]] of 40.

To his students and colleagues Arnold was known also for his sense of humour. For example, once at his seminar in Moscow, at the beginning of the school year, when he usually was formulating new problems, he said:
{{quote|“There is a general principle that a stupid man can ask such questions to which one hundred wise men would not be able to answer. In accordance with this principle I shall formulate some problems.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/science-obituaries/7886200/Vladimir-Arnold.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Vladimir Arnold | date=12 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a telegram to Arnold's family, [[Russian President]] [[Dmitry Medvedev]] stated:

{{quote|“The death of Vladimir Arnold, one of the greatest mathematicians of our time, is an irretrievable loss for world science. It is difficult to overestimate the contribution made by academician Arnold to modern mathematics and the prestige of Russian science.

Teaching had a special place in Vladimir Arnold's life and he had great influence as an enlightened mentor who taught several generations of talented scientists.

The memory of Vladimir Arnold will forever remain in the hearts of his colleagues, friends and students, as well as everyone who knew and admired this brilliant man.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://eng.kremlin.ru/news/437#sel=3:1,5:29|title=Condolences to the family of Vladimir Arnold|date=15 June 2010|publisher=[[Presidential Press and Information Office]]|accessdate=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Popular mathematical writings==
Arnold is well known for his lucid writing style, combining mathematical rigour with physical intuition, and an easy conversational style of teaching and education. His writings present a fresh, often [[geometric]] approach to traditional mathematical topics like [[ordinary differential equation]]s, and his many textbooks have proved influential in the development of new areas of mathematics. The standard criticism about Arnold's pedagogy is that his books "are beautiful treatments of their subjects that are appreciated by experts, but too many details are omitted for students to learn the mathematics required to prove the statements that he so effortlessly justifies." His defense is that his books are meant to teach the subject to "those who truly wish to understand it" (Chicone, 2007).&lt;ref&gt;Carmen Chicone (2007), Book review of "Ordinary Differential Equations", by Vladimir I. Arnold. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 2006. ''SIAM Review'' '''49'''(2):335–336. ''(Chicone mentions the criticism but does not agree with it.)''&lt;/ref&gt;

Arnold was an outspoken critic of the trend towards high levels of abstraction in mathematics during the middle of the last century. He had very strong opinions on how this approach—which was most popularly implemented by the [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]] school in France—initially had a negative impact on French [[mathematical education]], and then later on that of other countries as well.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://pauli.uni-muenster.de/~munsteg/arnold.html] and other essays in [http://www.pdmi.ras.ru/~arnsem/Arnold/].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="interview1"&gt;[http://www.ams.org/notices/199704/arnold.pdf An Interview with Vladimir Arnol'd], by S. H. Lui, ''[[AMS Notices]]'', 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Arnold was very interested in the history of mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1007.0688v1.pdf Oleg Karpenkov. "Vladimir Igorevich Arnold"]&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview,&lt;ref name="interview1" /&gt; he said he had learned much of what he knew about mathematics through the study of [[Felix Klein]]'s book ''Development of Mathematics in the 19th Century'' —a book he often recommended to his students.&lt;ref&gt;[[Boris Khesin|B. Khesin]] and [[Sergei Tabachnikov|S. Tabachnikov]], Tribute to Vladimir Arnold, ''Notices of the AMS'', '''59''':3 (2012) 378–399.&lt;/ref&gt; He liked to study the classics, most notably the works of [[Christiaan Huygens|Huygens]], [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Goryunov|first1=V.|last2=Zakalyukin|first2=V.|title=Vladimir I. Arnold|journal=[[Moscow Mathematical Journal]]|volume=11|issue=3|url=http://www.ams.org/distribution/mmj/vol11-3-2011/vladimir-arnold.html|year=2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and many times he reported to have found in their works ideas that had not been explored yet.&lt;ref&gt;See for example: Arnold, V. I.; Vasilev, V. A. (1989), "Newton's Principia read 300 years later" and  Arnold, V. I. (2006); "Forgotten and neglected theories of Poincaré".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
{{Expand section|date=February 2015}}
{{see also|Hilbert's thirteenth problem|Arnold conjecture|Stability of the Solar System}}
Arnold worked on [[dynamical systems theory]], [[catastrophe theory]], [[topology]], [[algebraic geometry]], [[symplectic geometry]], [[differential equations]], [[classical mechanics]], [[hydrodynamics]] and [[singularity theory]].&lt;ref name="MacTutor" /&gt;
&lt;!--
=== Hilbert's thirteenth problem ===
//--&gt;

=== Dynamical systems ===
{{see also|Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser theorem|Arnold diffusion}}
[[Jürgen Moser|Moser]] and Arnold expanded the ideas of [[Andrey Kolmogorov|Kolmogorov]] (who was inspired by questions of [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]]) and gave rise to what is now known as [[Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser theorem]] (or "KAM theory"), which concerns the persistence of some quasi-periodic motions (nearly integrable Hamiltonian systems) when they are perturbed. KAM theory shows that, despite the perturbations, such systems can be stable over an infinite period of time, and specifies what the conditions for this are.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Poincare's Prize: The Hundred-Year Quest to Solve One of Math's Greatest Puzzles|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=iEBOce-4S2EC&amp;pg=PT39|publisher = Penguin|date = 2008-07-29|isbn = 9781440634284|first = George G.|last = Szpiro | authorlink= George Szpiro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Singularity theory===
In 1965, Arnold attended [[René Thom]]'s seminar on [[catastrophe theory]]. He later said of it: "I am deeply indebted to Thom, whose singularity seminar at the [[Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques|Institut des Hautes Etudes Scientifiques]], which I frequented throughout the year 1965, profoundly changed my mathematical universe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.math.upenn.edu/Arnold/Arnold-interview1997.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714123033/https://www.math.upenn.edu/Arnold/Arnold-interview1997.pdf |archivedate=2015-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After this event, [[singularity theory]] became one of the major interests of Arnold and his students.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ias.ac.in/resonance/Volumes/19/09/0787-0796.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Among his most famous results in this area is his classification of simple singularities, contained in his paper "Normal forms of functions near degenerate critical points, the Weyl groups of A&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;,D&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;,E&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; and Lagrangian singularities".&lt;ref&gt;Note: It also appears in another article by him, but in English: ''Local Normal Forms of Functions'', http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~aar/papers/arnold15.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dirk Siersma|author2=Charles Wall|author3=V.

===Fluid dynamics===
In 1966, Arnold published "{{lang|fr|Sur la géométrie différentielle des groupes de Lie de dimension infinie et ses applications à l'hydrodynamique des fluides parfaits}}", in which he presented a common geometric interpretation for both the [[Euler's equations (rigid body dynamics)|Euler's equations for rotating rigid bodies]] and the [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler's equations of fluid dynamics]], this effectively linked topics previously thought to be unrelated, and enabled mathematical solutions to many questions related to fluid flows and their turbulence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Terence Tao]]|title=Compactness and Contradiction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BawxAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA205|date=22 March 2013|publisher=American Mathematical Soc.|isbn=978-0-8218-9492-7|pages=205–206}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/aug/19/v-i-arnold-obituary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iamp.org/bulletins/old-bulletins/201007.pdf IAMP News Bulletin, July 2010, pp. 25–26]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Real algebraic geometry===
In the year 1971, Arnold published "On the arrangement of ovals of real plane algebraic curves, involutions of four-dimensional smooth [[manifold]]s, and the arithmetic of integral quadratic forms",&lt;ref&gt;Note: The paper also appears with other names, as in http://perso.univ-rennes1.fr/marie-francoise.roy/cirm07/arnold.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which gave new life to [[real algebraic geometry]]. In it, he made major advances in the direction of a solution to [[Gudkov's conjecture]], by finding a connection between it and [[Low-dimensional topology#Four dimensions|four-dimensional topology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=A.

A. Rokhlin]] building on Arnold's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Arnold: Swimming Against the Tide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aBWHBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA159|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0004134.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Symplectic geometry===
The [[Arnold conjecture]], linking the number of fixed points of Hamiltonian symplectomorphisms and the topology of the subjacent manifolds, was the motivating source of many of the pioneer studies in symplectic topology.&lt;ref&gt;"Arnold and Symplectic Geometry", by [[Helmut Hofer]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www-irma.u-strasbg.fr/~maudin/Arnold.pdf Vladimir Igorevich Arnold and the invention of symplectic topology]", by [[Michèle Audin]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Topology===
According to Victor Vassiliev, Arnold "worked comparatively little on topology for topology's sake." And he was rather motivated by problems on other areas of mathematics where topology could be of use. His contributions include the invention of a topological form of the [[Abel–Ruffini theorem]] and the initial development of some of the consequent ideas, a work which resulted in the creation of the field of [[topological Galois theory]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;"Topology in Arnold's work", by [[Victor Vassiliev]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/2008-45-02/S0273-0979-07-01165-2/S0273-0979-07-01165-2.pdf Bulletin (New Series) of The American Mathematical Society Volume 45, Number 2, April 2008, pp. 329–334&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fields Medal omission===
Even though Arnold was nominated for the 1974 [[Fields Medal]], which was then viewed as the highest honour a mathematician could receive, interference from the Soviet government led to it being withdrawn. Arnold's public opposition to the persecution of [[Dissident#Eastern bloc dissidents|dissident]]s had led him into direct conflict with influential Soviet officials, and he suffered persecution himself, including not being allowed to leave the Soviet Union during most of the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Vladimir Igorevich Arnold |author=Martin L.

'''Voluntary childlessness''', also described by some as being '''childfree''', is the [[voluntariness|voluntary]] choice to not have  [[children]].

In most societies and for most of human history choosing not to have children was both difficult and undesirable.  The availability of reliable [[contraception]] along with [[elderly care|support provided in old age]] by systems other than traditional familial ones has made childlessness an option for people in [[developed country|developed countries]], though they may be looked down upon in certain communities.

The usage of the term "childfree" to describe  people who choose not to have [[child]]ren was coined in the English language late in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;. The term does not appear, for example, in the 1971 edition of the ''Oxford English Dictionary''{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1971|page=343|lccn=76-188038}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning of the term "childfree" extends to encompass the children of others (in addition to one’s own children) and this distinguishes it further from the more usual term "childless", which is traditionally used to express the idea of having no children, whether by choice or by circumstance.&lt;ref&gt;The obsolete term "childerless", meaning "without children" is given, for example in {{cite book| title=Oxford English Dictionary | publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1971|page=343| lccn= 76-188038}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'child free' has been cited in Australian literature to refer to parents who are without children at the current time. This may be due to them living elsewhere on a permanent basis or a short-term solution such as childcare (Australian Institute of Family Studies, 2011).

== Commonly shared beliefs ==
Supporters of living childfree (e.g. [[Corinne Maier]], French author of  "No Kids: 40 Reasons For Not Having Children") cite various reasons&lt;ref name=GlobeMaier&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/i-really-regret-it-i-really-regret-having-children/article784948/page3/ | location=Toronto | work=The Globe and Mail | first=Doug | last=Saunders | title=I really regret it. I really regret having children | date=2007-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; for their view:
 
* competing familial or social obligations, such as the role of primary caregiver for a disabled spouse, sibling(s) or parent(s)
* concerns over the effects pregnancy has on the woman's body (weight gain, stretch marks, drooping breasts, hyperpigmentation on the face, looser pelvic muscles leading to reduced sexual pleasure for both the woman and her partner, haemorrhoids etc.)
* economic insufficiency
* lack of access to support networks and resources
* personal well-being&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/281513/having-children-is-not-the-formula-for-a-happy-life/|title=Having children is not the formula for a happy life — Quartz|author=|date=|website=qz.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* existing or possible health problems, including genetic disorders&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1295282/Tragic-mother-watched-husband-4-children-die-Huntingtons-disease.html|title=The curse wiping out all my family: Killer disease hits last of widow's five children|author=|date=|website=dailymail.co.uk|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the reluctance to replicate the genes of one's own parents in cases of child abuse
* fear that sexual activity may decline&lt;ref name="harvey"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=44g2l17a70cC&amp;pg=PA12|title=na|author=|date=|publisher=ProQuest|accessdate=4 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* various fears (for example, of being trapped or disappointed) as well as fears for the child
* damage to relationships or difficulties with them
* fear and/or revulsion towards the physical condition of pregnancy, the [[Fear of childbirth|childbirth experience]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hofberg | first1 =  | last2 = Brockington | first2 =  | year = 2000 | title = Tokophobia: an unreasoning dread of childbirth | url = http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/abstract/176/1/83 | journal = [[British Journal of Psychiatry]] | volume = 176 | issue = | pages = 83–85 | doi=10.1192/bjp.176.1.83}}&lt;/ref&gt; and recovery (for example the erosion of physical desirability)
* belief that one can make a greater contribution to humanity through one's work than through having children
* perceived or actual incapacity to be a responsible and patient parent
* the view that the wish to reproduce oneself is a form of [[narcissism]]
* the absence of a partner with which one deems fit to sexually reproduce
* belief that it is wrong to intentionally have a child when there are so many children available for [[adoption]]
* concern regarding [[environmentalism|environmental]] impacts such as [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]], [[pollution]], resource [[scarcity]] and the resulting effects on the global climate and the welfare of existing children
* [[antinatalism]], the belief that it is inherently immoral to bring people into the world. That is, one may generally wish to spare a potential child from the suffering of life. Moreover, the parent can never get the consent of the unborn child, therefore a decision to procreate would be an imposition of life
* belief in a negative, declining condition of the world and culture and in the need to avoid subjecting a child to those negative conditions. This includes concerns that calamitous events (e.g., [[global warming]] effects, war, or famine) might be likely to occur within the lifetime of one's children and cause their suffering and/or death
* belief that people tend to have children for the wrong reasons (e.g. fear, social pressures from cultural [[norm (social)|norm]]s)
* adherence to the principles of a religious organization which rejects having children&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kent | first1 = S.A. | authorlink = Stephen A. Kent | title = Scientology -- Is this a Religion? | url = http://archiv.ub.uni-marburg.de/mjr/kent.html | journal = [[Marburg Journal of Religion]] | volume = 4 | issue = 1| page = 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or the rejection of procreative religious beliefs imposed by one's family and/or community
* dislike of children
* uncertainty over the stability of the parenting relationship
* lack of the so-called maternal or paternal instinct
* belief that one is too old to have children
* career orientation
* simply not wanting to have children

== Statistics and research ==
According to economist [[David Foot (economist)|David Foot]] of the [[University of Toronto]], the level of a woman's education is the most important factor in determining whether she will [[Fertility|reproduce]]: the higher her level of education, the less likely she is to bear children (or if she does, the fewer children she is likely to have). Overall, researchers have observed childless couples to be more [[educated]], and it is perhaps because of this that they are more likely to be employed in [[professional]] and [[management]] occupations, more likely for both spouses to earn relatively high incomes, and to live in [[urban area]]s. They are also less likely to be [[religious]], subscribe to traditional [[gender roles]], or subscribe to conventional roles.&lt;ref name="blackwell-synergy.com"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Park |first = Kristin | title = Choosing Childlessness: Weber's Typology of Action and Motives of the Voluntarily Childless | journal = Sociological Inquiry | volume = 75 | issue = 3 | pages = 372–402 | publisher = Blackwell Synergy |date=August 2005| url =http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1475-682X.2005.00127.x |doi = 10.1111/j.1475-682X.2005.00127.x | accessdate = 2006-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the proportion of childless adults in the population has increased significantly since then. The proportion of childlessness among women aged 40-44 was 10% in 1976, reached a high of 20% in 2005, then declined to 15% in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2015/05/07/childlessness/|title=Childlessness|last=Livingston|first=Gretchen|date=2015-05-07|website=Pew Research Center’s Social &amp; Demographic Trends Project|access-date=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, childlessness among women aged 40-44 is most common in Austria, Spain and the United Kingdom (in 2010-2011).&lt;ref name="oecd.org"&gt;https://www.oecd.org/els/family/SF_2-5-Childlessness.pdf &lt;/ref&gt; Childlessness is least common across [[Eastern European]] countries,&lt;ref name="oecd.org"/&gt; although [[only child|one child]] families are very common there.

From 2007 to 2011 the fertility rate in the U.S. declined 9%, the [[Pew Research Center]] reporting in 2010 that the birth rate was the lowest in U.S. history and that childfreeness rose across all racial and ethnic groups to about 1 in 5 versus 1 in 10 in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=Time20130812&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2148636,00.html |title=Having It All Without Having Children |last=Sandler |first=Lauren |date=August 12, 2013 |website=TIME |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6IdBMW5g5?url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C2148636%2C00.html |archivedate=August 4, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] released statistics in the first quarter of 2016 confirming that the U.S. fertility rate had fallen to its lowest point since record keeping started in 1909: 59.8 births per 1,000 women, half its high of 122.9 in 1957.&lt;ref name=CNN20160811/&gt;  Even taking the falling fertility rate into account, the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]] still projected that the U.S. population would increase from 319 million (2014) to 400 million by 2051.&lt;ref name=CNN20160811&gt;{{cite web |last1=Park |first1=Madison |title=US fertility rate falls to lowest on record |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/11/health/us-lowest-fertility-rate/index.html |publisher=CNN |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160811105713/http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/11/health/us-lowest-fertility-rate/index.html |archivedate=August 11, 2016 |date=August 11, 2016 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Center of Health Statistics confirms that the percentage of American women of childbearing age who define themselves as childfree (or voluntarily childless) rose sharply in the 1990s—from 2.4 percent in 1982 to 4.3 percent in 1990 to 6.6 percent in 1995.

== Factors involved in voluntary childlessness ==
{{globalize/USA|date=November 2018}}
{{generalise|section|reason=entirely about women|date=November 2018}}
In 2010, updated information on childlessness, based on a 2008 US Census Population Survey, was analyzed by [[Pew Research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2010/06/25/childlessness-up-among-all-women-down-among-women-with-advanced-degrees/ |title=Childlessness Up Among All Women; Down Among Women with Advanced Degrees |last1=Livingston |first1=Gretchen| last2=Cohn |first2=D’Vera |date=25 June 2010 |publisher=[[Pew Research Center]] |accessdate=23 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Age ===
While younger women are more likely to be childless, older women are more likely to state that they intend to remain childless in the future.

=== Marriage and relationships ===
Being unmarried is one of the strongest predictors of childlessness. It has also been suggested through research that married individuals who were concerned about the stability of their marriages were more likely to remain childless.

=== Socioeconomic status/labor force participation===
Most studies on this subject find that higher income predicted childlessness. However, some women report that lack of financial resources was a reason why they decided to remain childless. Childless women in the developed world often express the view that women ultimately have to make a choice between motherhood and having a career. The 2004 Census Bureau data showed nearly half of women with annual incomes over $100,000 are childless.

=== Education ===
{{confusing section|date=November 2018}}
Among women aged 35–44, the chance of being childless was far greater for never-married women (82.5%) than for ever-married (12.9%).  When the same group is analyzed by education level, increasing education correlates with increasing childlessness: not-H.S. graduate (13.5%), H.S. graduate (14.3%), Some College no degree (24.7%), Associate Degree (11.4%), Bachelor's degree (18.2%) and Graduate or Professional degree (27.6%).&lt;ref name="census.gov"&gt;{{cite web |title = Children Ever Born per 1,000 Women, Percent Childless, and Women Who Had a Child in the Last Year by Race, Hispanic Origin, Nativity |year = 2004 |url = https://www.census.gov/population/socdemo/fertility/cps2004/tab03-05.xls |access-date = 2017-12-07 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061015144638/http://www.census.gov/population/socdemo/fertility/cps2004/tab03-05.xls |archive-date = 2006-10-15 |dead-url = yes |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Basten, S.

== Social attitudes to remaining childfree ==
Most societies place a high value on parenthood in adult life, so that people who remain childfree are sometimes stereotyped as being "individualistic" people who avoid social responsibility and are less prepared to commit themselves to helping others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keizer | first1 = R | year = 2011 | title = Childlessness and Norms of Familial Responsibility in the Netherlands | url = | journal = Journal of Comparative Family Studies | volume = 1 | issue = 424| pages = 421–438 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, certain groups believe that being childfree is beneficial. With the advent of environmentalism and concerns for stewardship, those choosing to not have children are also sometimes recognized as helping reduce our impact, such as members of the [[voluntary human extinction movement]].  Some childfree are sometimes lauded on moral grounds, such as members of philosophical or religious groups, like the [[Shakers]].

There are three broad areas of criticism regarding childfreeness, based upon socio-political, feminist or religious reasons. There are also considerations relating to personal philosophy and social roles.

=== Feminism ===
Childfreedom may no longer be considered the 'best' way to be feminist. Once a paragon of [[second-wave feminism]], the [[nullipara]] (childless or childfree woman) is not typically described in [[third-wave feminism]] as being superior to, or more feminist than, women who choose to have children. Feminist author [[Daphne DeMarneffe]] links larger feminist issues to both the devaluation of motherhood in contemporary society, as well as the delegitimization of "maternal desire" and pleasure in motherhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first=Daphne| last=DeMarneffe| title=Maternal Desire: On Children, Love, and the Inner Life |publisher=Back Bay Books/Little, Brown, and Company|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In third-wave handbook ''Manifesta: Young Women, Feminism, and the Future'', authors [[Jennifer Baumgardner]] and [[Amy Richards]] explore the concept of third-wave feminists reclaiming "girlie" culture, along with reasons why women of Baby Boomer and [[Generation X]] ages may reject motherhood because, at a young and impressionable age, they witnessed their own mothers being devalued by society and family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first=Jennifer, Amy| last=Baumgardner, Richards| title= Manifesta: Young Women, Feminism, and the Future |publisher=Farrar, Straus, and Giroux| year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, in "The Bust Guide to the New Girl Order"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first=Debbie, Marcelle| last=Stoller, Karp | title= The Bust Guide to the New Girl Order |publisher=Penguin| year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in ''[[Utne Reader]]'' magazine, third-wave feminist writer [[Tiffany Lee Brown]] described the joys and freedoms of childfree living, freedoms such as travel previously associated with males in Western culture. In "Motherhood Lite," she celebrates being an aunt, co-parent, or family friend over the idea of being a mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.utne.com/2001-01-01/motherhood-lite.aspx|title=Motherhood Lite|last=Brown|first=Tiffany Lee|date=2001|website=Utne Reader|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Overpopulation ===
{{Main|Human overpopulation}}
Some believe that overpopulation is a serious problem and some question the fairness of what they feel amount to subsidies for having children, such as the [[Earned Income Tax Credit]] (US), free K–12 education paid for by all taxpayers, family medical leave, and other such programs.&lt;ref name=Burkett&gt;{{Cite news| first=Elinor| last=Burkett| title=The baby boon: how family-friendly America cheats the childless| publisher= Free Press |location = New York,|date= c. 2000| ISBN = 0-684-86303-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Others, however, do not believe overpopulation to be a problem in itself; regarding such problems as overcrowding, global warming, and straining food supplies to be problems of public policy and/or technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Overpopulation Myths |work=Daily Policy Digest, International Issues |publisher=National Center for Policy Analysis |date=1995-10-05 |url=http://www.ncpa.org/sub/dpd/index.php?page=article&amp;Article_ID=13087 |accessdate=12 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have argued that this sort of [[conscientiousness]] is self-eliminating (assuming it is heritable), so by avoiding reproduction for ethical reasons the childfree will only aid deterioration of concern for the environment and future generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hardin |first=Garrett |date= December 13, 1968 |title=The Tragedy of the Commons |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |url=http://www.garretthardinsociety.org/articles/art_tragedy_of_the_commons.html |accessdate= 2008-01-25|doi=10.1126/science.162.3859.1243 |volume=162|pages=1243–8 |pmid=5699198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Government and taxes ===
Some regard governmental or employer-based incentives offered only to parents—such as a per-child income tax credit, preferential absence planning, employment legislation, or special facilities—as intrinsically discriminatory, arguing for their removal, reduction, or the formation of a corresponding system of matching incentives for other categories of social relationships. Childfree advocates argue that other forms of caregiving have historically not been considered equal—that "only babies count"—and that this is an outdated idea that is in need of revision. Caring for [[Human care|sick, disabled]], or [[Elderly care|elderly]] dependents entails significant financial and emotional costs but is not currently subsidized in the same manner. This commitment has traditionally and increasingly fallen largely on women, contributing to the [[feminization of poverty]] in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|first=Carol|last=Levine|title=Panel Presentation: Long Term Care and Caregiving|location=[[White House|1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, D.C]]|url=http://www.rehab.research.va.gov/register/levine.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The focus on personal acceptance is mirrored in much of the literature surrounding choosing not to reproduce. Many early books were grounded in [[feminism|feminist]] theory and largely sought to dispel the idea that womanhood and motherhood were necessarily the same thing, arguing, for example, that childfree people face not only social discrimination but political discrimination as well.&lt;ref name=Burkett /&gt;

=== Religion ===
[[Abrahamic religion]]s such as [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]], as well as [[Hinduism]] place a high value on children and their central place in marriage.   In numerous works, including an Apostolic letter written in 1988,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

  | accessdate=12 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope John Paul II]] has set forth the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] emphasis on the role of children in family life. However, the Catholic Church also stresses the value of [[chastity]] in the non-married state of life and so approves of nominally childfree ways of life for the single. Some religious interpretations hold that any couple who marries with the intention of not producing children is not married within the church.

There are, however, some debates within religious groups about whether a childfree lifestyle is acceptable. Another view, for example, is that the biblical text Gen. 1:28 "[[wikisource:Bible (King James)/Genesis#Chapter 1|Be fruitful and multiply]]", is really not a command but a blessing formula and that while there are many factors to consider as far as people's motives for remaining childless, there are many valid reasons, including dedicating one's time to demanding but good causes, why Christians may choose to remain childless for a short time or a lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

=== Ethical reasons ===

Brian Tomasik cites ethical reasons for people to remain childfree. Also, they will have more time to focus on themselves, which will allow for greater creativity and the exploration of personal ambitions. In this way, they may benefit themselves and society more than if they had a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tomasik|first=Brian|title=The Cost of Kids|url=http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/cost-of-kids.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The "selfish" issue ===
Some opponents of the childfree choice consider such a choice to be [[selfishness|selfish]]. The rationale of this position is the assertion that raising children is a very important activity and so not engaging in this activity must therefore mean living one's life in service to one's self. The value judgment behind this idea is that individuals should endeavor to make some kind of meaningful contribution to the world, but also that the best way to make such a contribution is to have children.  For some people, one or both of these assumptions may be true, but others prefer to direct their time, energy, and talents elsewhere, in many cases toward improving the world that today's children occupy (and that future generations will inherit).&lt;ref name=English&gt;{{Cite news|first=Jane|last=English|title=Childlessness Transformed: Stories of Alternative Parenting|url=http://www.eheart.com/BOOKS/childless/index.html|publisher=Earth Heart|date=December 1986|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061018143740/http://www.eheart.com/BOOKS/childless/index.html|archivedate=2006-10-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of childfreedom posit that choosing ''not'' to have children is no more or less selfish than choosing to have children. Choosing to have children may be the more selfish choice, especially when poor parenting risks creating many long term problems for both the children themselves and society at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first=Catherine| last=Leone| title=Fairness, Freedom and Responsibility: The Dilemma of Fertility Choice in America |publisher=Washington State University|date=December 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; As philosopher [[David Benatar]]&lt;ref name=Benatar&gt;{{Cite news| first=David| last=Benatar| title=Better Never to Have Been| publisher=Oxford University Press| date=2006-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; explains, at the heart of the decision to bring a child into the world often lies the parents' own desires (to enjoy child-rearing or perpetuate one's legacy/genes), rather than the potential person's interests.  At very least, Benatar believes this illustrates why a childfree person may be just as altruistic as any parent.

There is also the question as to whether having children really is such a positive contribution to the world in an age when there are many concerns about [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]], [[pollution]] and depletion of [[non-renewable resources]]. Some critics counter that such analyses of having children may understate its potential benefits to society (e.g. a greater labor force, which may provide greater opportunity to solve social problems) and overstate the costs. That is, there is often a need for a non-zero [[birth rate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2037/|title=Be Fruitful and Multiply|last=Landsburg|first=Steven E.|date=1997-04-13|newspaper=Slate|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339|access-date=2016-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organizations and political activism ==
Childfree individuals do not necessarily share a unified political or economic philosophy, and most prominent childfree organizations tend to be social in nature. Childfree social groups first emerged in the 1970s and 1980s, most notable among them the [[National Alliance for Optional Parenthood]] and [[No Kidding!]] in North America where numerous books have been written about childfree people and where a range of social positions related to childfree interests have developed along with political and social activism in support of these interests. The term "childfree" was used in a July 3, 1972 [[Time (magazine)|Time]] article on the creation of the National Organization for Non-Parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,877830,00.html | work=Time | title=Behavior: Down with Kids | date=1972-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was revived in the 1990s when Leslie Lafayette formed a later childfree group, the Childfree Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first=Madelyn| last=Cain| title= The Childless Revolution |publisher=Purseus Publishing| year=2001}} page 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Organization for Non-Parents (N.O.N.) was begun in Palo Alto, CA by [[Ellen Peck]] and Shirley Radl in 1972.  N.O.N. was formed to advance the notion that men and women could choose not to have children—to be childfree.  Changing its name to the [[National Alliance for Optional Parenthood]], it continued into the early 1980s both as a support group for those making the decision to be childfree and an advocacy group fighting pronatalism (attitudes/advertising/etc. promoting or glorifying parenthood).  According to its bylaws, the purpose of the National Alliance for Optional Parenthood was to educate the public on non-parenthood as a valid lifestyle option, support those who choose not to have children, promote awareness of the overpopulation problem, and assist other groups that advanced the goals of the organization. N.O.N.'s offices were located in Reisterstown, MD; then Baltimore, MD; and, ultimately, in Washington, D.C. N.O.N. designated August 1 as Non-Parents' Day. Just as people with children come from all shades of the political spectrum and temper their beliefs accordingly, so do the childfree. For example, while some childfree people think of [[government]] welfare to parents as "lifestyle subsidies," others accept the need to assist such individuals but think that their lifestyle should be equally compensated. Still others accept the need to help out such individuals and also do not ask for subsidies of their own.

There are suggestions of an emergence of political cohesion, for example an [[Australian Childfree Party]] (ACFP) proposed in Australia as a childfree political party, promoting the childfree lifestyle as opposed to the family lifestyle.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}  Increasing politicization and [[Mass media|media]] interest has led to the emergence of a second wave of childfree organizations that are openly political in their raisons d'être, with a number of attempts to mobilize political pressure groups in the U.S.  The first organization to emerge was [[Great Britain|British]], known as [[Kidding Aside]].  The childfree movement has not had significant political impact.

'''Wolfgang Konrad Spohn''' (born 20 March 1950 in [[Tübingen]]) is a German [[philosopher]]. He is [[professor]] of [[philosophy]] and [[philosophy of science]] at the [[University of Konstanz]].

== Biography ==

Wolfgang Spohn studied philosophy, [[logic]] and philosophy of science and [[mathematics]] at the [[University of Munich]] and acquired there the [[Magister (degree)|MA]] (1973) and the [[Ph.D.]] (1976) with a thesis on the ''Grundlagen der Entscheidungstheorie''. In his time as an assistant professor he earned the [[habilitation]] (1984) with a thesis about ''Eine Theorie der Kausalität''. He held professorships at the [[University of Regensburg]] (1986–91), the [[University of Bielefeld]] (1991-96), and the University of Konstanz (since 1996).

Spohn is editor of the philosophical journal ''[[Erkenntnis]]'' and was its editor-in-chief from 1988 to 2001. He is a founding member of the ''Gesellschaft für Analytische Philosophie'' and was its vice-president from 2006 to 2012. He was a Fellow at the ''[[Institute for Advanced Study, Berlin|Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin]]'' (1985/86) and a [[Distinguished Visiting Professor]] at the [[University of California, Irvine]] (1988). Since 2002 he is a member of the ''[[German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina|Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina]]'' and since 2015 a member of the [[Academia Europaea]]. In 2012 he was the first outside Anglosaxon academia to win the ''[[Lakatos Award]]'' of the [[London School of Economics]] for his book ''The Laws of Belief. Ranking Theory and its Philosophical Applications''. In 2015 he received the Frege Prize of the ''Gesellschaft für Analytische Philosophie'' for outstanding achievements of a German speaking philosopher in the field of analytic philosophy.

Spohn is the youngest brother of the historical sociologist [[Willfried Spohn]] and of the mathematical physicist [[Herbert Spohn]].

== Research ==

Spohn is most well known for his contributions to formal [[epistemology]], in particular for comprehensively developing ranking theory&lt;ref&gt;''The Laws of Belief. Ranking Theory and its Philosophical Applications'', Oxford University Press, Oxford 2012 (xvi + 598 pp.)&lt;/ref&gt; since 1982, which is his theory of the dynamics of belief. It is an alternative to [[probability theory]] and of similar philosophical impact as a formal account of the dynamics of belief. Spohn's research extends to [[philosophy of science]], the [[Causality|theory of causation]], [[metaphysics]] and [[ontology]], [[philosophy of language]] and [[Philosophy of mind|mind]], [[Two-dimensionalism|two-dimensional semantics]], [[philosophical logic]], and [[Decision theory|decision]] and [[game theory]] (see the collection of papers&lt;ref&gt;''Causation, Coherence, and Concepts. A Collection of Essays'', Springer, Dordrecht, 2008 (xvi + 386 pp.)&lt;/ref&gt;). His dissertation&lt;ref&gt;''Grundlagen der Entscheidungstheorie'', Scriptor, Kronberg/Ts. 1978; PDF version :  http://www.uni-konstanz.de/FuF/Philo/Philosophie/files/grundlagen_der_entscheidungstheorie.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and his paper Stochastic Independence, Causal Independence, and Shieldability&lt;ref&gt;„Stochastic Independence, Causal Independence, and Shieldability“, ''Journal of Philosophical Logic'' 9 (1980) 73-99&lt;/ref&gt; are precursors of the theory of [[Bayesian network]]s and their causal interpretation. His paper ''How to Make Sense of Game Theory''&lt;ref&gt;„How to Make Sense of Game Theory“, in: W. Stegmüller, W. Balzer, W. Spohn (Hg.), ''Philosophy of Economics'', Springer, Berlin u.a. 1982, pp. 239-270; reprinted in: Y. Varoufakis, A. Housego (eds.), ''Game Theory: Critical Concepts in the Social Sciences'', Vol. IV, Discontents, Routledge, London 2001, pp. 213-241.&lt;/ref&gt; is a forerunner of epistemic game theory.

{{Nihongo|'''Yasuo Yuasa'''|湯浅 泰雄|Yuasa Yasuo|1925&amp;ndash;2005}} was a [[Japan]]ese [[philosopher of religion]]. Yuasa is known for his works on the theory of the body in Western and Asian philosophy and for his teaching. He has been referred to as "one of the most provocative and far-reaching" among Japan's contemporary philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas P. Kasulis, Ohio State University, book cover of ''The Body, Self-Cultivation, and Ki-Energy''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Yasuo Yuasa studied ethics under [[Watsuji Tetsuro]] at [[Tokyo University]]. He later also studied [[yoga]] with [[Hiroshi Motoyama|Motoyama Hiroshi]], and these studies influenced his philosophical views.&lt;ref name="mccarthy"&gt;Erin McCarthy: ''Yuasa Yasuo (1925&amp;ndash;2001): A retrospective of his life and work'' ([http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1748-0922.2007.00193.x/abstract first page view])&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In his early jears Yuasa took up a position as assistant in the Ethics Department at the [[University of Tokyo]]. His places of employment include [[Yamanashi University]], [[Osaka University]], the [[University of Tsukuba]] and [[Obirin University]].&lt;ref name="mccarthy"/&gt;

==Work==
Much of his work, particularly since the end of the 1970s, has focused on theories of the body in Asian and Western philosophy, in religion and in medicine. He had particular interest in the [[mind-body problem]], also developing his own model of mind-body function.

The basis of Yuasa's work lies in both Eastern and Western traditions. He  studied the works of [[Kitaro Nishida]], of his teacher Tetsuro Watsuji, of [[Kiyoshi Miki]] and of  [[Hajime Tanabe]];&lt;ref name="boutry-stadelmann"&gt;Boutry-Stadelmann, B.: [http://de.scribd.com/doc/56662973/Stadelmann-Britta-Yuasa-Yasuo-s-Theory-of-the-Body Yuasa Yasuo's Theory of the Body]&lt;/ref&gt; he also took into consideration Eastern meditation practices such as [[zazen|zen meditation]] and [[yoga]], the Eastern notion of the [[Meridian (Chinese medicine)|meridians]] of the body, as well as Western [[depth psychology]], in particular the [[Carl Jung|Jungian]] approach.&lt;ref name="Ozawa-2002"&gt;Chikako Ozawa–De Silva: ''Beyond the body/mind? Japanese contemporary thinkers on alternative sociologies of the body'', Body &amp; Society, 2002 Sage Publications, Vol. 8, No. 2, pp. 21–38 {{DOI|10.1177/1357034X02008002002}} ([http://bod.sagepub.com/content/8/2/21.full.pdf+html full text])&lt;/ref&gt;

Yuasa looks at [[René Descartes|Descartes]]' [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]], and the contrasting philosophies of [[idealism]] with focus on the mind (spirit) and [[materialism]] with focus on the body (matter), and re-evaluates them in the light of Eastern non-dualistic thinking.&lt;ref name="boutry-stadelmann"/&gt; True to Eastern tradition, he emphasizes that there exists no clear distinction between body and mind. While this is mainly an Eastern point of view, Yuasa acknowledged that similar thoughts have been expressed also by some Western thinkers, for example [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty|Merleau-Ponty]]. Yasuo goes further than existing philosophical tradition in postulating that the unity of body and mind is not a natural state or innate relationship, but rather a state to be achieved.&lt;ref name="corazza-2007"&gt;Ornello Corazza: [http://www.soas.ac.uk/csjr/newsletter/file25116.pdf Rethinking embodiment: A Japanese contemporary perspective. A workshop in commemoration of Professor Yasuo Yuasa (1925–2005)], Center for the Study of Japanese Religions, CSJR Newsletter, January 2007, No. 14/15 (with an account by Shigenori Nagatomo of Yuasa's ''Theory of the Body''&lt;/ref&gt; He points out the crucial role of self-cultivation for achieving such 'oneness of body–mind'.&lt;ref name="Ozawa-2002"/&gt;

Expressed in simplified terms, Yuasa's scheme of the body consists in four systems: sensory-motor awareness ([[somesthesis]], much like the sensory-motor apparatus of [[Henri Bergson|Bergson]] or the sensory-motor circuit of Merleau-Ponty&lt;ref&gt;Thomas P. Kasulis, Roger T. Aimes: ''Self As Body in Asian Theory and Practice'', chapter "Yasua's Bodily Scheme", pp. 334 ff., State University of New York Press, 1993, {{ISBN|0-7914-1079-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;), kinaesthetic awareness ([[kinesthesis]]), emotion-instinct (governing the [[autonomic nervous system]]) and an unconscious 'quasi-body' (exemplidied in the [[qi|ki]]-energy flow through the body's meridians).&lt;ref name="corazza-2007"/&gt;

Yasuo distinguishes ''bright consciousness'' and ''dark consciousness'', comparing the latter to the Western idea of the [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]]. It has been pointed out that his concept of ''dark consciousness'' is more similar to the notion of [[subconsciousness]] of [[Frederic W. H. Myers]] and [[William James]] than to [[Sigmund Freud]]'s concept of the unconscious.&lt;ref&gt;G. William Barnard: ''Living Consciousness: The Metaphysical Vision of [[Henri Bergson]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Yuasa has written numerous books on [[Western philosophy]], [[psychoanalytic theory]], [[Eastern philosophy|Asian philosophy]] and on the cultural history of Japan.

He has authored more than 50 books and over 300 articles.&lt;ref name="mccarthy"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9471">'''Yuji Yoshimura''' (February 27, 1921 [[Tokyo, Japan]] – December 24, 1997 [[Boston, Massachusetts]]) was a second-generation distinguished [[bonsai]] master who taught traditional Japanese techniques and aesthetics to enthusiasts in the [[Western world|West]].

==Early life and career==

Yoshimura was the second son born to the family of Toshiji Yoshimura. Toshiji (1891-1975) was a leader in the bonsai world and one of the top [[suiseki]] (viewing stone) authorities in Japan. He was also a co-founder of the Nippon Bonsai Society. Toshiji's father had been a [[samurai]] and a renowned garden designer.&lt;ref&gt;Valvanis, "Yuji Yoshimura", p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1952, the 31-year-old Yoshimura, assisted by German agricultural diplomat Alfred Koehn, began the first bonsai course for foreigners in Tokyo at his Kofu-en nursery. Yoshimura refused to believe the prevailing wisdom that westerners could not understand, appreciate, or technically master bonsai. The class was an instant success, and within three years over 600 students—mostly foreign dignitaries, military personnel and businessmen and their wives—took the six-lesson course in classical bonsai art.&lt;ref&gt;Valvanis, "Yuji Yoshimura", p. 32-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the class, Yoshimura grouped the various stylings of bonsai trees into five primary categories.  He also systematized much information that previously had only been passed down orally and by example from teacher to student.  With the assistance of Giovanna M. Halford, a student of his from England, Yoshimura worked on a companion text.  Empirical information about hundreds of types of plants used for the compositions was also compiled into a detailed database at the end of the book.  In 1957, ''The Japanese Art of Miniature Trees and Landscapes'' was published by [[Tuttle Publishing|Charles E. Tuttle Co.]] of [[Rutland (city), Vermont|Rutland, Vermont]] and Tokyo.  Although there had been a few earlier Bonsai books in English by this time, this was the first comprehensive and practical work on the subject. It was received with excitement by those who were eager to learn classical bonsai as refined during the first half of the twentieth century.  The book later came to be referred to as the "Bonsai Bible in English"; it is currently in its 37th printing.&lt;ref&gt;''Golden Statements'', p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yoshimura was invited in 1958 to the [[Brooklyn Botanic Garden]] by its director George Avery. Yoshimura came to the United States with over one ton of teaching and demonstrating material, and six weeks later he gave his first course at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, entitled "Bonsai Study &amp; Practice". This very successful course was one of many which Yoshimura taught on many levels during the spring and autumn of that year while on the C. Stuart Gager fellowship grant.  Yoshimura extended his teaching and lecturing to the West Coast and Hawaii, later returning to teach at Longwood Garden near Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, pp. 159-160.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dillon&gt;Dillon, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=val34&gt;Valvanis, "Yuji Yoshimura", p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962 Yoshimura spent two months in Australia, where he made a lasting impression.  Bonsai was still in its infancy in Australia, and he assisted the early teachers and students, and became the patron of a bonsai group.&lt;ref name=val35&gt;Valvanis, "Yuji Yoshimura", p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of 1963, Yoshimura and several of his students founded the Bonsai Society of Greater New York. Within three years there were 555 members, including 339 corresponding members in thirty-one states and several foreign countries.&lt;ref name=dillon/&gt;&lt;ref name=val35/&gt;

==Later career and influence==

During 1972, Yoshimura delivered a lecture in which he spoke of the "dream of American bonsaists for a place where they could give or will their treasures, knowing that the trees would be cared for and viewed by visitors for years to come." Newly appointed Director of the [[U.S. National Arboretum]] Dr. John L. Creech was in attendance. Creech had been a frequent visitor to Yoshimura's Tokyo garden in the early 1950s and was actually the one who had recommended the bonsai authority to Dr. Avery of the BBG.

Impressed by his old friend's thoughts and the fledgling Potomac Bonsai Association's first show at the National Arboretum, Dr. Creech then approached his departmental heads with the suggestion that acquiring a major bonsai collection might play a role in the Department of Agriculture's bicentennial plans. Receiving encouragement, Dr. Creech sought the help of longtime friends in the world of Japanese horticulture.  The result was a bicentennial gift to the U.S. from persons and organizations in Japan of fifty-three bonsai and six suiseki (viewing stones) which became the initial collection in the National Bonsai and Penjing Museum.&lt;ref name=val34/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"How It All Began", p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

His convention and club lectures, workshops, demonstrations, and articles in Western and Japanese specialty magazines spread Yoshimura's philosophy.  His most important American student was [[William N. Valavanis]].  Yoshimura assisted his student, who became a well-respected teacher in his own right, in launching the premier issue in the Spring of 1979 of the quarterly ''International Bonsai''. The elder sensei also translated its first article -- "Creation of Small Size Satsuki Azalea Bonsai"—from the Japanese magazine source. Valavanis' independent magazine continues to be published to this day.

In 1982 Yoshimura conducted a teaching tour for the bonsai clubs in India. 
Also that year the [[National Bonsai Foundation]], Inc., a non-profit corporation in Washington, D.C., was formed on behalf of the National Bonsai and Penjing Museum of the National Arboretum. [[John Naka]], Yuji Yoshimura, and now former Arboretum Director Dr. John L. Creech were elected as advisors to the Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;"How It All Began", p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dannett, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984 ''The Japanese Art of Stone Appreciation, Suiseki and Its Use with Bonsai'' was published by Charles E. Tuttle Co. The authors were Vincent T. Covello and Yuji Yoshimura.  This would also become a go-to reference work on the subject.

The John Y. Naka Pavilion was dedicated in October 1990 to house the National Collection of North American Bonsai. Connected to the Naka Pavilion is the Yoshimura Center housing a lecture and workshop room. Two of Yoshimura's bonsai are in the National Collection.&lt;ref&gt;Valvanis, "Profile of an Artist, pp. 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Bonsai Foundation, Inc. established the Yuji Yoshimura Fund as a permanent endowment to keep this great artist's spirit alive for future generations.&lt;ref&gt;Valvanis, "Profile of an Artist", p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having lived in the Western world for over thirty-five years, Yoshimura had personally observed the differences in the Eastern and Western cultures as reflected by their arts. Although his students had been primarily of the United States, he taught classical bonsai to thousands of students worldwide. In that Yuji Yoshimura was a Japanese bonsai artist who lived outside Japan for such a long span of years, he became a direct link between Japanese classical bonsai traditions and the progressive Western approach. The result was an elegant and refined school of bonsai adapted for the modern world.  And Yoshimura encouraged the use of native plants and local stylings by enthusiasts around the globe practicing this now widespread art.&lt;ref&gt;''Golden Statements'', pp. 24-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Yoshimura became the second inductee into the [[National Bonsai Foundation|National Bonsai &amp; Penjing Museum]]'s Bonsai Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bonsaibark.com/2017/10/12/bill-valavanis-inducted-into-the-bonsai-hall-of-fame/| author= Schoech, Wayne| title= Bill Valavanis Inducted into the Bonsai Hall of Fame |date=2017-10-12 |accessdate=2017-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
